Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to get stone1 to a goal location, which in this case is pos42. The initial state has the agent at pos13 and stone1 at pos33. So, I need to figure out how to move the agent to push the stone from pos33 to pos42.

First, the agent is at pos13. They need to get to a position where they can push the stone. Since the stone is at pos33, the agent needs to be adjacent to it in the direction they want to push. Looking at the movement possibilities, from pos13, the agent can move right to pos23, then right again to pos33. Wait, but pos33 has the stone. So the agent can't move directly there. Instead, maybe they can move around.

Let me check the allowed movements. From pos13, the agent can move right to pos23. From pos23, they can move right to pos33, but that's where the stone is. So that's blocked. So maybe the agent needs to approach from another direction. Let's see: pos33's adjacent locations are pos23 (up), pos32 (left?), pos34 (down), and pos43 (right). Wait, directions might be a bit confusing here. Let me check the movement directions again.

Looking at the movement connections: For example, moving from pos23 to pos33 is direction right. So pos23 is to the left of pos33. So if the agent is at pos23 and moves right, they would go to pos33. But since pos33 has the stone, the agent can't move there unless they are pushing the stone. So to push the stone from pos33 to pos43 (right direction), the agent needs to be at pos33's left (pos23) and push right. But wait, pos33 is currently clear? Wait, no. The initial state says "Location pos33 is clear", but stone1 is at pos33. Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, the initial state says "stone1 is at location pos33" and "Location pos33 is clear". Hmm, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Oh, the "clear" means that there's no agent or stone in that location. Wait, but if the stone is there, then it's not clear. So perhaps there's an error in the problem statement. Wait, let me check again.

The original state says "stone1 is at location pos33" and "Location pos33 is clear". That's a contradiction. Wait, maybe "clear" refers to being free for the agent to move into. But if a stone is there, then it's not clear. So this must be a mistake. Wait, but according to the problem's initial state, pos33 has stone1, but it's listed as clear. That's conflicting. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Let me check the problem again.

Wait, in the original state under "Location pos33 is clear". But the stone is at pos33. That's impossible. Unless "clear" refers to something else. Wait, perhaps "clear" means that there's no agent or other stones blocking movement, but the stone itself is allowed? No, that doesn't make sense. Because when a stone is at a location, that location is occupied and not clear. So maybe this is a typo. Wait, the original state says:

"Location pos13 is clear"
"Location pos33 is clear"

But stone1 is at pos33. So this must be a mistake. But perhaps the problem is designed that way. Maybe in this domain, a location is considered clear if it's not occupied by the agent. Because stones can be pushed. So, perhaps "clear" here refers to the agent being able to move there. So even if a stone is present, the location is clear for the agent to push. Wait, but in the preconditions for the move action, it says that the location l_to must be clear. So if a stone is at l_to, the move action can't be performed. So the initial state must have a mistake here. Because pos33 has a stone but is listed as clear. That's conflicting. Hmm. Maybe I need to proceed with the given information, assuming that pos33 is indeed clear (no stone), but that contradicts the stone1 being there. Wait, no. Let me check again.

The original state includes:

"stone1 is at location pos33"

And later:

"Location pos33 is clear"

So that's a contradiction. Unless "clear" here means something else. Wait, perhaps the problem has an error. But maybe the initial state is correct, and "clear" refers to the agent's presence. So, a location is clear if there's no agent there. But stones can be present. That would make sense. So, if a location has a stone but no agent, it's considered clear. Because the agent can move to a location with a stone if they are pushing it. Wait, no. The move action's precondition is that the location l_to is clear. So if there's a stone at l_to, the agent can't move there. Therefore, the initial state must have a mistake. But since this is a problem given to me, I have to work with the information as provided. So perhaps in this case, pos33 is clear despite having the stone. That's confusing, but maybe the problem defines "clear" as not having the agent. So, the stone's presence doesn't affect the "clear" status. That might be possible.

Alternatively, maybe the problem statement has a typo, and the stone is at pos33, which is a non-goal location, and the goal is to move it to pos42, which is a goal. But I have to proceed with the given information.

Assuming that the initial state is correct, even though pos33 has the stone and is considered clear. Then, the agent is at pos13. The stone is at pos33. The goal is to get the stone to a goal location (pos42).

So, the agent needs to reach the stone and push it to pos42. Let's map the path.

First, the agent is at pos13. Let's see possible movements. From pos13, they can move right to pos23, up to pos12, or down to pos14. To reach pos33, they need to move right to pos23, then right again to pos33. But moving to pos33 requires that pos33 is clear. But pos33 has the stone, so the move action can't be used here. Therefore, the agent can't move directly to pos33. Instead, they need to push the stone from pos33.

Wait, but the stone is at pos33, and the agent can't be there. So to push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent to it in a direction that allows pushing. For example, if the agent is at pos23 (to the left of pos33), they can push the stone to the right (pos43). But pos43 is not a goal. Alternatively, pushing the stone up or down. Wait, the directions are dirup, dirdown, dirleft, dirright.

Looking at the movement connections: From pos23, you can move right to pos33. So direction dirright from pos23 leads to pos33. So if the agent is at pos23, they can push the stone from pos33 to pos43 (dirright). But pos43 is not a goal. Alternatively, pushing it down from pos33. Let's see: from pos33, moving down (dirdown) would go to pos34. But pos34 is not a goal. The only goal is pos42.

So the stone needs to go from pos33 to pos42. Let's see the path. pos33 is at row 3, column 3. pos42 is row 4, column 2. So to get from pos33 to pos42, the stone needs to move left and down. Or maybe up and left? Let me map the coordinates:

Assuming the grid is 5x5, with rows 1 to 5 and columns 1 to 5. So pos42 is row 4, column 2.

pos33 is row 3, column 3.

To get from pos33 to pos42, the stone needs to move down (to row 4) and left (to column 2). So possible path: pos33 → pos43 (right?), but wait, pos43 is column 3, row4. Then from pos43, left to pos42. But pos42 is a goal. So pushing the stone from pos33 to pos43 (right), then from pos43 to pos42 (left). But the agent needs to be in the correct position each time.

Alternatively, maybe a more direct path. Let's see:

From pos33, moving left (dirleft) would take the stone to pos32. Then from pos32, moving down (dirdown) to pos42. Because pos32 to pos42 is direction dirright? Wait, looking at the movement directions:

Looking at the allowed movements, for example:

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright"

Wait, pos32 is row3, column2. Moving right (dirright) would take to pos33? No, that's column3. Wait, perhaps the directions are defined differently. Wait, the movement from pos32 to pos42 is direction dirright. So pos32 to pos42 is right? That doesn't make sense spatially. Wait, pos32 is (3,2), pos42 is (4,2). So moving down. But the direction is dirright. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the directions are not aligned with the grid as I thought. Let me check the movement connections again.

Looking at the movement from pos32:

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos31 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown"

Wait, so dirleft from pos32 is to pos22 (row2, column2), which is up? Because pos22 is row2, column2. So dirleft corresponds to moving up? Or perhaps the directions are named differently. Maybe dirleft is moving west, dirright east, dirup north, dirdown south. But in that case, moving from pos32 to pos42 (which is south) would be dirdown, but according to the problem, moving from pos32 to pos42 is dirright. That's conflicting. So maybe the directions are not cardinal directions but relative. For example, dirright could mean moving to the next column, regardless of row. But that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the directions are named based on the grid's layout. For example, moving right increases the row number? That seems inconsistent.

This is a bit confusing. Let's take a specific example: pos32 to pos42 is dirright. So moving from row3, column2 to row4, column2 is dirright. That would imply that dirright is moving down a row. Similarly, dirleft could be moving up a row. But that's counterintuitive. Alternatively, maybe the grid is laid out such that moving right increases the column, and moving down increases the row. So pos11 is row1, column1; pos12 is row1, column2; pos21 is row2, column1. Then, moving right would increase the column (e.g., pos11 → pos12), moving down increases the row (pos11 → pos21). Then, dirright is east, dirdown is south, dirleft is west, dirup is north.

In that case, moving from pos32 (row3, column2) to pos42 (row4, column2) would be moving down, which is dirdown. But according to the problem statement, the movement from pos32 to pos42 is dirright. That contradicts. So perhaps the directions are named differently. Let me check another movement: pos33 to pos43 is dirright. pos33 is row3, column3; pos43 is row4, column3. So moving down is dirright. That doesn't align with standard directions. This suggests that the directions are not aligned with the grid as I thought. Therefore, I need to look at the movement directions as defined in the problem.

For example, from pos32, you can move dirright to pos42. So pos32 → pos42 is dirright. So dirright in this case means moving down a row. Similarly, pos32 can move dirleft to pos22 (up a row). So the directions are as follows:

- dirright: down a row (same column)
- dirleft: up a row (same column)
- dirup: left column (same row)
- dirdown: right column (same row)

Wait, that might not make sense. Let's take another example. pos13 can move dirright to pos23. pos13 is row1, column3; pos23 is row2, column3. So moving dirright here is moving down a row. Similarly, pos23 can move dirright to pos33 (row3, column3). So dirright is moving down a row. Then, dirleft would be moving up a row. Dirup and dirdown would be moving left or right in columns. Let's check another movement: pos12 can move dirdown to pos13. pos12 is row1, column2; pos13 is row1, column3. So dirdown here is moving right in the column. Similarly, pos13 can move dirdown to pos14 (row1, column4). So dirdown increases the column by 1. Dirup would decrease the column by 1. Dirright increases the row by 1. Dirleft decreases the row by 1.

So, the directions are as follows:

- dirright: row +1 (down)
- dirleft: row -1 (up)
- dirdown: column +1 (right)
- dirup: column -1 (left)

Wait, that's a possible interpretation. Let's verify with another example. pos22 can move dirright to pos32 (row3, column2). So dirright increases the row. pos22 can move dirdown to pos23 (row2, column3), which increases the column. So yes, dirright/dirleft affect the row, and dirdown/dirup affect the column. So:

- dirright: row +1 (moving down)
- dirleft: row -1 (moving up)
- dirdown: column +1 (moving right)
- dirup: column -1 (moving left)

This seems to fit. For example, pos32 to pos42 is dirright (row3 → row4). pos32 to pos33 is dirdown (column2 → column3). pos32 to pos31 is dirup (column2 → column1). pos32 to pos22 is dirleft (row3 → row2).

So, with this understanding, directions are:

- dirright: down (row +1)
- dirleft: up (row -1)
- dirdown: right (column +1)
- dirup: left (column -1)

Now, the stone is at pos33 (row3, column3). The goal is pos42 (row4, column2). So to move the stone from pos33 to pos42, the path would need to be:

pos33 → pos43 (dirright, row4, column3), then pos43 → pos42 (dirup, column2). But pos42 is a goal. Alternatively, pos33 → pos32 (dirup, column2), then pos32 → pos42 (dirright, row4, column2). Because pos32 is row3, column2. dirright from pos32 takes to pos42 (row4, column2), which is the goal. So pushing the stone from pos32 to pos42 via dirright would place it at the goal.

So the plan would be:

1. Move the agent from pos13 to pos23 (dirright).
2. Move from pos23 to pos33 (dirright), but wait, pos33 has the stone. So the agent can't move there directly. Instead, the agent needs to push the stone.

Wait, but the agent can't move into a location with a stone. So the agent must approach the stone from an adjacent position and push it.

So the stone is at pos33. To push it to pos43 (dirright), the agent needs to be at pos33's left (dirright's opposite?), but according to the movement directions, pushing from pos33 to pos43 (dirright) requires the agent to be at pos33's dirleft (up a row?), which would be pos23. Wait, let's think: to push the stone from pos33 to pos43 (dirright), the agent must be at pos33's dirleft, which is pos23 (since dirleft from pos33 is row2, column3). Wait, no. dirleft from pos33 is row2, column3 (pos23). So the agent must be at pos23, then push the stone from pos33 to pos43. But how?

The action "pushtogoal" or "pushtonongoal" requires the agent to be at l_p, which is adjacent to the stone's current location (l_from) in the direction d. So for the stone at l_from = pos33, to push it to l_to = pos43 (dirright), the agent must be at l_p = pos33's dirleft, which is pos23. Because dirleft from pos33 is pos23 (row2, column3). Then, the agent at pos23 can push the stone from pos33 to pos43 (dirright). But pos43 is not a goal, so we have to use pushtonongoal. Then, from pos43, the agent can push the stone to pos42 (dirup, which decreases column by 1, so from column3 to column2). But pos42 is a goal, so that would be pushtogoal.

But first, the agent needs to get to pos23. Let's see the initial position: pos13. From pos13, moving dirright (row+1) takes to pos23. Then, from pos23, the agent can perform a pushtonongoal action to push the stone from pos33 to pos43, direction dirright. After that, the stone is at pos43. Then, the agent is at pos33. Now, the agent needs to move to pos43's dirleft (pos33) to push the stone to pos42. Wait, pos43 is row4, column3. To push the stone to pos42 (row4, column2), the direction would be dirup (column-1). So the agent needs to be at pos43's dirup direction, which would be pos42's dirright? Wait, no. Let's think again.

To push the stone from pos43 to pos42 (dirup, which is column-1), the agent needs to be at pos43's dirdown direction (column+1), which is pos44? No, wait. The direction for the push is dirup (column-1). So the agent must be at pos43's dirup direction, which is pos43's column-1, same row. Wait, the movement directions are a bit confusing. Let me recheck.

The action "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d" requires that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from in direction d. So for the stone at l_from = pos43, to push it to l_to = pos42 (dirup, column-1), the agent must be at l_p = pos43's dirup direction. Wait, dirup for the agent's movement would be column-1. So pos43's dirup is pos42 (row4, column2). Wait, no. pos43 is row4, column3. dirup (column-1) would be column2, so pos42 (row4, column2). But the agent can't be at pos42 unless it's clear. So to push the stone from pos43 to pos42 (dirup), the agent must be at pos43's dirup direction, which is pos42. But pos42 is a goal location and initially clear. Wait, but if the agent is pushing the stone from pos43 to pos42 (dirup), then the agent needs to be at pos43's dirup, which is pos42. But that's the destination. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the direction in the push action refers to the direction from the stone's current location (l_from) to the new location (l_to). So, when pushing the stone from pos43 to pos42 (which is column-1), the direction is dirup. The agent must be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (pos43) in direction d (dirup). So, adjacent in dirup from pos43 would be pos43's dirup, which is pos42. But the agent can't be at pos42 unless it's clear. So the agent needs to move to pos42 first, then push the stone from pos43 to pos42. But that doesn't make sense because the stone is at pos43, and the agent is at pos42. To push the stone from pos43 to pos42, the agent would need to be on the opposite side. Wait, maybe the direction is the direction the stone is moving. So, if the stone is moving dirup (column-1) from pos43 to pos42, the agent must be at pos43's dirdown (column+1) direction, which is pos44. Then, the agent can push the stone dirup from pos43 to pos42. But that requires the agent to be at pos44. Let's check the movement possibilities.

From pos43, dirdown (column+1) would take to pos44. So pos43's dirdown is pos44 (row4, column4). But the agent would need to be at pos44 to push the stone dirup to pos42. That's possible if the agent can get there. But this seems a longer path.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better path. Let's reconsider the initial steps.

The agent is at pos13. They need to reach a position where they can push the stone to the goal. The stone is at pos33, and the goal is pos42.

Alternative approach: Move the agent to pos32 and push the stone from pos32 to pos42 (dirright), since pos32 to pos42 is dirright. So, if the stone is at pos32, pushing it dirright to pos42 (which is a goal). But the stone is initially at pos33. So how to get it to pos32.

To push the stone from pos33 to pos32 (dirup, column-1), the agent needs to be at pos33's dirdown direction (column+1), which is pos34. Wait, no. Wait, the direction for pushing is dirup (column-1). So the agent must be at pos33's dirup direction (column-1), which is pos32. But the agent can't be at pos32 unless they move there. So the agent needs to move to pos32, then push the stone from pos33 to pos32. Wait, that's not possible because the stone is at pos33, and the agent is at pos32. To push the stone from pos33 to pos32 (dirup), the agent must be adjacent to pos33 in the direction opposite to the push. Wait, maybe I'm getting the directions wrong.

Let me clarify the push action's preconditions. For "pushtogoal" or "pushtonongoal", the agent must be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (stone's current location) in direction d. So for pushing the stone from l_from to l_to in direction d, the agent must be at l_p, which is reachable from l_from by moving in direction d. Wait, no. The precondition says: (iv) you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d. So the agent is at l_p, and l_from is in direction d from l_p. Then, the stone is at l_from, and l_to is in direction d from l_from. So the path is l_p → l_from (direction d), then l_from → l_to (direction d). So the agent is at l_p, adjacent to l_from in direction d. Then, pushing the stone from l_from to l_to (same direction d).

So, for example, to push the stone from pos33 to pos43 (direction dirright), the agent must be at l_p such that l_p → pos33 is direction dirright. Wait, no. The movement from l_p to l_from must be direction d. So if d is dirright, then l_p must be in the direction opposite to dirright from l_from. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let's think:

If the agent is moving from l_p to l_from following direction d, then l_p is the starting point, and moving in direction d leads to l_from. So l_p is the position from which moving in direction d gets to l_from.

So for example, to push the stone from pos33 to pos43 (direction dirright), the agent must be at a position l_p such that moving dirright from l_p leads to pos33. What position is that? dirright increases the row by 1. So l_p must be pos23 (row2, column3). Because moving dirright from pos23 (row2) leads to pos33 (row3). So l_p is pos23, l_from is pos33, l_to is pos43. So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright.

After this action, the stone is at pos43 (non-goal), and the agent is at pos33.

Now, the agent is at pos33, and the stone is at pos43. The next step is to push the stone from pos43 to pos42. pos42 is a goal. So we need to use pushtogoal. To push from pos43 to pos42, the direction must be dirup (since moving from pos43 (column3) to pos42 (column2) is column-1, which is dirup). So the agent needs to be at a position l_p such that moving dirup from l_p leads to pos43. Wait, moving dirup decreases the column by 1. So l_p must be pos44 (column4), because moving dirup (column-1) from pos44 (column4) would lead to pos43 (column3). But pos44 is row4, column4. So to push the stone from pos43 to pos42 (dirup), the agent must be at pos44, move dirup to pos43 (l_from), then push the stone dirup to pos42 (l_to).

So the action would be pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup.

But the agent is currently at pos33. How to get to pos44?

From pos33, the agent can move dirright to pos43 (row4, column3). Then, from pos43, move dirdown (column+1) to pos44. Then, from pos44, perform the pushtogoal action.

But wait, after pushing the stone to pos43, the agent is at pos33. Then, the agent can move dirright to pos43 (but pos43 has the stone, so it's not clear. Wait, after pushing, the stone is at pos43, and the agent is at pos33. So pos43 is occupied by the stone, so the agent can't move there. So the agent needs to find another path to pos44.

From pos33, the agent can move dirdown (column+1) to pos34. Then, from pos34, move dirright (row+1) to pos44. Wait, pos34 is row3, column4. dirright from pos34 would take to row4, column4 (pos44). Yes. So the path would be:

After the first push, agent is at pos33.

1. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown (from pos33 to pos34, direction dirdown (column+1). Preconditions: pos34 must be clear. Initially, pos34 is clear. After the first push, pos33 has the agent, pos43 has the stone. pos34 is still clear. So the agent can move from pos33 to pos34 via dirdown.

2. Then, move dirright from pos34 to pos44. pos44 is clear (initial state says pos44 is clear, and after the first push, it's still clear unless something else happened). So move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright.

3. Now, the agent is at pos44. They can perform pushtogoal to push the stone from pos43 to pos42. So:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup.

This should place the stone at pos42 (goal), and the agent at pos43.

So the complete plan would be:

1. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright
2. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright
3. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
4. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
5. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup

But wait, after step 2, the agent is at pos33. So step 3 is moving from pos33 to pos34 via dirdown (column+1). Then step 4 is moving from pos34 to pos44 via dirright (row+1). Then step 5 is pushing from pos43 to pos42.

Let me verify the preconditions for each step.

Step 1: move player1 from pos13 to pos23 dirright.

Preconditions: agent is at pos13, pos23 is clear. Initially, pos23 is clear. Yes.

Effect: agent moves to pos23, pos13 is clear, pos23 is occupied.

Step 2: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright.

Preconditions:

- agent is at pos23 (yes)
- stone1 is at pos33 (yes)
- pos43 is clear (initially yes)
- can move from pos23 to pos33 via dirright (yes)
- can move from pos33 to pos43 via dirright (yes)
- pos43 is not a goal (correct, since pos43 is not a goal)

Effects:

- agent moves from pos23 to pos33 (wait, no. The effect of pushtonongoal is that agent is no longer at pos23, and is now at pos33. Because after pushing, the agent moves to pos33 (l_from). So yes.

So after this action, agent is at pos33, stone1 is at pos43, pos23 is clear, pos33 is clear (since agent is there?), pos43 has the stone.

Step 3: move player1 from pos33 to pos34 dirdown.

Preconditions: agent is at pos33, pos34 is clear. Initially, pos34 is clear. After step 2, pos34 is still clear. Yes.

Effect: agent moves to pos34, pos33 becomes clear.

Step4: move player1 from pos34 to pos44 dirright.

Preconditions: agent is at pos34, pos44 is clear. pos44 is initially clear. After step3, pos44 is still clear. Yes.

Effect: agent moves to pos44.

Step5: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup.

Preconditions:

- agent is at pos44 (yes)
- stone1 is at pos43 (yes)
- pos42 is clear (initially yes, and after previous steps, no actions should have affected pos42)
- can move from pos44 to pos43 via dirup. Wait, dirup is column-1. pos44 is row4, column4. dirup would take to column3, row4: pos43. Yes.
- can move from pos43 to pos42 via dirup (column-1). pos42 is row4, column2. Wait, dirup from pos43 (row4, column3) would be column-1, so column2: pos42. Yes.
- pos42 is a goal (yes)

Effects:

- agent moves from pos44 to pos43 (l_from)
- stone1 moves to pos42 (l_to)
- pos43 is clear (stone moves out, agent moves in)
- pos44 becomes clear
- stone1 is at goal.

This satisfies all preconditions and effects. The final state has stone1 at pos42, which is a goal.

So the plan is 5 steps. Is there a shorter plan?

Alternative approach: Can the agent push the stone from pos33 to pos32 (dirup), then from pos32 to pos42 (dirright)?

To push from pos33 to pos32 (dirup), the agent must be at pos33's dirdown direction (column+1), which is pos34. Wait, no. Let me think again.

For pushing the stone from pos33 to pos32 (dirup, column-1), the agent must be at a location l_p such that moving dirup from l_p leads to pos33. dirup is column-1, so l_p must be pos34 (column4), because dirup from pos34 (column4) would take to column3: pos33. Wait, pos34 is row3, column4. dirup is column-1, so from pos34, dirup would be column3, row3: pos33. Yes. So the agent must be at pos34 to push the stone from pos33 to pos32 (dirup). But initially, the agent is at pos13. To get to pos34, the agent would need to move from pos13 to pos14 (dirdown), then pos14 to pos24 (dirright), pos24 to pos34 (dirright). Then, push the stone from pos33 to pos32. Then, push from pos32 to pos42. Let's see how many steps that would take.

Path:

1. move pos13 → pos14 (dirdown)
2. move pos14 → pos24 (dirright)
3. move pos24 → pos34 (dirright)
4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos32 dirup
5. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos32 pos42 dirright. Wait, no. After step4, the stone is at pos32. The agent is at pos33. To push from pos32 to pos42, the agent needs to be at pos32's dirright direction, which is pos42. But pos42 is a goal. So the agent must move to pos32's dirright direction (pos42), which is clear. So:

After step4, agent is at pos33. Then:

5. move pos33 → pos32 (dirleft)
6. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos32 pos42 dirright.

But wait, pos32 is where the stone is after step4. So step5: moving from pos33 to pos32 is possible only if pos32 is clear. But after step4, the stone is at pos32, so pos32 is not clear. Therefore, the agent can't move there. So this approach doesn't work.

Thus, the initial plan of 5 steps seems to be the shortest possible.
