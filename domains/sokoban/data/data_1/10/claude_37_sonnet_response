Let me analyze this problem step by step.

We have a 2D grid world with:
- Player1 initially at pos51
- Stone1 initially at pos23
- Only one goal location at pos12
- We need to move Stone1 to the goal location (pos12)

Two constraints:
1. The player must be at pos24 at some point
2. If the player is at pos24, then at that state or a later state, stone1 must be at pos44

Let's visualize the grid to better understand the layout:

```
pos11 pos12(G) pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22    pos23* pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32    pos33  pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42    pos43  pos44 pos45
pos51*pos52    pos53  pos54 pos55
```

Where:
- pos51 has Player1 initially (marked with *)
- pos23 has Stone1 initially (marked with *)
- pos12 is a goal location (marked with G)

Let's think about the plan:

1. First, we need to move the player from pos51 to reach the stone at pos23
2. We need to push the stone to the goal location at pos12
3. We need to ensure the player is at pos24 at some point
4. We need to ensure that when the player is at pos24, the stone is at pos44 at that time or later

From the initial state:
- Player at pos51
- Stone at pos23

The player needs to navigate to a position adjacent to the stone to push it. Let's work out a plan to push the stone to the goal.

To push the stone from pos23 to pos12, we need to:
1. Get the player to pos33 (below the stone)
2. Push the stone up from pos23 to pos13
3. Push the stone up from pos13 to pos12 (goal)

But we also need to satisfy the constraints. The player must be at pos24 at some point, and when that happens, the stone must be at pos44 or reach pos44 later.

The stone is initially at pos23. If we want to push it to pos44, we'd need to push it right and down. This means:
1. Player needs to be at pos13 (above the stone)
2. Push the stone down from pos23 to pos33
3. Push the stone down from pos33 to pos43
4. Push the stone right from pos43 to pos44

After the stone is at pos44, we'd need to bring it back to pos12 (the goal). That would mean:
1. Push the stone left from pos44 to pos43
2. Push the stone left from pos43 to pos42
3. Push the stone up from pos42 to pos32
4. Push the stone up from pos32 to pos22
5. Push the stone left from pos22 to pos21
6. Push the stone up from pos21 to pos11
7. Push the stone right from pos11 to pos12 (goal)

But it seems like a detour to move the stone to pos44. Let's consider a more direct approach while satisfying the constraints.

Let's think about it differently. The constraints don't say the stone has to be pushed to pos44, just that at or after the player is at pos24, the stone should be at pos44. 

So, we could:
1. Push the stone to pos44 first
2. Then have the player move to pos24
3. Then push the stone to the goal at pos12

Let me re-plan:

From the initial state:
- Player at pos51
- Stone at pos23

Let's push the stone to pos44:
1. Player moves from pos51 to pos41
2. Player moves from pos41 to pos31
3. Player moves from pos31 to pos32
4. Player moves from pos32 to pos33
5. Player moves from pos33 to pos23 (player now adjacent to stone from below)
6. Player pushes stone from pos23 to pos24
7. Player pushes stone from pos24 to pos34
8. Player pushes stone from pos34 to pos44

Now, the stone is at pos44. 

To satisfy the first constraint, the player needs to be at pos24. After pushing the stone to pos44, the player is at pos34. So:
9. Player moves from pos34 to pos24 (constraint 1 satisfied, and constraint 2 is also satisfied since the stone is at pos44)

Now, let's move the stone to the goal:
10. Player moves from pos24 to pos34
11. Player moves from pos34 to pos44 (player now adjacent to stone from above)
12. Player pushes stone from pos44 to pos43
13. Player pushes stone from pos43 to pos33
14. Player pushes stone from pos33 to pos23
15. Player pushes stone from pos23 to pos13
16. Player pushes stone from pos13 to pos12 (goal reached)

Let's double-check this plan against the domain's action definitions:

The move action is straightforward: the player moves from one position to an adjacent position.

For pushing the stone, there are two different actions: pushtogoal and pushtonongoal. We need to use pushtogoal when pushing to a goal location (pos12 in this case) and pushtonongoal for all other locations.

So, for the pushing actions in my plan:
6. Player pushes stone from pos23 to pos24 using pushtonongoal
7. Player pushes stone from pos24 to pos34 using pushtonongoal
8. Player pushes stone from pos34 to pos44 using pushtonongoal
12. Player pushes stone from pos44 to pos43 using pushtonongoal
13. Player pushes stone from pos43 to pos33 using pushtonongoal
14. Player pushes stone from pos33 to pos23 using pushtonongoal
15. Player pushes stone from pos23 to pos13 using pushtonongoal
16. Player pushes stone from pos13 to pos12 using pushtogoal

Wait, I need to be more careful with the push actions, making sure the player is in the right position for each push.

Let's revise the plan:

From the initial state:
- Player at pos51
- Stone at pos23

1. Player moves from pos51 to pos41
2. Player moves from pos41 to pos31
3. Player moves from pos31 to pos32
4. Player moves from pos32 to pos33 (player is now below the stone)
5. Use pushtonongoal to push the stone from pos23 to pos13 (player is at pos33, stone moved up)
6. Player moves from pos33 to pos23 (player is now below where the stone was)
7. Player moves from pos23 to pos24 (player moves to pos24 to satisfy constraint 1)
8. Player moves from pos24 to pos14 (player is now below where the stone is)

Actually, I need to reconsider this plan. The constraints are:
1. The player must be at pos24 at some point
2. If the player is at pos24, then at that state or a later state, stone1 must be at pos44

This means the stone must be at pos44 either when the player is at pos24 or at some state after the player has been at pos24.

Let's try a different approach:

From the initial state:
- Player at pos51
- Stone at pos23

1. Player moves from pos51 to pos41
2. Player moves from pos41 to pos31
3. Player moves from pos31 to pos32
4. Player moves from pos32 to pos33 (player is now below the stone)
5. Use pushtonongoal to push the stone from pos23 to pos13 (player is at pos33, stone moved up)
6. Player moves from pos33 to pos23 (player is now below where the stone was)
7. Player moves from pos23 to pos24 (player moves to pos24 to satisfy constraint 1)

Now, the player is at pos24 (satisfying constraint 1). We need to ensure the stone reaches pos44 at some point after this.

8. Player moves from pos24 to pos34
9. Player moves from pos34 to pos35
10. Player moves from pos35 to pos25
11. Player moves from pos25 to pos15
12. Player moves from pos15 to pos14 (player is now below the stone)
13. Use pushtonongoal to push the stone from pos13 to pos23 (player is at pos14, stone moved down)
14. Use pushtonongoal to push the stone from pos23 to pos33 (player is at pos23, stone moved down)
15. Use pushtonongoal to push the stone from pos33 to pos43 (player is at pos33, stone moved down)
16. Use pushtonongoal to push the stone from pos43 to pos44 (player is at pos43, stone moved right)

Now, the stone is at pos44 (satisfying constraint 2). Next, we need to move the stone to the goal at pos12.

17. Player moves from pos43 to pos33
18. Player moves from pos33 to pos23
19. Player moves from pos23 to pos24
20. Player moves from pos24 to pos34
21. Player moves from pos34 to pos44 (player is now above the stone)
22. Use pushtonongoal to push the stone from pos44 to pos43 (player is at pos44, stone moved left)
23. Use pushtonongoal to push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (player is at pos43, stone moved up)
24. Use pushtonongoal to push the stone from pos33 to pos23 (player is at pos33, stone moved up)
25. Use pushtonongoal to push the stone from pos23 to pos13 (player is at pos23, stone moved up)
26. Use pushtogoal to push the stone from pos13 to pos12 (player is at pos13, stone moved left to goal)

Let me check if this plan satisfies all the constraints:

- In step 7, the player is at pos24, satisfying constraint 1.
- In step 16, the stone reaches pos44 after the player has been at pos24, satisfying constraint 2.
- In step 26, the stone reaches the goal at pos12, satisfying the main objective.

Wait, actually, I need to be precise about the action arguments. Let me spell out the full actions:

```
move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft
move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown
move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup
move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
move player1 pos24 pos34 dirdown
move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown
move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft
move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft
move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos23 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos44 dirright
move player1 pos43 pos33 dirup
move player1 pos33 pos23 dirup
move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
move player1 pos24 pos34 dirdown
move player1 pos34 pos44 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos44 pos43 dirleft
```

Wait, I made an error. In the pushtogoal and pushtonongoal actions, the player must be adjacent to the stone in the correct direction. Let me revise the actions.

Actually, looking at these lines, I realized there must be a mistake there:

1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup
2. ... (later)
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos23 dirdown
4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirdown

In the first line, I had the player at pos33 pushing the stone from pos23 to pos13 in the direction dirup. This is correct: the player is below the stone and pushes it up.

But in the third line, I have the player at pos14 pushing the stone from pos13 to pos23 in the direction dirdown. This doesn't match the action's description because the player at pos14 is to the right of pos13, not above it.

Let me reconsider the plan, being more careful with the action specifications.

From the initial state:
- Player at pos51
- Stone at pos23

1. move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft
2. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
3. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown
4. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup
   (Player is at pos33, stone is at pos23, pushing to pos13 in direction dirup)
6. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
   (Player is now at pos13 after the push, moving to pos14)
7. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
   (Player moves to pos24 to satisfy constraint 1)

Hmm, actually, I need to double-check the effects of the push actions. When a player pushes a stone, the player moves into the position the stone was in. So in step 5, after pushing the stone from pos23 to pos13, the player would end up at pos23, not pos13. Let me revise again.

From the initial state:
- Player at pos51
- Stone at pos23

1. move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft
2. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
3. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown
4. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup
   (Player is at pos33, stone is at pos23, pushing to pos13 in direction dirup)
   (After the push, player is at pos23, stone is at pos13)
6. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
   (Player moves to pos24 to satisfy constraint 1)

OK, I made another error; I mentioned the wrong effect of the push action. Let's look at the effects again:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": After performing this action, 
(i) agent p is no longer at location l_p, 
(ii) stone s is no longer at location l_from, 
(iii) location l_to is no longer clear, 
(iv) agent p is at location l_from, 
(v) stone s is at location l_to, 
(vi) location l_p is clear, and 
(vi) stone s is at a goal state.

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": After performing this action, 
(i) agent p is no longer at location l_p, 
(ii) stone s is no longer at location l_from, 
(iii) location l_to is no longer clear, 
(iv) agent p is at location l_from, 
(v) stone s is at location l_to, 
(vi) location l_p is clear, and 
(vi) stone s is at a non goal state.

So, if the player is at location l_p and pushes the stone from location l_from to location l_to, after the push, the player will be at location l_from (where the stone was) and the stone will be at location l_to. This confirms what I just realized.

Let's revise the plan again from the start:

From the initial state:
- Player at pos51
- Stone at pos23

1. move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft
2. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
3. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown
4. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup
   (Player is at pos33, stone is at pos23, pushing to pos13 in direction dirup)
   (After the push, player is at pos23, stone is at pos13)
6. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
   (Player moves to pos24 to satisfy constraint 1)

Now, the player is at pos24 (satisfying constraint 1). We need to ensure the stone reaches pos44 at some point after this.

7. move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown
8. move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft
9. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
10. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos13 pos23 dirdown
    (Player is at pos13, stone is also at pos13, pushing to pos23 in direction dirdown)

Wait, I made another mistake. After the push in step 5, the stone is at pos13 and the player is at pos23. Then, in step 6, the player moves to pos24. The stone and the player are no longer adjacent. So, I can't push the stone in step 11 the way I described.

I need to reconsider how to get the player adjacent to the stone for the next push.

let's try a different approach. When the player pushes the stone from pos23 to pos13, the player ends up at pos23. Then, we want the player to be at pos24 at some point. After that, we need to make sure the stone is at pos44 at some point.

Let's see:

From the initial state:
- Player at pos51
- Stone at pos23

1. move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft
2. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
3. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown
4. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup
   (Player is at pos33, stone is at pos23, pushing to pos13 in direction dirup)
   (After the push, player is at pos23, stone is at pos13)
6. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
   (Player moves to pos24 to satisfy constraint 1)

So far, so good. Now, we need to get the player in a position to push the stone towards pos44.

7. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft
   (Player moves to pos14, which is to the right of pos13 where the stone is)
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirleft
   (Player is at pos14, stone is at pos13, pushing to pos12 in direction dirleft)
   (After the push, player is at pos13, stone is at pos12 - the goal)

Wait, I just pushed the stone to the goal. Let me check if I've satisfied all the constraints:

1. In step 6, the player is at pos24, satisfying constraint 1.
2. The stone ends up at the goal (pos12), satisfying the main objective.

But what about the second constraint? We need the stone to be at pos44 at some point after the player has been at pos24. This isn't satisfied in the plan I just outlined.

Let's try again from the beginning, with a focus on satisfying all constraints:

From the initial state:
- Player at pos51
- Stone at pos23

1. move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft
2. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
3. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown
4. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup
   (Player is at pos33, stone is at pos23, pushing to pos13 in direction dirup)
   (After the push, player is at pos23, stone is at pos13)
6. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
   (Player moves to pos24 to satisfy constraint 1)

Now, we need to navigate to get the stone to pos44 and then eventually to the goal.

7. move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown
8. move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft
9. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos23 dirdown
    (Player is at pos14, stone is at pos13, pushing to pos23 in direction dirdown)
    (After the push, player is at pos13, stone is at pos23)
11. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirdown
    (Player moves to pos23, which is above where the stone is)
12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos23 pos33 dirdown
    (Player is at pos23, stone is also at pos23, pushing to pos33 in direction dirdown)

Wait, this doesn't make sense. The stone and the player can't be at the same location. I need to be more careful with tracking the positions after each action.

Let me redraw the board to make sure I'm clear on the positions:

```
pos11 pos12(G) pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22    pos23* pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32    pos33  pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42    pos43  pos44 pos45
pos51*pos52    pos53  pos54 pos55
```

From the initial state (player at pos51, stone at pos23), after the steps:
1. move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft (player now at pos41)
2. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft (player now at pos31)
3. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown (player now at pos32)
4. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown (player now at pos33)
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup (player now at pos23, stone now at pos13)

The grid now looks like:

```
pos11 pos12(G) pos13* pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22    pos23# pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32    pos33  pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42    pos43  pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52    pos53  pos54 pos55
```

where # denotes the player and * denotes the stone.

6. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown (player now at pos24, stone still at pos13)

The grid now looks like:

```
pos11 pos12(G) pos13* pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22    pos23  pos24# pos25
pos31 pos32    pos33  pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42    pos43  pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52    pos53  pos54 pos55
```

where # denotes the player and * denotes the stone.

Now, the player is at pos24, which satisfies constraint 1. Next, we need to ensure the stone reaches pos44 at some point after this.

To push the stone to pos44, we first need to get the player adjacent to the stone. The stone is at pos13, so the player needs to be at pos14 (below the stone) to push it down.

7. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft (player now at pos14, stone still at pos13)

The grid now looks like:

```
pos11 pos12(G) pos13* pos14# pos15
pos21 pos22    pos23  pos24  pos25
pos31 pos32    pos33  pos34  pos35
pos41 pos42    pos43  pos44  pos45
pos51 pos52    pos53  pos54  pos55
```

8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos23 dirdown (player now at pos13, stone now at pos23)

The grid now looks like:

```
pos11 pos12(G) pos13# pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22    pos23* pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32    pos33  pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42    pos43  pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52    pos53  pos54 pos55
```

9. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirdown (player now at pos23, stone still at pos23)

Wait, that's not correct. The player and stone can't occupy the same space.

Let's go back to step 8:

8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos23 dirdown (player now at pos13, stone now at pos23)

The grid now looks like:

```
pos11 pos12(G) pos13# pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22    pos23* pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32    pos33  pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42    pos43  pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52    pos53  pos54 pos55
```

To continue pushing the stone towards pos44, the player needs to be below the stone. So, the player needs to get to pos33.

9. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
10. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirdown
11. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirdown
12. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirleft

Now, the grid looks like:

```
pos11 pos12(G) pos13  pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22    pos23* pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32    pos33# pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42    pos43  pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52    pos53  pos54 pos55
```

13. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos33 dirdown (player now at pos23, stone now at pos33)

The grid now looks like:

```
pos11 pos12(G) pos13  pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22    pos23# pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32    pos33* pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42    pos43  pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52    pos53  pos54 pos55
```

To continue pushing the stone towards pos44, the player needs to be above the stone. So, from pos23, the player moves to pos33.

14. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirdown (player now at pos33, stone still at pos33)

But the player and stone can't occupy the same space. Did I mix up the positions again?

Let's go back to step 13:

13. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos33 dirdown (player now at pos23, stone now at pos33)

Actually, this action description seems wrong. According to the action specification, the form is "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d". This means:
- Player is at l_p
- Stone is at l_from
- Stone is being pushed to l_to
- Push direction is d

For the situation described in step 13, it should be:
13. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos33 dirdown

But this doesn't make sense because l_to and l_p are the same, which would mean the stone ends up where the player was, which is not allowed.

Let me redraw the grid again to make sure I'm tracking positions correctly:

After step 12, the grid looks like:

```
pos11 pos12(G) pos13  pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22    pos23* pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32    pos33# pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42    pos43  pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52    pos53  pos54 pos55
```

The player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos23.

Now, to push the stone from pos23 to pos33, the player needs to be at a position such that it's adjacent to pos23 and in the direction opposite to where we want the stone to go. If we want to push the stone down from pos23 to pos33, the player needs to be at the position above pos23, which would be pos13.

But the player is currently at pos33, which is below pos23. So, in this configuration, the player can't push the stone from pos23 to pos33.

Let's rethink the approach.

The player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos23. From this position, the player can only push the stone up (to pos13), left (to pos22), or right (to pos24), but not down (to pos33).

Let's revise the plan again:

From the start position (player at pos51, stone at pos23):

1. move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft
2. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
3. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown
4. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown (player now at pos33, stone at pos23)

From here, we can push the stone to pos24 (to the right):

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos24 dirright (player now at pos23, stone at pos24)

Now, the player is at pos23 and the stone is at pos24. The player can move to pos24 to satisfy constraint 1, but then the player and stone would be in the same position, which is not allowed.

Let's try pushing the stone up to pos13 first:

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup (player now at pos23, stone at pos13)
6. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown (player now at pos24, stone at pos13 - constraint 1 satisfied)

Now, we need to get the stone to pos44. The stone is at pos13. To move it to pos44, we'd need to push it down several times.

7. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft (player now at pos14, stone at pos13)
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos23 dirdown (player now at pos13, stone at pos23)
9. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirdown (player and stone both at pos23 - not allowed)

Actually, I need to be more careful with the effects of the push actions. When a player pushes a stone, the player takes the position where the stone was, and the stone moves to the adjacent position in the direction of the push.

Let's re-examine the effects:

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": After performing this action, 
(iv) agent p is at location l_from, 
(v) stone s is at location l_to

So, after pushing the stone from l_from to l_to, the player is at l_from (where the stone was) and the stone is at l_to.

Going back to step 8, after pushing the stone from pos13 to pos23, the player is at pos13 and the stone is at pos23.

Let's revise the plan again, being more careful with the positions after each action:

From the start position (player at pos51, stone at pos23):

1. move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft (player now at pos41)
2. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft (player now at pos31)
3. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown (player now at pos32)
4. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown (player now at pos33, stone at pos23)
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup (player now at pos23, stone at pos13)
6. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown (player now at pos24, stone at pos13 - constraint 1 satisfied)
7. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft (player now at pos14, stone at pos13)
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos23 dirdown (player now at pos13, stone at pos23)

The grid now looks like:

```
pos11 pos12(G) pos13# pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22    pos23* pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32    pos33  pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42    pos43  pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52    pos53  pos54 pos55
```

To push the stone from pos23 to pos33, the player needs to be at pos13 (which the player is) and push the stone down.

9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirdown (player now at pos23, stone at pos33)

The grid now looks like:

```
pos11 pos12(G) pos13  pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22    pos23# pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32    pos33* pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42    pos43  pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52    pos53  pos54 pos55
```

To push the stone from pos33 to pos43, the player needs to be at pos23 (which the player is) and push the stone down.

10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirdown (player now at pos33, stone at pos43)

The grid now looks like:

```
pos11 pos12(G) pos13  pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22    pos23  pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32    pos33# pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42    pos43* pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52    pos53  pos54 pos55
```

To push the stone from pos43 to pos44, the player needs to be at pos33 (which the player is) and push the stone to the right.

11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos44 dirright (player now at pos43, stone at pos44)

The grid now looks like:

```
pos11 pos12(G) pos13  pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22    pos23  pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32    pos33  pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42    pos43# pos44* pos45
pos51 pos52    pos53  pos54 pos55
```

Great! Now the stone is at pos44, satisfying constraint 2. We now need to get the stone to the goal at pos12.

To move the stone from pos44 to pos12, we need to:
1. Push it left (to pos43)
2. Push it up (to pos33)
3. Push it up (to pos23)
4. Push it up (to pos13)
5. Push it left (to pos12)

Let's continue with the plan:

12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos43 dirleft (player now at pos44, stone at pos43)

The grid now looks like:

```
pos11 pos12(G) pos13  pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22    pos23  pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32    pos33  pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42    pos43* pos44# pos45
pos51 pos52    pos53  pos54 pos55
```

13. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos33 dirup (player now at pos43, stone at pos33)

The grid now looks like:

```
pos11 pos12(G) pos13  pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22    pos23  pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32    pos33* pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42    pos43# pos44  pos45
pos51 pos52    pos53  pos54 pos55
```

14. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirup (player now at pos33, stone at pos23)

The grid now looks like:

```
pos11 pos12(G) pos13  pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22    pos23* pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32    pos33# pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42    pos43  pos44  pos45
pos51 pos52    pos53  pos54 pos55
```

15. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup (player now at pos23, stone at pos13)

The grid now looks like:

```
pos11 pos12(G) pos13* pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22    pos23# pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32    pos33  pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42    pos43  pos44  pos45
pos51 pos52    pos53  pos54 pos55
```

16. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos13 pos12 dirleft (player now at pos13, stone at pos12)

The grid now looks like:

```
pos11 pos12*   pos13# pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22    pos23  pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32    pos33  pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42    pos43  pos44  pos45
pos51 pos52    pos53  pos54 pos55
```

Great! Now the stone is at the goal position (pos12). Let's review the plan to ensure it satisfies all constraints:

1. In step 6, the player is at pos24, satisfying constraint 1.
2. In step 11, the stone is at pos44 after the player has been at pos24, satisfying constraint 2.
3. In step 16, the stone is at the goal (pos12), satisfying the main objective.

The plan looks valid! Let me specify the complete action sequence with the correct syntax:

1. move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft
2. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
3. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown
4. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup
6. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
7. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos23 dirdown
9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirdown
10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirdown
11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos44 dirright
12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos43 dirleft
13. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos33 dirup
14. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirup
15. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup
16. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos13 pos12 dirleft
