This problem is about a Sokoban-like puzzle. We need to move the agent (player1) to push the stone (stone1) to a goal location. Let's break down the initial state and the goal:

Initial state:
- player1 is at pos51 (bottom-left corner of the grid)
- stone1 is at pos23
- pos12 is the only goal location

Goal:
- stone1 is at a goal location (i.e., pos12)

Let's visualize the 5x5 grid to better understand the problem:

```
11 12* 13 14 15
21 22 23S 24 25
31 32 33 34 35
41 42 43 44 45
51P 52 53 54 55
```

Where:
- P represents player1's initial position (pos51)
- S represents stone1's initial position (pos23)
- * represents the goal location (pos12)

Now, let's think about how to solve this problem. We need to:
1. Move player1 to a position adjacent to stone1 (pos23) in a way that allows pushing the stone toward the goal (pos12).
2. Push the stone to the goal location (pos12).

Let's think through the plan step by step:

1. First, the player needs to move from pos51 to a position adjacent to stone1 (pos23). The player could reach pos33 to push the stone left (toward pos13), or pos22 to push the stone up (toward pos13).

2. The stone needs to be pushed to pos12. The most direct path would be: pos23 -> pos22 -> pos12. However, the player may need to adjust positions to ensure proper pushing direction.

Let's create a plan:

1. First, the player moves from pos51 to pos41 (moving left from their initial position).
2. Then, the player continues moving from pos41 to pos31 (moving left).
3. Then from pos31 to pos32 (moving down).
4. From pos32 to pos33 (moving down).
5. Now the player is at pos33, and the stone is at pos23 (to the left of the player). The player can push the stone to the left to pos13.
6. From pos13, the player needs to move to a position that allows pushing the stone up to pos12.

Wait, I need to rethink this. If the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos23, the player would need to push the stone to the left, but that would be toward pos22, not pos13. Let me reconsider the grid and directions.

Actually, looking at the list of allowed moves, dirright means moving to a location with a higher first digit (e.g., from pos11 to pos21), dirdown means moving to a location with a higher second digit (e.g., from pos11 to pos12), dirleft and dirup are the opposites.

So the grid is actually:

```
11 21 31 41 51
12* 22 32 42 52
13 23S 33 43 53
14 24 34 44 54
15 25 35 45 55
```

Where:
- P represents player1's initial position (pos51)
- S represents stone1's initial position (pos23)
- * represents the goal location (pos12)

Now, let's think through this again:

1. The player is at pos51, and the stone is at pos23.
2. To push the stone to the goal (pos12), the player needs to be able to push it from pos23 to pos22, and then from pos22 to pos12.
3. This means the player first needs to get to pos33 to push the stone from pos23 to pos22 (pushing in the dirup direction). Then, the player needs to get to pos32 to push the stone from pos22 to pos12 (pushing in the dirup direction again).

Let's create a plan:

1. First, the player moves from pos51 to pos41 (moving in the dirleft direction).
2. Then, the player continues moving from pos41 to pos31 (moving in the dirleft direction).
3. Then from pos31 to pos32 (moving in the dirdown direction).
4. From pos32 to pos33 (moving in the dirdown direction).
5. Now the player is at pos33, and the stone is at pos23 (to the left of the player). The player can push the stone from pos23 to pos22 (pushing in the dirup direction).
6. After the push, the player is at pos23, and the stone is at pos22. The player needs to move from pos23 to pos32 to be able to push the stone from pos22 to pos12.
7. The player moves from pos23 to pos33 (moving in the dirright direction).
8. The player moves from pos33 to pos32 (moving in the dirup direction).
9. Now the player is at pos32, and the stone is at pos22 (to the left of the player). The player can push the stone from pos22 to pos12 (pushing in the dirup direction).

Hmm, but this doesn't seem right either. Let's try to reinterpret the grid again.

Actually, I think the grid is more like:

```
11 12 13 14 15
21 22 23 24 25
31 32 33 34 35
41 42 43 44 45
51 52 53 54 55
```

Where:
- The player is at pos51 (bottom-left corner)
- The stone is at pos23 (middle of the top half)
- The goal is at pos12 (near the top-left corner)

For dirdown, dirright, dirup, dirleft to make sense, the directions are relative to the grid. So dirdown means moving down in the grid (increasing the first digit), dirright means moving right in the grid (increasing the second digit), and so on.

Let's verify my understanding by looking at some allowed moves in the problem:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

OK, so dirright increases the first digit (moving down from the top), and dirdown increases the second digit (moving right from the left). This means the grid is:

```
11 12* 13 14 15
21 22 23S 24 25
31 32 33 34 35
41 42 43 44 45
51P 52 53 54 55
```

Where the top-left is pos11, and the bottom-right is pos55. The player is at the bottom-left (pos51), the stone is in the middle-right of the top half (pos23), and the goal is near the top-left (pos12).

Now let's think about how to solve this problem:

1. The player is at pos51, and the stone is at pos23.
2. To push the stone to the goal (pos12), the player needs to be able to push it from pos23 to pos22, and then from pos22 to pos12.
3. This means the player first needs to get to pos24 to push the stone from pos23 to pos22 (pushing in the dirleft direction). Then, the player needs to get to pos13 to push the stone from pos22 to pos12 (pushing in the dirleft direction again).

Let's create a plan:

1. The player moves from pos51 to pos41 (moving dirleft).
2. The player moves from pos41 to pos31 (moving dirleft).
3. The player moves from pos31 to pos32 (moving dirdown).
4. The player moves from pos32 to pos33 (moving dirdown).
5. The player moves from pos33 to pos34 (moving dirdown).
6. The player moves from pos34 to pos24 (moving dirleft).
7. The player pushes the stone from pos23 to pos22 using pushtonongoal (since pos22 is not a goal location).
8. After the push, the player is at pos23, and the stone is at pos22. The player needs to move to pos13 to push the stone from pos22 to pos12.
9. The player moves from pos23 to pos13 (moving dirleft).
10. The player pushes the stone from pos22 to pos12 using pushtogoal (since pos12 is a goal location).

Now let's detail this plan in the required format:

```
move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft
move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown
move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirleft
move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos22 pos12 dirleft
```

However, there's an issue. After the player pushes the stone from pos23 to pos22, the player is at pos23, and the stone is at pos22. To push the stone from pos22 to pos12, the player should be at pos22's adjacent position in the direction opposite to the push. Since the player wants to push the stone from pos22 to pos12 (dirleft), the player should be at pos32 (i.e., to the right of pos22).

Let's correct the plan:

1. The player moves from pos51 to pos41 (moving dirleft).
2. The player moves from pos41 to pos31 (moving dirleft).
3. The player moves from pos31 to pos32 (moving dirdown).
4. The player moves from pos32 to pos33 (moving dirdown).
5. The player moves from pos33 to pos34 (moving dirdown).
6. The player moves from pos34 to pos24 (moving dirleft).
7. The player pushes the stone from pos23 to pos22 using pushtonongoal (since pos22 is not a goal location).
8. After the push, the player is at pos23, and the stone is at pos22. The player needs to move to pos32 to push the stone from pos22 to pos12.
9. The player moves from pos23 to pos33 (moving dirdown).
10. The player moves from pos33 to pos32 (moving dirup).
11. The player pushes the stone from pos22 to pos12 using pushtogoal (since pos12 is a goal location).

But wait, there's another confusion. Position names like "pos23" are given, but it's unclear what format they're in. Let's check using the allowed move:
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright."

So, from pos11 to pos21 is dirright. This suggests that the first digit (1 -> 2) increases when moving right, and by analogy, the second digit likely increases when moving down.

But then I see:
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown."

So, from pos11 to pos12 is dirdown. This suggests that the second digit (1 -> 2) increases when moving down.

This means pos11 is the top-left, and the grid is more like:

```
11 21 31 41 51
12*22 32 42 52
13 23S33 43 53
14 24 34 44 54
15 25 35 45 55
```

Where the player (P) is at the rightmost side (pos51), the stone (S) is in the middle (pos23), and the goal (*) is near the left side (pos12).

Let's now think through this plan again:

1. The player moves from pos51 to pos41 (moving dirleft).
2. The player moves from pos41 to pos31 (moving dirleft).
3. The player moves from pos31 to pos32 (moving dirdown).
4. The player moves from pos32 to pos33 (moving dirdown).
5. The player moves from pos33 to pos23 (moving dirleft).
6. The player is now at pos23, and the stone is also at pos23. This is a contradiction, as two objects can't be at the same place. Something's wrong.

Let me revisit the statements "player1 is at location pos51" and "stone1 is at location pos23". These should be the accurate positions. Let's also look at the list of clear locations to further verify.

From the statements like "Location pos23 is clear" and "Location pos51 is clear", it seems like both the player and the stone are not correctly positioned in my understanding.

Let's try a different interpretation. In the grid, the first digit might represent the row (from top to bottom), and the second digit might represent the column (from left to right):

```
11 12 13 14 15
21 22 23 24 25
31 32 33 34 35
41 42 43 44 45
51 52 53 54 55
```

And based on the statements:
- player1 is at location pos51 (bottom-left corner)
- stone1 is at location pos23 (2nd row, 3rd column)
- Location pos23 is clear (wait, this contradicts stone1 being at pos23)
- Location pos51 is clear (this contradicts player1 being at pos51)

Hmm, there seems to be a contradiction here. Let me read the list of clear locations more carefully... Ah, wait actually it says "Location pos23 is clear" and "Location pos51 is clear" at the end of the statements, which matches with our understanding of the grid structure. These are actually statements of clearing the two positions after setting the player and stone. So the statements don't contradict, rather, they update our state to ensure there are no contradictions.

OK, so the grid looks like:

```
11 12* 13 14 15
21 22 23 24 25
31 32 33 34 35
41 42 43 44 45
51P 52 53 54 55
```

Where P is player1 at pos51, * is the goal location at pos12, and S is stone1 at pos23. Actually, there's a problem. The stone should be at pos23, but there's a statement indicating that pos23 is clear. Let's interpret the problem statement again.

I now see that, initially, the player1 is at pos51 and stone1 is at pos23. However, at the end of the list, there are statements saying "Location pos23 is clear" and "Location pos51 is clear". These seem to be in direct contradiction to the earlier statements. I think the later statements are indicating a clear/re-initialization of these locations.

In the initial state, we have:
- player1 is at location pos51
- stone1 is at location pos23

These should be the correct initial positions. The later statements about these locations being clear might be contradictions from how the domain is defined, but they don't change the initial positions as given.

Since there's some ambiguity, let's try to further clarify things by looking at the action preconditions and effects. And indeed, in the effects of the "move" action, the location from which the agent moves becomes clear, and the location to which the agent moves is no longer clear. And in the preconditions, the location to which the agent moves should be clear. I can see that Location pos51 is not listed as clear in the initial state. Similarly for stone1 at pos23, which isn't listed as clear initially. Instead, they are explicitly mentioned at the end of the description of the initial state. And given the intended problem structure, it makes sense for them to set up necessary preconditions.

Let's continue with the plan I was developing:

1. The player moves from pos51 to pos41 (moving dirleft)
2. The player moves from pos41 to pos31 (moving dirleft)
3. The player moves from pos31 to pos21 (moving dirleft)
4. The player moves from pos21 to pos22 (moving dirdown)
5. Now, the player is at pos22, and the stone is at pos23 (to the right of the player). To push the stone from pos23 to pos13 (pushing dirleft), the player needs to be at pos33.
6. The player moves from pos22 to pos32 (moving dirright)
7. The player moves from pos32 to pos33 (moving dirdown)
8. Now the player is at pos33, and the stone is at pos23 (to the left of the player). The player can push the stone from pos23 to pos13 (pushing dirleft).
9. After the push, the player is at pos23, and the stone is at pos13. The player needs to move to pos12 to push the stone from pos13 to pos12.
10. The player moves from pos23 to pos22 (moving dirup)
11. The player moves from pos22 to pos12 (moving dirleft)
12. Now the player is at pos12, and the stone is at pos13 (to the right of the player). The player can push the stone from pos13 to pos12 (pushing dirleft).

Hmm, but wait, I'm confused about the direction still. If dirdown means moving down in the grid (increasing row) and dirright means moving right in the grid (increasing column), then something's off here.

Actually in the problem statement it says dirdown means moving from pos11 to pos12, so that's increasing the column (moving to the right). And dirright means moving from pos11 to pos21, so that's increasing the row (moving down). The grid looks like:

```
11 12 13 14 15
21 22 23 24 25
31 32 33 34 35
41 42 43 44 45
51 52 53 54 55
```

Where pos11 is the top-left, pos15 is the top-right, pos51 is the bottom-left, and pos55 is the bottom-right. In this grid, dirright means moving down (increasing row), and dirdown means moving right (increasing column).

Let's redo the plan, with these directions properly interpreted:

1. The player moves from pos51 to pos41 (moving dirup, which is moving upwards in the grid, decreasing row)
2. The player moves from pos41 to pos31 (moving dirup)
3. The player moves from pos31 to pos21 (moving dirup)
4. The player moves from pos21 to pos22 (moving dirdown, which is moving right in the grid, increasing column)
5. Now, the player is at pos22 (2nd row, 2nd column), and the stone is at pos23 (2nd row, 3rd column). To push the stone from pos23 to pos13 (pushing dirup, or upwards in the grid, decreasing row), the player needs to be at pos33.
6. Wait, this doesn't seem right. If the player is at pos22 and the stone is at pos23, the player should be able to push the stone from pos23 to pos13. But for that, the player needs to be at pos23's bottom adjacent position, which would be pos33. But the player is at pos22, which is to the left of pos23, not below it.

Let me rethink this. I think we need to be more careful about what the directions mean in the actions of pushing. For the "pushtogoal" and "pushtonongoal" actions, the direction indicates the direction of the push, not the direction of movement.

For instance, if we want to push a stone from, say, position A to position B, and the player is at position C, then the direction is the direction from A to B. The player's position C should be in the exact opposite direction from A with respect to this direction.

For example, if the stone is at pos23 and we want to push it to pos13 (upwards, or decreasing row), then the player should be below the stone (i.e. at pos33).

Let's think step by step:

Position of stone: pos23
Goal position: pos12
Route from stone position to goal position: stone at pos23 -> pos13 -> pos12
Direction of push: first dirup, then dirleft

For the first push (pos23 -> pos13), the player must be at pos33 (as the push direction is dirup, the player should be in the exact opposite direction, which is dirdown from the stone).

For the second push (pos13 -> pos12), the player must be at pos14 (as the push direction is dirleft, the player should be in the exact opposite direction, which is dirright from the stone).

Let me revise the plan accordingly:

1. Player from pos51 to pos41 (moving dirup)
2. Player from pos41 to pos31 (moving dirup)
3. Player from pos31 to pos32 (moving dirdown)
4. Player from pos32 to pos33 (moving dirdown)
5. Now the player is at pos33, and the stone is at pos23 (above the player). The player can push the stone from pos23 to pos13 using the pusthonongoal action (direction dirup).
6. After the push, the player is at pos23, and the stone is at pos13. The player needs to move to pos14 to push the stone from pos13 to pos12 (direction dirleft).
7. Player from pos23 to pos24 (moving dirdown)
8. Player from pos24 to pos14 (moving dirup)
9. Now the player is at pos14, and the stone is at pos13 (to the left of the player). The player can push the stone from pos13 to pos12 using the pushtogoal action (direction dirleft).

Let me once again verify the directions. The directions dirright, dirup, dirleft, didown seem to be oriented as expected in a grid. If pos11 is the top-left, then:
- dirright would move from pos11 to pos21 (increase row)
- dirdown would move from pos11 to pos12 (increase column)
- dirleft would move from pos21 to pos11 (decrease row)
- dirup would move from pos12 to pos11 (decrease column)

OK that's consistent with what I have. So updating our plan:

```
move player1 pos51 pos41 dirup
move player1 pos41 pos31 dirup
move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown
move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup
move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
move player1 pos24 pos14 dirup
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirleft
```

Looking again, are we supposed to be using pushtogoal or pushtonongoal?
According to the problem:
- "pushtogoal" is used when the stone is pushed to a goal location.
- "pushtonongoal" is used when the stone is pushed to a non-goal location.

pos12 is a goal location, so we use pushtogoal when moving the stone from pos13 to pos12.
pos13 is not a goal location, so we use pushtonongoal when moving the stone from pos23 to pos13.

So the revised plan is:

```
move player1 pos51 pos41 dirup
move player1 pos41 pos31 dirup
move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown
move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup
move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
move player1 pos24 pos14 dirup
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirleft
```

I am confident this plan achieves the goal of pushing stone1 to a goal location (pos12).

Let's double check the plan:

1. move player1 pos51 pos41 dirup - Player moves from pos51 to pos41 (upward).
2. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirup - Player moves from pos41 to pos31 (upward).
3. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown - Player moves from pos31 to pos32 (rightward).
4. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown - Player moves from pos32 to pos33 (rightward).
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup - Player pushes stone1 from pos23 to pos13 (upward). Player is now at pos23, stone1 is at pos13.
6. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown - Player moves from pos23 to pos24 (rightward).
7. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirup - Player moves from pos24 to pos14 (upward).
8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirleft - Player pushes stone1 from pos13 to pos12 (leftward). Stone1 is now at a goal location (pos12).

For this step, there's a bit more detail:
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup - Player pushes stone1 from pos23 to pos13 (upward). Player is now at pos23, stone1 is at pos13.

The action has arguments: player, stone, player_starting_position, stone_starting_position, stone_target_position, direction.
The player is at position pos33, the stone is at pos23, and we want to move it to position pos13 (upwards).

Let's verify the preconditions:
(i) agent p is at location l_p: player1 is at pos33
(ii) stone s is at location l_from: stone1 is at pos23
(iii) location l_to is clear: pos13 is clear
(iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d: you can move from pos33 to pos23 following direction dirup
(v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d: you can move from pos23 to pos13 following direction dirup
(vi) location l_to is not a goal location: pos13 is not a goal location

Since all the preconditions are met, the action can be performed.

Similarly, the preconditions for the step:
8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirleft

The player is at position pos14, the stone is at pos13, and we want to move it to position pos12 (leftwards).

Let's verify the preconditions:
(i) agent p is at location l_p: player1 is at pos14
(ii) stone s is at location l_from: stone1 is at pos13
(iii) location l_to is clear: pos12 is clear
(iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d: you can move from pos14 to pos13 following direction dirleft
(v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d: you can move from pos13 to pos12 following direction dirleft
(vi) location l_to is a goal location: pos12 is a goal location

Since all the preconditions are met, the action can be performed. The resulting state satisfies our goal: "stone1 is at a goal location".

So, the final revised plan is:

```
move player1 pos51 pos41 dirup
move player1 pos41 pos31 dirup
move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown
move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup
move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
move player1 pos24 pos14 dirup
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirleft
```

I am confident that this is a valid and optimal plan to achieve the goal.

Actually let me just do one more check on step 5.
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup - Player pushes stone1 from pos23 to pos13 (upward). Player is now at pos23, stone1 is at pos13.

Let's reconsider this line: "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.

The player is at position l_p (pos33), the stone is at position l_from (pos23), and we want to move the stone to position l_to (pos13).

Why is d set to dirup? We want the stone1 to move from pos23 -> pos13, which is moving upwards. Therefore d is indeed correctly set to dirup.

I see an error now. I forgot to check if the location l_from is right next to l_p in the direction d (i.e. is pos23 right next to pos33 in the direction dirup?)

pos33 to pos23 would be moving upwards. So I am moving in the dirup direction. That direction parameter is the direction of the push. The stone will be pushed in the direction d from l_from to l_to. Meanwhile, the agent p must be at position l_p moving in the direction d to reach l_from (i.e. the opposite direction from which the stone will move in).

OK so:
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup
- player1 is at pos33
- stone1 is at pos23
- pos13 is where the stone will end up
- dirup is the direction of the push (i.e. directionw of the stone's movement from pos23 to pos13)

Given these interpretations, all seems in order. However, let me double check the preconditions in more explicit detail:

"You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is not a goal location."

So the preconditions are:
(i) player1 is at pos33
(ii) stone1 is at pos23
(iii) pos13 is clear
(iv) you can get from pos33 to pos23 following direction dirup
(v) you can get from pos23 to pos13 following direction dirup
(vi) pos13 is not a goal location

Let's check each precondition:
Preconditions (i), (ii), (iii), and (vi) should be true. Preconditions (iv) and (v) we need to check against the list of all possible moves. 

There is a list item that says: "You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirleft". This says that to get from pos23 to pos13, we need to use the direction dirleft.

If pos23 is at the 2nd row and 3rd column, and pos13 is at the 1st row and 3rd column, then moving upwards (decreasing the row number) would mean going from pos23 to pos13, which is dirup. But the permitted move specifies direction dirleft, which suggests my interpretation of the grid is wrong.

Let's recheck the grid and directions:

From the list of allowed moves, I can find:
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

So, moving from pos11 to pos21 increases the first digit and is in the direction dirright.
Moving from pos11 to pos12 increases the second digit and is in the direction dirdown.

From this, I deduce that the grid's first digit represents the row (top to bottom), and the second digit represents the column (left to right), and dirright increases the row, dirdown increases the column, dirleft decreases the row, and dirup decreases the column.

So the grid looks like:

```
11 12 13 14 15
21 22 23 24 25
31 32 33 34 35
41 42 43 44 45
51 52 53 54 55
```

Where pos11 is the top-left, pos15 is the top-right, pos51 is the bottom-left, and pos55 is the bottom-right.

OK definitely in the problem statement the first digit is row and the second is column. let me just make sure I have the directions right:

From the list of allowed moves:
- dirright: Move from a position with a lower row number to a position with a higher row number (e.g., pos11 -> pos21, increasing the first digit)
- dirdown: Move from a position with a lower column number to a position with a higher column number (e.g., pos11 -> pos12, increasing the second digit)
- dirleft: Move from a position with a higher row number to a position with a lower row number (e.g., pos21 -> pos11, decreasing the first digit)
- dirup: Move from a position with a higher column number to a position with a lower column number (e.g., pos12 -> pos11, decreasing the second digit)

Actually wait, looking more closely at these:
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

they don't tell us what rows and columns are. Let me assume rows go left-right and columns go top-down, as is conventional in grids. Then the first digit is the column index and the second digit is the row index. So pos11 is top left, and pos55 is bottom right.

In that case:
- dirright increases the first digit (moving to the right)
- dirdown increases the second digit (moving down)
- dirleft decreases the first digit (moving to the left)
- dirup decreases the second digit (moving up)

But then things would be confusing again because a move from pos11 to pos21 would mean moving from (1, 1) to (2, 1), which is moving to the right. But it's labelled as "dirright", which would also mean moving to the right. It's confusing because the "columns go top-down" interpretation doesn't match the "dirdown increases the second digit" interpretation.

Let me assume the convention for positions is row_col, so pos11 is top left (row 1, col 1). Then the dirright, dirdown, etc. make more intuitive sense given the allowed moves. Then our state is:
- Player at pos51 (bottom left)
- Stone at pos23 (row 2, col 3 -- middle of top half)
- Goal at pos12 (row 1, col 2 -- near top left)


Hmm, and indeed, it says "You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirleft". In this case, we're moving from (2, 3) to (1, 3), which is moving up, not left. So this is adding to the confusion.

OK I re-checked the long list of allowed moves. I see things like:
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos21 to location pos11 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos11 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

From these, it seems like:
- dirright increases the first digit (from 1 to 2)
- dirleft decreases the first digit (from 2 to 1)
- dirdown increases the second digit (from 1 to 2)
- dirup decreases the second digit (from 2 to 1)

To keep things consistent with how I have been interpreting the grid, the first digit is the row, and the second digit is the column. Thus, dirright and dirleft correspond to moving  down and up in the grid, respectively, while dirdown and dirup correspond to moving right and left in the grid. So, with this interpretation, up is dirleft, down is dirright, left is dirup, and right is dirdown.

OK this is getting confusing. Let me try once more but without assuming how the directions lay out.

We understand that:
- pos11, pos12, pos13, ... pos55 label different positions on the grid.
- dirright, dirleft, dirup, dirdown indicate the directions in which the agent can move.

From the list of allowed moves in the problem, I see:
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

From this, we can deduce that:
- dirright changes the first digit of the position (pos11 -> pos21, 1->2).
- dirdown changes the second digit of the position (pos11 -> pos12, 1->2).

Thus, the relation between the positions and the cartesian grid coordinates is not straightforward.

Let's lay out the information clearly:

Goal: Move stone1 to a goal position (pos12).
Initial positions:
- player1 is at pos51
- stone1 is at pos23

We need a sequence of moves to accomplish this. Let me think step by step.

First, we need to position the player adjacent to the stone1 in a way that allows pushing the stone toward the goal. The stone is at pos23, and the goal is at pos12.

To push the stone from pos23 to pos12, we need to (1) push the stone horizontally from pos23 to pos13, changing the first digit (2 to 1), which corresponds to the direction dirleft; and (2) push the stone horizontally from pos13 to pos12, changing the second digit (3 to 2), which corresponds to the direction dirup.

For the first push (pos23 to pos13 in the direction dirleft), the player1 must be at a position adjacent to the stone in the opposite direction to the push. So, the player should be at pos33 (as the push direction is dirleft, the player should be in the exact opposite direction, which is dirright from the stone).

For the second push (pos13 to pos12 in the direction dirup), the player1 must be at a position adjacent to the stone in the opposite direction to the push. So, the player should be at pos14 (as the push direction is dirup, the player should be in the exact opposite direction, which is dirdown from the stone).

Let me write out the detailed plan:

1. Move player1 from pos51 to pos41 using direction dirleft (changing the first digit from 5 to 4).
2. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 using direction dirleft (changing the first digit from 4 to 3).
3. Move player1 from pos31 to pos32 using direction dirdown (changing the second digit from 1 to 2).
4. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 using direction dirdown (changing the second digit from 2 to 3).
5. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos13 using the pushtonongoal action (direction dirleft).
6. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14 using direction dirdown (changing the second digit from 3 to 4).
7. Push stone1 from pos13 to pos12 using the pushtogoal action (direction dirup).

OK wait, I need to be careful about the push action. Let's see

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirleft - Player pushes stone1 from pos23 to pos13 (dirleft). Player is now at pos23, stone1 is at pos13.
action arguments: (player, stone, player_position, stone_position, stone_target_position, direction)

The player is at pos33, the stone is at pos23, and we want to move the stone to pos13 (dirleft).

Let's check the preconditions:
(i) player1 is at pos33
(ii) stone1 is at pos23
(iii) pos13 is clear
(iv) you can get from pos33 to pos23 following direction dirleft: I need to check this
(v) you can get from pos23 to pos13 following direction dirleft: I need to check this
(vi) pos13 is not a goal location: Yes, pos12 is the goal

For (iv), I need to check if moving from pos33 to pos23 is a valid move in the dirleft direction.
From the list of valid moves, we have: "You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"
Yes, this is a valid move.

For (v), I need to check if moving from pos23 to pos13 is a valid move in the dirleft direction.
From the list of valid moves, we have: "You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirleft"
Yes, this is a valid move.

So, all preconditions are met for the first push. After the push, the player will be at pos23, and the stone will be at pos13.

Now, for the second push (pushtogoal), I need to position player1 at a position that allows pushing the stone from pos13 to pos12 (dirup). This would be a position adjacent to the stone in the opposite direction to the push. Given that the push direction is dirup, the player should be at pos14 (dirdown from the stone).

Looking at the list of valid moves, I want to check if we can go from pos14 to pos13 following direction dirup. I don't need to explicitly see this in the problem description, since we know it's valid to go from pos13 to pos14 following direction dirdown, and dirup is the opposite of dirdown.

Given the current plan, after the first push, the player is at pos23, and the stone is at pos13. The player needs to move from pos23 to pos14 to position for the second push. One possible path is:
- Move player1 from pos23 to pos24 using direction dirdown (changing the second digit from 3 to 4).
- Move player1 from pos24 to pos14 using direction dirleft (changing the first digit from 2 to 1).

Now, I can perform the second push:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirup - Player pushes stone1 from pos13 to pos12 (dirup). Stone1 is now at a goal location (pos12).

Let's check the preconditions for this push:
(i) player1 is at pos14
(ii) stone1 is at pos13
(iii) pos12 is clear
(iv) you can get from pos14 to pos13 following direction dirup: I need to check this
(v) you can get from pos13 to pos12 following direction dirup: I need to check this
(vi) pos12 is a goal location: Yes, this is the goal

For (iv), I need to check if moving from pos14 to pos13 is a valid move in the dirup direction.
From the list of valid moves, we have: "You may move from location pos14 to location pos13 following direction dirup"
Yes, this is a valid move.

For (v), I need to check if moving from pos13 to pos12 is a valid move in the dirup direction.
From the list of valid moves, we have: "You may move from location pos13 to location pos12 following direction dirup"
Yes, this is a valid move.

So, all preconditions are met for the second push. After the push, the player will be at pos13, and the stone will be at pos12.

OK so the plan looks good now. Actually after rethinking this entire problem a bit, I think I'm interpreting things correctly as:
- pos = (row, col)
- rows increase downwards (so pos51 is the bottom-left)
- columns increase rightwards (so pos15 is the top-right)
- directions are about changing the digits:
  - dirleft decreases the row (first digit)
  - dirright increases the row (first digit)
  - dirup decreases the column (second digit)
  - dirdown increases the column (second digit)

The full plan is:

```
move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft
move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown
move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirleft
move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirup
```

Now let me verify one more thing before I call this problem solved. Instead of the somewhat confusing pos-coordinates and directions, let me just double check the final plan with standard coordinates.

Alright so with standard coordinates, the problem is:

Start:
Player1: (5, 1)
Stone1: (2, 3)
Goal location: (1, 2)

The plan is:
1. Player1 from (5, 1) to (4, 1) (dirleft - decreasing row by 1)
2. Player1 from (4, 1) to (3, 1) (dirleft - decreasing row by 1)
3. Player1 from (3, 1) to (3, 2) (dirdown - increasing column by 1)
4. Player1 from (3, 2) to (3, 3) (dirdown - increasing column by 1)
5. Push stone1 from (2, 3) to (1, 3) (dirleft - decreasing row by 1). Player1 is now at (2, 3), stone1 is at (1, 3).
6. Player1 from (2, 3) to (2, 4) (dirdown - increasing column by 1)
7. Player1 from (2, 4) to (1, 4) (dirleft - decreasing row by 1)
8. Push stone1 from (1, 3) to (1, 2) (dirup - decreasing column by 1). Player1 is now at (1, 3), stone1 is at (1, 2), which is the goal location.

Yep, this plan achieves the goal, and I'm confident it's correct.

```
move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft
move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown
move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
