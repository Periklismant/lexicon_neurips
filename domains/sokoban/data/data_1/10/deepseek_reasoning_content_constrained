Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. From the initial state, stone1 is at pos23, and the only goal location mentioned is pos12. Wait, let me check the original state again. Oh right, the original state says "pos12 is a goal location", and all others are not. So the target is to move stone1 from pos23 to pos12.

But there are some constraints. The first constraint is that the player must be at pos24 in at least one state. The second constraint is that if the player is at pos24 in some state, then stone1 must be at pos44 either in that state or a subsequent one. Hmm, so even if we don't need pos44 for the goal, we have to ensure that if the agent is ever at pos24, then stone1 ends up at pos44 at some point. So the plan must include the agent being at pos24, and after that, maybe moving stone1 to pos44, but since the final goal is pos12, this complicates things. Wait, but stone1 needs to be at pos12 in the end. So the constraints might require that after the agent is at pos24, stone1 is moved to pos44, but then perhaps moved again to pos12. But that's adding steps. Let me think.

Wait, the second constraint is: if in any state s the agent is at pos24, then in s or some state after s, stone1 is at pos44. So once the agent is at pos24, stone1 must end up at pos44 either at that time or later. But the final goal is to have stone1 at a goal location (pos12). So maybe the plan must involve the agent going to pos24, then moving stone1 to pos44, then from pos44 to pos12. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the stone to pos44 first, then to pos12. But how to get the agent to pos24 in the process.

Wait, the initial position of the agent is pos51. Stone1 is at pos23. The grid is 5x5, positions from pos11 (top-left?) to pos55 (bottom-right). Let me sketch the grid mentally.

The movement directions are up, down, left, right. Let's see the movement paths. For example, pos51 can move left to pos41 or down to pos52. The agent starts at pos51.

The stone is at pos23. Goal location is pos12. So we need to move the stone from pos23 to pos12. Let's see the possible paths. From pos23, possible moves: up to pos22, left to pos13, right to pos33, down to pos24. But each push action requires the agent to be adjacent in the direction of the push.

Wait, the push actions: pushtogoal and pushtonongoal. The agent must be at a location adjacent to the stone, and the direction must allow pushing the stone to the next cell. For example, to push the stone from pos23 to pos22 (up), the agent needs to be at pos24 (if pushing up?), wait no. Wait, the direction is the direction from the agent's position to the stone's position. Wait, the preconditions for pushtogoal are: agent is at l_p, stone is at l_from, l_to is clear. The direction d must allow moving from l_p to l_from (so agent moves towards the stone), then from l_from to l_to (stone moves in direction d). So for example, if the agent is at pos22, and the stone is at pos23, direction dirdown. Then l_p is pos22, l_from is pos23, direction from l_p to l_from is dirdown. Then pushing the stone down would take it to pos24. But in that case, the direction for the stone's movement would be dirdown, so l_to would be pos24.

Wait, maybe the directions are such that the agent moves towards the stone and then pushes it in the same direction. So to push a stone north (up), the agent would need to be south of the stone, move north to the stone's position, and then push the stone north to the next cell.

Alternatively, the direction for pushing is the direction from the agent's starting position to the stone's position. For example, if the agent is at pos24 and the stone is at pos23, then direction dirup (since moving up from pos24 would be to pos23). Then the stone is pushed from pos23 to pos22 (dirup), if that's allowed.

But I need to check the movement connections. Let's see the initial movement allowed. For example, "You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirleft". So direction dirleft from pos23 would be to pos13. Wait, maybe the directions are such that each direction is a cardinal direction. Let's see:

For example, pos23 can move left to pos13 (dirleft), right to pos33 (dirright), up to pos22 (dirup), down to pos24 (dirdown).

So when the agent is moving to a stone's position, the direction must match. So to push a stone north (dirup), the agent must be south of the stone (e.g., pos24), move north (dirdown?) Wait, no. Let's take an example. Suppose the agent is at pos24, and the stone is at pos23. The movement from pos24 to pos23 is dirup (since moving up from pos24 leads to pos23). So the direction would be dirup. Then pushing the stone from pos23 to pos22 (dirup again). So the agent moves from pos24 to pos23 (dirup), then pushes the stone from pos23 to pos22 (dirup). But in that case, the preconditions for the push action would require that the agent is at pos24 (l_p), the stone is at pos23 (l_from), l_to is pos22, direction d is dirup. The movement from l_p (pos24) to l_from (pos23) must be possible via direction d (dirup). Then movement from l_from (pos23) to l_to (pos22) must be possible via direction d (dirup). So yes, that's valid.

But the problem is getting the agent to pos24 at some point. So the first constraint is that the agent must be at pos24 in at least one state. Then, after that, the stone must be at pos44 either in that state or later. But the stone's initial position is pos23, and the goal is pos12 (a goal location). So how to satisfy both constraints.

Let's outline possible steps:

1. Agent needs to move from pos51 to pos24. Then, while moving to pos24, perhaps push the stone along the way. But stone is at pos23. Let's see the path.

Agent starts at pos51. To get to pos24, possible path:

pos51 → pos41 (dirleft), then pos41 → pos31 (dirleft), pos31 → pos21 (dirleft), pos21 → pos22 (dirdown), pos22 → pos23 (dirdown), but wait, that's getting to pos23. But the stone is already at pos23. So maybe another path. Alternatively, pos51 → pos52 (dirdown), then pos52 → pos42 (dirleft), pos42 → pos32 (dirleft), pos32 → pos22 (dirleft), pos22 → pos23 (dirdown). But again, that leads to pos23 where the stone is.

Wait, but to reach pos24, maybe another path. Let's see:

pos51 → pos52 (dirdown)
pos52 → pos53 (dirdown)
pos53 → pos54 (dirdown)
pos54 → pos44 (dirleft)
pos44 → pos34 (dirleft)
pos34 → pos24 (dirleft)
Then the agent is at pos24. So that's a possible path. But during this movement, the agent is moving down and left, avoiding the stone's position. But this path requires moving through several positions. Let's count steps:

pos51 → pos52 (1)
pos52 → pos53 (2)
pos53 → pos54 (3)
pos54 → pos44 (4)
pos44 → pos34 (5)
pos34 → pos24 (6). So six move actions to reach pos24.

Once the agent is at pos24, the first constraint is satisfied. Now, the second constraint requires that stone1 is at pos44 either at that state or later. But stone1 is at pos23. So after the agent is at pos24, we need to move stone1 to pos44. How?

To push stone1 from pos23 to pos44, we need to get the agent in a position adjacent to the stone. But pos23 is at row 2, column 3. pos44 is row4, column4. So that's a long distance. Wait, maybe the agent can go back towards the stone's initial position and push it towards pos44.

But after the agent is at pos24, how can he push the stone to pos44?

Alternatively, after being at pos24, maybe the agent can move to pos23 (dirup), but then the stone is at pos23. So that's not possible unless the agent can push the stone. Wait, the stone is at pos23. If the agent is at pos24, then pushing the stone up (dirup) would move it from pos23 to pos22. But that's towards the goal location pos12. But after pushing to pos22, the stone is closer to the goal. Then, the agent could push it further to pos12. But the constraint requires that after the agent is at pos24, the stone must be at pos44. So perhaps after being at pos24, the agent must push the stone all the way to pos44.

But that seems complicated. Let me think: maybe the agent can go from pos24 to pos34 (dirright?), but let's check the allowed movements. The movement from pos24: "You may move from location pos24 to location pos14 following direction dirleft", "to pos34 following direction dirright", "to pos23 following dirup", "to pos25 following dirdown". So pos24 can move right to pos34. So agent is at pos24, moves right to pos34 (direction dirright). Then from pos34, can move right to pos44. Then from pos44, right to pos54. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the agent can move from pos24 to pos34 (dirright), then to pos44 (dirright), etc. But how does that help with moving the stone?

Alternatively, after the agent is at pos24, he needs to push the stone to pos44. To do that, the agent must reach a position adjacent to the stone and push it in the required direction. But the stone is at pos23. So the agent needs to get back to the stone's vicinity.

Wait, maybe after the agent is at pos24, the plan could involve moving back towards the stone, pushing it towards pos44, and then to the goal. Let's see:

Agent is at pos24. Let's say he moves up to pos23 (dirup). But pos23 has the stone. So he can't move into it unless he's pushing it. Wait, the stone is at pos23. So if the agent is at pos24 and wants to push the stone, the direction would be dirup (from pos24 to pos23), then push the stone dirup to pos22. But that's moving it towards the goal. But then, after that, the stone is at pos22. But then, according to the constraints, after the agent was at pos24, the stone must be at pos44. So that approach would not satisfy the constraint.

Hmm. So perhaps the agent must first move to pos24, then push the stone to pos44. But how?

Alternative approach: The agent's path to pos24 must be such that during that path, he can push the stone towards pos44. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's consider that the stone is at pos23. The goal is pos12. So the optimal path without constraints would be to push the stone up twice (from pos23 to pos22, then pos22 to pos12). But the constraints require that the agent is at pos24 at some point, and that when he is, the stone ends up at pos44.

So the plan must include the agent going to pos24, and then moving the stone to pos44. But how to do that without making the plan longer than necessary.

Alternatively, maybe after pushing the stone to pos44, then pushing it back towards pos12. But that seems inefficient.

Let me outline steps:

1. Agent moves from pos51 to pos24 (to satisfy the first constraint).

   To get to pos24 from pos51, possible path:

   pos51 → pos41 (dirleft)
   pos41 → pos31 (dirleft)
   pos31 → pos21 (dirleft)
   pos21 → pos22 (dirdown)
   pos22 → pos23 (dirdown)
   Wait, but pos23 has the stone. So the agent can't move into pos23. So that's invalid. So alternative path:

   pos51 → pos41 (dirleft)
   pos41 → pos42 (dirdown)
   pos42 → pos43 (dirdown)
   pos43 → pos44 (dirdown)
   pos44 → pos34 (dirleft)
   pos34 → pos24 (dirleft)

   So that's 6 moves. Then agent is at pos24. Now, the agent is at pos24. Now, he needs to get to the stone (pos23) to push it towards pos44. But how?

   From pos24, the agent can move up to pos23 (dirup), but pos23 has the stone. So he can't move there unless he pushes the stone. Wait, but the stone is at pos23. To push it, the agent must be adjacent. Wait, to push the stone from pos23 to pos24, the agent would need to be at pos23, but that's where the stone is. No. Wait, the agent must be at a position adjacent to the stone in the direction of the push. For example, to push the stone down to pos24, the agent must be at pos23 (but the stone is there). So that's impossible. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the push directions.

   Let me recheck the preconditions for the push actions. For example, pushtogoal requires that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's current position) in direction d. Then, the stone is pushed from l_from to l_to in the same direction d. So for example, if the agent is at pos24, and wants to push the stone from pos23 to pos24 (direction dirdown?), but pos23 is above pos24. So direction from agent's position to stone's position is dirup. Then the stone would be pushed in dirup direction? No. Wait, no. The direction d is the direction from the agent's current position (l_p) to the stone's position (l_from). So if the agent is at pos24, and the stone is at pos23, then the direction from pos24 to pos23 is dirup. So the agent can push the stone from pos23 in dirup direction to pos22. Wait, but that's moving the stone up. So the stone is at pos23, agent at pos24, direction dirup. Then the stone would move from pos23 to pos22 (dirup). So that's possible. So the action would be pushtonongoal (since pos22 is not a goal), with l_p=pos24, l_from=pos23, l_to=pos22, d=dirup. Then after this action, the stone is at pos22, and the agent is at pos23.

But after that, the agent is at pos23. Then, he can push the stone again to pos12. But pos22 is a non-goal location. So pushing the stone from pos22 to pos12 would require using pushtogoal, since pos12 is a goal.

But let's see. If after the agent is at pos24, he pushes the stone to pos22, then moves to pos22 and pushes it to pos12. But then, the stone is at pos22 (non-goal) and then to pos12 (goal). But the problem is that the constraint requires that after the agent is at pos24, the stone must be at pos44. So this approach doesn't satisfy that.

So maybe the agent needs to push the stone from pos23 to pos24 (but pos24 is not a goal location). Wait, but how? Because to push the stone down to pos24, the agent would need to be at pos23 (but that's where the stone is). So that's impossible. Alternatively, the agent could be at pos25, which is south of pos24, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to take a longer route. Let's think again.

The agent is at pos24 (satisfies the first constraint). Now, he must push the stone to pos44. So how?

The stone is at pos23. To push it towards pos44, the agent needs to maneuver around to push it east (right) and south (down) multiple times. For example:

From pos23, pushing it right to pos33, then down to pos43, then right to pos44. But how to get the agent into position for each push.

Alternatively, perhaps after the agent is at pos24, he can move to pos34, then to pos44, then to pos43, then push the stone from pos23 to pos33 (if possible), but this seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can move from pos24 to pos34 (dirright), then pos34 to pos44 (dirright). Then from pos44, move left to pos43 (dirleft), then down to pos53, etc. Wait, this is getting messy. Let's think step by step.

After agent is at pos24 (after moving there), he needs to push the stone to pos44. So perhaps the steps are:

Agent at pos24. He needs to get to the stone's current position (pos23) to push it east or south. But pos23 is currently occupied by the stone. So he can't move there. So he needs to approach from another direction.

Alternatively, the agent can move from pos24 to pos23 (dirup), but since the stone is there, he can't. So the agent must push the stone first. But how?

Wait, maybe the agent is at pos24. The stone is at pos23. The agent can push the stone up to pos22. Then, the agent moves to pos23 (now empty). Then, he can push the stone east to pos32, then south to pos42, etc. But this seems like a long path and may not reach pos44.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos22, the agent can push it to pos12 (the goal). But then the stone is at the goal, but the constraint requires it to be at pos44 after the agent was at pos24. So this would not satisfy the constraint.

Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe the initial approach of moving the agent to pos24 is not the optimal one, and there's a smarter way to satisfy the constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can push the stone to pos44 first, then to pos12, ensuring that when the agent is at pos24 during that process, the stone is already at pos44.

Wait, the constraints are:

1. Agent must be at pos24 at least once.

2. If agent is at pos24 in state s, then stone1 is at pos44 in s or later.

So if the stone is already at pos44 when the agent is at pos24, that satisfies the constraint. Alternatively, if the agent is at pos24 and then later the stone moves to pos44, that also works.

But how to get the stone to pos44 and the agent to pos24.

Alternative plan:

First, move the agent to pos44, push the stone from pos23 to pos33, then to pos43, then to pos44. Then, move the agent to pos24. Since the stone is at pos44 when the agent is at pos24, that satisfies the constraint. Then, push the stone to pos12.

But let's see:

1. Move agent from pos51 to pos23 via a series of moves, but the stone is there. So that's impossible.

Wait, the stone is at pos23. The agent can't move there unless pushing it. So the agent must push the stone from pos23 to another position first.

Initial push: agent needs to get adjacent to pos23 to push it. Let's see:

Agent starts at pos51. To get near pos23, possible path: pos51 → pos41 (dirleft), pos41 → pos31 (dirleft), pos31 → pos21 (dirleft), pos21 → pos22 (dirdown), pos22 is clear. Then, from pos22, push the stone from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown). Wait, direction from pos22 to pos23 is dirdown. So the action would be pushtonongoal (since pos24 is not a goal) player1, stone1, l_p=pos22, l_from=pos23, l_to=pos24, d=dirdown.

After this action, the agent moves to pos23, stone1 moves to pos24. Now, stone is at pos24. Then, agent can push it further. But pos24 is not a goal, so we need to move it to pos12 eventually. But also, the constraints require the agent to be at pos24, which is now possible by moving to pos24.

Wait, after this push, the stone is at pos24. The agent is at pos23. Then, the agent can move to pos24 (since it's now clear? No, the stone was at pos24, but after the push, stone moves to pos24. Wait, no. When you push the stone from pos23 to pos24, the stone is at pos24, which was previously clear. After the action, the stone is at pos24, the agent is at pos23. Then, pos24 is no longer clear. So the agent can't move into pos24. So the agent is at pos23. Then, he can push the stone again from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown), but pos25 is not a goal. Alternatively, push the stone to pos34 (dirright from pos24). But to push the stone east from pos24 to pos34, the agent must be at pos24. But he's at pos23. So he needs to move to pos24 first, which is now occupied by the stone. So that's impossible.

Hmm. This suggests that the initial approach of pushing the stone to pos24 may not help.

Alternatively, perhaps after the initial push to pos24, the agent can move around to push it further. But this is getting complicated.

Another angle: The constraints require that the agent is at pos24 at least once. So even if the agent goes to pos24 after moving the stone to pos12, it's still needed. But the stone is already at pos12 (the goal), so the second constraint would require that after the agent is at pos24, the stone is at pos44. But that's impossible if the stone is already at the goal. So the agent must visit pos24 before the stone reaches pos12.

So the sequence must be:

Agent moves to pos24 (satisfy first constraint), then pushes the stone to pos44 (satisfy second constraint), then pushes it to pos12 (goal).

But how?

Let's try:

1. Agent moves from pos51 to pos24 (6 moves as before). So agent is at pos24.

2. Now, need to push stone1 from pos23 to pos44. But the stone is at pos23, and the agent is at pos24. To push the stone, agent must be adjacent in the direction of the push.

Wait, the stone is at pos23. The agent is at pos24 (south of pos23). To push the stone north (up) from pos23 to pos22, the agent would be at pos24, direction dirup. So action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirup. But this moves the stone to pos22, which is not helpful for getting to pos44.

Alternatively, agent needs to get to the east side of the stone to push it east. For example, agent moves from pos24 to pos34 (dirright), then to pos33 (dirleft?), but the stone is at pos23. Not sure.

Alternatively, after agent is at pos24, he moves to pos25 (dirdown), then to pos35 (dirright), then pos45 (dirright), etc. But this seems like a long detour.

Alternatively, after agent is at pos24, he moves back up to pos23 (dirup) but can't because stone is there. So he needs to push it first.

Wait, maybe after reaching pos24, the agent pushes the stone from pos23 to pos24 (but that's where the stone would go). But pos24 is occupied by the agent? No, after pushing, the agent moves to pos23, and the stone moves to pos24. Wait, no: the agent is at pos24 (l_p), pushes the stone from pos23 (l_from) to pos24 (l_to), but l_to is pos24 which is where the agent is. But the preconditions for pushtonongoal require that l_to is clear. But pos24 is occupied by the agent. So that's invalid. Thus, this approach is impossible.

Hmm. So perhaps the agent must push the stone from pos23 to pos24 before moving to pos24. But how?

Wait, if the agent is at pos23, he can push the stone to pos24. But to be at pos23, the agent needs to move there from pos22 or pos24. Let's see.

Suppose the agent is at pos22. He pushes the stone from pos23 to pos24. Then, the agent moves to pos23. Then, he can move to pos24. But then, the stone is at pos24. So when the agent is at pos24, the stone is also at pos24, which is not possible. So that's invalid.

This is getting quite complex. Let's try to outline a possible sequence:

First, move the agent to pos24 (to satisfy the first constraint). But how?

Agent's path to pos24:

pos51 → pos41 (dirleft)
pos41 → pos31 (dirleft)
pos31 → pos21 (dirleft)
pos21 → pos22 (dirdown)
pos22 → pos23 (dirdown) [but stone is there. Can't move. So invalid.]

Alternative path:

pos51 → pos52 (dirdown)
pos52 → pos53 (dirdown)
pos53 → pos54 (dirdown)
pos54 → pos44 (dirleft)
pos44 → pos34 (dirleft)
pos34 → pos24 (dirleft). So six moves to reach pos24.

Now, agent is at pos24. Now, the stone is at pos23. To satisfy the constraint, after this, stone must be at pos44. So agent needs to push stone from pos23 to pos44. How?

The agent is at pos24. To push the stone east, he needs to be west of it. Wait, the stone is at pos23. To push it east (dirright) to pos33, the agent must be at pos23. But he can't get there because the stone is there. So this is not possible.

Alternatively, the agent can move around to get to the east side of the stone. But how?

From pos24, agent can move right to pos34, then up to pos23 (dirup?), but pos23 is occupied by the stone. So that's invalid.

Alternatively, agent moves from pos24 to pos34 (dirright), then to pos44 (dirright), then to pos43 (dirleft), then to pos33 (dirleft), etc. This is getting too convoluted.

Maybe there's a different approach. Let's think about pushing the stone to pos44 first, then moving the agent to pos24, which would satisfy the constraint because when the agent is at pos24, the stone is already at pos44.

So steps:

1. Push stone from pos23 to pos33 (east), then to pos43 (south), then to pos44 (east). Then, move the agent to pos24. This way, when the agent is at pos24, the stone is at pos44. Then push the stone to pos12.

But how to do that.

First, agent needs to reach pos23 to push east. But initial position is pos51. How to get to pos23.

Agent's path:

pos51 → pos41 (dirleft)
pos41 → pos31 (dirleft)
pos31 → pos21 (dirleft)
pos21 → pos22 (dirdown)
pos22 → pos23 (dirdown). But pos23 has the stone. So agent can't move there unless pushing.

So, agent is at pos22. Stone is at pos23. Agent can push the stone east to pos33. Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos33 dirright. But pos33 is not a goal. After this, agent is at pos23, stone is at pos33.

Then, agent moves from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown). Now, agent is at pos24. Now, the stone is at pos33. To push it to pos43, agent needs to be south of pos33. So agent moves from pos24 to pos34 (dirright), then to pos33 (dirup). Now agent is at pos33. Then pushes stone from pos33 to pos43 (dirdown). Now stone is at pos43. Agent is at pos33.

Then, agent moves to pos43 (dirdown), and pushes the stone east to pos44. Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos44 dirright. Wait, no. The stone is at pos43. To push it east to pos44, agent must be at pos43 (since direction is dirright from pos43 to pos44). So agent is at pos43, pushes stone to pos44. Then agent moves to pos44. Now stone is at pos44.

Now, the agent needs to go to pos24. From pos44, move left to pos34, then left to pos24. So:

pos44 → pos34 (dirleft)
pos34 → pos24 (dirleft). Now agent is at pos24. At this point, the stone is at pos44. So when agent is at pos24, the stone is already at pos44, satisfying the second constraint.

Then, the stone needs to be pushed to pos12. From pos44, the agent can push it north to pos34, then to pos24, etc. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, the agent can move back to pos44 and push the stone west to pos43, then north, but this seems inefficient.

Alternatively, from pos24, the agent can move up to pos14, then left to pos13, etc., but this is getting too long.

This plan seems very lengthy. The optimal plan should be as short as possible. So perhaps there's a shorter way.

Alternative plan:

Agent moves to pos24 (via the long path), then pushes the stone from pos23 to pos24 (but that's impossible due to preconditions). Hmm.

Alternatively, the agent can push the stone from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown) when the agent is at pos23. But to be at pos23, he must push the stone first. Wait, initial stone at pos23. To push it down to pos24, the agent must be at pos23, which is occupied by the stone. So that's impossible. So the agent must first move to a position adjacent to the stone.

Agent starts at pos51. To reach a position adjacent to the stone (pos23), he can go:

pos51 → pos41 (dirleft)
pos41 → pos31 (dirleft)
pos31 → pos21 (dirleft)
pos21 → pos22 (dirdown)
Now, agent is at pos22. Stone is at pos23. Agent can push the stone to pos24 (dirdown). Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown. Now, stone is at pos24, agent is at pos23.

Then, agent can move to pos24 (dirdown), but the stone is there. No. So agent can't. So instead, agent moves from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown), but pos24 is occupied by the stone. So invalid.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos24, the agent is at pos23. Then, the agent can move up to pos22, then right to pos32, etc. But how to get the stone to pos44 from here.

Alternatively, from pos23, agent moves right to pos33 (dirright), but that's allowed if the path exists. Let me check the allowed movements. From pos23: can move to pos13 (dirleft), pos33 (dirright), pos22 (dirup), pos24 (dirdown). So yes, agent can move from pos23 to pos33 (dirright). Then, agent is at pos33. Now, the stone is at pos24. To push it to pos44, agent needs to get to pos24 and push it right to pos34. But agent is at pos33. So this seems difficult.

This is getting very complicated. Let's try to outline a step-by-step plan that satisfies the constraints.

Step 1: Agent moves to pos24 to satisfy the first constraint. Let's assume this takes 6 moves (as per earlier path).

Step 2: Now, agent is at pos24. Stone is at pos23. He needs to push the stone to pos44.

But how? From pos24, the agent can push the stone north to pos22, then west to pos12 (goal). But that would not satisfy the second constraint (stone must be at pos44 after agent is at pos24).

Alternative idea: After agent is at pos24, he moves back north to pos23 (dirup), but stone is there. So he can't. So he must push the stone first.

But he's at pos24, stone at pos23. He can push it north to pos22 (action: pushtonongoal, dirup). Stone moves to pos22. Agent moves to pos23.

Step 3: Now, stone is at pos22. Agent is at pos23.

Step 4: Agent moves to pos24 (dirdown).

Step 5: Agent pushes stone from pos22 to pos12 (which is a goal). Action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos22 pos12 dirup. Preconditions: agent is at pos24, stone at pos22, pos12 clear. But pos12 is clear. Direction: from pos24 to pos22 is dirup (two steps up). Wait, but movement directions may only allow adjacent cells. The preconditions for pushtogoal require that you can move from l_p (pos24) to l_from (pos22) following direction d. But pos24 to pos22 would require moving up two steps. But according to the allowed movements, from pos24, you can move up to pos23 (dirup), but from pos23 to pos22 is also dirup. So the path from pos24 to pos22 would require two moves: dirup to pos23, then dirup to pos22. But the action requires that you can move from l_p to l_from in direction d. So if d is dirup, but pos24 to pos22 is two steps, then the direction is not valid. Thus, this action is invalid.

So the agent cannot push the stone from pos22 to pos12 directly from pos24. He needs to be adjacent to the stone.

So agent must move to pos22. But how? From pos24, he can move up to pos23 (dirup), but stone is not there anymore. After step 2, stone is at pos22. So pos23 is clear. So agent can move from pos24 to pos23 (dirup), then to pos22 (dirup). Then, at pos22, he can push the stone to pos12 (dirup).

So steps:

Step 3: Agent moves from pos24 → pos23 (dirup)
Step 4: Agent moves from pos23 → pos22 (dirup)
Step 5: Push stone from pos22 to pos12 (pushtogoal). This would satisfy the goal.

But now, after the agent was at pos24 (step 1), he pushed the stone to pos22 (step 2), then moved to pos22 (steps 3-4), and pushed to pos12 (step5). But the constraint requires that after agent is at pos24, stone must be at pos44. In this plan, after agent is at pos24 (step1), the stone is at pos22 (step2), then moves to pos12. This violates the constraint because the stone never reaches pos44.

Thus, this plan is invalid.

So the only way to satisfy the constraint is to have the stone at pos44 after the agent is at pos24. Therefore, we need to find a way to move the stone from pos23 to pos44 after the agent reaches pos24.

Alternative approach:

After agent is at pos24, he must somehow push the stone east and south.

But how?

Let's consider that after agent is at pos24, he moves east to pos34, then south to pos44. Then, from pos44, he can push the stone from pos23 to pos24, but the stone is not there anymore.

Alternatively, the stone is at pos23. The agent is at pos24. The agent can push the stone east to pos33 (dirright), but for that, he needs to be west of pos23. So that's impossible from pos24.

Wait, the agent is at pos24. The stone is at pos23. To push the stone east to pos33, the agent must be at pos23 (west of pos33). But he can't get there because the stone is there.

Hmm. This seems like a dead end. Perhaps the only way is to have the agent push the stone to pos44 before visiting pos24, but how.

Wait, let's consider this:

1. Agent pushes stone from pos23 to pos33 (east).

   To do this, agent must be at pos22 (west of pos23). So path:

   pos51 → pos41 → pos31 → pos21 → pos22.

   Then push east to pos23 → pos33.

   Now, stone is at pos33. Agent is at pos23.

2. Then, agent moves to pos24.

   From pos23 → pos24 (dirdown). Now agent is at pos24. At this state, the stone is at pos33. So the constraint requires that after this, the stone must be at pos44. So agent needs to push stone from pos33 to pos44.

3. Agent moves from pos24 to pos34 (dirright), then to pos44 (dirright).

4. From pos44, agent moves west to pos43 (dirleft), then north to pos33 (dirup).

5. Now agent is at pos33, stone is at pos33. Push east to pos43.

6. Then push south to pos44.

This way, after agent was at pos24 (step2), he pushes stone to pos44 (steps 3-6). But this is very long.

But this plan would satisfy the constraints. However, the number of steps is large. The problem asks for an optimal plan with minimal steps.

This is getting quite complicated, and I'm not sure if this is the optimal path. Maybe there's a shorter way.

Another idea: Use the fact that the agent can push the stone to pos44 in one go from pos24 by making a long path of pushes. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the agent can move to pos24, then move east to pos34, then south to pos44. Then, push the stone from pos23 to pos44 by some path. But again, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the agent can push the stone from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown), then from pos24 to pos34 (dirright), then pos34 to pos44 (dirright). But each push requires the agent to be adjacent in the direction.

So:

1. Agent moves to pos22 (as before).

2. Push stone from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown). Agent is at pos23.

3. Agent moves to pos24 (dirdown). But pos24 is occupied by the stone. So impossible.

So this approach doesn't work.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos24 (agent at pos23), the agent moves to pos34 (dirright from pos23? But pos23 can move right to pos33. So agent moves from pos23 → pos33 → pos34 → pos44.

Then, from pos44, agent can push the stone from pos24 to pos34, but the stone is at pos24. Agent is at pos44. How to push?

This is really tricky. Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I'll try to outline a possible valid plan that meets all constraints, even if it's not the shortest.

Plan steps:

1. Move agent from pos51 to pos41 (dirleft)
2. Move agent to pos31 (dirleft)
3. Move agent to pos21 (dirleft)
4. Move agent to pos22 (dirdown)
5. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown) using pushtonongoal. Now stone is at pos24, agent at pos23.
6. Move agent to pos24 (dirdown) – impossible, as stone is there. So instead, move agent from pos23 to pos22 (dirup)
7. Move agent to pos21 (dirup)
8. Move agent to pos31 (dirright)
9. Move agent to pos32 (dirdown)
10. Move agent to pos33 (dirdown)
11. Move agent to pos34 (dirdown)
12. Move agent to pos44 (dirright)
13. Move agent to pos43 (dirleft)
14. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos34 (dirup) – but agent is at pos43, can't push. This approach isn't working.

Alternative plan after step 5 (stone at pos24, agent at pos23):

6. Agent moves from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown) – invalid because stone is there.

Hmm. This is not working. Maybe the only way to satisfy the constraints is to have the agent visit pos24 after the stone is at pos44.

So:

1. Agent pushes stone from pos23 to pos33 (east), then to pos43 (south), then to pos44 (east). Then agent moves to pos24. So when agent is at pos24, stone is at pos44. Then push stone to pos12.

But how:

1. Agent moves to pos22 (as before).
2. Push stone east to pos33 (dirright). Now stone at pos33, agent at pos23.
3. Agent moves to pos33 (dirdown? Wait, pos23 → pos33 is dirright. Wait, from pos23, the agent can move right to pos33 (dirright).
4. Now agent is at pos33. Push stone south to pos43 (dirdown). Stone at pos43, agent at pos34.
5. Agent moves to pos43 (dirdown).
6. Push stone east to pos44 (dirright). Stone at pos44, agent at pos44.
7. Agent moves to pos34 (dirleft), then to pos24 (dirleft). Now agent is at pos24, stone at pos44. This satisfies both constraints.
8. Now, push stone from pos44 to pos34 (dirup), then to pos24, pos14, pos13, pos12. But pos44 to pos34 is dirup. Agent must be at pos44. Push stone to pos34. Then agent is at pos44, stone at pos34. Then agent moves to pos34, pushes to pos24, etc. Finally, push to pos12.

But this is very long. Maybe there's a shorter path from pos44 to pos12.

Alternatively, from pos44, the agent can push the stone north to pos34, then west to pos24, pos14, pos13, pos12. But each step requires the agent to be in position to push.

But this seems excessively long. However, given the constraints, this might be the only way.

But the problem states that the plan must be optimal, i.e., the shortest possible. So there must be a shorter path.

Alternative idea: The agent can push the stone from pos23 to pos24, then from pos24 to pos34, then to pos44. This way, after the agent is at pos24, the stone is pushed to pos44.

But how to do that.

Step-by-step:

1. Agent moves from pos51 to pos41 (dirleft)
2. pos41 → pos31 (dirleft)
3. pos31 → pos21 (dirleft)
4. pos21 → pos22 (dirdown)
5. pos22 → pos23 (dirdown) – but stone is here. So agent can't. Instead, from pos22, push stone from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown). Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown. Now stone is at pos24, agent is at pos23.
6. Agent moves to pos24 (dirdown) – invalid, stone is there. So agent moves to pos24 is impossible. So agent moves from pos23 to pos33 (dirright).
7. Agent is at pos33. Now, to push stone from pos24 to pos34, agent needs to be at pos24. So agent needs to move to pos34, then to pos24.

But this is getting too tangled. I think I'm stuck and need to provide a valid plan even if it's not optimal, but according to the problem statement, the assistant must provide an optimal plan.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps the correct plan involves the agent moving to pos24, then pushing the stone to pos44 via a series of moves, but I'll have to make an educated guess.

Here's a possible plan:

1. Move player1 from pos51 to pos41 (dirleft)
2. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 (dirleft)
3. Move player1 from pos31 to pos21 (dirleft)
4. Move player1 from pos21 to pos22 (dirdown)
5. Move player1 from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown) [impossible, stone is there. So adjust: push the stone first.]
4. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown
   Now, stone is at pos24, agent at pos23.
5. Move player1 from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown) [invalid as stone is there. So instead, move elsewhere.]
5. Move player1 from pos23 to pos33 (dirright)
6. Move player1 from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown)
7. Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 (dirright)
8. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos24 pos34 dirup [invalid, since stone is at pos24, agent is at pos44. Can't push from pos44 to pos24.]

Alternatively, after step 4, the stone is at pos24. Agent is at pos23. Now, agent moves to pos33 (dirright), then pos34 (dirdown), then pos44 (dirright). Then, from pos44, push the stone from pos24 to pos34. But agent is at pos44, stone is at pos24. No, can't reach.

This isn't working. I think I need to abandon and provide the best possible answer given the time.

Based on initial steps, here's a possible plan:

```
move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft
move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft
move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown
move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos44 dirright
move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos44 pos34 dirup
...
```

But this is not correct. I think I'll have to give up and provide a sample plan that meets the constraints, even if it's not optimal.

After multiple attempts, the optimal plan would likely involve the agent moving to pos24, then pushing the stone to pos44, then to the goal. But due to time constraints, here's a possible valid plan:

```
move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft
move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft
move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown
move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright
move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft
move player1 pos14 pos13 dirleft
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos44 pos43 dirleft
...
```

But this is not correct. Given the complexity, the correct answer likely involves the agent moving to pos24, then pushing the stone east and south to pos44, then to pos12.

But to avoid further delay, I'll provide the following plan based on initial steps, assuming it meets the constraints:

```
move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft
move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft
move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown
move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos24 pos34 dirup
move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos24 dirup
move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos14 dirup
...
```

But this is not correct. Given the time invested, I'll proceed with the initial steps and assume the correct answer is:

```
move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft
move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft
move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown
move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos24 pos34 dirright
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos34 pos44 dirright
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos44 pos43 dirleft
...
```

This is clearly incorrect. I'm struggling to find the optimal path, but given the problem constraints, the correct plan likely involves the agent moving to pos24 via a certain path, then pushing the stone through a series of steps to pos44, then to the goal. The exact steps require precise movement and pushing actions.
