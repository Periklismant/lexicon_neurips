Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to get stone1 from pos23 to a goal location. The only goal location mentioned is pos12. So the plan is to push stone1 from pos23 to pos12. But first, the agent is at pos51. How do I get the agent to pos23?

Let me visualize the grid. The positions are labeled posXY where X is the row and Y is the column. So pos51 is row 5, column 1. pos23 is row 2, column 3. The goal is pos12 (row 1, column 2).

The agent starts at pos51. To reach pos23, they need to move through the grid. Let's look at the movement possibilities. From pos51, the agent can move left to pos41 or down to pos52. Wait, direction dirleft and dirright might be a bit confusing. Wait, the movement from pos51 to pos41 is via dirleft? Or maybe the directions are relative. Let me check the allowed movements.

Looking at the movement list: "You may move from location pos51 to location pos41 following direction dirleft". So dirleft from pos51 takes them to pos41. Similarly, from pos41 to pos31 via dirleft, and so on. So to get from pos51 to pos23, the agent needs to move left (dirleft) to pos41, then left again to pos31, then left to pos21, then up? Wait, pos21 is row 2, column 1. Wait, maybe the directions are like: moving dirup decreases the row number? Because pos21 to pos11 is dirup. Wait, pos21 is row 2, column1. pos11 is row1, column1. So dirup would be moving from row2 to row1. Similarly, dirdown increases the row. So direction dirup is north, dirdown is south, dirleft is west, dirright is east.

So the agent is at pos51 (row5, column1). To get to pos23 (row2, column3), they need to move north (dirup) to higher rows? Wait, wait. Let's see the movement from pos51 to pos41: pos51 is row5, column1. pos41 is row4, column1. So moving dirleft from pos51 to pos41? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the movement directions are a bit different. Let me check the movement from pos51 to pos41 is via dirleft. So dirleft here might mean moving left in the grid. But in a grid, moving left would decrease the column, but pos51 is column1, so left isn't possible. Wait, maybe the directions are named differently. For example, moving from pos51 to pos41 is dirleft. But pos51 is (5,1) and pos41 is (4,1), so that's moving up (row decreases by 1). So maybe dirleft here actually corresponds to moving up? That seems confusing. Alternatively, maybe the directions are mislabeled, but according to the problem statement, the directions are given, so I need to follow them as per the given movements.

Looking at the movement from pos11 to pos21 is dirright. pos11 is (1,1), pos21 is (2,1). So moving from pos11 to pos21 is down (south) direction, but according to the problem, the direction is dirright. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, maybe the directions are labeled differently. For example, dirright could correspond to moving east (column increases), dirleft to west (column decreases), dirup to north (row decreases), dirdown to south (row increases). But in the movement from pos11 to pos21, which is from (1,1) to (2,1), that's moving south (row increases by 1). However, according to the movement given, that direction is dirright. That doesn't align. Wait, perhaps the directions are named based on the direction you face when moving. Maybe moving dirright from pos11 takes you east, but pos11 to pos21 is south. So perhaps the movement directions are not standard. This is confusing. Let me look at another example. For pos12 to pos22 is dirright. pos12 is (1,2) to pos22 (2,2), which is south. So dirright here seems to be moving south. Alternatively, perhaps the directions are named based on how the movement is possible. Maybe the directions are arbitrary and just labels. For example, the movement from pos11 to pos21 is via dirright, which is a valid direction, but we just need to follow the allowed moves as per the given connections.

This complicates planning because the directions are not the standard cardinal directions. So, to model the movement, I need to see the allowed transitions. For example, from pos51, the allowed moves are to pos41 via dirleft and to pos52 via dirdown.

So the agent is at pos51. To move towards pos23, the agent needs to go through pos41, then pos31, pos21, pos22, etc. Let's try to map a path from pos51 to pos23.

Starting at pos51. Let's see possible moves:

pos51 can go to pos41 (dirleft) or pos52 (dirdown). Since we need to go up (since pos23 is higher up), perhaps moving dirleft to pos41. Then from pos41, possible moves: dirleft to pos31, dirdown to pos42, or dirright to pos51 (but we came from there). So dirleft to pos31. Then from pos31, dirleft to pos21. From pos21, possible moves: dirleft to pos11, dirright to pos31 (back), dirdown to pos22. So dirdown to pos22. Then from pos22, possible moves: dirleft to pos12, dirright to pos32, dirup to pos21, dirdown to pos23. Wait, pos23 is where the stone is. So the stone is at pos23. So the agent needs to get to a position adjacent to pos23 to push it. Since the stone is at pos23, the agent needs to be at a location adjacent to pos23 in a direction that allows pushing. Let's look at the allowed movements around pos23.

From the movement list, pos23 can be reached from pos13 (dirleft), pos33 (dirright), pos22 (dirup), pos24 (dirdown). So to push the stone from pos23 to pos22 (which is a non-goal), or pos24 (non-goal), or pos13 (non-goal), or pos33 (non-goal). But the goal is to get the stone to pos12, which is a goal location. So the agent needs to push the stone from pos23 towards pos12.

Wait, pos12 is a goal. How can the stone get there? Let's see the path. The stone is at pos23. To get to pos12, the agent would need to push it up from pos23 to pos13 (if possible), then from pos13 to pos12. But pos12 is a goal. So the plan would be: move the agent to pos23's adjacent position, then push the stone towards pos13, then from pos13 to pos12.

But first, how does the agent reach a position adjacent to pos23. Let's see. The agent is currently at pos51. Let's outline the path:

pos51 → pos41 (dirleft)
pos41 → pos31 (dirleft)
pos31 → pos21 (dirleft)
pos21 → pos22 (dirdown)
pos22 → pos23 (dirdown) → but wait, can the agent move directly to pos23? Because the stone is at pos23. So the location pos23 is not clear, right? Wait, in the initial state, "Location pos23 is clear" is stated. Wait, but the stone1 is at pos23. So maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, looking back at the original state:

"stone1 is at location pos23"

But in the list of locations that are clear, "Location pos23 is clear". That's conflicting. Because if a stone is at pos23, then pos23 is not clear. But according to the problem statement, the original state includes "stone1 is at location pos23" and "Location pos23 is clear". That seems contradictory. But maybe "clear" refers to the presence of the agent. Because in the problem description, each position may contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. So "clear" means that there's no agent or stone there? Wait, but the effects of the move action include making the location clear. So when the agent moves from l_from to l_to, l_from becomes clear (no agent there), and l_to is occupied. So "clear" means that neither the agent nor a stone is present.

But in the original state, "stone1 is at location pos23" and "Location pos23 is clear". That's a contradiction unless "clear" refers only to the agent. Wait, the problem statement says: "each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty". So "clear" would mean empty. But then if a stone is there, it's not clear. So the initial state is inconsistent. But according to the original state given:

The original state includes "stone1 is at location pos23" and "Location pos23 is clear". That must be an error. But perhaps in this problem, "clear" refers only to the agent's presence. So a location is clear if the agent is not there. But stones can be there and the location is considered clear. That would resolve the contradiction, but that's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement has a mistake, but we have to proceed with the given information.

Assuming that "Location pos23 is clear" is correct, even though the stone is there. But that doesn't make sense. So perhaps the initial state has a typo, and the stone is at pos23 but pos23 is not clear. But according to the problem statement, the user provided:

"stone1 is at location pos23"

"Location pos23 is clear"

So according to the problem, pos23 has the stone, but it's considered clear. That must be wrong. Maybe "clear" in this context means that the agent is not there. So a location can have a stone and still be clear. That's possible. So when checking preconditions for move actions, the location l_to must be clear (no agent or stone). Wait, no. For the move action, the precondition is that l_to is clear. But if a stone is at l_to, then it's not clear, so the move can't happen. So the problem statement's initial state is conflicting. That's a problem. But perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that "clear" means the location has neither the agent nor a stone. Therefore, the initial state is invalid. But the user must have provided it correctly. Alternatively, maybe "clear" refers to the agent's absence. So stones don't affect the clearness. But that would mean that a location with a stone is considered clear as long as the agent isn't there. That would resolve the contradiction.

In that case, the agent can move to a location that has a stone. But according to the problem description, the agent can only move to a clear location. So if clear means no agent, then even if there's a stone, the agent can't move there. Because the move action requires l_to to be clear. So this is a problem.

This is a critical issue. Let me recheck the problem statement.

Original state:

- "stone1 is at location pos23"
- "Location pos23 is clear"

If "clear" means that the location is empty (no agent, no stone), then this is a contradiction. Therefore, the initial state is invalid. But since the problem is given, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Maybe "clear" refers only to the agent's presence. So a location is clear if the agent is not there, regardless of stones. Therefore, in the initial state, pos23 has a stone but is clear because the agent is not there. Then, the move action's precondition (l_to must be clear) would allow the agent to move to a location with a stone, which isn't possible. But according to the problem statement, the move action's precondition is that l_to is clear. So if clear includes being free of stones, then the move to l_to is impossible if there's a stone there. But in the initial state, pos23 has a stone and is clear, which is impossible. Therefore, there's a mistake in the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps "clear" is only about the agent. Stones don't affect whether a location is clear. So a location with a stone is considered clear if the agent is not there. That way, the initial state makes sense: pos23 has a stone, but since the agent isn't there, it's considered clear. But when the agent moves, they can only go to a location that's clear (i.e., no agent), even if there's a stone there. That seems odd, but maybe that's the case.

But according to the problem description, each location can contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. So a location can't have both. Therefore, in the initial state, pos23 has a stone, so it's not empty. Therefore, "Location pos23 is clear" must be false, but it's stated as true. This is a contradiction.

This suggests that there's a mistake in the problem statement. However, since the user provided this, we have to proceed. Perhaps "clear" in the initial state refers to the absence of the agent, not the stone. So even if a stone is present, the location is considered clear as long as the agent isn't there. In that case, the move action's precondition (l_to must be clear) would mean that the agent can move to a location that has a stone, which contradicts the problem description's statement that a location can have either the agent, a stone, or be empty. Therefore, this is impossible.

Given this confusion, perhaps the problem statement has an error, but for the sake of solving, I'll assume that "clear" means the location has neither the agent nor a stone. Therefore, the initial state is invalid. But since the user says that "Location pos23 is clear" and "stone1 is at pos23", there's a mistake. However, perhaps the stone's presence overrides the clear status. Or maybe the initial state is correct, and there's a misunderstanding.

Alternatively, maybe "clear" is a separate flag. But according to the problem statement, each position may contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. So a position with a stone is not empty. Therefore, the initial state has a contradiction. This is a problem. But I need to proceed, perhaps assuming that the initial state is correct as given, and that "clear" refers to the agent's absence. Therefore, the stone's presence doesn't affect the clear status. So the agent can move to a location with a stone, but that's not possible according to the problem's own rules. This is a problem.

Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo, and the stone is at pos33, and pos23 is clear. But I have to work with the given data.

Given that the problem states that stone1 is at pos23 and pos23 is clear, but according to the problem's own logic, that's impossible. This is a contradiction. However, since this is part of the problem statement, perhaps the intended meaning is that pos23 is clear (i.e., the agent is not there), even though the stone is present. Therefore, when the agent wants to move to pos23, since it has a stone, the move is not allowed because the location is not clear (as it contains a stone). But according to the initial state, pos23 is clear. So there's a problem here.

But maybe "clear" in the problem refers to the presence of the agent. So a location is clear if the agent is not there. Stones don't affect that. Therefore, the move action's precondition (l_to must be clear) means that the agent is not there. So even if there's a stone, the agent can move there, but that contradicts the problem's own statement that each position can contain either agent, stone, or be empty. Therefore, this seems impossible.

Given this confusion, I'll proceed under the assumption that the initial state is correct, and that "clear" means the agent is not present, regardless of stones. Therefore, the agent can move to a location with a stone, which is impossible according to the problem's own rules. But this is the only way to resolve the contradiction.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial state has a mistake in stating that pos23 is clear, and actually, it's not clear. But since the user provided that, I can't change it. Therefore, I'll proceed.

So, back to the plan. The agent is at pos51. The stone is at pos23. The goal is to get the stone to a goal location (pos12). So the steps would be:

1. Move the agent from pos51 to pos23's adjacent positions to be able to push the stone.

But according to the movement rules, the agent can only move to clear locations. Since pos23 has a stone, but the initial state says pos23 is clear (agent not there), the agent can move to pos23? But according to the problem's description, a location can't have both agent and stone. So if the agent moves to pos23, which has a stone, that's invalid. Therefore, this suggests that the initial state is wrong. Therefore, the problem is ill-posed. But the user expects a solution.

Assuming that pos23 is not clear (since the stone is there), then the agent can't move there. Therefore, the agent needs to get to a position adjacent to pos23 to push the stone.

So the agent's path would be to get to pos22, pos24, pos13, or pos33 to push the stone.

Given that, let's find a path from pos51 to pos22.

From pos51:

pos51 → pos41 (dirleft)

pos41 → pos31 (dirleft)

pos31 → pos21 (dirleft)

pos21 → pos22 (dirdown)

So agent is now at pos22. From here, can they push the stone at pos23 to pos13 (dirup), but pos13 is not a goal. Or to pos24 (dirdown), also not a goal. Or to pos33 (dirright), not a goal. The only goal is pos12. So to get the stone to pos12, the agent needs to push it from pos23 to pos13 (dirleft), then from pos13 to pos12 (dirup). But pos12 is a goal.

So first, the agent needs to push stone1 from pos23 to pos13. Then, from pos13 to pos12.

But to push from pos23 to pos13, the agent needs to be at pos23's adjacent position in the direction of the push. To push to pos13 (which is north of pos23), the agent needs to be south of pos23 (i.e., pos33?), but wait, pos23 is at row2, column3. pos13 is row1, column3. So pushing from pos23 to pos13 would require the agent to be at pos23's south (pos33) and push north. Wait, but according to the movement directions, how is that possible? Or maybe the agent needs to be at the position adjacent in the direction they are pushing.

Wait, the preconditions for pushtogoal or pushtonongoal are:

For example, "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": The agent must be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (stone's current position) in direction d. Then, the stone moves from l_from to l_to in direction d. So the direction d must be the direction from l_p to l_from, and then from l_from to l_to.

Wait, the preconditions are:

(iv) you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d.

(v) you can get from l_from to l_to following direction d.

So the direction d is the same for both steps. So the agent is at l_p, moves in direction d to l_from (pushing the stone), then the stone moves in direction d to l_to.

So for example, if the agent is at l_p = pos24, and the stone is at l_from = pos23, and direction d is dirup (assuming that direction allows moving from pos24 to pos23 via dirup), then the stone would be pushed to l_to = pos22 (if that's the direction).

Wait, but according to the movement list:

From pos23 to pos13 is dirleft. Let me check. Looking at the movement list:

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirleft"

So dirleft from pos23 takes you to pos13. But pos23 is (2,3), pos13 is (1,3). So dirleft here corresponds to moving north (row decreases by 1). So direction dirleft in this context is north. That's confusing, but according to the movement list, that's the case.

So to push the stone from pos23 to pos13 (dirleft), the agent needs to be at l_p, which is a location that can move to pos23 via dirleft. Looking at the movement list, pos24 can move to pos23 via dirup. Wait, no. Let me check:

Looking at the movement list for pos24:

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos14 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos34 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos23 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos25 following direction dirdown"

So from pos24, dirup takes you to pos23. So if the agent is at pos24, they can push the stone from pos23 to pos13 by using direction dirleft. Wait, no. Because for the pushtogoal action, the direction d must be the same for moving from l_p to l_from and from l_from to l_to.

So, for example, the agent is at pos24 (l_p = pos24), stone is at pos23 (l_from = pos23). To push the stone to l_to = pos13 (dirleft), the agent must be able to move from pos24 to pos23 via direction d, and the stone must move from pos23 to pos13 via direction d. But according to the movement list, from pos24 to pos23 is dirup. From pos23 to pos13 is dirleft. So direction d would have to be dirup for the first part and dirleft for the second, which is not possible. Therefore, this approach won't work.

Alternatively, the agent needs to be at a position where they can reach l_from (pos23) via direction d, and then the stone moves via direction d to l_to. So the direction d must be the same for both. So to push the stone from pos23 to pos13 (which requires direction dirleft), the agent must be at a position l_p that can move to pos23 via dirleft. Looking at the movement list, which locations can move to pos23 via dirleft? Looking at the list:

"You may move from location pos13 to location pos23 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"

Wait, pos33 moving dirleft to pos23. So if the agent is at pos33, they can move dirleft to pos23. Then, the stone can be pushed dirleft to pos13. So the agent would be at pos33 (l_p = pos33), stone at pos23 (l_from = pos23), pushing to pos13 (l_to = pos13) with direction dirleft. Then, the stone is at pos13. Then, the agent needs to push it from pos13 to pos12.

To push from pos13 to pos12, the agent needs to be at a position that allows moving to pos13 via direction d, and then the stone moves to pos12 via the same direction. Looking at pos13's movements:

"You may move from location pos13 to location pos23 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos12 to location pos13 following direction dirdown"

"You may move from location pos14 to location pos13 following direction dirup"

So to push from pos13 to pos12, the direction would be dirup (since moving from pos13 to pos12 is dirup). The agent needs to be at a position that can move to pos13 via dirup. For example, pos14 can move to pos13 via dirup. So if the agent is at pos14, they can push the stone from pos13 to pos12 (dirup). Then, pos12 is a goal.

So the plan steps would be:

1. Move agent from pos51 to pos33 (path: pos51 → pos41 → pos31 → pos32 → pos33)
2. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos13 using pushtonongoal (since pos13 is not a goal)
3. Move agent from pos13 to pos14 (or another adjacent position to push)
4. Push stone1 from pos13 to pos12 using pushtogoal (since pos12 is a goal)

But let's break it down step by step.

First, moving the agent from pos51 to pos33:

pos51 → pos41 (dirleft)
pos41 → pos31 (dirleft)
pos31 → pos32 (dirdown) [from pos31's movements: pos31 can move to pos32 via dirdown]
pos32 → pos33 (dirdown) [from pos32's movements: pos32 to pos33 via dirdown]

Now, agent is at pos33. From here, can push stone1 from pos23 to pos13 via dirleft. Let's verify:

Check preconditions for pushtonongoal (since pos13 is not a goal):

- Agent p (player1) is at l_p (pos33)
- Stone s (stone1) is at l_from (pos23)
- l_to (pos13) is clear (since initially, pos13 is clear)
- Can move from pos33 to pos23 via dirleft: According to movement list, pos33 to pos23 is dirleft? Let me check. Looking at the movement list for pos33: "You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft". Yes.
- Can move from pos23 to pos13 via dirleft: Yes, as per movement list.
- l_to (pos13) is not a goal (correct, since pos13 is not a goal).

So the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirleft

After this action, the agent is at pos23, stone1 is at pos13. Then, the agent needs to move to a position where they can push the stone from pos13 to pos12.

But pos12 is a goal. So the next action is to push to goal.

To push from pos13 to pos12 (dirup), the agent needs to be at a position that can move to pos13 via dirup, and pos13 to pos12 via dirup.

Looking at the movement list for pos13:

"You may move from location pos13 to location pos12 following direction dirup" — yes. So direction dirup.

The agent needs to be at a position l_p that can move to pos13 via dirup. Looking at the movement list, pos14 can move to pos13 via dirup. So if the agent is at pos14, they can push the stone from pos13 to pos12 via dirup.

So after the first push, the agent is at pos23. They need to get to pos14.

Path from pos23 to pos14:

pos23 → pos24 (dirdown)
pos24 → pos14 (dirleft)
But wait, movement from pos24 to pos14 is via dirleft. Let's see:

From pos23, movements allowed:

- dirleft (to pos13), dirright (to pos33), dirup (to pos22), dirdown (to pos24).

So agent is at pos23 after the first push. They can move dirdown to pos24.

pos23 → pos24 (dirdown)

Then, from pos24, dirleft to pos14.

pos24 → pos14 (dirleft)

Now, agent is at pos14. Then, push the stone from pos13 to pos12.

Check preconditions for pushtogoal:

- Agent is at pos14 (l_p = pos14)
- Stone is at pos13 (l_from = pos13)
- l_to = pos12 (goal)
- Can move from pos14 to pos13 via dirup (yes, movement from pos14 to pos13 is dirup)
- Can move from pos13 to pos12 via dirup (yes)
- l_to is a goal (pos12 is a goal)

So action:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirup

This should place the stone at pos12, achieving the goal.

So the steps are:

1. Move from pos51 to pos33 via several steps.
2. Push stone from pos23 to pos13.
3. Move from pos23 to pos14 via pos24.
4. Push stone from pos13 to pos12.

But wait, after the first push (pushtonongoal), the agent is at pos23 (l_from), which is now clear. Because the effects of pushtonongoal include agent moving to l_from (pos23) and stone moving to l_to (pos13). So after the first push, the agent is at pos23. So the next step is to move from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown), then to pos14 (dirleft). Then push to pos12.

So the full plan would be:

move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft
move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown
move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirleft
move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirup

But wait, the movement from pos31 to pos32 is possible? Let's check the allowed moves for pos31:

"You may move from location pos31 to location pos21 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos31 to location pos41 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos31 to location pos32 following direction dirdown"

Yes, so pos31 can move to pos32 via dirdown. Correct.

Then pos32 to pos33 via dirdown? Let's check pos32's allowed moves:

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos32 to location pos31 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown"

Yes, pos32 to pos33 via dirdown.

Then pushtonongoal from pos33 to pos23 to pos13 via dirleft. Then agent is at pos23.

Then move from pos23 to pos24 via dirdown (allowed, as per movement list).

Then move from pos24 to pos14 via dirleft (movement list: pos24 to pos14 via dirleft).

Then pushtogoal from pos14 to pos13 to pos12 via dirup.

This seems to work. But let's check if all preconditions are met at each step.

First action: move player1 from pos51 to pos41 via dirleft. Preconditions: agent is at pos51, pos41 is clear. According to initial state, pos41 is clear. Yes.

Second action: move from pos41 to pos31 via dirleft. pos31 is clear? Initially, pos31 is clear. Yes.

Third action: move from pos31 to pos32 via dirdown. pos32 is clear. Initially, yes.

Fourth action: move from pos32 to pos33 via dirdown. pos33 is clear. Yes.

Fifth action: pushtonongoal. Agent at pos33, stone at pos23. pos13 is clear. Yes. Then after pushing, agent is at pos23, stone at pos13.

Sixth action: move from pos23 to pos24 via dirdown. pos24 is clear? Initially, pos24 is clear. After previous actions, yes. Because after pushing, pos24 hasn't been touched.

Seventh action: move from pos24 to pos14 via dirleft. pos14 is clear? Yes.

Eighth action: pushtogoal. Agent at pos14, stone at pos13. pos12 is clear. Initially, pos12 is clear. Yes. So this should work.

But is there a shorter path? Let's see. Can we reduce the number of steps?

Alternative path: After moving to pos33 and pushing, the agent is at pos23. From there, can they push the stone from pos13 to pos12 directly? But to do that, the agent needs to be at pos14. So moving from pos23 to pos24 to pos14.

Another alternative: Could the agent reach pos22 earlier and push the stone from pos23 to pos22, but pos22 is not a goal. That's not useful. Or push to pos24, but that's also not a goal.

The current plan has 8 steps. Is there a shorter way?

Alternative approach: Maybe the agent can take a different path to reach pos23's adjacent positions.

From pos51 to pos41 (dirleft), pos41 to pos42 (dirdown), pos42 to pos43 (dirdown), etc. But that seems longer.

Alternatively, after moving to pos33, perhaps there's a way to push the stone directly to pos12, but that's impossible in one step.

Another idea: After pushing the stone to pos13, the agent is at pos23. Then, move to pos13 (from pos23 via dirleft) but pos13 has the stone now. Wait, no. After the first push, the stone is at pos13, so pos13 is not clear (has a stone). So the agent can't move there. So the agent must move from pos23 to pos24, then to pos14.

Another idea: After the first push, the agent is at pos23. Can they move to pos22, then to pos12, then push the stone from pos13 to pos12. But pos12 is a goal, and the stone is at pos13. The agent would need to be at pos14 or pos12 to push it.

If the agent moves from pos23 to pos22 (dirup), then pos22 to pos12 (dirleft). Then, from pos12, can they push the stone from pos13 to pos12? The agent is at pos12. To push the stone from pos13 to pos12 (dirup), the agent needs to be south of pos13 (pos23 or pos14). But pos12 is north of pos13. So direction would be dirup from pos13 to pos12. So to push, the agent would need to be at pos14, as before.

Alternatively, the agent at pos12 could push the stone from pos13 to pos12 by being at pos13's south, but pos13's south is pos23. The agent would need to be at pos23, but the stone is at pos13. So that's not possible.

Thus, the initial plan seems optimal. Let's count the steps:

1. move pos51 to pos41
2. move pos41 to pos31
3. move pos31 to pos32
4. move pos32 to pos33
5. pushtonongoal to pos13
6. move pos23 to pos24
7. move pos24 to pos14
8. pushtogoal to pos12

Total of 8 actions. Can this be optimized?

What if the agent takes a different route to reach pos33 faster?

From pos51 to pos41 (dirleft) → 1
pos41 to pos31 (dirleft) → 2
pos31 to pos32 (dirdown) →3
pos32 to pos33 (dirdown) →4

Alternatively, is there a way to go from pos51 to pos52 via dirdown, then move east? But pos52 is column 2. Then pos52 to pos42 (dirleft), etc. But that may not be shorter.

Another idea: After moving to pos31, instead of going down to pos32, can we go right to pos21? Wait, pos31's movements: dirleft (to pos21), dirright (to pos41), dirdown (to pos32). So from pos31, moving dirleft to pos21.

Then from pos21 to pos22 (dirdown), pos22 to pos23 (dirdown). But pos23 has the stone, so agent can't move there. So if the agent is at pos23, which is occupied by the stone, but according to the initial state, pos23 is clear (contradiction). Assuming the stone is there, the agent can't move there. So this path is invalid.

So the original path seems necessary.

Is there a way to reduce the number of move actions?

After pushing the stone to pos13, the agent is at pos23. Then, moving to pos24 (dirdown) and pos14 (dirleft) is two steps. Is there a way to go directly from pos23 to pos14?

Looking at pos23's allowed moves:

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos23 to location pos33 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos23 to location pos22 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos23 to location pos24 following direction dirdown"

So from pos23, the agent can go to pos24 via dirdown, then pos24 to pos14 via dirleft. That's two steps. No direct path.

Alternatively, from pos23, can the agent move to pos13 (dirleft) but that's where the stone is, so it's not clear. So no.

So the two steps are necessary.

Thus, the plan seems to be 8 actions. But perhaps there's a shorter way.

Alternative approach: Instead of pushing the stone from pos23 to pos13, then to pos12, can the agent push it directly from pos23 to pos12 in one action? Let's see. For that, the agent would need to be at a position that allows pushing from pos23 to pos12. But according to the movement list, pos23 to pos12 is not a direct move. The path from pos23 to pos12 would require moving up twice and left once, but as per allowed moves, that's not possible. So no.

Another idea: Push the stone from pos23 to pos22 (dirup), then from pos22 to pos12 (dirleft). But pos22 to pos12 is allowed. Let's see.

First, push from pos23 to pos22. The agent needs to be at pos24 (dirdown from pos23 to pos24). Wait, no. To push from pos23 to pos22 (dirup), the agent must be south of pos23. So pos23's south is pos33. So agent at pos33 can push north to pos23, but that's where the stone is. Wait, no. To push from pos23 to pos22 (dirup), the agent needs to be at pos23's south (pos33), then push north (dirup) to pos23, then the stone moves dirup to pos22. But the stone is already at pos23. Wait, no. The agent can't be at pos33 and push the stone at pos23 to pos22, because that requires moving the stone north. But the agent is south of the stone. To push the stone north, the agent needs to be south of the stone and push north. So the agent would be at pos33, push the stone at pos23 north to pos13. That's what was done before.

Alternatively, if the agent is at pos22, can they push the stone at pos23 to pos24 (dirdown). But pos24 is not a goal.

Thus, the initial plan seems to be the optimal path with 8 actions. But let's check again.

Wait, after the first push, the stone is at pos13. The agent is at pos23. Then the agent moves to pos24, then to pos14. Then pushes to pos12.

Alternative idea: From pos23, move to pos24 (dirdown), then to pos34 (dirright), then to pos44 (dirright), etc. But that's longer.

No, the shortest path is as previously.

So the plan is 8 steps. But perhaps there's a shorter way.

Wait, after moving to pos33 and pushing to pos13, the agent is at pos23. Then, can the agent move from pos23 to pos13 (dirleft) — but pos13 now has the stone, so it's not clear. So no. Then, the agent must move south to pos24, then west to pos14.

Alternative approach: Can the agent, after pushing the stone to pos13, move east to pos24, then north to pos14? No, because pos24 is south of pos14. To get to pos14 from pos24, you need to move dirleft (west) to pos14. So pos24 to pos14 is dirleft.

Yes, that's two moves: pos23 → pos24 (dirdown), pos24 → pos14 (dirleft).

So that's correct.

Another check: After the first push, the stone is at pos13. The agent is at pos23. Then, when moving to pos24, the pos24 is clear? Initially, pos24 is clear. After the agent moves there, pos24 is no longer clear. Then when moving to pos14, pos14 must be clear. Initially, pos14 is clear. Yes.

Then, pushing from pos14 to pos13 to pos12.

Yes.

So the plan is valid. Is there a way to reduce the number of steps?

What if the agent, after moving to pos33, pushes the stone to pos13, then moves from pos23 to pos13 (but it's occupied by the stone), so not possible. So no.

Another idea: Maybe the agent can take a different path to reach pos14 faster.

For example, after moving to pos31, instead of going to pos32 and pos33, go to pos21, then pos22, then pos23 (but pos23 has the stone, so can't move there). Then pos22 to pos12 (dirleft), but the stone is at pos23. Not helpful.

Alternatively, from pos51, move to pos52 (dirdown), then pos52 to pos42 (dirleft), pos42 to pos32 (dirleft), pos32 to pos22 (dirleft), pos22 to pos23 (dirdown) — but pos23 has the stone. So agent can't move there. So this path is blocked.

Thus, the original path seems to be the optimal one with 8 steps. I don't see a shorter way.
