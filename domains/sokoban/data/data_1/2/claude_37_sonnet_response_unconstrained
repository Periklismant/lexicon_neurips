Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. We have a 5x5 grid, with coordinates posXY (X,Y from 1 to 5).
2. The agent (player1) is initially at position pos12.
3. There's a stone (stone1) at position pos24.
4. The goal position is pos35.
5. The task is to move the stone to the goal position (to make "stone1 is at a goal location" true).

I need to develop a plan to push the stone from pos24 to pos35. Let's visualize the grid first:

```
1  2  3  4  5
1 .  P  .  .  .
2 .  .  .  S  .
3 .  .  .  .  G
4 .  .  .  .  .
5 .  .  .  .  .
```

Where:
- P is the player (at pos12)
- S is the stone (at pos24)
- G is the goal location (at pos35)
- . represents an empty cell

I need to find a path for the player to reach a position where they can push the stone towards the goal. Since the stone is at pos24 and the goal is at pos35, the stone needs to be pushed from pos24 to pos34 (the cell to the left of pos35), and then from pos34 to pos35 (the goal).

Let's first see if the player can reach the right position to push the stone in the right direction.

To push the stone from pos24 to pos34 (towards the goal), the player needs to be at pos14 (to push it from the left). So, let's first get the player to pos14:

1. Starting from pos12, the player can move to pos13 (going down).
2. From pos13, the player can move to pos14 (going down).

Now, the player is at pos14 and can push the stone from pos24 to pos34:

3. Player pushes the stone from pos24 to pos34.

After this action, the player is at pos24 and the stone is at pos34. Now, to push the stone from pos34 to pos35 (the goal), the player needs to be at pos33 (to push it from up). So:

4. From pos24, the player can move to pos23 (going up).
5. From pos23, the player can move to pos33 (going right).

Now, the player is at pos33 and can push the stone from pos34 to pos35 (the goal):

6. Player pushes the stone from pos34 to pos35.

After this action, the stone is at the goal position (pos35), which completes the task.

Let's formalize these actions using the provided action format:

1. "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown"
2. "move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown"
3. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright"
4. "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup"
5. "move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright"
6. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown"

Actually, I made a minor mistake. The precondition for "pushtonongoal" requires that the target location is not a goal location. Similarly, for "pushtogoal", the target location must be a goal location. So, the 3rd and 6th actions are correctly chosen.

Let's double-check the entire plan:

1. Player starts at pos12.
2. "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown" - Player moves to pos13.
3. "move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown" - Player moves to pos14.
4. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright" - Player pushes the stone from pos24 to pos34. After this action, the player is at pos24 and the stone is at pos34.
5. "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup" - Player moves to pos23.
6. "move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright" - Player moves to pos33.
7. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown" - Player pushes the stone from pos34 to pos35. After this action, the player is at pos34 and the stone is at pos35, which is the goal.

However, I think there's an inconsistency in the problem statement. If the player is at pos12, it would be "dirdown" to go to pos13. But according to the problem statement:

"You may move from location pos12 to location pos22 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos11 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos13 following direction dirdown"

It seems like dirdown is used to move from pos12 to pos13, which is a bit counterintuitive. But looking at more examples, I think the directions are as follows:
- dirright: Move in the first coordinate (horizontal right)
- dirleft: Move in the first coordinate (horizontal left)
- dirdown: Move in the second coordinate (vertical down)
- dirup: Move in the second coordinate (vertical up)

Given this, let's relabel the grid for clarity:

```
    1    2    3    4    5
1 pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
2 pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
3 pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
4 pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
5 pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

With the player at pos12 and the stone at pos24, and the goal at pos35, I need to revise my plan.

Let me think about the directions again. It seems like the direction system is as follows:
- dirright: Move to a position with a higher first coordinate (e.g., from posXY to pos(X+1)Y)
- dirleft: Move to a position with a lower first coordinate (e.g., from posXY to pos(X-1)Y)
- dirdown: Move to a position with a higher second coordinate (e.g., from posXY to posX(Y+1))
- dirup: Move to a position with a lower second coordinate (e.g., from posXY to posX(Y-1))

So, to push the stone from pos24 to pos34 (towards the goal), the player needs to be at pos14 (to push it horizontally right). And to push the stone from pos34 to pos35 (the goal), the player needs to be at pos33 (to push it vertically down).

Let me confirm with the given state descriptions:
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos22 following direction dirright" - This means moving from (1,2) to (2,2), which is horizontal right. This confirms my interpretation.

Given this understanding, the plan is:

1. Player starts at pos12.
2. "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown" - Player moves from (1,2) to (1,3).
3. "move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown" - Player moves from (1,3) to (1,4).
4. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright" - Player pushes the stone from (2,4) to (3,4) moving horizontally right. After this action, the player is at pos24 and the stone is at pos34.
5. "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup" - Player moves from (2,4) to (2,3).
6. "move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright" - Player moves from (2,3) to (3,3).
7. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown" - Player pushes the stone from (3,4) to (3,5) moving vertically down. After this action, the player is at pos34 and the stone is at pos35, which is the goal.

However, there's an issue with my interpretation. The grid seems to be 5x5, but if I follow the above interpretation, pos35 would be at coordinates (3,5), which is outside the 5x5 grid.

Let me re-analyze the example "You may move from location pos12 to location pos13 following direction dirdown".
pos12 is (1,2) and pos13 is (1,3). So going from (1,2) to (1,3) is considered "dirdown". This suggests dirdown increases the second coordinate.

Actually, I think the grid labeling is:

```
    1    2    3    4    5
1 pos11 pos21 pos31 pos41 pos51
2 pos12 pos22 pos32 pos42 pos52
3 pos13 pos23 pos33 pos43 pos53
4 pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
5 pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

Where the first number in posXY is the column (horizontal) and the second number is the row (vertical).

With this interpretation, the player starts at (1,2) (i.e., the cell in the 1st column, 2nd row), the stone is at (2,4) (i.e., the cell in the 2nd column, 4th row), and the goal is at (3,5) (i.e., the cell in the 3rd column, 5th row).

Let's re-visualize the grid:

```
1  2  3  4  5
1 .  .  .  .  .
2 P  .  .  .  .
3 .  .  .  .  .
4 .  S  .  .  .
5 .  .  G  .  .
```

Where:
- P is the player (at pos12)
- S is the stone (at pos24)
- G is the goal location (at pos35)
- . represents an empty cell

Let's revisit the directions:
- dirright: Move from column X to column X+1 (e.g., from posXY to pos(X+1)Y)
- dirleft: Move from column X to column X-1 (e.g., from posXY to pos(X-1)Y)
- dirdown: Move from row Y to row Y+1 (e.g., from posXY to posX(Y+1))
- dirup: Move from row Y to row Y-1 (e.g., from posXY to posX(Y-1))

Given this understanding, I need to:
1. Push the stone from pos24 to pos34 (towards the goal).
2. Push the stone from pos34 to pos35 (to the goal).

To push the stone from pos24 to pos34, the player needs to be at pos14. To push the stone from pos34 to pos35, the player needs to be at pos33.

Let's reconstruct the plan:

Starting configuration:
- Player at pos12 (1,2)
- Stone at pos24 (2,4)
- Goal at pos35 (3,5)

Actually, let's double-check the problem statement again to ensure I understand the grid coordinates correctly. 

Given these examples from the problem statement:
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" - This suggests moving from (1,1) to (2,1) is a right movement.
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown" - This suggests moving from (1,1) to (1,2) is a down movement.

I think the correct interpretation of the grid is:
- First coordinate (X in posXY) represents the horizontal position (column).
- Second coordinate (Y in posXY) represents the vertical position (row).
- dirright: Move from (X,Y) to (X+1,Y)
- dirleft: Move from (X,Y) to (X-1,Y)
- dirdown: Move from (X,Y) to (X,Y+1)
- dirup: Move from (X,Y) to (X,Y-1)

With this interpretation, the grid layout is:

```
    Column (X)
    1    2    3    4    5
1 pos11 pos21 pos31 pos41 pos51
2 pos12 pos22 pos32 pos42 pos52
Row (Y)
3 pos13 pos23 pos33 pos43 pos53
4 pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
5 pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

And the starting configuration is:
- Player at pos12 (1,2)
- Stone at pos24 (2,4)
- Goal at pos35 (3,5)

And visually on the grid, it would look like:
```
X  1  2  3  4  5
Y
1  .  .  .  .  .
2  P  .  .  .  .
3  .  .  .  .  .
4  .  S  .  .  .
5  .  .  G  .  .
```

Given this, to push the stone from pos24 (2,4) to pos34 (3,4) so that it's horizontally aligned with the goal, the player needs to be at pos14 (1,4).

To then push the stone from pos34 (3,4) to pos35 (3,5) to get it to the goal, the player needs to be at pos33 (3,3).

Let's plan the moves:

1. Player starts at pos12 (1,2).
2. The player needs to move to pos14 (1,4) to push the stone:
   a. "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown" - Player moves from (1,2) to (1,3).
   b. "move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown" - Player moves from (1,3) to (1,4).

3. From pos14 (1,4), the player can push the stone from pos24 (2,4) to pos34 (3,4):
   "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright" - Player pushes the stone from (2,4) to (3,4) moving horizontally right. After this action, the player is at pos24 (2,4) and the stone is at pos34 (3,4).

4. The player now needs to move from pos24 (2,4) to pos33 (3,3) to push the stone from pos34 (3,4) to pos35 (3,5):
   a. "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup" - Player moves from (2,4) to (2,3).
   b. "move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright" - Player moves from (2,3) to (3,3).

5. From pos33 (3,3), the player can push the stone from pos34 (3,4) to pos35 (3,5):
   "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown" - Player pushes the stone from (3,4) to (3,5) moving vertically down. After this action, the player is at pos34 (3,4) and the stone is at pos35 (3,5), which is the goal.

This plan should achieve the task of getting the stone to the goal position. Let me review it once more to ensure it's valid:

1. Player starts at pos12 (1,2).
2. "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown" - Player moves to pos13 (1,3).
3. "move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown" - Player moves to pos14 (1,4).
4. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright" - Player pushes the stone from pos24 (2,4) to pos34 (3,4). After this action, the player is at pos24 (2,4) and the stone is at pos34 (3,4).
5. "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup" - Player moves to pos23 (2,3).
6. "move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright" - Player moves to pos33 (3,3).
7. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown" - Player pushes the stone from pos34 (3,4) to pos35 (3,5). After this action, the player is at pos34 (3,4) and the stone is at pos35 (3,5), which is the goal.

Wait, I think I've been making a mistake all along. Let me re-read the problem statement and understand the grid coordinates correctly.

Given the example "You may move from location pos12 to location pos13 following direction dirdown" and other movement rules, pos13 is considered "down" from pos12. This means that as the second coordinate (Y) increases, you go down. This is a typical convention in grid-based problems, where the origin (0,0) is at the top-left corner.

So, the grid layout is:

```
    Column (X)
    1    2    3    4    5
1 pos11 pos21 pos31 pos41 pos51
2 pos12 pos22 pos32 pos42 pos52
Row (Y)
3 pos13 pos23 pos33 pos43 pos53
4 pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
5 pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

This layout aligns with the movement rules provided.

Given this layout, the starting configuration is:
- Player at pos12 (1,2)
- Stone at pos24 (2,4)
- Goal at pos35 (3,5)

I think the plan I've constructed aligns with this layout:

1. Player starts at pos12 (1,2).
2. "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown" - Player moves to pos13 (1,3).
3. "move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown" - Player moves to pos14 (1,4).
4. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright" - Player pushes the stone from pos24 (2,4) to pos34 (3,4). After this action, the player is at pos24 (2,4) and the stone is at pos34 (3,4).
5. "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup" - Player moves to pos23 (2,3).
6. "move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright" - Player moves to pos33 (3,3).
7. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown" - Player pushes the stone from pos34 (3,4) to pos35 (3,5). After this action, the player is at pos34 (3,4) and the stone is at pos35 (3,5), which is the goal.

However, let's re-check the preconditions of the actions.

For the "pushtonongoal" action, we need to check:
1. Agent p is at location l_p (player1 is at pos14) - Satisfied.
2. Stone s is at location l_from (stone1 is at pos24) - Satisfied.
3. Location l_to is clear (pos34 is clear) - Satisfied.
4. You can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d (from pos14 to pos24 following dirright) - Satisfied.
5. You can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d (from pos24 to pos34 following dirright) - Satisfied.
6. Location l_to is not a goal location (pos34 is not a goal location) - Satisfied.

For the "pushtogoal" action, we need to check:
1. Agent p is at location l_p (player1 is at pos33) - Satisfied.
2. Stone s is at location l_from (stone1 is at pos34) - Satisfied.
3. Location l_to is clear (pos35 is clear) - Satisfied.
4. You can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d (from pos33 to pos34 following dirdown) - Satisfied.
5. You can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d (from pos34 to pos35 following dirdown) - Satisfied.
6. Location l_to is a goal location (pos35 is a goal location) - Satisfied.

But there's a detail I've been overlooking in the initial state descriptions. It says:
"Location pos12 is clear"
"Location pos24 is clear"

But we also have:
"player1 is at location pos12"
"stone1 is at location pos24"

These seem contradictory. A location can't be both clear and have an agent or stone on it.

Let me double-check the full state description to understand this correctly.

Wait, there's one thing that's incorrect. Actually, the problem statement at the beginning explicitly says that:

"Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty."

And there are descriptions indicating that:
"player1 is at location pos12"
"stone1 is at location pos24"

Additionally, I previously parsed these lines as indicating the locations are clear:
"Location pos12 is clear"
"Location pos24 is clear"

But I misinterpreted the final part of the initial state description. The state actually says:
"Location pos12 is not clear"
"Location pos24 is not clear"

So, my understanding of the grid layout is correct, and the initial state is:
- Player at pos12 (1,2)
- Stone at pos24 (2,4)
- Goal at pos35 (3,5)

Actually, on second read, the problem description doesn't say "Location pos12 is not clear" or "Location pos24 is not clear". It simply lists these two locations in the "Location posXY is clear" section after all the other locations.

Regardless, if the player is at pos12 and the stone is at pos24, these locations can't be clear. So, the plan I've constructed still applies.

In summary, the optimal plan to achieve the goal is:

1. "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown" - Player moves from (1,2) to (1,3).
2. "move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown" - Player moves from (1,3) to (1,4).
3. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright" - Player pushes the stone from (2,4) to (3,4). After this, the player is at pos24 and the stone is at pos34.
4. "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup" - Player moves from (2,4) to (2,3).
5. "move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright" - Player moves from (2,3) to (3,3).
6. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown" - Player pushes the stone from (3,4) to (3,5). After this, the player is at pos34 and the stone is at pos35, which is the goal.

I think there's still some confusion around the initial state. It's true that the problem statement says:
"Location pos12 is clear"
"Location pos24 is clear"

But it also says:
"player1 is at location pos12"
"stone1 is at location pos24"

Actually, I notice now that the explanation of the problem says:
"Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty. Each position is flagged as either a goal position or a non-goal position."

So a position can hold both an agent and be flagged as a goal or non-goal. So actually, based on the state description, pos12 AND pos24 both start as clear, and as a non-goal. The agent starts at pos12 (and that isn't contradictory to the location being clear, it seems). But from the action, "move p l_from l_to d", the precondition specifies:
"You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_from, (ii) location l_to is clear, and (iii) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d."

"Location l_to is clear" implies that a location is not clear when it has an agent. And the initial state says locations pos12 and pos24 are clear. But it also says the player is at pos12 and the stone is at pos24. So that's a bit of a contradiction.

Upon further reflection, I think I was misinterpreting the problem. Let's go back and reread carefully. The problem says:

"The original state of the world is the following:
	"player1 is at location pos12"
	"stone1 is at location pos24"
	"Location pos11 is clear"
	"Location pos13 is clear"
    ...
    "Location pos55 is clear"
    ...
    "Location pos12 is clear"
    "Location pos24 is clear"
"

Now let's look at the precondition for moving:
"move p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_from, (ii) location l_to is clear, and (iii) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.

For an action to be executed, its preconditions must be satisfied. If "location l_to is clear" is a precondition for moving to a location, it implies that a location can transition between being "clear" and "not clear". In the initial state, it says "player1 is at location pos12" but also "Location pos12 is clear". This seems inconsistent. 

Actually, the original state is probably mislabelled. I notice that "Location pos12 is clear" and "Location pos24 is clear" are the last two items in the list of original state definitions. Given the contradictions, I think these are probably errors and they should be "Location pos12 is not clear" and "Location pos24 is not clear", or just not mentioned.

I will proceed with the assumption that a location can either be clear (empty) or have an agent/stone. Given this:

1. Player starts at pos12 (1,2), so pos12 is not clear.
2. Stone is at pos24 (2,4), so pos24 is not clear.
3. All other locations are clear.

The plan I constructed earlier should still be valid. Let's quickly recap:

1. "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown" - Player moves from (1,2) to (1,3).
2. "move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown" - Player moves from (1,3) to (1,4).
3. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright" - Player pushes the stone from (2,4) to (3,4). After this, the player is at pos24 and the stone is at pos34.
4. "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup" - Player moves from (2,4) to (2,3).
5. "move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright" - Player moves from (2,3) to (3,3).
6. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown" - Player pushes the stone from (3,4) to (3,5). After this, the player is at pos34 and the stone is at pos35, which is the goal.

I believe this is the optimal plan for the given problem.
