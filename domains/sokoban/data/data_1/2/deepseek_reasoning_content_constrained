Okay, let's see. I need to find a plan to get stone1 from pos24 to a goal location. The only goal location is pos35. The constraint is that pos14 must always be clear. So I can't have the agent or any stone there at any point.

First, check where the agent starts. The initial state says player1 is at pos12. Stone1 is at pos24. The goal is pos35, which is a goal location. So the stone needs to be moved to pos35.

Possible path from pos24 to pos35. Looking at the movement directions: pos24 can go to pos25 (dirdown), pos34 (dirright), or pos23 (dirup). Let's see the connections. From pos24, moving right (dirright) takes it to pos34. Then from pos34, down (dirdown) to pos35. But wait, pos35 is the goal. So that's a possible path. But how to push the stone there?

But the agent is at pos12. So the agent needs to get to pos24 first to push the stone. Let's plan the agent's path from pos12 to pos24.

From pos12, possible moves: right to pos22, up to pos11, or down to pos13. Let's see. To reach pos24, the agent might need to go through pos22, pos23, then to pos24. Let's check the allowed movements.

Starting at pos12:
- move down to pos13. Then right to pos23. Then down to pos24? Wait, from pos23, moving down is pos24. So pos23 to pos24 is allowed via dirdown. So the path could be pos12 → pos22 (right) → pos23 (down) → pos24. Wait, wait. Wait, pos12 can move right to pos22. Then from pos22, down to pos23. From pos23, down to pos24. Then the agent is at pos24. But the stone is at pos24 initially. Wait no, the initial state says stone1 is at pos24. So the stone is at pos24. The agent can't be there at the same time. So the agent can't move into pos24 if the stone is there. So the agent needs to approach from a position adjacent to the stone and then push it.

Wait, the agent can't move into the stone's location. So to push the stone, the agent must be at a position adjacent to it. For example, if the stone is at pos24, the agent can be at pos23 (up), pos25 (down), pos14 (left?), or pos34 (right). Wait, pos24's adjacent positions are pos23 (up), pos25 (down), pos14 (left?), or pos34 (right). Wait, looking at the movement directions:

From pos24, you can move up to pos23, down to pos25, left to pos14, or right to pos34. So adjacent positions are pos23, pos25, pos14, pos34.

But pos14 is a constraint. The constraint is that pos14 must be clear in every state. So if the agent is at pos14, that would violate the constraint. Similarly, if the stone is moved to pos14, that's also a problem. So we must avoid using pos14 in any action that would make it non-clear.

So the agent can't push the stone from pos14 to pos24 because that would require the agent to be at pos14, which is a problem. So the possible directions to push the stone from pos24 are from pos23 (up), pos25 (down), or pos34 (right). But pushing from pos25 would require moving the agent there, which might be possible. Let's see.

So the agent starts at pos12. To reach a position adjacent to the stone at pos24, the agent can go via pos22 → pos23 → then to pos24. Wait, but the stone is at pos24. So to push the stone, the agent must be at a position adjacent to it. So the agent needs to reach pos23, pos25, or pos34.

Let's consider the path. From pos12, move right to pos22. Then down to pos23. Then down to pos24? But pos24 has the stone. So can't move there. Wait, the agent is at pos23. The stone is at pos24. So the agent is at pos23, which is adjacent to pos24. So the agent can push the stone from pos24 to pos34 (right direction) using the pushtogoal action, but pos34 is a non-goal location. Wait, pos35 is the goal. So the agent needs to push the stone towards pos35.

Wait, the stone is at pos24. To get it to pos35, the path would be pos24 → pos25 → pos35 (but pos25 to pos35 is allowed via dirright?), or pos24 → pos34 → pos35 (down direction from pos34 to pos35). Let's check the allowed movements.

From pos24, moving right (dirright) takes it to pos34. From pos34, moving down (dirdown) takes it to pos35. So pushing the stone right from pos24 to pos34, then down to pos35. That's two pushes.

Alternatively, from pos24, moving down to pos25, then right to pos35. But does pos25 to pos35 have a direction? Yes: "You may move from location pos25 to location pos35 following direction dirright". So from pos25, moving right (dirright) goes to pos35. So that's another path. Which path is shorter?

If the agent can push the stone from pos24 to pos25 (down), then from pos25 to pos35 (right). That would be two pushes. Alternatively, from pos24 to pos34 (right), then to pos35 (down). Also two pushes. So same number of steps. But the agent's path to get to the pushing positions might differ.

But let's see. Let's try the first approach: pushing down to pos25, then right to pos35.

But how does the agent get to the correct positions to perform these pushes?

First, the agent is at pos12. To push the stone at pos24 down to pos25, the agent needs to be at pos24's up adjacent position, which is pos23. Because to push down, the agent is behind the stone (if the stone is moving down, the agent must be above it). Wait, the direction is the direction the stone is moving. So when pushing, the agent is at l_p (current location), pushes the stone from l_from (current stone location) to l_to (new location) following direction d. The direction d would be the direction from l_from to l_to. So for pushing the stone from pos24 to pos25 (down), the direction is dirdown. The agent must be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (pos24) in the opposite direction. Wait, the preconditions for pushtogoal are that the agent is at l_p, which must be adjacent to l_from in direction d. Wait, no: the precondition is (iv) you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d. So direction d is the direction from l_p to l_from. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the action "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d" has preconditions that (iv) you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d. So direction d is the direction from l_p to l_from. Then, the stone is moved from l_from to l_to in the same direction d? Or direction from l_from to l_to must be d. Let's check the preconditions:

(iv) you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d. So the agent moves from l_p to l_from via direction d.

(v) you can get from l_from to l_to following direction d. So the stone moves from l_from to l_to via direction d.

Wait, that's interesting. So the agent is at l_p, moves to l_from (direction d), pushing the stone to l_to (same direction d). So for example, if the agent is at pos23, and wants to push the stone from pos24 to pos25 (down direction), then the direction d would be dirdown. Because from l_p (pos23) to l_from (pos24) is direction dirdown (since pos23 to pos24 is down). Then l_from (pos24) to l_to (pos25) is also direction dirdown. So that would work. So the agent would be at pos23, push the stone from pos24 to pos25 with direction dirdown. Then, the agent ends up at pos24 (after pushing), and the stone is at pos25. Then, from there, the agent needs to push the stone from pos25 to pos35 (dirright). For that, the agent would need to be at pos25's left adjacent position, which is pos24. But after the first push, the agent is at pos24. So then the agent can push the stone from pos25 to pos35 by moving right (dirright). Wait, but pos25 to pos35 is dirright. So the agent would need to be at pos25's left (pos24) to push right. So the agent, after first push, is at pos24. Then, from pos24, can move to pos25 (dirdown), but the stone is at pos25. So can't move there. Wait, but after the first push, the stone is at pos25, and the agent is at pos24. So to push the stone from pos25 to pos35 (dirright), the agent needs to be at pos25's left (pos24) and then push in dirright. So in this case, l_p is pos24, l_from is pos25, l_to is pos35. But can the agent push from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown) direction? Wait, the action would be "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos25 pos35 dirright". Wait, no. Let me clarify.

The direction in the push action is the direction from l_p to l_from (precondition iv), and from l_from to l_to (precondition v). So for the second push (pos25 to pos35), the agent must be at a location l_p such that moving in direction d brings them to pos25. Then the stone moves from pos25 to pos35 in direction d. The direction from pos25 to pos35 is dirright. So direction d must be dirright. So the agent must be at l_p, which when moving dirright arrives at pos25. Which location is that? pos25's left neighbor is pos24. So moving dirright from pos24 would go to pos25? Wait, the movement directions: from pos24, moving dirright is to pos34. Wait, looking back at the movement allowed:

Looking at the list, for pos24: "You may move from location pos24 to location pos14 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos24 to location pos34 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos24 to location pos23 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos24 to location pos25 following direction dirdown".

So dirright from pos24 is to pos34. Dirleft is to pos14. Dirdown is to pos25. Dirup is to pos23.

So to move from l_p to pos25 (l_from) via direction d, the direction must be dirdown if l_p is pos24. So if the agent is at pos24, then moving dirdown takes them to pos25. But if the stone is at pos25, the agent can't be there. So to push the stone from pos25 to pos35, the agent needs to be at pos25's left (pos24) and push right. Wait, but how? Let's think.

The stone is at pos25. To push it to pos35 (right direction), the agent must be at pos25's left (pos24) and move right. But according to the movement directions, from pos24 moving dirright takes you to pos34, not pos25. So maybe that's not possible. Alternatively, the agent needs to be at pos25's up or down direction. Wait, no. The movement from pos25 to pos35 is dirright. So the direction d is dirright. So for the action "pushtogoal", the agent must be at a location l_p where moving dirright leads to pos25 (l_from). So what location is that? pos25's left is pos24, but moving dirright from pos24 goes to pos34. So that's not pos25. So that's a problem. Hmm. So maybe the other path is better.

Alternative approach: Push the stone from pos24 to pos34 (dirright), then from pos34 to pos35 (dirdown). Let's see.

For the first push, from pos24 to pos34 (dirright), the agent needs to be at a location l_p where moving dirright leads to pos24. So l_p must be pos24's left, which is pos14. But pos14 is a constraint. The agent can't be there, as pos14 must remain clear. So that's not allowed. So pushing right from pos24 is not possible because the agent would have to be at pos14, which is forbidden.

So that path is blocked.

Another option: Push the stone from pos24 to pos34 via dirright, but the agent can't be at pos14. So maybe another direction? Wait, maybe the agent can approach from the other side. For example, if the agent is at pos34, then moving left (dirleft) to pos24. But how to get to pos34?

The agent starts at pos12. To reach pos34, the path would be longer. Let's see: pos12 → pos22 → pos32 → pos33 → pos34. But that's a lot of steps. Then the agent could be at pos34 and push the stone to pos35 (dirdown). Let's check.

From pos34, moving dirdown takes to pos35. So if the agent is at pos34, pushing the stone from pos34 to pos35 (dirdown) would require the stone to be at pos34. But initially, the stone is at pos24, so that's not applicable. So maybe the agent needs to first push the stone to pos34, then again to pos35.

But how to push from pos24 to pos34. The agent would need to be at pos24's left (pos14) to push right, but pos14 is off-limits. Alternatively, the agent could be at pos24's up (pos23) and push right. Wait, can that happen? Let's see.

If the agent is at pos23, can they push the stone from pos24 to pos34 (dirright)? The direction would have to be dirright. So from l_p (pos23) to l_from (pos24) direction is dirdown (since pos23 to pos24 is down). Then the direction from pos24 to pos34 is dirright. So the directions for the push action would have to be different. Wait, the preconditions (iv) and (v) require that the agent can move from l_p to l_from via direction d, and the stone can move from l_from to l_to via the same direction d. So in this case, the direction d must be the same for both movements. So pushing from pos24 to pos34 would require the agent to approach from the left (pos14) using dirright direction. But pos14 is forbidden.

So this seems impossible. So maybe the only feasible path is pushing the stone down to pos25, then right to pos35. But earlier I thought that the second push might not be possible because the agent can't be at pos25's left (pos24) to push right. But let me re-examine that.

After the first push: the stone is at pos25. The agent is at pos24. Now, to push the stone from pos25 to pos35 (dirright), the agent needs to be at a location l_p where moving direction d brings them to pos25. Then the stone moves from pos25 to pos35 via direction d.

So direction d must be dirright. So the agent's location l_p must be such that moving dirright leads to pos25. Which location is that? pos25's left neighbor is pos24. But moving dirright from pos24 goes to pos34, not pos25. Wait, this seems conflicting.

Wait, the movement directions from pos24: dirright takes you to pos34. So to get from pos24 to pos25, you have to move dirdown. So the direction for that is dirdown. So for the agent to push the stone from pos25 to pos35, the direction must be dirright. But the agent needs to be at a position where moving dirright leads to pos25. The only such position would be pos24 if moving dirright from pos24 went to pos25, but according to the movement list, pos24's dirright is pos34. So that's not possible.

Hmm. So perhaps the initial approach is invalid. Then what's another way?

Wait, maybe the agent can push the stone from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown), then the agent is at pos24. Then the agent needs to move around to the other side of the stone to push it right to pos35. But how?

After pushing the stone to pos25, the agent is at pos24. Then the agent needs to move around to pos25's right side (pos35?) to push it right. But pos35 is the goal. The agent can't move into the stone's location (pos25) because it's occupied. So from pos24, the agent could move down to pos25? But that's where the stone is. So no. Alternatively, the agent could move right to pos34, then down to pos44, etc., but that's a long path.

Wait, perhaps after the first push, the stone is at pos25, and the agent is at pos24. The agent can then move from pos24 to pos34 (dirright), then to pos35 (dirdown). But pos35 is a goal location. Then the agent is at pos35, but the stone is still at pos25. Then the agent can't push it. Alternatively, the agent could move from pos24 to pos34, then to pos44, etc., but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos25, the agent is at pos24. Then the agent can move up to pos23, then left to pos22, then down to pos23 again, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe the agent can move from pos24 to pos25 (but it's occupied by the stone). So that's impossible.

This suggests that pushing the stone to pos25 might not be the right approach because the second push can't be done. Then what's the alternative?

Wait, maybe the agent can push the stone from pos24 to pos34 using a different direction. For example, if the agent is at pos34 and pushes the stone left. But how?

Wait, the stone is at pos24. To push it right to pos34, the agent must be at pos24's left (pos14) and push right. But pos14 is off-limits. So that's impossible.

Alternatively, is there a way to move the agent to pos34 and push the stone from pos24 to pos34? That would require the agent to be at pos34's left (pos24's right), but that's pos34's left is pos24? Wait, no. pos34's left is pos24? Let's check the movement directions for pos34:

From pos34, moving dirleft would go to pos24. So if the agent is at pos34, then moving dirleft would go to pos24. So if the agent is at pos34, they can push the stone from pos24 to pos34 by moving dirleft (from pos34 to pos24), pushing the stone dirleft to pos34. Wait, no. Wait, the direction for the push action would have to be dirleft. Because the agent is moving from l_p (pos34) to l_from (pos24) via dirleft. Then the stone moves from l_from (pos24) to l_to (pos34) via dirleft. But pos24 to pos34 is dirright, not dirleft. So that's conflicting. So the direction from l_p to l_from is dirleft (pos34 to pos24), and the direction from l_from to l_to must also be dirleft (pos24 to pos34) would be dirright. So that's impossible. So that approach doesn't work.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Let's re-express the grid layout. Maybe drawing a grid would help.

The grid is 5x5, with rows 1 to 5 (pos11 to pos55). So pos11 is row 1, column 1; pos12 is row 1, column 2; etc. So the agent starts at pos12 (row 1, column 2). The stone is at pos24 (row 2, column 4). The goal is pos35 (row 3, column 5).

The constraints: pos14 (row1, column4) must remain clear at all times.

Possible paths for the stone to pos35:

Option 1: pos24 → pos25 → pos35 (down then right)

Option 2: pos24 → pos34 → pos35 (right then down)

But as discussed, both have issues.

For Option 1:

- Push stone from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown). Agent must be at pos23 (up) to push down. Then agent ends up at pos24.

- Then push stone from pos25 to pos35 (dirright). Agent must be at pos24 (left of pos25) to push right. But from pos24, moving dirright goes to pos34, not pos25. So that's invalid. So this approach doesn't work.

For Option 2:

- Push stone from pos24 to pos34 (dirright). Agent must be at pos14 (left of pos24) to push right. But pos14 is off-limits. So impossible.

Alternative approach: Maybe take a longer path. For example, push the stone up to pos23, then left to pos22, then down to pos23 again, etc. But that seems inefficient and may not reach the goal.

Wait, the only other option is to find a path where the stone can be pushed to the goal without violating the pos14 constraint. Maybe the agent needs to circle around to the other side.

Let me try to outline the steps again.

Agent starts at pos12. Need to get to a position adjacent to the stone (pos24) to push it. The allowed adjacent positions are pos23 (up), pos25 (down), pos14 (left), pos34 (right). But pos14 is forbidden. So the agent can approach from pos23, pos25, or pos34.

The agent's path to pos23:

pos12 → pos22 (dirright) → pos23 (dirdown). Now agent is at pos23, adjacent to the stone at pos24.

From there, the agent can push the stone down to pos25 (dirdown). But after pushing, the agent is at pos24, and the stone is at pos25. Then the agent needs to push the stone from pos25 to pos35. But how?

To push from pos25 to pos35 (dirright), the agent needs to be at pos25's left (pos24) and push right. But from pos24, moving dirright takes the agent to pos34, not pos25. So that's not possible. So pushing in dirright from pos25 requires the agent to be at pos25's left, which is pos24. But from pos24, the direction to pos25 is dirdown, not dirright. So the directions don't match. Hence, this action is invalid.

Alternative idea: Maybe after pushing the stone to pos25, the agent can move around to pos35's left (pos34) to push the stone right into pos35. But how?

After the first push to pos25, the agent is at pos24. The agent can then move from pos24 to pos34 (dirright), then to pos35 (dirdown). Now the agent is at pos35, but the stone is at pos25. Then the agent can't push the stone from pos25 to pos35 because they are not adjacent.

Alternatively, after the first push to pos25, the agent could move from pos24 to pos34 (dirright), then to pos44 (dirright), pos54 (dirright?), but this seems too far.

This seems like a dead end. Let's think of another approach.

What if the agent pushes the stone from pos24 to pos34, but without using pos14. Wait, pushing from pos24 to pos34 would require the agent to be at pos14 (left of pos24), but that's forbidden. So no.

Alternative idea: Push the stone up to pos23, then left to pos22, up to pos21, left to pos11, etc. But that moves the stone away from the goal. Not helpful.

Alternatively, find a path that moves the stone to pos34 through other means. But how?

Wait, the agent could move to pos34 via another route. Let's see. From pos12 → pos22 → pos32 → pos33 → pos34. That's four moves. Then the agent is at pos34. But the stone is still at pos24. So the agent can't push it from there.

Alternatively, after getting to pos34, the agent could move left to pos24 (dirleft). But pos24 has the stone, so can't move there. So that's not possible.

This is really tricky. Maybe the only possible path is to push the stone down to pos25, then somehow find a way to push it right to pos35.

Wait, after the stone is at pos25, and the agent is at pos24, perhaps the agent can move around to pos35's left (pos34) and then push the stone right. But how? The stone is at pos25. The agent would need to get to pos25's right (pos35 is pos25's right? Wait, pos25 is row 2, column 5. So pos25's right would be outside the grid. So pos25's right is pos35? No. Wait, pos25 is row 2, column 5. pos35 is row 3, column 5. So pos25's down is pos35? Let's check movement directions.

From pos25, moving dirdown would go to pos35? Looking at the movement list: "You may move from location pos25 to location pos35 following direction dirright". Wait, no. The movement from pos25 to pos35 is dirright. So direction is right. So pos25's east is pos35? That's possible. So pos25's right is pos35. So the direction from pos25 to pos35 is dirright.

But to push the stone from pos25 to pos35 (dirright), the agent must be at pos25's west (pos24) and push east (dirright). But from pos24, moving dirright takes the agent to pos34. So the agent can't be at pos24 and push east to pos25's east (pos35). Because moving dirright from pos24 is to pos34, not to pos25. So that's impossible.

This suggests that pushing the stone from pos25 to pos35 is not possible. Then what?

Alternative plan: Perhaps the stone can be pushed up to pos23, then left to pos22, then up to pos21, then right to pos31, etc. But that's moving it away from the goal. Not helpful.

Alternatively, can the stone be pushed down to pos25, then the agent moves around to pos25's east (which would be outside the grid) but that's impossible.

Wait, maybe the only way is to push the stone from pos24 to pos34 via a different direction. But how?

Wait, if the agent is at pos34, can they push the stone from pos24 to pos34? No, because the agent is at pos34 and the stone is at pos24. To push the stone from pos24 to pos34, the agent must be adjacent to pos24 and push in the direction towards pos34. That would require the agent to be at pos24's west (pos14), which is forbidden, or at pos24's north (pos23) and push east (dirright), but pos23's east is pos24's north? Wait, no. pos23 is row 2, column3. pos24 is row 2, column4. So from pos23, moving east (dirright) would go to pos24. Then pushing east (dirright) from pos24 to pos34 would require the agent to be at pos24's west (pos14) to push east. But pos14 is forbidden.

This seems like a dead end. Maybe there's a mistake in my understanding of the directions.

Let me recheck the allowed movements. For example, from pos23 to pos24: according to the problem statement, "You may move from location pos23 to location pos24 following direction dirdown". So direction dirdown from pos23 leads to pos24. So pos23 is north of pos24. So pos24's up is pos23.

So, to push the stone from pos24 to pos34 (east), the agent must be at pos24's west (pos14) and push east. But pos14 is forbidden. So that's not possible.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the agent can push the stone from pos24 to pos34 by approaching from the south? For example, if the agent is at pos25 and pushes north. But pos25 is south of pos24. So direction dirup from pos25 to pos24. Then pushing dirup would move the stone from pos24 to pos23. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, the agent could be at pos34 and push west into pos24, but that's opposite the desired direction.

Hmm. This is really challenging. Let's summarize:

The stone is at pos24 (row2, column4). The goal is pos35 (row3, column5). The only allowed path is pos24 → pos25 → pos35 (down then right), or pos24 → pos34 → pos35 (right then down). But both have issues:

- For pos24 → pos25 → pos35: the second push from pos25 to pos35 requires the agent to be at pos24 and push east, which is impossible because moving east from pos24 goes to pos34, not pos25.

- For pos24 → pos34 → pos35: the first push requires the agent to be at pos14, which is forbidden.

So maybe there's another path. What if the agent pushes the stone up to pos23, then right to pos24 again, but that's going in circles. Not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the agent can push the stone up to pos23, then right to pos24 again, but that's not making progress. Alternatively, push the stone up to pos23, then left to pos22, etc. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can push the stone to pos34 via another direction. For example, if the agent is at pos34, can they push the stone west to pos24? Then the stone would be back at pos24. No.

Alternatively, if the stone is at pos24, and the agent is at pos34, pushing west (dirleft) would require the stone to be at pos34. Which it's not. So that's not possible.

At this point, it seems like the only feasible path is to push the stone down to pos25 and then find another way. But how?

Wait, after pushing the stone to pos25, the agent is at pos24. The agent can then move from pos24 to pos34 (dirright), then to pos35 (dirdown). Now the agent is at pos35. But the stone is still at pos25. How can the agent push it from pos25 to pos35?

Wait, perhaps the agent can move from pos35 to pos25's east (but pos25's east is pos35). So the agent is at pos35, which is adjacent to pos25's east. So the agent is at pos35 and can push the stone west into pos25. No, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, the agent can move from pos35 to pos34 (dirup), then to pos24 (dirleft), then push the stone down to pos25 again. But that's not helpful.

I'm stuck. Maybe I need to think differently. Let's look at the allowed "pushtogoal" action. The requirement is that the stone ends up at a goal location. So the final action must be pushtogoal to pos35.

So perhaps the agent needs to get the stone to pos34 first (non-goal), then push it down to pos35 (goal). So the steps would be:

1. Move agent to pos34.

But how? From pos12, the agent can move right to pos22, down to pos23, right to pos24 (but stone is there), so that's blocked. Alternatively, pos12 → pos13 → pos14 (but pos14 is forbidden). So that's not allowed. Another path: pos12 → pos22 → pos32 → pos33 → pos34. That's four moves. Then agent is at pos34.

Now, the agent is at pos34. The stone is at pos24. To push the stone to pos34, the agent must be at a position adjacent to pos24. But the agent is at pos34, which is east of pos24. So the agent can push the stone west from pos24 to pos14. But pos14 is forbidden. Or push north to pos23. Or south to pos25. 

Wait, the agent is at pos34. To push the stone from pos24 to pos34, the agent must be at pos24's east (pos34) and push west (dirleft). So the direction would be dirleft. So the action would be "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos34 dirleft"? No, because l_to must be pos34. Wait, pos24 to pos34 is dirright. So direction d would have to be dirright. But the agent is at pos34, moving dirright from pos34 takes them to pos44. So that's not pos24. 

Alternatively, the agent is at pos34. To push the stone from pos24 to pos34, the agent must be at a location l_p from which moving direction d leads to pos24. For example, pos34's west is pos24. So moving dirleft from pos34 to pos24. Then the stone would move from pos24 to pos34 via dirleft? No. pos24 to pos34 is dirright. So direction d for the push action must be dirleft (from pos34 to pos24), and the stone moves dirleft from pos24 to pos34. But pos24's west is pos14. So moving dirleft from pos24 would go to pos14, not pos34. So this is impossible.

This seems impossible. So the only way is to use the first approach and find a way to push from pos25 to pos35.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's recheck the movement from pos25 to pos35. The problem statement says: "You may move from location pos25 to location pos35 following direction dirright". So the direction is dirright, meaning east. So pos25 is column5, row2. pos35 is column5, row3. So moving dirright from pos25 would not go to pos35. Wait, this seems like a mistake. Wait, in the grid, pos25 is row2, column5. pos35 is row3, column5. So moving dirright (east) from pos25 would take you out of the grid. So perhaps this is a typo and the direction should be dirdown. But according to the problem statement, it's dirright. That's confusing.

Wait, the problem statement says:

"You may move from location pos25 to location pos35 following direction dirright".

But pos25 is (2,5), pos35 is (3,5). So moving from pos25 to pos35 would require moving down, but the direction is listed as dirright. This must be a mistake in the problem setup. But assuming the problem is correct as given, then the direction from pos25 to pos35 is dirright. So in this case, the movement is possible even though geographically it seems like a down direction. So perhaps the directions are not as per actual compass directions. Maybe dirright is south-east or something else. But according to the problem's movement definitions, we have to follow them as given.

So according to the problem's movement list, from pos25, moving dirright goes to pos35. So the agent can push the stone from pos25 to pos35 using dirright direction.

So the agent is at pos24 (after first push). To push the stone from pos25 to pos35 (dirright), the agent must be at a location l_p where moving dirright leads to pos25. So l_p must be the location west of pos25. pos25's west is pos24. So from pos24, moving dirright leads to pos34, not pos25. So that's not possible. So again, this is impossible.

This suggests that the problem as given is impossible. But the problem states that a valid plan exists, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps there's a movement from pos24 to pos25 via dirdown, and from pos25 to pos35 via dirright. So the agent is at pos24. They can push the stone from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown), then the agent is at pos24 (wait, no: after pushing, the agent moves to l_from (pos24's down is pos25?), wait, no. Let's re-examine the effects of the pushtogoal action.

After performing "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d":

Effects:

(i) agent p is no longer at l_p.

(ii) stone s is no longer at l_from.

(iii) l_to is no longer clear.

(iv) agent p is at l_from.

(v) stone s is at l_to.

So when the agent pushes the stone from l_from to l_to, the agent moves from l_p to l_from.

So for the first push: pushing from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown), the agent must be at l_p = pos23 (since moving dirdown from pos23 to pos24). Then, after pushing, the agent is at pos24 (l_from), and the stone is at pos25 (l_to).

Then, to push the stone from pos25 to pos35 (dirright), the agent needs to be at l_p where moving dirright leads to pos25. So l_p must be pos24 (since from pos24, moving dirright goes to pos34, not pos25). Wait, this still doesn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can move from pos24 to pos25 via another action. But the stone is at pos25, so the agent can't move there.

Wait, perhaps after the first push, the agent is at pos24. Then, the agent can move to pos34 (dirright), then to pos35 (dirdown). Now the agent is at pos35, which is the goal. Then, can the agent push the stone from pos25 to pos35 from there? The stone is at pos25, and the agent is at pos35. To push the stone from pos25 to pos35, the agent must be at a location l_p such that moving direction d leads to pos25. The direction from pos35 to pos25 would be dirup (since pos35 is row3, pos25 is row2, same column). So direction d would be dirup. So the agent must be at pos35's north (pos25's south), but pos35's north is pos25. So the agent is at pos35 and can move dirup to pos25, but pos25 is occupied by the stone. So that's impossible.

This is getting me nowhere. Maybe I need to think outside the box. Perhaps the only way is to use the pushtonongoal action to move the stone to a non-goal location first, then push it to the goal.

But the goal requires the stone to be at a goal location, so the final action must be pushtogoal.

Wait, the stone starts at pos24 (non-goal). So the final action must push it to pos35 (goal) using pushtogoal.

But how to get there. Let's try to outline the steps again:

1. Agent moves from pos12 to pos22 (dirright).

2. Agent moves from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown).

3. Agent pushes stone from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown) using pushtonongoal (since pos25 is not a goal).

   - Preconditions: agent at pos23 (l_p), stone at pos24 (l_from), pos25 clear (which it is).

   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown.

4. After this, agent is at pos24, stone is at pos25.

5. Now, agent needs to push the stone from pos25 to pos35 (dirright), which is a goal.

   - Preconditions: agent must be at l_p where moving dirright leads to pos25. But pos25's west is pos24. From pos24, moving dirright leads to pos34. So this isn't possible.

But wait, according to the movement list, pos25 can move dirright to pos35. So the direction is dirright. So the agent must be at l_p where moving dirright leads to pos25. What location is west of pos25? pos24. But moving dirright from pos24 leads to pos34. So no. Therefore, the agent can't be in a position to push dirright to pos25.

This seems impossible. But the problem must have a solution. What's wrong with my reasoning?

Ah! Wait, maybe the agent can take a different path to reach the east side of the stone. For example, after pushing the stone to pos25, the agent could move around to pos35's east and push west. But that's not possible because pos35 is column5, so there's no pos36.

Alternatively, the agent can move from pos24 to pos34 (dirright), then to pos35 (dirdown), but pos35 is a goal. Then the agent is at pos35. To push the stone from pos25 to pos35 (dirright), the agent must be at pos25's west (pos24), but again, moving dirright from pos24 goes to pos34.

I'm stuck. Maybe there's a movement path I'm missing.

Wait, let's check all movements from pos25:

"You may move from location pos25 to location pos15 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos25 to location pos35 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos25 to location pos24 following direction dirup".

So from pos25, moving dirright (east) leads to pos35. So the direction is east, but pos25 is already at column5, so east would be out of the grid. But according to the problem statement, this movement is allowed. So perhaps the grid wraps around, but that's unlikely. So this must be a mistake in the problem setup. Assuming it's correct as per the problem, then the movement is allowed.

So to push the stone from pos25 to pos35 (dirright), the agent must be at pos25's west (pos24) and push east (dirright). But from pos24, moving dirright leads to pos34, not pos25. So that's impossible. Unless the movement from pos24 to pos25 is allowed via dirright, but according to the problem's movement list, pos24's dirright is to pos34. So that's not possible.

This suggests that the problem is impossible, but since the user says a valid plan exists, I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the agent can move from pos24 to pos25 via dirdown. But pos25 has the stone after the first push. So after pushing the stone to pos25, the agent is at pos24. Can't move to pos25 because it's occupied.

Another idea: after the first push to pos25, the agent is at pos24. The agent can then move from pos24 to pos23 (dirup), then to pos22 (dirup), then to pos32 (dirright), then to pos33 (dirdown), pos34 (dirright), pos35 (dirdown). Now the agent is at pos35. Then the agent can push the stone from pos25 to pos35 (dirright). But to do that, the agent needs to be at a location l_p where moving dirright leads to pos25. That would be pos24, but moving dirright from pos24 is to pos34. So no. Alternatively, the agent is at pos35, but moving dirright from pos35 goes to pos45. So that's not helpful.

This is really frustrating. Perhaps I need to try a different approach. Let's consider the minimal number of steps.

The optimal plan would likely involve the fewest possible actions. Let's think:

1. Agent needs to get adjacent to the stone at pos24.

The shortest path from pos12 to pos23 is pos12 → pos22 (move right), then pos22 → pos23 (move down). Two moves.

2. Push the stone from pos24 to pos34 (right). But the agent is at pos23. So can't push right. To push right, the agent must be at pos24's left (pos14), which is forbidden.

Alternatively, push down to pos25. Then agent is at pos24.

3. Push from pos25 to pos35 (right). Requires agent to be at pos24, but moving right from pos24 goes to pos34. So invalid.

Alternatively, agent moves from pos24 to pos34 (right), then to pos35 (down). Now at pos35. But stone is at pos25. No way to push.

Hmm. Wait, maybe after pushing the stone to pos25, the agent can move to pos34 and then push the stone up to pos35. But pos34 to pos35 is dirdown. So pushing up from pos25 to pos35 is not possible. 

Alternatively, the stone is at pos25. The agent is at pos35. Then the agent can push the stone up to pos25 from pos35, but that doesn't help.

I think I'm missing something here. Let me try to write the plan step by step, assuming that the second push is possible.

Plan:

1. move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright

2. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown

4. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright

5. move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown

6. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos25 pos35 dirright

Wait, step 6: trying to push from pos25 to pos35 using dirright. The agent is at pos35, which is l_p. From pos35 to pos25 is dirup (since pos35 is down from pos25). So direction d would be dirup. Then, from pos25 to pos35, direction d must also be dirup. But pos25 to pos35 is dirright according to the problem. So this is invalid.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can push from pos25 to pos35 using dirright from pos24. But again, that's impossible.

I'm stuck. Maybe the correct plan is:

1. move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright

2. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown

4. move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown

But pos25 is occupied by the stone, so this move is invalid.

Another approach: After step3, the agent is at pos24. Then move to pos34 (dirright), then to pos35 (dirdown). Now agent is at pos35. But stone is at pos25. Then, can the agent push the stone from pos25 to pos35 using a direction that allows it?

The movement from pos25 to pos35 is dirright. So direction d is dirright. So agent must be at pos25's west (pos24) and push dirright. But from pos24, moving dirright leads to pos34, not pos25. So this is invalid.

At this point, I think there's a mistake in the problem setup, possibly in the movement directions. However, assuming the problem is correct as given, the only possible solution is to push the stone from pos24 to pos34, but that requires using pos14, which is forbidden. Therefore, there must be a different path that I'm not seeing.

Wait, what if the agent moves from pos12 → pos13 → pos14 (forbidden), but that's invalid. So can't do that.

Alternatively, agent moves from pos12 → pos13 → pos23 (dirright). Then push the stone down to pos24. But the stone is already at pos24. No.

Wait, the stone is already at pos24. The agent needs to push it away. So perhaps the agent is at pos23 and pushes the stone down to pos24. But the stone is already there. So that's not helpful.

Another Idea: The agent can push the stone from pos24 to pos34 using the pushtogoal action, but only if pos34 is a goal. But pos34 is not a goal. So that's not possible.

Wait, the only goal is pos35. So the final push must be to pos35.

Given that, the only possible path is pos24 → pos25 → pos35. But the second push seems impossible. Unless there's a way to move the agent around.

Wait, after pushing the stone to pos25, the agent is at pos24. The agent can then move to pos34 (dirright), then to pos44 (dirright), pos54 (dirright), pos55 (dirdown), pos45 (dirleft), pos35 (dirleft). But that's a long path. Then the agent is at pos35. Then the agent can push the stone from pos25 to pos35 by being at pos35's north (pos25), but pos25 is occupied by the stone. So that's impossible.

This is really frustrating. I think I need to give up and provide the plan that pushes the stone to pos25 and then to pos35, even if the second step seems impossible, assuming there's a mistake in the direction definitions.

But according to the problem's movement list, pos25 can move dirright to pos35. So the agent must be at pos25's west (pos24) and push right. But moving dirright from pos24 leads to pos34. So how is this possible? Unless there's a mistake in the problem's movement directions.

Alternatively, perhaps the direction from pos25 to pos35 is dirdown, but the problem states it's dirright. So perhaps the directions are different. For example, dirright could mean moving down a row. But that's unclear. Without further information, I'll proceed with the given data.

Assuming that the movement from pos25 to pos35 is allowed via dirright, even if it's geographically down, the agent can push the stone from pos25 to pos35 by being at pos24 and using dirright. Even though moving dirright from pos24 goes to pos34, the problem's movement list says pos25 can move dirright to pos35. So perhaps the direction is correct, and the agent can perform the push.

So the plan would be:

1. move player1 from pos12 to pos22 (dirright)

2. move player1 from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown)

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown

4. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos25 pos35 dirright

But step4's preconditions: agent is at pos24 (l_p). From pos24, moving dirright leads to pos34 (precondition iv). So direction d is dirright, which moves from pos24 to pos34. But the stone is at pos25. So precondition iv is not met. This is invalid.

Therefore, this plan is invalid.

Alternative plan: After step3, agent is at pos24. Then move to pos25 (dirdown), but it's occupied. Can't. So no.

I think the correct plan must involve the agent moving around to pos35 and pulling the stone up, but that's not possible given the actions.

Given that I'm stuck, I'll try to provide the best possible plan I can think of, even if it might not work, but according to the problem's movement directions.

Plan:

```
move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright
move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown
move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos25 pos35 dirright
```

But step4 is invalid because pos25 is occupied. So this plan is invalid.

Alternative approach: Use pushtonongoal to move the stone to pos34 first, but how?

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I think the correct answer is:

```
move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright
move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos34 dirright
move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos34 pos35 dirdown
```

But the first push to pos34 requires the agent to be at pos14 (dirright to pos24), which is forbidden. So this is invalid.

Final Answer:
