Okay, let's try to figure out the plan here. So the goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. From the initial state, I see that stone1 is at pos24, and the only goal location is pos35. So I need to move stone1 from pos24 to pos35.

First, the agent is at pos12. To push the stone, the agent needs to get adjacent to it. The stone is at pos24. Let me check the movement possibilities. From pos12, the agent can go to pos22 (dirright), then from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown), and then to pos24 (dirdown). Wait, but can the agent move directly from pos22 to pos24? Let me check the allowed moves. Looking at the list, pos22 can move to pos23 via dirdown. Hmm, so from pos22, the directions are dirleft (to pos12), dirright (to pos32), dirup (pos21), or dirdown (pos23). So to get to pos24, the agent would need to go from pos23 to pos24 via dirdown. So the path would be pos12 -> pos22 -> pos23 -> pos24. But wait, when the agent is at pos23, can they move down to pos24? Yes, according to the allowed moves. Then, once the agent is at pos23, they can push the stone from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown) if pos25 is clear. But pos25 is a non-goal location. Wait, the goal is pos35. So maybe pushing it further right?

Wait, the stone is at pos24. To get it to pos35, which is in the third row, fifth column. So pos35 is in row 3, column5? Wait, the positions are like posXY where X is the row and Y is the column. So pos35 is row3, column5. The stone is at pos24 (row2, column4). So to get to pos35, the stone needs to move down once to row3 (pos34) then right once to pos35. Or right first to pos25 (row2, column5), then down to pos35. Wait, pos25 is in row2, column5, and moving down from pos25 would go to pos35 (since pos25's down is pos35, according to the allowed moves: "You may move from location pos25 to location pos35 following direction dirright". Wait, no, direction is dirright. Wait, the allowed moves from pos25 are dirleft (to pos15), dirright (to pos35), and dirup (to pos24). Oh right, so moving from pos25 to pos35 is via dirright. So the stone is at pos24. If the agent can push it right to pos34, then from pos34, push it down to pos35. But pos34 is not a goal location. Wait, pos35 is the only goal. So the stone needs to end up at pos35.

Let me retrace. The stone is at pos24. Agent needs to get adjacent to it. Let's see the positions around pos24. The allowed moves from pos24 are dirleft (to pos14), dirright (to pos34), dirup (to pos23), and dirdown (to pos25). So the agent needs to be at pos23, pos14, pos34, or pos25 to push the stone.

Initially, the agent is at pos12. So the agent needs to move to pos23 first. How?

From pos12, they can move dirright to pos22. Then from pos22, dirdown to pos23. Then from pos23, dirdown to pos24? Wait, no. Wait, the allowed moves from pos23 are dirleft (to pos13), dirright (to pos33), dirup (to pos22), and dirdown (to pos24). So yes, from pos23, moving dirdown takes them to pos24. But pos24 has the stone. So to push the stone, the agent needs to be at pos24's adjacent tile. Wait, the preconditions for pushtogoal or pushtonongoal require that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's location) in the direction d. So for example, if the agent is at pos23 and wants to push the stone from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown), that would require that the agent can get from l_p (pos23) to l_from (pos24) via direction d (dirdown), but according to the allowed moves, moving from pos23 to pos24 is dirdown. Wait, no. Let me check the allowed moves again. The move from pos23 to pos24 is allowed via dirdown. So the agent can move from pos23 to pos24 via dirdown. But if the agent is at pos23 and wants to push the stone from pos24, that's not adjacent in the direction. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the directions.

Wait, the movement directions are such that, for example, moving from pos23 to pos24 via dirdown would mean that pos24 is directly below pos23. Wait, but in a grid, rows are vertical. So pos23 is row2, column3. pos24 is row2, column4? Wait, no, perhaps the positions are labeled as posXY where X is the row and Y is the column. So pos23 is row2, column3. Then pos24 would be row2, column4. So moving right from pos23 would take to pos24. But according to the allowed moves, from pos23, moving dirright takes to pos33. Wait, no. Let me look again. The allowed moves for pos23:

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos23 to location pos33 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos23 to location pos22 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos23 to location pos24 following direction dirdown"

Ah, so moving dirdown from pos23 takes you to pos24. So pos23 is row2, column3, and pos24 is row3, column3? Wait, maybe the rows are the first digit. So pos23 is row2, column3. Then dirdown from pos23 would be row3, column3, which is pos33? That doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the directions are a bit confusing. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the grid is structured such that moving down increases the row number. So pos11 is row1, column1. pos12 is row1, column2. pos21 is row2, column1. So moving down from pos12 would take you to pos22 (row2, column2). Wait, but according to the allowed moves, moving from pos12 to pos22 is via dirright. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, the allowed moves for pos12 include "You may move from location pos12 to location pos22 following direction dirright". So dirright from pos12 (row1, column2) takes you to pos22 (row2, column2)? That would mean that directions are a bit different. Maybe the grid is laid out in such a way that moving right increases the column, moving down increases the row, moving up decreases the row, and left decreases the column. So pos12 is row1, column2. dirright from pos12 would take to pos22 (row2, column2). Wait, that's more like moving down. Hmm, this seems confusing. Maybe the directions are labeled differently. For example, dirright could correspond to moving east (right in columns), dirleft to west, dirup to north (up in rows), and dirdown to south (down in rows). But according to the allowed moves, moving from pos12 to pos22 is via dirright. So pos12 (row1, column2) to pos22 (row2, column2) is moving dirright. That would imply that dirright is actually moving down a row, which is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the positions are labeled such that the first digit is the column and the second is the row. So pos12 would be column1, row2. Then moving right (dirright) would increase the column. So from pos12 (column1, row2), dirright would go to pos22 (column2, row2). That makes more sense. So the first digit is column, the second is row. So posXY is column X, row Y. Then directions are: dirright increases column, dirleft decreases, dirup decreases row, dirdown increases row. Wait, but in that case, moving from pos12 (column1, row2) to pos22 (column2, row2) via dirright makes sense. Then moving dirdown from pos22 would go to pos23 (column2, row3). So the stone is at pos24 (column2, row4). The goal is pos35 (column3, row5). So the stone is at column2, row4. To get to column3, row5 (pos35), it needs to move right once (to column3, row4, which is pos34) then down once (to pos35). Or down first to row5 (column2, row5 is pos25), then right to pos35 (column3, row5). Let me check the allowed moves for pos24. From pos24, you can move dirright to pos34 (column3, row4). From pos34, dirright to pos44 (column4, row4) or dirdown to pos35 (column3, row5). So the stone at pos24 can be pushed right to pos34 (if the agent is at pos24's left, which is pos23 (column2, row4-1?), wait, no. Wait, if pos24 is column2, row4, then the left direction would be column1, row4 (pos14), right to column3, row4 (pos34), up to column2, row3 (pos23), down to column2, row5 (pos25). So to push the stone from pos24 to pos34 (right), the agent needs to be at pos24's left (pos23) and push right. Wait, but how? Because the agent can push the stone by moving in the direction from the stone's current position. So for example, if the agent is at pos23 (column2, row3), and wants to push the stone at pos24 (column2, row4) down to pos25 (column2, row5), the direction would be dirdown. But pos23 is not adjacent to pos24. Wait, no. If pos23 is column2, row3, then moving down would take to column2, row4, which is pos24. So the agent can move from pos23 down to pos24. But if the stone is at pos24, then the agent can't move into that position unless they are pushing the stone. Wait, but the preconditions for pushing require that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's position) in the direction d. Wait, perhaps the direction d is the direction from l_p to l_from. For example, if the agent is at pos23 (l_p), and the stone is at pos24 (l_from), then the direction from l_p to l_from is dirdown. Then, the agent can push the stone from l_from (pos24) to l_to (pos34) via direction dirright. Wait, but how does that work? The action "pushtogoal" requires that the agent is at l_p (pos23), the stone is at l_from (pos24), l_to is clear (pos34), and that you can get from l_p to l_from via direction d (dirdown), and from l_from to l_to via direction d (dirright). So the agent would push the stone from pos24 to pos34, moving in the dirright direction. But for that, the agent must be at pos23 (l_p), which is south of pos24? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the grid layout.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to be adjacent to the stone in the direction opposite to the direction they want to push. For example, to push the stone east (dirright), the agent must be west of the stone. So if the stone is at pos24, the agent needs to be at pos23 (west) to push it east to pos25. Wait, but pos23 is column2, row3, and pos24 is column2, row4. So in that case, the agent is north of the stone. To push the stone east (dirright), the agent would need to be west of it. So perhaps the grid is column-row, where moving right increases the column. So pos23 is column2, row3. pos24 is column2, row4. So the agent is north of the stone. To push the stone east (dirright), the agent would need to be west of the stone (pos14?), but that doesn't make sense. This is getting complicated. Maybe I should map out the grid.

Let me create a grid layout based on the positions. Let's consider posXY as column X, row Y.

Row 1: pos11 (1,1), pos12 (1,2), pos13 (1,3), pos14 (1,4), pos15 (1,5)
Row 2: pos21 (2,1), pos22 (2,2), ..., pos25 (2,5)
Row 3: pos31 (3,1), ..., pos35 (3,5)
Row 4: pos41 (4,1), ..., pos45 (4,5)
Row 5: pos51 (5,1), ..., pos55 (5,5)

Wait, no. Wait, the positions are labeled as pos11, pos12, etc., but according to the allowed moves, moving from pos12 to pos22 is via dirright. So if pos12 is (1,2) (column1, row2), then dirright would increase the column. So pos22 is (2,2). Then moving from pos12 to pos22 is dirright (east). That makes sense. So the grid is columns as first digit, rows as second. So posXY is column X, row Y.

So the stone is at pos24: column2, row4. The goal location is pos35: column3, row5.

So the stone needs to go from (2,4) to (3,5). How can we push it there?

The agent starts at pos12 (1,2). Let's find a path to get to a position where they can push the stone.

From pos12 (1,2), possible moves are dirright to pos22 (2,2), dirup to pos11 (1,1), or dirdown to pos13 (1,3). The fastest way to reach the stone is to go right to pos22 (2,2), then down to pos23 (2,3), then down to pos24 (2,4). Wait, but when moving to pos24, that's where the stone is. So the agent can't move into the stone's position unless they are pushing it. So the agent needs to get adjacent to the stone to push it.

So the stone is at (2,4). The agent needs to be at a position adjacent to (2,4) in a direction that allows pushing. Let's see the adjacent positions:

North: (2,3) pos23

South: (2,5) pos25

East: (3,4) pos34

West: (1,4) pos14

So the agent can be at pos23, pos25, pos34, or pos14 to push the stone.

But the agent is starting at pos12. Let's plan a path to reach pos23. From pos12 (1,2), move dirright to pos22 (2,2). Then move dirdown to pos23 (2,3). Now, the agent is at pos23 (2,3). From here, they can push the stone north (up) to pos24's north? Wait, pos23 is south of pos24. So if the agent is at pos23 (2,3), they can push the stone at pos24 (2,4) north? No, because pos23 is south of pos24. Wait, perhaps the directions are relative. The direction from the agent's position to the stone's position is north (from pos23 to pos24 is north). So if the agent is at pos23 and the stone is at pos24, the direction from agent to stone is north (dirdown?). Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think again.

The allowed directions are dirdown, dirup, dirleft, dirright. So when the agent is at pos23 (2,3), the stone is at pos24 (2,4). The direction from agent to stone is dirdown (since pos24 is one row higher? Or is it the other way around). Wait, according to the allowed moves, moving from pos23 to pos24 is via dirdown. So the agent can move from pos23 to pos24 via dirdown. But if the stone is at pos24, the agent can't move there unless pushing. So the agent is at pos23. To push the stone from pos24 (which is south of pos23?), wait, no. If moving from pos23 to pos24 is via dirdown, that implies that pos24 is below pos23. So in a grid where rows increase downward, pos23 is at row3, pos24 at row4. So the agent is at (2,3) and the stone is at (2,4). To push the stone south (dirdown) to pos25 (2,5), the agent would need to be north of the stone. Wait, but the agent is at (2,3) and the stone is at (2,4). So the agent is north of the stone. To push the stone south (down), the agent can do that by moving south into the stone's position, pushing it further south. So the action would be pushtonongoal (since pos25 is not a goal) with direction dirdown. But pos25 is not a goal, so that's not helpful. Alternatively, pushing the stone east (dirright) to pos34 (3,4). To do that, the agent needs to be west of the stone. The stone is at (2,4). West would be (1,4) pos14. But the agent is at (2,3). How to get to pos14? That's a long way. Alternatively, perhaps there's a better path.

Alternatively, the agent can push the stone east from pos24 to pos34 (3,4), then south to pos35 (3,5). So the agent needs to push the stone east to pos34, then south to pos35. But to push east from pos24, the agent needs to be west of the stone, i.e., at pos14 (1,4). But that's far. Wait, no. To push east, the agent must be west of the stone. So if the stone is at (2,4), west is (1,4) pos14. The agent would need to get to pos14, which is column1, row4. That's quite a journey. Alternatively, perhaps pushing the stone south to pos25, then east to pos35. Because pos25 is at (2,5), and moving east from pos25 to pos35 is allowed via dirright. So if the stone is at pos25, the agent can push it east to pos35 (3,5), which is a goal. So how to get there.

Let's plan:

1. Agent moves from pos12 (1,2) to pos22 (2,2) via dirright.

2. Agent moves from pos22 (2,2) to pos23 (2,3) via dirdown.

3. Agent moves from pos23 (2,3) to pos24 (2,4) via dirdown. Wait, but pos24 has the stone. So the agent can't move there unless they are pushing the stone.

So instead, the agent is at pos23 (2,3). To push the stone south to pos25 (2,5), the agent would need to be at pos24's north (pos23) and push it south. But to do that, the agent must be at pos24's north (pos23) and push in the south direction. So the action would be pushtonongoal, since pos25 is not a goal. Then, once the stone is at pos25, the agent needs to push it east to pos35 (3,5), which is a goal.

But how to get the agent to pos25's west to push it east. Let's see.

After pushing the stone to pos25 (2,5), the agent would be at pos24 (since after pushing, the agent moves into the stone's previous location). Wait, the effect of pushtonongoal is that the agent ends up at l_from (pos24 in this case?), but the stone is moved to l_to (pos25). Wait, the action "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d" has preconditions where the agent is at l_p (pos23), the stone is at l_from (pos24), and the direction from l_p to l_from is d (dirdown), and from l_from to l_to is d (dirdown again, if pushing to pos25). Wait, no. Let's think. The direction d for the push action is the direction from l_p to l_from and then from l_from to l_to. So for example, if the agent is at pos23 (l_p), the stone is at pos24 (l_from), and they want to push it to pos25 (l_to), the direction d from l_p to l_from is dirdown (pos23 to pos24), and from l_from to l_to is also dirdown (pos24 to pos25). So the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown

But after this action, the agent moves to pos24, the stone moves to pos25. Then, the agent is at pos24. Next, to push the stone from pos25 to pos35, the agent needs to be at pos25's west (pos15) or east (pos35?), but pos35 is a goal. Wait, pos25 is at (2,5). To push it east to pos35 (3,5), the agent needs to be west of pos25 (pos15). So pos15 is (1,5). The agent is at pos24 (2,4). How to get to pos15?

From pos24, possible moves are dirup to pos23, dirleft to pos14, dirright to pos34, dirdown to pos25. But pos25 now has the stone. So the agent can move from pos24 to pos14 via dirleft. Then from pos14 (1,4), move dirup to pos13 (1,3), then dirup to pos12 (1,2), dirright to pos22 (2,2), then dirdown to pos23 (2,3), dirright to pos24 (2,4) again. This seems convoluted. Alternatively, maybe there's a better path.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos25, the agent is at pos24. From there, move dirleft to pos14 (1,4). Then move up to pos13 (1,3), up to pos12 (1,2), right to pos22 (2,2), down to pos23 (2,3), right to pos24 (2,4) again? Not helpful.

Alternatively, the agent is at pos24, wants to get to pos25's west (pos15). From pos24, move dirleft to pos14 (1,4), then dirleft to pos13 (1,3), then dirleft to pos12 (1,2), etc. Wait, but moving left from pos14 (1,4) would be to pos13 (1,3). Then from pos13, left to pos12 (1,2). Then from pos12, right to pos22 (2,2), down to pos23 (2,3), down to pos24 (2,4) again. This isn't helping.

Alternatively, after the stone is at pos25, the agent needs to push it east to pos35. To do that, the agent must be at pos25's west (pos15). How to get there from pos24? The path would be:

From pos24, move dirleft to pos14 (1,4), then dirup to pos13 (1,3), dirup to pos12 (1,2), dirright to pos22 (2,2), dirdown to pos23 (2,3), dirdown to pos24 (2,4) again. Not helpful. Alternatively, from pos24, move dirup to pos23 (2,3), then dirup to pos22 (2,2), dirleft to pos12 (1,2), then move up to pos11 (1,1), then right to pos21 (2,1), etc. This is taking too long. Maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, consider pushing the stone east from pos24 to pos34 (3,4), then south to pos35 (3,5). To push east from pos24 to pos34, the agent must be west of pos24, which is pos14 (1,4). So the agent needs to get to pos14. How?

From pos12, move dirright to pos22 (2,2), dirdown to pos23 (2,3), dirdown to pos24 (2,4) – but can't move there. Wait, the agent can't move into the stone's position. So the agent needs to go around. Alternatively, from pos22 (2,2), move dirright to pos32 (3,2), then dirdown to pos33 (3,3), then dirleft to pos23 (2,3), then down to pos24 (2,4) again. No.

Alternatively, from pos12, move dirdown to pos13 (1,3), then dirright to pos23 (2,3), then dirdown to pos24 (2,4) – again, same problem.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach. Let's think again.

The stone is at pos24 (2,4). The goal is pos35 (3,5). The only goal location is pos35. So the stone needs to reach pos35.

To push the stone east from pos24 to pos34 (3,4), the agent needs to be west of pos24 (pos14) and push east. To reach pos14, the agent would have to go from pos12 to pos22, then to pos23, then to pos24, but can't. Alternatively, take a longer route. From pos12, move dirup to pos11 (1,1), then dirright to pos21 (2,1), then dirdown to pos22 (2,2), then dirdown to pos23 (2,3), then dirleft to pos13 (1,3), then dirdown to pos14 (1,4). That's a lot of moves, but possible.

Once the agent is at pos14 (1,4), they can push the stone east to pos34 (3,4). Wait, no. To push east from pos24 to pos34, the direction from l_p (pos14) to l_from (pos24) must be possible. But how? pos14 is at (1,4), pos24 is at (2,4). The direction from pos14 to pos24 is dirright. So the action would be pushtogoal (if pos34 is a goal, but pos34 isn't a goal). Wait, pos34 is not a goal. So the action would be pushtonongoal. Then, the stone is at pos34 (3,4). Then, the agent is at pos24 (after pushing). Now, to push the stone from pos34 to pos35 (3,5), which is a goal. The agent needs to be north of pos34 (pos33) to push it south, or west of pos34 (pos24) to push east. But pos34 is at (3,4). To push south to pos35 (3,5), the agent needs to be at pos34's north (pos33) and push south. So the agent needs to get to pos33.

But after pushing the stone to pos34, the agent is at pos24. From there, moving to pos34 would require going east, but pos34 has the stone now. So the agent needs to find another path.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos34, the agent is at pos24. To get to pos33, the agent can move from pos24 dirright to pos34 (but the stone is there now). No, can't. So the agent must find another way.

This is getting very complicated. Maybe a better approach is to move the stone from pos24 to pos25 first, then to pos35.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Agent moves from pos12 to pos22 (dirright).

2. Agent moves from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown).

3. Agent pushes the stone from pos24 to pos25 using pushtonongoal. So the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown

This requires that pos25 is clear. According to the initial state, pos25 is clear. So this is possible.

After this action, the agent is at pos24, and the stone is at pos25.

4. Now, the agent needs to push the stone from pos25 to pos35. But to do that, the agent must be west of pos25 (pos15) and push east (dirright). But pos15 is clear. So the agent needs to get to pos15.

But the agent is at pos24. How to get to pos15?

From pos24, the agent can move dirup to pos23, then dirup to pos22, then dirleft to pos12, then dirup to pos11, then dirright to pos21 (2,1), dirdown to pos22 (2,2), etc. This is taking too many steps. Maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, from pos24, move dirleft to pos14 (1,4). Then move dirup to pos13 (1,3), dirup to pos12 (1,2), dirright to pos22 (2,2), dirdown to pos23 (2,3), dirdown to pos24 (2,4) again. Not helpful.

Alternatively, from pos24, move dirleft to pos14 (1,4). Then move dirleft to pos13 (1,3), dirleft to pos12 (1,2), dirleft to pos11 (1,1), then dirright to pos21 (2,1), dirdown to pos22 (2,2), dirdown to pos23 (2,3), then dirright to pos24 (2,4) again. Still stuck.

Wait, perhaps there's another way. After pushing the stone to pos25, the agent is at pos24. From there, move dirup to pos23 (2,3), then dirleft to pos13 (1,3), then dirup to pos12 (1,2), then dirleft to pos11 (1,1), then dirright to pos21 (2,1), dirright to pos31 (3,1), etc. This is taking way too many steps. This approach might not be optimal.

Maybe there's a better path. Let's think differently. Instead of pushing the stone to pos25 first, maybe push it east to pos34 first.

To push east from pos24 to pos34, the agent needs to be at pos24's west, which is pos14. So the agent must get to pos14.

From pos12, the path to pos14:

pos12 -> pos13 (dirdown), then pos14 (dirdown).

So steps:

1. move player1 from pos12 to pos13 (dirdown).

2. move player1 from pos13 to pos14 (dirdown).

Now, agent is at pos14. Then, push the stone from pos24 to pos34 (dirright):

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright.

Wait, but can the agent push from pos14 to pos24 (direction dirright)? Because pos14 is (1,4), pos24 is (2,4). So moving from pos14 to pos24 is dirright. Then from pos24 to pos34 is dirright again. So the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright.

Preconditions check:

- agent is at pos14: yes.

- stone is at pos24: yes.

- pos34 is clear: yes, according to initial state.

- can move from pos14 to pos24 via dirright: yes (allowed move from pos14 to pos24 via dirright).

- can move from pos24 to pos34 via dirright: yes (allowed move from pos24 to pos34 via dirright).

- pos34 is a non-goal location: yes, since the only goal is pos35.

So this action is valid.

After this action, the stone is at pos34, agent is at pos24.

Then, the stone is at pos34. Now, we need to push it south to pos35 (3,5), which is a goal.

To push south from pos34 to pos35, the agent needs to be north of pos34 (pos33) and push south. So the agent must get to pos33.

The agent is currently at pos24. How to get to pos33.

From pos24, possible moves:

dirleft to pos14 (1,4), dirup to pos23 (2,3), dirright to pos34 (3,4) – but pos34 now has the stone. So can't move there. dirdown to pos25 (2,5).

So agent is at pos24. Can move to pos23 (dirup), then to pos22 (dirup), then to pos32 (dirright), then to pos33 (dirdown).

Path:

1. move from pos24 to pos23 (dirup).

2. move from pos23 to pos22 (dirup).

3. move from pos22 to pos32 (dirright).

4. move from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown).

Now, agent is at pos33.

Then, push the stone from pos34 to pos35 (dirdown):

Action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown.

Preconditions:

- agent at pos33: yes.

- stone at pos34: yes.

- pos35 is clear: initially yes.

- can move from pos33 to pos34 via dirdown: yes (allowed move from pos33 to pos34 via dirdown).

- can move from pos34 to pos35 via dirdown: yes (allowed move from pos34 to pos35 via dirdown).

- pos35 is a goal location: yes.

This action is valid.

After this, the stone is at pos35 (goal), and the agent is at pos34.

So the total plan would be:

1. move player1 from pos12 to pos13 (dirdown).

2. move player1 from pos13 to pos14 (dirdown).

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright.

4. move player1 from pos24 to pos23 (dirup).

5. move player1 from pos23 to pos22 (dirup).

6. move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (dirright).

7. move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown).

8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown.

But this is 8 actions. However, maybe there's a shorter path.

Wait, after step 3, the agent is at pos24. Then, instead of moving all the way to pos33, perhaps there's a shorter path. From pos24, can the agent move dirright to pos34? But pos34 has the stone now. So no. So agent is at pos24. To reach pos33:

pos24 -> pos23 (dirup)

pos23 -> pos22 (dirup)

pos22 -> pos32 (dirright)

pos32 -> pos33 (dirdown)

That's 4 moves. Then pushing. Total steps: 3 (initial moves) + 4 (moves to pos33) + 1 (push) = 8.

But maybe there's a better way. Let's see.

Alternative approach: after pushing the stone to pos34, the agent is at pos24. Instead of moving up to pos23, can the agent move dirright to pos34? No, because the stone is there. So no. So agent must move another way.

Alternative path from pos24 to pos33:

pos24 -> pos23 (dirup)

pos23 -> pos24 is not possible.

Alternatively, pos24 -> pos34 is blocked. So no.

So the steps are necessary.

But maybe there's a shorter path. Let me check the initial path again.

Initial plan:

1. move pos12 to pos13 (dirdown)

2. move pos13 to pos14 (dirdown)

3. pushtonongoal pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright

4. move pos24 to pos23 (dirup)

5. move pos23 to pos22 (dirup)

6. move pos22 to pos32 (dirright)

7. move pos32 to pos33 (dirdown)

8. pushtogoal pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown

Is there a way to reduce the number of steps?

Wait, after step 3, agent is at pos24. From pos24, can the agent move dirright to pos34? No, because the stone is there. So must go via pos23.

What if after step 3, the agent moves from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown)? But pos25 is clear. Then, from pos25, move dirright to pos35 (dirright). But pos35 is a goal, but it's empty. So the agent can move there. Wait, but pos25 to pos35 is allowed via dirright. So:

After step 3, agent is at pos24.

4. move pos24 to pos25 (dirdown)

5. move pos25 to pos35 (dirright)

Now, agent is at pos35. Then, push the stone from pos34 to pos35. But the agent is at pos35, and the stone is at pos34. To push the stone south to pos35, the agent needs to be north of the stone (pos34) to push south. But the agent is at pos35. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, the agent is at pos35. Can the agent move north to pos34 (dirup)? pos34 has the stone, so no. So the agent can't move there.

So this path doesn't help.

Alternative idea: After step 3, the stone is at pos34. The agent is at pos24. Instead of moving north to pos23, maybe the agent can move east to pos34? No, can't. So must find another way.

Hmm. Maybe the initial plan is the shortest possible. But 8 actions seem long. Let's think again.

Alternative approach: pushing the stone from pos24 to pos34 in one action, then pos34 to pos35 in another. But how?

Original plan uses 8 steps. But maybe there's a shorter path.

Wait, the agent starts at pos12. Let's try another route:

From pos12, move dirright to pos22 (1 step).

From pos22, move dirright to pos32 (2 steps).

From pos32, move dirdown to pos33 (3 steps).

From pos33, move dirdown to pos34 (4 steps). But pos34 is clear, so can move.

Wait, but pos34 is clear, but after moving there, then the agent can push the stone. But the stone is at pos24. So this approach doesn't help.

Alternatively, the agent moves to pos34 to be able to push the stone. But the stone is at pos24. So that's not adjacent.

Alternatively, the agent needs to reach pos34 to push the stone from pos34 to pos35. But the stone isn't there yet.

Hmm. It seems the initial plan might be the way to go, but I'm not sure. Let me count the steps again:

1. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown

2. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright

4. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup

5. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup

6. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright

7. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown

8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown

That's 8 steps. But maybe there's a more optimal path.

Wait, after step 3, the agent is at pos24. From there, can they move to pos34 via dirright? No, because the stone is there now. So agent can't. So must go around.

Alternative idea: after step 3, the agent is at pos24. Can the agent move dirleft to pos14 (1 step), then dirup to pos13 (2), dirup to pos12 (3), dirright to pos22 (4), dirdown to pos23 (5), dirright to pos24 (6) again. But this is not helpful.

Alternatively, after step 3, the agent is at pos24. From there, move dirup to pos23 (step4), then dirright to pos24 again (can't). So no.

Alternatively, from pos24, move dirup to pos23 (step4), then dirright to pos33 (from pos23, dirright to pos33). But allowed moves from pos23 are dirright to pos33. So yes.

Wait, from pos23, the agent can move dirright to pos33 (allowed: "You may move from location pos23 to location pos33 following direction dirright"). So step4: move pos24 to pos23 (dirup). Step5: move pos23 to pos33 (dirright). Then step6: push the stone from pos34 to pos35.

So revised steps:

1. move pos12 to pos13 (dirdown)

2. move pos13 to pos14 (dirdown)

3. pushtonongoal pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright

4. move pos24 to pos23 (dirup)

5. move pos23 to pos33 (dirright)

6. pushtogoal pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown

This is 6 steps. That's better. Let's check if this is possible.

Step5: agent moves from pos23 to pos33 via dirright. Yes, allowed.

Step6: pushtogoal action requires agent at pos33, stone at pos34. pos35 is clear. Direction from pos33 to pos34 is dirdown (since pos33 to pos34 is allowed via dirdown). Then from pos34 to pos35 is dirdown. So the action would be:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown.

Yes, valid. So this plan is 6 steps. Is this possible?

Yes! So the plan would be:

```

move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright
move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown
```

Let's verify each step's preconditions:

1. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown:

- agent is at pos12 (yes).

- pos13 is clear (yes).

- allowed to move from pos12 to pos13 via dirdown (yes, according to allowed moves).

2. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown:

- agent at pos13 (yes after step1).

- pos14 clear (yes).

- allowed move (yes, pos13 to pos14 via dirdown).

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright:

- agent at pos14 (yes after step2).

- stone at pos24 (yes).

- pos34 clear (yes).

- can move from pos14 to pos24 via dirright (yes, allowed move).

- can move from pos24 to pos34 via dirright (yes, allowed move).

- pos34 is non-goal (yes, since only pos35 is goal).

4. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup:

After step3, agent is at pos24 (from the action's effects). So moving from pos24 to pos23 via dirup:

- agent at pos24 (yes).

- pos23 clear (yes, since after pushing, pos24 is cleared? Wait, after pushtonongoal, the agent moves to pos24, which was the stone's location. The stone is now at pos34. So pos24 is now occupied by the agent. So when moving from pos24 to pos23, the preconditions are:

- agent at pos24 (yes).

- pos23 clear (yes, since after step3, pos23 is clear. Because after pushtonongoal, the agent was at pos24, so pos23 remains clear.

- allowed move from pos24 to pos23 via dirup (yes, according to allowed moves: from pos24, dirup is to pos23).

5. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright:

- agent at pos23 (yes after step4).

- pos33 clear (yes).

- allowed move from pos23 to pos33 via dirright (yes).

6. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown:

- agent at pos33 (yes after step5).

- stone at pos34 (yes, after step3).

- pos35 clear (yes).

- can move from pos33 to pos34 via dirdown (yes, allowed move).

- can move from pos34 to pos35 via dirdown (yes, allowed move).

- pos35 is goal (yes).

This plan is valid and has 6 steps. Is there a shorter plan?

Let's see. Can we eliminate some steps?

What if after step3, the agent is at pos24. Instead of moving up to pos23, can they move directly to pos34? No, because the stone is there.

Alternatively, after step3, the agent is at pos24. Can they move dirright to pos34? No, because pos34 has the stone now.

So must move via pos23.

Alternative idea: from pos24, move dirup to pos23 (step4), then dirright to pos33 (step5), which is two moves, then push. So total steps: 6. This seems optimal.

Is there a way to reduce this further?

What if the agent takes a different path to reach pos14 faster?

From pos12 to pos14:

Current steps: 2 moves (pos12 -> pos13 -> pos14).

Is there a quicker way? For example, pos12 -> pos22 -> pos23 -> pos24, but can't due to stone. Or pos12 -> pos22 -> pos23 -> pos13 -> pos14.

No, that's longer.

So the initial path is the shortest.

Another approach: the agent moves from pos12 to pos22 (dirright), then to pos23 (dirdown), then to pos24 (dirdown) but can't. So no.

So the current plan with 6 steps seems to be the optimal one.
