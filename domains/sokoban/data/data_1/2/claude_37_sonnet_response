I need to solve a "Sokoban" style problem where we need to push a stone to a goal location, while respecting certain constraints. Let me break it down:

- We have a 5x5 grid (positions pos11 through pos55)
- There's one stone (stone1) and one agent (player1)
- The goal is to move stone1 to a goal location (pos35)
- The constraint is that pos14 must always remain clear

Initial state:
- player1 is at pos12
- stone1 is at pos24
- pos35 is the goal location
- pos14 must remain clear

I need to figure out a sequence of actions to push stone1 to pos35 while keeping pos14 clear.

Let me visualize the grid to help me plan better:
```
1 2 3 4 5
---------
1|. P . . .|
2|. . . S .|
3|. . . . G|
4|. . . . .|
5|. . . . .|
```
Where:
- P = player1 (at pos12)
- S = stone1 (at pos24)
- G = goal (at pos35)
- . = empty space

The constraint is that pos14 (4th position in the 1st row) must always remain clear.

First, let me think about the possible ways to push stone1 to the goal location (pos35):
1. Push it down from pos24 to pos25, then right from pos25 to pos35
2. Push it right from pos24 to pos34, then down from pos34 to pos35

Since there's a constraint that pos14 must always remain clear, I need to make sure none of my actions would involve pushing stone1 to pos14.

Looking at option 1:
- Push stone1 from pos24 to pos25 (down)
- Push stone1 from pos25 to pos35 (right)
This path doesn't involve pos14, so it respects the constraint.

Looking at option 2:
- Push stone1 from pos24 to pos34 (right)
- Push stone1 from pos34 to pos35 (down)
This path also doesn't involve pos14, so it respects the constraint.

Either option seems viable. I'll go with option 1 for now.

To push stone1 from pos24 to pos25 (downward), player1 needs to be at pos23 (above stone1). From the initial position at pos12, player1 needs to move:
1. From pos12 to pos13 (down)
2. From pos13 to pos23 (right)

After pushing stone1 to pos25, player1 will be at pos24. To push stone1 from pos25 to pos35 (right), player1 needs to be at pos15 (to the left of stone1). From pos24, player1 needs to move:
1. From pos24 to pos23 (up)
2. From pos23 to pos13 (left)
3. From pos13 to pos14 (down)
4. From pos14 to pos15 (down)
5. From pos15 to pos25 (right)

Wait - this plan involves moving the player to pos14, which would make it "not clear", contradicting the constraint. Let me reconsider.

I misinterpreted the constraint. The constraint says "Location pos14 is clear" must hold in every state. This means the player and the stone can't be at pos14 at any point.

Given this constraint, option 2 might be more viable:
- Push stone1 from pos24 to pos34 (right)
- Push stone1 from pos34 to pos35 (down)

To push stone1 from pos24 to pos34 (right), player1 needs to be at pos14 (to the left of stone1).

But wait, that would make pos14 not clear. So this option is also not valid given the constraint.

Let me rethink. I think I was mistaken in interpreting the constraint. The constraint states that "Location pos14 is clear" must hold in every state. This means that neither the player nor the stone can be at pos14 at any point.

Given this constraint, I need to find a path for stone1 to go from pos24 to pos35 without ever being at pos14, and player1 must also never be at pos14.

Let's reconsider Option 1:
- Push stone1 from pos24 to pos25 (down)
- Push stone1 from pos25 to pos35 (right)

To push stone1 from pos24 to pos25, player1 needs to be at pos23. Player1 can get to pos23 without going through pos14.

After pushing stone1 to pos25, player1 will be at pos24. To push stone1 from pos25 to pos35 (right), player1 needs to be at pos15 (to the left of stone1). From pos24, player1 can't go through pos14 to get to pos15.

Let's see if player1 can go around:
1. From pos24 to pos23 (up)
2. From pos23 to pos22 (up)
3. From pos22 to pos21 (up)
4. From pos21 to pos11 (left)
5. From pos11 to pos12 (down)
6. From pos12 to pos13 (down)
7. From pos13 to pos15 (down)

Hmm, it seems I can't actually move from pos13 directly to pos15. This is because the possible moves from pos13 are:
- To pos23 (right)
- To pos12 (up)
- To pos14 (down)

And from pos14, I can move to pos15. But I can't use pos14 due to the constraint.

Let's check Option 2 again:
- Push stone1 from pos24 to pos34 (right)
- Push stone1 from pos34 to pos35 (down)

To push stone1 from pos24 to pos34, player1 needs to be at pos14 (to the left of stone1). But this contradicts the constraint.

I think there's a flaw in my understanding or in the problem statement. Let me double check the constraints and the available actions.

Ah, I re-read the action descriptions and I think I've been misinterpreting.

For a "move" action, the player moves from one location to another, making the destination location not clear.

For a "push" action, the player is at a location, the stone is at another location, and the player pushes the stone to a third location. The player then ends up at the location where the stone was, and the stone is at the new location.

So, the player doesn't always need to be adjacent to the stone to push it. The player can push the stone from any direction, as long as the player can get to the stone in that direction.

Given this understanding, let's revisit the problem:

Initial state:
- player1 is at pos12
- stone1 is at pos24
- pos35 is the goal location
- pos14 must remain clear

To push stone1 to the goal location (pos35), I can:
1. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos34 (right): player1 would need to be at position that can move to pos24 in the "right" direction. That would be pos14, but it's against our constraint.
2. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos25 (down): player1 would need to be at a position that can move to pos24 in the "down" direction. That would be pos23.

Let's go with option 2:
1. Move player1 from pos12 to pos13 (down)
2. Move player1 from pos13 to pos23 (right)
3. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos25 (using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown")
4. Now stone1 is at pos25 and player1 is at pos24

Next, to push stone1 from pos25 to pos35 (right):
5. Player1 would need to be at a position that can move to pos25 in the "right" direction. That would be pos15.
6. Move player1 from pos24 to pos14 (left) - But this contradicts our constraint!

So, I still can't find a valid plan. Let me re-check the action descriptions once more.

I think I'm confusing myself.

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.

This action says that the agent is at l_p, the stone is at l_from, and the agent pushes the stone to l_to. The direction d should be the direction from l_from to l_to.

The preconditions for "pushtogoal" action include:
- agent p is at location l_p
- stone s is at location l_from
- location l_to is clear
- you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d
- you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d
- location l_to is a goal location

The effect is that the stone moves to l_to, the agent moves to l_from, and l_p becomes clear.

Let's reconsider our plan with this understanding:

Initial state:
- player1 is at pos12
- stone1 is at pos24
- pos35 is the goal location
- pos14 must remain clear

To push stone1 to the goal location (pos35), I need to find a position for player1 from which it can push stone1 directly to pos35. This seems challenging because pos35 is not adjacent to pos24.

I need to first move stone1 to a location from which it can be pushed to pos35. Potential locations include:
1. pos34 (to pos35's up)
2. pos25 (to pos35's left)

To push stone1 to pos34:
- player1 would need to be adjacent to pos24 and push stone1 in the "right" direction
- player1 could be at pos14, but this would contradict the constraint
- player1 could be at pos23, but pushing from pos23 would move stone1 down, not right
- player1 could be at pos25, but pushing from pos25 would move stone1 up, not right
- player1 could be at pos34, but pos34 is where we want to push stone1 to, so player1 can't be there
- No other position allows for pushing stone1 right

To push stone1 to pos25:
- player1 would need to be adjacent to pos24 and push stone1 in the "down" direction
- player1 could be at pos14, but this would contradict the constraint
- player1 could be at pos23, and pushing from pos23 would move stone1 down to pos25
- player1 could be at pos34, but pushing from pos34 would move stone1 left, not down
- No other position allows for pushing stone1 down

So, I could push stone1 to pos25 with player1 at pos23.

Once stone1 is at pos25, I can push it to pos35:
- player1 would need to be adjacent to pos25 and push stone1 in the "right" direction
- player1 could be at pos15, and pushing from pos15 would move stone1 right to pos35
- player1 could be at pos24, but pushing from pos24 would move stone1 down, not right
- player1 could be at pos26, but this position doesn't exist
- player1 could be at pos35, but pos35 is where we want to push stone1 to, so player1 can't be there
- No other position allows for pushing stone1 right

So, I could push stone1 from pos25 to pos35 with player1 at pos15.

Now, let's plan the sequence of actions:
1. Move player1 from pos12 to pos13 (down)
2. Move player1 from pos13 to pos23 (right)
3. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos25 (using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown")
4. Now stone1 is at pos25 and player1 is at pos24
5. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23 (up)
6. Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 (left)
7. Move player1 from pos13 to pos12 (up)
8. Move player1 from pos12 to pos11 (up)
9. Move player1 from pos11 to pos21 (right)
10. Move player1 from pos21 to pos22 (down)
11. Move player1 from pos22 to pos23 (down)
12. Move player1 from pos23 to pos33 (right)
13. Move player1 from pos33 to pos34 (down)
14. Move player1 from pos34 to pos35 (down)
15. Move player1 from pos35 to pos25 (left)
16. Move player1 from pos25 to pos15 (left)
17. Push stone1 from pos25 to pos35 (using action "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos15 pos25 pos35 dirright")
18. Now stone1 is at pos35 (a goal location) and player1 is at pos25

Hm, I think there's still some confusion. Let me really break down the action definitions step by step.

For the "pushtogoal" action:
"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.

The preconditions include:
- agent p is at location l_p
- stone s is at location l_from
- location l_to is clear
- you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d
- you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d
- location l_to is a goal location

The last two preconditions are key. It says:
- you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d
- you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d

This means that l_p, l_from, and l_to must be in a straight line according to direction d. For example, if direction d is "right", then l_p is to the left of l_from, and l_from is to the left of l_to.

Let's reconsider my previous plan:

Step 17: Push stone1 from pos25 to pos35 (using action "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos15 pos25 pos35 dirright")

Here:
- player1 is at pos15
- stone1 is at pos25
- We want to push stone1 to pos35
- The direction is "right"

Is pos15 to the left of pos25, and is pos25 to the left of pos35? Let's check:
- pos15 is in row 1, column 5
- pos25 is in row 2, column 5
- pos35 is in row 3, column 5

So, pos15 is not to the left of pos25; it's above it. And pos25 is not to the left of pos35; it's above it. The direction should be "dirdown", not "dirright".

But wait – the goal is for stone1 to be at a goal location, which is pos35. So, we need to push stone1 from its current location (pos24) to pos35.

Let's start again:

Initial state:
- player1 is at pos12
- stone1 is at pos24
- pos35 is the goal location
- pos14 must remain clear

From pos24, the possible directions to push stone1 are:
- Up (to pos23)
- Down (to pos25)
- Left (to pos14) - This is against our constraint
- Right (to pos34)

If we push stone1 to pos25, we'd need to push it again to pos35 (which is down and to the right of pos25).

If we push stone1 to pos34, we'd need to push it again to pos35 (which is down from pos34).

Both options require two pushes. Let's go with pushing to pos34 and then to pos35. It seems cleaner because we're moving in straight lines.

From the initial state, let's get player1 to a position where it can push stone1 from pos24 to pos34:
- player1 would need to be at a position from which it can push stone1 in the "right" direction (from pos24 to pos34)
- Given the preconditions for the push action, player1 would need to be at a position from which it can get to pos24 in the "right" direction, and from pos24, we can get to pos34 in the "right" direction
- This means player1 would need to be at a position that's directly to the left of pos24, which is pos14
- But this contradicts our constraint that pos14 must always remain clear

Hmm, it seems we can't push stone1 right from pos24 to pos34 because player1 would need to go through pos14.

Let's try pushing stone1 down from pos24 to pos25:
- player1 would need to be at a position from which it can push stone1 in the "down" direction (from pos24 to pos25)
- Given the preconditions for the push action, player1 would need to be at a position from which it can get to pos24 in the "down" direction, and from pos24, we can get to pos25 in the "down" direction
- This means player1 would need to be at a position that's directly above pos24, which is pos23

1. Move player1 from pos12 to pos13 (down)
2. Move player1 from pos13 to pos23 (right)
3. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos25 (using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown")

After this, stone1 is at pos25 and player1 is at pos24.

Now, we need to push stone1 from pos25 to pos35:
- player1 would need to be at a position from which it can push stone1 in the "right" direction (from pos25 to pos35)
- Given the preconditions for the push action, player1 would need to be at a position from which it can get to pos25 in the "right" direction, and from pos25, we can get to pos35 in the "right" direction
- This means player1 would need to be at a position that's directly to the left of pos25, which is pos15

So, player1 needs to move from pos24 to pos15 without going through pos14.

Let's see if this is possible:
1. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23 (up)
2. Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 (left)
3. Move player1 from pos13 to pos12 (up)
4. Move player1 from pos12 to pos11 (up)
5. Move player1 from pos11 to pos21 (right)
6. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (right)
7. Move player1 from pos31 to pos41 (right)
8. Move player1 from pos41 to pos51 (right)
9. Move player1 from pos51 to pos52 (down)
10. Move player1 from pos52 to pos53 (down)
11. Move player1 from pos53 to pos54 (down)
12. Move player1 from pos54 to pos55 (down)
13. Move player1 from pos55 to pos45 (left)
14. Move player1 from pos45 to pos35 (left)
15. Move player1 from pos35 to pos25 (left)
16. Move player1 from pos25 to pos15 (left)

Ok, that's a lot of steps, and actually there's a problem: at step 16, I move the player to where the stone is, which is not allowed. Let me try again.

Ah, I think got ahead of myself. After step 3, stone1 is at pos25 and player1 is at pos24. When executing a push action, the player ends up at the position where the stone was, and the stone moves to the new position.

Let's redo our push plan:

From pos24, I can push stone1 to:
- pos25 (down)
- pos34 (right)

If I push stone1 to pos25, I'd then need to push it to pos35 (right). To do this, I'd need to position player1 to the left of pos25, which is pos15, without ever stepping on pos14. This seems challenging but possible.

If I push stone1 to pos34, I'd then need to push it to pos35 (down). To do this, I'd need to position player1 above pos34, which is pos33. This seems more straightforward.

Let's try the second option:

To push stone1 from pos24 to pos34, player1 needs to be at a position from which it can get to pos24 in the "right" direction. This would be a position to the left of pos24, which is pos14. But this contradicts our constraint.

Looks like the first option is our only choice.

To push stone1 from pos24 to pos25, player1 needs to be at a position from which it can get to pos24 in the "down" direction. This would be a position above pos24, which is pos23.

1. Move player1 from pos12 to pos13 (down)
2. Move player1 from pos13 to pos23 (right)
3. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos25 (using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown")

After this, stone1 is at pos25 and player1 is at pos24.

Now, to push stone1 from pos25 to pos35, player1 needs to be at a position from which it can get to pos25 in the "right" direction. This would be a position to the left of pos25, which is pos15.

However, it seems challenging to get player1 from pos24 to pos15 without ever stepping on pos14. Let's see if there's a way around pos14.

From pos24, player1 can move:
- Up to pos23
- Down to pos25 (but stone1 is there)
- Left to pos14 (against the constraint)
- Right to pos34

Maybe I can go around the grid:

1. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 (right)
2. Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 (right)
3. Move player1 from pos44 to pos54 (right)
4. Move player1 from pos54 to pos53 (up)
5. Move player1 from pos53 to pos52 (up)
6. Move player1 from pos52 to pos51 (up)
7. Move player1 from pos51 to pos41 (left)
8. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 (left)
9. Move player1 from pos31 to pos21 (left)
10. Move player1 from pos21 to pos11 (left)
11. Move player1 from pos11 to pos12 (down)
12. Move player1 from pos12 to pos13 (down)
13. Move player1 from pos13 to pos15 (down)

Hmm, I can't move from pos13 to pos15 directly. I would need to go through pos14, which is against our constraint.

Let me go back to the grid and check the possible moves:

From pos13, I can move:
- Up to pos12
- Down to pos14 (against the constraint)
- Left (there's no pos03)
- Right to pos23

Looks like I can't get to pos15 without passing through pos14. This is a dilemma.

Actually, I think I was mistaken in my reasoning. The constraint doesn't state that player1 can't be at pos14; it just says "Location pos14 is clear" must hold in every state.

According to the domain specification, a location is clear if neither a player nor a stone is present at that location. If player1 moves to pos14, the location would no longer be clear, which would violate the constraint.

So, there doesn't seem to be a way to push stone1 to pos35 without violating the constraint that pos14 must always remain clear.

Wait, let's double check the specifications. For the move action:

"move p l_from l_to d": After performing this action, (i) agent p is no longer at location l_from, (ii) location l_to is no longer clear, (iii) agent p is at location l_to, and (iv) location l_from is clear.

This means that when player1 moves to a location, that location is no longer clear. And when player1 leaves a location, that location becomes clear.

I'm actually thinking there is no valid plan for this problem given the constraint. Let's try another approach.

Maybe the constraint means the stone can't be at pos14, but the player can? Let's re-read the domain specifications once more.

Ah, I think I need to consider the exact wording of the constraint: "The following expression must hold in every state: Location pos14 is clear".

Looking at the initial state, it says "Location pos14 is clear", which means there's no player or stone at that location. If this must hold in every state, it means at no point should pos14 have a player or stone on it.

I don't see a way to navigate the grid such that stone1 ends up at the goal location without either the player or the stone ever being at pos14. This seems like a limiting constraint.

In the grid, pos14 is above pos24, which is where stone1 starts. Pos14 is also the direct path from the player's starting position to pos15, which is a position the player needs to be in to push the stone to the goal.

Let me try to visualize all possible ways to move stone1 from pos24 to pos35, while avoiding pos14:

1. From pos24, push stone1 down to pos25, then push it right to pos35.
2. From pos24, push stone1 right to pos34, then push it down to pos35.

For Option 1, we would need to push stone1 from pos25 to pos35 with player1 at pos15. But to get to pos15, player1 would need to go through pos14, which violates the constraint.

For Option 2, we would need to push stone1 from pos24 to pos34 with player1 at pos14. But this again violates the constraint.

Actually, instead of analyzing more by hand, let me try to write out the logical flow:

If I want to move stone1 to pos35, I need to first get it adjacent to pos35, which means either at pos34 or pos25.

To get stone1 to pos34 from pos24, I would need to push it right, which means player1 would need to be at pos14. But this violates the constraint.

To get stone1 to pos25 from pos24, I would need to push it down, which means player1 would need to be at pos23. After pushing, stone1 would be at pos25 and player1 would be at pos24.

Now, to push stone1 from pos25 to pos35, player1 would need to be at pos15. To get to pos15 from pos24, player1 would need to go through pos14, which violates the constraint. Alternatively, player1 could try to go around the grid, but as I've analyzed, there's no path to pos15 without passing through pos14.

Given these constraints, it does not seem possible to get stone1 to pos35 without either the player or the stone ever being at pos14.

Hmm, let me rethink. I'm wondering if I've been interpreting the actions correctly. Let's go back to the action definitions.

For the push actions, the preconditions include:
- You can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d
- You can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d

These conditions ensure that the push is in a straight line: the player, the stone, and the destination are all on the same line.

For the move action, the precondition is:
- You can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d

This ensures that the player moves in a valid direction.

Given these preconditions, and the constraints of the grid, I don't see a way to get stone1 to pos35 without either the player or the stone ever being at pos14.

Actually let's check again - is there any other direction we could push stone1 in?

From pos24, we could potentially push stone1:
- Up to pos23 (requires player1 at pos22)
- Down to pos25 (requires player1 at pos23)
- Left to pos14 (requires player1 at pos04, which doesn't exist)
- Right to pos34 (requires player1 at pos14, which violates the constraint)

So that means our only options are pushing stone1 up to pos23 or down to pos25. Let's explore the ramifications of these:

If we push stone1 to pos23, we'd then need to get it to pos35. The possible paths would be:
- From pos23 to pos33 to pos35 (right then down)
- From pos23 to pos24 to pos34 to pos35 (down then right then down)
- From pos23 to pos24 to pos25 to pos35 (down then down then right)
- From pos23 to pos33 to pos34 to pos35 (right then down then down)
- From pos23 to pos13 to pos14 to pos15 to pos25 to pos35 (left then down then down then down then right)

All of these paths either require the stone to be at pos14 or the player to be at pos14 to push the stone, both of which violate the constraint.

If we push stone1 to pos25, we'd then need to get it to pos35. The direct path is from pos25 to pos35 (right), which requires player1 to be at pos15. But to get to pos15, player1 would need to pass through pos14, which violates the constraint.

Wait, let's double-check if the player can push the stone in the opposite direction of the goal. For instance, if player1 is at pos33, can it push stone1 from pos23 to pos13?

Let's check the action definition again:
"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.

The preconditions include:
- agent p is at location l_p
- stone s is at location l_from
- location l_to is clear
- you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d
- you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d
- location l_to is a goal location

According to these preconditions, the direction d specifies how to get from l_p to l_from and from l_from to l_to. This means that the player, the stone, and the destination should be in a straight line.

So no, if player1 is at pos33, it can't push stone1 from pos23 to pos13, because the three positions aren't in a straight line according to any of the available directions. It's also worth noting that this would move the stone away from the goal rather than towards it, but that's not the primary issue.

So, we're back to our original conclusion: it doesn't seem possible to get stone1 to pos35 without either the player or the stone ever being at pos14.

Actually, let me try to understand the grid even better. The naming convention for positions seems to be:
pos11, pos12, ... pos15 for the first row
pos21, pos22, ... pos25 for the second row
...and so on.

So, pos14 is on the first row, fourth column. The constraint is that this position must always remain clear.

Ah - the stone starts at pos24 and the goal is at pos35. Let me double check our initial state:
- player1 is at pos12 (1st row, 2nd column)
- stone1 is at pos24 (2nd row, 4th column)
- Position pos35 (3rd row, 5th column) is the goal

And the constraint is that pos14 (1st row, 4th column) must always be clear.

I think I've been viewing the grid correctly, but I want to re-check my pathfinding logic just to be sure.

To push stone1 from pos24 to pos35 (its goal location), I need to find a valid path. Given the constraint that pos14 must always remain clear, I've been trying to find a path that avoids pos14.

From pos24, there are a few directions in which stone1 can be pushed:
- Up (to pos14) - This violates the constraint
- Down (to pos25)
- Left (to pos23)
- Right (to pos34)

Let's explore pushing stone1 down to pos25:
- To push stone1 from pos24 to pos25, player1 needs to be at pos23
- After pushing, stone1 would be at pos25 and player1 would be at pos24
- To get stone1 to the goal (pos35), it needs to be pushed right from pos25
- This requires player1 to be at pos15 (to the left of pos25)
- But to get to pos15 from pos24, player1 would need to go through pos14, which violates the constraint, or find another route

Let's check if there's a way to get to pos15 from pos24 without going through pos14:

Let's explore pushing stone1 right to pos34:
- To push stone1 from pos24 to pos34, player1 needs to be at pos14
- But this violates the constraint

Let's explore pushing stone1 left to pos23:
- To push stone1 from pos24 to pos23, player1 needs to be at pos25
- After pushing, stone1 would be at pos23 and player1 would be at pos24
- To get stone1 to the goal (pos35), it would need to be pushed in multiple steps
- From pos23, it could be pushed right to pos33, and then down to pos35
- To push stone1 from pos23 to pos33, player1 needs to be at pos13 (to the left of pos23)
- From pos24, player1 can go to pos23 (up), then to pos13 (left)
- After pushing, stone1 would be at pos33 and player1 would be at pos23
- To push stone1 from pos33 to pos35, player1 needs to be at pos31 (above pos33)
- From pos23, player1 can go to pos22 (up), then to pos21 (up), then to pos31 (right)
- After pushing, stone1 would be at pos35 (goal) and player1 would be at pos33

Let's verify this path step by step:
1. Move player1 from pos12 to pos13 (down)
2. Move player1 from pos13 to pos23 (right)
3. Temporarily, player1 is at pos23

Now I need to push stone1 from where it is at pos24 to another location. Let's try pushing it left to pos23:
4. To push stone1 from pos24 to pos23, player1 needs to be at pos25. But player1 is at pos23, not pos25. So this isn't immediately possible.

Let's try pushing stone1 down to pos25:
4. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos25 (using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown")
5. After pushing, stone1 is at pos25 and player1 is at pos24

To push stone1 from pos25 to pos35, player1 needs to be at pos15. From pos24, the direct path to pos15 (through pos14) is not available due to the constraint.

Let's explore the "longer" route:
6. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 (right)
7. Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 (right)
8. Move player1 from pos44 to pos54 (right)
9. Move player1 from pos54 to pos53 (up)
10. Move player1 from pos53 to pos52 (up)
11. Move player1 from pos52 to pos51 (up)
12. Move player1 from pos51 to pos41 (left)
13. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 (left)
14. Move player1 from pos31 to pos21 (left)
15. Move player1 from pos21 to pos11 (left)
16. Move player1 from pos11 to pos12 (down)
17. Move player1 from pos12 to pos13 (down)

From pos13, there's no direct path to pos15 without going through pos14, which is against our constraint.

Hmmm this is frustrating.

Ah actually, let's think about potential paths that push the stone via positions different from the ones I already considered. So far, I've looked at pushing stone1 from:
- pos24 to pos14 (violates constraint)
- pos24 to pos25
- pos24 to pos23
- pos24 to pos34 (requires player1 at pos14, which violates the constraint)

Let's check if there are valid paths from the next set of positions:

From pos25:
- Push stone1 from pos25 to pos15 (up) - This requires player1 at pos35, which is valid
- Push stone1 from pos25 to pos35 (right) - This requires player1 at pos15, which seems unreachable without going through pos14
- Push stone1 from pos25 to pos24 (up) - This requires player1 at pos26, which doesn't exist

From pos23:
- Push stone1 from pos23 to pos13 (up) - This requires player1 at pos33, which is valid
- Push stone1 from pos23 to pos33 (right) - This requires player1 at pos13, which is valid
- Push stone1 from pos23 to pos24 (down) - This requires player1 at pos22, which is valid
- Push stone1 from pos23 to pos22 (up) - This requires player1 at pos24, which is valid

This gives us a multitude of possible paths. Let's see if we can find a valid path to get stone1 to the goal (pos35):

Option 1: Push stone1 from pos24 to pos25, then from pos25 to pos15 (up), and then somehow to the goal.
Option 2: Push stone1 from pos24 to pos23, then from pos23 to pos13 (up), and then somehow to the goal.
Option 3: Push stone1 from pos24 to pos23, then from pos23 to pos33 (right), and then from pos33 to pos35 (down).

Let's explore Option 3 as it seems the most viable to the goal:
1. Move player1 from pos12 to pos13 (down)
2. Move player1 from pos13 to pos23 (right)
3. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos23 (using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos23 dirleft")
   Wait, this doesn't work because the direction needs to be from player1 to stone1, and that would be dirleft, not dirright.

I have more options to get stone1 to the goal:
1. Move player1 from pos12 to pos22 (right)
2. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (right)
3. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (down)
4. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos34 (using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos24 pos34 dirright")
   Wait, this doesn't work because the direction needs to be in a straight line, and pos33, pos24, and pos34 aren't in a straight line.

I think I'm causing myself confusion. Let's go back to the action definition:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.

The preconditions include:
- agent p is at location l_p
- stone s is at location l_from
- location l_to is clear
- you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d
- you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d
- location l_to is a goal location

The direction d indicates how to move from l_p to l_from and from l_from to l_to. 

So, if I'm at pos33 and I want to push stone1 from pos23 to pos13, the direction would be dirleft. This means from pos33, I should move left to get to pos23, and from pos23, I should move left to get to pos13.

Let's try to understand the action better with an example:
- Player1 is at pos23
- Stone1 is at pos24
- We want to push stone1 to pos25
- For this push, the direction is dirdown: from pos23, go down to get to pos24, and from pos24, go down to get to pos25.

If the player is at l_p, the stone is at l_from, and the direction is d, then the stone moves in direction d to l_to, and the player moves to l_from. In other words, the player 'pushes' the stone in the direction indicated by d.

Given this clarification, let's rethink our pushing strategy.

From the initial state:
- player1 is at pos12
- stone1 is at pos24
- pos35 is the goal location
- pos14 must always remain clear

The constraint is that pos14 must always be clear. This means that at no point should player1 or stone1 be at pos14.

To get stone1 to pos35, we need to find a path that avoids pos14.

Let's try the strategy where we push stone1 from pos24 to pos23, then from pos23 to pos33, and finally from pos33 to pos35. For each step, we need to make sure that neither player1 nor stone1 ever touch pos14.

1. Move player1 from pos12 to pos13 (down)
2. Move player1 from pos13 to pos23 (right)
3. Move player1 from pos23 to pos33 (right)
4. Move player1 from pos33 to pos34 (down)
5. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos23 (using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos23 dirleft")
   - In this push, player1 is at pos34, stone1 is at pos24, and we want to push stone1 to pos23
   - The direction is dirleft: from pos34, go left to get to pos24, and from pos24, go left to get to pos23
   - After pushing, stone1 is at pos23 and player1 is at pos24
6. Move player1 from pos24 to pos14 (up)
   - No, this violates the constraint
   - Let's think...

Ok, so I can't use pos14 during our entire plan. So far, we have stone1 at pos23 and player1 at pos24, and we're trying to get player1 to a position where it can push stone1 from pos23 to pos33.

From player1's current position at pos24, let's find a valid path to a position where it can push stone1 from pos23 to pos33. The target position is pos13.

7. Move player1 from pos24 to pos25 (down)
8. Move player1 from pos25 to pos35 (right)
9. Move player1 from pos35 to pos34 (up)
10. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33 (up)
11. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32 (up)
12. Move player1 from pos32 to pos31 (up)
13. Move player1 from pos31 to pos21 (left)
14. Move player1 from pos21 to pos11 (left)
15. Move player1 from pos11 to pos12 (down)
16. Move player1 from pos12 to pos13 (down)
17. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos33 (using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirright")
    - In this push, player1 is at pos13, stone1 is at pos23, and we want to push stone1 to pos33
    - The direction is dirright: from pos13, go right to get to pos23, and from pos23, go right to get to pos33
    - After pushing, stone1 is at pos33 and player1 is at pos23
18. Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 (left)
19. Move player1 from pos13 to pos12 (up)
20. Move player1 from pos12 to pos11 (up)
21. Move player1 from pos11 to pos21 (right)
22. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (right)
23. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos35 (using action "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos33 pos35 dirdown")
    - In this push, player1 is at pos31, stone1 is at pos33, and we want to push stone1 to pos35
    - The direction is dirdown: from pos31, go down to get to pos33, and from pos33, go down to get to pos35
    - After pushing, stone1 is at pos35 (the goal) and player1 is at pos33

Phew, that seems like a valid plan! Let's summarize the broad steps:
1. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos23
2. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos33
3. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos35

Let me check if there's a more efficient solution:

An alternative approach is to push stone1 directly from pos24 to pos34, and then from pos34 to pos35. But to push stone1 from pos24 to pos34, player1 would need to be at pos14, which violates the constraint. So that option is out.

Is there another approach we haven't considered? Let's think...

Can we push stone1 from pos24 to pos25, and then from pos25 to pos35? To push stone1 from pos24 to pos25, player1 would need to be at pos23. After pushing, stone1 would be at pos25 and player1 would be at pos24. To push stone1 from pos25 to pos35, player1 would need to be at pos15. This is quite annoying though because to get to pos15 from pos24, player1 would need to either go through pos14 (which violates the constraint) or take a very long route around the grid.

But let me try to be exhaustive in my analysis. What are all the possible pushing options for stone1 from its initial position at pos24? (avoiding paths through pos14)

1. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos23 (left) with player1 at pos25
2. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos25 (down) with player1 at pos23
3. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos34 (right) with player1 at pos14 (but this violates the constraint)

Let me check the number of steps for options 1 and 2:

Option 1: Push stone1 from pos24 to pos23, then to pos33, then to pos35:
23 steps

Option 2: Push stone1 from pos24 to pos25, then to pos35:
1. Move player1 from pos12 to pos13 (down)
2. Move player1 from pos13 to pos23 (right)
3. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos25 (using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown")
4. Now stone1 is at pos25 and player1 is at pos24
5. To push stone1 from pos25 to pos35, player1 needs to be at pos15
6. To get to pos15 from pos24 (without using pos14), player1 can go:
   a. Down to pos25 (but stone1 is there)
   b. Up to pos23
   c. Left to pos14 (but this violates the constraint)
   d. Right to pos34
So, let's have player1 go up to pos23.
6. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23 (up)
7. From pos23, player1 can go:
   a. Up to pos22
   b. Down to pos24 (where we just came from)
   c. Left to pos13
   d. Right to pos33
Let's have player1 go up to pos22.
7. Move player1 from pos23 to pos22 (up)
8. From pos22, player1 can go:
   a. Up to pos21
   b. Down to pos23 (where we just came from)
   c. Left to pos12
   d. Right to pos32
Let's have player1 go up to pos21.
8. Move player1 from pos22 to pos21 (up)
9. From pos21, player1 can go:
   a. Up to non-existent position
   b. Down to pos22 (where we just came from)
   c. Left to pos11
   d. Right to pos31
Let's have player1 go left to pos11.
9. Move player1 from pos21 to pos11 (left)
10. From pos11, player1 can go:
    a. Up to non-existent position
    b. Down to pos12
    c. Left to non-existent position
    d. Right to pos21 (where we just came from)
Let's have player1 go down to pos12.
10. Move player1 from pos11 to pos12 (down)
11. From pos12, player1 can go:
    a. Up to pos11 (where we just came from)
    b. Down to pos13
    c. Left to non-existent position
    d. Right to pos22
Let's have player1 go down to pos13.
11. Move player1 from pos12 to pos13 (down)
12. From pos13, player1 can go:
    a. Up to pos12 (where we just came from)
    b. Down to pos14 (but this violates the constraint)
    c. Left to non-existent position
    d. Right to pos23

Hmm, I can't get player1 to pos15 without going through pos14, which violates the constraint. So option 2 doesn't seem viable.

Actually, let's see:
- After step 3, stone1 is at pos25 and player1 is at pos24
- One can get from pos24 to pos15 (without using pos14) by going around the grid:
  - Down to pos34, pos44, pos54
  - Up to pos53, pos52, pos51
  - Left to pos41, pos31, pos21, pos11
  - Down to pos12, pos13
  - Now, the goal is pos15, but from pos13, one can't get to pos15 directly without going through pos14, which violates the constraint.

Although this might be feasible in an unrestricted grid, the constraint that pos14 must always remain clear makes it impossible to push stone1 from pos25 to pos35 without violating the constraint.

Going back to Option 1: Push stone1 from pos24 to pos23, then to pos33, then to pos35:
1. Move player1 from pos12 to pos13 (down)
2. Move player1 from pos13 to pos23 (right)
3. Move player1 from pos23 to pos33 (right)
4. Move player1 from pos33 to pos34 (down)
5. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos23 (using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos23 dirleft")
6. Now stone1 is at pos23 and player1 is at pos24

To push stone1 from pos23 to pos33, player1 needs to be at pos13.
7. Move player1 from pos24 to pos25 (down)
8. Move player1 from pos25 to pos35 (right)
9. Move player1 from pos35 to pos34 (up)
10. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33 (up)
11. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32 (up)
12. Move player1 from pos32 to pos31 (up)
13. Move player1 from pos31 to pos21 (left)
14. Move player1 from pos21 to pos11 (left)
15. Move player1 from pos11 to pos12 (down)
16. Move player1 from pos12 to pos13 (down)
17. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos33 (using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirright")
18. Now stone1 is at pos33 and player1 is at pos23

To push stone1 from pos33 to pos35, player1 needs to be at pos31.
19. Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 (left)
20. Move player1 from pos13 to pos12 (up)
21. Move player1 from pos12 to pos11 (up)
22. Move player1 from pos11 to pos21 (right)
23. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (right)
24. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos35 (using action "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos33 pos35 dirdown")
25. Now stone1 is at pos35 (the goal) and player1 is at pos33

So, the efficient plan I'm finding is to push stone1 from pos24 to pos23, then from pos23 to pos33, and finally from pos33 to the goal at pos35. This plan avoids pos14, respecting the constraint.

Let me examine if I can optimize this plan further:

In steps 7-16, I'm maneuvering player1 from pos24 to pos13. Is there a shorter path?

From pos24, one could go:
- Up to pos23
- Left to pos14 (but this violates the constraint)
- Right to pos34
- Down to pos25

Actually, instead of going down to pos25 in step 7, I could go right to pos34. To check if this is a shorter path:
7. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 (right)
8. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33 (up)
9. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (left)
10. Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 (left)

That's a lot shorter than the path I initially proposed! So my updated plan:

1. Move player1 from pos12 to pos13 (down)
2. Move player1 from pos13 to pos23 (right)
3. Move player1 from pos23 to pos33 (right)
4. Move player1 from pos33 to pos34 (down)
5. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos23 (using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos23 dirleft")
6. Now stone1 is at pos23 and player1 is at pos24
7. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 (right)
8. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33 (up)
9. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (left)
10. Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 (left)
11. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos33 (using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirright")
12. Now stone1 is at pos33 and player1 is at pos23
13. Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 (left)
14. Move player1 from pos13 to pos12 (up)
15. Move player1 from pos12 to pos11 (up)
16. Move player1 from pos11 to pos21 (right)
17. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (right)
18. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos35 (using action "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos33 pos35 dirdown")
19. Now stone1 is at pos35 (the goal) and player1 is at pos33

Actually I want to double check this solution. In step 10, I moved player to pos13. Now stone1 is at pos23. Is player1 able to push stone1 from pos23 to pos33 with the "pushtonongoal" action? Let's check the action definition:

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.

The preconditions include:
- agent p is at location l_p
- stone s is at location l_from
- location l_to is clear
- you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d
- you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d
- location l_to is not a goal location

In our case:
- player1 is at pos13
- stone1 is at pos23
- pos33 is the destination

Is pos33 a goal location? According to the initial state description, pos35 is labeled as a goal location, but there's no mention of pos33 as a goal. So, pos33 is not a goal location, and we can use the "pushtonongoal" action.

Can player1 get from pos13 to pos23 following a direction? Yes, it can go "dirright".

Can stone1 get from pos23 to pos33 following the same direction? Yes, it can also go "dirright".

So, the action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirright" is valid.

Similarly, for step 18, we need to check if the action "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos33 pos35 dirdown" is valid:

- player1 is at pos31
- stone1 is at pos33
- pos35 is the destination

Is pos35 a goal location? Yes, according to the initial state description.

Can player1 get from pos31 to pos33 following a direction? Yes, it can go "dirdown".

Can stone1 get from pos33 to pos35 following the same direction? Yes, it can also go "dirdown".

So, the action "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos33 pos35 dirdown" is valid.

Let's give our plan once more, this time exactly in the format of the actions:

1. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
2. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright
3. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
4. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos23 dirleft
6. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
7. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
8. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
9. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirright
11. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
12. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
13. move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup
14. move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright
15. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
16. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos33 pos35 dirdown
