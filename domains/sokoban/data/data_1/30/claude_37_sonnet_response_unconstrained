Let's understand the problem first. We have a 5x5 grid, with positions denoted as pos11, pos12, ..., pos55. The agent (player1) is initially at position pos54. There's a stone (stone1) at position pos22. We need to move the stone to a goal location, which is pos42.

To do this, the agent needs to navigate to a position adjacent to the stone and then push it toward the goal location. Let's outline the possible moves:

1. The agent first needs to move from pos54 to a position adjacent to pos22. Since we know from the preconditions that the agent can only move to clear locations, we need to plan a path.

2. Once the agent is adjacent to the stone, it can push the stone toward the goal location. The push action requires the stone to be pushed in a specific direction (dirleft, dirright, dirup, or dirdown).

Let's analyze the initial state to understand the grid layout:

```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

The agent is at pos54, and the stone is at pos22. The goal is pos42.

First, let's plan a path for the agent to move from pos54 to a position adjacent to pos22. The adjacent positions to pos22 would be pos21, pos23, pos12, and pos32.

According to the actions, we can move in any cardinal direction. Let's plan the agent's movement from pos54 to pos32, which is directly below pos22.

Path from pos54 to pos32:
1. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft
2. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
3. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
4. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup

Now, the agent is at pos32 and the stone is at pos22. To push the stone to the goal location pos42, the agent needs to push the stone to the right.

5. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos42 dirright

Let's double-check the preconditions for this action:
(i) agent p is at location l_p: The agent player1 is at location pos32. ✓
(ii) stone s is at location l_from: The stone stone1 is at location pos22. ✓
(iii) location l_to is clear: The location pos42 is clear (from initial state). ✓
(iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d: From pos32 to pos22 following direction dirup. ✓
(v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d: From pos22 to pos42 following direction dirright. ✓
(vi) location l_to is a goal location: Location pos42 is a goal location. ✓

So, the action "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos42 dirright" satisfies all the preconditions.

After executing this action, the stone stone1 will be at the goal location pos42, which satisfies the goal condition "stone1 is at a goal location."

Let's review the complete plan:
1. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft
2. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
3. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
4. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
5. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos42 dirright

Oh wait, I made a mistake. Let me double check the grid layout one more time and make sure I understand the directions correctly.

I think I made a mistake in my understanding of the grid layout. Let me clarify:

```
(1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5)
(2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5)
(3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5)
(4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5)
(5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5)
```

So pos11 would be the top-left corner, and pos55 would be the bottom-right corner.

Now, I need to reinterpret the directions. From the state description, I can infer:
- dirright: Increase the row by 1.
- dirleft: Decrease the row by 1.
- dirdown: Increase the column by 1.
- dirup: Decrease the column by 1.

Wait, let me re-examine the state description to be sure. 

From "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright", I infer that dirright increases the first index.
From "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown", I infer that dirdown increases the second index.

So the directions are:
- dirright: Move from (i,j) to (i+1,j).
- dirleft: Move from (i,j) to (i-1,j).
- dirdown: Move from (i,j) to (i,j+1).
- dirup: Move from (i,j) to (i,j-1).

With this understanding, let me replan. 

In the grid layout, the agent (player1) is at position pos54, which is the fourth column of the bottom row. The stone (stone1) is at position pos22, which is the second column of the second row. The goal location is pos42, which is the second column of the fourth row.

To push the stone from pos22 to pos42, I need the agent to be on the side opposite to the push direction. Since I want to push the stone down, the agent should be above the stone, at pos21.

Path from pos54 to pos21:
1. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
2. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft
3. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
4. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
5. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
6. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup

Now, the agent is at pos21, and the stone is at pos22. The agent can push the stone down to pos32. Actually I made a minor mistake, we want to get it to pos42, so we want to push it in the dirright direction.

Let me re-think this. The stone is at pos22 and the goal is at pos42. Using my grid layout, I understand that pos22 is at row 2, column 2, and pos42 is at row 4, column 2. So, to move the stone from pos22 to pos42, I need to move it two steps to the right (increasing the first index). Hence, the direction I need to push is dirright.

To push the stone in the dirright direction, the agent needs to be on the left side of the stone, which would be at pos12. But I realized we can't go from pos22 to pos12, because that would be in the dirleft direction, not dirup as I initially thought.

Let me redo the path planning:

The agent is at pos54 and the stone is at pos22. The adjacent positions to pos22 are:
- pos12 (above the stone, dirup from pos22)
- pos32 (below the stone, dirdown from pos22)
- pos21 (to the left of the stone, dirleft from pos22)
- pos23 (to the right of the stone, dirright from pos22)

I want to move the stone from pos22 to pos42, which is two steps to the right. So the agent should be at pos12 (above the stone), and then push the stone in the dirright direction.

Actually, I think I'm confused because of my notation. Let me use (i, j) to denote the positions where i is the row and j is the column:

```
(1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5)
(2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5)
(3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5)
(4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5)
(5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5)
```

The agent is at (5, 4) and the stone is at (2, 2). The goal is at (4, 2). This means the stone needs to move two steps down from (2, 2) to (4, 2).

Given the directions:
- dirright: Move from (i,j) to (i+1,j).
- dirleft: Move from (i,j) to (i-1,j).
- dirdown: Move from (i,j) to (i,j+1).
- dirup: Move from (i,j) to (i,j-1).

Okay so to push the stone down, I need the agent to be above the stone, at (1, 2), and then push the stone in the dirdown direction to (3, 2), and then push it again in the dirdown direction to (4, 2).

But there's a problem. I checked the directions based on the state descriptions, and I think my directions are correct. Going from (i,j) to (i+1,j) is dirright, going from (i,j) to (i,j+1) is dirdown, and so on.

Given the directions, to push the stone from (2, 2) to (4, 2), I need to increase the first index by 2. This corresponds to pushing the stone in the dirright direction twice. To push the stone in the dirright direction, the agent needs to be on the left side of the stone, at (1, 2).

No wait, I misread the position. The notation is actually posij, where i and j are the indices. But I just got the directions wrong. The stone is at pos22, which is at the second row and second column. The goal is at pos42, which is at the fourth row and second column. We need to move it down down two rows.

Let me re-determine the directions:
- dirright: Move from (i,j) to (i+1,j).
- dirleft: Move from (i,j) to (i-1,j).
- dirdown: Move from (i,j) to (i,j+1).
- dirup: Move from (i,j) to (i,j-1).

To verify: "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" means going from (1, 1) to (2, 1), which is an increase in the first index, consistent with dirright. And "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown" means going from (1, 1) to (1, 2), which is an increase in the second index, consistent with dirdown. So I had the directions right.

To push the stone from pos22 to pos42, I need to push it in the dirright direction twice. To do this, the agent needs to be on the left side of the stone, at pos12. But that is dirleft as we're decreasing the first index. But this contradicts what I verified earlier.

Let me check the connected move "You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft", (2, 2) to (1, 2). This is decreasing the first index, so it's consistent with dirleft.

Let me now redo the grid layout:

```
pos11 pos21 pos31 pos41 pos51
pos12 pos22 pos32 pos42 pos52
pos13 pos23 pos33 pos43 pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

Now I understand that posij refers to the position at the ith column and jth row. The agent is at pos54, which is the 5th column and 4th row. The stone is at pos22, which is the 2nd column and 2nd row. The goal is at pos42, which is the 4th column and 2nd row. This means the stone needs to move two steps to the right, from column 2 to column 4.

And the directions:
- dirright: Move from (i,j) to (i+1,j), i.e., increase the column.
- dirleft: Move from (i,j) to (i-1,j), i.e., decrease the column.
- dirdown: Move from (i,j) to (i,j+1), i.e., increase the row.
- dirup: Move from (i,j) to (i,j-1), i.e., decrease the row.

Now, to push the stone from pos22 to pos42, I need to push it in the dirright direction, which will move it from column 2 to column 4. To push the stone in the dirright direction, the agent needs to be on the left side of the stone, at pos12.

Wait, I meant to say the stone needs to go from pos22 to pos42. Looking at the layout, this would be from (2, 2) to (4, 2), which means increasing the column by 2, or moving right by 2. To do this, the agent needs to be on the left side of the stone at (1, 2) or pos12.

I think my confusion is stemming from the notation. The problem states that stone is at "pos22" and the goal is "pos42". But I think I've been flipping the indices. 

If posij refers to the ith row and jth column, then:

```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

The agent is at pos54, which is the 5th row and 4th column. The stone is at pos22, which is the 2nd row and 2nd column. The goal is at pos42, which is the 4th row and 2nd column. This means the stone needs to move two steps down, from row 2 to row 4.

Let me verify with the state description: "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" means going from (1, 1) to (2, 1), which is moving from row 1 to row 2 (down), not column 1 to column 2 (right). This contradicts my understanding of dirright.

I've been very confused by the notation, but I think this is correct:

```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

Where posij refers to the position at the ith row and jth column.

And the directions:
- dirright: Move from (i,j) to (i,j+1), i.e., increase the column.
- dirleft: Move from (i,j) to (i,j-1), i.e., decrease the column.
- dirdown: Move from (i,j) to (i+1,j), i.e., increase the row.
- dirup: Move from (i,j) to (i-1,j), i.e., decrease the row.

Let's verify: "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirdown" means going from (1, 1) to (2, 1), which is increasing the row. But the state says "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright", which doesn't match my understanding. Let me double check the state descriptions.

Okay, I think I understand the issue. The problem statement might be non-standard in its direction naming. 

From the state descriptions:
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

If I'm in pos11 (which is the top-left corner), moving to pos21 means moving one step to the right, which corresponds to an increase in the first index. Similarly, moving to pos12 means moving one step down, which corresponds to an increase in the second index.

So, the actual layout is:

```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

Where posij refers to the position at the ith row and jth column. This means the first index indicates the row (vertical) and the second index indicates the column (horizontal).

The directions are:
- dirright: Move from (i,j) to (i+1,j), i.e., increase the row.
- dirleft: Move from (i,j) to (i-1,j), i.e., decrease the row.
- dirdown: Move from (i,j) to (i,j+1), i.e., increase the column.
- dirup: Move from (i,j) to (i,j-1), i.e., decrease the column.

This seems counter-intuitive (usually "right" means increasing the column, not the row), but let's go with this interpretation given the state descriptions. Wait this is wrong too; let me check again the state descriptions.

Okay, I'm going to reset. I was getting too confused. Let's imagine the grid as a standard 2D grid where posij refers to the position at the ith row and jth column.

And let me reconstruct the directions from the provided state descriptions:
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

In a standard grid:
- pos11 is at the top-left corner.
- pos21 would be one row down from pos11.
- pos12 would be one column to the right from pos11.

So, according to the state descriptions:
- dirright moves from (1,1) to (2,1), which is moving down.
- dirdown moves from (1,1) to (1,2), which is moving right.

Wait, this doesn't match the standard understanding of "right" and "down". Let me reconsider.

Oh, I see the issue. In the problem context, the directions refer to the change in indices, not the standard directions on a grid. So:
- dirright: Increase the first index (row).
- dirleft: Decrease the first index (row).
- dirdown: Increase the second index (column).
- dirup: Decrease the second index (column).

Given this understanding, let's reinterpret the problem.

The agent is at pos54, which is the 5th row and 4th column. The stone is at pos22, which is the 2nd row and 2nd column. The goal is at pos42, which is the 4th row and 2nd column. This means the stone needs to move two steps dirright, from row 2 to row 4.

Since the goal is to move the stone from pos22 to pos42, it means pushing the stone in the dirright direction. But in the problem context, dirright does not actually mean going to the right; it means increasing the row index. This is more like going down!

Ok, now I think I can finally solve the problem correctly.

The agent is at pos54. We need to move the stone from pos22 to pos42. To push the stone in the dirright direction (which means increasing the row), the agent needs to be above the stone, at pos12. But in order to get there, it should first get to an adjacent position of the stone.

Wait, I realize that I was able to push the stone from pos12. There's a special constraint in the actions:
- For "pushtogoal" and "pushtonongoal", the agent must be at a location adjacent to the stone in the direction opposite to the push. To push the stone in the dirright direction, the agent must be at a location dirleft from the stone.

So, to push the stone from pos22 to pos32 (one step toward the goal) in the dirright direction, the agent must be at pos12 (one step dirleft from the stone). But to push the stone in the dirright direction, we need to be able to move from the agent's position to the stone's position in the direction dirright, which is not possible from pos12 to pos22 (going from pos12 to pos22 would be dirright, not dirleft). This is a bit confusing. Let me think about it more.

I'm getting confused by the directions again. Let me verify once more with the state descriptions.

"You may move from location pos12 to location pos22 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos11 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos13 following direction dirdown"

In a 2D grid with posij referring to the position at the ith row and jth column:
- dirright moves from pos12 to pos22, which means moving from row 1 to row 2 (increasing row) while keeping the column fixed at 2.
- dirup moves from pos12 to pos11, which means moving from column 2 to column 1 (decreasing column) while keeping the row fixed at 1.
- dirdown moves from pos12 to pos13, which means moving from column 2 to column 3 (increasing column) while keeping the row fixed at 1.

So, the directions are:
- dirright: Move from (i,j) to (i+1,j), i.e., increase the row.
- dirleft: Move from (i,j) to (i-1,j), i.e., decrease the row.
- dirdown: Move from (i,j) to (i,j+1), i.e., increase the column.
- dirup: Move from (i,j) to (i,j-1), i.e., decrease the column.

This interpretation is consistent with the state descriptions. Now, let's plan the solution.

The agent is at pos54, which is the 5th row and 4th column. The stone is at pos22, which is the 2nd row and 2nd column. The goal is at pos42, which is the 4th row and 2nd column. This means the stone needs to move two steps down or dirright, from row 2 to row 4.

For "pushtogoal", the precondition (iv) states: "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d". So, if the agent is at location l_p and wants to push the stone from location l_from to location l_to in direction d, then the agent must be able to move from l_p to l_from in direction d. This means the agent should be on the opposite side of the stone from the intended push direction.

Since we want to push the stone in the dirright direction, the agent should be able to move to the stone in the dirright direction. This means the agent should be at pos12, one row above (dirleft) the stone. But to get to that position, the agent needs to navigate from pos54.

Path from pos54 to pos12:
1. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup (Move left)
2. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft (Move up)
3. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft (Move up)
4. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft (Move up)
5. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft (Move up)
6. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup (Move left)

Now, the agent is at pos12, which is dirleft from the stone. The agent can push the stone in the dirright direction to pos32.

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos32 dirright

After pushing, the stone is at pos32, and the agent is at pos22. We want to push the stone again in the dirright direction to get it to pos42, but the agent is at pos22 which is dirleft from the stone now. So we don't need to move the agent.

8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright

After this action, the stone stone1 will be at the goal location pos42, which satisfies the goal condition "stone1 is at a goal location."

Let's review the complete plan:
1. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
2. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft
3. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
4. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
5. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
6. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos32 dirright
8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright

Oh, I made a mistake again. I got confused with the directions. Let's reset once more.

From the state descriptions:
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

This means:
- dirright moves from pos11 to pos21, which is moving from (1,1) to (2,1) or increasing the first coordinate.
- dirdown moves from pos11 to pos12, which is moving from (1,1) to (1,2) or increasing the second coordinate.

The directions are:
- dirright: Move from (i,j) to (i+1,j), i.e., increase the first coordinate (moving right).
- dirleft: Move from (i,j) to (i-1,j), i.e., decrease the first coordinate (moving left).
- dirdown: Move from (i,j) to (i,j+1), i.e., increase the second coordinate (moving down).
- dirup: Move from (i,j) to (i,j-1), i.e., decrease the second coordinate (moving up).

With this understanding:
- The agent is at pos54, which is at coordinates (5,4) or the 5th column and 4th row.
- The stone is at pos22, which is at coordinates (2,2) or the 2nd column and 2nd row.
- The goal is at pos42, which is at coordinates (4,2) or the 4th column and 2nd row.

To push the stone from pos22 to pos42, we need to move it in the dirright direction, which means increasing the first coordinate from 2 to 4. According to the preconditions of the pushtogoal action, the agent must be at a position from where it can move to the stone in the direction of the intended push. So, the agent should be at pos12 before pushing the stone in the dirright direction.

But wait, there's a mistake in my reasoning. The precondition (iv) for "pushtogoal" and "pushtonongoal" states: "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d", where l_p is the agent's location, l_from is the stone's location, and d is the direction of the push. If the agent is at l_p and the stone is at l_from, and we want to push the stone in direction d, then the agent must be able to move from l_p to l_from in direction d.

So, for a dirright push from pos22 to pos32, the agent must be at a position l_p such that direction dirright takes it to pos22. According to our direction understanding, this would be pos12.

But actually, I realize there's another constraint: the stone must be pushed to a position along the same row or column as the agent. If the stone is at pos22 and we want to push it dirright to pos32, the agent must be able to align with this push. So actually, I would need to be at position pos12. Okay so I think my original analysis actually aligns.

Let's get this straight. The stone is at pos22 (coordinates (2,2)), and the goal is at pos42 (coordinates (4,2)). To move the stone from pos22 to pos42, we need to push it dirright (increaseing the first coordinate).

According to the pushtogoal action, the agent player1 must be at a location l_p such that "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d". If we want to push the stone in the dirright direction, the agent must be at a position from where it can move dirright to reach the stone. 

Okay, so the agent  needs to be at pos12 (coordinates (1,2)) in order to push the stone at pos22 (coordinates (2,2)) in the dirright direction. The reason is that, from pos12, the agent can move dirright to reach pos22, and then push the stone dirright to pos32 (coordinates (3,2)).

I've been overthinking and confusing myself. Let's just replan the solution:

Path from pos54 to pos12:
1. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft 
2. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
3. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
4. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft
5. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
6. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup

Actually I realized that to reach a position dirleft (1 position left) from the stone, we need to move dirleft (horizontally) from the position "above", not position "right". But I think I keep confusing myself. Let's be systematic. 

From the state descriptions:
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

If we visualize the grid:
```
(1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5)
(2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5)
(3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5)
(4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5)
(5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5)
```

Then:
- dirright moves from (1,1) to (2,1), which is moving one position down from the top left.
- dirdown moves from (1,1) to (1,2), which is moving one position right from the top left.

But standard grid conventions have row increasing from top to bottom and column increasing from left to right. So, the actual directions are:
- dirright: Move from (i,j) to (i+1,j), i.e., increase the row (moving down).
- dirleft: Move from (i,j) to (i-1,j), i.e., decrease the row (moving up).
- dirdown: Move from (i,j) to (i,j+1), i.e., increase the column (moving right).
- dirup: Move from (i,j) to (i,j-1), i.e., decrease the column (moving left).

Note that posij refers to position (i, j) in this grid.

Then:
- The agent is at pos54, which is position (5,4).
- The stone is at pos22, which is position (2,2).
- The goal is at pos42, which is position (4,2).

To push the stone from pos22 to pos42, we need to move it in the dirright direction, which means increasing the first coordinate from 2 to 4. But the pushtogoal action requires the agent to be at a location l_p such that "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d". If d is dirright, the agent should be at a location from where dirright takes it to the stone.

From the direction interpretations, dirright moves from (i,j) to (i+1,j). So, to move dirright to reach the stone at pos22, the agent should be at position (1,2) or pos12.

Once the agent is at pos12, it can push the stone from pos22 to pos32 (one step toward the goal) in the dirright direction. But then, the agent will be at pos22 and the stone will be at pos32. To push the stone again in the dirright direction to reach the goal at pos42, the agent needs to be at a location from where dirright takes it to the stone. 

So, the agent again needs to be at pos22, which it already is after the first push.

Okay, with this clearer direction understanding, let me replan:

Path from pos54 to pos12:
1. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup (Move left)
2. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup (Move left)
3. move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup (Move left)
4. move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft (Move up)
5. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft (Move up)
6. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft (Move up)
7. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft (Move up)
8. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown (Move right)

Now, the agent is at pos12, one position dirleft from the stone. The agent can push the stone in the dirright direction to pos32.

9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos32 dirright

After pushing, the stone is at pos32, and the agent is at pos22. We want to push the stone again in the dirright direction to get it to pos42, but need to check if the agent is in the correct position to push. Currently, the agent is at pos22 and the stone is at pos32. To push the stone from pos32 to pos42 in the dirright direction, the agent needs to be able to move from its current position to the stone's position in the dirright direction. Since dirright is moving from (i,j) to (i+1,j), the agent at pos22 can move dirright to reach pos32. So, the agent is in the correct position to push again.

10. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright

After this action, the stone stone1 will be at the goal location pos42, which satisfies the goal condition "stone1 is at a goal location."

Actually, I've been looking back at the state descriptions again. It says "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright", which means increasing the first index. It also says "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown", which means increasing the second index. I'm getting confused because in standard grid conventions, increasing the first index (row) corresponds to moving down, not right. But I guess the problem is labeling the directions counter-intuitively.

If I look at all directions:
- dirright: Move from (i,j) to (i+1,j), i.e., increase the first index (moving right in the problem's labeling).
- dirleft: Move from (i,j) to (i-1,j), i.e., decrease the first index (moving left in the problem's labeling).
- dirdown: Move from (i,j) to (i,j+1), i.e., increase the second index (moving down in the problem's labeling).
- dirup: Move from (i,j) to (i,j-1), i.e., decrease the second index (moving up in the problem's labeling).

Now, if I visualize the grid:
```
(1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1)
(1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2) (5,2)
(1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3)
(1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) (5,4)
(1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) (5,5)
```

Then:
- The agent is at pos54, which is position (5,4).
- The stone is at pos22, which is position (2,2).
- The goal is at pos42, which is position (4,2).

To push the stone from pos22 to pos42, we need to move it in the dirright direction, which is increasing the first index from 2 to 4. For this, the agent needs to be at a position l_p such that "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d". If d is dirright, the agent should be at a location from where dirright (increasing the first index) takes it to the stone. That's dirleft from the stone or pos12.

I think I was confusing myself by trying to visualize the grid in a standard way, but the directions in the problem have their own labeling. I'll stick with the direction interpretations based on the state descriptions.

Okay I think I've finally got it straight. I'll re-plan again, and no mistakes this time:

Path from pos54 to pos12:
1. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft (Move left; decreasing the first index)
2. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft (Move left; decreasing the first index)
3. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft (Move left; decreasing the first index)
4. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft (Move left; decreasing the first index)
5. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup (Move up; decreasing the second index)
6. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup (Move up; decreasing the second index)

Now, the agent is at pos12, and the stone is at pos22. The agent is dirleft of the stone. To verify: the agent's position is (1,2), and the stone's position is (2,2). If the agent moves dirright from (1,2), it will reach (2,2), which is the stone's position. So, the agent is in the correct position to push the stone in the dirright direction.

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos32 dirright (Push the stone dirright; increasing the first index)

After this action, the stone is at pos32, and the agent is at pos22. The agent is dirleft of the stone. To verify: the agent's position is (2,2), and the stone's position is (3,2). If the agent moves dirright from (2,2), it will reach (3,2), which is the stone's position. So, the agent is in the correct position to push the stone again in the dirright direction.

8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright (Push the stone dirright; increasing the first index)

After this action, the stone stone1 will be at the goal location pos42, which satisfies the goal condition "stone1 is at a goal location."

That's it for the solution.

I keep making a mistake here. Let me check the actual precondition for the actions one more time to be precise.

But looking at the preconditions for "pushtogoal":
(i) agent p is at location l_p
(ii) stone s is at location l_from
(iii) location l_to is clear
(iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d
(v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d
(vi) location l_to is a goal location

For "pushtonongoal", it's the same except for the last condition:
(vi) location l_to is not a goal location

The key here is condition (iv): "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d". If the agent is at pos12 and the stone is at pos22, and d is dirright, the agent can indeed move from pos12 to pos22 following direction dirright.

Similarly, for condition (v): "you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d". If the stone is at pos22 and the target is pos32, and d is dirright, the stone can indeed move from pos22 to pos32 following direction dirright.

So, the logic I described earlier seems correct.

But from condition (iv) what this means is that we when we do the action "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos32 dirright", we are assuming that the agent can move from its position (pos12) to the stone's position (pos22) in the direction dirright.

Actually, it's more nuanced. The precondition is: "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d". This doesn't necessarily mean that the agent can move from l_p to l_from following direction d. It's checking if there's a connection between the two locations in the given direction.

From the state descriptions:
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos22 following direction dirright"

This indicates that it is possible to move from pos12 to pos22 following direction dirright. So, the precondition (iv) is satisfied.

After pushing the stone from pos22 to pos32, the agent is at pos22 and the stone is at pos32. To push the stone again, we check if the agent can get from pos22 to pos32 following direction dirright.

From the state descriptions:
"You may move from location pos22 to location pos32 following direction dirright"

This indicates that it is possible to move from pos22 to pos32 following direction dirright. So, the precondition (iv) is satisfied for the second push as well.

Now I think I've finally got the solution straight:

Path from pos54 to pos12:
1. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft (Move left; decreasing the first index)
2. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft (Move left; decreasing the first index)
3. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft (Move left; decreasing the first index)
4. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft (Move left; decreasing the first index)
5. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup (Move up; decreasing the second index)
6. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup (Move up; decreasing the second index)

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos32 dirright (Push the stone dirright; increasing the first index)

8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright (Push the stone dirright; increasing the first index)

Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me check where the goal is one more time.

From the initial state: "pos42 is a goal location". So the goal is at pos42, at position (4,2).

Hmm, let me double check whether we're actually pushing the stone from pos32 to a goal location. 

From the initial state: "pos42 is a goal location". So we're pushing the stone to pos42, which is a goal location, which matches up with the "pushtogoal" action.

So the final plan is actually correct.

Actually, I think I need to check one last time. Let me go through the plan step by step to ensure all preconditions are satisfied.

Initial state:
- player1 is at position pos54.
- stone1 is at position pos22.
- pos42 is a goal location.

1. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft
   - player1 is at position pos54.
   - position pos44 is clear.
   - You may move from pos54 to pos44 following direction dirleft.
   After action: player1 is at position pos44.

2. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
   - player1 is at position pos44.
   - position pos34 is clear.
   - You may move from pos44 to pos34 following direction dirleft.
   After action: player1 is at position pos34.

3. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
   - player1 is at position pos34.
   - position pos24 is clear.
   - You may move from pos34 to pos24 following direction dirleft.
   After action: player1 is at position pos24.

4. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft
   - player1 is at position pos24.
   - position pos14 is clear.
   - You may move from pos24 to pos14 following direction dirleft.
   After action: player1 is at position pos14.

5. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
   - player1 is at position pos14.
   - position pos13 is clear.
   - You may move from pos14 to pos13 following direction dirup.
   After action: player1 is at position pos13.

6. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
   - player1 is at position pos13.
   - position pos12 is clear.
   - You may move from pos13 to pos12 following direction dirup.
   After action: player1 is at position pos12.

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos32 dirright
   - player1 is at position pos12.
   - stone1 is at position pos22.
   - position pos32 is clear.
   - You may move from pos12 to pos22 following direction dirright.
   - You may move from pos22 to pos32 following direction dirright.
   - position pos32 is not a goal location.
   After action: player1 is at position pos22, stone1 is at position pos32.

8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright
   - player1 is at position pos22.
   - stone1 is at position pos32.
   - position pos42 is clear.
   - You may move from pos22 to pos32 following direction dirright.
   - You may move from pos32 to pos42 following direction dirright.
   - position pos42 is a goal location.
   After action: player1 is at position pos32, stone1 is at position pos42.

I'm pretty sure I made a mistake in precondition checking with my current understanding because I've been confusing myself over and over. I want to make sure I'm 100% confident.

Let me reconsider the preconditions once again. 

Wait, I don't think I've been wrong. The precondition for "pushtonongoal" and "pushtogoal" require that the agent can get from its current position (l_p) to the stone's position (l_from) in the push direction (d), meaning the agent should be on the opposite side (direction) of where the stone will move.

(iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d.

This is confusingly phrased. I think this means that if the player is at l_p, the agent should be able to reach l_from by moving in direction d. So if we're pushing a stone dirright, the agent should be dirleft of the stone. This aligns with the physical intuition of pushing.

Okay, so for pushing the stone from pos22 to pos32 in the dirright direction, the agent should be at pos12, because the agent can get from pos12 to pos22 following direction dirright.

Similarly, after the first push, the stone is at pos32 and the agent is at pos22. To push the stone again from pos32 to pos42 in the dirright direction, the agent should be able to get from pos22 to pos32 following direction dirright. This is possible, because the agent can indeed move from pos22 to pos32 in the dirright direction.

So, our plan is correct. Let me review it one more time for completeness:

1. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft 
2. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft 
3. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft 
4. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft 
5. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup 
6. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup 
7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos32 dirright 
8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright 

Initially:
- player1 is at position pos54.
- stone1 is at position pos22.
- pos42 is a goal location.

After all actions:
- player1 is at position pos32.
- stone1 is at position pos42, which is a goal location.

Since the stone is at a goal location, the task is achieved. This plan is a valid solution.

For the sake of optimality, I'll briefly think about any shorter paths the agent could take, and if there's any redundancy in our plan. What if we approached from the right, instead of from above? I think our current solution is already quite direct, but let's check if approaching from the right will be shorter.

Actually, I don't think approaching from the right would be shorter. The agent would still need to move from pos54 to pos21, which has the same number of steps as going to pos12 (or more). And the right approach doesn't make sense if we're trying to push the stone in the dirright direction, since the stone would be pushe to the opposite direction (towards pos12).

Actually, I can consider whether other types of strategies would be shorter, in case I just miss something. 

- Pushing the stone in the dirdown direction (increasing the second index) wouldn't get it to the goal, since the goal is at pos42, which is two steps to the right of the stone's initial position.
- Pushing the stone in the dirup direction (decreasing the second index) also wouldn't get it to the goal.
- Pushing the stone in the dirleft direction (decreasing the first index) would move it away from the goal.

So, pushing the stone in the dirright direction (increasing the first index) is the only strategy that can get the stone to the goal. And to do this, the agent needs to position itself dirleft of the stone, which is what our plan achieves.

I believe our solution is correct and optimal.

Actually, I just realized we could take a shorter path from pos54 to pos12. Instead of going through pos14, we could go through:

1. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft
2. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
3. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
4. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
5. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
6. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft

So let me update the plan:

1. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft 
2. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft 
3. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft 
4. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup 
5. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup 
6. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft
7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos32 dirright 
8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright 

Wait. Actually, there's an issue with that plan. After step 5, the agent is at pos22, where the stone is. Is there a way to resolve this?

Sorry, I made a critical mistake. I forgot that position pos22 is not clear; it's where stone1 is located. So, the agent can't move to that position without pushing the stone.

Let me reconsider the path from pos54 to pos12:

1. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft
2. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
3. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
4. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft
5. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
6. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup

I'll check if this is the shortest path.

From pos54 to pos12, we need to move 4 positions to the left and 2 positions up. This is a total of 6 steps, which matches the plan.

Actually, wait. We could also go up first and then left. Let me see if this is shorter.
1. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
2. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup
3. move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft
4. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
5. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft
6. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft

Wait, there's an issue with this plan as well. Position pos22 is not clear; it's where stone1 is located. So, the agent can't move to that position without pushing the stone.

Let's consider other paths. What if we go up and then left?
1. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
2. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft
3. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
4. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
5. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
6. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup

This is 6 steps as well. 

What if we go left, then up, then left?
1. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft
2. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
3. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
4. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
5. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
6. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup

This is 6 steps as well. They all are the same number of steps.

So the final solution is:

1. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft 
2. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft 
3. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft 
4. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft 
5. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup 
6. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup 
7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos32 dirright 
8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright
