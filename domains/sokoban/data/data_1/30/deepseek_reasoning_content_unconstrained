Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. So the goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. From the initial state, I see that stone1 is at pos22, and the only goal location mentioned is pos42. So I need to move stone1 from pos22 to pos42.

The agent, player1, starts at pos54. So first, I need to get the agent to a position where they can push the stone. Let's map out the path from pos54 to pos22.

Looking at the movement possibilities: pos54 can go to pos44 (dirleft), pos53 (dirup), or pos55 (dirdown). Since pos55 is clear, but moving down there might not help. Maybe going left to pos44 first.

From pos44, where can the agent go? pos44 can move to pos34 (dirleft), pos54 (dirright is not applicable since moving right from pos44 would be to pos54?), wait, the directions are a bit confusing. Wait, the movement from pos44 is: You may move from location pos44 to pos34 following direction dirleft, to pos54 following direction dirright, to pos43 following dirup, or to pos45 following dirdown. Wait, the description says "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft", etc. So dirleft from pos44 is pos34, dirright is pos54? Hmm, maybe the grid is arranged such that pos11 is top-left, pos15 is top-right, pos51 is bottom-left, pos55 is bottom-right. So moving right from a position would increase the second digit. For example, pos44 to pos45 would be down? Or maybe the directions are different. Let me check.

Wait, the movement directions are defined in the problem's initial state. For example, from pos54, moving dirleft would go to pos44. Because pos54's movement options are: "You may move from location pos54 to location pos44 following direction dirleft", "to location pos53 following direction dirup", and "to pos55 following direction dirdown". So dirleft from pos54 is pos44, dirup is pos53, dirdown is pos55.

So pos44's movements: can go to pos34 (dirleft), pos54 (dirright?), wait no. Wait, looking at the given moves for pos44: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft", "to location pos54 following direction dirright", "to location pos43 following direction dirup", and "to location pos45 following direction dirdown". So yes, moving dirright from pos44 takes you to pos54. So pos44 is in the 4th row, 4th column. So moving right (dirright) would go to the next column, which would be pos45? Wait, maybe the grid is laid out with the first digit as the row and the second as the column. So pos11 is row 1, column 1. pos12 is row 1, column 2, etc. So moving right (dirright) would increase the column number. But according to the movement from pos44 to pos54 via dirright, that's a jump from (4,4) to (5,4), which would be down a row. Hmm, maybe the directions are a bit different. Let's think again.

Wait, the movement directions are a bit confusing. Let's take the example of pos44. The movement from pos44 to pos54 is dirright. So pos44 is (4,4), moving dirright would take to (4,5), but pos54 is (5,4). That doesn't fit. Maybe the directions are not standard. The movement from pos44 to pos34 is dirleft. So dirleft from pos44 is moving to pos34, which is (3,4). So that's moving left (assuming rows are vertical). So dirleft decreases the row number? Or maybe the grid is arranged differently. Alternatively, perhaps the directions are relative to the grid's layout. For example, dirright could be east, dirleft west, dirup north, dirdown south.

Alternatively, the directions are such that moving from pos44 dirright leads to pos54. That would imply that moving right from (4,4) goes to (5,4), which might be south. But that's conflicting with standard directions.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe it's better to map out the possible paths step by step.

The agent is at pos54. The stone is at pos22. The goal is pos42. So the agent needs to get to a position adjacent to the stone to push it towards pos42.

First, the agent needs to move from pos54 to somewhere near pos22. Let's see the possible paths.

From pos54, the agent can move dirleft to pos44, dirup to pos53, or dirdown to pos55. Let's consider moving left to pos44 first.

From pos44, where can the agent go? Possible moves: dirleft to pos34, dirright to pos54 (back), dirup to pos43, dirdown to pos45.

If the agent goes to pos34 from pos44, then from pos34, possible moves: dirleft to pos24, dirright to pos44, dirup to pos33, dirdown to pos35.

But this seems to be moving away from the stone. Alternatively, maybe moving up from pos44 to pos43.

From pos43, possible moves: dirleft to pos33, dirright to pos53, dirup to pos42 (since "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft", "to location pos53 following direction dirright", "to location pos42 following direction dirup", and "to pos44 following direction dirdown"). Wait, no: the movement from pos43 is:

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown"

So from pos43, moving dirup (north) would take the agent to pos42, which is the goal location. But pos42 is a goal location, but the agent can move there if it's clear. Since in the initial state, pos42 is a goal location, and the initial state says "Location pos42 is clear". So the agent can move from pos43 to pos42 via dirup.

So the path from pos54 to pos42 would be: pos54 -> pos44 (dirleft), then pos44 -> pos43 (dirup), then pos43 -> pos42 (dirup). Wait, but can the agent move directly from pos44 to pos43 via dirup? Let me check:

Looking at pos44's movement options: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft", "to location pos54 following direction dirright", "to location pos43 following direction dirup", "to location pos45 following direction dirdown". Yes, so from pos44, moving dirup takes the agent to pos43. Then from pos43, moving dirup to pos42.

So that's a path: pos54 -> pos44 (move left), then pos44 -> pos43 (move up), then pos43 -> pos42 (move up). But once the agent is at pos42, which is the goal location for the stone. But the stone is at pos22. So the agent is at pos42, but the stone is far away.

Wait, maybe I need a different approach. The stone is at pos22. The goal is pos42. So the stone needs to move from pos22 to pos42. To push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent to it and push in the direction towards pos42.

The possible directions for pushing the stone from pos22 to pos32 (then to pos42) would be east (dirright), since pos22 to pos32 is dirright. Then from pos32 to pos42 again dirright.

So the agent needs to get to pos22's west (pos21) to push east, or south (pos23) to push north, or north (pos12) to push south. Wait, but pushing requires the agent to be in a position adjacent to the stone and push it in the direction. Let me check the preconditions for the push actions.

For pushtogoal or pushtonongoal, the agent must be at l_p, the stone at l_from, and the agent can move from l_p to l_from (so l_p is adjacent to l_from), and the stone can be pushed from l_from to l_to (so l_to is adjacent to l_from in the same direction). Also, the l_to must be clear.

So for the stone at pos22, to push it east to pos32, the agent must be at pos22's west (pos21) and push east. Or, if the agent is south of the stone (pos23), pushing north (dirup?), but directions need to match.

Wait, the direction in the action refers to the direction from the agent's location to the stone's location. For example, if the agent is at pos21 (west of pos22), then the direction from pos21 to pos22 is dirdown? Or dirright? Let me check the movement directions.

Looking at the movement from pos21 to pos22: "You may move from location pos21 to location pos22 following direction dirdown". So the direction from pos21 to pos22 is dirdown. So to push the stone from pos22 to pos32 (east), the agent would need to be at pos22's east (pos23?) but that's not possible. Wait, no. Let's think: to push a stone east (dirright), the agent must be west of the stone. Wait, pushing the stone east would require the agent to be on the west side of the stone (pos21) and push east (dirdown?), but according to the movement from pos21 to pos22 is dirdown. So the direction d would be dirdown in this case. Wait, maybe the direction is the direction the agent moves towards the stone. So from pos21 to pos22 is dirdown. Then pushing the stone from pos22 to pos32 (dirright from pos22's perspective) would require the agent to be at pos21, move dirdown to pos22, and then the stone is pushed dirright to pos32. Wait, but the action's direction is the direction from l_p (agent's initial position) to l_from (stone's position). So if the agent is at pos21, and the stone is at pos22, the direction from pos21 to pos22 is dirdown. Then the stone is pushed from pos22 to pos32, which would require direction dirright from pos22. But the action's direction is the same as the direction from l_p to l_from. Wait, no. The action's direction is for both the agent's movement and the stone's movement. The action's direction d must be such that the agent can move from l_p to l_from via d, and the stone can move from l_from to l_to via d. Wait, the preconditions for pushtogoal are: (iv) you can get from l_p to l_from following d, and (v) you can get from l_from to l_to following d. So the direction d must be the same for both the agent moving from l_p to l_from, and the stone moving from l_from to l_to.

So for example, if the agent is at pos21 (west of pos22), and wants to push the stone east to pos32, the direction d would have to be dirright. But according to the movement options, moving from pos21 to pos22 is via dirdown. So direction d is dirdown. Then from pos22, moving dirdown would go to pos23. So this would not push the stone east but south. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the directions are such that moving in a certain direction allows the agent to push the stone in that direction. For example, if the agent is north of the stone and moves south (dirdown) into the stone's position, then the stone is pushed south. Similarly, if the agent is west of the stone and moves east (dirright), pushing the stone east.

Wait, but according to the movement directions, moving from pos21 to pos22 is via dirdown. So in that case, the direction is dirdown, which is south. So if the agent is at pos21 (northwest of pos22?), and moves dirdown to pos22, then the stone would be pushed dirdown (south) to pos23. But we need to push the stone east to pos32. So maybe the agent needs to approach from the west side (pos21) and push east (dirright). But according to the movement, from pos21 to pos22 is dirdown, not dirright. So perhaps the directions are different.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to map out the positions and their connections.

Looking at the movement from pos22:

- You can go to pos12 (dirleft), pos32 (dirright), pos21 (dirup), pos23 (dirdown).

So pos22's neighbors are pos12 (north?), pos32 (east?), pos21 (west?), pos23 (south?).

Wait, but according to the movement from pos22:

- dirleft takes you to pos12. So dirleft from pos22 is north? Because pos12 is row 1, column 2. pos22 is row 2, column 2. So moving dirleft from pos22 to pos12 would be up (since row decreases). Similarly, dirright from pos22 to pos32 (row 3, column 2) would be down. dirup from pos22 to pos21 (row 2, column 1) would be left. dirdown from pos22 to pos23 (row 2, column 3) would be right? This seems contradictory. Maybe the directions are not aligned with the grid as I thought.

Alternatively, perhaps the directions are based on the movement's direction name. For example, dirup might correspond to moving to a higher row number, but that doesn't make sense. Let's see:

For example, moving from pos22 dirup to pos21. pos21 is row 2, column 1. So from pos22 (row 2, column 2), moving dirup (which is west?) to pos21. Then dirleft from pos22 to pos12 (row 1, column 2), which would be north. So dirleft is north, dirright is south, dirup is west, dirdown is east? That's possible. So direction names might not correspond to the standard directions. For example:

- dirup: west
- dirdown: east
- dirleft: north
- dirright: south

But that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe the directions are as follows:

- dirup: row decreases (north)
- dirdown: row increases (south)
- dirleft: column decreases (west)
- dirright: column increases (east)

But according to the movement from pos22:

- moving dirleft goes to pos12 (row 1, column 2), which would be north (dirup, not dirleft). So this doesn't align. So perhaps the directions are named differently. For example, dirleft could correspond to north, dirright to south, dirup to west, dirdown to east. That might be the case.

But this is getting too confusing. Let's instead look at the movement from pos22 to pos32. The movement is dirright. So from pos22 to pos32 is dirright. So dirright from pos22 is east (column increases). But pos32 is row 3, column 2, which is south of pos22. Wait, pos22 is (2,2), pos32 is (3,2). So moving south. So dirright from pos22 to pos32 is south. That would mean that dirright corresponds to south. Similarly, moving dirleft from pos22 to pos12 (row 1, column 2) is north. So dirleft is north, dirright is south, dirup is west, dirdown is east. Wait, that's possible. So the directions are:

- dirup: west
- dirdown: east
- dirleft: north
- dirright: south

But that's non-intuitive. Alternatively, the directions are based on the movement's effect. For example, moving dirright from pos22 takes you south to pos32. So dirright is south. Moving dirleft from pos22 takes you north to pos12. So dirleft is north. Moving dirup from pos22 takes you west to pos21. Moving dirdown from pos22 takes you east to pos23.

This is very confusing. To avoid getting stuck, perhaps I can look at the movement options for a few positions and map the directions.

Take pos22's movements:

- You may move from pos22 to pos12 following dirleft (north)
- to pos32 following dirright (south)
- to pos21 following dirup (west)
- to pos23 following dirdown (east)

So:

- dirleft: north
- dirright: south
- dirup: west
- dirdown: east

So the directions are named as follows:

- dirleft is north
- dirright is south
- dirup is west
- dirdown is east

That's the key insight. So when you move dirleft from a position, you go north (row decreases). dirright is south (row increases). dirup is west (column decreases). dirdown is east (column increases).

So to move the stone from pos22 to pos32 (south), the agent would have to be north of the stone (pos12) and push it dirright (south). Wait, but the agent can't be at pos12, because the stone is at pos22. Wait, no, the agent needs to be adjacent to the stone to push it.

So to push the stone south (dirright) to pos32, the agent must be north of the stone (pos12) and move dirright (south) into the stone's position, pushing it dirright (south) to pos32. But pos12 is clear in the initial state.

Alternatively, the agent can be west of the stone (pos21) and push it east (dirdown) to pos22's east (pos23), but that's not helpful. Wait, the goal is to get the stone to pos42, which is in row 4, column 2. So the stone needs to go from pos22 (row 2, column 2) to pos32 (row 3, column 2) to pos42 (row4, column2). Each step south (dirright).

So the agent needs to push the stone south twice. Each time, the agent must be north of the stone and push it south (dirright). So first push from pos22 to pos32, then from pos32 to pos42.

But how does the agent get into position to do that?

The agent starts at pos54. To reach pos12 (north of pos22), the agent would need to move through various positions. Let's map a path.

From pos54, possible moves: dirleft to pos44, dirup to pos53, dirdown to pos55.

Let's try moving dirleft to pos44. Then from pos44, dirup to pos43. From pos43, dirup to pos42 (which is the goal location). Now the agent is at pos42, which is the goal. But the stone is at pos22. From pos42, the agent can move dirleft (north) to pos32, then dirleft to pos22. Wait, but pos32 may not be clear. Wait, in the initial state, pos32 is clear. So the agent can move from pos42 to pos32 via dirleft (north?), then to pos22 via dirleft again.

Wait, from pos42's movement options: "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft", "to location pos52 following direction dirright", "to location pos41 following direction dirup", "to location pos43 following direction dirdown".

So dirleft from pos42 is to pos32 (north), dirright to pos52 (south), dirup to pos41 (west?), dirdown to pos43 (east?).

Assuming dirleft is north, then from pos42 to pos32 (row 3, column 2) via dirleft. Then from pos32, dirleft (north) would take the agent to pos22. But pos32 is clear initially. So the agent can move from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft), then from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft). But pos22 has the stone, so the agent can't move there unless it's clear. Wait, the initial state says "Location pos22 is clear", but "stone1 is at location pos22". Wait, this is a contradiction. Wait, no: in the initial state, the "Location pos22 is clear" is stated, but the stone is at pos22. That can't be. Oh wait, no. The initial state lists "stone1 is at location pos22" and "Location pos22 is clear". But if a stone is at pos22, then pos22 is not clear. This is a mistake in the problem description. But according to the given initial state:

- "stone1 is at location pos22"
- "Location pos22 is clear"

This is conflicting. A location can't be clear if a stone is there. So perhaps it's a typo. But according to the user's problem statement, we have to take it as given. Wait, but that's impossible. So perhaps in the problem, "clear" means that the agent is not there, but stones can be there. Wait, the problem says: "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So a location is clear if it doesn't have the agent or a stone. But in the initial state, pos22 has the stone, so it's not clear. But the problem states "Location pos22 is clear". This must be a mistake. But since the user provided it, maybe we have to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps "clear" means the agent is not present. But the problem says "each position may contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty". So a location is clear if it's empty. Therefore, if a stone is there, it's not clear. So the initial state has a contradiction. But the user says that in the original state, "stone1 is at location pos22" and "Location pos22 is clear". That's impossible. Therefore, this must be a mistake. But since I have to work with the given problem, I'll proceed.

Assuming that despite the stone being at pos22, pos22 is considered clear (which is a mistake), the agent can move there. But that's not possible normally. This is a problem. But perhaps it's a typo, and the stone is at pos22, which is not clear. Then the initial state is inconsistent. But maybe the user intended that pos22 is clear except for the stone. But according to the problem's definition, a location is clear if it's empty. So having a stone there means it's not clear. So this is a contradiction. But perhaps the user made a mistake in stating that pos22 is clear. Let's check the original state again:

Looking back at the original state:

The original state lists:

- "stone1 is at location pos22"
- "Location pos22 is clear"

But this is impossible. Therefore, this must be a mistake. Maybe the user intended that pos22 is not clear, but it's listed as clear. This is a problem. But since I have to proceed, perhaps I should assume that the stone is at pos22 and pos22 is not clear, and the listing of pos22 as clear is an error. Or perhaps the agent can move into a location with a stone if they are pushing it. Wait, no. The move action requires that the destination is clear. So if the stone is at pos22, then pos22 is not clear, so the agent can't move there via the move action. But the user says in the original state that pos22 is clear. This is conflicting.

Given this contradiction, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Maybe "clear" means that there's no agent present. So a location can have a stone and still be considered clear. But that's not how the problem is defined. The problem states that each position may contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. So "clear" means empty. So pos22 can't be clear if there's a stone there. Therefore, the problem's initial state is inconsistent. But since this is a hypothetical problem, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that pos22 is not clear, and the user made a mistake in listing it as clear. Or maybe "clear" refers to the agent not being there. That is, "clear" means the agent is not present, but stones can be there. Then the move action's precondition (ii) location l_to is clear would mean that the agent is not there, but stones can be present. However, the problem says "each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty". So if a stone is present, the location is not empty, hence not clear. Therefore, the initial state is incorrect. But since I have to solve this, I'll proceed with the given information, assuming that pos22 has the stone and is not clear, and the user mistakenly listed it as clear. Therefore, the agent cannot move into pos22 via a move action.

But this complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended that pos22 is clear (no agent or stone) and the stone is elsewhere. But the problem states "stone1 is at location pos22". This is very confusing. Given this contradiction, I'll have to proceed carefully.

Assuming that the stone is at pos22 and pos22 is not clear (which contradicts the given initial state), the agent can't move there. Therefore, to push the stone, the agent must be adjacent to it. So the agent needs to get to a position adjacent to pos22, such as pos21, pos12, pos23, or pos32.

From the agent's starting position pos54, the path to pos21 would be long. Let's think:

pos54 can move dirleft to pos44. Then pos44 to pos34 via dirleft. Then pos34 to pos24 via dirleft. pos24 to pos14 via dirleft. pos14 to pos13 via dirup. Then pos13 to pos12 via dirup. Then pos12 is adjacent to pos22 (north of it). So from pos12, the agent can push the stone south (dirright) to pos22's south, which is pos32. But the stone is already at pos22. Wait, no. If the agent is at pos12 (north of pos22), they can push the stone south (dirright) to pos32. But for that, the agent needs to be at pos12, and the stone at pos22. The action would be pushtogoal or pushtonongoal, depending on whether the destination is a goal location.

But pos32 is not a goal location. The goal is pos42. So pushing the stone from pos22 to pos32 (non-goal) would require using pushtonongoal. Then from pos32, pushing it further south to pos42 (which is a goal location) with pushtogoal.

So the steps would be:

1. Agent moves from pos54 to pos44 (dirleft).
2. Agent moves from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft).
3. Agent moves from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft).
4. Agent moves from pos24 to pos14 (dirleft).
5. Agent moves from pos14 to pos13 (dirup).
6. Agent moves from pos13 to pos12 (dirup).
7. Agent pushes the stone from pos22 to pos32 (south) using pushtonongoal, since pos32 is not a goal.
8. Agent then moves to pos32 (from pos22 after pushing, but need to check where the agent ends up after the push).
Wait, after pushing, the agent's new position is l_from (pos22) in this case. Wait, no. Looking at the effects of pushtonongoal: After performing this action, (i) agent p is no longer at l_p, (ii) stone s is no longer at l_from, (iii) l_to is no longer clear, (iv) agent p is at l_from, (v) stone s is at l_to, (vi) l_p is clear, (vii) stone s is at a non-goal state.

So when the agent pushes the stone from l_from to l_to, the agent moves from l_p (their initial position) to l_from, and the stone moves to l_to.

So in step 7, the agent is at pos12 (l_p), pushes the stone from pos22 (l_from) to pos32 (l_to) via direction dirdown (since moving from pos12 to pos22 is dirright (south), and from pos22 to pos32 is dirright (south)). Wait, direction d must be the same for both movements.

So for the action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos32 dirright", since direction dirright from pos12 to pos22 is allowed (according to the movement options: from pos12 to pos22 is dirright). Then from pos22 to pos32 is also dirright. So the preconditions are met: agent is at pos12 (l_p), stone is at pos22 (l_from), l_to (pos32) is clear (initial state says pos32 is clear), movement from l_p (pos12) to l_from (pos22) is dirright, movement from l_from to l_to (pos32) is dirright, and l_to is not a goal (pos32 is not a goal).

After this action, the agent is now at pos22, and the stone is at pos32. pos12 becomes clear.

Then, the agent needs to push the stone from pos32 to pos42. For that, the agent needs to be north of pos32 (pos22) and push south (dirright) to pos42.

But after the first push, the agent is at pos22. So to push the stone again, the agent needs to move to pos32's north, which is pos22. Wait, pos32's north is pos22 (since pos32 is row 3, column 2; north would be row 2, column 2 (pos22)). So the agent is already at pos22 after the first push.

So the next action would be pushtogoal, since pos42 is a goal location. So the agent is at pos22 (l_p), stone is at pos32 (l_from). The agent can push from pos32 to pos42 (south, dirright). The preconditions are: agent is at l_p (pos22), stone at l_from (pos32), l_to (pos42) is clear, movement from pos22 to pos32 via dirright (south), movement from pos32 to pos42 via dirright (south), and l_to is a goal.

So the action would be "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright".

After this, the stone is at pos42 (goal), and the agent is at pos32.

This would achieve the goal.

So the plan would be:

1. Move agent from pos54 to pos44 via dirleft.
2. Move agent from pos44 to pos34 via dirleft.
3. Move agent from pos34 to pos24 via dirleft.
4. Move agent from pos24 to pos14 via dirleft.
5. Move agent from pos14 to pos13 via dirup (west).
6. Move agent from pos13 to pos12 via dirup (west).
7. Push stone from pos22 to pos32 using pushtonongoal, with agent at pos12, direction dirright.
8. Push stone from pos32 to pos42 using pushtogoal, with agent at pos22, direction dirright.

But wait, step 6: after moving to pos12, the agent is at pos12. Then step 7: the agent is at pos12 (l_p), pushes the stone from pos22 (l_from) to pos32 (l_to) via direction dirright. After this action, the agent moves to pos22, and the stone to pos32.

Then step 8: the agent is at pos22, pushes the stone from pos32 to pos42. But how? The agent is at pos22, which is north of pos32. So direction from pos22 to pos32 is dirright (south). Then from pos32 to pos42 is also dirright (south). So the action would be "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright".

But wait, the agent is at pos22 (l_p), stone is at pos32 (l_from). To push it to pos42 (l_to), the agent must move from l_p (pos22) to l_from (pos32) via direction d. The direction d here is dirright (south). Then the stone moves from pos32 to pos42 via dirright (south). Yes.

So this seems correct.

Now, let's check if all moves are possible.

The initial moves from pos54 to pos44: move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft. Preconditions: agent is at pos54, pos44 is clear. Initial state says pos44 is clear. Yes.

Then pos44 to pos34 via dirleft: pos34 is clear.

pos34 to pos24 via dirleft: pos24 is clear.

pos24 to pos14 via dirleft: pos14 is clear.

pos14 to pos13 via dirup (west? Because from pos14, dirup is to pos13. According to movement options for pos14: "You may move from location pos14 to location pos24 following direction dirright (south?), but wait, movement from pos14 is:

"You may move from location pos14 to pos24 via dirright", "pos13 via dirup", "pos15 via dirdown".

Assuming dirup from pos14 to pos13 is west (row 1, column 4 to row 1, column 3). So pos14 is row 1, column4, pos13 is row1, column3. So dirup is west. So moving from pos14 to pos13 via dirup (west).

Then from pos13 to pos12 via dirup (west). pos12 is clear.

Then, the agent is at pos12. Now, the stone is at pos22. So the agent can perform the pushtonongoal action:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos32 dirright.

Preconditions:

- Agent is at pos12 (yes).
- Stone is at pos22 (yes).
- pos32 is clear (initial state says pos32 is clear).
- Can move from pos12 to pos22 via dirright (yes, according to movement options).
- Can move from pos22 to pos32 via dirright (yes).
- pos32 is not a goal (yes).

After this action:

- Agent moves to pos22, stone moves to pos32. pos12 becomes clear.

Then, the agent is at pos22. Now, the stone is at pos32. Next action is pushtogoal:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright.

Preconditions:

- Agent is at pos22 (yes).
- Stone is at pos32 (yes).
- pos42 is clear (initial state says pos42 is clear).
- Can move from pos22 to pos32 via dirright (yes).
- Can move from pos32 to pos42 via dirright (yes).
- pos42 is a goal (yes).

After this action:

- Agent moves to pos32, stone moves to pos42. pos22 becomes clear.

The stone is now at pos42, which is a goal location. Thus, the goal is achieved.

So the plan has 8 steps. But maybe there's a shorter path.

Wait, the initial path from pos54 to pos12 is 6 steps. Is there a shorter way? Let's see.

pos54 -> pos44 (dirleft)

pos44 -> pos34 (dirleft)

pos34 -> pos24 (dirleft)

pos24 -> pos14 (dirleft)

pos14 -> pos13 (dirup)

pos13 -> pos12 (dirup)

That's 6 moves. Then two pushes. Total 8 actions.

But maybe there's a quicker route. For example, can the agent move up from pos54 to pos53, then left to pos43, etc.?

Alternative path:

pos54 -> pos53 (dirup)

pos53 -> pos43 (dirleft) [from pos53's movement options: "You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft (north)"].

From pos43, move dirup to pos42 (dirup from pos43 to pos42).

Then pos42 -> pos32 (dirleft)

pos32 -> pos22 (dirleft)

But pos22 has the stone. So agent can't move there. So this path doesn't help. Alternatively, from pos42, the agent can push the stone if they are adjacent. But the stone is at pos22, which is two steps away.

Alternatively, after reaching pos42, the agent can move to pos32, then to pos22, but pos22 is occupied by the stone. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, another path:

pos54 -> pos44 (dirleft)

pos44 -> pos43 (dirup)

pos43 -> pos33 (dirup)

pos33 -> pos23 (dirup)

pos23 -> pos13 (dirup)

pos13 -> pos12 (dirup)

This is 6 moves again. Same number.

Alternatively, pos54 -> pos44 -> pos43 -> pos42 (dirup), then from pos42, move dirleft to pos32, dirleft to pos22. But again, pos22 has the stone.

So no shorter path. Therefore, the initial plan of 8 actions is the optimal one.
