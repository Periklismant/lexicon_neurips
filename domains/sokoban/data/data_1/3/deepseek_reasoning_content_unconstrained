Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. So the goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. The only goal location mentioned is pos15. The initial state has stone1 at pos32, and the agent (player1) is at pos55. 

First, I need to plan a path for the agent to get to stone1's location, which is pos32. Then, push the stone towards pos15. But pushing stones in this grid requires considering the directions and the available moves. Let me map out the possible paths.

Starting at pos55, the agent can move to pos54 (dirup) or pos45 (dirleft). Let's see the movement possibilities. From pos55, moving dirleft would take the agent to pos45. From pos45, maybe the agent can go up to pos44, then left to pos34, etc. But that might be a longer path. Alternatively, moving up from pos55 to pos54, then left to pos44, and so on.

Wait, the movement directions are a bit complex. Let me check the allowed moves for each location. For pos55, the allowed moves are dirleft to pos45 or dirup to pos54. Let's see the path from pos55 to pos32. 

Possible path: pos55 → pos45 (dirleft), then pos45 → pos35 (dirleft), but wait, pos45 to pos35 is dirleft? No, looking back at the movement rules: "You may move from location pos45 to location pos35 following direction dirleft". So yes. So pos45 to pos35 is dirleft. Then pos35 → pos34 (dirup), pos34 → pos24 (dirleft), pos24 → pos23 (dirup?), wait no. Let me check the connections step by step.

Alternatively, maybe a different path. Let's list the possible steps:

From pos55, agent can go dirup to pos54. Then from pos54, dirleft to pos44. Then pos44 can go dirup to pos43 or dirleft to pos34. If we go to pos34, then from pos34 dirleft to pos24, then pos24 dirleft to pos14, pos14 dirleft to pos24? Wait, no. Wait, the movement directions are specific. Let me check each location's possible moves.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to find the shortest path from pos55 to pos32. Let's think of the grid as a 5x5 grid where rows are 1-5 and columns 1-5. So pos55 is row 5, column 5. pos32 is row 3, column 2.

The agent needs to get from (5,5) to (3,2). Let's think in terms of moving up and left. For each step, the allowed directions need to be followed.

From pos55 (5,5), moving dirup to pos54 (5,4). Then from pos54, dirup to pos53? Wait, looking at the movement rules: From pos54, possible directions are dirleft to pos44, dirup to pos53 (since moving dirdown from pos53 to pos54 is allowed, but moving up from pos54 would be to pos53 if there's a connection. Wait, checking the given moves:

Looking at the movement rules for pos54: "You may move from location pos54 to location pos44 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos54 to location pos53 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos54 to location pos55 following direction dirdown". Wait, no, the movement from pos54 to pos53 is via dirup? Wait, the movement directions are a bit confusing. Let me check:

The movement entries are listed as "You may move from location A to location B following direction D". So for example, if the entry is "You may move from pos54 to pos44 following dirleft", then moving from pos54 to pos44 requires direction dirleft.

So for pos54, the possible moves are:

- dirleft to pos44

- dirup to pos53 (since "You may move from location pos54 to location pos53 following direction dirup"? Wait, let me check. Looking through the list:

Looking for entries starting with pos54. The entries are:

"You may move from location pos54 to location pos44 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos54 to location pos53 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos54 to location pos55 following direction dirdown"

Wait, no, the actual entries are:

Wait, in the original problem's movement list, I need to find all entries where the from location is pos55, pos54, etc. Let me search for "pos54":

Found:

"You may move from location pos54 to location pos44 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos54 to location pos53 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos54 to location pos55 following direction dirdown"

So, from pos54, moving dirup takes you to pos53. So pos54 → pos53 via dirup.

So, the agent's path from pos55 to pos32:

Option 1:

pos55 → pos45 (dirleft)

pos45 → pos35 (dirleft)

pos35 → pos34 (dirup)

pos34 → pos24 (dirleft)

pos24 → pos23 (dirup)

pos23 → pos22 (dirup)

pos22 → pos32 (dirright)

Wait, but from pos22, can the agent move dirright to pos32? Let me check the movement rules for pos22:

Looking at the movement entries for pos22:

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos32 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos21 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos23 following direction dirdown"

Yes. So from pos22, moving dirright takes you to pos32. So if the agent can get to pos22, then moving dirright to pos32 is possible.

But how to get to pos22 from pos35?

Alternatively, from pos35, can the agent go to pos25 (dirleft), then pos25 to pos24 (dirup), pos24 to pos23 (dirup), pos23 to pos22 (dirup), then pos22 to pos32 (dirright). That's possible.

But let's map out the steps:

Starting at pos55:

1. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft

Now at pos45.

2. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft

At pos35.

3. move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft

At pos25.

4. move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup

At pos24.

5. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup

At pos23.

6. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup

At pos22.

7. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright

At pos32.

But wait, the stone is at pos32. So the agent cannot move into pos32 if it's occupied. But in the initial state, pos32 is clear? Wait, checking the initial state:

Original state includes "Location pos32 is clear". But stone1 is at pos32. Wait, wait, the initial state says:

"stone1 is at location pos32"

But then under "Location pos32 is clear". That's conflicting. Wait, perhaps a mistake in the problem statement? Because if the stone is at pos32, then pos32 is not clear. But according to the initial state, "Location pos32 is clear" is listed. That must be an error. But according to the problem statement, the user provided this, so maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Let me check again.

Looking at the original state:

The original state includes:

"stone1 is at location pos32"

"Location pos32 is clear"

But if a stone is at pos32, then the location isn't clear. This seems contradictory. But perhaps the problem statement has a typo. Or maybe "clear" refers to the absence of the agent? Wait, the problem's description says each position may contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. So "clear" would mean neither agent nor stone is present. So if a stone is at pos32, then pos32 is not clear. Therefore, there's a contradiction in the problem statement. But the user provided this, so I have to go with what's given. Wait, but according to the problem's original state:

Looking at the list:

"player1 is at location pos55"

"stone1 is at location pos32"

Then under "Location pos32 is clear" — that must be a mistake. Because if stone1 is there, it's not clear. But maybe the "clear" refers to the agent not being there. Wait, but the problem says "each position may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty. Each position is flagged as ...". So a location is clear if it has neither agent nor stone. So if a stone is present, the location is not clear. Therefore, the initial state has a contradiction. But perhaps the user made a typo, and pos32 is not clear. But according to the given initial state, pos32 is listed as clear. Hmm. This is confusing.

Wait, the original state says:

"Location pos32 is clear"

But also "stone1 is at location pos32"

So that's impossible. Therefore, there's a mistake here. Maybe the stone is at pos32 but the location is not clear? Or the stone is elsewhere. But the user provided this, so perhaps I have to proceed with the given information. Maybe in this domain, a stone's presence doesn't block the location's "clear" status. Wait, but according to the action preconditions, for example, "move" requires that the target location is clear. So if a stone is present, the location is not clear, so you can't move there. Therefore, in the initial state, since stone1 is at pos32, pos32 is not clear, but the problem says it's clear. This is a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. But I have to work with the given data.

Assuming that the problem is correctly stated, and that even though the stone is at pos32, pos32 is considered clear. That would be inconsistent with the problem's own definitions, but perhaps in this domain, "clear" refers only to the agent's presence. That is, a location is clear if the agent is not there, regardless of stones. But that's conflicting with the action preconditions. For example, the "move" action requires that the target location is clear. So if a stone is there, you can't move. So perhaps the initial state's "Location pos32 is clear" is a mistake. But since the user provided this, maybe the stone is not actually at pos32. But according to the problem, it is. This is a problem. 

Alternatively, maybe the initial state lists "stone1 is at location pos32" and "Location pos32 is clear" as separate facts, meaning that the stone is there but the location is still considered clear. But that contradicts the domain's rules. Hmm. This is a critical issue because if pos32 is clear, then the agent can move there, but if it's not clear (because the stone is there), then the agent can't. 

Wait, looking at the problem's initial state again:

Original state:

"player1 is at location pos55"

"stone1 is at location pos32"

Then in the list of locations that are clear, it includes "Location pos32 is clear".

This is contradictory. Therefore, perhaps the user intended that pos32 is clear despite the stone being there, but according to the domain's rules, that's not possible. This is a problem. However, since the problem is given as such, perhaps I have to proceed under the assumption that in this specific case, the stone's presence doesn't block the location from being considered clear for movement. But that's against the problem's own description. 

Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo, and the stone is not at pos32. But according to the problem, it is. This is a problem. But perhaps I should proceed with the given information, even if it's conflicting, and assume that pos32 is clear and the stone is there. Therefore, the agent can move into pos32 even with the stone there. But that would violate the preconditions for the move action. So when the agent tries to move to pos32, it would check if it's clear. According to the initial state, it is clear, so the move is allowed, even though there's a stone there. But according to the problem's own definition, a stone at a location makes it not clear. So this is conflicting. 

Alternatively, maybe the initial state is correct, and there's a mistake in the problem. For example, the stone is actually at pos33, but the initial state says pos32. But without more information, I have to proceed as per the problem statement.

Assuming that the stone is at pos32, and pos32 is clear (as per the problem's initial state), then the agent can move to pos32. But that would be impossible under normal domain rules. However, according to the given initial state, it's possible. Therefore, the agent can move to pos32. Once there, perhaps the stone is pushed. But the actions for pushing require that the agent is adjacent and can push the stone in a direction.

But given this contradiction, I'm stuck. Let's proceed under the assumption that the problem is correctly stated, and that pos32 is clear despite the stone being there. Therefore, the agent can move to pos32, and then push the stone. But according to the problem's action preconditions, for pushing, the agent must be at a location adjacent to the stone. Let's think again.

Wait, the "pushtogoal" and "pushtonongoal" actions require that the agent is at l_p, the stone is at l_from, and l_p is adjacent to l_from in direction d. For example, to push the stone from l_from to l_to, the agent must be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from in the opposite direction. For example, if the agent is north of the stone, they can push it south. 

So, the agent needs to be at a location adjacent to the stone. Since the stone is at pos32, the agent needs to be at a location adjacent to pos32. The adjacent locations are pos22 (up), pos42 (down), pos31 (left), pos33 (right). 

Looking at the movement graph, let's see how the agent can get to one of these positions.

The stone is at pos32. To push it, the agent needs to be at pos22, pos42, pos31, or pos33. Then push in the respective direction.

The goal is to get the stone to a goal location, which is pos15. So the stone needs to move from pos32 to pos15. That's a long path. Let's see possible routes.

From pos32, pushing the stone up (dirup) would take it to pos22. Then from pos22, pushing up to pos12, then to pos13, etc. But the goal is pos15. Alternatively, moving the stone to pos32 → pos33 → pos34 → pos35 → pos25 → pos15. That might be a path.

But pos15 is a goal location. So the plan would involve moving the agent to a position adjacent to the stone, then pushing it step by step towards pos15.

But first, the agent needs to reach a position adjacent to the stone. Let's plan the agent's path to, say, pos33, which is to the right of the stone. But according to the initial state, pos33 is clear. Wait, initial state says "Location pos33 is clear". So pos33 is clear. So the agent can move there.

But to reach pos33, the agent needs a path from pos55 to pos33. Let's see:

Possible path:

pos55 → pos54 (dirup)

pos54 → pos44 (dirleft)

pos44 → pos34 (dirleft)

pos34 → pos33 (dirup)

Then, from pos33, the agent can push the stone to pos34 (dirright?), but wait, the directions are specific. Let's check the allowed movements.

From pos33, moving dirright would take the agent to pos43. But to push the stone from pos32 to pos33, the agent needs to be at pos32's adjacent location. For example, to push the stone east to pos33, the agent must be west of the stone (pos32's left is pos31). Wait, no. The direction in the push action refers to the direction from the agent's position to the stone's position. For example, if the agent is at pos31 (west of pos32), then the direction would be dirright (east), and pushing the stone east to pos33. But the preconditions for "pushtogoal" require that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (pos32) in direction d. So, the agent must be able to move from l_p to l_from (pos32) following direction d. So for example, if the agent is at pos31, and direction dirright, then moving from pos31 to pos32 is allowed. Let's check:

Looking at the movement rules for pos31:

"You may move from location pos31 to location pos21 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos31 to location pos41 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos31 to location pos32 following direction dirdown"

Ah, so from pos31, moving dirdown to pos32. So direction dirdown. So if the agent is at pos31, and the stone is at pos32, then the agent can push the stone down to pos42 (since pos32 to pos42 is dirdown). But pos42 is a non-goal location, so using pushtonongoal. But the goal is to get the stone to pos15, which is a goal location. So perhaps pushing the stone upwards first.

Alternatively, if the agent is at pos22 (north of pos32), direction dirdown to pos32. Then pushing the stone down to pos42 (but that's away from the goal). Or pushing the stone to the right (east) to pos33. Wait, but the agent would have to be west of the stone to push it east. So agent at pos31 (west of pos32) can push it east to pos33. But pos33 is a non-goal location, so using pushtonongoal.

But the ultimate goal is to get the stone to pos15. So the stone needs to move from pos32 to pos33, then to pos34, pos35, pos25, pos15. But each step requires the agent to be in the correct position.

Alternatively, pushing the stone up to pos22, then to pos12, then to pos13, pos14, pos15. That might be a path.

Let me outline a possible path:

1. Agent moves from pos55 to pos54 (dirup)

2. pos54 → pos44 (dirleft)

3. pos44 → pos34 (dirleft)

4. pos34 → pos33 (dirup)

5. pos33 → pos32 (dirleft?) Wait, from pos33, can the agent move to pos32? Let me check the movement rules for pos33:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown"

Ah, from pos33, moving dirup takes you to pos32. But pos32 has the stone, which according to initial state is clear. Wait, but if the stone is at pos32, then pos32 is not clear. But according to the problem's initial state, pos32 is clear. So the agent can move there. But that's conflicting. However, proceeding as per the problem's data, the agent can move to pos32. But then, after moving there, the stone is at pos32. So when the agent moves there, the location becomes occupied by the agent, and the stone is there? But that's impossible. This is a major issue. 

Alternatively, maybe the initial state has a mistake, and the stone is not at pos32. But according to the problem, it is. So this is a problem. 

Assuming that the initial state is correct, and pos32 is clear (even with the stone there), then the agent can move to pos32. But once the agent is there, the stone is there, so the location is no longer clear, and subsequent moves would be blocked. But this is very confusing. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement has a mistake in listing pos32 as clear. Given that the stone is at pos32, pos32 should not be clear. Therefore, the correct initial state should not have pos32 as clear. But according to the problem, it does. 

Given this inconsistency, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the stone is at pos32 and pos32 is not clear (despite what the problem says), but the problem's initial state lists pos32 as clear. Therefore, the agent can move there. But this leads to a contradiction. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's initial state is correct, and the stone is at pos32, but pos32 is clear. This suggests that multiple entities can occupy the same location, which contradicts the problem's description. 

This is a significant problem. Without resolving this, I can't proceed. But given that the user provided this problem, I have to work with it. Let's assume that the agent can move into pos32 despite the stone being there. 

So, the agent can move to pos32. Once there, perhaps they can push the stone. But the push actions require the agent to be adjacent to the stone. If the agent is at pos32 (same location as the stone), then they can't push it. So that's invalid. 

Therefore, the initial state must be wrong. But since I can't change the problem, I have to find another approach. 

Alternative plan: The stone is at pos32, and pos32 is not clear. So the agent cannot move there. Therefore, the agent must approach from an adjacent cell. 

Assuming that pos32 is not clear (since the stone is there), the agent needs to get to a neighboring cell. For example, pos22 (north), pos42 (south), pos31 (west), or pos33 (east). 

Let me plan a path for the agent to reach pos22. Because pushing the stone north would take it to pos22, which is closer to the goal pos15. 

Path from pos55 to pos22:

Looking for a way to reach pos22. Let's consider possible paths.

Option:

pos55 → pos54 (dirup)

pos54 → pos44 (dirleft)

pos44 → pos34 (dirleft)

pos34 → pos24 (dirleft)

pos24 → pos23 (dirdown?)

Wait, movement rules for pos24:

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos14 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos34 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos23 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos25 following direction dirdown"

So from pos24, dirup to pos23.

Then pos23 → pos22 (dirup).

Yes.

So the path would be:

1. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup

2. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft

3. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft

4. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft

5. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup

6. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup

Now at pos22. From here, the agent can push the stone north to pos12 (if possible), but pos12 is not a goal. Alternatively, push east to pos32's right (pos33), but that's not helpful. Wait, the stone is at pos32. The agent is at pos22, which is north of pos32. So the direction from pos22 to pos32 is dirdown. So the agent can push the stone down to pos42 (south of pos32). But pos42 is a non-goal location. But pushing it down would take it away from the goal. 

Alternatively, push the stone to the east, but the agent needs to be west of the stone to push east. So the agent needs to be at pos31 (west of pos32). 

Alternatively, from pos22, the agent can move east to pos32 (if possible). But pos32 has the stone and is not clear (assuming initial state was wrong). So cannot move there. 

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Let's think again. The stone is at pos32, and the agent needs to push it to pos15. The only goal location is pos15. 

The best path for the stone would be to move up to pos22, then to pos23, pos24, pos25, pos15. But pos25 is not a goal. Wait, no. The goal is pos15, which is in the top-right corner. So from pos32, the stone needs to move right to pos33, pos34, pos35, then up to pos25, pos15. Or up to pos22, then right to pos23, pos24, pos25, pos15. 

But each push requires the agent to be in the correct position. 

Let's consider pushing the stone east (right) from pos32 to pos33. To do that, the agent needs to be west of pos32 (pos31), and push east. So the agent must reach pos31.

Path to pos31:

pos55 → pos54 (dirup)

pos54 → pos44 (dirleft)

pos44 → pos34 (dirleft)

pos34 → pos24 (dirleft)

pos24 → pos14 (dirleft)

pos14 → pos13 (dirup?)

Wait, pos14's movements:

"You may move from location pos14 to location pos24 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos14 to location pos13 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos14 to location pos15 following direction dirdown"

No, dirleft from pos14 would take to pos24? No, pos14's dirleft is not mentioned. To get to pos31, maybe a different path.

From pos34, can the agent move to pos33 (dirup), then pos33 to pos32 (dirup) if possible. But pos32 has the stone. 

Alternatively, from pos34, move to pos33 (dirup), then pos33 to pos23 (dirleft). Then pos23 to pos22 (dirup). Then pos22 to pos32 (dirright). But again, pos32 has the stone.

This is getting too tangled. Let's try to outline a step-by-step plan.

Assuming the stone is at pos32, and the agent needs to push it to pos15.

Possible steps:

1. Agent moves from pos55 to pos45 (dirleft)

2. pos45 → pos35 (dirleft)

3. pos35 → pos34 (dirup)

4. pos34 → pos33 (dirup)

5. pos33 → pos32 (dirup) → but pos32 has the stone. If pos32 is clear, agent can move here. Once there, perhaps push the stone east to pos33? No, that would require the agent to be west of the stone. If the agent is at pos32, they can't push the stone east. 

Alternatively, the agent is at pos33, and the stone is at pos32. Agent can push the stone west to pos31 (dirleft), but that's not helpful. Or north to pos22 (dirup). Wait, from pos33, can the agent push the stone north? Let's see.

To push the stone north from pos32 to pos22, the agent must be south of pos32 (pos42). So agent at pos42 can push the stone north to pos32. But the stone is already at pos32. So that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, agent at pos22 can push the stone south to pos32. But the stone is already there. 

This is confusing. Maybe a different approach. Let's consider the required steps to push the stone from pos32 to pos15:

Each push action moves the stone one cell in a direction. The agent must be adjacent to the stone in the direction opposite to the push direction.

For example, to push the stone north (up) to pos22, the agent must be south of the stone (pos42) and push north. Or wait, no: the direction in the push action is the direction from the agent's location to the stone's location. So if the agent is south of the stone (pos42), then the direction from agent to stone is dirup. Then pushing the stone dirup would move it to pos32's north, which is pos22. But the stone is already at pos32. Wait, I'm getting confused with directions.

The action "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": agent at l_p, stone at l_from. The direction d is the direction from l_p to l_from. So to push the stone from l_from to l_to, l_to must be in the same direction d from l_from. 

For example, if the agent is at pos42 (south of pos32), direction d is dirup (from pos42 to pos32). Then pushing the stone dirup would take it from pos32 to pos22 (since pos32's dirup is pos22). So l_to is pos22. 

Therefore, to push the stone north to pos22, the agent must be at pos42 (south of pos32), direction dirup. Then the stone moves from pos32 to pos22. 

But pos22 is a non-goal location, so we need to use pushtonongoal. 

So steps:

Agent moves to pos42, then pushes the stone north to pos22. Then from pos22, push north to pos12, then pos12 to pos13, etc. But pos15 is the goal. 

Alternatively, once the stone is at pos22, push it east to pos23, then pos24, pos25, pos15. 

But let's plan the path for the agent to reach pos42 first.

From pos55 to pos42:

Possible path:

pos55 → pos54 (dirup)

pos54 → pos44 (dirleft)

pos44 → pos43 (dirup) 

pos43 → pos42 (dirup)

Yes.

So steps:

1. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup

2. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft

3. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

4. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup

Now at pos42. From here, the agent can push the stone at pos32 north to pos22.

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup

Preconditions check:

- agent is at pos42: yes.

- stone1 is at pos32: yes.

- pos22 is clear: initially, pos22 is clear (initial state lists pos22 as clear). 

- can get from pos42 to pos32 following dirup: according to movement rules, from pos42, can move to pos32 via dirup? Check the movement entries:

Looking for moves from pos42:

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"

Wait, no. Let's check the movement entries for pos42:

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos52 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos41 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown"

So from pos42, moving dirleft takes you to pos32. So direction dirleft. Therefore, to move from pos42 to pos32, the direction is dirleft, not dirup. 

So the direction from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft. Therefore, the push action would require direction dirleft. Then pushing the stone from pos32 to pos22 would require direction dirup, but that's not allowed. 

Wait, no. The push action's direction d is the direction from the agent's location (pos42) to the stone's location (pos32), which is dirleft. Then, the stone is pushed in the same direction dirleft from its current location (pos32) to pos31. But pos31 is a non-goal location. But that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, the agent needs to be south of the stone to push it north. So agent at pos42 (south of pos32?), but pos42 is to the right (east) of pos32. So pos42 is southeast of pos32. Therefore, the direction from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft and dirup. But according to movement rules, the directions are only dirleft, dirright, dirup, dirdown. So the agent must move in a single direction. For example, from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft (west). 

So, the agent is at pos42, dirleft to pos32. Then pushing the stone in dirleft direction would take it to pos31. But that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, the agent needs to be at pos32's north to push it south, but that's moving it away from the goal. 

This is getting too complicated. Maybe it's better to push the stone east towards pos33, then pos34, etc. 

To push the stone east from pos32 to pos33, the agent must be west of pos32 (pos31) and push east. So the agent needs to reach pos31. 

Path from pos55 to pos31:

pos55 → pos45 (dirleft)

pos45 → pos35 (dirleft)

pos35 → pos34 (dirup)

pos34 → pos33 (dirup)

pos33 → pos32 (dirup) → but pos32 has the stone. Assuming it's not clear, cannot move there. So alternative path:

pos35 → pos25 (dirleft)

pos25 → pos24 (dirup)

pos24 → pos23 (dirup)

pos23 → pos22 (dirup)

pos22 → pos32 (dirright)

But pos32 is occupied by the stone, so can't move there. 

Alternatively, from pos34, move to pos24 (dirleft)

pos24 → pos14 (dirleft)

pos14 → pos13 (dirup)

pos13 → pos12 (dirup)

pos12 → pos22 (dirright)

pos22 → pos32 (dirright) → but again, pos32 is occupied. 

This is not working. 

Alternative approach: Perhaps the agent can move to pos33, which is east of pos32. Then push the stone west to pos31. But that's moving away from the goal. 

Alternatively, push the stone north from pos32 to pos22, requiring the agent to be south of pos32 (pos42). 

So agent needs to reach pos42. 

Path to pos42:

pos55 → pos54 (dirup)

pos54 → pos44 (dirleft)

pos44 → pos43 (dirup)

pos43 → pos42 (dirup)

At pos42. Then push the stone north to pos22. 

But according to movement rules, from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft. So the direction is dirleft. So the push action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft?

Wait, no. The action requires that the direction d is the direction from the agent's location (pos42) to the stone's location (pos32). That direction is dirleft. Then, the stone is pushed from pos32 to pos22, which is dirup from pos32. But the direction in the action must be the same as the direction from the stone's location to the target location. 

The precondition for pushtogoal is: you can get from l_from (pos32) to l_to (pos22) following direction d. So d here must be dirup. 

But the direction from the agent's location (pos42) to l_from (pos32) is dirleft. So the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft

But the direction from pos32 to pos22 is dirup. So the precondition (iv) requires that you can get from l_p (pos42) to l_from (pos32) following direction d (dirleft), which is true. Then, precondition (v) requires that you can get from l_from (pos32) to l_to (pos22) following direction d (dirleft). But from pos32, moving dirleft would take you to pos31, not pos22. So this is invalid. 

Therefore, this approach won't work. 

The correct way to push the stone from pos32 to pos22 is to have the agent north of pos32, pushing south. Wait, no. To push the stone north, the agent must be south of the stone and push north. So agent at pos42 (south of pos32) can push north. But direction from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft (west), not dirup. 

This is confusing. I think the problem's movement directions and push actions are not aligned with typical grid directions. 

Let me try to map the directions:

The directions are dirdown, dirleft, dirright, dirup. 

Each movement action between locations is defined with a direction. For example, moving from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft. So dirleft corresponds to west. Similarly, moving from pos42 to pos52 is dirright (east). Moving from pos42 to pos41 is dirup (north?), and to pos43 is dirdown (south). 

Assuming that the grid is arranged with rows increasing downward and columns increasing to the right. So pos11 is row 1, column 1. pos12 is row 1, column 2. pos21 is row 2, column 1. 

So, moving dirup from pos42 (row 4, column 2) would take you to pos41 (row 4, column 1? No, pos41 is row 4, column 1. Wait, no. The location names are a bit confusing. Wait, the locations are named as posXY, where X is the row and Y the column? Or is it posXY where X is the column and Y the row? For example, pos11 is row 1, column 1. pos12 is row 1, column 2. pos21 is row 2, column 1. 

Assuming that, then moving dirup from pos42 (row 4, column 2) would go to pos41 (row 4, column 1?), which doesn't make sense. Wait, looking at the movement from pos42:

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"

pos42 is row 4, column 2. pos32 is row 3, column 2. So moving dirleft from pos42 takes you to pos32, which is north. So dirleft corresponds to north. This is confusing. 

Alternatively, the directions are not aligned with typical grid movements. For example, dirleft might mean moving west, but in some cases, it's moving north. 

This makes it very difficult to plan without a clear understanding of the grid layout and direction mappings. 

Given the time constraints, perhaps the optimal plan is to move the agent to pos32, assuming pos32 is clear (despite the stone being there), then push the stone to a goal location. 

But this is not possible under normal circumstances. Alternatively, the stone is already at a goal location. Wait, the problem's goal is to have stone1 at a goal location. The only goal location is pos15. So the stone must be moved to pos15. 

Given the complexity, perhaps the shortest path is:

Agent moves from pos55 to pos45 (dirleft), then to pos35 (dirleft), pos25 (dirleft), pos15 (dirleft). Wait, but pos15 is a goal location. Then, the agent needs to push the stone from pos32 to pos15. But how?

Alternatively, the agent needs to move to a position where they can push the stone along the path to pos15. 

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I think the correct plan involves the agent moving to pos32, then pushing the stone east to pos33, then east to pos34, pos35, pos45, pos55. But pos55 is not a goal. Wait, no. The only goal is pos15. 

I think I'm stuck here. Given the time, I'll try to propose a plan that moves the agent to pos32, then pushes the stone towards pos15 via a series of steps. But given the initial state's contradictions, this might not be correct. 

Assuming that the agent can move to pos32 (even though it's occupied by the stone), then perhaps the stone can be pushed. But that's invalid. 

Alternatively, the correct plan is:

1. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft

2. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft

3. move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft

4. move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft

Now agent is at pos15. But how to push the stone from pos32 to pos15. The agent needs to be adjacent to the stone. 

The agent is at pos15. The stone is at pos32. The distance is too far. So this is not helpful. 

Alternative plan: Agent moves to pos22, then pushes the stone north to pos12, then east to pos13, pos14, pos15. 

But how to get the agent to pos22. Path:

1. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup

2. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft

3. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft

4. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft

5. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup

6. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup

Now at pos22. Then push the stone north to pos12 (pushtonongoal):

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos22 dirright? No, the agent is at pos22, the stone is at pos32. The direction from pos22 to pos32 is dirright (east), but pos32 is south of pos22. Wait, no. pos22 is row 2, column 2. pos32 is row 3, column 2. So the direction from pos22 to pos32 is dirdown. 

So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirdown. But pos42 is a non-goal location. 

This isn't helpful. 

Given the time I've spent and the complexity of the problem, I think I need to provide a plan that moves the agent to a position where they can push the stone towards the goal, but I'm not confident. 

Final attempt:

Agent moves from pos55 to pos45, pos35, pos34, pos33, pos32 (assuming it's clear). Then pushes the stone east to pos33 (pushtonongoal). Then from pos33, push east to pos34, etc., until reaching pos15. 

But I'm not sure. Given the time constraints, I'll provide a sample plan, but I'm aware it might be incorrect.
