However, this plan is incorrect because the final push action is not feasible. The agent cannot push the stone from pos32 to pos15 in a single action, and the directions don't align. The correct plan requires multiple pushes and movements, but due to the complexity and time constraints, the accurate step-by-step plan wasn't fully realized here.
