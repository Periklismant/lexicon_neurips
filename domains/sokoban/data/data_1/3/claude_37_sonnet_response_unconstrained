Let's understand the problem.

We have a 5x5 grid (from pos11 to pos55). On this grid we have an agent (player1) located at pos55 and a stone (stone1) located at pos32. The goal is to move the stone to a goal location, which is pos15.

Actions available:
1. move p l_from l_to d: Move agent from one location to another.
2. pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d: Push stone from its current location to a goal location.
3. pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d: Push stone from its current location to a non-goal location.

Let's first visualize the grid:

(1,1)(1,2)(1,3)(1,4)(1,5G)
(2,1)(2,2)(2,3)(2,4)(2,5)
(3,1)(3,2S)(3,3)(3,4)(3,5)
(4,1)(4,2)(4,3)(4,4)(4,5)
(5,1)(5,2)(5,3)(5,4)(5,5P)

Where:
G: Goal location (pos15)
S: Stone location (pos32)
P: Player location (pos55)

Our goal is to get the stone to the goal location (pos15). 

To do this, the player will need to:
1. Move from pos55 to a position adjacent to the stone (pos32).
2. Push the stone towards the goal position (pos15).

Let's plan the movement of the player:
- From pos55 to pos45 (using move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft)
- From pos45 to pos35 (using move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft)
- From pos35 to pos34 (using move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup)
- From pos34 to pos33 (using move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup)
- From pos33 to pos32 (using move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup)

Oops, the stone is at pos32, so the player can't move there directly. The player needs to move beside the stone and then push it. Let me redo this:

- From pos55 to pos45 (using move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft)
- From pos45 to pos35 (using move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft)
- From pos35 to pos34 (using move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup)
- From pos34 to pos33 (using move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup)

Now the player is at pos33, and the stone is at pos32, which is above the player in the grid. The player needs to push the stone towards the goal (pos15).

Wait, the push action needs to be from a position behind the stone in the direction of the push. So the player needs to be at a position where, when moving in direction d, they would push the stone. 

Looking at the problem statement, the push action works differently than I initially thought. The player needs to be in a position l_p, the stone at position l_from, and the stone will be pushed to position l_to in direction d. The constraint is that you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d, and from l_from to l_to following direction d.

So, for the player to push the stone, the player needs to be in a position where, by moving in direction d, they would reach the stone's position, and by continuing in direction d from the stone, they would reach the target position.

For example, if the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos32, the player can push the stone by moving in the 'dirup' direction, which would move the stone from pos32 to pos31. The conditions are:
- You can move from pos33 to pos32 following direction dirup.
- You can move from pos32 to pos31 following direction dirup.

Let's plan again. The stone is at pos32 and the goal is at pos15. 

To get the stone to pos15, a path would be: 
pos32 -> pos22 -> pos12 -> pos13 -> pos14 -> pos15

For each step in this path, the player needs to be behind the stone in the direction of the push. Let me trace the path and the required player positions:

1. Stone at pos32, push to pos22 (move left): Player needs to be at pos42 (to the right of the stone).
2. Stone at pos22, push to pos12 (move left): Player needs to be at pos32 (to the right of the stone).
3. Stone at pos12, push to pos13 (move down): Player needs to be at pos11 (above the stone).
4. Stone at pos13, push to pos14 (move down): Player needs to be at pos12 (above the stone).
5. Stone at pos14, push to pos15 (move down): Player needs to be at pos13 (above the stone).

Wait, I think the grid directions are different from what I thought. Let's clarify:

From the action preconditions, it seems like:
- dirright means moving to a location with a higher first coordinate.
- dirleft means moving to a location with a lower first coordinate.
- dirdown means moving to a location with a higher second coordinate.
- dirup means moving to a location with a lower second coordinate.

Let's redo the grid visualization:

(1,1)(1,2)(1,3)(1,4)(1,5G)
(2,1)(2,2)(2,3)(2,4)(2,5)
(3,1)(3,2S)(3,3)(3,4)(3,5)
(4,1)(4,2)(4,3)(4,4)(4,5)
(5,1)(5,2)(5,3)(5,4)(5,5P)

Wait, I'm not confident about this. Let me double-check using the "You may move from location ..." predicates.

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

This suggests that dirright increases the first coordinate (e.g., from pos11 to pos21), and dirdown increases the second coordinate (e.g., from pos11 to pos12). This aligns with the standard interpretation of the grid.

So let's reinterpret:

```
dirright: Move from posXY to pos(X+1)Y
dirleft: Move from posXY to pos(X-1)Y
dirdown: Move from posXY to posX(Y+1)
dirup: Move from posXY to posX(Y-1)
```

Using this interpretation, let's update the grid:

```
     1    2    3    4    5
   -------------------------
1 | 1,1  1,2  1,3  1,4  1,5G
2 | 2,1  2,2  2,3  2,4  2,5
3 | 3,1  3,2S 3,3  3,4  3,5
4 | 4,1  4,2  4,3  4,4  4,5
5 | 5,1  5,2  5,3  5,4  5,5P
```

So the player is at the bottom-right, the stone is in the middle, and the goal is at the top-right.

To get the stone to the goal, a possible path is: 
pos32 -> pos22 -> pos12 -> pos13 -> pos14 -> pos15

For each of these pushes, let's determine the required player position:

1. Stone at pos32, push to pos22 (move left): Player needs to be at pos42 (to the right of the stone).
2. Stone at pos22, push to pos12 (move left): Player needs to be at pos32 (to the right of the stone).
3. Stone at pos12, push to pos13 (move down): Player needs to be at pos11 (above the stone).
4. Stone at pos13, push to pos14 (move down): Player needs to be at pos12 (above the stone).
5. Stone at pos14, push to pos15 (move down): Player needs to be at pos13 (above the stone).

Let's double-check if this path would work:

- For the first push, the player needs to be at pos42 to push the stone from pos32 to pos22 in direction dirleft.
- For the second push, the player needs to be at pos32 to push the stone from pos22 to pos12 in direction dirleft.
- For the third push, the player needs to be at pos11 to push the stone from pos12 to pos13 in direction dirdown.
- For the fourth push, the player needs to be at pos12 to push the stone from pos13 to pos14 in direction dirdown.
- For the fifth push, the player needs to be at pos13 to push the stone from pos14 to pos15 in direction dirdown.

This still looks wrong. Let me revisit the grid system and be more careful.

Alright, I'm going to deduce the positions from the predicates given.

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
This suggests that moving to the right from pos11 gets you to pos21.

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"
This suggests that moving down from pos11 gets you to pos12.

Let's interpret posXY as a (X,Y) coordinate where X is the row and Y is the column. So, for example, pos32 would be the position at row 3, column 2.

Using this interpretation:

dirright: Move from posXY to pos(X+1)Y (increase row)
dirleft: Move from posXY to pos(X-1)Y (decrease row)
dirdown: Move from posXY to posX(Y+1) (increase column)
dirup: Move from posXY to posX(Y-1) (decrease column)

Let's update the grid visualization:

```
     1    2    3    4    5
   -------------------------
1 | 1,1  1,2  1,3  1,4  1,5G
   |     |     |     |     |
2 | 2,1  2,2  2,3  2,4  2,5
   |     |     |     |     |
3 | 3,1  3,2S 3,3  3,4  3,5
   |     |     |     |     |
4 | 4,1  4,2  4,3  4,4  4,5
   |     |     |     |     |
5 | 5,1  5,2  5,3  5,4  5,5P
```

Using this interpretation, the player is at position (5,5), the stone is at position (3,2), and the goal is at position (1,5).

To get the stone to the goal, a path could be: 
(3,2) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (1,5)

Translated to the position names:
pos32 -> pos22 -> pos12 -> pos13 -> pos14 -> pos15

For each of these pushes, let's determine the required player position:

1. Stone at pos32, push to pos22 (dirleft): Player needs to be at pos42.
2. Stone at pos22, push to pos12 (dirleft): Player needs to be at pos32.
3. Stone at pos12, push to pos13 (dirdown): Player needs to be at pos11.
4. Stone at pos13, push to pos14 (dirdown): Player needs to be at pos12.
5. Stone at pos14, push to pos15 (dirdown): Player needs to be at pos13.

Starting from player position pos55, let's navigate to pos42:
pos55 -> pos45 -> pos35 -> pos25 -> (pos24 -> pos23 -> pos22 ->) pos32 -> pos42

From there, the player can push the stone using pushtonongoal or pushtogoal, based on whether the target location is a goal location.

So, the sequence of actions would be:

1. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft
2. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft
3. move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft
4. move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
5. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
6. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
7. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright
8. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright
9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft (stone is now at pos22)
10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft (stone is now at pos12, player at pos22)
11. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
12. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft (player is now at pos11)
13. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown (stone is now at pos13, player at pos12)
14. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirdown (stone is now at pos14, player at pos13)
15. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown (stone is now at pos15, which is a goal location)

Wait, let me double-check if I've understood the push actions correctly:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is a goal location.

Let's use a specific example to check:
"pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft"

For this, 
- player1 is at pos42,
- stone1 is at pos32,
- target position pos22 is clear,
- You can move from pos42 to pos32 following dirleft,
- You can move from pos32 to pos22 following dirleft,
- pos22 is not a goal location.

This seems correct.

Let me double-check the rest of the plan:

```
1. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft
2. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft
3. move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft
4. move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
5. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
6. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
7. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright
8. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright
9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft (stone is now at pos22, player at pos32)
10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft (stone is now at pos12, player at pos22)
11. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
12. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft (player is now at pos11)
13. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown (stone is now at pos13, player at pos12)
14. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirdown (stone is now at pos14, player at pos13)
15. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown (stone is now at pos15, which is a goal location)
```

Let me track the positions more carefully:

1. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft: Player at pos45.
2. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft: Player at pos35.
3. move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft: Player at pos25.
4. move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup: Player at pos24.
5. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup: Player at pos23.
6. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup: Player at pos22.
7. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright: Player at pos32, which is the stone's position!

Hmm, so player1 can't be at the same position as the stone. Let me redo the planning.

Here, I'll first carefully track the current state:
- player1 is at pos55.
- stone1 is at pos32.
- Goal location is pos15.

The player needs to get to a position where they can push the stone towards the goal. Let's replan. One path to get the stone to the goal is:
pos32 -> pos22 -> pos12 -> pos13 -> pos14 -> pos15

To initiate the first push (pos32 -> pos22), the player needs to be at position pos42, because moving from pos42 in the direction dirleft would bring the player to the stone's position pos32, and continuing in that direction would push the stone to pos22.

Let's navigate the player from pos55 to pos42:
pos55 -> pos54 -> pos53 -> pos52 -> pos42

1. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup: Player at pos54.
2. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup: Player at pos53.
3. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup: Player at pos52.
4. move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft: Player at pos42.

Now the player is at pos42 and can push the stone from pos32 to pos22 using pushtonongoal.

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft: 
   - stone1 at pos22, 
   - player1 at pos32.

To push the stone from pos22 to pos12, the player needs to be at pos32 (which they already are):

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft: 
   - stone1 at pos12, 
   - player1 at pos22.

To push the stone from pos12 to pos13, the player needs to be at pos11 (above the stone). Let's navigate the player to pos11:
pos22 -> pos21 -> pos11

7. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup: Player at pos21.
8. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft: Player at pos11.

Now the player can push the stone from pos12 to pos13:

9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown: 
   - stone1 at pos13, 
   - player1 at pos12.

To push the stone from pos13 to pos14, the player needs to be at pos12 (which they already are):

10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirdown: 
    - stone1 at pos14, 
    - player1 at pos13.

Finally, to push the stone from pos14 to pos15 (the goal location), the player needs to be at pos13 (which they already are):

11. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown: 
    - stone1 at pos15 (a goal location), 
    - player1 at pos14.

Let me sanity-check this plan by visualizing the positions after each step:

1. Before any move: player1 at pos55, stone1 at pos32.
2. After move #1: player1 at pos54, stone1 at pos32.
3. After move #2: player1 at pos53, stone1 at pos32.
4. After move #3: player1 at pos52, stone1 at pos32.
5. After move #4: player1 at pos42, stone1 at pos32.
6. After push #5: player1 at pos32, stone1 at pos22.
7. After push #6: player1 at pos22, stone1 at pos12.
8. After move #7: player1 at pos21, stone1 at pos12.
9. After move #8: player1 at pos11, stone1 at pos12.
10. After push #9: player1 at pos12, stone1 at pos13.
11. After push #10: player1 at pos13, stone1 at pos14.
12. After push #11: player1 at pos14, stone1 at pos15 (goal).

After these steps, the stone is at the goal location. So this plan achieves the desired goal. 

Let's review the plan once more to make sure all the actions are valid according to the given rules:

1. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup: Valid because player1 is at pos55 and pos54 is clear.
2. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup: Valid because player1 will be at pos54 after the previous step, and pos53 is clear.
3. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup: Valid because player1 will be at pos53 after the previous step, and pos52 is clear.
4. move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft: Valid because player1 will be at pos52 after the previous step, and pos42 is clear.
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft: Valid because player1 will be at pos42, stone1 is at pos32, pos22 is clear, and one can move from pos42 to pos32 and from pos32 to pos22 following dirleft. pos22 is not a goal location.
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft: Valid because player1 will be at pos32 after the previous step, stone1 will be at pos22, pos12 is clear, and one can move from pos32 to pos22 and from pos22 to pos12 following dirleft. pos12 is not a goal location.
7. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup: Valid because player1 will be at pos22 after the previous step, and pos21 is clear.
8. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft: Valid because player1 will be at pos21 after the previous step, and pos11 is clear.
9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown: Valid because player1 will be at pos11, stone1 will be at pos12, pos13 is clear, and one can move from pos11 to pos12 and from pos12 to pos13 following dirdown. pos13 is not a goal location.
10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirdown: Valid because player1 will be at pos12 after the previous step, stone1 will be at pos13, pos14 is clear, and one can move from pos12 to pos13 and from pos13 to pos14 following dirdown. pos14 is not a goal location.
11. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown: Valid because player1 will be at pos13 after the previous step, stone1 will be at pos14, pos15 is clear, and one can move from pos13 to pos14 and from pos14 to pos15 following dirdown. pos15 is a goal location.

All steps in the plan seem valid.

Let me ensure that this is an optimal plan. The goal is to get the stone to the goal location, which is pos15. The shortest path from pos32 to pos15 would be:
pos32 -> pos22 -> pos12 -> pos13 -> pos14 -> pos15

This requires 5 pushes, which is the minimum number of pushes required. To execute these 5 pushes, the player needs to be at specific positions. The most efficient way to navigate to these positions is what we've planned. 

Thus, the given plan is optimal for this problem.

Let me summarize the plan in the required format:

1. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
2. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
3. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup
4. move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft
7. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
8. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown
10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirdown
11. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown
