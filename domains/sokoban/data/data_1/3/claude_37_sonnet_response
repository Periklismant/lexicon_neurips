In this problem we need to push the stone to the goal location at pos15. Let's analyze the state of the world:

1. We have a 5x5 grid.
2. The player (player1) is at position pos55 (bottom right corner).
3. There is one stone (stone1) at position pos32.
4. The goal location is at pos15 (top right corner).

We need to push the stone to the goal location. Let's think about the constraints:
1. "Location pos15 is not clear" must be true in at least one state. This means either the player or the stone must be at pos15 at some point.
2. If "Location pos15 is not clear" holds, then "player1 is at location pos41" must hold at that state or some state after. This means after the stone or player is at pos15, the player must be at pos41 at some point.

Now, let me think about how to move the stone from pos32 to pos15:

1. First, the player needs to get to a position where they can push the stone.
2. Then, the player needs to push the stone toward pos15.
3. After the stone is at pos15, the player needs to move to pos41 to satisfy the second constraint.

Let's plan the path:

Starting positions:
- The player is at pos55 (bottom right corner).
- The stone is at pos32 (middle left area).
- The goal is at pos15 (top right corner).

To push the stone, the player must be positioned adjacent to the stone in the direction opposite to the push direction. Let's see how we can get to pos32 and then push the stone toward pos15:

1. Player at pos55, stone at pos32.
2. Player moves to pos45 (left of pos55).
3. Player moves to pos35 (above pos45).
4. Player moves to pos34 (left of pos35).
5. Player moves to pos33 (left of pos34).
6. Player moves to pos23 (above pos33).
7. Player moves to pos22 (left of pos23).

Now the player is at pos22. To push the stone from pos32 to pos15, we need to:
1. Move the player to pos22 (above pos32).
2. Push the stone up to pos22.
3. Push the stone left to pos12.
4. Push the stone up to pos11.
5. Push the stone right to pos12.
6. Push the stone right to pos13.
7. Push the stone right to pos14.
8. Push the stone right to pos15 (goal).

After the stone is at pos15, the player must move to pos41. Let's plan this path:
1. Player is at pos14.
2. Player moves to pos24 (down from pos14).
3. Player moves to pos34 (down from pos24).
4. Player moves to pos44 (down from pos34).
5. Player moves to pos43 (left from pos44).
6. Player moves to pos42 (left from pos43).
7. Player moves to pos41 (left from pos42).

Now, let's implement this plan using the provided actions:

Wait, I think there's a flaw in my reasoning. I can't push the stone up to pos22 directly from pos32 because I first need to get to a position below the stone (pos42) to push it up.

Let me rethink this:

Starting positions:
- Player at pos55 (bottom right corner).
- Stone at pos32 (middle left area).
- Goal at pos15 (top right corner).

To get from the stone at pos32 to the goal at pos15, we need to plan a path.

1. First, we need to position the player so that they can push the stone in the appropriate direction.
2. I need to think about the sequence of pushes to get the stone to pos15 from pos32.

From pos32 to pos15, a possible path for the stone could be: pos32 -> pos33 -> pos34 -> pos35 -> pos25 -> pos15.

So we would need to push the stone to the right three times, then up, then left.

To push the stone to the right, the player needs to be to the left of the stone. To push the stone up, the player needs to be below the stone. To push the stone to the left, the player needs to be to the right of the stone.

Let's try again:

1. Player at pos55, stone at pos32.
2. Player moves to pos45, pos35, pos34, pos33, pos23, pos22, pos21, pos31. Now player is at pos31, which is to the left of the stone.
3. Push stone from pos32 to pos33. Player is now at pos32.
4. Player need to be at pos23, so move player from pos32 to pos33, pos23.
5. Player moves to pos22, pos21, pos31. Now player is at pos31, which is to the left of the stone at pos33.
6. Push stone from pos33 to pos34. Player is now at pos33.
7. Player need to be at pos24, so move player from pos33 to pos34, pos24.
8. Player moves to pos23, pos22, pos21, pos31, pos32. Now player is at pos32, which is to the left of the stone at pos34.
9. Push stone from pos34 to pos35. Player is now at pos34.
10. Player need to be at pos45, so move player from pos34 to pos35, pos45.
11. Player moves to pos44, pos43, pos33, pos34. Now player is at pos34, which is below the stone at pos35.
12. Push stone from pos35 to pos25. Player is now at pos35.
13. Player need to be at pos26, so move player from pos35 to pos25, pos35, pos45, pos55, pos54, pos53, pos43, pos33, pos23, pos24, pos25, pos35. Now player is at pos35, which is to the right of the stone at pos25.
14. Push stone from pos25 to pos15. Player is now at pos25.
15. Player moves to pos35, pos45, pos44, pos43, pos42, pos41. Now player is at pos41.

However, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me rethink this with a clearer path.

From pos32, a direct path to pos15 would be: pos32 -> pos22 -> pos12 -> pos13 -> pos14 -> pos15.

1. Player at pos55, stone at pos32.
2. Player moves to pos45, pos35, pos34, pos33, pos32 (where the stone is). Wait, this doesn't work because the stone is at pos32. Let me rethink.

Actually, let me represent the grid to better understand the problem:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1 [ ][ ][ ][ ][G]
2 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
3 [ ][S][ ][ ][ ]
4 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
5 [ ][ ][ ][ ][P]
```

Where:
- S is the stone at pos32.
- P is the player at pos55.
- G is the goal at pos15.

So I need to push the stone from pos32 to pos15.

Since the stone needs to go up and to the right, one path could be: 
pos32 -> pos31 -> pos21 -> pos11 -> pos12 -> pos13 -> pos14 -> pos15.

Or another path could be: 
pos32 -> pos22 -> pos12 -> pos13 -> pos14 -> pos15.

Let's go with the second path as it seems shorter.

Actually, I need to carefully check the action definitions. For the pushtogoal and pushtonongoal actions, the player needs to be adjacent to the stone, and the stone needs to be adjacent to the target location. Let's be a bit more careful:

1. Player at pos55, stone at pos32.
2. Player moves to pos45, pos35, pos34, pos33, pos32 (where the stone is). No, I can't move to pos32 because the stone is there.

Let me rethink:

1. Player at pos55, stone at pos32.
2. Player moves to pos45, pos35, pos34, pos33, pos23. Now player is above the stone.
3. Push stone from pos32 to pos22. Player is now at pos32, stone at pos22.
4. Player moves to pos31, pos21. Now player is to the left of the stone.
5. Push stone from pos22 to pos12. Player is now at pos22, stone at pos12.
6. Player moves to pos21, pos11. Now player is to the left of the stone.
7. Push stone from pos12 to pos13. Player is now at pos12, stone at pos13.
8. Player moves to pos11, then pos12. Now player is to the left of the stone.
9. Push stone from pos13 to pos14. Player is now at pos13, stone at pos14.
10. Player moves to pos12, then pos13. Now player is to the left of the stone.
11. Push stone from pos14 to pos15. Player is now at pos14, stone at pos15 (goal).

Now, after the stone is at pos15, the player needs to move to pos41:

12. Player moves from pos14 to pos24, pos34, pos44, pos43, pos42, pos41.

Let's verify the path against the actions and preconditions:

Wait, I need to be careful about the directions. Let me clarify the coordinate system. It seems like the first number is the x-coordinate (horizontal) and the second number is the y-coordinate (vertical). So, positions are (x, y) where x increases as we move right and y increases as we move down.

In this case, the directions are:
- dirup: Decreases the y-coordinate (move up).
- dirdown: Increases the y-coordinate (move down).
- dirleft: Decreases the x-coordinate (move left).
- dirright: Increases the x-coordinate (move right).

So, to revise the plan:

1. The player is at pos55, the stone is at pos32.
2. The player needs to move to a position adjacent to the stone to push it.
3. From the stone's position pos32, a path to the goal pos15 could be: pos32 -> pos22 -> pos12 -> pos13 -> pos14 -> pos15.

Let's replan the player's movement:

1. The player starts at pos55.
2. The player moves to pos45 using dirleft.
3. The player moves to pos35 using dirup.
4. The player moves to pos34 using dirleft.
5. The player moves to pos33 using dirleft.
6. The player moves to pos23 using dirup.
7. The player moves to pos22 using dirleft.
8. The player moves to pos21 using dirleft.
9. The player moves to pos31 using dirdown.
10. The player moves to pos32 using dirright.
11. The player moves to pos42 using dirdown.

Now, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32. The player can push the stone up.

12. Push the stone from pos32 to pos22. Now the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos22.
13. Player moves to pos31 using dirleft.
14. Player moves to pos21 using dirup.
15. Player moves to pos11 using dirleft.
16. Player moves to pos12 using dirright.
17. Player moves to pos22 using dirdown.
18. Player moves to pos32 using dirdown.

Now, the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos22. The player can push the stone left.

19. Push the stone from pos22 to pos12. Now the player is at pos22 and the stone is at pos12.
20. Player moves to pos21 using dirleft.
21. Player moves to pos11 using dirup.
22. Player moves to pos12 using dirright.
23. Player moves to pos13 using dirright.

Now, the player is at pos13 and the stone is at pos12. The player can push the stone right.

24. Push the stone from pos12 to pos13. Now the player is at pos12 and the stone is at pos13.
25. Player moves to pos13 using dirright.
26. Player moves to pos14 using dirright.

Now, the player is at pos14 and the stone is at pos13. The player can push the stone right.

27. Push the stone from pos13 to pos14. Now the player is at pos13 and the stone is at pos14.
28. Player moves to pos14 using dirright.
29. Player moves to pos15 using dirright.

Now, the player is at pos15 and the stone is at pos14. The player can push the stone right.

30. Push the stone from pos14 to pos15. Now the player is at pos14 and the stone is at pos15 (goal).

Now, after the stone is at pos15, the player needs to move to pos41:

31. Player moves from pos14 to pos24 using dirdown.
32. Player moves from pos24 to pos34 using dirdown.
33. Player moves from pos34 to pos44 using dirdown.
34. Player moves from pos44 to pos43 using dirleft.
35. Player moves from pos43 to pos42 using dirleft.
36. Player moves from pos42 to pos41 using dirleft.

Now, the player is at pos41, which satisfies the constraint.

Let's double-check the sequence:

Wait, I need to correct my thinking. If the player wants to push the stone from pos32 to pos22, the player needs to be at pos42, not at pos32. The player is positioned behind the stone in the direction of push.

Let me rethink the position of the player relative to the stone:

If the stone is at pos32 and we want to push it up to pos22, the player must be at pos42.
If the stone is at pos22 and we want to push it left to pos12, the player must be at pos32.
If the stone is at pos12 and we want to push it right to pos13, the player must be at pos11.
If the stone is at pos13 and we want to push it right to pos14, the player must be at pos12.
If the stone is at pos14 and we want to push it right to pos15, the player must be at pos13.

Let's replan:

1. The player starts at pos55.
2. The player moves to pos45 using move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft.
3. The player moves to pos35 using move player1 pos45 pos35 dirup.
4. The player moves to pos34 using move player1 pos35 pos34 dirleft.
5. The player moves to pos33 using move player1 pos34 pos33 dirleft.
6. The player moves to pos43 using move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown.
7. The player moves to pos42 using move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft.

Now, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32. The player can push the stone up.

8. Push the stone from pos32 to pos22 using pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup.

Now the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos22.

9. Player moves to pos31 using move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft.
10. Player moves to pos41 using move player1 pos31 pos41 dirdown.
11. Player moves to pos42 using move player1 pos41 pos42 dirright.
12. Player moves to pos43 using move player1 pos42 pos43 dirright.
13. Player moves to pos33 using move player1 pos43 pos33 dirup.
14. Player moves to pos23 using move player1 pos33 pos23 dirup.
15. Player moves to pos13 using move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft.
16. Player moves to pos12 using move player1 pos13 pos12 dirleft.
17. Player moves to pos11 using move player1 pos12 pos11 dirleft.
18. Player moves to pos21 using move player1 pos11 pos21 dirdown.
19. Player moves to pos31 using move player1 pos21 pos31 dirdown.
20. Player moves to pos32 using move player1 pos31 pos32 dirright.

Now, the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos22. The player can push the stone left.

21. Push the stone from pos22 to pos12 using pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft.

Now the player is at pos22 and the stone is at pos12.

Hmm, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me break it down step by step again and make sure each move is valid.

First, I need to position the player so they can push the stone towards the goal. The stone starts at pos32 and the goal is at pos15. Let's plan a path for the stone.

From pos32 to pos15, a possible path could be: pos32 -> pos22 -> pos12 -> pos13 -> pos14 -> pos15.

To push the stone from pos32 to pos22, the player must be at pos42.
To push the stone from pos22 to pos12, the player must be at pos32.
To push the stone from pos12 to pos13, the player must be at pos11.
To push the stone from pos13 to pos14, the player must be at pos12.
To push the stone from pos14 to pos15, the player must be at pos13.

Let's replan:

1. The player starts at pos55.
2. The player moves to pos45 using move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft.
3. The player moves to pos35 using move player1 pos45 pos35 dirup.
4. The player moves to pos34 using move player1 pos35 pos34 dirleft.
5. The player moves to pos33 using move player1 pos34 pos33 dirleft.
6. The player moves to pos43 using move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown.
7. The player moves to pos42 using move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft.

Now, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32. The player can push the stone up.

8. Push the stone from pos32 to pos22 using pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup.

Now the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos22.

9. Push the stone from pos22 to pos12 using pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft.

Now the player is at pos22 and the stone is at pos12.

10. Player moves to pos21 using move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft.
11. Player moves to pos11 using move player1 pos21 pos11 dirup.

Now, the player is at pos11 and the stone is at pos12. The player can push the stone right.

12. Push the stone from pos12 to pos13 using pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirright.

Now the player is at pos12 and the stone is at pos13.

13. Push the stone from pos13 to pos14 using pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirright.

Now the player is at pos13 and the stone is at pos14.

14. Push the stone from pos14 to pos15 using pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirright.

Now the player is at pos14 and the stone is at pos15 (goal). The constraint "Location pos15 is not clear" is now satisfied. 

Next, we need to move the player to pos41 to satisfy the other constraint.

15. Player moves from pos14 to pos24 using move player1 pos14 pos24 dirdown.
16. Player moves from pos24 to pos34 using move player1 pos24 pos34 dirdown.
17. Player moves from pos34 to pos44 using move player1 pos34 pos44 dirdown.
18. Player moves from pos44 to pos43 using move player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft.
19. Player moves from pos43 to pos42 using move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft.
20. Player moves from pos42 to pos41 using move player1 pos42 pos41 dirleft.

Now, the player is at pos41, which satisfies the second constraint.

Let's verify the plan:
1. Starting: player1 at pos55, stone1 at pos32.
2. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft
3. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirup
4. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirleft
5. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirleft
6. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown
7. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup
9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft
10. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft
11. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirup
12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirright
13. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirright
14. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirright
15. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirdown
16. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirdown
17. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirdown
18. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft
19. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft
20. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirleft

I notice a potential issue with step 9. Looking at the preconditions for the pushtonongoal action, it says "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d." In this case, l_p is pos32, l_from is pos22, and d is dirleft. That means we should be able to go from pos32 to pos22 following dirleft. But typically, if we're at pos32 and move left, we'd go to pos31, not pos22.

Let me double-check the connectivity of the grid:

The precondition says "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d," but I'm suspicious. Let me check the actual connectivity that's given in the original state:

```
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"
```

That means from pos11, if we go right, we reach pos21. And if we go down from pos11, we reach pos12. This is different from my understanding. It seems like the first number represents the row and the second number represents the column. Let's redo the grid representation:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1 [ ][ ][ ][ ][G]
2 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
3 [ ][S][ ][ ][ ]
4 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
5 [ ][ ][ ][ ][P]
```

Where:
- S is the stone at pos32 (3rd row, 2nd column).
- P is the player at pos55 (5th row, 5th column).
- G is the goal at pos15 (1st row, 5th column).

So, the directions now make sense:
- dirup: Decreases the row (move up).
- dirdown: Increases the row (move down).
- dirleft: Decreases the column (move left).
- dirright: Increases the column (move right).

Let me rethink the problem.

To push the stone from pos32 to the goal pos15, I need to rethink the path. A possible path could be: pos32 -> pos22 (up) -> pos12 (up) -> pos13 (right) -> pos14 (right) -> pos15 (right).

To push the stone from pos32 to pos22, the player must be below the stone, which is at pos42.
To push the stone from pos22 to pos12, the player must be below the stone, which is at pos32.
To push the stone from pos12 to pos13, the player must be to the left of the stone, which is at pos11.
To push the stone from pos13 to pos14, the player must be to the left of the stone, which is at pos12.
To push the stone from pos14 to pos15, the player must be to the left of the stone, which is at pos13.

Let's replan:

Starting: player1 at pos55, stone1 at pos32.

1. The player needs to go from pos55 to pos42 (to be below the stone at pos32).
2. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft
3. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirup
4. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirleft
5. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirleft
6. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown
7. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft

Now, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32. The player pushes the stone up.

8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup

Now the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos22. The player pushes the stone up again.

9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirup

Now the player is at pos22 and the stone is at pos12.

10. The player needs to go to pos11 to push the stone to the right.
11. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirup
12. move player1 pos12 pos11 dirleft

Now, the player is at pos11 and the stone is at pos12. The player pushes the stone right.

13. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirright

Now the player is at pos12 and the stone is at pos13. The player pushes the stone right again.

14. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirright

Now the player is at pos13 and the stone is at pos14. The player pushes the stone right once more to the goal.

15. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirright

Now the player is at pos14 and the stone is at pos15 (goal). The constraint "Location pos15 is not clear" is now satisfied.

Next, we need to move the player to pos41 to satisfy the other constraint.

16. Player needs to go from pos14 to pos41.
17. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirdown
18. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirdown
19. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirdown
20. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft
21. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft
22. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirleft

Now, the player is at pos41, which satisfies the second constraint.

Final plan:
1. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft
2. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirup
3. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirleft
4. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirleft
5. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown
6. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft
7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirup
9. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirup
10. move player1 pos12 pos11 dirleft
11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirright
12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirright
13. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirright
14. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirdown
15. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirdown
16. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirdown
17. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft
18. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft
19. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirleft

Actually, I noticed a flaw. After the pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirup action, the player is at pos22, not pos32. Let me replan:

Starting: player1 at pos55, stone1 at pos32.

1. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft
2. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirup
3. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirleft
4. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirleft
5. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown
6. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft
7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup

Now the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos22.

8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirup

Now the player is at pos22 and the stone is at pos12.

9. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft
10. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirup

Now, the player is at pos11 and the stone is at pos12.

    - player1 is at pos41
    - pos42 is clear

Now, the player is at pos41, which satisfies the second constraint.

All the preconditions and effects align, so our plan should be valid. The optimal plan for the problem is:

1. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft
2. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirup
3. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirleft
4. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirleft
5. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown
