Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. From the initial state, I see that stone1 is at pos32, which is not a goal. The only goal location mentioned is pos15. So the plan must move stone1 from pos32 to pos15.

But wait, the constraints add some complexity. The first constraint requires that at least one state has pos15 not clear. Since pos15 is a goal location, and initially it's clear, once we move stone1 there, pos15 will not be clear. So that's probably when the constraint is satisfied. The second constraint says that if pos15 is not clear in some state s, then the player must be at pos41 either in s or a later state. So after moving stone1 to pos15, the agent (player1) needs to eventually reach pos41.

Let me outline the steps. First, the agent needs to move from pos55 to somewhere near pos32. Then push the stone towards pos15. Let's see the possible paths.

The agent starts at pos55. To reach pos32, which is in row 3, column 2. Let's see the grid layout. The positions are like posXY where X is row (1-5) and Y is column (1-5). So pos55 is bottom-right corner. pos32 is row3, column2.

From pos55, the agent can move left to pos54 (direction dirleft), then up to pos44 (dirup), then left to pos43, then up to pos33? Wait, let's check the allowed moves.

Looking at the movement possibilities for pos55: the agent can move left to pos54 (dirleft) or up to pos45 (dirup). Wait, according to the movement rules provided, "You may move from location pos55 to location pos45 following direction dirleft". Wait, no: the movement from pos55 is:

"You may move from location pos55 to location pos45 following direction dirleft" (since pos45 is to the left of pos55 in the same row?) Wait, maybe the directions are a bit confusing. Let me parse the movement directions again.

Wait, the movement directions are defined as possible transitions. For example, "You may move from location pos55 to location pos45 following direction dirleft". So moving left from pos55 (which is row5, column5) would go to pos45 (row4, column5)? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the locations are structured such that moving down increases the row number. For example, pos11 is top-left, pos51 is bottom-left, pos15 is top-right, pos55 is bottom-right. So movement directions:

- dirright: move to the next column (right), same row.
- dirleft: move to the previous column (left), same row.
- dirup: move to previous row (up), same column.
- dirdown: move to next row (down), same column.

Wait, but some movement entries might indicate that. For example, moving from pos11 to pos21 following dirright. Wait, pos11 is row1, column1. pos21 is row2, column1. So moving down (dirdown) would be row+1. But according to that example, moving from pos11 to pos21 is dirright. That doesn't fit. Wait, maybe the direction names are misleading. Let me check the movement entries again.

Looking at the movement list:

- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright": So from pos11, moving dirright takes you to pos21. But pos21 is row2, column1. So that's moving down a row, same column. So perhaps dirright here actually means moving down. Or maybe the direction names are mixed up. This is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the grid is structured such that moving dirright is east (same row, column+1), dirleft is west, dirup is north (row-1), dirdown is south (row+1). But some of the movement entries don't fit. For example, from pos11 to pos21 (row2, column1) is dirright. That would mean moving down (row+1, same column). So perhaps dirright is actually south (dirdown), but that's conflicting. This is a problem. The directions must be correctly interpreted based on the given movement possibilities.

Wait, the movement from pos11 to pos21 is dirright. But pos11 to pos12 is dirdown. Wait, pos11 (row1, column1) to pos12 (row1, column2) would be moving right (east), which should be direction dirright. But according to the given data, moving from pos11 to pos12 is direction dirdown. That's inconsistent. So maybe the grid is structured with rows as columns and vice versa. Alternatively, perhaps the movement directions are mislabeled. This is a critical point because the directions affect how the agent can move.

Alternatively, maybe the first index is column and the second is row. Let's see: pos11 is column1, row1; pos12 is column1, row2. But then moving from pos11 to pos21 would be column2, row1, which would be to the right. But the direction for that movement is dirright, which would make sense. But then moving from pos11 to pos12 (same column, row+1) is dirdown, which would make sense. So maybe the positions are labeled as posXY where X is the column and Y is the row. So pos11 is column1, row1. pos12 is column1, row2. pos21 is column2, row1. Then moving dirright would increase column (move east), dirleft decrease column (west), dirdown increase row (south), dirup decrease row (north). This would align with the given movement directions.

For example:

- pos11 (col1, row1) to pos21 (col2, row1) via dirright (correct).
- pos11 to pos12 (col1, row2) via dirdown (row increases by 1, correct).
- pos12 (col1, row2) to pos22 (col2, row2) via dirright (correct).

So under this interpretation, posXY is column X, row Y. Then, moving dirright increases column, dirdown increases row. So directions are:

- dirright: column+1 (east)
- dirleft: column-1 (west)
- dirup: row-1 (north)
- dirdown: row+1 (south)

This makes sense with the given movement entries. For example, moving from pos55 (column5, row5) to pos45 (column4, row5) via dirleft (column decreases by 1). Yes, that makes sense. So now the grid is structured with columns as the first index and rows as the second. So pos32 is column3, row2. The stone is at pos32. The goal location is pos15 (column1, row5). Wait, no. Wait, the goal location is pos15. According to the initial state, pos15 is a goal location. But under this interpretation, pos15 would be column1, row5. So in the grid, that's the bottom-left corner (if columns are vertical). Hmm. But the agent starts at pos55 (column5, row5), which is the bottom-right corner.

So, the stone is at pos32 (column3, row2). The goal is pos15 (column1, row5). So the agent needs to push the stone from pos32 to pos15. That's a long path. Let's map out the possible path.

First, the agent is at pos55 (col5, row5). To get to pos32 (col3, row2), the agent needs to move left (dirleft) to pos45 (col4, row5), then up (dirup) to pos44 (col4, row4), then up to pos43 (col4, row3), then left to pos33 (col3, row3), then up to pos32 (col3, row2). Wait, but can the agent move directly from pos44 to pos43? Let's check the movement possibilities.

Looking at the movement entries:

- From pos55, can move to pos45 (dirleft) or pos54 (dirup?) Wait, no. The movement from pos55 is:

"You may move from location pos55 to location pos45 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos55 to location pos54 following direction dirup"

Wait, if dirleft is decreasing column, then moving from pos55 (col5, row5) to pos45 (col4, row5) via dirleft. Then, moving up from pos55 would be row-1, so pos54 (col5, row4). So pos55 to pos54 is dirup (row decreases by 1). So, the agent's path from pos55 to pos32 would need to navigate through the grid.

Alternative path: pos55 → pos54 (dirup), then pos54 → pos44 (dirleft), then pos44 → pos43 (dirup?), let's check movement options for pos44:

From pos44, possible moves are:

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft" (col3, row4)
"You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright" (col5, row4)
"You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup" (col4, row3)
"You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown" (col4, row5)

So from pos44, moving dirup (row-1) takes the agent to pos43 (col4, row3). Then from pos43, the movement options include:

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft" (col3, row3)
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright" (col5, row3)
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup" (col4, row2)
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown" (col4, row4)

So from pos43, moving dirleft to pos33 (col3, row3). Then from pos33:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft" (col2, row3)
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright" (col4, row3)
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup" (col3, row2)
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown" (col3, row4)

Ah, so from pos33, moving dirup (row-1) to pos32 (col3, row2), which is where the stone is. So the agent can reach pos33, then go up to pos32. But wait, the stone is at pos32, so the agent can't move directly into that position unless pushing the stone. But the agent can move next to the stone to push it.

Wait, the stone is at pos32. So the agent needs to be adjacent to pos32 in a direction from which they can push. To push the stone, the agent must be at a location adjacent to the stone's current position in the direction opposite to the push direction.

For example, to push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (west), the agent would need to be at pos32 and then push west. Wait, no. Let me think about the pushing actions.

The "pushtogoal" and "pushtonongoal" actions require that the agent is at location l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's current position), and that l_to is adjacent to l_from in the same direction. So for example, if the agent is at pos22 (east of pos32?), no. Wait, let's clarify.

To push a stone from l_from (pos32) to l_to (say pos22) via direction dirleft (west), the agent must be at l_p (pos42?) Wait, no. Let me check the preconditions for pushtogoal:

For "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d", the agent must be at l_p, which must be adjacent to l_from in direction d. Then, l_from to l_to is also in direction d. So the direction d must be the same for moving from l_p to l_from and from l_from to l_to. So the agent is at l_p, moves in direction d to l_from (pushing the stone), which moves the stone in the same direction d to l_to.

So for example, if the stone is at pos32, and the agent is at pos42 (to the east of pos32?), then the direction would be dirleft (west) to move from pos42 to pos32, and then from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft again). Wait, but direction dirleft is west (column-1). So moving from pos42 (col4, row2) to pos32 (col3, row2) would be dirleft. Then pushing the stone from pos32 to pos22 (col2, row2) via dirleft. So the agent would be at pos32 after pushing, and the stone at pos22.

Wait, but the preconditions for pushtogoal require that the agent can move from l_p to l_from in direction d, and l_from to l_to in the same direction d. So in this example, l_p is pos42, l_from is pos32, l_to is pos22, and d is dirleft. So the agent is at pos42, moves dirleft to pos32 (pushing the stone), and the stone moves dirleft to pos22. So after the action, the agent is at pos32, and the stone is at pos22.

But in this case, the agent is now at pos32, which was the stone's original position. The stone is now at pos22. So to push the stone towards the goal pos15 (col1, row5), which is far away. Let's think of the path from pos32 to pos15.

The goal is pos15 (col1, row5). The stone is at pos32 (col3, row2). So the stone needs to move west (dirleft) to col1, and south (dirdown) to row5. So possible path: push the stone west to pos22, then pos21, then pos11, then down to pos15. Wait, but pos11 is not a goal. Wait, the only goal location is pos15. So the stone must end up at pos15.

So the path for the stone would be from pos32 (col3, row2) to pos22 (col2, row2) via dirleft, then to pos21 (col2, row1) via dirup (north?), but that's moving up (row decreases). Wait, no. To move south (row increases), the stone would need to be pushed down. Let's think again.

Wait, the stone is at pos32 (col3, row2). To get to pos15 (col1, row5), it needs to move west twice (col3→col2→col1) and south three times (row2→row3→row4→row5). So the path would be pushing west twice and south three times.

But the agent has to navigate to positions to push the stone in those directions. Let's plan the steps.

First, the agent needs to get to a position where they can push the stone. Starting from pos55 (col5, row5). Let's find the path to reach a position adjacent to pos32.

pos32 is at col3, row2. Adjacent positions are pos22 (west), pos42 (east), pos31 (north?), and pos33 (south?).

Wait, in the grid, moving from pos32 (col3, row2), moving north (dirup) would decrease the row to 1, so pos31 (col3, row1). Moving south (dirdown) increases row to 3, pos33 (col3, row3). Moving west (dirleft) to col2, row2: pos22. Moving east (dirright) to col4, row2: pos42.

So to push the stone west, the agent needs to be at pos42 (east of pos32) and push west. Alternatively, to push north, the agent would need to be south of pos32 (pos33) and push north. Wait, no: to push north, the agent needs to be south of the stone and push north. Because pushing north would move the stone to the north. So the agent must be at the position south of the stone (pos33) and push north (dirup) to move the stone to pos31 (col3, row1). But pos31 is not a goal. Alternatively, pushing west would take the stone towards pos22, then pos21, etc.

But the goal is pos15 (col1, row5). So perhaps the optimal path is to push the stone west to pos22, then west to pos12, then south to pos13, pos14, pos15. Wait, but pos12 is column1, row2. Then pushing south from pos12 would take the stone to pos13 (row3), then pos14 (row4), then pos15 (row5). But each push south would require the agent to be north of the stone and push south.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone west to pos22, then pos21, then pos11, then south to pos15. But pos11 is col1, row1. So pushing south four times would get to pos15. But pos11 is not a goal, so that's okay as long as the final push is to pos15.

But let's see. Let's plan step by step.

First, the agent needs to get to a position adjacent to the stone at pos32. Let's say the agent wants to push the stone west to pos22. To do that, the agent needs to be at pos42 (east of pos32) and push west. So how to get from pos55 to pos42.

Path from pos55 to pos42:

pos55 (col5, row5) → move dirup to pos54 (col5, row4)
pos54 → dirup to pos53 (col5, row3)
pos53 → dirup to pos52 (col5, row2)
pos52 → dirleft to pos42 (col4, row2)

Wait, checking movement options for each step:

From pos55: can move dirleft to pos45 (col4, row5) or dirup to pos54 (col5, row4).

Alternatively, moving up to pos54 (row4), then up to pos53 (row3), etc. Let's check if that's possible.

Looking at movement entries for pos55: "You may move from location pos55 to location pos45 following direction dirleft" and "You may move from location pos55 to location pos54 following direction dirup".

So from pos55, moving dirup to pos54. Then from pos54, movement options:

"You may move from location pos54 to location pos44 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos54 to location pos53 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos54 to location pos55 following direction dirdown"

So from pos54, moving dirup (row-1) to pos53 (col5, row3). Then from pos53:

"You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos53 to location pos52 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown"

Wait, moving dirup from pos53 (col5, row3) would take us to pos52 (col5, row2). Then from pos52:

"You may move from location pos52 to location pos42 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos52 to location pos51 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos52 to location pos53 following direction dirdown"

So from pos52, moving dirleft (col-1) to pos42 (col4, row2). Now, pos42 is adjacent to pos32 (col3, row2) to the east. So the agent is at pos42. From here, they can push the stone at pos32 west to pos22, using the pushtonongoal action (since pos22 is not a goal location). Then from pos22, push west to pos12 (also not a goal), then push south to pos13, pos14, pos15 (which is the goal).

So steps would be:

1. Move from pos55 to pos54 (dirup)
2. Move from pos54 to pos53 (dirup)
3. Move from pos53 to pos52 (dirup)
4. Move from pos52 to pos42 (dirleft)
5. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft) using pushtonongoal, since pos22 is not a goal.
6. Move agent from pos22 to pos12 (west) to get into position to push again.
Wait, no. After pushing from pos42 to pos32, the agent ends up at pos32. Let's see the effect of pushtonongoal:

After performing "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft", the effects are:

- agent is no longer at pos42
- stone is no longer at pos32
- pos22 is no longer clear
- agent is now at pos32
- stone is at pos22
- pos42 becomes clear

So after this action, the agent is at pos32. Now, to push the stone from pos22 to pos12 (dirleft), the agent needs to be east of pos22 (pos32), and push west. So from pos32, the agent can perform a pushtonongoal action to push the stone to pos12.

But for that, the agent is at pos32 (l_p), stone is at pos22 (l_from), l_to is pos12. The direction is dirleft. So the agent must be able to move from pos32 to pos22 via dirleft (which is possible, since pos32 to pos22 is dirleft). Then from pos22 to pos12 is also dirleft. So preconditions for pushtonongoal are satisfied.

So action would be "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft". But after this, the agent moves to pos22, stone to pos12.

Now, the stone is at pos12. To push it south towards pos15. So from pos12, pushing south (dirdown) to pos13, then pos14, then pos15.

But each push requires the agent to be north of the stone. So after pushing to pos12, the agent is at pos22 (from the previous push). Wait, after the second push (from pos22 to pos12), the agent would be at pos22 after the action? Wait, no. Let's recheck the effects of pushtonongoal:

After "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d", the agent moves from l_p to l_from, pushing the stone to l_to. So in the second push, l_p is pos32, l_from is pos22, l_to is pos12. The agent moves from pos32 to pos22, and the stone to pos12. So after this action, the agent is at pos22.

Now, the stone is at pos12. To push it south to pos13, the agent needs to be north of pos12 (pos11 or pos12's north). Wait, pos12 is col1, row2. North would be pos11 (col1, row1). But the agent is at pos22 (col2, row2). How to get to pos12's north?

Alternatively, the agent can move to pos12's east (pos22) and push west. Wait, but that would push the stone west to pos02, which doesn't exist. Alternatively, the agent can move to pos13 (south of pos12) and push north. Wait, but to push north, the agent must be south of the stone and push north. So if the stone is at pos12 (col1, row2), the agent can be at pos13 (col1, row3) and push north (dirup) to move the stone to pos12's north (pos11). But pos11 is not the goal. We need to push the stone south.

Alternatively, the agent can push the stone south from pos12. To do that, the agent must be north of pos12 (pos11) and push south. But pos11 is clear (from initial state). So the agent can move from pos22 to pos12 (dirleft), but pos12 is currently occupied by the stone. So that's not possible. Wait, after the stone is at pos12, pos12 is not clear. So the agent can't move there. So the agent is at pos22, and needs to get to pos11 (north of pos12) to push south.

So how to get from pos22 to pos11. pos22 is col2, row2. To get to pos11 (col1, row1), the agent can move west to pos12 (col1, row2), but that's where the stone is. So alternative path: pos22 → pos21 (dirup) to col2, row1. Then from pos21, move west to pos11 (dirleft). But pos21 to pos11 is allowed via dirleft. Let's check movement entries.

Looking for movement from pos21 to pos11: "You may move from location pos21 to location pos11 following direction dirleft". So yes. So the path would be:

From pos22, move dirup to pos21 (col2, row1). Then from pos21, dirleft to pos11 (col1, row1). Now the agent is at pos11, which is north of pos12. From here, the agent can push the stone south (dirdown) to pos13 (col1, row3). Wait, no. Pushing south from pos12 would move the stone to pos13. So the agent is at pos11 (north of pos12), and can push the stone south to pos13.

So action: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown". But wait, the direction must be such that the agent moves from l_p (pos11) to l_from (pos12) via direction d (dirdown), and l_from to l_to (pos13) via same direction. So yes. So after this action, the agent is at pos12, stone at pos13.

Then, push the stone from pos13 to pos14 (dirdown), then to pos15 (dirdown). Each time, the agent needs to be north of the stone to push south.

So after the stone is at pos13, the agent is at pos12. To push south again, the agent must move to pos13's north (pos12's south is pos13, so the agent needs to be at pos12 and push south. Wait, no. To push the stone from pos13 to pos14, the agent needs to be north of pos13 (pos12) and push south. But the agent is already at pos12 after the previous push. So action: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirdown". This would move the stone to pos14, agent to pos13.

Then, push from pos14 to pos15: "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos14 pos15 dirdown". Wait, no. The agent needs to be at l_p (pos14's north?), but pos14 is col1, row4. To push south to pos15, the agent must be at pos14 (col1, row4), push south. So the agent is at pos14, stone at pos14? No, the stone is at pos14. Wait, let me clarify. The stone is at pos14. To push it south to pos15 (which is a goal location), the agent needs to be north of pos14 (pos13) and push south.

Wait, the stone is at pos14 (col1, row4). To push it to pos15 (col1, row5), the agent must be at pos14's north (pos13) and push south. So the agent would need to move to pos13, then push south.

But after the previous push from pos13 to pos14, the agent is at pos13 (after pushing from pos12 to pos13: wait, no. Let's retrace:

After pushing the stone from pos12 to pos13:

- Preconditions: agent is at pos11 (l_p), moves dirdown to pos12 (l_from), pushes stone to pos13 (l_to). After action, agent is at pos12, stone at pos13.

Then, to push from pos13 to pos14, the agent must be at pos12 (north of pos13) and push south. So action: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirdown". This would move the agent to pos13, stone to pos14.

Then, to push from pos14 to pos15, the agent needs to be at pos13 (north of pos14), push south. Action: "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown". Since pos15 is a goal location, use pushtogoal. This would move the stone to pos15, and the agent to pos14.

Now, the stone is at pos15, which satisfies the goal. But we need to check the constraints:

1. "Location pos15 is not clear" must hold in at least one state. This is satisfied when the stone is at pos15.

2. If pos15 is not clear in some state s (which it is after the last action), then the agent must be at pos41 in s or later. After the last action, the agent is at pos14 (col1, row4). So after pushing the stone to pos15, the agent needs to move to pos41.

So the plan must include moving the agent from pos14 to pos41. How?

From pos14 (col1, row4), the agent can move right (dirright) to pos24 (col2, row4), then right to pos34 (col3, row4), etc. Let's find a path.

pos14 → pos24 (dirright)
pos24 → pos34 (dirright)
pos34 → pos44 (dirright)
pos44 → pos43 (dirup)
pos43 → pos42 (dirleft)
Wait, no. Let's see:

After pushing the stone to pos15, the agent is at pos14 (col1, row4). To reach pos41 (col4, row1), which is column4, row1.

Possible path:

pos14 (col1, row4) → move east to pos24 (dirright)
pos24 → pos34 (dirright)
pos34 → pos44 (dirright)
pos44 → pos43 (dirup)
pos43 → pos42 (dirdown? Wait, pos43 is col4, row3. To get to pos41 (col4, row1), need to move up twice.

pos43 → pos42 (dirup? Let's check movement options for pos43:

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown"

So from pos43, moving dirup (row-1) to pos42 (col4, row2). Then from pos42, moving dirup to pos41 (col4, row1).

So path:

pos14 → pos24 (dirright)
pos24 → pos34 (dirright)
pos34 → pos44 (dirright)
pos44 → pos43 (dirup)
pos43 → pos42 (dirup)
pos42 → pos41 (dirup)

So six move actions after the last push. Adding these to the plan.

Now, let's count the steps:

1. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
2. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
3. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup
4. move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft

15. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
16. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
17. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup

But this plan seems very long. Is there a shorter path? Let's see if we can optimize.

Alternative approach: After pushing the stone to pos15 (step 11), the agent is at pos14. To get to pos41, maybe a shorter path exists. For example, from pos14, move east to pos24, then north to pos23, pos22, pos21, then east to pos31, etc. But that might not be shorter.

Alternatively, after step 11 (agent at pos14), move dirright to pos24, then dirright to pos34, dirright to pos44, dirup to pos43, dirup to pos42, dirup to pos41. That's 5 moves (steps 12-16: pos14→pos24→pos34→pos44→pos43→pos42→pos41: 6 steps). So 6 steps after the last push.

But maybe there's a more efficient way. Let's think of the agent's position after each action.

After step 11 (pushtogoal to pos15), agent is at pos14. They need to reach pos41. pos14 is col1, row4.

The target is pos41 (col4, row1). The agent needs to move east three times (col1→col2→col3→col4) and north three times (row4→row3→row2→row1).

So from pos14:

move east to pos24 (dirright)
move east to pos34 (dirright)
move east to pos44 (dirright)
move north to pos43 (dirup)
move north to pos42 (dirup)
move north to pos41 (dirup)

That's six moves. So steps 12-17 as before.

But this makes the total plan 17 actions. However, maybe there's a way to reduce the number of steps by combining movements and pushes.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos15, the agent must move to pos41, which is required by the constraint. The constraint says that if pos15 is not clear (which it is after step 11), then the agent must be at pos41 either in that state or later. So after step 11, the agent is at pos14. They need to reach pos41 eventually. So the plan is valid as long as the agent reaches pos41 after step 11.

But the constraint is that if in any state s where pos15 is not clear, then in s or a subsequent state, the agent is at pos41. So once the stone is at pos15 (from step 11 onwards), the agent must reach pos41 at some point. So adding steps 12-17 ensures that.

But is there a shorter way to reach pos41 from pos14? Let's see:

pos14 → pos24 (east)
pos24 → pos23 (north)
pos23 → pos33 (east)
pos33 → pos43 (east)
pos43 → pos42 (north)
pos42 → pos41 (north)

This path is pos14 → pos24 → pos23 → pos33 → pos43 → pos42 → pos41 (6 moves). Same number of steps.

Alternatively, maybe using some pushtonongoal actions to move the agent faster? But there are no stones left to push. So the agent has to move manually.

So the plan seems to require 17 actions, which might be optimal. But maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, let's think again about the initial movement to reach the stone. Instead of going all the way to pos42, maybe the agent can take a different path.

Alternative path from pos55 to pos42:

pos55 → pos45 (dirleft)
pos45 → pos44 (dirup)
pos44 → pos43 (dirup)
pos43 → pos42 (dirup)

That's four steps instead of the previous four steps (55→54→53→52→42). Wait, original path was four steps, this is four steps. Same number.

But let's check movement options:

From pos55, move dirleft to pos45.

From pos45, move dirup to pos44? Is that possible?

Check movement entries for pos45: "You may move from location pos45 to location pos35 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos45 to location pos55 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos45 to location pos44 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos45 to location pos45 following direction dirdown" (no, that's a typo). Wait, the movement entries for pos45:

"You may move from location pos45 to location pos35 following direction dirleft" (col3, row5)
"You may move from location pos45 to location pos55 following direction dirright" (col5, row5)
"You may move from location pos45 to location pos44 following direction dirup" (col4, row4)
"You may move from location pos45 to location pos44 following direction dirup" — wait, yes.

So from pos45, moving dirup (row-1) to pos44 (col4, row4). Then pos44 → pos43 (dirup). Then pos43 → pos42 (dirup). So steps:

1. move pos55 to pos45 (dirleft)
2. move pos45 to pos44 (dirup)
3. move pos44 to pos43 (dirup)
4. move pos43 to pos42 (dirup)

This is four steps to reach pos42, same as before. So no improvement.

So the initial approach is okay.

Now, checking the constraints:

- The first constraint is satisfied when the stone is at pos15 (not clear).
- The second constraint requires that after pos15 is not clear, the agent is at pos41 eventually. The plan includes moving to pos41 after pushing the stone to pos15.

So the plan is valid.

But wait, the problem says that the plan must be optimal, i.e., no longer than any other valid plan. So perhaps there's a shorter plan. Let's think again.

Alternative approach: Can the agent push the stone east first and then south through a different path?

For example, push the stone east to pos42, then south to pos43, pos44, pos45, then west to pos35, pos25, pos15. But pos45 is not a goal, pos35 is not, etc. Hmm, but pos15 is the only goal. So this path would be longer.

Alternatively, pushing the stone south from pos32 to pos33, then to pos34, pos35, then west to pos25, pos15. But pos35 is col3, row5. Then west to pos25 (col2, row5), then pos15 (col1, row5). But moving west from pos25 to pos15 requires two pushes. But how to get the agent into position for those pushes.

Let's explore this alternative:

1. Agent moves from pos55 to pos45 (dirleft)
2. pos45 → pos35 (dirleft)
3. pos35 → pos34 (dirup)
4. pos34 → pos33 (dirup)
5. pos33 → pos32 (dirup) — but stone is at pos32. So agent can push the stone south.

But wait, agent is at pos33 and can push the stone south to pos33's direction. Wait, pos33 is col3, row3. The stone is at pos32 (col3, row2). So to push south from pos32, the agent needs to be north of pos32 (pos31?), but that's not adjacent.

Alternatively, if the stone is at pos32, the agent can be at pos33 (south of pos32) and push north (dirup) to move the stone to pos31 (col3, row1). But that's away from the goal. Not helpful.

Alternatively, pushing east to pos42. So agent moves to pos42 and pushes the stone east to pos42, but that's not helpful.

Hmm. Perhaps the initial path is better.

Another idea: After pushing the stone to pos22, instead of pushing west to pos12, push south to pos23, then pos24, pos25, then west to pos15. But pos25 is col2, row5. West to pos15 (col1, row5) requires two pushes. But pos25 is not a goal, so need to push west.

But pos25 to pos15 is two steps west. The agent would need to push from pos25 to pos15, but pos15 is col1, row5. So from pos25 (col2, row5), pushing west to pos15 (col1, row5). The agent would need to be east of pos25 (pos35) and push west. But pos35 is col3, row5. So path:

Stone at pos32 → pos22 → pos23 → pos24 → pos25 → pos15.

But each step requires the agent to be in the correct position. Let's see.

From pos32, push west to pos22. Then from pos22, push south to pos23 (dirdown). Then south to pos24, pos25, then west to pos15.

But pushing from pos22 to pos23 requires the agent to be north of pos22 (pos21) and push south. So after the first push to pos22, the agent is at pos32. To push south to pos23, the agent needs to move to pos22's north (pos21) and push south.

So steps:

After pushing to pos22 (step 5), agent is at pos32.

Then, agent moves from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft), then from pos22 to pos21 (dirup). Then, from pos21, push south to pos22 → pos23. Wait, no. The stone is at pos22. To push it south to pos23, the agent must be at pos22's north (pos21) and push south. So agent moves from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft), then from pos22 to pos21 (dirup). Then perform pushtonongoal from pos21 to pos22 (south), pushing the stone to pos23.

But pos21 to pos22 is dirdown (row+1). So direction is dirdown. Then from pos22 to pos23 is dirdown.

So action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirdown.

After this, the agent is at pos22, stone at pos23.

Then, push from pos23 to pos24: agent must be at pos23's north (pos22), push south. So agent is at pos22, push south to pos23 → pos24. Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown.

Then, push from pos24 to pos25: agent at pos24's north (pos23), push south. So agent moves to pos23, then push. Wait, agent is at pos24 after the previous push. To push from pos24 to pos25, agent must be at pos24's north (pos23), push south. So agent moves from pos24 to pos23 (dirup), then push.

This is getting complicated and may require more steps than the initial plan.

In comparison, the initial plan required pushing west twice and south three times, with the agent moving to pos41 afterwards. So initial plan may be shorter.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos15, the agent needs to move to pos41. Let's see if there's a way to reach pos41 quicker.

From pos14 (after the last push), perhaps:

pos14 → pos24 (dirright)
pos24 → pos34 (dirright)
pos34 → pos44 (dirright)
pos44 → pos43 (dirup)
pos43 → pos42 (dirup)
pos42 → pos41 (dirup)

Six steps. But maybe there's a shorter path via other directions.

Alternatively, pos14 → pos13 (dirup), then pos13 → pos23 (dirright), pos23 → pos33 (dirright), pos33 → pos43 (dirright), pos43 → pos42 (dirup), pos42 → pos41 (dirup). But that's six steps as well.

No improvement.

So the initial plan seems to be valid and optimal. But let's check if there's a way to reduce the steps.

Wait, after the first push, the agent is at pos32. Instead of pushing again to pos12, maybe push south first. For example:

After step 5 (pushtonongoal to pos22), agent is at pos32. Then push south to pos33. So agent is at pos32, pushes south to pos33. But pos33 is not a goal. Then push west to pos23, pos13, pos14, pos15.

But pushing south from pos22 would require the agent to be north of pos22 (pos21), but the agent is at pos32. Not sure. This seems more complicated.

Alternative idea: The agent can reach pos41 earlier in the plan. For example, after pushing the stone to pos15, but before moving to pos41, but the constraint requires that the agent is at pos41 after pos15 is not clear.

Wait, the constraint says: If in any state s where pos15 is not clear, then in s or a later state, the agent is at pos41. So the agent could be at pos41 before pushing the stone to pos15, but that's impossible because pos15 is clear initially. The only time pos15 becomes not clear is when the stone is placed there, which is the last push. So the agent must reach pos41 after that.

Thus, the steps to move to pos41 must come after the stone is at pos15.

Therefore, the initial plan's approach is correct.

Now, let's count the total steps in the initial plan:

1. move to pos54
2. move to pos53
3. move to pos52
4. move to pos42
5. push to pos22
6. push to pos12
7. move to pos21
8. move to pos11
9. push to pos13
10. push to pos14
11. push to pos15 (goal)
12. move to pos24
13. move to pos34
14. move to pos44
15. move to pos43
16. move to pos42
17. move to pos41

Total 17 steps. Is there a way to shorten this?

Alternative approach after step 11 (agent at pos14):

Can the agent move more efficiently to pos41?

From pos14 (col1, row4) to pos41 (col4, row1):

The difference is +3 in column (east) and -3 in row (north). So the agent needs to move east thrice and north thrice.

But possible paths:

pos14 → pos24 (east)
pos24 → pos23 (north)
pos23 → pos33 (east)
pos33 → pos32 (north)
pos32 → pos42 (east)
pos42 → pos41 (north)

But this path is:

1. pos14 → pos24 (east)
2. pos24 → pos23 (north)
3. pos23 → pos33 (east)
4. pos33 → pos32 (north)
5. pos32 → pos42 (east)
6. pos42 → pos41 (north)

Six steps. Same as before. So no improvement.

Another path:

pos14 → pos13 (north)
pos13 → pos23 (east)
pos23 → pos24 (south)
pos24 → pos34 (east)
pos34 → pos44 (east)
pos44 → pos43 (north)
pos43 → pos42 (north)
pos42 → pos41 (north)

That's eight steps, which is longer.

Thus, the initial path seems optimal.

Therefore, the plan is as follows:
