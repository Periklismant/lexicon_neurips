Let me understand the problem:

1. We have a 2D square grid with a player (player1) and a stone (stone1).
2. The goal is to move the stone to a goal location. The only goal location is pos33.
3. The player can move around the grid freely if the destination is clear.
4. The player can push the stone if:
   - player is adjacent to the stone in the direction of the push
   - the destination for the stone is clear
   - the destination for the stone matches the action (goal vs non-goal)

The initial state is:
- player1 is at pos45
- stone1 is at pos32
- goal location is pos33

Let's visualize the grid (where P is player, S is stone, G is goal):
```
1 2 3 4 5
1 . . . . .
2 . . . . .
3 . S G . .
4 . . . . P
5 . . . . .
```

The goal is to move the stone from pos32 to pos33. To do this, the player needs to:
1. Get to a position adjacent to the stone, such that pushing from that position would move the stone to the goal.
2. push the stone to the goal.

The stone is at pos32, and the goal is at pos33. 
- pos33 is to the right of pos32, so the player needs to be at pos31 (to the left of the stone) to push it right.
- Alternatively, the goal pos33 is below pos32, so the player needs to be at pos22 (above the stone) to push it down.

Let's think about the path for the player to get to either pos31 or pos22.

Path to pos31 (from pos45):
1. Move from pos45 to pos35 (left)
2. Move from pos35 to pos34 (up)
3. Move from pos34 to pos33 (up)
4. But we can't go to pos31 directly because stone1 is at pos32.

Path to pos22 (from pos45):
1. Move from pos45 to pos35 (left)
2. Move from pos35 to pos25 (left)
3. Move from pos25 to pos24 (up)
4. Move from pos24 to pos23 (up)
5. Move from pos23 to pos22 (up)

From pos22, the player can push the stone to the goal location.

Let me double-check this plan:
1. Player moves from pos45 to pos35 (left)
2. Player moves from pos35 to pos25 (left)
3. Player moves from pos25 to pos24 (up)
4. Player moves from pos24 to pos23 (up)
5. Player moves from pos23 to pos22 (up)
6. Player pushes the stone from pos22 to pos32 (down) and stone to pos33 (down)

Wait, the directions in the problem statement seem a bit tricky. Let me clarify the directions:
- dirright means moving from a location to a location to its right. For example, from pos11 to pos21.
- dirdown means moving from a location to a location below it. For example, from pos11 to pos12.
- dirleft means moving from a location to a location to its left. For example, from pos21 to pos11.
- dirup means moving from a location to a location above it. For example, from pos12 to pos11.

I think that's a bit unintuitive but let's work with it. Looking at the individual movement rules, e.g., "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright", it seems like the directions are:
- dirright means moving from a column with lower index to a column with higher index. E.g., from column 1 to column 2.
- dirdown means moving from a row with lower index to a row with higher index. E.g., from row 1 to row 2.
- dirleft means moving from a column with higher index to a column with lower index. E.g., from column 2 to column 1.
- dirup means moving from a row with higher index to a row with lower index. E.g., from row 2 to row 1.

So, the grid might look like:
```
    1   2   3   4   5 (columns)
  +---+---+---+---+---+
1 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
2 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
3 |   | S | G |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
4 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
5 |   |   |   |   | P |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
   (rows)
```

Given this interpretation, let's re-plan:

1. The stone is at pos32 (row 3, column 2).
2. The goal is at pos33 (row 3, column 3).
3. To push the stone from pos32 to pos33, the player needs to be at a position such that pushing would move the stone to the goal.

The goal is to the right of the stone, so the player needs to be to the left of the stone (at pos31) to push it to the right.

Path to pos31 (from pos45):
1. Move from pos45 to pos44 (dirup)
2. Move from pos44 to pos43 (dirup)
3. Move from pos43 to pos42 (dirup)
4. Move from pos42 to pos41 (dirup)
5. Move from pos41 to pos31 (dirleft)

From pos31, the player can push the stone to the goal location pos33.

Let's double-check this plan:
1. Player moves from pos45 to pos44 (dirup)
2. Player moves from pos44 to pos43 (dirup)
3. Player moves from pos43 to pos42 (dirup)
4. Player moves from pos42 to pos41 (dirup)
5. Player moves from pos41 to pos31 (dirleft)
6. Player pushes the stone from pos32 to pos33 (dirright)

Let me check whether we can actually generate the action for pushing the stone. The action name is "pushtogoal" because the destination is a goal location. The parameters are:
- p (player): player1
- s (stone): stone1
- l_p (player location): pos31
- l_from (stone location): pos32
- l_to (destination location): pos33
- d (direction): dirright

So the action would be: "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright"

And the full plan would be:
1. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
2. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
3. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
4. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
5. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
6. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright

But wait, there's a problem. I was mixing up the locations and their physical coordinates. The locations "posXY" are named in a way where X is the column and Y is the row. For example, pos32 means column 3, row 2.

Let's reconsider by looking at the adjacency relations:
- You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright
- You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown

This confirms that the first digit is the column and the second digit is the row. So, pos32 is at column 3, row 2. And pos33 is at column 3, row 3. The goal is directly below the stone.

Given this, let's redraw the grid:
```
    1   2   3   4   5 (columns)
  +---+---+---+---+---+
1 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
2 |   |   | S |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
3 |   |   | G |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
4 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
5 |   |   |   |   | P |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
   (rows)
```

The stone is at pos32 (column 3, row 2), and the goal is at pos33 (column 3, row 3). To push the stone from pos32 to pos33, the player needs to be at a position that when pushing, the stone will move to the goal.

The goal is below the stone, so the player needs to be above the stone (at pos31) to push it down. But wait, that's confusing because pos31 is to the left of pos32. Let me look at how the directions work:

- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" -> Moving from column 1 to column 2 in the same row.
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown" -> Moving from row 1 to row 2 in the same column.

Ok, so posXY represents the location at column X, row Y. And the directions are:
- dirright: Moving from a location to the location with a higher column number.
- dirdown: Moving from a location to the location with a higher row number.
- dirleft: Moving from a location to the location with a lower column number.
- dirup: Moving from a location to the location with a lower row number.

Given this, our grid looks like:
```
    1   2   3   4   5 (columns)
  +---+---+---+---+---+
1 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
2 |   |   | S |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
3 |   |   | G |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
4 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
5 |   |   |   |   | P |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
   (rows)
```

To push the stone from pos32 to pos33, the player needs to be at pos31 (if pushing from left to right) or at pos22 (if pushing from top to bottom).

Let's try the path to pos22:
1. Move from pos45 to pos35 (dirleft)
2. Move from pos35 to pos25 (dirleft)
3. Move from pos25 to pos24 (dirleft)
4. Move from pos24 to pos23 (dirleft)
5. Move from pos23 to pos22 (dirleft)

Actually, that doesn't work because we're not changing the row when we want to go dirleft. Let's go back to the movement rules:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" -> Moving from column 1 to column 2 in the same row.
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown" -> Moving from row 1 to row 2 in the same column.

Ok, now I have a clearer picture. Each location posXY has a specific row number Y and a specific column number X.

- dirright: Increasing X (column) while Y remains constant.
- dirdown: Increasing Y (row) while X remains constant.
- dirleft: Decreasing X (column) while Y remains constant.
- dirup: Decreasing Y (row) while X remains constant.

Let's visualize the grid again:
```
    1   2   3   4   5 (columns)
  +---+---+---+---+---+
1 |1,1|2,1|3,1|4,1|5,1|
  +---+---+---+---+---+
2 |1,2|2,2|3,2|4,2|5,2|
  +---+---+---+---+---+
3 |1,3|2,3|3,3|4,3|5,3|
  +---+---+---+---+---+
4 |1,4|2,4|3,4|4,4|5,4|
  +---+---+---+---+---+
5 |1,5|2,5|3,5|4,5|5,5|
  +---+---+---+---+---+
   (rows)
```

So, player1 is at pos45 (column 4, row 5), and stone1 is at pos32 (column 3, row 2). The goal location is pos33 (column 3, row 3).

To push the stone from pos32 to pos33, the player needs to be at:
- pos22 (if pushing from left to right) - No, this is wrong, as pos22 is to the left of pos32, not to its right.
- pos31 (if pushing from top to bottom) - No, this is wrong, as pos31 is neither above nor below pos32.

Let me check the grid again:

- pos32 (column 3, row 2) is the stone's location.
- pos33 (column 3, row 3) is the goal location.

Since the goal is below the stone (in row 3 versus the stone in row 2), to push the stone down, the player needs to be above the stone. That would be at position (column 3, row 1), which is pos31.

Alternatively, since the goal is in the same column as the stone (column 3), the player could also push the stone from the left or right, if those positions are adjacent to the stone. So, the player could be at pos22 (column 2, row 2) and push the stone to the right.

Let's check the adjacency relations in the problem:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" -> Moving from (1,1) to (2,1)
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown" -> Moving from (1,1) to (1,2)

If posXY is (X,Y), then the adjacency relations match the grid I've visualized.

Given the grid, to push the stone from pos32 to pos33, the player needs to be at:
- pos31 (if pushing from the top down) - pushing from (3,1) to (3,2) with the stone moving to (3,3).
- pos22 (if pushing from the left to the right) - pushing from (2,2) to (3,2) with the stone moving to (3,3). Wait, this is incorrect. If the player is at (2,2) and the stone is at (3,2), pushing from left to right would move the stone to (4,2), not to (3,3).
- pos42 (if pushing from the right to the left) - pushing from (4,2) to (3,2) with the stone moving to (3,3). This is also incorrect for the same reason.

I think I'm confusing myself. Let's be precise:

1. The stone is at pos32 (column 3, row 2).
2. The goal is at pos33 (column 3, row 3), which is directly below the stone.
3. To push the stone from pos32 to pos33, the player needs to be in a position such that they can push the stone, and the stone moves to the goal.

Let's look at the "pushtogoal" action: "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d". The preconditions include:
(iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d,
(v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.

For the stone to move from pos32 to pos33, the direction (d) should be "dirdown" (since we're increasing the row from 2 to 3 while keeping the column fixed at 3).

Given (iv), the player should be in a position such that moving in the direction "dirdown" brings them to pos32. That would be pos31 (column 3, row 1). Wait, but that's not right. If the player is at pos31 and moves "dirdown", they'd be at pos32, which is where the stone is.

Let me think again: The stone is at pos32 and the goal is at pos33. The stone needs to move "dirdown" to get to the goal. For the player to push the stone, the player needs to be behind the stone in the direction opposite to the direction of the push.

If the stone is moving "dirdown", the player should be "dirup" from the stone. So, the player should be at pos31.

But wait, that doesn't seem right. If the stone is at (3,2) and needs to move to (3,3) in the "dirdown" direction, then the player should be at (3,1), which would be "dirup" from the stone. The position (3,1) is pos31.

Let me double-check this by referring to the action's preconditions:
(iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d,
(v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.

If the player is at pos31, the stone is at pos32, and the goal is at pos33, and the direction is "dirdown", then:
- We can get from pos31 to pos32 following dirdown? Yes, pos31 is at (3,1) and pos32 is at (3,2). So moving from row 1 to row 2 is "dirdown".
- We can get from pos32 to pos33 following dirdown? Yes, pos32 is at (3,2) and pos33 is at (3,3). So moving from row 2 to row 3 is "dirdown".

So, to push the stone from pos32 to pos33, the player needs to be at pos31.

Path to pos31 (from pos45):
1. Move from pos45 to pos35 (dirleft) - from (4,5) to (3,5)
2. Move from pos35 to pos34 (dirup) - from (3,5) to (3,4)
3. Move from pos34 to pos33 (dirup) - from (3,4) to (3,3)
4. Move from pos33 to pos32 (dirup) - Wait, this is where the stone is!

That didn't work. Let's try another approach.

Path to pos31 (from pos45):
1. Move from pos45 to pos44 (dirup) - from (4,5) to (4,4)
2. Move from pos44 to pos43 (dirup) - from (4,4) to (4,3)
3. Move from pos43 to pos42 (dirup) - from (4,3) to (4,2)
4. Move from pos42 to pos41 (dirup) - from (4,2) to (4,1)
5. Move from pos41 to pos31 (dirleft) - from (4,1) to (3,1)

From pos31, the player can push the stone to pos33:
6. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown

That looks like a valid path.

Let's double-check:
1. The player moves from pos45 to pos44 (dirup) - Valid because the player is at pos45 and pos44 is clear.
2. The player moves from pos44 to pos43 (dirup) - Valid because the player is at pos44 and pos43 is clear.
3. The player moves from pos43 to pos42 (dirup) - Valid because the player is at pos43 and pos42 is clear.
4. The player moves from pos42 to pos41 (dirup) - Valid because the player is at pos42 and pos41 is clear.
5. The player moves from pos41 to pos31 (dirleft) - Valid because the player is at pos41 and pos31 is clear.
6. The player pushes the stone from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown) - Valid because the player is at pos31, the stone is at pos32, the goal is at pos33, and all adjacency relations are correct.

So, the plan is:
1. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
2. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
3. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
4. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
5. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
6. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown

However, I just realized another problem. I'm unsure about the adjacency relations, which might change our plan.

Let's revisit: "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright". This tells us that pos11 (column 1, row 1) is adjacent to pos21 (column 2, row 1) in the "dirright" direction.

I'm not sure whether the adjacency relations are given in the problem, or if we need to infer them. Let's review the problem statement.

The problem states:
"The world consists of a 2D square grid. Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty."

Since it's a grid, adjacent cells are those that share an edge. So, a cell (X, Y) is adjacent to (X+1, Y), (X-1, Y), (X, Y+1), and (X, Y-1).

I see a long list of "You may move from location X to location Y following direction Z" in the problem statement, which suggests that the adjacency relations are indeed given.

So, to be safe, let's confirm our plan based on these adjacency relations. Let's trace our plan:

1. The player moves from pos45 to pos44 (dirup):
   "You may move from location pos45 to location pos44 following direction dirup" is in the adjacency relations, so this is valid.

2. The player moves from pos44 to pos43 (dirup):
   "You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup" is in the adjacency relations, so this is valid.

3. The player moves from pos43 to pos42 (dirup):
   "You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup" is in the adjacency relations, so this is valid.

4. The player moves from pos42 to pos41 (dirup):
   "You may move from location pos42 to location pos41 following direction dirup" is in the adjacency relations, so this is valid.

5. The player moves from pos41 to pos31 (dirleft):
   "You may move from location pos41 to location pos31 following direction dirleft" is in the adjacency relations, so this is valid.

6. The player pushes the stone from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown):
   We need to check if "You may move from location pos31 to location pos32 following direction dirdown" and "You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown" are both in the adjacency relations. Both are present, so this is valid.

Our plan is valid:
1. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
2. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
3. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
4. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
5. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
6. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown

Actually, I just realized I had one more question: Is pos32 where the stone is initially clear or not? If the stone is there, it's not clear. But I checked the problem statement, and it says "Location pos32 is clear", which is confusing because the stone is at pos32. But it also specifies the stone location: "stone1 is at location pos32".

I think this is just a redundancy in the problem description, specifying both the locations that are clear and the locations of the stone and player.

From "stone1 is at location pos32" and "player1 is at location pos45", we know that these locations are not clear. The rest of the locations are clear. 

Actually, on review on the problem statement:
    "Location pos32 is clear"
    "Location pos45 is clear"

This is odd, because we're also told:
    "player1 is at location pos45"
    "stone1 is at location pos32"

I think this might be a bug in the problem description. Let's assume the correct state is that the stone is at pos32 and the player is at pos45, and these locations are not clear.

Let me do one more check by looking at the conditions for the actions:

For the "move" action:
(i) agent p is at location l_from, (ii) location l_to is clear, and (iii) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.

For the "pushtogoal" action:
(i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is a goal location.

Given these conditions, it's clear that a location with a player or a stone is not "clear". So, the correct state is that the stone is at pos32 and the player is at pos45, and these locations are not clear. The issue might arise due to the "effects" of actions, where executing an action might make a location clear.

Let's now re-check our plan with the correct understanding:

1. The player moves from pos45 to pos44 (dirup): Player is at pos45, and pos44 is clear. After this, pos45 becomes clear, and pos44 is not clear.

2. The player moves from pos44 to pos43 (dirup): Player is at pos44, and pos43 is clear. After this, pos44 becomes clear, and pos43 is not clear.

3. The player moves from pos43 to pos42 (dirup): Player is at pos43, and pos42 is clear. After this, pos43 becomes clear, and pos42 is not clear.

4. The player moves from pos42 to pos41 (dirup): Player is at pos42, and pos41 is clear. After this, pos42 becomes clear, and pos41 is not clear.

5. The player moves from pos41 to pos31 (dirleft): Player is at pos41, and pos31 is clear. After this, pos41 becomes clear, and pos31 is not clear.

6. The player pushes the stone from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown): Player is at pos31, stone is at pos32, pos33 is clear, the goal is at pos33, and all adjacency relations are correct. After this, pos31 becomes clear, the player is at pos32, and the stone is at pos33.

Our plan is still valid:
1. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
2. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
3. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
4. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
5. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
6. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown

So, our plan is valid and achieves the goal of moving the stone to a goal location.

Actually, let me check really quick whether there's a shorter plan. The key constraint is that, to push the stone from pos32 to pos33, the player must be at pos31. So, we need to find the shortest path from pos45 to pos31. There are several possible paths:

Path 1 (as previously determined):
1. Move from pos45 to pos44 (dirup) - from (4,5) to (4,4)
2. Move from pos44 to pos43 (dirup) - from (4,4) to (4,3)
3. Move from pos43 to pos42 (dirup) - from (4,3) to (4,2)
4. Move from pos42 to pos41 (dirup) - from (4,2) to (4,1)
5. Move from pos41 to pos31 (dirleft) - from (4,1) to (3,1)

Path 2:
1. Move from pos45 to pos35 (dirleft) - from (4,5) to (3,5)
2. Move from pos35 to pos34 (dirup) - from (3,5) to (3,4)
3. Move from pos34 to pos33 (dirup) - from (3,4) to (3,3)
... but I can't go directly from pos33 to pos31 because the stone is at pos32.

Path 3:
1. Move from pos45 to pos44 (dirup) - from (4,5) to (4,4)
2. Move from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft) - from (4,4) to (3,4)
3. Move from pos34 to pos33 (dirup) - from (3,4) to (3,3)
... same issue, I can't go directly from pos33 to pos31 because the stone is at pos32.

Path 4:
1. Move from pos45 to pos35 (dirleft) - from (4,5) to (3,5)
2. Move from pos35 to pos25 (dirleft) - from (3,5) to (2,5)
3. Move from pos25 to pos24 (dirup) - from (2,5) to (2,4)
4. Move from pos24 to pos23 (dirup) - from (2,4) to (2,3)
5. Move from pos23 to pos22 (dirup) - from (2,3) to (2,2)
6. Move from pos22 to pos21 (dirup) - from (2,2) to (2,1)
7. Move from pos21 to pos31 (dirright) - from (2,1) to (3,1)

And so on. We can see that Path 1 is the shortest, with 5 moves before the push. So, our plan is optimal.

Let's summarize the full plan:
1. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
2. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
3. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
4. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
5. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
6. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown

Actually, let me just double-check if I can use a different approach to push the stone to the goal. If the stone is at pos32 and the goal is at pos33, can the player push it from pos22 to pos33?

"pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos33 dirdown"

This would need:
- The player to be at pos22.
- The stone to be at pos32.
- The goal to be at pos33.
- We can get from pos22 to pos32 following dirdown.
- We can get from pos32 to pos33 following dirdown.

Let's check the adjacency relations. I'm not sure whether we can get from pos22 to pos32 following dirdown. The stone is at (3, 2) and the player is at (2, 2). Moving from (2, 2) to (3, 2) is going right, not down. So, this wouldn't be a valid push.

I think our original plan is the only valid approach.

Let's finalize:
1. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
2. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
3. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
4. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
5. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
6. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown
