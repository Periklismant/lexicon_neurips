Okay, let's try to figure out this planning problem. The goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. The only goal location mentioned is pos11. So, stone1 starts at pos42, which is not a goal. The player starts at pos53. The constraints are pretty complex, so I need to make sure each one is satisfied.

First, let's outline the constraints:

1. The player must be at pos32 at least once. And when they are, pos34 must be not clear either at that state or later.
2. Stone1 must be at pos42 in some state. When that's true, either stone1 ends up at pos45 or pos54 is not clear after.
3. At some point, either pos43 or pos45 is not clear.
4. At some point, stone1 is either at pos55 or pos24.
5. At some point, stone1 is at pos13 or pos14 is not clear.
6. pos23 must be not clear at some state. Before that happens, either pos53 or pos45 was not clear earlier.
7. The "not clear" states for pos52, pos22, and pos23 can only be in one continuous sequence each.
8. pos13 must always be clear.

So, starting with moving the agent to push the stone. The stone is at pos42. The goal is to get it to pos11. But how? The path from pos42 to pos11 might require moving through various positions. Let's see the grid layout.

Looking at the movement possibilities: pos42 can go to pos32 (left), pos52 (right), pos41 (up), or pos43 (down). Since the agent starts at pos53, they might need to move towards pos42. Let's see the steps.

First, the agent is at pos53. To get to pos42, possible path: pos53 → pos43 (left), then pos43 → pos42 (up). Then, from pos42, the agent can push the stone. But the stone is at pos42. To push it, the agent must be adjacent in the direction of movement. Wait, the preconditions for pushtogoal or pushtonongoal require the agent to be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's current location), and direction d must allow movement from l_p to l_from, and then l_from to l_to.

So, for example, if the agent is at pos43 (south of pos42), they can push the stone north (direction dirup) to pos32? Wait, directions: the movement from pos43 to pos42 is dirup, right? Because the movement from pos42 to pos43 is dirdown. Wait, looking at the movement rules: "You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown." So, if the agent is at pos43 and wants to push the stone at pos42 upwards (dirup), that would be from pos42 to pos32 (since pos42 can go left to pos32). Wait, no: movement from pos42 can go left (dirleft) to pos32, right (dirright) to pos52, up (dirup) to pos41, or down (dirdown) to pos43.

Wait, the directions are a bit confusing. Let me check the movement possibilities for pos42:

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos52 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos41 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown"

So, if the agent is at pos43 (south of pos42), they can move north (dirup) to pos42. Then, pushing the stone from pos42 to pos43 (south) would be dirdown. But pos43 is a non-goal location, so that would require pushtonongoal. But since we need to eventually get the stone to a goal location (pos11), pushing it south to pos43 isn't helpful. Alternatively, pushing it left (dirleft) to pos32. But pos32 is not a goal. So maybe the agent needs to push the stone west to pos32, then further west to pos22, etc., towards pos11.

But pos11 is a goal. Let's see the path from pos42 to pos11. The path would be pos42 → pos32 → pos22 → pos12 → pos11. Each of these steps requires pushing the stone left (dirleft). But each of these positions except pos11 is a non-goal, so we can only use pushtonongoal until the last step to pos11, which would be pushtogoal.

Wait, but the agent can only push to a goal location if the destination is a goal. So, for each push, if the destination is a goal, use pushtogoal; otherwise, pushtonongoal.

So, the plan might involve pushing the stone from pos42 to pos32 (non-goal), then pos32 to pos22 (non-goal), then pos22 to pos12 (non-goal), then pos12 to pos11 (goal). Each of these steps requires the agent to position themselves appropriately.

But let's check the constraints. One of the constraints is that the player must be at pos32 at least once. So, during the process of pushing the stone from pos42 to pos32, the agent would be at pos32 after pushing. Wait, no. Let me think: when the agent pushes a stone from l_from to l_to, the agent moves into l_from's position. For example, when using pushtonongoal, the agent is at l_p (which is adjacent to l_from), then pushes the stone to l_to. The agent then moves to l_from, and the stone is at l_to.

So, pushing the stone from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft) would require the agent to be at pos42's right (pos52) or other adjacent positions. Wait, no. The direction for pushing: the agent must be at l_p, which is reachable from l_from via direction d. So, to push the stone from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft), the agent must be at pos42's right (pos52) and move left? Wait, no. Wait, the direction for movement from l_p to l_from. So, for pushing from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft), the agent must be at a position l_p such that moving from l_p to l_from (pos42) follows direction d. For example, if the direction is dirleft, then moving from l_p to pos42 via dirleft would mean that l_p is to the right of pos42. So pos42's right is pos52. So the agent would be at pos52, then move left to pos42 (dirleft), which allows pushing the stone left to pos32. But the agent needs to be at pos52 to do that. But initially, the agent is at pos53. So the agent would need to move from pos53 to pos52 (dirup, since pos53 can move to pos52 via dirup), then to pos52. Then, from pos52, move left to pos42 (dirleft) as part of the push action.

Wait, no. The "pushtonongoal" action's preconditions include that the agent is at l_p, which must be reachable from l_from via direction d. Wait, no: the preconditions say (iv) you can get from location l_p to l_from following direction d. So, direction d is the direction from l_p to l_from.

So, for example, if the agent is at pos52 (which is east of pos42), and wants to push the stone west to pos32, then the direction from l_p (pos52) to l_from (pos42) is dirleft. Because moving left from pos52 to pos42. Then, the direction from l_from (pos42) to l_to (pos32) is also dirleft. So the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft

This would push the stone from pos42 to pos32, with the agent moving from pos52 to pos42, and the stone moving to pos32.

But wait, after this action, the agent ends up at pos42, and the stone is at pos32. Then, the next step would be to push the stone further left to pos22. But to do that, the agent needs to be east of pos32 (pos42) again. Wait, pos32's east is pos42. So the agent is already at pos42 after the first push. Then, from pos42, to push the stone west to pos22, the agent needs to be at pos32's east, which is pos42. Wait, no. Wait, if the stone is at pos32, to push it west to pos22, the agent needs to be east of pos32 (pos42) and move west (dirleft) to pos32, pushing the stone further west to pos22.

So, the next action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft. But after the first push, the agent is at pos42. So they can perform this action.

Then, pushing the stone to pos12, then to pos11. But pos11 is a goal, so the last push would be pushtogoal.

But let's check the constraints. One constraint is that the player must be at pos32 in some state. In the current plan, the agent is at pos42 after the first push, then moves to pos32 when pushing the stone from pos32 to pos22. Wait, no. When pushing the stone from pos32 to pos22, the agent is at pos42 (l_p is pos42), direction is dirleft (from pos42 to pos32). Then, the agent moves to pos32 (l_from), and the stone moves to pos22. So after that action, the agent is at pos32. That satisfies the first constraint (player1 is at pos32 in some state). Then, the next constraint is that when the player is at pos32, pos34 must be not clear either then or later. So after the agent is at pos32, pos34 must be blocked at some point. How to achieve that?

Perhaps after pushing the stone to pos22, the agent moves towards pos34 and does something. But pos34 is not a goal. Alternatively, maybe during the process of moving the stone, pos34 gets occupied. Hmm.

Wait, let's think. The stone is moving from pos32 to pos22 to pos12 to pos11. The agent's path after pushing to pos32 would be at pos42, then after pushing to pos22, the agent is at pos32. Then, to push the stone from pos22 to pos12, the agent needs to be east of pos22 (pos32), push west to pos12. So the agent would be at pos32, pushing the stone to pos12. Then, the agent ends up at pos22. Then, push the stone to pos11. But pos12 to pos11 is a move north (dirup) or west (dirleft)? Let me check the movement from pos12 to pos11: "You may move from location pos12 to location pos11 following direction dirup". So to push the stone from pos12 to pos11, the agent needs to be south of pos12 (pos22), direction dirup. So pushtogoal action would be used here since pos11 is a goal.

But after pushing the stone to pos22, the agent is at pos32. Then, how to get to pos22 to push the stone west again. Wait, the agent is at pos32 after pushing to pos22. Then, to push the stone from pos22 to pos12, the agent needs to be east of pos22 (pos32), direction dirleft. So the next action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft. After that, the agent is at pos22, and the stone is at pos12. Then, pushtogoal from pos12 to pos11: the agent must be at pos22 (south of pos12) and push north (dirup). So pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos12 pos11 dirup.

This would move the stone to pos11, which is a goal. Then, the stone is at a goal location. So that's the main plan.

Now, check constraints:

1. Player must be at pos32. In the plan above, when pushing from pos32 to pos22, the agent is at pos32 after the action. So that's covered.

2. When the player is at pos32, pos34 must be not clear at that state or later. So after the agent is at pos32, pos34 must be occupied at some point. How? The stone is moving towards pos11, so maybe during the movement, the agent could move to pos34 and place something there. But the stone is already at pos22. Alternatively, maybe the agent after pushing the stone to pos11 can move to pos34. But that would require additional steps.

Wait, pos34 is part of the grid. Let's see the movement paths. From pos32, can the agent move to pos34? Let's check the allowed movements. Looking at the movement rules:

From pos32: can move to pos22 (dirleft), pos42 (dirright), pos31 (dirup), pos33 (dirdown).

Wait, pos32's movements:

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos31 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown"

So from pos32, the agent can't directly reach pos34. To get to pos34, the agent would need to move from pos32 to pos33 (down), then pos33 to pos34 (down). Then, maybe push something to pos34, but there's only one stone. Alternatively, maybe after the stone is at pos11, the agent can move around and block pos34.

But we need to ensure that after the agent is at pos32 (during the push from pos22 to pos12), the agent's subsequent actions cause pos34 to be not clear. Hmm. Since the only stone is at pos11, maybe the agent needs to move to pos34 themselves. So after pushing the stone to pos11, the agent can move to pos34, making it not clear. That would satisfy the constraint that when the agent was at pos32 (earlier), eventually pos34 is not clear.

So after the final push to pos11, the agent can move to pos34. Let's see:

After the pushtogoal action, the agent is at pos12 (since they were at pos22, pushed to pos12, then to pos11, so the agent would be at pos12 after that action? Wait, no. Let's re-examine the pushtogoal action's effects. When you push from pos12 to pos11, the agent is at pos22 (l_p), pushes the stone from pos12 (l_from) to pos11 (l_to). The direction is dirup (from pos22 to pos12, direction dirup? Wait, no. The agent must be at l_p (pos22) and move from l_p to l_from (pos12) via direction d. Since pos22 is south of pos12, the direction from pos22 to pos12 is dirup. Then, the direction from pos12 to pos11 is dirup. So the action would be pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos12 pos11 dirup.

After this action, the agent moves from pos22 to pos12 (l_from), and the stone moves to pos11. So the agent is now at pos12. Then, to get to pos34, the agent would need to move from pos12 to pos22 (dirup?), then pos22 to pos32, then pos32 to pos33 (dirdown), pos33 to pos34 (dirdown). Then, pos34 becomes not clear because the agent is there. So, after that, the constraint is satisfied.

So adding these moves after the main plan would ensure that pos34 is not clear after the agent was at pos32. That satisfies the second part of the first constraint.

Next, the second constraint: stone1 must be at pos42 in some state. The initial state has stone1 at pos42, so that's already satisfied. But when the stone is at pos42, the constraint is that either stone1 is later at pos45 or pos54 is not clear. So after the initial state, the stone is moved away. So we need to ensure that after the initial state (where stone1 is at pos42), either it's moved to pos45 or pos54 becomes not clear. Since in the main plan, the stone is moved to pos11, which is not pos45, we need to have pos54 not clear at some point after. So maybe during the agent's movement to pos34, they can pass through pos54. For example, after moving to pos34, the agent could go to pos44, then pos54. But pos54 is initially clear. If the agent moves to pos54, then pos54 becomes not clear. So that would satisfy the constraint.

Third constraint: At some state, pos43 or pos45 is not clear. In the main plan, when the agent moves from pos53 to pos43 (left), pos43 becomes not clear. Because initially, pos43 is clear. When the agent moves there, it's occupied. So during the first move, the agent is at pos53, then moves left to pos43. That makes pos43 not clear. So that satisfies the third constraint.

Fourth constraint: stone1 must be at pos55 or pos24 at some point. In the main plan, the stone is moved from pos42 to pos32, then pos22, pos12, pos11. So it's never at pos24 or pos55. Therefore, this constraint is not satisfied. Hmm, that's a problem. So the plan must include moving the stone to either pos24 or pos55 at some point before reaching pos11. But how? That complicates the plan.

Alternatively, maybe the stone can be temporarily moved to pos24 or pos55 and then moved to pos11. But that would require a longer path. Let's think. Suppose after pushing the stone from pos42 to pos32, the agent then pushes it to pos33, pos34, pos35, pos45, pos55. But pos55 is a non-goal, so pushtonongoal. Then, from pos55, pushing back to pos45, pos35, etc., towards pos11. That's a detour but could satisfy the constraint. Alternatively, pushing the stone to pos24. How to get there?

Another approach: after moving the stone to pos32, perhaps push it up to pos31, then to pos21, pos22, pos23, pos24. But pos24 is not a goal. Then, from pos24, push to pos14, pos13, pos12, pos11. But that's a longer path. However, this would satisfy the fourth constraint (stone1 is at pos24). But this would require more steps.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the stone to pos24 first, then back to pos22, then to pos12, etc. Let's see. But how?

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos32, instead of pushing it left to pos22, push it down to pos33. Then to pos34, pos35, pos45, pos55. Then, from pos55, move east to pos45, etc. But this seems complicated. However, the fourth constraint requires that stone1 is at pos24 or pos55 at some state. So we need to include that.

So, perhaps after pushing the stone from pos42 to pos32, the agent pushes it down to pos33, then right to pos43, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, after pos32, push it to pos33, then pos34, pos35, pos45, pos55. Then, push it back to pos45, pos35, etc., towards pos11. But this would take many steps and may not be optimal. But given the constraints, it's necessary.

Alternatively, after the stone is at pos22, push it down to pos23, then right to pos24. Then, from pos24, push left to pos14, then up to pos11. But pos24 is a non-goal. Let's see:

Original plan: pos42 → pos32 → pos22 → pos12 → pos11.

Alternative path: pos42 → pos32 → pos33 → pos34 → pos35 → pos45 → pos55. Then, from pos55, push left to pos45, then to pos35, pos25, pos15, pos14, pos13, pos12, pos11. But this is a very long path and would not be optimal. But the problem requires an optimal plan. So maybe there's a shorter way to satisfy all constraints.

Wait, the fourth constraint is that the stone must be at pos24 or pos55 at some state. So even a temporary stop there would suffice. So perhaps after moving the stone to pos22, the agent could push it to pos24. For example:

Stone at pos22. To push to pos24, which is east of pos23. Wait, pos22 can move down to pos23. Then pos23 can move down to pos24. So, from pos22, the agent pushes the stone down to pos23, then from pos23, down to pos24. But pos24 is not a goal. Then, from pos24, push left to pos14, up to pos11. But this adds steps but allows the stone to be at pos24, satisfying the fourth constraint.

So, modified plan:

1. Push stone1 from pos42 → pos32 (pushtonongoal)
2. Push stone1 from pos32 → pos22 (pushtonongoal)
3. Push stone1 from pos22 → pos23 (pushtonongoal, direction dirdown)
4. Push stone1 from pos23 → pos24 (pushtonongoal, direction dirdown)
5. Push stone1 from pos24 → pos14 (pushtonongoal, direction dirleft)
6. Push stone1 from pos14 → pos13 (pushtonongoal, direction dirup)
7. Push stone1 from pos13 → pos12 (pushtonongoal, direction dirup)
8. Push stone1 from pos12 → pos11 (pushtogoal, direction dirup)

But wait, pos14 is not a goal. So steps 5-7 would need to be pushtonongoal. Then step 8 is pushtogoal. However, this path adds several steps and may not be optimal. Also, we need to check other constraints.

But this would satisfy the fourth constraint (stone1 is at pos24 in step4). Also, during step3, the stone is at pos23, which is a location. But another constraint is that pos23 must be not clear at some state, and before that, either pos53 or pos45 was not clear. So pos23 becomes not clear when the stone is there. So before pos23 is not clear (i.e., when the stone is at pos23), the agent must have had either pos53 or pos45 not clear in an earlier state. Let's see:

In the initial state, pos53 is clear. The agent starts at pos53, so when they move away, pos53 becomes clear. So initially, when the agent is at pos53, pos53 is not clear. Wait, the initial state says "Location pos53 is clear" but "player1 is at location pos53". Wait, no. Wait, the original state says "player1 is at location pos53" and "Location pos53 is clear". Wait, how can the agent be at pos53 and pos53 be clear? That seems contradictory. Wait, looking back:

Original state:

"player1 is at location pos53"

"Location pos53 is clear"

Wait, that's conflicting. If the agent is at pos53, then pos53 should not be clear. But according to the problem statement, the initial state says:

"player1 is at location pos53"

"Location pos53 is clear"

This must be a mistake, but according to the problem description, we have to take it as given. So pos53 is clear even though the agent is there. That might be a typo, but I have to proceed with the given information.

Wait, no. The "clear" condition probably refers to having no stones. Because the agent and stones are separate. So a location is clear if there is no stone there. The agent's presence doesn't affect the clearness. So the initial state has the agent at pos53, and pos53 is clear (no stone). The stone is at pos42, which is also clear (no agent or other stone). So in that case, when the agent moves, their new location becomes not clear (for the agent), but the stones are separate.

Wait, the effects of the move action: after moving, the agent is at l_to, so that location is no longer clear (presumably because the agent is there). But stones are separate. So "clear" refers to stones, or both agent and stones? Looking at the action effects:

For "move p l_from l_to d": effect (ii) location l_to is no longer clear (because the agent is there). Then, (iv) location l_from is clear (since the agent left). So "clear" refers to the presence of the agent or stones. Wait, the problem says "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So each location can have at most one entity: agent or stone or nothing. So "clear" means that there's nothing there. So when the agent is at a location, it's not clear. Similarly, if a stone is there, it's not clear.

But the initial state lists:

"player1 is at location pos53"

"stone1 is at location pos42"

"Location pos53 is clear"

Wait, that's impossible. If the agent is at pos53, then pos53 is not clear. So this must be a mistake in the problem statement. Or perhaps "clear" refers only to stones. Maybe the definition is that a location is clear if there's no stone. Because the agent is a different entity. So the initial state says pos53 is clear (no stone), which is correct since the agent is there but not a stone. Similarly, pos42 is clear (no stone?) No, the stone is at pos42. Wait, the initial state says:

"stone1 is at location pos42"

"Location pos42 is clear"

This is contradictory. Because if stone1 is at pos42, then pos42 is not clear. So this must be an error in the problem description. But the user provided this, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the terminology.

Wait, the problem says: "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So a location can have either the agent, a stone, or be empty. Therefore, a location is clear if it is empty. So when the agent is at a location, it's not clear. When a stone is there, it's not clear. So the initial state's description has contradictions, which is confusing. For example:

Original state:

"player1 is at location pos53"

"Location pos53 is clear"

This is a contradiction because if the agent is at pos53, pos53 is not clear. Similarly:

"stone1 is at location pos42"

"Location pos42 is clear"

Another contradiction. This suggests that the problem statement has errors. But since this is part of the given problem, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Maybe "clear" refers to the absence of stones, regardless of the agent. So a location is clear if there's no stone there. The agent's presence doesn't affect clearness. That would make sense. In that case, the initial state is correct: pos53 is clear (no stone), and the agent is there. pos42 has a stone, so it's not clear. But the problem states:

Original state:

"stone1 is at location pos42"

"Location pos42 is clear"

If "clear" means no stone, then pos42 can't be clear. But the problem says it is. So this is conflicting. I think this is a mistake in the problem statement, but I need to proceed.

Assuming that "clear" refers to the absence of both agent and stone. Then the initial state is impossible. But perhaps the problem has a different definition. Alternatively, maybe "clear" means that there's no stone, and the agent can be present. In that case, the agent's location is irrelevant to the clearness. But the actions' effects mention that after moving, the l_to is no longer clear (probably because the agent is there). So it's likely that "clear" means that neither the agent nor a stone is present. So a location is clear if it's empty.

But then, the initial state says:

"player1 is at location pos53"

"Location pos53 is clear"

Which is a contradiction. So this suggests that there's a mistake in the problem statement. Given that, I'll proceed under the assumption that "clear" refers to the absence of stones, and the agent's presence doesn't affect it. So when the agent moves to a location, it doesn't make it not clear. But the action's effects contradict that. For example, the "move" action's effect is that the location l_to is no longer clear (presumably because the agent is there). So this is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe "clear" refers to the absence of stones. The agent's presence is separate. So when pushing a stone, the destination must be clear (no stone), but the agent can be there. But according to the problem's action definitions, the preconditions for "move" require the destination to be clear. So if "clear" means no agent or stone, then the agent can't move to a location with a stone, which makes sense.

But given the contradictions in the initial state, perhaps the problem statement has errors, but I need to proceed with the given information.

Assuming that "clear" means the location has neither agent nor stone, then the initial state is impossible. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement's initial state. For example, maybe "Location pos42 is clear" is a mistake, and it should be "Location pos42 is not clear" because the stone is there. Similarly for pos53. But given that, I'll proceed as per the problem statement, assuming that the user made a mistake but I must follow their data.

So, the stone is at pos42, and pos42 is clear (contradiction), but according to the problem's initial state, we have to take it as given. Therefore, when the agent is at pos53, pos53 is clear (even though the agent is there). This suggests that "clear" refers only to stones. So a location is clear if there is no stone there. The agent's presence doesn't affect it. So the initial state makes sense:

- player1 is at pos53 (pos53 is clear because no stone is there)
- stone1 is at pos42 (pos42 is not clear, but the problem says it is clear. Contradiction again.)

This is really confusing. To resolve this, perhaps the problem statement's initial state has errors, but I must proceed. Let's assume that "clear" refers to the absence of stones. So a location is clear if there is no stone there. Then, the initial state's "Location pos42 is clear" is incorrect, but perhaps it's a typo and should be "not clear". But since I can't change the problem statement, I have to work with what's given.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial state lists all clear locations, and the presence of the agent or stone is separate. So the "clear" statements are about the absence of both agent and stone, but the agent and stone are listed separately. For example, the agent is at pos53, so pos53 is not clear, but the problem says it is. This is conflicting.

Given this confusion, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the problem as stated, ignoring the contradictions, and focusing on the actions and constraints.

Back to the fourth constraint: stone1 must be at pos24 or pos55 at some state. In the original plan, it's not. So the plan needs to include this. So perhaps after pushing the stone to pos22, the agent can push it to pos23, then to pos24. Then, from pos24, push to pos14, pos13, pos12, pos11.

This would add steps but satisfy the fourth constraint (stone1 at pos24). However, this also introduces pos23 being not clear when the stone is there, which is another constraint. Let's check constraint 6: pos23 must be not clear in some state, and before that, either pos53 or pos45 was not clear in an earlier state.

In the initial state, pos53 is clear (according to the problem statement). But the agent starts at pos53, so when the agent moves away, pos53 becomes clear (if clear means no agent). Wait, this is getting too tangled. Perhaps the key is that the constraint requires that before pos23 is not clear, there's a state where pos53 or pos45 is not clear.

In the modified plan where the stone is at pos23 (step3), then before that, in the initial state, pos53 is not clear (agent is there), so that satisfies the condition. Because when the agent is at pos53 (initial state), pos53 is not clear. Then, when the stone is at pos23 (later), the condition is met. So constraint6 is satisfied.

Another constraint is that pos23 must be not clear in at most one continuous sequence. So the stone can be at pos23 once and not return.

Now, fifth constraint: stone1 is at pos13 or pos14 is not clear. In the modified plan, when the stone is pushed to pos13 (step6), that satisfies it. Alternatively, if pos14 is not clear at some point. If the stone is at pos14, then pos14 is not clear. So in the modified plan, when the stone is at pos14 (step5), that would satisfy the fifth constraint. So either way, it's covered.

Sixth constraint: pos23 is not clear. Covered when stone is at pos23.

Seventh constraint: pos23's not clear must be preceded by pos53 or pos45 not clear. Since pos53 is not clear in the initial state (agent is there), this is satisfied.

Eighth constraint: pos52, pos22, pos23 not clear can only be in one continuous sequence. For pos23, when the stone is there, that's one continuous sequence. After pushing it to pos24, pos23 becomes clear again. So that's one sequence. Similarly for pos52 and pos22.

Ninth constraint: pos13 must always be clear. So when the stone is pushed to pos13 (step6), pos13 becomes not clear, violating the constraint. So this is a problem. Therefore, the modified plan where the stone is pushed to pos13 would violate the ninth constraint. So that's invalid.

Therefore, we need to adjust the plan to ensure that pos13 is always clear. So the stone cannot be moved to pos13. So the fifth constraint must be satisfied by pos14 not being clear. So in the plan, pos14 must be not clear at some state.

In the main plan without the detour to pos24, when the stone is pushed from pos14 to pos15, but pos14 is not a goal. But in the original plan, the stone goes from pos12 to pos11. So pos14 is not involved. So how to make pos14 not clear?

Alternatively, after the stone is at pos11, the agent can move to pos14, making it not clear. But the constraint requires that at some state, either pos14 is not clear or stone is at pos13. But pos13 must remain clear. So the only way is to make pos14 not clear.

So perhaps after the stone is at pos11, the agent moves to pos14. But that requires a path:

Agent at pos12 (after pushing to pos11) → pos22 (dir down?), then to pos23, pos24, pos14 (dir left). Then, agent at pos14 makes it not clear. But this is after the stone is already at pos11, so the fifth constraint is satisfied.

But this would require additional steps. So adding:

After the main plan (stone at pos11), the agent moves to pos14.

This would make pos14 not clear, satisfying the fifth constraint.

But the fifth constraint requires that in at least one state, either stone1 is at pos13 or pos14 is not clear. Since stone1 is at pos11, but the agent is at pos14, making it not clear. So that satisfies the fifth constraint.

So the plan would be:

1. Move agent from pos53 to pos43 (left)
2. Move agent from pos43 to pos42 (up)
3. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft) using pushtonongoal
4. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft)
5. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos12 (dirleft)
6. Push stone1 from pos12 to pos11 (dirup) using pushtogoal
7. Move agent from pos11 to pos12 (dirup?)
Wait, after step6, the agent is at pos12. Then, to get to pos14:

pos12 → pos22 (dirright down?), then pos22 → pos23 (dirdown), pos23 → pos24 (dirdown), pos24 → pos14 (dirleft). But pos24 to pos14: "You may move from location pos24 to location pos14 following direction dirleft". So yes.

So steps:

7. Move player1 from pos12 to pos22 (dirright? Or dir down? Wait, from pos12, the agent can move to pos22 via dirright. Let me check the movement rules.

Looking at the movement possibilities for pos12:

"You may move from location pos12 to location pos22 following direction dirright"

So, yes. So the agent can move from pos12 to pos22 via dirright.

Then from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown), then to pos24 (dirdown), then to pos14 (dirleft).

So:

7. move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright

8. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown

9. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown

10. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft

At step10, the agent is at pos14, making it not clear. This satisfies the fifth constraint.

Now, checking all constraints:

1. Player at pos32: yes, during step4 (pushing from pos32 to pos22).

2. When player is at pos32, pos34 must be not clear at some point after. After step4, the agent moves to pos22, then eventually to pos14. pos34 remains clear unless the agent moves there. So perhaps after step10, the agent needs to move to pos34.

But how?

After step10 (agent at pos14), to get to pos34:

pos14 → pos24 (dirright), pos24 → pos34 (dirright), etc.

But pos14 to pos24 is dirright? Let's check movement from pos14:

"You may move from location pos14 to location pos24 following direction dirright"

Yes. So:

11. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright

12. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright

13. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright (if needed)

But moving to pos34 would make it not clear. So after step12, pos34 is not clear, satisfying the second part of the first constraint.

So steps 11 and 12:

11. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright

12. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright

Now, after step12, pos34 is not clear, which satisfies the constraint.

3. pos43 or pos45 not clear: when the agent moves to pos43 in step1, pos43 becomes not clear. So that's covered.

4. stone1 at pos24 or pos55: in this plan, the stone is never at pos24 or pos55. So this constraint is not satisfied. Therefore, this plan is invalid.

Ah, this is a problem. So the fourth constraint requires that the stone is at pos24 or pos55 at some state. But in the current plan, the stone is moved directly to pos11 without passing through pos24 or pos55. Hence, this plan doesn't satisfy the fourth constraint. Therefore, the plan needs to be adjusted.

To satisfy the fourth constraint, the stone must be at pos24 or pos55 at least once. So perhaps after pushing the stone to pos22, the agent pushes it down to pos23, then to pos24. Then, from pos24, push it left to pos14, up to pos11. This way, the stone is at pos24.

Let's adjust the plan:

1. Move agent from pos53 to pos43 (left)
2. Move agent from pos43 to pos42 (up)
3. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft)
4. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft)
5. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown)
6. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown)
7. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos14 (dirleft)
8. Push stone1 from pos14 to pos13 (dirup) [But pos13 must remain clear. Conflict!]
Wait, pos13 must always be clear. So pushing the stone to pos13 would violate the ninth constraint. So this is invalid.

Therefore, after pos24, the stone can't be pushed to pos13. So instead, from pos24, push the stone up to pos14 (already there), then left to pos11.

Wait, pos14 to pos11: movement from pos14 to pos11 is dirup? Let's check movement rules for pos14:

"You may move from location pos14 to location pos24 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos14 to location pos13 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos14 to location pos15 following direction dirdown"

So from pos14, you can move up to pos13 or down to pos15, but not directly to pos11. So to get the stone from pos14 to pos11, the path would be pos14 → pos13 → pos12 → pos11.

But pushing to pos13 is not allowed because pos13 must remain clear. So this is impossible. Therefore, the stone must go from pos14 to pos15, then pos15 → pos25 → pos35 → pos45 → pos55, but this is a long detour.

Alternatively, after pos24, push the stone to pos14, then pos14 to pos15 (dirdown), pos15 to pos25 (dirright), pos25 to pos35 (dirright), pos35 to pos45 (dirright), pos45 to pos55 (dirright). Then, from pos55, push left to pos45, etc., but this is very long.

But this would allow the stone to reach pos55, satisfying the fourth constraint. However, this would make the plan much longer, which may not be optimal. But given the constraints, it's necessary.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos24, the agent could push it to pos25, pos35, pos45, pos55. Then, push it back. But this is not optimal.

Alternatively, after the stone is at pos24, the agent can push it to pos34, pos44, pos54, pos55. But pos34 is not a goal. Let's see:

From pos24, push right to pos34 (dirright). Then pos34 to pos44 (dirright), pos44 to pos54 (dirright), pos54 to pos55 (dirdown). But pos54 to pos55 is dirdown. Then, the stone is at pos55. This satisfies the fourth constraint.

So steps after step6 (stone at pos24):

7. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos34 (dirright) [pushtonongoal]
8. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos44 (dirright)
9. Push stone1 from pos44 to pos54 (dirright)
10. Push stone1 from pos54 to pos55 (dirdown)
11. Now, stone is at pos55. Then, need to get it to pos11.

But pos55 is a non-goal, so pushtonongoal. From pos55, push left to pos45, then pos45 to pos35, pos35 to pos25, pos25 to pos15, pos15 to pos14 (dirup), pos14 to pos13 (dirup), pos13 to pos12 (dirup), pos12 to pos11 (pushtogoal). But this is very long.

But the ninth constraint requires pos13 to always be clear, so pushing the stone to pos13 is invalid. Therefore, the stone cannot go through pos13. So alternative path from pos55 to pos45, pos35, pos25, pos15, pos14, then pos14 to pos11? But how?

From pos14 to pos11: can the stone be pushed directly? No. From pos14, the agent can push the stone up to pos13 (invalid) or down to pos15. So no direct path. Therefore, this approach is not feasible.

Alternatively, after pos55, the agent can push the stone back to pos45, then to pos35, pos25, pos15, pos14, pos24, pos23, pos22, pos12, pos11. This is very long and not optimal.

This seems impractical. Therefore, the only way to satisfy the fourth constraint is to have the stone pass through pos24 during its journey to pos11. But pushing the stone to pos24 would require pos13 to remain clear. So perhaps the path is:

pos42 → pos32 → pos22 → pos23 → pos24 → pos14 → pos11.

Wait, from pos24, can the stone be pushed left to pos14, then from pos14, up to pos11? No, because pos14 to pos11 requires moving west to pos13, but pos13 is clear. So the agent would need to push the stone from pos14 to pos11 directly. But according to the movement rules, from pos14, you can move to pos24 (dirright), pos13 (dirup), or pos15 (dirdown). There's no direct path from pos14 to pos11. Therefore, the only way to reach pos11 is through pos12.

But from pos14, the stone can be pushed down to pos15, then right to pos25, etc., but that's not helpful.

This is getting too complicated. Perhaps there's a different path that allows the stone to reach pos24 without violating the pos13 constraint.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos24, the agent can push it up to pos14, then left to pos13 (but pos13 must remain clear). So that's not allowed.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the optimal way is to accept that the stone must be moved to pos24, but ensure that pos13 remains clear. So after pushing to pos24, the agent must find another path to pos11 that doesn't involve pos13.

But I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should proceed with the initial plan and address the fourth constraint by having the agent move the stone to pos24 temporarily, even if it makes the plan longer.

But given the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible), this seems contradictory. However, due to the constraints, it's necessary.

So here's a possible plan:

1. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft
2. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos42 pos32 dirleft
   (Wait, no. The l_p must be adjacent to l_from. So to push from pos42 to pos32, the agent must be at pos42's right (pos52) or other adjacent positions. Wait, no. Wait, the agent is at pos42 (after moving there), then can push the stone left to pos32. But according to the action's preconditions, the agent must be at l_p (pos42), and l_from is pos42 (stone's current location). But the stone is at pos42. To push it, the agent must be adjacent to pos42 in the direction of the push. Wait, the preconditions for pushtonongoal require that the agent is at l_p, which must be reachable from l_from via direction d. Wait, no: the action's preconditions are (iv) you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d. So the agent must be at l_p, which is adjacent in the direction d to l_from.

For example, to push the stone from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft), the agent must be at a location l_p that is to the right of pos42 (pos52) and move left to pos42. But the agent is at pos42. So this is not possible. Therefore, the agent must first move to pos52 to push the stone left.

Ah, this is a mistake in my earlier reasoning. The agent cannot push the stone from the same location. They must be adjacent. So the agent must be at pos52 to push the stone from pos42 to pos32. Therefore, the initial steps are:

1. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft
2. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
   (Now, agent is at pos42. Stone is at pos42. But the agent and stone can't be at the same location. So this is invalid. Therefore, the initial steps are wrong.)

Wait, this is a critical error. The agent cannot be at the same location as the stone. The initial state has the agent at pos53 and the stone at pos42. When the agent moves to pos42, they can't if the stone is there. So the initial steps are invalid. Therefore, my previous plan is incorrect.

So the correct approach is:

The agent must navigate to a position adjacent to the stone to push it. Since the stone is at pos42, the agent can approach from pos52 (east), pos32 (west), pos41 (north), or pos43 (south).

The agent starts at pos53. To get to pos52, which is up from pos53. Then, from pos52 to pos42 (left). So:

1. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup
2. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft

This is valid. After this, the agent is at pos42, and the stone is at pos32.

Then, to push the stone from pos32 to pos22, the agent needs to be at pos32's east (pos42), so:

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft

After this, the agent is at pos32, and the stone is at pos22.

Now, the fourth constraint requires the stone to be at pos24 or pos55. So after pos22, push it down to pos23, then to pos24:

4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos23 dirdown
   (Agent moves from pos32 to pos22, pushes stone to pos23. Now agent is at pos22.)

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown
   (Agent moves from pos22 to pos23, pushes stone to pos24. Now agent is at pos23.)

Now, the stone is at pos24, satisfying the fourth constraint.

Then, push the stone to pos14:

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos14 dirleft
   (Agent moves from pos23 to pos24, pushes stone to pos14. Agent is now at pos24.)

Then, push the stone to pos11:

From pos14, the path to pos11 is via pos12. But pos14 to pos12 is not directly connected. So agent needs to move around.

But pos14 can be pushed to pos13 (dirup), but pos13 must remain clear. So that's not allowed. So alternative path: pos14 → pos15 → pos25 → pos35 → pos45 → pos55 → ... etc. Not optimal.

Alternatively, from pos14, the agent can push the stone to pos13 (invalid), or pos15. So pushing to pos15:

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos14 pos15 dirdown
   (Agent moves from pos24 to pos14, pushes stone to pos15. Now agent is at pos14.)

Then, from pos15, push to pos25:

8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos15 pos25 dirright
   (Agent moves from pos14 to pos15, pushes stone to pos25. Agent is at pos15.)

Then, from pos25, push to pos35:

9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos15 pos25 pos35 dirright
   (Agent at pos15, pushes to pos35. Now at pos25.)

Then, from pos35 to pos45:

10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos35 pos45 dirright
    (Agent at pos25, pushes to pos45. Now at pos35.)

Then, from pos45 to pos55:

11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos55 dirright
    (Agent at pos35, pushes to pos55. Now at pos45.)

Now, the stone is at pos55, satisfying the fourth constraint.

But we need to get it to pos11. From pos55, push left to pos45, then pos35, pos25, pos15, pos14, pos24, pos23, pos22, pos12, pos11. This is very long and not optimal.

But given the constraints, it's necessary. However, this plan is far from optimal, and the problem requires an optimal plan. Therefore, there must be a different approach.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos24 (step5), the agent can push it to pos14, then pos14 to pos11 directly. But according to movement rules, pos14 can't go directly to pos11. So that's impossible.

Alternative approach: After the stone is at pos24, push it to pos34 (dirright), then pos44 (dirright), pos54 (dirright), then pos55 (dirdown). Then, the stone is at pos55. Then, the agent can push it back through pos45, pos35, etc., towards pos11. But this is very long.

Given the time constraints, I think the correct plan must involve the stone being pushed to pos24, and then finding a way to push it to pos11 without violating pos13's clearance. But I'm struggling to find such a path.

Alternatively, perhaps the fourth constraint can be satisfied by having the stone briefly at pos55 during its journey. For example, after pos42 to pos32 to pos22 to pos12 to pos11, but that doesn't help. Or maybe a detour to pos55.

But how? The stone starts at pos42. To get to pos55, the path would be pos42 → pos43 → pos44 → pos45 → pos55. But pos43 is clear, so the agent can push it there.

Let's try:

1. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft
2. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos43 dirdown
   (Agent is at pos43, pushes stone down to pos43? Wait, no. The stone is at pos42, and the agent is at pos43 (south of pos42). To push the stone down to pos43, direction dirdown.

Preconditions for pushtonongoal:

- agent at pos43 (l_p)
- stone at pos42 (l_from)
- to push to pos43 (l_to), which is south of pos42. So direction from l_p (pos43) to l_from (pos42) is dirup. Then, direction from l_from to l_to is dirdown. But pos43 is a non-goal, so pushtonongoal.

So action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos43 dirup dirdown.

Wait, the direction in the action is the direction from l_p to l_from (dirup), and the direction from l_from to l_to (dirdown). But the action's format is "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d". So direction d must be the same for both movements? Or are there two directions involved?

Wait, the action's parameters are "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d". The preconditions are:

(iv) you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d.

(v) you can get from l_from to l_to following direction d.

So the direction d is the same for both legs. Therefore, to push from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown), the agent must be at l_p such that l_p → l_from (pos42) via direction d (dirdown). But l_p would have to be pos41 (north of pos42), because moving dirdown from pos41 to pos42. Wait, no. The movement directions are a bit confusing.

Wait, the movement from pos41 to pos42 is dirdown. So if the agent is at pos41, they can move down to pos42. Then, pushing the stone down to pos43 would require direction dirdown. So the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos43 dirdown.

But the agent is initially at pos53. To get to pos41, they need to move up and left.

Alternatively, the agent can push the stone from pos42 to pos43 if the agent is south of pos42 (pos43) and pushes north. But according to the movement rules, the agent can move from pos43 to pos42 via dirup. So direction d is dirup. Then, pushing the stone from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown). But the action requires the same direction for both movements. So this is not possible.

Therefore, to push the stone south to pos43, the agent must be north of pos42 (pos41) and move south (dirdown) to pos42, pushing the stone south (dirdown) to pos43.

So steps:

1. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft
2. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup (but pos42 has the stone. Can't move there. So invalid.)

Ah, right. The agent can't move into a location with the stone. So the agent must navigate around.

To push the stone from pos42 to pos43, the agent must be at pos41 or pos43. But pos41 is north of pos42. To get there, the agent needs to move from pos53 to pos43, then to pos42 (invalid), or another path.

Alternative path to pos41:

pos53 → pos43 (left)

pos43 → pos33 (left)

pos33 → pos32 (up)

pos32 → pos31 (up)

pos31 → pos41 (right)

But this is a long path. Then, the agent can push the stone from pos42 to pos43.

So steps:

1. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft
2. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
3. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
4. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup
5. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos43 dirdown

Now, the stone is at pos43. Then, push it further south to pos44:

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirdown (but the agent is at pos41, need to move to pos43's north to push south. So agent must move to pos43's north, which is pos42. But pos43's north is pos42, which is now clear (stone was pushed to pos43). So agent can move to pos42.

Steps:

7. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirdown

Then, push to pos54, pos55:

9. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirup
10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirright
11. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirup
12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos54 pos55 dirdown

Now, stone is at pos55 (satisfies fourth constraint). Then, push back to pos45, pos35, etc., towards pos11. But this is very long.

This plan satisfies the fourth constraint but is not optimal. However, given the constraints, it might be necessary.

But given the time I've spent and the complexity, I think the optimal plan involves pushing the stone to pos24 and then to pos14, but ensuring pos13 remains clear. However, due to the ninth constraint, the stone can't be at pos13. So, after pos24, push to pos14, then to pos15, pos25, pos35, pos45, pos55. But this is not optimal.

Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with a plan that satisfies all constraints, even if it's longer, and then check if it's optimal.
