Okay, let's see. The problem is to move the stone1 from pos42 to a goal location. The only goal location mentioned is pos11. So the final goal is to have stone1 at pos11. The initial state has the agent at pos53, and stone1 at pos42. All other locations seem clear except where the agent and stone are. 

First, I need to figure out how to get the agent to the stone. The agent is at pos53. The stone is at pos42. Let me look at the movement paths. 

Looking at the allowed moves from pos53: You can move to pos43 (dirleft), pos52 (dirup), or pos54 (dirdown). But pos54 is clear. So maybe first move up to pos52? Wait, but the agent needs to reach pos42. Let's map out a path from pos53 to pos42.

From pos53, the agent can move dirup to pos52. From pos52, moving dirleft would take them to pos42? Wait, according to the movement rules, moving from pos52 to pos42 requires direction dirleft. Let me check: The movement list says "You may move from location pos52 to location pos42 following direction dirleft". Yes. So if the agent is at pos52, they can move left to pos42. But wait, pos42 currently has stone1, so the agent can't move there directly because the location isn't clear. So the agent needs to push the stone.

Wait, the stone is at pos42. So the agent can't move into pos42 unless they are pushing the stone. So to push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent to it in the direction they want to push. So the agent needs to get to a position adjacent to the stone, then push it towards the goal.

The stone is at pos42. The adjacent positions would be pos41 (up), pos43 (down), pos32 (left), or pos52 (right? Wait, no. Let me check the grid layout. The positions are labeled as posXY where X is the row and Y the column. So pos42 is row 4, column 2. Adjacent positions would be pos32 (row 3, column 2) to the north (dirup?), pos52 (row 5, column 2) to the south (dirdown?), pos41 (row4, column1) to the west (dirleft), and pos43 (row4, column3) to the east (dirright). Wait, the directions might vary based on how movement is defined. Let me check the movement directions.

Looking at pos42's movements: From pos42, you can move to pos32 (dirleft?), no. Wait, the movement from pos42 is listed as:

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"

Wait, moving from pos42 to pos32 is direction dirleft. So pos32 is to the left of pos42. So pos42 is at (4,2), and pos32 is (3,2), which would be up one row. Hmm, maybe directions are a bit different. Maybe dirleft corresponds to moving left in terms of columns, but rows might vary. Wait, perhaps the directions are a bit abstract here. For example, moving from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft. So pos32 is left of pos42. So in this grid, perhaps columns increase from left to right, rows increase from top to bottom. So pos11 is top-left, pos15 is top-right, pos51 is bottom-left, etc.

So pos42 is row4, column2. Moving dirleft from pos42 would take you to pos32 (row3, column2), which is up. Hmm, maybe the directions are not standard. Because in the movement list, from pos42, moving dirleft takes you to pos32, which is up a row. So in this case, dirleft is actually moving up, and dirright is moving down? Or maybe the directions are named based on how they are connected. This is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the movement directions are defined such that moving from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft, which would mean that the agent is moving to the left in terms of the grid layout. But if pos42 is (4,2), then pos32 is (3,2), which is one row up, so maybe the directions are more like dirup and dirdown. Wait, but the movement from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft. Hmm. Let me check another example. For pos32, the movement options are:

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos31 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown"

So from pos32, dirleft takes you to pos22 (row2, column2), which is up again. Dirright takes you to pos42 (row4, column2), which is down. Dirup takes to pos31 (row3, column1), which is left. Dirdown takes to pos33 (row3, column3), which is right. So directions here are a bit different. It seems that dirleft and dirright might correspond to moving up and down in rows, while dirup and dirdown correspond to moving left and right in columns. That's a bit counterintuitive, but perhaps that's how it's structured here.

So, for example, moving from pos42 dirleft goes to pos32 (row3, column2), which is up. Dirright from pos42 would be to pos52 (row5, column2), which is down. Dirup from pos42 would be to pos41 (row4, column1), left in the column. Dirdown from pos42 would be to pos43 (row4, column3), right in the column.

Wait, but the movement directions are given as:

From pos42, you can move to pos32 (dirleft), pos52 (dirright), pos41 (dirup), pos43 (dirdown).

Wait, that's according to the movement list:

- "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"

- "You may move from location pos42 to location pos52 following direction dirright"

- "You may move from location pos42 to location pos41 following direction dirup"

- "You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown"

So, dirleft and dirright correspond to moving along the row (changing the row number), while dirup and dirdown correspond to moving along the column (changing the column number). So, for example, dirleft from pos42 (row4, column2) takes you to pos32 (row3, column2), which is up. Dirright takes you to pos52 (row5, column2), down. Dirup takes you to pos41 (row4, column1), left in the same row. Dirdown takes you to pos43 (row4, column3), right in the same row. So the directions are a bit different: dirleft/right are vertical (changing row), dirup/down are horizontal (changing column). This is important for planning movement.

So the agent is at pos53. Let's see where pos53 is: row5, column3. The stone is at pos42 (row4, column2). The goal is to get the stone to pos11 (row1, column1), which is a goal location.

So the agent needs to move from pos53 to a position adjacent to the stone, then push it towards the goal.

First, the agent is at pos53. Let's check possible moves. From pos53, the agent can move dirleft to pos43, dirup to pos52, or dirdown to pos54. Let's see which path leads towards pos42.

If the agent moves from pos53 to pos43 (dirleft), then pos43 is row4, column3. From there, can they move dirup (which would decrease the column number by 1, moving to pos42 (row4, column2)? Wait, dirup from pos43 would be column3-1=2, so row4, column2, which is pos42. So if the agent is at pos43, moving dirup would take them to pos42. But pos42 is currently occupied by the stone, so they can't move there unless they are pushing the stone.

So the plan is: agent moves to pos43, then pushes the stone from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft direction). Wait, but pos32 is a non-goal location. Then they need to push it further towards pos11.

But wait, the stone is at pos42. To push it towards the goal (pos11), the agent needs to move it in the direction that gets it closer. Since pos11 is row1, column1, the stone needs to move up (dirleft) to pos32, then to pos22, pos12, then pos11. But pos12 is a non-goal location, but pos11 is the goal. So the path for the stone would be pos42 → pos32 (dirleft) → pos22 (dirleft) → pos12 (dirleft) → pos11 (dirup? Because from pos12, dirup would decrease column, but pos11 is row1, column1. Wait, let's check the movement from pos12.

From pos12, dirup would take to pos11. Because moving dirup from pos12 (row1, column2) would decrease the column by 1 to column1, so pos11. So yes, from pos12, dirup is pos11. But the agent needs to be able to push the stone from pos12 to pos11, which is a goal location.

So the steps would be:

1. Agent moves from pos53 to pos43 (dirleft).
2. From pos43, push the stone at pos42 to pos32 (dirleft). But wait, the agent is at pos43, which is adjacent to pos42 (since pos43 is row4, column3; pos42 is row4, column2). To push the stone from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft direction), the agent would need to be on pos42's right side (dirright direction). Wait, no. To push the stone in a certain direction, the agent must be adjacent to the stone in the opposite direction. For example, to push the stone north (dirleft), the agent must be south of the stone (dirright), so that pushing north would move the stone. Wait, maybe the direction here is the direction the agent is pushing. So if the agent is at pos43 (east of the stone at pos42), and wants to push the stone west (dirleft), then the direction for the push would be dirleft. But the agent needs to be adjacent to the stone in the direction they are pushing. Wait, no. The preconditions for pushtogoal or pushtonongoal require that the agent is at location l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's current location) such that l_p to l_from is following direction d. Then, the stone moves from l_from to l_to following the same direction d. So for example, if the agent is at pos43 (east of pos42), and wants to push the stone west (dirleft), then the direction d would be dirleft. Wait, but from pos43 to pos42 is dirup (since pos43 is row4, column3, and pos42 is row4, column2; moving from column3 to 2 is dirup). So the direction from pos43 to pos42 is dirup. Then, the direction from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft. So the push action would require the agent to be at l_p (pos43), pushing the stone from l_from (pos42) to l_to (pos32) with direction d (dirleft). But the preconditions require that the agent can get from l_p to l_from following direction d. Wait, the preconditions for pushtonongoal (since pos32 is a non-goal) are: (iv) you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d. So in this case, from pos43 (l_p) to pos42 (l_from) following direction d. The movement from pos43 to pos42 is possible via dirup. So direction d here would be dirup. Then, the stone is pushed from pos42 (l_from) to l_to in direction d (dirup). Wait, but dirup from pos42 would take it to pos41 (since dirup decreases the column number by 1). But pos41 is row4, column1. So if the agent is at pos43 (dirup from pos42 is pos41), but the stone is at pos42. To push the stone to pos32 (dirleft direction), the agent needs to be south of the stone (pos52, perhaps) to push it dirleft (north). Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Let me re-examine the movement directions. For the stone at pos42, to push it to pos32 (which is dirleft from pos42), the agent needs to be at pos42's dirright side (pos52), because moving dirleft from pos42 is to pos32. Wait, but dirright from pos42 is pos52. So the agent must be at pos52 to push the stone dirleft (to pos32). Because the agent has to be adjacent to the stone in the direction opposite to the push direction. Alternatively, the agent must be in a position that allows them to move in direction d to reach the stone's location.

Wait, the precondition for pushtogoal/pushtonongoal is (iv) you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d. So the agent is at l_p, and direction d is the direction from l_p to l_from. Then, the stone is pushed from l_from to l_to following direction d. Wait, that's not right. Because the direction from l_p to l_from is d, and the direction from l_from to l_to is also d. So if the agent is at l_p, moves direction d to reach l_from (stone's location), and then the stone is pushed direction d from l_from to l_to. So the agent is behind the stone relative to the direction of the push. 

For example, if the agent is at pos52 (south of pos42), and direction d is dirup (since from pos52 to pos42 is dirup), then pushing the stone dirup from pos42 would take it to pos32 (since from pos42, dirup is moving to pos32). Wait, no. From pos42, dirup is to pos41. Wait, no:

Looking at the movement from pos42 to pos41 is dirup. So if the agent is at pos52 (south of pos42), direction d would be dirup (from pos52 to pos42 is dirup?), no. Wait, the movement from pos52 to pos42 is dirleft. Because pos52 is row5, column2. Moving dirleft from pos52 would go to pos42 (row4, column2). So direction d is dirleft. So if the agent is at pos52, and direction d is dirleft, then they can move to pos42. Then, pushing the stone from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft) would be possible. 

So to push the stone from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft), the agent needs to be at a location l_p such that moving direction d from l_p gets to pos42, and moving direction d from pos42 gets to pos32. In this case, direction d is dirleft. So the agent must be at a location from which moving dirleft reaches pos42. That would be pos43 (since moving dirleft from pos43 would be to pos42? No, wait. From pos43, moving dirleft would be to pos42? Let's check the movement directions for pos43:

From pos43, the directions are:

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown"

Wait, moving from pos43 to pos42 is dirup. So direction dirup. So if the agent is at pos43, and direction dirup, they can move to pos42. Then, pushing the stone from pos42 in direction dirup would take it to pos41. But that's not towards the goal. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, the agent could be at pos32 (north of pos42) and push the stone dirright (south to pos42→pos52), but that's away from the goal. So perhaps the correct approach is to have the agent approach from the east (pos43) and push the stone west (dirleft to pos32). Wait, but how?

Wait, let's think again. The stone is at pos42. The agent needs to push it towards pos32 (dirleft from pos42). To do that, the agent must be at a location l_p such that moving direction d from l_p reaches pos42, and moving direction d from pos42 reaches pos32. The direction d here would be dirleft. Because from pos42, dirleft is to pos32. So the agent must be at a location l_p where moving dirleft leads to pos42. Which locations are those?

Looking at the movement list, any location that can move dirleft to pos42. Let's check:

Looking through the movement options, the only movement to pos42 via dirleft is from pos52: "You may move from location pos52 to location pos42 following direction dirleft".

So pos52 can move dirleft to pos42. So if the agent is at pos52, they can move dirleft to pos42 (if it's clear). But pos42 has the stone, so they can't move there. Therefore, the agent needs to push the stone. So the agent must be at pos52, and then push the stone dirleft from pos42 to pos32. But wait, the stone is at pos42. The agent is at pos52. To push the stone dirleft (to pos32), the agent must be able to move from their current position (pos52) to pos42 via direction d (which is dirleft), and the stone moves from pos42 to pos32 via dirleft.

So the action would be pushtonongoal (since pos32 is not a goal) player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft. 

But for that, the agent needs to be at pos52. Currently, the agent is at pos53. So the steps would be:

1. Move from pos53 to pos52 (dirup). Because from pos53, moving dirup (column decreases by 1, since pos53 is row5, column3. Dirup would take to pos52 (row5, column2). 

Check movement options: From pos53, "You may move from location pos53 to location pos52 following direction dirup". Yes. So move player1 from pos53 to pos52 via dirup.

Now the agent is at pos52. Then, perform pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft. 

Check preconditions:

(i) agent is at pos52: yes.

(ii) stone1 is at pos42: yes.

(iii) pos32 is clear: initial state says pos32 is clear (original state lists "Location pos32 is clear" as part of the original state, except for pos42 and pos53 which are occupied by stone and agent. Wait, the original state lists "Location pos42 is clear" but that's a mistake. Wait, original state says:

The original state of the world includes:

- "player1 is at location pos53"

- "stone1 is at location pos42"

Then, the list of clear locations includes "Location pos42 is clear" — wait, that's a contradiction. Because if stone1 is at pos42, then pos42 is not clear. But in the original state, under "The original state of the world is the following", it says "Location pos42 is clear". But that can't be right, because the stone is there. Wait, looking back:

Original state:

- "player1 is at location pos53"

- "stone1 is at location pos42"

Then, in the list of clear locations:

"Location pos11 is clear"

...

"Location pos41 is clear"

"Location pos43 is clear"

...

"Location pos42 is clear"

Wait, that's conflicting. Because if stone1 is at pos42, then pos42 is not clear. So this must be an error in the problem statement. But according to the given data, the original state says "Location pos42 is clear". But that's impossible because the stone is there. This could be a mistake. Or perhaps "clear" means something else, like no agent or stones? Wait, the problem statement says "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So a location is clear if it's empty. Therefore, if a stone is at pos42, pos42 is not clear. But the original state lists "Location pos42 is clear" which contradicts the stone's presence. This is a problem. 

Wait, the user-provided problem says:

The original state of the world includes:

"player1 is at location pos53"

"stone1 is at location pos42"

Then, under clear locations:

"Location pos42 is clear"

But that's a contradiction. So this must be an error. However, perhaps the problem statement is correct and "clear" refers to something else. Alternatively, maybe the initial state is that pos42 is clear except for the stone. But that doesn't make sense. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, but we have to proceed with the given information. According to the problem statement, the initial state says:

"Location pos42 is clear"

But stone1 is at pos42. That's conflicting. Maybe the problem statement has a typo, and pos42 is not clear. Let me check again.

Looking back:

The original state lists:

"player1 is at location pos53"

"stone1 is at location pos42"

Then, the clear locations include:

"Location pos11 is clear"

...

"Location pos41 is clear"

"Location pos43 is clear"

...

"Location pos51 is clear"

"Location pos52 is clear"

"Location pos54 is clear"

"Location pos55 is clear"

"Location pos42 is clear"

"Location pos53 is clear"

Wait, but pos53 has the player1, so it's not clear. Similarly, pos42 has the stone1, so it's not clear. So this must be an error. But since the user provides this data, perhaps the correct initial state is that pos53 is not clear (since player1 is there) and pos42 is not clear (stone1 is there). The other locations are clear as listed. So this is a mistake in the problem statement, but we have to proceed with what's given.

Assuming that the initial state is correct as stated, even if contradictory, perhaps "clear" refers to not containing an agent. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe "clear" means that the location is accessible for movement, but the presence of a stone doesn't block movement. But according to the preconditions for move action, the location must be clear (i.e., no agent or stone). So this is confusing.

Given the problem as stated, we have to take the initial state as given. So according to the problem, pos42 is clear despite the stone being there. That's a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, and pos42 is not clear. Alternatively, maybe the stone's presence doesn't block the location from being considered clear. But that's not logical. 

This is a critical point because if pos42 is clear, then the agent can move there, but the stone is there, which would not be allowed. So perhaps the correct initial state is that pos42 is not clear (since the stone is there), but the problem statement mistakenly lists it as clear. In that case, we have to proceed under the assumption that the stone's location is not clear. 

Alternatively, the problem statement might have a typo, and pos42 is not listed as clear. Let's check again the original state's clear locations:

The user wrote:

"Location pos42 is clear"

But stone1 is at pos42. Therefore, this is an error. In a correct problem, pos42 would not be clear. But given that the user provided this, we have to proceed. However, in reality, the presence of the stone would make pos42 not clear. So perhaps the user made a mistake, but for solving the problem, we need to assume that the stone is at pos42, and pos42 is not clear. But the problem says pos42 is clear. This is conflicting. 

This is a major issue. But perhaps the problem statement intended that the stone's location is not clear. Let's assume that despite the statement "Location pos42 is clear", the stone's presence makes it not clear. Because otherwise, the problem is impossible. So pos42 is occupied by the stone, so it's not clear. Therefore, when the agent is moving, they can't move into pos42 unless they are pushing the stone. 

Given that, the initial state is:

- Agent at pos53.

- Stone at pos42.

- All other locations are clear except pos53 (agent) and pos42 (stone).

Now, back to the plan. The agent needs to get to a position where they can push the stone towards the goal. Let's assume that pos42 is not clear (stone is there), so the agent can't move into pos42 unless pushing. 

So the agent is at pos53. To reach pos52: move from pos53 to pos52 (dirup). Then, from pos52, push the stone at pos42 to pos32 (dirleft). 

But pos32 is clear (original state lists it as clear). So the push action would be pushtonongoal, since pos32 is not a goal. Then, the stone is at pos32. Now, the agent is at pos42 after the push. From there, the agent needs to move to a position to push the stone further towards pos22.

So next steps: agent is at pos42. Then, move to pos32 (dirleft). Wait, but after pushing, the agent moves to pos42 (from pos52). Then, to push the stone from pos32 to pos22, the agent needs to be south of pos32 (pos42) and push dirleft again. So from pos32, pushing dirleft would take it to pos22. So the agent would need to be at pos32's right (dirleft direction). Wait, the agent is at pos42, which is south of pos32. To push the stone north (dirleft) from pos32 to pos22, the agent needs to be at pos32's south (pos42), and move dirleft to pos32. So the push action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft. 

But first, after the first push, the agent is at pos42. Then, they can move to pos32 (if it's clear). After the first push, pos32 now has the stone. So pos32 is not clear. So the agent cannot move there. So the agent is at pos42 and needs to push the stone from pos32 to pos22. But the agent is at pos42, which is south of pos32. To push the stone north (dirleft) from pos32 to pos22, the agent must be at a position that allows them to push in that direction. 

Alternatively, after the first push, the agent is at pos42. Then, they can move west (dirup) to pos41, or east (dirdown) to pos43, or south (dirright) to pos52. Wait, directions are a bit tricky here. From pos42, the agent can move:

- dirleft to pos32 (but pos32 is now occupied by the stone, so can't move there)

- dirright to pos52 (possible if pos52 is clear. After the first move, pos52 was cleared when the agent moved to pos52, but after pushing, the agent is now at pos42. So pos52 is clear again. So the agent can move dirright to pos52. Then from pos52, perhaps move dirleft to pos42 again, but pos42 is now clear (since the agent moved away). Wait, no: after the first push, the agent is at pos42. The stone is at pos32. So pos42 is now clear (agent is there, so not clear). Wait, no: after the push action, the effects are:

For pushtonongoal:

- agent is no longer at l_p (pos52)

- stone is no longer at l_from (pos42)

- l_to (pos32) is no longer clear

- agent is now at l_from (pos42)

- stone is at l_to (pos32)

- l_p (pos52) is clear.

So after pushing, the agent is at pos42, which was previously the stone's location. But since the stone is moved to pos32, pos42 is now occupied by the agent. So pos42 is not clear anymore. Therefore, the agent is at pos42. Now, to move again, they need to go to a clear location.

From pos42, the available moves are:

- dirleft to pos32 (occupied by stone1, can't move there)

- dirright to pos52 (clear, since after the push, pos52 is clear)

- dirup to pos41 (clear, according to initial state)

- dirdown to pos43 (clear, according to initial state)

So the agent can move from pos42 to pos41, pos43, or pos52.

To continue pushing the stone towards the goal, the agent needs to get to a position where they can push the stone from pos32 to pos22. The stone is at pos32. To push it dirleft (to pos22), the agent must be at a position l_p from which they can move dirleft to pos32, which would be pos42. Because from pos42, moving dirleft takes you to pos32. So the agent is currently at pos42. So they can push the stone from pos32 to pos22 dirleft.

Wait, but the agent is at pos42. To push the stone at pos32, they need to be at a location l_p such that moving dirleft from l_p reaches pos32. The only location that can move dirleft to pos32 is pos42 (since "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"). So the agent is already at pos42. So they can perform pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft.

Checking preconditions:

(i) agent is at pos42: yes.

(ii) stone is at pos32: yes.

(iii) pos22 is clear: initial state lists pos22 as clear.

(iv) can move from pos42 to pos32 via dirleft: yes.

(v) can move from pos32 to pos22 via dirleft: yes, because "You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft".

(vi) pos22 is not a goal location: correct.

So this action is valid. After this, the stone is at pos22, and the agent is at pos32.

Now, the stone is at pos22. The next step is to push it to pos12 (dirleft), then to pos11 (dirup). 

So the agent is now at pos32. To push the stone from pos22 to pos12, the agent needs to be at a location l_p from which they can move dirleft to pos22. That would be pos32. Because from pos32, moving dirleft takes you to pos22. So the agent is at pos32. So they can perform pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft.

Preconditions check:

(i) agent at pos32: yes.

(ii) stone at pos22: yes.

(iii) pos12 is clear: initial state says pos12 is clear.

(iv) can move from pos32 to pos22 dirleft: yes.

(v) can move from pos22 to pos12 dirleft: yes (check movement list: "You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft").

(vi) pos12 is not a goal: correct.

After this, the stone is at pos12, agent at pos22.

Next, push the stone to pos11 (dirup). Because pos11 is a goal location, so this would be a pushtogoal action.

The agent is at pos22. The stone is at pos12. To push it to pos11 (dirup), since from pos12, dirup is to pos11. So the agent needs to be at a location l_p from which moving dirup reaches pos12. From pos22, moving dirup would be to pos21 (row2, column1). No, wait: pos22 is row2, column2. dirup from pos22 would decrease the column by 1 to column1, so pos21. But pos12 is row1, column2. To reach pos12 from l_p via dirup, the agent must be at pos13 (row1, column3), moving dirup (column decreases by 1) to pos12. Alternatively, the direction from pos22 to pos12 is dirleft. Wait, the movement directions for pos22 include:

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft".

So dirleft from pos22 takes you to pos12. So to push the stone from pos12 to pos11, the agent needs to be at a location l_p from which moving dirup reaches pos12. For example, pos13. But the agent is currently at pos22. So the agent needs to move from pos22 to pos12 (dirleft), but pos12 has the stone. So they can't move there. Alternatively, the agent needs to go around.

Wait, the stone is at pos12. The agent is at pos22. To push the stone from pos12 to pos11 (dirup), the agent must be south of pos12 (pos22), but dirup from pos12 is to pos11. So the agent needs to be at pos12's south, which is pos22. But how? Let me check the movement from pos22 to pos12 is dirleft. So the agent is at pos22. To push the stone from pos12 to pos11, the agent must be at pos12's direction opposite to the push direction. The push direction is dirup (from pos12 to pos11). So the agent must be at pos12's dirdown direction, which is pos13. Wait, no. Because dirup from pos12 is to pos11 (column decreases by 1). Dirdown from pos12 is to pos13 (column increases by 1). So to push the stone dirup to pos11, the agent must be at pos12's dirdown direction (pos13), and move dirup to pos12, then push the stone dirup to pos11. 

But currently, the agent is at pos22. How to get to pos13? That's a long path. Let's see:

From pos22, the agent can move to pos12 via dirleft, but pos12 has the stone. So they can't move there. They need to find another route. Let's think of the agent's path from pos22 to pos13. pos22 → pos23 (dirdown), then pos23 → pos13 (dirleft), but pos13 is clear. Let's check:

pos22 can move dirdown to pos23. From pos23, can move dirleft to pos13. So agent moves from pos22 → pos23 (dirdown), then pos23 → pos13 (dirleft). Now agent is at pos13. From there, they can push the stone from pos12 to pos11 dirup. 

But the stone is at pos12. The agent is at pos13. To push the stone dirup (to pos11), the agent must be at pos13 and push the stone from pos12 to pos11. The direction from pos13 to pos12 is dirup (since pos13 is row1, column3, moving dirup would decrease column to 2 → pos12). So direction d is dirup. Then, the stone is pushed from pos12 to pos11 dirup. 

So the action would be pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirup. 

Check preconditions:

(i) agent at pos13: yes.

(ii) stone at pos12: yes.

(iii) pos11 is clear: initial state says pos11 is clear, but after previous steps, pos11 may still be clear.

(iv) can move from pos13 to pos12 dirup: yes.

(v) can move from pos12 to pos11 dirup: yes.

(vi) pos11 is a goal location: yes.

So this action is valid. After this, the stone is at pos11 (goal), agent is at pos12.

Now the goal is achieved. 

Putting it all together, the steps are:

1. Move from pos53 to pos52 (dirup).

2. Pushtonongoal from pos52 to pos42, pushing stone1 to pos32 (dirleft).

3. Pushtonongoal from pos42 to pos32, pushing stone1 to pos22 (dirleft).

4. Move from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft? Wait, after step 2, the agent is at pos42. Wait, no. Let's retrace.

Wait, after step 1: agent is at pos52.

Step 2: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft. After this, the agent is at pos42.

Step 3: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft. Agent moves to pos32.

Step 4: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft. Agent moves to pos22.

Step 5: Now, agent is at pos22. Stone is at pos12. Agent needs to get to pos13 to push the stone to pos11. So:

5. Move from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown).

6. Move from pos23 to pos13 (dirleft).

7. Pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirup.

But this makes the plan longer. Is there a shorter path?

Alternatively, after step 4, the stone is at pos12. The agent is at pos22. From pos22, can the agent move to pos12 via dirleft? No, because pos12 has the stone. So the agent needs to go around. Let's see:

From pos22, agent can move to pos23 (dirdown), then pos23 to pos13 (dirleft), then pos13 to pos12 (dirup) if possible. But pos12 has the stone, so they can't move there. So the agent must push. 

So steps 5-7 are necessary. That's a total of 7 actions. But maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternative approach: After pushing the stone to pos12, the agent is at pos22. Instead of going through pos23 and pos13, can they go to pos21 and then pos11?

Wait, pos21 is row2, column1. From pos22, can the agent move dirup to pos21. Then from pos21, move dirup to pos11. But pos11 is clear. So agent moves from pos22 → pos21 (dirup), then pos21 → pos11 (dirup). Then, agent is at pos11. From there, can they push the stone from pos12 to pos11? Because the agent is at pos11, which is north of pos12. So to push the stone from pos12 to pos11, the agent must be south of pos12 (pos22), but they're at pos11. Alternatively, the agent can push from pos12's east (pos13) or west (pos11). Wait, pos11 is west of pos12 (since pos12 is row1, column2; pos11 is row1, column1). So to push the stone from pos12 to pos11 (west), the agent needs to be east of pos12 (pos13), and push west (dirleft). 

So the agent at pos11 can't push the stone west. So that approach doesn't work. 

So the only way is for the agent to go to pos13 and push from there. Hence, steps 5-7 are needed. 

Alternatively, after step 4 (stone at pos12, agent at pos22), the agent can move from pos22 to pos12 (dirleft) if it's possible. But pos12 has the stone, so they can't move there. Hence, the agent needs to go around. 

Thus, the total plan is 7 actions. But maybe there's a shorter way. Let's see:

Alternative path after step 4:

After step 4, agent is at pos22. From there, move to pos23 (dirdown), then to pos33 (dirright), then to pos34 (dirdown?), but that's getting away from the goal. No, perhaps better to move to pos23, then pos13, then push. That's what I thought earlier. So steps 5-7.

So the plan would be:

1. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup

2. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos22 dirleft [Wait, no. After step 2, the stone is at pos32. So step 3 should be pushing from pos32 to pos22.]

Wait, no. After step 2, the stone is at pos32. The agent is at pos42. So step 3 would be pushing from pos32 to pos22. But to do that, the agent must be at pos32's south (pos42), and push dirleft (north). But pos32 is at row3, column2. So to push it to pos22 (row2, column2), direction dirleft. The agent is at pos42 (row4, column2). How can they push the stone from pos32 to pos22? 

Wait, the agent is at pos42. The stone is at pos32. The agent needs to get to a position where they can push the stone north. For that, the agent needs to be south of pos32 (pos42), and push north. But the direction from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft. So the agent can push the stone from pos32 to pos22 dirleft by being at pos32's south (pos42), and moving dirleft to pos32. Wait, no. To push the stone from pos32 to pos22, the agent must be at a location l_p from which they can move dirleft to pos32. The only such location is pos42. Because "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft". So the agent is at pos42. So they can perform pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft. 

Yes. So step 3 is pushtonongoal from pos42 to pos32, pushing to pos22. After this, the agent is at pos32. 

Then, step 4: push from pos22 to pos12. The agent is at pos32. To push the stone from pos22 to pos12, the agent must be at pos22's south (pos32), and push dirleft (north). So the action is pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft. 

After this, the agent is at pos22. 

Then, step 5: move from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown).

Step 6: move from pos23 to pos13 (dirleft).

Step 7: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirup.

This results in the stone at pos11, achieving the goal. 

So the plan has 7 actions. But is there a way to optimize this?

Wait, maybe after step 3, the agent is at pos32. The stone is at pos22. Can the agent move from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft) if it's clear? But pos22 has the stone, so it's not clear. So no. 

Alternative approach after step 3: agent is at pos32. They need to push the stone from pos22 to pos12. To do that, they need to be at pos22's south (pos32), and push dirleft. So step 4 is pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft. 

After step 4, agent is at pos22. 

Then, steps 5-7 as before. 

So the plan is:

1. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup

2. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft

4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft

5. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown

6. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft

7. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirup

But wait, step 3: after step 2, the agent is at pos42. Step 3 is pushtonongoal from pos42 to pos32, pushing to pos22. Yes. 

Then step 4 is pushtonongoal from pos32 to pos22, pushing to pos12. But wait, after step 3, the agent is at pos32. So step 4 is pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft. 

Yes. Then step 5 is moving to pos23, etc. 

So that's 7 steps. Can we reduce this?

Let me see: After step 4, the stone is at pos12. The agent is at pos22. Instead of moving to pos23 and pos13, can the agent move directly from pos22 to pos12's east (pos13) via some path? 

From pos22, the agent can move to pos23 (dirdown), then to pos33 (dirright), then to pos34 (dirdown), etc. But that seems longer. Alternatively, from pos22 to pos12's east (pos13) via pos23 and pos13. 

Alternatively, after step 4, agent is at pos22. To reach pos13, the agent can move:

pos22 → pos23 (dirdown)

pos23 → pos13 (dirleft)

Then, push to pos11. 

That's two moves and one push, totaling 3 actions (steps 5,6,7). So total 7 steps. 

I don't see a shorter path. Therefore, the optimal plan is 7 actions.
