Let's first understand the problem. I have a 2D square grid (5x5 in this case, based on the locations from pos11 to pos55). I have a player and a stone, and I need to move the stone to a goal location. 

Starting positions:
- player1 is at pos53
- stone1 is at pos42
- The goal location is pos11

I'll need to move the player to push the stone to the goal. Let's first understand the structure of the grid. Based on the available moves, I can infer:
- dirdown means moving down a row (e.g., from pos11 to pos12)
- dirup means moving up a row (e.g., from pos12 to pos11)
- dirright means moving right a column (e.g., from pos11 to pos21)
- dirleft means moving left a column (e.g., from pos21 to pos11)

The grid looks like this:
```
11 21 31 41 51
12 22 32 42 52
13 23 33 43 53
14 24 34 44 54
15 25 35 45 55
```
Player is at pos53, which is in the 3rd row and 5th column. Stone is at pos42, which is in the 2nd row and 4th column. Goal is at pos11, which is in the 1st row and 1st column.

Now let's go through the constraints:
1. The player must be at pos32 at some point.
2. If the player is at pos32, pos34 must not be clear at that state or after.
3. stone1 must be at pos42 at some point (which it is initially).
4. If stone1 is at pos42, it must later be at pos45 or pos54 is not clear.
5. At some point, pos43 or pos45 must not be clear.
6. At some point, stone1 must be at pos55 or pos24.
7. At some point, stone1 must be at pos13 or pos14 is not clear.
8. At some point, pos23 must not be clear.
9. If pos23 is not clear, then before that, pos53 or pos45 must not be clear.
10. pos52 can only be not clear for one continuous sequence.
11. pos22 can only be not clear for one continuous sequence.
12. pos23 can only be not clear for one continuous sequence.
13. pos13 must always be clear.

These constraints add complexity to the problem. I need to plan a path from pos42 to pos11 for the stone, while ensuring all these constraints are met.

Let's think about how to get the stone from pos42 to pos11. I'll need to push the stone, and for that, I need to be on the opposite side of where I want to push. For example, to push the stone from pos42 to pos32, I need to be at pos52. I'll plan a broad path for the stone:
- Start at pos42
- Move to pos32 (to satisfy constraint 1)
- Move to pos22
- Move to pos12
- Move to pos11 (goal)

But I also need to meet the other constraints. Let's think about them as I plan.

First, let's see if we can get the player to pos52 to push the stone from pos42 to pos32.

I can move the player like this:
1. Move player1 from pos53 to pos52 (dirup)
2. Now the player is at pos52 and can push the stone from pos42 to pos32, satisfying constraint 1.

But we also need to ensure constraint 2, which says if the player is at pos32, pos34 must not be clear. This doesn't seem directly achievable since the player will be at pos32 and I'm not sure how to make pos34 not clear at the same time. Let me reconsider.

Actually, there's another interpretation: I can move the player to pos32 (to satisfy constraint 1), and then later make pos34 not clear. 

Constraint 3 is already satisfied as stone1 is at pos42 initially.

Constraint 4 says if stone1 is at pos42, it must later be at pos45 or pos54 is not clear. Given that the stone starts at pos42, I need to either move it to pos45 or make pos54 not clear at some point.

Constraint 5 says at some point, pos43 or pos45 must not be clear. This could be achieved by having the stone or player at one of these positions.

Constraint 6 says at some point, stone1 must be at pos55 or pos24. This suggests I might need to move the stone to one of these positions in my plan.

Constraint 7 says at some point, stone1 must be at pos13 or pos14 is not clear.

Constraint 8 says at some point, pos23 must not be clear.

Constraint 9 says if pos23 is not clear, then before that, pos53 or pos45 must not be clear. Initially, the player is at pos53, so it's not clear, which satisfies this condition.

Constraints 10, 11, and 12 limit how many times certain positions can be "not clear".

Constraint 13 says pos13 must always be clear, so I can't move the stone or player there.

Let's try to plan a sequence of moves that satisfies all these constraints.

Given the various constraints, let's reconsider our approach. Instead of directly trying to plan the entire sequence, I'll try to figure out a path that satisfies all the constraints.

I'll break down the path I want the stone to take:
1. Start at pos42.
2. Move through a path that satisfies all the constraints.
3. End at pos11.

Given the constraints, here's a tentative path for the stone:
- pos42 -> pos32 (satisfies constraint 1 with the player at pos32)
- pos32 -> pos22 (pos22 can be not clear for one continuous sequence, constraint 11)
- pos22 -> pos12 (pos13 must always be clear, constraint 13)
- pos12 -> pos11 (goal)

But I also need to satisfy constraint 6 (stone must be at pos55 or pos24) and constraint
7 (stone must be at pos13 or pos14 is not clear). Constraint 6 suggests I should either move the stone to pos55 or pos24 at some point.

Let's reconsider. From the initial position, the stone is at pos42 and the player is at pos53. 

Given constraint 4, from pos42 the stone must go to pos45 or make pos54 not clear. Let's choose to move it to pos45.

Given constraint 6, from pos45 the stone could go to pos55 (since stone1 must be at pos55 or pos24).

Given constraint 7, from pos55, we might need to eventually move the stone to pos13 (since stone1 must be at pos13 or pos14 is not clear), but that would conflict with constraint 13 (pos13 must always be clear). Therefore, we probably need to make pos14 not clear instead. This could be by having the player at pos14 at some point.

Let's plan a path with these constraints in mind.

Starting from the initial positions:
- stone1 is at pos42
- player1 is at pos53

1. Let's move the player to pos43 (up):
   move player1 pos53 pos43 dirup

2. Let's move the player to pos42 (left):
   move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft

3. Let's move the player to pos32 (left), satisfying constraint 1:
   move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
   
   At this point, the player is at pos32 and the stone is still at pos42. We need to make pos34 not clear (constraint 2).

4. Let's move the player to pos33 (down):
   move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown

5. Let's move the player to pos34 (down), making pos34 not clear, satisfying constraint 2:
   move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown

6. Let's move the player to pos44 (right):
   move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

7. Let's move the player to pos43 (up):
   move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

8. Let's move the player from pos43 to pos53 (right):
   move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright

9. Now let's push the stone from pos42 to pos43 (down), making pos43 not clear, satisfying constraint 5:
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos42 pos43 dirleft

10. Let's push the stone from pos43 to pos44 (down):
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos44 dirdown

11. Let's push the stone from pos44 to pos45 (down), satisfying constraint 4:
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos44 pos45 dirdown

12. Let's push the stone from pos45 to pos55 (right), satisfying constraint 6:
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos45 pos55 dirdown

13. Now, the stone is at pos55 and the player is at pos45. Let's move the player to pos44 (up):
    move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup

14. Move player to pos34 (left):
    move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft

15. Move player to pos24 (left):
    move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft

16. Move player to pos14 (left), making pos14 not clear, satisfying constraint 7:
    move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft

17. Move player to pos13 (up):
    move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup

18. Move player to pos23 (right), making pos23 not clear, satisfying constraint 8:
    move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright

19. Move player to pos33 (right):
    move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright

20. Move player to pos43 (right):
    move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright

21. Move player to pos53 (right):
    move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright

22. Move player to pos54 (down):
    move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown

23. Now, the player is at pos54 and the stone is at pos55. Let's push the stone from pos55 to pos54 (up):
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos55 pos54 dirup

24. Push the stone from pos54 to pos53 (up):
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos54 pos53 dirup

25. Push the stone from pos53 to pos43 (left):
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos53 pos43 dirleft

26. Push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (left):
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos33 dirleft

27. Push the stone from pos33 to pos23 (left), making pos23 not clear, satisfying constraint 8 again. This is technically a second time, but the constraint says it can be not clear for one continuous sequence, so this should be okay:
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos23 dirleft

28. Push the stone from pos23 to pos22 (up), making pos22 not clear, satisfying constraint 11:
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos23 pos22 dirup

29. Push the stone from pos22 to pos12 (left):
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos22 pos12 dirleft

30. Push the stone from pos12 to pos11 (up), reaching the goal:
    pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos12 pos11 dirup

That's a tentative plan. Let's see if it meets all the constraints.

Constraint 1: The player must be at pos32 at some point (satisfied in step 3).
Constraint 2: If the player is at pos32, pos34 must not be clear at that state or after (satisfied in step 5).
Constraint 3: stone1 must be at pos42 at some point (satisfied initially).
Constraint 4: If stone1 is at pos42, it must later be at pos45 or pos54 is not clear (satisfied in step 11).
Constraint 5: At some point, pos43 or pos45 must not be clear (satisfied in step 9 for pos43 and in step 11 for pos45).
Constraint 6: At some point, stone1 must be at pos55 or pos24 (satisfied in step 12).
Constraint 7: At some point, stone1 must be at pos13 or pos14 is not clear (satisfied in step 16).
Constraint 8: At some point, pos23 must not be clear (satisfied in step 18 and step 27).
Constraint 9: If pos23 is not clear, then before that, pos53 or pos45 must not be clear (satisfied as pos53 is not clear initially, and pos45 is not clear in step 11).
Constraint 10: pos52 can only be not clear for one continuous sequence (satisfied as we never make pos52 not clear).
Constraint 11: pos22 can only be not clear for one continuous sequence (satisfied as we only make pos22 not clear in step 28).
Constraint 12: pos23 can only be not clear for one continuous sequence (satisfied as we make pos23 not clear in steps 18 and 27, but we got the interpretation wrong here as we're not allowed to make pos23 not clear a second time).
Constraint 13: pos13 must always be clear (satisfied as we never make pos13 not clear).

Alright, I made a mistake with Constraint 12. It says "The following expression must hold in at most one continuous sequence of states", which means pos23 can be not clear for at most one continuous sequence of states. 

Let me check Constraint 12 again. The constraint says pos23 can be not clear for at most one continuous sequence. In my plan, I make pos23 not clear in steps 18 and 27, which is two separate sequences. Let's revise.

I need to plan so that pos23 is only not clear for one continuous sequence. Let's revise from step 16:

16. Move player to pos15 (down):
    move player1 pos24 pos15 dirdown

17. Move player to pos25 (right):
    move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright

18. Move player to pos35 (right):
    move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright

19. Move player to pos45 (right):
    move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright

20. Move player to pos55 (right):
    move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright

21. Now, the player is at pos55 and the stone is also at pos55. This doesn't work.

Hmm, I need to think more carefully about the path. Let's go back and reconsider. 

Actually, now that I think about it, the constraint "Location pos23 is not clear" can only happen once. So, I can't make pos23 not clear in two separate sequences.

Let's revisit the constraints once more:

1. The player must be at pos32 at some point.
2. If the player is at pos32, pos34 must not be clear at that state or after.
3. stone1 must be at pos42 at some point (already satisfied initially).
4. If stone1 is at pos42, it must later be at pos45 or pos54 is not clear.
5. At some point, pos43 or pos45 must not be clear.
6. At some point, stone1 must be at pos55 or pos24.
7. At some point, stone1 must be at pos13 or pos14 is not clear.
8. At some point, pos23 must not be clear.
9. If pos23 is not clear, then before that, pos53 or pos45 must not be clear.
10. pos52 can only be not clear for one continuous sequence.
11. pos22 can only be not clear for one continuous sequence.
12. pos23 can only be not clear for one continuous sequence.
13. pos13 must always be clear.

Let's reconsider the path for the stone:
- Start at pos42.
- Move to pos32 (with the player at pos32, satisfying constraint 1).
- Move to other positions as needed to satisfy all constraints.
- End at pos11.

I think a better approach would be to first satisfy the constraints related to the player's position, and then plan the stone's path to the goal.

Given that there are restrictions on making pos22, pos23, and pos52 not clear (they can only be not clear for one continuous sequence), I should be careful when the stone passes through these positions.

Here's a revised plan:

Starting from the initial positions:
- stone1 is at pos42
- player1 is at pos53

1. Let's move the player to pos43 (up):
   move player1 pos53 pos43 dirup

2. Let's move the player to pos33 (left):
   move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft

3. Let's move the player to pos32 (up), satisfying constraint 1:
   move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup

4. Let's move the player to pos33 (down):
   move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown

5. Let's move the player to pos34 (down), making pos34 not clear, satisfying constraint 2:
   move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown

6. Let's move the player to pos24 (left):
   move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft

7. Let's move the player to pos14 (left), making pos14 not clear, satisfying constraint 7:
   move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft

8. Let's move the player to pos24 (right):
   move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright

9. Let's move the player to pos34 (right):
   move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright

10. Let's move the player to pos44 (right):
    move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

11. Let's move the player to pos45 (down), making pos45 not clear, satisfying constraint 5:
    move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown

12. Let's move the player to pos44 (up):
    move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup

13. Let's move the player to pos54 (right):
    move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright

14. Let's move the player to pos53 (up):
    move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup

15. Now let's push the stone from pos42 to pos43 (down):
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos42 pos43 dirleft

16. Let's push the stone from pos43 to pos44 (down):
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos44 dirdown

17. Let's push the stone from pos44 to pos45 (down), satisfying constraint 4:
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos44 pos45 dirdown

18. Let's push the stone from pos45 to pos55 (right), satisfying constraint 6:
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos45 pos55 dirdown

19. Now, the stone is at pos55 and the player is at pos45. Let's move the player to pos44 (up):
    move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup

20. Move player to pos43 (up):
    move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

21. Move player to pos33 (left):
    move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft

22. Move player to pos23 (left), making pos23 not clear, satisfying constraint 8:
    move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft

23. Move player to pos24 (down):
    move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown

24. Move player to pos34 (right):
    move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright

25. Move player to pos44 (right):
    move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

26. Move player to pos54 (right):
    move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright

27. Now, the player is at pos54 and the stone is at pos55. Let's push the stone from pos55 to pos54 (up):
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos55 pos54 dirup

28. Push the stone from pos54 to pos44 (left):
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos54 pos44 dirleft

29. Push the stone from pos44 to pos34 (left):
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos44 pos34 dirleft

30. Push the stone from pos34 to pos24 (left), satisfying constraint 6 again:
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos34 pos24 dirleft

31. Push the stone from pos24 to pos23 (up), making pos23 not clear, satisfying constraint 8 again. This is the second time, which violates constraint 12. I'll have to revise.

Let's reconsider our approach. We need to be careful about pos23 being not clear, as it can only happen once.

Let's backtrack to the point where the stone is at pos55 and the player is at pos45 (after step 18). Instead of trying to go through pos23, let's try a different path.

Let's try to bring the stone to pos11 through a different path, perhaps via the top row.

Actually, before doing that, let's make sure I understand constraint 12. It says: "The following expression must hold in at most one continuous sequence of states: 'Location pos23 is not clear'". This means pos23 can be made not clear only once, and once I make it clear again, I can't make it not clear in another part of my plan.

Here's a better approach. Instead of the player making pos23 not clear in step 22, I'll have the stone do it as it moves towards the goal.

Let's revise from step 18:

19. Now, the stone is at pos55 and the player is at pos45. Let's move the player to pos44 (up):
    move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup

20. Move player to pos43 (up):
    move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

21. Move player to pos33 (left):
    move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft

22. Move player to pos34 (down):
    move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown

23. Move player to pos44 (right):
    move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

24. Move player to pos54 (right):
    move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright

25. Now, the player is at pos54 and the stone is at pos55. Let's push the stone from pos55 to pos54 (up):
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos55 pos54 dirup

26. Push the stone from pos54 to pos44 (left):
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos54 pos44 dirleft

27. Push the stone from pos44 to pos34 (left):
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos44 pos34 dirleft

28. Push the stone from pos34 to pos24 (left), satisfying constraint 6 again:
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos34 pos24 dirleft

29. Push the stone from pos24 to pos23 (up), making pos23 not clear:
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos24 pos23 dirup

30. Push the stone from pos23 to pos22 (up), making pos22 not clear:
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos23 pos22 dirup

31. Push the stone from pos22 to pos12 (left):
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos22 pos12 dirleft

32. Push the stone from pos12 to pos11 (up), reaching the goal:
    pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos12 pos11 dirup

Let's check the constraints again:

Constraint 1: The player must be at pos32 at some point (satisfied in step 3).
Constraint 2: If the player is at pos32, pos34 must not be clear at that state or after (satisfied in step 5).
Constraint 3: stone1 must be at pos42 at some point (satisfied initially).
Constraint 4: If stone1 is at pos42, it must later be at pos45 or pos54 is not clear (satisfied in step 17 for pos45 and in step 25 for pos54).
Constraint 5: At some point, pos43 or pos45 must not be clear (satisfied in step 11 for pos45 and in step 15 for pos43).
Constraint 6: At some point, stone1 must be at pos55 or pos24 (satisfied in step 18 for pos55 and in step 28 for pos24).
Constraint 7: At some point, stone1 must be at pos13 or pos14 is not clear (satisfied in step 7 for pos14).
Constraint 8: At some point, pos23 must not be clear (satisfied in step 29).
Constraint 9: If pos23 is not clear, then before that, pos53 or pos45 must not be clear (satisfied as pos53 is not clear initially, and pos45 is not clear in step 11).
Constraint 10: pos52 can only be not clear for one continuous sequence (satisfied as we never make pos52 not clear).
Constraint 11: pos22 can only be not clear for one continuous sequence (satisfied as we only make pos22 not clear in step 30).
Constraint 12: pos23 can only be not clear for one continuous sequence (satisfied as we only make pos23 not clear in step 29).
Constraint 13: pos13 must always be clear (satisfied as we never make pos13 not clear).

It seems all the constraints are now satisfied.

I just realized I might be understanding Constraint 12 a bit differently. This constraints reads: "The following expression must hold in at most one continuous sequence of states: 'Location pos23 is not clear.'" If I'm understanding this right, it means that after pos23 becomes not clear, it must be clear after some finite number of steps, and once it becomes clear, it can't become not clear again. Given that we make pos23 not clear in step 29 and then push the stone out in step 30, we're good.

Actually, let's just double check all steps in the plan one more time to make sure I didn't have any contradictions or logical errors.

Starting from the initial positions:
- stone1 is at pos42
- player1 is at pos53

1. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirup
   - player1 is at pos43, stone1 is at pos42

2. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
   - player1 is at pos33, stone1 is at pos42

3. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
   - player1 is at pos32, stone1 is at pos42
   - Constraint 1 satisfied

   - Constraint 7 satisfied (pos14 is not clear)

8. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
   - player1 is at pos24, stone1 is at pos42

9. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
   - player1 is at pos34, stone1 is at pos42

    - player1 is at pos44, stone1 is at pos42

11. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown
    - player1 is at pos45, stone1 is at pos42
    - Constraint 5 satisfied (pos45 is not clear)

12. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
    - player1 is at pos44, stone1 is at pos42

13. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
    - player1 is at pos54, stone1 is at pos42

14. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
    - player1 is at pos53, stone1 is at pos42

15. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos42 pos43 dirleft
    - player1 is at pos42, stone1 is at pos43
    - Constraint 5 satisfied (pos43 is not clear)

16. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirdown
    - player1 is at pos43, stone1 is at pos44

17. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirdown
    - player1 is at pos44, stone1 is at pos45
    - Constraint 4 satisfied (stone1 is at pos45)

18. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos45 pos55 dirdown
    - player1 is at pos45, stone1 is at pos55

    - player1 is at pos12, stone1 is at pos11
    - Stone is at the goal location

The plan seems to be logically consistent.

There's still one issue I'm concerned about, which is the interpretation of the action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos42 pos43 dirleft". The "dirleft" suggests we're going from pos42 to pos32, not from pos42 to pos43. Let me check the action descriptions more closely.

According to the action description:
"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.
"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to non-goal location l_to, following direction d.

So, "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos42 pos43 dirleft" would mean the agent is at pos53, the stone is at pos42, and we're pushing it to pos43, following direction dirleft. However, this doesn't make sense since dirleft is moving in the grid from right to left (like from pos21 to pos11), not from pos42 to pos43.

Reading the preconditions more carefully, I see:
"You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d"

This means the direction d refers to both the direction from agent to stone and from stone to destination. Thus, "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos42 pos43 dirleft" means the agent is at pos53, the stone is at pos42, the agent pushes the stone to pos43, and both the direction from agent to stone and from stone to destination is dirleft. But this doesn't make sense in the context of our grid.

I think I've been understanding the directions incorrectly. Let's reconsider the directions based on the provided information.

The original state includes information like:
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

This means:
- dirright means moving right in the grid (increasing column).
- dirdown means moving down in the grid (increasing row).
- dirleft means moving left in the grid (decreasing column).
- dirup means moving up in the grid (decreasing row).

Alright, let's revise the grid visualization based on this:
```
11 21 31 41 51
12 22 32 42 52
13 23 33 43 53
14 24 34 44 54
15 25 35 45 55
```

In this grid, the directions mean:
- dirright: Increasing column (e.g., from pos11 to pos21).
- dirdown: Increasing row (e.g., from pos11 to pos12).
- dirleft: Decreasing column (e.g., from pos21 to pos11).
- dirup: Decreasing row (e.g., from pos12 to pos11).

Now, looking at the preconditions for "pushtogoal" and "pushtonongoal", the direction d is used for both:
- Direction from agent to stone.
- Direction from stone to destination.

So, for an action like "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos42 pos43 dirleft", the direction dirleft should allow us to get from pos53 to pos42 and from pos42 to pos43. But this isn't possible in our grid.

Let me check the available moves in the original state:
"You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft"
This means we can move from pos53 to pos43 following dirleft. This aligns with decreasing the column.

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown"
This means we can move from pos42 to pos43 following dirdown. This aligns with increasing the row.

So, to push the stone from pos42 to pos43, the player should be at a position such that the direction from player to stone and from stone to destination is the same. Since the stone is initially at pos42 and we want to move it to pos43, and pos43 is below pos42, the direction should be dirdown. For the player to push the stone in this direction, the player should be above the stone, which is at pos32. But the player is currently at pos53, which is to the right of the stone.

Let's rethink our strategy. To push the stone from pos42 to pos43, the player should be at pos32. Then, the action would be "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos43 dirdown".

Let's update the plan:

Starting from the initial positions:
- stone1 is at pos42
- player1 is at pos53
