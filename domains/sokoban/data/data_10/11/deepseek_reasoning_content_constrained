Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get stone1 to a goal location, which is pos51. The initial state has the player at pos21 and stone1 at pos32. So the main task is moving stone1 to pos51. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy. Let me go through each constraint one by one and see how they affect the plan.

First, the constraints that need to be true at least once:

1. At least one state where pos54 isn't clear or player1 is at pos54.
2. Player1 must be at pos42 in some state.
3. Stone1 must be at pos42 in some state.
4. Stone1 must be at pos51 in some state (since that's the goal, but also a constraint).
5. At least one state where either stone1 is at pos41 or pos14 isn't clear.
6. A state where both player1 is at pos25 and pos31 isn't clear.
7. Pos53 must be not clear in some state.
8. Player1 must be at pos43 in some state.

Then, the conditional constraints:

- If player1 is at pos42, then they must be at pos25 either then or later.
- If stone1 is at pos42, then either stone1 is back at pos32 or pos45 is not clear later.
- If pos52 isn't clear, then player1 must reach pos15 after.
- If stone1 is at pos51, then pos44 was not clear earlier.
- If pos53 isn't clear, then earlier pos54 wasn't clear or player was at pos25.
- If player is at pos43, then stone1 must be at pos31 after.

Also, pos43 being not clear can only happen in one continuous sequence. So we can't have pos43 being occupied, then clear, then occupied again.

Let me start by figuring out the main path. Stone1 is at pos32. To get it to pos51, which is a goal location. The path from pos32 to pos51: pos32 can go right to pos42, then right to pos52, then right to pos51? Wait, but directions are given. Let me check the movement possibilities.

Looking at the allowed moves for pos32: can move left to pos22, right to pos42, up to pos31, down to pos33. So to get stone1 to pos51, maybe we need to push it right multiple times. From pos32 to pos42 (using pushtonongoal if pos42 is non-goal), then to pos52 (also non-goal), then to pos51 (goal, so pushtogoal). But pos51 is the goal. So the sequence would be:

1. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos42 (non-goal), then to pos52 (non-goal), then to pos51 (goal). But each push requires the agent to be adjacent and in the right position.

But the agent starts at pos21. Let's see the path for the agent to get to pos32's direction. To push stone1 from pos32 to pos42 (right), the agent needs to be at pos32's left (pos31 or pos22?), wait, the direction for pushing. Wait, the "pushtonongoal" action requires that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (where the stone is) in direction d. For example, to push the stone from pos32 to pos42 (dirright), the agent needs to be at pos32's left (dirright direction means moving from left to right?), so the agent would be at pos32's left, which is pos31? Wait, the movement direction definitions need to be checked.

Wait, the movement from pos32 to pos42 is possible if the agent is at pos32 and moves right. Wait, no. The "You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright" implies that moving right from pos32 takes you to pos42. So if the agent is at pos32 and moves right, they go to pos42. But for pushing, the agent needs to be adjacent to the stone's current position in the direction opposite to the push. For example, to push the stone right from pos32 to pos42, the agent must be at pos32's left (pos22?) or up/down? Wait, no. Let me check the movement directions.

Wait, for pos32, the allowed moves are:

- left to pos22 (dirleft)
- right to pos42 (dirright)
- up to pos31 (dirup)
- down to pos33 (dirdown)

So if the agent is at pos32 and pushes the stone right (dirright) to pos42, the agent must be at pos32's left, which would be pos22. Because to push the stone right, the agent is to the left of the stone (pos32's left is pos22), then pushes it right. Wait, no. Let me think again. The preconditions for "pushtonongoal" require that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (stone's current location) in direction d. Wait, direction d is the direction from l_p to l_from. So to push the stone from l_from (pos32) to l_to (pos42) following direction d (dirright), the agent must be at l_p (pos32's left, which is pos22?), because to move from pos22 to pos32 is direction dirright. Wait, the movement connections: from pos22 to pos32 is dirright. So if the agent is at pos22, and wants to push the stone from pos32 to pos42 (dirright), the direction from l_p (pos22) to l_from (pos32) is dirright. So the action would be "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright".

Wait, that makes sense. The agent is at pos22, pushes the stone from pos32 (to their right) to pos42 (further right). So the agent moves from pos22 to pos32 (as part of the push), and the stone moves to pos42. After this action, the agent is at pos32, and the stone is at pos42. Then, to push the stone further to pos52, the agent needs to get to pos42's left (pos32) again. Wait, no. To push the stone from pos42 to pos52 (dirright), the agent needs to be at pos42's left (pos32?), and direction dirright. But can the agent get to pos32 from pos32? Wait, after the first push, the agent is at pos32. Then, maybe move to pos42's left, which is pos32? Wait, pos42's left is pos32? Because moving from pos32 to pos42 is dirright, so pos42's left is pos32. So to push from pos42 to pos52 (dirright), the agent would be at pos42's left (pos32) but that's not adjacent. Wait, no. The movement from pos42 to pos52 is dirright, so the agent must be at pos42's left, which is pos32. Wait, but pos42's left is pos32? Because pos32 is to the left of pos42. But according to the movement connections, moving from pos32 to pos42 is dirright, which implies pos42 is to the right of pos32. So pos42's left is pos32. Therefore, to push the stone from pos42 to pos52 (dirright), the agent must be at pos32. But how does the agent get to pos32 after the first push?

Wait, after the first push (from pos32 to pos42), the agent is at pos32. Then, they can move around. To push the stone from pos42 to pos52, the agent needs to be at pos42's left (pos32) and move in dirright. But if the agent is already at pos32, maybe they can do that. Wait, but the stone is at pos42. So the agent is at pos32, and the stone is at pos42. The agent can then move to pos42's left (pos32) and push the stone right. Wait, but the agent is already at pos32. So the action would be "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos52 dirright"? Let me check the preconditions for that action.

The preconditions for "pushtonongoal" are:

1. Agent is at l_p (pos32)
2. Stone is at l_from (pos42)
3. l_to (pos52) is clear
4. Can move from l_p (pos32) to l_from (pos42) via direction d (dirright)
5. Can move from l_from (pos42) to l_to (pos52) via direction d (dirright)
6. l_to is non-goal.

Checking the movement connections: from pos32 to pos42 is allowed via dirright. From pos42 to pos52 is allowed via dirright. And pos52 is a non-goal location. So this action would be valid. So after this, the stone is at pos52, and the agent is at pos42. Then, from there, push to pos51 (which is a goal location). So "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos52 pos51 dirright". Let's check the preconditions:

1. Agent is at pos42
2. Stone is at pos52
3. pos51 is clear
4. Can move from pos42 to pos52 via dirright (yes, as per the connections)
5. Can move from pos52 to pos51 via dirright? Wait, according to the movement connections, from pos52 you can move up to pos51 (dirup) or down to pos53 (dirdown), or left to pos42 (dirleft), but dirright from pos52 would go to pos53? Wait, the movement directions need to be checked. Looking back:

Looking for "You may move from location pos52 to ...". From the original state:

"You may move from location pos52 to location pos42 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos52 to location pos51 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos52 to location pos53 following direction dirdown"

So to go from pos52 to pos51, the direction is dirup, not dirright. So pushing the stone from pos52 to pos51 would require direction dirup. Therefore, the agent needs to be at pos52's down direction (pos53?) to push it up. Wait, no. The direction for the push is from l_p (agent's location) to l_from (stone's location). So to push the stone from pos52 to pos51 (dirup), the agent needs to be at pos52's down (pos53), and push upwards. But the movement from pos53 to pos52 is dirup? Let's check:

Looking for pos53's movements: "You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos53 to location pos52 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown". So yes, moving from pos53 to pos52 is dirup.

So to push the stone from pos52 to pos51 (dirup), the agent must be at pos53 (south of pos52), push up. But the agent would need to get to pos53 first. Let's see. After pushing the stone to pos52, the agent is at pos42. Then they need to move to pos53. How?

From pos42, the agent can move to pos43 via dirdown, then to pos53 via dirdown? Let's see the movement options:

From pos42: can move left (dirleft) to pos32, right (dirright) to pos52 (but stone is there now?), up (dirup) to pos41, or down (dirdown) to pos43. Wait, original movement connections for pos42:

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos42 to location pos52 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos42 to location pos41 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown"

So after the stone is at pos52, the agent is at pos42. To get to pos53, they need to move to pos43 (dirdown), then to pos53 (dirdown). But from pos43, the movement to pos53 is dirright (since pos43 to pos53 is dirright? Wait, looking at pos43's movements: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown". So from pos43 to pos53 is dirright. So agent at pos42 can move down to pos43, then right to pos53. Then, from pos53, they can push the stone from pos52 to pos51 (dirup). But wait, the stone is at pos52, and the agent is at pos53. So the direction from agent's location (pos53) to stone's location (pos52) is dirup. So the action would be "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos52 pos51 dirup". Because pos51 is a goal location. Let's check the preconditions:

1. Agent is at pos53: yes.
2. Stone is at pos52: yes.
3. pos51 is clear: initially, pos51 is clear. But after previous steps, need to ensure it's still clear. Let's assume yes for now.
4. Can move from pos53 to pos52 via dirup: yes.
5. Can move from pos52 to pos51 via dirup: yes.
6. pos51 is a goal location: yes.

So that action would work. Then, the stone is at pos51, which is the goal. So the main steps are:

1. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos42 (agent at pos22, then after push, agent at pos32).
Wait, initial agent position is pos21. So first, the agent needs to get to pos22 to push the stone from pos32 to pos42.

Let me outline the steps:

Initial state:
- Agent at pos21
- Stone1 at pos32

Step 1: Move agent from pos21 to pos22. Because pos22 is clear. How? From pos21, possible moves are to pos11 (dirleft), pos31 (dirright), or pos22 (dirdown). So moving down to pos22.

Action: move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown.

Now agent is at pos22. Then, push stone1 from pos32 to pos42.

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright.

After this, agent is at pos32, stone1 at pos42.

Now, to push from pos42 to pos52, agent needs to be at pos32 (which they are) and direction dirright. So:

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos52 dirright.

Now agent is at pos42, stone at pos52.

Next, agent needs to get to pos53 to push stone to pos51. From pos42, move down to pos43 (dirdown).

Action: move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown.

Then, move right to pos53 (dirright).

Action: move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright.

Now at pos53. Push stone from pos52 to pos51:

Action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos52 pos51 dirup.

Now stone1 is at pos51 (goal achieved).

But we need to check all constraints.

Now, let's check the constraints one by one.

Constraints:

1. At least one state where pos54 is not clear or player is there. In the plan above, pos54 is never touched. So this is not satisfied. Need to adjust.

2. Player must be at pos42. Yes, after pushing to pos52, agent is at pos42.

3. If player is at pos42, then they must be at pos25 at or after. In current plan, after pos42, they move to pos43 and pos53. So this constraint is violated. So need to ensure that after being at pos42, player goes to pos25.

So need to insert steps where after being at pos42, the player reaches pos25.

But how? Let's see. The current plan is:

After pos42, player moves to pos43, then pos53. But that skips the requirement to reach pos25 after pos42.

So perhaps after pushing to pos52 (agent at pos42), the agent needs to move to pos25. But how?

From pos42 to pos25: Let's see the path. pos42 is in row 4, column 2. pos25 is row 2, column5. That's a long path. Let's think.

From pos42, possible moves: up to pos41, left to pos32, right to pos52, down to pos43. To get to pos25, need to go up to pos41, then left to pos31, then up to pos21, then right to pos22, down to pos23, etc.? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe after pushing to pos52, agent is at pos42. Then, instead of moving to pos43, they need to move to pos25. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the initial plan needs to be adjusted to include a detour to pos25 after being at pos42. But this complicates the plan. Let's think of another approach.

Alternatively, maybe the stone can be pushed through a different path that allows visiting pos25. But this may complicate the stone's path to the goal.

Alternatively, after pushing to pos52, the agent can move from pos42 to pos43, then pos44, pos45, pos35, pos25? Let's check the movement possibilities.

From pos42, move down to pos43. Then from pos43, down to pos44. From pos44, down to pos45. From pos45, down to pos55? Or from pos45, left to pos35. Wait, pos45's movements: can move left to pos35 (dirleft), right to pos55 (dirright), or up to pos44 (dirup). So from pos45, left to pos35. Then from pos35, left to pos25 (dirleft). So path: pos42 → pos43 → pos44 → pos45 → pos35 → pos25.

But that's a lot of steps. Then, after reaching pos25, the agent needs to go back to pos53 to push the stone. But this adds many steps. However, the constraint requires that after being at pos42, the agent must reach pos25 at some point. So in the current plan, after pos42, the agent moves to pos43, then pos53, which does not include pos25. Hence, the plan is invalid.

So to satisfy the constraint, after the agent is at pos42, they need to go to pos25. Let's adjust the plan.

After pushing to pos52 (agent at pos42):

Action: move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown.

Then pos43 → pos44 dirdown.

Then pos44 → pos45 dirdown.

Then pos45 → pos35 dirleft.

pos35 → pos25 dirleft.

Now agent is at pos25. Then, they need to get back to pos53 to push the stone. So from pos25, how to get to pos53?

From pos25, possible moves: right to pos35 (dirright), up to pos24 (dirup), or left to pos15 (dirleft). So pos25 → pos35 (dirright), then pos35 → pos45 (dirright), then pos45 → pos44 (dirup), pos44 → pos43 (dirup), pos43 → pos53 (dirright). This is a long path. But necessary to satisfy the constraint.

So inserting these steps:

After pushing to pos52 (agent at pos42):

1. move pos42 → pos43 (dirdown)
2. move pos43 → pos44 (dirdown)
3. move pos44 → pos45 (dirdown)
4. move pos45 → pos35 (dirleft)
5. move pos35 → pos25 (dirleft)
Now agent is at pos25, satisfying the constraint that after pos42, they reach pos25.

Then, from pos25, they need to get back to pos53:

6. move pos25 → pos35 (dirright)
7. move pos35 → pos45 (dirright)
8. move pos45 → pos44 (dirup)
9. move pos44 → pos43 (dirup)
10. move pos43 → pos53 (dirright)

Then push the stone to pos51.

This adds many steps. But this is necessary to satisfy the constraint. However, this might not be optimal. Let's see if there's a shorter path.

Alternative path from pos42 to pos25:

pos42 → pos32 (dirleft), pos32 → pos22 (dirleft), pos22 → pos23 (dirdown), pos23 → pos24 (dirdown), pos24 → pos25 (dirdown). That's possible?

From pos42, move left to pos32. Then from pos32, left to pos22. Then pos22 → pos23 (dirdown). pos23 → pos24 (dirdown). pos24 → pos25 (dirdown). So that's 5 moves. Then, from pos25, go to pos35 → pos45 → pos44 → pos43 → pos53. So total steps would be 5 to get to pos25, then 5 to get back. That's a lot. But perhaps necessary.

But this seems too long. Maybe there's a smarter way. Alternatively, after getting to pos25, the agent can move back through different paths. But this seems unavoidable.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can reach pos25 earlier in the plan, before pushing to pos52, but that would complicate the stone's path.

But given the constraints, we have to make sure that after being at pos42, the agent reaches pos25.

Another constraint is that there must be a state where player is at pos25 and pos31 is not clear. So pos31 must have something (agent or stone) at that time. Initially, pos31 is clear. So during the plan, we need to make pos31 not clear (i.e., have the agent or stone there) when the player is at pos25.

So perhaps during the movement to pos25, the agent passes through pos31, or the stone is moved there. But the stone's path is to pos51. Alternatively, the agent can be at pos31 and pos25 in the same state. But how?

Alternatively, when the agent is moving from pos42 to pos25 via pos32 and pos22, they can pass through pos31. Let's see.

Wait, from pos42, agent moves left to pos32. Then, from pos32, can move up to pos31 (dirup). Then from pos31, move left to pos21 (dirleft), then down to pos22 (dirdown), then to pos23, etc. But that's again a long path. However, if the agent goes to pos31, then pos31 is not clear when they are there. So when the agent is at pos25, if they are also at pos31 at some point, but how to have both pos25 and pos31 not clear? Wait, the constraint is that in some state, both player is at pos25 and pos31 is not clear. So perhaps during the movement to pos25, the agent is at pos31 in an earlier step, then moves to pos25, but pos31 becomes clear again. But the constraint requires that there exists a state where player is at pos25 and pos31 is not clear. So maybe during the movement to pos25, the agent is at pos31 and then moves to pos21, then to pos25, but then pos31 is clear again. Not sure.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos42, the agent is at pos32. Then, maybe the agent can move to pos31, making pos31 not clear. Then, proceed to pos25. So when the agent is at pos25, pos31 is not clear (if the agent is still there). But that's not possible unless the agent is at both pos25 and pos31, which is impossible. So perhaps, the agent is at pos31 in one step, then moves to pos25 in another. But then, in the state where the agent is at pos25, pos31 is clear again. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps when the agent is at pos31, then moves to pos21, then to pos22, pos23, pos24, pos25. So when the agent is at pos25, pos31 is clear again. So that doesn't satisfy the constraint. Therefore, to have pos31 not clear when the agent is at pos25, we need another object (stone1) to be at pos31. But stone1 is at pos42 at that point. So that's not possible. Hmm.

This suggests that the constraint "player1 is at pos25 and pos31 is not clear" requires that pos31 is occupied by either the agent or the stone. But since the stone is at pos42, the only way is to have the agent at pos31 and then move to pos25, but in that case, pos31 would be clear when the agent leaves. So maybe during the movement from pos31 to pos21, then to pos22, etc., the agent is at pos25 at a later time, but pos31 is clear. So this constraint is challenging.

Wait, maybe the stone can be moved to pos31 at some point. Let's see. The stone starts at pos32. If instead of pushing it right to pos42, we push it up to pos31. Then, pos31 would have the stone, making it not clear. Then, the agent can move to pos25 while the stone is at pos31. But how to get the stone to pos31.

But the stone's path to pos51 is via pos42, pos52, etc. If we first push it up to pos31, then perhaps later push it right to pos41, then down to pos42, etc. But that complicates the path. However, this might help satisfy the constraint.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the stone from pos32 to pos31 (up direction). Let's see. To push the stone from pos32 to pos31 (dirup), the agent needs to be at pos32's down direction (pos33) and push up. But pos33 is clear. Wait, the movement directions: from pos33, can move up to pos32 (dirup). So to push the stone from pos32 to pos31 (dirup), the agent must be at pos33 (south of pos32), then push north. But how does the agent get to pos33 initially?

Initial agent is at pos21. To get to pos33, they need to move right to pos31, then down to pos32, then down to pos33. But pos32 has the stone. So agent can't move there. So maybe this is not feasible.

Alternatively, the agent can move from pos21 to pos22, then pos23, pos24, pos25, pos35, pos34, pos33. But this is a long path. Not sure.

This suggests that pushing the stone up to pos31 is not straightforward. So perhaps it's better to leave the stone at pos42 and find another way to make pos31 not clear when the agent is at pos25.

Alternatively, the agent can move to pos31, making it not clear, then move to pos25. But how?

If the agent is at pos31, then moves to pos21, then to pos22, pos23, pos24, pos25. But when the agent is at pos25, pos31 is clear again. So no.

Hmm. This constraint is tricky. Let's think again: we need a state where player is at pos25 AND pos31 is not clear. So pos31 must be occupied (by agent or stone) in that state. The only way is if either the agent is at pos31 and pos25 at the same time (impossible), or the stone is at pos31 while the agent is at pos25. But how?

If the stone can be moved to pos31, and then the agent moves to pos25. So during that time, the stone is at pos31, and the agent is at pos25. That would satisfy the constraint.

So how to get the stone to pos31. The stone is at pos32 initially. The agent can push it up to pos31. But how?

To push from pos32 to pos31 (dirup), the agent needs to be at pos32's south (pos33). But how to get there. Agent starts at pos21. Path to pos33:

pos21 → pos22 (dirdown)
pos22 → pos23 (dirdown)
pos23 → pos33 (dirright)

But pos23 to pos33 is dirright. So agent moves to pos33. Then, can push the stone from pos32 to pos31 (dirup). Then, stone is at pos31. Then, agent can move to pos25. So let's adjust the plan:

Initial steps:

1. move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown
2. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
3. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirup

Now stone is at pos31, agent at pos32.

Then, agent needs to go to pos25. Path from pos32 to pos25:

pos32 → pos22 dirleft
pos22 → pos23 dirdown
pos23 → pos24 dirdown
pos24 → pos25 dirdown

So steps:

5. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft
6. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
7. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
8. move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown

Now, agent is at pos25, and stone is at pos31. So in this state, player is at pos25 and pos31 is not clear (stone is there). This satisfies the constraint.

Then, the agent needs to move the stone from pos31 to pos51. Path from pos31 to pos51: pos31 → pos41 (dirright), pos41 → pos51 (dirright). So pushing the stone right twice.

But to push from pos31 to pos41 (dirright), the agent needs to be at pos31's left (pos21), direction dirright. So agent is at pos21. But agent is currently at pos25. So need to move from pos25 to pos21.

Path: pos25 → pos24 dirup, pos24 → pos23 dirup, pos23 → pos22 dirup, pos22 → pos21 dirup.

Steps:

9. move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
10. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
11. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
12. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup

Now agent is at pos21. Then, push stone from pos31 to pos41:

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos31 pos41 dirright

After this, agent is at pos31, stone at pos41.

Then, push from pos41 to pos51:

Agent needs to be at pos41's left (pos31) to push right. But agent is at pos31. So:

Action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos41 pos51 dirright

This moves the stone to pos51, which is a goal.

So now the stone is at pos51. But we need to check other constraints.

But wait, this plan's main steps are:

1. Move to pos33 via pos22, pos23.
2. Push stone up to pos31.
3. Move to pos25.
4. Move back to pos21.
5. Push stone to pos41, then to pos51.

This would make the stone's path: pos32 → pos31 → pos41 → pos51.

But does this satisfy all constraints?

Let's check the constraints:

- Constraint 1: pos54 not clear or player there. In this plan, pos54 is never touched. So not satisfied.

- Constraint 2: player at pos42. Not in this plan. So violated.

- Constraint 3: if player at pos42, then pos25. But in this plan, player is never at pos42, so this is satisfied vacuously. Wait, no. The constraint says the player must be at pos42 in some state. So this plan doesn't satisfy that. So this approach is invalid.

Thus, this alternative plan fails to meet other constraints. So the initial approach of pushing the stone to pos42, then pos52, then pos51, but with the detour to pos25 after pos42, seems necessary, even though it adds steps.

But the original plan with the detour would have the agent go from pos42 to pos43, pos44, pos45, pos35, pos25, then back to pos35, pos45, pos44, pos43, pos53. Then push the stone to pos51. Let's see how that plan meets the constraints.

In that plan:

- Player is at pos42 (satisfies constraint 2).

- After pos42, they go to pos25 (satisfies constraint 3).

- When at pos25, is pos31 not clear? In this plan, the stone is at pos52, so pos31 is clear. So the constraint requiring a state where player is at pos25 and pos31 is not clear is not satisfied. Hence, this plan is invalid.

Hmm. So this is a problem. We need to have a state where player is at pos25 and pos31 is not clear. So how to achieve that?

Perhaps during the detour to pos25, the agent can visit pos31, making it not clear. Let's say after reaching pos25, the agent moves to pos35, then to pos31. Let's see.

After reaching pos25:

Action: move pos25 pos35 dirright (stone is at pos52).

Then pos35 → pos31 dirleft (since pos35 can move left to pos25, but to get to pos31, need to go up? Wait, from pos35, the possible moves are left to pos25, right to pos45, up to pos34. To reach pos31, need to go up to pos34, then left to pos24, etc. Not straightforward.

Alternatively, when the agent is at pos25, they can move up to pos24, then pos23, pos22, pos21, pos31. So:

pos25 → pos24 dirup
pos24 → pos23 dirup
pos23 → pos22 dirup
pos22 → pos21 dirup
pos21 → pos31 dirright

Then, agent is at pos31, making pos31 not clear. Then, they can move back to pos25:

pos31 → pos21 dirleft
pos21 → pos22 dirdown
pos22 → pos23 dirdown
pos23 → pos24 dirdown
pos24 → pos25 dirdown

Now, when the agent is at pos25, pos31 is clear again. So this doesn't help. Alternatively, if the agent is at pos31 and pos25 at the same time, which is impossible. 

Alternatively, while the agent is moving from pos31 to pos21, pos31 becomes clear again. So this approach doesn't work.

Another idea: maybe the stone can be moved to pos31 during the plan. For example, after pushing it to pos42, the agent can push it back to pos32, then up to pos31. But this would require additional steps.

Let's adjust the plan again:

Original steps:

1. Move to pos22, push stone to pos42.

2. Push stone to pos52.

3. Move to pos43, pos44, pos45, pos35, pos25.

At this point, the agent is at pos25, stone at pos52.

To satisfy the constraint that pos31 is not clear when the agent is at pos25, perhaps the agent can push the stone from pos52 to pos51 via pos53, but also have pos31 occupied. But how?

Alternatively, during the agent's movement to pos25, they can pass through pos31. But that's not possible from pos42 to pos25 via the path we had.

Alternatively, after reaching pos25, the agent can move to pos31, making pos31 not clear, and then return to pos25. But when they are at pos31, they are not at pos25. So in the state where they are at pos31, pos25 is clear. So the only way to have both pos25 and pos31 occupied is if the agent is at pos25 and the stone is at pos31. So perhaps during the plan, after pushing the stone to pos31, then move the agent to pos25.

But earlier plan where stone is pushed to pos31 and agent to pos25 would work for that constraint.

But then other constraints need to be satisfied, like the stone being at pos42 in some state (constraint 3), and pos51 (constraint 11), etc.

This is getting complicated. Perhaps the optimal plan needs to combine multiple steps to satisfy all constraints. Let me try to outline a plan that meets all constraints:

1. Move agent from pos21 to pos22.
2. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos42 (agent at pos22, stone to pos42, agent moves to pos32).
3. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos52 (agent at pos32, stone to pos52, agent moves to pos42).
4. Move agent from pos42 to pos43.
5. Move agent from pos43 to pos44.
6. Move agent from pos44 to pos45.
7. Move agent from pos45 to pos35.
8. Move agent from pos35 to pos25. Now, agent is at pos25. Need to make pos31 not clear here. So perhaps during this journey, agent can go to pos31 first.

Wait, from pos35, the agent can move up to pos34, then left to pos24, etc. But to get to pos31, it's a long path. Alternatively, after step 3 (stone at pos52, agent at pos42), the agent moves to pos32 (left), then to pos31 (up), making pos31 not clear. Then, the agent goes to pos25. So:

After step 3:

4. Move agent from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft).
5. Move agent from pos32 to pos31 (dirup). Now pos31 is not clear.
6. Move agent from pos31 to pos21 (dirleft).
7. Move agent from pos21 to pos22 (dirdown).
8. Move agent from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown).
9. Move agent from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown).
10. Move agent from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown). Now, agent is at pos25, and pos31 is clear again (since agent left). So this doesn't help.

Alternatively, after step 5 (agent at pos31), the agent moves directly to pos25. But how? From pos31, possible moves are left to pos21, right to pos41, down to pos32. So to get to pos25 from pos31, the agent would have to go through pos21, pos22, pos23, pos24, pos25. Which is the same as before. So when the agent is at pos25, pos31 is clear again.

Hmm. This suggests that the only way to have pos31 not clear when the agent is at pos25 is to have the stone at pos31 at that time.

So let's try to adjust the plan to move the stone to pos31, then to pos51 via pos41.

Initial steps:

1. Move agent from pos21 to pos22.
2. Move agent from pos22 to pos23.
3. Move agent from pos23 to pos33.
4. Push stone from pos32 to pos31 (agent at pos33, push up to pos31).
5. Now, stone is at pos31. Agent is at pos32.
6. Move agent from pos32 to pos22.
7. Move agent from pos22 to pos23.
8. Move agent from pos23 to pos24.
9. Move agent from pos24 to pos25. Now, agent is at pos25, stone is at pos31. This satisfies the constraint that player is at pos25 and pos31 is not clear.
10. Then, agent needs to move back to pos31 to push the stone to pos41. So from pos25, move to pos24, pos23, pos22, pos21, pos31.
11. Push stone from pos31 to pos41.
12. Push stone from pos41 to pos51.

This plan would satisfy several constraints:

- Stone at pos51 (goal).
- Player at pos42: no, in this plan, player never goes to pos42. So this violates constraint 2.

Thus, this plan is invalid.

Therefore, combining all constraints is extremely complex. Perhaps the optimal plan requires a longer sequence that meets all the constraints through various detours.

Given the time constraints, let's try to outline a plan that addresses as many constraints as possible, then check each one.

Proposed plan:

1. move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown
2. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright
   - Now agent at pos32, stone at pos42. Satisfies constraint 3 (stone at pos42).
   - After this, agent needs to go to pos25.

But stone at pos42 triggers constraint 4: if stone is at pos42, then either stone is later at pos32 or pos45 is not clear. So we need to ensure that after stone is at pos42, either it moves back to pos32 or pos45 is occupied.

In the original plan, stone moves to pos52, then to pos51. So pos45 remains clear. So this violates the constraint. Hence, after pushing stone to pos42, the stone must either return to pos32 or pos45 must be occupied. 

To satisfy this, perhaps after pushing to pos42, push the stone to pos43, making pos43 not clear, then to pos44, pos45. Then pos45 is not clear, satisfying the constraint.

Let's try:

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos43 dirright
   - Agent at pos42, stone at pos43.

4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirright
   - Agent at pos43, stone at pos44.

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirright
   - Agent at pos44, stone at pos45. Now pos45 is not clear.

This satisfies the constraint that after stone is at pos42, pos45 is not clear. Then, we can push the stone from pos45 to pos55 (non-goal), then to pos54, etc. But the goal is to get the stone to pos51. So this path is not helpful.

Alternatively, after pos45, push the stone to pos35 (dirleft), then to pos25, etc. But this complicates the path.

Alternatively, after step 2 (stone at pos42), move agent to pos25, ensuring that pos45 is not clear during that time. But how?

Alternatively, after step 2, the agent can move to pos45 and occupy it, making pos45 not clear. Then proceed to pos25.

So:

3. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
4. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
5. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
6. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirright
   - Now agent is at pos45, making pos45 not clear. Satisfies the constraint for stone at pos42.

Then, agent can move to pos25:

7. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft
8. move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft

Now, agent is at pos25. Then, need to get back to push the stone from pos42 to pos52, but the stone is still at pos42. Wait, no. In this case, the stone is at pos42 after step 2. Then, agent moves to pos45, but the stone is still at pos42. So this doesn't help. This approach is not working.

This is getting too complicated. Perhaps the optimal plan is to accept that multiple steps are needed to satisfy all constraints, even if it makes the plan longer.

Given the time I have, I'll attempt to outline a plan that meets all the constraints, even if it's not the absolute shortest, but ensuring each constraint is addressed.

Here's a possible plan:

1. move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown
2. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright (stone at pos42, agent at pos32)
   - Satisfies constraint 3 (stone at pos42)
   - Now, need to ensure that after this, either stone returns to pos32 or pos45 is not clear.

3. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright (agent moves to pos42, which is now clear since stone was pushed to pos42 earlier)
   - Wait, after step 2, the agent is at pos32. To move to pos42, need to check if pos42 is clear. After step 2, stone is at pos42, so pos42 is not clear. So agent cannot move there. Hence, this step is invalid.

Alternative approach after step 2:

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos43 dirright (agent at pos42, stone at pos43)
   - Now, stone at pos43. This may help with other constraints.

4. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirright (agent at pos43)
   - pos43 is now not clear (agent and stone both there?), but this is not possible. Wait, after pushing the stone to pos43, the agent is at pos42. Then, moving to pos43 requires it to be clear. But after the push, stone is at pos43, so pos43 is not clear. Hence, this move is invalid.

Thus, this approach doesn't work.

Let's try a different path after step 2:

3. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup (agent at pos31)
   - pos31 is now not clear.
4. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft (agent at pos21)
5. move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown (agent at pos22)
6. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown (agent at pos23)
7. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown (agent at pos24)
8. move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown (agent at pos25)
   - Now, agent is at pos25. pos31 was not clear when the agent was there in step 3, but now it's clear. So to satisfy the constraint that in some state, player is at pos25 and pos31 is not clear, we need pos31 to be not clear while the agent is at pos25. But currently, pos31 is clear. So this doesn't help.

Hmm. This is really challenging. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed to draft a plan that meets as many constraints as possible, noting that some steps might be missing. However, since this is a theoretical exercise, the final answer must be a correct plan that meets all constraints.
