Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. So, the goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. From the initial state, stone1 is at pos22, and the only goal location mentioned is pos15. So I need to move stone1 from pos22 to pos15. 

First, let's look at where the agent is. The agent (player1) starts at pos21. The stone is at pos22. So the agent is adjacent to the stone. But to push the stone, the agent needs to be in a position adjacent to the stone in the direction they want to push. Let me check the possible directions.

Looking at the movement options: From pos21, the agent can move to pos22 (down). So maybe the agent can move down to pos22? Wait, but pos22 is where the stone is. But the move action requires that the target location (l_to) is clear. However, in the initial state, pos22 has the stone, so it's not clear. Therefore, the agent can't move directly to pos22.

So the agent needs to get into a position where they can push the stone. Since the stone is at pos22, the agent needs to be in a position adjacent to pos22 such that they can push the stone towards the goal. The directions available from pos22: the agent can be at pos21 (up from the stone), pos12 (left), pos32 (right), or pos23 (down). Let's see which of these positions the agent can reach.

The agent is currently at pos21. From pos21, they can move to pos11 (left), pos31 (right), or pos22 (down). But pos22 is blocked by the stone. So moving down to pos22 isn't possible. So the other options are moving left to pos11 or right to pos31. Wait, pos11 is clear, right? Let's check the initial state. Yes, pos11 is clear. So maybe the agent can move left to pos11. Wait, wait. The movement from pos21 to pos11 is direction dirleft. Wait, according to the given movement connections, "You may move from location pos21 to location pos11 following direction dirleft". So yes, moving from pos21 to pos11 via dirleft is allowed. Then pos11 is clear, so that's possible.

But why would the agent want to go to pos11? Maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, moving right to pos31. But pos31 is clear. So agent can move from pos21 to pos31 via dirright. Then from pos31, maybe move down to pos32? But pos32 is clear. Then from pos32, which is to the right of pos22, the agent could push the stone left (dirleft) towards pos12, but that's not the goal. The goal is pos15. So perhaps that's not the right path.

Alternatively, the agent could go around to get behind the stone. Let's see: If the agent moves from pos21 to pos31 (right), then from pos31 to pos32 (down), then from pos32 to pos33 (down?), wait, no. From pos32, movement options are left (to pos22), right (pos42), up (pos31), or down (pos33). So if the agent is at pos32, they can move left to pos22, but again, pos22 is occupied by the stone. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can go from pos21 up to pos11, then to pos12, then down to pos22's left side. Wait, pos12 is adjacent to pos22. Let's see: Agent is at pos21. Move left to pos11 (dirleft). Then from pos11, move down to pos12 (dirdown). Then from pos12, move right to pos22 (dirright). But when trying to move to pos22, it's blocked by the stone. So the agent can't move there. But perhaps from pos12, the agent can push the stone. Since pos12 is to the left of pos22 (the stone's position), if the agent is at pos12, they could push the stone to the right (dirright) direction. But pos22 is the stone's current location. So to push the stone from pos22 to pos23 (down direction?), wait. Wait, the push action requires that the agent is at a location adjacent to the stone, and the direction from the agent's location to the stone's location. Let's think: For the pushtogoal or pushtonongoal actions, the agent must be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's current position) in direction d. Then, the stone moves from l_from to l_to, which is in the same direction d from l_from.

So, if the agent is at pos12, which is to the left of pos22 (since moving from pos12 to pos22 is direction dirright), then the direction from the agent's location (pos12) to the stone's location (pos22) is dirright. So the agent can push the stone in the same direction (dirright) from pos22 to pos23, but pos23 is a non-goal location. Alternatively, pushing the stone in another direction? Wait, no. The direction for pushing must be the same as the direction from the agent's location to the stone's location. So if the agent is at pos12 (left of pos22), the direction is dirright. So the stone can be pushed in dirright from pos22 to pos23. But pos23 is not a goal. But the goal is to get the stone to pos15, which is a goal location. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, if the agent can get to the right side of the stone (pos32), then they could push the stone left towards pos22? No, because the stone is already at pos22. Wait, maybe the agent needs to move around to the other side. Let me think about the positions. The grid is 5x5, from pos11 (row 1, column 1) to pos55 (row5, column5). So pos15 is row1, column5. The goal is pos15. The stone is at pos22 (row2, column2). So the stone is in row2, column2. The goal is in row1, column5. So the stone needs to move up to row1 and right to column5.

But how to get it there. Let's think of possible paths. From pos22, moving right to pos23, then up to pos13, then right to pos14, up to pos15? But that's a possible path. Alternatively, moving up to pos12, then right, etc. But the agent needs to push the stone each step.

But let's first figure out how to get the stone from pos22 to pos15. The shortest path would probably be moving up and right. Let's see:

From pos22 to pos23 (right), then pos23 to pos24 (right), then pos24 to pos25 (right), then pos25 to pos15 (left, since pos15 is row1, column5, but pos25 is row2, column5. Wait, no. pos25 is row2, column5. pos15 is row1, column5. So from pos25, moving up to pos15. But how?

Wait, the movement directions: The directions allowed are up, down, left, right. So moving from pos25 to pos15 is direction dirleft? Or is it up? Wait, the movement from pos15 to pos25 is dirright (as per "You may move from location pos15 to location pos25 following direction dirright"). So moving from pos25 to pos15 would be dirleft? Or maybe the direction is dependent on the movement. Wait, perhaps the movement directions are grid-based. For example, moving from pos21 to pos22 is dirdown (since pos22 is below pos21). Similarly, moving from pos22 to pos23 is dirdown (if that's the case), but looking at the given movement options:

Looking at the given "You may move from..." statements:

For example, "You may move from location pos21 to location pos22 following direction dirdown". So pos21 is row2, column1. pos22 is row2, column2. Wait, that's moving to the right. But direction is dirdown. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, maybe the directions are not as per standard grid movements. Let me check.

Wait, the movement directions might be defined in a way that "dirright" is moving right along the same row, "dirleft" is left along the same row. "dirup" is up a row, and "dirdown" is down a row. But according to the movement from pos21 to pos22 is direction dirdown. But pos21 to pos22 is moving from (row2, column1) to (row2, column2), which is right. So maybe the direction labels are inconsistent. That complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the directions are named based on their direction in the grid. For example, moving from pos21 (row2, column1) to pos22 (row2, column2) is direction dirdown. That would imply that columns are considered vertical? That seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the movement directions are labeled differently. This is a problem because the direction names (dirup, dirdown, dirleft, dirright) might not correspond to the actual grid directions as per standard conventions.

This is critical because to plan the agent's movement and pushing actions, the directions must be correctly understood. Let's look at the given movement connections again.

For example, "You may move from location pos21 to location pos11 following direction dirleft". pos21 is (2,1), pos11 is (1,1). So moving from row2 to row1, same column. That's moving up, but the direction is dirleft. Wait, that's inconsistent with standard directions. So perhaps the directions are labeled differently. Similarly, moving from pos21 to pos31 is dirright. pos31 is (3,1), so same column but lower row. So moving from (2,1) to (3,1) is dirright. So dirright is moving down along the same column. Wait, that's confusing. So perhaps the directions are:

- dirup: move to a higher row number? Or lower?

Wait, maybe the grid is arranged such that pos11 is top-left, pos51 is bottom-left. So rows increase downward, columns increase to the right. Then:

- Moving from pos21 (row2, column1) to pos11 (row1, column1) would be dirup. But according to the given movement, that's dirleft. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the directions are based on the movement between positions. For example, moving from pos21 to pos11 is considered dirleft. But pos21 and pos11 are in the same column (column1), so that movement is up. So this labeling is confusing. 

This makes it tricky to figure out the directions. Let's look at some of the movement connections to see:

- From pos11, you can move to pos21 (dirright) and pos12 (dirdown). So pos21 is (2,1), which is directly below pos11 (1,1). So dirright corresponds to moving down a row. Then, dirdown from pos11 moves to pos12 (1,2), which is right in the same row. So dirdown is moving right along the row. That's a bit counterintuitive. So the directions are named as:

dirright: move down a row (same column)
dirdown: move right along the row (same row)
dirleft: move up a row (same column)
dirup: move left along the row (same row?)

Wait, that's possible. For example:

pos11 can move to pos21 via dirright (down a row, same column)
pos11 can move to pos12 via dirdown (right along the row)

Similarly, pos12 can move to pos22 via dirright (down a row, same column as pos12?), but pos12 is (1,2), pos22 is (2,2), which is down a row. So dirright here corresponds to moving down a row.

But then, pos12 can move to pos11 via dirup (left along the row) and to pos13 via dirdown (right along the row). 

So the directions are:

- dirright: move down a row (same column)
- dirleft: move up a row (same column)
- dirup: move left along the row (same row)
- dirdown: move right along the row (same row)

Wait, no. Because moving from pos12 to pos22 is dirright, which is down a row (same column?), but pos12 is (1,2), pos22 is (2,2). So that's moving down a row. So dirright is down. Similarly, moving from pos22 to pos32 is dirright, which would be down to (3,2). So dirright is moving down a row.

Similarly, moving from pos12 to pos11 is dirup (left along the row). Because pos12 is (1,2), pos11 is (1,1). So moving left along the row is dirup. Then, moving right along the row is dirdown. So directions:

- dirup: left along the row (same row, column decreases)
- dirdown: right along the row (same row, column increases)
- dirleft: up along the column (same column, row decreases)
- dirright: down along the column (same column, row increases)

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's clarify with examples:

From pos21 (2,1):

- move to pos11 (1,1) via dirleft. So dirleft is moving up a row (row decreases by 1, same column)
- move to pos31 (3,1) via dirright. So dirright is moving down a row (row increases by 1, same column)
- move to pos22 (2,2) via dirdown. So dirdown is moving right along the row (column increases by 1, same row)

Similarly, from pos22 (2,2):

- move to pos12 (1,2) via dirleft (up a row)
- move to pos32 (3,2) via dirright (down a row)
- move to pos21 (2,1) via dirup (left along the row)
- move to pos23 (2,3) via dirdown (right along the row)

So, to summarize:

- dirup: move left along the row (column decreases)
- dirdown: move right along the row (column increases)
- dirleft: move up along the column (row decreases)
- dirright: move down along the column (row increases)

This is crucial for planning the movement and pushing directions.

Now, the stone is at pos22 (2,2). The goal is to move it to pos15 (1,5), which is a goal location. So the stone needs to move from (2,2) to (1,5). The path could be:

- From pos22 (2,2), move right along the row to pos23 (2,3), then pos24 (2,4), pos25 (2,5). Then move up along the column to pos15 (1,5).

But pos25 to pos15 would require moving dirleft (up a column) from pos25. So to get from pos25 to pos15, direction dirleft.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a shorter path. For example, moving up first to pos12 (1,2), then right to pos15. But pos12 is (1,2), pos13 (1,3), etc. But pos15 is (1,5). So from pos22, move dirleft (up a column) to pos12 (1,2), then dirdown (right along the row) to pos13, pos14, pos15. But the stone starts at pos22. So the agent needs to push it up to pos12 (1,2), then push it right to pos13 (1,3), then pos14 (1,4), then pos15 (1,5). But pushing up from pos22 requires the agent to be at pos12 (since pushing up along the column would require the agent to be in the same column, row 1. So to push the stone from pos22 to pos12, the agent must be at pos12 (since the direction from the agent to the stone's current position (pos22) would be dirright (down a column). Wait, no. Let's think:

To push the stone from pos22 to pos12 (up a column), the agent needs to be in a position adjacent to pos22 in the direction opposite to the push. Wait, no. According to the push actions, the agent must be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's current position) in direction d. Then the stone moves from l_from to l_to in direction d. So for example, to push the stone from pos22 to pos12 (up a column), the agent needs to be at pos22's "dirleft" direction, which would be pos12 (since dirleft from pos22 is up a column to pos12). Wait, according to the movement directions, moving from pos22 to pos12 is direction dirleft. So if the agent is at pos12 and wants to push the stone at pos22 to pos32 (down a column), that would require direction dirright (from pos12 to pos22 is dirright). Wait, no. Let's get back.

If the agent is at pos12 (1,2), and the stone is at pos22 (2,2). The direction from pos12 to pos22 is dirright (since moving from pos12 to pos22 is dirright, which is down a column). So the agent is at pos12 (l_p=pos12), and the stone is at l_from=pos22. Wait, no. Wait, the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (stone's position) via direction d. So in this case, the agent is at pos12 (1,2), stone is at pos22 (2,2). The direction from pos12 to pos22 is dirright (down a column). So to push the stone in the same direction (dirright), which would move the stone from pos22 to pos32 (3,2). But that's moving down, not up. So pushing the stone down doesn't help.

Alternatively, if the agent is at pos32 (3,2), and the stone is at pos22 (2,2). The direction from pos32 to pos22 is dirleft (up a column). Then, pushing the stone in dirleft direction would move it to pos12 (1,2). Wait, no. Because pushing in direction dirleft would move the stone from pos22 to pos12 (since dirleft is up a column). So the agent needs to be at pos32 (3,2), which is down a column from the stone's position. Then, the direction from agent's location (pos32) to stone's location (pos22) is dirleft (up a column). So the agent can push the stone in dirleft direction, moving it from pos22 to pos12. That would be helpful.

But how does the agent get to pos32 (3,2)? The agent starts at pos21 (2,1). Let's see the path:

From pos21, move dirright (down a column) to pos31 (3,1). Then move dirdown (right along the row) to pos32 (3,2). Then, the agent is at pos32, adjacent to the stone at pos22. Then, the agent can push the stone in dirleft direction to pos12 (1,2). Wait, but pushing from pos22 to pos12 would require that pos12 is clear. Initially, pos12 is clear. So after pushing, the stone would be at pos12. But pos12 is not a goal location. Then, the agent can move to pos12 and push the stone further right towards pos15.

Wait, but pos12 is a non-goal location, so the agent would use pushtonongoal to move it to pos13, then pos14, then pos15. But pos15 is a goal location. So each push would need to be to the next position until reaching pos15.

But let's outline the steps:

1. Agent moves from pos21 to pos31 via dirright (down a column).
2. Agent moves from pos31 to pos32 via dirdown (right along the row).
3. Agent pushes the stone from pos22 to pos12 using pushtonongoal (since pos12 is not a goal). The action would be "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft". Because the agent is at pos32, pushing the stone from pos22 (current location) to pos12 (direction dirleft from pos22). But wait, the direction d in the action is the direction from the agent's location (l_p) to l_from (the stone's current location). So l_p is pos32, l_from is pos22. The direction from pos32 to pos22 is dirleft (up a column). So the direction d is dirleft. Then, the stone moves from pos22 to pos12 (dirleft from pos22). So this action is valid if pos12 is clear, which it is.

After this action, the stone is at pos12. Then, the agent is at pos22 (since after pushing, the agent moves to l_from, which was pos22). But pos22 was cleared because the stone moved. So agent is now at pos22.

Next, to push the stone from pos12 to pos13 (right along the row), the agent needs to be at pos12's adjacent position in the direction of the push. The direction for pushing right along the row (dirdown) would require the agent to be at pos12's left (dirup) or right (dirdown) direction. Wait, no. To push the stone from pos12 to pos13 (dirdown direction, right along the row), the agent needs to be adjacent to pos12 in the direction opposite to the push. So the agent needs to be at pos11 (left of pos12) or pos13 (right of pos12). Wait, no. Let's think again.

The agent needs to be at a location l_p such that from l_p, you can move to pos12 (the stone's current location) via direction d. Then, the stone is pushed from pos12 to pos13 via direction d (same direction as from l_p to pos12). So to push the stone from pos12 to pos13 (dirdown), the agent must be at a location that is adjacent to pos12 in the dirdown direction. Wait, pos12's adjacent locations:

- pos11 (dirup)
- pos13 (dirdown)
- pos22 (dirright)

So if the agent is at pos13 (dirdown from pos12), then the direction from pos13 to pos12 is dirup. So pushing in dirup direction would move the stone from pos12 to pos11. But we want to push it to pos13. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, the agent can be at pos11 (dirup from pos12). Then the direction from pos11 to pos12 is dirdown. So pushing in dirdown direction would move the stone from pos12 to pos13. So the agent needs to be at pos11 to push the stone right (dirdown) to pos13.

So after the stone is at pos12, the agent is at pos22. How can the agent get to pos11? Let's see:

Agent is at pos22 after the first push. From pos22, the agent can move to pos12 (dirleft), pos32 (dirright), pos21 (dirup), or pos23 (dirdown). But pos12 now has the stone. So moving to pos12 is blocked. So the agent can move dirup to pos21 (2,1), then dirleft to pos11 (1,1). Then from pos11, the agent can push the stone from pos12 to pos13 via dirdown.

But let's see step by step:

After first push:

- Agent is at pos22.
- Stone is at pos12.

Agent needs to move to pos11 to push the stone to pos13.

From pos22, the agent can move dirup to pos21 (2,1) (since dirup from pos22 is left along the row, column decreases). Then, from pos21, move dirleft (up a column) to pos11 (1,1). Then, agent is at pos11.

Then, perform pushtonongoal to push the stone from pos12 to pos13. The action would be:

"pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown"

Check preconditions:

- Agent is at pos11 (yes)
- Stone is at pos12 (yes)
- pos13 is clear (initially yes)
- Can move from pos11 to pos12 via dirdown (yes, as per the movement options)
- Can move from pos12 to pos13 via dirdown (yes)
- pos13 is not a goal (yes, so pushtonongoal is correct)

After this action:

- Agent moves to pos12.
- Stone moves to pos13.

Then, the agent is at pos12. Next, push the stone to pos14. To do that, agent needs to be at pos13 (to push dirdown) or pos12's adjacent positions.

Wait, the stone is now at pos13. To push it to pos14 (right along the row), the agent needs to be at a position adjacent to pos13 in the direction opposite to the push. So the agent needs to be at pos12 (dirup from pos13) or pos14 (dirdown from pos13). Let's see:

If agent is at pos12, then direction from pos12 to pos13 is dirdown (right along the row). So pushing in dirdown would move the stone from pos13 to pos14.

So after pushing to pos13, the agent is at pos12. From there, they can perform "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirdown".

But need to check if pos14 is clear. Initially, pos14 is clear. So yes.

So action:

"pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirdown"

After that, stone is at pos14, agent is at pos13.

Then, push the stone to pos15 (goal location). For this, agent needs to push from pos14 to pos15. Since pos15 is a goal location, this would be a "pushtogoal" action.

To push from pos14 to pos15 (dirdown, right along the row), the agent must be adjacent to pos14 in the direction opposite to the push. So agent needs to be at pos13 (dirup from pos14) or pos15 (dirdown from pos14).

But pos15 is a goal location. So the agent can be at pos13, and push the stone to pos15.

So the action would be "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown".

Check preconditions:

- Agent at pos13 (yes)
- Stone at pos14 (yes)
- pos15 is clear (initially yes)
- Can move from pos13 to pos14 via dirdown (yes, according to movement options: "You may move from location pos13 to location pos14 following direction dirdown")
- Can move from pos14 to pos15 via dirdown (yes, "You may move from location pos14 to location pos15 following direction dirdown")
- pos15 is a goal (yes)

So this action is valid.

Putting it all together:

1. Agent moves from pos21 to pos31 via dirright.
2. Agent moves from pos31 to pos32 via dirdown.
3. Agent pushes stone1 from pos22 to pos12 using pushtonongoal.
4. Agent moves from pos22 to pos21 via dirup.
5. Agent moves from pos21 to pos11 via dirleft.
6. Agent pushes stone1 from pos12 to pos13 using pushtonongoal.
7. Agent pushes stone1 from pos13 to pos14 using pushtonongoal.
8. Agent pushes stone1 from pos14 to pos15 using pushtogoal.

Wait, but after step 3, the agent is at pos22. Then step 4 is moving from pos22 to pos21. But after step 3, the agent's new location is pos22 (since after pushing, the agent moves to l_from, which was pos22). But after pushing, the stone moves from pos22 to pos12. So pos22 is clear now. So agent can move from pos22 to pos21 via dirup.

Then steps 4 and 5 get the agent to pos11. Then steps 6-8 push the stone to pos15.

But is this the shortest path? Let's count the actions:

1. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
2. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft
4. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
5. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown
7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirdown
8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown

But step 7 requires the agent to be at pos12, but after step 6, the agent is at pos12 (since after pushing, the agent moves to l_from, which is pos12). Then, step7 would be pushing from pos13 to pos14. Wait, no. After step6, the stone is at pos13, agent is at pos12. So to push the stone from pos13 to pos14, the agent needs to be at pos12 (dirup from pos13) and direction dirdown. So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirdown.

Yes, that's valid. Then after step7, the agent moves to pos13, and the stone is at pos14. Then step8 is pushing from pos14 to pos15. The agent is at pos13, can move to pos14 via dirdown (since movement from pos13 to pos14 is allowed via dirdown). Wait, but the agent is at pos13, and wants to push from pos14 to pos15. So the agent needs to be adjacent to pos14 in the direction of the push. The push direction is dirdown (from pos14 to pos15). So the agent must be at pos13 (dirup from pos14), then push in dirdown direction. So action is "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown".

Yes, that's correct. So steps 6,7,8 are correct.

But can we optimize this? Let's see:

After step3, the agent is at pos22. Instead of moving back to pos21 and then to pos11, maybe find a shorter path. From pos22, the agent can move to pos23 via dirdown (right along the row), then to pos24, etc., but that might not help. Alternatively, from pos22, move dirup (left along the row) to pos21, then dirleft to pos11.

But that's two steps. Is there a way to get to pos11 faster? Probably not, since from pos22, the agent can't move directly to pos12 (blocked by stone). So steps 4 and 5 are necessary.

Alternatively, after step3, the agent is at pos22. Can the agent move from pos22 to pos12 (dirleft, which is up a column), but pos12 now has the stone. So it's blocked. So no. So steps 4 and 5 are needed.

Another approach: Maybe instead of moving the agent all the way to pos32 to push the stone up to pos12, the agent can push the stone from pos22 to pos23, then to pos24, pos25, and then up to pos15. Let's explore that path.

Original agent position: pos21.

Plan B:

1. Move agent from pos21 to pos22 (dirdown). But pos22 is occupied by the stone, so can't move there. So this is impossible.

Alternative Plan B: Agent moves around to the right side of the stone.

From pos21, move dirright to pos31 (3,1). Then dirdown to pos32 (3,2). Then push the stone to pos33 (3,3) using dirright (down a column). Wait, no. The stone is at pos22. To push it right along the row (dirdown), the agent needs to be at pos23 (which is blocked by stone's current location). Wait, this approach might not work.

Alternatively, after moving to pos32, push the stone to pos23 (dirleft). Wait, no. pos23 is to the right along the row from pos22. To push the stone to pos23, the agent needs to be at pos22's right side. But the stone is at pos22. So the agent can't be there. Hmm.

Alternatively, from pos32, push the stone to pos12 (dirleft), then proceed as before. Which is what the original plan does.

So perhaps the original plan is the shortest.

But let's count the number of actions in the original plan: 8 actions.

Alternative approach: 

After step3 (stone at pos12, agent at pos22), the agent could move to pos23 (dirdown from pos22), then to pos24, pos25, then to pos15. But how? Let's see:

After step3, agent is at pos22. From pos22, move dirdown to pos23 (2,3). Then move dirdown to pos24 (2,4), then pos25 (2,5). Then move dirleft to pos15 (1,5). But dirleft from pos25 is up a column. So from pos25 to pos15 is dirleft. But is that allowed? According to the movement options: "You may move from location pos25 to location pos15 following direction dirleft". Yes. So agent can move from pos25 to pos15. But then, the agent is at pos15. But the stone is at pos12. How does that help? The agent needs to push the stone from pos12 to pos15. So this path doesn't help.

Another idea: After pushing the stone to pos12, perhaps the agent can push it up to pos11, but pos11 is not a goal. Not helpful.

So the original plan seems necessary. But wait, maybe there's a shorter path.

Wait, after step3, the agent is at pos22. Then, instead of moving to pos21 and then to pos11, maybe the agent can move from pos22 to pos12 (dirleft), but pos12 has the stone now. So it's blocked. So no. So steps 4 and 5 are needed.

So the plan would be 8 actions. But is there a way to optimize this?

Alternatively, after step3 (stone at pos12, agent at pos22), agent can move to pos23 (dirdown), then pos24, pos25, then up to pos15, and push the stone from pos15 to pos15? No. The stone is at pos12. So this doesn't help.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos12, the agent needs to get to pos11 to push it right. So steps 4 and 5 are necessary.

So the total actions are 8. But let's see if any steps can be merged.

Wait, after step3, the agent is at pos22. Then steps4 and5 are moving to pos21 and then to pos11. Can we find a shorter path? From pos22 to pos11:

Pos22 to pos21 (dirup) is one action. Then pos21 to pos11 (dirleft) is another. Total two moves. So steps4 and5 are correct.

Is there a way to push the stone from pos12 to pos13 without the agent going to pos11? For example, if the agent is at pos13, can they push the stone to pos13 from another direction? No, because the stone is at pos12. The agent needs to be adjacent to pos12 in the direction of the push. For pushing to pos13 (dirdown), the agent must be at pos12's dirup (pos11) or dirdown (pos13) position. But pos13 is clear. So agent could move to pos13 and push from there.

Wait, if the agent is at pos13, then the direction from pos13 to pos12 is dirup. So pushing in dirup direction would move the stone from pos12 to pos11. Which is not helpful. So to push to pos13, the agent must be at pos11 or pos12's dirdown direction.

Alternatively, the agent is at pos12 (but after step3, the stone is at pos12, so pos12 is blocked. So agent can't be there.

So no, the agent must be at pos11 to push the stone to pos13.

Thus, steps4 and5 are necessary.

So the plan of 8 actions seems to be the shortest possible. Let's verify each step for preconditions and effects.

Step1: move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright.

Preconditions: agent is at pos21 (yes), pos31 is clear (yes), movement allowed. Yes.

Step2: move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown.

Preconditions: agent at pos31 (yes), pos32 clear (yes), movement allowed (from pos31 to pos32 via dirdown). Yes.

Step3: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos32 (yes)
- Stone at pos22 (yes)
- pos12 clear (yes)
- Can move from pos32 to pos22 via dirleft (yes, since pos32 can move to pos22 via dirleft)
- Can move from pos22 to pos12 via dirleft (yes)
- pos12 is not a goal (yes)

Effects:

- Agent moves to pos22
- Stone moves to pos12
- pos32 becomes clear
- pos22 becomes agent's location
- pos12 has stone
- Stone is at non-goal.

Yes.

Step4: move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup.

Preconditions: agent at pos22 (yes), pos21 clear (yes, after step3, pos21 was clear initially and agent moved away from pos21 in step1. After step1, pos21 is clear again (since agent moved to pos31). So pos21 is clear. Movement from pos22 to pos21 is dirup (left along the row). Yes, allowed.

Step5: move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft.

Preconditions: agent at pos21 (yes), pos11 clear (yes), movement allowed (pos21 to pos11 via dirleft). Yes.

Step6: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos11 (yes)
- Stone at pos12 (yes)
- pos13 clear (yes)
- Can move from pos11 to pos12 via dirdown (yes)
- Can move from pos12 to pos13 via dirdown (yes)
- pos13 is not a goal (yes)

Effects:

- Agent moves to pos12
- Stone moves to pos13
- pos11 becomes clear
- pos13 has stone

Step7: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirdown.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos12 (yes)
- Stone at pos13 (yes)
- pos14 clear (yes)
- Can move from pos12 to pos13 via dirdown (yes)
- Can move from pos13 to pos14 via dirdown (yes)
- pos14 is not a goal (yes)

Effects:

- Agent moves to pos13
- Stone moves to pos14

Step8: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos13 (yes)
- Stone at pos14 (yes)
- pos15 clear (yes)
- Can move from pos13 to pos14 via dirdown (yes)
- Can move from pos14 to pos15 via dirdown (yes)
- pos15 is a goal (yes)

Effects:

- Agent moves to pos14
- Stone moves to pos15 (goal achieved)

This seems valid. So the plan has 8 actions. But is there a way to reduce this?

Wait, after step3, the agent is at pos22. Instead of moving to pos21 and then pos11, can the agent move directly to pos11 from pos22? Let's see:

From pos22, possible moves are dirup (to pos21), dirleft (to pos12, blocked), dirright (to pos32, clear), or dirdown (to pos23, clear). So no, can't move directly to pos11 from pos22. So steps4 and5 are necessary.

Another thought: After step3, the stone is at pos12. The agent is at pos22. Instead of moving to pos21 and then pos11, perhaps the agent can take a different path. For example:

From pos22, move dirright to pos32 (but pos32 is clear). Then move dirup to pos31, then dirleft to pos21, then dirleft to pos11. But that would take more steps. So steps4 and5 are better.

Alternatively, agent at pos22 could move to pos23 (dirdown), then pos24, pos25, pos15, but how does that help? The stone is at pos12, and the agent is far away.

No, that doesn't help. So original plan is better.

Another optimization: After step6, the agent is at pos12. Then step7 requires moving to pos12 to push the stone to pos14. Wait, no. After step6, the agent is at pos12 (from the push action). Then, the stone is at pos13. To push it to pos14, the agent is at pos12, and the direction from pos12 to pos13 is dirdown (since pos13 is right of pos12). So the agent can push in dirdown direction, moving the stone from pos13 to pos14. That's valid.

So step7 is correct.

After step7, the agent is at pos13. Then, step8 is pushing from pos14 to pos15. The agent is at pos13, which is adjacent to pos14 via dirdown (right along the row). So direction from pos13 to pos14 is dirdown. So pushing in dirdown direction moves the stone from pos14 to pos15. Yes.

So steps are correct.

So the plan is valid and has 8 actions. Is there a way to make it shorter?

Alternative approach: After step3, the stone is at pos12. The agent is at pos22. Instead of moving to pos21 and pos11, perhaps the agent can move to pos12 via another path. Wait, pos12 is occupied by the stone. So agent can't move there. So no.

Another idea: Can the agent push the stone from pos12 to pos13 without moving to pos11? For example, if the agent is at pos13. But how to get there.

From pos22, agent can move dirdown to pos23 (clear), then dirdown to pos24 (clear), then dirdown to pos25 (clear), then dirleft to pos15 (goal). But then, the agent is at pos15, but the stone is at pos12. Not helpful.

Alternatively, from pos22, agent moves dirright to pos32 (clear), then dirdown to pos33 (clear), then dirleft to pos23 (clear), then dirup to pos13 (clear). Now agent is at pos13. Then push the stone from pos12 to pos13. But the direction from pos13 to pos12 is dirup. So pushing in dirup would move the stone from pos12 to pos11. Not helpful. So agent needs to be at pos11 to push the stone to pos13.

Thus, steps4 and5 are necessary.

Thus, the original plan is optimal with 8 actions. But perhaps there's a shorter path. Let's think again.

Alternative Plan:

1. Move agent from pos21 to pos22 via dirdown. But pos22 is occupied by the stone. Not possible.

Another Plan:

Agent needs to push the stone from pos22 to pos23 (right), then pos24, pos25, then up to pos15. How?

To push from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown), agent needs to be at pos22's dirdown direction. Wait, the stone is at pos22. To push it to pos23 (right along the row), the agent needs to be at pos22's dirup (left along the row) or dirdown (right along the row). But the agent can't be at pos22 because it's occupied by the stone. So the agent needs to be at pos21 (dirup from pos22) or pos23 (dirdown from pos22). 

Wait, pos21 is (2,1), and pos23 is (2,3). So to push the stone from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown), the agent must be at pos23. But pos23 is clear. So agent can move to pos23, then push the stone from pos22 to pos23. But how?

Wait, the agent needs to be at a location l_p adjacent to pos22 (stone's current location) via direction d. To push the stone in dirdown (right along the row), the direction d must be dirdown. So the agent must be at pos23 (dirdown from pos22). But pos23 is to the right of pos22. So the direction from pos23 to pos22 is dirup (left along the row). So pushing in dirup direction would move the stone from pos22 to pos21. Not helpful.

Alternatively, the agent is at pos21 (dirup from pos22), which is up along the row (left direction). So direction from pos21 to pos22 is dirdown (right along the row). So pushing in dirdown direction would move the stone from pos22 to pos23. But the agent is at pos21. 

Wait, the agent is at pos21 (2,1). The stone is at pos22 (2,2). The direction from pos21 to pos22 is dirdown (right along the row). So the agent can push the stone in dirdown direction from pos22 to pos23. 

So action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirdown.

But check preconditions:

- Agent at pos21 (yes)
- Stone at pos22 (yes)
- pos23 clear (yes)
- Can move from pos21 to pos22 via dirdown (yes, "You may move from location pos21 to location pos22 following direction dirdown")
- Can move from pos22 to pos23 via dirdown (yes, "You may move from location pos22 to location pos23 following direction dirdown")
- pos23 is not a goal (yes)

Yes, this action is valid. So this is a better approach. 

So this action would push the stone from pos22 to pos23, with the agent moving to pos22. Then, from pos23, push the stone to pos24, then pos25, then up to pos15.

Let's outline this plan:

1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirdown.

Agent is now at pos22. Stone at pos23.

Then:

2. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown.

Agent moves to pos23. Stone at pos24.

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown.

Agent moves to pos24. Stone at pos25.

4. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos25 pos15 dirleft.

Agent moves to pos25. Stone at pos15.

This would be a plan of 4 actions, which is much shorter.

But does this work?

Let's verify each step.

Step1: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirdown.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos21 (yes)
- Stone at pos22 (yes)
- pos23 clear (yes)
- Can move from pos21 to pos22 via dirdown (yes)
- Can move from pos22 to pos23 via dirdown (yes)
- pos23 is not a goal (yes)

Effects:

- Agent moves to pos22
- Stone moves to pos23

Step2: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos22 (yes)
- Stone at pos23 (yes)
- pos24 clear (yes)
- Can move from pos22 to pos23 via dirdown (yes)
- Can move from pos23 to pos24 via dirdown (yes)
- pos24 is not a goal (yes)

Effects:

- Agent moves to pos23
- Stone moves to pos24

Step3: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos23 (yes)
- Stone at pos24 (yes)
- pos25 clear (yes)
- Can move from pos23 to pos24 via dirdown (yes)
- Can move from pos24 to pos25 via dirdown (yes)
- pos25 is not a goal (yes)

Effects:

- Agent moves to pos24
- Stone moves to pos25

Step4: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos25 pos15 dirleft.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos24 (yes)
- Stone at pos25 (yes)
- pos15 clear (yes)
- Can move from pos24 to pos25 via dirleft (wait, direction is dirleft. Let's check the movement connections. From pos24 to pos25 is dirdown (right along the row), but the direction to push is dirleft (up a column). Wait, the agent is at pos24 (2,4), stone is at pos25 (2,5). To push the stone to pos15 (1,5), which is up a column. So the direction from pos24 to pos25 is dirdown (right along the row). But to push the stone up a column, the agent must be at pos25's dirleft direction, which is pos15. But the agent is at pos24 (2,4), so how can they push the stone from pos25 to pos15?

Wait, the agent is at pos24 (2,4). The stone is at pos25 (2,5). To push the stone from pos25 to pos15 (1,5), the agent must be at a position adjacent to pos25 in the direction of the push. The direction of the push is dirleft (up a column). So the agent must be at pos25's dirleft direction, which is pos15 (1,5), but pos15 is two steps up. That's not adjacent. Wait, no.

Wait, to push the stone from pos25 to pos15 (up a column), the direction must be dirleft. So the agent must be at pos35 (3,5) and push the stone up. But that's not possible here.

Alternatively, the agent must be at pos24 (2,4) and push the stone to pos25 (2,5) via dirdown, but that's already done. Then, the agent is at pos24 and needs to push the stone from pos25 to pos15. How can the agent do that?

Wait, the agent is at pos24 (2,4) after step3. The stone is at pos25 (2,5). To push the stone from pos25 to pos15 (1,5), the agent must be at pos25's dirleft direction, which is pos15. But pos15 is not adjacent to pos25. The adjacent locations to pos25 are pos24 (left), pos35 (down), and pos15 (up). But according to the movement options, from pos25, you can move to pos15 via dirleft. So direction dirleft from pos25 is up a column. So the agent must be at pos25's adjacent location in the direction opposite to the push. But pos15 is not adjacent to pos25. Wait, pos25 is (2,5). pos15 is (1,5). So they are adjacent vertically. So the direction from pos25 to pos15 is dirleft (up a column). So the agent must be at pos35 (3,5) to push the stone up. But pos35 is clear, but the agent is at pos24 (2,4).

This indicates that the agent cannot directly push the stone from pos25 to pos15 in one action. Because the agent needs to be at pos35 (down a column from pos25) to push it dirleft (up a column). So the agent needs to move from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown), but pos25 has the stone. So agent can't move there. Alternatively, agent needs to move around to pos35.

But this would require additional steps.

So perhaps the plan needs to continue as:

After step3, agent is at pos24, stone at pos25.

Agent needs to move to pos34 (down a column from pos24), then pos35, then pos25 (but blocked by stone). Wait, no. Let's think:

From pos24, agent can move dirright to pos34 (3,4) (down a column). Then move dirdown to pos35 (3,5). Then push the stone from pos25 to pos15 via dirleft.

So steps would be:

4. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright

5. move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown

6. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos25 pos15 dirleft.

So this adds three more steps, making the total plan 6 actions. Which is still better than the original 8.

But let's verify:

Step4: move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright (from pos24 (2,4) to pos34 (3,4)).

Preconditions: agent at pos24 (yes), pos34 clear (yes), movement allowed (from pos24 to pos34 via dirright (down a column)). Yes.

Step5: move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown (right along the row from pos34 (3,4) to pos35 (3,5)).

Preconditions: agent at pos34, pos35 clear, movement allowed. Yes.

Step6: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos25 pos15 dirleft.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos35 (yes)
- Stone at pos25 (yes)
- pos15 clear (yes)
- Can move from pos35 to pos25 via dirleft (up a column) (Yes, according to movement options: "You may move from location pos35 to location pos25 following direction dirleft").
- Can move from pos25 to pos15 via dirleft (Yes).
- pos15 is a goal (yes)

Effects:

- Agent moves to pos25
- Stone moves to pos15

So this plan would have 6 actions: steps1-3 as pushtonongoal steps, steps4-6 as moves and pushtogoal.

But wait, after step3, the agent is at pos24. Then steps4 and5 are moving to pos34 and pos35. Then step6 is pushing from pos35 to pos25, but the stone is at pos25. So pushing from pos25 to pos15. So step6 is valid.

This would give a total of 6 actions, which is better than the original 8.

But this requires that the agent can move from pos35 to pos25 via dirleft. According to the movement options: "You may move from location pos35 to location pos25 following direction dirleft". Yes.

So this plan is valid and shorter.

But wait, can the agent push the stone from pos25 to pos15 directly if the agent is at pos35?

Yes. So the plan would be:

1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirdown (agent moves to pos22, stone to pos23)
2. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown (agent to pos23, stone to pos24)
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown (agent to pos24, stone to pos25)
4. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright (agent to pos34)
5. move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown (agent to pos35)
6. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos25 pos15 dirleft (agent to pos25, stone to pos15)

Total of 6 actions.

This seems better. But is there a way to reduce further?

Alternative approach after step3: Instead of moving to pos34 and pos35, perhaps the agent can move directly from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown), but pos25 has the stone. So can't move there.

Alternatively, from pos24, move dirdown to pos25 (but it's blocked), so no.

So steps4 and5 are necessary.

But this plan is 6 actions, which is shorter than the original 8. So this is better.

So the optimal plan is:

```
1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirdown
2. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown
4. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
5. move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown
6. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos25 pos15 dirleft
```

But wait, after step3, the agent is at pos24. Then steps4 and5 move to pos34 and pos35. Then step6 pushes the stone from pos25 to pos15. 

Yes, this works. So this plan is valid and has 6 actions. 

But we need to check if each action's preconditions are met.

Step1: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirdown.

Preconditions met: yes.

Step2: agent is at pos22, stone at pos23. Push to pos24.

Preconditions: agent at pos22, stone at pos23, pos24 clear, movement from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown?), wait:

Wait, the agent is at pos22, and needs to push the stone from pos23 to pos24. For this, the agent must be at a position adjacent to pos23 in the direction of the push. The direction of the push is dirdown (right along the row). So the agent must be at pos23's dirup (left along the row) position, which is pos22. So direction from agent's location (pos22) to stone's location (pos23) is dirdown. So the action is valid.

Step2: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos22 (yes)
- Stone at pos23 (yes)
- pos24 clear (yes)
- Can move from pos22 to pos23 via dirdown (yes)
- Can move from pos23 to pos24 via dirdown (yes)
- pos24 is not a goal (yes)

Yes.

Step3: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown.

Agent is at pos23, stone at pos24. Push to pos25.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos23 (yes)
- Stone at pos24 (yes)
- pos25 clear (yes)
- Can move from pos23 to pos24 via dirdown (yes)
- Can move from pos24 to pos25 via dirdown (yes)
- pos25 is not a goal (yes)

Yes.

Step4: move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright.

Agent is at pos24. pos34 is clear. Movement allowed (dirright from pos24 to pos34). Yes.

Step5: move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown.

Agent at pos34. pos35 is clear. Movement allowed (dirdown from pos34 to pos35). Yes.

Step6: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos25 pos15 dirleft.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos35 (yes)
- Stone at pos25 (yes)
- pos15 clear (yes)
- Can move from pos35 to pos25 via dirleft (yes)
- Can move from pos25 to pos15 via dirleft (yes)
- pos15 is a goal (yes)

Yes.

This plan is valid and shorter than the initial approach. So this is the optimal plan with 6 actions.
