This is a Sokoban-like problem where we have an agent (player1) pushing a stone (stone1) around a 5x5 grid. The goal is to get the stone to a goal location, which is pos15. Let me start by understanding the initial state and constraints better.

Initial State:
- Player is at pos21 (row 2, column 1)
- Stone is at pos22 (row 2, column 2)
- Goal location is pos15 (row 1, column 5)
- Everything else is clear

We have three actions:
1. move: Move the player
2. pushtogoal: Push a stone to a goal location
3. pushtonongoal: Push a stone to a non-goal location

The constraints are quite complex, so let me analyze them:

1. Position pos13 must not be clear at some point (so either player or stone must be there)
2. Position pos24 must not be clear at some point
3. Before pos24 becomes not clear, player must be at pos33
4. Player must be at pos24 at some point
5. Before player is at pos24, player must be at pos51
6. Position pos15 (the goal) must not be clear at some point
7. After pos15 becomes not clear, player must be at pos21 or pos44
8. Position pos24 must only be occupied in one continuous sequence
9. Position pos31 must not be clear at some point
10. Position pos34 must always remain clear
11. Stone must be at pos23 at some point
12. After stone is at pos23, pos54 must not be clear
13. Position pos35 must only be occupied in one continuous sequence
14. Stone must be at pos25 at some point
15. Before stone is at pos25, either player must be at pos12 or pos33 must not be clear

Now I need to figure out a plan that gets the stone to the goal location (pos15) while satisfying all these constraints. This is a complex path-finding problem.

Let me visualize the grid to better understand the problem:

```
11 12 13 14 15 (Goal)
21 22 23 24 25
31 32 33 34 35
41 42 43 44 45
51 52 53 54 55
```

Initial state:
```
.. .. .. .. G.
P. S. .. .. ..
.. .. .. .. ..
.. .. .. .. ..
.. .. .. .. ..
```

Where P is the player, S is the stone, G is the goal.

Let's start planning:

First, I need to get the stone to pos15 (the goal). To do this, I'll need to push it up the grid. 

Let's also consider the constraints. I need to ensure that:
- pos13, pos24, pos15, pos31 are all occupied at some point
- player is at pos33 before pos24 is occupied
- player is at pos51 before player is at pos24
- player is at pos21 or pos44 after pos15 is occupied
- stone is at pos23 at some point
- stone is at pos25 at some point
- either player is at pos12 or pos33 is not clear before stone is at pos25
- pos54 is not clear after stone is at pos23
- pos34 must always remain clear
- pos24 and pos35 each can only be occupied once

This is quite complex, so let me try to find a valid path to get the stone to the goal while satisfying these constraints.

Initial state:
- Player at pos21
- Stone at pos22

Let's try to plan a path:

1. First, I need to get to a position where I can push the stone. I'm at pos21, and the stone is at pos22. I can't push it from here, so I need to move.

2. I could move to pos11, then to pos12, then to pos22, which would allow me to push the stone from pos22 to pos23.

3. Then I need to get behind the stone again to push it further. I could go to pos13, then pos23, and push the stone from pos23 to pos24.

4. Then I need to get behind the stone again, so I go to pos14, then pos24, and push from pos24 to pos25.

5. Finally, I go to pos15, then pos25, and push from pos25 to pos15 (the goal).

But I need to make sure all the constraints are satisfied. Let me check them one by one:

Let's try a different approach: I'll plan to satisfy the constraints first:

1. Stone must be at pos23 at some point, and after that, pos54 must not be clear.
2. Stone must be at pos25 at some point, and before that, player must be at pos12 or pos33 must not be clear.
3. Player must be at pos33 before pos24 is not clear.
4. Player must be at pos51 before player is at pos24.
5. After pos15 is not clear, player must be at pos21 or pos44.

Let me try to construct a plan:

1. Starting at pos21, I can move to pos31, then pos41, then pos51 (satisfying the requirement of being at pos51).
2. From pos51, I can move to pos41, pos31, pos32, pos33 (satisfying the requirement of being at pos33).
3. From pos33, I can move to pos23. At this point, I can push the stone from pos22 to pos23 (satisfying the requirement of stone being at pos23).
4. After that, I need to make pos54 not clear, so I'll need to move there. I'll go from pos23 to pos33, pos43, pos53, pos54.
5. Now I need to get back to the stone. I'll move from pos54 to pos53, pos43, pos33, pos23.
6. From pos23, I can push the stone from pos23 to pos24.
7. Now I need to move from pos23 to pos13, pos12 (satisfying the requirement of being at pos12 or having pos33 not clear).
8. From pos12, I'll move to pos13, pos14, pos24. I'm now at pos24 (satisfying the requirement of being at pos24), and pos24 is not clear before this because it had the stone.
9. From pos24, I'll push the stone from pos24 to pos25 (satisfying the requirement of stone being at pos25).
10. From pos24, I'll move to pos14, pos15, then pos25.
11. From pos25, I can push the stone from pos25 to pos15 (the goal).
12. After the stone is at the goal (pos15), I need to move to either pos21 or pos44. I'll move to pos25, pos35, pos45, pos44 (satisfying the requirement of being at pos21 or pos44 after pos15 is not clear).

Let me check if this plan satisfies all the constraints:

1. ✅ pos13 must not be clear at some point - Player is at pos13 at step 7-8.
2. ✅ pos24 must not be clear at some point - Stone is at pos24 at step 7-9.
3. ✅ Player must be at pos33 before pos24 is not clear - Player is at pos33 at step 2-3, and pos24 becomes not clear at step 7.
4. ✅ Player must be at pos24 at some point - Player is at pos24 at step 8-9.
5. ✅ Player must be at pos51 before player is at pos24 - Player is at pos51 at step 1-2, and at pos24 at step 8-9.
6. ✅ pos15 must not be clear at some point - Stone is at pos15 (the goal) at step 11.
7. ✅ After pos15 is not clear, player must be at pos21 or pos44 - Player moves to pos44 at step 12 after stone is at pos15.
8. ✅ pos24 must only be occupied in one continuous sequence - Stone is at pos24 at step 7-9, and player is at pos24 at step 8-9, which is a single continuous sequence.
9. ✅ pos31 must not be clear at some point - Player is at pos31 at step 1-2.
10. ❓ pos34 must always remain clear - I'm pretty sure my plan doesn't involve pos34, but I should double-check.
11. ✅ Stone must be at pos23 at some point - Stone is at pos23 at step 3-6.
12. ✅ After stone is at pos23, pos54 must not be clear - Player is at pos54 at step 4-5 after stone is at pos23.
13. ❓ pos35 must only be occupied in one continuous sequence - Player is at pos35 at step 12, which is a single continuous sequence.
14. ✅ Stone must be at pos25 at some point - Stone is at pos25 at step 9-11.
15. ✅ Before stone is at pos25, either player must be at pos12 or pos33 must not be clear - Player is at pos12 at step 7-8, and stone is at pos25 at step 9-11.

Let me refine the plan a bit more and make sure all steps and constraints are covered:

Let's enumerate the exact plan and states:

1. Initial state: Player at pos21, Stone at pos22
2. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright - Player at pos31, Stone at pos22
3. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright - Player at pos41, Stone at pos22
4. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright - Player at pos51, Stone at pos22
5. move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft - Player at pos41, Stone at pos22
6. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft - Player at pos31, Stone at pos22
7. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown - Player at pos32, Stone at pos22
8. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown - Player at pos33, Stone at pos22
9. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft - Player at pos23, Stone at pos22
10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos23 dirleft - Player at pos22, Stone at pos23 (stone is now at pos23, constraint 11 satisfied)
11. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright - Player at pos32, Stone at pos23
12. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown - Player at pos33, Stone at pos23
13. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright - Player at pos43, Stone at pos23
14. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright - Player at pos53, Stone at pos23
15. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown - Player at pos54, Stone at pos23 (pos54 is not clear after stone is at pos23, constraint 12 satisfied)
16. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup - Player at pos53, Stone at pos23
17. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft - Player at pos43, Stone at pos23
18. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft - Player at pos33, Stone at pos23
19. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft - Player at pos23, Stone at pos23
20. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos23 pos24 dirdown - Player at pos23, Stone at pos24 (stone is now at pos24, pos24 is not clear, constraint 2 satisfied, and player was at pos33 before, constraint 3 satisfied)
21. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft - Player at pos13, Stone at pos24 (pos13 is not clear, constraint 1 satisfied)
22. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup - Player at pos12, Stone at pos24 (player is at pos12, part of constraint 15 satisfied)
23. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown - Player at pos13, Stone at pos24
24. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown - Player at pos14, Stone at pos24
25. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright - Player at pos24, Stone at pos24 (player is at pos24, constraint 4 satisfied, and player was at pos51 before, constraint 5 satisfied)
26. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos24 pos25 dirdown - Player at pos24, Stone at pos25 (stone is at pos25, constraint 14 satisfied)
27. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft - Player at pos14, Stone at pos25
28. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown - Player at pos15, Stone at pos25
29. move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright - Player at pos25, Stone at pos25
30. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos25 pos15 dirleft - Player at pos25, Stone at pos15 (stone is now at the goal, pos15 is not clear, constraint 6 satisfied)
31. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright - Player at pos35, Stone at pos15 (pos35 is not clear, part of constraint 13 satisfied)
32. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright - Player at pos45, Stone at pos15
33. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup - Player at pos44, Stone at pos15 (player is at pos44 after pos15 is not clear, constraint 7 satisfied)

Let me double-check all constraints again:

1. ✅ pos13 must not be clear at some point - Player is at pos13 at steps 21 and 23.
2. ✅ pos24 must not be clear at some point - Stone is at pos24 at steps 20-26, and player is at pos24 at steps 25-26.
3. ✅ Player must be at pos33 before pos24 is not clear - Player is at pos33 at steps 8-9 and 12-13 and 18-19, and pos24 becomes not clear at step 20.
4. ✅ Player must be at pos24 at some point - Player is at pos24 at steps 25-26.
5. ✅ Player must be at pos51 before player is at pos24 - Player is at pos51 at step 4, and at pos24 at step 25-26.
6. ✅ pos15 must not be clear at some point - Stone is at pos15 (the goal) at steps 30-33.
7. ✅ After pos15 is not clear, player must be at pos21 or pos44 - Player moves to pos44 at step 33 after stone is at pos15.
8. ✅ pos24 must only be occupied in one continuous sequence - pos24 is occupied by stone and player at steps 20-26, which is a single continuous sequence.
9. ✅ pos31 must not be clear at some point - Player is at pos31 at steps 2-3 and 6-7.
10. ✅ pos34 must always remain clear - The plan doesn't involve pos34, so it remains clear.
11. ✅ Stone must be at pos23 at some point - Stone is at pos23 at steps 10-19.
12. ✅ After stone is at pos23, pos54 must not be clear - Player is at pos54 at step 15 after stone is at pos23.
13. ✅ pos35 must only be occupied in one continuous sequence - Player is at pos35 at step 31, which is a single continuous sequence.
14. ✅ Stone must be at pos25 at some point - Stone is at pos25 at steps 26-29.
15. ✅ Before stone is at pos25, either player must be at pos12 or pos33 must not be clear - Player is at pos12 at step 22, and stone is at pos25 at steps 26-29.

All constraints are satisfied! Now let me formalize the plan:

```
move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft
move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown
move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos23 dirleft
move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright
move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright
move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft
move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos23 pos24 dirdown
move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos24 pos25 dirdown
move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft
move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown
move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos25 pos15 dirleft
move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright
move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright
move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
```

Wait, let me check something. The initial state says:
```
"Location pos21 is clear"
"Location pos22 is clear"
```

But the initial state also says:
```
"player1 is at location pos21"
"stone1 is at location pos22"
```

This seems contradictory. Let me assume that the correct state is that player1 is at pos21 and stone1 is at pos22, and the "clear" statements are mistakes.

Actually, wait. I need to reread the problem. The problem statement says:

```
Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty. Each position is flagged as either a goal position or a non-goal position.
```

So a location is "clear" if it doesn't contain an agent or a stone. But the initla state says both that locations pos21 and pos22 are clear, and that they contain the player and stone respectively. This is a contradiction. Let me assume the correct interpretation is that:

- Player is at pos21 (so pos21 is not clear)
- Stone is at pos22 (so pos22 is not clear)

Ok, let me check the pushtonongoal and pushtogoal actions:

For pushtonongoal, the player must be adjacent to the stone in the direction of the push, and the space behind the stone (in the direction of the push) must be clear.

For pushtogoal, same as pushtonongoal, but the space behind the stone must be a goal location.

I think there's an error in my understanding. Ok, so let's revise:

In step 9, the player is at pos23, and the stone is at pos22. I want to use pushtonongoal to push the stone from pos22 to pos23. This means the player is at pos23, the stone is at pos22, and I want to push it left. But that's not correct because the player is to the right of the stone, and I'm trying to push left.

I think I've been misunderstanding the directions. Let's clarify the grid layout:

```
11 12 13 14 15 (Goal)
21 22 23 24 25
31 32 33 34 35
41 42 43 44 45
51 52 53 54 55
```

If the player is at pos23 and the stone is at pos22, then the player is to the right of the stone. So if I push left, the stone would move to the left (from pos22 to pos21), and the player would move to where the stone was (from pos23 to pos22). But that's not what I want to do.

Let me reapproach the directions. In this context, I think:
- dirup means move from a higher position to a lower position (i.e., 21 to 11, moving one row up)
- dirdown means move from a lower position to a higher position (i.e., 11 to 21, moving one row down)
- dirleft means move from a higher position to a lower position in the same row (i.e., 21 to 11, moving one column left)
- dirright means move from a lower position to a higher position in the same row (i.e., 11 to 21, moving one column right)

That doesn't make sense. Let me reconsider.

Ok, I think I understand: 
- dirup means move from a position with a higher first digit to a lower first digit (i.e., 21 to 11, moving one row up)
- dirdown means move from a position with a lower first digit to a higher first digit (i.e., 11 to 21, moving one row down)
- dirleft means move from a position with a higher second digit to a lower second digit (i.e., 21 to 20, moving one column left)
- dirright means move from a position with a lower second digit to a higher second digit (i.e., 20 to 21, moving one column right)

OK, I noticed that the initial starting states are different in the "original state of the world" section versus the "constraints" section. I should use the "original state of the world" section. Based on this:

Initial state:
- Player is at pos21
- Stone is at pos22

But I also notice there's a flaw in the position names: they should be (row, column), so pos21 is the second column of the first row. So the grid is actually:

```
11 21 31 41 51
12 22 32 42 52
13 23 33 43 53
14 24 34 44 54
15 25 35 45 55 (Goal)
```

And the initial state is:
- Player is at pos21 (first row, second column)
- Stone is at pos22 (second row, second column)

That also doesn't make sense because many of the actions talk about moving from pos22 to pos21 in the direction dirup. I need to carefully infer the direction reference system from the problem statement.

Let's reexamine the problem statement more carefully. The "world" is described as a 2D square grid, and locations are named posXY where X and Y are presumably the position indices.

The actions include:
- move player from l_from to l_to following direction d
- pushtogoal player stone player_location stone_from stone_to direction
- pushtonongoal player stone player_location stone_from stone_to direction

And allowed directions are dirdown, dirleft, dirright, and dirup.

The original world state says, among other things:
"player1 is at location pos21"
"stone1 is at location pos22"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

This helps! These directional references allow us to solve for the orientation of the grid. 

If I can move from pos11 to pos21 following dirright, and from pos11 to pos12 following dirdown, then pos11 is the upper-left corner, pos21 is to the right of pos11, and pos12 is below pos11.

So the grid is indeed:
```
11 21 31 41 51
12 22 32 42 52
13 23 33 43 53
14 24 34 44 54
15 25 35 45 55
```

And the goal location is pos15, which is the bottom-left corner. The initial state has the player at pos21 and the stone at pos22.

Now that I understand the grid layout, let me plan again. I need to get the stone to pos15, the goal location, while satisfying all constraints.

Let's create a valid plan:

Starting state: Player at pos21, Stone at pos22

1. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright - Player at pos31, Stone at pos22 (pos31 is not clear, constraint 9 satisfied)
2. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown - Player at pos32, Stone at pos22
3. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown - Player at pos33, Stone at pos22 (player is at pos33, part of constraint 3 satisfied)
4. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft - Player at pos23, Stone at pos22
5. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft - Player at pos13, Stone at pos22 (pos13 is not clear, constraint 1 satisfied)
6. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup - Player at pos12, Stone at pos22 (player is at pos12, part of constraint 15 satisfied)
7. move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright - Player at pos22, Stone at pos22 (this seems odd, but the player is just moving to the same location as the stone, which should be valid according to the problem statement)

Wait, that doesn't make sense. The player can't move to a location that has a stone. Let me reexamine the problem statement again.

ok, the "move" action has the precondition that "location l_to is clear", which means there's no stone or agent there. So my previous plan won't work.

Let me try again:

Starting state: Player at pos21, Stone at pos22

1. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft - Player at pos11, Stone at pos22
2. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown - Player at pos12, Stone at pos22 (player is at pos12, part of constraint 15 satisfied)
3. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown - Player at pos13, Stone at pos22 (pos13 is not clear, constraint 1 satisfied)
4. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright - Player at pos23, Stone at pos22
5. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright - Player at pos33, Stone at pos22 (player is at pos33, part of constraint 3 satisfied)
6. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright - Player at pos43, Stone at pos22
7. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright - Player at pos53, Stone at pos22
8. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown - Player at pos54, Stone at pos22
9. move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown - Player at pos55, Stone at pos22
10. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft - Player at pos45, Stone at pos22
11. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft - Player at pos35, Stone at pos22 (pos35 is not clear, part of constraint 13 satisfied)
12. move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft - Player at pos25, Stone at pos22
13. move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft - Player at pos15, Stone at pos22
14. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup - Player at pos14, Stone at pos22
15. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright - Player at pos24, Stone at pos22 (player is at pos24, constraint 4 satisfied)
16. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright - Player at pos34, Stone at pos22
17. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright - Player at pos44, Stone at pos22
18. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup - Player at pos43, Stone at pos22
19. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup - Player at pos42, Stone at pos22
20. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup - Player at pos41, Stone at pos22
21. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright - Player at pos51, Stone at pos22 (player is at pos51, part of constraint 5 satisfied)
22. move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft - Player at pos41, Stone at pos22
23. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft - Player at pos31, Stone at pos22 (pos31 is not clear, constraint 9 satisfied)
24. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft - Player at pos21, Stone at pos22
25. move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown - Player at pos22, Stone at pos22 This is impossible. I can't move to a location that has a stone.

this approach isn't working. Let me start again with a clearer approach. We need to carefully consider how to push the stone.

OK I think I was making a mistake. Location posXY refers to a location at row X, column Y, so the grid is:

```
11 12 13 14 15
21 22 23 24 25
31 32 33 34 35
41 42 43 44 45
51 52 53 54 55
```

The goal is at pos15 (top-right corner), and the initial state has the player at pos21 (second row, first column) and the stone at pos22 (second row, second column).

So let me create a valid plan:

Starting state: Player at pos21, Stone at pos22

1. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirup - Player at pos11, Stone at pos22
2. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirright - Player at pos12, Stone at pos22 (player is at pos12, part of constraint 15 satisfied)
3. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirright - Player at pos13, Stone at pos22 (pos13 is not clear, constraint 1 satisfied)
4. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirdown - Player at pos23, Stone at pos22
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos21 dirleft - Player at pos22, Stone at pos21 
   (I'm pushing the stone from pos22 to pos21, the player is at pos23, which is to the right of pos22, and I push the stone to the left, 
   which is non-goal pos21)
6. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirright - Player at pos23, Stone at pos21
7. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirdown - Player at pos33, Stone at pos21 (player is at pos33, part of constraint 3 satisfied)
8. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown - Player at pos43, Stone at pos21
9. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirdown - Player at pos53, Stone at pos21
10. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirright - Player at pos54, Stone at pos21 (pos54 is not clear, part of constraint 12 satisfied)
11. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirup - Player at pos44, Stone at pos21
12. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirup - Player at pos34, Stone at pos21 
   This violates constraint 10 (pos34 must always remain clear). So this plan won't work.

Let me try again:

Starting state: Player at pos21, Stone at pos22

1. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirup - Player at pos11, Stone at pos22
2. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirright - Player at pos12, Stone at pos22 (player is at pos12, part of constraint 15 satisfied)
3. move player1 pos12 pos22 dirdown - Player at pos22, Stone at pos22
   This is not valid because pos22 is not clear (it has a stone). I keep making this mistake.

Let me try again. I think the issue is that I need to clarify how the push actions work. Let's look at the push actions again:

- pushtogoal player stone player_location stone_from stone_to direction: The player, at player_location, pushes the stone from stone_from to stone_to (a goal location) following direction.
- pushtonongoal player stone player_location stone_from stone_to direction: The player, at player_location, pushes the stone from stone_from to stone_to (a non-goal location) following direction.

For both actions, the player must be adjacent to the stone (player_location must be adjacent to stone_from), and the space behind the stone (stone_to) must be clear.

The pushtonongoal preconditions include "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d". This means that the player's position and the stone's position must be aligned in the direction of the push.

So if the player is pushing the stone from the left to the right, the player must be to the left of the stone.

Let me try again with this understanding:

Starting state: Player at pos21, Stone at pos22

1. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright - Player at pos31, Stone at pos22 (pos31 is not clear, constraint 9 satisfied)
2. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirright - Player at pos32, Stone at pos22
3. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirright - Player at pos33, Stone at pos22 (player is at pos33, part of constraint 3 satisfied)
4. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown - Player at pos43, Stone at pos22
5. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirdown - Player at pos53, Stone at pos22
6. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirleft - Player at pos52, Stone at pos22
7. move player1 pos52 pos51 dirleft - Player at pos51, Stone at pos22 (player is at pos51, part of constraint 5 satisfied)
8. move player1 pos51 pos41 dirup - Player at pos41, Stone at pos22
9. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirup - Player at pos31, Stone at pos22 (pos31 is not clear, constraint 9 satisfied)
10. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirup - Player at pos21, Stone at pos22
11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirright - Player at pos22, Stone at pos23 (stone is at pos23, constraint 11 satisfied)
12. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirdown - Player at pos32, Stone at pos23
13. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirright - Player at pos33, Stone at pos23
14. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirright - Player at pos34, Stone at pos23
    This violates constraint 10 (pos34 must always remain clear). So this plan won't work.

OK let's try again. I haven't been paying enough attention to constraints. Let me think through them more carefully.

Constraint 10 says pos34 must always remain clear. This means neither the player nor the stone can ever be at pos34.

Starting state: Player at pos21, Stone at pos22. The initial goal is to have the stone at pos15, the goal location.

1. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright - Player at pos31, Stone at pos22 (pos31 is not clear, constraint 9 satisfied)
2. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirdown - Player at pos41, Stone at pos22
3. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirdown - Player at pos51, Stone at pos22 (player is at pos51, part of constraint 5 satisfied)
4. move player1 pos51 pos41 dirup - Player at pos41, Stone at pos22
5. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirup - Player at pos31, Stone at pos22 (pos31 is not clear, constraint 9 satisfied)
6. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirup - Player at pos21, Stone at pos22
7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirright - Player at pos22, Stone at pos23 (stone is at pos23, constraint 11 satisfied)
8. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirup - Player at pos12, Stone at pos23 (player is at pos12, part of constraint 15 satisfied)
9. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirright - Player at pos13, Stone at pos23 (pos13 is not clear, constraint 1 satisfied)
10. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirdown - Player at pos23, Stone at pos23
    This is not valid because pos23 is not clear (it has a stone).

I keep making the same mistake and trying to move the player to the stone's location, which is not allowed. 

Ok, let's approach this differently. I know the main goal is to have the stone at pos15. But before I can directly push the stone to the goal, I need to get it close to the goal. So I need to push the stone from pos22 to pos23, then to pos24, etc., towards pos15.

Let me try to construct a valid plan:

Starting state: Player at pos21, Stone at pos22.

1. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright - Player at pos31, Stone at pos22 (pos31 is not clear, constraint 9 satisfied)
2. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirdown - Player at pos41, Stone at pos22
3. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirdown - Player at pos51, Stone at pos22 (player is at pos51, part of constraint 5 satisfied)
4. move player1 pos51 pos41 dirup - Player at pos41, Stone at pos22
5. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirup - Player at pos31, Stone at pos22 (pos31 is not clear, constraint 9 satisfied)
6. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirup - Player at pos21, Stone at pos22
7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirright - Player at pos22, Stone at pos23 (stone is at pos23, constraint 11 satisfied)
8. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirdown - Player at pos32, Stone at pos23
9. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirright - Player at pos33, Stone at pos23
10. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown - Player at pos43, Stone at pos23
11. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirdown - Player at pos53, Stone at pos23
12. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirright - Player at pos54, Stone at pos23 (pos54 is not clear, part of constraint 12 satisfied)
13. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirleft - Player at pos53, Stone at pos23
14. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirup - Player at pos43, Stone at pos23
15. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirup - Player at pos33, Stone at pos23
16. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirup - Player at pos23, Stone at pos23
    This is not valid because pos23 is not clear (it has a stone).

Let me try a different approach:

1. move player1 pos21 pos21 dirright - Player at pos21, Stone at pos22 (This doesn't change the state, so I'll skip it)
1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirright - Player at pos22, Stone at pos23 (stone is at pos23, constraint 11 satisfied)
2. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirdown - Player at pos32, Stone at pos23
3. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirright - Player at pos33, Stone at pos23
4. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown - Player at pos43, Stone at pos23
5. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirdown - Player at pos53, Stone at pos23
6. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirright - Player at pos54, Stone at pos23 (pos54 is not clear, part of constraint 12 satisfied)
7. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirup - Player at pos44, Stone at pos23
8. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft - Player at pos43, Stone at pos23
9. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirup - Player at pos33, Stone at pos23 (player is at pos33, part of constraint 3 satisfied)
10. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirleft - Player at pos32, Stone at pos23
11. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup - Player at pos22, Stone at pos23
12. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirup - Player at pos12, Stone at pos23 (player is at pos12, part of constraint 15 satisfied)
13. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirright - Player at pos13, Stone at pos23 (pos13 is not clear, constraint 1 satisfied)
14. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirright - Player at pos14, Stone at pos23
15. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirdown - Player at pos24, Stone at pos23 (player is at pos24, constraint 4 satisfied)
16. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos25 dirright - Player at pos23, Stone at pos25 (pos24 is not clear, constraint 2 satisfied; stone is at pos25, constraint 14 satisfied)
17. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirup - Player at pos13, Stone at pos25
18. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirright - Player at pos14, Stone at pos25
19. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirright - Player at pos15, Stone at pos25
20. move player1 pos15 pos25 dirdown - Player at pos25, Stone at pos25
    This is not valid because pos25 is not clear (it has a stone).

Ok, I need to rethink this approach.

1. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirup - Player at pos11, Stone at pos22
2. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirright - Player at pos12, Stone at pos22 (player is at pos12, part of constraint 15 satisfied)
3. move player1 pos12 pos22 dirdown - Player at pos22, Stone at pos22
   This is not valid because pos22 is not clear.

Let me approach this differently. Let me first fully understand the push actions. If the player1 is at pos21 and stone1 is at pos22, then the action:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirright

means the player pushes the stone from pos22 to pos23, and the player ends up at pos22. This is because the player moves (i.e., pushes) the stone in the direction dirright, which means the stone moves from pos22 to pos23, and the player moves from pos21 to pos22.

Similarly, pushtogoal is the same, but the destination (pos23 in this case) must be a goal location.

For both actions, the player must be adjacent to the stone, and the space behind the stone must be clear.

With this understanding, let me create a valid plan:

Starting state: Player at pos21, Stone at pos22

1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirright - Player at pos22, Stone at pos23 (stone is at pos23, constraint 11 satisfied)
2. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirright - Player at pos23, Stone at pos24 (pos24 is not clear, constraint 2 satisfied)
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirright - Player at pos24, Stone at pos25 (player is at pos24, constraint 4 satisfied; stone is at pos25, constraint 14 satisfied)
4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos25 pos35 dirdown - Player at pos25, Stone at pos35 (pos35 is not clear, part of constraint 13 satisfied)
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos35 pos45 dirdown - Player at pos35, Stone at pos45
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos55 dirdown - Player at pos45, Stone at pos55
7. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirleft - Player at pos44, Stone at pos55
8. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft - Player at pos43, Stone at pos55
9. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft - Player at pos42, Stone at pos55
10. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirleft - Player at pos41, Stone at pos55
11. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirup - Player at pos31, Stone at pos55 (pos31 is not clear, constraint 9 satisfied)
12. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirright - Player at pos32, Stone at pos55
13. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirright - Player at pos33, Stone at pos55 (player is at pos33, part of constraint 3 satisfied)
14. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirup - Player at pos23, Stone at pos55
15. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirup - Player at pos13, Stone at pos55 (pos13 is not clear, constraint 1 satisfied)
16. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirright - Player at pos14, Stone at pos55
17. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirright - Player at pos15, Stone at pos55
18. move player1 pos15 pos25 dirdown - Player at pos25, Stone at pos55
19. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirdown - Player at pos35, Stone at pos55 (pos35 is not clear, part of constraint 13 satisfied)
20. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirdown - Player at pos45, Stone at pos55
21. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirdown - Player at pos55, Stone at pos55
    This is not valid because pos55 is not clear. I keep making this mistake.

Let me try an alternative approach, pushing the stone towards the goal more directly:

Starting state: Player at pos21, Stone at pos22

1. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright - Player at pos31, Stone at pos22 (pos31 is not clear, constraint 9 satisfied)
2. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirdown - Player at pos41, Stone at pos22
3. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirdown - Player at pos51, Stone at pos22 (player is at pos51, part of constraint 5 satisfied)
4. move player1 pos51 pos41 dirup - Player at pos41, Stone at pos22
5. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirup - Player at pos31, Stone at pos22 (pos31 is not clear, constraint 9 satisfied)
6. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirup - Player at pos21, Stone at pos22
7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirright - Player at pos22, Stone at pos23 (stone is at pos23, constraint 11 satisfied)
8. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirdown - Player at pos32, Stone at pos23
9. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirright - Player at pos33, Stone at pos23 (player is at pos33, part of constraint 3 satisfied)
10. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown - Player at pos43, Stone at pos23
11. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirdown - Player at pos53, Stone at pos23
12. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirright - Player at pos54, Stone at pos23 (pos54 is not clear, part of constraint 12 satisfied)
13. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirleft - Player at pos53, Stone at pos23
14. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirup - Player at pos43, Stone at pos23
15. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirup - Player at pos33, Stone at pos23
16. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirup - Player at pos23, Stone at pos23
    This is not valid because pos23 is not clear.

Let me try a different approach. Let me push the stone up then right:

Starting state: Player at pos21, Stone at pos22

1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos12 dirup - Player at pos22, Stone at pos12 (player is at pos12, part of constraint 15 satisfied)
2. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirright - Player at pos23, Stone at pos12
3. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirup - Player at pos13, Stone at pos12 (pos13 is not clear, constraint 1 satisfied)
4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirleft - Player at pos12, Stone at pos11
5. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirright - Player at pos13, Stone at pos11
6. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirright - Player at pos14, Stone at pos11
7. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirright - Player at pos15, Stone at pos11
8. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirleft - Player at pos14, Stone at pos11
9. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirleft - Player at pos13, Stone at pos11
10. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirleft - Player at pos12, Stone at pos11
11. move player1 pos12 pos11 dirleft - Player at pos11, Stone at pos11
   This is not valid because pos11 is not clear.

Let me try another approach. The goal is to get the stone to pos15. Let's try to move it there directly, making sure to satisfy all constraints.

Starting state: Player at pos21, Stone at pos22

1. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirup - Player at pos11, Stone at pos22
2. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirright - Player at pos12, Stone at pos22 (player is at pos12, part of constraint 15 satisfied)
3. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirright - Player at pos13, Stone at pos22 (pos13 is not clear, constraint 1 satisfied)
4. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirdown - Player at pos23, Stone at pos22
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos21 dirleft - Player at pos22, Stone at pos21
6. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirright - Player at pos23, Stone at pos21
7. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirdown - Player at pos33, Stone at pos21 (player is at pos33, part of constraint 3 satisfied)
8. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirleft - Player at pos32, Stone at pos21
9. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft - Player at pos31, Stone at pos21 (pos31 is not clear, constraint 9 satisfied)
10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos11 dirup - Player at pos21, Stone at pos11
11. move player1 pos21 pos22 dirright - Player at pos22, Stone at pos11
12. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirright - Player at pos23, Stone at pos11
13. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirright - Player at pos24, Stone at pos11 (player is at pos24, constraint 4 satisfied; pos24 is not clear, constraint 2 satisfied)
14. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirup - Player at pos14, Stone at pos11
15. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos11 pos12 dirdown - Player at pos11, Stone at pos12
16. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown - Player at pos12, Stone at pos13
17. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirdown - Player at pos13, Stone at pos14
18. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown - Player at pos14, Stone at pos15 (stone is at the goal, pos15 is not clear, constraint 6 satisfied)
19. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirdown - Player at pos24, Stone at pos15
20. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirdown - Player at pos34, Stone at pos15
    This violates constraint 10 (pos34 must always remain clear). So this plan won't work.

This is quite complex with all the constraints. Let me approach it more systematically.

Constraint 10 says pos34 must always remain clear. This means neither the player nor the stone can ever be at pos34.

Starting state: Player at pos21, Stone at pos22

1. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirup - Player at pos11, Stone at pos22
2. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirright - Player at pos12, Stone at pos22 (player is at pos12, part of constraint 15 satisfied)
3. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirright - Player at pos13, Stone at pos22 (pos13 is not clear, constraint 1 satisfied)
4. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirdown - Player at pos23, Stone at pos22
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos32 dirdown - Player at pos22, Stone at pos32
6. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirright - Player at pos23, Stone at pos32
7. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirdown - Player at pos33, Stone at pos32 (player is at pos33, part of constraint 3 satisfied)
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirleft - Player at pos32, Stone at pos31 (pos31 is not clear, constraint 9 satisfied)
9. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirright - Player at pos33, Stone at pos31
10. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown - Player at pos43, Stone at pos31
11. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirdown - Player at pos53, Stone at pos31
12. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirright - Player at pos54, Stone at pos31 (pos54 is not clear, part of constraint 12 satisfied)
13. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirup - Player at pos44, Stone at pos31
14. move player1 pos44 pos24 dirup - Player at pos24, Stone at pos31 (player is at pos24, constraint 4 satisfied; pos24 is not clear, constraint 2 satisfied)
15. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirup - Player at pos14, Stone at pos31
16. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirright - Player at pos15, Stone at pos31
17. move player1 pos15 pos25 dirdown - Player at pos25, Stone at pos31
18. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirdown - Player at pos35, Stone at pos31 (pos35 is not clear, part of constraint 13 satisfied)
19. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirdown - Player at pos45, Stone at pos31
20. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirdown - Player at pos55, Stone at pos31
21. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirleft - Player at pos54, Stone at pos31
22. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirleft - Player at pos53, Stone at pos31
23. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirup - Player at pos43, Stone at pos31
24. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirup - Player at pos33, Stone at pos31
25. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirup - Player at pos23, Stone at pos31
26. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirup - Player at pos13, Stone at pos31
27. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirright - Player at pos14, Stone at pos31
28. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirdown - Player at pos24, Stone at pos31
29. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirleft - Player at pos23, Stone at pos31
30. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirleft - Player at pos22, Stone at pos31
31. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft - Player at pos21, Stone at pos31 (player is at pos21, part of constraint 7 satisfied)
32. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos31 pos41 dirdown - Player at pos31, Stone at pos41
33. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirright - Player at pos32, Stone at pos41
34. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirright - Player at pos33, Stone at pos41
35. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirup - Player at pos23, Stone at pos41
36. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirright - Player at pos24, Stone at pos41
37. move player1 pos24 pos25 dirright - Player at pos25, Stone at pos41
38. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirdown - Player at pos35, Stone at pos41
39. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirdown - Player at pos45, Stone at pos41
40. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos41 pos42 dirright - Player at pos41, Stone at pos42
41. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos43 dirright - Player at pos42, Stone at pos43
42. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirright - Player at pos43, Stone at pos44
43. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirright - Player at pos44, Stone at pos45 (player is at pos44, part of constraint 7 satisfied)
44. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirup - Player at pos34, Stone at pos45
    This violates constraint 10 (pos34 must always remain clear). So this plan won't work.

Let me try again. The challenge is finding a path that satisfies all constraints.

Starting state: Player at pos21, Stone at pos22

1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirright - Player at pos22, Stone at pos23 (stone is at pos23, constraint 11 satisfied)
2. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirdown - Player at pos32, Stone at pos23
3. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirright - Player at pos33, Stone at pos23 (player is at pos33, part of constraint 3 satisfied)
4. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown - Player at pos43, Stone at pos23
5. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirdown - Player at pos53, Stone at pos23
6. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirright - Player at pos54, Stone at pos23 (pos54 is not clear, part of constraint 12 satisfied)
7. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirup - Player at pos44, Stone at pos23
8. move player1 pos44 pos24 dirup - Player at pos24, Stone at pos23 (player is at pos24, constraint 4 satisfied; pos24 is not clear, constraint 2 satisfied)
9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirup - Player at pos23, Stone at pos13 (pos13 is not clear, constraint 1 satisfied)
10. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirright - Player at pos24, Stone at pos13
11. move player1 pos24 pos25 dirright - Player at pos25, Stone at pos13 (stone is at pos25, constraint 14 satisfied)
    No, this is a mistake. The stone is at pos13, not pos25. 

I think the issue is that the constraints are contradictory and can't all be satisfied simultaneously.

Let me revisit the constraints and see if there's a way to satisfy all of them:

1. ✅ Position pos13 must not be clear at some point
2. ✅ Position pos24 must not be clear at some point
3. ✅ Before pos24 becomes not clear, player must be at pos33
4. ✅ Player must be at pos24 at some point
5. ✅ Before player is at pos24, player must be at pos51
6. ✅ Position pos15 (the goal) must not be clear at some point
7. ✅ After pos15 becomes not clear, player must be at pos21 or pos44
8. ✅ Position pos24 must only be occupied in one continuous sequence
9. ✅ Position pos31 must not be clear at some point
10. ✅ Position pos34 must always remain clear
11. ✅ Stone must be at pos23 at some point
12. ✅ After stone is at pos23, pos54 must not be clear
13. ✅ Position pos35 must only be occupied in one continuous sequence
14. ✅ Stone must be at pos25 at some point
15. ✅ Before stone is at pos25, either player must be at pos12 or pos33 must not be clear

We have constraints that pos12, pos13, pos31, and pos33 must not be clear at some point, but pos34 must always remain clear. And various constraints on the order of actions.

Let me sketch a solution:

1. First, get the player to pos12 to satisfy part of constraint 15
2. Then get the player to pos13 to satisfy constraint 1
3. Then get the player to pos33 to satisfy part of constraint 3
4. Then get the player to pos31 to satisfy constraint 9
5. Then get the player to pos51 to satisfy part of constraint 5
6. Then move the stone to pos23 to satisfy constraint 11
7. Then get the player to pos54 to satisfy constraint 12
8. Then get the player to pos24 to satisfy constraint 4 and part of constraint 8
9. Then move the stone to pos25 to satisfy constraint 14
10. Finally, move the stone to pos15 (the goal) to satisfy constraint 6
11. After that, get the player to pos21 or pos44 to satisfy constraint 7

Let me try to implement this plan:

Starting state: Player at pos21, Stone at pos22

1. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirup - Player at pos11, Stone at pos22
2. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirright - Player at pos12, Stone at pos22 (player is at pos12, part of constraint 15 satisfied)
3. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirright - Player at pos13, Stone at pos22 (pos13 is not clear, constraint 1 satisfied)
4. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirdown - Player at pos23, Stone at pos22
5. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirdown - Player at pos33, Stone at pos22 (player is at pos33, part of constraint 3 satisfied)
6. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirleft - Player at pos32, Stone at pos22
7. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft - Player at pos31, Stone at pos22 (pos31 is not clear, constraint 9 satisfied)
8. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirdown - Player at pos41, Stone at pos22
9. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirdown - Player at pos51, Stone at pos22 (player is at pos51, part of constraint 5 satisfied)
10. move player1 pos51 pos41 dirup - Player at pos41, Stone at pos22
11. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirup - Player at pos31, Stone at pos22
12. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirup - Player at pos21, Stone at pos22
13. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirright - Player at pos22, Stone at pos23 (stone is at pos23, constraint 11 satisfied)
14. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirdown - Player at pos32, Stone at pos23
15. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirright - Player at pos33, Stone at pos23
16. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown - Player at pos43, Stone at pos23
17. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirdown - Player at pos53, Stone at pos23
18. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirright - Player at pos54, Stone at pos23 (pos54 is not clear, part of constraint 12 satisfied)
19. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirleft - Player at pos53, Stone at pos23
20. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirup - Player at pos43, Stone at pos23
21. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirup - Player at pos33, Stone at pos23
22. move player1 pos33 pos24 dirright - Player at pos24, Stone at pos23 (player is at pos24, constraint 4 satisfied; pos24 is not clear, constraint 2 satisfied)
23. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirleft - Player at pos23, Stone at pos22
24. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirdown - Player at pos33, Stone at pos22
25. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown - Player at pos43, Stone at pos22
26. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirright - Player at pos44, Stone at pos22
27. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirright - Player at pos45, Stone at pos22
28. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirup - Player at pos35, Stone at pos22 (pos35 is not clear, part of constraint 13 satisfied)
29. move player1 pos35 pos25 dirup - Player at pos25, Stone at pos22
30. move player1 pos25 pos24 dirleft - Player at pos24, Stone at pos22
31. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos22 pos23 dirright - Player at pos22, Stone at pos23
32. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirright - Player at pos23, Stone at pos24
33. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirright - Player at pos24, Stone at pos25 (stone is at pos25, constraint 14 satisfied)
34. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos25 pos15 dirup - Player at pos25, Stone at pos15 (stone is at the goal, pos15 is not clear, constraint 6 satisfied)
35. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirdown - Player at pos35, Stone at pos15
36. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirdown - Player at pos45, Stone at pos15
37. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirleft - Player at pos44, Stone at pos15 (player is at pos44, part of constraint 7 satisfied)

I think this plan satisfies all constraints! Let me verify:

1. ✅ Position pos13 must not be clear at some point - Player is at pos13 at step 3
2. ✅ Position pos24 must not be clear at some point - Player is at pos24 at steps 22-23 and 30-31, and stone is at pos24 at steps 32-33
3. ✅ Before pos24 becomes not clear, player must be at pos33 - Player is at pos33 at steps 5-6 and 21-22, and pos24 becomes not clear at step 22
4. ✅ Player must be at pos24 at some point - Player is at pos24 at steps 22-23 and 30-31
5. ✅ Before player is at pos24, player must be at pos51 - Player is at pos51 at steps 9-10, and at pos24 at step 22-23
6. ✅ Position pos15 must not be clear at some point - Stone is at pos15 (the goal) at steps 34-37
7. ✅ After pos15 is not clear, player must be at pos21 or pos44 - Player moves to pos44 at step 37 after stone is at pos15
8. ✅ Position pos24 must only be occupied in one continuous sequence - pos24 is occupied at steps 22-23, then becomes clear, then is occupied again at steps 30-33, which violates the constraint
   Wait, "one continuous sequence" means it can only be occupied once in a continuous manner. So this plan doesn't work.

Let me try again with a plan that ensures pos24 is only occupied in one continuous sequence:

Starting state: Player at pos21, Stone at pos22

1. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirup - Player at pos11, Stone at pos22
2. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirright - Player at pos12, Stone at pos22 (player is at pos12, part of constraint 15 satisfied)
3. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirright - Player at pos13, Stone at pos22 (pos13 is not clear, constraint 1 satisfied)
4. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirdown - Player at pos23, Stone at pos22
5. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirdown - Player at pos33, Stone at pos22 (player is at pos33, part of constraint 3 satisfied)
6. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirleft - Player at pos32, Stone at pos22
7. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft - Player at pos31, Stone at pos22 (pos31 is not clear, constraint 9 satisfied)
8. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirdown - Player at pos41, Stone at pos22
9. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirdown - Player at pos51, Stone at pos22 (player is at pos51, part of constraint 5 satisfied)
10. move player1 pos51 pos41 dirup - Player at pos41, Stone at pos22
11. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirup - Player at pos31, Stone at pos22
12. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirup - Player at pos21, Stone at pos22
13. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirright - Player at pos22, Stone at pos23 (stone is at pos23, constraint 11 satisfied)
14. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirdown - Player at pos32, Stone at pos23
15. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirright - Player at pos33, Stone at pos23
16. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown - Player at pos43, Stone at pos23
17. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirdown - Player at pos53, Stone at pos23
18. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirright - Player at pos54, Stone at pos23 (pos54 is not clear, part of constraint 12 satisfied)
19. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirup - Player at pos44, Stone at pos23
20. move player1 pos44 pos24 dirup - Player at pos24, Stone at pos23 (player is at pos24, constraint 4 satisfied; pos24 is not clear, constraint 2 satisfied)
21. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirleft - Player at pos23, Stone at pos22
22. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirdown - Player at pos33, Stone at pos22
23. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown - Player at pos43, Stone at pos22
24. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirright - Player at pos44, Stone at pos22
25. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirright - Player at pos45, Stone at pos22
26. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirup - Player at pos35, Stone at pos22 (pos35 is not clear, part of constraint 13 satisfied)
27. move player1 pos35 pos25 dirup - Player at pos25, Stone at pos22

Now I need to move the stone to pos25 without occupying pos24 again. Let me try a different path:

28. move player1 pos25 pos15 dirup - Player at pos15, Stone at pos22
29. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirleft - Player at pos14, Stone at pos22
30. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirleft - Player at pos13, Stone at pos22
31. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirleft - Player at pos12, Stone at pos22
32. move player1 pos12 pos11 dirleft - Player at pos11, Stone at pos22
33. move player1 pos11 pos21 dirdown - Player at pos21, Stone at pos22 (player is at pos21, part of constraint 7 satisfied)
34. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirright - Player at pos22, Stone at pos23
35. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos33 dirdown - Player at pos23, Stone at pos33
36. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirdown - Player at pos33, Stone at pos43
37. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirdown - Player at pos43, Stone at pos53
38. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos53 pos54 dirright - Player at pos53, Stone at pos54
39. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirright - Player at pos54, Stone at pos55
40. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirup - Player at pos44, Stone at pos55 (player is at pos44, part of constraint 7 satisfied)
41. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirup - Player at pos34, Stone at pos55
    This violates constraint 10 (pos34 must always remain clear). So this plan won't work.

OK, so constraints 8 and 10 together make this particularly challenging: I can't use pos34 at all and can't use pos24 more than once. Let me think about how to plan around these.

One thought: Start with the player at pos21 and the stone at pos22. Can I then move the stone from pos22 to pos25 without ever using pos24? If I could, then I could use pos24 only to move the stone from pos25 to pos15, which would satisfy constraint 8.

Let's try:

Starting state: Player at pos21, Stone at pos22

1. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirup - Player at pos11, Stone at pos22
2. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirright - Player at pos12, Stone at pos22 (player is at pos12, part of constraint 15 satisfied)
3. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirright - Player at pos13, Stone at pos22 (pos13 is not clear, constraint 1 satisfied)
4. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirdown - Player at pos23, Stone at pos22
5. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirdown - Player at pos33, Stone at pos22 (player is at pos33, part of constraint 3 satisfied)
6. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirleft - Player at pos32, Stone at pos22
7. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft - Player at pos31, Stone at pos22 (pos31 is not clear, constraint 9 satisfied)
8. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirdown - Player at pos41, Stone at pos22
9. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirdown - Player at pos51, Stone at pos22 (player is at pos51, part of constraint 5 satisfied)
10. move player1 pos51 pos41 dirup - Player at pos41, Stone at pos22
11. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirup - Player at pos31, Stone at pos22
12. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirup - Player at pos21, Stone at pos22
13. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirright - Player at pos22, Stone at pos23 (stone is at pos23, constraint 11 satisfied)

At this point, I'm trying to get the stone to pos25 without using pos24. I think I'll need to push it down then right.

14. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirdown - Player at pos32, Stone at pos23
15. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirright - Player at pos33, Stone at pos23
16. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown - Player at pos43, Stone at pos23
17. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirdown - Player at pos53, Stone at pos23
18. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirright - Player at pos54, Stone at pos23 (pos54 is not clear, part of constraint 12 satisfied)
19. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirup - Player at pos44, Stone at pos23
20. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft - Player at pos43, Stone at pos23
21. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirup - Player at pos33, Stone at pos23
22. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup - Player at pos23, Stone at pos13
23. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirdown - Player at pos33, Stone at pos13
24. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirleft - Player at pos32, Stone at pos13
25. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft - Player at pos31, Stone at pos13
26. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirdown - Player at pos41, Stone at pos13
27. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirdown - Player at pos51, Stone at pos13
28. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirright - Player at pos52, Stone at pos13
29. move player1 pos52 pos53 dirright - Player at pos53, Stone at pos13
30. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirup - Player at pos43, Stone at pos13
31. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirup - Player at pos33, Stone at pos13
32. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirup - Player at pos23, Stone at pos13
33. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirup - Player at pos13, Stone at pos13
   This is not valid because pos13 is not clear.

OK, so I can't get the stone to pos25 without using pos24. Let's try a different approach. 

Wait, maybe for constraint 8, "Position pos24 must only be occupied in one continuous sequence", the term "continuous sequence" means that the location is occupied, then clear, then occupied again. If the location remains continuously occupied (e.g., first by the player, then by the stone), that might count as a single continuous sequence.

If that's the case, then my earlier plan might work:

Starting state: Player at pos21, Stone at pos22

1. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirup - Player at pos11, Stone at pos22
2. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirright - Player at pos12, Stone at pos22 (player is at pos12, part of constraint 15 satisfied)
3. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirright - Player at pos13, Stone at pos22 (pos13 is not clear, constraint 1 satisfied)
