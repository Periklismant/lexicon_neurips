Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. First, I need to understand the initial state and the goal. The goal is to have stone1 at a goal location. The only goal location mentioned is pos15. So, the final position of stone1 must be pos15. But there are a lot of constraints to satisfy along the way.

Let me list out the constraints:

1. At least one state where pos13 is not clear.
2. At least one state where pos24 is not clear.
3. If pos24 is not clear in some state, then earlier the player was at pos33.
4. At least one state where player1 is at pos24.
5. If player1 is at pos24, then earlier they were at pos51.
6. At least one state where pos15 is not clear (which will be when stone1 is there, I guess).
7. If pos15 is not clear in state s, then either player1 is at pos21 or pos44 in s or later.
8. pos24 not clear can only be in one continuous sequence.
9. At least one state where pos31 is not clear.
10. pos34 must always be clear.
11. At least one state where stone1 is at pos23.
12. If stone1 is at pos23, then pos54 must not be clear at or after that state.
13. pos35 not clear can only be in one continuous sequence.
14. At least one state where stone1 is at pos25.
15. If stone1 is at pos25, then earlier either player1 was at pos12 or pos33 was not clear.

Hmm, that's a lot. Let me start by figuring out how to get stone1 from pos22 to pos15. The initial position of the agent is pos21, and stone1 is at pos22. 

First, the agent can move to pos22 by moving down from pos21. But pos22 is where the stone is. Wait, but to push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent. Wait, the directions: for pushing, the agent must be in a position adjacent to the stone, and then push it in a direction. Let me check the movement possibilities.

Looking at the allowed moves from pos21: the agent can move to pos11 (left), pos31 (right), or pos22 (down). Since the agent is at pos21, to push the stone at pos22, which is directly below, the agent can push the stone south (dirdown) if possible. Wait, but the directions for pushing: the agent is at l_p (current location), the stone is at l_from, and the agent pushes it to l_to. The direction d must allow moving from l_p to l_from (so agent is adjacent to the stone), and then from l_from to l_to (so the stone moves in direction d).

Wait, for example, if the agent is at pos21, and the stone is at pos22, the agent can push the stone down to pos23. But let me check the allowed directions. The movement from pos21 to pos22 is allowed via direction dirdown. So the agent is at pos21, stone is at pos22. To push the stone down to pos23, direction d would be dirdown. So the action would be pushtonongoal (since pos23 is not a goal). But pos23 is clear initially.

But wait, the initial state says pos23 is clear. So pushing stone1 from pos22 to pos23 using pushtonongoal. That would satisfy the constraint that stone1 is at pos23 at some state. Also, after that, we have to make sure that pos54 is not clear at some point after. But pos54 is initially clear, so maybe the agent has to go there later?

But first, let's outline possible steps:

1. Move agent from pos21 to pos22 (down). But pos22 is occupied by stone1. Wait, no. The initial state says "Location pos22 is clear". Wait, no: the initial state says "stone1 is at location pos22" and "Location pos22 is clear". Wait, that can't be. Wait, the initial state lists:

"player1 is at location pos21"

"stone1 is at location pos22"

"Location pos22 is clear"

Wait, how can pos22 be clear if stone1 is there? That's a contradiction. Wait, perhaps a mistake in the problem description. Let me check again.

Looking back at the original state:

The original state says:

"player1 is at location pos21"

"stone1 is at location pos22"

Then, under the clear locations:

"Location pos21 is clear" (so player is at pos21, but pos21 is clear? That's conflicting. Wait, perhaps the "clear" means that there's nothing (no stone or agent) in that location. But according to the problem statement, each position may contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. So if a stone or agent is present, the location is not clear.

Wait, the problem statement says: "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty. Each position is flagged as either a goal position or a non-goal position. Your task is to manipulate the agent in order to move all stones to goal positions."

So, if a location has the agent or a stone, it's not clear. The original state lists:

"Location pos21 is clear" → but the player is at pos21. That's conflicting. Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the problem's initial state. Wait, the original state says:

"player1 is at location pos21"

"stone1 is at location pos22"

Then, in the list of clear locations:

"Location pos21 is clear"

"Location pos22 is clear"

But that can't be right. Because if the agent is at pos21, then pos21 should not be clear. Similarly, stone1 is at pos22, so pos22 should not be clear. This must be an error. Wait, but according to the problem description, the user provided the original state, so perhaps there's a mistake here. But the user provided this, so maybe the initial state is such that even though the agent is at pos21, the location pos21 is considered clear. But that contradicts the problem's definition. Maybe the problem has a different way of defining "clear". Wait, let me check the action effects.

For the "move" action: moving from l_from to l_to makes l_from clear and l_to not clear. So, the initial state must have the agent's current location as not clear. But according to the given initial state, pos21 is clear. But the agent is there. So this is a problem. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the initial state. But since we have to work with the given data, perhaps the initial state is such that pos21 is considered clear despite the agent being there. But that's impossible. Alternatively, maybe the user messed up the clear statements. Let me check again.

Looking back:

Original state:

"player1 is at location pos21"

"stone1 is at location pos22"

Then, under the clear locations:

"Location pos11 is clear"

... (skipping some)

"Location pos21 is clear"

"Location pos22 is clear"

So according to the problem, even though the agent is at pos21, pos21 is clear. That's contradictory. But maybe the "clear" refers to only stones? No, the problem statement says a location is clear if it doesn't have the agent or a stone. So this must be an error. But since the problem is given as such, perhaps it's a typo. Maybe the initial state actually lists pos21 and pos22 as not clear. Wait, but the user wrote:

"Location pos21 is clear"

"Location pos22 is clear"

Which would be impossible if the agent and stone are there. So this must be a mistake. But since the problem is presented as such, perhaps it's a trick. Alternatively, maybe the user intended that the agent and stone are in those positions, but those locations are considered clear. But according to the domain's definition, a location is clear if it's empty. Therefore, the initial state as given is inconsistent. But perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the user made a typo and that pos21 and pos22 are not clear. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a different definition. Hmm.

This is a critical point. If the agent is at pos21, then pos21 should not be clear. But according to the initial state, pos21 is clear. So this is a problem. Wait, maybe in the problem, the "clear" refers to the absence of stones only. But the problem statement says each position may contain the agent, a stone, or be empty. So if a position has the agent, it's not clear. Therefore, the initial state as given has a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the initial state. But since we have to work with the given data, maybe we need to ignore that and proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the initial state is correct, and there's a misunderstanding. Let me check again.

The original state lists:

"player1 is at location pos21"

"stone1 is at location pos22"

"Location pos21 is clear"

"Location pos22 is clear"

So according to that, even though the agent is at pos21, the location is considered clear. That's impossible. Therefore, perhaps the user intended that the agent and stone are in those positions, but the clear statements are incorrect. Therefore, perhaps we should disregard the clear status of pos21 and pos22. But that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different logic where the agent's presence doesn't affect the clearness. But according to the actions' preconditions, moving requires that the destination is clear (i.e., no agent or stone there). So if pos21 is clear, but the agent is there, then the preconditions for move actions would allow moving into pos21, which is already occupied. That's impossible. Therefore, there's a contradiction in the problem's initial state. But since this is a hypothetical problem, perhaps we need to proceed under the assumption that pos21 and pos22 are not clear, despite what the initial state says. Alternatively, the user made a mistake, but we have to work with the given data. This is a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the "clear" in the initial state refers to the presence of stones only. So "clear" means no stones, regardless of the agent. But the problem says a location is clear if it's empty (no agent or stone). So that can't be. Therefore, this must be a mistake. Given that this is a critical point, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that pos21 and pos22 are not clear, as they contain the agent and the stone. Therefore, the initial state's "clear" list is incorrect. But the problem states that the original state includes "Location pos21 is clear" and "Location pos22 is clear", which is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a different definition of "clear". Alternatively, maybe the agent's location doesn't block the clearness. But that doesn't align with the action preconditions. For example, the move action requires that the destination is clear. If the agent is at pos21, then moving to pos22 (which has the stone) is impossible because pos22 is not clear. But according to the initial state, pos22 is clear. So maybe the stone's presence doesn't block movement. But that's not possible.

This is a significant confusion. Let me try to proceed. The stone is at pos22, and the initial state says pos22 is clear. So perhaps in this problem, "clear" refers to the absence of stones only, and the agent's presence doesn't affect it. That would make sense if the agent can move through their own position. But that's not standard. However, given the problem's initial state, I have to accept that in the initial state, pos21 (agent's location) and pos22 (stone's location) are considered clear, which is conflicting with standard definitions, but perhaps that's how it's set here.

But the move action's preconditions require that the destination is clear. So if the agent is at pos21 and pos21 is clear, then moving from pos21 to pos21 would be allowed, which doesn't make sense. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps "clear" in the problem's context means that there's no stone. So the agent can be in a clear location. That might make sense. So a location is clear if there's no stone. Then, the agent can be in a clear location. In that case, pos21 is clear (no stone) and the agent is there. Similarly, pos22 is clear (no stone) but the stone is there. Wait, that's still a contradiction. Because the stone is at pos22, which would make it not clear. So this is very confusing.

Given this ambiguity, perhaps I need to proceed with the given initial state, even if it's contradictory. Let's proceed under the assumption that the initial state is correct, even if it's conflicting. So the agent is at pos21, which is clear. The stone is at pos22, which is clear. So perhaps in this problem, stones and agents don't affect the clearness. But that would make the preconditions for move actions always possible, which isn't the case. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in listing the initial clear locations. For example, maybe pos21 and pos22 are not clear. Let's assume that. So the initial clear locations exclude pos21 and pos22. Then, the agent is at pos21 (not clear), stone at pos22 (not clear). Then, the move actions would require that the destination is clear. For example, the agent can move from pos21 to pos22 only if pos22 is clear. But if pos22 is occupied by the stone, then the agent can't move there. Therefore, the agent needs to push the stone.

But according to the problem's initial state, pos22 is clear. So the agent can move into pos22. But then, the stone is there. So perhaps the problem allows multiple entities in the same location. But that's not standard. This is very confusing. 

Given that I can't resolve this without clarification, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the initial state has a typo and that pos21 and pos22 are not clear. So the agent is at pos21 (so pos21 is not clear), and the stone is at pos22 (so pos22 is not clear). Then, the initial clear locations are all except pos21 and pos22. This would make the problem solvable.

Under that assumption, the agent starts at pos21, stone1 at pos22. The goal is to get stone1 to pos15, which is a goal location.

Constraints to satisfy:

1. At least one state where pos13 is not clear. So perhaps the agent moves a stone (but there's only one stone) to pos13. But since the stone is initially at pos22, we need to move it to pos13. But the goal is pos15. So this would require temporarily moving the stone to pos13, but that's counterproductive. Alternatively, maybe the agent can be at pos13, making it not clear. But the agent can't be there unless moved. Let's think.

But the problem's constraints include that pos34 must always be clear. So the agent can't be there. So, for pos13 to be not clear, either the agent or the stone must be there. The stone is the only other object besides the agent. So to make pos13 not clear, either:

- The stone is at pos13, or
- The agent is at pos13.

But the stone needs to reach pos15 eventually. So moving the stone to pos13 would require moving it there and then moving it again towards pos15. But that's extra steps. But maybe necessary to satisfy the constraint. Alternatively, the agent can go to pos13, making it not clear. But then, the agent would have to move there at some point.

So possible steps:

Move agent from pos21 to pos22 (down), but if pos22 is occupied by the stone, that's not possible. Wait, but according to the initial state, pos22 is clear. So if pos22 is clear, then the agent can move there. But the stone is at pos22. So this is conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the stone from pos22. Since the agent starts at pos21, to push the stone at pos22, the agent can be at pos22's north (pos21) and push it south (dirdown) to pos23. But to do that, the agent must be able to move to pos22, but if pos22 is clear (as per initial state), then the agent can move there. Wait, but the stone is already at pos22, so how can it be clear? This is the crux of the confusion.

Assuming that the initial state is correct despite the contradiction, then pos22 is clear, so the agent can move into pos22. But the stone is already there. That's impossible. Therefore, I must assume that the initial state has a typo and that pos22 is not clear. Therefore, the stone is at pos22, making it not clear. Then, the agent cannot move into pos22. Therefore, the agent needs to push the stone from pos22.

But how? To push the stone, the agent must be adjacent to it. The agent is at pos21. The stone is at pos22. pos21 is north of pos22. So the agent can push the stone south (dirdown) to pos23. But for that, the agent must be at pos22, or adjacent? Wait, the direction for pushing: the agent must be at l_p (current location), which must be adjacent to the stone's location l_from. Then, the direction d allows moving from l_p to l_from (i.e., agent is moving towards the stone). Then, pushing the stone in direction d from l_from to l_to.

Wait, the preconditions for "pushtogoal" or "pushtonongoal" require that you can move from l_p to l_from following direction d. So for example, if the agent is at pos21 (l_p), and the stone is at pos22 (l_from), and the direction is dirdown, then moving from pos21 to pos22 following dirdown is allowed (since the problem says "You may move from location pos21 to location pos22 following direction dirdown"). Therefore, the agent can perform a push action from pos21 to pos22, pushing the stone to pos23 (dirdown). Because l_from is pos22, l_to is pos23, direction d is dirdown. The action would be pushtonongoal, since pos23 is not a goal.

So the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirdown

This action's preconditions:

(i) agent is at pos21: yes.

(ii) stone1 is at pos22: yes.

(iii) pos23 is clear: initially, yes.

(iv) can move from pos21 to pos22 via dirdown: yes, per the given movement.

(v) can move from pos22 to pos23 via dirdown: per the movement list, pos22 to pos23 is allowed via dirdown.

(vi) pos23 is not a goal: yes, according to the problem, pos23 is not a goal.

So this action is valid. After this action, the agent will be at pos22, and the stone at pos23. pos21 becomes clear.

Now, stone1 is at pos23, which satisfies the constraint that stone1 must be at pos23 in at least one state. Then, the constraint that if stone1 is at pos23, then pos54 must not be clear at some state after that. So we need to make sure that pos54 is not clear at some point after this.

But pos54 is initially clear. So the agent or stone must move there. But the stone is the only other object. So the agent would have to go to pos54. But how? Let's see.

After pushing the stone to pos23, the agent is at pos22. From there, the agent can move to pos12 (left), pos32 (right), pos21 (up), or pos23 (down). But pos23 now has the stone. So moving down to pos23 is possible if pos23 is clear, but after pushing, the stone is at pos23, so pos23 is not clear. So the agent can't move into pos23. So the agent is at pos22 and can move to pos12, pos32, or pos21.

But the next step is to get the stone to pos15. Let's see the path from pos23 to pos15. pos23 → pos24 → pos25 → pos15. Or another route.

Alternatively, maybe push the stone from pos23 to pos24, then to pos25, then to pos15. But pos24 is a non-goal. Let's consider:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown

Preconditions:

Agent at pos22: yes.

Stone1 at pos23: yes.

pos24 is clear: initially yes.

Can move from pos22 to pos23 via dirdown: yes.

Can move from pos23 to pos24 via dirdown: yes.

pos24 is not a goal: yes.

After this, the agent is at pos23, stone at pos24. Now, pos24 is not clear, which satisfies the constraint that pos24 is not clear in at least one state. But we also need to satisfy that if pos24 is not clear, then the agent was at pos33 earlier. So before pushing to pos24, the agent must have been at pos33 at some point. But currently, the agent is at pos23. How to get to pos33?

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to go to pos33 before pushing to pos24. But that would require a detour. Let's think.

Let's backtrack. Maybe after moving the stone to pos23, the agent needs to go to pos33. So after the first push to pos23, the agent is at pos22. Then, move from pos22 to pos32 (right), then to pos33 (down). Then, the agent is at pos33. Then, the agent can go back to push the stone from pos23 to pos24. But during that time, the stone is still at pos23. So steps:

After pushing stone1 to pos23:

1. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (dirright)
2. Move from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown)
3. Now, agent is at pos33, which satisfies the constraint that if pos24 is not clear, then agent was at pos33 earlier. Then, agent moves back to pos23 to push the stone.

But moving from pos33 to pos23: allowed via dirleft (from pos33 to pos23). Then, agent is at pos23. But pos23 has the stone. Wait, after pushing stone1 to pos23, the stone is there, so pos23 is not clear. So the agent can't move into pos23 unless it's pushing the stone again. So perhaps:

Agent is at pos33. To push the stone from pos23 to pos24, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos23. pos23 is south of pos22, east of pos13, etc. Wait, pos33 is at row 3, column3. pos23 is row2, column3. So the agent can move from pos33 to pos23 via dirup. But pos23 is occupied by the stone, so the agent can't move there. Therefore, the agent must push the stone from pos23. To do that, the agent needs to be at pos23's north (pos13), east (pos24), south (pos33?), or west (pos22). Wait, pos23 is at (2,3). pos13 is (1,3), pos22 is (2,2), pos24 is (2,4), pos33 is (3,3). So the agent can be at pos13, pos22, pos24, or pos33, and push the stone in respective directions.

But the agent is at pos33. To push the stone at pos23, the agent must be adjacent. For example, from pos33, moving north to pos23 (dirup). But pos23 is occupied by the stone, so the agent can't move there. Therefore, the agent can't directly push the stone from pos33. So maybe the agent has to go around.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos23, the agent is at pos22. Then, the agent can move to pos32 (right), then to pos33 (down). Then, the agent is at pos33, satisfying the constraint. Then, the agent can move back to pos22 (left and up?), but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, after the first push to pos23, the agent is at pos22. Let's see the path from pos22 to pos33:

pos22 → pos32 (dirright), then pos32 → pos33 (dirdown). So two moves. Then agent is at pos33. Now, to push the stone from pos23 to pos24, the agent needs to be at a position adjacent to pos23, such as pos22 (west of pos23), pos13 (north), pos24 (east), or pos33 (south). But the agent is at pos33. To push the stone north from pos23 to pos24, the agent would need to be south of pos23 (pos33 is south of pos23). So direction d would be dirup. So the agent can push the stone from pos23 to pos24 by being at pos33 and pushing north. Wait, but to push, the agent must be able to move from their current position (l_p) to the stone's position (l_from) via direction d. So if the agent is at pos33 (l_p), and the stone is at pos23 (l_from), then direction d must allow moving from pos33 to pos23. Looking at the movement list: from pos33, can you move to pos23? The allowed moves from pos33 are:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"

Wait, no. Looking back:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft" → no, pos33 is (3,3). pos23 is (2,3). Moving from pos33 to pos23 would be dirup, not dirleft.

Wait, checking the movement list:

From pos33:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"

Wait, that's confusing. pos33 is (3,3). pos23 is (2,3). The direction from pos33 to pos23 is up (dirup), not left. But according to the given movement list:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"

That's a mistake. Or perhaps the directions are mislabeled. For example, dirleft might correspond to moving west, dirright east, dirup north, dirdown south. So moving from pos33 (3,3) to pos23 (2,3) would require dirup. But the problem's movement list says that from pos33 to pos23 is dirleft. That's impossible. Therefore, there's an error in the problem's movement directions. This is another issue.

Given that, perhaps the problem's directions are defined differently. For example, dirleft might correspond to north, but that's unconventional. Alternatively, the movement directions are mixed up. This makes it hard to proceed accurately. 

Alternatively, perhaps the movement directions are such that dirleft is west, dirright is east, dirup is north, dirdown is south. That's standard. So from pos33 (3,3), moving dirup would take the agent to pos23 (2,3). But according to the problem's movement list, moving from pos33 to pos23 is allowed via dirleft. That's inconsistent. Therefore, there's a mistake in the problem's movement directions. This is a problem.

Given these inconsistencies, perhaps I should proceed by assuming that the directions are as per standard (dirleft is west, etc.), and the movement list has errors. Alternatively, take the movement list as given, even if it's incorrect. For example, if from pos33 to pos23 is dirleft, then perhaps the direction labeling is different. But this complicates planning.

Given the complexity and potential errors in the problem statement, I'll proceed with the information as given, even if it's contradictory. Let's try to outline a possible plan.

The main goal is to get stone1 to pos15. Let's plan the path:

pos22 → pos23 → pos24 → pos25 → pos15.

But pos25 to pos15 is a move to the left (dirleft), as per the movement list: "You may move from location pos25 to location pos15 following direction dirleft".

So to push the stone from pos25 to pos15, the agent needs to be east of pos25 (pos35) and push left. But pos35 is a non-goal location.

Alternatively, the agent can push the stone from pos25 to pos15 using pushtogoal, since pos15 is a goal. So the action would be pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos25 pos15 dirleft. Wait, no. The agent needs to be at a position adjacent to the stone. So to push from pos25 to pos15, the agent must be at pos25's east (pos35), and push west (dirleft). So l_p is pos35, l_from is pos25, l_to is pos15, direction dirleft.

But to get the agent to pos35, they would need to navigate there. However, pos34 must always be clear. So the agent can't go through pos34. So the path to pos35 must avoid pos34.

Alternatively, the agent can take a different route. For example, push the stone from pos22 to pos23, then to pos24, pos25, and then to pos15.

But first, the constraints:

- pos13 must be not clear at some point. So agent or stone must be there. Since the stone is being moved towards pos15, maybe the agent can go to pos13.

- pos24 must be not clear (stone there), but when that happens, the agent must have been at pos33 earlier.

- The agent must be at pos24 at some point. And before that, must have been at pos51.

- pos15 must be not clear (stone there), and when that happens, the agent must be at pos21 or pos44 in that state or later.

- pos31 must be not clear at some point.

- stone must be at pos23 and pos25 at some points.

- pos54 must be not clear after stone is at pos23.

- pos35 must be not clear in at most one continuous sequence.

This is very complex. Let's try to build the plan step by step, ensuring all constraints are met.

First, push the stone from pos22 to pos23. This satisfies the constraint that stone1 is at pos23. Then, we need to ensure that after that, pos54 is not clear. So the agent must somehow make pos54 not clear. The only way is for the agent to be there, since there's only one stone. So the agent needs to reach pos54 later.

After pushing to pos23, the agent is at pos22. Then, move to pos32 (dirright), then to pos33 (dirdown). Now, the agent is at pos33. This satisfies the constraint that if pos24 is not clear, the agent was at pos33 earlier. Then, push the stone from pos23 to pos24. But to do that, the agent must be adjacent to pos23. From pos33, can the agent push north (dirup) to pos23? According to movement list, from pos33 to pos23 is allowed via dirleft. So direction dirleft would mean moving west? But pos33 is (3,3), pos23 is (2,3). Moving west from pos33 would go to pos32. So this is conflicting. Therefore, the movement directions are labeled incorrectly. Given this confusion, perhaps the agent can't push the stone from pos33. So maybe the agent has to go back to pos22 and push the stone east to pos24.

Wait, after pushing to pos23, agent is at pos22. From pos22, the agent can move east to pos32 (dirright), then down to pos33 (dirdown). Then, agent is at pos33. Now, the constraint for pos24 not clear (when we push the stone there) requires that the agent was at pos33 earlier, which is satisfied. Then, the agent needs to push the stone from pos23 to pos24. To do that, the agent must be adjacent to pos23. From pos33, can the agent move north to pos23? According to the movement list, from pos33 to pos23 is allowed via dirleft. So direction dirleft allows moving from pos33 to pos23. Therefore, the agent can move from pos33 to pos23 via dirleft. But pos23 has the stone, so it's not clear. So the agent can't move there. Therefore, the agent must push the stone from pos23 to pos24 while being at pos23's adjacent tile.

Alternatively, the agent is at pos33 and wants to push the stone at pos23 north to pos24. But to do that, the agent needs to be south of pos23 (at pos33) and push north. But according to the movement list, can the agent push from pos33 to pos23 via dirup? The movement list says from pos33 to pos23 is dirleft, which doesn't make sense. This is too confusing. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should proceed with an approximate plan.

Alternative plan outline:

1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirdown → stone at pos23 (satisfies constraint), agent at pos22.

2. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright → agent at pos32.

3. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown → agent at pos33 (satisfies pos33 requirement for pos24 constraint).

4. Now, need to push stone from pos23 to pos24. Agent is at pos33. To push, agent must be adjacent. From pos33, can the agent move to pos23 via dirup? If the movement list allows it. According to the problem's movement list: "You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft". But that's west, which would be from pos33 (3,3) to pos23 (2,3), which should be north. This is a mistake. Assuming that dirleft allows moving from pos33 to pos23, then the agent can move to pos23. But pos23 has the stone, so it's not clear. So agent can't move there. Therefore, the agent must push the stone from pos23 to pos24 by being at a different location.

Alternatively, the agent can move from pos33 to pos34, but pos34 must remain clear always. So agent can't go there. So the agent can't move east from pos33 to pos34. So stuck.

Alternative route: from pos33, move west to pos32, then north to pos22. Then, from pos22, push the stone east to pos24. Wait, pos23 is the current location of the stone. To push east from pos23 to pos24, the agent must be west of pos23 (pos22). So:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirright

But direction from pos22 to pos23 is dirdown, not dirright. Wait, pos22 is (2,2). pos23 is (2,3). So east direction. So dirright. So from pos22 to pos23 is dirright. Then, pushing the stone from pos23 to pos24 via dirright (east). So the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirright

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos22: yes.

- Stone at pos23: yes.

- pos24 clear: yes.

- Can move from pos22 to pos23 via dirright: check movement list. From pos22, allowed moves are: pos12 (left), pos32 (right), pos21 (up), pos23 (down). Wait, according to the movement list:

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos32 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos21 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos23 following direction dirdown"

So direction from pos22 to pos23 is dirdown, not dirright. Therefore, the agent can't push the stone from pos23 to pos24 by being at pos22 and pushing east. Because to push east from pos23, the agent must be at pos23's west (pos22) and push east. But the direction from pos22 to pos23 is dirdown, not dirright. Therefore, the agent can't use dirright to move from pos22 to pos23. Thus, the preconditions for the push action are not met.

This is getting too complicated. Let's try a different approach. The main goal is to get the stone to pos15, satisfying all constraints. Let's try to find the shortest path for the stone, while meeting the constraints.

Stone's path: pos22 → pos23 → pos24 → pos25 → pos15.

Each push requires the agent to be in the correct position. Let's outline the steps:

1. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown). Agent ends at pos22.

   - Now, stone1 is at pos23 (satisfies constraint).

   - Need to ensure that pos54 is not clear later.

2. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown). Agent needs to be at pos23's north (pos13) or south (pos33) or east (pos24) or west (pos22).

   - If agent is at pos22, can push east to pos23, then east to pos24. But direction from pos22 to pos23 is dirdown. So to push east from pos23 to pos24, agent must be west of pos23 (pos22) and push east. But movement from pos22 to pos23 is dirdown, so the direction for the push would be dirdown? No, to push east, the direction from the agent's position to the stone's position must be east. So agent must be west of the stone. But pos23's west is pos22. From pos22 to pos23 is dirdown. So direction is dirdown, not east. Therefore, the agent can't push east from pos23 to pos24 from pos22. Therefore, the agent must approach from the north or south.

Alternatively, agent moves to pos24 and pushes north. Wait, pos24 is east of pos23. To push from pos23 to pos24, the agent must be at pos23's east (pos24) and push west. But pos24 is clear initially. So the agent can move to pos24, then push west. But how to get to pos24.

Agent is at pos22 after the first push. From there, can move to pos32 (dirright), then to pos33 (dirdown), then to pos34 (dirright) → but pos34 must remain clear. So can't go there. So agent can't move to pos34. Alternative path: pos22 → pos32 → pos42 → ... But that's too far.

Alternatively, agent can move from pos22 to pos23 (but it's occupied by the stone), so no. Therefore, the agent can't move directly to pos24 from pos22. 

This suggests that pushing the stone from pos23 to pos24 is not straightforward. Maybe we need to take a different route for the stone. For example, pos22 → pos12 → pos13 → pos14 → pos15. But pos12 is clear. Let's see.

But the agent starts at pos21. To push the stone north from pos22 to pos12, the agent must be south of pos22 (pos32?), but that's not adjacent. Wait, pos22's north is pos12. To push north, the agent must be south of pos22 (pos32) and push north. But pos32 is south of pos22? No, pos22 is (2,2). pos32 is (3,2), which is south. So agent at pos32 can push north to pos22. But the stone is at pos22. So pushing north from pos22 to pos12 requires the agent to be at pos22's south (pos32), but the stone is at pos22. So the agent would have to move to pos32, then push north to pos22, but pos22 is already occupied by the stone. This is confusing.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, perhaps the optimal plan involves moving the stone to pos23, then to pos24, then to pos25, then to pos15, while fulfilling all constraints along the way.

Let's attempt to write the plan step by step, ensuring all constraints are met.

Step 1: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirdown

- Agent moves from pos21 to pos22 (dirdown) to push stone to pos23.

- After this, stone is at pos23 (satisfies constraint), agent at pos22.

- Now, pos22 is not clear (agent there), pos23 not clear (stone), pos21 is clear.

Step 2: move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright

- Agent moves right to pos32.

- Now, pos32 is not clear, pos22 is clear.

Step 3: move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown

- Agent moves down to pos33.

- Now, pos33 is not clear (satisfies pos31 not clear? No, pos31 is different. Wait, pos31 is (3,1). pos33 is (3,3). So this doesn't affect pos31. Hmm, need to make pos31 not clear. So the agent must visit pos31 at some point. How? pos31 is in row3, column1. So the agent needs to go west from pos32 to pos31? From pos32, can the agent move west to pos31? Checking movement list: from pos32, allowed moves are pos22 (left), pos42 (right), pos31 (up), pos33 (down). Wait, movement list says:

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos31 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown"

So from pos32, agent can move to pos31 via dirup. So step:

Step 4: move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup

- Agent moves to pos31. Now, pos31 is not clear (satisfies constraint).

Step 5: move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown

- Agent moves back to pos32.

Step 6: move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown

- Agent at pos33 again.

Now, need to push the stone from pos23 to pos24. To do that, agent must be adjacent. From pos33, can the agent push north to pos23? According to movement list, from pos33 to pos23 is allowed via dirleft. Assuming dirleft is west (which would be from pos33 to pos23, which is north, but perhaps directions are labeled incorrectly), but this is confusing. Assuming it's possible, then:

Step 7: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos24 dirleft

- Agent at pos33 pushes stone from pos23 to pos24 via dirleft. But dirleft would typically be west, but pos23 is north of pos33. This is conflicting. Assuming the action is allowed despite the direction label, the stone moves to pos24.

- Now, pos24 is not clear (satisfies constraint), and since the agent was at pos33 earlier, this satisfies the constraint that if pos24 is not clear, agent was at pos33.

Step 8: move player1 pos33 pos34 dirright → invalid, because pos34 must remain clear. So can't do that.

Alternative step 7: agent moves from pos33 to pos23 (if allowed), but pos23 is occupied by stone. So can't.

Alternative approach: agent moves from pos33 to pos23 via dirup (if allowed). But movement list says from pos33 to pos23 is dirleft. Assuming it's allowed, then:

Step 7: move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft → pos23 is not clear (stone there), so can't move.

Alternative, agent needs to go around to pos24 to push the stone. From pos33, agent can move to pos34 (but pos34 must stay clear). So no.

This is not working. Let's try a different route for the stone.

Alternative plan:

After step 1 (stone at pos23), agent moves to pos13 to satisfy pos13 not clear.

Step 2: move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft (from pos22 to pos12 is allowed via dirleft).

Step 3: move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown.

- Agent at pos13, making it not clear (satisfies constraint).

Step 4: move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown.

Step 5: move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown.

- Now, agent is at pos15. Need to push the stone from pos23 to pos24, etc. But this seems too long.

Alternatively, after step1, agent goes to pos51 to satisfy the constraint that before being at pos24, agent was at pos51.

So:

Step 2: move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup.

Step 3: move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright.

Step 4: move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright.

Step 5: move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright.

- Now, agent is at pos51 (satisfies the constraint that before being at pos24, agent was at pos51).

Step 6: move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft.

Step 7: move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft.

Step 8: move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft.

Step 9: move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown.

Step 10: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown.

But this is getting too long. Considering the optimal plan must be as short as possible, this approach may not be optimal.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I'll propose a plan that attempts to satisfy all constraints, even if it's not perfect. The key steps would be:

1. Push stone to pos23.

2. Agent moves to pos33.

3. Push stone to pos24.

4. Agent moves to pos51 and back.

5. Push stone to pos25.

6. Push stone to pos15.

But ensuring all constraints are met. For example:

Step 1: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirdown → stone at pos23.

Step 2: move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright → pos32.

Step 3: move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown → pos33 (satisfies pos24's constraint).

Step 4: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos24 dirleft → stone at pos24. (Assuming direction is allowed).

Step 5: move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup.

Step 6: move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup → pos31 (satisfies pos31 not clear).

Step 7: move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright.

Step 8: move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright → pos51.

Step 9: move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft.

Step 10: move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft.

Step 11: move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown → pos32.

Step 12: move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown → pos33.

Step 13: move player1 pos33 pos34 dirright → invalid (pos34 must stay clear).

Alternative path from pos33 to pos24:

Step 4: After stone is at pos24, agent needs to be at pos24. So:

Step 4: move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft → can't, stone is at pos24 now.

Alternatively, after step4 (stone at pos24), agent is at pos23. Then, move to pos24:

Step 5: move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown → pos24 (satisfies agent at pos24, which requires prior visit to pos51. But we haven't been to pos51 yet. So need to insert steps to go to pos51 before reaching pos24.

This is extremely complicated. Given the time, I'll provide a tentative plan, noting that it may not satisfy all constraints but attempts to do so:

```
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirdown
move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright
move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos24 dirleft
move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup
move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft
move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft
move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos24 pos25 dirdown
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos25 pos15 dirleft
```

But this is likely incorrect, especially with directions and constraints. Given the time constraints, I'll provide a plan that attempts to cover the main steps, acknowledging that some constraints might not be met. However, due to the complexity and potential errors in the problem statement, this is challenging.
