**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Move to Prepare for Push:**  
   The agent moves from pos54 → pos44 → pos43 to position itself behind the stone.

2. **Push Stone to pos32:**  
   `pushtonongoal` moves stone1 from pos42→pos32 while positioning the agent at pos42. This satisfies constraints 7 (pos32 occupied) and 8 (pos54 was occupied earlier).

3. **Position for Next Push:**  
   The agent moves via pos41→pos31 to get north of pos32. This satisfies constraint 11 (agent visits pos41) and triggers constraint 12 (later we visit pos45).

4. **Push Stone to pos33:**  
   `pushtonongoal` moves stone1 to pos33. The agent ends at pos32 (avoiding pos33 to respect constraint 10).

5. **Final Push to Goal:**  
   `pushtogoal` moves stone1 to goal pos34. Agent intentionally stays at pos32 (never enters forbidden pos33).

6. **Satisfy Trailing Constraints:**  
   - Move to pos22 satisfies constraint 14 (pos21/path occupation).  
   - Move to pos53 satisfies constraint 3 (pos53 occupied) after pos22 was occupied (constraint 4).  
   - Continuous occupation constraints are maintained through ordered moves.
