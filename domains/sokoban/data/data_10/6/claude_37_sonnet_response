Alright, let me start by understanding the problem. This is a Sokoban-like puzzle where we have a 2D grid, an agent (player1), and a stone (stone1). The goal is to push the stone onto a goal location. We have to follow certain constraints while planning.

First, let's visualize the grid:

```
    1   2   3   4   5
  +---+---+---+---+---+
1 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
2 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
3 |   |   |   | G |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
4 |   | S |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
5 |   |   |   | P |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
```

Where:
- P is the player (at pos54)
- S is the stone (at pos42)
- G is a goal location (at pos34)

The task is to move the stone to the goal location (pos34).

Now, let's go through the constraints:

1. "Location pos34 is not clear" must be true at some point. This means the stone or player must be at pos34 at some point.
2. If "Location pos34 is not clear" is true at some state s, then "Location pos21 is not clear" must also be true at s or in a later state. This means if the stone or player is at pos34, then the stone or player must also be at pos21 at the same time or later.
3. "Location pos53 is not clear" must be true at some point. This means the stone or player must be at pos53 at some point.
4. If "Location pos53 is not clear" is true at some state, then there must be an earlier state where "Location pos22 is not clear" is true. This means before the stone or player is at pos53, the stone or player must have been at pos22.
5. Either "stone1 is at location pos41" or "Location pos13 is not clear" must be true at some point. This means either the stone must be at pos41 at some point, or something (the player or stone) must be at pos13 at some point.
6. "Location pos52 is not clear" must be true in at most one continuous sequence of states. This means the stone or player can be at pos52 only in a continuous sequence, not multiple separate times.
7. "Location pos32 is not clear" must be true at some point. This means the stone or player must be at pos32 at some point.
8. If "Location pos32 is not clear" is true at some state, then there must be an earlier state where "Location pos54 is not clear" is true. This means before the stone or player is at pos32, the stone or player must have been at pos54. Note that initially, the player is at pos54, so this constraint is satisfied from the start.
9. "Location pos41 is not clear" must be true in at most one continuous sequence of states. This means the stone or player can be at pos41 only in a continuous sequence, not multiple separate times.
10. "player1 is not at location pos33" must be true in every state. This means the player can never be at pos33.
11. "player1 is at location pos41" must be true at some point. This means the player must be at pos41 at some point.
12. If "player1 is at location pos41" is true at some state s, then "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'Location pos45 is not clear', 'stone1 is at location pos44'" must be true at s or in a later state. This means if the player is at pos41, then either pos45 is not clear or the stone is at pos44 at the same time or later.
13. "Location pos32 is not clear" must be true in at most one continuous sequence of states. This means the stone or player can be at pos32 only in a continuous sequence, not multiple separate times.
14. "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'player1 is at location pos21', 'Location pos21 is not clear'" must be true at some point. This means either the player must be at pos21 at some point, or something (the player or stone) must be at pos21 at some point.

Now, let's plan how to push the stone from pos42 to pos34:

1. First, I need to move the player from pos54 to a position from which they can push the stone.
2. Based on the constraints, I need to ensure that the player visits certain positions (e.g., pos41, pos21) and certain locations (e.g., pos32, pos53) must be occupied at some point.

Let's start planning:

Initial state: Player at pos54, Stone at pos42.
Goal: Stone at pos34 (goal location).

Let's think about the high-level plan:
1. Move the player to a position from which they can push the stone.
2. Push the stone towards the goal location (pos34).
3. Ensure all constraints are met.

Let's trace through a possible plan:

1. From the initial position, the player can move left to pos44.
2. From pos44, the player can move up to pos43.
3. From pos43, the player can move left to pos33.
   - Wait, constraint 10 says the player can never be at pos33. Let's reconsider.
3. From pos43, the player can move up to pos42, but the stone is already there.
   - Let's try a different approach.
1. From the initial position, the player can move up to pos53.
2. From pos53, the player can move left to pos43.
3. From pos43, the player can move up to pos42. However, the stone is at pos42. So, we'll push the stone up to pos32.
4. From pos42, the player can push the stone to pos32 using the `pushtonongoal` action.
5. Now, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32.
6. The player can move left to pos32 (where the stone is) and then push the stone left to pos22.
   - Wait, the player can't move to pos32 because the stone is there. Let's reconsider.
6. The player is at pos42. The stone is at pos32. The player needs to move to pos22 to be behind the stone from the left. Let's move the player:
   - Player moves left to pos32 (where the stone is). This isn't possible.
   - Let's try a different path. The player is at pos42. Let's go up to pos41, then left to pos31, then down to pos32.
   - But the stone is at pos32, so we can't move the player there. Let's try another path.
   - Player is at pos42. Let's go down to pos43, then left to pos33, but the player can't be at pos33 due to constraint 10.
   - Let's try yet another path. Player is at pos42. Let's go down to pos43, down to pos44, left to pos34, left to pos24, up to pos23, up to pos22.
   - Now the player is at pos22, and the stone is at pos32. The player can push the stone left from pos32 to pos22.
   - But wait, the player is at pos22 and the stone is at pos32. The player needs to be at pos31 to push the stone from pos32 to pos22. Let's try again.

Hmm, there's a challenge here. Let me trace through a different plan:

1. From the initial position (player at pos54), the player moves left to pos44.
2. From pos44, the player moves up to pos43.
3. From pos43, the player moves right to pos53. This satisfies constraint 3, which requires "Location pos53 is not clear" to be true at some point.
4. From pos53, the player moves down to pos54.
5. From pos54, the player moves up to pos53, up to pos52, up to pos51, left to pos41. This satisfies constraint 11, which requires the player to be at pos41 at some point.
6. From pos41, the player moves down to pos42, where the stone is. Let's push the stone up to pos32 using the `pushtonongoal` action. This satisfies constraint 7, which requires "Location pos32 is not clear" to be true at some point.
7. Now, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32.
8. From pos42, the player moves down to pos43, left to pos33. But the player can't be at pos33 due to constraint 10.
   - Let's try a different path. From pos42, the player moves down to pos43, down to pos44, left to pos34, left to pos24, up to pos23, up to pos22, up to pos21. This satisfies constraint 14, which requires either the player to be at pos21 or location pos21 to be not clear at some point.
9. From pos21, the player moves down to pos22, right to pos32. The stone is at pos32, so the player can push the stone right to pos42 using the `pushtonongoal` action.
10. Now, the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos42 (back to its original position).
11. From pos32, the player moves down to pos33. But the player can't be at pos33 due to constraint 10.
   - Let's try a different path. From pos32, the player moves up to pos31, up to pos21, down to pos22, down to pos23, down to pos24, right to pos34, right to pos44, down to pos45. This might satisfy constraint 12, which requires that if the player is at pos41 at some state s, then either pos45 is not clear or the stone is at pos44 at s or in a later state. Since the player is now at pos45, "Location pos45 is not clear" is true.
12. From pos45, the player moves up to pos44, left to pos34. This is the goal location.
13. From pos34, the player moves left to pos24, up to pos23, up to pos22, right to pos32, right to pos42. The stone is at pos42, so the player can push the stone right to pos52 using the `pushtonongoal` action. This satisfies constraint 6, which requires "Location pos52 is not clear" to be true in at most one continuous sequence of states.
14. Now, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos52.
15. From pos42, the player moves right to pos52. The stone is at pos52, so the player can push the stone right to pos42 using the `pushtonongoal` action.
16. Now, the player is at pos52 and the stone is at pos42 (back to its original position again).
17. From pos52, the player moves left to pos42. The stone is at pos42, so the player can push the stone down to pos43 using the `pushtonongoal` action.
18. Now, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos43.
19. From pos42, the player moves down to pos43. The stone is at pos43, so the player can push the stone down to pos44 using the `pushtonongoal` action. This satisfies constraint 12, which requires that if the player is at pos41 at some state s, then either pos45 is not clear or the stone is at pos44 at s or in a later state.
20. Now, the player is at pos43 and the stone is at pos44.
21. From pos43, the player moves down to pos44. The stone is at pos44, so the player can push the stone left to pos34 using the `pushtogoal` action. This satisfies constraint 1, which requires "Location pos34 is not clear" to be true at some point.
22. Now, the player is at pos44 and the stone is at pos34 (a goal location). This satisfies the main goal of the problem.

But I also need to satisfy constraint 2, which requires that if "Location pos34 is not clear" is true at some state s, then "Location pos21 is not clear" must also be true at s or in a later state. Currently, neither the player nor the stone is at pos21.

Let's adjust our plan:

After step 22, where the stone is at pos34 and the player is at pos44, let's move the player to pos21:
23. From pos44, the player moves up to pos43, up to pos42, up to pos41, left to pos31, up to pos21. This satisfies constraint 2.

Now, let's check if our plan satisfies all constraints:
1. "Location pos34 is not clear" is true at step 22. ✓
2. "Location pos21 is not clear" is true at step 23, which is after step 22. ✓
3. "Location pos53 is not clear" is true at step 3. ✓
4. "Location pos22 is not clear" must be true before step 3. In our plan, the player is at pos22 at steps 8-9, which is after step 3, not before. ✗
5. Either "stone1 is at location pos41" or "Location pos13 is not clear" must be true at some point. In our plan, neither of these are true. ✗
6. "Location pos52 is not clear" is true only in the sequence of steps 14-16. ✓
7. "Location pos32 is not clear" is true at step 6. ✓
8. "Location pos54 is not clear" must be true before step 6. It's true at the initial state, so this is satisfied. ✓
9. "Location pos41 is not clear" is true only in the sequence of steps 5-6. ✓
10. "player1 is not at location pos33" is true in every state. We've been careful to avoid pos33. ✓
11. "player1 is at location pos41" is true at step 5. ✓
12. "Location pos45 is not clear" is true at step 11 and "stone1 is at location pos44" is true at step 20, both of which are after step 5. ✓
13. "Location pos32 is not clear" is true only in the sequence of steps 6-9. ✓
14. "player1 is at location pos21" is true at step 8. ✓

So, our current plan doesn't satisfy constraints 4 and 5. Let's adjust our plan:

For constraint 4, we need "Location pos22 is not clear" to be true before "Location pos53 is not clear" (which is true at step 3). Let's modify our plan:

1. From the initial position (player at pos54), the player moves left to pos44.
2. From pos44, the player moves left to pos34, left to pos24, up to pos23, up to pos22. This satisfies the "Location pos22 is not clear" requirement.
3. From pos22, the player moves down to pos23, down to pos24, right to pos34, right to pos44, up to pos43, right to pos53. This satisfies the "Location pos53 is not clear" requirement, and it comes after "Location pos22 is not clear" is true.

For constraint 5, we need either "stone1 is at location pos41" or "Location pos13 is not clear" to be true at some point. 

Let's adjust our plan further:

4. From pos53, the player moves down to pos54, up to pos53, up to pos52, up to pos51, left to pos41. Now, the player is at pos41.
5. From pos41, the player moves down to pos42, where the stone is. Let's push the stone up to pos32 using the `pushtonongoal` action.
6. From pos42, the player moves up to pos32, up to pos22, up to pos12, right to pos13. This satisfies the "Location pos13 is not clear" requirement.

Now, let's continue with our adjusted plan:

7. From pos13, the player moves left to pos12, down to pos22, down to pos32, down to pos42, down to pos43, down to pos44, left to pos34 (goal location).
8. From pos34, the player moves right to pos44, up to pos43. The stone is at pos32, so we need to move the player to a position from which they can push the stone to the goal location.
9. From pos43, the player moves up to pos42, up to pos32. The stone is at pos32, so the player can push the stone left to pos22 using the `pushtonongoal` action.
10. From pos32, the player moves left to pos22. The stone is at pos22, so the player can push the stone left to pos12 using the `pushtonongoal` action.
11. From pos22, the player moves left to pos12. The stone is at pos12, so the player can push the stone down to pos13 using the `pushtonongoal` action.
12. From pos12, the player moves down to pos13. The stone is at pos13, so the player can push the stone down to pos14 using the `pushtonongoal` action.
13. From pos13, the player moves down to pos14. The stone is at pos14, so the player can push the stone right to pos24 using the `pushtonongoal` action.
14. From pos14, the player moves right to pos24. The stone is at pos24, so the player can push the stone right to pos34 using the `pushtogoal` action.
15. Now, the player is at pos24 and the stone is at pos34 (a goal location). This satisfies the main goal of the problem.

For constraint 2, which requires that if "Location pos34 is not clear" is true at some state s, then "Location pos21 is not clear" must also be true at s or in a later state:

16. From pos24, the player moves up to pos23, up to pos22, up to pos21. This satisfies constraint 2.

Let me check if our plan satisfies all constraints now:
1. "Location pos34 is not clear" is true at step 15. ✓
2. "Location pos21 is not clear" is true at step 16, which is after step 15. ✓
3. "Location pos53 is not clear" is true at step 3. ✓
4. "Location pos22 is not clear" is true at step 2, which is before step 3. ✓
5. "Location pos13 is not clear" is true at step 6. ✓
6. "Location pos52 is not clear" is true only in step 4. ✓
7. "Location pos32 is not clear" is true at steps 5 and 9. ✗
8. "Location pos54 is not clear" is true before "Location pos32 is not clear" is true at step 5. ✓
9. "Location pos41 is not clear" is true only in the sequence of steps 4-5. ✓
10. "player1 is not at location pos33" is true in every state. We've been careful to avoid pos33. ✓
11. "player1 is at location pos41" is true at step 4. ✓
12. "Location pos45 is not clear" is true or "stone1 is at location pos44" is true at some point after step 4. ✗
13. "Location pos32 is not clear" is true at steps 5 and 9, which are two non-continuous sequences. ✗
14. "player1 is at location pos21" is true at step 16. ✓

Our plan still doesn't satisfy constraints 7, 12, and 13. Let's adjust it further.

For constraint 7 and 13, "Location pos32 is not clear" should be true in at most one continuous sequence of states. In our current plan, it's true at steps 5 and 9, which are two separate sequences. Let's adjust our plan so that "Location pos32 is not clear" is true only once.

For constraint 12, after the player is at pos41, either pos45 is not clear or the stone is at pos44 at some point. Let's ensure this is satisfied.

Let's revisit our plan:

1. From the initial position (player at pos54), the player moves left to pos44.
2. From pos44, the player moves left to pos34, left to pos24, up to pos23, up to pos22. This satisfies the "Location pos22 is not clear" requirement.
3. From pos22, the player moves down to pos23, down to pos24, right to pos34, right to pos44, up to pos43, right to pos53. This satisfies the "Location pos53 is not clear" requirement, and it comes after "Location pos22 is not clear" is true.
4. From pos53, the player moves down to pos54, up to pos53, up to pos52, up to pos51, left to pos41. Now, the player is at pos41.
5. For constraint 12, after the player is at pos41, either pos45 is not clear or the stone is at pos44 at some point. Let's modify our plan:
   - From pos41, the player moves down to pos42, down to pos43, down to pos44, down to pos45. This makes "Location pos45 is not clear" true.
   - From pos45, the player moves up to pos44, up to pos43, up to pos42, where the stone is.
6. From pos42, the player pushes the stone down to pos43 using the `pushtonongoal` action.
7. From pos43, the player pushes the stone down to pos44 using the `pushtonongoal` action. This satisfies constraint 12, as the stone is at pos44 after the player is at pos41.
8. From pos44, the player can push the stone left to pos34 using the `pushtogoal` action. This satisfies constraint 1, which requires "Location pos34 is not clear" to be true at some point.
9. Now, the player is at pos44 and the stone is at pos34 (a goal location). This satisfies the main goal of the problem.
10. For constraint 2, which requires that if "Location pos34 is not clear" is true at some state s, then "Location pos21 is not clear" must also be true at s or in a later state:
    - From pos44, the player moves up to pos43, up to pos42, up to pos41, left to pos31, up to pos21. This satisfies constraint 2.
11. For constraint 5, we need either "stone1 is at location pos41" or "Location pos13 is not clear" to be true at some point. In our current plan, the stone is not at pos41 at any point. So, we need to ensure "Location pos13 is not clear" is true at some point.
    - After step 10, from pos21, the player moves down to pos22, right to pos32, down to pos33. Wait, the player can't be at pos33 due to constraint 10.
    - Let's try a different path. From pos21, the player moves down to pos22, right to pos32, down to pos42, left to pos32, left to pos22, left to pos12, down to pos13. This satisfies the "Location pos13 is not clear" requirement.

Hmm, but I realized that in the above plan, "Location pos32 is not clear" is true multiple times, which violates constraints 7 and 13. Let me revise my plan to ensure "Location pos32 is not clear" is true only in one continuous sequence of states.

Let's restart the planning:

1. From the initial position (player at pos54), the player moves left to pos44.
2. From pos44, the player moves left to pos34, left to pos24, up to pos23, up to pos22. This satisfies the "Location pos22 is not clear" requirement.
3. From pos22, the player moves left to pos12, down to pos13. This satisfies the "Location pos13 is not clear" requirement.
4. From pos13, the player moves up to pos12, right to pos22, down to pos23, down to pos24, right to pos34, right to pos44, up to pos43, right to pos53. This satisfies the "Location pos53 is not clear" requirement, and it comes after "Location pos22 is not clear" is true.
5. From pos53, the player moves down to pos54, up to pos53, up to pos52, up to pos51, left to pos41. Now, the player is at pos41. This satisfies constraint 11.
6. From pos41, the player moves down to pos42, where the stone is. Let's push the stone right to pos52 using the `pushtonongoal` action. This makes "Location pos52 is not clear" true.
7. From pos42, the player moves right to pos52. The stone is at pos52, so the player can push the stone down to pos53 using the `pushtonongoal` action.
8. From pos52, the player moves down to pos53. The stone is at pos53, so the player can push the stone down to pos54 using the `pushtonongoal` action.
9. From pos53, the player moves down to pos54. The stone is at pos54, so the player can push the stone left to pos44 using the `pushtonongoal` action. This satisfies constraint 12, as the stone is at pos44 after the player is at pos41.
10. From pos54, the player moves left to pos44. The stone is at pos44, so the player can push the stone left to pos34 using the `pushtogoal` action. This satisfies constraint 1, which requires "Location pos34 is not clear" to be true at some point.
11. Now, the player is at pos44 and the stone is at pos34 (a goal location). This satisfies the main goal of the problem.
12. For constraint 2, which requires that if "Location pos34 is not clear" is true at some state s, then "Location pos21 is not clear" must also be true at s or in a later state:
    - From pos44, the player moves up to pos43, up to pos42, up to pos41, left to pos31, up to pos21. This satisfies constraint 2.

Alright, let's check if this plan satisfies all constraints:
1. "Location pos34 is not clear" is true at step 10. ✓
2. "Location pos21 is not clear" is true at step 12, which is after step 10. ✓
3. "Location pos53 is not clear" is true at steps 4 and 7-8. ✓
4. "Location pos22 is not clear" is true at step 2, which is before steps 4 and 7-8. ✓
5. "Location pos13 is not clear" is true at step 3. ✓
6. "Location pos52 is not clear" is true only in the sequence of steps 6-7. ✓
7. "Location pos32 is not clear" must be true at some point. In our current plan, it's not true at any point. ✗
8. "Location pos54 is not clear" must be true before "Location pos32 is not clear" is true. But "Location pos32 is not clear" is not true in our plan. ✗
9. "Location pos41 is not clear" is true only in the sequence of steps 5-6. ✓
10. "player1 is not at location pos33" is true in every state. We've been careful to avoid pos33. ✓
11. "player1 is at location pos41" is true at step 5. ✓
12. "stone1 is at location pos44" is true at step 9, which is after step 5. ✓
13. "Location pos32 is not clear" must be true in at most one continuous sequence of states. But "Location pos32 is not clear" is not true in our plan. ✗
14. "player1 is at location pos21" is true at step 12. ✓

Our plan still doesn't satisfy constraints 7, 8, and 13. Constraint 7 requires "Location pos32 is not clear" to be true at some point, and constraint 13 requires it to be true in at most one continuous sequence of states. Constraint 8 requires "Location pos54 is not clear" to be true before "Location pos32 is not clear" is true, which is inherently satisfied because the initial state has the player at pos54.

Let's adjust our plan to ensure "Location pos32 is not clear" is true at some point:

1. From the initial position (player at pos54), the player moves left to pos44.
2. From pos44, the player moves left to pos34, left to pos24, up to pos23, up to pos22. This satisfies the "Location pos22 is not clear" requirement.
3. From pos22, the player moves left to pos12, down to pos13. This satisfies the "Location pos13 is not clear" requirement.
4. From pos13, the player moves up to pos12, right to pos22, down to pos23, down to pos24, right to pos34, right to pos44, up to pos43, right to pos53. This satisfies the "Location pos53 is not clear" requirement, and it comes after "Location pos22 is not clear" is true.
5. From pos53, the player moves down to pos54, up to pos53, up to pos52, up to pos51, left to pos41. Now, the player is at pos41. This satisfies constraint 11.
6. From pos41, the player moves down to pos42, where the stone is. Let's push the stone up to pos32 using the `pushtonongoal` action. This satisfies constraint 7, which requires "Location pos32 is not clear" to be true at some point.
7. From pos42, the player moves up to pos32. The stone is at pos32, so the player can push the stone left to pos22 using the `pushtonongoal` action.
8. From pos32, the player moves left to pos22. The stone is at pos22, so the player can push the stone down to pos23 using the `pushtonongoal` action.
9. From pos22, the player moves down to pos23. The stone is at pos23, so the player can push the stone down to pos24 using the `pushtonongoal` action.
10. From pos23, the player moves down to pos24. The stone is at pos24, so the player can push the stone right to pos34 using the `pushtogoal` action. This satisfies constraint 1, which requires "Location pos34 is not clear" to be true at some point.
11. Now, the player is at pos24 and the stone is at pos34 (a goal location). This satisfies the main goal of the problem.
12. For constraint 2, which requires that if "Location pos34 is not clear" is true at some state s, then "Location pos21 is not clear" must also be true at s or in a later state:
    - From pos24, the player moves up to pos23, up to pos22, up to pos21. This satisfies constraint 2.
13. For constraint 12, after the player is at pos41, either pos45 is not clear or the stone is at pos44 at some point. In our current plan, the stone is at pos32, pos22, pos23, pos24, and finally pos34. It's not at pos44 at any point. Let's adjust our plan:
    - After step 12, from pos21, the player moves down to pos22, down to pos23, down to pos24, right to pos34. The stone is at pos34.
    - From pos34, the player moves right to pos44, down to pos45. This makes "Location pos45 is not clear" true.

Let's check if this plan satisfies all constraints:
1. "Location pos34 is not clear" is true at step 10. ✓
2. "Location pos21 is not clear" is true at step 12, which is after step 10. ✓
3. "Location pos53 is not clear" is true at step 4. ✓
4. "Location pos22 is not clear" is true at step 2, which is before step 4. ✓
5. "Location pos13 is not clear" is true at step 3. ✓
6. "Location pos52 is not clear" is true only in the sequence of step 5. ✓
7. "Location pos32 is not clear" is true at steps 6-7. ✓
8. "Location pos54 is not clear" is true at the initial state, which is before steps 6-7. ✓
9. "Location pos41 is not clear" is true only in the sequence of steps 5-6. ✓
10. "player1 is not at location pos33" is true in every state. We've been careful to avoid pos33. ✓
11. "player1 is at location pos41" is true at step 5. ✓
12. "Location pos45 is not clear" is true at step 13, which is after step 5. ✓
13. "Location pos32 is not clear" is true only in the sequence of steps 6-7. ✓
14. "player1 is at location pos21" is true at step 12. ✓

Great! Our plan now satisfies all the constraints. Let's formalize the actions in the plan:

1. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft
2. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
3. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
4. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
5. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
6. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft
7. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
8. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
9. move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright
10. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
11. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
12. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
13. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
14. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
15. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright
16. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
17. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
18. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup
19. move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup
20. move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft
21. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos32 dirup
22. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft
23. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos23 dirdown
24. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown
25. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos34 dirright
26. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
27. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
28. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
29. move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown
30. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
31. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
32. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
33. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
34. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown

This is a valid plan that satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal of moving the stone to a goal location (pos34).

Upon closer inspection, I see that I made a mistake in steps 21-24. Let me rectify it:

21. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos32 dirup

After this, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32.

22. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirup

But the stone is at pos32, so the player can't move there. Let's adjust:

22. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
23. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft

But the player can't be at pos33 due to constraint 10. Let's try a different path:

22. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
23. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
24. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
25. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
26. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
27. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
28. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright
29. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos22 dirleft
30. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos23 dirdown
31. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown
32. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos34 dirright

Now, the player is at pos24 and the stone is at pos34 (a goal location).

Let's complete the plan:

33. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
34. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
35. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
36. move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown
37. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
38. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
39. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
40. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
41. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown

This is a valid plan that satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal of moving the stone to a goal location (pos34).

Let me double-check the push actions to make sure I'm using the right preconditions:

For `pushtonongoal`:
1. The agent is at a location adjacent to the stone, in the opposite direction of the push.
2. The stone is at its current location.
3. The destination location is clear.
4. The destination is not a goal location.

For `pushtogoal`:
1. The agent is at a location adjacent to the stone, in the opposite direction of the push.
2. The stone is at its current location.
3. The destination location is clear.
4. The destination is a goal location.

Let's make sure the push actions in our plan meet these preconditions:

29. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos22 dirleft

Player is at pos22, stone is at pos32, destination is pos22. This doesn't make sense, as the stone can't be pushed to a location already occupied by the player. Let me revise.

29. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos22 dirleft:
- The player is at pos22.
- The stone is at pos32.
- The destination is pos22.

This isn't correct because the destination (pos22) is not clear (the player is there). I'm confusing myself. Let me try again.

If the player is at pos22 and the stone is at pos32, the push would be from pos32 to the left (pos22). But the player is already at pos22, so this doesn't work.

Let's adjust our path:

28. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
29. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
30. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown
31. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown

Wait, we don't want the stone at pos33 because the player can never be at pos33 due to constraint 10.

Let's try a different approach:

28. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
29. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
    - But the player can't be at pos33 due to constraint 10.

Let's revise our plan more carefully:

If the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32, let's push the stone from pos32 to the right (pos42):

22. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos42 dirright

Now the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos42. But that means we just pushed the stone back to its original position, which doesn't help.

Let's go back to step 21:
21. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos32 dirup

After this, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32. The player needs to be in position to push the stone further. Let's try:

22. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
23. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
24. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown

Now, the player is at pos32 and the stone is also at pos32. This doesn't make sense.

Let's say after step 21, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32. From pos42, the player can move left to pos32, which is where the stone is, which doesn't make sense again.

Let me revisit the pushtonongoal action. The parameters for this action are:
"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to non-goal location l_to, following direction d.

And the preconditions for this action are:
"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is not a goal location.

So, the player is at location l_p, the stone is at location l_from, and location l_to is the destination for the stone. The player must be able to move from l_p to l_from following direction d, and the stone must be able to move from l_from to l_to following the same direction.

Given this, let's revise our plan:

21. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos32 dirup

In this action, the player is at pos41, the stone is at pos42, and the destination for the stone is pos32. The player moves from pos41 to pos42 following direction dirup, and the stone moves from pos42 to pos32 following the same direction.

After this action:
- The player is at pos42, as indicated by the effect "agent p is at location l_from."
- The stone is at pos32, as indicated by the effect "stone s is at location l_to."

Now, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32.

22. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
23. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
24. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
25. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
26. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
27. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
28. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
29. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
30. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown

Now, the player is at pos32 and the stone is also at pos32. This doesn't make sense. Let me revise again:

After step 21, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32.

22. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
23. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
24. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
25. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
26. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
27. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
28. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
29. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
30. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright

The player is at pos41. The stone is at pos32.

31. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
32. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos32 pos22 dirleft
  - Wait, this doesn't work because the player needs to be at pos41, but currently the player is at pos42.

Let me be more careful with the push actions:
In the pushtonnongoal action, the player is at location l_p, the stone is at location l_from, and location l_to is the destination for the stone. The player must be able to move from l_p to l_from following direction d, and the stone must be able to move from l_from to l_to following the same direction. After this action, the player is at the location where the stone was (l_from).

So, if the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32, to push the stone left to pos22, I would use:
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft

After this, the player would be at pos32 and the stone would be at pos22.

Let's revise the plan from step 21:

21. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos32 dirup

After this:
- The player is at pos42.
- The stone is at pos32.

22. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft

After this:
- The player is at pos32.
- The stone is at pos22.

23. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos23 dirdown

After this:
- The player is at pos22.
- The stone is at pos23.

24. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown

After this:
- The player is at pos23.
- The stone is at pos24.

25. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos34 dirright

After this:
- The player is at pos24.
- The stone is at pos34 (a goal location).

Now, let's complete the plan:

26. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
27. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
28. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup

This satisfies constraint 2, as the player is at pos21 after the stone is at pos34.

29. move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown
30. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
31. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
32. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
33. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
34. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown

This ensures that the constraint "Location pos45 is not clear" is true after the player has been at pos41.

Let me check if this plan satisfies all the constraints:
1. "Location pos34 is not clear" is true at step 25. ✓
2. "Location pos21 is not clear" is true at step 28, which is after step 25. ✓
3. "Location pos53 is not clear" is true at step 15. ✓
4. "Location pos22 is not clear" is true at step 5, which is before step 15. ✓
5. "Location pos13 is not clear" is true at step 7. ✓
6. "Location pos52 is not clear" is true only in the sequence of steps 18-19. ✓
7. "Location pos32 is not clear" is true at steps 21-22. ✓
8. "Location pos54 is not clear" is true at the initial state, which is before steps 21-22. ✓
9. "Location pos41 is not clear" is true only in the sequence of steps 20-21. ✓
10. "player1 is not at location pos33" is true in every state. We've been careful to avoid pos33. ✓
11. "player1 is at location pos41" is true at step 20. ✓
12. "Location pos45 is not clear" is true at step 34, which is after step 20. ✓
13. "Location pos32 is not clear" is true only in the sequence of steps 21-22. ✓
14. "player1 is at location pos21" is true at step 28. ✓

Great! Our plan satisfies all the constraints.
