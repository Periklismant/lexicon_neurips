Let me understand this step by step. We have a grid world problem with the following components:

1. A 5x5 grid where each location is denoted as posXY (where X is the row, Y is the column).
2. A player, player1, initially at position pos13.
3. A stone, stone1, initially at position pos34.
4. A goal location at pos51.
5. Actions to move the player and to push the stone to a goal or non-goal location.

Our objective is to get the stone to a goal location (which is pos51).

Let's visualize the initial state:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1  .  .  P  .  .
2  .  .  .  .  .
3  .  .  .  S  .
4  .  .  .  .  .
5  G  .  .  .  .
```

Here:
- P = player1 at pos13
- S = stone1 at pos34
- G = goal at pos51
- . = empty position (clear)

We need to maneuver the player to push the stone to the goal location. Now, let's consider the constraints:

1. Location pos55 must always be clear. This means we can't push the stone to pos55.
2. Location pos54 can only be non-clear once. So, we can have the stone or the player there at most once.
3. Stone1 must be at pos44 at least once.
4. Before stone1 is at pos44, either player1 must be at pos54 or pos25 must not be clear.
5. At some point, player1 must be at pos21 and pos31 must not be clear. This probably means we need to push the stone to pos31.
6. Location pos52 must always be clear. This means we can't push the stone to pos52.
7. Location pos53 can only be non-clear once.
8. Location pos33 must not be clear at some point. This might mean we push the stone there.
9. Location pos45 must not be clear at some point.
10. Before pos45 is not clear, pos11 must not be clear.
11. Location pos44 can only be non-clear once.
12. Location pos54 must not be clear at some point.
13. Before pos54 is not clear, either pos25 must not be clear or player1 must be at pos45.

These constraints provide a set of conditions our plan must satisfy. Let's think about how to get the stone from pos34 to pos51 while satisfying these constraints.

Let's start by figuring out a path for the stone from its initial position (pos34) to the goal (pos51), keeping the constraints in mind:

A possible path could be:
pos34 -> pos33 (to satisfy constraint 8) -> ... -> pos31 (to satisfy constraint 5) -> ... -> pos44 (to satisfy constraint 3) -> ... -> pos54 (to satisfy constraint 12) -> ... -> pos51 (goal)

But before we push the stone to pos44, we must satisfy constraint 4, which means either player1 must be at pos54 or pos25 must not be clear.

And before we push the stone to pos54, we must satisfy constraint 13, which means either pos25 must not be clear or player1 must be at pos45.

Similarly, before we can push the stone to pos45 (to satisfy constraint 9), we must ensure pos11 is not clear (constraint 10).

OK, I still don't have a clear plan in my head. Let's start by figuring out how to satisfy each constraint and build a plan from there. I'll use the constraints and our objective to derive necessary steps, and then order them into a plan.

First, let's figure out how to get the player to the stone.

From pos13, the player can move to pos14, then to pos24, and then to pos34 to get to the stone.

But before pushing the stone anywhere, we need to consider the constraints.

Constraint 5 says: At some point, player1 must be at pos21 and pos31 must not be clear.

To satisfy this, the stone must be at pos31 at some point. So, we could start by pushing the stone from pos34 to pos33, and then to pos32, and finally to pos31. At this point, the player would be at pos32, so the player needs to move to pos21.

Constraint 8 says: Location pos33 must not be clear at some point. Pushing the stone from pos34 to pos33 would satisfy this.

Constraint 3 says: Stone1 must be at pos44 at least once. But constraint 4 adds a condition: Before stone1 is at pos44, either player1 must be at pos54 or pos25 must not be clear.

To satisfy these, we could:
1. Push the stone from pos31 to pos41.
2. Then, player1 can move to pos45 or to pos25 (satisfying part of constraint 4 or 13).
3. Then, player1 can move to pos54 (satisfying part of constraint 4).
4. Player1 can then get to the right position to push the stone from pos41 to pos42, pos43, and finally to pos44 (satisfying constraint 3).

Constraint 9 says: Location pos45 must not be clear at some point. But constraint 10 adds: Before pos45 is not clear, pos11 must not be clear.

To satisfy this, we would need to:
1. Get the player to pos11 first.
2. Then move the player away, ensuring pos11 is not clear (we might need to push the stone to pos11).
3. Then, either push the stone to pos45 or have the player move to pos45.

Constraint 12 says: Location pos54 must not be clear at some point. In our plan, player1 would be at pos54 to satisfy constraint 4, which would satisfy constraint 12 as well.

Finally, our goal is to get the stone to pos51. We can push the stone from pos44 to pos54, and then to pos51. This would satisfy constraint 12 as well.

After considering all of these, it seems like the path for the stone could be:
pos34 -> pos33 -> pos32 -> pos31 -> pos41 -> pos42 -> pos43 -> pos44 -> pos54 -> pos51

To implement this path, the player needs to navigate correctly, possibly moving to positions such as pos11, pos21, pos25, pos45, and pos54 to satisfy the constraints.

Let's see if I can work out a more detailed plan step by step.

Actually, let's rethink this approach. The given problem is a grid world with actions for the player to move and actions to push the stone. I need to derive a valid plan that meets all constraints.

A more systematic approach would be to first identify mandatory states that must be reached (due to constraints) and then find a path that takes the stone from its initial position to the goal while passing through these mandatory states.

Mandatory states based on the constraints:
1. Stone1 must be at pos44 at some point (Constraint 3).
2. Player1 must be at pos21 and the stone must be at pos31 at some point (Constraint 5).
3. The stone must be at pos33 at some point (Constraint 8).
4. The stone or player1 must be at pos45 at some point (Constraint 9).
5. The stone or player1 must be at pos54 at some point (Constraint 12).

Now, we need to figure out a path for the stone from pos34 to pos51 that goes through these mandatory states. But we also need to satisfy the ordering constraints, for example, before the stone is at pos44, player1 must be at pos54 or pos25 must not be clear.

Looking it over, I'm not sure I can derive a plan that will satisfy all of the constraints. Let me focus on the main task, which is getting the stone to the goal location.

The stone starts at pos34 and the goal is at pos51.

Let me think logically about how to push the stone to the goal:

1. The player needs to be on the opposite side of the stone to push it. So, to push the stone from pos34 to pos33, the player needs to be at pos35.
2. To get to pos35, the player can move from pos13 to pos14, pos15, pos25, and finally to pos35.
3. Then, the player can push the stone from pos34 to pos33.
4. To push the stone from pos33 to pos32, the player needs to be at pos34. The player is currently at pos33 after pushing the stone, so the player needs to move to pos34.
5. Then, the player can push the stone from pos33 to pos32.
6. Similarly, the player can push the stone to pos31, pos41, and finally to pos51, which is the goal.

OK, to be clear, I want to trace out a complete plan. Let's denote the positions using a clearer notation. The positions are labeled as (row, column), so pos13 means (1, 3). Here's a clearer visualization:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1  .  .  P  .  .
2  .  .  .  .  .
3  .  .  .  S  .
4  .  .  .  .  .
5  G  .  .  .  .
```

Where:
- P = player1 at (1, 3) or pos13
- S = stone1 at (3, 4) or pos34
- G = goal at (5, 1) or pos51
- . = empty position (clear)

So, the player starts at (1, 3) and the stone is at (3, 4). The goal is at (5, 1).

For the player to push the stone:
- To push the stone left, the player needs to be to the right of the stone.
- To push the stone right, the player needs to be to the left of the stone.
- To push the stone up, the player needs to be below the stone.
- To push the stone down, the player needs to be above the stone.

I'll trace step-by-step the actions the player can take to push the stone to the goal.

Wait, let me check if my understanding of the directions is correct:
- dirdown: Moving from (x, y) to (x, y+1)
- dirup: Moving from (x, y) to (x, y-1)
- dirright: Moving from (x, y) to (x+1, y)
- dirleft: Moving from (x, y) to (x-1, y)

Looking at the list of moves, for instance:
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

pos11 is (1, 1) and pos21 is (2, 1), so moving from (1, 1) to (2, 1) is "dirright", which increases the row.
pos11 is (1, 1) and pos12 is (1, 2), so moving from (1, 1) to (1, 2) is "dirdown", which increases the column.

OK, so updated:
- dirdown: Moving from (row, col) to (row, col+1), which increases the column.
- dirup: Moving from (row, col) to (row, col-1), which decreases the column.
- dirright: Moving from (row, col) to (row+1, col), which increases the row.
- dirleft: Moving from (row, col) to (row-1, col), which decreases the row.

Now, let's plan the moves for the player to push the stone to the goal.

Starting from:
- player1 at (1, 3) or pos13
- stone1 at (3, 4) or pos34
- goal at (5, 1) or pos51

But let's not think about whether the plan satisfies all constraints for now.

The player needs to get to a position that allows them to push the stone. To push the stone from (3, 4) to a different position, the player needs to be:
- At (2, 4) to push the stone down.
- At (4, 4) to push the stone up.
- At (3, 5) to push the stone left.
- At (3, 3) to push the stone right.

The player is already at (1, 3), so let's compute a path to (3, 3) to push the stone to the right. The player can move:
1. From (1, 3) to (1, 4) using action: move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
2. From (1, 4) to (2, 4) using action: move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
3. From (2, 4) to (3, 4) using action: move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
...

But hold on, the stone is at (3, 4). The player can't move to a non-clear position.

This is wrong. I think I'm messing up the positions. Let me revisit the grid.

Given:
"player1 is at location pos13"
"stone1 is at location pos34"

Let's denote posXY as (X, Y). This seems more consistent with the moves, where:
- dirdown implies moving from (X, Y) to (X+1, Y)
- dirup implies moving from (X, Y) to (X-1, Y)
- dirright implies moving from (X, Y) to (X, Y+1)
- dirleft implies moving from (X, Y) to (X, Y-1)

Looking at a move:
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
pos11 (1, 1) to pos21 (2, 1) is indeed moving right.

And:
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"
pos11 (1, 1) to pos12 (1, 2) is indeed moving down.

So, posXY means (X, Y). With this understanding:
- player1 is at (1, 3) or pos13
- stone1 is at (3, 4) or pos34
- goal is at (5, 1) or pos51

OK, now let's visualize the grid:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1  .  .  P  .  .
2  .  .  .  .  .
3  .  .  .  S  .
4  .  .  .  .  .
5  G  .  .  .  .
```

So I was right in my first visualization. Let's revisit the directions:
- dirdown: Moving from (row, col) to (row+1, col), which increases the row.
- dirup: Moving from (row, col) to (row-1, col), which decreases the row.
- dirright: Moving from (row, col) to (row, col+1), which increases the column.
- dirleft: Moving from (row, col) to (row, col-1), which decreases the column.

Now, let's plan the moves for the player to push the stone to the goal.

The player needs to get to a position that allows them to push the stone. To push the stone from (3, 4) to a different position, the player needs to be:
- At (2, 4) to push the stone down.
- At (4, 4) to push the stone up.
- At (3, 5) to push the stone left.
- At (3, 3) to push the stone right.

Let's aim to push the stone in a general path from (3, 4) to (5, 1). The player is already at (1, 3), so let's compute a path to get the player to a position to start pushing the stone.

Wait, I'm still confused about the directions. Let's verify by looking at the moves:
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

posXY is (X, Y). 
pos11 is (1, 1).
pos21 is (2, 1). 
pos12 is (1, 2).

So, from (1, 1) to (2, 1) is "dirright", which increases the first component (X).
From (1, 1) to (1, 2) is "dirdown", which increases the second component (Y).

OK, let's redefine:
- dirdown: Moving from (X, Y) to (X, Y+1), which increases the second component (Y).
- dirup: Moving from (X, Y) to (X, Y-1), which decreases the second component (Y).
- dirright: Moving from (X, Y) to (X+1, Y), which increases the first component (X).
- dirleft: Moving from (X, Y) to (X-1, Y), which decreases the first component (X).

With this understanding, the grid should be:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1  .  .  P  .  .
2  .  .  .  .  .
3  .  .  .  S  .
4  .  .  .  .  .
5  G  .  .  .  .
```

OK, here's my understanding of the states (I think I was right originally anyways):
- player1 is at pos13, which is (1, 3).
- stone1 is at pos34, which is (3, 4).
- goal location is pos51, which is (5, 1).

The directions are:
- dirdown: Moving from (X, Y) to (X+1, Y).
- dirup: Moving from (X, Y) to (X-1, Y).
- dirright: Moving from (X, Y) to (X, Y+1).
- dirleft: Moving from (X, Y) to (X, Y-1).

Let's verify from the given list of moves:
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
If pos11 is (1, 1) and pos21 is (2, 1), then this would be dirdown by my definition.

Wait a second. I think posXY might be (Y, X) instead of (X, Y)!

Let me check: If pos11 is (1, 1) and pos21 is (2, 1), and the move is "dirright", then dirright is moving from (X, Y) to (X+1, Y). This is consistent.

Similarly, if pos11 is (1, 1) and pos12 is (1, 2), and the move is "dirdown", then dirdown is moving from (X, Y) to (X, Y+1). This is also consistent.

So, the positions posXY are (X, Y) and the directions are as I defined. Let's visualize the grid using (X, Y) as the representation:

```
     1   2   3   4   5
1    .   .   P   .   .
2    .   .   .   .   .
3    .   .   .   S   .
4    .   .   .   .   .
5    G   .   .   .   .
```

Where:
- P = player1 at (1, 3) or pos13
- S = stone1 at (3, 4) or pos34
- G = goal at (5, 1) or pos51
- . = empty position (clear)

And the directions are:
- dirdown: Moving from (X, Y) to (X+1, Y), which increases X.
- dirup: Moving from (X, Y) to (X-1, Y), which decreases X.
- dirright: Moving from (X, Y) to (X, Y+1), which increases Y.
- dirleft: Moving from (X, Y) to (X, Y-1), which decreases Y.

Let's create a simple plan from where we are:
1. Get the player to a position to push the stone.
2. Push the stone towards the goal.

The player is at (1, 3) and the stone is at (3, 4). To push the stone left, the player needs to be at (3, 5). Let me calculate the moves to get the player to (3, 5):
1. From (1, 3) to (2, 3): move player1 pos13 pos23 dirdown
2. From (2, 3) to (3, 3): move player1 pos23 pos33 dirdown
3. From (3, 3) to (3, 4): move player1 pos33 pos34 dirright
4. From (3, 4) to (3, 5): move player1 pos34 pos35 dirright

Wait, I can't move from (3, 3) to (3, 4) because stone1 is at (3, 4). 

Let's revisit. To push the stone left (towards the goal) from (3, 4), the player needs to be at (3, 5). To get to (3, 5), the player can go:
1. From (1, 3) to (1, 4): move player1 pos13 pos14 dirright
2. From (1, 4) to (1, 5): move player1 pos14 pos15 dirright
3. From (1, 5) to (2, 5): move player1 pos15 pos25 dirdown
4. From (2, 5) to (3, 5): move player1 pos25 pos35 dirdown

Now, from (3, 5), the player can push the stone left from (3, 4) to (3, 3):
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirleft

With the stone now at (3, 3) and the player at (3, 4), the player can push the stone to (3, 2):
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos32 dirleft

The stone is now at (3, 2) and the player is at (3, 3). The player can push the stone to (3, 1):
7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirleft

The stone is now at (3, 1) and the player is at (3, 2). To move the stone towards the goal, the player will push it down to (4, 1), and then to (5, 1).

8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos31 pos41 dirdown
The stone is now at (4, 1) and the player is at (3, 1).

9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos41 pos51 dirdown
The stone is now at (5, 1) (the goal) and the player is at (4, 1).

This sequence completes our basic plan to get the stone to the goal, without considering the constraints. Let's check if our plan satisfies the constraints:

Constraint 1: Location pos55 must always be clear. Our plan doesn't involve pos55, so this is fine.
Constraint 2: Location pos54 can only be non-clear once. Our plan doesn't involve pos54, so this is fine.
Constraint 3: Stone1 must be at pos44 at least once. Our plan doesn't have the stone at pos44, so we need to adjust.
Constraint 4: Before stone1 is at pos44, either player1 must be at pos54 or pos25 must not be clear. Since our plan doesn't have the stone at pos44, this is not a problem yet.
Constraint 5: At some point, player1 must be at pos21 and pos31 must not be clear. Our plan doesn't have this state, so we need to adjust.
Constraint 6: Location pos52 must always be clear. Our plan doesn't involve pos52, so this is fine.
Constraint 7: Location pos53 can only be non-clear once. Our plan doesn't involve pos53, so this is fine.
Constraint 8: Location pos33 must not be clear at some point. Our plan does have the stone at pos33, so this constraint is met.
Constraint 9: Location pos45 must not be clear at some point. Our plan doesn't involve pos45, so we need to adjust.
Constraint 10: Before pos45 is not clear, pos11 must not be clear. Since our plan doesn't involve pos45 (yet), this is not a problem yet.
Constraint 11: Location pos44 can only be non-clear once. Our plan doesn't involve pos44, so this is fine.
Constraint 12: Location pos54 must not be clear at some point. Our plan doesn't involve pos54, so we need to adjust.
Constraint 13: Before pos54 is not clear, either pos25 must not be clear or player1 must be at pos45. Since our plan doesn't involve pos54 (yet), this is not a problem yet.

So, we need to adjust our plan to address constraints 3, 5, 9, and 12.

Let's see. If we want the stone to be at pos44 at some point, we'll deviate from our previous path. And we also need to make sure the player and stone satisfy the other constraints.

Let me think of a new plan that addresses all constraints:

Constraint 5 says: At some point, player1 must be at pos21 and pos31 must not be clear. This suggests we need to have the stone at pos31.

A path for the stone could be:
pos34 -> pos33 -> pos32 -> pos31 (to satisfy constraint 5) -> pos41 (moving towards the goal) -> pos42 -> pos43 -> pos44 (to satisfy constraint 3) -> pos34 (going back) -> pos33 -> pos32 -> pos31 -> pos41 -> pos51 (goal)

But this seems overly complicated, and we also need to address constraints 9 and 12.

Let's be more systematic. The stone needs to be at pos31 and pos44 at certain points, and pos45 and pos54 also need to be non-clear at certain points. Let's try to plot a path that covers these:

pos34 (start) -> pos33 -> pos32 -> pos31 (to satisfy constraint 5) -> pos41 -> pos42 -> pos43 -> pos44 (to satisfy constraint 3) -> pos45 (to satisfy constraint 9) -> pos44 -> pos54 (to satisfy constraint 12) -> pos53 -> pos52 -> pos51 (goal)

Hang on, I need to remember the constraint that pos52 must always be clear. Adjusting:

pos34 (start) -> pos33 -> pos32 -> pos31 (to satisfy constraint 5) -> pos41 -> pos42 -> pos43 -> pos44 (to satisfy constraint 3) -> pos45 (to satisfy constraint 9) -> pos44 -> pos54 (to satisfy constraint 12) -> pos53 -> pos43 -> ... -> pos41 -> pos51 (goal)

I think I'm getting a bit too complex here. Let me backtrack and address the constraints I am missing, one by one.

Constraint 3: Stone1 must be at pos44 at least once. Let's adjust our plan to push the stone to pos44 before directing it to the goal.

Let's go back to where the stone is at (3, 4) and the player is at (1, 3). If we want to push the stone to (4, 4), the player must be at (2, 4). With all the constraints, a cleaner approach might be to break this down into objectives:

1. Get the stone from (3, 4) to (3, 1) (first push it left).
2. Then, get the stone to (5, 1) (push it down to the goal).

Let's start with the first objective, starting from the initial state:
- player1 is at (1, 3) or pos13
- stone1 is at (3, 4) or pos34

To push the stone left from (3, 4) to (3, 3), the player needs to be at (3, 5). Player can move:
1. From (1, 3) to (1, 4): move player1 pos13 pos14 dirright
2. From (1, 4) to (1, 5): move player1 pos14 pos15 dirright
3. From (1, 5) to (2, 5): move player1 pos15 pos25 dirdown
4. From (2, 5) to (3, 5): move player1 pos25 pos35 dirdown
5. Push the stone left from (3, 4) to (3, 3): pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirleft

Now the stone is at (3, 3) and the player is at (3, 4). The player can push the stone to (3, 2) and then to (3, 1):
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos32 dirleft
7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirleft

Now, the stone is at (3, 1) and the player is at (3, 2). Constraint 5 says: At some point, player1 must be at pos21 and pos31 must not be clear. Currently, pos31 is not clear (stone is there), but player1 isn't at pos21. The player can move:
8. From (3, 2) to (2, 2): move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup
9. From (2, 2) to (2, 1): move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft

At this point, player1 is at pos21 and pos31 is not clear, satisfying constraint 5.

Next, let's push the stone to (4, 1), and then to (4, 2), (4, 3), and finally to (4, 4) to satisfy constraint 3. The player needs to be at (2, 1) to push the stone down from (3, 1) to (4, 1):
10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos31 pos41 dirdown

Now the stone is at (4, 1) and the player is at (3, 1). The player can push the stone to (4, 2):
11. From (3, 1) to (3, 2): move player1 pos31 pos32 dirright
12. From (3, 2) to (4, 2): move player1 pos32 pos42 dirdown
13. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos41 pos42 dirright

Hmm, there's an issue here. The player pushes the stone from (4, 1) to (4, 2), which means the stone is at (4, 1), the player is at (4, 1), and the push is towards (4, 2). But I've described that the player is at (4, 2). Actually, to push the stone from (4, 1) to (4, 2), the player needs to be at (4, 0), which doesn't exist in our 5x5 grid.

Hmm, this is challenging. Let's rethink our strategy. 

Actually, hang on. To push the stone from (4, 1) to (4, 2), the player needs to be at (4, 0), which doesn't exist in our grid. So, we can't directly push the stone from (4, 1) to (4, 2).

We might need to consider a different path for the stone:
(3, 4) -> (3, 3) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 1) -> (4, 1) -> (5, 1) (which is the goal)

But such a path doesn't get the stone to (4, 4) to satisfy constraint 3. OK, I don't have a plan in mind still. 

ACtually, let me try a different approach:
1. Push the stone from (3, 4) to (3, 3).
2. Then up to (2, 3), then to (2, 4), then to (3, 4) again, but from here we can possibly push it to (4, 4), which is pos44.
3. Then back to (3, 4) somehow.
4. Then to (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1) (goal).

Wait, I think I'm overthinking this. Let me try to solve step-by-step.

Given the constraints, we need to:
1. Have the stone at (3, 1) at some point, with the player at (2, 1).
2. Have the stone at (4, 4) at some point.
3. Have pos45 not clear at some point.
4. Have pos54 not clear at some point.

Let's design a path for the stone that visits all these positions:
(3, 4) -> (3, 3) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 1) (player at (2, 1)) -> (4, 1) -> (4, 2) -> (4, 3) -> (4, 4) (satisfying constraint 3) -> (4, 5) (satisfying constraint 9) -> (5, 4) (satisfying constraint 12) -> (5, 3) -> (5, 2) -> (5, 1) (goal)

However, I realize I'm getting too complex and there might be issues with this path due to the grid. I need to be more systematic.

OK, let me try to be more direct in planning.

Initial state:
- player1 is at (1, 3) or pos13
- stone1 is at (3, 4) or pos34

Thinking step-by-step, I'll start by addressing the mandatory positions and see if they can be reached from the initial state:

1. Constraint 5: At some point, player1 must be at pos21 and pos31 must not be clear. This means the stone must be at (3, 1).
2. Constraint 3: Stone1 must be at pos44 at least once. This means the stone must be at (4, 4).
3. Constraint 9: Location pos45 must not be clear at some point. This can be the player or the stone.
4. Constraint 12: Location pos54 must not be clear at some point. This can be the player or the stone.

Let's push the stone from (3, 4) to (3, 3), to (3, 2), and to (3, 1), making sure the player is at (2, 1) afterward:

1. From (1, 3) to (1, 4): move player1 pos13 pos14 dirright
2. From (1, 4) to (1, 5): move player1 pos14 pos15 dirright
3. From (1, 5) to (2, 5): move player1 pos15 pos25 dirdown
4. From (2, 5) to (3, 5): move player1 pos25 pos35 dirdown
5. Push stone1 from (3, 4) to (3, 3): pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirleft
6. Push stone1 from (3, 3) to (3, 2): pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos32 dirleft
7. Push stone1 from (3, 2) to (3, 1): pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirleft
8. From (3, 2) to (2, 2): move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup
9. From (2, 2) to (2, 1): move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft

At this point, player1 is at (2, 1) or pos21, and stone1 is at (3, 1) or pos31, satisfying constraint 5.

Next, let's move stone1 to pos44 to satisfy constraint 3. From (3, 1) to (4, 4) is a long distance, but we can trace the path step by step.

10. Push stone1 from (3, 1) to (4, 1): pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos31 pos41 dirdown
Now, stone1 is at (4, 1) and player1 is at (3, 1).

11. From (3, 1) to (3, 2): move player1 pos31 pos32 dirright
12. From (3, 2) to (3, 3): move player1 pos32 pos33 dirright
13. From (3, 3) to (3, 4): move player1 pos33 pos34 dirright
14. From (3, 4) to (4, 4): move player1 pos34 pos44 dirdown
15. From (4, 4) to (5, 4): move player1 pos44 pos54 dirdown
16. From (5, 4) to (5, 3): move player1 pos54 pos53 dirleft
17. From (5, 3) to (5, 2): move player1 pos53 pos52 dirleft
18. From (5, 2) to (4, 2): move player1 pos52 pos42 dirup
19. Push stone1 from (4, 1) to (4, 2): pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos41 pos42 dirright

Now, stone1 is at (4, 2) and player1 is at (4, 1).

20. From (4, 1) to (4, 0): This doesn't exist in our grid. I made a mistake in my planning. Let's take a different approach.

For stone1 to get to (4, 4) from (3, 1), we can push it down to (4, 1), then push it to the right to (4, 2), (4, 3), and finally to (4, 4).

Resetting from step 10:
10. Push stone1 from (3, 1) to (4, 1): pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos31 pos41 dirdown
Now, stone1 is at (4, 1) and player1 is at (3, 1).

11. From (3, 1) to (3, 2): move player1 pos31 pos32 dirright
12. From (3, 2) to (4, 2): move player1 pos32 pos42 dirdown
13. Push stone1 from (4, 1) to (4, 2): pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos41 pos42 dirright

Now, stone1 is at (4, 2) and player1 is at (4, 1).

14. From (4, 1) to (4, 0): This doesn't exist. I made another error.

This isn't working because the player doesn't have a clear path to push the stone from (4, 1) to (4, 2), etc., without pushing it from a position that's off the grid. I'm not reasoning the pushes correctly. Let's try another direction.

It seems like I'm getting confused. Let me revisit the rules for pushing a stone:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.
"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to non-goal location l_to, following direction d.

The preconditions include:
(i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.

OK, so the player is pushing the stone without being directly "behind" it. They're pushing from an adjacent position. 

Let me reconsider the pushing mechanics. The player pushes the stone from a neighboring position. So, for the player to push the stone from (3, 4) to (3, 3), the player could be at (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 4), or (3, 3) (if we're going by adjacency). But from the preconditions, the player needs to be at a position such that you can get from the player's position to the stone's position following a certain direction, and from the stone's position to the target position following the same direction.

Given this, from the player's starting position at (1, 3) and the stone's at (3, 4), let's work out the actions to get the stone to the mandatory positions.

We want to get the stone to (3, 1), with the player at (2, 1) at the same time, to satisfy constraint 5. If the player is at (1, 3) and the stone is at (3, 4), a possible path for the player to get to (2, 1) (pos21) is:
1. From (1, 3) to (2, 3): move player1 pos13 pos23 dirdown
2. From (2, 3) to (2, 2): move player1 pos23 pos22 dirleft
3. From (2, 2) to (2, 1): move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft

Now the player is at (2, 1) (pos21), but the stone is still at (3, 4) (pos34), not at (3, 1) (pos31) as required by constraint 5. The player needs to move the stone. But the player is far from the stone. Let's get the player to a position to push the stone:

4. From (2, 1) to (2, 2): move player1 pos21 pos22 dirright
5. From (2, 2) to (2, 3): move player1 pos22 pos23 dirright
6. From (2, 3) to (2, 4): move player1 pos23 pos24 dirright
7. From (2, 4) to (3, 4): move player1 pos24 pos34 dirdown

Oh, I made an error. pos34 is where the stone is, so the player can't move there. Let's redo this.

Let's push the stone from (3, 4) to (3, 3) using the action:
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 l_p l_from l_to d

Where:
- player1 is at location l_p
- stone1 is at location l_from (which is pos34 or (3, 4))
- l_to is the destination (which is pos33 or (3, 3))
- d is the direction

Given the preconditions, the player needs to be at a position such that the player can get to (3, 4) (stone's position) following direction d, and from (3, 4) to (3, 3) follows the same direction d. 

If the direction d is dirleft, then the player should be at a position such that moving left from the player's position gets to (3, 4). This would be (3, 5). So, the player should be at (3, 5) or pos35.

How can the player get from (1, 3) to (3, 5)? Here's a path:
1. From (1, 3) to (2, 3): move player1 pos13 pos23 dirdown
2. From (2, 3) to (3, 3): move player1 pos23 pos33 dirdown
3. From (3, 3) to (3, 4): move player1 pos33 pos34 dirright
4. From (3, 4) to (3, 5): move player1 pos34 pos35 dirright

But wait, step 3 is wrong because the player can't move to (3, 4) since the stone is there! Let's try a different path.

From (1, 3) to (3, 5):
1. From (1, 3) to (1, 4): move player1 pos13 pos14 dirright
2. From (1, 4) to (1, 5): move player1 pos14 pos15 dirright
3. From (1, 5) to (2, 5): move player1 pos15 pos25 dirdown
4. From (2, 5) to (3, 5): move player1 pos25 pos35 dirdown

Now, push the stone from (3, 4) to (3, 3):
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirleft

Wait, let's verify this action. The operation is:
"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to non-goal location l_to, following direction d.

Preconditions:
(i) agent p is at location l_p
(ii) stone s is at location l_from
(iii) location l_to is clear
(iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d
(v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d
(vi) location l_to is not a goal location

I'm thinking of:
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirleft

Let's check the preconditions:
(i) player1 is at location pos35 (yes, after step 4)
(ii) stone1 is at location pos34 (yes, initially)
(iii) location pos33 is clear (yes, initially)
(iv) you can get from location pos35 to location pos34 following direction dirleft (yes, (3, 5) to (3, 4) is moving left)
(v) you can get from location pos34 to location pos33 following direction dirleft (yes, (3, 4) to (3, 3) is moving left)
(vi) location pos33 is not a goal location (yes, only pos51 is a goal location)

So, this push is valid. After this action, stone1 will be at pos33, player1 will be at pos34, and pos35 will be clear.

Now, the player can push the stone from (3, 3) to (3, 2):
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos32 dirleft

After this, stone1 will be at pos32, player1 will be at pos33, and pos34 will be clear.

Then, push the stone from (3, 2) to (3, 1):
7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirleft

Now, stone1 is at (3, 1) or pos31, and player1 is at (3, 2) or pos32. But we want player1 to be at (2, 1) or pos21 and stone1 to be at (3, 1) or pos31 to satisfy constraint 5. The player can move:

8. From (3, 2) to (2, 2): move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup
9. From (2, 2) to (2, 1): move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft

Great! Now player1 is at (2, 1) or pos21 and stone1 is at (3, 1) or pos31, satisfying constraint 5.

Next, let's try to get stone1 to (4, 4) or pos44 to satisfy constraint 3. But constraint 4 says that before stone1 is at pos44, either player1 must be at pos54 or pos25 must not be clear. Let's set up this prerequisite first.

Currently, player1 is at (2, 1) or pos21 and stone1 is at (3, 1) or pos31. Let's get player1 to (5, 4) or pos54:

10. From (2, 1) to (2, 2): move player1 pos21 pos22 dirright
11. From (2, 2) to (2, 3): move player1 pos22 pos23 dirright
12. From (2, 3) to (2, 4): move player1 pos23 pos24 dirright
13. From (2, 4) to (2, 5): move player1 pos24 pos25 dirright
14. From (2, 5) to (3, 5): move player1 pos25 pos35 dirdown
15. From (3, 5) to (4, 5): move player1 pos35 pos45 dirdown
16. From (4, 5) to (5, 5): move player1 pos45 pos55 dirdown

Wait, I need to be careful about constraint 1, which states that location pos55 is must always be clear. So, the player can't be at (5, 5) or pos55.

OK, let's try a different approach. From (2, 1), the player can move:
10. From (2, 1) to (3, 1): move player1 pos21 pos31 dirdown

Wait, this doesn't work because the stone is at (3, 1) or pos31.

Let's try:
10. From (2, 1) to (2, 2): move player1 pos21 pos22 dirright
11. From (2, 2) to (3, 2): move player1 pos22 pos32 dirdown
12. From (3, 2) to (4, 2): move player1 pos32 pos42 dirdown
13. From (4, 2) to (5, 2): move player1 pos42 pos52 dirdown
14. From (5, 2) to (5, 3): move player1 pos52 pos53 dirright
15. From (5, 3) to (5, 4): move player1 pos53 pos54 dirright

Now, player1 is at (5, 4) or pos54, satisfying the prerequisite for constraint 4. Additionally, location (5, 4) or pos54 is not clear, satisfying constraint 12.

Now, we need to get the stone from (3, 1) or pos31 to (4, 4) or pos44. But first, we need to move the player to a position where they can start pushing the stone.

16. From (5, 4) to (5, 3): move player1 pos54 pos53 dirleft
17. From (5, 3) to (5, 2): move player1 pos53 pos52 dirleft
18. From (5, 2) to (4, 2): move player1 pos52 pos42 dirup
19. From (4, 2) to (3, 2): move player1 pos42 pos32 dirup
20. From (3, 2) to (2, 2): move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup
21. From (2, 2) to (2, 1): move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft

Now, player1 is at (2, 1) or pos21, and stone1 is at (3, 1) or pos31. The player can push the stone down to (4, 1) or pos41:

22. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos31 pos41 dirdown

After this, stone1 is at (4, 1) or pos41, and player1 is at (3, 1) or pos31.

Hmm, would it be easier to have the stone go to pos44 via pushing it up? Let's actually follow a more efficient plan than my previous steps:

1. From (1, 3) to (1, 4): move player1 pos13 pos14 dirright
2. From (1, 4) to (1, 5): move player1 pos14 pos15 dirright
3. From (1, 5) to (2, 5): move player1 pos15 pos25 dirdown
4. From (2, 5) to (3, 5): move player1 pos25 pos35 dirdown
5. Push the stone from (3, 4) to (3, 3): pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirleft
6. From (3, 4) to (2, 4): move player1 pos34 pos24 dirup
7. From (2, 4) to (1, 4): move player1 pos24 pos14 dirup
8. From (1, 4) to (1, 3): move player1 pos14 pos13 dirleft
9. From (1, 3) to (2, 3): move player1 pos13 pos23 dirdown
10. Push the stone from (3, 3) to (2, 3): pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos23 dirup

After step 10, stone1 is at (2, 3) or pos23, and player1 is at (3, 3) or pos33.

11. From (3, 3) to (3, 4): move player1 pos33 pos34 dirright
12. From (3, 4) to (2, 4): move player1 pos34 pos24 dirup
13. Push the stone from (2, 3) to (2, 4): pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos24 dirright

After step 13, stone1 is at (2, 4) or pos24, and player1 is at (2, 3) or pos23.

14. From (2, 3) to (1, 3): move player1 pos23 pos13 dirup
15. From (1, 3) to (1, 4): move player1 pos13 pos14 dirright
16. From (1, 4) to (2, 4): move player1 pos14 pos24 dirdown

Wait, this is wrong because pos24 is where the stone is. Let's try another approach.

Let me focus on the mandatory positions a bit more systematically.

1. We need to have the stone at pos31, with the player at pos21 (constraint 5).
2. We need to have the stone at pos44 (constraint 3), but before that, either pos25 must not be clear or player1 must be at pos54 (constraint 4).
3. We need to have pos45 not clear (constraint 9), but before that, pos11 must not be clear (constraint 10).
4. We need to have pos54 not clear (constraint 12), but before that, either pos25 must not be clear or player1 must be at pos45 (constraint 13).

It's a lot to keep track of, so I'm going to start from the initial state and try to reach a state that satisfies as many constraints as possible, looking at states I can actually achieve.

Initial state:
- player1 is at (1, 3) or pos13
- stone1 is at (3, 4) or pos34

Let's get the player to (3, 5) to push the stone left:
1. From (1, 3) to (1, 4): move player1 pos13 pos14 dirright
2. From (1, 4) to (1, 5): move player1 pos14 pos15 dirright
3. From (1, 5) to (2, 5): move player1 pos15 pos25 dirdown
4. From (2, 5) to (3, 5): move player1 pos25 pos35 dirdown

Now, player1 is at (3, 5) or pos35, and stone1 is at (3, 4) or pos34. Player1 can push the stone to (3, 3):
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirleft

After this, stone1 is at (3, 3) or pos33, and player1 is at (3, 4) or pos34. This satisfies constraint 8, which requires pos33 to not be clear at some point.

Let's continue. The player can move around and push the stone to pos32:
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos32 dirleft

After this, stone1 is at (3, 2) or pos32, and player1 is at (3, 3) or pos33.

The player can push the stone to pos31:
7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirleft

After this, stone1 is at (3, 1) or pos31, and player1 is at (3, 2) or pos32.

To satisfy constraint 5, we need the player to be at (2, 1) or pos21 while the stone is at (3, 1) or pos31. The player can move:
8. From (3, 2) to (2, 2): move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup
9. From (2, 2) to (2, 1): move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft

Now, player1 is at (2, 1) or pos21, and stone1 is at (3, 1) or pos31, satisfying constraint 5.

At some point, we need to have the stone at (4, 4) or pos44 to satisfy constraint 3, but before that, either pos25 must not be clear or player1 must be at pos54.

Let's continue:
10. From (2, 1) to (2, 2): move player1 pos21 pos22 dirright
11. From (2, 2) to (2, 3): move player1 pos22 pos23 dirright
12. From (2, 3) to (2, 4): move player1 pos23 pos24 dirright
13. From (2, 4) to (2, 5): move player1 pos24 pos25 dirright
At this point, player1 is at (2, 5) or pos25, and stone1 is at (3, 1) or pos31.

By being at pos25, player1 makes pos25 not clear, which sets up the prerequisite for later having the stone at pos44 (constraint 4).

OK, now player1 can keep moving:
14. From (2, 5) to (3, 5): move player1 pos25 pos35 dirdown
15. From (3, 5) to (4, 5): move player1 pos35 pos45 dirdown

Now, player1 is at (4, 5) or pos45, and stone1 is at (3, 1) or pos31.

By being at pos45, player1 makes pos45 not clear, satisfying constraint 9. But constraint 10 says that before pos45 is not clear, pos11 must not be clear. This means we should have made pos11 not clear before.

I think I'll have to start over. There seems to be a logical sequence of moves dictated by the constraints. Let's reconsider.

Actually, I'm still going to follow the same approach, but be more careful. First, I'll satisfy constraint 10, and then go into the existing plan.

Initial state:
- player1 is at (1, 3) or pos13
- stone1 is at (3, 4) or pos34

Constraint 10 says: Before pos45 is not clear, pos11 must not be clear. Let's start by making pos11 not clear.

1. From (1, 3) to (1, 2): move player1 pos13 pos12 dirleft
2. From (1, 2) to (1, 1): move player1 pos12 pos11 dirleft

Now, player1 is at (1, 1) or pos11, making it not clear.

3. From (1, 1) to (1, 2): move player1 pos11 pos12 dirright
4. From (1, 2) to (1, 3): move player1 pos12 pos13 dirright
5. From (1, 3) to (1, 4): move player1 pos13 pos14 dirright
6. From (1, 4) to (1, 5): move player1 pos14 pos15 dirright
7. From (1, 5) to (2, 5): move player1 pos15 pos25 dirdown
8. From (2, 5) to (3, 5): move player1 pos25 pos35 dirdown

Now, player1 is at (3, 5) or pos35, and stone1 is at (3, 4) or pos34. Player1 can push the stone to (3, 3):
9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirleft

After this, stone1 is at (3, 3) or pos33, and player1 is at (3, 4) or pos34. This satisfies constraint 8, which requires pos33 to not be clear at some point.

Let's continue. The player can move around and push the stone to pos32:
10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos32 dirleft

After this, stone1 is at (3, 2) or pos32, and player1 is at (3, 3) or pos33.

The player can push the stone to pos31:
11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirleft

After this, stone1 is at (3, 1) or pos31, and player1 is at (3, 2) or pos32.

To satisfy constraint 5, we need the player to be at (2, 1) or pos21 while the stone is at (3, 1) or pos31. The player can move:
12. From (3, 2) to (2, 2): move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup
13. From (2, 2) to (2, 1): move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft

Now, player1 is at (2, 1) or pos21, and stone1 is at (3, 1) or pos31, satisfying constraint 5.

Constraint 4 says: Before stone1 is at pos44, either player1 must be at pos54 or pos25 must not be clear. Let's make pos25 not clear:

14. From (2, 1) to (2, 2): move player1 pos21 pos22 dirright
15. From (2, 2) to (2, 3): move player1 pos22 pos23 dirright
16. From (2, 3) to (2, 4): move player1 pos23 pos24 dirright
17. From (2, 4) to (2, 5): move player1 pos24 pos25 dirright

Now, player1 is at (2, 5) or pos25, making it not clear. This sets up the prerequisite for constraint 4.

Constraint 13 says: Before pos54 is not clear, either pos25 must not be clear or player1 must be at pos45. Player1 is already at pos25, making it not clear, which sets up the prerequisite for constraint 13.

Constraints 9 and 10: Location pos45 must not be clear at some point, but before that, pos11 must not be clear. We've already made pos11 not clear in steps 1-2. Now, let's make pos45 not clear:

18. From (2, 5) to (3, 5): move player1 pos25 pos35 dirdown
19. From (3, 5) to (4, 5): move player1 pos35 pos45 dirdown

Now, player1 is at (4, 5) or pos45, making it not clear. This satisfies constraint 9. It also sets up part of the prerequisite for constraint 13 (though, the prerequisite for constraint 13 was already set up by having pos25 not clear).

20. From (4, 5) to (5, 4): move player1 pos45 pos54 dirdown

Now, player1 is at (5, 4) or pos54, making it not clear. This satisfies constraint 12 (pos54 must not be clear at some point) and also sets up the prerequisite for constraint 4.

Now, our goal is to get the stone from (3, 1) or pos31 to (4, 4) or pos44 to satisfy constraint 3. The player needs to get to a position to start pushing the stone. The player is currently at (5, 4) or pos54, and the stone is at (3, 1) or pos31.

21. From (5, 4) to (4, 4): move player1 pos54 pos44 dirup
22. From (4, 4) to (3, 4): move player1 pos44 pos34 dirup
23. From (3, 4) to (3, 3): move player1 pos34 pos33 dirleft
24. From (3, 3) to (3, 2): move player1 pos33 pos32 dirleft
25. From (3, 2) to (2, 2): move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup
26. From (2, 2) to (2, 1): move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft

Now, player1 is at (2, 1) or pos21, and the stone is at (3, 1) or pos31. Let's push the stone:

27. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos31 pos41 dirdown

After this, the stone is at (4, 1) or pos41, and player1 is at (3, 1) or pos31.

28. From (3, 1) to (3, 2): move player1 pos31 pos32 dirright
29. From (3, 2) to (4, 2): move player1 pos32 pos42 dirdown
30. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos41 pos42 dirright

The player is now at (4, 1) or pos41, and the stone is at (4, 2) or pos42.

31. From (4, 1) to (4, 2): move player1 pos41 pos42 dirright
32. From (4, 2) to (4, 3): move player1 pos42 pos43 dirright
33. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos43 dirright

The player is now at (4, 2) or pos42, and the stone is at (4, 3) or pos43.

34. From (4, 2) to (4, 3): move player1 pos42 pos43 dirright
35. From (4, 3) to (4, 4): move player1 pos43 pos44 dirright
36. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos44 dirright

The player is now at (4, 3) or pos43, and the stone is at (4, 4) or pos44. This satisfies constraint 3.

Now, our goal is to get the stone to (5, 1) or pos51, which is the goal location. Let's get the player in position to push the stone:

37. From (4, 3) to (4, 4): move player1 pos43 pos44 dirright
38. From (4, 4) to (3, 4): move player1 pos44 pos34 dirup
39. From (3, 4) to (3, 3): move player1 pos34 pos33 dirleft
40. From (3, 3) to (3, 2): move player1 pos33 pos32 dirleft
41. From (3, 2) to (3, 1): move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft
42. From (3, 1) to (4, 1): move player1 pos31 pos41 dirdown
43. From (4, 1) to (5, 1): move player1 pos41 pos51 dirdown

OK, i messed up. I forgot that pos51 is the goal location. We're we're trying to push the stone to (5, 1), we would use the pushtogoal operation, not pushtonongoal. 

Let's continue from where the stone is at (4, 4) or pos44 and the player is at (4, 3) or pos43. I'll plot a different path to get the stone to (5, 1) or pos51.

37. From (4, 3) to (3, 3): move player1 pos43 pos33 dirup
38. From (3, 3) to (2, 3): move player1 pos33 pos23 dirup
39. From (2, 3) to (1, 3): move player1 pos23 pos13 dirup
40. From (1, 3) to (1, 2): move player1 pos13 pos12 dirleft
41. From (1, 2) to (1, 1): move player1 pos12 pos11 dirleft
42. From (1, 1) to (2, 1): move player1 pos11 pos21 dirdown
43. From (2, 1) to (3, 1): move player1 pos21 pos31 dirdown
44. From (3, 1) to (4, 1): move player1 pos31 pos41 dirdown
45. From (4, 1) to (5, 1): move player1 pos41 pos51 dirdown

Now, player1 is at (5, 1) or pos51, and the stone is at (4, 4) or pos44. We need to get the player to a position to start pushing the stone towards the goal.

46. From (5, 1) to (4, 1): move player1 pos51 pos41 dirup
47. From (4, 1) to (4, 2): move player1 pos41 pos42 dirright
48. From (4, 2) to (4, 3): move player1 pos42 pos43 dirright
49. From (4, 3) to (5, 3): move player1 pos43 pos53 dirdown
50. From (5, 3) to (5, 4): move player1 pos53 pos54 dirright
51. From (5, 4) to (4, 4): move player1 pos54 pos44 dirup

Now, player1 is at (4, 4) or pos44, and the stone is at (4, 4) or pos44. This doesn't work because the player can't be at the same position as the stone. I need to revise.

From step 36, the player is at (4, 3) or pos43, and the stone is at (4, 4) or pos44. To get the stone to (5, 1) or pos51, we'll first push it to (5, 4), then to (5, 3), then to (5, 2), and finally to (5, 1).

37. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirdown

After this, the stone is at (5, 4) or pos54, and player1 is at (4, 4) or pos44.

38. From (4, 4) to (4, 3): move player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft
39. From (4, 3) to (5, 3): move player1 pos43 pos53 dirdown
40. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos53 dirleft

After this, the stone is at (5, 3) or pos53, and player1 is at (5, 4) or pos54.

41. From (5, 4) to (5, 3): move player1 pos54 pos53 dirleft
42. From (5, 3) to (5, 2): move player1 pos53 pos52 dirleft
43. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos53 pos52 dirleft

After this, the stone is at (5, 2) or pos52, and player1 is at (5, 3) or pos53. Oh wait--constraint 6 says that location pos52 must always be clear. This means we can't have the stone at (5, 2) or pos52.

Let's revise. We need a different path to get the stone from (4, 4) or pos44 to (5, 1) or pos51, avoiding (5, 2) or pos52.

37. From (4, 3) to (3, 3): move player1 pos43 pos33 dirup
38. From (3, 3) to (3, 4): move player1 pos33 pos34 dirright
39. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos34 dirup

After this, the stone is at (3, 4) or pos34, and player1 is at (4, 4) or pos44.

40. From (4, 4) to (3, 4): move player1 pos44 pos34 dirup
41. From (3, 4) to (3, 3): move player1 pos34 pos33 dirleft
42. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos33 dirleft

After this, the stone is at (3, 3) or pos33, and player1 is at (3, 4) or pos34.

... (the stone would keep moving left and eventually go down)

Actually, I have a more direct plan. 

From step 36, the player is at (4, 3) or pos43, and the stone is at (4, 4) or pos44. 

37. From (4, 3) to (4, 2): move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft
38. From (4, 2) to (4, 1): move player1 pos42 pos41 dirleft
39. From (4, 1) to (3, 1): move player1 pos41 pos31 dirup
40. From (3, 1) to (2, 1): move player1 pos31 pos21 dirup
41. From (2, 1) to (2, 2): move player1 pos21 pos22 dirright
42. From (2, 2) to (2, 3): move player1 pos22 pos23 dirright
43. From (2, 3) to (2, 4): move player1 pos23 pos24 dirright
44. From (2, 4) to (3, 4): move player1 pos24 pos34 dirdown
45. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos43 dirleft

After this, the stone is at (4, 3) or pos43, and player1 is at (4, 4) or pos44.

46. From (4, 4) to (4, 3): move player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft
47. From (4, 3) to (4, 2): move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft
48. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos42 dirleft

After this, the stone is at (4, 2) or pos42, and player1 is at (4, 3) or pos43.

49. From (4, 3) to (4, 2): move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft
50. From (4, 2) to (4, 1): move player1 pos42 pos41 dirleft
51. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos41 dirleft

After this, the stone is at (4, 1) or pos41, and player1 is at (4, 2) or pos42.

52. From (4, 2) to (4, 1): move player1 pos42 pos41 dirleft
53. From (4, 1) to (5, 1): move player1 pos41 pos51 dirdown
54. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos51 pos41 pos51 dirup

After this, the stone is at (5, 1) or pos51 (the goal), and player1 is at (4, 1) or pos41.

Actually, in step 39, move player1 pos41 pos31 dirup, we move from (4, 1) to (3, 1). But in step 31, the player is at (4, 1) and the stone is at (4, 2). In the steps from 31 to 36, we move the stone from (4, 2) to (4, 4), but we don't specify where the player is. Let me fix a few steps.

From step 30, the player is at (4, 1) or pos41, and the stone is at (4, 2) or pos42.

31. From (4, 1) to (3, 1): move player1 pos41 pos31 dirup
32. From (3, 1) to (3, 2): move player1 pos31 pos32 dirright
33. From (3, 2) to (3, 3): move player1 pos32 pos33 dirright
34. From (3, 3) to (4, 3): move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown
35. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos43 dirright

After this, the stone is at (4, 3) or pos43, and player1 is at (4, 2) or pos42.

36. From (4, 2) to (3, 2): move player1 pos42 pos32 dirup
37. From (3, 2) to (3, 3): move player1 pos32 pos33 dirright
38. From (3, 3) to (3, 4): move player1 pos33 pos34 dirright
39. From (3, 4) to (4, 4): move player1 pos34 pos44 dirdown
40. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos44 dirright

After this, the stone is at (4, 4) or pos44, and player1 is at (4, 3) or pos43. We've now satisfactorily reached constraint 3.

41. From (4, 3) to (4, 2): move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft
42. From (4, 2) to (4, 1): move player1 pos42 pos41 dirleft
43. From (4, 1) to (3, 1): move player1 pos41 pos31 dirup
44. From (3, 1) to (2, 1): move player1 pos31 pos21 dirup
45. From (2, 1) to (2, 2): move player1 pos21 pos22 dirright
46. From (2, 2) to (2, 3): move player1 pos22 pos23 dirright
47. From (2, 3) to (2, 4): move player1 pos23 pos24 dirright
48. From (2, 4) to (3, 4): move player1 pos24 pos34 dirdown
49. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos43 dirleft

After this, the stone is at (4, 3) or pos43, and player1 is at (4, 4) or pos44.

50. From (4, 4) to (4, 3): move player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft
51. From (4, 3) to (4, 2): move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft
52. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos42 dirleft

After this, the stone is at (4, 2) or pos42, and player1 is at (4, 3) or pos43.

53. From (4, 3) to (4, 2): move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft
54. From (4, 2) to (4, 1): move player1 pos42 pos41 dirleft
55. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos41 dirleft

After this, the stone is at (4, 1) or pos41, and player1 is at (4, 2) or
