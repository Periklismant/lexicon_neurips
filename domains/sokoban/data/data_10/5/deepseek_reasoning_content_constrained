Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to get stone1 to a goal location, which is pos11. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

So, the initial state has player1 at pos55 and stone1 at pos43. The only goal location is pos11. All other locations are non-goal. The initial clear locations include pos43 (where stone1 is?), wait no, the original state says "stone1 is at location pos43" and "Location pos43 is clear". Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check again.

Looking back: The original state says "stone1 is at location pos43" and "Location pos43 is clear". But if a stone is at a location, that location shouldn't be clear. Hmm, maybe that's a typo in the problem. Or perhaps the problem uses "clear" to mean something else. Wait, the problem says "each position may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty". So if a stone is there, the location is not clear. So maybe the original state has a contradiction. Wait, the original state lists "Location pos43 is clear" but also "stone1 is at location pos43". That's conflicting. But according to the problem's description, a location is clear if it's empty. So this seems like an error. But the user provided this, so maybe I have to work with it. Or perhaps I misread. Let me check again.

Wait, the original state says:

"stone1 is at location pos43"

Then later, in the list of locations that are clear, it includes "Location pos43 is clear". That can't be. So this must be a mistake in the problem statement. But since the problem is given as such, maybe I should proceed under the assumption that there's an error, but perhaps the stone is actually at pos43, making pos43 not clear. But the problem states both. Hmm. Maybe "Location pos43 is clear" is a mistake. Let's assume that pos43 is not clear because the stone is there. Otherwise, the problem is inconsistent. So perhaps the line "Location pos43 is clear" is an error. Let me proceed with that.

So stone1 is at pos43, which is a non-goal location. The agent is at pos55. The goal is to have stone1 at a goal location (pos11). But there are multiple constraints to satisfy.

Let's list the constraints one by one:

1. stone1 must be at pos23 in at least one state. Then, after that, the player must be at pos34 at some point.
2. The player must be at pos13 in at least one state, and after that, they must be at pos55 at some point.
3. stone1 must be at pos43 in at least one state (which is already true in the initial state), and if it is, then pos42 must be not clear or stone1 is at pos45 in some subsequent state.
4. At least one of pos34 or pos31 must be not clear in some state.
5. The player must be at pos23 in some state, and after that, they must reach pos41.
6. The player must be at pos33 in some state, and before that, pos12 must be not clear or stone1 was at pos12.
7. At least one of pos41 or pos15 must be not clear in some state.
8. pos24 being not clear can only happen in one continuous sequence. So if pos24 is occupied, then once it's cleared, it can't be occupied again. Or perhaps that the duration when pos24 is not clear can't be split into multiple periods. So maybe we can only have a single block of consecutive states where pos24 is not clear.
9. The player must be at pos43 in some state, and after that, pos43 must not be clear (which makes sense because the player is there, but after moving away, it's clear again. Wait, but the constraint says that if the player is at pos43 in state s, then in s or a later state, pos43 is not clear. So when the player is there, pos43 is not clear (since the player is occupying it). Then when the player leaves, pos43 becomes clear again. So this constraint would be automatically satisfied when the player is at pos43. Because in state s where the player is there, pos43 is not clear, so the condition holds. So this constraint is probably automatically satisfied once the player is at pos43. So maybe just ensuring that the player visits pos43 at some point.

10. At least one state must have stone1 at pos32 or pos25 not clear.

So the plan must satisfy all these constraints while moving stone1 to pos11.

First, the main task: get stone1 from pos43 to pos11. Let's think about the path. pos43 is in row 4, column 3. pos11 is row 1, column 1. So the stone needs to move left and up. But the agent can only push stones in directions adjacent. Let's think about the possible moves.

But first, the agent starts at pos55. To reach the stone at pos43, the agent needs to move up or left. Let's see the movement possibilities.

From pos55, the possible moves are dirleft to pos45 or dirup to pos54. Let's check the movement allowed:

Looking at the "You may move from..." statements:

For pos55: "You may move from location pos55 to location pos45 following direction dirleft", and "You may move from location pos55 to location pos54 following direction dirup".

So from pos55, the agent can go left to pos45 or up to pos54.

But the stone is at pos43. The agent needs to get to a position adjacent to the stone to push it. Let's see the positions around pos43. The possible directions to push the stone would be up (to pos33), left (to pos42), right (to pos44), or down (to pos53). But the stone is at pos43. The agent can push it if they are adjacent in a direction, then push in that direction.

Wait, the push actions require that the agent is at a location adjacent to the stone's current position. For example, to push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (up), the agent needs to be at pos43's south (pos53) and push up? Wait, no. The directions are a bit tricky. Let me think: the direction in the action is the direction from the agent's location to the stone's location. Wait, the action "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": l_p is the agent's location, l_from is the stone's location. So the direction d must be the direction from l_p to l_from. Then, the stone is pushed from l_from to l_to, which is in the same direction. So for example, if the agent is at pos53 (south of pos43), direction dirup would take from pos53 to pos43, then pushing up from pos43 would take the stone to pos33. Wait, but the direction for the push is the same as the direction from the agent to the stone. So the agent moves towards the stone (direction d) to push it in direction d. So the stone moves in direction d from its current position.

So to push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (up), the agent must be at pos53 (south of pos43) and direction dirdown (since from pos53, moving up would be to pos43). Wait, no. Wait, the movement directions are a bit confusing. Let's check the movement possibilities.

For example, "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirup". So dirup from pos43 leads to pos33. So direction dirup is north. Similarly, dirdown is south, dirleft is west, dirright is east.

So if the agent is at pos53 (south of pos43), to reach pos43, the direction would be dirup. So to push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (north), the agent needs to be south of the stone (pos53) and move dirup into pos43, pushing the stone dirup to pos33. But the action would be "pushtogoal" if the destination is a goal, or "pushtonongoal" otherwise.

But pos33 is not a goal location. So pushing to pos33 would require using pushtonongoal. But the goal is to get the stone to pos11, which is a goal. So maybe the agent needs to push the stone towards pos11 step by step.

But first, the agent needs to reach the stone. Starting at pos55, how to get to pos43?

From pos55, move dirup to pos54. Then from pos54, move dirup to pos53. Then from pos53, move dirup to pos43? Wait, pos53's movement options: "You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos53 to location pos52 following direction dirup", and "You may move from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown".

Wait, no. Let me check the movement possibilities again. The movement directions are given in the problem's "You may move from..." list.

Looking for pos53's movement options:

Looking through the list, find entries starting with "You may move from location pos53...".

Found:

"You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos53 to location pos52 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown"

So from pos53, moving dirleft (west) would take the agent to pos43. So if the agent is at pos53, moving dirleft to pos43. But pos43 has the stone, so the agent can't move there unless they are pushing the stone. Wait, no. The stone is at pos43. So pos43 is not clear (since the stone is there), so the agent can't move into pos43 unless they are pushing the stone. So the agent cannot simply move into pos43. Therefore, the agent needs to approach the stone from an adjacent tile and then push it.

So to push the stone from pos43, the agent must be at a neighboring location (pos42, pos44, pos33, or pos53). But let's check which of those are accessible.

Wait, the stone is at pos43. The agent needs to be at a location adjacent to pos43 to push it. So possible positions are pos42 (west), pos44 (east), pos33 (north), pos53 (south). Let's see if the agent can reach any of those.

Starting from pos55:

pos55 → pos54 (dirup)

pos54 → pos44 (dirleft) via "You may move from location pos54 to location pos44 following direction dirleft"

Wait, let's check: From pos54, movement options are:

"You may move from location pos54 to location pos44 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos54 to location pos53 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos54 to location pos55 following direction dirdown"

So from pos54, the agent can move dirleft to pos44. Then, from pos44, where can they go?

pos44's movement options:

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown"

Wait, so from pos44, moving dirup (north) would take the agent to pos43. But pos43 has the stone, so it's not clear. So the agent can't move there unless pushing the stone. So to push the stone from pos43, the agent can be at pos44 and push west (dirleft) into pos43, then push the stone west to pos42. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, if the agent is at pos33 (north of pos43), they could push the stone south into pos43, but that's not possible since the stone is already there.

Wait, maybe the agent needs to go around to pos33 to push the stone north. Let's think.

Alternatively, the agent could go to pos42 (west of pos43) and push the stone east into pos43, but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe the agent needs to approach from the east (pos44) to push the stone west (to pos43's west direction, which is pos42). But the stone is already at pos43. So perhaps the agent needs to move to pos44, then push the stone west from pos43 to pos42.

Wait, no. Wait, the agent is at pos44. To push the stone from pos43 to pos42 (west), the agent would need to be at pos43's east (pos44), then move west (dirleft) into pos43, pushing the stone west to pos42. So the action would be pushtonongoal, since pos42 is not a goal. The preconditions for that action would be:

- Agent is at l_p (pos44)
- Stone is at l_from (pos43)
- l_to (pos42) is clear
- Can move from l_p (pos44) to l_from (pos43) following direction dirleft (since from pos44 to pos43 is dirleft? Wait, pos44 is east of pos43. So moving from pos44 to pos43 is dirleft (west). So direction dirleft. Then, from pos43 to pos42 is dirleft again. So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirleft.

But after that, the stone is at pos42, which is a non-goal. Then, the agent would be at pos43. Then, perhaps push it further west. But the goal is to get it to pos11. So maybe this is not the right path.

Alternatively, pushing the stone north from pos43 to pos33. For that, the agent needs to be south of pos43 (pos53) and move north (dirdown?) Wait, no. Wait, the direction from the agent's position to the stone's position. If the agent is at pos53 (south of pos43), the direction to pos43 is dirup. Then, pushing the stone north (dirup) would move it to pos33. So the action would be pushtonongoal, since pos33 is not a goal. So the agent moves to pos53, then pushes the stone north to pos33. Let's check if pos33 is clear. Initially, pos33 is clear. So that's possible.

So the steps would be:

1. Move from pos55 to pos54 (dirup)
2. Move from pos54 to pos53 (dirdown? Wait, pos54's movement options: from pos54, you can go dirleft to pos44, dirup to pos53, or dirdown to pos55. Wait, dirup from pos54 would be to pos53? Because pos54 is row 5, column4. dirup would be row decreases. So pos53 is row5, column3. Wait, maybe the coordinates are such that posXY is row X, column Y. So pos55 is row5, column5. So moving up from pos55 (row5) would go to row4 (pos54). So moving up decreases the row number, and moving down increases it. Similarly, dirleft decreases column, dirright increases.

So, for example, pos43 is row4, column3. Moving dirup from pos43 would take you to row3, column3 (pos33). Moving dirleft would take you to column2 (pos42), etc.

So, the agent is at pos55 (row5, column5). To get to pos53 (row5, column3), how?

From pos55, move dirup to pos54 (row5-1=4? Wait, maybe the first digit is the row and the second the column. So pos55 is row5, column5. Moving up would decrease the row. So dirup from pos55 is to pos45 (row4, column5). Wait, no. Wait the movement statements:

Looking at the movement from pos55: "You may move from location pos55 to location pos45 following direction dirleft" and "You may move from location pos55 to location pos54 following direction dirup".

Ah, so dirup from pos55 is to pos54 (same column, row decreases by 1). Dirleft from pos55 is to pos45 (row decreases by 1, column stays? No, pos45 is row4, column5. Wait, pos55 is row5, column5. dirleft would decrease the column. So moving dirleft from pos55 would go to column4, so pos54. Wait, but according to the problem's movement statements:

"You may move from location pos55 to location pos45 following direction dirleft"

Wait, that can't be right. Because moving left from pos55 (column5) would go to column4, which would be pos54. But the problem says moving dirleft from pos55 takes you to pos45. That suggests that the first digit is the row, the second the column, and dirleft decreases the column. So pos55 (row5, column5) → dirleft would be column4, same row → pos54. But according to the problem, dirleft from pos55 is to pos45. That's confusing. Let me check the movement statements again.

Looking at the problem's movement statements:

"For pos55: You may move from location pos55 to location pos45 following direction dirleft"

Ah, so moving dirleft from pos55 takes you to pos45. That suggests that the direction dirleft in this context changes the row. Wait, that's inconsistent. pos45 is row4, column5. So moving dirleft from pos55 (row5, column5) would decrease the row by 1, keeping the column the same. So dirleft here seems to be moving up. But that contradicts the direction names. This is confusing.

Wait, the directions are defined as dirup, dirdown, dirleft, dirright. The movement statements might have their own mapping. For example, the movement from pos55 to pos45 is direction dirleft. So pos45 is directly above pos55. So dirleft corresponds to moving up. But that's odd. Alternatively, perhaps the grid is laid out such that moving dirleft from pos55 (row5, column5) takes you to row4, column5 (pos45). That would mean dirleft is moving up, which is counterintuitive. Alternatively, perhaps the grid is numbered differently. This is a problem because the movement directions are not following the standard left/right as column changes. This is a critical point.

Alternatively, perhaps the movement directions are based on the grid's coordinate system. For example, pos11 is top-left, pos15 is top-right, pos51 is bottom-left, pos55 is bottom-right. So moving dirup from pos55 (bottom-right) would go to pos45 (up one row), dirleft would go to pos54 (left one column). But according to the movement statements, moving dirleft from pos55 goes to pos45. That would mean dirleft is moving up. That's conflicting. So the problem's movement directions are possibly not aligned with standard directions, which complicates things.

This is a major issue. To proceed, I need to parse the movement statements correctly. Let's take some examples:

From pos55:

- "You may move from location pos55 to location pos45 following direction dirleft"

So pos55 → pos45 via dirleft. pos45 is row4, column5. So moving dirleft from pos55 decreases the row by 1, keeping column same. So dirleft here is moving up.

But that's unconventional. Similarly, "You may move from location pos55 to location pos54 following direction dirup". pos54 is row5, column4. So moving dirup from pos55 (row5, column5) to pos54 (row5, column4) would decrease the column by 1. So dirup is moving left. That's conflicting.

Wait, this is a problem. The directions are not as per standard. For example, moving dirup from pos55 to pos54 (same row, column4) would be moving left. But dirleft from pos55 to pos45 is moving up. This suggests that the directions are mixed.

Alternatively, perhaps the movement directions are based on the grid's orientation where rows increase downward and columns increase to the right. So pos11 is top-left, pos12 is top-middle, etc. Then:

- dirup: row decreases (move up)
- dirdown: row increases (move down)
- dirleft: column decreases (move left)
- dirright: column increases (move right)

But according to the movement statements, from pos55, dirleft takes you to pos45 (row4, column5), which would be moving up. That contradicts the standard direction. So the problem's movement directions have dirleft and dirright affecting the row, not the column. That's possible but confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the movement from pos55 to pos45 is via dirup, not dirleft. But the problem states it's dirleft. So I have to work with the given movement directions as per the problem's statements.

This is a critical point. Let's look at another movement statement. For example, from pos11:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"

pos21 is row2, column1. So moving dirright from pos11 (row1, column1) to pos21 (row2, column1) suggests that dirright is moving down (row increases). Then another movement from pos11: "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown". pos12 is row1, column2. So dirdown here increases the column. So direction names are not matching the expected. It seems that:

- dirright: move down (row increases)
- dirdown: move right (column increases)
- dirleft: move up (row decreases)
- dirup: move left (column decreases)

This is very confusing, but according to the given movement statements, this must be the case. For example:

pos11 to pos21 via dirright: row increases by 1 (dirright is down).

pos11 to pos12 via dirdown: column increases by 1 (dirdown is right).

pos12 to pos22 via dirright: row increases by 1 (dirright is down).

pos12 to pos11 via dirup: column decreases by 1 (dirup is left).

This is a very non-intuitive direction mapping, but we have to follow it as per the problem's statements.

So directions are mapped as:

- dirright: down (row increases)
- dirleft: up (row decreases)
- dirdown: right (column increases)
- dirup: left (column decreases)

This is very important to get right. So when the agent moves in a certain direction, the row and column change accordingly.

So, for example, moving dirright from pos55 (row5, column5) would take the agent to pos65 if it existed, but since the grid is 5x5, it's invalid. But according to the problem, pos55 can move dirleft to pos45 (row4, column5), which is up (dirleft is up). Moving dirup from pos55 takes the agent to pos54 (row5, column4), which is left (dirup is left).

This is a key insight. So directions are:

- dirup: move left (column decreases)
- dirdown: move right (column increases)
- dirleft: move up (row decreases)
- dirright: move down (row increases)

With this understanding, let's re-express the movement directions.

So, to get from pos55 to pos45, the agent moves dirleft (up). To get from pos55 to pos54, the agent moves dirup (left).

Now, the agent starts at pos55. The stone is at pos43 (row4, column3). The goal is to push it to pos11 (row1, column1), which is a goal location.

So the agent needs to navigate to a position where they can push the stone towards pos11. Let's plan the path.

First, the agent is at pos55. To reach the stone at pos43, the agent needs to move left (dirup) to pos54, then dirup to pos53 (column decreases to 3), but according to the movement options:

From pos55, dirup (left) takes to pos54 (row5, column4). Then from pos54, dirup (left) would take to pos53 (row5, column3). Then from pos53, dirleft (up) to pos43 (row4, column3). Wait, but dirleft is up (row decreases). So from pos53 (row5, column3), moving dirleft (up) would take to pos43 (row4, column3). But pos43 has the stone. So the agent can't move there unless they are pushing the stone. So the agent needs to be at pos53, then push the stone north (dirleft) to pos33 (row3, column3). Because dirleft from pos53 to pos43 is up, then pushing the stone dirleft (up) again would take it to pos33.

But wait, the action requires that the agent is at a location adjacent to the stone. So to push the stone from pos43 to pos33, the agent must be at pos53 (south of pos43) and move north (dirleft) into pos43, pushing the stone north (dirleft) to pos33.

So the action would be pushtonongoal, since pos33 is not a goal. The preconditions are:

- Agent is at pos53.
- Stone is at pos43.
- pos33 is clear (which it is initially).
- Can move from pos53 to pos43 following dirleft (yes, per movement statements).
- Can move from pos43 to pos33 following dirleft (yes).
- pos33 is not a goal (correct).

So the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirleft

After this, the stone is at pos33, and the agent is at pos43.

But pos33 is not a goal. Now, the agent needs to push the stone further towards pos11. The next step could be pushing the stone from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft again). The agent would need to be south of pos33 (pos43) and move dirleft (up) into pos33, pushing the stone to pos23.

But after the first push, the agent is at pos43. So to push again, the agent needs to move around.

Wait, after pushing the stone from pos43 to pos33, the agent is at pos43. Then, to push the stone from pos33 to pos23, the agent needs to be south of pos33 (pos43), and move dirleft (up) to pos33, pushing the stone dirleft (up) to pos23. But pos33 is now occupied by the stone. So the agent can't move into pos33 unless they are pushing the stone. So the agent is at pos43, stone is at pos33. The agent can move to pos33 only if they can push the stone further. So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft.

But for that, the agent must be at pos43, stone at pos33, and the direction from pos43 to pos33 is dirleft (up). Then pushing dirleft (up) from pos33 would take the stone to pos23.

But wait, pos43 to pos33 is dirleft (up), so the agent is at pos43, stone at pos33. To push the stone north to pos23, the agent must be south of pos33 (pos43) and move north (dirleft) into pos33, pushing the stone north. So yes, the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft.

But first, after the first push, the stone is at pos33. The agent is at pos43. Now, pos33 is not clear (stone is there), so the agent can't move into pos33 unless pushing. So the agent needs to be at pos43, stone at pos33, and push it to pos23.

But the action's preconditions require that the agent is at pos43 (l_p), stone is at pos33 (l_from), pos23 (l_to) is clear, and the direction from l_p to l_from is d (dirleft). Then, direction from l_from to l_to is also dirleft. So this action is valid.

So after this push, the stone is at pos23, agent is at pos33.

Now, the stone is at pos23, which is one of the required states (constraint 1: stone1 must be at pos23 in at least one state). Also, after this, the agent must be at pos34 at some point (constraint 1's implication). So after pushing to pos23, the agent is at pos33. They need to move to pos34. How?

From pos33, movement options:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft" (up)

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright" (down)

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup" (left)

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown" (right)

Wait, directions are tricky. Let's recheck:

For pos33's movement options:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft" → dirleft is up.

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright" → dirright is down.

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup" → dirup is left.

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown" → dirdown is right.

So from pos33, the agent can move dirdown (right) to pos34. So after pushing the stone to pos23, the agent is at pos33, can move dirdown to pos34. This satisfies the constraint that after stone1 is at pos23, the agent must be at pos34 at some point.

So the agent moves from pos33 to pos34 via dirdown.

Now, the agent is at pos34. Now, they need to push the stone further towards pos11.

The stone is at pos23. The agent needs to get to a position to push it north (dirleft) to pos13, then to pos11. But pos11 is a goal.

But first, from pos34, how to reach the stone at pos23.

The agent is at pos34. To reach pos23, they need to move west (dirup) to pos33, then north (dirleft) to pos23. But pos23 has the stone. So the agent can't move into pos23 unless pushing.

Alternatively, the agent could move from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft), then to pos23 (dirup), but again, pos23 is occupied by the stone.

Alternatively, the agent could move to pos33 (dirup from pos34?), but need to check movement options.

Wait, from pos34:

Movement options:

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft" (up)

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright" (down)

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos33 following direction dirup" (left)

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos35 following direction dirdown" (right)

So from pos34, the agent can move dirup (left) to pos33, dirleft (up) to pos24, etc.

If the agent moves from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft), then from pos24 to pos23 (dirup):

pos24's movement options include "You may move from location pos24 to location pos14 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos24 to location pos34 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos24 to location pos23 following direction dirup" (left), and "You may move from location pos24 to location pos25 following direction dirdown" (right).

So from pos24, moving dirup (left) to pos23. But pos23 has the stone. So the agent can't move there unless pushing.

So the agent could go from pos34 → pos24 (dirleft), then pos24 → pos23 (dirup) but that's blocked by the stone. So instead, the agent needs to push the stone from pos23 to pos13.

To do that, the agent needs to be south of pos23 (pos33) and push dirleft (up) to pos13. But the stone is at pos23. The agent is at pos34. So the agent needs to move to pos33 (from pos34, move dirup (left) to pos33). Then, from pos33, move dirleft (up) to pos23, but that's where the stone is. So the agent can push the stone from pos23 to pos13.

But the agent is at pos33, stone at pos23. To push it north, the agent needs to be at pos33 (south of pos23), move dirleft (up) into pos23, pushing the stone to pos13. The action would be pushtonongoal, since pos13 is not a goal.

So the action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirleft.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos33 (yes, after moving from pos34 to pos33)
- Stone at pos23 (yes)
- pos13 is clear (initially yes)
- Can move from pos33 to pos23 via dirleft (yes)
- Can move from pos23 to pos13 via dirleft (yes)
- pos13 is not a goal (correct)

After this, stone is at pos13, agent at pos23.

Now, the stone is at pos13, which is not a goal. We need to push it further to pos11.

From pos13, the agent can push it west (dirup) to pos12, then north (dirleft) to pos11. Wait, pos13's adjacent positions:

- North: pos03 (invalid)
- South: pos23
- East: pos14
- West: pos12

But pos11 is row1, column1. So from pos13 (row1, column3), pushing west (dirup, which is left, column decreases) to pos12 (row1, column2), then west again to pos11 (row1, column1).

But the agent is at pos23 after pushing the stone to pos13. To reach pos13, the agent needs to move north. Let's see:

From pos23, movement options:

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirleft" (up)

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos33 following direction dirright" (down)

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos22 following direction dirup" (left)

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos24 following direction dirdown" (right)

So after pushing to pos13, the agent is at pos23. To reach the stone at pos13, the agent needs to move dirleft (up) to pos13. But pos13 now has the stone. So the agent can't move there unless pushing.

Wait, after the stone is at pos13, the agent is at pos23. To push it further, the agent needs to be south of pos13 (pos23), move dirleft (up) into pos13, pushing it to pos12 (dirleft from pos13 to pos12 is west (column decreases)).

So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos13 pos12 dirleft.

But pos12 is not a goal. Then, from there, push to pos11.

After that, the stone is at pos12. Then the agent is at pos13. From there, the agent can push the stone west (dirleft) to pos11.

But pos11 is a goal. So the final push would be pushtogoal.

So let's outline the steps:

1. Move agent from pos55 to pos54 (dirup)
2. Move from pos54 to pos53 (dirdown? Wait, pos54's movement options: dirup is left to pos53? Wait, pos54's movements:

From pos54, you can move dirleft (up) to pos44, dirup (left) to pos53, or dirdown (right) to pos55.

Wait, according to the movement statements:

"You may move from location pos54 to location pos44 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos54 to location pos53 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos54 to location pos55 following direction dirdown"

So dirup from pos54 is to pos53 (row5, column3). So to get to pos53 from pos54, move dirup.

So steps:

1. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
2. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirleft

Now stone is at pos33, agent at pos43.

4. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft (but pos33 has the stone now. Wait, after the push, the agent is at pos43. To push the stone from pos33 to pos23, the agent needs to be at pos43 and push dirleft (up) into pos33, but pos33 is occupied by the stone. So the agent can't move into pos33 unless pushing the stone.

So the next action is:

4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft

After this, stone at pos23, agent at pos33.

Now, constraint 1: stone1 is at pos23 (satisfied). Then, the agent must be at pos34 at some point after. So after this, the agent moves to pos34.

5. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown (since from pos33, dirdown is right to pos34)

Now agent is at pos34.

Constraint 1's implication is satisfied.

Next, we need to push the stone from pos23 to pos13.

Agent is at pos34. To reach pos23, the path is:

pos34 → pos33 (dirup) → pos23 (dirleft)

But pos23 has the stone. So:

6. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup (from pos34 to pos33 via dirup (left))
7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirleft

Now stone is at pos13, agent at pos23.

Next, push to pos12:

8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos13 pos12 dirleft

Stone at pos12, agent at pos13.

Now, push to pos11 (goal):

9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirleft

This satisfies the main goal.

But now, we need to check all constraints.

Let's go through each constraint:

1. stone1 at pos23 in some state → yes, step 4.

Implication: after that, player1 at pos34 → step5.

Satisfied.

2. player1 at pos13 in some state → step8 and step9.

Implication: after that, player1 must be at pos55. So after step9, the agent is at pos13 (after pushing to pos12), then at pos13 again after pushing to pos11. Then, they need to move to pos55.

Wait, after step9, the agent is at pos12 (since they pushed from pos13 to pos12, then to pos11). Wait, no: when you pushtogoal, the agent moves from pos13 to pos12 (l_p is pos13, l_from is pos12). Wait, no, the action is "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d". So l_p is the agent's current location (pos13), l_from is the stone's location (pos12). So the agent is at pos13, stone at pos12. Then, the agent pushes the stone from pos12 to pos11 (dirleft from pos12 to pos11). The direction d is dirleft (from pos13 to pos12 is dirleft? Wait, pos13 is east of pos12. So to get from pos13 to pos12, direction is dirleft (up). So d is dirleft. Then, the stone moves from pos12 to pos11 (dirleft, up).

After this action, the agent is at pos12 (since the agent moves from pos13 to pos12 (l_from) as per the effect of pushtogoal).

Then, the agent needs to reach pos55. So steps after step9:

10. move player1 pos12 pos11 dirleft (but pos11 is a goal location, but we need to check if it's clear. After the stone is there, pos11 is not clear. So the agent can't move there. So instead, the agent needs to find another path.

After step9, agent is at pos12. To get to pos55, they need to move down (dirright) to pos22, then right (dirdown) to pos23, etc. But this could be complicated. Alternatively, after step9, the agent is at pos12. They can move to pos22 (dirright), then to pos32, etc., eventually reaching pos55.

But this might take many steps. However, the constraint requires that if the agent is at pos13 in any state, they must later be at pos55. So after step8 and step9 (agent at pos13 and pos12), we need to ensure that the agent eventually reaches pos55.

So after step9, the agent is at pos12. They need to navigate to pos55. Let's plan that path.

From pos12:

Movement options:

"You may move from location pos12 to location pos22 following direction dirright" (down)

"You may move from location pos12 to location pos11 following direction dirup" (left)

"You may move from location pos12 to location pos13 following direction dirdown" (right)

But pos11 is occupied by the stone. So agent can move to pos22 (dirright) from pos12.

10. move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright

Now at pos22.

From pos22, movement options:

dirright (down) to pos32, dirup (left) to pos12, dirleft (up) to pos21, dirdown (right) to pos23.

11. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright

From pos32, movement options:

dirright (down) to pos42, dirup (left) to pos22, dirleft (up) to pos31, dirdown (right) to pos33.

12. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright

From pos42, movement options:

dirright (down) to pos52, dirup (left) to pos32, dirleft (up) to pos41, dirdown (right) to pos43.

13. move player1 pos42 pos52 dirright

From pos52, movement options:

dirright (down) to pos62 (invalid), so instead, check available moves. From pos52:

"You may move from location pos52 to location pos42 following direction dirleft" (up)

"You may move from location pos52 to location pos51 following direction dirup" (left)

"You may move from location pos52 to location pos53 following direction dirdown" (right)

So from pos52, move dirdown (right) to pos53.

14. move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown

From pos53, move dirdown (right) to pos54.

15. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown

From pos54, move dirdown (right) to pos55.

16. move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown

Now, the agent is at pos55, satisfying the constraint that after being at pos13, they reach pos55.

But this adds many steps, making the plan longer. However, the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). So perhaps there's a shorter path.

Wait, after step9, the agent is at pos12. To reach pos55, maybe a better path:

From pos12 → pos22 (dirright), then pos22 → pos32 (dirright), pos32 → pos42 (dirright), pos42 → pos52 (dirright), pos52 → pos53 (dirdown), pos53 → pos54 (dirdown), pos54 → pos55 (dirdown). That's 7 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, after step9, agent is at pos12. They can move to pos13 (dirdown), then pos14 (dirdown), etc., but that might not help. Alternatively, from pos12, move dirup to pos11, but it's blocked. So the above path seems necessary.

But this adds many steps. However, the problem requires an optimal plan. Is there a way to satisfy the constraints with fewer steps?

Alternatively, maybe the agent can reach pos55 earlier in the plan. For example, after pushing the stone to pos23 (step4), the agent is at pos33. Then, instead of moving to pos34 (step5), maybe they can proceed to push the stone further and then find a way to reach pos55 sooner. But this might complicate other constraints.

Let's check other constraints:

3. stone1 is at pos43 in at least one state. The initial state satisfies this. But there's another constraint that if stone1 is at pos43 in any state, then pos42 must not be clear or stone1 is at pos45 in some subsequent state. In the initial state, stone1 is at pos43. So after that, we need to ensure that either pos42 is not clear (which it is initially clear) or stone1 is at pos45. Since in our current plan, stone1 is moved from pos43 to pos33, then pos23, etc., pos42 remains clear. So this constraint is violated unless we have an action that makes pos42 not clear or moves stone1 to pos45.

This is a problem. Because in the initial state, stone1 is at pos43, so the constraint requires that in some state after that, pos42 is not clear or stone1 is at pos45. But in our current plan, we move the stone away from pos43 to pos33, and pos42 remains clear. So the constraint is not satisfied.

This means that the current plan is invalid. We need to adjust the plan to satisfy this constraint.

So, after the initial state (where stone1 is at pos43), we need to have a subsequent state where pos42 is not clear or stone1 is at pos45.

In our current plan, the first action is to push the stone from pos43 to pos33. So after that, stone1 is at pos33. But pos42 is still clear. So the constraint is not met. Therefore, we need to modify the plan to ensure that after the initial state (stone1 at pos43), either pos42 is blocked or stone1 is moved to pos45.

How can we do that?

One approach is to first push the stone from pos43 to pos42, then push it to pos43 again, but that seems inefficient. Alternatively, after moving the stone to pos33, perhaps the agent can move to pos42 and place something there, but the only objects are the agent and stones. The agent can't place anything; the only way to make pos42 not clear is to have the agent or a stone there. But there's only one stone. So to make pos42 not clear, the agent must be there or the stone must be there.

But the stone is moved to pos33, so pos42 remains clear. Therefore, the only way to satisfy the constraint is to move the stone to pos45 at some point after the initial state.

But pos45 is a non-goal location. So the stone would have to be moved to pos45, then back towards pos11. This complicates the plan but is necessary.

So let's adjust the plan:

After the initial steps, instead of pushing the stone directly towards pos11, we first push it to pos45, then back to pos43, then proceed.

But that adds steps. Alternatively, find a path that moves the stone through pos45.

But how?

The agent starts at pos55. The stone is at pos43. To push it to pos45 (row4, column5), the agent needs to be east of pos43 (pos44) and push the stone east (dirdown) to pos44, then east to pos45.

But pos43 to pos44 is east (dirdown), but pos44 is initially clear. So steps:

1. Move agent from pos55 to pos54 (dirup)
2. Move from pos54 to pos44 (dirleft)
3. Push the stone from pos43 to pos44 (dirleft from pos44 to pos43? Wait, no. Wait, the agent is at pos44. To push the stone from pos43 to pos44, the agent must be west of pos43 (pos42) and push east. But the agent is at pos44. To push the stone from pos43 to pos44, the agent must be at pos43's east (pos44), but pos43 is at row4, column3. pos44 is row4, column4. So to push west from pos44 to pos43, but the stone is at pos43. So the agent can't push the stone west from pos44 to pos43 because the stone is already there.

Alternatively, the agent needs to be at pos43's south (pos53) and push it east to pos44. But that's not possible because the stone is at pos43. Wait, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, the agent can push the stone from pos43 to pos44 (east) by being at pos43's west (pos42), but the agent needs to reach pos42 first.

But pos42 is initially clear. So the agent can move to pos42 and push the stone east.

So alternative plan:

1. Move from pos55 to pos54 (dirup)
2. Move from pos54 to pos44 (dirleft)
3. Move from pos44 to pos43 (dirup) → but pos43 has the stone. So can't move there unless pushing.

Wait, no. The agent is at pos44. To reach pos42, they need to move west. From pos44, movement options:

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft" (up)

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright" (down)

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup" (left)

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown" (right)

So from pos44, dirup (left) to pos43. But pos43 has the stone. So the agent can't move there unless pushing. So instead, the agent needs to go around.

This is getting too time-consuming. Perhaps the optimal way to satisfy the constraint is to push the stone from pos43 to pos45, then back to pos43, then proceed. But this would add steps.

Alternative approach:

After the initial state, the agent moves to pos45 and pushes the stone there.

But the stone is at pos43. To push it to pos45, the agent needs to be at pos44 and push east (dirdown) to pos45.

But how to get the agent to pos44:

From pos55 → pos54 (dirup), then pos54 → pos44 (dirleft).

Now, agent is at pos44. From there, they can push the stone from pos43 to pos44 (west) if the stone is at pos43's east. Wait, no. The stone is at pos43. To push it east to pos44, the agent must be at pos43's east (pos44), and push east (dirdown). So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos44 dirdown. But pos44 is the destination. Wait, the stone is at pos43, and the agent is at pos44. The direction from pos44 to pos43 is dirup (left). Then, pushing the stone east (dirdown) from pos43 would take it to pos44. So the action is valid.

Wait, the action is "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d". So l_p is pos44, l_from is pos43, l_to is pos44, d is dirup (from pos44 to pos43 is dirup). Then, pushing the stone from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown, east). But the direction from l_from to l_to must be d. Wait, no. The action's direction d is the direction from l_p to l_from, and the direction from l_from to l_to must also be d.

So for this action:

l_p is pos44, l_from is pos43, l_to is pos44.

Direction d must be the direction from pos44 to pos43, which is dirup (left). Then, the direction from pos43 to pos44 is dirdown (right). So this doesn't match. Therefore, this action is invalid.

Thus, the agent can't push the stone from pos43 to pos44 while being at pos44. Instead, the agent must be west of the stone to push it east. So the agent needs to be at pos42, which is west of pos43.

To reach pos42 from pos55:

pos55 → pos54 (dirup)

pos54 → pos44 (dirleft)

pos44 → pos43 (dirup) → blocked by stone.

Alternatively, pos55 → pos45 (dirleft)

pos45 → pos44 (dirup)

pos44 → pos43 (dirup) → blocked.

Alternatively, pos55 → pos54 (dirup)

pos54 → pos53 (dirup)

pos53 → pos43 (dirleft)

But can't move into pos43 unless pushing.

So to reach pos42, the agent needs to go through pos44 → pos34 → pos33 → pos32 → pos42.

This is getting too complex. Maybe it's better to first push the stone to pos45 to satisfy the constraint, even if it adds steps.

Alternative plan steps:

1. Move player1 from pos55 to pos54 (dirup)
2. Move player1 from pos54 to pos44 (dirleft)
3. Move player1 from pos44 to pos45 (dirdown)
4. Now, agent is at pos45. To push the stone from pos43 to pos45, the agent needs to be east of pos43 (pos44) and push east. But the agent is at pos45. So this isn't possible. Alternatively, agent needs to be at pos43's south (pos53) to push north into pos43, then east to pos44.

This is too time-consuming. Maybe another approach is needed.

Alternatively, after moving the stone to pos33 (as in the original plan), the agent can move to pos45 and then push it back. But this seems inefficient.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the optimal plan must include a detour to pos45. However, this might not be feasible within the optimal steps. 

Alternatively, the constraint requires that after the initial state (stone1 at pos43), in some subsequent state, pos42 is not clear or stone1 is at pos45. Since the initial state has stone1 at pos43, we need to ensure that at some point after that, either pos42 is not clear or stone1 is at pos45.

In the original plan, the first action is to push the stone from pos43 to pos33. After that, pos42 remains clear. So the constraint is violated. To fix this, we can add a step where the agent moves to pos42, making it not clear (since the agent is there).

So after pushing the stone to pos33, the agent is at pos43. Then, the agent can move to pos42 (dirup from pos43 to pos42). But pos42 is clear. So:

4. After pushing to pos33, agent is at pos43.

5. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup (left)

Now, pos42 is not clear (agent is there). This satisfies the constraint that after stone1 is at pos43 (initial state), in a subsequent state, pos42 is not clear. So this meets the requirement.

This adds one extra step but ensures the constraint is satisfied.

So revised plan steps:

1. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
2. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirleft
4. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup (now pos42 is not clear)
5. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown (right)
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft
7. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
... continue as before.

This adds steps but satisfies the constraint.

Now, let's check all constraints again:

Constraint 3: stone1 at pos43 in initial state. Then, in step4, pos42 is not clear. Satisfied.

Other constraints:

Constraint 6: stone1 must be at pos43 in some state. The initial state satisfies this.

Constraint 4: At least one of pos34 or pos31 not clear. In the revised plan, when the agent moves to pos34 (step7), pos34 is not clear. Satisfied.

Constraint 5: player1 at pos23 in some state. In step6, after pushing to pos23, agent is at pos33. So need to move to pos23. Maybe after step6, the agent can move to pos23.

But step6 is pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft. After this, the agent is at pos33. To get to pos23, they need to move dirleft (up).

7. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft (but pos23 has the stone. So can't move there unless pushing. So instead, after step6, the stone is at pos23, agent at pos33. Then, to reach pos23, the agent needs to push the stone further. But that's not possible here. So the agent is never at pos23 unless pushing. So this constraint is not satisfied.

Wait, constraint5 requires that the player is at pos23 in some state. In the original plan, after pushing the stone to pos23 (step4 in the original plan), the agent is at pos33. Then, moving to pos23 would require pushing the stone, which isn't possible. So the original plan didn't satisfy this constraint.

So we need to ensure that the agent is at pos23 at some point. How?

After pushing the stone to pos23, the agent is at pos33. To get to pos23, they need to move dirleft (up) from pos33 to pos23, but pos23 is occupied by the stone. So they can't move there unless pushing. So unless the stone is moved away, the agent can't reach pos23. So perhaps after pushing the stone to pos13, the agent can move back to pos23.

But after pushing to pos13, the agent is at pos23. So step8 in the original plan would have the agent at pos23. So that satisfies constraint5.

So in the original plan, after step8 (pushing to pos13), the agent is at pos23. So constraint5 is satisfied.

Then, the implication is that after being at pos23, the agent must be at pos41 at some point.

So in the original plan, after step8, agent is at pos23. Then, they need to reach pos41. How?

From pos23, movement options include dirleft (up) to pos13, dirright (down) to pos33, dirup (left) to pos22, dirdown (right) to pos24.

So to reach pos41 (row4, column1), the agent needs to move west and down.

Path from pos23 to pos41:

pos23 → pos24 (dirdown) → pos34 (dirright) → pos44 (dirright) → pos43 (dirup) → pos42 (dirup) → pos41 (dirleft). But this is a long path.

Alternatively:

pos23 → pos24 (dirdown) → pos34 (dirright) → pos44 (dirright) → pos54 (dirright) → pos53 (dirup) → pos52 (dirup) → pos51 (dirleft) → pos41 (dirleft). This is also long.

But regardless, after step8, the agent is at pos23. To satisfy the implication, they must reach pos41 at some point. So after completing the main goal (stone at pos11), the agent needs to move to pos41.

This adds steps but is necessary.

So after step9 (stone at pos11), the agent is at pos12. They need to reach pos41.

Steps:

10. move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright
11. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright
12. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright
13. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup (left)
Now at pos41. Satisfies the implication.

This adds four more steps.

But the problem requires an optimal plan, so this may not be optimal. However, given the constraints, it's necessary.

This is getting very lengthy. Given the complexity, perhaps the optimal plan requires a different approach that satisfies all constraints with fewer steps.

Alternative approach: 

Use the initial position to move the agent to pos43, but since the stone is there, they need to push it. However, the initial state has pos43 clear, which is a contradiction. Assuming that's a mistake and pos43 is not clear, the agent can't move there. So the initial steps are necessary.

Another way to satisfy the constraint requiring the player to be at pos13: perhaps during the push to pos11, the agent passes through pos13.

But in the original plan, the agent is at pos13 when pushing the stone to pos12. So that satisfies the constraint.

The constraint also requires that after being at pos13, the agent reaches pos55. So the steps to move back to pos55 are necessary.

Including all these steps makes the plan very long, but perhaps it's unavoidable.

Now, considering all constraints, the plan must also satisfy:

Constraint7: At least one of pos41 or pos15 not clear. In the revised plan, after step13, the agent is at pos41, making it not clear. So satisfied.

Constraint8: pos24 not clear in at most one continuous sequence. In the original plan, pos24 might be not clear when the agent moves through it. For example, when moving from pos34 to pos24 (step in the revised plan?), but if the agent only passes through pos24 once, it's a single sequence.

Constraint9: player1 at pos43 in some state. In the original plan, after pushing the stone from pos43 to pos33, the agent is at pos43. So satisfied. The implication is that after being at pos43, pos43 is not clear. In that state, the agent is at pos43, so pos43 is not clear. So satisfied.

Constraint10: At least one state has stone1 at pos32 or pos25 not clear. In the original plan, stone1 is never at pos32, and pos25 remains clear. So this constraint is not satisfied. Therefore, we need to adjust the plan to have either stone1 at pos32 or pos25 not clear.

This adds another layer of complexity.

To satisfy constraint10, perhaps during the plan, the agent can move to pos25, making it not clear. For example, after the main goal is achieved, the agent can move to pos25.

But pos25 is initially clear. So the agent needs to visit pos25 at some point.

So steps after step9:

10. move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright
11. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown (right)
12. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
13. move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown
Now, pos25 is not clear (agent is there). This satisfies constraint10.

But this adds steps. However, it's necessary.

Now, constraint10 is satisfied because pos25 is not clear in step13.

Putting it all together, the plan becomes quite long. However, the problem requires an optimal plan. This suggests that there's a more efficient way to satisfy all constraints.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I'll proceed to draft the plan with the steps I've outlined, ensuring all constraints are met.
