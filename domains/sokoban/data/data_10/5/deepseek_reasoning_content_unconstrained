Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. So, the goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. The initial state has stone1 at pos43, and the only goal location mentioned is pos11. The agent starts at pos55. 

First, I need to check where the stones are and where the goal positions are. From the initial state, stone1 is at pos43, which isn't a goal. The only goal location is pos11. So, the plan must move stone1 from pos43 to pos11. 

But how do the actions work? The agent can move around and push stones either to goal or non-goal locations. To push a stone, the agent needs to be adjacent to it in the direction of the push. Let's see the movement paths.

The agent starts at pos55. To reach stone1 at pos43, the agent needs to navigate through the grid. Let me look at the movement connections. From pos55, the agent can move up to pos54 or left to pos45. Let's see the possible paths. 

From pos55, moving up to pos54 (dirup). Then from pos54, moving up to pos53, then pos52, pos51. Alternatively, maybe a different path. Wait, the movement directions can be a bit complex. Let's try to find a path from pos55 to pos43.

Looking at the movement allowed:

From pos55, possible moves are dirleft to pos45 or dirup to pos54. Let's check the connections:

- pos55 can go to pos45 (dirleft) or pos54 (dirup).
- pos45 can go to pos35 (dirleft) or pos44 (dirup), or pos55 (dirright). Wait, no, the allowed moves are:

Wait, the "You may move from..." statements list the possible transitions. Let me parse those for the relevant positions.

Looking for pos55: The only move mentioned is "You may move from location pos55 to location pos45 following direction dirleft" and "You may move from location pos55 to location pos54 following direction dirup".

So from pos55, the agent can go left to pos45 or up to pos54. Let's plan a path from pos55 to pos43.

Option 1: pos55 → pos45 (dirleft). From pos45, can move right to pos55 (no), left to pos35? Wait, the movement from pos45: According to the list, "You may move from location pos45 to location pos35 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos45 to location pos55 following direction dirright", and "You may move from location pos45 to location pos44 following direction dirup". So from pos45, the agent can go left to pos35, up to pos44, or right to pos55.

So from pos45, moving up to pos44 (dirup). Then pos44 can go to pos34 (dirleft), pos54 (dirright), or pos43 (dirup?), wait:

Looking at the movement from pos44: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup", and "You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown".

So from pos44, moving up (dirup) would take the agent to pos43. Wait, but pos43 is where the stone is. But initially, the stone is at pos43, and the location pos43 is clear? Wait, the original state says "Location pos43 is clear", but then "stone1 is at location pos43". Hmm, that's a contradiction. Wait, no—the original state lists "stone1 is at location pos43" and "Location pos43 is clear". Wait, how can a location be clear if there's a stone there? Maybe "clear" here means that there's no agent or stone? Wait, the problem statement says "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So a location is clear if it's empty. But in the initial state, pos43 has stone1, so it's not clear. But the original state says "Location pos43 is clear". That must be a mistake. Wait, let me check again.

Original state says:

"player1 is at location pos55"

"stone1 is at location pos43"

"Location pos43 is clear"

Wait, that's conflicting. If stone1 is at pos43, then pos43 shouldn't be clear. Maybe that's a typo. But the user provided this, so maybe there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps "clear" refers to the agent not being present. Wait, but the problem statement says a location is clear if it's empty. So if a stone is there, it's not clear. Therefore, the original state must have a mistake. But according to the problem description, the user provides the original state. Let me check again.

Wait, the user wrote:

The original state of the world includes:

"Location pos43 is clear"

But also "stone1 is at location pos43".

This seems contradictory. But maybe "clear" here means that there's no agent present. Let's check the action preconditions. For example, the move action requires that the destination is clear, i.e., no agent or stone. Or perhaps "clear" only refers to the agent. But according to the problem statement, "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So a location is clear if it's empty. Therefore, if a stone is present, the location is not clear. Thus, the initial state has a contradiction. But perhaps this is a mistake in the problem setup. Alternatively, maybe "clear" here refers to the agent not being present. Wait, in the initial state, "Location pos55 is clear" but the agent is there. So that's also conflicting. Wait, the original state says "player1 is at location pos55" and "Location pos55 is clear". So this must mean that "clear" refers to the presence of a stone, not the agent. Or perhaps "clear" is a separate property. Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe "Location posXX is clear" means that there's no stone there, but the agent can be there. But according to the problem statement, a location can have agent, stone, or be empty. So if a location has a stone, it's not clear. If it has the agent, it's not clear. Therefore, the initial state seems contradictory. For example, pos55 has the agent, but the state says "Location pos55 is clear". That's impossible. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement:

The original state of the world includes:

"player1 is at location pos55"

"stone1 is at location pos43"

"Location pos11 is clear"

... (other locations) ...

"Location pos43 is clear"

"Location pos55 is clear"

But if the agent is at pos55, then pos55 is not clear. Similarly, stone1 is at pos43, so pos43 is not clear. Therefore, these statements are conflicting. This suggests that perhaps there's an error in the problem setup. However, since this is the problem provided, I need to work with it. Maybe "Location is clear" here means that there's no stone, but the agent can be present. Or perhaps the "clear" predicate is only about stones. That's possible. Because in the preconditions for move, it's required that the destination is clear. So when moving, the destination must not have a stone or the agent. But if the agent is at pos55, and "Location pos55 is clear", that can't be. Therefore, there's a mistake in the problem's initial state. But perhaps the "clear" refers to the stone not being present. Let me assume that "Location posXX is clear" means that there's no stone there, regardless of the agent. Then, in the initial state, pos43 has a stone, so it's not clear. But the problem says "Location pos43 is clear", which is conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the "is clear" refers to the agent not being present, and the stone is allowed. So, if a location has a stone but no agent, it's considered clear. Then, in the initial state, pos43 is clear (stone is there, but no agent). But when moving, the destination must be clear (no agent). That could make sense. So the agent can move to a location with a stone, but the preconditions for move require that the destination is clear (no agent). Wait, but the move action's preconditions say (ii) location l_to is clear. If "clear" means no agent or stone, then the agent can't move to a location with a stone. But if "clear" only means no agent, then the presence of a stone doesn't block movement. But that's not specified.

This is a critical ambiguity. Let me re-check the problem's action preconditions.

For the move action, the preconditions are: (i) agent is at l_from, (ii) l_to is clear, (iii) can move from l_from to l_to via direction d.

The effect of move is that the agent leaves l_from, arrives at l_to, l_from becomes clear, and l_to is no longer clear.

So "clear" here refers to the agent's presence. So a location is clear if the agent is not there. Stones are separate. So when moving, the destination must not have the agent, but stones are allowed? Wait, but then the move action's effect says that after moving, the l_to is no longer clear (agent is there), and l_from is clear (agent left). So "clear" in this context is about the agent's presence. Therefore, a location is clear if the agent is not present. The presence of a stone doesn't affect whether a location is clear for movement. But then, when pushing a stone, the stone's location is separate. 

Wait, but the pushtogoal and pushtonongoal actions require that the stone is at l_from, and the agent is at l_p. The l_p is adjacent to l_from in the direction d. So for example, if the agent is at l_p, and the stone is at l_from, which is in direction d from l_p. Then, the agent can push the stone to l_to, which is in direction d from l_from. So the agent moves into l_from (pushing the stone to l_to), and ends up at l_from.

So, when pushing, the agent moves from l_p to l_from, and the stone moves from l_from to l_to.

In that case, for the move action, the agent can move to a location that has a stone, as long as it's clear (i.e., no agent). But that's not possible because if a stone is there, the agent can't be there. Wait, but according to the problem statement, each position can contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. So a location can't have both. Therefore, if a stone is at a location, the agent can't be there. Therefore, when moving, the destination must be empty (no agent, no stone). Because if there's a stone, the agent can't move there. So the precondition (ii) for move is that l_to is clear, which in this case means empty (no agent, no stone). Similarly, when pushing, the l_to must be clear (empty) to push the stone there.

But in the initial state, the problem says "Location pos43 is clear" but stone1 is there. That's a contradiction. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding. Let me check the original state again.

Original state:

- "stone1 is at location pos43"

- "Location pos43 is clear"

This is conflicting if "clear" means empty. Therefore, perhaps "Location posXX is clear" refers to the agent not being present, regardless of the stone. So a location can have a stone but still be clear (as in, no agent). So for move actions, the destination must be clear (no agent), but stones are allowed. But according to the problem statement, each position can have either the agent, a stone, or be empty. So if a location has a stone, the agent can't be there. Therefore, a location with a stone is not clear for movement, because the agent can't move into a location with a stone. Therefore, the initial state is incorrect. But since this is part of the problem, perhaps the user intended that "Location pos43 is clear" means that the agent is not there, even though there's a stone. So the agent can move to a location that is clear (no agent) even if there's a stone. But that's impossible. 

This is a problem. To resolve this, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's initial state. However, given that the problem states that "stone1 is at location pos43" and "Location pos43 is clear", I need to proceed under the assumption that "clear" here refers to the agent not being present, and stones are allowed. So even if a location has a stone, as long as the agent isn't there, it's considered clear. Therefore, when moving, the destination must be clear (no agent), but stones are allowed. However, according to the problem's own rules, a location can't have both agent and stone. Therefore, if a location has a stone, the agent can't move there. So there's a contradiction here. 

Alternatively, perhaps the "clear" predicate is only about the presence of the agent, and stones are considered separate. So "clear" means no agent, and stones are irrelevant. Then, the agent can move into a location that has a stone, but that would violate the problem's own statement that a position can't have both. Therefore, this is impossible, so the initial state must be wrong. 

Given that this is a puzzle, perhaps there's a mistake in the initial state. But since the user provided this, I have to work with it. Maybe the "clear" refers to no stone, and the agent's presence is separate. For example, a location can be clear (no stone) even if the agent is there. But then, when moving, the destination must be clear (no stone). 

This is getting too confusing. Let's try to proceed. Let's assume that "clear" means that there's no stone, and the agent's presence is handled separately. So the initial state says pos43 has a stone, so it's not clear. But the problem says "Location pos43 is clear", which would be wrong. Therefore, perhaps the initial state has an error. However, the problem states that in the initial state, pos43 is clear, and stone1 is there. This is conflicting, so perhaps there's a mistake. 

Alternatively, maybe "clear" means that the agent is not present, regardless of stones. So when moving, the destination must be clear (agent not present), but stones are allowed. But since a location can't have both agent and stone, moving into a location with a stone is impossible. Therefore, the move action's precondition (ii) requires that l_to is clear (no agent) and also no stone. But the problem statement doesn't clarify this. 

This is a critical ambiguity. To resolve this, perhaps the move action's precondition (ii) requires that l_to is clear (no agent and no stone). Then, in the initial state, pos43 has a stone, so it's not clear, but the problem says it is clear. Contradiction. Therefore, the problem's initial state is incorrect. 

But since this is the problem given, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that "clear" refers to the agent's absence, and stones are allowed. So, even if a location has a stone, as long as the agent isn't there, it's considered clear. Then, the agent can move into a location with a stone, but this would violate the problem's own statement that a position can only have one of agent, stone, or empty. Therefore, this is impossible. 

Alternatively, maybe "clear" refers to the absence of both agent and stone. So a location is clear only if it's empty. Therefore, in the initial state, pos43 has a stone, so it's not clear. But the problem's initial state says "Location pos43 is clear", which is a mistake. 

Given the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to proceed as per the problem's initial state, despite contradictions, and assume that "clear" refers to the agent's absence. Therefore, the presence of a stone doesn't affect whether a location is clear. So, for example, pos43 has a stone and is considered clear (agent not there). Then, the agent can move into pos43, but since the stone is there, that's not allowed. 

This is really confusing. To make progress, perhaps the initial state has a mistake, and the user intended that pos43 is not clear (since it has a stone), but the problem's initial state lists it as clear. Therefore, when solving the problem, we have to ignore that contradiction. 

Assuming that "clear" means the location is empty (no agent, no stone), then the initial state has errors. But given that, perhaps we can proceed with the problem as given, and assume that "clear" is only about the agent. So, for the move action, the agent can move to a location that has a stone, but that's impossible. Therefore, the problem's initial state must be incorrect. 

But since I have to work with the given information, perhaps I should proceed with the following assumptions:

- A location is clear if it has neither the agent nor a stone.

Therefore, when the problem says "Location pos43 is clear" but also "stone1 is at pos43", this is a mistake. Therefore, pos43 is not clear. Therefore, in the initial state, pos43 has stone1 and is not clear. The initial state's assertion that it is clear is incorrect, but perhaps we have to proceed with the correct understanding that pos43 is not clear. 

But how do I reconcile this? The problem says the initial state includes "stone1 is at pos43" and "Location pos43 is clear". This is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a typo, and "Location pos43 is clear" should not be present. Alternatively, maybe "Location pos43 is clear" refers to the agent not being there. But in that case, the stone's presence doesn't affect the clear status. So "clear" is only about the agent. Therefore, pos43 is clear (agent not there) despite having a stone. Then, the move action can be used to move to pos43 if it's clear (no agent), even if there's a stone. But according to the problem statement, a location can't have both agent and stone. Therefore, moving to pos43 is impossible. 

This is a deadlock. To proceed, perhaps the correct approach is to ignore the conflicting "Location pos43 is clear" and treat pos43 as not clear (since it has a stone). Therefore, the agent can't move into pos43. Therefore, to push the stone from pos43, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos43 in the direction of the push. 

So the stone is at pos43. The goal is to move it to a goal location, which is pos11. 

The agent starts at pos55. To reach pos43, the agent needs to navigate through the grid. Let's find a path from pos55 to a position adjacent to pos43 such that the agent can push the stone towards pos11.

Let's look at the possible paths. pos43's adjacent positions are:

From pos43, according to the movement connections:

- "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"

- "You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright"

- "You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup"

- "You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown"

So pos43 is connected to pos33 (left), pos53 (right), pos42 (up), and pos44 (down).

To push the stone from pos43 towards pos11 (which is in the top-left corner), the agent needs to push it in a direction that moves it closer to pos11. For example, pushing it left (to pos33) or up (to pos42). But pos11 is at the top-left, so moving the stone left (dirleft) towards pos33, then left again towards pos23, etc., could eventually reach pos11.

But the agent needs to get to a position where it can push the stone. So the agent needs to be in a position adjacent to the stone in the direction opposite to the desired push direction.

For example, to push the stone left (dirleft) from pos43 to pos33, the agent must be at pos43's right side (pos53) and move left into pos43, pushing the stone left to pos33. But pos53 is to the right of pos43.

Wait, the direction in the push actions refers to the direction from the agent's position to the stone's position. For example, if the agent is at pos53 and the stone is at pos43, the direction from pos53 to pos43 is dirup (since moving up from pos53 leads to pos43). Wait, according to the movement connections:

"You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft"

Wait, no: looking at the movement connections for pos53:

"You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft"

Wait, pos53 is at (5,3). pos43 is at (4,3). So moving left from pos53 would go to pos43? Or is the grid coordinate system different? For example, perhaps the first digit is the row and the second is the column. So pos11 is row 1, column 1; pos12 is row 1, column 2; pos21 is row 2, column 1, etc.

Assuming that, moving from pos53 (row 5, column 3) to pos43 (row 4, column3) would be direction dirup. Because moving up decreases the row number. But the movement connections mention:

"You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft"

But that's impossible if the coordinates are as I thought. So perhaps the directions are different. Let me check the movement connections again.

For pos53:

"You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos53 to location pos52 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown"

Wait, that's strange. So moving from pos53 to pos43 is dirleft. How does that work? Perhaps the columns are the first digit and the rows the second. So pos53 is column 5, row 3. Then, moving left would decrease the column number. So pos53 (column5, row3) to pos43 (column4, row3) would be dirleft. That makes sense. So the directions are such that:

- dirleft: decrease column number (move left in the same row)

- dirright: increase column number (move right in the same row)

- dirup: decrease row number (move up in the same column)

- dirdown: increase row number (move down in the same column)

So, for example, pos53 (column5, row3) moving left (dirleft) goes to pos43 (column4, row3). Moving up (dirup) from pos53 would go to pos52 (column5, row2). Moving down (dirdown) to pos54 (column5, row4). 

Given that, the directions are:

- dirleft: column decreases by 1, same row.

- dirright: column increases by 1, same row.

- dirup: row decreases by 1, same column.

- dirdown: row increases by 1, same column.

So, to get from pos55 (column5, row5) to pos43 (column4, row3), the agent needs to navigate through the grid.

Possible path:

pos55 → pos54 (dirdown? Wait, pos55's possible moves are dirleft (to pos45) or dirup (to pos54). Wait, dirleft from pos55 (column5, row5) would decrease column to 4, so pos45 (column4, row5). Dirup from pos55 (row5) would decrease row to 4, so pos54 (column5, row4). 

Let me map out a path from pos55 to pos53, which is adjacent to pos43. Because pos53 is to the right of pos43 (column5 vs column4), same row. So from pos53, moving left (dirleft) would reach pos43.

So the agent needs to reach pos53 to push the stone left into pos43's position. Wait, no. If the stone is at pos43, and the agent is at pos53, then to push the stone left (dirleft) from pos43 to pos33, the agent needs to be at pos43's right side (pos53), and move left into pos43, pushing the stone left to pos33. 

But for that, the agent must be at pos53, and the stone is at pos43. The agent can then perform a pushtogoal action if pos33 is a goal location. But pos33 is not a goal location. The only goal is pos11. So pushing the stone to pos33 would require using pushtonongoal. But then, we need to move the stone from pos43 to pos33, then from pos33 to pos23, etc., until reaching pos11.

But the problem's goal is to have stone1 at a goal location (pos11). So the agent needs to push the stone from pos43 all the way to pos11.

Let's plan the steps:

1. Agent moves from pos55 to pos53. 

But how? Let's find a path from pos55 to pos53.

From pos55, possible moves:

- dirleft to pos45 (column4, row5)

- dirup to pos54 (column5, row4)

Let's try moving dirup to pos54. From pos54, possible moves:

- dirleft to pos44 (column4, row4)

- dirup to pos53 (column5, row3) via dirdown? Wait, let's check the movement connections for pos54.

Looking at the movement connections:

"You may move from location pos54 to location pos44 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos54 to location pos53 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos54 to location pos55 following direction dirdown"

So from pos54, moving dirup (row decreases by 1) to pos53 (column5, row3). Yes. So path:

pos55 → pos54 (dirup)

pos54 → pos53 (dirup)

Now, the agent is at pos53. The stone is at pos43. The agent can now push the stone to the left (dirleft) from pos43 to pos33. 

So the action would be pushtonongoal (since pos33 is not a goal). But wait, the agent is at pos53, and the stone is at pos43. The agent's position l_p is pos53, l_from is pos43? No, the agent needs to be adjacent to the stone in the direction of the push. To push the stone left (dirleft), the agent must be to the right of the stone (pos43's right is pos53). So the agent is at pos53, and the stone is at pos43. The direction from the agent to the stone is dirleft (since moving left from pos53 to pos43). 

So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirleft. 

But wait, the preconditions for pushtonongoal are:

(i) agent p is at l_p (pos53)

(ii) stone s is at l_from (pos43)

(iii) l_to (pos33) is clear

(iv) can move from l_p (pos53) to l_from (pos43) via direction d (dirleft)

(v) can move from l_from (pos43) to l_to (pos33) via direction d (dirleft)

(vi) l_to is not a goal (pos33 is not a goal)

Are these conditions met?

(i) yes, agent is at pos53

(ii) stone1 is at pos43

(iii) pos33 is clear (initially, pos33 is clear according to the initial state)

(iv) moving from pos53 to pos43 via dirleft is allowed (according to movement connections)

(v) moving from pos43 to pos33 via dirleft is allowed (check movement connections for pos43: yes, "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft")

(vi) pos33 is not a goal (as per initial state)

So this action is valid.

After this action:

- Agent moves from pos53 to pos43

- Stone moves from pos43 to pos33

- pos33 is no longer clear (stone is there)

- Agent is now at pos43

So the stone is now at pos33. Now, the agent needs to push it further towards pos11.

Next, the agent can push the stone from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft). But to do that, the agent needs to be to the right of pos33, which is pos43. But the agent is already at pos43. So the agent can push the stone from pos33 to pos23 via dirleft. So the agent is at pos43, stone is at pos33. The direction from agent to stone is dirup (since pos33 is at row3, column3, and pos43 is row4, column3. So moving from pos43 to pos33 is dirup (row decreases by 1). 

Wait, the direction from pos43 to pos33 is dirup. So to push the stone left (dirleft) from pos33 to pos23, the agent needs to be at pos33's right (pos43), move dirleft into pos33, pushing the stone left to pos23. 

Wait, the agent is at pos43, and the stone is at pos33. To push the stone left (dirleft) to pos23, the agent must be at pos33's right (pos43), and move left (dirleft) into pos33. 

But moving from pos43 to pos33 is dirup, not dirleft. Because pos43 is (4,3), pos33 is (3,3). So moving from pos43 to pos33 is dirup (row decreases by 1). Therefore, the direction between agent and stone is dirup, not dirleft. 

So the agent is at pos43, stone is at pos33. To push the stone left (dirleft) to pos23, the agent needs to be at pos33's right side (pos34?), but pos33 is (3,3). The right side would be pos34 (3,4). Wait, no. To push the stone left (dirleft), the agent must be on the opposite side of the direction of the push. So to push the stone left (west), the agent must be to the east of the stone. 

In pos33's case, east is pos34 (3,4). So the agent needs to be at pos34, then move west (dirleft) into pos33, pushing the stone west to pos23. 

But currently, the agent is at pos43. So to get to pos34, the agent needs to move from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown), then to pos34 (dirleft), etc. Let's plan this.

After the first push, agent is at pos43. Stone is at pos33. 

Agent needs to move to pos34 to push the stone left to pos23.

Path from pos43 to pos34:

From pos43, possible moves:

- dirleft to pos33 (but stone is there, so can't move)

- dirright to pos53 (dirright: column increases to 5? pos43 is (4,3). dirright would be column4, but pos43's dirright is to pos53 (wait, according to movement connections for pos43: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright". So moving dirright from pos43 (4,3) to pos53 (5,3). But that's east direction. 

Alternatively, the agent can move down (dirdown) to pos44 (4,4). From pos43, movement connections allow moving dirdown to pos44. Yes: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown".

So agent can move from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown). Then from pos44, move dirleft to pos34 (3,4). 

From pos44, movement connections include "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft". So yes.

So steps:

move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown

move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft

Now, agent is at pos34, stone is at pos33.

Now, the agent can push the stone from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft). The agent is at pos34 (3,4), which is east of pos33 (3,3). To push west (dirleft), the agent moves west (dirleft) from pos34 to pos33, pushing the stone west to pos23.

But the preconditions for pushtonongoal:

(i) agent is at pos34 (yes)

(ii) stone is at pos33 (yes)

(iii) pos23 is clear (initial state says pos23 is clear)

(iv) can move from pos34 to pos33 via dirleft? Let's check movement connections for pos34:

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft" (dirleft from pos34 (3,4) to pos24 (2,4) — no, that's not correct. Wait, pos34 is row3, column4. dirleft would decrease column by 1 to 3, so pos33 (3,3). 

Looking at movement connections for pos34:

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft" — that's impossible. Wait, perhaps the movement connections are listed correctly. Let me check.

The movement connections listed in the problem:

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos33 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos35 following direction dirdown"

So from pos34, dirleft is to pos24 (row2, column4), which is moving up, not left. This suggests that the direction names might not correspond to the coordinate system I assumed. This is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the direction dirleft for pos34 leads to pos24, which is up. So directions might be relative to some other orientation. This makes the movement connections inconsistent with the direction names. This complicates planning.

Given that, I need to re-examine the movement connections for pos34:

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft": pos34 is (3,4). pos24 is (2,4). Moving dirleft from pos34 to pos24 implies that dirleft corresponds to moving up (row decreases by 1). Similarly, moving dirright from pos34 leads to pos44 (row4, column4), which is down. So direction names are not aligned with coordinate directions. Therefore, the directions are defined per the problem's movement connections, not according to standard directions.

This makes it challenging. Therefore, to plan, I must refer to the movement connections provided in the problem.

For pos34, the possible moves are:

- dirleft to pos24 (row2, column4)

- dirright to pos44 (row4, column4)

- dirup to pos33 (row3, column3)

- dirdown to pos35 (row3, column5)

Wait, no. The movement connections for pos34:

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos33 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos35 following direction dirdown"

So dirup from pos34 is to pos33 (row3-1=2? No. Wait, pos34 is row3, column4. dirup would decrease row by 1 to row2, column4, which is pos24. But according to the movement connections, dirup from pos34 leads to pos33. Hmm, this suggests that the directions are not based on row and column changes but are arbitrary as per the problem's movement connections. Therefore, the movement directions are not consistent with standard directions. Therefore, I need to rely solely on the movement connections listed.

For example, from pos34, dirup leads to pos33. So to get from pos34 to pos33, the direction is dirup. Therefore, the agent is at pos34, and wants to move to pos33 via dirup. Then, the stone is at pos33. But the agent can't move into a location with a stone. Therefore, this is impossible. 

So, after the first push, the agent is at pos43. The stone is at pos33. The agent needs to reach a position from which they can push the stone further towards pos11.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos33, the agent is at pos43. The agent can move to pos33 to get behind the stone, but pos33 is occupied by the stone. Therefore, the agent can't move there. 

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better path. Let's think again.

The stone starts at pos43. The goal is pos11. The agent starts at pos55.

Alternative plan:

Agent moves to pos45, then to pos44, then to pos43. But pos43 has the stone, so the agent can't move there unless they push the stone. 

Wait, but if the agent is adjacent to the stone, they can push it. So perhaps the agent can move to pos44 (south of pos43), then push the stone up (dirup) to pos42. But pos42 is not a goal. Then push the stone further.

Wait, let's try:

Agent's path: pos55 → pos45 (dirleft), then pos45 → pos44 (dirup), then pos44 → pos43 (dirup). But pos43 has the stone. So to push the stone up (dirup) to pos42, the agent must be at pos43's south (pos44), move up (dirup) into pos43, pushing the stone up to pos42. 

So action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup.

Preconditions:

(i) agent at pos44 (yes)

(ii) stone at pos43 (yes)

(iii) pos42 is clear (initial state says pos42 is clear)

(iv) can move from pos44 to pos43 via dirup (yes, according to movement connections: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup")

(v) can move from pos43 to pos42 via dirup (yes, movement from pos43 to pos42 is allowed: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup"

(vi) pos42 is not a goal (correct)

So this action is valid.

After this, the agent is at pos43, stone is at pos42. 

Now, the stone is at pos42. The agent can then push it further up to pos32 (dirup), then to pos22, etc.

But pos42 is at (4,2). To push it up to pos32 (3,2), the agent needs to be at pos42's south (pos43), and move up into pos42, pushing the stone to pos32. But the agent is currently at pos43. So action:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos32 dirup.

Preconditions:

(i) agent at pos43 (yes)

(ii) stone at pos42 (yes)

(iii) pos32 is clear (initial state yes)

(iv) can move from pos43 to pos42 via dirup (yes)

(v) can move from pos42 to pos32 via dirup (yes)

(vi) pos32 is not a goal (correct)

After this, stone is at pos32, agent at pos42.

Then, push stone from pos32 to pos22 (dirup). Agent needs to be at pos32's south (pos42), move up to pos32, pushing to pos22.

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup.

Preconditions:

(i) agent at pos42 (yes)

(ii) stone at pos32 (yes)

(iii) pos22 is clear (yes)

(iv) move from pos42 to pos32 via dirup (yes)

(v) move from pos32 to pos22 via dirup (yes)

(vi) pos22 is not a goal (correct)

After this, stone at pos22, agent at pos32.

Push stone from pos22 to pos12 (dirup). Agent at pos32, push to pos12.

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirup.

Preconditions:

(i) agent at pos32 (yes)

(ii) stone at pos22 (yes)

(iii) pos12 is clear (yes)

(iv) move from pos32 to pos22 via dirup (yes)

(v) move from pos22 to pos12 via dirup (yes)

(vi) pos12 is not a goal (correct)

After this, stone at pos12, agent at pos22.

Now, pos12 is not a goal, so need to push it to pos11, which is a goal.

But pos12 is adjacent to pos11. To push the stone from pos12 to pos11, the agent needs to be east of pos12 (pos13) and push left (dirleft). Or south of pos12 (pos22) and push up (dirup). Wait, pos12 is row1, column2. pos11 is row1, column1. So pushing left (dirleft) from pos12 to pos11. 

The agent is at pos22. To reach a position east of pos12 (pos13), the agent needs to navigate up from pos22. Alternatively, the agent can move to pos12's south (pos22), and push the stone up (dirup) into pos11. 

Wait, the movement from pos12 to pos11 is dirup. Wait, according to movement connections:

"You may move from location pos12 to location pos11 following direction dirup"

Yes. So from pos12, dirup leads to pos11. 

So to push the stone from pos12 to pos11, the agent must be at pos12's south (pos22) and move up into pos12, pushing the stone up to pos11.

But the agent is currently at pos22. The stone is at pos12. So the agent can move up from pos22 to pos12 (dirup). But pos12 is occupied by the stone. Therefore, the agent can't move there. So the agent needs to be at pos13, which is east of pos12, to push left into pos12, pushing the stone to pos11.

So agent's path from pos22 to pos13:

pos22 → pos23 (dirdown), pos23 → pos24 (dirdown), etc. Wait, this is getting too complicated. Let's think of a better way.

Alternatively, the agent can move from pos22 to pos12 (dirup), but since pos12 has the stone, the agent can't move there. Therefore, the agent must take a different path. 

Alternatively, agent can move from pos22 to pos32 (dirright), then to pos33, pos34, pos44, pos43, etc. But this would take a long time. 

Alternatively, agent can move from pos22 to pos21 (dirleft), then pos11 (dirup). But pos21 is at (2,1). From pos21, moving up (dirup) to pos11. 

But to reach pos21, the agent is at pos22. So move dirleft to pos21. Then move dirup to pos11. But then the agent is at pos11, which is a goal location, but that's not useful unless the agent can push the stone from pos12 to pos11. 

But the stone is at pos12. To push it to pos11, the agent needs to be east of pos12 (pos13) and push left. So the agent needs to reach pos13. 

But how to get there from pos22. Let's find a path:

pos22 → pos23 (dirdown), pos23 → pos24 (dirdown), pos24 → pos25 (dirdown), pos25 → pos35 (dirright), pos35 → pos45 (dirright), pos45 → pos55 (dirright), then move up to pos54, pos53, etc. This is getting too long.

Alternatively, from pos22, move to pos23 (dirdown), then to pos33 (dirright), then to pos34, pos44, etc. 

This is getting too complicated. Let me try to summarize the steps so far:

1. Agent moves from pos55 to pos44 via pos45 and pos44.

2. Push stone from pos43 to pos42.

3. Push stone from pos42 to pos32.

4. Push stone from pos32 to pos22.

5. Push stone from pos22 to pos12.

6. Push stone from pos12 to pos11.

But step 6 requires the agent to be at pos13 to push left into pos12, moving the stone to pos11. 

But how does the agent get to pos13 from pos22 after step 5?

After step 5, agent is at pos22. To reach pos13, the agent would need to move up to pos12 (but blocked by stone), or find another path.

Alternative plan after step 5:

Agent at pos22, stone at pos12.

Agent needs to move to pos13 to push the stone left to pos11.

Path from pos22 to pos13:

pos22 → pos23 (dirdown), pos23 → pos24 (dirdown), pos24 → pos25 (dirdown), pos25 → pos35 (dirright), pos35 → pos45 (dirright), pos45 → pos55 (dirright), then move up to pos54, pos53, pos52, pos51, pos41, pos31, pos21, pos11. But that's very long. 

Alternatively, find a shorter path.

From pos22, can the agent move to pos13 directly?

Looking at movement connections from pos22:

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos32 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos21 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos23 following direction dirdown"

So no direct path to pos13. 

The agent needs to go through pos23, pos24, etc. to reach pos13. This is getting too time-consuming. 

Maybe there's a more optimal path. Let's think differently.

Alternative approach: instead of pushing the stone up from pos43 to pos42, perhaps push it left to pos33, then up to pos23, etc. 

Let me try this path:

Initial plan:

1. Agent moves from pos55 to pos54 (dirup), then to pos53 (dirup).

2. Push stone from pos43 to pos33 (pushtonongoal).

3. Agent is now at pos43. Then move to pos44 (dirdown), then to pos34 (dirleft).

4. Push stone from pos33 to pos23 (pushtonongoal).

5. Agent is now at pos33. Move to pos34 (dirright), then to pos24 (dirleft).

6. Push stone from pos23 to pos13 (pushtonongoal).

7. Agent is now at pos23. Move to pos24 (dirdown), then to pos14 (dirleft).

8. Push stone from pos13 to pos12 (pushtonongoal).

9. Agent is now at pos13. Move to pos12 (dirleft).

Wait, pos12 has the stone now. So agent can't move there. 

Alternatively, after step 6, stone is at pos13. Then push it to pos12, then to pos11.

But this requires the agent to be at pos14 to push left into pos13. 

This is getting too convoluted. Perhaps there's a more optimal path. 

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos33, the agent is at pos43. From there, the agent can move to pos44 (dirdown), then to pos34 (dirleft). Now, at pos34, the agent can push the stone from pos33 to pos23 (dirup). 

Wait, the agent is at pos34. To push the stone at pos33 to pos23, the agent must be able to move from pos34 to pos33 via a direction. According to movement connections, from pos34, moving dirup leads to pos33. Yes: "You may move from location pos34 to location pos33 following direction dirup".

So the agent is at pos34, stone is at pos33. So action pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos23 dirup.

Preconditions:

(i) agent at pos34 (yes)

(ii) stone at pos33 (yes)

(iii) pos23 is clear (yes)

(iv) can move from pos34 to pos33 via dirup (yes)

(v) can move from pos33 to pos23 via dirup (check movement connections for pos33: "You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirup" — yes)

(vi) pos23 is not a goal (yes)

So this action is valid.

After this, stone is at pos23, agent at pos33.

Next, push stone from pos23 to pos13 (dirup). Agent needs to be at pos23's south (pos33), move up into pos23, pushing to pos13.

Action pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup.

Preconditions:

(i) agent at pos33 (yes)

(ii) stone at pos23 (yes)

(iii) pos13 is clear (yes)

(iv) move from pos33 to pos23 via dirup (yes)

(v) move from pos23 to pos13 via dirup (yes)

(vi) pos13 is not a goal (yes)

After this, stone is at pos13, agent at pos23.

Next, push stone from pos13 to pos12 (dirleft). Agent needs to be at pos13's east (pos14), and push left into pos13, pushing the stone to pos12. But pos14 is to the east of pos13. Agent needs to move to pos14. 

Path from pos23 to pos14:

pos23 → pos24 (dirdown), pos24 → pos14 (dirleft).

Agent moves:

move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown

move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft

Now agent is at pos14. Push stone from pos13 to pos12:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirleft.

Preconditions:

(i) agent at pos14 (yes)

(ii) stone at pos13 (yes)

(iii) pos12 is clear (yes)

(iv) can move from pos14 to pos13 via dirleft (check movement connections: pos14 to pos13 via dirleft is allowed. From movement connections: "You may move from location pos14 to location pos13 following direction dirup" — no, that's not dirleft. Wait, according to the movement connections provided:

"You may move from location pos14 to location pos24 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos14 to location pos13 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos14 to location pos15 following direction dirdown"

So from pos14, dirleft isn't a valid direction to pos13. Dirup is. So the agent can't move from pos14 to pos13 via dirleft. Therefore, this approach is invalid. 

This indicates that the agent can't reach pos13 from pos14 via dirleft. Therefore, this path is not possible. 

Alternative approach: after stone is at pos13, the agent is at pos23. Agent needs to move to pos12's east (pos13), but pos13 is occupied by the stone. So agent can't move there. Therefore, agent must find another way.

Agent can move from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown), pos24 to pos14 (dirleft), then pos14 to pos13 (dirup). But pos13 has the stone. Can't move there. 

Alternative, agent moves to pos24, then to pos14, then to pos13 via dirup. But pos13 has the stone. Therefore, can't move there. 

Thus, the agent needs to push the stone from pos13 to pos12. To do that, the agent must be at pos14 and push the stone left into pos12. But according to movement connections, pos14 can move to pos13 via dirup. So the direction from pos14 to pos13 is dirup. Therefore, to push the stone from pos13 to pos12 (dirleft), the agent must be at pos14, move dirup into pos13, and push the stone dirleft to pos12. 

But the direction of the push is dirleft from pos13 to pos12. So the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirup.

Wait, no. The direction d in pushtonongoal refers to the direction from the agent's position (l_p) to the stone's position (l_from). So if the agent is at pos14, and the stone is at pos13, the direction from pos14 to pos13 is dirup. The direction of the push is from l_from (pos13) to l_to (pos12) via direction d. Which direction would that be? To go from pos13 to pos12, the movement connection says "You may move from location pos13 to location pos12 following direction dirup". So the direction is dirup. 

Therefore, the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirup.

Preconditions:

(i) agent at pos14 (yes)

(ii) stone at pos13 (yes)

(iii) pos12 is clear (yes)

(iv) can move from pos14 to pos13 via dirup (yes)

(v) can move from pos13 to pos12 via dirup (yes)

(vi) pos12 is not a goal (yes)

So this action is valid.

After this, stone is at pos12, agent at pos13.

Now, the agent needs to push the stone from pos12 to pos11 (a goal). Since pos11 is a goal, the action will be pushtogoal.

But the agent is at pos13. To push the stone to pos11, which is dirup from pos12. 

The stone is at pos12. The agent needs to be at pos12's south (pos22) or east (pos13) to push it. 

If the agent is at pos13, which is east of pos12, the direction from agent to stone is dirleft. Then, the agent can push the stone dirup to pos11. 

Wait, the agent is at pos13, stone at pos12. The direction from pos13 to pos12 is dirleft (column decreases by 1). Then, the stone is pushed from pos12 to pos11 via dirup. 

But the pushtogoal action requires that the agent is at l_p (pos13), stone is at l_from (pos12), and the direction from l_p to l_from is d (dirleft). Then, the stone is pushed from l_from (pos12) to l_to (pos11) via direction d (dirup). 

Wait, no. The pushtogoal action's direction d is the direction from l_p to l_from and from l_from to l_to. So for the action to be valid, the agent must move from l_p to l_from via direction d, and the stone must move from l_from to l_to via the same direction d. 

Therefore, to push the stone from pos12 to pos11 (dirup), the agent must be at a position l_p such that moving direction d from l_p reaches l_from (pos12), and moving direction d from l_from reaches l_to (pos11). 

The movement from pos12 to pos11 is via dirup. So the agent must be at a position that is direction d (dirup) from pos12. The position south of pos12 is pos22. But moving dirup from pos22 to pos12. Then, the agent can push the stone dirup from pos12 to pos11. 

So agent needs to be at pos22, stone at pos12. Then, action pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos12 pos11 dirup.

Preconditions:

(i) agent at pos22 (yes, after moving)

(ii) stone at pos12 (yes)

(iii) pos11 is clear (yes)

(iv) can move from pos22 to pos12 via dirup (yes, movement connection: "You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft" — wait, no. According to movement connections for pos22:

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos32 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos21 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos23 following direction dirdown"

So moving from pos22 to pos12 is via dirleft, not dirup. Therefore, to push the stone dirup from pos12 to pos11, the agent must be at pos12's south (pos22), and move dirup into pos12, but the direction from pos22 to pos12 is dirleft, not dirup. Therefore, the direction d in the pushtogoal action must be dirleft. 

Wait, no. The direction d in the action is the direction the agent moves from l_p to l_from, and the stone moves from l_from to l_to. So for the agent to push the stone from pos12 to pos11 (dirup), the agent must move from l_p to pos12 via direction d, and the stone moves from pos12 to pos11 via direction d. 

But pos12 to pos11 is via dirup. Therefore, the agent must be at a position l_p such that moving direction d (dirup) from l_p reaches pos12. The only such position is pos22 (south of pos12). But moving dirup from pos22 to pos12 is not allowed according to movement connections. The allowed move from pos22 to pos12 is dirleft. 

Therefore, it's impossible to push the stone from pos12 to pos11 using the pushtogoal action, because there's no valid direction d where both the agent can move from l_p to pos12 via d, and the stone can move from pos12 to pos11 via d. 

This is a problem. The only way to move from pos12 to pos11 is via dirup, but the agent can't move to pos12 via dirup from any position. Because according to movement connections, pos22 can move to pos12 via dirleft, and pos13 can move to pos12 via dirup. 

Ah, pos13 is east of pos12. From pos13, moving dirleft to pos12. Then, the stone can be pushed dirup from pos12 to pos11. So the agent is at pos13, direction d is dirleft. 

So action pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirleft.

Preconditions:

(i) agent at pos13 (yes)

(ii) stone at pos12 (yes)

(iii) pos11 is clear (yes)

(iv) can move from pos13 to pos12 via dirleft (yes, movement connection: "You may move from location pos13 to location pos12 following direction dirup" — wait, no. The movement connections for pos13:

"You may move from location pos13 to location pos23 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos13 to location pos12 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos13 to location pos14 following direction dirdown"

So moving from pos13 to pos12 is via dirup, not dirleft. Therefore, the direction d would be dirup. So the action would be:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirup.

Preconditions:

(i) agent at pos13 (yes)

(ii) stone at pos12 (yes)

(iii) pos11 is clear (yes)

(iv) can move from pos13 to pos12 via dirup (yes)

(v) can move from pos12 to pos11 via dirup (yes)

(vi) pos11 is a goal (yes)

So this action is valid.

After this, the stone is at pos11 (goal), agent is at pos12. 

This completes the task.

Putting it all together:

The sequence of actions would be:

1. Agent moves from pos55 to pos54 (dirup)
2. Agent moves from pos54 to pos53 (dirup)
3. Push stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft) using pushtonongoal
4. Agent moves from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown)
5. Agent moves from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft)
6. Push stone from pos33 to pos23 (dirup) using pushtonongoal
7. Agent moves from pos34 to pos33 (dirup)
8. Agent moves from pos33 to pos23 (dirup)
9. Push stone from pos23 to pos13 (dirup) using pushtonongoal
10. Agent moves from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown)
11. Agent moves from pos24 to pos14 (dirleft)
12. Push stone from pos13 to pos12 (dirup) using pushtonongoal
13. Agent moves from pos14 to pos13 (dirup)
14. Push stone from pos12 to pos11 (dirup) using pushtogoal

But this seems too long. Let's check if there's a shorter path.

Alternative path:

1. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft
2. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos33 dirleft
4. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos23 dirup
6. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirup
8. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft
9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirup
10. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
11. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirup

But step 3: pushtonongoal from pos44 to pos43 via dirleft? Let's check:

pos44's movement connections: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft" — so moving dirleft from pos44 to pos34. Not pos43. So that's incorrect. 

Step 3 should be:

Agent is at pos44. To push the stone from pos43 to pos33, the agent must be able to move from pos44 to pos43 via direction d. According to movement connections, pos44 can move to pos43 via dirup. 

So the correct action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos33 dirup.

Then, after pushing, the agent is at pos43. 

So revised steps:

1. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft
2. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos33 dirup
4. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
5. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos23 dirup
7. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirup
9. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft
10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirup
11. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
12. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirup

This has 12 steps. But maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternative approach:

After step 3, the stone is at pos33, agent at pos43.

Agent can move from pos43 to pos33 dirup (but stone is there, can't). So agent moves to pos44, then to pos34, then pushtonongoal pos33 to pos23.

But this seems necessary.

Alternatively, after pushing to pos33, agent moves to pos34, then pushes to pos23.

So steps:

1. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft
2. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos33 dirup
4. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos23 dirup
6. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirup
8. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft
9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirup
10. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
11. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirup

This is 11 actions. Is there a shorter path?

Another approach: after pushing the stone to pos33, instead of moving around, push it further directly.

After step 3, agent is at pos43. Can the agent move to pos33's east (pos43 is row4, column3. pos33 is row3, column3. So to push pos33 to pos23, the agent needs to be at pos43's north (row3, column3), which is pos33. But pos33 has the stone. So agent can't move there. So agent must go around.

Alternative path:

Agent moves from pos55 to pos53 via pos54:

1. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
2. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirleft
4. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
5. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos23 dirup
7. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirup
9. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft
10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirup
11. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
12. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirup

This is also 12 steps. 

But perhaps there's a more optimal path. Let's think of the minimal steps:

The stone needs to move from pos43 to pos33, pos23, pos13, pos12, pos11. Each push requires one action. So 5 pushes. The agent needs to move between positions to set up each push. Each push requires the agent to be in a specific position, which may require movement steps. 

So for each push, there's one action, plus possibly some move actions. The minimal number of actions would be 5 pushes plus necessary moves. 

Let's see:

1. Move from pos55 to pos53: 2 moves (pos55 → pos54 → pos53)

2. Push to pos33: 1 action

3. Move to pos34: 2 moves (pos43 → pos44 → pos34)

4. Push to pos23: 1 action

5. Move to pos24: 1 move (pos34 → pos24)

6. Push to pos13: 1 action

7. Move to pos14: 1 move (pos24 → pos14)

8. Push to pos12: 1 action

9. Move to pos13: 1 move (pos14 → pos13)

10. Push to pos11: 1 action

Total: 2+1+2+1+1+1+1+1+1+1= 11 actions.

But maybe some moves can be optimized. For example, after pushing to pos33 (action 2), the agent is at pos43. Then move to pos44 (1 move), then to pos34 (1 move). So that's 2 moves.

Then, after pushing to pos23 (action4), agent is at pos33. Then move to pos34 (dirright?), but movement from pos33 to pos34 is dirright (check movement connections for pos33: "You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright" — no. From pos33, movement connections:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown"

Wait, no. The movement connections for pos33:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirright"

Wait, no. According to the problem's movement connections:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown"

So from pos33, dirleft to pos23, dirright to pos43, dirup to pos32, dirdown to pos34.

So after pushing to pos23, the agent is at pos33. To get to pos34, they can move dirdown to pos34 (action5).

So:

After step4 (push to pos23), agent is at pos33.

5. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos23 pos13 dirup

But pos23 is at (2,3), pushing dirup to pos13 (1,3). 

Wait, from pos23, dirup leads to pos13. Yes, movement connection: "You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirup".

So action6: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos23 pos13 dirup.

Preconditions:

(i) agent at pos34 (yes)

(ii) stone at pos23 (yes)

(iii) pos13 is clear (yes)

(iv) move from pos34 to pos23 via dirup — from pos34 to pos23 is dirup? According to movement connections for pos34: "You may move from location pos34 to location pos33 following direction dirup". So no, pos34 can't move to pos23 via dirup. 

This indicates a mistake. Therefore, this approach is invalid.

Thus, after pushing to pos23, the agent is at pos33. To push pos23 to pos13, the agent must be at pos23's south (pos33), move dirup into pos23, pushing to pos13. 

But the agent is already at pos33. So action pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup.

Preconditions:

(i) agent at pos33 (yes)

(ii) stone at pos23 (yes)

(iii) pos13 is clear (yes)

(iv) move from pos33 to pos23 via dirup — movement connection from pos33 to pos23 is dirleft, not dirup. According to the problem's movement connections for pos33: "You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft".

So direction d must be dirleft. Therefore, the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirleft.

But moving from pos33 to pos23 via dirleft is allowed. Then, the stone moves from pos23 to pos13 via dirleft. But according to movement connections for pos23: "You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirup". Therefore, dirleft is not a valid direction from pos23 to pos13. 

Thus, this action is invalid. 

This indicates that the agent can't push the stone from pos23 to pos13 via dirleft. 

Therefore, the agent must find another way to push the stone from pos23 to pos13. 

The only valid direction from pos23 to pos13 is dirup. So the agent must be at pos23's south (pos33) and move dirup into pos23, pushing the stone dirup to pos13. 

But moving from pos33 to pos23 via dirup is allowed? According to movement connections for pos33: "You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft". So no, moving dirup from pos33 leads to pos32. 

This is a problem. Therefore, the agent can't push the stone from pos23 to pos13 directly. 

This suggests that the initial approach of pushing the stone up through pos42, pos32, etc., might be more feasible, even though it's longer. 

Given the complexity and time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial plan that involves pushing the stone up from pos43 to pos42, then to pos32, pos22, pos12, and finally to pos11. 

The sequence of actions would be:

1. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft

2. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup

4. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirdown

5. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos42 pos32 dirup

Wait, no. After pushing to pos42, the agent is at pos43. To push to pos32, the agent needs to be at pos42's south (pos43), move up to pos42, pushing to pos32. 

So:

After step3:

- Agent is at pos43

4. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos42 pos32 dirup

But stone is at pos42 after step3. 

Wait, after step3, the stone is at pos42. Agent is at pos43. 

Step4: move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup. But pos42 has the stone. Agent can't move there. 

Therefore, this approach is invalid. 

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I'll settle on the plan that involves moving the stone left to pos33, then up to pos23, etc., even if it's longer, as it's the only valid path I can find.
