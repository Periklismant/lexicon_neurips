Okay, let's see. I need to find a plan to move stone1 to a goal location. The only goal location given is pos45. So the target is to get stone1 to pos45.

First, let's check where everything is. The initial state says the agent (player1) is at pos25, and stone1 is at pos32. The goal is pos45, which is a goal location. So the stone needs to move from pos32 to pos45.

Looking at the movement paths. Let's figure out the path from the agent's starting position (pos25) to the stone's location (pos32). Then, from there, how to push the stone to pos45.

From pos25, the possible moves are dirleft (to pos15), dirright (to pos35), or dirup (to pos24). Wait, the movement options from pos25 are:

- You may move from pos25 to pos15 following direction dirleft.
- You may move from pos25 to pos35 following direction dirright.
- You may move from pos25 to pos24 following direction dirup.

So the agent is at pos25. To reach pos32, which is where the stone is, the agent needs to move towards that area. Let's map out the grid. Let's imagine the grid as 5x5, with pos11 to pos55.

pos32 is in row3, column2. The agent is at pos25 (row2, column5). Hmm, so how to get from pos25 to pos32? Let's look at the movement connections.

From pos25, moving right (dirright) would take the agent to pos35. Then from pos35, moving up (dirup) would take to pos34? Wait, let me check the movement options for each location.

Looking at pos25's connections:

- move to pos15 (dirleft)
- move to pos35 (dirright)
- move to pos24 (dirup)

From pos35, the movement options are:

- dirleft to pos25
- dirright to pos45
- dirup to pos34.

So from pos25, moving right to pos35. Then from pos35, moving up to pos34. Then from pos34, moving left to pos24? Or perhaps another direction. Wait, let's check the movement from pos34:

- pos34 can go dirleft to pos24, dirright to pos44, dirup to pos33, or dirdown to pos35.

Wait, but the agent needs to get to pos32. Let's see. pos32 is in row3, column2. So starting at pos25 (row2, column5), the path needs to go through various positions.

Alternative approach: To reach pos32, the agent needs to go from pos25 to pos24 (dirup), then to pos23 (dirup?), but let's check:

From pos25, moving up (dirup) leads to pos24. Then from pos24, the possible moves are:

- dirleft to pos14
- dirright to pos34
- dirup to pos23
- dirdown to pos25.

Wait, moving up from pos24 would be to pos23. From pos23, moving up to pos22, then pos22 to pos32? Let's check.

Wait, pos23's movements:

- dirleft to pos13
- dirright to pos33
- dirup to pos22
- dirdown to pos24.

So from pos23, moving right would take to pos33, which is in row3, column3. Hmm. Alternatively, moving up to pos22. From pos22, moving right to pos32? Let's check pos22's movements:

pos22's connections:

- dirleft to pos12
- dirright to pos32
- dirup to pos21
- dirdown to pos23.

Yes, from pos22, moving right (dirright) takes to pos32. But how to get from pos25 to pos22?

Let me outline a possible path:

pos25 → pos24 (dirup) → pos23 (dirup) → pos22 (dirup) → pos32 (dirright). But wait, from pos22, moving right is to pos32. So the agent can get to pos22 and then move right to pos32. But wait, the agent can only move to adjacent locations if there's a direction specified.

Wait, the movement from pos22 to pos32 is allowed via dirright. So yes. So the path would be:

1. move player1 from pos25 to pos24 (dirup)
2. move from pos24 to pos23 (dirup)
3. move from pos23 to pos22 (dirup)
4. move from pos22 to pos32 (dirright). But wait, the stone is at pos32. So the agent can't move into a location that's occupied by the stone. Because the preconditions for move require that the destination is clear. Since stone1 is at pos32, pos32 is not clear. So the agent can't move directly into pos32. Therefore, the agent can't move into pos32 via the move action. Instead, the agent needs to be adjacent to the stone to push it.

So the stone is at pos32. The agent needs to be in a position adjacent to pos32 to push it. Let's see where the agent can be to push the stone. The adjacent positions to pos32 are: pos22 (up), pos31 (left), pos33 (right), pos42 (down). But according to the movement connections, from pos32:

- You can move to pos22 (dirleft?), wait, let's check the connections for pos32.

Looking at the movement options:

From pos32, the allowed moves are:

- dirleft to pos22
- dirright to pos42
- dirup to pos31
- dirdown to pos33.

Wait, no. Wait the movement directions are specific. The movement from pos32 to pos22 is via dirleft. From pos32 to pos42 via dirright. From pos32 to pos31 via dirup. From pos32 to pos33 via dirdown.

So the agent needs to be in one of these adjacent positions to push the stone. But the agent can't move into pos32 because it's occupied by the stone. So the agent needs to approach from an adjacent cell.

So, let's plan the path. The agent starts at pos25. How can the agent get to a position adjacent to pos32, so that they can push the stone towards the goal (pos45).

The goal pos45 is at row4, column5. So the stone needs to move from pos32 (row3, column2) to pos45 (row4, column5). That's a diagonal path, but moving in steps.

Let's think about the path for the stone. To get from pos32 to pos45, it needs to move right and down. Let's see:

pos32 → pos33 (dirdown) → pos34 (dirdown) → pos35 (dirdown) → pos45 (dirright from pos35). Wait, but the movement for the stone would require being pushed by the agent. So each push action moves the stone one cell in a direction, and the agent must be in the cell opposite the direction of the push.

For example, to push the stone from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown), the agent needs to be at pos32's up cell (pos22) and push down. Wait, no. Wait, the "pushtogoal" or "pushtonongoal" actions require that the agent is at l_p, the stone is at l_from, and the direction allows moving from l_p to l_from (so adjacent). Then, the direction d is the direction from l_from to l_to. So for example, if the agent is at pos22 (l_p), the stone is at pos32 (l_from), and they want to push it down (dirdown) to pos33 (l_to), then the direction from l_p (pos22) to l_from (pos32) is dirright. So the agent moves from pos22 to pos32 (dirright) to push the stone down to pos33. But wait, the stone is already at pos32. So the agent can't be at pos32. Wait, no. The agent is at l_p (pos22), the stone is at l_from (pos32). The direction from l_p to l_from is dirright. So that's allowed. Then, the direction from l_from to l_to (pos33) is dirdown. So the action would be pushtonongoal (since pos33 is not a goal) with direction dirdown. Then, after pushing, the agent ends up at pos32, the stone is at pos33.

But wait, the preconditions for pushtogoal/pushtonongoal require that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from. So, in this case, l_p is pos22, l_from is pos32, direction from l_p to l_from is dirright. Then, the direction from l_from to l_to is dirdown. So that's valid.

But the problem is getting the agent to pos22. The agent starts at pos25. Let's find a path from pos25 to pos22.

From pos25, possible moves:

- dirup to pos24
- dirleft to pos15
- dirright to pos35.

If we go up to pos24, then from pos24, possible moves:

- dirup to pos23
- dirleft to pos14
- dirright to pos34.

From pos24 to pos23 (dirup), then pos23 to pos22 (dirup). Then, agent is at pos22. Then, can push the stone from pos32 to pos33 via dirdown. But pos33 is not a goal, so use pushtonongoal. Then, the stone is at pos33. Then, from there, push it again towards pos34 (dirdown), and so on until reaching pos35, then pushing right to pos45 (if possible).

Wait, pos35's right direction is pos45. Let me check: from pos35, dirright leads to pos45. Yes. So pushing the stone from pos35 to pos45 (dirright) would be valid, and since pos45 is a goal location, we use pushtogoal.

So the steps would be:

1. Agent moves from pos25 to pos24 (dirup)
2. Agent moves from pos24 to pos23 (dirup)
3. Agent moves from pos23 to pos22 (dirup)
4. Agent pushes stone1 from pos22 (l_p) to pos32 (l_from) to pos33 (l_to) with direction dirdown (pushtonongoal)
5. Agent is now at pos32, stone1 is at pos33.
6. Then, the agent needs to push the stone from pos33 to pos34. To do this, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos33. Since the agent is at pos32 after step 4, which is adjacent to pos33 (pos32 is up of pos33?), wait pos32 is row3, column2. pos33 is row3, column3. So the agent is at pos32 (step 4's end). To push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown), the agent needs to be at pos33's up cell, which is pos23. Wait, no. Wait, the agent needs to be adjacent to the stone's current position (pos33). So the agent can be at pos23 (up), pos32 (left), pos34 (right), or pos43 (down). But the agent is currently at pos32. So can the agent push the stone from pos33 from the left (pos32) to the right (pos34)? Let's check.

The direction from l_p (pos32) to l_from (pos33) would be dirright (since pos33 is to the right of pos32). Then, the direction from l_from to l_to (pos34) would be dirdown? Wait, pos33 to pos34 is dirdown. Wait, let me check the movement connections for pos33. The movement options from pos33 are:

- dirleft to pos23, dirright to pos43, dirup to pos32, dirdown to pos34. So pos33 can move down (dirdown) to pos34.

So the agent is at pos32. To push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown), the agent would need to be in a position adjacent to pos33. But pos32 is to the left of pos33. So the direction from pos32 to pos33 is dirright. So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown. Wait, but in that case, l_p is pos32, l_from is pos33, direction from l_p to l_from is dirright. Then, direction d is dirdown (from pos33 to pos34). So that's valid. Let me check the preconditions for pushtonongoal:

i) agent p is at l_p (pos32) → yes, after step 4, the agent is at pos32.

ii) stone s is at l_from (pos33) → yes, after step 4, stone1 is at pos33.

iii) l_to (pos34) is clear. Initially, pos34 is clear as per the initial state.

iv) can move from l_p (pos32) to l_from (pos33) via direction dirright. Yes, because movement from pos32 to pos33 is allowed via dirdown? Wait, wait, the movement connections from pos32 to pos33: according to the given movements, pos32 can move to pos33 via dirdown. Wait, let's check the movement directions again.

Looking back: "You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown". So from pos32 to pos33 is direction dirdown. Wait, but that would mean that pos32 is above pos33. Hmm, perhaps the grid is structured with rows increasing downward. So pos11 is row1, column1. pos12 is row1, column2. pos21 is row2, column1. So pos32 is row3, column2. pos33 is row3, column3. pos34 is row3, column4. pos35 is row3, column5. Then, moving down from pos32 (row3, column2) would take you to pos42 (row4, column2). Wait, this seems conflicting. Let me clarify the grid layout.

The movement directions can be confusing. Let's parse the movement connections carefully.

For example, "You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft". So moving dirleft from pos32 leads to pos22. That suggests that pos32 is to the right of pos22. So pos22 is column2, row2. pos32 is column3, row2? Wait, that doesn't fit. Maybe the positions are labeled as posXY where X is the row and Y is the column. So pos22 is row2, column2. pos32 is row3, column2. So moving left from pos32 would take to pos22 (same row, column2 to column2?), no. Wait, maybe the directions are different. For example, dirleft could mean moving left in the same row, dirright right in the same row, dirup up in the same column, dirdown down in the same column.

Alternatively, perhaps the grid is laid out such that each position is connected in the four cardinal directions. So pos11 (row1, column1) is connected to pos12 (right), pos21 (down), etc. But the movement directions might be labeled in terms of the grid.

But perhaps I should not get stuck on that and instead look at the specific movement connections.

Looking at movement from pos32:

- You may move from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft)
- You may move from pos32 to pos42 (dirright)
- You may move from pos32 to pos31 (dirup)
- You may move from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown)

Wait, that's confusing. So from pos32, dirleft takes you to pos22 (which is up one row?), dirright takes to pos42 (down one row?), dirup takes to pos31 (left one column?), dirdown takes to pos33 (right one column?).

Alternatively, maybe the directions are not based on standard grid directions but are defined by the movement connections. For example, moving dirleft from pos32 takes you to pos22, which is in row2, column2. So pos32 is row3, column2, and moving dirleft takes you to row2, column2 (pos22). That would suggest that dirleft is moving up, but that doesn't align with standard directions. This could be a possible confusion here.

Alternatively, perhaps the directions are defined as follows:

- dirup: move up a row (row decreases by 1)
- dirdown: move down a row (row increases by 1)
- dirleft: move left a column (column decreases by 1)
- dirright: move right a column (column increases by 1)

But given the movement from pos32 to pos22 via dirleft, which would imply that pos22 is to the left of pos32. If pos32 is (row3, column2), then pos22 is (row2, column2). So dirleft from pos32 would be to the same column but up a row, which doesn't make sense. Hmm. This is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the movement directions are as per the movement connections listed. For example, from pos32, dirleft is to pos22. So if pos32 is in row3, column2, then pos22 is row2, column2. So dirleft here is moving up. Then dirright from pos32 is to pos42 (row4, column2), so that's moving down. dirup from pos32 is to pos31 (row3, column1), so that's moving left. dirdown from pos32 is to pos33 (row3, column3), moving right. So the directions are:

- dirleft: up
- dirright: down
- dirup: left
- dirdown: right

This seems counterintuitive, but given the movement connections, that's how it's structured. For example, from pos32 to pos22 via dirleft (up), to pos42 via dirright (down), to pos31 via dirup (left), to pos33 via dirdown (right). So in this grid, dirleft and dirright are along the rows (up and down the rows), while dirup and dirdown are along the columns (left and right). Wait, no. Let me take another example.

Looking at pos11:

- "You may move from pos11 to pos21 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from pos11 to pos12 following direction dirdown"

So pos11 is connected to pos21 (dirright) and pos12 (dirdown). pos21 is row2, column1. pos12 is row1, column2. So dirright from pos11 takes you to pos21 (row2, column1), which is down a row. dirdown from pos11 takes you to pos12 (row1, column2), which is right a column. So this suggests that:

- dirright: down a row (same column)
- dirdown: right a column (same row)
- Similarly, dirleft would be up a row, dirup would be left a column.

So the directions are as follows:

- dirright: move down a row (row increases)
- dirleft: move up a row (row decreases)
- dirdown: move right a column (column increases)
- dirup: move left a column (column decreases)

So for example, from pos32 (row3, column2):

- dirleft (up a row) → pos22 (row2, column2)
- dirright (down a row) → pos42 (row4, column2)
- dirup (left a column) → pos31 (row3, column1)
- dirdown (right a column) → pos33 (row3, column3)

This seems to be the case. So the directions are:

- dirleft: row decreases by 1 (up)
- dirright: row increases by 1 (down)
- dirup: column decreases by 1 (left)
- dirdown: column increases by 1 (right)

This is a bit unconventional, but given the movement connections provided, this must be the case.

With this understanding, let's re-examine the path.

The agent starts at pos25 (row2, column5). The goal is to get the stone from pos32 (row3, column2) to pos45 (row4, column5), which is a goal location.

First, the agent needs to reach a position adjacent to the stone (pos32). Let's see the adjacent positions:

- Up (dirleft): pos22 (row2, column2)
- Down (dirright): pos42 (row4, column2)
- Left (dirup): pos31 (row3, column1)
- Right (dirdown): pos33 (row3, column3)

So to push the stone towards the goal, which is at pos45 (row4, column5), the agent needs to push the stone right (dirdown) towards column3, then column4, then column5, and then down (dirright) from row3 to row4.

Wait, but pos45 is in row4, column5. So to get there, the stone needs to move from row3, column2 to row3, column3 (dirdown), then column4, then column5. Then, move down (dirright) to row4, column5 (pos45).

So the path for the stone would be:

pos32 → pos33 (dirdown) → pos34 (dirdown) → pos35 (dirdown) → pos45 (dirright)

But wait, pos35 is row3, column5. From pos35, dirright would move down a row to pos45 (row4, column5).

So pushing the stone from pos35 to pos45 via dirright.

Now, the agent needs to be in a position adjacent to the stone at each step to push it. Let's plan how to move the agent to these positions.

Starting from pos25 (row2, column5):

1. Move to pos24 (dirup from pos25 to pos24). dirup here means column decreases by 1. So pos25 is row2, column5. dirup (column decreases) would take to column4: pos24 (row2, column4). Wait, no. Wait, according to the movement connections, from pos25, moving dirup (column decreases) would go to pos24. So pos24 is row2, column4.

Wait, perhaps the positions are labeled with the first digit as the row and the second as the column. So pos25 is row2, column5. So dirup from pos25 (column5) would decrease column by 1 to column4: pos24 (row2, column4). Then, dirup again from pos24 to pos23 (row2, column3). Then dirup to pos22 (row2, column2). From pos22, dirright (down a row) to pos32 (row3, column2).

Wait, but the agent can't move into pos32 because the stone is there. So instead, the agent can reach pos22 (row2, column2) and then push the stone from pos32 (row3, column2) down (dirright) to pos42 (row4, column2). But that's not helpful because pos42 is not on the path to pos45. Alternatively, maybe push the stone right (dirdown) to pos33 (row3, column3).

Wait, let's clarify:

Agent is at pos22 (row2, column2). The stone is at pos32 (row3, column2). To push the stone in a certain direction:

- If the agent is at pos22 (row2, column2), the stone is at pos32 (row3, column2). The direction from the agent to the stone is dirright (down a row). So to push the stone in a direction, the agent must be adjacent to the stone in the direction opposite to the push. For example, to push the stone down (dirright) to pos42 (row4, column2), the agent must be at pos32 (row3, column2), but that's where the stone is. Wait, no. The agent needs to be adjacent to the stone. Let's think.

The action "pushtogoal" requires that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to the stone's current position (l_from). The direction from l_p to l_from must be valid.

So, if the stone is at pos32 (row3, column2), the agent can be at pos22 (row2, column2), which is dirleft (up) from pos32. Then, the direction from pos22 to pos32 is dirright (down). So the agent can push the stone in the dirright (down) direction to pos42 (row4, column2). Or push in another direction.

Alternatively, if the agent is at pos31 (row3, column1), which is dirup (left) from pos32 (row3, column2), then the direction from pos31 to pos32 is dirdown (right). So the agent can push the stone dirdown (right) to pos33 (row3, column3).

So, the agent can reach pos31 and push the stone to pos33. But how to get to pos31 from pos25?

Alternatively, the agent can reach pos22 and push the stone down to pos42, but that's away from the goal. So perhaps better to push the stone to the right (dirdown) from pos32 to pos33.

To push the stone from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown, i.e., right), the agent needs to be on the left side of the stone (pos32's dirup, which is pos31). Because the direction from l_p to l_from (pos32) would be dirdown (right). Wait, no. Let's think again.

The agent must be at l_p, adjacent to l_from (stone's current position) via a direction. For example, if the stone is at pos32, and the agent is at pos31 (row3, column1), then the direction from pos31 to pos32 is dirdown (right). So the agent can push the stone from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown, right) with the action pushtonongoal, since pos33 is not a goal.

But how does the agent get to pos31?

The agent starts at pos25 (row2, column5). To reach pos31 (row3, column1):

That's quite a distance. Let's see possible paths.

From pos25, moving dirup (column decreases) to pos24 (row2, column4). Then dirup to pos23 (row2, column3). Then dirup to pos22 (row2, column2). Then dirleft (up) to pos12 (row1, column2). Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, from pos25, move dirright (down) to pos35 (row3, column5). From pos35, move dirup (column decreases) to pos34 (row3, column4). Continue moving dirup to pos33 (row3, column3), then pos32 (row3, column2), but the stone is there. So can't.

Alternatively, from pos25, move dirright (down) to pos35 (row3, column5). Then move dirleft (up) to pos25 again? No. Wait, perhaps a different route.

Alternatively, move from pos25 to pos35 (dirright), then from pos35 to pos34 (dirup), pos34 to pos33 (dirup), pos33 to pos32 (dirup), but pos32 is occupied by the stone. So can't.

Alternatively, agent needs to go to pos31 (row3, column1). How? Let's see.

From pos25, move dirright (down) to pos35 (row3, column5). Then move dirup (left in column) to pos34 (row3, column4), pos33 (row3, column3), pos32 (row3, column2), pos31 (row3, column1). But pos32 is occupied by the stone. So agent can't move through pos32. So this path is blocked.

Another approach: from pos25, move dirup (column4) to pos24 (row2, column4). Then dirup to pos23 (row2, column3). Then dirup to pos22 (row2, column2). Then dirleft (up) to pos12 (row1, column2). Not helpful. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to push the stone down (dirright) to pos42 (row4, column2), then move the agent to push it right (dirdown) towards column3, etc. But pos42 is a non-goal, and pushing the stone there would require more steps. But let's explore.

Agent is at pos25. Move dirright (down) to pos35 (row3, column5). Then move dirup (left) to pos34 (row3, column4), then to pos33 (row3, column3), but pos33 is clear. Wait, but the stone is at pos32. So agent can't get to pos33. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal path is to push the stone from pos32 to pos33, then to pos34, pos35, then to pos45. To do that, the agent needs to be on the left side (pos31, pos32's dirup) to push right (dirdown). Or from the top (pos22) to push down (dirright).

But getting to pos22 seems more feasible.

Let me outline steps:

1. Move player1 from pos25 to pos24 (dirup)
2. Move from pos24 to pos23 (dirup)
3. Move from pos23 to pos22 (dirup)
4. Now at pos22. From here, push the stone from pos32 to pos42 (dirright). But pos42 is not on the path to the goal. Alternatively, push the stone to pos33 (dirdown). Wait, but how?

Wait, the agent is at pos22 (row2, column2). The stone is at pos32 (row3, column2). The direction from pos22 to pos32 is dirright (down a row). So the agent can push the stone in the dirright (down) direction to pos42 (row4, column2). Or in another direction. Wait, the action's direction is the direction from l_from to l_to.

So to push the stone from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown, i.e., right), the direction from pos32 to pos33 is dirdown. But the agent is at pos22 (row2, column2), which is dirright (down) from pos32. So can the agent push the stone in a different direction?

The action requires that the agent is at l_p (pos22), the stone is at l_from (pos32), and that the direction from l_p to l_from is dirright (down). Then, the direction from l_from to l_to must be a valid direction. For example, if we want to push the stone to pos33 (right), the direction from pos32 to pos33 is dirdown (right), but the agent is at pos22. So can the agent push the stone in that direction?

Yes, if the preconditions are met. So the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos33 dirdown

Check the preconditions:

i) agent is at pos22: yes.

ii) stone1 is at pos32: yes.

iii) pos33 is clear: initially, yes.

iv) can move from pos22 to pos32 via dirright: yes (from the movement connections, pos22 to pos32 via dirright).

v) can move from pos32 to pos33 via dirdown: yes.

vi) pos33 is not a goal: yes, since only pos45 is a goal.

So this action is valid. After this action:

- Agent moves from pos22 to pos32 (now agent is at pos32)
- Stone moves from pos32 to pos33
- pos33 is no longer clear.

Then, the next step is to push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown). For that, the agent is at pos32. The stone is at pos33. So the agent needs to be adjacent to pos33. The possible positions are pos23 (dirleft, up), pos32 (dirup, left), pos34 (dirdown, right), pos43 (dirright, down).

The agent is at pos32. The direction from pos32 to pos33 is dirdown (right). So the agent is to the left of pos33. To push the stone to pos34 (right), the agent needs to be at pos33's left (which is pos32). So the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown

Check preconditions:

i) agent is at pos32: yes.

ii) stone1 is at pos33: yes.

iii) pos34 is clear: yes.

iv) can move from pos32 to pos33 via dirdown: yes.

v) can move from pos33 to pos34 via dirdown: yes.

vi) pos34 is not a goal: yes.

This is valid. After this, the agent is at pos33, stone is at pos34.

Next, push from pos34 to pos35 (dirdown). Agent is at pos33. So:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown

Check:

i) agent at pos33: yes.

ii) stone at pos34: yes.

iii) pos35 clear: yes.

iv) direction from pos33 to pos34: dirdown (right) → valid.

v) direction from pos34 to pos35: dirdown (right) → yes.

vi) pos35 not a goal: yes.

After this, agent is at pos34, stone at pos35.

Finally, push from pos35 to pos45 (dirright, down a row). Now, pos45 is a goal. So we use pushtogoal.

The agent is at pos34 (row3, column4). The stone is at pos35 (row3, column5). To push it to pos45 (row4, column5), the agent needs to be at pos35's up (dirleft) or down (dirright) or left (dirup) or right (dirdown). 

Wait, the agent is at pos34 (row3, column4). To push the stone from pos35 to pos45 (dirright, down a row), the agent must be adjacent to pos35. pos35 is row3, column5. So adjacent positions are:

- pos25 (row2, column5) via dirleft (up)
- pos45 (row4, column5) via dirright (down)
- pos34 (row3, column4) via dirup (left)
- pos36 (doesn't exist) via dirdown (right) 

Wait, pos35's connections are:

- dirleft to pos25 (row2, column5)
- dirright to pos45 (row4, column5)
- dirup to pos34 (row3, column4)
- dirdown to pos35's right would be beyond the grid.

So the agent is at pos34 (row3, column4). To reach a position adjacent to pos35 (row3, column5), the agent can move from pos34 to pos35 via dirdown (right). But pos35 has the stone initially. Wait, after previous steps, the stone is at pos35. So pos35 is occupied by the stone. So the agent can't move into pos35. 

So the agent needs to be at pos34 (row3, column4) and push the stone from pos35 to pos45. But how?

Wait, the agent needs to be at pos35's left (pos34) to push it right (dirdown) to pos35's right. But pos35's right is pos45 via dirright (down a row). So direction from pos35 to pos45 is dirright (down).

So the agent is at pos34 (row3, column4), which is dirup (left) from pos35 (row3, column5). To push the stone from pos35 to pos45, the agent needs to be at pos35's left (pos34). So the direction from pos34 to pos35 is dirdown (right). So the action would be:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos35 pos45 dirright

Check preconditions:

i) agent is at pos34: yes.

ii) stone is at pos35: yes.

iii) pos45 is clear: yes.

iv) can move from pos34 to pos35 via dirdown (right): yes (movement from pos34 to pos35 is dirdown? Let's check the movement connections for pos34.

Looking at the given connections:

- pos34 can move to pos24 via dirleft (up)
- pos34 can move to pos44 via dirright (down)
- pos34 can move to pos33 via dirup (left)
- pos34 can move to pos35 via dirdown (right)

Yes, movement from pos34 to pos35 is via dirdown (right).

v) movement from pos35 to pos45 via dirright (down): yes.

vi) pos45 is a goal: yes.

So this action is valid. After this, the stone is at pos45 (goal), and the agent is at pos35.

Thus, the complete plan would be:

1. move player1 from pos25 to pos24 (dirup)
2. move player1 from pos24 to pos23 (dirup)
3. move player1 from pos23 to pos22 (dirup)
4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos33 dirdown
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown
7. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos35 pos45 dirright

But wait, after step 4, the agent is at pos32. So step 5 would start from pos32. Let's check:

Step 4: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos33 dirdown.

After this, the agent is at pos32. The stone is at pos33.

Step 5: push from pos33 to pos34. So the agent must be adjacent to pos33. The agent is at pos32. The direction from pos32 to pos33 is dirdown (right). So the action is pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown. That's valid.

After this, the agent is at pos33. The stone is at pos34.

Step 6: push from pos34 to pos35. The agent is at pos33. The direction from pos33 to pos34 is dirdown (right). So the action is pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown. Valid.

After this, agent is at pos34, stone at pos35.

Step 7: push from pos35 to pos45. Agent is at pos34. The direction from pos34 to pos35 is dirdown (right). So the action is pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos35 pos45 dirright. Valid.

This results in the stone being at pos45, the goal location.

So the total steps are 7 actions. But is there a shorter path?

Let's see. Can we combine some steps?

Alternative approach: After step 4, the stone is at pos33. The agent is at pos32. Then, instead of pushing to pos34, can the agent move to pos33 and push from there? But pos33 is occupied by the stone. So no.

Alternatively, after step 4, agent is at pos32. Can the agent move to pos33? But pos33 has the stone now. So no. So steps 4-7 are necessary.

Is there a way to reduce the number of moves?

Let's see the initial plan:

1. move from pos25 to pos24 (dirup)
2. move to pos23 (dirup)
3. move to pos22 (dirup)
4. push stone1 to pos33 (dirdown)
5. push to pos34
6. push to pos35
7. push to pos45.

Total 7 steps. Is this the shortest possible?

Alternative path: Can the agent reach pos35 directly and push the stone from pos32 to pos45 via some other route?

For example, if the stone can be pushed upwards (dirleft) from pos32 to pos22, but that's not helpful. Or pushed right to pos33, then down to pos43, etc. But that would take more steps.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can take a different path to reach the stone's adjacent position.

Another possible approach: From pos25, move right (dirright) to pos35. Then move up (dirup) to pos34, then pos33, then pos32. But pos32 is occupied by the stone. So the agent can't move into pos32. So this path is blocked.

Alternatively, agent moves from pos25 dirright to pos35. Then move dirup to pos34 (row3, column4), then dirup to pos33 (row3, column3). Then, from pos33, push the stone from pos32 to pos33 (but the stone is already at pos32; the agent is at pos33. To push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent. But the agent is at pos33, and the stone is at pos32. The direction from pos33 to pos32 is dirup (left). So the agent could push the stone left to pos31, but that's not helpful.

So the initial plan seems to be the optimal path. 7 steps. Let me check if any steps can be optimized.

Wait, step 1: move pos25 to pos24 (dirup). Step 2: pos24 to pos23 (dirup). Step3: pos23 to pos22 (dirup). Three move actions. Then three pushtonongoal actions and one pushtogoal. Total 7 actions. Could there be a shorter path by taking a different route to reach pos22?

For example, from pos25 to pos24 (dirup), then to pos23 (dirup), then pos22 (dirup). Three steps. Is there a shorter path? Let's see:

From pos25, can the agent move directly to pos22? According to the movement connections, pos25's moves are pos15, pos35, pos24. So no. So three steps are needed to reach pos22.

After that, pushing the stone requires four steps (pushtonongoal three times, pushtogoal once). So total of 7 steps.

Is there a way to reduce this?

Wait, after the first push (step4), the agent is at pos32. Then, step5 requires pushing from pos32 to pos33. Then step6 from pos33 to pos34. Step7 from pos34 to pos35. Then step8 to pos45. Wait no, step7 is from pos34 to pos45. Let me count again.

No, step7 is pushing from pos35 to pos45. So after step6, the stone is at pos35. So step7 requires the agent to be at pos34 to push from pos35 to pos45. So the agent must move from pos34 to pos35's adjacent cell. Wait, no: after step6, the agent is at pos34 (since pushing from pos34 to pos35 would leave the agent at pos35? Wait, no. Let me recheck the effects of the pushtonongoal action.

When you perform pushtonongoal, the agent moves from l_p to l_from. So in step6:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown.

Here, l_p is pos33, l_from is pos34, l_to is pos35. So the agent was at pos33. After the action, the agent is at pos34, and the stone is at pos35.

Then step7 is pushtogoal from pos34 to pos35 to pos45. So yes, the agent is at pos34.

So steps are:

1-3: move to pos22.

4: push to pos33.

5: push to pos34.

6: push to pos35.

7: push to pos45.

Total 7 steps. Can any steps be merged or skipped?

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos33, can the agent move to a different position to push the stone to pos34 in fewer steps?

But the agent is at pos32 after step4. To push the stone to pos34, the agent must be adjacent to pos33. So agent is at pos32, which is adjacent to pos33 (right). So step5 is possible.

Alternatively, is there a way to push the stone from pos33 to pos34 in one step, avoiding a push?

No, each push moves the stone one cell.

Thus, the plan seems to be optimal with 7 steps. Let's verify again each step's preconditions and effects to ensure validity.

Step1: move player1 from pos25 to pos24 dirup.

Preconditions: agent at pos25 (yes), pos24 clear (yes), can move from pos25 to pos24 via dirup (yes).

Effects: agent leaves pos25, arrives pos24.

Step2: move player1 from pos24 to pos23 dirup.

Pre: agent at pos24, pos23 clear, path exists.

Yes, pos23 is clear initially.

Step3: move player1 from pos23 to pos22 dirup.

Pre: agent at pos23, pos22 clear, path exists.

Yes.

Step4: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos33 dirdown.

Pre: agent at pos22, stone at pos32, pos33 clear, can move from pos22 to pos32 via dirright (yes), can move from pos32 to pos33 via dirdown (right) (yes), pos33 is non-goal.

Effects: agent now at pos32, stone at pos33, pos32 clear.

Step5: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown.

Pre: agent at pos32, stone at pos33, pos34 clear, can move from pos32 to pos33 via dirdown (yes), can move from pos33 to pos34 via dirdown (right) (yes), pos34 non-goal.

Effects: agent now at pos33, stone at pos34.

Step6: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown.

Pre: agent at pos33, stone at pos34, pos35 clear, path exists.

Effects: agent at pos34, stone at pos35.

Step7: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos35 pos45 dirright.

Pre: agent at pos34, stone at pos35, pos45 clear, path from pos34 to pos35 (dirdown/right), path from pos35 to pos45 (dirright/down), pos45 is goal.

Yes. After this, stone is at pos45.

All steps are valid, and this seems to be the shortest possible plan.
