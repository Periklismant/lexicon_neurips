Alright, I'm given a Sokoban-like planning problem. The goal is to move a stone to a goal location. Let's break down the problem:

1. The grid is 5x5, with positions labeled as pos11, pos12, ..., pos55. The first digit is the row, the second is the column.
2. There's one agent (player1) and one stone (stone1).
3. The player starts at pos25, and the stone starts at pos32.
4. The goal location is pos45.

Let's try to visualize the grid:

```
1 (pos11) (pos12) (pos13) (pos14) (pos15)
2 (pos21) (pos22) (pos23) (pos24) (pos25)-player1
3 (pos31) (pos32)-stone1 (pos33) (pos34) (pos35)
4 (pos41) (pos42) (pos43) (pos44) (pos45)-goal
5 (pos51) (pos52) (pos53) (pos54) (pos55)
```

I need to come up with a plan that moves the stone to the goal (pos45), and also satisfies a bunch of constraints. Let's review the constraints:

1. Location pos33 must not be clear at least once. This means the stone or the player must be at pos33 at some point.
2. Location pos42 must not be clear in at most one continuous sequence (i.e., it can be occupied once, but then must stay clear). So the player or stone can occupy it once, but not come back to it.
3. Location pos53 must not be clear at least once.
4. Location pos44 must not be clear at least once.
5. If pos44 is not clear, then either pos51 is not clear or the stone is at pos34, either in the same state or afterward.
6. player1 must be at pos51 at least once.
7. Location pos45 must not be clear at least once.
8. If pos45 is not clear, then pos43 must not be clear either in the same state or in some state afterward.
9. Location pos41 must not be clear in at most one continuous sequence.
10. player1 must be at pos54 at least once.
11. Location pos31 must not be clear in at most one continuous sequence.
12. Location pos42 must not be clear at least once.
13. If pos42 is not clear, there must be an earlier state where player1 is at pos15.

Let's think about how to satisfy the goal: The stone needs to be at the goal location (pos45), which is in the 4th row, 5th column. The stone starts at pos32 (3rd row, 2nd column). I need to push the stone from pos32 to pos45. Since the stone can only be pushed (not pulled), I need to approach the stone from the opposite side of the direction I want to push it.

To push the stone to pos45, a direct path would be: pos32 -> pos33 -> pos34 -> pos35 -> pos45. But I also have the constraints to satisfy.

Let's first try to find a rough plan that gets the stone to the goal location (pos45):

1. Move player1 from pos25 to a position adjacent to the stone (e.g., pos33).
2. Push the stone in the desired direction.
3. Continue pushing the stone until it reaches the goal location.

But there's more to it because of the constraints. Let's think about a valid plan step by step, considering the constraints:

1. player1 starts at pos25.
2. The stone is at pos32.
3. I need to go to pos15 at some point (Constraint 13).
4. After going to pos15, I need to make pos42 not clear at some point. That could be either the player or the stone.
5. I also need to visit pos51 and pos54.
6. The stone needs to eventually be at pos45 (the goal).

Let's start by plotting a path to pos15 from pos25. Since the player moves one step at a time, I would move from pos25 to pos15 by going: pos25 -> pos24 -> pos23 -> pos22 -> pos21 -> pos11 -> pos12 -> pos13 -> pos14 -> pos15.

From pos15, I'd need to get to a position where I can push the stone. The stone is at pos32. I would need to approach it from pos31 or pos33 or pos22 or pos42, depending on which direction I want to push it.

Let's try to approach from pos33, because I need to pass through pos33 to satisfy constraint 1. The path from pos15 to pos33 would be: pos15 -> pos25 -> pos35 -> pos34 -> pos33.

Now, with player1 at pos33 and the stone at pos32, I can push the stone to pos31 (using the "pushtonongoal" action). After that, I'm at pos32 and the stone is at pos31. This also satisfies constraint 11, as pos31 will have the stone (so it's not clear).

From there, I need to maneuver so that I can push the stone toward the goal. I can move to pos33, pos23, pos22, pos21, and then to pos31. With player1 at pos31 and the stone also at pos31, I can push the stone to pos41 (pushtonongoal). This satisfies constraint 9, as pos41 is now not clear.

From there, I'm at pos31 and the stone is at pos41. I can move to pos32, pos33, pos43, pos42, pos41. With player1 at pos41 and the stone also at pos41, I can push the stone to pos42 (pushtonongoal). This satisfies constraint 12 because pos42 is not clear.

Now, I'm at pos41 and the stone is at pos42. Constraint 2 requires that pos42 is occupied at most once, so I need to continue pushing the stone. I can move to pos42 and push the stone to pos43 (pushtonongoal).

Now, I'm at pos42 and the stone is at pos43. I can move to pos43 and push the stone to pos44 (pushtonongoal). This satisfies constraint 4, as pos44 is not clear.

Now, I'm at pos43 and the stone is at pos44. According to constraint 5, if pos44 is not clear, then either pos51 should not be clear or the stone should be at pos34 in the same state or later. I need to ensure one of those conditions is satisfied.

I can move to pos44 and push the stone to pos45 (pushtogoal), which would achieve the main goal. After this, I will be at pos44 and the stone will be at pos45. While this satisfies constraint 7 (pos45 is not clear), I need to make sure constraint 8 is also satisfied: if pos45 is not clear, then pos43 must not be clear in the same state or later.

Now, after pushing the stone to pos45, I can move to pos43 (satisfying constraint 8), and then to pos53 (satisfying constraint 3). From pos53, I can move to pos54 (satisfying constraint 10), and then to pos51 (satisfying constraint 6).

Let me formalize this plan based on the actions available, and then check if it satisfies all the constraints.

Starting state:
- player1 is at pos25
- stone1 is at pos32

Planned actions:
1. move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
2. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
3. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
4. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
5. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
6. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
7. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
8. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
9. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown
10. move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright
11. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright
12. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup
13. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup

At this point:
- player1 is at pos33
- stone1 is at pos32

14. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirleft

After this:
- player1 is at pos32
- stone1 is at pos31

15. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
16. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
17. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
18. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
19. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright

At this point:
- player1 is at pos31
- stone1 is at pos31

But that can't be right. The stone and the player can't occupy the same position. I think I've made an error. Let me reconsider.

Actually, I don't think I've understood the dynamics correctly. If the stone is at a position, then that position isn't "clear", so both the player and the stone can't be at the same position. Let's re-read the problem statement.

Ah, I think I misunderstood the structure. Based on the actions, the player is pushing the stone from a position adjacent to it. For the "pushtonongoal" action, the player is at location l_p, the stone is at location l_from, and we're pushing it to location l_to. The player moves to l_from, and the stone moves to l_to.

Let me reconsider my plan.

Actually I made an error. The player (player1) starts at pos25, and the stone starts at pos32. The player and stone are not at the same position.

Let's correctly visualize the grid:

```
1 (pos11) (pos12) (pos13) (pos14) (pos15)
2 (pos21) (pos22) (pos23) (pos24) (pos25)-player1
3 (pos31) (pos32)-stone1 (pos33) (pos34) (pos35)
4 (pos41) (pos42) (pos43) (pos44) (pos45)-goal
5 (pos51) (pos52) (pos53) (pos54) (pos55)
```

I need to satisfy constraint 13 first: "If pos42 is not clear, there must be an earlier state where player1 is at pos15." So, I'd like to go to pos15 first, and then at some point make pos42 not clear.

Let's replan:

Starting state:
- player1 is at pos25
- stone1 is at pos32

Planned actions:
1. move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
2. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
3. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
4. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
5. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
6. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
7. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
8. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
9. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown

Now I've satisfied constraint 13, and I'm at pos15. I want to push the stone to the goal, so I need to approach the stone.

10. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
11. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
12. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright
13. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
14. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirleft

Now I'm at pos32, right next to the stone at pos32. This isn't right, since the stone is at pos32. Let me reconsider.

I should be more careful. Here's the actual plan:

Starting state:
- player1 is at pos25
- stone1 is at pos32

Planned actions:
1. move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
2. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
3. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
4. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
5. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
6. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
7. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
8. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
9. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown

I've now satisfied the condition to later satisfy constraint 13. I want to push the stone to the goal.

10. move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright
11. move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
12. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
13. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
14. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright

OK this is wrong again. The stone is at pos32, so the player can't be at pos32. The confusion is from the visual representation I tried to create earlier. Let's re-do this.

The player starts at pos25, and the stone starts at pos32. I want to push the stone to the goal pos45.

First, I need to satisfy constraint 13 by going to pos15.

1. move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft

Next, I need to get into a position to push the stone. The stone is at pos32. I can approach it from pos22, pos31, pos33, or pos42, to push it in the respective directions: up, left, right, down.

I want to push the stone toward the goal, which is at pos45. So, I'd push it from pos31 to make it go right, or from pos42 to make it go up.

2. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
3. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
4. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
5. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright

Now I'm at pos33, and the stone is at pos32. I can push it to the right.

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos33 dirright

After this, I'm at pos32 and the stone is at pos33. This satisfies constraint 1 (pos33 is not clear).

Now, I want to push the stone further toward the goal. I can approach it from below (pos23), to push it upward to pos34.

7. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft
8. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos34 dirright

After this, I'm at pos33 and the stone is at pos34. Constraint 5 requires that if pos44 is not clear, then either pos51 is not clear or the stone is at pos34. So, the second part of this constraint is fulfilled.

Let's continue to push the stone toward the goal.

10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown

After this, I'm at pos34 and the stone is at pos35.

11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos35 pos45 dirright

After this, I'm at pos35 and the stone is at pos45. Now, the stone is at the goal, satisfying the main objective. This also satisfies constraint 7 (pos45 is not clear).

Constraint 8 says: "If pos45 is not clear, then pos43 must not be clear in the same state or after." Let's make sure this is satisfied by moving to pos43. I can get there from pos35 by moving to pos34, then pos44, then pos43.

12. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup
13. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
14. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

Now I'm at pos43, satisfying constraint 8.

Let's check the remaining constraints and see how we can satisfy them:

- Constraint 2: pos42 must be not clear at most once. I can satisfy this by moving from pos43 to pos42 and then not returning to pos42.
- Constraint 3: pos53 must not be clear. I can satisfy this by moving from pos42 to pos43, then to pos53.
- Constraint 4: pos44 must not be clear. I've already passed through pos44 when going from pos34 to pos43.
- Constraint 6: player1 must be at pos51. I can move there from pos53.
- Constraint 9: pos41 must not be clear at most once. I can satisfy this by passing through pos41.
- Constraint 10: player1 must be at pos54. I can move there from pos53.
- Constraint 11: pos31 must not be clear at most once. I haven't used pos31 yet, so I can pass through it.
- Constraint 12: pos42 must not be clear. I can satisfy this by moving to pos42 from pos43 (which I'll do anyway for constraint 2).

Let's continue our plan:

15. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup

Now I'm at pos42, satisfying constraint 12 (pos42 is not clear). Since I've been at pos15 earlier, I also satisfy constraint 13.

16. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup

Now I'm at pos41, satisfying constraint 9 (pos41 is not clear).

17. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft

Now I'm at pos31, satisfying constraint 11 (pos31 is not clear).

18. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown
19. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
20. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
21. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright

Now I'm at pos53, satisfying constraint 3 (pos53 is not clear).

22. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown

Now I'm at pos54, satisfying constraint 10 (player1 is at pos54).

23. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
24. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup
25. move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup

Now I'm at pos51, satisfying constraint 6 (player1 is at pos51).

Let's check if we've satisfied all the constraints now:

1. Location pos33 must not be clear at least once: Satisfied when stone1 is at pos33 after step 6.
2. Location pos42 must not be clear in at most one continuous sequence: Satisfied when player1 is at pos42 at step 15. After that, player1 doesn't go back to pos42.
3. Location pos53 must not be clear at least once: Satisfied when player1 is at pos53 at step 21.
4. Location pos44 must not be clear at least once: Satisfied when player1 is at pos44 at step 13.
5. If pos44 is not clear, then either pos51 is not clear or the stone is at pos34: When player1 is at pos44 (step 13), we later ensure stone1 is at pos34 (after step 9), so this is satisfied.
6. player1 must be at pos51 at least once: Satisfied at step 25.
7. Location pos45 must not be clear at least once: Satisfied when stone1 is at pos45 after step 11.
8. If pos45 is not clear, then pos43 must not be clear in the same state or after: When stone1 is at pos45 (after step 11), we later ensure player1 is at pos43 (step 14), so this is satisfied.
9. Location pos41 must not be clear in at most one continuous sequence: Satisfied when player1 is at pos41 at step 16. After that, player1 doesn't go back to pos41.
10. player1 must be at pos54 at least once: Satisfied at step 22.
11. Location pos31 must not be clear in at most one continuous sequence: Satisfied when player1 is at pos31 at step 17. After that, player1 doesn't go back to pos31.
12. Location pos42 must not be clear at least once: Satisfied when player1 is at pos42 at step 15.
13. If pos42 is not clear, there must be an earlier state where player1 is at pos15: When player1 is at pos42 (step 15), it's already been at pos15 (step 9), so this is satisfied.

All the constraints appear to be satisfied. Let's finalize the plan.

Wait, I think this plan should be even more efficient. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

Actually, I made a "mistake" (it doesn't break the correctness but adds unnecessary steps):
The action "move p l_from l_to d" means the agent moves from l_from to l_to in direction d. It's not the case that we can go from pos25 to pos15 in a single action. The places need to be adjacent. The direction d tells us from which side we're approaching.

Let me correct my plan:

Starting state:
- player1 is at pos25
- stone1 is at pos32

Given a 5x5 grid, let me re-illustrate it:

```
     1     2     3     4     5
1  pos11  pos12  pos13  pos14  pos15
2  pos21  pos22  pos23  pos24  pos25*
3  pos31  pos32s  pos33  pos34  pos35
4  pos41  pos42  pos43  pos44  pos45g
5  pos51  pos52  pos53  pos54  pos55
```

where * is the player (pos25), s is the stone (pos32), and g is the goal (pos45).

Planned actions:
1. move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
2. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
3. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
4. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
5. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
6. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
7. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
8. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
9. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown

Now I've satisfied the condition for constraint 13. I want to push the stone toward the goal. I'll move back to a position near the stone.

10. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
11. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
12. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
13. move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright
14. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright

But this won't work because the stone is at pos32 and the position isn't clear. Let me reconsider.

10. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
11. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
12. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
13. move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright
14. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
15. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright

Now I'm at pos33 and can push the stone to the right.

16. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirleft

After this, I'm at pos32 and the stone is at pos31. This satisfies constraint 11 (pos31 is not clear).

Moving to push the stone toward the goal:

17. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup
18. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
19. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright

Now I'm at pos31, and I can push the stone down.

20. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos31 pos41 dirdown

Hmm, this action isn't allowed because I'm not at an adjacent position to the stone. Let me reconsider.

Actually, I think I can just do this:

17. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft

Now I'm at pos31, and I can push the stone down.

18. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos31 pos41 dirdown

This still doesn't work. What's happening? Let me re-analyze the actions:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.

Preconditions include:
- agent p is at location l_p
- stone s is at location l_from
- location l_to is clear
- you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d
- you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d
- location l_to is a goal location.

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Similar, but l_to is not a goal location.

OK, I think I've been confused about the exact mechanics of the "push" actions. Let's think about this more carefully.

The player starts at pos25, and the stone starts at pos32. To push the stone, the player needs to be adjacent to the stone and on the opposite side of the direction of push.

For instance, if I want to push the stone from pos32 to pos33 (to the right), I need the player to be at pos31 (to the left of the stone). And the preconditions state that I need to be able to get from pos31 to pos32 following the direction (right in this case).

Let me redo the plan:

Starting state:
- player1 is at pos25
- stone1 is at pos32

First, I need to satisfy constraint 13 by going to pos15.

1. move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
2. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
3. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
4. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
5. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
6. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
7. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
8. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
9. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown

Now I need to get to a position where I can push the stone. I want to push it toward the goal, so I'll approach it from the opposite side of the goal direction.

10. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
11. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
12. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
13. move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright
14. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
15. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright

Now I'm at pos31, and I can push the stone to the right.

16. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright

After this, I'm at pos32 and the stone is at pos33. This satisfies constraint 1 (pos33 is not clear).

From here, I want to continue pushing the stone to the goal.

17. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright

After this, I'm at pos33 and the stone is at pos34. Constraint 5 requires that if pos44 is not clear, then either pos51 is not clear or the stone is at pos34. Since the stone is now at pos34, the second part of this constraint can be fulfilled if we make pos44 not clear later.

18. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirright

After this, I'm at pos34 and the stone is at pos35.

19. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos35 pos45 dirright

After this, I'm at pos35 and the stone is at pos45 (the goal). This satisfies the main objective and constraint 7 (pos45 is not clear).

Constraint 8 says: "If pos45 is not clear, then pos43 must not be clear in the same state or after." Let's satisfy this by moving to pos43.

20. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup
21. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
22. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright

Now I'm at pos43, satisfying constraint 8.

Let's check the remaining constraints:

- Constraint 2: pos42 must be not clear at most once.
- Constraint 3: pos53 must not be clear.
- Constraint 4: pos44 must not be clear.
- Constraint 6: player1 must be at pos51.
- Constraint 9: pos41 must not be clear at most once.
- Constraint 10: player1 must be at pos54.
- Constraint 11: pos31 must not be clear at most once. (Satisfied at step 15)
- Constraint 12: pos42 must not be clear.

Let's continue the plan to satisfy these:

23. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup

Now I'm at pos42, satisfying constraint 12 (pos42 is not clear). Since I've been at pos15 earlier, I also satisfy constraint 13.

24. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup

Now I'm at pos41, satisfying constraint 9 (pos41 is not clear).

Next, I want to move to pos44 (to satisfy constraint 4) and then to pos54 (to satisfy constraint 10), and after that, I want to end at pos51 (to satisfy constraint 6) while also visiting pos53 on the way (to satisfy constraint 3).

25. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
26. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
27. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown

Now I'm at pos44, satisfying constraint 4 (pos44 is not clear). Since the stone is at pos34 just after step 17, constraint 5 is fully satisfied.

28. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
29. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright

Now I'm at pos53, satisfying constraint 3 (pos53 is not clear).

30. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown

Now I'm at pos54, satisfying constraint 10 (player1 is at pos54).

31. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
32. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup
33. move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup

Now I'm at pos51, satisfying constraint 6 (player1 is at pos51).

Let's check:

1. Location pos33 must not be clear at least once: Satisfied when I'm at pos33 after step 16 or 17.
2. Location pos42 must not be clear in at most one continuous sequence: Satisfied when I'm at pos42 at steps 23 & 25.
3. Location pos53 must not be clear at least once: Satisfied when I'm at pos53 at steps 29 & 31.
4. Location pos44 must not be clear at least once: Satisfied when I'm at pos44 at step 27.
5. If pos44 is not clear, then either pos51 is not clear or the stone is at pos34: When I'm at pos44 (step 27), the stone has already been at pos34 (after step 17), so this is satisfied.
6. player1 must be at pos51 at least once: Satisfied at step 33.
7. Location pos45 must not be clear at least once: Satisfied when stone1 is at pos45 after step 19.
8. If pos45 is not clear, then pos43 must not be clear in the same state or after: When stone1 is at pos45 (after step 19), I later ensure I'm at pos43 (steps 22, 26, 28), so this is satisfied.
9. Location pos41 must not be clear in at most one continuous sequence: Satisfied when I'm at pos41 at step 24. After that, I don't go back to pos41.
10. player1 must be at pos54 at least once: Satisfied at step 30.
11. Location pos31 must not be clear in at most one continuous sequence: Satisfied when I'm at pos31 at step 15. After that, I don't go back to pos31.
12. Location pos42 must not be clear at least once: Satisfied when I'm at pos42 at steps 23 & 25.
13. If pos42 is not clear, there must be an earlier state where player1 is at pos15: When I'm at pos42 (steps 23 & 25), I've already been at pos15 (step 9), so this is satisfied.

Actually, I'm slightly concerned about the constraints 2, 9, and 11 which say that certain locations must not be clear "in at most one continuous sequence." It's possible that I might have misunderstood this. Let me re-read them.

I think the intent is that we shouldn't have a situation where, for example, pos42 is not clear, then it becomes clear, and then it's not clear again. We should have pos42 not be clear for at most one continuous sequence of states.

Currently in my plan, pos42 is not clear at steps 23 & 25. It's clear in between (at step 24). This violates constraint 2 because pos42 is not clear in more than one continuous sequence.

Similarly, I might be violating constraint at other points.

Let me replan such that I don't have these issues. 

No, I've approached this problem incorrectly. Let's break down these constraints again:

- "Location pos42 must not be clear in at most one continuous sequence": This means that pos42 can be not clear (i.e., occupied by player or stone) for at most one continuous sequence of states. It doesn't mean that pos42 must be not clear in a continuous sequence.

Given this, I need to ensure that once I make pos42 clear (by leaving it), I never make it not clear again. The same applies to pos41 (constraint 9) and pos31 (constraint 11).

Let me redo the plan with these constraints in mind:

Starting state:
- player1 is at pos25
- stone1 is at pos32

First, I need to satisfy constraint 13 by going to pos15.

1. move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
2. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
3. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
4. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
5. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
6. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
7. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
8. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
9. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown

Now I need to get to a position where I can push the stone. I want to push it toward the goal, so I'll approach it from the opposite side of the goal direction.

10. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
11. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
12. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
13. move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright
14. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
15. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright

Now I'm at pos31, and I can push the stone to the right. I need to be careful to make sure I don't make pos31 not clear again later because of constraint 11.

16. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright

After this, I'm at pos32 and the stone is at pos33. This satisfies constraint 1 (pos33 is not clear).

From here, I want to continue pushing the stone to the goal.

17. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright

After this, I'm at pos33 and the stone is at pos34. Constraint 5 requires that if pos44 is not clear, then either pos51 is not clear or the stone is at pos34. Since the stone is now at pos34, the second part of this constraint can be fulfilled if we make pos44 not clear later.

18. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirright

After this, I'm at pos34 and the stone is at pos35.

19. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos35 pos45 dirright

After this, I'm at pos35 and the stone is at pos45 (the goal). This satisfies the main objective and constraint 7 (pos45 is not clear).

Constraint 8 says: "If pos45 is not clear, then pos43 must not be clear in the same state or after." Let's satisfy this by moving to pos43.

20. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup
21. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
22. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright

Now I'm at pos43, satisfying constraint 8.

Let's check the remaining constraints:

- Constraint 2: pos42 must be not clear at most once.
- Constraint 3: pos53 must not be clear.
- Constraint 4: pos44 must not be clear.
- Constraint 6: player1 must be at pos51.
- Constraint 9: pos41 must not be clear at most once.
- Constraint 10: player1 must be at pos54.
- Constraint 11: pos31 must not be clear at most once. (Satisfied at step 15-16)
- Constraint 12: pos42 must not be clear.

I need to be careful here. I need to satisfy constraints 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, and 12, while not violating constraints 2, 9, and 11. I've used up my chance to make pos31 not clear, so I can't do that anymore.

Let me plan the rest of the steps:

23. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown

Now I'm at pos44, satisfying constraint 4 (pos44 is not clear). Since the stone is at pos34 just after step 17, constraint 5 is fully satisfied.

24. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright

Now I'm at pos54, satisfying constraint 10 (player1 is at pos54).

25. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup

Now I'm at pos53, satisfying constraint 3 (pos53 is not clear).

26. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft

Now I'm at pos43 again.

27. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup

Now I'm at pos42, satisfying constraint 12 (pos42 is not clear). Since I've been at pos15 earlier, I also satisfy constraint 13. Since this is the first time I'm making pos42 not clear, I'm not violating constraint 2 (pos42 must be not clear at most once).

28. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup

Now I'm at pos41, satisfying constraint 9 (pos41 is not clear). Since this is the first time I'm making pos41 not clear, I'm not violating constraint 9 (pos41 must be not clear at most once).

29. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright

Now I'm at pos51, satisfying constraint 6 (player1 is at pos51).

Let's check if all constraints are satisfied:

1. Location pos33 must not be clear at least once: Satisfied when I'm at pos33 after step 16 or 17 or 21.
2. Location pos42 must not be clear in at most one continuous sequence: Satisfied when I'm at pos42 at step 27, and I don't go back to pos42 after leaving.
3. Location pos53 must not be clear at least once: Satisfied when I'm at pos53 at step 25.
4. Location pos44 must not be clear at least once: Satisfied when I'm at pos44 at step 23.
5. If pos44 is not clear, then either pos51 is not clear or the stone is at pos34: When I'm at pos44 (step 23), the stone has already been at pos34 (after step 17), so this is satisfied.
6. player1 must be at pos51 at least once: Satisfied at step 29.
7. Location pos45 must not be clear at least once: Satisfied when stone1 is at pos45 after step 19.
8. If pos45 is not clear, then pos43 must not be clear in the same state or after: When stone1 is at pos45 (after step 19), I later ensure I'm at pos43 (steps 22, 26), so this is satisfied.
9. Location pos41 must not be clear in at most one continuous sequence: Satisfied when I'm at pos41 at step 28, and I don't go back to pos41 after leaving.
10. player1 must be at pos54 at least once: Satisfied at step 24.
11. Location pos31 must not be clear in at most one continuous sequence: Satisfied when I'm at pos31 at step 15, and I don't go back to pos31 after leaving.
12. Location pos42 must not be clear at least once: Satisfied when I'm at pos42 at step 27.
13. If pos42 is not clear, there must be an earlier state where player1 is at pos15: When I'm at pos42 (step 27), I've already been at pos15 (step 9), so this is satisfied.

All the constraints are now satisfied, and the goal is achieved. Here's the final list of actions to solve the problem:
