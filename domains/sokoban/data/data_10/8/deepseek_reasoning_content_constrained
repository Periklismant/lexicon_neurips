Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. First, I need to understand the initial state, the goal, and all the constraints. The goal is to have stone1 at a goal location. The only goal location mentioned is pos31. So stone1 starts at pos23, which is not a goal, and needs to end up at pos31.

The agent starts at pos54. The available actions are moving and pushing stones either to goal or non-goal locations. Let's map out the grid. The locations are from pos11 to pos55 in a 5x5 grid. The movement directions allow moving up, down, left, right between adjacent cells as specified in the 'may move' statements.

Now, the constraints are a bit complex. Let's list them:

1. Player must be at pos12 in at least one state.
2. If player is at pos12 in some state, then pos25 must be not clear (occupied) in that state or later.
3. pos53 must be not clear in at least one state.
4. pos24 being not clear can only be true in at most one continuous sequence.
5. In at least one state, either stone1 is at pos33 or pos25 is not clear.
6. pos44 being not clear can't be in more than one continuous sequence.
7. Player can never be at pos22.
8. Player must be at pos23 in at least one state.
9. If player is at pos23, then either player is at pos55 or pos44 is not clear in that state or later.
10. pos11 not clear can only be in one continuous sequence.
11. At least once, stone1 is at pos24 or pos25.
12. At least once, pos43 is not clear or stone1 is at pos55.

Hmm. So, the plan must satisfy all these constraints while moving the stone to pos31. Let's start by figuring out the path for the stone. From pos23 to pos31. The possible path would be pos23 → pos33 → pos43 → pos44 → pos34 → pos33 → ... Wait, no. Let me check the movement connections.

Looking at the 'may move' statements, pos23 can go to pos13 (left), pos33 (right), pos22 (up), or pos24 (down). But pos23 to pos33 is allowed via direction dirright. Then from pos33, can we move right to pos43? Yes. Then pos43 can go to pos53 (right), or left back to pos33. From pos43, moving left would take us back. Wait, but pos43's connections: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft" and "You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright". So, pos43 is in the middle of row 4. To get to pos31, which is in row 3, column 1. Wait, pos31 is row3, column1. So the stone is at pos23 (row2, column3). To get to pos31 (row3, column1), the stone needs to move left twice and down once? Or maybe up and left? Let me see.

Wait, pos31 is the goal. Let me check the grid layout again. The positions are named posXY where X is the row and Y the column. So pos11 is row1, column1. pos23 is row2, column3. pos31 is row3, column1.

So the stone is at pos23. To get to pos31, the path could be: pos23 → pos24 (down) → pos34 (right) → pos33 (up) → pos32 (up) → pos31 (left). Wait, but how? Let me check the movement directions.

Wait, stones can be pushed by the agent. The agent can push the stone in a direction if the agent is adjacent in the opposite direction. For example, to push the stone from pos23 to pos24 (down), the agent must be at pos23 and push down, moving the stone to pos24 and the agent ends up at pos24. Wait, no. Wait, the push actions require the agent to be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's current position). The direction d is the direction from l_from to l_to. So, for example, if the agent is at pos24 (which is below pos23), and the stone is at pos23, then the agent could push the stone upwards to pos13? Wait, no. Wait, the direction is from l_p to l_from. So for pushing, the agent is at l_p, which must be adjacent to l_from (stone's location), and then the stone is moved in direction d from l_from to l_to. So for example, if the agent is at pos22 (north of pos23), they can push the stone south (dirdown) to pos24. But pos22 to pos23 is allowed? Let me check the movement possibilities. The initial state says that pos23 is clear, so the agent can move there if needed.

Wait, the initial state has the agent at pos54. The stone is at pos23. The agent needs to navigate to the stone to push it. Let's think about the path from pos54 to pos23. The agent is at pos54. They can move up to pos53, then up to pos52, then up to pos51. But maybe a better path. Let's see the movement connections for pos54: can move left to pos44, up to pos53, or down to pos55. To get to pos23, the agent needs to go through pos44, then pos34, etc. Let me map the possible path.

From pos54, moving left (dirleft) to pos44. Then from pos44, moving left (dirleft) to pos34. Then pos34 left to pos24, then pos24 left to pos14. Then pos14 left to pos13. Wait, but pos44 can go to pos34 via dirleft? Wait, the 'may move' statements: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft". Yes. So pos44 to pos34 (left). Then pos34 to pos24 (left), then pos24 to pos14 (left), but wait, pos14 is row1, column4. Hmm, perhaps not the right path. Alternatively, from pos44, moving up to pos43 (dirup?), no. Wait, the movement directions are based on the direction specified. For example, from pos44, moving dirleft would go to pos34. Moving dirright would go to pos54. To get up, perhaps direction dirup? Let's check.

Looking at the movement connections, for pos44: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown".

So, from pos44, moving up (dirup) leads to pos43. Moving left (dirleft) to pos34. So, to get to pos23, the agent needs to go from pos44 to pos34 (left), then pos34 to pos24 (left), pos24 to pos23 (up?), or pos24 to pos14 (left). Wait, pos24's connections: "You may move from location pos24 to location pos14 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos24 to location pos34 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos24 to location pos23 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos24 to location pos25 following direction dirdown". So from pos24, moving up (dirup) leads to pos23. So agent could go from pos44 → pos34 (left), then pos34 → pos24 (left), then pos24 → pos23 (dirup). But then, the agent would be at pos23. However, the stone is at pos23. So the agent can't be at pos23 if the stone is there unless it's allowed. Wait, in the initial state, pos23 is clear, meaning the agent can move there. But once the agent is at pos23, they could push the stone.

Wait, but the stone is at pos23. So to push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos23. For example, if the agent is at pos24 (south of pos23), they could push the stone north (dirup) to pos13, but pos13 is a non-goal. Alternatively, pushing it east (dirright) to pos33. But for that, the agent would need to be at pos23's west (pos22) to push east. Wait, directions are a bit tricky here. Let me clarify.

The 'pushtogoal' and 'pushtonongoal' actions require the agent to be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (stone's current position), and the direction d is the direction from l_from to l_to. So for example, if the stone is at pos23, and the agent is at pos24 (south of pos23), the direction from l_p (pos24) to l_from (pos23) is dirup. Then, the direction from l_from (pos23) to l_to (pos24's direction?) Wait, no. The direction d in the push action is the direction from l_from to l_to. So, if the agent is at pos24 (south of pos23), and wants to push the stone south to pos24's direction down (dirdown) would be to pos24 → pos25? No. Wait, pos23's movement options: from pos23, you can go to pos13 (dirleft), pos33 (dirright), pos22 (dirup), pos24 (dirdown). So pushing the stone from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown) requires the agent to be at pos24's north, which is pos23. Wait, no. Wait, the agent must be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (pos23). So possible l_p positions are pos22 (up), pos24 (down), pos13 (left), pos33 (right). Then, the direction d is the direction from l_from to l_to, which must be accessible from l_from in direction d.

So, for example, if the agent is at pos22 (above pos23), and wants to push the stone down to pos24, then direction d is dirdown. The agent is at l_p=pos22, l_from=pos23, l_to=pos24. The preconditions are that the agent is at pos22, stone is at pos23, pos24 is clear, and there's a path from pos22 to pos23 (which is just adjacent, so direction dirdown?), but according to the 'may move' statements, from pos22 you can move to pos23 via dirdown. So the agent can move from pos22 to pos23. So for the push action, the agent is at pos22, and pushes the stone from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown). That would require that pos24 is clear. But in the initial state, pos24 is clear. So that's possible.

But the goal is to get the stone to pos31. So pushing it from pos23 to pos24 (south) would take it further away. Alternatively, pushing it to pos33 (east) would be a step towards pos31. Because pos33 is east of pos23, and pos33 can be moved left to pos32, then pos31. So perhaps that's a better path.

So, the agent needs to get to a position adjacent to pos23 to push it. Let's think about the path. The agent starts at pos54. Needs to move to pos23's adjacent positions. Let's plan the movement:

From pos54, move left (dirleft) to pos44. Then from pos44, move left (dirleft) to pos34. Then from pos34, left to pos24. Then from pos24, move up (dirup) to pos23. But wait, when the agent moves to pos23, that's where the stone is. Wait, but initially, pos23 is clear. So the agent can move there. But once the agent is at pos23, the stone is still there. Wait, no, the initial state says "stone1 is at location pos23" and "Location pos23 is clear". Wait, how is that possible? Because a location is clear if it doesn't have the agent or a stone. Wait, no. Wait, the initial state lists "Location pos23 is clear", which would mean that it's empty. But the stone is at pos23. Wait, that's a contradiction. Wait, looking back at the original state:

Original state includes:
- "stone1 is at location pos23"
- "Location pos23 is clear"

Wait, that can't be. Because if a stone is at pos23, then pos23 is not clear. So perhaps this is a mistake. Let me check again.

The original state says:

"player1 is at location pos54"

"stone1 is at location pos23"

Then, in the list of "Location ... is clear", it includes "Location pos23 is clear".

But that's a conflict. If the stone is at pos23, then pos23 should not be clear. So this must be a mistake in the problem statement. Or perhaps "clear" refers to being free of the agent. Wait, the problem statement says: "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So a location is clear if it's empty. Therefore, if a stone is at pos23, pos23 is not clear. So the problem statement has an error here. But according to the user's input, the original state includes both "stone1 is at pos23" and "Location pos23 is clear", which is contradictory. This is a problem. But assuming that the problem is correctly stated, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Wait, maybe "clear" refers to the agent not being there. But the problem says "each position may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty". So a location is clear if it's empty. So if a stone is there, it's not clear. Therefore, the original state has an inconsistency. But since the user provided this, I must proceed as if it's correct. Or maybe I misread. Let me check again.

Looking at the original state:

The user wrote:

"Location pos23 is clear"

But also:

"stone1 is at location pos23"

This is impossible. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe "clear" refers to the agent not being present, but stones don't block? But according to the problem statement, a location is clear if it's empty. So this must be an error. But since this is the given problem, perhaps it's a typo. Maybe "Location pos23 is not clear" was intended. Alternatively, maybe the stone is not at pos23. But according to the problem, stone1 is at pos23. So this is conflicting. This could be a critical error. But since I have to work with the given information, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that despite the stone being at pos23, pos23 is considered clear. That doesn't make sense, but perhaps the problem allows it. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake, but as a solver, I need to proceed with the given data.

Alternatively, maybe the initial state says that pos23 is clear except for the stone. Wait, but according to the problem's definition, if a stone is present, the location is not clear. Therefore, this seems like a contradiction. However, perhaps the problem's initial state is correct, and the "clear" status is separate from the presence of the stone. But that contradicts the problem's description. This is a problem. But given that, perhaps I need to proceed with the given data, assuming that pos23 is clear (no agent there) but the stone is there. But that's impossible according to the problem's own definitions. Therefore, this must be a mistake. But since the user provided this, perhaps the correct initial state is that pos23 is not clear, but the user wrote it as clear. Alternatively, maybe the stone is not there. But the user clearly says "stone1 is at location pos23".

This is a problem. But given that I have to proceed, I'll assume that the stone is at pos23, and pos23 is not clear (i.e., the initial state's mention of "Location pos23 is clear" is a mistake, and perhaps the correct initial state has pos23 not clear). Alternatively, maybe the user intended that the stone is at pos23 but pos23 is clear, which is impossible. Therefore, I'll proceed with the assumption that pos23 is not clear (since the stone is there), and that the user made a typo. But since the problem says "Location pos23 is clear", this will affect the preconditions of actions.

Wait, for the 'pushtogoal' action, one of the preconditions is that the stone is at l_from. So if the stone is at pos23, then l_from is pos23. But if pos23 is clear, that would mean it's empty, which can't be. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. This must be an error in the problem statement. But given that, perhaps the correct initial state is that pos23 is not clear. Therefore, the user's mention of "Location pos23 is clear" is a mistake, and pos23 is actually not clear. But how can I proceed? This is a critical issue because the agent's movement depends on whether locations are clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended that "clear" refers to the agent not being present, and stones don't affect the clearness. But according to the problem statement, "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty. Each position is flagged as either a goal position or a non-goal position. Your task is to manipulate the agent in order to move all stones to goal positions." So a location can have the agent, a stone, or be empty. Therefore, if a stone is present, the location is not clear (since it's not empty). Therefore, the original state's statement that pos23 is clear is incorrect. But since the problem states it, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that pos23 is clear despite the stone being there, which would be a contradiction. But then, the preconditions for pushing would require the stone to be at l_from (pos23), and that location l_from has the stone. So perhaps the 'clear' in the problem's initial state refers to the agent not being there, and stones are allowed. But according to the problem's own description, a location is clear if it's empty. So this is a contradiction.

Given this confusion, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the correct initial state is that pos23 is not clear. So I'll proceed under that assumption, even though the user wrote it as clear. Because otherwise, the problem is impossible. Therefore, assuming that pos23 is not clear (since the stone is there), the agent can't move into pos23 unless it's pushing the stone. So the agent's movement must avoid pos23 unless pushing.

But given that the user wrote "Location pos23 is clear", this is conflicting. So perhaps the user intended that the stone is at pos23, and pos23 is not clear, but mistakenly wrote it as clear. Or perhaps the stone is at a different location. But according to the problem, the stone is at pos23. Therefore, I'll have to assume that the user made a mistake, and that pos23 is not clear (occupied by the stone), and proceed accordingly.

So, the agent starts at pos54. The stone is at pos23, which is not clear. The agent needs to navigate to a position adjacent to pos23 to push it.

Possible path for the agent:

pos54 → pos44 (dirleft)
pos44 → pos34 (dirleft)
pos34 → pos24 (dirleft)
pos24 → pos23 (dirup) → but pos23 is occupied by the stone. Therefore, the agent can't move there. So, the agent must approach from another direction.

Alternative path: from pos54 to pos44 (left), then pos44 to pos43 (dirup). Then pos43 to pos33 (dirleft). Then pos33 to pos23 (dirleft). But pos23 is occupied by the stone. So agent can't move into pos23. Therefore, the agent must approach from a direction adjacent to pos23.

For example, pos22 is north of pos23. So the agent could go to pos22 and push the stone down to pos24. Or to pos24 and push up to pos23? Wait, no. To push the stone, the agent needs to be in a position adjacent to the stone.

So possible pushing directions:

If the agent is at pos22 (north of pos23), they can push the stone south (dirdown) to pos24. But pos24 must be clear. In the initial state, pos24 is clear. So that's possible.

Alternatively, agent at pos24 (south of pos23) can push north (dirup) to pos23, but the stone is already there. No, that's not possible.

Alternatively, agent at pos13 (west of pos23) can push east (dirright) to pos23. But the stone is already there, so that's not useful.

Wait, the stone is at pos23. The agent needs to push it to a goal location. The only goal location is pos31. So the stone needs to go from pos23 → pos33 (east), then pos33 → pos32 (west?), then pos32 → pos31 (west).

But how to get there.

First, the agent needs to get to a position adjacent to pos23. Let's see. To push the stone east to pos33, the agent must be west of pos23 (pos13) or north/south, but to push east, the agent needs to be west of the stone. So pos23's west is pos13. So agent must be at pos13 to push east to pos33.

But pos13 is in row1, column3. The agent starts at pos54 (row5, column4). The path to pos13 would be long. Let's see.

From pos54 → pos44 (left)
pos44 → pos43 (up)
pos43 → pos33 (left)
pos33 → pos23 (left) → but pos23 is occupied by stone. So can't move there. So agent needs to go around.

Alternative route: pos54 → pos44 (left)
pos44 → pos34 (left)
pos34 → pos24 (left)
pos24 → pos14 (left)
pos14 → pos13 (up). So from pos14 to pos13 via dirup. Let me check the movement connections. For pos14: "You may move from location pos14 to location pos24 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos14 to location pos13 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos14 to location pos15 following direction dirdown".

So yes, pos14 can move up to pos13. So agent could go from pos54 → pos44 → pos34 → pos24 → pos14 → pos13. Then, from pos13, push the stone east to pos23 → pos33. Wait, but the stone is already at pos23. So pushing east from pos23 to pos33. To do that, the agent must be at pos13 (west of pos23), and push east. But the stone is at pos23, so to push it east to pos33, the agent must be at pos23's west (pos13), and the direction from pos23 to pos33 is dirright. So the action would be pushtogoal or pushtonongoal, depending on the destination.

pos33 is not a goal location (as per the original state: "pos33 is not a goal location"). The only goal is pos31. So pushing the stone to pos33 would be to a non-goal location, so we need to use pushtonongoal. Then, from pos33, the stone needs to be moved west to pos32, then west to pos31 (which is a goal). 

But pos33 to pos32 is dirleft. So the agent would need to be east of pos33 (pos43) to push west to pos32. Then from pos32, west to pos31. So the agent would need to be east of pos32 (pos42) to push west to pos31.

So the plan would be:

1. Move agent from pos54 to pos44 (left)
2. Move to pos34 (left)
3. Move to pos24 (left)
4. Move to pos14 (left)
5. Move to pos13 (up)
6. Push stone from pos13 to pos23 to pos33 (east) using pushtonongoal, since pos33 is not a goal.
Wait, but the stone is already at pos23. Oh wait, the initial stone is at pos23. So the first push would be from pos23 to pos33. So the agent is at pos13, which is adjacent to pos23 (west side). So direction from l_p (pos13) to l_from (pos23) is dirright. Then direction from l_from to l_to (pos33) is dirright. So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirright.

But wait, the preconditions for pushtonongoal are that l_to is not a goal. pos33 is not a goal, so that's okay.

After this push, the stone is at pos33. Then, the agent is at pos23. Now, the stone is at pos33. Next, the agent needs to push it west to pos32. To do that, the agent must be east of pos33 (pos43). So the agent needs to move from pos23 to pos24 (down), then to pos34 (right), then to pos44 (right), then to pos43 (up). Wait, or from pos23, can the agent move east to pos33? No, because the stone is now at pos33. Wait, after the first push, the stone is at pos33, and the agent is at pos23. Then, the agent can move to pos24 (down), then pos34 (right), then pos44 (right), then pos43 (up). From pos43, the agent can push the stone west to pos33 → pos32. But wait, the stone is at pos33. So to push it west to pos32, the agent needs to be east of pos33 (pos43), push west (dirleft) to pos32. So action pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos32 dirleft. But pos32 is not a goal. Then, the stone is at pos32. Then, push west to pos31 (goal). So agent needs to be east of pos32 (pos42), push west. pos31 is a goal, so use pushtogoal.

But pos31 is a goal. So after pushing from pos32 to pos31, using pushtogoal.

So steps after the first push:

7. Move agent from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown)
8. Move to pos34 (dirright)
9. Move to pos44 (dirright)
10. Move to pos43 (dirup)
11. Push stone from pos33 to pos32 (dirleft) using pushtonongoal.
12. Move agent from pos33 (after push, agent is at pos33?) Wait, no. When you push, the agent moves from l_p to l_from. So after the push action, the agent ends up at l_from (pos33 in this case), and the stone is at l_to (pos32). So after step 11, agent is at pos33, stone at pos32.

Then, the agent needs to move to pos42 (east of pos32). So from pos33, move to pos34 (dirdown), then to pos44 (dirright), then to pos43 (dirup?), no. Wait, from pos33, movement options: can go to pos23 (dirleft), pos43 (dirright), pos32 (dirup), pos34 (dirdown). So from pos33, move to pos34 (dirdown), then to pos44 (dirright), then to pos43 (dirup), then to pos42 (dirleft). Then from pos42, push the stone from pos32 to pos31 (dirleft) using pushtogoal.

But pos42 to pos32 is dirleft. So the agent is at pos42 (l_p), stone is at pos32 (l_from). Direction from l_p to l_from is dirleft. Direction from l_from to l_to (pos31) is dirleft. So action pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos31 dirleft.

After this, the stone is at pos31 (goal), and the agent is at pos32.

But we also have to satisfy all the constraints. Let's check them one by one.

Constraints:

1. Player must be at pos12 in at least one state. So during the plan, the agent must visit pos12.

2. If player is at pos12, then pos25 must be not clear (occupied) at or after that state.

3. pos53 must be not clear in at least one state.

4. pos24 not clear can only be in at most one continuous sequence.

5. At least once, stone1 is at pos33 or pos25 is not clear.

6. pos44 not clear can't be in more than one continuous sequence.

7. Player is never at pos22.

8. Player must be at pos23 in at least one state.

9. If player is at pos23, then either at pos55 or pos44 not clear after.

10. pos11 not clear can only be once.

11. At least once, stone1 is at pos24 or pos25.

12. At least once, pos43 not clear or stone1 at pos55.

So, in the current plan, the agent is at pos13 (step 5), then pushes to pos23, then moves to pos24 (step7). So in step7, the agent moves to pos24. Then to pos34, pos44, pos43 (steps 8-10). Then pushes from pos43 to pos33 → pos32 (step11). Then agent is at pos33. Then needs to get to pos42 to push to pos31.

But in this plan, the agent never visits pos12. So we need to adjust the plan to include a visit to pos12. Also, the agent must visit pos23 (step6: after the first push, the agent is at pos23). So that satisfies constraint8. Then, after that, in step9, if the agent was at pos23, then they need to ensure that later, either player is at pos55 or pos44 is not clear.

In the current plan, after pos23, the agent moves to pos24, pos34, pos44, etc. So pos44 will be occupied by the agent at some point. So pos44 is not clear when the agent is there. So that would satisfy the constraint that if agent is at pos23, then pos44 is not clear at some state after. So that's okay.

Now, for constraint1: agent must be at pos12. So we need to adjust the plan to include a visit to pos12. Let's see where we can insert that.

The current plan's path is pos54 → pos44 → pos34 → pos24 → pos14 → pos13 → push to pos33 → then move to pos24 → pos34 → pos44 → pos43 → push to pos32 → then move to pos42 → push to pos31.

To visit pos12, perhaps after pushing the stone to pos33, the agent can go to pos12. But that may add steps. Let's think.

After step6 (agent at pos23, stone at pos33), the agent needs to go to pos24, then pos34, etc. Alternatively, from pos23, the agent can move up to pos22 (but constraint7 forbids being at pos22), so no. So agent can't go to pos22. So from pos23, the agent must go down to pos24, then left to pos14, then up to pos13, etc. Alternatively, perhaps after step6, the agent can take a detour to pos12.

But how? From pos23, agent can move to pos13 (dirleft), then pos12 (dirup). Wait, from pos13, can the agent move up to pos12? Yes. According to the movement connections: "You may move from location pos13 to location pos12 following direction dirup". So yes. So after step6 (agent at pos23), the agent can move to pos13 (dirleft), then to pos12 (dirup). This would satisfy constraint1. Then, from pos12, the agent needs to ensure that pos25 is not clear at some point.

But pos25 is initially clear. So to make pos25 not clear, the agent or a stone must be there. The stone is at pos33 after step6, so the only way is for the agent to be at pos25. So if the agent moves to pos25 after visiting pos12, then pos25 would be not clear. But how?

From pos12, the agent can move to pos22 (dirright), but that's forbidden. So no. From pos12, the agent can move to pos11 (dirup) or pos13 (dirdown). Then from pos13, to pos14 (dirdown), then pos24 (dirright), etc. Alternatively, from pos12, the agent can move down to pos13, then down to pos14, then right to pos24, then down to pos25. But that would require:

After step6: agent at pos23.

Step7: move pos23 to pos13 (dirleft)

Step8: move pos13 to pos12 (dirup) → satisfies constraint1.

Now, agent is at pos12. Then, constraint2 requires that pos25 is not clear at or after this state. So we need to make sure that pos25 is occupied at some point after this.

The stone is at pos33. To get pos25 occupied, either the agent or the stone must be there. Since the stone needs to go to pos31, moving it to pos25 would be a detour, but perhaps necessary. Alternatively, the agent can go to pos25 after visiting pos12.

So from pos12, agent can go to pos13 (dirdown), then pos14 (dirdown), then pos24 (dirright), then pos25 (dirdown). But pos25 is clear initially. So agent can move there.

So steps:

After step8 (agent at pos12):

Step9: move pos12 to pos13 (dirdown)

Step10: move pos13 to pos14 (dirdown)

Step11: move pos14 to pos24 (dirright)

Step12: move pos24 to pos25 (dirdown)

Now, agent is at pos25, making pos25 not clear. This satisfies constraint2 because after being at pos12, pos25 becomes not clear.

Then, the agent needs to continue with the original plan to push the stone. But now the stone is at pos33. So the agent needs to get back to pos33's vicinity to push it.

But this detour adds many steps and may not be optimal. Also, we have to make sure that the constraints are met. But since the user requires an optimal plan (shortest possible), this detour would make the plan longer. So maybe there's a smarter way to satisfy the constraints without adding too many steps.

Alternatively, perhaps during the initial movement to pos13, the agent can detour to pos12. Let's re-examine the initial movement path.

Original movement steps (before any pushes):

1. pos54 → pos44 (move left)
2. pos44 → pos34 (left)
3. pos34 → pos24 (left)
4. pos24 → pos14 (left)
5. pos14 → pos13 (up)
6. push from pos13 to pos23 → pos33.

But to visit pos12, perhaps after step5 (pos13), the agent can go to pos12 (up), then return to pos13, then proceed with the push. That adds two steps:

Step5: pos14 → pos13

Step6: pos13 → pos12 (up) → satisfies constraint1.

Step7: pos12 → pos13 (dirdown)

Step8: push from pos13 to pos23 → pos33.

Now, after step8, agent is at pos23, stone at pos33.

Then, the agent needs to go to pos43 to push the stone west. But after step8, the agent is at pos23. From there, they can move down to pos24, then to pos34, pos44, pos43.

But during this time, after step6 (agent at pos12), we need to ensure that pos25 is not clear at some point. Since the agent is at pos12 in step6, we need to make sure that pos25 is not clear either at step6 or later. To do that, the agent could go to pos25 later. For example, after step8 (agent at pos23), they can go to pos24 → pos25. But that would make pos25 not clear, satisfying constraint2.

So steps after step8:

9. move pos23 → pos24 (dirdown)

10. move pos24 → pos25 (dirdown) → pos25 is not clear now.

Then, proceed to push the stone.

But this adds steps but satisfies constraint2.

Also, constraint5 requires that at least once, stone1 is at pos33 (which it is after step8) or pos25 is not clear (which happens after step10). So constraint5 is satisfied.

Now, for constraint3: pos53 must be not clear in at least one state. pos53 is initially clear. To make it not clear, the agent or stone must be there. The stone is moving to pos31, so the agent must visit pos53. So perhaps during the agent's movement, they can go through pos53.

But how? The agent starts at pos54. pos54 can move up to pos53. So perhaps in the initial steps, the agent can move to pos53, then to pos44.

But that would add steps. Alternatively, after completing the main plan, the agent can move to pos53. But that would require additional steps. However, since the plan must be optimal, we need to minimize steps.

Another way: when the agent is at pos44 (step1), they can move up to pos43, then to pos53 (dirright). Wait, pos43 can move to pos53 via dirright? Let's check the movement connections. For pos43: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown".

So from pos43, moving right (dirright) to pos53. So if the agent is at pos43, they can move to pos53. So perhaps during the movement from pos44 to pos43, the agent can detour to pos53.

But the current plan after step8 (agent at pos23) is:

9. move to pos24

10. move to pos25 → agent at pos25.

11. move from pos25 to pos24 (dirup)

12. move to pos34 (dirright)

13. move to pos44 (dirright)

14. move to pos43 (dirup)

15. push stone from pos33 to pos32.

But after step14, agent is at pos43. From there, they can move to pos53 (dirright), making pos53 not clear. Then return to pos43. But this adds two steps. However, this would satisfy constraint3.

But this makes the plan longer. Is there a way to visit pos53 earlier without adding steps?

Alternatively, after the initial step1 (pos54 → pos44), the agent can move up to pos53 instead of left to pos34. Wait, pos54 to pos44 is via dirleft. pos54 can also move up to pos53. So step1: move from pos54 to pos53 (dirup). Now, pos53 is not clear. This satisfies constraint3. Then, from pos53, move left to pos43, then left to pos33, etc. But does this path work?

Let's see:

Step1: move player1 from pos54 to pos53 (dirup) → pos53 is now occupied.

This satisfies constraint3.

Then, step2: move pos53 → pos43 (dirleft)

step3: pos43 → pos33 (dirleft)

step4: pos33 → pos23 (dirleft) → but pos23 is occupied by stone. So can't.

Alternatively, from pos33, the agent can push the stone west to pos23, but the stone is already there. No.

Hmm, this path doesn't help in pushing the stone. So perhaps it's better to go via the original route but include a detour to pos53.

But how?

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos31, the agent can move to pos53. But this adds steps, but since the main goal is achieved, perhaps it's allowed. But the constraint3 requires that pos53 is not clear in at least one state. So even if the agent visits pos53 after the stone is at the goal, it's acceptable. So after the final push to pos31, the agent can move to pos53.

But the optimal plan would aim to minimize steps, so perhaps combining visits to required locations during the main path.

Let me try to integrate the constraints into the plan.

Revised plan outline:

1. Move player1 pos54 to pos53 (dirup) → satisfies constraint3 (pos53 not clear).

2. Move pos53 to pos43 (dirleft)

3. Move pos43 to pos33 (dirleft)

4. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos32 (dirleft) using pushtonongoal. But wait, the stone is initially at pos23. So this approach doesn't work. So this path is invalid.

Alternative approach:

Integrate a visit to pos53 early on.

Step1: move pos54 → pos53 (dirup) → pos53 not clear.

Step2: move pos53 → pos43 (dirleft)

Step3: move pos43 → pos33 (dirleft)

Step4: move pos33 → pos23 (dirleft) → can't because stone is there.

No, this doesn't help.

Alternative idea: After the main plan, the agent moves to pos53.

But the main plan's final steps have the agent at pos32 after pushing the stone to pos31. From pos32, the agent can move to pos31 (left), but that's the goal. Or move up to pos22 (forbidden). So instead, after pushing to pos31, the agent is at pos32. Then, move to pos42 (dirright), then pos52 (dirright), then pos53 (dirdown). But this adds several steps. However, it's necessary to satisfy constraint3.

But this increases the plan length. Is there a better way?

Another constraint to consider: constraint12 requires that at least once, pos43 is not clear or stone1 is at pos55. Since stone1 is moved to pos31, the only way to satisfy this is to have pos43 not clear. The agent can pass through pos43 during the plan. For example, when moving from pos44 to pos43 (step10 in the earlier plan), pos43 becomes not clear. So that would satisfy constraint12.

So constraint12 is satisfied when the agent is at pos43.

Now, back to constraint3: pos53 must be not clear. The agent can move to pos53 during step1, making pos53 not clear. Then continue the plan.

So revised steps:

1. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup → pos53 not clear (constraint3).

2. move pos53 → pos43 dirleft.

3. move pos43 → pos33 dirleft.

But the stone is at pos23. So the agent needs to get to pos13 to push it east. So this path is not helpful.

Alternatively, after step1 (pos53), the agent moves to pos44 (dirleft?), but pos53 to pos44 is not directly connected. pos53's movements: "You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos53 to location pos52 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown".

So from pos53, the agent can go left to pos43, up to pos52, or down to pos54. To get to pos44, the agent would need to go from pos43 → pos44 (dirdown). So steps:

1. move pos54 → pos53 (dirup) → pos53 not clear.

2. move pos53 → pos43 (dirleft).

3. move pos43 → pos44 (dirdown).

4. move pos44 → pos34 (dirleft).

5. move pos34 → pos24 (dirleft).

6. move pos24 → pos14 (dirleft).

7. move pos14 → pos13 (dirup).

8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirright → stone at pos33, agent at pos23.

Now, agent is at pos23 (satisfies constraint8).

Then, after this, the agent needs to move to pos24 → pos25 (to satisfy constraint2), then proceed.

9. move pos23 → pos24 (dirdown).

10. move pos24 → pos25 (dirdown) → pos25 not clear (satisfies constraint2 after being at pos12? Wait, no. In this revised plan, the agent hasn't visited pos12 yet. Oh right, constraint1 requires visiting pos12. So we need to insert that.

So after step8 (agent at pos23), the agent needs to move to pos13 → pos12.

9. move pos23 → pos13 (dirleft).

10. move pos13 → pos12 (dirup) → satisfies constraint1.

11. move pos12 → pos13 (dirdown).

12. move pos13 → pos14 (dirdown).

13. move pos14 → pos24 (dirright).

14. move pos24 → pos25 (dirdown) → pos25 not clear (satisfies constraint2).

Now, after pos25, the agent needs to go back to push the stone. But the stone is at pos33. So agent needs to get to pos43 to push it west.

From pos25:

15. move pos25 → pos24 (dirup).

16. move pos24 → pos34 (dirright).

17. move pos34 → pos44 (dirright).

18. move pos44 → pos43 (dirup).

19. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos32 dirleft → stone at pos32, agent at pos33.

Then, agent needs to get to pos42 to push to pos31.

20. move pos33 → pos34 (dirdown).

21. move pos34 → pos44 (dirright).

22. move pos44 → pos43 (dirup).

23. move pos43 → pos42 (dirleft).

24. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos31 dirleft → stone at pos31, agent at pos32.

Now, check constraints:

constraint1: step10.

constraint2: step14, pos25 not clear.

constraint3: step1, pos53 not clear.

constraint5: stone at pos33 (step8) and pos25 not clear (step14) → satisfied.

constraint8: step8 and step9.

constraint9: agent was at pos23 (step8), then later pos44 is not clear when agent is there (step17, 18, etc.). So satisfied.

constraint11: stone is never at pos24 or pos25. But in this plan, stone is at pos23 → pos33 → pos32 → pos31. So constraint11 requires at least once, stone is at pos24 or pos25. But it's not. So this plan fails constraint11.

Ah, this is a problem. So the plan must have the stone at pos24 or pos25 at least once. So we need to adjust the plan to push the stone to pos24 or pos25 at some point.

So how to do that? Perhaps instead of pushing the stone directly from pos23 to pos33, we can push it to pos24 first, then move it towards the goal.

Let's try:

Original plan with adjustments for constraint11.

Initial steps:

1. move pos54 → pos44 (dirleft)

2. move pos44 → pos34 (dirleft)

3. move pos34 → pos24 (dirleft)

4. move pos24 → pos23 (dirup) → but pos23 is occupied by stone. So agent can't move there.

So instead, agent must push the stone from pos23 to pos24.

To do that, the agent needs to be south of pos23 (pos24). But pos24 is clear. So agent can move to pos24, then push the stone north to pos23. Wait, no. The stone is at pos23, so pushing north would require the agent to be south of pos23 (pos24), pushing north (dirup) to pos23. But the stone is already there. That's not possible.

Alternatively, the agent can be north of pos23 (pos22) and push south to pos24. But the agent can't go to pos22 due to constraint7.

So the only way to push the stone to pos24 is from pos22, which is forbidden. Therefore, this approach is not possible.

Alternative idea: push the stone to pos24 from pos23's east (pos33). But the agent needs to be west of pos23 to push east. So agent at pos13 can push east to pos23 → pos24. No, because direction from pos23 to pos24 is dirdown. So to push the stone from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown), the agent must be north of pos23 (pos22) and push south. But pos22 is forbidden.

This is a problem. So the only way to push the stone to pos24 is from pos22, which is not allowed. Therefore, constraint11 (stone at pos24 or pos25) cannot be satisfied by moving the stone there. Therefore, the only way to satisfy constraint11 is to have the stone at pos25. But how?

To get the stone to pos25, the agent must push it there. The path would be from pos23 → pos24 → pos25. So to push to pos24, the agent must be at pos23's south (pos24), pushing north. But that's not possible. Alternatively, from pos24, pushing north to pos23. But the stone is already at pos23. So this seems impossible.

Alternatively, the agent could push the stone from pos23 to pos24, then from pos24 to pos25. But how?

To push from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown), the agent must be at pos24, pushing north. But the agent can't be at pos24 and push north to pos23. Because the stone is at pos23. So the agent can't push from pos24 to pos23.

This is a dead end. Therefore, the only way to satisfy constraint11 is to have the stone at pos25. But how?

The stone starts at pos23. To get to pos25, it needs to be pushed east to pos24, then south to pos25. But to push east to pos24, the agent must be west of pos23 (pos13), pushing east to pos23 → pos24. No, pos23 to pos24 is south. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, from pos23, the agent can push the stone south to pos24, then east to pos25. But to push south to pos24, the agent must be north of pos23 (pos22), which is forbidden.

This suggests that it's impossible to satisfy constraint11 given the movement constraints and the stone's initial position. But the problem states that a valid plan exists, so there must be a way.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the grid layout. Let's recheck the movement possibilities.

For pos23:

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos33 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos22 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos24 following direction dirdown"

So from pos23, you can move down to pos24. So pushing the stone from pos23 to pos24 requires the agent to be at pos23's south (pos24), pushing north (dirup) to pos23. But the stone is at pos23. So the agent can't push north into the same cell. Therefore, this is impossible.

Alternatively, the agent could push the stone from pos24 to pos25. But the stone is at pos23. So this isn't applicable.

This indicates that the stone cannot be moved to pos24 or pos25, making constraint11 impossible to satisfy. But the problem states that a valid plan exists, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the agent can push the stone from pos24 to pos25. But the stone needs to be at pos24 first. But how?

If the agent can move the stone to pos24, but given the constraints, this seems impossible. Alternatively, perhaps the agent can move the stone to pos33, then to pos34, then to pos24. But pos34 is east of pos24. To push from pos34 to pos24, the agent must be at pos34's west (pos24) to push east. No. Or from pos44, push west to pos34. But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos33, the agent can push it south to pos34, then west to pos24, then south to pos25. But pos34 is east of pos24. To push west from pos34 to pos24, the agent must be at pos34's east (pos44), pushing west. So:

After stone is at pos33:

1. Agent moves to pos44 → pos34 (dirleft)

2. Push stone from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown)

3. Then, agent moves to pos44 again, pushes west to pos34 → pos24.

But this requires multiple steps and may not be optimal.

Let's outline this path:

Initial steps to push stone to pos33:

1. move pos54 → pos44 (dirleft)

2. move pos44 → pos34 (dirleft)

3. move pos34 → pos24 (dirleft)

4. move pos24 → pos14 (dirleft)

5. move pos14 → pos13 (dirup)

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirright → stone at pos33, agent at pos23.

Then, to move stone to pos34:

7. move pos23 → pos24 (dirdown)

8. move pos24 → pos34 (dirright)

9. move pos34 → pos44 (dirright)

10. move pos44 → pos43 (dirup)

11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos34 dirdown → stone at pos34, agent at pos33.

Then, push to pos24:

12. move pos33 → pos34 (dirdown)

13. move pos34 → pos44 (dirright)

14. move pos44 → pos43 (dirup)

15. move pos43 → pos33 (dirleft)

16. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos24 dirleft → stone at pos24, agent at pos34.

Then, push to pos25:

17. move pos34 → pos24 (dirleft)

18. move pos24 → pos25 (dirdown)

19. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos24 pos25 dirdown → no, stone is at pos24. To push south to pos25, agent must be at pos24's south (pos25?), but pos25 is clear. So agent can move to pos24, then push south.

But wait, to push the stone from pos24 to pos25, the agent must be adjacent to pos24 in the opposite direction of the push. So direction dirdown from pos24 to pos25 requires the agent to be at pos24, pushing south. So the agent is at pos24, and pushes the stone south to pos25. So action pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos24 pos25 dirdown. But the preconditions require that the agent is at l_p=pos24, the stone is at l_from=pos24. But the stone is at pos24, so l_from=pos24. So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos24 pos25 dirdown. But pos24 to pos25 is allowed via dirdown. However, the agent is at pos24, which is adjacent to pos24? No, l_p must be adjacent to l_from. But in this case, l_p is pos24, and l_from is pos24. So the agent is at the same position as the stone, which is not allowed. Therefore, this is invalid.

Therefore, the agent must be adjacent to pos24 to push the stone there. For example, agent at pos14 (north of pos24) can push south to pos24 → pos25. But the stone is at pos24, so pushing south to pos25 requires the agent to be at pos24's north (pos14) and push south (dirdown).

But the stone is at pos24. So agent at pos14 can push south to pos24 → pos25. So action pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos25 dirdown. For this, the stone must be at pos24, and pos25 must be clear. So after step16 (stone at pos24), agent needs to move to pos14.

Steps after step16 (stone at pos24, agent at pos34):

17. move pos34 → pos24 (dirleft)

18. move pos24 → pos14 (dirleft)

19. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos25 dirdown → stone at pos25, agent at pos24.

Now, constraint11 is satisfied (stone at pos25).

Then, the agent needs to move the stone from pos25 to pos31. But this adds many steps and may not be optimal. However, given the constraints, it's necessary.

Continuing:

20. move pos24 → pos25 (dirdown) → agent at pos25, stone at pos25. So the agent can't be there. Wait, after the push in step19, the agent is at pos24 (l_from=pos24), so after pushing, the agent moves to pos24's position (pos24). But the stone is now at pos25. So agent is at pos24, stone at pos25.

Now, to move the stone from pos25 to pos31, the agent needs to push it west to pos24, then north to pos14, then west to pos13, etc. This seems very long and not optimal.

This indicates that satisfying constraint11 requires a significant detour, making the plan non-optimal. But the problem requires an optimal plan. Therefore, there must be a different approach.

Another idea: perhaps during the initial push from pos23 to pos33, the stone passes through pos24. But that's not possible. The stone is pushed from pos23 to pos33 directly, not via pos24.

Alternatively, the agent can push the stone to pos24 in a different way. For example, the agent is at pos22 (forbidden) or pos24. But pos24 is allowed.

Wait, the agent can be at pos24. So after pushing the stone to pos33, the agent can move to pos24, then push the stone west to pos23, then south to pos24. But this seems counterproductive.

Alternatively, after the stone is at pos33, the agent can push it south to pos34, then west to pos24. But pos34 is clear initially. So:

After step6 (stone at pos33, agent at pos23):

7. move pos23 → pos24 (dirdown)

8. move pos24 → pos34 (dirright)

9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos34 dirdown → stone at pos34, agent at pos33.

10. move pos33 → pos34 (dirdown)

11. move pos34 → pos44 (dirright)

12. move pos44 → pos43 (dirup)

13. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos34 pos24 dirleft → stone at pos24, agent at pos34.

14. move pos34 → pos24 (dirleft)

15. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos24 pos25 dirdown → invalid, as before.

Hmm, this still doesn't work. It seems impossible to get the stone to pos24 or pos25 without violating other constraints or making the plan too long.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity of the constraints, perhaps the optimal plan involves using the initial push to pos33 and then finding a way to satisfy all constraints with minimal steps.

Let me try to outline the plan again, integrating all constraints:

1. move player1 pos54 to pos53 (dirup) → satisfies constraint3.

2. move pos53 → pos43 (dirleft).

3. move pos43 → pos33 (dirleft).

4. move pos33 → pos23 (dirleft) → but stone is there. So invalid.

Alternative path after step1:

1. move pos54 → pos53 (dirup) → constraint3.

2. move pos53 → pos43 (dirleft).

3. move pos43 → pos44 (dirdown).

4. move pos44 → pos34 (dirleft).

5. move pos34 → pos24 (dirleft).

6. move pos24 → pos14 (dirleft).

7. move pos14 → pos13 (dirup).

8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirright → stone at pos33, agent at pos23 (constraint8).

9. move pos23 → pos13 (dirleft).

10. move pos13 → pos12 (dirup) → constraint1.

11. move pos12 → pos13 (dirdown).

12. move pos13 → pos14 (dirdown).

13. move pos14 → pos24 (dirright).

14. move pos24 → pos25 (dirdown) → pos25 not clear (constraint2).

15. move pos25 → pos24 (dirup).

16. move pos24 → pos34 (dirright).

17. move pos34 → pos44 (dirright).

18. move pos44 → pos43 (dirup).

19. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos32 dirleft → stone at pos32, agent at pos33.

20. move pos33 → pos34 (dirdown).

21. move pos34 → pos44 (dirright).

22. move pos44 → pos43 (dirup).

23. move pos43 → pos42 (dirleft).

24. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos31 dirleft → stone at pos31 (goal), agent at pos32.

Now, check constraints:

- constraint1: step10.

- constraint2: step14.

- constraint3: step1.

- constraint5: stone at pos33 (step8) or pos25 not clear (step14) → satisfied.

- constraint8: step8.

- constraint9: after step8, agent at pos23. Then, later at pos44 (step17, 18) → pos44 not clear. Satisfied.

- constraint11: not satisfied. Stone was at pos33 and pos32, never at pos24 or pos25. So this plan fails constraint11.

This is a problem. So how to satisfy constraint11?

Perhaps the stone can be pushed to pos25 during the plan. But how?

After step14, the agent is at pos25. The stone is at pos33. To push the stone to pos25, the agent would need to move it from pos33 to pos34 → pos35 → pos45 → pos55. But this is not helpful.

Alternatively, after step8, the stone is at pos33. To satisfy constraint11, we need to ensure that at least once, the stone is at pos24 or pos25. But in this plan, it's not. So perhaps the only way is to push the stone to pos24 or pos25, even if it's a detour.

But this requires a longer plan, which may not be optimal. Given the problem's requirement for an optimal plan, perhaps there's a different approach.

Another way to satisfy constraint11 is to have the agent move the stone to pos24 or pos25 during the initial pushes.

But given the stone starts at pos23, how to push it to pos24:

The agent must be at pos22 (forbidden) or pos24. So the agent can't push from pos22. So the only way is to push from pos24. But to do that, the agent must be at pos24 and push north into pos23. But the stone is already there. So this is impossible.

Therefore, the only way to satisfy constraint11 is to have the stone at pos25. But the stone can't reach pos25 unless the agent pushes it there. Which requires the stone to be at pos24 first, which seems impossible.

This suggests that the problem has no valid plan under the given constraints, but this can't be the case. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the stone can be pushed to pos24 by another route. Let's consider:

After the stone is at pos33, the agent can push it south to pos34, then west to pos24, then south to pos25.

So:

After step8 (stone at pos33, agent at pos23):

9. move pos23 → pos24 (dirdown).

10. move pos24 → pos34 (dirright).

11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos34 dirdown → stone at pos34, agent at pos33.

12. move pos33 → pos34 (dirdown).

13. move pos34 → pos44 (dirright).

14. move pos44 → pos43 (dirup).

15. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos34 pos24 dirleft → stone at pos24, agent at pos34.

16. move pos34 → pos24 (dirleft).

17. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos24 pos25 dirdown → stone at pos25, agent at pos24.

Now, constraint11 is satisfied (stone at pos25).

Then, the agent needs to move the stone from pos25 to pos31. This requires:

18. move pos24 → pos25 (dirdown).

But stone is at pos25. So agent can't move there. So agent must push the stone from pos25 to pos24, then to pos14, etc. But this is very long.

Alternatively, after step17, the stone is at pos25. To get to pos31, the agent must push it west to pos24, then north to pos14, then west to pos13, then north to pos12, but this seems extremely long.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity of the problem, I'll proceed to draft a plan that attempts to satisfy all constraints, even if it's longer than expected. However, the user requests an optimal plan, so I must find the shortest path.

Given the time constraints, I'll present a plan that meets all the requirements, even if it's longer than ideal, but ensuring all constraints are met.
