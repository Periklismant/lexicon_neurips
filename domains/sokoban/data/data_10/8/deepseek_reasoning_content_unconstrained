Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. From the initial state, stone1 is at pos23, and the only goal location mentioned is pos31. So, we need to move stone1 from pos23 to pos31.

First, the agent starts at pos54. The agent needs to reach pos23 to push the stone. Let's look at the possible paths from pos54 to pos23.

Looking at the movement possibilities, pos54 can move up to pos53 or left to pos44, or down to pos55. But pos55 is clear, so maybe moving up to pos53 first. Let's see:

From pos54, moving up (dirup) to pos53. Then, from pos53, can move up to pos52 or left to pos43. Hmm, maybe going left towards pos43 might be a way to get closer to the stone's position. Wait, pos43 is connected to pos33 via dirleft? Let me check the movement directions.

Looking at the "You may move from" statements, pos43 can move left to pos33 (direction dirleft). So, the path might be: pos54 → pos53 (dirup), then pos53 → pos43 (dirleft). From pos43, can go to pos33 (dirleft). Then pos33 to pos23 (dirleft). So, agent would need to move through pos43, pos33, to reach pos23.

Wait, let's verify each step. From pos54, moving up to pos53 is allowed. Then from pos53, moving left to pos43 (since "You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft"). Then pos43 can move left to pos33. Then pos33 can move left to pos23. But wait, the movement from pos33 to pos23 is allowed via dirleft? Let's check the given movements. The movement from pos33 says: "You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft". Yes, that's correct.

So the path for the agent would be: pos54 → pos53 (dirup), then pos53 → pos43 (dirleft), pos43 → pos33 (dirleft), pos33 → pos23 (dirleft). But wait, when the agent reaches pos23, that's where the stone is. But to push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent in the direction they want to push. Since the stone is at pos23, and the goal is pos31, which is up and right from pos23. Wait, pos31 is a goal location, which is at row 3, column1. So to get from pos23 (row2, column3) to pos31 (row3, column1), the stone needs to move left and up? Wait, maybe I'm getting the coordinates wrong. The positions are labeled as posXY, where X is the row and Y the column. So pos23 is row2, column3. pos31 is row3, column1. So moving from pos23 to pos31 would require moving left twice and down once? Wait, perhaps the directions are a bit tricky here.

Alternatively, the agent needs to push the stone from pos23 towards pos31. Let's see the possible directions. The movement from pos23 includes directions dirleft (to pos13), dirright (to pos33), dirup (to pos22), dirdown (to pos24). Hmm, to get to pos31, maybe the stone needs to be moved left to pos13, then up? Wait, pos13 is not a goal. The only goal is pos31. So how to get the stone from pos23 to pos31? Let's think about the possible paths.

Wait, pos31 is connected to pos21 (dirleft) and pos41 (dirright) and pos32 (dirdown). So from pos21, you can go to pos31 via dirright. But the stone is at pos23. So the agent needs to push the stone left to pos13, then up to pos12, then left to pos11, then down to pos21, then right to pos31? That seems too long. Alternatively, maybe there's a more direct path. Let me check the movement possibilities again.

Alternatively, maybe the stone can be pushed from pos23 to pos22 (dirup), then to pos21 (dirup), then to pos31 (dirright). Let's see:

From pos23, pushing up to pos22 (if possible). The agent would need to be at pos23's direction from pos22. Wait, to push a stone from pos23 to pos22, the agent needs to be in the opposite direction. So the direction for pushing would be dirup. Wait, the pushing action's direction is the direction from the agent's position to the stone's position, and then the stone moves in the same direction. Wait, the "pushtogoal" action requires that the agent is at l_p, the stone is at l_from, and the direction from l_p to l_from is d, and then from l_from to l_to is also d. So, for example, if the agent is at pos24 (south of pos23), and the stone is at pos23, then the agent can push the stone north (dirdown? Wait, directions might be confusing here. Let me check the direction definitions.

Wait, the directions are: dirdown, dirleft, dirright, dirup. The movement from pos23 to pos22 is dirup. So if the agent is at pos24 (south of pos23), and pushes the stone north (dirup) to pos22, that would require the agent to be at pos24, direction from pos24 to pos23 is dirup? Wait, the movement from pos24 to pos23 is dirup. So to push the stone from pos23 to pos22, the agent needs to be at pos24 (south of pos23), then push the stone upwards (dirup) to pos22. Wait, but pos23 to pos22 is dirup. So the agent would have to be at pos24, which is south of pos23. Then, the direction from pos24 to pos23 is dirup. So the action would be pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirup. But pos22 is not a goal location, so that's not allowed. Wait, the goal is to get the stone to a goal location, which is pos31. So the final push must be to pos31.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can move the stone from pos23 to pos33 (dirright), then to pos43 (dirright), then to pos53 (dirright), but those are not goals. Alternatively, maybe moving the stone to pos24 (dirdown), but that's not helpful. Wait, pos31 is the only goal. So the stone must end up at pos31.

So the path must be from pos23 to pos22 (dirup), then to pos21 (dirup), then to pos31 (dirright). Let's check if that's possible.

First, the agent needs to get to a position where they can push the stone. Let's see: the stone is at pos23. To push it to pos22 (dirup), the agent needs to be at pos24 (south of pos23) and move north (dirup) into pos23, pushing the stone north to pos22. But pos24 is clear initially. Wait, initial state says Location pos24 is clear. So agent can move to pos24.

Wait, the initial positions: agent is at pos54. So the steps would be:

1. Move from pos54 to pos44 (dirleft), then to pos34 (dirleft), pos24 (dirleft), and then pos24 is clear. Then from pos24, can push the stone at pos23 to pos22. Wait, but pos24 to pos23 is dirup. So agent moves to pos24, then can push the stone from pos23 to pos22 (dirup). But pos22 is not a goal, so that's a pushtonongoal action. But the stone needs to end up at pos31. So after pushing to pos22, then the agent can push it again to pos21 (dirup), then to pos31 (dirright). Let's outline this:

Agent's path to reach pos24:

pos54 → pos44 (dirleft), then pos44 → pos34 (dirleft), pos34 → pos24 (dirleft). Then, from pos24, push the stone from pos23 to pos22 (dirup). Then agent is at pos23 after pushing. Then, agent can move to pos22 (dirup), then push the stone from pos22 to pos21 (dirup). Then, from pos21, push the stone to pos31 (dirright).

Let me check if each step is possible.

First, moving from pos54 to pos44: yes, "move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft" because pos54 can move left to pos44. Then pos44 to pos34 via dirleft. Then pos34 to pos24 via dirleft. Now the agent is at pos24. Then perform "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirup". Preconditions: agent at pos24, stone at pos23, pos22 is clear (yes, initial state says pos22 is clear), direction from pos24 to pos23 is dirup, direction from pos23 to pos22 is dirup. pos22 is not a goal (correct). So this action is valid. After this, the stone is at pos22, agent is at pos23.

Next, the agent needs to push the stone from pos22 to pos21. Agent is at pos23. To push from pos22 to pos21, the agent needs to be at pos23 (since direction from pos23 to pos22 is dirup, and pushing the stone up to pos21 would require the agent to be south of pos22, i.e., at pos23. Wait, no: to push the stone from pos22 to pos21 (dirup), the agent needs to be at pos23 (south of pos22), direction from pos23 to pos22 is dirup. Then, pushing dirup would move the stone from pos22 to pos21. So action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos21 dirup. Preconditions: agent is at pos23 (after previous push action), stone is at pos22, pos21 is clear (initially pos21 is clear). So yes. After this, stone is at pos21, agent is at pos22.

Then, the agent needs to push the stone from pos21 to pos31. But pos31 is a goal location. So this would be a pushtogoal action. The agent is at pos22. To push the stone from pos21 to pos31, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos21 in the direction towards pos31. pos21 is connected to pos31 via dirright. So direction from pos21 to pos31 is dirright. Therefore, the agent needs to be at pos21's left (pos11) or up/down. Wait, pos21's neighbors: pos11 (left), pos31 (right), pos22 (down). So to push the stone from pos21 to pos31 (dirright), the agent needs to be at pos21's left (pos11) or down (pos22). Wait, but the direction from agent's position to stone's position must be dirright. If the agent is at pos22 (which is down from pos21), the direction from pos22 to pos21 is dirup. So pushing the stone from pos21 to pos31 would require the agent to be at pos21's left (pos11) and direction dirright. But the agent is currently at pos22 after the last push. So how to get there?

After the previous push, the agent is at pos22. The stone is at pos21. The agent needs to move to pos21's west (pos11 is west of pos21?) Wait, pos21's movement options include moving left to pos11. So pos21 is connected to pos11 via dirleft. So pos11 is to the left of pos21. So to push the stone from pos21 to pos31 (dirright), the agent needs to be at pos21's left (pos11) and push east (dirright). But the agent is at pos22. So how to get to pos11?

Alternatively, maybe the agent can move to pos21 (from pos22 via dirup). Let's see: from pos22, the agent can move up to pos21. So after pushing the stone to pos21, the agent is at pos22. Then move from pos22 to pos21 via dirup. Then, from pos21, push the stone to pos31 via dirright. Because pos21 is connected to pos31 via dirright. So agent at pos21 can push the stone east to pos31. But wait, the stone is at pos21. So agent is at pos21, stone is at pos21? No, the stone is at pos21. Wait, after the second push, the stone is at pos21, and the agent is at pos22. So after that, the agent can move from pos22 to pos21 (dirup). Then, the agent is at pos21. Now, to push the stone from pos21 to pos31, the agent must be at a position adjacent to pos21 in the direction of the push. Since we're pushing east (dirright) to pos31, the agent must be west of pos21 (pos11) and push east. But the agent is at pos21. So how can that work?

Wait, the preconditions for pushtogoal: (i) agent p is at location l_p (pos11?), (ii) stone s is at l_from (pos21), (iii) l_to (pos31) is clear, (iv) direction from l_p to l_from is d (dirright), (v) direction from l_from to l_to is d (dirright), (vi) l_to is a goal.

So the agent needs to be at pos11, then push the stone from pos21 to pos31 via dirright. But how does the agent get to pos11 from pos21? The agent is at pos21 after moving from pos22. To get to pos11, the agent can move from pos21 to pos11 via dirleft. So:

After the stone is at pos21, agent is at pos22. Agent moves to pos21 (dirup). Then agent moves to pos11 (dirleft). Then from pos11, push the stone to pos31 via dirright. Let's check:

move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup (valid, as pos21 is clear? Wait, pos21 was clear initially, but after the stone is pushed to pos21, is it still clear? Wait, when the stone is at pos21, that location is not clear. So after pushing the stone to pos21, pos21 is occupied by the stone. So the agent cannot move there. So moving from pos22 to pos21 is impossible because pos21 is occupied by the stone. Therefore, that approach won't work.

Alternative plan: After pushing the stone to pos21, the agent is at pos22. To push the stone from pos21 to pos31, the agent needs to be at a position adjacent to pos21 in the direction opposite to the push. Since the push is east (dirright), the agent needs to be west of pos21 (pos11). So the agent needs to move from pos22 to pos21's west. But how?

Agent is at pos22. To reach pos11, the path would be pos22 → pos12 (dirleft), then pos12 → pos11 (dirup). Then from pos11, push the stone east to pos21 (dirright) to pos31. Wait, but the stone is already at pos21. So pushing from pos21 to pos31 would require the agent to be at pos21's west (pos11) and push east. But how?

Wait, the agent is at pos22. He needs to get to pos11. Let's see:

From pos22, move up to pos21 (but pos21 has the stone, so can't). So alternative path: pos22 → pos12 (dirleft). Then pos12 → pos11 (dirup). Now agent is at pos11. Then, from pos11, can the agent push the stone from pos21 to pos31? Let's check the directions. The agent is at pos11. The stone is at pos21. The direction from pos11 to pos21 is dirright (since moving from pos11 to pos21 is dirright). So to push the stone from pos21 to pos31, the direction would be dirright. So the action would be pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos21 pos31 dirright. Preconditions:

(i) agent at pos11: yes.

(ii) stone at pos21: yes.

(iii) pos31 is clear: initially yes, as pos31 is clear.

(iv) can move from pos11 to pos21 via dirright: yes, according to movement rules.

(v) can move from pos21 to pos31 via dirright: yes, as per movement rules.

(vi) pos31 is a goal location: yes.

So this action is valid. After this, the stone is at pos31 (goal), agent is at pos21, and pos11 is clear.

So the steps would be:

1. Move agent from pos54 to pos44 (dirleft).

2. Move to pos34 (dirleft).

3. Move to pos24 (dirleft).

4. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos22 (dirup) using pushtonongoal.

5. Move agent from pos24 to pos23 (after push, agent is at pos23).

Wait, no: after the push action, the agent moves from pos24 to pos23. Wait, the effect of pushtonongoal is that the agent moves from l_p (pos24) to l_from (pos23), and the stone moves to l_to (pos22). So after step 4, agent is at pos23, stone at pos22.

Then, to push the stone from pos22 to pos21:

6. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos21 (dirup) using pushtonongoal. Agent is at pos22 after this.

7. Move agent from pos22 to pos12 (dirleft).

8. Move agent from pos12 to pos11 (dirup).

9. Push stone1 from pos21 to pos31 (dirright) using pushtogoal.

This would get the stone to pos31. Let's count the steps:

Move steps: 54→44, 44→34, 34→24 (3 moves).

Push to pos22 (1 action).

Push to pos21 (1 action).

Move from pos22→12 (1 move), 12→11 (1 move) (total 2 moves).

Push to pos31 (1 action).

Total actions: 3 move + 2 push + 2 move + 1 push = 8 actions.

But maybe there's a shorter path. Let's see if the agent can reach pos11 faster.

Alternative path from pos54 to pos11:

pos54 → pos44 (dirleft), pos44→pos34 (dirleft), pos34→pos24 (dirleft), pos24→pos14 (dirleft), pos14→pos13 (dirup), pos13→pos12 (dirup), pos12→pos11 (dirup). That's 7 moves, which is longer. Not better.

Alternatively, maybe after pushing the stone to pos22, the agent can find a shorter path to pos11. Let's think.

But the initial plan seems to have 3 moves to get to pos24, then two pushes, then two moves, then a push. Total of 3 + 2 + 2 +1= 8 actions. Is there a way to reduce this?

Wait, after the first push (step 4), agent is at pos23. Then, to push the stone from pos22 to pos21, the agent needs to be at pos23 (since pos23 is south of pos22). So direction from pos23 to pos22 is dirup. So the agent is already at pos23 after step4. So step5 is "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos21 dirup". That's valid. Then after that, agent is at pos22.

Now, from pos22, agent needs to get to pos11. How? pos22 can move to pos12 (dirleft), then pos12 to pos11 (dirup). So two moves: move from pos22 to pos12 (dirleft), then pos12 to pos11 (dirup). Then push.

So the total steps would be:

1. move pos54→pos44 (dirleft)

2. move pos44→pos34 (dirleft)

3. move pos34→pos24 (dirleft)

4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirup

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos21 dirup

6. move pos22→pos12 (dirleft)

7. move pos12→pos11 (dirup)

8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos21 pos31 dirright

Total 8 actions. That's the minimal I can think of. Let's verify each step's preconditions.

Step 1: move from pos54 to pos44. Preconditions: agent at pos54, pos44 clear. Initial state says pos44 is clear. Yes. Directions: pos54 can move left to pos44. Correct.

Step 2: pos44→pos34 dirleft. Yes, pos34 is clear. Movement allowed.

Step3: pos34→pos24 dirleft. Yes.

Step4: push from pos23 to pos22. Agent at pos24, stone at pos23, pos22 clear. Directions from pos24 to pos23 is dirup, and from pos23 to pos22 is dirup. pos22 is non-goal. Valid.

After step4: agent at pos23, stone at pos22.

Step5: push from pos22 to pos21. Agent at pos23 (correct), stone at pos22. pos21 is clear. Directions from pos23 to pos22 dirup, and from pos22 to pos21 dirup. Valid. After this, agent at pos22, stone at pos21.

Step6: move pos22→pos12 dirleft. pos12 is clear. Movement allowed (from pos22 to pos12 is dirleft).

Step7: move pos12→pos11 dirup. pos11 is clear. Movement allowed.

Step8: push from pos21 to pos31. Agent at pos11, stone at pos21. pos31 is clear. Directions: pos11 to pos21 dirright, pos21 to pos31 dirright. Valid, and pos31 is goal. So this action completes the plan.

Yes, this seems valid. So the optimal plan is 8 actions. But wait, maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternative approach: Can the agent move from pos54 to pos44, then pos44→pos43 (dirright?), wait no. pos44 can move right to pos54? Wait, the movement options for pos44: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown". Wait, no. From pos44, the possible moves are dirleft (to pos34), dirright (to pos54?), wait no. Let me check the given movements.

Looking back at the "You may move from" statements:

For pos44: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown".

Wait, pos44 to pos54 is dirright? That would be east. pos44 is row4, column4. pos54 is row5, column4. So moving down would be from pos44 to pos54? No, pos54 is south of pos44. So direction dirdown. But according to the given data, pos44 can move dirright to pos54. That's confusing. Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the movement directions. Let me check again.

The given movement for pos44: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright". Hmm. That seems incorrect unless the grid is labeled differently. But assuming the directions are as given, pos44 to pos54 is dirright. So that's east. So perhaps the grid is column-major. Maybe posXY is row X, column Y. So pos44 is row4, column4. dirright would increase column to 5, but pos45 is column5. Wait, maybe the directions are different. Let's not get stuck here. We need to follow the given movement rules as stated, even if they seem counterintuitive.

So according to the problem statement, the allowed movements are as provided. So pos44 can move dirright to pos54. So if the agent is at pos44, moving dirright takes them to pos54. But pos54 is the initial position. That's not helpful for moving towards the stone. So the initial path of moving left from pos54 to pos44, then left to pos34, etc., seems correct.

Another alternative: Could the agent move upwards from pos54 to pos53, then left to pos43, etc.?

pos54 → pos53 (dirup), then pos53 → pos43 (dirleft), pos43 → pos33 (dirleft), pos33 → pos23 (dirleft). Then the agent is at pos23. But the stone is at pos23. So to push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. Wait, when the agent is at pos23 and the stone is also at pos23? No, that's impossible. The stone is at pos23 initially, so agent can't be there. Wait, initial state says "stone1 is at location pos23" and "Location pos23 is clear". Wait, no. The initial state says "Location pos23 is clear" but "stone1 is at location pos23". So there's a contradiction? Or is the "clear" condition indicating no agent or stone? Wait, no: the problem states "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So a location is clear if it contains neither. But initial state says "Location pos23 is clear" but "stone1 is at location pos23". That's a contradiction. Wait, this must be a mistake in the problem statement. Let me check.

Looking back at the original state:

The original state includes:

"stone1 is at location pos23"

"Location pos23 is clear"

This is impossible. A location with a stone cannot be clear. So this is a mistake. Assuming that the problem intended that pos23 is occupied by the stone and thus not clear. But according to the given initial state, pos23 is clear. That's conflicting. This must be an error. However, since the problem states that "Location pos23 is clear" in the original state, perhaps it's a mistake and the stone is actually at pos23 but the location is not clear. Or perhaps the initial state is correct, and there's a mistake. But given that the problem states both, we have to work with the given data. But that's a problem.

Wait, the original state says:

"player1 is at location pos54"

"stone1 is at location pos23"

"Location pos11 is clear"

...

"Location pos23 is clear"

So this is a contradiction. Because if the stone is at pos23, then pos23 is not clear. Therefore, this must be a mistake. But given that the problem states both, perhaps we have to proceed under the assumption that pos23 is not clear (i.e., the stone is there). Because otherwise, the problem is inconsistent. But the user provided this, so maybe it's a typo and "Location pos23 is clear" should be "Location pos23 is not clear". However, the problem states that "Location pos23 is clear" and "stone1 is at location pos23", which is impossible. Therefore, there's an error in the problem setup. But since we have to proceed, perhaps we can assume that the stone is at pos23 and thus pos23 is not clear. So the agent cannot move into pos23. Therefore, the earlier plan where the agent moves to pos24 and pushes the stone up to pos22 is valid because pos24 is clear.

But according to the problem's initial state, pos23 is clear. So the stone is not there. Wait, but the problem says "stone1 is at location pos23". This is a conflict. Therefore, there must be a mistake. However, since the user provided this, perhaps it's a test of handling such inconsistencies. But assuming that the initial state is correct as given, perhaps the stone is at pos23, and the location is not clear. Therefore, the "Location pos23 is clear" is a mistake, and the stone's presence makes it not clear. So the agent can't move into pos23. Thus, the earlier plan is correct.

Assuming that, the plan I outlined earlier is valid. Therefore, the correct sequence is the eight actions as described.
