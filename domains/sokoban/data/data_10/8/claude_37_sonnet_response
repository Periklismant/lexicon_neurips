Alright, I need to solve a Sokoban-like planning problem where the agent needs to push a stone to a goal location. Let's break down what's going on:

1. We have a 5x5 grid with locations referred to as "pos(x)(y)" where x and y are the row and column indices.
2. There's a single agent (player1) starting at pos54 and a single stone (stone1) at pos23.
3. The goal location is pos31.
4. The task is to get stone1 to the goal location (pos31).

Let's first understand the constraints:

1. player1 must be at location pos12 at some point.
2. If player1 is at pos12, then pos25 must not be clear at that state or a later state.
3. pos53 must not be clear at some point.
4. pos24 must not be clear for at most one continuous sequence of states.
5. Either stone1 is at pos33 or pos25 is not clear at some point.
6. pos44 must not be clear for at most one continuous sequence of states.
7. player1 is never at pos22.
8. player1 is at pos23 at some point.
9. If player1 is at pos23, then either player1 is at pos55 or pos44 is not clear at that state or a later state.
10. pos11 must not be clear for at most one continuous sequence of states.
11. Either stone1 is at pos24 or stone1 is at pos25 at some point.
12. Either pos43 is not clear or stone1 is at pos55 at some point.

Now, let's think about the plan. There are several constraints that require specific positions to be visited or avoided. We need to find a sequence of moves to get the stone to the goal location (pos31) while satisfying these constraints.

From the initial state:
- player1 is at pos54
- stone1 is at pos23
- pos31 is the goal location

To push stone1 to the goal location, player1 needs to be on the opposite side of the direction of the push. So, to push stone1 from pos23 to pos31 (which is to the right), player1 needs to be at pos13 (which is to the left of stone1).

Let me think about the possible paths to push stone1 to the goal location:

1. We could move player1 from pos54 to approach stone1 at pos23 from the left, which would be pos13.
2. Then, we could push stone1 from pos23 to the right, to pos33.
3. And then push it from pos33 to pos31, which is the goal.

But we need to ensure all the constraints are satisfied. Let me plan a bit more concretely, considering the constraints.

Actually, let me organize these constraints differently to help me better plan out the approach.

Constraints on player1's positions:
- player1 must be at location pos12 at some point.
- player1 is never at pos22.
- player1 is at pos23 at some point.
- If player1 is at pos23, then either player1 is at pos55 or pos44 is not clear at that state or a later state.

Constraints on stone1's positions:
- Either stone1 is at pos33 or pos25 is not clear at some point.
- Either stone1 is at pos24 or stone1 is at pos25 at some point.
- Either pos43 is not clear or stone1 is at pos55 at some point.

Constraints on other positions being not clear (implying either player1 or stone1 is there):
- If player1 is at pos12, then pos25 must not be clear at that state or a later state.
- pos53 must not be clear at some point.
- pos24 must not be clear for at most one continuous sequence of states.
- pos44 must not be clear for at most one continuous sequence of states.
- pos11 must not be clear for at most one continuous sequence of states.

Let's think about a plan that satisfies these constraints.

I'll start with a rough plan:
1. Move player1 from pos54 to pos12 (satisfying the first constraint).
2. Move player1 from pos12 to positions that will allow me to push stone1 to pos24 or pos25 (satisfying constraint 11).
3. Push stone1 to pos33 (satisfying constraint 5) and then to pos31 (the goal).
4. While doing this, we need to ensure the other constraints are met, including that player1 never goes to pos22 (constraint 7).

Let me sketch a more detailed plan. First off, I need to think of a path from pos54 to pos12 that avoids pos22:

Actually, before delving into specific paths, let me visualize the grid:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1  .  .  .  .  .
2  .  .  S  .  .
3  G  .  .  .  .
4  .  .  .  .  .
5  .  .  .  P  .
```

Where:
- P is player1 (at pos54)
- S is stone1 (at pos23)
- G is the goal location (at pos31)
- . are clear locations

Now, I can better plan a path.

From pos54, a path to pos12 could be:
pos54 -> pos53 -> pos43 -> pos33 -> pos23 -> pos13 -> pos12

But, there's a problem. When the player reaches pos23, they'll be colocated with stone1. This doesn't make sense, so I believe the stone's position is meant to be understood as "The location pos23 has a stone on it" not that it's clear. So, the player can't actually move to pos23 in the initial state.

I'll revise the visualization:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1  .  .  .  .  .
2  .  .  S  .  .
3  G  .  .  .  .
4  .  .  .  .  .
5  .  .  .  P  .
```

The player needs to find a path that goes around the stone, so they can push it.

From pos54, a revised path to pos12 could be:
pos54 -> pos44 -> pos34 -> pos24 -> pos14 -> pos13 -> pos12

No, I now see that there's actually an unclear statement in the problem. The locations are initially described as "Location pos23 is clear" but then in the initial state, both "player1 is at location pos54" and "stone1 is at location pos23". The player and the stone cannot be colocated with a clear location.

This suggests to me that "Location pos23 is clear" in this context means that there's no other object (like a wall) that would prevent movement, only the stone or the player. Let me reinterpret the descriptions:

- "Location posXY is clear": This means no stone or player is at this location.
- "player1 is at location posXY": The player is at this location, so it's not clear.
- "stone1 is at location posXY": The stone is at this location, so it's not clear.

Given this reinterpretation, the initial state has:
- player1 at pos54
- stone1 at pos23
- All other locations are clear.

But I just noticed the initial state also says "Location pos23 is clear" and "Location pos54 is clear", which is inconsistent with "player1 is at location pos54" and "stone1 is at location pos23". This is confusing me.

Actually, I'm misinterpreting the problem statement. Let me double-check the provided descriptions.

I think there's a misunderstanding. On re-reading, these facts were clearly about the initial state:
- "player1 is at location pos54"
- "stone1 is at location pos23"

But these ones were also listed:
- "Location pos23 is clear"
- "Location pos54 is clear"

This might suggest the stone and player are at those locations but they are considered "clear" for the purpose of movement. Perhaps the player and the stone do not make a location "not clear" in the way walls would.

Alternatively, and more likely, there's an error in the problem statement. Given the nature of the actions (move, pushtogoal, pushtonongoal), it makes sense that a location with a stone or a player is not considered clear.

Let's re-review my interpretation of the actions:

1. "move p l_from l_to d": Move agent p from l_from to l_to in direction d.
   Preconditions: p is at l_from, l_to is clear, and you can move from l_from to l_to in direction d.
   Effects: p is no longer at l_from, l_to is no longer clear, p is at l_to, and l_from is now clear.

2. "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Agent p at l_p pushes stone s from l_from to the goal location l_to in direction d.
   Preconditions: p is at l_p, s is at l_from, l_to is clear, you can move from l_p to l_from in direction d, you can move from l_from to l_to in direction d, and l_to is a goal.
   Effects: p is no longer at l_p, s is no longer at l_from, l_to is no longer clear, p is at l_from, s is at l_to, l_p is now clear, and s is at a goal.

3. "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Agent p at l_p pushes stone s from l_from to the non-goal location l_to in direction d.
   Preconditions: p is at l_p, s is at l_from, l_to is clear, you can move from l_p to l_from in direction d, you can move from l_from to l_to in direction d, and l_to is not a goal.
   Effects: p is no longer at l_p, s is no longer at l_from, l_to is no longer clear, p is at l_from, s is at l_to, l_p is now clear, and s is at a non-goal.

Ok, so based on the preconditions and effects, the interpretations I was using are correct. A location is either clear or has a stone or player on it, not both. I believe the contradictory statements in the initial state are an error in the problem statement. If there really was a contradiction, one of the precondition tests would detect it.

For the purpose of this problem, I'll assume the more specific statements are correct:
- "player1 is at location pos54"
- "stone1 is at location pos23"

And the general statements, which are contradictory in this case, are in error:
- "Location pos23 is clear"
- "Location pos54 is clear"

With this clarification, let's proceed with the planning.

**Starting position:**
```
   1  2  3  4  5
1  .  .  .  .  .
2  .  .  S  .  .
3  G  .  .  .  .
4  .  .  .  .  .
5  .  .  .  P  .
```

I need to get the stone to the goal position at (3,1).

Path 1 (to satisfy the constraint that player1 must be at pos12 at some point):
1. pos54 -> pos53
2. pos53 -> pos43
3. pos43 -> pos33
4. pos33 -> pos32
5. pos32 -> pos31
6. pos31 -> pos21
7. pos21 -> pos11
8. pos11 -> pos12

This takes the player to pos12, and avoids pos22, satisfying two constraints. But let me consider the next constraint:

If player1 is at pos12, then pos25 must not be clear at that state or a later state.

This means either player1 or stone1 needs to be at pos25 when player1 is at pos12 or later. Since player1 can't be in two places at once, this means I must push the stone to pos25 at some point.

But I also have the constraint:
Either stone1 is at pos24 or stone1 is at pos25 at some point.

So, for both of these constraints to be satisfied, I'll aim to get stone1 to pos25 (satisfying both at once).

But I still need to figure out how to get the stone from pos23 to pos25, and then from pos25 to the goal at pos31.

The agent starts at pos54, and the stone is at pos23. First, I need to get the agent to a position where it can push the stone.
But then I also have the constraints:
- player1 is at pos23 at some point.
- If player1 is at pos23, then either player1 is at pos55 or pos44 is not clear at that state or a later state.

This means I need to ensure player1 visits pos23 and after that, either visits pos55 or ensures that pos44 is not clear.

I'll update my plan:

1. The player starts at pos54, the stone is at pos23. Let me align these two positions. stone1 is at position (2,3).
2. To push stone1 from pos23, player1 must be adjacent to it.
   - To push it down to pos24, player1 must be at pos22. But the constraint says player1 is never at pos22, so that's not an option.
   - To push it up to pos22, player1 must be at pos24. But that might not be the direction we want to go.
   - To push it left to pos13, player1 must be at pos33. That's a possibility, but we need to consider the final goal at pos31.
   - To push it right to pos33, player1 must be at pos13. That's another possibility.
3. Let me try to push stone1 from pos23 to pos33, then to pos32, then to pos31 (the goal). This means player1 must first get to pos13.
   Path for player1 from pos54 to pos13: pos54 -> pos53 -> pos43 -> pos33 -> pos23 (satisfying the constraint that player1 is at pos23 at some point) -> pos13.
   From pos13, player1 can push stone1 from pos23 to pos33. Then, player1 would be at pos23.
   From pos23, player1 can push stone1 from pos33 to pos32. Then, player1 would be at pos33.
   From pos33, player1 can push stone1 from pos32 to pos31 (the goal). Then, player1 would be at pos32.

Wait, I missed one constraint: pos25 must not be clear, so stone1 must be there (or player1 must), and this must be satisfied after or at the same time player1 is at pos12.  So, instead, I'm thinking the stone1 could be:

1. pushed from pos23 to pos24 (to satisfy the constraint that stone1 must be at pos24 or pos25 at some point) - This would mean player1 is at pos22, which violates a constraint.

I'm getting a bit confused, but let me just try pushing stone1 around the different corners of the room, and then I will check on the constraints again.

Let me try working backward from the goal. The goal is to get stone1 to pos31. To push stone1 to pos31, player1 must be adjacent to it and pushing it in the direction of pos31. For example, if stone1 is at pos32, player1 would push it from pos33, and then player1 would end up at pos32 and stone1 at pos31.

Let's try to find a path where stone1 moves to pos25 (satisfying the constraint that stone1 should be at pos24 or pos25), and also consider constraints about player1 being at pos12 and pos23.

Let me try to find a path where stone1 moves to pos25, then to pos35, then to pos34, then to pos33, then to pos32, and finally to pos31 (the goal).

To push stone1 from pos23 to pos24, player1 must be at pos22. But there's a constraint that player1 is never at pos22, so that means I can't push stone1 from pos23 to pos24 directly.

Let's try to find a path where stone1 moves from pos23 to pos33, then to pos32, and finally to pos31 (the goal). This path doesn't get stone1 to pos24 or pos25, but there's another constraint which says either stone1 is at pos33 or pos25 is not clear. By getting stone1 to pos33, we'd satisfy that.

But then we still have the constraint that either stone1 is at pos24 or stone1 is at pos25. And then there's also the constraint that if player1 is at pos12, pos25 must not be clear.

So, I've got a challenge. Let me see if I can find a path that takes stone1 through all of pos33, pos24, and pos25, to ensure I satisfy all constraints.

Wait, I'm overcomplicating this. Stone1 only needs to be at one of the positions in most of these constraints.

Let me try a different approach: I'll aim to push stone1 from pos23 to pos33, then to pos32, and finally to pos31 (the goal). And I'll try to ensure player1 is at pos12 at some point, and also pos23 at some point. Additionally, I need to make sure that after player1 is at pos12, pos25 is not clear (meaning either stone1 or player1 is there).

Ok, the constraints that I'm struggling with are:
- If player1 is at pos12, then pos25 must not be clear at that state or a later state.
- Either stone1 is at pos24 or stone1 is at pos25 at some point.

Let me try:
1. Player1 starts at pos54.
2. I'll move player1 to get close to stone1, which is at pos23.
3. I'll move player1 to pos13, then push stone1 from pos23 to pos33 (satisfying the constraint that stone1 is at pos33 or pos25 is not clear).
4. I'll have player1 at pos23, then after pushing stone1.
5. From here, I need player1 to move to pos12 at some point. And after that, stone1 or player1 must be at pos25.
6. I could move player1 from pos23 to pos24, then to pos25, then to pos15, then to pos14, then to pos13, and finally to pos12. This would ensure player1 is at pos12 as required.
7. But then I need to ensure pos25 is not clear after player1 is at pos12. I can do this by moving stone1 to pos25 after player1 leaves it.
8. From pos33, I could move stone1 to pos34, then to pos35, and finally to pos25. This requires moving player1 from pos12 to pos34 (going through pos13, pos14, pos24, and pos34).
9. After pushing stone1 to pos25, player1 would be at pos35. From there, I'd need to push stone1 back to pos31 (the goal). This can be done by pushing it to pos35, then to pos34, then to pos33, then to pos32, and finally to pos31.

Oof the planning is getting complex, but I can sort of verify that all these steps ensure the constraints are met. Let me now start specifying the actual plan using the defined actions.

So my plan involves:
1. Player1 starts at pos54. Let's navigate to pos13 to push stone1, which is at pos23.
2. Move stone1 to pos33.
3. Move player1 to pos12.
4. Move stone1 to pos25.
5. Move stone1 to the goal at pos31.

Actually, let me just try a basic approach first. Starting with player1 at pos54 and stone1 at pos23, I'll try to find a sequence of moves to get stone1 to pos31 (the goal). Then, I'll check if all constraints are satisfied or if I need to modify the plan.

From pos54, player1 must get to a position where it can push stone1 from pos23. That means player1 must be at one of pos13 (to push right), pos33 (to push left), or pos24 (to push up).

Let me create a simple plan to navigate to pos13 and then push stone1 to pos31:

1. Move player1 from pos54 to pos44 using move.
2. Move player1 from pos44 to pos34 using move.
3. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24 using move.
4. Move player1 from pos24 to pos14 using move.
5. Move player1 from pos14 to pos13 using move.
6. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos33 using pushtonongoal. (this also satisfies one of the constraints that player1 is at pos23 at some point)
7. Move player1 from pos23 to pos33 using move.
8. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos32 using pushtonongoal. (player1 is at pos33, and stone1 is at pos32)
9. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32 using move.
10. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos31 using pushtogoal. (player1 is at pos32, and stone1 is at pos31 (the goal))

Let me check if this plan satisfies all the constraints:

1. player1 must be at location pos12 at some point. - No, this is not satisfied.
2. If player1 is at pos12, then pos25 must not be clear at that state or a later state. - Not applicable since player1 is never at pos12 in this plan.
3. pos53 must not be clear at some point. - No, this is not satisfied in this plan.
4. pos24 must not be clear for at most one continuous sequence of states. - Yes, this is satisfied. pos24 is not clear when player1 is there once.
5. Either stone1 is at pos33 or pos25 is not clear at some point. - Yes, stone1 is at pos33 at one point.
6. pos44 must not be clear for at most one continuous sequence of states. - Yes, this is satisfied. pos44 is not clear when player1 is there once.
7. player1 is never at pos22. - Yes, this is satisfied. player1 never goes to pos22.
8. player1 is at pos23 at some point. - Yes, this is satisfied. player1 is at pos23 after pushing stone1.
9. If player1 is at pos23, then either player1 is at pos55 or pos44 is not clear at that state or a later state. - Yes, pos44 is not clear at an earlier state, so it's satisfied.
10. pos11 must not be clear for at most one continuous sequence of states. - Yes, this is satisfied. pos11 remains clear throughout.
11. Either stone1 is at pos24 or stone1 is at pos25 at some point. - No, this is not satisfied.
12. Either pos43 is not clear or stone1 is at pos55 at some point. - No, this is not satisfied.

It looks like I need to modify the plan to satisfy the constraints 1, 3, 11, and 12. Let me work on an updated plan.

I notice constraint 11 requires stone1 to be at pos24 or pos25. But to move stone1 from its starting position at pos23 to pos24, player1 would need to be at pos22, which is not allowed according to constraint 7. So, the constraint is forcing the stone to be at pos25 at some point.

And, combined with constraint 1 and 2, player1 must be at pos12 and after that, pos25 must not be clear. So, after player1 has been at pos12, either player1 or stone1 must be at pos25.

Taking a step back, let me remember my goal is to get stone1 to pos31. Let's use a slightly different approach. I'm going to plan a path for stone1 to go through pos25 and pos33 (to satisfy constraints 5 and 11), and for player1 to go through pos12 and pos23 (to satisfy constraints 1 and 8).

Let me try:
1. Move player1 from pos54 to pos53 using move.
2. Move player1 from pos53 to pos43 using move.
3. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 using move.
4. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 using move.
5. Move player1 from pos23 to pos24 using move. (stone1 is at pos23)
6. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos13 using pushtonongoal. (player1 is at pos24, and stone1 is at pos13)
7. Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 using move.
8. Push stone1 from pos13 to pos14 using pushtonongoal. (player1 is at pos13, and stone1 is at pos14)
9. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14 using move.
10. Push stone1 from pos14 to pos15 using pushtonongoal. (player1 is at pos14, and stone1 is at pos15)
11. Move player1 from pos14 to pos15 using move.
12. Push stone1 from pos15 to pos25 using pushtonongoal. (player1 is at pos15, and stone1 is at pos25) This satisfies constraint 11.
13. Move player1 from pos15 to pos14 using move.
14. Move player1 from pos14 to pos13 using move.
15. Move player1 from pos13 to pos12 using move. (This satisfies constraint 1, and the subsequent constraint 2 is also satisfied since stone1 is at pos25)
16. Move player1 from pos12 to pos13 using move.
17. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14 using move.
18. Move player1 from pos14 to pos24 using move.
19. Move player1 from pos24 to pos25 using move.
20. Push stone1 from pos25 to pos35 using pushtonongoal. (player1 is at pos25, and stone1 is at pos35)
21. Move player1 from pos25 to pos35 using move.
22. Push stone1 from pos35 to pos34 using pushtonongoal. (player1 is at pos35, and stone1 is at pos34)
23. Move player1 from pos35 to pos34 using move.
24. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos33 using pushtonongoal. (player1 is at pos34, and stone1 is at pos33) This satisfies constraint 5.
25. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33 using move.
26. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos32 using pushtonongoal. (player1 is at pos33, and stone1 is at pos32)
27. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32 using move.
28. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos31 using pushtogoal. (player1 is at pos32, and stone1 is at pos31 (the goal))

Ok let me double check to see if this satisfies all constraints:

1. player1 must be at location pos12 at some point. - Yes, this is satisfied.
2. If player1 is at pos12, then pos25 must not be clear at that state or a later state. - Yes, this is satisfied. stone1 is at pos25 when player1 is at pos12.
3. pos53 must not be clear at some point. - Yes, this is satisfied. player1 is at pos53 at one point.
4. pos24 must not be clear for at most one continuous sequence of states. - Yes, this is satisfied. pos24 is not clear when player1 is there in steps 5 and 18-19.
   Actually steps 18-19 seems to violate constraint 4. Let me find a way around this...
5. Either stone1 is at pos33 or pos25 is not clear at some point. - Yes, this is satisfied. stone1 is at pos33 in step 24, and pos25 is not clear when stone1 is there in steps 12-19 and when player1 is there in step 20.
6. pos44 must not be clear for at most one continuous sequence of states. - Yes, this is satisfied. pos44 is always clear in this plan.
   Actually, the constraint says it must not be clear at most once in a continuous sequence, so it doesn't have to be not clear ever, but I think I need to make sure it is not clear because of constraint 9.
7. player1 is never at pos22. - Yes, this is satisfied. player1 never goes to pos22.
8. player1 is at pos23 at some point. - Yes, this is satisfied. player1 is at pos23 in step 4.
9. If player1 is at pos23, then either player1 is at pos55 or pos44 is not clear at that state or a later state. - This is not satisfied. After player1 is at pos23, neither player1 is at pos55 nor pos44 is not clear.
10. pos11 must not be clear for at most one continuous sequence of states. - Yes, this is satisfied. pos11 remains clear throughout.
11. Either stone1 is at pos24 or stone1 is at pos25 at some point. - Yes, this is satisfied. stone1 is at pos25 in steps 12-19.
12. Either pos43 is not clear or stone1 is at pos55 at some point. - Yes, this is satisfied. pos43 is not clear when player1 is there in step 3.

I still have some issues with constraints 4, 6, and 9. Let me adjust my plan and fix the issues with constraint 4, the other two are  fine (constraint 6 isn't violated, and I misunderstood constraint 9).

For constraint 4, I need to ensure that pos24 is not clear for at most one continuous sequence of states. I was having player1 go through pos24 twice, which would violate this constraint. Let me fix this.

For constraint 9, I need to ensure that after player1 is at pos23, either player1 is at pos55 or pos44 is not clear.

Let me revamp my approach to satisfy these remaining constraints:

1. Move player1 from pos54 to pos44 using move. (This makes pos44 not clear, so I'll satisfy the constraints 6 and 9 by having player1 go to pos23 first, then pos44 becomes not clear later)
2. Move player1 from pos44 to pos34 using move.
3. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33 using move.
4. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 using move. (This satisfies constraint 8)
5. Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 using move.
6. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos33 using pushtonongoal. (This satisfies constraint 5)
7. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14 using move.
8. Move player1 from pos14 to pos15 using move.
9. Move player1 from pos15 to pos25 using move.
10. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos34 using pushtonongoal.
11. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos35 using pushtonongoal.
12. Push stone1 from pos35 to pos25 using pushtonongoal. (This satisfies constraint 11)
13. Move player1 from pos35 to pos34 using move.
14. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24 using move. (This is where pos24 becomes not clear, so I need to ensure it doesn't become not clear again)
15. Move player1 from pos24 to pos14 using move.
16. Move player1 from pos14 to pos13 using move.
17. Move player1 from pos13 to pos12 using move. (This satisfies constraint 1, and the subsequent constraint 2 is also satisfied since stone1 is at pos25)
18. Move player1 from pos12 to pos11 using move. (This makes pos11 not clear, satisfying constraint 10)
19. Move player1 from pos11 to pos21 using move.
20. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 using move.
21. Move player1 from pos31 to pos41 using move.
22. Move player1 from pos41 to pos51 using move.
23. Move player1 from pos51 to pos52 using move.
24. Move player1 from pos52 to pos53 using move. (This satisfies constraint 3)
25. Move player1 from pos53 to pos43 using move. (This makes pos43 not clear, satisfying constraint 12)
26. Move player1 from pos43 to pos44 using move.
27. Move player1 from pos44 to pos45 using move.
28. Move player1 from pos45 to pos55 using move. (This ensures that after player1 is at pos23, either player1 is at pos55 or pos44 is not clear at that state or a later state, satisfying constraint 9)
29. Move player1 from pos55 to pos54 using move.
30. Move player1 from pos54 to pos53 using move.
31. Move player1 from pos53 to pos43 using move.
32. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 using move.
33. Move player1 from pos33 to pos34 using move.
34. Move player1 from pos34 to pos35 using move.
35. Move player1 from pos35 to pos25 using move.
36. Push stone1 from pos25 to pos35 using pushtonongoal.
37. Push stone1 from pos35 to pos34 using pushtonongoal.
38. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos33 using pushtonongoal.
39. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos32 using pushtonongoal.
40. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos31 using pushtogoal. (Now stone1 is at the goal, pos31)

Let me make sure this satisfies all constraints:

1. player1 must be at location pos12 at some point. - Yes, this is satisfied in step 17.
2. If player1 is at pos12, then pos25 must not be clear at that state or a later state. - Yes, this is satisfied. stone1 is at pos25 when player1 is at pos12.
3. pos53 must not be clear at some point. - Yes, this is satisfied. player1 is at pos53 in steps 24 and 30.
4. pos24 must not be clear for at most one continuous sequence of states. - Yes, this is satisfied. pos24 is not clear when player1 is there only in step 14.
5. Either stone1 is at pos33 or pos25 is not clear at some point. - Yes, this is satisfied. stone1 is at pos33 in steps 6 and 38, and pos25 is not clear when stone1 is there in steps 12-35 and when player1 is there in step 35.
6. pos44 must not be clear for at most one continuous sequence of states. - Yes, this is satisfied. pos44 is not clear when player1 is there in steps 1 and 26.
7. player1 is never at pos22. - Yes, this is satisfied. player1 never goes to pos22.
8. player1 is at pos23 at some point. - Yes, this is satisfied. player1 is at pos23 in step 4.
9. If player1 is at pos23, then either player1 is at pos55 or pos44 is not clear at that state or a later state. - Yes, this is satisfied. After player1 is at pos23 in step 4, player1 is at pos55 in step 28 and pos44 is not clear when player1 is there in step 26.
10. pos11 must not be clear for at most one continuous sequence of states. - Yes, this is satisfied. pos11 is not clear when player1 is there in step 18.
11. Either stone1 is at pos24 or stone1 is at pos25 at some point. - Yes, this is satisfied. stone1 is at pos25 in steps 12-35.
12. Either pos43 is not clear or stone1 is at pos55 at some point. - Yes, this is satisfied. pos43 is not clear when player1 is there in steps 25 and 31.

Wait, I think I'm off by one on the count of steps in which stone1 gets pushed; if stone1 starts at pos23, and in step 6 player1 pushes it from pos23 to pos33, then player1 should end up at pos23 after that. But after that I say player1 moves from pos13 to pos14. So there's something wrong with my bookkeeping, and I'm going to redo this sequence.

Ok ignore the previous plans, let me state the plan from scratch. For each action, I'll show the action name, the current positions of player1 and stone1, and the state after the action is performed.

Starting state:
- player1 is at pos54
- stone1 is at pos23

1. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirdown: player1 is at pos54, player1 moves to pos44, player1 is now at pos44.
2. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft: player1 is at pos44, player1 moves to pos34, player1 is now at pos34.
3. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup: player1 is at pos34, player1 moves to pos33, player1 is now at pos33.
4. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft: player1 is at pos33, player1 moves to pos23, player1 is now at pos23. (This satisfies constraint 8)

Wait, Sokoban doesn't work that way. The stone is at pos23, so player1 can't move there. I'm forgetting the basic mechanic of this puzzle. Let me rethink this from scratch.

In Sokoban, the player can't move to a position where a stone is. Instead, the player can push the stone if they're adjacent to it and the space on the other side of the stone is clear.

Let me visualize the grid again:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1  .  .  .  .  .
2  .  .  S  .  .
3  G  .  .  .  .
4  .  .  .  .  .
5  .  .  .  P  .
```

No actually I see my issue. The stone is at pos23, but the problem is that we're interpreting the grid differently when we draw it.

Let's be super careful. Pos23 means position (2, 3), which is row 2, column 3. Grid positions are usually labeled as (row, col).

So, in our 5x5 grid, the stone is at position (2, 3), and the agent is at position (5, 4). The goal is at position (3, 1).

```
   1  2  3  4  5   
1  .  .  .  .  .   
2  .  .  S  .  .   
3  G  .  .  .  .   
4  .  .  .  .  .   
5  .  .  .  P  .   
```

But then again, the location labels in the problem are of the form "posXY", which suggests X is the row and Y is the column. So, pos23 would be row 2, column 3, which is consistent with my visualization. If I'm wrong, I should notice the action outputs won't be correct.

So player1 is at pos54, stone1 is at pos23. Let me think of actions that let us push the stone1 from pos23.

1. To push stone1 from pos23 to pos33 (right), player1 must be at pos13.
2. To push stone1 from pos23 to pos13 (left), player1 must be at pos33.
3. To push stone1 from pos23 to pos22 (up), player1 must be at pos24.
4. To push stone1 from pos23 to pos24 (down), player1 must be at pos22. But constraint 7 says player1 is never at pos22, so I can't do this.

But I'm not considering the original constraints. I need to focus on the basics first.

To push stone1 from pos23 to any direction, player1 must be adjacent to it (pos13, pos33, pos22, or pos24). So the first step is to get player1 next to stone1. From pos54, I need to navigate to one of these four positions. But constraint 7 says player1 is never at pos22, so I can't go there. Let's say I navigate player1 to pos13.

Starting state:
- player1 is at pos54
- stone1 is at pos23

1. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft: player1 is at pos54, player1 moves to pos44, player1 is now at pos44.
2. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft: player1 is at pos44, player1 moves to pos34, player1 is now at pos34.
3. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft: player1 is at pos34, player1 moves to pos24, player1 is now at pos24.
4. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft: player1 is at pos24, player1 moves to pos14, player1 is now at pos14.
5. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup: player1 is at pos14, player1 moves to pos13, player1 is now at pos13.
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirright: player1 is at pos13, stone1 is at pos23, player1 pushes stone1 to pos33, player1 is now at pos23 (satisfying constraint 8), stone1 is now at pos33 (satisfying constraint 5).
7. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft: player1 is at pos23, player1 moves to pos13, player1 is now at pos13.
8. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup: player1 is at pos13, player1 moves to pos12, player1 is now at pos12. (This satisfies constraint 1, but now we need to make pos25 not clear as per constraint 2)
9. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown: player1 is at pos12, player1 moves to pos13, player1 is now at pos13.
10. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown: player1 is at pos13, player1 moves to pos14, player1 is now at pos14.
11. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright: player1 is at pos14, player1 moves to pos24, player1 is now at pos24. Wait, I've already made pos24 not clear in step 3... I'm going to violate constraint 4 if I'm not careful. Let me rethink...

In the above plan, player1 makes pos24 not clear twice (in steps 3 and 11). This would violate constraint 4 which says pos24 must not be clear for at most one continuous sequence of states. So, I need to find a different path to satisfy constraint 2.

Let me try a different approach...

Let me continue from step 8. I said:
8. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup: player1 is at pos13, player1 moves to pos12, player1 is now at pos12. (This satisfies constraint 1, but now we need to make pos25 not clear as per constraint 2)

Let's alter the plan from there:

9. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown: player1 is at pos12, player1 moves to pos13, player1 is now at pos13.
10. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright: player1 is at pos13, player1 moves to pos23, player1 is now at pos23.
11. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright: player1 is at pos23, player1 moves to pos33, player1 is now at pos33. (stone1 was pushed from pos23 to pos33 in step 6)
12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos34 dirdown: player1 is at pos33, stone1 is at pos33, player1 pushes stone1 to pos34, player1 is now at pos33, stone1 is now at pos34.
13. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown: player1 is at pos33, player1 moves to pos34, player1 is now at pos34.
14. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos34 pos35 dirdown: player1 is at pos34, stone1 is at pos34, player1 pushes stone1 to pos35, player1 is now at pos34, stone1 is now at pos35.
15. move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown: player1 is at pos34, player1 moves to pos35, player1 is now at pos35.
16. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos35 pos25 dirleft: player1 is at pos35, stone1 is at pos35, player1 pushes stone1 to pos25, player1 is now at pos35, stone1 is now at pos25. (This satisfies constraint 2, as pos25 is not clear after player1 has been at pos12. It also satisfies constraint 11, as stone1 is now at pos25.)

Now, I need to get stone1 to the goal at pos31. From pos25, I'll try to push it to pos31 by navigating through the grid.

17. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup: player1 is at pos35, player1 moves to pos34, player1 is now at pos34.
18. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup: player1 is at pos34, player1 moves to pos33, player1 is now at pos33.
19. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright: player1 is at pos33, player1 moves to pos43, player1 is now at pos43. (This satisfies constraint 12, as pos43 is not clear.)
20. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright: player1 is at pos43, player1 moves to pos53, player1 is now at pos53. (This satisfies constraint 3, as pos53 is not clear.)
21. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown: player1 is at pos53, player1 moves to pos54, player1 is now at pos54.
22. move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown: player1 is at pos54, player1 moves to pos55, player1 is now at pos55. (This satisfies constraint 9, as after player1 has been at pos23, player1 is at pos55.)

Now, I need to push stone1 from pos25 to the goal at pos31. From pos25, I can push it to pos15, then to pos14, then to pos13, then to pos23, then to pos33, then to pos32, and finally to pos31.

23. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft: player1 is at pos55, player1 moves to pos45, player1 is now at pos45.
24. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft: player1 is at pos45, player1 moves to pos35, player1 is now at pos35.
25. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos25 pos15 dirleft: player1 is at pos35, stone1 is at pos25, player1 pushes stone1 to pos15, player1 is now at pos25, stone1 is now at pos15.
26. move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft: player1 is at pos25, player1 moves to pos15, player1 is now at pos15.
27. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos15 pos15 pos14 dirup: player1 is at pos15, stone1 is at pos15, player1 pushes stone1 to pos14, player1 is now at pos15, stone1 is now at pos14.
28. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup: player1 is at pos15, player1 moves to pos14, player1 is now at pos14.
29. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos14 pos13 dirup: player1 is at pos14, stone1 is at pos14, player1 pushes stone1 to pos13, player1 is now at pos14, stone1 is now at pos13.
30. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup: player1 is at pos14, player1 moves to pos13, player1 is now at pos13.
31. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos13 pos23 dirright: player1 is at pos13, stone1 is at pos13, player1 pushes stone1 to pos23, player1 is now at pos13, stone1 is now at pos23.
32. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright: player1 is at pos13, player1 moves to pos23, player1 is now at pos23.
33. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos23 pos33 dirright: player1 is at pos23, stone1 is at pos23, player1 pushes stone1 to pos33, player1 is now at pos23, stone1 is now at pos33.
34. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright: player1 is at pos23, player1 moves to pos33, player1 is now at pos33.
35. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos32 dirup: player1 is at pos33, stone1 is at pos33, player1 pushes stone1 to pos32, player1 is now at pos33, stone1 is now at pos32.
36. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup: player1 is at pos33, player1 moves to pos32, player1 is now at pos32.
37. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos32 pos31 dirup: player1 is at pos32, stone1 is at pos32, player1 pushes stone1 to pos31, player1 is now at pos32, stone1 is now at pos31 (the goal).

Wait, I'm making an error with using the push actions. In my step 37, I say "player1 pushes stone1 from pos32 to pos31," implying stone1 is at pos32 and player1 is at pos33 pushing it. But in step 36, I moved player1 to pos32. So, player1 is colocated with stone1... which doesn't make sense.

I think I'm misunderstanding the push action format. Let me review it again.

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.

Based on the wording, I interpreted it as "The agent p is at location l_p, and pushes stone s from location l_from to location l_to in direction d." This means l_p and l_from are adjacent positions, and the agent uses its move to push the stone from l_from to l_to. It doesn't mean the agent and the stone are at the same position.

I think this interpretation might need a revision. Either way, I've been getting the locations of the agent very wrong.

Let's review the preconditions for the push action:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is a goal location.

Based on the precondition (iv), the agent must be at a position l_p such that they can get to l_from in direction d. This means the agent and the stone are not at the same position; they're adjacent. Then the agent uses its move to push the stone.

Further, the effect of the action says:

"After performing this action, (i) agent p is no longer at location l_p, (ii) stone s is no longer at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is no longer clear, (iv) agent p is at location l_from, (v) stone s is at location l_to, (vi) location l_p is clear, and (vi) stone s is at a goal state."

So, after the push, the agent is at the position the stone was previously at, and the stone is at a new position in the direction of the push. This is consistent with how Sokoban works.

Let's fix my step by step then:

Starting state:
- player1 is at pos54
- stone1 is at pos23

1. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft: player1 is at pos54, player1 moves to pos44, player1 is now at pos44.
2. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft: player1 is at pos44, player1 moves to pos34, player1 is now at pos34.
3. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft: player1 is at pos34, player1 moves to pos24, player1 is now at pos24.
4. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft: player1 is at pos24, player1 moves to pos14, player1 is now at pos14.
5. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup: player1 is at pos14, player1 moves to pos13, player1 is now at pos13.
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirright: player1 is at pos13, stone1 is at pos23, player1 pushes stone1 to pos33, player1 is now at pos23 (satisfying constraint 8), stone1 is now at pos33 (satisfying constraint 5).
7. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft: player1 is at pos23, player1 moves to pos13, player1 is now at pos13.
8. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup: player1 is at pos13, player1 moves to pos12, player1 is now at pos12. (This satisfies constraint 1, but now we need to make pos25 not clear as per constraint 2)

Now we have:
- player1 is at pos12
- stone1 is at pos33

9. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown: player1 is at pos12, player1 moves to pos13, player1 is now at pos13.
10. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright: player1 is at pos13, player1 moves to pos23, player1 is now at pos23.
11. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright: player1 is at pos23, player1 moves to pos33, player1 is now at pos33.

Ugh, this is wrong again. If stone1 is at pos33, player1 can't move to pos33. I've clearly been making a mistake on tracking the state.

I'm going to pause, take a step back, and re-examine my approach. The issue is that I keep forgetting to account for the current state, and I'm getting confused when I move the agent and the stone.

Hmm, I just realized I'm misunderstanding the representation in the problem. I've been assuming the objects are in unique positions (i.e., the stone and player can't occupy the same position). But the problem says "each position may contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty," which means they're mutually exclusive.

I'll reframe the problem's description and restart my approach.

Let's restart the planning carefully, tracking the states after each action.

Starting state:
- player1 is at pos54
- stone1 is at pos23
- All other locations are clear.
- pos31 is a goal location.

Let's think of a plan to get stone1 to the goal location pos31. The constraint to always keep in mind is that player1 is never at pos22 (constraint 7). This means the player can never pass through or be at pos22.

Let's sketch a plan to get stone1 from pos23 to the goal location pos31. From pos23, I need to navigate stone1 to pos33, then to pos32, and finally to pos31. This means I need player1 to push stone1 from the opposite side. For the first push (from pos23 to pos33), player1 must be at pos13. For the second push (from pos33 to pos32), player1 must be at pos34. For the final push (from pos32 to pos31), player1 must be at pos33.

But I also have other constraints to consider, like player1 must be at pos12 at some point (constraint 1), and after that, pos25 must not be clear (constraint 2). Also, pos24 can only be not clear for a continuous sequence (constraint 4), which means player1 can only pass through pos24 once.

I'll try to incorporate these constraints into my plan:

Let me move player1 from pos54 to pos13 to push stone1 from pos23 to pos33.

1. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft: player1 at pos54, moves to pos44.
2. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft: player1 at pos44, moves to pos34.
3. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft: player1 at pos44, moves to pos24. (This makes pos24 not clear for one continuous sequence, as per constraint 4)
4. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft: player1 at pos24, moves to pos14.
5. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup: player1 at pos14, moves to pos13.
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirright: player1 at pos13, pushes stone1 from pos23 to pos33. After the action, player1 is at pos23 (satisfying constraint 8) and stone1 is at pos33 (satisfying constraint 5).

Now I need to get player1 to pos12 (to satisfy constraint 1). I can do this by moving player1 from pos23 to pos13, then to pos12.

7. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft: player1 at pos23, moves to pos13.
8. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup: player1 at pos13, moves to pos12. (This satisfies constraint 1)

After player1 is at pos12, I need to ensure pos25 is not clear at some point (constraint 2). This means either player1 or stone1 should be at pos25. Let's move stone1 to pos25.

9. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown: player1 at pos12, moves to pos13.
10. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright: player1 at pos13, moves to pos23.
11. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown: player1 at pos23, moves to pos24.
12. move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown: player1 at pos24, moves to pos25.
13. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright: player1 at pos25, moves to pos35.
14. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup: player1 at pos35, moves to pos34.
15. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos23 dirleft: player1 at pos34, pushes stone1 from pos33 to pos23. After the action, player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos23.
16. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown: player1 at pos33, moves to pos34.
17. move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown: player1 at pos34, moves to pos35.
18. move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft: player1 at pos35, moves to pos25.
19. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos23 pos24 dirdown: player1 at pos25, pushes stone1 from pos23 to pos24. After the action, player1 is at pos23 and stone1 is at pos24. (This satisfies constraint 11)
20. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown: player1 at pos23, moves to pos24.
21. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos24 pos25 dirdown: player1 at pos24, pushes stone1 from pos24 to pos25. After the action, player1 is at pos24 and stone1 is at pos25. (This satisfies constraint 2, as pos25 is not clear after player1 has been at pos12)

Great, now I need to get stone1 to the goal location pos31. From pos25, I need to navigate stone1 back to pos33, then to pos32, and finally to pos31.

22. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup: player1 at pos24, moves to pos23.
23. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright: player1 at pos23, moves to pos33.
24. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright: player1 at pos33, moves to pos43. (This satisfies constraint 12, as pos43 is not clear)
25. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright: player1 at pos43, moves to pos53. (This satisfies constraint 3, as pos53 is not clear)
26. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown: player1 at pos53, moves to pos54.
27. move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown: player1 at pos54, moves to pos55. (This satisfies constraint 9, as after player1 has been at pos23, player1 is at pos55)
28. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft: player1 at pos55, moves to pos45.
29. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft: player1 at pos45, moves to pos35.
30. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos25 pos15 dirleft: player1 at pos35, pushes stone1 from pos25 to pos15. After the action, player1 is at pos25 and stone1 is at pos15.
31. move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft: player1 at pos25, moves to pos15.
32. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos15 pos15 pos14 dirup: player1 at pos15, pushes stone1 from pos15 to pos14. After the action, player1 is at pos15 and stone1 is at pos14.

OK, I'm confused here. If player1 is at pos15 (as I said in step 31), then how can player1 push stone1 from pos15 in step 32? The stone would have to be adjacent to player1, not at the same position.

I think I'm fundamentally misunderstanding some of the mechanics or predicates of the problem. Let me once again review the problem description carefully.

Given the push action description:
"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to non-goal location l_to, following direction d.

The preconditions for this action include:
- agent p is at location l_p,
- stone s is at location l_from,
- location l_to is clear,
- you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d,
- you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d,
- location l_to is not a goal location.

The fourth precondition suggests that the agent and the stone are not at the same position; the agent must be able to get from its position (l_p) to the stone's position (l_from) by moving in direction d. This aligns with the traditional Sokoban mechanic of pushing a stone from behind.

But I've been assuming the agent must directly push the stone, which seems to be wrong.

Let me revise my planning based on a more careful reading for the push action. The agent doesn't need to be adjacent to the stone. Instead, it needs to be at a position such that it can move to the stone's position in the direction d. From the precondiition "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d", this means if the stone is at position A and I want to push it to position B in direction d, then the agent will first move from its position to position A (replacing the stone), and the stone will move to position B.

Let's replan:

Starting state:
- player1 is at pos54
- stone1 is at pos23
- All other locations are clear.
- pos31 is a goal location.

I need to move stone1 to the goal location pos31. Let's first find a path to get player1 to pos12 (constraint 1).

1. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft: player1 at pos54, moves to pos44.
2. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft: player1 at pos44, moves to pos34.
3. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft: player1 at pos34, moves to pos24. (This makes pos24 not clear for one continuous sequence, as per constraint 4)
4. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft: player1 at pos24, moves to pos14.
5. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup: player1 at pos14, moves to pos13.
6. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup: player1 at pos13, moves to pos12. (This satisfies constraint 1)

Now, let's push stone1 from pos23 to a path that will get it to pos25 (to satisfy constraint 2). First, we need to get player1 to a position where they can push stone1.

7. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown: player1 at pos12, moves to pos13.
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirright: player1 at pos13, pushes stone1 from pos23 to pos33. After the action, player1 is at pos23 (satisfying constraint 8) and stone1 is at pos33 (satisfying constraint 5).

We need to ensure if player1 is at pos23, then either player1 is at pos55 or pos44 is not clear at a later state (constraint 9). Let's ensure pos44 is not clear at a later state.

9. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown: player1 at pos23, moves to pos24.
10. move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown: player1 at pos24, moves to pos25.
11. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright: player1 at pos25, moves to pos35.
12. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup: player1 at pos35, moves to pos34.
13. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos32 dirup: player1 at pos34, pushes stone1 from pos33 to pos32. After the action, player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos32.
