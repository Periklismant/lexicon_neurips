Let me break down this problem:

1. We have a 2D grid with an agent (player1) and a stone (stone1). Certain positions are goal positions, and others are not.
2. The objective is to move all stones (in this case, just stone1) to a goal position.
3. The only goal position is pos41.
4. The player starts at pos15 and the stone is at pos44.
5. We have three types of actions: "move", "pushtogoal", and "pushtonongoal".

Now let's think through the constraints:
1. "Location pos35 is clear" must hold in every state.
2. "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'Location pos55 is not clear', 'stone1 is at location pos24'" must hold in at least one state.
3. "player1 is not at location pos35" must hold in every state.
4. "player1 is at location pos25" must hold in at least one state.
5. If "player1 is at location pos25" holds, there must be an earlier state where "Location pos45 is not clear" is true.
6. "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'Location pos55 is not clear', 'player1 is at location pos21'" must hold in at least one state.
7. "player1 is not at location pos43" must hold in every state.
8. "stone1 is not at location pos42" must hold in every state.
9. "Location pos25 is not clear" must hold in at least one state.
10. If "Location pos25 is not clear" holds, there must be an earlier state where "player1 is at location pos32" is true.
11. "player1 is at location pos53" must hold in at least one state.
12. "Location pos42 is not clear" must hold in at least one state.
13. If "Location pos42 is not clear" holds in state s, then "player1 is at location pos53" must hold at s or at some state after s.

Let's think through a plan to solve this problem:

The goal is to move stone1 from pos44 to pos41 (the only goal location). To do this, we need to push the stone. The player needs to be able to push from a position.

Let's visualize the grid:
```
1,1  1,2  1,3  1,4  1,5
2,1  2,2  2,3  2,4  2,5
3,1  3,2  3,3  3,4  3,5
4,1 [G]   4,2  4,3  4,4  4,5
5,1  5,2  5,3  5,4  5,5
```

The player starts at pos15 (1,5), and the stone is at pos44 (4,4). The goal is at pos41 (4,1).

Constraint 2 requires the stone to be at pos24 or pos55 to be not clear. Constraint 6 requires the player to be at pos21 or pos55 to be not clear.

Given the constraints, it seems the player has to move to pos53 at some point and also to pos32 before reaching pos25.

Let's think about the sequence to push the stone to the goal. The stone needs to move from pos44 to pos41, which means it has to move left three times (44 -> 43 -> 42 -> 41).

For the player to push the stone from pos44 to pos43, the player needs to be at pos45 and push to the left. But before that, the player has to get to pos45.

Let's start planning:

1. Player1 is at pos15. We need to move to get to pos45 to start pushing the stone.
2. Path from pos15 to pos45: pos15 -> pos14 -> pos24 -> pos25 -> pos35 -> pos45.

But wait, there's a constraint that "Location pos35 is clear" must hold in every state. So we need to make sure to not go through pos35. Let me think of an alternative path.

Path from pos15 to pos45: pos15 -> pos14 -> pos13 -> pos23 -> pos33 -> pos34 -> pos44 -> pos54 -> pos55 -> pos45.

Wait, that's not a valid path because pos44 is occupied by the stone. Let's rethink.

Path from pos15 to pos45: pos15 -> pos25 -> pos24 -> pos23 -> pos33 -> pos34 -> pos45.

Ok, but there's still the constraint that if the player is at pos25, then location pos45 should have been unclear earlier. So, we need to make sure pos45 is unclear at some point before the player reaches pos25.

Let's revisit the constraints and see if there's a different way to approach this. Since there's a constraint that "player1 is at location pos53" at some point, let's think about a path that involves pos53.

Actually, I realize that there are many constraints and I'm not sure I can find a valid plan manually. Let me think more systematically.

1. The objective is to push stone1 from pos44 to the goal at pos41.
2. Let's think about the path the stone has to take: pos44 -> pos43 -> pos42 -> pos41.
3. For the stone to move from pos44 to pos43, the player has to be at pos45 and push to the left. But there's a constraint that before the player is at pos25, pos45 should be unclear. This can only happen if there's an object at pos45, which can only be the player or the stone. For the stone to be at pos45, it needs to be pushed there, which requires the player to be behind, but the stone starts at pos44, not pos45.

Actually, I think I'm overthinking this. The constraint says "If expression 'player1 is at location pos25' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'Location pos45 is not clear'". This doesn't mean pos45 has to be not clear at an earlier state; it means that if the player goes to pos25 at some point in the plan, then at some earlier point in the plan, pos45 should have been not clear.

So, if we ensure that the player visits pos45 before going to pos25, then the constraint would be satisfied because the player being at pos45 means pos45 is not clear.

Let's sketch a plan:

1. Start with player at pos15 and stone at pos44.
2. Move player from pos15 -> pos14 -> pos13 -> pos23 -> pos33 -> pos34 -> pos24 -> pos14 -> pos15 -> pos25 -> pos35 -> pos45.
3. Now, player is behind the stone and can push it: pos45 (player) -> pos44 (stone).
4. Push the stone from pos44 to pos43: the player moves to pos44 and the stone to pos43.
5. Push the stone from pos43 to pos42: the player moves to pos43 and the stone to pos42.
6. Push the stone from pos42 to pos41: the player moves to pos42 and the stone to pos41 (goal).

But wait, the constraint "stone1 is not at location pos42" must hold in every state. So, the stone can't be at pos42 at any point. That complicates the path from pos44 to pos41.

Let's reconsider. If the stone can't go through pos42 to reach pos41, it has to take a different path. It could go down from pos44 to pos54, then left to pos53, then to pos52, then to pos51, then up to pos41.

But that's quite long. Let's check if there's a more direct way. If the stone can't be at pos42, it might be possible to push it to pos43, then maneuver the player to get above the stone and push it down to pos53, then to pos43, then to pos41.

Actually, I'm not sure I can come up with a valid plan that satisfies all constraints manually. Let me switch to a more systematic approach.

First, let's understand the current state and goal:
- Player starts at pos15.
- Stone starts at pos44.
- The goal is to get the stone to a goal location (which is pos41).

Let me step through a possible plan:

1. The player needs to get to a position from which they can push the stone towards the goal.
2. Considering the constraint that the stone can't be at pos42, the player might push the stone from pos44 to other positions, then to pos41.

Let's try to find a specific path for the stone and the player to satisfy all constraints:

1. Start with player at pos15 and stone at pos44.
2. The player can move to pos45 and push the stone from pos44 to pos43.
3. The player (now at pos44) can't push the stone to pos42 because of the constraint "stone1 is not at location pos42" must hold in every state.
4. So, the player might push the stone from pos43 to pos53, then from pos53 to pos52, then from pos52 to pos51, and finally from pos51 to pos41.

Let's trace this path in detail:

1. Player is at pos15, stone is at pos44.
2. The player moves to pos45 through a valid path (I'll determine the specific steps).
3. From pos45, the player pushes the stone from pos44 to pos43 (to the left).
4. The player is now at pos44. To push the stone from pos43 to pos53 (downwards), the player needs to move to pos33.
5. The player can then push the stone from pos43 to pos53.
6. The player is now at pos43. To push the stone from pos53 to pos52 (to the left), the player needs to move to pos54.
7. The player pushes the stone from pos53 to pos52.
8. The player is now at pos53. To push the stone from pos52 to pos51 (to the left), the player needs to move to pos42, then to pos41, then to pos51, and then to pos52 (going to pos53 might violate a constraint).
9. The player pushes the stone from pos52 to pos51.
10. The player is now at pos52. To push the stone from pos51 to pos41 (upwards), the player needs to move to pos61, which doesn't exist. This approach doesn't work.

Actually, I realize the grid is 5x5 (from pos11 to pos55), not 6x6. Let's rethink.

Let's try pushing the stone from pos44 to pos43, then to pos53, then to pos52, then to pos42, then to pos41. But wait, the constraint says the stone can't be at pos42. So this approach also doesn't work.

I'm beginning to think the stone has to go a more direct route, like pos44 -> pos43 -> pos33 -> pos32 -> pos31 -> pos41. Let's test this:

1. Player is at pos15, stone is at pos44.
2. The player moves to pos45 (through a valid path).
3. From pos45, the player pushes the stone from pos44 to pos43 (to the left). (Player is now at pos44, stone at pos43)
4. To push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (upwards), the player needs to move to pos53, then push.
5. But, player can't push stone from pos43 to pos33 from pos53. The player would need to be at pos43 and the stone at pos33 for a push to happen. But that's not a valid action in this scenario.

I realize I've been thinking about this incorrectly. The action "pushtogoal" or "pushtonongoal" involves the player pushing a stone from one location to another, not the player following the stone.

So, for example, to push the stone from pos44 to pos43, the player needs to be at pos44 and the stone also at pos44, and the player pushes the stone to pos43. But in the initial state, the player is at pos15 and the stone is at pos44, so the player can't push the stone without first moving to a position from which they can push.

Let me reconsider how pushing works:

The action "pushtogoal" or "pushtonongoal" has a precondition: "You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is a goal location (or not, for pushtonongoal)."

So, if the player is at, say, pos45, and the stone is at pos44, and the player wants to push the stone to pos43, then:
- The player is at l_p = pos45.
- The stone is at l_from = pos44.
- The destination is l_to = pos43.
- The direction is d = dirleft.

And we need to check:
1. Player is at pos45. ✓
2. Stone is at pos44. ✓
3. Location pos43 is clear. ✓
4. You can get from pos45 to pos44 following dirleft. ✓
5. You can get from pos44 to pos43 following dirleft. ✓
6. Location pos43 is a goal location (for pushtogoal) or not (for pushtonongoal). In this case, it's not, so we'd use pushtonongoal. ✓

So, in this case, the action would be "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirleft", and after this action, the player would be at pos44 and the stone at pos43.

Now, let's see if I can come up with a valid plan to move the stone from pos44 to pos41 while satisfying all constraints. Given the constraints, the stone can't be at pos42 at any point, so it can't take the direct path pos44 -> pos43 -> pos42 -> pos41. 

Let's try pushing the stone from pos44 to pos43, then from pos43 to pos33, then from pos33 to pos32, then from pos32 to pos31, and finally from pos31 to pos41.

I still think I'm not interpreting the push action correctly. Let's look again.

The description of the "pushtogoal" action says:

"After performing this action, (i) agent p is no longer at location l_p, (ii) stone s is no longer at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is no longer clear, (iv) agent p is at location l_from, (v) stone s is at location l_to, (vi) location l_p is clear, and (vii) stone s is at a goal state (or at a non-goal state for pushtonongoal)."

So, after pushing, the player moves to the stone's position, and the stone moves to the destination.

Now let's reconsider our plan: the player starts at pos15 and the stone is at pos44.

To push the stone from pos44 to pos43, the player needs to be adjacent to pos44 in the direction from which they'll push. So, the player would need to be at pos45 to push the stone left.

Actually, the description of the push action says:

"You can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d."

This suggests that to push the stone from pos44 to pos43, the player should be at a location from which they can get to pos44 by following directiond d = dirleft. So, they would be at pos54, not pos45, to push the stone to the left.

But the "push action" is not saying the player has to be at the stone's position to push it. The player has to be at location l_p, where the stone is at l_from, and after the player pushes the stone, the player will be at l_from and the stone will be at l_to.

So, to recap: the player is at l_p, the stone at l_from, and after the push, the player is at l_from and the stone at l_to.

OK let me unpack this step by step.

To push the stone from pos44 to pos43 (to the left), the player needs to be at l_p which is in the direction from which they're pushing. So, if I'm pushing to the left, the player would be at pos54 (to the right of the stone, so they can push it left).

But no, that doesn't seem right. If I'm at pos54, I can't push a stone from pos44 to pos43. 

Ok ok, let's try to interpret the action description again. It says "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d." This means that from the player's position, following direction d, you would get to the stone. Then, from the stone's position, following the same direction d, you'd get to the destination.

So, for a stone to move from pos44 to pos43 (to the left), the player should be at pos45 (to the right of the stone). Following direction dirleft from pos45, you'd get to pos44 (where the stone is). And following the same direction dirleft from pos44, you'd get to pos43 (the destination).

Ok, now I think I understand how pushing works. Let's sketch a plan:

1. Player starts at pos15, stone at pos44.
2. Player needs to move to pos45 to push the stone to the left.
3. After pushing, the player will be at pos44 and the stone at pos43.
4. To push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (upwards), the player should be at pos53, since from pos53, going up (dirup), you'd get to pos43, and from pos43 going up, you'd get to pos33.
5. After pushing, the player is at pos43 and the stone at pos33.
6. To push the stone from pos33 to pos32 (to the left), the player should be at pos34, since from pos34, going left (dirleft), you'd get to pos33, and from pos33 going left, you'd get to pos32.
7. After pushing, the player is at pos33 and the stone at pos32.
8. To push the stone from pos32 to pos31 (to the left), the player should be at pos33, since from pos33, going left (dirleft), you'd get to pos32, and from pos32 going left, you'd get to pos31.
9. After pushing, the player is at pos32 and the stone at pos31.
10. To push the stone from pos31 to pos41 (to the right), the player should be at pos21, since from pos21, going right (dirright), you'd get to pos31, and from pos31 going right, you'd get to pos41.
11. After pushing, the player is at pos31 and the stone at pos41 (goal).

Let's sanity check this plan against the constraints:

1. "Location pos35 is clear" must hold in every state. ✓ (Our plan doesn't involve pos35)
2. "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'Location pos55 is not clear', 'stone1 is at location pos24'" must hold in at least one state. ✗ (Our plan doesn't involve the stone at pos24 and we don't explicitly move the player to pos55. This constraint is not satisfied!)
3. "player1 is not at location pos35" must hold in every state. ✓ (Our plan doesn't involve pos35)
4. "player1 is at location pos25" must hold in at least one state. ✗ (Our plan doesn't involve the player at pos25. This constraint is not satisfied!)
5. If "player1 is at location pos25" holds, there must be an earlier state where "Location pos45 is not clear" is true. ✓ (This is a conditional constraint, and since the player is never at pos25 in our plan, it's trivially satisfied)
6. "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'Location pos55 is not clear', 'player1 is at location pos21'" must hold in at least one state. ✓ (The player is at pos21 at step 10)
7. "player1 is not at location pos43" must hold in every state. ✗ (In our plan, the player is at pos43 after pushing the stone from pos43 to pos33. This constraint is not satisfied!)
8. "stone1 is not at location pos42" must hold in every state. ✓ (Our plan doesn't involve the stone at pos42)
9. "Location pos25 is not clear" must hold in at least one state. ✗ (Our plan doesn't involve pos25 being not clear. This constraint is not satisfied!)
10. If "Location pos25 is not clear" holds, there must be an earlier state where "player1 is at location pos32" is true. ✓ (This is a conditional constraint, and since pos25 is always clear in our plan, it's trivially satisfied)
11. "player1 is at location pos53" must hold in at least one state. ✓ (The player is at pos53 at step 4)
12. "Location pos42 is not clear" must hold in at least one state. ✗ (Our plan doesn't involve pos42 being not clear. This constraint is not satisfied!)
13. If "Location pos42 is not clear" holds in state s, then "player1 is at location pos53" must hold at s or at some state after s. ✓ (This is a conditional constraint, and since pos42 is always clear in our plan, it's trivially satisfied)

So, our plan doesn't satisfy constraints 2, 4, 7, 9, and 12. I need to revise it.

Let's recap the constraints that weren't satisfied and see if I can adjust the plan:

1. "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'Location pos55 is not clear', 'stone1 is at location pos24'" must hold in at least one state.
2. "player1 is at location pos25" must hold in at least one state.
3. "player1 is not at location pos43" must hold in every state.
4. "Location pos25 is not clear" must hold in at least one state.
5. "Location pos42 is not clear" must hold in at least one state.

For constraint 1, I need to ensure that either the stone is at pos24 at some point, or the player is at pos55. For constraint 2, I need to have the player at pos25 at some point. For constraint 3, I can't push the stone from pos43 to pos33 since it would place the player at pos43. For constraint 4, I need to have some object (either the player or the stone) at pos25. For constraint 5, I need to have some object at pos42.

Let's see if I can adjust the path to satisfy these:

1. If the stone goes from pos44 to pos43, and I need it to go to pos24 at some point, it would need to go up through pos33, pos23, and to pos24.
2. From pos24, it could then go to pos34, pos44, pos54, and then to pos55 to make pos55 not clear.
3. But the player would need to be at pos53 to push the stone from pos54 to pos55, which means the player was at pos54 before.
4. From pos55, the stone can be pushed to pos45, then to pos35. But there's a constraint that pos35 must always be clear.
5. Ok, so having the stone at pos24 is more feasible than having it at pos55.

I am trying to come up with a feasible plan to satisfy all the constraints. Given that the stone has to be at pos24 and pos42 needs to be not clear (which might involve the stone or the player), and the player has to visit pos53, pos25, and can't be at pos35 and pos43, I need a path that works.

Let's see if the player can push the stone from pos44 directly to pos34 (upwards), instead of going left. From pos34, the stone can be pushed to pos24, satisfying constraint 1. Then, from pos24, the stone can be pushed to other locations to eventually reach pos41. The player can go through pos25, and others can ensure the rest of the constraints.

But to push the stone from pos44 to pos34, the player needs to be at pos54, which means the player has to move from pos15 to pos54 first. Here's a potential path for the player to get from pos15 to pos54: pos15 -> pos25 -> pos35 (but this violates constraint 1) -> pos45 -> pos55 -> pos54. Actually, while we can't have the player at pos35, we can have the player pass through it.

New constraint check: Location pos35 is clear" must hold in every state.

Wait, that's ambiguous. If the location is "clear", does that mean it doesn't have an object on it, or does it mean the player can move through it? Let's assume it means no object is on it. The player being there means it's not clear.

Alright, I think I've been misinterpreting this. "Location pos35 is clear" means there's no object (player or stone) at pos35. If the player or stone were at pos35, the location would not be clear.

So, the player or stone can't be at pos35 at any point. Let's adjust the plan.

Hmm, so the stone can't go through pos35 and the player can't go to pos35. I need to reconsider the whole plan to ensure I don't violate any constraints.

Let me think about a direct path for the stone from pos44 to pos41. Since it can't go through pos42 (constraint 8), the first step could be moving it from pos44 to pos34, then to pos24, then to pos23, then to pos22, then to pos32, then to pos31, and finally to pos41. This is quite convoluted but might work. Let's check:

1. Player is at pos15, stone at pos44.
2. Player moves to pos54 (a specific path TBD).
3. Player pushes stone from pos44 to pos34 (upwards).
4. After pushing, player is at pos44, stone at pos34.
5. Player moves to pos24 (a specific path TBD).
6. Player pushes stone from pos34 to pos24 (upwards).
7. After pushing, player is at pos34, stone at pos24. (Constraint 1 satisfied)
8. Player moves to pos14 (a specific path TBD).
9. Player pushes stone from pos24 to pos14 (upwards).
10. After pushing, player is at pos24, stone at pos14.
11. From pos14, the player needs to push the stone to the left towards pos41. This would go: pos14 -> pos13 -> pos12 -> pos11 -> pos21 -> pos31 -> pos41.

But that path is too long, and I might miss other constraints. Let's refine.

Given that the stone has to be at pos24 at some point to satisfy constraint 1, one approach is to push the stone from pos44 to pos34, then to pos24. From pos24, the stone can be pushed downwards to pos25, then to pos35, but that would violate the constraint that pos35 must always be clear. So, from pos24, the stone can't go down to pos25.

What if the stone goes from pos24 to pos23, then to pos22, then to pos21, then to pos31, and finally to pos41? This would avoid pos42 and pos35.

Let's check:

1. Player is at pos15, stone at pos44.
2. Player moves to pos54 (a specific path TBD).
3. Player pushes stone from pos44 to pos34 (upwards).
4. After pushing, player is at pos44, stone at pos34.
5. Player moves to pos24 (a specific path TBD).
6. Player pushes stone from pos34 to pos24 (upwards).
7. After pushing, player is at pos34, stone at pos24. (Constraint 1 satisfied)
8. Player moves to pos13 (a specific path TBD).
9. Player pushes stone from pos24 to pos23 (to the left).
10. After pushing, player is at pos24, stone at pos23.
11. Player moves to pos12 (a specific path TBD).
12. Player pushes stone from pos23 to pos22 (to the left).
13. After pushing, player is at pos23, stone at pos22.
14. Player moves to pos11 (a specific path TBD).
15. Player pushes stone from pos22 to pos21 (to the left).
16. After pushing, player is at pos22, stone at pos21.
17. Player moves to pos11 (a specific path TBD).
18. Player pushes stone from pos21 to pos11 (upwards).
19. After pushing, player is at pos21, stone at pos11. (Constraint 6 satisfied)
20. Player moves to pos12 (a specific path TBD).
21. Player pushes stone from pos11 to pos12 (to the right).
22. After pushing, player is at pos11, stone at pos12.
23. Player moves to pos13 (a specific path TBD).
24. Player pushes stone from pos12 to pos13 (to the right).
25. After pushing, player is at pos12, stone at pos13.
26. Player moves to pos14 (a specific path TBD).
27. Player pushes stone from pos13 to pos14 (to the right).
28. After pushing, player is at pos13, stone at pos14.
29. Player moves to pos15 (a specific path TBD).
30. Player pushes stone from pos14 to pos15 (to the right).
31. After pushing, player is at pos14, stone at pos15.
32. Player moves to pos25 (a specific path TBD). (Constraint 4 satisfied)
33. Player pushes stone from pos15 to pos25 (downwards).
34. After pushing, player is at pos15, stone at pos25. (Constraint 9 satisfied)
35. Player moves to pos26 (which doesn't exist). Hmm, this doesn't work.

Let me step back and think about this more carefully. When moving the stone from pos14 to pos15, the player would be at pos13. Then, from pos13, the player needs to get to pos14, and then to pos24, to be able to push the stone from pos15 to pos25. This seems feasible.

After pushing the stone from pos15 to pos25, the player would be at pos15 and the stone at pos25. From there, the stone can be pushed to pos35, but that would place the stone at pos35, violating the constraint that pos35 must always be clear. So, the stone can't go to pos35.

On the other hand, let's check there's a valid push from pos25 to pos26.

Wait, the grid is 5x5, not 6x5. There is no pos26 or any position with a 6 in it. So, the stone can't be pushed farther right from pos25.

Let's reconsider. The stone starts at pos44, and we want to push it to pos41. One path could be: pos44 (starting) -> pos43 -> pos33 -> pos23 -> pos13 -> pos12 -> pos11 -> pos21 -> pos31 -> pos41 (end).

However, we have constraints to satisfy.
Specifically, we need:
- Stone to be at pos24 at some point.
- Player to be at pos25 at some point.
- Player to be at pos21 at some point.
- Player to be at pos53 at some point.
- pos25 to not be clear at some point.
- pos42 to not be clear at some point.

Let's think about a path for the stone that visits pos24:
pos44 (starting) -> pos34 -> pos24 -> pos14 -> pos13 -> pos12 -> pos11 -> pos21 -> pos31 -> pos41 (end).

This allows the stone to be at pos24, and we can check if this path allows for the other constraints to be satisfied.

Let's say the player moves from pos15 to pos14, then to pos13, then to pos23, then to pos33, then to pos43, but that'd put the player at pos43, violating constraint 7. Hmm, let's reconsider.

Actually, I am getting too deep into details and making errors. Let's think higher level about the plan and ensure I can satisfy all constraints.

I need to get the stone from pos44 to pos41 while avoiding pos42 and pos35. One such path is pos44 -> pos34 -> pos24 -> pos23 -> pos13 -> pos12 -> pos11 -> pos21 -> pos31 -> pos41. A useful property of this path is that it puts the stone at pos24, satisfying constraint 1, and potentially allows the player to be at pos21, satisfying constraint 6.

Moreover, in the process of moving the stone from pos24 to pos23, the player will be at pos25, satisfying constraint 4. And if I ensure that the player visits pos32 before being at pos25 and visits pos53 and puts something at pos42 at some point, I might satisfy all constraints.

I'll try to sketch a high-level plan and see if it works.

Alright, given the constraints and the objective, let me try to think of a solution:

1. The objective is to get the stone to a goal location (pos41).
2. Constraints include not having the stone at pos42, not having pos35 unclear, and several specific player locations.

I need a plan where:
1. The stone reaches the goal (pos41).
2. The stone is at pos24 at some point.
3. The player is at pos25, pos53, pos21, and pos32 at specific times.
4. pos25 and pos42 are not clear at specific points.

Let me trace a high-level path and see if it works:

1. Start: Player at pos15, stone at pos44.
2. Player needs to move in a way to push the stone from pos44 to pos34. This requires the player to be at pos54. To get to pos54, the player can move: pos15 -> pos25 (satisfying constraint 4) -> pos24 -> pos34 -> pos44 -> pos54. But to satisfy constraint 10, the player needs to have been at pos32 before being at pos25. So, the player might move: pos15 -> pos25 (satisfying constraint 4) -> pos24 -> pos34 -> pos44 -> pos54. But this doesn't involve the player being at pos32 before pos25.

Actually, I don't think the player can be at pos32 before being at pos25 if the player starts at pos15. That means the conditional constraint "If 'Location pos25 is not clear' holds, there must be an earlier state where 'player1 is at location pos32'" can't be satisfied. But I think the constraint might be talking about the location being not clear in the sense of having some object (the stone, not the player) on it. In that case, the constraint might still be satisfiable.

Let me rethink the constraints and see if there's a working plan.

I think I need to move the stone to a position where it blocks pos25 or pos42, and the player has to have been at pos32 or pos53 respectively before.

Let me sketch an outline again, taking these refined interpretations into account.

1. Start: Player at pos15, stone at pos44.
2. Player needs to move in a way to push the stone from pos44 to pos34. This requires the player to be at pos54. To get to pos54, the player can move: pos15 -> pos14 -> pos13 -> pos23 -> pos33 -> pos32 (satisfying being at pos32 before the stone is at pos25) -> pos31 -> pos41 -> pos51 -> pos52 -> pos53 (satisfying constraint 11) -> pos54.
3. Player pushes stone from pos44 to pos34.
4. After pushing, player is at pos44, stone at pos34.
5. Player moves to pos45, then to pos35 (violating constraint "Location pos35 is clear").

I keep running into this issue.

Let's backtrack once again.

Let me think about a different path. 

What if the player pushes the stone from pos44 to pos43, then to pos42 (but there's a constraint that the stone can't be at pos42). Hmm ... actually I do interpret the onstaint 'stone1 is not at location 42' to mean that the stone can't be at this position at any point in the plan--but how would we get from 44 to 41 without going through 42 or 43? Let me think ...

Oh wait, we can go pos44 -> pos43 -> pos53 -> pos52 -> pos51 -> pos41!

Let's try this path:

1. Start: Player at pos15, stone at pos44.
2. Player needs to move in a way to push the stone from pos44 to pos43. This requires the player to be at pos45. 
3. Player moves from pos15 to pos45 (a specific path TBD).
4. Player pushes stone from pos44 to pos43.
5. After pushing, player is at pos44, stone at pos43.
6. Player needs to move to pos33 to push the stone from pos43 to pos53. But to get to pos33, the player would have to pass through pos43, violating constraint 7 "player1 is not at location pos43".

Wait again, that's not quite right. To push the stone from pos43 to pos53 (downward), the player would need to be above the stone, so at pos33. But to get to pos33 from pos44, the player doesn't have to go through pos43. The player can go pos44 -> pos34 -> pos33. 

Yet then I'd face a similar problem: I need to get the player from pos33 to pos53 to push the stone from pos53 to pos52. But that would require the player to be at pos54. The player would have to go from pos33 to pos34 to pos44 to pos54. Actually that's fine.

Let's see if this path works:

1. Start: Player at pos15, stone at pos44.
2. Player moves to pos45 (a specific path TBD, but let's say it's pos15 -> pos14 -> pos13 -> pos23 -> pos33 -> pos43, but that'd violate constraint 7. Hmm...).

You know what, I think I need to be more systematic and careful with my plan.

I'll trace a specific path from the beginning to see if we can satisfy all constraints.

Since constraint 1 requires either the stone to be at pos24 or pos55 to not be clear, and constraint 6 requires either the player to be at pos21 or pos55 to not be clear, it's interesting to think about placing the stone at pos55 at some point.

Let me try a higher-level approach, without specifying the player's exact path for moving around:

1. Start: Player at pos15, stone at pos44.
2. Player moves to pos34 (this is feasible, and the player goes through pos25, satisfying constraint 4).
3. Player pushes stone from pos44 to pos54 (downward).
4. Player moves to pos53 (satisfying constraint 11).
5. Player pushes stone from pos54 to pos55 (to the right). This makes pos55 not clear, satisfying constraints 1 and 6.
6. Player moves to pos45.
7. Player pushes stone from pos55 to pos54 (to the left).
8. Player moves to pos44 (going through pos34, pos24, which might allow for constraint 1 to be satisfied again if the stone goes there later).
9. Player pushes stone from pos54 to pos44 (upward).
10. Player moves to pos34.
11. Player pushes stone from pos44 to pos34 (upward).
12. Player moves to pos24.
13. Player pushes stone from pos34 to pos24 (upward). This places the stone at pos24, further satisfying constraint 1.
14. Player moves to pos14.
15. Player pushes stone from pos24 to pos14 (upward).
16. Player moves to pos13.
17. Player pushes stone from pos14 to pos13 (to the left).
18. Player moves to pos12.
19. Player pushes stone from pos13 to pos12 (to the left).
20. Player moves to pos11.
21. Player pushes stone from pos12 to pos11 (to the left).
22. Player moves to pos21.
23. Player pushes stone from pos11 to pos21 (downward). This places the player at pos11, and to push the stone to pos21, the player would be at pos21 after the push. This contradicts the requirement.

Wait, that's incorrect. To push the stone from pos11 to pos21 (downward), the player needs to be at pos11 and the stone also at pos11. After pushing, the player would be at pos11 and the stone at pos21.

I need to correct my trace:

21. Player is at pos11, stone at pos12.
22. Player pushes stone from pos12 to pos11 (to the left).
23. After pushing, player is at pos12, stone at pos11.
24. Player moves to pos21 (satisfying constraint 6).
25. Player pushes stone from pos11 to pos21 (downward).
26. After pushing, player is at pos11, stone at pos21.
27. Player moves to pos22, then to pos32 (satisfying constraint 10, having been at pos32 before the stone goes to pos25).
28. Player moves to pos31.
29. Player pushes stone from pos21 to pos31 (to the right).
30. After pushing, player is at pos21, stone at pos31.
31. Player moves to pos41 (a specific path TBD).
32. Player pushes stone from pos31 to pos41 (to the right).
33. After pushing, player is at pos31, stone at pos41. Goal achieved!

Now, let's check if this plan satisfies all constraints:

1. "Location pos35 is clear" must hold in every state. ✓ (Our plan doesn't involve pos35)
2. "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'Location pos55 is not clear', 'stone1 is at location pos24'" must hold in at least one state. ✓ (Both conditions are satisfied in different steps: the stone is at pos24 on step 13, and pos55 is not clear between steps 5 and 6)
3. "player1 is not at location pos35" must hold in every state. ✓ (Our plan doesn't involve the player at pos35)
4. "player1 is at location pos25" must hold in at least one state. ✓ (The player is at pos25 at step 2, when moving from pos15 to pos34)
5. If "player1 is at location pos25" holds, there must be an earlier state where "Location pos45 is not clear" is true. ✗ (At step 2, the player is at pos25, but at no earlier steps pos45 is unclear. This constraint is not satisfied!)
6. "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'Location pos55 is not clear', 'player1 is at location pos21'" must hold in at least one state. ✓ (Both conditions are satisfied in different steps)
7. "player1 is not at location pos43" must hold in every state. ? (I need to check if the player ever visits pos43. It depends on the specific paths we choose.)
8. "stone1 is not at location pos42" must hold in every state. ✓ (Our plan doesn't involve the stone at pos42)
9. "Location pos25 is not clear" must hold in at least one state. ✗ (Our plan doesn't involve pos25 being unclear. This constraint is not satisfied!)
10. If "Location pos25 is not clear" holds, there must be an earlier state where "player1 is at location pos32" is true. ✓ (This is a conditional constraint, and since pos25 is always clear in our plan, it's trivially satisfied)
11. "player1 is at location pos53" must hold in at least one state. ✓ (The player is at pos53 at step 4)
12. "Location pos42 is not clear" must hold in at least one state. ✗ (Our plan doesn't involve pos42 being unclear. This constraint is not satisfied!)
13. If "Location pos42 is not clear" holds in state s, then "player1 is at location pos53" must hold at s or at some state after s. ✓ (This is a conditional constraint, and since pos42 is always clear in our plan, it's trivially satisfied)

We still don't satisfy constraints 5, 9, and 12. Let's refine the plan to satisfy them.

I need to ensure that at the time the player is at pos25, pos45 has already been unclear. One way to achieve this is to route the stone through pos45 before the player visits pos25. Similarly, I need to make pos25 unclear at some point, which might involve the stone going there. Finally, I need to make pos42 unclear at some point (which, according to constraint 13, should be before or at the time the player is at pos53).

Constraint 9 requires us to have pos25 be unclear at some point, but that can happen if the stone is at pos25 or the player is at pos25. The player is at pos25 in step 2 (so the location is not clear at that point), but this would mean both the player and the stone are on the same position, which seems incorrect. So pos25 is unclear when there's an object there, most likely the stone.

So for constraint 9, I might need to have the stone at pos25 at some point. For constraint 12, I need to have some object (stone or player) at pos42 at some point, making it unclear. Since the constraint requires the player to be at pos53 at that time or later, I should have the stone or player at pos42 before or at the time the player is at pos53.

Let's refine the plan again, with a focus on satisfying ALL constraints.

Step 1: Player moves from pos15 to pos45.
This allows the player to push the stone from pos44 to pos45, making pos45 not clear. Then the player can move to pos25, ensuring that constraint 5 is satisfied.

Step 2: Player pushes stone from pos44 to pos45.

Step 3: Player moves to pos25.

Constraint 5 is now satisfied. But I need to make pos25 unclear after the player has already moved on. I can achieve this by bringing the stone to pos25. Additionally, I need to go through pos32 before to satisfy constraint 10.

Step 4: Player moves to pos32.

Step 5: Player moves to pos24.

Step 6: Player pushes stone from pos45 to pos25.

Constraint 10 and constraint 9 are now satisfied: pos25 is unclear, and the player has been at pos32 before this happens.

Step 7: Player moves to pos15.

Step 8: Player pushes stone from pos25 to pos24.

Constraint 1 is now satisfied: the stone is at pos24.

Now, for constraint 12, I need to make pos42 unclear at some point, and then the player should be at pos53 at that time or later. One way to do this is to route the stone through pos42, but then I'd violate constraint 8. So, I'd have to have the player at pos42 at some point. That can be part of the path the player takes.

Actually, let me step back again.

All of this means that I need to have the player located at pos42 at some point. Then, the player has to be at pos53 at that time or later. The idea is to have the player at pos42, move it away (which would make pos42 clear), and then have the player go to pos53. For consistency with other constraints, the player should have been at pos32 before the stone is placed at pos25.

Let's refine the plan once more:

Step 1: Player moves from pos15 to pos32 (a specific path TBD, but satisfying constraint 10, being at pos32).

Step 2: Player moves to pos42, making it unclear (satisfying constraint 12).

Step 3: Player moves to pos53 (satisfying constraint 11 and part of constraint 13).

Constraint 13 is now satisfied: pos42 was unclear at one point, and the player was at pos53 at that time or later.

Hmm, actually that meant I'd never make pos45 unclear, so I'd still violate constraint 5 if the player is at pos25 at any time.

Actually, in a different interpretation, the constraint "If expression 'player1 is at location pos25' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'Location pos45 is not clear'" might be talking about the fact that both the player and the stone can't occupy the same space at the same time. So, the player at pos25 would make pos25 unclear. Constraint 5 might be asking for pos45 to be unclear (either with the player or the stone) before the player is at pos25.

Let's refactor the plan and see if it's possible to satisfy all constraints.

Let me also try to carefully trace the path of the stone to the goal, which is the ultimate objective. The goal is pos41, and the stone starts at pos44. The stone can't go through pos42, which means it can't take the direct path pos44 -> pos43 -> pos42 -> pos41. It needs to go around. One possibility is to go pos44 -> pos34 -> pos24 -> pos14 -> pos13 -> pos12 -> pos11 -> pos21 -> pos31 -> pos41. Another is pos44 -> pos43 -> pos53 -> pos52 -> pos51 -> pos41. The latter is shorter, so I'll go with that one.

Now let's make sure I can satisfy all the constraints, starting with the player at pos15 and the stone at pos44.

Step 1: Player moves from pos15 to pos45 (a specific path TBD, but it involves pos45 becoming unclear when the player is there).

Alright, I think I have a plan that should be simple to understand and would satisfy all the constraints. I won't detail the player's exact movements (which can be determined based on the action descriptions) but will focus on the stone's journey to the goal and the key states to satisfy the constraints.

1. Start: Player at pos15, stone at pos44.
2. Player moves from pos15 to pos32 (visiting pos25 on the way).
3. Player moves from pos32 to pos42, making pos42 unclear (satisfying constraint 12).
4. Player moves from pos42 to pos32, then to pos22, then to pos12, then to pos13, then to pos23, then to pos33, then to pos43 (making pos43 unclear, which violates constraint 7, "player1 is not at location pos43" — we'll need to bypass pos43).

OK, I'm still having trouble satisfying all constraints. Let me step back once more.

I am going to start from the beginning again, trace the sequence with a specific path for the player and the stone, and see if I can satisfy all constraints.

1. Start: Player at pos15, stone at pos44.
2. Player moves from pos15 to pos25 (pos25 becomes unclear, but we don't satisfy constraint 5 yet since pos45 has not been unclear).
3. Player moves from pos25 to pos24, to pos34, to pos44 (making it unclear), to pos45 (making it unclear, which will satisfy constraint 5 for the future, when player is at pos25). 
4. Player moves from pos45 to pos35, but that'd make pos35 unclear, violating constraint 1. We can't go that way.

This is more challenging than I thought.

Let's try a somewhat different approach. Since the player starts at pos15 and the stone at pos44, we can first try to satisfy constraint 1 by moving the stone to pos24. The player can push the stone from pos44 to pos34, then from pos34 to pos24. Then, we can satisfy other constraints as we work toward the goal.

1. Start: Player at pos15, stone at pos44.
2. Player moves from pos15 to pos14, to pos13, to pos23, to pos33, to pos34, to pos35, but that'd make pos35 unclear, violating constraint 1. We have to find a different path to get to pos54 to push the stone up.

Hmm, I'm struggling to find a path that satisfies all the constraints, especially with the player not being able to be at pos43 and pos35 making it hard to move around the grid.

Actually, I think I might've been misinterpreting the push action. Let's re-examine the action description:

"pushtogoal/pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d" means agent p, situated at location l_p, pushes stone s from location l_from to location l_to, following direction d.

The preconditions are:
1. player p is at location l_p
2. stone s is at location l_from
3. location l_to is clear
4. you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d
5. you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d
6. location l_to is (or is not) a goal location

The effects are:
1. agent p is no longer at location l_p
2. stone s is no longer at location l_from
3. location l_to is no longer clear
4. agent p is at location l_from
5. stone s is at location l_to
6. location l_p is clear
7. stone s is (or is not) at a goal state

Actually, I think my interpretation of a push was generally correct. But let me think about the constraints and the specific challenges once more.

Given the constraints, I need a path for the stone that:
1. Passes through pos24 or makes pos55 unclear.
2. Avoids pos42 and pos35.
3. Ends at pos41.

For the player to push the stone, the player must be adjacent to the stone in the direction from which they're pushing. The player pushes the stone from their location.

I've been trying to get the player to pos54 to push the stone up from pos44, but I keep running into issues due to the constraints. Let me try to push the stone left from pos44 to pos43, then down to pos53, and then navigate to pos41.
