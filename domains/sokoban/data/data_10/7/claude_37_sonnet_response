Let me start by breaking down the problem:

1. We have a 2D grid with the agent (player1) and a stone (stone1).
2. The goal is to move stone1 to a goal location. From the initial state, we know that pos21 is a goal location.
3. We can move the agent, push the stone to a goal, or push the stone to a non-goal location.

There are also several constraints we have to follow. I'll analyze them and then solve the problem.

Let's first understand the initial state:
- player1 is at location pos51
- stone1 is at location pos43
- pos21 is a goal location

Now let's analyze the constraints:

1. "player1 is at location pos34" must be true at some point.
2. After "player1 is at location pos34" holds, we must ensure at least one of these: "stone1 is at location pos45" or "player1 is at location pos43".
3. "player1 is at location pos44" or "Location pos45 is not clear" must be true at some point.
4. "player1 is at location pos24" must be true at some point.
5. After "player1 is at location pos24" holds, we must ensure at least one of these: "stone1 is at location pos24" or "player1 is at location pos21".
6. "player1 is at location pos43" must be true at some point.
7. After "player1 is at location pos43" holds, we must ensure at least one of these: "stone1 is at location pos11" or "Location pos11 is not clear".
8. "Location pos24 is not clear" can only be true for one continuous sequence of states.
9. "Location pos53 is clear" must be true in every state.
10. "stone1 is at location pos43" must be true at some point.
11. After "stone1 is at location pos43" holds, we must ensure at least one of these: "Location pos12 is not clear" or "stone1 is at location pos55".
12. "Location pos33 is not clear" can only be true for one continuous sequence of states.
13. "Location pos24 is not clear" must be true at some point.
14. Before "Location pos24 is not clear" can be true, "Location pos12 is not clear" must be true at some point.
15. "stone1 is at location pos33" must be true at some point.
16. After "stone1 is at location pos33" holds, "Location pos14 is not clear" must be true at some point.

I'll build a step-by-step plan to achieve the goal while adhering to these constraints. Let me trace a path from the initial state to the goal.

Initial state:
- player1 is at location pos51
- stone1 is at location pos43

Looking at the constraints, we need to satisfy several "must hold at least once" conditions. Let's try to order them in a logical sequence:

1. "stone1 is at location pos43" (constraint 10) - This is already true in the initial state.
2. "player1 is at location pos43" (constraint 6) - We can move player1 to pos43.
3. "player1 is at location pos34" (constraint 1) - We can move player1 from pos43 to pos34.
4. "player1 is at location pos24" (constraint 4) - We can move player1 from pos34 to pos24.
5. "Location pos24 is not clear" (constraint 13) - This will be true when stone1 is pushed to pos24.
6. "stone1 is at location pos33" (constraint 15) - We need to push stone1 from pos43 to pos33 at some point.
7. "Location pos14 is not clear" (constraint 16) - After stone1 is at pos33, we need to ensure this.

Also, from constraint 14, before "Location pos24 is not clear" can be true, "Location pos12 is not clear" must be true at some point. So we need to make sure pos12 is not clear before moving the stone to pos24.

Let's plan a sequence of moves:

1. First, we need to move player1 from pos51 to pos43 to be adjacent to stone1. The path would be: pos51 -> pos41 -> pos42 -> pos43
2. Now, from constraint 7, after player1 is at pos43, we need to ensure "stone1 is at location pos11" or "Location pos11 is not clear". 
3. Also, from constraint 11, after stone1 is at pos43, we need to ensure "Location pos12 is not clear" or "stone1 is at location pos55". 

We need to decide on a path for the stone that satisfies all these constraints. Let's try to move the stone from pos43 to pos33 (constraint 15), then to other positions, and eventually to the goal pos21.

Let me plan a more detailed path:

Initial state:
- player1 is at location pos51
- stone1 is at location pos43

1. Move player1 from pos51 to pos43: pos51 -> pos41 -> pos42 -> pos43 (action: "move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft", etc.)

2. Now, we need to push stone1 to pos33 (constraint 15). From player1 at pos43 and stone1 at pos43, we'd first need to move player1 to pos53, and then push stone1 from pos43 to pos33. But from constraint 9, "Location pos53 is clear" must be true in every state, so we need to be careful about this.

I realize that as the problem states "stone1 is at pos43" and "player1 is at location pos51" in the initial state, there seems to be a problem as they can't both occupy the same position. Let me re-read the problem to make sure I understand correctly.

I double-checked, and it's clear from the initial state that both "stone1 is at location pos43" and "player1 is at location pos51" are true. This is valid because they are at different positions. Let's continue with the planning.

Initial state:
- player1 is at location pos51
- stone1 is at location pos43

1. Move player1 from pos51 to pos42 (to be adjacent to stone1 from the left): pos51 -> pos41 -> pos42 (actions: "move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft", "move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown")

2. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos33 (constraint 15): Push from pos42 to move stone1 from pos43 to pos33. This would also satisfy constraint 12 once.

3. Now, we need to move player1 to pos24 (constraint 4). However, before "Location pos24 is not clear" can be true, "Location pos12 is not clear" must be true at some point (constraint 14).

Let's continue planning:

3. Move player1 to pos34 (constraint 1): pos43 -> pos33 -> pos34 (actions: "move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft", "move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown")

At this point, constraint 2 says after "player1 is at location pos34" holds, we must ensure "stone1 is at location pos45" or "player1 is at location pos43". We can plan to move player1 back to pos43 to satisfy this.

4. Move player1 to pos24 (constraint 4): pos34 -> pos24 (action: "move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft")

At this point, constraint 5 says after "player1 is at location pos24" holds, we must ensure "stone1 is at location pos24" or "player1 is at location pos21". We'll plan to move player1 to pos21 to satisfy this.

5. Move player1 to pos21: pos24 -> pos23 -> pos22 -> pos21 (actions: "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup", "move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup", "move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup")

Now, we need to ensure "Location pos12 is not clear" (from constraint 14) and "Location pos14 is not clear" (from constraint 16). We'll need to push stone1 to these positions.

6. Move player1 to be adjacent to stone1 at pos33. The path could be: pos21 -> pos22 -> pos23 -> pos24 -> pos34 -> pos33 -> pos32 (actions: "move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown", etc.)

7. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos23: Push from pos32 to move stone1 from pos33 to pos23.

8. Move player1 to pos22 and push stone1 from pos23 to pos13: pos23 -> pos22 -> push (actions: "move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup", push)

9. Move player1 to pos12 and push stone1 from pos13 to pos12: pos13 -> pos12 -> push (actions: "move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup", push). This will make "Location pos12 is not clear" true (required by constraint 14).

10. Move player1 to pos11 and push stone1 from pos12 to pos11: pos12 -> pos11 -> push (actions: "move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup", push). This will make "Location pos11 is not clear" (which satisfies the end of constraint 7).

11. Move player1 to be at pos12 and push stone1 from pos11 to pos21 (the goal): pos11 -> pos12 -> push (actions: "move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown", push).

However, I realize there's a problem with the above plan. When stone1 is at pos33, we can't also have player1 be at pos43 (required by constraint 7) because player1 would have pushed the stone from pos43 to pos33, so player1 would now be at pos33 (not pos43).

Let me rethink this:

Initial state:
- player1 is at location pos51
- stone1 is at location pos43

1. Move player1 from pos51 to be adjacent to stone1 at pos43. We'll go to pos42: pos51 -> pos41 -> pos42 (actions: "move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft", "move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown")

2. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos33 (constraint 15): Push from pos42 to move stone1 from pos43 to pos33.

At this point, player1 is at pos43 (which satisfies constraint 6). From constraint 7, after player1 is at pos43, we must ensure "stone1 is at location pos11" or "Location pos11 is not clear". We can plan to push stone1 to pos11 later.

3. Move player1 to pos34 (constraint 1): pos43 -> pos44 -> pos34 (actions: "move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown", "move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft")

From constraint 2, after "player1 is at location pos34" holds, we must ensure "stone1 is at location pos45" or "player1 is at location pos43". We already have player1 being at pos43 in step 2, so constraint 2 is satisfied.

4. Move player1 to pos24 (constraint 4): pos34 -> pos24 (action: "move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft")

From constraint 5, after "player1 is at location pos24" holds, we must ensure "stone1 is at location pos24" or "player1 is at location pos21". We'll plan to move player1 to pos21.

5. Move player1 to pos21: pos24 -> pos23 -> pos22 -> pos21 (actions: "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup", "move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup", "move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup")

Now, from constraint 14, before "Location pos24 is not clear" can be true, "Location pos12 is not clear" must be true at some point. So we need to push stone1 to pos12 before it goes to pos24.

Let's continue planning:

6. Move player1 to be adjacent to stone1 at pos33. The path could be: pos21 -> pos31 -> pos32 (actions: "move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright", "move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown")

7. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos23: Push from pos32 to move stone1 from pos33 to pos23.

8. Move player1 to pos13 and push stone1 from pos23 to pos13: pos23 -> pos22 -> pos12 -> pos13 (actions: "move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup", "move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft", "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown")

9. Push stone1 from pos13 to pos12: Push from pos13 to move stone1 from pos13 to pos12. This will make "Location pos12 is not clear" true (required by constraint 14).

10. Move player1 to pos13 and push stone1 from pos12 to pos11: pos12 -> pos13 -> push (actions: "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown", push). This will make "Location pos11 is not clear" (which satisfies the end of constraint 7).

11. Now, we need to push stone1 to pos24 (to make "Location pos24 is not clear" true, required by constraint 13). But first, we need to move stone1 back to pos21 (the goal).

12. Move player1 to pos12 and push stone1 from pos11 to pos21 (the goal): pos11 -> pos12 -> push (actions: "move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown", push to goal).

Now, from constraint 16, after "stone1 is at location pos33" holds, "Location pos14 is not clear" must be true at some point. We've already moved stone1 from pos33 to other positions and eventually to the goal. To ensure "Location pos14 is not clear", we would need to have stone1 pass through pos14 or park it there temporarily.

Given the complexity and the amount of constraints, let me rethink my approach. I'll try to draw the grid to visualize the problem:

```
    1  2  3  4  5
1  |  |  |  |  |  |
2  |G |  |  |  |  |
3  |  |  |S |  |  |
4  |  |  |  |  |  |
5  |P |  |  |  |  |
```

Where P is player1, S is stone1, and G is the goal location.

The objective is to move S to G while respecting all the given constraints.

Let me revise my plan with this visual aid:

Initial state:
- player1 (P) is at location pos51
- stone1 (S) is at location pos43
- pos21 (G) is a goal location

1. Move player1 from pos51 to be adjacent to stone1 at pos43. We'll go to pos44: pos51 -> pos41 -> pos42 -> pos43 -> pos44 (actions: "move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft", "move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown", "move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown", "move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown").

Wait, I notice a problem. In the previous steps I mentioned pushing the stone from pos43 to pos33, but in the initial state, player1 is not adjacent to the stone.

Let me rethink this and be more explicit:

Initial state:
- player1 is at location pos51
- stone1 is at location pos43

1. Move player1 from pos51 to be adjacent to stone1 at pos43. We'll go to pos53: pos51 -> pos52 -> pos53 (actions: "move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown", "move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown")

2. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos33: Push from pos53 to move stone1 from pos43 to pos33.

At this point, player1 is at pos43 (which satisfies constraint 6). From constraint 7, after player1 is at pos43, we must ensure "stone1 is at location pos11" or "Location pos11 is not clear". We can plan to push stone1 to pos11 later.

3. Move player1 to pos34 (constraint 1): pos43 -> pos34 (action: "move player1 pos43 pos34 dirdown")

From constraint 2, after "player1 is at location pos34" holds, we must ensure "stone1 is at location pos45" or "player1 is at location pos43". We'll move the player back to pos43 later.

4. Move player1 to pos24 (constraint 4): pos34 -> pos24 (action: "move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft")

From constraint A, after "player1 is at location pos24" holds, we must ensure "stone1 is at location pos24" or "player1 is at location pos21". We'll plan to move player1 to pos21.

5. Move player1 to pos21: pos24 -> pos23 -> pos22 -> pos21 (actions: "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup", "move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup", "move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup")

The problem is that we need to introduce a way to satisfy all the constraints. We need to ensure "Location pos14 is not clear" at some point, but we need to do this while ensuring "Location pos24 is not clear" can only be true for one continuous sequence of states, and "Location pos53 is clear" must be true in every state.

Let me approach this systematically:

Initial state:
- player1 is at location pos51
- stone1 is at location pos43
- pos21 is a goal location

I'll visualize the grid again:

```
    1  2  3  4  5
1  |  |  |  |  |  |
2  |G |  |  |  |  |
3  |  |  |  |  |  |
4  |  |  |S |  |  |
5  |P |  |  |  |  |
```

1. Move player1 from pos51 to be adjacent to stone1 at pos43. We'll go to pos42 (to push from the left): pos51 -> pos41 -> pos42 (actions: "move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft", "move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown")

2. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos44: Push from pos42 to move stone1 from pos43 to pos44.
```
    1  2  3  4  5
1  |  |  |  |  |  |
2  |G |  |  |  |  |
3  |  |  |  |  |  |
4  |  |P |  |S |  |
5  |  |  |  |  |  |
```

3. Move player1 from pos43 to pos34 (constraint 1): pos43 -> pos33 -> pos34 (actions: "move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft", "move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown")
```
    1  2  3  4  5
1  |  |  |  |  |  |
2  |G |  |  |  |  |
3  |  |  |  |P |  |
4  |  |  |  |S |  |
5  |  |  |  |  |  |
```

Now, from constraint 2, after "player1 is at location pos34" holds, we must ensure "stone1 is at location pos45" or "player1 is at location pos43". Let's push stone1 to pos45.

4. Push stone1 from pos44 to pos45: Push from pos34 to move stone1 from pos44 to pos45.
```
    1  2  3  4  5
1  |  |  |  |  |  |
2  |G |  |  |  |  |
3  |  |  |  |  |  |
4  |  |  |  |P |  |
5  |  |  |  |  |S |
```

This action also satisfies constraint 3, which requires "player1 is at location pos44" or "Location pos45 is not clear" at some point.

5. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43 (to satisfy constraint 6): pos44 -> pos43 (action: "move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup")
```
    1  2  3  4  5
1  |  |  |  |  |  |
2  |G |  |  |  |  |
3  |  |  |  |  |  |
4  |  |  |P |  |  |
5  |  |  |  |  |S |
```

Now, from constraint 7, after "player1 is at location pos43" holds, we must ensure "stone1 is at location pos11" or "Location pos11 is not clear". We'll plan to push stone1 to pos11 later.

6. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (to push stone1 in the next step): pos43 -> pos33 (action: "move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft")
```
    1  2  3  4  5
1  |  |  |  |  |  |
2  |G |  |  |  |  |
3  |  |  |P |  |  |
4  |  |  |  |  |  |
5  |  |  |  |  |S |
```

7. Move player1 from pos33 to pos44 (to be adjacent to stone1): pos33 -> pos34 -> pos35 -> pos45 -> pos44 (actions: "move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown", "move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown", "move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright", "move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup")
```
    1  2  3  4  5
1  |  |  |  |  |  |
2  |G |  |  |  |  |
3  |  |  |  |  |  |
4  |  |  |  |P |  |
5  |  |  |  |  |S |
```

Wait, I realize this configuration won't work because player1 would need to be at pos45 to push the stone, but stone1 is already there. Let me rethink this.

Initial state:
- player1 is at location pos51
- stone1 is at location pos43
- pos21 is a goal location

I'll visualize the grid again:

```
    1  2  3  4  5
1  |  |  |  |  |  |
2  |G |  |  |  |  |
3  |  |  |  |  |  |
4  |  |  |S |  |  |
5  |P |  |  |  |  |
```

1. Move player1 from pos51 to be adjacent to stone1 at pos43. We'll go to pos42 (to push from the left): pos51 -> pos41 -> pos42 (actions: "move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft", "move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown")

2. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos33 (constraint 15): Push from pos42 to move stone1 from pos43 to pos33. This puts "player1 is at location pos43", satisfying constraint 6.
```
    1  2  3  4  5
1  |  |  |  |  |  |
2  |G |  |  |  |  |
3  |  |  |S |  |  |
4  |  |  |P |  |  |
5  |  |  |  |  |  |
```

3. Move player1 from pos43 to pos34 (constraint 1): pos43 -> pos34 (action: "move player1 pos43 pos34 dirdown")
```
    1  2  3  4  5
1  |  |  |  |  |  |
2  |G |  |  |  |  |
3  |  |  |S |  |  |
4  |  |  |  |P |  |
5  |  |  |  |  |  |
```

From constraint 2, after "player1 is at location pos34" holds, we must ensure "stone1 is at location pos45" or "player1 is at location pos43". We already had "player1 is at location pos43" in step 2, so constraint 2 is satisfied.

4. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24 (constraint 4): pos34 -> pos24 (action: "move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft")
```
    1  2  3  4  5
1  |  |  |  |  |  |
2  |G |  |  |  |  |
3  |  |  |S |  |  |
4  |  |P |  |  |  |
5  |  |  |  |  |  |
```

From constraint 5, after "player1 is at location pos24" holds, we must ensure "stone1 is at location pos24" or "player1 is at location pos21". We'll plan to move player1 to pos21.

5. Move player1 from pos24 to pos21: pos24 -> pos23 -> pos22 -> pos21 (actions: "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup", "move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup", "move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup")
```
    1  2  3  4  5
1  |  |  |  |  |  |
2  |P |  |  |  |  |
3  |  |  |S |  |  |
4  |  |  |  |  |  |
5  |  |  |  |  |  |
```

Now, from constraint 14, before "Location pos24 is not clear" can be true, "Location pos12 is not clear" must be true at some point. So we need to push stone1 to pos12 before it goes to pos24.

6. Move player1 from pos21 to be adjacent to stone1 at pos33. We'll go to pos32 (to push from the left): pos21 -> pos31 -> pos32 (actions: "move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright", "move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown")
```
    1  2  3  4  5
1  |  |  |  |  |  |
2  |G |  |  |  |  |
3  |  |P |S |  |  |
4  |  |  |  |  |  |
5  |  |  |  |  |  |
```

7. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos34: Push from pos32 to move stone1 from pos33 to pos34.
```
    1  2  3  4  5
1  |  |  |  |  |  |
2  |G |  |  |  |  |
3  |  |  |P |S |  |
4  |  |  |  |  |  |
5  |  |  |  |  |  |
```

8. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos24 (satisfying constraint 13): Push from pos33 to move stone1 from pos34 to pos24.
```
    1  2  3  4  5
1  |  |  |  |  |  |
2  |G |  |  |  |  |
3  |  |  |  |  |  |
4  |  |S |P |  |  |
5  |  |  |  |  |  |
```

But wait, I realize we have a problem here. From constraint 14, "Location pos12 is not clear" must be true before "Location pos24 is not clear" can be true. But we haven't pushed the stone to pos12 yet, so we can't push it to pos24.

Let me rethink our approach:

Initial state:
- player1 is at location pos51
- stone1 is at location pos43
- pos21 is a goal location

I think we need to first push stone1 to pos12, then to pos24, and finally to the goal.

1. Move player1 from pos51 to be adjacent to stone1 at pos43. We'll go to pos42 (to push from the left): pos51 -> pos41 -> pos42 (actions: "move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft", "move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown")

2. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos33 (constraint 15): Push from pos42 to move stone1 from pos43 to pos33. This puts "player1 is at location pos43", satisfying constraint 6.
```
    1  2  3  4  5
1  |  |  |  |  |  |
2  |G |  |  |  |  |
3  |  |  |S |  |  |
4  |  |  |P |  |  |
5  |  |  |  |  |  |
```

From constraint 7, after "player1 is at location pos43" holds, we must ensure "stone1 is at location pos11" or "Location pos11 is not clear". We'll plan to push stone1 to pos11 later.

3. Move player1 from pos43 to pos32 (to push stone1 in the next step): pos43 -> pos33 -> pos32 (actions: "move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft", "move player1 pos33 pos32 dirleft")
```
    1  2  3  4  5
1  |  |  |  |  |  |
2  |G |  |  |  |  |
3  |  |P |S |  |  |
4  |  |  |  |  |  |
5  |  |  |  |  |  |
```

```

Wait, there's an error in this. If stone1 is at pos13 and player1 is at pos22, then player1 would need to move to pos12 (not pos13) to be adjacent to stone1. Let me correct this.

6. Push stone1 from pos13 to pos12: Move player1 to pos12 and then push stone1 from pos13 to pos12 (actions: "move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft", push).
```
    1  2  3  4  5

3  |  |  |  |  |  |
4  |  |  |  |  |  |
5  |  |  |  |  |  |
```

But actually, if stone1 is at pos13 and player1 moves to pos12, player1 wouldn't be adjacent to stone1 (they'd be diagonally apart). I think there's another error in my visualization. Let me correct it:

5. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos13: Move player1 to pos12 and then push stone1 from pos23 to pos13 (actions: "move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup", "move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft", push).
```
    1  2  3  4  5
1  |  |  |S |  |  |
2  |G |P |  |  |  |
3  |  |  |  |  |  |
4  |  |  |  |  |  |
5  |  |  |  |  |  |
```

But this still doesn't work. If player1 is at pos12 and stone1 is at pos23, they're not adjacent.

Let me restart and get this right:

Initial state:
- player1 is at location pos51
- stone1 is at location pos43
- pos21 is a goal location

I'll visualize the grid again:

```
    1  2  3  4  5
1  |  |  |  |  |  |
2  |G |  |  |  |  |
3  |  |  |  |  |  |
4  |  |  |S |  |  |
5  |P |  |  |  |  |
```

1. Move player1 from pos51 to be adjacent to stone1 at pos43. We'll go to pos42 (to push from the left): pos51 -> pos41 -> pos42 (actions: "move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft", "move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown")

2. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos33 (constraint 15): Push from pos42 to move stone1 from pos43 to pos33. This puts "player1 is at location pos43", satisfying constraint 6.
```
    1  2  3  4  5
1  |  |  |  |  |  |
2  |G |  |  |  |  |
3  |  |  |S |  |  |
4  |  |  |P |  |  |
5  |  |  |  |  |  |
```

From constraint 7, after "player1 is at location pos43" holds, we must ensure "stone1 is at location pos11" or "Location pos11 is not clear". We'll plan to push stone1 to pos11 later.

3. Move player1 from pos43 to pos32 (to push stone1 in the next step): pos43 -> pos33 -> pos32 (actions: "move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft", "move player1 pos33 pos32 dirleft")
```
    1  2  3  4  5
1  |  |  |  |  |  |
2  |G |  |P |  |  |
3  |  |  |S |  |  |
4  |  |  |  |  |  |
5  |  |  |  |  |  |
```

Ah, there's an error. Let me correct my visualization:

```
    1  2  3  4  5

4  |  |  |  |  |  |
5  |  |  |  |  |  |
```

5. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos13: Push from pos22 to move stone1 from pos23 to pos13. To do this, player1 needs to move to pos22 first (actions: "move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft", push).

```
    1  2  3  4  5
1  |  |  |S |  |  |

3  |  |  |  |  |  |
4  |  |  |  |  |  |
5  |  |  |  |  |  |
```

6. Push stone1 from pos13 to pos12: Push from pos13 to move stone1 from pos13 to pos12. To do this, player1 needs to move to pos13 first (actions: "move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft", push). This makes "Location pos12 is not clear" true (required by constraint 14).
```
    1  2  3  4  5

3  |  |  |  |  |  |
4  |  |  |  |  |  |
5  |  |  |  |  |  |
```

This still doesn't work. If player1 is at pos22 and stone1 is at pos13, they're not adjacent. Let me correct this again:

5. Move player1 from pos32 to pos22, then to pos13 (to be adjacent to stone1 at pos23): (actions: "move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft", "move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft", "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown")
```
    1  2  3  4  5

7. Push stone1 from pos13 to pos12: Move player1 to pos13 and then push stone1 from pos13 to pos12 (actions: "move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft", push).

5  |  |  |  |  |  |
```

8. Push stone1 from pos12 to pos11: Push from pos12 to move stone1 from pos12 to pos11. This makes "Location pos11 is not clear" true (satisfying constraint 7).
```
    1  2  3  4  5

3  |  |  |  |  |  |
4  |  |  |  |  |  |
5  |  |  |  |  |  |
```

9. Move player1 to pos34 (constraint 1): pos11 -> pos21 -> pos31 -> pos32 -> pos33 -> pos34 (actions: "move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright", "move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright", "move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown", "move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown", "move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown")

3  |  |  |  |P |  |
4  |  |  |  |  |  |
5  |  |  |  |  |  |
```

10. Move player1 to pos24 (constraint 4): pos34 -> pos24 (action: "move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft")
```
    1  2  3  4  5
1  |S |  |  |  |  |
2  |G |  |  |  |  |
3  |  |  |  |  |  |
4  |  |P |  |  |  |
5  |  |  |  |  |  |
```

From constraint 5, after "player1 is at location pos24" holds, we must ensure "stone1 is at location pos24" or "player1 is at location pos21". We'll move player1 to pos21.

11. Move player1 to pos21: pos24 -> pos23 -> pos22 -> pos21 (actions: "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup", "move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup", "move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup")
```
    1  2  3  4  5
1  |S |  |  |  |  |
2  |P |  |  |  |  |
3  |  |  |  |  |  |
4  |  |  |  |  |  |
5  |  |  |  |  |  |
```

12. Push stone1 from pos11 to pos21 (the goal): Push from pos21 to move stone1 from pos11 to pos21.
```
    1  2  3  4  5
1  |  |  |  |  |  |
2  |S |P |  |  |  |
3  |  |  |  |  |  |
4  |  |  |  |  |  |
5  |  |  |  |  |  |
```

This should satisfy the goal, but we still have a problem: we haven't satisfied constraint 16. After "stone1 is at location pos33" holds, "Location pos14 is not clear" must be true at some point.

Oh, actually, i think that the coordinates notation is like "pos<row><col>", where row and column are both indices. So pos11 is the top-left, pos15 is the top-right, pos51 is the bottom-left, and pos55 is the bottom-right. Let's re-visualize the grid with this understanding:

```
    1  2  3  4  5
  ----------------
1 |  |  |  |  |  |
2 |G |  |  |  |  |
3 |  |  |  |  |  |
4 |  |  |S |  |  |
5 |P |  |  |  |  |
```

Where P is player1 at pos51, S is stone1 at pos43, and G is the goal location at pos21.

From this new understanding, I'll trace the plan again:

1. Move player1 from pos51 to be adjacent to stone1 at pos43. We'll go to pos53 (to push from the right): pos51 -> pos52 -> pos53 (actions: "move player1 pos51 pos52 dirright", "move player1 pos52 pos53 dirright")
```
    1  2  3  4  5
  ----------------
1 |  |  |  |  |  |
2 |G |  |  |  |  |
3 |  |  |  |  |  |
4 |  |  |S |  |  |
5 |  |  |P |  |  |
```

Actually, if directions are dirleft, dirright, dirup, dirdown, I think they correspond to going from one position to another by moving left, right, up, or down. For example, if we're at pos51 and want to go to pos52, that's dirright, and if we want to go to pos41, that's dirup.

If that's the case, I'll trace the plan again with this understanding:

1. Move player1 from pos51 to be adjacent to stone1 at pos43. We'll go to pos53 (to push from the right): pos51 -> pos52 -> pos53 (actions: "move player1 pos51 pos52 dirright", "move player1 pos52 pos53 dirright")
```
    1  2  3  4  5
  ----------------
1 |  |  |  |  |  |
2 |G |  |  |  |  |
3 |  |  |  |  |  |
4 |  |  |S |  |  |
5 |  |  |P |  |  |
```

2. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos33 (constraint 15): Push from pos53 to move stone1 from pos43 to pos33. This puts stone1 at pos33 (satisfying constraint 15).
```
    1  2  3  4  5
  ----------------
1 |  |  |  |  |  |
2 |G |  |  |  |  |
3 |  |  |S |  |  |
4 |  |  |P |  |  |
5 |  |  |  |  |  |
```

Now player1 is at pos43 (satisfying constraint 6). From constraint 7, after "player1 is at location pos43" holds, we must ensure "stone1 is at location pos11" or "Location pos11 is not clear". We'll move player1 to push stone1 to pos11 later.

3. Move player1 to pos34 (constraint 1): pos43 -> pos34 (action: "move player1 pos43 pos34 dirright")
```
    1  2  3  4  5
  ----------------
1 |  |  |  |  |  |
2 |G |  |  |  |  |
3 |  |  |S |P |  |
4 |  |  |  |  |  |
5 |  |  |  |  |  |
```

From constraint 2, after "player1 is at location pos34" holds, we must ensure "stone1 is at location pos45" or "player1 is at location pos43". We had "player1 is at location pos43" in step 2, so constraint 2 is satisfied.

4. Move player1 to pos24 (constraint 4): pos34 -> pos24 (action: "move player1 pos34 pos24 dirup")
```
    1  2  3  4  5
  ----------------
1 |  |  |  |  |  |
2 |G |  |  |P |  |
3 |  |  |S |  |  |
4 |  |  |  |  |  |
5 |  |  |  |  |  |
```

From constraint 5, after "player1 is at location pos24" holds, we must ensure "stone1 is at location pos24" or "player1 is at location pos21". We'll move player1 to pos21.

5. Move player1 to pos21: pos24 -> pos23 -> pos22 -> pos21 (actions: "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirleft", "move player1 pos23 pos22 dirleft", "move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft")
```
    1  2  3  4  5
  ----------------
1 |  |  |  |  |  |
2 |P |  |  |  |  |
3 |  |  |S |  |  |
4 |  |  |  |  |  |
5 |  |  |  |  |  |
```

From constraint 14, before "Location pos24 is not clear" can be true, "Location pos12 is not clear" must be true at some point. So we need to push stone1 to pos12 before it goes to pos24.

6. Move player1 to be adjacent to stone1 at pos33. We'll go to pos23 (to push from the top): pos21 -> pos22 -> pos23 (actions: "move player1 pos21 pos22 dirright", "move player1 pos22 pos23 dirright")
```
    1  2  3  4  5
  ----------------
1 |  |  |  |  |  |
2 |G |  |P |  |  |
3 |  |  |S |  |  |
4 |  |  |  |  |  |
5 |  |  |  |  |  |
```

7. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos23: Push from pos23 to move stone1 from pos33 to pos23.
```
    1  2  3  4  5
  ----------------
1 |  |  |  |  |  |
2 |G |  |S |  |  |
3 |  |  |P |  |  |
4 |  |  |  |  |  |
5 |  |  |  |  |  |
```

8. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos13: Push from pos22 to move stone1 from pos23 to pos13 (actions: "move player1 pos33 pos22 dirleft", push).
```
    1  2  3  4  5
  ----------------
1 |  |  |S |  |  |
2 |G |  |P |  |  |
3 |  |  |  |  |  |
4 |  |  |  |  |  |
5 |  |  |  |  |  |
```

Wait I'm making an obvious mistake here. If player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos23, player1 can't push the stone from this position. We'd need player1 to be at pos22 to push stone1 from pos23 to pos13.

Let me restart the steps to be more careful:

1. Move player1 from pos51 to be adjacent to stone1 at pos43. We'll go to pos53 (to push from the right): pos51 -> pos52 -> pos53 (actions: "move player1 pos51 pos52 dirright", "move player1 pos52 pos53 dirright")
```
    1  2  3  4  5
  ----------------
1 |  |  |  |  |  |
2 |G |  |  |  |  |
3 |  |  |  |  |  |
4 |  |  |S |  |  |
5 |  |  |P |  |  |
```

2. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos33 (constraint 15): Push from pos53 to move stone1 from pos43 to pos33.
```
    1  2  3  4  5
  ----------------
1 |  |  |  |  |  |
2 |G |  |  |  |  |
3 |  |  |S |  |  |
4 |  |  |P |  |  |
5 |  |  |  |  |  |
```

Now player1 is at pos43 (satisfying constraint 6). From constraint 7, after "player1 is at location pos43" holds, we must ensure "stone1 is at location pos11" or "Location pos11 is not clear". We'll move player1 to push stone1 to pos11 later.

3. Move player1 to pos34 (constraint 1): pos43 -> pos44 -> pos34 (actions: "move player1 pos43 pos44 dirright", "move player1 pos44 pos34 dirup")
```
    1  2  3  4  5

```

5. Move player1 to pos21 (to satisfy constraint 5): pos24 -> pos23 -> pos22 -> pos21 (actions: "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirleft", "move player1 pos23 pos22 dirleft", "move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft")

```

6. Move player1 to be adjacent to stone1 at pos33. We'll go to pos32 (to push from the left): pos21 -> pos31 -> pos32 (actions: "move player1 pos21 pos31 dirdown", "move player1 pos31 pos32 dirright")
```

```

9. Move player1 from pos34 to push stone1 from pos35 to pos25 (to get stone1 upwards towards pos14, which we'll need to make not clear later): actions: "move player1 pos34 pos35 dirright", push.
```

11. Move player1 from pos25 to push stone1 from pos15 to pos14: action: "move player1 pos25 pos15 dirup", push. This makes "Location pos14 is not clear" true (satisfying constraint 16).

Move player1 from pos11 to pos24 (using a path that avoids disturbing stone1): pos11 -> pos21 -> pos31 -> pos32 -> pos33 -> pos34 -> pos24 (actions: "move player1 pos11 pos21 dirdown", "move player1 pos21 pos31 dirdown", "move player1 pos31 pos32 dirright", "move player1 pos32 pos33 dirright", "move player1 pos33 pos34 dirright", "move player1 pos34 pos24 dirup")
```

16. Move player1 to stone1 from pos24 to push stone1 from pos11 to pos21 (the goal): pos24 -> pos23 -> pos22 -> pos21 -> pos11 -> push (actions: "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirleft", "move player1 pos23 pos22 dirleft", "move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft", "move player1 pos21 pos11 dirup", push to goal)
```
    1  2  3  4  5

2 |S |  |  |  |  |
3 |  |  |  |  |  |
4 |  |  |  |  |  |
5 |  |  |  |  |  |
```

This should satisfy the goal and all the constraints. Now, let me formulate the actual plan more precisely using the provided action format:

Noticing that I have to use pushtogoal or pushtonongoal, not just "push":

```
move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft
move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos33 dirleft
move player1 pos43 pos44 dirright
move player1 pos44 pos34 dirup
move player1 pos34 pos24 dirup
move player1 pos24 pos23 dirleft
move player1 pos23 pos22 dirleft
move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft
move player1 pos21 pos31 dirdown
move player1 pos31 pos32 dirright
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirright
move player1 pos34 pos35 dirright
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos35 pos25 dirup
move player1 pos35 pos25 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos25 pos15 dirup
move player1 pos25 pos15 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos15 pos15 pos14 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos14 pos13 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos13 pos12 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos12 pos11 dirleft
move player1 pos12 pos22 dirdown
move player1 pos22 pos23 dirright
move player1 pos23 pos24 dirright
move player1 pos24 pos23 dirleft
move player1 pos23 pos22 dirleft
move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft
move player1 pos21 pos11 dirup
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos11 pos21 dirdown
```

Wait, I'm making a mistake in the pushtogoal and pushtonongoal action format. Let me go back to the problem statement.

For "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d", the preconditions include (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) we can get from l_p to l_from following direction d, (v) we can get from l_from to l_to following direction d, and (vi) l_to is a goal location.

For "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d", it's the same, but (vi) l_to is not a goal location.

Let me correct the plan:

```
move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft
move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos33 dirleft
move player1 pos43 pos44 dirright
move player1 pos44 pos34 dirup
move player1 pos34 pos24 dirup
move player1 pos24 pos23 dirleft
move player1 pos23 pos22 dirleft
move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft
move player1 pos21 pos31 dirdown
move player1 pos31 pos32 dirright
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirright
move player1 pos34 pos35 dirright
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos35 pos25 dirup
move player1 pos35 pos25 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos25 pos15 dirup
move player1 pos25 pos15 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos15 pos15 pos14 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos14 pos13 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos13 pos12 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos12 pos11 dirleft
move player1 pos12 pos22 dirdown
move player1 pos22 pos23 dirright
move player1 pos23 pos24 dirright
move player1 pos24 pos23 dirleft
move player1 pos23 pos22 dirleft
move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft
move player1 pos21 pos11 dirup
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos11 pos21 dirdown
```

Wait, I'm still making a mistake. For "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d", we need to get from l_p to l_from following direction d, and also get from l_from to l_to following direction d. This means the agent, the stone, and the destination all need to be in a line.

Let me reanalzye the given directionality information.

From the original puzzle:
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

This means:
- dirright moves horizontally from a position with a lower second digit to a position with a higher second digit (e.g., from pos11 to pos21).
- dirdown moves vertically from a position with a lower first digit to a position with a higher first digit (e.g., from pos11 to pos12).

So dirright means moving right (increasing column), and dirdown means moving down (increasing row).

With this clarified, the coordinates in the grid should be:

```
    1  2  3  4  5
  ----------------
1 | 11| 21| 31| 41| 51|
2 | 12| 22| 32| 42| 52|
3 | 13| 23| 33| 43| 53|
4 | 14| 24| 34| 44| 54|
5 | 15| 25| 35| 45| 55|
```

Wait no, this still doesn't make sense. Let me recheck the original puzzle again:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

If dirright means moving right and dirdown means moving down, then the grid should be:

```
    1  2  3  4  5
  ----------------
1 | 11| 21| 31| 41| 51|
2 | 12| 22| 32| 42| 52|
3 | 13| 23| 33| 43| 53|
4 | 14| 24| 34| 44| 54|
5 | 15| 25| 35| 45| 55|
```

In this case:
- player1 is at location pos51 (bottom-right)
- stone1 is at location pos43 (middle-right)
- pos21 (top-middle) is a goal location

But looking at the list of directions provided:
"You may move from location pos31 to location pos21 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos31 to location pos41 following direction dirright"

So dirleft means decreasing the first digit, and dirright means increasing the first digit.

Hmm, now it seems like the first digit is the column and the second digit is the row. So the grid should be:

```
    1  2  3  4  5
  ----------------
1 | 11| 12| 13| 14| 15|
2 | 21| 22| 23| 24| 25|
3 | 31| 32| 33| 34| 35|
4 | 41| 42| 43| 44| 45|
5 | 51| 52| 53| 54| 55|
```

Nevermind, given that I can go from pos11 to pos21 using dirright, it's clear that the first digit is the column and the second digit is the row. So the grid should be:

```
    1  2  3  4  5
  ----------------
1 | 11| 21| 31| 41| 51|
2 | 12| 22| 32| 42| 52|
3 | 13| 23| 33| 43| 53|
4 | 14| 24| 34| 44| 54|
5 | 15| 25| 35| 45| 55|
```

Ok, let me just go ahead with this understanding and try to solve the problem.

Initial state:
- player1 is at location pos51 (rightmost, top row)
- stone1 is at location pos43 (middle column, 4th row)
- pos21 is a goal location (second column, top row)

I'll follow this and plan the actions accordingly.

Ok so my understanding is as follows:
- pos<col><row> so pos51 is the rightmost, top row and pos21 is the second column, top row.
- dirright means increasing the first digit (moving right), dirleft means decreasing the first digit (moving left), dirup means decreasing the second digit (moving up), and dirdown means increasing the second digit (moving down).

Let me finalize the plan in the correct format:

```
move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft
move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos33 dirleft
move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
move player1 pos24 pos23 dirdown
move player1 pos23 pos22 dirdown
move player1 pos22 pos21 dirdown
move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirright
move player1 pos34 pos35 dirright
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos35 pos25 dirup
move player1 pos35 pos25 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos25 pos15 dirup
move player1 pos25 pos15 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos15 pos15 pos14 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos14 pos13 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos13 pos12 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos12 pos11 dirleft
move player1 pos12 pos22 dirdown
move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos11 pos21 dirright
```

There are some more typos in the plan, let me check it statement by statement and fix it.

"move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft" - correct
"move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown" - correct
"pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos33 dirleft" - correct
"move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown" - correct
"move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft" - correct
"move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft" - correct
"move player1 pos24 pos23 dirdown" - incorrect, should be: "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirleft"
"move player1 pos23 pos22 dirdown" - incorrect, should be: "move player1 pos23 pos22 dirleft"
"move player1 pos22 pos21 dirdown" - incorrect, should be: "move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft"
"move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright" - correct
"move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown" - correct
"pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright" - correct
"pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirright" - I don't think this is right. 

Actually, let me just restart with a new plan, because I'm getting confused with all the fixing.

Let's reconsider from the beginning:

1. Player1 starts at pos51, stone1 is at pos43, and the goal is at pos21.
2. The constraints tell us certain positions player1 and stone1 need to be in.

Let's follow an approach where we push stone1 to pos21 in a way that satisfies all the constraints:

1. player1 moves from pos51 to pos42 to be adjacent to stone1 at pos43.
2. player1 pushes stone1 from pos43 to pos33.
3. player1 moves to pos34 (constraint 1).
4. player1 moves to pos24 (constraint 4).
5. player1 moves to pos21 (constraint 5).
6. player1 moves to push stone1 to pos13.
7. player1 pushes stone1 to pos12 (constraint 14).
8. player1 pushes stone1 to pos11 (constraint 7).
9. player1 moves to pos21.
10. player1 pushes stone1 from pos11 to pos21 (goal).

Now, here's the detailed plan in the correct format:

```
move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft
move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos33 dirleft
move player1 pos43 pos34 dirdown
move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
move player1 pos24 pos23 dirleft
move player1 pos23 pos22 dirleft
move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft
move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos23 dirup
move player1 pos33 pos23 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos23 pos13 dirup
move player1 pos23 pos13 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos13 pos12 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos12 pos11 dirleft
move player1 pos12 pos22 dirdown
move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft
move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos11 pos21 dirright
```

Hmm, I realized I made a mistake. From constraint 16, after "stone1 is at location pos33" holds, "Location pos14 is not clear" must be true at some point. The current plan doesn't satisfy this.

Let me adjust the plan to incorporate this constraint:

```
move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft
move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos33 dirleft
move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos23 dirup
move player1 pos33 pos34 dirright
move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
move player1 pos24 pos23 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos23 pos13 dirup
move player1 pos23 pos13 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos13 pos14 dirdown
move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos14 pos13 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos13 pos12 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos12 pos11 dirleft
move player1 pos12 pos22 dirdown
move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft
move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos11 pos21 dirright
```

But I still don't think we're satisfying constraint 3, which requires "player1 is at location pos44" or "Location pos45 is not clear" at some point. Let me adjust the plan again:

```
move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft
move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos33 dirleft
move player1 pos43 pos44 dirright
move player1 pos44 pos45 dirright
move player1 pos45 pos44 dirleft
move player1 pos44 pos34 dirup
move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
move player1 pos24 pos23 dirleft
move player1 pos23 pos33 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos23 dirup
move player1 pos33 pos23 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos23 pos13 dirup
move player1 pos23 pos13 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos13 pos14 dirdown
move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos14 pos13 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos13 pos12 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1
