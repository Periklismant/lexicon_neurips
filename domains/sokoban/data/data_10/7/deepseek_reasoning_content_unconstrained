Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to get stone1 to a goal location, which in this case is pos21. The initial state has the agent at pos51 and stone1 at pos43. So I need to figure out a path for the agent to reach the stone and then push it to the goal.

First, looking at the available moves. The agent starts at pos51. From pos51, they can move to pos41 via dirleft or to pos52 via dirdown. But since the stone is at pos43, which is in the middle of the grid, I need to get the agent up there. Let's see the connections.

Pos51 can go to pos41 (dirleft) or pos52 (dirdown). If the agent moves to pos41, then from there, they can go to pos31 (dirleft) or pos42 (dirdown). Wait, maybe moving to pos41 is the way to go. Let's map out the path from pos51 to pos43.

Wait, stone1 is at pos43. To push it, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. So the agent needs to get to pos42, pos33, pos44, or pos53, because those are adjacent to pos43. Let's check the movement possibilities.

From pos51, moving left to pos41. Then, from pos41, down to pos42. Then from pos42, down to pos43. But wait, the agent can't move into a location with a stone unless they're pushing it. Oh right, the stone is at pos43. So the agent can't just move into pos43. So the agent needs to approach from a direction where they can push the stone towards the goal.

The goal is pos21. So the stone needs to move from pos43 to pos21. Let's see the path. But pos21 is a goal location. How to get the stone there? Let's think about the possible directions.

The agent might need to push the stone up through the grid. Let's see the allowed movement directions. For example, from pos43, the agent can push the stone to pos33 (dirleft) if they are at pos43's right (pos53), but wait, directions are a bit confusing. Wait, the movement directions are based on the direction specified. For instance, if the agent is at pos42 (which is above pos43), they can push the stone down to pos43's direction. Wait, but the stone is already at pos43. Wait, no, the agent needs to be adjacent to the stone to push it. So to push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft), the agent needs to be at pos43's right, which is pos53. Because to push left, the agent would be on the right side of the stone.

Wait, let's clarify the directions. The direction refers to the direction from the agent's current position to the stone's position, and then the direction from the stone's position to the target location. For example, to push the stone left from pos43, the agent must be to the right of the stone (pos53) and then push it left to pos33. But wait, pos43 to pos33 would be direction dirleft. So the agent would need to be at pos53, which is to the right of pos43, and then push towards dirleft.

But how does the agent get to pos53? Let's see. Starting from pos51, moving down to pos52, then down to pos53. Because pos51 → pos52 (dirdown), then pos52 → pos53 (dirdown). Once at pos53, the agent can push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft). But wait, pos53 is adjacent to pos43 (to the right). So pushing left would move the stone to pos33.

But then, pos33 is not a goal. Then the agent would need to push the stone further towards pos21. Let's see. From pos33, the next push could be to pos23 (dirleft), then to pos21? Or maybe pos23 to pos22, but pos22 is not a goal. Wait, the only goal location is pos21. So the stone needs to end up at pos21.

So the path for the stone would be pos43 → pos33 → pos23 → pos22? Wait, pos23 is adjacent to pos22. Wait, but pos21 is the goal. How to get from pos23 to pos21? Let's check the movement allowed. From pos23, can the stone be pushed left to pos13, then up to pos12? Hmm, maybe not. Let's think again.

Wait, the goal is pos21. So perhaps the stone needs to go from pos43 to pos33, then to pos23, then to pos22 (since pos23 can move down to pos24, but that's not helpful). Wait, pos23 is connected to pos22 (dirleft?), no. Let me check the movement possibilities provided.

Looking back at the movement allowed: From pos23, you can move to pos13 (dirleft), pos33 (dirright), pos22 (dirup), or pos24 (dirdown). Wait, no. Wait the "You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirleft" implies that moving left from pos23 leads to pos13. But if the agent is pushing a stone from pos23 to pos13, that's dirleft. But pos13 is not a goal. Alternatively, pushing the stone from pos23 to pos22 (dirup?), but the direction depends on the agent's position.

Alternatively, maybe after pushing the stone to pos33, then push it to pos32 (dirup?), but pos32 is not a goal. Wait, this seems complicated. Let's outline the possible path step by step.

The stone starts at pos43. The goal is pos21. So the stone needs to move left (west) and up (north) to reach pos21. Let's see the grid positions:

pos43 is in row 4, column 3.

pos21 is row 2, column 1.

So the stone needs to move left twice (from column 3 to 1) and up twice (from row 4 to 2). So possible path: pos43 → pos33 → pos23 → pos22 → pos21. Wait, pos23 to pos22 is up (dirup), but pos22 is not a goal. Hmm, but pos21 is a goal. Wait, from pos23, can the stone be pushed to pos22 (up), then from pos22 to pos21 (up)? Because pos22 is adjacent to pos21. So the path would be pos43 → pos33 → pos23 → pos22 → pos21.

Each push requires the agent to be in the correct position relative to the stone. Let's break down each step.

First step: Push stone1 from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft). The agent needs to be at pos53 (east of pos43) to push left. So the agent must move from pos51 to pos52 to pos53. Then perform pushtonongoal (since pos33 is not a goal) to move the stone to pos33.

Then, the agent is now at pos43 (after pushing). Next, push the stone from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft). The agent would need to be at pos43 (east of pos33) to push left. Wait, after the first push, the agent is at pos43. Wait, the effect of pushtonongoal is that the agent moves to l_from (pos43's previous position was the stone's location, which is pos43). Wait, no: the action is pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d. So after pushing, the agent moves from l_p (their starting position) to l_from (the stone's original position). So in the first push, if the agent is at pos53 (l_p), pushing stone1 from pos43 (l_from) to pos33 (l_to) with direction dirleft. The effect is that the agent moves to l_from (pos43), which is now clear because the stone has moved. So after the first push, the agent is at pos43.

Then, the stone is at pos33. To push it left to pos23, the agent needs to be at pos43 (east of pos33). Wait, pos33 is in row 3, column3. East would be pos34, but pos33's east is pos34? Wait, the grid's naming is posXY where X is the row and Y the column. So pos33 is row 3, column 3. Moving right (dirright) would increase the column, so pos34. Moving left (dirleft) decreases the column to pos32. Moving up (dirup) decreases the row to pos23. Moving down (dirdown) increases the row to pos43.

Wait, perhaps the directions are a bit confusing. Let me check the movement directions again. For example, "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft". So moving from pos43 to pos33 is dirleft. That suggests that dirleft from pos43 leads to pos33. So pos43's left is pos33 (column decreases by 1, same row). So direction dirleft from pos43 is to pos33. Similarly, dirright from pos33 would be pos34.

So, to push the stone from pos33 to pos23, the agent needs to be to the right of pos33 (pos34) and push left. Wait, no. Wait, if the stone is at pos33, to push it left (to pos32?), but that's not towards the goal. Wait, the goal is pos21. So perhaps I need to push the stone up instead.

Wait, pos33 to pos23 is moving up (dirup). So the agent needs to be south of pos33 (pos43) and push up. Because to push up, the agent must be south (below) the stone. So from pos43, pushing the stone at pos33 north (up) to pos23. That's possible.

So after the first push to pos33, the agent is at pos43. Then, from pos43, the agent can push the stone north to pos23. That would be a pushtonongoal since pos23 is not a goal. The action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirup. Let's check the preconditions: agent is at pos43 (yes, after the first push), stone is at pos33 (yes), pos23 is clear (initially yes, as per initial state). The direction from pos43 to pos33 is dirup? Wait, the movement from pos43 to pos33 is dirleft according to the given moves. Wait, looking back at the movement allowed:

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"

So moving from pos43 to pos33 is dirleft. So to push the stone from pos33 to pos23, the agent must be able to move from their current position (pos43) to pos33 (dirleft), then from pos33 to pos23 (dirup). Wait, but the action requires that the direction from l_p (agent's position before pushing) to l_from (stone's position) is d. So for the second push, the agent is at pos43 (l_p), stone is at pos33 (l_from). The direction from l_p (pos43) to l_from (pos33) is dirleft. Then the direction from l_from (pos33) to l_to (pos23) is dirup. So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirup. Wait, but the direction d in the action is the direction from l_p to l_from and from l_from to l_to. Wait, the action's direction parameter is the direction that connects l_p to l_from and l_from to l_to. So for the action to be valid, the movement from l_p to l_from must be possible in direction d, and from l_from to l_to also in direction d. Wait, the action's preconditions are: (iv) you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d, and (v) you can get from l_from to l_to following direction d. So the same direction must be used for both steps.

Wait, that's a key point. So when pushing, the agent moves from l_p to l_from in direction d, then the stone moves from l_from to l_to in the same direction d. So the direction must be the same for both movements. Therefore, in the second push, to move the stone from pos33 to pos23, the direction must be such that pos33 to pos23 is possible in direction d, and the agent's position l_p to pos33 is also possible in direction d.

So let's see. If the agent is at pos43 (after the first push), and wants to push the stone from pos33 to pos23, they need a direction d where moving from pos43 to pos33 is possible in d, and from pos33 to pos23 is possible in d.

Looking at the movement allowed from pos43: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft". So direction dirleft from pos43 leads to pos33. Then, from pos33, can we move in direction dirleft to pos23? No. From pos33, moving dirleft would go to pos32 (since pos33's left is column 2). But pos23 is up from pos33.

Wait, this is a problem. Because the direction d must be the same for both steps. So if the agent is at pos43 and moves dirleft to pos33 (stone's current position), then the stone must move dirleft from pos33 to pos32. But that's not towards the goal. Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to approach from a different direction.

Alternatively, the agent could move from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft), then the stone would move dirleft to pos32. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, if the agent is north of pos33, then pushing down. But the agent is currently at pos43 (south of pos33). So to push the stone north (up) to pos23, the direction would need to be dirup. But can the agent move from pos43 to pos33 in dirup? Let's check the movement allowed from pos43. The allowed movements are:

- pos43 to pos33 (dirleft)
- pos43 to pos53 (dirright)
- pos43 to pos42 (dirup)
- pos43 to pos44 (dirdown)

Wait, according to the given movement list:

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown"

So dirup from pos43 leads to pos42. So if the agent is at pos43 and wants to push the stone north (up), they would need to be at pos42 (north of pos43) to push down. Wait, this is getting a bit complicated.

Wait, perhaps after the first push, the agent is at pos43. To push the stone from pos33 to pos23 (up), the agent needs to be south of pos33 (pos43) and push up. But according to the movement directions, moving from pos43 to pos33 is dirleft, not dirup. So the direction for the push would have to be dirup, but can the agent move from pos43 to pos33 in dirup?

No, because the allowed movement from pos43 to pos33 is dirleft. So the direction d for the push action must be dirleft. Then the stone would move dirleft from pos33 to pos32. That's not helpful. So perhaps the first approach is not feasible.

Alternative approach: after moving the stone to pos33, the agent needs to reposition to push it upwards. Let's think.

After the first push, the agent is at pos43. They need to move around to get north of pos33 to push it up. How?

From pos43, the agent can move to pos42 (dirup), then to pos32 (dirup), then to pos33 (dirright?), but this might be a longer path.

Wait, pos43 → pos42 (dirup). Then pos42 can move to pos32 (dirup). Then from pos32, can they move to pos33 (dirdown)? Let's check the allowed moves:

From pos32, allowed moves are to pos22 (dirleft), pos42 (dirright), pos31 (dirup), pos33 (dirdown). Yes. So the agent can go pos43 → pos42 (dirup), pos42 → pos32 (dirup), then pos32 → pos33 (dirdown). Now the agent is at pos33. Then, they can push the stone from pos33 to pos23 (dirup). Because from pos33, moving dirup would go to pos23 (since pos33's up is row 2, same column 3: pos23). But wait, movement from pos33 to pos23: is that allowed? Looking at the movement list:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirup"

Yes. So if the agent is at pos33, they can push the stone from pos33 to pos23 with direction dirup. But the agent would need to be at pos33 to do that? Wait, no. The agent needs to be at a position adjacent to the stone. Wait, to push the stone from pos33 to pos23 (dirup), the agent must be south of pos33 (pos43) and push up, but according to the movement rules, pushing requires that the agent moves from their current location (l_p) to the stone's location (l_from) in direction d, and then the stone moves from l_from to l_to in the same direction d. So in this case, the agent would need to be at pos43 (south of pos33) and push up. But from pos43, moving up (dirup) leads to pos42, not pos33. So that's not possible. Therefore, the direction for the push must be such that both l_p to l_from and l_from to l_to are possible in direction d.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let's try to outline each step carefully.

Initial positions:

- Agent at pos51

- Stone1 at pos43

Goal: Stone1 at pos21 (which is a goal location)

First, agent needs to reach the stone. The stone is at pos43. The agent starts at pos51. So possible path: pos51 → pos41 (dirleft), then pos41 → pos42 (dirdown), then pos42 → pos43 (dirdown). But pos43 has the stone, so the agent can't move there. So the agent can move to pos42, adjacent to the stone. From pos42, they can push the stone down to pos44 (if pos44 is clear). Wait, pos44 is initially clear. But pushing to pos44 would be a non-goal location. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, push the stone up to pos42, but the agent is already there. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the agent can move from pos51 to pos52 (dirdown), then pos52 → pos53 (dirdown), then pos53 is adjacent to pos43 (right side). Then the agent can push the stone left from pos43 to pos33. Let's see:

Agent's path: pos51 → pos52 (dirdown), then pos52 → pos53 (dirdown). Now at pos53. From here, they can perform pushtonongoal to push stone1 from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft). Because:

- Agent is at pos53 (l_p), stone is at pos43 (l_from).

- Check if they can move from pos53 to pos43 following direction d. What direction connects pos53 to pos43? pos53 is row5, column3. pos43 is row4, column3. So moving up (dirup) from pos53 leads to pos43. Yes. Looking at the movement list:

"You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirup"

Yes. So direction d is dirup. Then, from pos43 (l_from), can we move dirup to pos33? Let's check movement from pos43: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft". So dirup from pos43 is to pos42. So this approach doesn't work because the direction must be the same for both steps.

Ah, here's the problem. The direction d must allow the agent to move from l_p to l_from and then the stone to move from l_from to l_to. So in this case, if the agent is at pos53 (l_p), they need to move to pos43 (l_from) via direction d, and then the stone moves from pos43 (l_from) to pos33 (l_to) via the same direction d.

Looking at the movement from pos53 to pos43: allowed direction is dirup. Then, from pos43, moving dirup would go to pos42. So that's not helpful. So pushing the stone from pos43 to pos33 requires direction dirleft. But the agent is at pos53, which is east of pos43. So moving from pos53 to pos43 would require direction dirleft? Wait, no. pos53 to pos43 is dirup (row 5 to 4, same column). So direction is dirup. Then the stone would move dirup from pos43 to pos42. That's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to approach from the west.

Alternative approach: agent moves from pos51 to pos41 (dirleft), then pos41 → pos31 (dirleft), pos31 → pos32 (dirdown), pos32 → pos33 (dirdown). Now agent is at pos33, adjacent to the stone at pos43 (south of pos33). Then, the agent can push the stone down from pos43 to pos53? No, but that's not towards the goal. Alternatively, push the stone up from pos33 to pos23. Let's see.

Agent path: pos51 → pos41 (dirleft), pos41 → pos31 (dirleft), pos31 → pos32 (dirdown), pos32 → pos33 (dirdown). Now at pos33. Stone is at pos43. To push the stone from pos43 to pos33, the agent needs to be south of pos43. Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let's try to find a valid path step by step.

Maybe a better approach is to first move the agent to pos53, which is adjacent to the stone's current position (pos43). Then push the stone west to pos33 using dirleft. Let's check:

Agent moves:

1. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
2. move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown

Now agent is at pos53. Then, perform pushtonongoal to push stone1 from pos43 to pos33. The action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirleft

Check preconditions:

- Agent is at pos53 (yes)
- Stone is at pos43 (yes)
- pos33 is clear (initially yes)
- Can move from pos53 to pos43 in dirleft? Wait, pos53 is row5, column3. pos43 is row4, column3. So direction from pos53 to pos43 is dirup, not dirleft. So this action is invalid. Because the direction must be dirleft for the agent to move from pos53 to pos43, which isn't allowed. According to the movement list, from pos53, you can move to pos43 via dirup. So the direction would have to be dirup. Then, the stone would move dirup from pos43 to pos42. But pos42 is not a goal. That's not helpful.

So this approach doesn't work. Hmm.

Alternative idea: push the stone north from pos43 to pos33. Wait, pos43's north is pos33 (row3, column3). So pushing up. To do that, the agent needs to be south of pos43, which is pos53 (row5?), wait no. pos43 is row4, column3. South would be row5, column3: pos53. So agent at pos53 can push up to pos43, but the stone is already there. Alternatively, the agent needs to be south of the stone to push it north. So agent at pos53, stone at pos43. To push north, the agent would move north to pos43 (same as the stone's location), but that's not possible unless they are pushing. So the push action would require the agent to be at pos53, pushing the stone from pos43 to pos33 with direction dirup. Let's check:

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirup

Preconditions:

i. Agent at pos53: yes
ii. Stone at pos43: yes
iii. pos33 is clear: yes
iv. Can move from pos53 to pos43 following dirup: yes (pos53 → pos43 is dirup)
v. Can move from pos43 to pos33 following dirup: checking movement from pos43, is dirup allowed to pos33? No. From pos43, dirup is to pos42. So no. So this action is invalid.

Thus, the direction must be dirleft. Let's see:

Agent is at pos53. To push the stone to pos33 (west), the agent must move west to pos43 (dirleft). But pos53 to pos43 is dirup, not dirleft. So this isn't possible.

This suggests that the initial approach to push the stone from pos43 to pos33 isn't feasible from pos53. Alternative idea: move the agent to pos42, which is north of pos43. Then push the stone down to pos43's south (pos53), but that's away from the goal.

Alternatively, push the stone west from pos43 to pos33, but requires the agent to be east (pos53) and move west. But movement from pos53 to pos43 is dirup, not dirleft. So that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the agent needs to take a different route. Let's think again.

Another approach: agent moves from pos51 to pos41 (dirleft), then pos41 → pos42 (dirdown), pos42 → pos43 (dirdown). But pos43 is occupied by the stone. So agent can't move there. So agent can only reach pos42. From pos42, they can push the stone south to pos44 (dirdown). But that's not helpful. Alternatively, push the stone east to pos44 (dirright). Wait, pos43's east is pos44. So if the agent is at pos42 (north of pos43), they can push the stone east to pos44. But pos44 is not a goal. So not helpful.

Alternatively, push the stone west to pos33. To do that, the agent needs to be east of pos43 (pos44 or pos53). Wait, if the agent is at pos44, can they push west to pos43? But pos44 is clear. So agent moves to pos44, then push west to pos43. But the stone is already at pos43. No.

This is getting frustrating. Maybe the correct path is to move the agent to pos53, then push the stone up to pos43's north, but how?

Wait, maybe the initial movement is correct. Let's try to outline the steps again:

1. Agent moves from pos51 to pos52 (dirdown).
2. Agent moves from pos52 to pos53 (dirdown).
3. Now at pos53. Push the stone from pos43 to pos33 with direction dirleft. But wait, the agent is at pos53 (pos5,3). To push the stone west from pos43 to pos33 (pos4,3 to pos4,2?), wait no. pos43 is row4, column3. pos33 is row3, column3. So pushing north. Hmm.

Wait, the confusion is arising from the grid layout and direction names. Let's clarify:

The directions:

- dirup: decreases the row number (north)
- dirdown: increases the row number (south)
- dirleft: decreases the column number (west)
- dirright: increases the column number (east)

So, for example, moving dirup from pos43 (row4, column3) would take the agent to pos33 (row3, column3). Moving dirleft from pos43 would take to pos42 (row4, column2). Wait, no. Wait, pos43 is row4, column3. dirleft would decrease column to 2: pos42. dirright would increase column to4: pos44. dirdown increases row to5: pos53. dirup decreases row to3: pos33.

Ah, I see. So moving dirup from pos43 leads to pos33. Moving dirleft leads to pos42.

So, in that case, the agent at pos53 (row5, column3) can move dirup to pos43 (row4, column3). Then, pushing the stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirup). The direction for the push action would be dirup. Let's check the preconditions:

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirup

Preconditions:

i. Agent at pos53: yes.
ii. Stone at pos43: yes.
iii. pos33 is clear: yes.
iv. Can move from pos53 to pos43 following dirup: yes (as per movement rules).
v. Can move from pos43 to pos33 following dirup: yes, since moving dirup from pos43 to pos33 is allowed.
vi. pos33 is not a goal: yes, pos33 is not a goal.

So this action is valid. After this action:

- Agent moves to pos43.
- Stone moves to pos33.
- pos53 becomes clear.
- pos43 is now occupied by the agent.
- pos33 has the stone.

Then, next step: push the stone from pos33 to pos23 (dirup). The agent is at pos43. To do this, the agent needs to move to pos33 and push dirup. Wait, but the agent is at pos43. How can they get to a position to push the stone from pos33 to pos23?

The agent is at pos43 after the first push. To push the stone from pos33 to pos23 (dirup), the agent must be able to move from their current location to pos33 following direction d, and then the stone moves from pos33 to pos23 following the same direction d.

So possible direction: dirup. From pos43 to pos33 is dirup (as before). Then from pos33 to pos23 is dirup. So the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirup

Check preconditions:

i. Agent at pos43: yes.
ii. Stone at pos33: yes.
iii. pos23 is clear: yes.
iv. Can move from pos43 to pos33 following dirup: yes.
v. Can move from pos33 to pos23 following dirup: yes.
vi. pos23 is not a goal: yes.

This action is valid. After this:

- Agent moves to pos33.
- Stone moves to pos23.
- pos43 becomes clear.
- pos23 has the stone.

Next, push the stone from pos23 to pos22 (dirleft) or pos21 (dirup). Let's see. The goal is pos21. So we need to get the stone to pos21.

From pos23, pushing dirup would take the stone to pos13 (row1, column3), which is not helpful. Pushing dirleft would take to pos22 (row2, column2), but pos22 is not a goal. Wait, pos21 is the goal. How to get from pos23 to pos21?

Looking at the movement allowed from pos23:

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos23 to location pos33 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos23 to location pos22 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos23 to location pos24 following direction dirdown"

Wait, dirup from pos23 leads to pos22 (row2, column3 → row2, column3? No, wait. pos23 is row2, column3. dirup would decrease the row to 1: pos13. Wait, no. dirup from pos23 would go to pos13? No. Wait, the movement directions need to be checked again.

Looking back:

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirleft"

So dirleft from pos23 is pos13. "You may move from location pos23 to location pos22 following direction dirup". Wait, pos23 to pos22 is dirup. So dirup from pos23 (row2, column3) leads to pos22 (row2, column2)? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the movement directions. For example, moving dirup from pos23 should lead to a location with a lower row number. pos23 is row2, column3. dirup would go to row1, column3: pos13. But according to the given movement, pos23 can move to pos22 via dirup. So perhaps pos22 is row2, column2. So moving dirup from pos23 (row2, column3) to pos22 (row2, column2) would actually be dirleft. This suggests that there might be inconsistencies in the direction labels. This complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the movement directions are based on grid connections rather than pure direction names. For example, pos23 to pos22 is considered dirup even if it's west. This would mean that direction labels don't correspond to actual compass directions but to the connections as defined.

In any case, according to the given movement rules:

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos22 following direction dirup"

So from pos23, dirup leads to pos22. Then, from pos22, dirup leads to pos21. Let's check:

From pos22, the movements include:

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos22 to location pos32 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos22 to location pos21 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos22 to location pos23 following direction dirdown"

So, from pos22, dirup leads to pos21. Therefore, to get the stone from pos23 to pos21, the path would be pos23 → pos22 (dirup), then pos22 → pos21 (dirup).

But the agent is currently at pos33 after the second push. Wait, after the second push (pos33 to pos23), the agent is at pos33 (since the action's effect moves the agent to l_from, which is pos33 in this case). So after the second push:

- Agent is at pos33.

Now, the stone is at pos23. The agent needs to push it to pos22 (dirup), then to pos21 (dirup).

First, push from pos23 to pos22:

Agent is at pos33. To push the stone from pos23 to pos22 (dirup), the agent needs to be south of pos23 (pos33 is row3, column3; pos23 is row2, column3. South of pos23 is row3, column3: pos33. So the agent is already at pos33. Can they push the stone from pos23 to pos22?

The action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos22 dirup.

Check preconditions:

i. Agent at pos33: yes.
ii. Stone at pos23: yes.
iii. pos22 is clear: initially, yes.
iv. Can move from pos33 to pos23 following dirup: Yes, because from pos33, dirup leads to pos23. Check movement rules: "You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirup". Yes.
v. Can move from pos23 to pos22 following dirup: Yes, as per movement rules.
vi. pos22 is not a goal: Correct.

So this action is valid. After this:

- Agent moves to pos23.
- Stone moves to pos22.
- pos33 becomes clear.
- pos22 now has the stone.

Next, push the stone from pos22 to pos21 (dirup). The agent is at pos23. To push the stone north to pos21, the agent needs to be south of pos22. pos22 is row2, column2. South of pos22 is row3, column2: pos32. But the agent is at pos23 (row2, column3). So they need to move to pos32 to push north.

Wait, this is getting complex. Let's see:

After pushing to pos22, the agent is at pos23. To push from pos22 to pos21, the agent needs to be at a position that allows them to move to pos22 in direction d, and then pos22 to pos21 in direction d.

Possible direction: dirup. So the agent must be south of pos22 (pos32) to push north. So the agent needs to move from pos23 to pos32.

Path:

Agent is at pos23. From pos23, movement allowed:

- dirleft to pos13
- dirright to pos33
- dirup to pos22
- dirdown to pos24

The agent needs to get to pos32. From pos23, how?

From pos23, can the agent move to pos24 (dirdown), then pos34 (dirdown), then pos33 (dirleft), etc.? This is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to outline the steps:

After pushing the stone to pos22, agent is at pos23. They need to push the stone from pos22 to pos21. To do this:

Agent needs to be south of pos22 (pos32) to push north. So the agent must move from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown), pos24 to pos34 (dirdown), then pos34 to pos33 (dirup), pos33 to pos32 (dirleft), then pos32 to pos22 (dirup). This is a long path, but let's check.

Alternatively, agent can move from pos23 to pos22 (dirup), but that's where the stone is. So they can't move there. Alternatively, move from pos23 to pos13 (dirleft), then down to pos14, etc. This is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, after the stone is at pos22, the agent is at pos23. They can move to pos24 (dirdown), then pos34 (dirdown), then pos44 (dirdown), but this doesn't help. Alternatively, move west to pos13, but that's not helpful.

Maybe there's a shorter path. Let's think: agent is at pos23. They need to get to pos32 (south of pos22). How?

From pos23, they can move down to pos24 (dirdown), then left to pos34 (dirleft?), no. Wait, pos24's movement options: "You may move from location pos24 to location pos14 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos24 to location pos34 following direction dirright", etc. So from pos24, dirright leads to pos34. Then, from pos34, dirleft leads to pos24. Not helpful.

Alternatively, from pos23, move down to pos24 (dirdown), then from pos24 to pos34 (dirright), then pos34 to pos33 (dirup), pos33 to pos32 (dirleft), then pos32 to pos22 (dirup). Now agent is at pos22. Then push the stone to pos21.

But this seems very long. Is there a better way?

Alternatively, after the stone is at pos22, the agent can move to pos23's dirup to pos22 (but the stone is there). So that's not possible. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the agent can perform a move action from pos23 to pos22, but since pos22 has the stone, it's not clear. No, the stone is at pos22, so the location is not clear. The agent can't move there unless pushing.

So the agent must find another route. Let's try:

Agent at pos23:

1. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
2. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirdown
3. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
4. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirleft
5. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup

Now agent is at pos22. But pos22 has the stone, so the agent can't move there. Wait, no. The stone is at pos22, so pos22 is not clear. The agent can't move there. So this approach is invalid.

Alternative idea: after the stone is at pos22, the agent needs to push it to pos21. To do that, the agent must be at pos32 (south of pos22) and push dirup. So the agent needs to get to pos32.

Path from pos23 to pos32:

1. pos23 → pos24 (dirdown)
2. pos24 → pos34 (dirdown)
3. pos34 → pos33 (dirup)
4. pos33 → pos32 (dirleft)

Now at pos32. Then, push the stone from pos22 to pos21.

Action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos21 dirup

Check preconditions:

i. Agent at pos32: yes.
ii. Stone at pos22: yes.
iii. pos21 is clear: Initially, yes.
iv. Can move from pos32 to pos22 dirup: Yes. From pos32, dirup leads to pos22.
v. Can move from pos22 to pos21 dirup: Yes. From pos22, dirup leads to pos21.
vi. pos21 is a goal: yes.

So this action is valid. After this:

- Agent moves to pos22.
- Stone moves to pos21.
- pos32 becomes clear.
- pos21 is now occupied by the stone.

This achieves the goal.

So putting all the steps together:

1. Move player1 from pos51 to pos52 (dirdown)
2. Move player1 from pos52 to pos53 (dirdown)
3. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos33 (dirup) using pushtonongoal
4. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos23 (dirup) using pushtonongoal
5. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos22 (dirup) using pushtonongoal
6. Move player1 from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown)
7. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 (dirdown)
8. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33 (dirup)
9. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32 (dirleft)
10. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos21 (dirup) using pushtogoal

But wait, step 3 is pushing from pos43 to pos33 with dirup, which is valid. Then step4 is pushing from pos33 to pos23 with dirup, which is valid. Then step5 is pushing from pos23 to pos22 with dirup. Then steps6-9 move the agent to pos32. Then step10 pushes to pos21.

But is there a shorter path? For example, after step5 (stone at pos22, agent at pos23), can the agent move directly to pos32 via a different route?

Let's see: after step5, the agent is at pos23. They need to reach pos32. The movement from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown), then to pos34 (dirdown), then to pos33 (dirup), then to pos32 (dirleft) is four moves. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, from pos23, move to pos22 (dirup) – but pos22 has the stone, so no. Move to pos13 (dirleft), then pos13 to pos14 (dirdown), pos14 to pos24 (dirright), etc. Not helpful.

Alternatively, pos23 to pos24 (dirdown), pos24 to pos34 (dirright), pos34 to pos33 (dirup), pos33 to pos32 (dirleft). That's four moves. 

But perhaps there's a way to do it in fewer steps. However, given the constraints, this might be the minimal path.

But this seems too long. Let's recount the steps:

Initial moves to get to the stone:

1. move pos51 → pos52 (dirdown)
2. move pos52 → pos53 (dirdown)
3. pushtonongoal to pos43 → pos33 (dirup)

Then:

4. pushtonongoal pos33 → pos23 (dirup)
5. pushtonongoal pos23 → pos22 (dirup)

Then, agent is at pos23. Needs to get to pos32 to push to pos21:

6. move pos23 → pos24 (dirdown)
7. move pos24 → pos34 (dirdown)
8. move pos34 → pos33 (dirup)
9. move pos33 → pos32 (dirleft)
10. pushtogoal pos22 → pos21 (dirup)

Total of 10 actions. But this seems longer than necessary. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternative idea: after step5 (stone at pos22, agent at pos23), instead of moving down to pos24, perhaps the agent can move west to pos13 (dirleft), then down to pos14, then right to pos24, etc. But this might not save steps.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos22, the agent is at pos23. Can the agent move west to pos13 (dirleft), then south to pos14 (dirdown), then east to pos24 (dirright), then south to pos34 (dirdown), then west to pos33 (dirleft), then south to pos43 (dirdown)? This seems longer.

Alternatively, after pushing to pos22, the agent is at pos23. They can move dirright to pos24 (dirdown?), no. From pos23, movement options are:

pos23 can move to pos13 (dirleft), pos33 (dirright), pos22 (dirup), pos24 (dirdown).

So from pos23, moving dirright to pos33. Then from pos33, move dirleft to pos32. Then pos32 to pos22 (dirup). But pos22 has the stone, so agent can't move there. So agent can go from pos33 to pos32 (dirleft), then pos32 to pos22 (dirup), but pos22 is occupied. So agent can't.

Alternatively, from pos33, agent can move to pos32 (dirleft), then pos32 to pos31 (dirup), etc. Not helpful.

This is getting too time-consuming. Let's proceed with the initial plan, even if it's 10 steps. But I'm not sure if that's optimal.

Wait, perhaps there's a shorter path. Let's think again.

After the first three steps (stone at pos33), agent is at pos43. Then, push to pos23, agent at pos33. Then push to pos22, agent at pos23. Then, from pos23, move to pos24 (dirdown), then pos34 (dirdown), then pos33 (dirup), then pos32 (dirleft), then pushtogoal. But that's four moves and a push.

Alternatively, can the agent after step5 (stone at pos22, agent at pos23), move to pos24 (dirdown), then pos34 (dirdown), then pos44 (dirdown), then pos43 (dirup), then pos42 (dirup), then pos32 (dirleft), then pos22 (dirup). No, that's even longer.

Alternatively, perhaps after pushing the stone to pos22, the agent can move directly to pos32 via a different route. For example:

Agent at pos23 → pos24 (dirdown), pos24 → pos34 (dirdown), pos34 → pos33 (dirup), pos33 → pos32 (dirleft). That's four moves, then push.

So total steps would be:

1. move pos51 → pos52 (dirdown)
2. move pos52 → pos53 (dirdown)
3. pushtonongoal pos53 pos43 pos33 dirup
4. pushtonongoal pos43 pos33 pos23 dirup
5. pushtonongoal pos33 pos23 pos22 dirup
6. move pos23 → pos24 (dirdown)
7. move pos24 → pos34 (dirdown)
8. move pos34 → pos33 (dirup)
9. move pos33 → pos32 (dirleft)
10. pushtogoal pos32 pos22 pos21 dirup

This results in 10 actions. But perhaps there's a way to combine steps or find a shorter path.

Wait, after step5 (agent at pos23), instead of moving down to pos24, maybe the agent can move to pos33 (dirright from pos23), then to pos32 (dirleft), then to pos22 (dirup). But pos23 to pos33 is dirright, which is allowed. So:

5. After pushing to pos22, agent is at pos23.

6. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright

7. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirleft

8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos21 dirup

That's three steps instead of four. So steps 6-8 instead of 6-10.

So the plan would be:

1. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
2. move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirup
4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirup
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos23 pos22 dirup (Wait, no. The stone is at pos23, and we need to push it to pos22. The agent must be at pos33 to push dirup to pos23. Wait, no. Let me re-examine.

After step4, the stone is at pos23, and the agent is at pos33. Then step5 is pushing from pos23 to pos22:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos22 dirup

Then, agent is at pos23. Then:

6. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright (from pos23 to pos33 via dirright)
7. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirleft
8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos21 dirup

This would be 8 steps total. Let's check:

1. move to pos52
2. move to pos53
3. push to pos33
4. push to pos23
5. push to pos22 (agent now at pos23)
6. move to pos33 (dirright)
7. move to pos32 (dirleft)
8. push to pos21

This totals 8 actions. Let's verify each step:

Step 1: move pos51 to pos52 (valid)
Step 2: move pos52 to pos53 (valid)
Step3: push stone from pos43 to pos33. Agent at pos53, direction dirup (valid)
Step4: push stone from pos33 to pos23. Agent now at pos43? Wait, no. After step3, the agent is at pos43 (l_from is pos43). Then step4 is pushing from pos33 to pos23, but the agent needs to be at pos43 to do that. So step4 would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirup

Yes. After step3, agent is at pos43.

Step4: push from pos33 to pos23. Agent must be at pos43, which is south of pos33. Direction dirup. Yes. After this, agent is at pos33.

Step5: push from pos23 to pos22. Agent must be at pos33, direction dirup. Yes. After this, agent is at pos23.

Step6: move from pos23 to pos33 via dirright. From pos23, dirright is allowed (to pos33). Yes.

Step7: move from pos33 to pos32 via dirleft. Yes.

Step8: push from pos22 to pos21. Agent is at pos32, direction dirup. Yes.

This reduces the total steps to 8, which is better.

So the plan would be:

```
move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos22 dirup
move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
move player1 pos33 pos32 dirleft
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos21 dirup
```

Let me verify each action's preconditions:

Step3: pushtonongoal. Agent at pos53, stone at pos43. Can move pos53→pos43 dirup. Stone moves dirup to pos33 (valid). pos33 is not a goal. Yes.

Step4: Agent now at pos43. Stone at pos33. Push to pos23 dirup. Agent moves from pos43→pos33 dirup (valid), stone moves dirup to pos23. pos23 is not a goal. Yes.

Step5: Agent at pos33. Stone at pos23. Push to pos22 dirup. Agent moves from pos33→pos23 dirup (valid), stone moves dirup to pos22. pos22 is not a goal. Yes.

Step6: Agent at pos23. Move to pos33 dirright (valid).

Step7: Agent at pos33. Move to pos32 dirleft (valid).

Step8: pushtogoal. Agent at pos32. Stone at pos22. Push to pos21 dirup. Valid as pos21 is a goal. All preconditions met.

This results in 8 actions, which seems optimal. Are there any redundant steps? For example, after step5, the agent is at pos23. Could they move directly to pos32 in fewer steps?

From pos23, can the agent move to pos24 (dirdown), then pos34 (dirdown), then pos33 (dirup), then pos32 (dirleft). That's four steps, but in the current plan, after step5, the agent moves to pos33 (step6) and then pos32 (step7), which is two moves. This is better.

Thus, this plan is valid and has 8 steps. I think this is the optimal plan.
