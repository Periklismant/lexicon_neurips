Alright, so I'm given a Sokoban-like puzzle problem where the agent needs to push stones to goal positions. Let me break down the problem:

**World setup:**
- 5x5 grid (positions pos11 to pos55, where the first digit is the row and the second is the column)
- Agent (player1) is initially at pos35
- Stone (stone1) is initially at pos34
- Goal position is pos44
- The adjacency of positions is defined by movement rules, e.g., "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"

**Actions:**
1. `move p l_from l_to d`: Move the agent from one location to another.
2. `pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d`: Push a stone from a location to a goal location.
3. `pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d`: Push a stone from a location to a non-goal location.

**Current state:**
- player1 is at location pos35
- stone1 is at location pos34
- pos44 is a goal location (all other positions are not goal locations)

**Goal:**
- stone1 is at a goal location (i.e., pos44)

**Constraints:**
- Various constraints like "Location pos24 is not clear" must hold at most once in a continuous sequence of states, "player1 is at location pos25" must hold in at least one state, etc.

Let me visualize the grid first to get a clearer picture:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1 [][][] [] []
2 [][][] [] []
3 [][][] [S][]
4 [][][] [G][]
5 [][][] [] []
```

Where [P] is the player (at pos35), [S] is the stone (at pos34), and [G] is the goal position (at pos44).

I need to come up with a plan to move the stone from pos34 to pos44.

First, let me understand the constraints better:

1. "The following expression must hold in at most one continuous sequence of states: 'Location pos24 is not clear'" - This means once pos24 gets occupied, it can be continuously occupied for some time, but once it becomes clear again, it can't be re-occupied.
2. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'player1 is at location pos25'" - The player must be at pos25 at least once during the plan.
3. "If expression 'player1 is at location pos25' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "Location pos25 is not clear", "Location pos24 is not clear'"" - Before the player is at pos25, either pos25 or pos24 must have been occupied.
4. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'Location pos24 is not clear'" - pos24 must be occupied at least once during the plan.
5. "If expression 'Location pos24 is not clear' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'Location pos42 is not clear'" - Before pos24 is occupied, pos42 must have been occupied.
6. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'The following conditions are all true: "player1 is at location pos22", "stone1 is at location pos43"'" - At some point, the player must be at pos22 and the stone at pos43.
7. "The following expression must hold in at most one continuous sequence of states: 'Location pos25 is not clear'" - Similar to constraint 1, but for pos25.
8. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'player1 is at location pos54'" - The player must be at pos54 at least once.
9. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'Location pos25 is not clear'" - pos25 must be occupied at least once.
10. "If expression 'Location pos25 is not clear' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'stone1 is at location pos42'" - Before pos25 is occupied, the stone must have been at pos42.
11. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "stone1 is at location pos11", "stone1 is at location pos32"'" - The stone must be at either pos11 or pos32 at some point.
12. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'stone1 is at location pos34'" - The stone must be at pos34 at least once (this is already satisfied in the initial state).
13. "If expression 'stone1 is at location pos34' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "Location pos54 is not clear", "player1 is at location pos12"' must hold at s or at some state after s" - After or at the same time the stone is at pos34, either pos54 must be occupied or the player must be at pos12.
14. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'Location pos51 is not clear'" - pos51 must be occupied at least once.

Now, let me think about how to satisfy these constraints while moving the stone to the goal.

Given the constraints, it seems like I need to move the stone through several positions. Let's start planning:

Initial state:
- player1 is at pos35
- stone1 is at pos34

To push the stone from pos34 to pos44 (the goal), I need to position the player to the left of the stone, i.e., at pos24.

Let's see if I can trace a path that satisfies all the constraints:

1. First, I need to move the player to pos24.
   - From pos35, I can move to pos25, then to pos24.

2. From pos24, I can push the stone to pos44 (the goal).

However, this doesn't satisfy all the constraints. Let me re-think...

Looking at the constraints, it seems I need to move the stone through several positions:
- It needs to be at pos34 (already there).
- It needs to be at either pos11 or pos32.
- It needs to be at pos42.
- It needs to be at pos43.
- Finally, it needs to be at pos44 (the goal).

And the player needs to visit:
- pos22 (when the stone is at pos43)
- pos25
- pos54

Let me try to trace a more complex path:

1. Move player to pos34's left (pos24).
2. Push stone to pos44 (the goal).
3. Move player to pos54.
4. ... (continue based on constraints)

Wait, this still doesn't satisfy all the constraints. Let me re-think...

I need to ensure that at some point:
- The stone is at pos32 (to satisfy constraint 11).
- The player is at pos22 and the stone is at pos43 (to satisfy constraint 6).

I also need to:
- Occupy pos42 with something (to satisfy constraint 5).
- Occupy pos51 with something (to satisfy constraint 14).

Let me try to trace a path that includes all these positions:

1. Initial state: player at pos35, stone at pos34.
2. Move player to pos24 (left of stone).
3. Push stone from pos34 to pos33.
4. Move player from pos33 (after pushing) to pos32.
5. Push stone from pos33 to pos32.
6. Move player from pos32 (after pushing) to pos31.
7. Move player to pos41 (to position for the next push).
8. Move player to pos42.
9. Move player to pos32 (right of stone).
10. Push stone from pos32 to pos33.
11. Push stone from pos33 to pos43.
12. Move player to pos22 (satisfying constraint 6).
13. ... (continue to eventually get the stone to pos44)

This is getting complex. Let me take a step back and try to visualize the grid and the movement constraints.

Actually, let me add the player's position to the grid for clarity:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1 [][][] [] []
2 [][][] [] []
3 [][][] [S][P]
4 [][][] [G][]
5 [][][] [] []
```

Where [P] is the player (at pos35), [S] is the stone (at pos34), and [G] is the goal position (at pos44).

Now, I'll try to come up with a plan:

1. Move player from pos35 to pos45.
2. Move player from pos45 to pos44.
3. Move player from pos44 to pos34 (right of stone).
4. Push stone from pos34 to pos24 (satisfying constraint 4).
5. Move player from pos24 (after pushing) to pos25 (satisfying constraint 2).
6. Move player to pos15.
7. ... (continue to eventually get the stone to pos32, then to pos43, and finally to pos44)

I realize that I need to plan this more systematically.

Let's first check which constraints are already satisfied in the initial state:
- Constraint 12: "stone1 is at location pos34" is already satisfied.

Now, let's think about a path that takes the stone from pos34 to pos44 while satisfying all the other constraints. It seems like we need to go through a circuitous route to meet all the constraints.

Initial state: player at pos35, stone at pos34.

1. **Move player to pos25** (to be in a position to push the stone).
2. **Move player to pos24** (to be in a position to push the stone).
3. **Push stone from pos34 to pos44** (the goal). Now, the stone is at a goal location, but we still need to satisfy other constraints.
4. **Move player from pos34 (after pushing) to pos35**.
5. **Move player from pos35 to pos45**.
6. **Move player from pos45 to pos55**.
7. **Move player from pos55 to pos54** (satisfying constraint 8).
8. **Move player from pos54 to pos44** (right of stone).
9. **Push stone from pos44 to pos43**.
10. **Move player from pos43 (after pushing) to pos33**.
11. **Move player from pos33 to pos32** (to position for the next push). The stone is now at pos43 and we need to get the player to pos22.
12. **Move player from pos32 to pos22** (satisfying constraint 6 when combined with stone at pos43).
13. **Move player from pos22 to pos32**.
14. **Move player from pos32 to pos42** (satisfying part of constraint 5).
15. **Push stone from pos43 to pos42** (satisfying constraint 10).
16. **Move player from pos42 (after pushing) to pos52**.
17. **Move player from pos52 to pos51** (satisfying constraint 14).

At this point, we have the stone at pos42 and the player at pos51. We need to get the stone to pos32 (to satisfy constraint 11). But we've already pushed the stone from various positions, so we need to be careful not to violate the "at most one continuous sequence" constraints. Let's continue:

18. **Move player from pos51 to pos41**.
19. **Move player from pos41 to pos42** (right of stone).
20. **Push stone from pos42 to pos32** (satisfying constraint 11).
21. **Move player from pos32 (after pushing) to pos22**.
22. **Move player from pos22 to pos12** (satisfying part of constraint 13).
23. **Move player from pos12 to pos22**.
24. **Move player from pos22 to pos32** (right of stone).
25. **Push stone from pos32 to pos33**.
26. **Push stone from pos33 to pos34** (returning to the initial stone position).
27. **Move player from pos34 (after pushing) to pos24**.
28. **Push stone from pos34 to pos44** (the goal).

This plan seems to satisfy all the constraints. Let's double-check:

Constraint 1: "Location pos24 is not clear" is only continuously true once (when the stone is there).
Constraint 2: Player is at pos25 at step 1.
Constraint 3: Before player is at pos25, pos24 is not clear.
Constraint 4: pos24 is not clear at step 4.
Constraint 5: Before pos24 is not clear, pos42 is not clear (at step 15).
Constraint 6: Player is at pos22 and stone is at pos43 at step 12.
Constraint 7: "Location pos25 is not clear" is only continuously true once.
Constraint 8: Player is at pos54 at step 7.
Constraint 9: pos25 is not clear at some point.
Constraint 10: Before pos25 is not clear, stone is at pos42 (at step 15).
Constraint 11: Stone is at pos32 at step 20.
Constraint 12: Stone is at pos34 at the initial state.
Constraint 13: After stone is at pos34, player is at pos12 (at step 22).
Constraint 14: pos51 is not clear at step 17.

Let's double check if this plan is valid.

Actually, I realized I misunderstood something. The constraints don't necessarily all need to be satisfied in a strictly sequential order. For instance, if the player moves to pos25 at some point, then before that point, either pos25 or pos24 should have been occupied. It doesn't mean that these are the only moves the player can make.

Let me reorganize my thinking and come up with a plan:

Initial state: player at pos35, stone at pos34.

1. player1 moves from pos35 to pos25.
2. player1 moves from pos25 to pos24.
3. player1 pushes stone1 from pos34 to pos44 (goal).
4. player1 moves from pos34 to pos24.
5. player1 moves from pos24 to pos14.
6. player1 moves from pos14 to pos13.
7. player1 moves from pos13 to pos12.
8. player1 moves from pos12 to pos22.
9. player1 moves from pos22 to pos32.
10. player1 moves from pos32 to pos33.
11. player1 moves from pos33 to pos43.
12. player1 pushes stone1 from pos44 to pos43.
13. player1 moves from pos43 to pos33.
14. player1 moves from pos33 to pos32.
15. player1 moves from pos32 to pos22.
16. player1 moves from pos22 to pos23.
17. player1 moves from pos23 to pos33.
18. player1 moves from pos33 to pos43.
19. player1 pushes stone1 from pos43 to pos33.
20. player1 moves from pos33 to pos32.
21. player1 pushes stone1 from pos33 to pos32.
22. player1 moves from pos32 to pos31.
23. player1 moves from pos31 to pos41.
24. player1 moves from pos41 to pos42.
25. player1 moves from pos42 to pos43.
26. player1 moves from pos43 to pos33.
27. player1 moves from pos33 to pos32.
28. player1 pushes stone1 from pos32 to pos42.
29. player1 moves from pos42 to pos43.
30. player1 moves from pos43 to pos44.
31. player1 moves from pos44 to pos54.
32. player1 moves from pos54 to pos53.
33. player1 moves from pos53 to pos52.
34. player1 moves from pos52 to pos51.
35. player1 moves from pos51 to pos41.
36. player1 pushes stone1 from pos42 to pos43.
37. player1 moves from pos43 to pos33.
38. player1 moves from pos33 to pos23.
39. player1 moves from pos23 to pos22.
40. player1 moves from pos22 to pos32.
41. player1 moves from pos32 to pos42.
42. player1 moves from pos42 to pos43.
43. player1 pushes stone1 from pos43 to pos44 (goal).

Actually, I think I've been trying to be too clever, and in the process making things more convoluted than they need to be. I'm going to take a step back, and only directly apply the constraints.

So we have constraints 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 that require certain things to be true at least once. Let's make sure our plan satisfies all of these:

1. Player at pos35, stone at pos34 (initial state).
2. player1 moves to pos25.
3. player1 moves to pos24.
4. player1 pushes stone1 from pos34 to pos44 (goal). The stone is now at a goal location.
5. player1 moves from pos34 to pos24.
6. player1 moves from pos24 to pos14.
7. player1 moves from pos14 to pos13.
8. player1 moves from pos13 to pos12.
9. player1 moves from pos12 to pos22.
10. player1 moves from pos22 to pos32.
11. player1 moves from pos32 to pos33.
12. player1 moves from pos33 to pos43.
13. player1 pushes stone1 from pos44 to pos43.
14. player1 moves from pos43 to pos33.
15. player1 moves from pos33 to pos32.
16. player1 moves from pos32 to pos22. Now player1 is at pos22 and stone1 is at pos43, satisfying constraint 6.
17. player1 moves from pos22 to pos32.
18. player1 moves from pos32 to pos42.
19. player1 pushes stone1 from pos43 to pos42. Now stone1 is at pos42, which we need for constraint 10.
20. player1 moves from pos42 to pos43.
21. player1 moves from pos43 to pos53.
22. player1 moves from pos53 to pos54. Now player1 is at pos54, satisfying constraint 8.
23. player1 moves from pos54 to pos53.
24. player1 moves from pos53 to pos52.
25. player1 moves from pos52 to pos51. pos51 is now not clear, satisfying constraint 14.
26. player1 moves from pos51 to pos52.
27. player1 moves from pos52 to pos42.
28. player1 pushes stone1 from pos42 to pos32. Now stone1 is at pos32, satisfying constraint 11.
29. player1 moves from pos32 to pos33.
30. player1 pushes stone1 from pos32 to pos33.
31. player1 pushes stone1 from pos33 to pos34. Now stone1 is back to pos34.
32. player1 moves from pos34 to pos24.
33. player1 moves from pos24 to pos25. Now player1 is at pos25 which, combined with the fact that stone1 was at pos42 earlier (at step 19), satisfies constraints 2, 3, 9, and 10.
34. player1 moves from pos25 to pos24.
35. player1 pushes stone1 from pos34 to pos44 (goal). The stone is now at a goal location.

Let's double check again:

Constraint 1: "Location pos24 is not clear" is only continuously true once (when the stone is there).
Constraint 2: Player is at pos25 at step 33.
Constraint 3: Before player is at pos25, stone is at pos42 at step 19.
Constraint 4: pos24 is not clear at step 4.
Constraint 5: Before pos24 is not clear, pos42 is not clear (at step 19).
Constraint 6: Player is at pos22 and stone is at pos43 at step 16.
Constraint 7: "Location pos25 is not clear" is only continuously true once.
Constraint 8: Player is at pos54 at step 22.
Constraint 9: pos25 is not clear at step 33.
Constraint 10: Before pos25 is not clear, stone is at pos42 (at step 19).
Constraint 11: Stone is at pos32 at step 28.
Constraint 12: Stone is at pos34 at the initial state.
Constraint 13: After stone is at pos34 (at step 31), player is at pos12 (at step 8).
Constraint 14: pos51 is not clear at step 25.

Actually, we've already seen that constraint 13 is not satisfied, because the player needs to be at pos12 *after* the stone is at pos34, not before.

Let me revise the plan:

1. Player at pos35, stone at pos34 (initial state).
2. player1 moves to pos25. This satisfies constraints 2 and 9.
3. player1 moves to pos24. This satisfies constraint 4.
4. player1 pushes stone1 from pos34 to pos44 (goal). The stone is now at a goal location. Constraint 12 is already satisfied.
5. player1 moves from pos34 to pos24.
6. player1 moves from pos24 to pos14.
7. player1 moves from pos14 to pos13.
8. player1 moves from pos13 to pos23.
9. player1 moves from pos23 to pos33.
10. player1 moves from pos33 to pos43.
11. player1 pushes stone1 from pos44 to pos43.
12. player1 moves from pos43 to pos33.
13. player1 moves from pos33 to pos32.
14. player1 moves from pos32 to pos22. Now player1 is at pos22 and stone1 is at pos43, satisfying constraint 6.
15. player1 moves from pos22 to pos32.
16. player1 moves from pos32 to pos42. This satisfies constraint 5.
17. player1 pushes stone1 from pos43 to pos42. Now stone1 is at pos42, which is needed for constraint 10.
18. player1 moves from pos42 to pos43.
19. player1 moves from pos43 to pos53.
20. player1 moves from pos53 to pos54. Now player1 is at pos54, satisfying constraint 8.
21. player1 moves from pos54 to pos53.
22. player1 moves from pos53 to pos52.
23. player1 moves from pos52 to pos51. pos51 is now not clear, satisfying constraint 14.
24. player1 moves from pos51 to pos52.
25. player1 moves from pos52 to pos42.
26. player1 pushes stone1 from pos42 to pos32. Now stone1 is at pos32, satisfying constraint 11.
27. player1 moves from pos32 to pos33.
28. player1 pushes stone1 from pos32 to pos33.
29. player1 pushes stone1 from pos33 to pos34. Now stone1 is back to pos34.
30. player1 moves from pos34 to pos35.
31. player1 moves from pos35 to pos25.
32. player1 moves from pos25 to pos15.
33. player1 moves from pos15 to pos14.
34. player1 moves from pos14 to pos13.
35. player1 moves from pos13 to pos12. Now player1 is at pos12 after stone1 is at pos34, satisfying constraint 13.
36. player1 moves from pos12 to pos13.
37. player1 moves from pos13 to pos14.
38. player1 moves from pos14 to pos24.
39. player1 pushes stone1 from pos34 to pos44 (goal). The stone is now at a goal location.

Let's check again:

Constraint 1: "Location pos24 is not clear" is only continuously true once (when the stone is there).
Constraint 2: Player is at pos25 at steps 2 and 31.
Constraint 3: Before player is at pos25, stone is at pos42 at step 17.
Constraint 4: pos24 is not clear at step 3.
Constraint 5: Before pos24 is not clear, pos42 is not clear (at step 17).
Constraint 6: Player is at pos22 and stone is at pos43 at step 14.
Constraint 7: "Location pos25 is not clear" is only continuously true once.
Constraint 8: Player is at pos54 at step 20.
Constraint 9: pos25 is not clear at step 2 and 31.
Constraint 10: Before pos25 is not clear, stone is at pos42 (at step 17).
Constraint 11: Stone is at pos32 at step 26.
Constraint 12: Stone is at pos34 at the initial state and at step 29.
Constraint 13: After stone is at pos34 (at step 29), player is at pos12 (at step 35).
Constraint 14: pos51 is not clear at step 23.

This plan seems to satisfy all the constraints. Now, let me encode it more precisely in the required action format:

1. `move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft`
2. `move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup`
3. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright`
4. `move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft`
5. `move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft`
6. `move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup`
7. `move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright`
8. `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright`
9. `move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright`
10. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos43 dirleft`
11. `move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft`
12. `move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup`
13. `move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft`
14. `move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright`
15. `move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright`
16. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos42 dirleft`
17. `move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown`
18. `move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright`
19. `move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown`
20. `move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup`
21. `move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup`
22. `move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup`
23. `move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown`
24. `move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft`
25. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos42 pos32 dirleft`

Wait, that doesn't seem right. When the player pushes the stone, the player should end up in the position the stone was just in. Let me re-check the action definitions:

`pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d`: Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.
`pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d`: Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to non-goal location l_to, following direction d.

So in both push actions, the player starts at position `l_p`, the stone starts at position `l_from`, and the stone ends up at position `l_to`. The player ends up at position `l_from` after the push. With this clarification, let me revise the action sequence:

1. `move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft`
2. `move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup`
3. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright`
4. `move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft`
5. `move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft`
6. `move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup`
7. `move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright`
8. `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright`
9. `move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright`
10. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos43 dirleft`
11. `move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft`
12. `move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup`
13. `move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft`
14. `move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright`
15. `move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright`
16. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos42 dirleft`
17. `move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown`
18. `move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright`
19. `move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown`
20. `move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup`
21. `move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup`
22. `move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup`
23. `move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown`
24. `move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft`
25. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos42 pos32 dirleft`

Hmm, I'm getting confused with this action format. Let me think more carefully about the problem and the actions.

The action format is:
`pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d`: Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.

This means the agent is at position `l_p`, the stone is at position `l_from`, and after the action, the stone is at position `l_to` and the agent is at position `l_from`.

For this to be valid, `l_p` and `l_from` should be adjacent, and `l_from` and `l_to` should be adjacent in the same direction as `l_p` to `l_from`.

With this understanding, let me revise the action sequence:

1. `move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft` - Player moves from pos35 to pos25.
2. `move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup` - Player moves from pos25 to pos24.
3. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright` - Player, at pos24, pushes stone from pos34 to pos44. After this, player is at pos34.
4. `move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft` - Player moves from pos34 to pos24.
5. `move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft` - Player moves from pos24 to pos14.
6. `move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup` - Player moves from pos14 to pos13.
7. `move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright` - Player moves from pos13 to pos23.
8. `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright` - Player moves from pos23 to pos33.

13. `move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup` - Player moves from pos33 to pos32.
14. `move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft` - Player moves from pos32 to pos22. Now player1 is at pos22 and stone1 is at pos43, satisfying constraint 6.
15. `move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright` - Player moves from pos22 to pos32.
16. `move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright` - Player moves from pos32 to pos42. This satisfies constraint 5.
17. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos42 dirleft` - Player, at pos42, pushes stone from pos43 to pos42. After this, player is at pos43.
18. `move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright` - Player moves from pos43 to pos53.
19. `move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown` - Player moves from pos53 to pos54. Now player1 is at pos54, satisfying constraint 8.
20. `move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup` - Player moves from pos54 to pos53.
21. `move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup` - Player moves from pos53 to pos52.
22. `move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup` - Player moves from pos52 to pos51. pos51 is now not clear, satisfying constraint 14.
23. `move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown` - Player moves from pos51 to pos52.
24. `move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft` - Player moves from pos52 to pos42.
25. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos42 pos32 dirleft` - Player, at pos42, pushes stone from pos42 to pos32. After this, player is at pos42.
26. `move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft` - Player moves from pos42 to pos32.
27. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos32 pos33 dirdown` - Player, at pos32, pushes stone from pos32 to pos33. After this, player is at pos32.
28. `move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown` - Player moves from pos32 to pos33.
29. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos34 dirdown` - Player, at pos33, pushes stone from pos33 to pos34. After this, player is at pos33.
30. `move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft` - Player moves from pos33 to pos23.
31. `move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft` - Player moves from pos23 to pos13.
32. `move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup` - Player moves from pos13 to pos12. Now player1 is at pos12 after stone1 is at pos34, satisfying constraint 13.

34. `move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown` - Player moves from pos13 to pos14.
35. `move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright` - Player moves from pos14 to pos24.
36. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright` - Player, at pos24, pushes stone from pos34 to pos44. After this, player is at pos34.

Let me review this plan once more:

Constraint 1: "Location pos24 is not clear" is only continuously true once (when the stone is there or player is there).
Constraint 2: Player is at pos25 at step 1.
Constraint 3: Before player is at pos25, there's no state where pos25 or pos24 is not clear. This doesn't satisfy constraint 3.

I need to revise the plan. I misunderstood constraint 3. It states that before the player is at pos25, either pos25 or pos24 must have been not clear.

Let me start over:

1. `move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup` - Player moves from pos35 to pos34.
2. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos34 pos24 dirleft` - Player, at pos34, pushes stone from pos34 to pos24. After this, player is at pos34.

13. `move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft` - Player moves from pos45 to pos35.
14. `move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft` - Player moves from pos35 to pos25. Now the player is at pos25, which, combined with the fact that pos24 was not clear earlier, satisfies constraints 2, 3, and 9.
15. `move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup` - Player moves from pos25 to pos24.
16. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos24 pos23 dirup` - Player, at pos24, pushes stone from pos24 to pos23. After this, player is at pos24.

23. `move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown` - Player moves from pos22 to pos23.
24. `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright` - Player moves from pos23 to pos33.
25. `move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright` - Player moves from pos33 to pos43.
26. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos42 dirup` - Player, at pos43, pushes stone from pos43 to pos42. After this, player is at pos43. Now stone1 is at pos42, which is needed for constraint 10.
27. `move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright` - Player moves from pos43 to pos53.
28. `move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown` - Player moves from pos53 to pos54. Now player1 is at pos54, satisfying constraint 8.
29. `move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup` - Player moves from pos54 to pos53.
30. `move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup` - Player moves from pos53 to pos52.

36. `move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft` - Player moves from pos43 to pos33.
37. `move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup` - Player moves from pos33 to pos32.
38. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos32 pos33 dirdown` - Player, at pos32, pushes stone from pos32 to pos33. After this, player is at pos32.
39. `move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown` - Player moves from pos32 to pos33.
40. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos34 dirdown` - Player, at pos33, pushes stone from pos33 to pos34. After this, player is at pos33. Now stone1 is at pos34, which we need for constraint 12.
41. `move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft` - Player moves from pos33 to pos23.
42. `move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft` - Player moves from pos23 to pos13.

47. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright` - Player, at pos24, pushes stone from pos34 to pos44. After this, player is at pos34. Now stone1 is at a goal location, satisfying the main objective.

Actually, one more constraint I might have missed:

Constraint 7: "Location pos25 is not clear" is only continuously true once. This seems to be satisfied in the plan, as pos25 is only not clear when the player is there.

I believe this plan satisfies all the constraints. Let me review, for each constraint:

Constraint 1: "Location pos24 is not clear" is only continuously true once (when the stone or player is there).
Constraint 2: Player is at pos25 at step 14.
Constraint 3: Before player is at pos25, pos24 is not clear at step 3, satisfying constraint 3.
Constraint 4: pos24 is not clear at step 3.
Constraint 5: Before pos24 is not clear, pos42 is clear. This doesn't satisfy constraint 5.

Actually, there's still an issue. Constraint 5 says that before pos24 is not clear, pos42 must have been not clear. But I've pushed the stone to pos42 after pos24 was not clear.

Let me try again, paying special attention to the order of the constraints:

1. `move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright` - Player moves from pos35 to pos45.
2. `move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright` - Player moves from pos45 to pos55.
3. `move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup` - Player moves from pos55 to pos54.

33. `move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft` - Player moves from pos33 to pos23.

35. `move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright` - Player moves from pos22 to pos32.
36. `move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright` - Player moves from pos32 to pos42.
37. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos42 dirleft` - Player, at pos42, pushes stone from pos43 to pos42. After this, player is at pos43. Now stone1 is at pos42, which we need for constraint 10.
38. `move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright` - Player moves from pos43 to pos53.
39. `move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown` - Player moves from pos53 to pos54. This satisfies constraint 8.

43. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos42 pos32 dirleft` - Player, at pos42, pushes stone from pos42 to pos32. After this, player is at pos42. Now stone1 is at pos32, satisfying constraint 11.
44. `move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft` - Player moves from pos42 to pos32.
45. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos32 pos33 dirdown` - Player, at pos32, pushes stone from pos32 to pos33. After this, player is at pos32.
46. `move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown` - Player moves from pos32 to pos33.
47. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos34 dirdown` - Player, at pos33, pushes stone from pos33 to pos34. After this, player is at pos33. Now stone1 is at pos34, which we need for constraint 12.
48. `move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup` - Player moves from pos33 to pos32.
49. `move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft` - Player moves from pos32 to pos22.
50. `move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft` - Player moves from pos22 to pos12. Now player1 is at pos12 after stone1 is at pos34, satisfying constraint 13.
51. `move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown` - Player moves from pos12 to pos13.
52. `move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown` - Player moves from pos13 to pos14.
53. `move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright` - Player moves from pos14 to pos24.
54. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright` - Player, at pos24, pushes stone from pos34 to pos44. After this, player is at pos34. Now stone1 is at a goal location, satisfying the main objective.

Let's check once more:

Constraint 1: "Location pos24 is not clear" is only continuously true once (when the stone or player is there).
Constraint 2: Player is at pos25 at step 20.
Constraint 3: Before player is at pos25, pos24 is not clear at step 18, satisfying constraint 3.
Constraint 4: pos24 is not clear at step 18.
Constraint 5: Before pos24 is not clear, pos42 is not clear at step 14, satisfying constraint 5.
Constraint 6: Player is at pos22 and stone1 is at pos43 at step 34.
Constraint 7: "Location pos25 is not clear" is only continuously true once.
Constraint 8: Player is at pos54 at step 39.
Constraint 9: pos25 is not clear at step 20.
Constraint 10: Before pos25 is not clear, stone1 is at pos42 at step 37, satisfying constraint 10. (This check appears to be wrong; stone1 is at pos42 after pos25 is not clear).
Constraint 11: Stone1 is at pos32 at step 43.
Constraint 12: Stone1 is at pos34 at the initial state and at step 47.
Constraint 13: After stone1 is at pos34 (at step 47), player1 is at pos12 (at step 50), satisfying constraint 13.
Constraint 14: pos51 is not clear at step 12.

Actually, I messed up with constraint 10. The constraint says that if pos25 is not clear at some state, then stone1 must have been at pos42 at some earlier state. In the plan I provided, pos25 is not clear at step 20, but stone1 is at pos42 at step 37, which is after step 20. This doesn't satisfy constraint, since it's stone is at post 42 after that. Let me fix this:

45. `move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown` - Player moves from pos13 to pos14.
46. `move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright` - Player moves from pos14 to pos24. Now the player is at pos24, making pos24 not clear, which we need for constraint 4. Given that pos42 was not clear earlier (at step 14), this also satisfies constraint 5.
47. `move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright` - Player moves from pos24 to pos34.
48. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos43 pos34 dirleft` - Player, at pos34, pushes stone from pos43 to pos34. After this, player is at pos43. Now stone1 is at pos34, which we need for constraint 12.
49. `move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft` - Player moves from pos43 to pos33.
50. `move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft` - Player moves from pos33 to pos23.
51. `move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft` - Player moves from pos23 to pos13.
52. `move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup` - Player moves from pos13 to pos12. Now player1 is at pos12 after stone1 is at pos34, satisfying constraint 13.
53. `move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown` - Player moves from pos12 to pos13.
54. `move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown` - Player moves from pos13 to pos14.
55. `move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright` - Player moves from pos14 to pos24.
56. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright` - Player, at pos24, pushes stone from pos34 to pos44. After this, player is at pos34. Now stone1 is at a goal location, satisfying the main objective.

Hmm, there's a problem in step 48. I don't see a direction that can push a stone from pos43 to pos34. I'll need to rethink some parts of this plan, but I believe the overall approach is correct. Let me revise:

I think I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. Let's try a simpler approach.

1. `move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup` - Player moves from pos35 to pos34.
2. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos34 pos33 dirup` - Player, at pos34, pushes stone from pos34 to pos33. After this, player is at pos34.
3. `move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup` - Player moves from pos34 to pos33.
4. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos32 dirup` - Player, at pos33, pushes stone from pos33 to pos32. After this, player is at pos33. Now stone1 is at pos32, satisfying constraint 11.
5. `move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup` - Player moves from pos33 to pos32.
6. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos32 pos42 dirright` - Player, at pos32, pushes stone from pos32 to pos42. After this, player is at pos32. Now stone1 is at pos42, which we need for constraint 10.
7. `move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft` - Player moves from pos32 to pos22.
8. `move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft` - Player moves from pos22 to pos12.
9. `move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown` - Player moves from pos12 to pos13.
10. `move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown` - Player moves from pos13 to pos14.
11. `move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright` - Player moves from pos14 to pos24. Now the player is at pos24, making pos24 not clear, which we need for constraint 4. Given that pos42 is not clear (stone1 is there), this satisfies constraint 5.
12. `move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown` - Player moves from pos24 to pos25. Now the player is at pos25, which, given that stone1 is at pos42 and pos24 was not clear earlier, satisfies constraints 2, 3, 9, and 10.
13. `move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup` - Player moves from pos25 to pos24.
14. `move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright` - Player moves from pos24 to pos34.
15. `move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright` - Player moves from pos34 to pos44.
16. `move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright` - Player moves from pos44 to pos54. This satisfies constraint 8.
17. `move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup` - Player moves from pos54 to pos53.
18. `move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup` - Player moves from pos53 to pos52.
19. `move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup` - Player moves from pos52 to pos51. pos51 is now not clear, satisfying constraint 14.
20. `move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown` - Player moves from pos51 to pos52.
21. `move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft` - Player moves from pos52 to pos42.
22. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos42 pos43 dirdown` - Player, at pos42, pushes stone from pos42 to pos43. After this, player is at pos42.
23. `move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft` - Player moves from pos42 to pos32.
24. `move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft` - Player moves from pos32 to pos22. Now player1 is at pos22 and stone1 is at pos43, satisfying constraint 6.
25. `move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown` - Player moves from pos22 to pos23.
26. `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright` - Player moves from pos23 to pos33.
27. `move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright` - Player moves from pos33 to pos43.
28. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos34 dirup` - Player, at pos43, pushes stone from pos43 to pos34. After this, player is at pos43. Now stone1 is at pos34, which we need for constraint 12.
29. `move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft` - Player moves from pos43 to pos33.
30. `move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft` - Player moves from pos33 to pos23.
31. `move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft` - Player moves from pos23 to pos13.
32. `move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup` - Player moves from pos13 to pos12. Now player1 is at pos12 after stone1 is at pos34, satisfying constraint 13.
33. `move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown` - Player moves from pos12 to pos13.
34. `move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown` - Player moves from pos13 to pos14.
35. `move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright` - Player moves from pos14 to pos24.
36. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright` - Player, at pos24, pushes stone from pos34 to pos44. After this, player is at pos34. Now stone1 is at a goal location, satisfying the main objective.

Actually, I realize I'm having a hard time understanding the grid layout as it's not super clear what the directions left, right, up, and down correspond to, so I might be making some mistakes. But based on the provided rules of movement, I believe this plan should satisfy all the constraints, or at least be close to doing so.

Let me check once more:

Actually I was confused by the directions; let me clarify:

- dirleft: decreases the second digit of the position (moving left in a 2D grid)
- dirright: increases the second digit of the position (moving right in a 2D grid)
- dirup: decreases the first digit of the position (moving up in a 2D grid)
- dirdown: increases the first digit of the position (moving down in a 2D grid)

I was indeed interpreting posXY correctly where X is the row (1-5, from top to bottom) and Y is the column (1-5, from left to right).

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1 [][][] [] []
2 [][][] [] []
3 [][][] [S][P]
4 [][][] [G][]
5 [][][] [] []
```

Let me re-evaluate our plan step by step:

Actually, let's look at step 28 in our plan:

28. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos34 dirup` - Player, at pos43, pushes stone from pos43 to pos34. After this, player is at pos43.

Wait, I don't think this makes sense. If we're at pos43 and trying to push a stone to pos34, we'd be pushing in the `dirup` and `dirleft` directions, but the action only allows for one direction. This suggests that either my understanding of the grid or the actions is off. Let me re-read the problem.

I think I understand. when we push a stone, it moves one cell away from the agent in the same direction as the agent's movement to reach the cell containing the stone.

So, if we're at pos43 and want to push a stone to pos34:

1. The direction from pos43 to pos34 would be dirup (to get to the row) and dirleft (to get to the column).
2. This isn't a single direction as required by the action, so I don't believe this is directly possible.

In fact, I can't push from position pos43 to position pos34 because they are not in the same row or column with this grid layout.

I will redo the entire plan:

Initial state: player at pos35, stone at pos34.

1. `move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup` - Player moves from pos35 to pos34. (This doesn't make sense as "dirup" would be posXY -> pos(X-1)Y, which is from pos35 -> pos25. Let me fix this.)

Ah, I think I was confused. The problem says the adjacency of cells is given by the "You may move from..." rules, which define the valid moves. Let's re-read those rules.

Alright, for example, from the adjacency list:
```
"You may move from location pos35 to location pos25 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos35 to location pos45 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos35 to location pos34 following direction dirup"
```

This means:
- From pos35, moving in dirleft direction takes you to pos25.
- From pos35, moving in dirright direction takes you to pos45.
- From pos35, moving in dirup direction takes you to pos34.

Let's map out the grid more clearly:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1 [][][] [] []
2 [][][] [] []
3 [][][] [S][P]
4 [][][] [G][]
5 [][][] [] []
```

So, from the player's position (pos35), we can move:
- dirleft to pos25
- dirright to pos45
- dirup to pos34

And this would be:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1 [][][] [] []
2 [][][] [] []
3 [][][] [S][P]  <- Player at pos35
                     dirleft to pos25 (left)
                     dirright to pos45 (right)
                     dirup to pos34 (up, where the stone is)
4 [][][] [G][]
5 [][][] [] []
```

So when I said:
`move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup` - Player moves from pos35 to pos34.

That's actually correct because the direction rules indicate that from pos35, going in the dirup direction takes you to pos34.

Let's double check this: Yep, the rule quoted above indeed says "You may move from location pos35 to location pos34 following direction dirup".

Alright, I'll restate the plan using these movement rules:

1. `move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup` - Player moves from pos35 to pos34.
2. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos34 pos33 dirup` - Player, at pos34, pushes stone from pos34 to pos33. After this, player is at pos34.
3. `move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup` - Player moves from pos34 to pos33.
4. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos32 dirup` - Player, at pos33, pushes stone from pos33 to pos32. After this, player is at pos33. Now stone1 is at pos32, satisfying constraint 11.
