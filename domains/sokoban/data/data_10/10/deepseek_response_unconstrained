Wait, the second action is pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos32 pos22 dirleft. But l_from should be the current location of the stone, which after the first move, the agent is at pos32, but the stone was pushed to pos22. Wait, no. The first action is move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft. Then, the agent is at pos32. Then, the stone is still at pos32? No, the initial state says stone1 is at pos32, and pos32 is clear. So the move action would move the agent to pos32, but the stone is there. That's impossible. Therefore, the first action can't be a move, but must be a push.

So the first action should be pushtonongoal, but the agent is at pos42, stone at pos32. So the first action is pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft. This is valid. After that, the agent is at pos32, stone at pos22.

Then, to push from pos22 to pos12, the agent is at pos32, so pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft. Then agent is at pos22.

Then move to pos21, then to pos11, then push to pos13. So the correct plan is:

```
```
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft
move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown
```
```

This is 5 actions. But perhaps there's a shorter way. Let me check again.

Alternative: After pushing to pos22, agent is at pos32. Can they move directly to pos12? No, because pos22 has the stone. So no. So the steps are necessary. Therefore, the optimal plan has 5 actions.
