Okay, let's see. I need to find a plan to move stone1 to a goal location. The only goal location mentioned is pos13. So the stone is currently at pos32, and I need to get it to pos13. The agent starts at pos42. 

First, I need to figure out how the agent can reach the stone. The stone is at pos32. The agent is at pos42. Looking at the movement possibilities, from pos42, the agent can move to pos32 (left), pos52 (right), pos41 (up), or pos43 (down). So moving left to pos32 would get the agent adjacent to the stone. But wait, pos32 is where the stone is. Oh, but in the initial state, pos32 is clear? Wait, no. Wait, the original state says "stone1 is at location pos32" and "Location pos32 is clear". Wait, that's a contradiction. Or maybe "clear" means there's nothing else there? Because the stone is there. Hmm. Wait, no. The problem says "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So a location is clear if it doesn't have the agent or a stone. But in the initial state, pos32 has stone1, so how is it clear? That must be a mistake. Wait, looking back: the original state includes "stone1 is at location pos32" and "Location pos32 is clear". That can't be right. Maybe it's a typo. Wait, maybe the initial state lists "Location pos32 is clear" but stone1 is there. That's conflicting. So perhaps the user made a mistake here. Or maybe "clear" refers to the agent not being there. Wait, the problem says "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So a location is clear if it's empty. So if a stone is there, the location is not clear. Therefore, the initial state says pos32 is clear, but stone1 is there. That's conflicting. That's a problem. But maybe it's a typo in the problem statement. Let me check again.

Original state:

"stone1 is at location pos32"

"Location pos32 is clear"

But if a stone is at pos32, then pos32 is not clear. So that's a contradiction. So perhaps the correct initial state is that pos32 is not clear, but in the given problem, it's listed as clear. That's an error. Hmm. But maybe in the problem's original state, the user intended that the stone is at pos32 but the location is considered clear? That doesn't make sense. So maybe it's a mistake. Wait, maybe the user intended that the agent is not there. Because "clear" could mean that the agent is not present. But according to the problem description, a location can have the agent, a stone, or be empty. So if a stone is present, the location is not empty. So if a stone is at pos32, then pos32 is not clear. Therefore, the original state has an inconsistency. But perhaps the correct information is that pos32 has the stone, so it's not clear. But according to the problem's original state, "Location pos32 is clear" is listed. So maybe that's a mistake. This is a problem because it affects the preconditions of actions.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement lists "Location pos32 is clear" but that's a mistake. Because the stone is there. So the actual state is that pos32 is occupied by stone1, so it's not clear. Therefore, when the agent wants to move to pos32, it can't because it's occupied by the stone. So the agent needs to approach the stone from another direction to push it.

But given the initial state as described, the agent is at pos42, stone1 is at pos32. The agent can move to pos32 if it's clear. But according to the problem's original state, pos32 is clear. So that's possible. But if the stone is at pos32 and the location is clear, then that's conflicting. So perhaps there's an error here. But regardless, I need to proceed with the given information.

Assuming that the initial state is correctly given (even if contradictory), then pos32 is clear and has stone1. But that's impossible. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a typo. Let me check again the original state:

Original state includes:

- "stone1 is at location pos32"

- "Location pos32 is clear"

So according to the problem, pos32 is clear despite having a stone. That's a conflict. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake. But since the problem is given as such, I have to work with that. But logically, if a location has a stone, it's not clear. Therefore, maybe the "Location pos32 is clear" in the original state is a mistake, and the stone is actually at pos32, making it not clear. Therefore, the agent can't move into pos32 because the stone is there. So the agent needs to approach the stone from an adjacent tile to push it.

But given the initial state as stated, the agent is at pos42. Let me look at the movement possibilities. From pos42, the agent can move to pos32 (left), but if pos32 is clear, then the agent can move there. But if the stone is there, then pos32 isn't clear, so the agent can't move there. So this is a crucial point.

Wait, perhaps the movement actions are allowed to move into a location if it's clear (i.e., no agent or stone). So if the stone is at pos32, then pos32 is not clear, so the agent can't move there. Therefore, the agent can't directly move to pos32. So the agent needs to go around.

But according to the original state, the stone is at pos32, and pos32 is clear. That's conflicting, so this is a problem. But perhaps the user intended that pos32 is not clear. Let me check the original state again. Under the original state:

The user lists "Location pos32 is clear" and "stone1 is at location pos32". So this is impossible. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. But I need to proceed with the given information.

Assuming that pos32 is clear (despite the stone being there), then the agent can move into pos32. But that's illogical. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in listing the initial state. For example, maybe the stone is at pos33, but that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the stone is at pos32, but pos32 is not clear. Therefore, the agent can't move there.

But given that the problem states both, I have to resolve this. Perhaps the "clear" in the original state refers to the agent not being present, but a stone can be present. So "clear" means the agent is not there. Then, a location can have a stone and still be clear (for the agent's movement). But according to the problem description, "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So a location is clear if it's empty. Therefore, if a stone is present, the location is not clear. Therefore, the original state has a contradiction. This is a problem, but perhaps the correct initial state is that pos32 is not clear (since the stone is there). Therefore, the agent can't move into pos32. Therefore, the agent needs to move to a position adjacent to the stone to push it.

In that case, the agent is at pos42. The stone is at pos32. The agent can move to pos32 only if it's clear. If it's not clear (because the stone is there), then the agent can't. So the agent needs to go to a position adjacent to the stone. Let's look at the possible directions. The stone is at pos32. The adjacent positions are pos22 (up), pos31 (left?), pos33 (down?), pos42 (right?), depending on the grid layout.

Wait, the grid is 5x5, with positions pos11 (row 1, column 1), pos12 (row 1, column 2), etc. So pos32 is row 3, column 2. The adjacent positions would be pos22 (up), pos31 (left), pos33 (right), pos42 (down). Wait, no. Let me clarify the directions. The movement actions have directions: dirup, dirdown, dirleft, dirright. For example, from pos32, moving dirup would go to pos22 (row 2, column 2). Moving dirleft would go to pos31 (row 3, column 1). Moving dirright would go to pos33 (row 3, column 3). Moving dirdown would go to pos42 (row 4, column 2). So the stone is at pos32. The agent is at pos42 (row4, column2). To reach the stone, the agent is currently at pos42, which is directly below pos32. So the agent can move up to pos32 if possible. But if pos32 is occupied by the stone, then pos32 is not clear, so the agent can't move there. Therefore, the agent needs to approach from another direction. But wait, if the agent is at pos42, which is directly below pos32, then to push the stone up (dirup) from pos32 to pos22, the agent would need to be at pos32. But if the agent can't move into pos32, then how?

Alternatively, the agent can go to pos33 (to the right of the stone) and push it left. Or pos31 (to the left) and push it right. But to do that, the agent needs to reach those positions. Let's see.

The agent is at pos42. To reach pos33, the path would be: pos42 → pos43 (down direction?), but wait, the movement from pos42 is possible. Let me check the movement possibilities:

From pos42, according to the given movement possibilities:

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos52 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos41 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown"

Wait, movement from pos42 to pos32 is direction dirleft. Because pos42 is row4, column2. pos32 is row3, column2. So moving up (dirup) would go from pos42 to pos32? Or direction dirleft? Wait, the movement directions may not align with the grid directions. Because the movement directions are defined in the problem's movement connections. So according to the problem's list:

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"

So moving from pos42 to pos32 is direction dirleft. That's a bit confusing, but according to the problem's movement graph, moving from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft. So the agent is at pos42. To get to pos32, direction dirleft. But if pos32 is not clear (because the stone is there), then the agent can't move there. But according to the original state, pos32 is clear. So maybe the problem allows that. But that's conflicting. So perhaps the problem has an error here. But given that the original state says pos32 is clear, the agent can move there. But if the stone is there, then pos32 is not clear. So this is a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the user intended that the stone is at pos32, making pos32 not clear. But the original state says it's clear. So I'm stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe "clear" refers to the agent not being present. So a location is clear if the agent isn't there, regardless of stones. So a location can have a stone and be considered clear. Then, the agent can move into a location with a stone. But according to the problem description, a location can contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. So if a stone is present, the location is not empty. Therefore, "clear" must mean empty. Therefore, pos32 is not clear in the initial state, but the problem says it is. That's a mistake.

Given this confusion, perhaps the best approach is to proceed under the assumption that the stone is at pos32 and the location is not clear, despite the problem's assertion. Therefore, the agent cannot move into pos32. So the agent must approach the stone from another direction.

The agent is at pos42. The stone is at pos32. The agent needs to get to a position adjacent to the stone to push it. Let's look at the adjacent locations to pos32:

pos22 (up), pos31 (left), pos33 (right), pos42 (down). 

The agent is at pos42 (down from pos32). So the agent is already adjacent to the stone (since pos32 is up from pos42). Wait, according to the movement possibilities, moving from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft. So pos32 is to the left of pos42? That would mean the grid is arranged such that moving left from pos42 (row4, column2) would take you to pos32 (row3, column2), but that's a different row. That seems inconsistent. Wait, perhaps the movement directions are not aligned with the grid in the way I thought. Let me re-examine the movement connections.

For example, looking at pos32's movement options:

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft"

Wait, pos32 to pos22 is dirleft. So if pos32 is in row3, column2, moving left (dirleft) would go to pos22 (row2, column2). So that's moving up a row. That's inconsistent with typical left/right directions. Therefore, the movement directions in this problem are such that dirleft and dirright may correspond to moving up and down rows, and dirdown and dirup correspond to columns. Hmm, perhaps the movement directions are not standard. This complicates things. Let's try to map the grid.

Alternatively, perhaps the movement directions are such that dirleft and dirright correspond to moving left and right along the same row, and dirup and dirdown correspond to moving up and down columns. For example, pos11 is row1, column1. pos12 is row1, column2. So moving dirdown from pos11 would go to pos12 (since it's the next column?), but according to the movement list, "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright". Wait, pos11 to pos21 is direction dirright. pos21 is row2, column1. So dirright here moves down a row. That's confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the grid is structured such that each position's name is posXY where X is the row and Y is the column. So pos11 is row1, column1. pos12 is row1, column2. pos21 is row2, column1, etc. Then, moving dirright from pos11 would take you to pos12 (same row, next column). But according to the movement list, "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright". That would mean moving dirright from pos11 (row1, column1) takes you to pos21 (row2, column1), which is moving down a row. That's unexpected. So the directions are not aligned with the grid in the usual way. Therefore, the movement directions are as defined in the problem's movement list, which may not correspond to the typical cardinal directions.

This is a bit tricky. So the directions are just labels, and the actual connections between locations are as listed. Therefore, I need to refer to the movement connections provided.

For example, from pos42, the possible moves are:

- move to pos32 via dirleft

- move to pos52 via dirright

- move to pos41 via dirup

- move to pos43 via dirdown

So pos42 is connected to pos32 (dirleft), pos52 (dirright), pos41 (dirup), and pos43 (dirdown). So dirleft from pos42 leads to pos32, which is up one row (from row4 to row3), same column. So direction dirleft here corresponds to moving up a row. Similarly, dirright from pos42 leads to pos52, which is row5, column2. So dirright from pos42 moves down a row. So directions are perhaps misnamed. So in this problem, dirleft and dirright correspond to moving up and down rows, and dirup and dirdown correspond to moving left and right in columns. That's possible but confusing. 

Alternatively, perhaps the movement directions are based on the grid's orientation. For example, moving dirright from a position might take you to the next column in the same row, but according to the given movement list, that's not the case. Therefore, I need to ignore the naming and just follow the movement connections as given.

Given that, the agent is at pos42. To reach the stone at pos32, the agent can move dirleft to pos32. But if pos32 is clear, which the problem says it is, then the agent can move there. But if pos32 has the stone, then it's not clear. But the problem says pos32 is clear. So this is a contradiction. Assuming that pos32 is clear (despite the stone being there), the agent can move there. Once there, the agent can push the stone. But this is illogical. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a mistake. But I need to proceed.

Assuming the agent can move to pos32 (since it's clear), then the agent can perform a push action. But since the stone is already at pos32, which is the agent's destination, moving there would require the stone to not be there. So this is a problem. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem's initial state. Given that, perhaps the correct initial state is that pos32 is not clear, and the agent cannot move there. Therefore, the agent needs to find another way to reach the stone.

Alternatively, perhaps the stone is at pos33, but the problem states pos32. Alternatively, maybe the initial state has a typo. But since the problem states the stone is at pos32 and pos32 is clear, I have to work with that.

Assuming pos32 is clear, the agent can move from pos42 to pos32 via dirleft. Then, the agent is at pos32. But the stone is also at pos32. That's impossible. So this is conflicting. Therefore, the problem's initial state must have a mistake. Without knowing the correct initial state, it's hard to proceed. But given the problem as stated, perhaps the stone is at pos32, which is not a goal location, and pos13 is the only goal. The agent needs to move the stone to pos13.

But how? Let's consider possible paths.

First, the agent needs to get to a position adjacent to the stone to push it. But the stone is at pos32. The agent is at pos42. Let's see the possible directions to push the stone.

The agent can push the stone if the agent is in a location adjacent to the stone in the direction of the push.

For example, to push the stone upwards (dirup), the agent needs to be south of the stone (pos32) and push it north. Wait, but according to the movement connections, from pos32, moving dirup would take you to pos22. So if the agent is at pos32, to push the stone to pos22, the agent must be at pos32 and the stone is also at pos32. Which is impossible. Therefore, the agent needs to be at a location adjacent to the stone in the direction opposite to the desired push direction.

Wait, the push actions require the agent to be at a location adjacent to the stone. For example, to push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (dirup), the agent must be at pos32 (but that's where the stone is). So that's not possible. Alternatively, the agent must be at a location that is adjacent to the stone's current position in the direction of the push. For example, to push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (dirup), the agent must be south of the stone (pos42) and push north. But according to the movement connections, moving from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft. So the agent is at pos32 after moving dirleft from pos42. Then, the agent is at pos32. To push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (dirup), the agent would need to be at pos32 (l_p = pos32), l_from = pos32, l_to = pos22, direction d = dirup. But the preconditions for pushtogoal or pushtonongoal require that the agent is at l_p, which must be adjacent to l_from (the stone's current location) in the direction d. So for pushing the stone from pos32 to pos22 (direction dirup), the agent must be at a location that is reachable from pos32 via direction dirup. Wait, no. The preconditions for pushtogoal are:

(iv) you can get from location l_p to l_from following direction d.

(v) you can get from l_from to l_to following direction d.

So for the agent to push the stone from l_from to l_to in direction d, the agent must be at l_p, which is in the direction opposite to d from l_from. Because to push, the agent is behind the stone. For example, if the agent is south of the stone (pos42), and wants to push it north (dirup to pos22), then the agent's location l_p is pos32, the stone is at l_from pos32, and l_to is pos22. But that would require the agent to be at pos32, which is where the stone is. So that's impossible. Therefore, perhaps the directions are different.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can be at l_p which is adjacent to l_from in the direction d. For example, to push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (dirup), the agent must be at l_p, which is pos32, but that's where the stone is. That's not possible. Therefore, maybe the agent has to be at a position adjacent to the stone in a direction that allows pushing.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the push actions. Let's re-examine the preconditions for "pushtogoal":

(iv) you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d.

So the agent is at l_p, and moving in direction d from l_p leads to l_from (the stone's location). Then, moving in direction d from l_from leads to l_to. So the agent is at l_p, which is one step behind the stone in direction d. For example, if the stone is at l_from, the agent is at l_p, and to push the stone to l_to (in direction d), the agent moves from l_p to l_from (direction d), pushing the stone to l_to.

So, in this scenario, the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to the stone (l_from) in direction d. Then, the stone is pushed to l_to, which is adjacent to l_from in direction d.

So for example, to push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (direction dirup), the agent needs to be at l_p = pos42, l_from = pos32, l_to = pos22, d = dirup. Wait, but can the agent move from pos42 to pos32 following direction dirup? Let's check the movement connections.

Looking at the movement list: "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft". So the direction from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft, not dirup. Therefore, to satisfy precondition (iv) of pushtogoal, the agent must be at l_p (pos42), and moving in direction dirleft would take them to l_from (pos32). Then, moving from l_from (pos32) in direction dirup would take them to pos22. So the direction d for the push would be dirup. But then, the agent's movement direction (dirleft) and the stone's movement direction (dirup) are different. But according to the preconditions, the agent must move in direction d to reach the stone, and the stone must move in direction d to reach l_to. So in this case, d would have to be the same direction for both the agent's movement to the stone and the stone's movement to l_to. So this is a problem.

Wait, the preconditions for pushtogoal:

(iv) you can get from location l_p to l_from following direction d.

(v) you can get from location l_from to l_to following direction d.

So both movements must be in the same direction d. Therefore, the agent must be at a location l_p such that moving in direction d from l_p leads to l_from, and moving in direction d from l_from leads to l_to.

Therefore, in the case of pushing the stone from pos32 to pos22, the direction d must be such that from l_p, moving d leads to pos32, and from pos32, moving d leads to pos22. Looking at the movement connections from pos32:

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos31 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown"

Wait, according to the movement list, from pos32, moving dirleft leads to pos22. So if the agent is at pos32's dirleft direction, which would be pos22, but that's where the stone is being pushed to. So no, the agent needs to be behind the stone. For example, to push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft), the agent must be at a location l_p from which moving dirleft leads to pos32. Looking at the movement list, which locations can move to pos32 via dirleft?

Looking at the movement list, the only entry that allows moving to pos32 via dirleft is:

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"

So l_p would be pos42, direction d is dirleft. Then, from pos32, moving dirleft leads to pos22. So yes. So the agent is at pos42, direction dirleft. So the push action would be:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft

But wait, pos22 is not a goal location. The only goal location is pos13. So pushing the stone to pos22 doesn't help. We need to get the stone to pos13.

So the agent needs to push the stone from pos32 to pos22, then further to pos13.

But pos22 is not a goal location. So the agent needs to push the stone along a path towards pos13.

Let's outline the path. The stone is at pos32. The goal is pos13. The grid is 5x5. So possible path from pos32 to pos13:

pos32 → pos22 → pos23 → pos13 (but pos23 to pos13 is possible? Let's check the movement connections.

From pos23, you can move to pos13 via dirleft. So pushing the stone from pos23 to pos13 would require the agent to be at pos23's dirleft direction, which is pos13's direction. Wait, no. Let's see:

For example, to push the stone from pos23 to pos13, the agent must be at a location l_p such that moving direction d from l_p leads to pos23, and moving direction d from pos23 leads to pos13. Looking at the movement connections from pos23:

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirleft"

So direction d would be dirleft. So the agent must be at a location l_p from which moving dirleft leads to pos23. Looking at the movement list, which locations can move to pos23 via dirleft?

Looking for entries where moving dirleft leads to pos23. For example:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"

So pos33 can move to pos23 via dirleft. Therefore, to push the stone from pos23 to pos13, the agent must be at pos33 and push dirleft.

But first, the stone needs to get to pos23. So initial steps:

1. Agent moves from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft) – but if pos32 is clear. Wait, pos32 has the stone, so it's not clear. Therefore, this is impossible. So the agent can't move to pos32.

So the agent must find another way to approach the stone. Since pos32 is occupied by the stone, the agent can't move there. Therefore, the agent needs to approach from another direction.

The stone is at pos32. The agent is at pos42. The agent can move to pos43 (dirdown from pos42), then to pos33 (dirleft from pos43?), but let's check the movement connections.

From pos42, the agent can move to pos43 via dirdown. Then, from pos43, the agent can move to pos33 via dirleft? Let's check:

Looking at movement from pos43:

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"

Yes. So agent can move pos42 → pos43 (dirdown), then pos43 → pos33 (dirleft). From pos33, the agent is adjacent to pos32 (dirleft). Wait, from pos33, moving dirleft leads to pos23. Wait, the movement from pos33 is:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown"

So from pos33, moving dirup leads to pos32. So the agent can move from pos33 to pos32 via dirup. But if pos32 is occupied by the stone, then the agent can't move there. Therefore, the agent can't reach pos32 directly. But the agent is at pos33. To push the stone from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown), the agent would need to be at pos32 (since moving dirdown from pos32 leads to pos33). But the agent can't be at pos32 because the stone is there.

Alternatively, the agent can push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft). To do that, the agent needs to be at pos32's dirleft direction's source location. Wait, the push action requires the agent to be at l_p, from which moving direction d leads to l_from (the stone's current location). So for pushing from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft), the agent must be at a location l_p where moving dirleft leads to pos32. Looking at the movement list, which locations can move to pos32 via dirleft?

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"

So pos42 is the only location that can move to pos32 via dirleft. Therefore, the agent must be at pos42 to push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft). But pos42 is the agent's starting position. So if the agent is at pos42, can they push the stone?

Yes. The preconditions for pushtonongoal (since pos22 is not a goal location) are:

(i) agent is at pos42 (l_p = pos42)

(ii) stone is at pos32 (l_from = pos32)

(iii) pos22 (l_to) is clear.

(iv) can move from pos42 to pos32 via d (dirleft)

(v) can move from pos32 to pos22 via d (dirleft)

(vi) pos22 is not a goal location (which is true).

So check if pos22 is clear. According to the original state, pos22 is clear. Yes. So the agent can perform:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft

After this action, the agent moves to pos32, the stone moves to pos22. Then, the stone is at pos22, which is not a goal. Then, the agent needs to push it further.

Next, push from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown?), but pos23 is not a goal. Wait, the goal is pos13. So the stone needs to go from pos22 to pos12, then to pos13. But pos12 is not a goal, but pos13 is. Let's see.

From pos22, the stone can be pushed to pos12 (dirleft), then to pos13 (dirdown). But pos12 is not a goal, pos13 is.

So the steps would be:

1. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft) using pushtonongoal.

2. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos12 (dirleft) using pushtonongoal.

3. Push stone1 from pos12 to pos13 (dirdown) using pushtogoal.

But need to check if each step is possible.

First step: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft. This is possible because:

- agent is at pos42 (initial position).

- stone is at pos32.

- pos22 is clear.

- movement from pos42 to pos32 via dirleft is allowed.

- movement from pos32 to pos22 via dirleft is allowed.

- pos22 is not a goal.

After this action, the agent is at pos32, stone is at pos22, pos42 becomes clear.

Next, the agent is at pos32. Now, they need to push the stone from pos22 to pos12. To do that, the agent must be at a location l_p from which moving dirleft leads to pos22. Looking at the movement list:

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft"

Wait, pos32 can move to pos22 via dirleft. So the agent is currently at pos32. So the agent can push the stone from pos22 to pos12 via dirleft.

But the stone is at pos22. So the agent needs to be at pos32 (l_p = pos32), l_from = pos22, l_to = pos12, d = dirleft. But can the agent move from pos32 to pos22 via dirleft? Yes. So the preconditions are:

(i) agent is at pos32.

(ii) stone is at pos22.

(iii) pos12 is clear.

(iv) agent can move from pos32 to pos22 via dirleft.

(v) stone can move from pos22 to pos12 via dirleft.

(vi) pos12 is not a goal (it is not; pos13 is the goal).

So the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft

After this, the agent moves to pos22, stone moves to pos12.

Next, the stone is at pos12. The agent is at pos22. Now, to push the stone to pos13 (which is a goal), the agent needs to push it dirdown from pos12 to pos13. The preconditions for pushtogoal:

(i) agent is at l_p, which must be adjacent to pos12 in direction dirdown.

From pos12, moving dirdown leads to pos13. So the agent must be at a location l_p from which moving dirdown leads to pos12. Looking at the movement list:

"You may move from location pos12 to location pos22 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos12 to location pos11 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos12 to location pos13 following direction dirdown"

So the agent needs to be at a location that can move to pos12 via dirdown. But pos12's movement connections don't include any location moving to it via dirdown. Wait, the movement directions are as listed. For example, pos11 can move to pos12 via dirdown. So if the agent is at pos11, moving dirdown leads to pos12. So the agent needs to be at pos11 to push the stone from pos12 to pos13 (dirdown).

But currently, the agent is at pos22. How to get to pos11?

Path from pos22 to pos11:

pos22 → pos12 (dirleft), then pos12 → pos11 (dirup).

But after the second push action, the agent is at pos22. Let's see:

After pushing from pos22 to pos12, the agent is at pos22 (l_p = pos32, but after pushing, the agent moves to pos22? Wait, no. Let's look at the effects of pushtonongoal:

After performing pushtonongoal, the agent is no longer at l_p (pos32), and moves to l_from (pos22). So after the second action, the agent is at pos22. The stone is at pos12.

Now, to push the stone from pos12 to pos13 (dirdown), the agent needs to be at a location l_p from which moving dirdown leads to pos12. Looking at the movement list, pos11 can move to pos12 via dirdown. So the agent must be at pos11.

But how to get from pos22 to pos11?

Possible path: pos22 → pos12 (dirleft), then pos12 → pos11 (dirup).

But the agent is at pos22. Can move to pos12 via dirleft (if pos12 is clear). After the stone is at pos12, pos12 is not clear (stone is there). So the agent can't move into pos12. Therefore, the agent needs to find another path.

Alternative path: pos22 → pos21 (dirup), pos21 → pos11 (dirleft). Let's check:

From pos22, movement options:

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos32 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos21 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos23 following direction dirdown"

So the agent can move from pos22 to pos21 via dirup. Then from pos21 to pos11 via dirleft.

Yes. So:

Action: move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup

Then:

Action: move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft

Now the agent is at pos11. From here, they can push the stone from pos12 to pos13 (dirdown).

Check preconditions for pushtogoal:

(i) agent is at pos11 (l_p = pos11)

(ii) stone is at pos12 (l_from = pos12)

(iii) pos13 is clear (original state says pos13 is a goal location, but is it clear? Initially, pos13 is clear. After previous actions, the stone was pushed to pos12, so pos13 should still be clear.

(iv) agent can move from pos11 to pos12 via dirdown.

(v) stone can move from pos12 to pos13 via dirdown.

(vi) pos13 is a goal location.

Yes. So the action would be:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown

This would move the stone to pos13, which is a goal location.

So the complete plan would be:

1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft

2. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft

Wait, no. After the first push, the agent is at pos32 → no. Let's correct this.

Wait, after the first action:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft

Effects:

- agent is no longer at pos42 (now at pos32?)

Wait, no. The effect of pushtonongoal is:

(i) agent p is no longer at l_p (pos42)

(ii) stone s is no longer at l_from (pos32)

(iii) l_to (pos22) is no longer clear

(iv) agent p is at l_from (pos32)

(v) stone s is at l_to (pos22)

So after the first action, the agent is at pos32, stone is at pos22.

Then, the second action is to push from pos22 to pos12. The agent is at pos32. To push from pos22 to pos12, the agent must be at a location l_p that can move to pos22 via dirleft. Which location can do that?

From the movement list:

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft"

So the agent is at pos32 (current location after first action). So l_p is pos32, l_from is pos22, l_to is pos12, d is dirleft.

So the action is:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft

Preconditions:

(i) agent is at pos32.

(ii) stone is at pos22.

(iii) pos12 is clear. Initially, yes. After first action, pos12's status? The stone was at pos32, then moved to pos22. pos12 was initially clear. So yes.

(iv) can move from pos32 to pos22 via dirleft. Yes.

(v) can move from pos22 to pos12 via dirleft. Yes.

(vi) pos12 is not a goal. Correct.

After this action:

- agent moves to pos22.

- stone moves to pos12.

Now, agent is at pos22. To get to pos11 to push the stone to pos13:

Actions needed:

3. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup

4. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft

5. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown

So total steps:

1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft

2. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft

3. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup

4. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft

5. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown

Is this the shortest path? Let's see if there's a shorter way.

Alternative: After step 2, the agent is at pos22. Maybe there's a way to reach pos11 faster. But from pos22, the agent can go to pos21 (dirup), then pos11 (dirleft). That's two moves. Then push. So steps 3,4,5 are necessary.

Alternatively, can the agent push the stone from pos12 to pos13 without going to pos11? Let's see. The stone is at pos12. To push to pos13 (dirdown), the agent needs to be at a location that can move to pos12 via dirdown. Which location is that?

Looking at movement to pos12 via dirdown: from pos11 to pos12 via dirdown. So agent must be at pos11.

So no other way. So steps 3-5 are necessary.

Total of 5 actions. Is there a shorter plan?

Alternatively, after step 2, the agent is at pos22. Could they move to pos12 via dirleft? But pos12 has the stone, so it's not clear. So agent can't move there. So the path via pos21 and pos11 is the only way.

Thus, the plan of 5 actions seems optimal.
