Let me analyze this problem step by step. 

First, I need to understand the initial state and the goal:
- Initial state:
  - player1 is at pos42
  - stone1 is at pos32
  - pos13 is a goal location

- Goal: stone1 is at a goal location (i.e., stone1 is at pos13)

So I need to move stone1 from pos32 to pos13, which is the only goal location mentioned.

Now, let's consider the constraints:
1. "Location pos13 is not clear" must hold in at least one state
2. If "Location pos13 is not clear" holds, then earlier either "Location pos14 is not clear" or "player1 is at location pos55" must be true
3. "player1 is at location pos12" must hold in at least one state
4. If "player1 is at location pos12" holds, then earlier either "Location pos13 is not clear" or "Location pos14 is not clear" must be true
5. player1 cannot be at location pos11 in any state
6. "Location pos11 is not clear" can only hold in at most one continuous sequence of states
7. "player1 is at location pos41" must hold in at least one state
8. "Location pos22 is not clear" must hold in at least one state
9. If "Location pos22 is not clear" holds, then earlier either "Location pos33 is not clear" or "stone1 is at location pos41" must be true
10. Either "Location pos33 is not clear" or "player1 is at location pos34" must hold in at least one state
11. Either "Location pos34 is not clear" or "Location pos25 is not clear" must hold in at least one state
12. stone1 cannot be at location pos12 in any state
13. Either "stone1 is at location pos41" or "Location pos52 is not clear" must hold in at least one state

These constraints form a complex set of requirements for any valid plan.

Let me visualize the grid to better understand the problem:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
2 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
3 [ ][S][ ][ ][ ]
4 [ ][P][ ][ ][ ]
5 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
```

Where 'P' is player1 (pos42) and 'S' is stone1 (pos32). The goal is at pos13, which is marked with an 'G'. I need to plan a sequence of moves to push stone1 to pos13.

I'm thinking about the constraints and how they affect my plan:
- I need to pass through pos41 at some point
- I need stone1 to be at pos41 or make pos52 not clear at some point
- I need pos22 to be not clear at some point
- I need to visit pos12 at some point
- I cannot be at pos11 at any point
- I cannot push stone1 to pos12 at any point
- And several other ordering constraints...

Let me try to outline a plan that satisfies these constraints:

1. First, I need to get behind stone1 to push it. From pos42, I can move to pos41, then pos31, and to pos22.
2. From pos22, I can push stone1 from pos32 to pos31.
3. From pos31, I can push stone1 to pos21, then to pos22, and so on, moving around the grid.
4. Eventually, I need to get stone1 to pos13, which is the goal.

But I need to ensure I satisfy all constraints. Let me work through the plan more carefully.

Starting with the initial state:
- player1 at pos42
- stone1 at pos32

Now, let's try to develop a plan:

1. Move player1 from pos42 to pos41 (satisfying constraint 7)
2. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31
3. Move player1 from pos31 to pos21
4. Move player1 from pos21 to pos22
5. Now player1 is at pos22 and can push stone1 from pos32 to pos31
6. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos31 (pushtonongoal)
7. Now stone1 is at pos31 and player1 is at pos32
8. Move player1 from pos32 to pos22
9. Move player1 from pos22 to pos21
10. Push stone1 from pos31 to pos21 (pushtonongoal)
11. Now stone1 is at pos21 and player1 is at pos31
12. Move player1 from pos31 to pos32
13. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33
14. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23
15. Move player1 from pos23 to pos22
16. Push stone1 from pos21 to pos11 (pushtonongoal)
   - This should work, but constraint 5 says player1 cannot be at pos11.
   - So I need to rethink this approach.

Let me approach this differently. Looking at constraints:
- I need stone1 to be at pos41 or pos52 not clear at some point (constraint 13)
- I need pos22 to be not clear at some point (constraint 8)

Maybe I should push stone1 east and then south towards pos13?

Starting again:

1. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32 (up)
2. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (down)
3. Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 (right)
4. Move player1 from pos43 to pos42 (up)
5. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos22 (pushtonongoal, left)
6. Now stone1 is at pos22 (satisfying constraint 8) and player1 is at pos32
7. Move player1 from pos32 to pos42 (right)
8. Move player1 from pos42 to pos41 (up) (satisfying constraint 7)
9. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 (left)
10. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos21 (pushtonongoal, up)
11. Now stone1 is at pos21 and player1 is at pos22
12. Move player1 from pos22 to pos23 (down)
13. Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 (left)
14. Move player1 from pos13 to pos12 (up) (satisfying constraint 3)
15. Move player1 from pos12 to pos22 (right)
16. Push stone1 from pos21 to pos11 (pushtonongoal, up)
   - Again, constraint 5 says player1 cannot be at pos11.

Hmm, it seems challenging to satisfy all constraints. Let me step back and reconsider.

Maybe I need to push stone1 all the way down to pos13?

Starting again:

1. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (down)
2. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (left)
3. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (left)
4. Move player1 from pos23 to pos22 (up)
5. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (right)
6. Now player1 is at pos32 and can push stone1 from pos32 to pos22 (pushtonongoal)
7. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos22 (pushtonongoal, left)
8. Now stone1 is at pos22 (satisfying constraint 8) and player1 is at pos32
9. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (down)
10. Move player1 from pos33 to pos34 (down) (satisfying constraint 10)
11. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24 (left)
12. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23 (up)
13. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos23 (pushtonongoal, down)
14. Move player1 from pos22 to pos12 (left)
15. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos13 (pushtogoal, left)
16. Now stone1 is at pos13 and player1 is at pos23

Wait, this plan doesn't satisfy constraint 2, which says if "Location pos13 is not clear" holds, then earlier either "Location pos14 is not clear" or "player1 is at location pos55" must be true. And constraint 4 says if "player1 is at location pos12" holds, then earlier either "Location pos13 is not clear" or "Location pos14 is not clear" must be true.

Let me rethink and try another approach.

Ok, let's be more methodical. First, I'll list the sequence of locations stone1 needs to be at to get from pos32 to pos13:
- pos32 (initial)
- pos22
- pos23
- pos13 (goal)

And for each step, I need to position player1 properly to push the stone.

Now, let's incorporate the constraints:
- Constraint 7: player1 must be at pos41 at some point
- Constraint 13: stone1 must be at pos41 or pos52 must not be clear at some point
- Constraint 8: pos22 must not be clear at some point (satisfied when stone1 is at pos22)
- Constraint 3: player1 must be at pos12 at some point
- Constraint 2: Before "Location pos13 is not clear", either "Location pos14 is not clear" or "player1 is at location pos55" must be true
- Constraint 4: Before "player1 is at location pos12", either "Location pos13 is not clear" or "Location pos14 is not clear" must be true

Given these constraints, maybe I need to:
1. Move stone1 to pos41 (satisfying constraint 13)
2. Move stone1 to pos22 (satisfying constraint 8)
3. Move stone1 to pos23
4. Before pushing stone1 to pos13, ensure "Location pos14 is not clear" or "player1 is at location pos55" (for constraint 2)
5. Push stone1 to pos13
6. Move player1 to pos12 after pos13 is not clear (satisfying constraints 3 and 4)

Let me now try to build a complete plan.

Ok, I realize it's very challenging to find a plan that satisfies all constraints manually. Let me focus on the key movements and then I'll fill in the details.

From the constraints, I notice:
- Constraint 2 says before pos13 is not clear, either pos14 is not clear or player1 is at pos55
- Constraint 4 says before player1 is at pos12, either pos13 is not clear or pos14 is not clear
- Constraint 10 says player1 must be at pos34 or pos33 must not be clear at some point
- Constraint 11 says either pos34 or pos25 must not be clear at some point

Given these, a potential sequence would be:
1. Move stone1 to clear pos32
2. Position player1 at pos41 (satisfying constraint 7) and make pos52 not clear at some point (satisfying constraint 13)
3. Move stone1 to pos22 (satisfying constraint 8) and later to pos23
4. Make pos14 not clear, then push stone1 to pos13
5. Move player1 to pos12 (satisfying constraint 3) after pos13 is not clear (satisfying constraint 4)

Let me try to flesh this out step by step:

Starting state:
- player1 at pos42
- stone1 at pos32

1. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32 (left)
   - This doesn't work because stone1 is at pos32. Let me rethink.

1. Move player1 from pos42 to pos52 (right)
2. Move player1 from pos52 to pos51 (up)
3. Move player1 from pos51 to pos41 (left) (satisfying constraint 7)
4. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 (left)
5. Move player1 from pos31 to pos21 (left)
6. Move player1 from pos21 to pos22 (down)
7. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (right)
8. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (pushtonongoal, down)
9. Move player1 from pos32 to pos42 (right)
10. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (down)
11. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos43 (pushtonongoal, right)
12. Move player1 from pos33 to pos34 (down) (satisfying constraint 10)
13. Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 (right)
14. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos53 (pushtonongoal, right)
15. Move player1 from pos43 to pos42 (up)
16. Move player1 from pos42 to pos52 (right)
17. Push stone1 from pos53 to pos52 (pushtonongoal, up)
18. Move player1 from pos53 to pos43 (left)
19. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (left)
20. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (left)
21. Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 (left)
22. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14 (down)
23. Move player1 from pos14 to pos24 (right)
24. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 (right)
25. Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 (right)
26. Move player1 from pos44 to pos54 (right)
27. Move player1 from pos54 to pos55 (down) (positioning for constraint 2)
28. Move player1 from pos55 to pos54 (up)
29. Move player1 from pos54 to pos44 (left)
30. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43 (up)
31. Move player1 from pos43 to pos42 (up)
32. Push stone1 from pos52 to pos42 (pushtonongoal, left)
33. Move player1 from pos52 to pos51 (up)
34. Move player1 from pos51 to pos41 (left)
35. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos32 (pushtonongoal, up)
36. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (down)
37. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (left)
38. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos22 (pushtonongoal, left) (satisfying constraint 8)
39. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (down)
40. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (left)
41. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos23 (pushtonongoal, down)
42. Move player1 from pos22 to pos12 (left) (satisfying constraint 3)
43. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos13 (pushtogoal, left)
44. Goal achieved: stone1 is at pos13 (a goal location)

But I realized I forgot about constraint 9, which says before pos22 is not clear, either pos33 is not clear or stone1 is at pos41. Let me adjust the plan.

Starting again:

1. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32 (left)
2. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos22 (pushtonongoal, left) (making pos22 not clear, satisfying constraint 8)
   But this violates constraint 9, which says before pos22 is not clear, either pos33 is not clear or stone1 is at pos41.

So maybe I need to position stone1 at pos41 first, then move it to pos22. Let's try again:

Starting state:
- player1 at pos42
- stone1 at pos32

1. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32 (left)
2. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (pushtonongoal, down)
3. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (down)
4. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos43 (pushtonongoal, right)
5. Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 (right)
6. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos42 (pushtonongoal, up)
7. Move player1 from pos43 to pos42 (up)
8. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos41 (pushtonongoal, up) (now stone1 is at pos41, satisfying constraint 13 and setting up for constraint 9)
9. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (down)
10. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (left)
11. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (left)
12. Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 (left)
13. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14 (down)
14. Move player1 from pos14 to pos24 (right)
15. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 (right) (satisfying constraint 10)
16. Move player1 from pos34 to pos35 (down)
17. Move player1 from pos35 to pos25 (left)
18. Move player1 from pos25 to pos15 (left)
19. Move player1 from pos15 to pos14 (up) (making pos14 not clear, needed for constraint 2)
20. Move player1 from pos14 to pos24 (right)
21. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 (right)
22. Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 (right)
23. Move player1 from pos44 to pos54 (right)
24. Move player1 from pos54 to pos55 (down) (satisfying constraint 2, positioning for the push to pos13)
25. Move player1 from pos55 to pos45 (left)
26. Move player1 from pos45 to pos35 (left)
27. Move player1 from pos35 to pos25 (left)
28. Move player1 from pos25 to pos24 (up)
29. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23 (up)
30. Move player1 from pos23 to pos22 (up)
31. Move player1 from pos22 to pos21 (up)
32. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (right)
33. Push stone1 from pos41 to pos31 (pushtonongoal, left)
34. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 (left)
35. Push stone1 from pos31 to pos21 (pushtonongoal, left)
36. Move player1 from pos31 to pos32 (down)
37. Move player1 from pos32 to pos22 (left)
38. Push stone1 from pos21 to pos22 (pushtonongoal, down) (making pos22 not clear, satisfying constraint 8, and the precondition of constraint 9 is satisfied because earlier stone1 was at pos41)
39. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (right)
40. Move player1 from pos31 to pos32 (down)
41. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (down)
42. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (left)
43. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos23 (pushtonongoal, down)
44. Move player1 from pos22 to pos12 (left) (satisfying constraint 3)
45. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos13 (pushtogoal, left) (making pos13 not clear)
46. Goal achieved: stone1 is at pos13 (a goal location)

I believe this plan satisfies all the constraints. Let me check again:

Constraint 1: "Location pos13 is not clear" must hold in at least one state
- Satisfied at step 45 when stone1 is pushed to pos13.

Constraint 2: If "Location pos13 is not clear" holds, then earlier either "Location pos14 is not clear" or "player1 is at location pos55" must be true
- Satisfied because at step 19, pos14 is not clear, and at step 24, player1 is at pos55, both before step 45.

Constraint 3: "player1 is at location pos12" must hold in at least one state
- Satisfied at step 44.

Constraint 4: If "player1 is at location pos12" holds, then earlier either "Location pos13 is not clear" or "Location pos14 is not clear" must be true
- Not quite satisfied because step 44 comes before step 45, where pos13 becomes not clear, and after step 19, where pos14 is not clear. Actually, constraint 4 isn't fully right based on temporal order.
Hmm, let's adjust:
- I need to have pos13 not clear or pos14 not clear before player1 is at pos12. Pos14 was made not clear at step 19, but pos13 is not made not clear until step 45. Since step 44 is before step 45, I need to make sure pos14
  is not clear at a time before player1 is at pos12 (step 44).

Let me reorganize steps 19-44...

Constraint 5: "player1 is not at location pos11" must hold in every state
- Satisfied because player1 never moves to pos11 in the plan.

Constraint 6: "Location pos11 is not clear" can hold in at most one continuous sequence of states
- Satisfied because pos11 is always clear in the plan.

Constraint 7: "player1 is at location pos41" must hold in at least one state
- Satisfied at steps 9 and 33.

Constraint 8: "Location pos22 is not clear" must hold in at least one state
- Satisfied at step 38 when stone1 is at pos22.

Constraint 9: If "Location pos22 is not clear" holds, then earlier either "Location pos33 is not clear" or "stone1 is at location pos41" must be true
- Satisfied because at step 8, stone1 is at pos41 before step 38.

Constraint 10: Either "Location pos33 is not clear" or "player1 is at location pos34" must hold in at least one state
- Satisfied at step 15 when player1 is at pos34.

Constraint 11: Either "Location pos34 is not clear" or "Location pos25 is not clear" must hold in at least one state
- Let's modify the plan to ensure this.

Constraint 12: "stone1 is not at location pos12" must hold in every state
- Satisfied because stone1 never moves to pos12 in the plan.

Constraint 13: Either "stone1 is at location pos41" or "Location pos52 is not clear" must hold in at least one state
- Satisfied at step 8 when stone1 is at pos41.

I'm thinking this approach is going to be a bit complex to sequence properly. Let me break down what I know from the provided constraints, initial state, and goal and build a plan that satisfies each constraint.

First, what's the goal? Move stone1 to pos13 (the only goal location).

Now, let's trace a plan that satisfies the constraints in sequence:

1. Start with player1 at pos42, stone1 at pos32
2. Move stone1 to pos41 to satisfy constraint 13
3. Make pos33 not clear or have player1 at pos34 to satisfy constraint 10
4. Make pos34 not clear or pos25 not clear to satisfy constraint 11
5. Move stone1 to pos22 to satisfy constraint 8 (after setting up for constraint 9)
6. Make pos14 not clear before pos13 is not clear (to set up for constraint 2)
7. Have player1 at pos55 before pos13 is not clear (to also satisfy constraint 2)
8. Push stone1 to pos13 (making pos13 not clear and satisfying constraint 1)
9. Move player1 to pos12 (satisfying constraint 3, after setting up for constraint 4)

Let me merge these into a coherent plan:

1. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32 (left)
2. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (pushtonongoal, down)
3. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (down)
4. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos43 (pushtonongoal, right)
5. Move player1 from pos33 to pos34 (down) (satisfying constraint 10)
6. Move player1 from pos34 to pos35 (down)
7. Move player1 from pos35 to pos34 (up)
8. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24 (left)
9. Move player1 from pos24 to pos14 (left)
10. Move player1 from pos14 to pos24 (right)
11. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 (right)
12. Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 (right)
13. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43 (up)
14. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos42 (pushtonongoal, up)
15. Move player1 from pos43 to pos42 (up)
16. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos41 (pushtonongoal, up) (satisfying constraint 13 and setting up for constraint 9)
17. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (down)
18. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (left)
19. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (left)
20. Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 (left)
21. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14 (down)
22. Move player1 from pos14 to pos24 (right)
23. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 (right)
24. Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 (right)
25. Move player1 from pos44 to pos54 (right)
26. Move player1 from pos54 to pos55 (down) (satisfying part of constraint 2)
27. Move player1 from pos55 to pos54 (up)
28. Move player1 from pos54 to pos44 (left)
29. Move player1 from pos44 to pos34 (left)
30. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24 (left)
31. Move player1 from pos24 to pos14 (left) (positioning to make pos14 not clear)
32. Move player1 from pos14 to pos13 (up)
33. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14 (down) (making pos14 not clear, satisfying part of constraint 2)
34. Move player1 from pos14 to pos24 (right)
35. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 (right)
36. Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 (right)
37. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43 (up)
38. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (left)
39. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (left)
40. Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 (left)
41. Move player1 from pos13 to pos23 (right)
42. Move player1 from pos23 to pos22 (up)
43. Move player1 from pos22 to pos21 (up)
44. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (right)
45. Push stone1 from pos41 to pos31 (pushtonongoal, left)
46. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 (left)
47. Push stone1 from pos31 to pos21 (pushtonongoal, left)
48. Move player1 from pos31 to pos32 (down)
49. Move player1 from pos32 to pos22 (left)
50. Push stone1 from pos21 to pos22 (pushtonongoal, down) (satisfying constraint 8)
51. Move player1 from pos21 to pos22 (down)
52. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos23 (pushtonongoal, down)
53. Move player1 from pos22 to pos12 (left) (satisfying constraint 3, and this is allowed because pos14 was made not clear earlier at step 33, satisfying constraint 4)
54. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos13 (pushtogoal, left) (satisfying constraint 1)
55. Goal achieved: stone1 is at pos13 (a goal location)

But there's an issue here. In step 53, player1 moves to pos12, but constraint 4 says for player1 to be at pos12, either pos13 or pos14 must be not clear earlier. But pos13 becomes not clear at step 54, which is after step 53. 

So I need to make sure pos14 is not clear before step 53. Let me adjust the plan a bit.

Let me try once more, step by step:

1. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32 (left)
2. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (pushtonongoal, down)
3. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (down)
4. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos43 (pushtonongoal, right)
5. Move player1 from pos33 to pos34 (down) (satisfying constraint 10)
6. Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 (right)
7. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos42 (pushtonongoal, up)
8. Move player1 from pos43 to pos42 (up)
9. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos41 (pushtonongoal, up) (satisfying constraint 13 and setting up for constraint 9)
10. Move player1 from pos42 to pos52 (right)
11. Move player1 from pos52 to pos53 (down)
12. Move player1 from pos53 to pos54 (down)
13. Move player1 from pos54 to pos55 (down) (setting up for constraint 2)
14. Move player1 from pos55 to pos45 (left)
15. Move player1 from pos45 to pos35 (left)
16. Move player1 from pos35 to pos25 (left)
17. Move player1 from pos25 to pos15 (left)
18. Move player1 from pos15 to pos14 (up)
19. Move player1 from pos14 to pos24 (right)
20. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23 (up)
21. Move player1 from pos23 to pos22 (up)
22. Move player1 from pos22 to pos21 (up)
23. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (right)
24. Push stone1 from pos41 to pos31 (pushtonongoal, left)
25. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 (left)
26. Push stone1 from pos31 to pos21 (pushtonongoal, left)
27. Move player1 from pos31 to pos32 (down)
28. Move player1 from pos32 to pos22 (left)
29. Push stone1 from pos21 to pos22 (pushtonongoal, down) (satisfying constraint 8)
30. Move player1 from pos21 to pos11 (left)
   - But wait, constraint 5 says player1 cannot be at pos11. Let me adjust the plan.

30. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (right)
31. Move player1 from pos31 to pos32 (down)
32. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (down)
33. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (left)
34. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos23 (pushtonongoal, down)
35. Move player1 from pos22 to pos12 (left) (satisfying constraint 3)
36. Move player1 from pos12 to pos13 (down)
37. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14 (down) (making pos14 not clear, satisfying part of constraint 2)
38. Move player1 from pos14 to pos13 (up)
39. Move player1 from pos13 to pos12 (up) (this is after pos14 has been made not clear, satisfying constraint 4)
40. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos13 (pushtogoal, left) (satisfying constraint 1)
41. Goal achieved: stone1 is at pos13 (a goal location)

Wait, in the step "Push stone1 from pos23 to pos13 (pushtogoal, left) (satisfying constraint 1)", the player should be at pos23 to be able to push stone1 from pos23 to pos13. In the previous step, the player was at pos12. Let me update those last steps:

35. Move player1 from pos22 to pos12 (left) (satisfying constraint 3, and it's ok to be here because pos14 will be made not clear soon)
36. Move player1 from pos12 to pos13 (down)
37. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14 (down) (making pos14 not clear, satisfying part of constraint 2)
38. Move player1 from pos14 to pos13 (up)
39. Move player1 from pos13 to pos23 (right)
40. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos13 (pushtogoal, left) (satisfying constraint 1)
41. Goal achieved: stone1 is at pos13 (a goal location)

But there's still an issue. For "player1 is at location pos12" to be valid, constraint 4 says that earlier, either "Location pos13 is not clear" or "Location pos14 is not clear" must be true. But at step 35, neither of these is true yet.

Let me rearrange the plan once more to ensure all constraints are satisfied:

1. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32 (left)
2. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (pushtonongoal, down)
3. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (down)
4. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos43 (pushtonongoal, right)
5. Move player1 from pos33 to pos34 (down) (satisfying constraint 10)
6. Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 (right)
7. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos42 (pushtonongoal, up)
8. Move player1 from pos43 to pos42 (up)
9. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos41 (pushtonongoal, up) (satisfying constraint 13 and setting up for constraint 9)
10. Move player1 from pos42 to pos52 (right)
11. Move player1 from pos52 to pos53 (down)
12. Move player1 from pos53 to pos54 (down)
13. Move player1 from pos54 to pos55 (down) (setting up for constraint 2)
14. Move player1 from pos55 to pos45 (left)
15. Move player1 from pos45 to pos35 (left)
16. Move player1 from pos35 to pos25 (left)
17. Move player1 from pos25 to pos15 (left)
18. Move player1 from pos15 to pos14 (up) (making pos14 not clear, satisfying part of constraint 2)
19. Move player1 from pos14 to pos13 (up)
20. Move player1 from pos13 to pos23 (right)
21. Move player1 from pos23 to pos22 (up)
22. Move player1 from pos22 to pos21 (up)
23. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (right)
24. Push stone1 from pos41 to pos31 (pushtonongoal, left)
25. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 (left)
26. Push stone1 from pos31 to pos21 (pushtonongoal, left)
27. Move player1 from pos31 to pos32 (down)
28. Move player1 from pos32 to pos22 (left)
29. Push stone1 from pos21 to pos22 (pushtonongoal, down) (satisfying constraint 8)
30. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (right)
31. Move player1 from pos31 to pos32 (down)
32. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (down)
33. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (left)
34. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos23 (pushtonongoal, down)
35. Now, I need to make sure pos14 is not clear before moving player1 to pos12. According to the constraints, player1 must be at pos12 at some point, but before that, either pos13 or pos14 must be not clear.

Let me take a different approach:

1. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32 (left)
2. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (pushtonongoal, down)
3. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (down)
4. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos43 (pushtonongoal, right)
5. Move player1 from pos33 to pos34 (down) (satisfying constraint 10)
6. Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 (right)
7. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos42 (pushtonongoal, up)
8. Move player1 from pos43 to pos42 (up)
9. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos41 (pushtonongoal, up) (satisfying constraint 13 and setting up for constraint 9)
10. Move player1 from pos42 to pos52 (right)
11. Move player1 from pos52 to pos53 (down)
12. Move player1 from pos53 to pos54 (down)
13. Move player1 from pos54 to pos55 (down) (setting up for constraint 2)
14. Move player1 from pos55 to pos45 (left)
15. Move player1 from pos45 to pos35 (left)
16. Move player1 from pos35 to pos25 (left)
17. Move player1 from pos25 to pos15 (left)
18. Move player1 from pos15 to pos14 (up)
19. Move player1 from pos14 to pos13 (up)
20. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14 (down) (making pos14 not clear, satisfying part of constraint 2)
21. Move player1 from pos14 to pos24 (right)
22. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 (right)
23. Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 (right)
24. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43 (up)
25. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (left)
26. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (left)
27. Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 (left)
28. Move player1 from pos13 to pos12 (up) (now player1 is at pos12 after pos14 was not clear, satisfying constraints 3 and 4)
29. Move player1 from pos12 to pos22 (right)
30. Move player1 from pos22 to pos21 (up)
31. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (right)
32. Push stone1 from pos41 to pos31 (pushtonongoal, left)
33. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 (left)
34. Push stone1 from pos31 to pos21 (pushtonongoal, left)
35. Move player1 from pos31 to pos32 (down)
36. Move player1 from pos32 to pos22 (left)
37. Push stone1 from pos21 to pos22 (pushtonongoal, down) (satisfying constraint 8)
38. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (right)
39. Move player1 from pos31 to pos32 (down)
40. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (down)
41. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (left)
42. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos23 (pushtonongoal, down)
43. Move player1 from pos22 to pos23 (down)
44. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos13 (pushtogoal, left) (satisfying constraint 1)
45. Goal achieved: stone1 is at pos13 (a goal location)

But I think constraint 4 is causing an issue in our understanding. It says "If 'player1 is at location pos12' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which... 'Location pos13 is not clear' or 'Location pos14 is not clear'." This means pos13 or pos14 must be not clear at some point before player1 is at pos12, not necessarily immediately before.

So, I'll ensure pos14 is not clear at some point before player1 is at pos12.

Alright, let me review all constraints one more time and ensure they're satisfied:

1. "Location pos13 is not clear" must hold in at least one state
   - Satisfied at step 44 when stone1 is at pos13.

2. If "Location pos13 is not clear" holds, then earlier either "Location pos14 is not clear" or "player1 is at location pos55" must be true
   - Satisfied because pos14 is not clear at step 20 and player1 is at pos55 at step 13, both before step 44.

3. "player1 is at location pos12" must hold in at least one state
   - Satisfied at step 28.

4. If "player1 is at location pos12" holds, then earlier either "Location pos13 is not clear" or "Location pos14 is not clear" must be true
   - Satisfied because pos14 is not clear at step 20, which is before step 28.

5. "player1 is not at location pos11" must hold in every state
   - Satisfied because player1 never moves to pos11 in the plan.

6. "Location pos11 is not clear" can hold in at most one continuous sequence of states
   - Satisfied because pos11 is always clear in the plan.

7. "player1 is at location pos41" must hold in at least one state
   - Satisfied at step 9 when stone1 is pushed to pos41.

8. "Location pos22 is not clear" must hold in at least one state
   - Satisfied at step 37 when stone1 is at pos22.

9. If "Location pos22 is not clear" holds, then earlier either "Location pos33 is not clear" or "stone1 is at location pos41" must be true
   - Satisfied because stone1 is at pos41 at step 9, which is before step 37.

10. Either "Location pos33 is not clear" or "player1 is at location pos34" must hold in at least one state
    - Satisfied at step 5 when player1 is at pos34.

11. Either "Location pos34 is not clear" or "Location pos25 is not clear" must hold in at least one state
    - This constraint is not yet satisfied. I need to make either pos34 or pos25 not clear at some point.

12. "stone1 is not at location pos12" must hold in every state
    - Satisfied because stone1 never moves to pos12 in the plan.

13. Either "stone1 is at location pos41" or "Location pos52 is not clear" must hold in at least one state
    - Satisfied at step 9 when stone1 is at pos41.

I need to update the plan to satisfy constraint 11. Let me adjust:

1. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32 (left)
2. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (pushtonongoal, down)
3. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (down)
4. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos43 (pushtonongoal, right)
5. Move player1 from pos33 to pos34 (down) (satisfying constraint 10)
6. Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 (right)
7. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos42 (pushtonongoal, up)
8. Move player1 from pos43 to pos42 (up)
9. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos41 (pushtonongoal, up) (satisfying constraint 13 and setting up for constraint 9)
10. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (down)
11. Move player1 from pos43 to pos44 (down)
12. Move player1 from pos44 to pos34 (left)
13. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24 (left)
14. Move player1 from pos24 to pos25 (down) (making pos25 not clear, satisfying constraint 11)
15. Move player1 from pos25 to pos35 (right)
16. Move player1 from pos35 to pos45 (right)
17. Move player1 from pos45 to pos55 (right) (setting up for constraint 2)
18. Move player1 from pos55 to pos54 (up)
19. Move player1 from pos54 to pos53 (up)
20. Move player1 from pos53 to pos43 (left)
21. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (left)
22. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (left)
23. Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 (left)
24. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14 (down)
25. Move player1 from pos14 to pos13 (up)
26. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14 (down) (making pos14 not clear, satisfying part of constraint 2)
27. Move player1 from pos14 to pos24 (right)
28. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23 (up)
29. Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 (left)
30. Move player1 from pos13 to pos12 (up) (now player1 is at pos12 after pos14 was not clear, satisfying constraints 3 and 4)
31. Move player1 from pos12 to pos22 (right)
32. Move player1 from pos22 to pos21 (up)
33. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (right)
34. Push stone1 from pos41 to pos31 (pushtonongoal, left)
35. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 (left)
36. Push stone1 from pos31 to pos21 (pushtonongoal, left)
37. Move player1 from pos31 to pos32 (down)
38. Move player1 from pos32 to pos22 (left)
39. Push stone1 from pos21 to pos22 (pushtonongoal, down) (satisfying constraint 8)
40. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (right)
41. Move player1 from pos31 to pos32 (down)
42. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (down)
43. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (left)
44. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos23 (pushtonongoal, down)
45. Move player1 from pos22 to pos23 (down)
46. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos13 (pushtogoal, left) (satisfying constraint 1)
47. Goal achieved: stone1 is at pos13 (a goal location)

I believe this plan satisfies all the constraints. Let me check one more time:

Constraint 1: "Location pos13 is not clear" must hold in at least one state
   - Satisfied at step 46 when stone1 is at pos13.

Constraint 2: If "Location pos13 is not clear" holds, then earlier either "Location pos14 is not clear" or "player1 is at location pos55" must be true
   - Satisfied because pos14 is not clear at step 26 and player1 is at pos55 at step 17, both before step 46.

Constraint 3: "player1 is at location pos12" must hold in at least one state
   - Satisfied at step 30.

Constraint 4: If "player1 is at location pos12" holds, then earlier either "Location pos13 is not clear" or "Location pos14 is not clear" must be true
   - Satisfied because pos14 is not clear at step 26, which is before step 30.

Constraint 5: "player1 is not at location pos11" must hold in every state
   - Satisfied because player1 never moves to pos11 in the plan.

Constraint 6: "Location pos11 is not clear" can hold in at most one continuous sequence of states
   - Satisfied because pos11 is always clear in the plan.

Constraint 7: "player1 is at location pos41" must hold in at least one state
   - Satisfied at step 9 when stone1 is pushed to pos41.

Constraint 8: "Location pos22 is not clear" must hold in at least one state
   - Satisfied at step 39 when stone1 is at pos22.

Constraint 9: If "Location pos22 is not clear" holds, then earlier either "Location pos33 is not clear" or "stone1 is at location pos41" must be true
   - Satisfied because stone1 is at pos41 at step 9, which is before step 39.

Constraint 10: Either "Location pos33 is not clear" or "player1 is at location pos34" must hold in at least one state
    - Satisfied at step 5 when player1 is at pos34.

Constraint 11: Either "Location pos34 is not clear" or "Location pos25 is not clear" must hold in at least one state
    - Satisfied at step 14 when pos25 is not clear.

Constraint 12: "stone1 is not at location pos12" must hold in every state
    - Satisfied because stone1 never moves to pos12 in the plan.

Constraint 13: Either "stone1 is at location pos41" or "Location pos52 is not clear" must hold in at least one state
    - Satisfied at step 9 when stone1 is at pos41.

I believe this plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal.

Let's write out the plan one more time, ensuring each step is valid:

1. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32 (left)
   - Actually, at the starting state, stone1 is at pos32, so player1 can't move there. Let me rethink this.

Let me trace through the starting state again:
- player1 at pos42
- stone1 at pos32

1. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (down)
2. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (left)
3. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos22 (pushtonongoal, left)
4. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (down)
5. Move player1 from pos33 to pos34 (down) (satisfying constraint 10)
6. Move player1 from pos34 to pos35 (down)
7. Move player1 from pos35 to pos45 (right)
8. Move player1 from pos45 to pos55 (right) (setting up for constraint 2)
9. Move player1 from pos55 to pos54 (up)
10. Move player1 from pos54 to pos44 (left)
11. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43 (up)
12. Move player1 from pos43 to pos42 (up)
13. Move player1 from pos42 to pos41 (up) (satisfying constraint 7)
14. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 (left)
15. Move player1 from pos31 to pos21 (left)
16. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos32 (pushtonongoal, right)
17. Move player1 from pos22 to pos23 (down)
18. Move player1 from pos23 to pos33 (right)
19. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (pushtonongoal, down)
20. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (down)
21. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos43 (pushtonongoal, right)
22. Move player1 from pos33 to pos34 (down)
23. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24 (left)
24. Move player1 from pos24 to pos25 (down) (making pos25 not clear, satisfying constraint 11)
25. Move player1 from pos25 to pos24 (up)
26. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23 (up)
27. Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 (left)
28. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14 (down)
29. Move player1 from pos14 to pos13 (up)
30. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14 (down) (making pos14 not clear, satisfying part of constraint 2)

This doesn't seem to be going the way I want. Let me step back and redefine a coherent plan:

1. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (down)
2. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (left)
3. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos22 (pushtonongoal, left) (satisfying constraint 8)
4. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (down)
5. Move player1 from pos33 to pos34 (down) (satisfying constraint 10)
6. Move player1 from pos34 to pos35 (down)
7. Move player1 from pos35 to pos25 (left) (making pos25 not clear, satisfying constraint 11)
8. Move player1 from pos25 to pos15 (left)
9. Move player1 from pos15 to pos14 (up)
10. Move player1 from pos14 to pos13 (up)
11. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14 (down) (making pos14 not clear, satisfying part of constraint 2)
12. Move player1 from pos14 to pos24 (right)
13. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 (right)
14. Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 (right)
15. Move player1 from pos44 to pos54 (right)
16. Move player1 from pos54 to pos55 (down) (satisfying part of constraint 2)
17. Move player1 from pos55 to pos45 (left)
18. Move player1 from pos45 to pos35 (left)
19. Move player1 from pos35 to pos25 (left)
20. Move player1 from pos25 to pos24 (up)
21. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23 (up)
22. Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 (left)
23. Move player1 from pos13 to pos12 (up) (satisfying constraint 3, after pos14 was not clear at step 11, satisfying constraint 4)
24. Move player1 from pos12 to pos22 (right)
25. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (right)
26. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (down)
27. Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 (right)
28. Move player1 from pos43 to pos42 (up)
29. Move player1 from pos42 to pos41 (up) (satisfying constraint 7)
30. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 (left)
31. Move player1 from pos31 to pos21 (left)
32. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos21 (pushtonongoal, up)
33. Move player1 from pos22 to pos23 (down)
34. Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 (left)
35. Push stone1 from pos21 to pos11 (pushtonongoal, left)
   - But constraint 5 says player1 cannot be at pos11. Let me rethink this.

Wait, I think I've been misunderstanding constraint 5. It says "player1 is not at location pos11" must hold in every state, which means player1 can't be at pos11 at any point, but it doesn't mean stone1 can't be at pos11.

Alright, let me rethink the plan once more. I need to push stone1 to pos13, but I need to do it in a way that satisfies all the constraints.

Actually I'm not sure I understood constraint 5 correctly after all. Player1 being at pos11 would mean it's not clear. Let me be cautious.

Let's rethink the plan from scratch, carefully ensuring each step satisfies the constraints:

1. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (down)
2. Move player1 from pos43 to pos44 (down)
3. Move player1 from pos44 to pos34 (left) (satisfying constraint 10)
4. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33 (up)
5. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (pushtonongoal, down)
6. Move player1 from pos32 to pos42 (right)
7. Move player1 from pos42 to pos41 (up) (satisfying constraint 7)
8. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 (left)
9. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos34 (pushtonongoal, down) (making pos34 not clear, satisfying constraint 11)
10. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (left)
11. Move player1 from pos23 to pos24 (down)
12. Move player1 from pos24 to pos25 (down)
13. Move player1 from pos25 to pos35 (right)
14. Move player1 from pos35 to pos45 (right)
15. Move player1 from pos45 to pos55 (right) (setting up for constraint 2)
16. Move player1 from pos55 to pos45 (left)
17. Move player1 from pos45 to pos44 (up)
18. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos24 (pushtonongoal, left)
19. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24 (left)
20. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos14 (pushtonongoal, left) (making pos14 not clear, satisfying part of constraint 2)
21. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23 (up)
22. Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 (left)
23. Push stone1 from pos14 to pos13 (pushtogoal, up) (making pos13 not clear, satisfying constraint 1)
24. Move player1 from pos14 to pos13 (up)
25. Move player1 from pos13 to pos12 (up) (satisfying constraint 3, after pos14 was not clear, satisfying constraint 4)
26. Goal achieved: stone1 is at pos13 (a goal location)

Wait, we need to satisfy constraint 13, which says either stone1 must be at pos41 or pos52 must not be clear at some point. Let me update the plan.

1. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (down)
2. Move player1 from pos43 to pos44 (down)
3. Move player1 from pos44 to pos34 (left) (satisfying constraint 10)
4. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33 (up)
5. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (pushtonongoal, down)
6. Move player1 from pos32 to pos42 (right)
7. Move player1 from pos42 to pos52 (right) (making pos52 not clear, satisfying constraint 13)
8. Move player1 from pos52 to pos42 (left)
9. Move player1 from pos42 to pos41 (up) (satisfying constraint 7)
10. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 (left)
11. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos34 (pushtonongoal, down) (making pos34 not clear, satisfying constraint 11)
12. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (left)
13. Move player1 from pos23 to pos22 (up) (making pos22 not clear, satisfying constraint 8)
14. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (right)
15. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (down)
16. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos24 (pushtonongoal, left)

Wait, what about constraint 9? It says if pos22 is not clear, then earlier either pos33 is not clear or stone1 is at pos41.

Let me reorganize the plan once more:

1. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (down)
2. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (left)
3. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (pushtonongoal, down) (making pos33 not clear, setting up for constraint 9)
4. Move player1 from pos32 to pos42 (right)
5. Move player1 from pos42 to pos52 (right) (making pos52 not clear, satisfying constraint 13)
6. Move player1 from pos52 to pos42 (left)
7. Move player1 from pos42 to pos41 (up) (satisfying constraint 7)
8. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 (left)
9. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos32 (pushtonongoal, up)
10. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (left)
11. Move player1 from pos23 to pos22 (up)
12. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos22 (pushtonongoal, left) (making pos22 not clear, satisfying constraint 8, after pos33 was not clear, satisfying constraint 9)
13. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (down)
14. Move player1 from pos33 to pos34 (down) (satisfying constraint 10)
15. Move player1 from pos34 to pos35 (down)
16. Move player1 from pos35 to pos45 (right)
17. Move player1 from pos45 to pos55 (right) (setting up for constraint 2)
18. Move player1 from pos55 to pos45 (left)
19. Move player1 from pos45 to pos35 (left)
20. Move player1 from pos35 to pos25 (left)
21. Move player1 from pos25 to pos15 (left)
22. Move player1 from pos15 to pos14 (up)
23. Move player1 from pos14 to pos24 (right)
24. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23 (up)
25. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos23 (pushtonongoal, down)
26. Move player1 from pos22 to pos23 (down)
27. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos24 (pushtonongoal, down)
28. Move player1 from pos23 to pos24 (down)
29. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos14 (pushtonongoal, left) (making pos14 not clear, satisfying part of constraint 2)
30. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23 (up)
31. Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 (left)
32. Push stone1 from pos14 to pos13 (pushtogoal, up) (making pos13 not clear, satisfying constraint 1)
33. Move player1 from pos14 to pos13 (up)
34. Move player1 from pos13 to pos12 (up) (satisfying constraint 3, after pos14 was not clear, satisfying constraint 4)
35. Goal achieved: stone1 is at pos13 (a goal location)

Let me check this plan against the constraints:

Constraint 1: "Location pos13 is not clear" must hold in at least one state
   - Satisfied at step 32 when stone1 is at pos13.

Constraint 2: If "Location pos13 is not clear" holds, then earlier either "Location pos14 is not clear" or "player1 is at location pos55" must be true
   - Satisfied because pos14 is not clear at step 29 and player1 is at pos55 at step 17, both before step 32.

Constraint 3: "player1 is at location pos12" must hold in at least one state
   - Satisfied at step 34.

Constraint 4: If "player1 is at location pos12" holds, then earlier either "Location pos13 is not clear" or "Location pos14 is not clear" must be true
   - Satisfied because pos14 is not clear at step 29, which is before step 34.

Constraint 5: "player1 is not at location pos11" must hold in every state
   - Satisfied because player1 never moves to pos11 in the plan.

Constraint 6: "Location pos11 is not clear" can hold in at most one continuous sequence of states
   - Satisfied because pos11 is always clear in the plan.

Constraint 7: "player1 is at location pos41" must hold in at least one state
   - Satisfied at step 7.

Constraint 8: "Location pos22 is not clear" must hold in at least one state
   - Satisfied at step 12 when stone1 is at pos22.

Constraint 9: If "Location pos22 is not clear" holds, then earlier either "Location pos33 is not clear" or "stone1 is at location pos41" must be true
   - Satisfied because pos33 is not clear at step 3, which is before step 12.

Constraint 10: Either "Location pos33 is not clear" or "player1 is at location pos34" must hold in at least one state
    - Satisfied at step 3 when pos33 is not clear and at step 14 when player1 is at pos34.

Constraint 11: Either "Location pos34 is not clear" or "Location pos25 is not clear" must hold in at least one state
    - This constraint isn't explicitly satisfied yet. Let me update the plan.

1. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (down)
2. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (left)
3. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (pushtonongoal, down) (making pos33 not clear, setting up for constraint 9 and satisfying part of constraint 10)

5. Move player1 from pos42 to pos52 (right) (making pos52 not clear, satisfying constraint 13)
6. Move player1 from pos52 to pos42 (left)
7. Move player1 from pos42 to pos41 (up) (satisfying constraint 7)
8. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 (left)

12. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14 (down)
13. Move player1 from pos14 to pos24 (right)
14. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 (right)
15. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos33 (pushtonongoal, up)
16. Move player1 from pos34 to pos35 (down)
17. Move player1 from pos35 to pos45 (right)
18. Move player1 from pos45 to pos55 (right) (setting up for constraint 2)
19. Move player1 from pos55 to pos45 (left)
20. Move player1 from pos45 to pos35 (left)
21. Move player1 from pos35 to pos25 (left)
22. Move player1 from pos25 to pos24 (up)
23. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23 (up)
24. Move player1 from pos23 to pos22 (up)
25. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (right)
26. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos32 (pushtonongoal, up)
27. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (left)
28. Move player1 from pos23 to pos22 (up)
29. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos22 (pushtonongoal, left) (making pos22 not clear, satisfying constraint 8, after pos33 was not clear, satisfying constraint 9)
30. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (down)
31. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (left)
32. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos23 (pushtonongoal, down)
33. Move player1 from pos22 to pos23 (down)
34. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos24 (pushtonongoal, down)
35. Move player1 from pos23 to pos24 (down)
36. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos14 (pushtonongoal, left) (making pos14 not clear, satisfying part of constraint 2)
37. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23 (up)
38. Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 (left)
39. Push stone1 from pos14 to pos13 (pushtogoal, up) (making pos13 not clear, satisfying constraint 1)
40. Move player1 from pos14 to pos13 (up)
41. Move player1 from pos13 to pos12 (up) (satisfying constraint 3, after pos14 was not clear, satisfying constraint 4)
42. Goal achieved: stone1 is at pos13 (a goal location)

Checking constraints again:

Constraint 1: "Location pos13 is not clear" must hold in at least one state
   - Satisfied at step 39 when stone1 is at pos13.

Constraint 2: If "Location pos13 is not clear" holds, then earlier either "Location pos14 is not clear" or "player1 is at location pos55" must be true
   - Satisfied because pos14 is not clear at step 36 and player1 is at pos55 at step 18, both before step 39.

Constraint 3: "player1 is at location pos12" must hold in at least one state
   - Satisfied at step 41.

Constraint 4: If "player1 is at location pos12" holds, then earlier either "Location pos13 is not clear" or "Location pos14 is not clear" must be true
   - Satisfied because pos14 is not clear at step 36, which is before step 41.

Constraint 5: "player1 is not at location pos11" must hold in every state
   - Satisfied because player1 never moves to pos11 in the plan.

Constraint 6: "Location pos11 is not clear" can hold in at most one continuous sequence of states
   - Satisfied because pos11 is always clear in the plan.

Constraint 7: "player1 is at location pos41" must hold in at least one state
   - Satisfied at step 7.

Constraint 8: "Location pos22 is not clear" must hold in at least one state
   - Satisfied at step 29 when stone1 is at pos22.

Constraint 9: If "Location pos22 is not clear" holds, then earlier either "Location pos33 is not clear" or "stone1 is at location pos41" must be true
   - Satisfied because pos33 is not clear at step 3, which is before step 29.

Constraint 10: Either "Location pos33 is not clear" or "player1 is at location pos34" must hold in at least one state
    - Satisfied at step 3 when pos33 is not clear and at step 14 when player1 is at pos34.

Constraint 11: Either "Location pos34 is not clear" or "Location pos25 is not clear" must hold in at least one state
    - Satisfied at step 9 when pos34 is not clear.

Constraint 12: "stone1 is not at location pos12" must hold in every state
    - Satisfied because stone1 never moves to pos12 in the plan.

Constraint 13: Either "stone1 is at location pos41" or "Location pos52 is not clear" must hold in at least one state
    - Satisfied at step 5 when pos52 is not clear.

This plan should satisfy all the constraints and achieve the goal. But I think the step "Move player1 from pos32 to pos42 (right)" (step 4) should be "Move player1 from pos32 to pos31 (left)" based on the grid.

Actually, let me just list the final plan, making sure it follows the grid structure:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1 [ ][ ][G][ ][ ]
2 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
3 [ ][S][ ][ ][ ]
4 [ ][P][ ][ ][ ]
5 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
```
