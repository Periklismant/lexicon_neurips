Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. From the initial state, stone1 is at pos32, and the only goal location mentioned is pos13. So I need to move stone1 from pos32 to pos13. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy as well. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the agent starts at pos42. To push the stone from pos32, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. Looking at the movement possibilities: pos42 can move to pos32 via dirleft, according to the "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft" precondition. Wait, but in the initial state, pos32 is clear because "Location pos32 is clear". Wait, no—the original state says "stone1 is at location pos32", so pos32 is not clear. Wait, wait, the original state says "stone1 is at location pos32" and "Location pos32 is clear". Wait, that's a contradiction. Wait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again. The original state lists "stone1 is at location pos32", which would mean pos32 is occupied by the stone, so it's not clear. But then in the list of locations that are clear, pos32 is not listed. Wait, the initial state says:

"Location pos32 is clear" is not in the list of clear locations. Wait, the original state's clear locations include pos31, pos33, pos34, etc., but pos32 is not mentioned. Wait, looking back: the original state says:

"Location pos31 is clear"
"Location pos33 is clear"
"Location pos34 is clear"
... etc. So pos32 is not listed as clear. So stone1 is at pos32, which makes pos32 not clear. Therefore, the agent can't just move into pos32 unless they push the stone. Wait, no—the agent can move to a location if it's clear. Since pos32 has the stone, it's not clear. So the agent can't move directly into pos32. So to push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. Let's see where pos32 is adjacent. The adjacent locations would be pos22 (up), pos42 (down), pos31 (left), pos33 (right). But the agent is at pos42. So pos42 is adjacent to pos32 (since moving dirleft from pos42 takes you to pos32? Wait, no. Wait, looking at the movement directions:

The movement from pos42: "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft". Wait, pos42 is at (4,2), and pos32 is (3,2). So moving left from pos42 would be to pos32. But pos32 has the stone, so it's not clear. Therefore, the agent can't move directly into pos32. So they need to push the stone from an adjacent position. Wait, but pushing requires that the agent is at a location adjacent to the stone. So perhaps the agent can move to pos42's adjacent positions and then push.

Wait, the agent is at pos42. To push the stone at pos32, the agent needs to be at a location adjacent to pos32. For example, pos42 is south of pos32. So if the agent is at pos42, and the stone is at pos32, can the agent push it north to pos22? Wait, pushing requires that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's current location) in direction d. Then the stone moves from l_from to l_to, which is in the same direction d. So for example, if the agent is at pos42 (south of pos32), and the stone is at pos32, then pushing north (dirup) would move the stone to pos22. But wait, the direction in the action is the direction from the agent's location to the stone's location. So if the agent is at pos42, the stone is at pos32 (north of pos42), then the direction from agent to stone is dirup. Then, pushing the stone would require that the stone moves in the same direction dirup, which would be from pos32 to pos22. But pos22 needs to be clear. Let me check: in the initial state, pos22 is clear. So the agent can perform a pushtonongoal (since pos22 is not a goal location) to move the stone from pos32 to pos22. But the goal is to get the stone to a goal location (pos13), so that's a step away. Alternatively, maybe push it towards the goal.

Wait, but the goal location is pos13. So the stone needs to end up there. The path from pos32 to pos13 would require moving left and up, perhaps. Let's map the grid. Let's imagine the grid as rows 1 (top) to 5 (bottom), columns 1 to 5. So pos13 is row 1, column 3. pos32 is row 3, column 2. So to get from pos32 to pos13, the stone needs to move up twice (to pos22, then pos12) and then right to pos13. But pos13 is a goal location. But pushing to pos22 would be a non-goal location. So the steps would be:

1. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos22 (non-goal, so pushtonongoal)
2. Push from pos22 to pos12 (non-goal, pushtonongoal)
3. Push from pos12 to pos13 (goal, so pushtogoal)

But each push requires the agent to be in the correct position. Let's see:

Initial position: agent at pos42. Stone at pos32.

First, agent needs to get into position to push the stone north (dirup) to pos22. For that, the agent is already south of the stone at pos42. So the direction from agent to stone is dirup. So action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup. Let's check preconditions:

- Agent is at pos42: yes.
- Stone is at pos32: yes.
- pos22 is clear: initial state says pos22 is clear. Yes.
- Can move from pos42 to pos32 dirup: but according to the movement rules, the allowed moves from pos42 include moving dirleft to pos32. Wait, no. The movement from pos42 to pos32 is via dirleft, not dirup. Wait, the direction names might not correspond directly to the grid's directions. For example, the movement from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft, which would mean moving left (column decreases by 1, same row). But in grid terms, pos42 is (4,2), pos32 is (3,2), so moving left (assuming columns are the first number) would be from 4 to 3. So direction dirleft allows moving from pos42 to pos32. So the direction from agent's location (pos42) to stone's location (pos32) is dirleft. Therefore, the agent can push the stone in the same direction dirleft, which would move the stone from pos32 to pos22? Wait, no. Wait, if the agent is at pos42, and the stone is at pos32 (to the left of the agent), then pushing in direction dirleft would move the stone further left. But pos32's left is pos31. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the directions.

Wait, the movement directions can be a bit confusing. Let's clarify based on the given movement rules. For example, "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft". So moving dirleft from pos42 takes you to pos32. Similarly, from pos32, moving dirleft would take you to pos22? Wait, looking at the movement from pos32: "You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft". Wait, no. The movement from pos32 says: "You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft". So yes, moving dirleft from pos32 takes you to pos22. So direction dirleft corresponds to moving left (decreasing the first number in the position, assuming positions are labeled as posXY where X is row and Y is column, but maybe it's the other way around. Wait, the positions are pos11, pos12, pos13, etc. So pos11 is row 1, column 1; pos12 is row 1, column 2; pos21 is row 2, column 1. So moving dirright from pos11 takes you to pos21 (row 2, column 1?), or is it pos12? Wait, looking at the movement rules: "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright". So pos11 to pos21 is dirright. So dirright increases the row number. Then, direction dirright is moving down a row. Similarly, direction dirdown increases the column number. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me parse the movement directions again.

For example, pos11 can move to pos21 via dirright. So pos11 (row 1, column 1) to pos21 (row 2, column 1) is dirright. So dirright is moving down a row. Then, dirleft would be moving up a row. Similarly, dirdown from pos11 takes you to pos12 (row 1, column 2), so dirdown increases the column number. So direction dirup would decrease the column number. Wait, this is a bit counterintuitive. So:

- dirright: row +1 (down)
- dirleft: row -1 (up)
- dirdown: column +1 (right)
- dirup: column -1 (left)

Wait, that seems possible. For example:

From pos12, moving dirright takes you to pos22 (row 2, column 2). So yes, dirright is down. From pos12, moving dirdown takes you to pos13 (column 3). So dirdown is increasing the column. So directions are a bit different:

- dirright: down (row increases)
- dirleft: up (row decreases)
- dirdown: right (column increases)
- dirup: left (column decreases)

This is important for planning the moves.

So, the agent is at pos42 (row 4, column 2). The stone is at pos32 (row 3, column 2). To push the stone north (which would be row decreases), but according to the directions, moving dirleft from pos32 would take you to pos22 (row 2, column 2). Wait, no. From pos32, dirleft is row decreases by 1 (since dirleft is up). So pos32 (row 3, column 2) moving dirleft would go to pos22 (row 2, column 2). Correct. So to push the stone from pos32 to pos22, the agent needs to be south of the stone (pos42 is row 4, column 2; stone is at row 3, column 2). The agent is at pos42. The direction from agent to stone is dirleft (since moving dirleft from pos42 takes you to pos32). So to push the stone from pos32 to pos22, the agent must be at pos42, push in direction dirleft (towards pos32), then the stone moves dirleft from pos32 to pos22. But wait, the direction in the push action is the direction from the agent's location to the stone's location. So if the agent is at pos42, and the stone is at pos32, the direction is dirleft. Then, the stone moves in the same direction dirleft, which is from pos32 to pos22.

So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft. Let's check preconditions:

1. Agent is at pos42: yes.
2. Stone is at pos32: yes.
3. pos22 is clear: initial state says pos22 is clear. Yes.
4. Can move from pos42 to pos32 via dirleft: yes, according to movement rules.
5. Can move from pos32 to pos22 via dirleft: yes, according to movement rules.
6. pos22 is not a goal location: correct, since pos13 is the only goal.

So this action is valid. After this, the stone is at pos22, and the agent is at pos32. Then, we need to push the stone from pos22 to pos12, then to pos13.

But let's see. After pushing to pos22, the agent is now at pos32 (since after pushing, the agent moves to l_from, which is pos32). But pos32 was previously occupied by the stone, but after the push, the stone is at pos22, so pos32 is now clear. Wait, no: the effect of pushtonongoal is that the agent moves to l_from (pos32), which was the stone's original location. So after the action, the agent is at pos32, the stone is at pos22. So pos32 is now occupied by the agent, and pos22 has the stone. Then, pos42 (agent's previous location) becomes clear.

Now, next step: push the stone from pos22 to pos12. To do that, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos22. The agent is at pos32. From pos32, moving dirleft (up) to pos22 is allowed. Wait, pos32's movement options include moving dirleft to pos22. So the agent is at pos32. To push the stone at pos22, the agent needs to be at a position adjacent to pos22. For example, if the agent is at pos32 (south of pos22), direction dirleft (up) to pos22. So the direction from agent to stone is dirleft. Then, pushing the stone in dirleft direction would take it to pos12.

So action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft. Let's check preconditions:

1. Agent is at pos32: yes, after previous action.
2. Stone is at pos22: yes.
3. pos12 is clear: initial state says pos12 is clear. But after previous steps, pos12 is still clear unless another stone is there. Since there's only one stone, yes.
4. Can move from pos32 to pos22 via dirleft: yes.
5. Can move from pos22 to pos12 via dirleft: yes.
6. pos12 is not a goal: correct.

After this action, stone moves to pos12, agent moves to pos22.

Next step: push the stone from pos12 to pos13, which is a goal. So action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos12 pos13 dirdown. Wait, pos13 is east (right) of pos12. The direction from pos12 to pos13 is dirdown (since moving dirdown from pos12 takes you to pos13). The agent is at pos22. Wait, wait. After the previous step, the agent is at pos22. To push the stone from pos12 to pos13, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos12. So where is the agent? At pos22. To reach pos12, the agent can move dirleft (up) from pos22 to pos12. But the agent can't move into pos12 if it's occupied by the stone. Wait, after the second push, the stone is at pos12. So pos12 is not clear. Therefore, the agent can't move into pos12. So how can the agent push the stone from pos12 to pos13?

The agent needs to be adjacent to pos12. For example, the agent could be at pos11, pos13, pos21, or pos22 (if possible). Wait, pos12's adjacent positions are pos11 (left), pos13 (right), pos22 (down), and pos21 (up? Wait, according to movement rules, from pos12 you can move to pos22 via dirright (down). Hmm, perhaps the agent needs to approach from pos22. Let's think.

The agent is currently at pos22 after the second push. The stone is at pos12. To push the stone east to pos13 (dirdown direction), the agent needs to be west of the stone (pos11?), south (pos22?), north (pos21?), or east (pos13). Let's see:

If the stone is at pos12, then pos13 is east (right). To push east (dirdown direction), the agent needs to be west of the stone. Wait, no. The direction in the push action is the direction from the agent's location to the stone's location. So if the agent is at pos22 (south of pos12), the direction from agent to stone is dirup (since moving dirup from pos22 to pos12 is allowed). Wait, movement from pos22 to pos12 is via dirleft (since "You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft"). So dirleft from pos22 (row 2, column 2) takes you to pos12 (row 1, column 2). So direction dirleft is up. So if the agent is at pos22, the stone is at pos12. The direction from agent to stone is dirleft. Then, pushing the stone in dirleft direction would move it to pos12's dirleft, which is pos11. But we want to push it to pos13. That's the opposite direction.

Alternatively, the agent could be at pos13 (east of pos12). But pos13 is a goal location, but initially clear. So if the agent can get to pos13, they could push the stone from pos12 to pos13. How?

Let's think about the agent's path after the second push. After pushing to pos12, the agent is at pos22. The stone is at pos12. The agent needs to get to the east side of the stone (pos13) to push it west, but that's not helpful. Wait, to push the stone to pos13 (east), the agent needs to be west of the stone (pos12's west is pos11). So the agent needs to be at pos11, then push east (dirdown direction) to pos12 to pos13. But pos11 is initially clear. Let's see:

From pos22, the agent can move to pos12 via dirleft (if pos12 is clear). But after the second push, pos12 has the stone, so it's not clear. Therefore, the agent can't move to pos12. So the agent is at pos22. To reach a position from which to push the stone east to pos13, the agent needs to move around. For example, move from pos22 to pos23 via dirdown (if allowed). Let's check movement options from pos22: "You may move from location pos22 to location pos32 following direction dirright" (no, pos22 to pos32 is dirright?), wait:

Wait, movement rules for pos22: "You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos22 to location pos32 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos22 to location pos21 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos22 to location pos23 following direction dirdown". So from pos22, moving dirright (down) to pos32, dirleft (up) to pos12, dirup (left) to pos21, or dirdown (right) to pos23. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify again:

dirright: row +1 (down)
dirleft: row -1 (up)
dirdown: column +1 (right)
dirup: column -1 (left)

So from pos22 (row 2, column 2), moving dirright (down) to pos32 (row 3, column 2), dirleft (up) to pos12 (row 1, column 2), dirup (column -1) to pos21 (row 2, column 1), dirdown (column +1) to pos23 (row 2, column 3).

So the agent is at pos22. To get to pos13, maybe the agent can move to pos23, then to pos24, etc., but that seems complicated. Alternatively, the agent could move from pos22 to pos21 (dirup direction, column -1), then to pos11 (dirleft?), but pos11 is a non-goal location. Hmm. Let's think differently.

The stone is at pos12. We need to push it to pos13. To do that, the agent needs to be at pos12's west (pos11) or south (pos22) or north (pos21?), but directions may vary. Wait, if the agent is south of the stone (pos22), and the stone is at pos12, then the direction from agent to stone is dirleft (up). Pushing the stone in dirleft would take it to pos12's dirleft, which is pos11. Not helpful. Alternatively, if the agent is east of the stone (pos13), then direction from agent to stone is dirup (left?), and pushing in that direction would move the stone west to pos11. No. So to push the stone east to pos13, the agent must be west of the stone (pos11), and push east (dirdown direction). So the agent needs to be at pos11, direction dirdown to pos12, then push to pos13.

But how to get the agent to pos11? Let's see the movement path. From pos22, the agent can move dirup (column -1) to pos21. From pos21, move dirleft (up) to pos11. Wait, movement from pos21: "You may move from location pos21 to location pos11 following direction dirleft" (dirleft is row -1, so from row 2 to row 1). So yes. So path is pos22 → pos21 (dirup), then pos21 → pos11 (dirleft). But pos11 must be clear. Initially, pos11 is clear, but after any actions? Let's see. The initial state says pos11 is clear. So agent can move there.

So steps:

1. After pushing stone to pos22 and being at pos32, then pushing to pos12 and being at pos22.

Wait, no. Let me retrace:

First action: pushtonongoal from pos42 to pos32 to pos22. Agent ends at pos32.

Wait, no. Wait, the first action is pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft. After this action, the agent moves from pos42 to pos32 (since l_p is pos42, and after the action, the agent is at l_from (pos32)). The stone is moved to pos22. So pos42 becomes clear, pos32 is now occupied by the agent, pos22 has the stone.

Then, second action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft. Agent is at pos32, stone at pos22. The agent needs to be adjacent to pos22. From pos32, moving dirleft (up) to pos22 is allowed. So the direction is dirleft. Then, the stone moves from pos22 to pos12. Agent moves to pos22. So after this, agent is at pos22, stone at pos12.

Now, third action: agent needs to get to pos11 to push the stone east. So from pos22, move dirup (column -1) to pos21. Then from pos21, move dirleft (row -1) to pos11. So:

Action: move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup. Preconditions: agent is at pos22, pos21 is clear. Initially, pos21 is clear. So valid.

Then action: move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft. Preconditions: agent at pos21, pos11 is clear. Yes.

Now agent is at pos11. Then, push the stone from pos12 to pos13. Since pos13 is a goal, we use pushtogoal. The direction from pos11 to pos12 is dirdown (column +1). So action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown. Check preconditions:

1. Agent is at pos11: yes.
2. Stone is at pos12: yes.
3. pos13 is clear: initially yes, and no actions have affected it yet.
4. Can move from pos11 to pos12 via dirdown: yes, according to movement rules.
5. Can move from pos12 to pos13 via dirdown: yes.
6. pos13 is a goal: yes.

After this, the stone is at pos13 (goal), agent is at pos12.

But we need to check constraints. Let's go through each constraint:

1. "Location pos13 is not clear" must hold in at least one state. After pushing the stone to pos13, pos13 is not clear. So this is satisfied.

2. If pos13 is not clear in some state, there must be an earlier state where either pos14 is not clear or player1 is at pos55. Wait, in our plan, when pos13 becomes not clear (after the final push), we need to have an earlier state where pos14 is not clear or player1 was at pos55. In our current plan, the agent never goes to pos55. So we need to ensure that in some prior step, pos14 is not clear. But in our current plan, pos14 remains clear throughout. So this constraint is not satisfied. Uh-oh. So we need to adjust the plan to include a step where pos14 is not clear or the agent is at pos55.

Similarly, other constraints:

3. "player1 is at location pos12" must hold in at least one state. In the final step, after pushing to pos13, the agent is at pos12. So that's satisfied.

4. If player1 is at pos12 (which happens in the final step), there must be an earlier state where pos13 is not clear or pos14 is not clear. But in our current plan, pos13 becomes not clear in the same step as the agent is at pos12. So the earlier state must have pos13 not clear before that. But in the final step, the agent moves to pos12 and pos13 becomes not clear at the same time. So the earlier state would be before the final action. But before that, pos13 was clear. So this constraint is not satisfied. Hence, our plan so far violates this constraint.

Therefore, we need to adjust the plan to satisfy all constraints.

Let's list all constraints again:

Constraints:

1. pos13 is not clear in at least one state. Satisfied by the final step.

2. If pos13 is not clear in some state, there must be an earlier state where pos14 is not clear or agent is at pos55. So when pos13 is not clear (after final action), we need to have a prior state where pos14 was not clear or agent was at pos55. In the current plan, there's no such state. So we need to add an action where pos14 is not clear or the agent visits pos55.

3. Agent must be at pos12 in some state. Satisfied by final step.

4. If agent is at pos12 in some state, there must be an earlier state where pos13 or pos14 is not clear. Since the agent is at pos12 in the final step, we need a prior state where pos13 or pos14 is not clear. Before the final step, pos13 was clear, and pos14 was clear. So this constraint is not met. So we need to have pos13 or pos14 not clear before the agent reaches pos12.

Other constraints:

5. Agent is never at pos11. Wait, no. The third constraint says "player1 is not at location pos11" in every state. But in our current plan, the agent moves to pos11. So this violates constraint 5. Oh no! That's a problem. Because the original plan has the agent moving to pos11, which is prohibited. So we need to find another way to push the stone from pos12 to pos13 without the agent ever being at pos11.

So the previous plan is invalid because it violates constraint 5. So we need to find another approach.

Let's rethink the steps. The agent cannot go to pos11. So pushing the stone from pos12 to pos13 must be done without the agent being at pos11. How else can the agent push the stone east to pos13?

Alternative approach: after the stone is at pos12, the agent is at pos22. Maybe the agent can move around to the east side of the stone. For example, move from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown), then to pos24, etc., but that seems long. Alternatively, from pos22, move dirright (down) to pos32, then move to pos33, pos34, etc. But how to get to the east side of the stone.

Alternatively, perhaps push the stone from pos12 to pos13 by approaching from the south. If the agent is at pos22 (south of pos12), can they push the stone north? Wait, pos12's north is pos11. So pushing north would move the stone to pos11, which is not helpful. Alternatively, pushing east from pos12 requires the agent to be west of the stone (pos11), but agent can't be there. Or south of the stone (pos22), and pushing east? Wait, the directions are a bit tricky. Let me clarify:

If the agent is south of the stone (at pos22), and the stone is at pos12, the direction from agent to stone is dirleft (up). Pushing in dirleft would move the stone to pos11. Not helpful. Alternatively, the agent could be east of the stone (pos13) and push west. But pos13 is a goal location, initially clear. So if the agent can reach pos13, they could push the stone from pos12 to pos13. But how?

To reach pos13, the agent would need to move from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown), then pos24, pos34, pos44, etc., but that's a long path. Alternatively, from pos22, move to pos23 (dirdown), then pos24, pos25, etc. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, after the stone is at pos12 and agent is at pos22, the agent can move to pos23 (dirdown from pos22), then to pos24, pos34, pos44, pos43, pos33, etc., but this seems complicated. Let's think differently.

Maybe instead of pushing the stone from pos32 to pos22 to pos12, find a different path. For example, push the stone west to pos31, then north to pos21, then east to pos22, etc. But pos31 is a non-goal. Not helpful. Alternatively, push the stone east to pos33, then north to pos23, etc. But pos33 is non-goal.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. Let's think again. The agent starts at pos42. Stone at pos32. Goal is pos13. Constraints must be met.

Another approach: the agent moves north to pos32 (but pos32 is occupied by the stone, so can't move there. So must push. So initial push must be to move the stone north or east or west or south. Let's see:

From pos42, the agent can push the stone north to pos22 (as before), but that requires the pushtonongoal action. Alternatively, push the stone east to pos33. Is that possible? Let's check movement directions. From pos42, moving dirright (down) to pos52? No. Wait, movement from pos42: "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft" (left), "You may move from location pos42 to location pos52 following direction dirright" (right?), "You may move from location pos42 to location pos41 following direction dirup" (column -1), and "You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown" (column +1). Wait, directions are a bit confusing. Let me recheck:

The movement from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft. So dirleft is row -1 (up). pos42 is row 4, column 2. pos32 is row 3, column 2. So dirleft decreases the row by 1. Similarly, moving dirright from pos42 would increase the row by 1, which is pos52 (row 5, column 2), but pos52 is a different location. So to push the stone east to pos33 (column 3), the agent would need to be west of the stone. But the stone is at pos32 (row 3, column 2). To push it east to pos33 (column 3), the agent needs to be west of the stone (pos31) and push east. But the agent is at pos42. How to get to pos31?

Alternatively, the agent can push the stone east from pos32 to pos33 by being south of the stone. So agent at pos42, stone at pos32. To push east, the agent needs to be west of the stone (pos31), but that's not possible. Alternatively, if the agent is at pos33 (east of the stone), and push west. But the agent can't get to pos33 directly from pos42.

This seems complicated. Maybe the original path is the way to go, but we need to adjust for the constraints.

Let's return to the constraints:

Constraint 5: player1 is never at pos11. So the previous plan's step of moving to pos11 is invalid. So we need to find another way to push the stone from pos12 to pos13 without going to pos11.

Alternative idea: after the stone is at pos12, the agent is at pos22. Then, the agent moves to pos23 (dirdown from pos22), then pos24, pos34, pos44, pos43, pos33, pos23, pos13. Then, from pos13, push the stone west to pos12 to pos13. But wait, the stone is already at pos12. To push it to pos13, the agent needs to be west of pos12 (pos11) or south (pos22) or north (pos21) or east (pos13). If the agent is at pos13, which is east of pos12, then the direction from agent to stone is dirup (left). Pushing in dirup would move the stone west to pos11. Not helpful. But if the agent is at pos13, can they push the stone east? No, because the stone is at pos12. The agent would need to be west of the stone to push it east.

So, perhaps the agent needs to make a detour to get to pos13, then move to pos12 from the east. But pos12 is occupied by the stone. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, the agent could push the stone from pos12 to pos13 by being south of the stone (pos22) and pushing north (dirleft), but that moves the stone to pos11. Not helpful.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let's think of another approach. Maybe instead of taking the stone all the way up to pos12, we can find a different path. For example, push the stone from pos32 to pos33 (east), then to pos34, pos44, etc. But the goal is pos13. That's not helpful.

Alternatively, push the stone west to pos31, then north to pos21, then east to pos22, pos23, etc. But that's a longer path.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can push the stone to pos22, then to pos23, pos24, pos14, pos13. But pos14 is not a goal, but pos13 is. Let's see:

From pos22, push the stone to pos23 (dirdown from pos22 to pos23). Then from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown), then to pos34 (dirright), etc. But this seems longer.

But this may help satisfy some constraints. For example, if the stone is at pos14 at some point, that could make pos14 not clear, satisfying constraint 2 (if pos13 is not clear, need pos14 not clear earlier). But this is getting too vague.

Alternatively, let's look at the constraints and see which ones we can satisfy with minimal steps.

Constraint 6: "Location pos11 is not clear" can hold in at most one continuous sequence. So we need to ensure that pos11 is not clear only once.

Constraint 7: player1 must be at pos41 in at least one state. So the agent needs to visit pos41 at some point.

Constraint 8: pos22 is not clear in at least one state. That's satisfied when the stone is at pos22.

Constraint 9: If pos22 is not clear, there must be an earlier state where pos33 is not clear or stone1 is at pos41. In our original plan, pos22 is not clear after the first push. So we need to have either pos33 not clear or stone1 at pos41 before that. Initially, pos33 is clear, and stone is at pos32. So we need to have an action where pos33 is not clear or the stone is moved to pos41 before the first push.

But stone1 is at pos32 initially. To get it to pos41 would require pushing it west to pos31, then north to pos21, then west to pos11, etc. That's a long way. Alternatively, make pos33 not clear by having the agent move there. But pos33 is initially clear. So the agent can move to pos33, making it not clear. So if before the first push, the agent moves to pos33, making it not clear, then that would satisfy constraint 8's implication. Let's see:

Original plan starts with pushing from pos42 to pos32 to pos22. Before that, if the agent moves to pos33, making pos33 not clear, then when pos22 becomes not clear (stone there), the earlier state of pos33 not clear would satisfy constraint 8's requirement.

But this adds steps. Let's outline:

1. move player1 pos42 to pos43 (dirdown), then to pos44, pos34, pos33. But this is a long path. Alternatively, from pos42, can the agent reach pos33 directly? Let's check movement:

From pos42, possible moves are:

- dirleft to pos32 (stone's initial location, not clear)
- dirright to pos52 (clear)
- dirup to pos41 (clear)
- dirdown to pos43 (clear)

So to get to pos33, the agent needs to go through pos43. From pos42, move dirdown to pos43. Then from pos43, move dirleft to pos33. So:

Action 1: move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown.

Action 2: move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft.

Now, pos33 is not clear (agent is there). Then, proceed to push the stone from pos32 to pos22 as before. This would satisfy constraint 8's requirement, as pos33 is not clear before pos22 becomes not clear.

But this adds two more actions. Then, the agent is at pos33. To push the stone from pos32 to pos22, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos32. From pos33, moving dirleft (up) to pos23, then dirleft to pos13? Not helpful. Alternatively, from pos33, move dirup to pos23, then dirleft to pos22. But how to get back to pos32.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, after moving to pos33, the agent can move to pos32 (if possible). But pos32 has the stone, so it's not clear. So the agent can't move there unless pushing. So from pos33, the agent could push the stone west to pos32 to pos22. Wait, the stone is at pos32. The agent is at pos33. The direction from pos33 to pos32 is dirleft (up). So pushing the stone from pos32 to pos22 would require the agent to be at pos33, direction dirleft. But the stone is at pos32. So the agent is at pos33, stone at pos32. To push west (dirleft) would require the direction from agent to stone is dirleft (from pos33 to pos32 is dirleft). Then, pushing the stone dirleft from pos32 would move it to pos22. So action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos22 dirleft. Preconditions:

1. Agent at pos33: yes.
2. Stone at pos32: yes.
3. pos22 clear: yes.
4. Can move from pos33 to pos32 via dirleft: yes (according to movement rules: "You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup"). Wait, no. The movement from pos33 to pos32 is via dirup. Because pos33 is row 3, column 3. pos32 is row 3, column 2. So moving dirup (column -1) would take the agent from pos33 to pos32. So the direction is dirup, not dirleft. Therefore, the action would need to be pushtonongoal with direction dirup.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me recheck the movement rules for pos33:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft" (row 3 to 2)
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright" (row 3 to 4)
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup" (column 3 to 2)
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown" (column 3 to 4)

So from pos33 to pos32, direction is dirup (column -1). So the agent at pos33 can move dirup to pos32. But pos32 is occupied by the stone. So the agent can't move there unless pushing.

So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos22 dirup. Because the direction from agent (pos33) to stone (pos32) is dirup. Then, pushing in dirup direction would move the stone from pos32 to pos22 (since dirup from pos32 is row 3-1=2, column 2, so pos22).

Yes. So this action is valid. Preconditions:

1. Agent at pos33: yes.
2. Stone at pos32: yes.
3. pos22 clear: yes.
4. Can move from pos33 to pos32 via dirup: yes.
5. Can move from pos32 to pos22 via dirup: yes (since from pos32, moving dirup (column -1) would be pos22? Wait, no. pos32 is row 3, column 2. dirup decreases the column by 1, so column 1. So pos32 dirup is pos31. Wait, no. I'm getting confused again. Let me clarify:

The movement directions are as follows:

- dirright: row +1 (down)
- dirleft: row -1 (up)
- dirdown: column +1 (right)
- dirup: column -1 (left)

So from pos32 (row 3, column 2):

- dirright: row 4, column 2 → pos42
- dirleft: row 2, column 2 → pos22
- dirdown: column 3 → pos33
- dirup: column 1 → pos31

Wait, no. Wait, for example, "You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft". So dirleft from pos32 (row 3, column 2) takes you to pos22 (row 2, column 2). So dirleft is row -1. So when the agent is at pos33 (row 3, column 3) and pushes the stone at pos32 (row 3, column 2) with direction dirup (column -1), the stone would move to pos31 (row 3, column 1). That's not helpful. But we want to push it to pos22. So perhaps this approach isn't working.

Alternatively, the agent at pos33 needs to push the stone west (dirup) to pos31. But that's not helpful. So perhaps this path isn't useful.

This is getting quite complex. Let's try to adjust the initial plan to meet all constraints.

Original plan (invalid due to pos11 visit and constraint violations):

1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft → agent at pos32, stone at pos22.
2. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft → agent at pos22, stone at pos12.
3. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup → agent at pos21.
4. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft → agent at pos11 (violates constraint 5).
5. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown → stone at pos13.

To avoid step 4, we need a different way to push from pos12 to pos13.

Alternative approach after step 2:

After step 2, agent is at pos22, stone at pos12. We need to push the stone east to pos13. How?

Perhaps the agent can move east from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown), then to pos24, pos34, pos44, pos43, pos33, pos23, pos13. Then, from pos13, push the stone west to pos12. But pos12 is already occupied by the stone. Alternatively, from pos13, push the stone east to pos14, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, after step 2, agent is at pos22. Let's find another path to push the stone east.

Wait, from pos22, the agent can move dirright (down) to pos32. But pos32 is clear after step 1. So agent moves to pos32. Then, move dirright (down) to pos42. Then, move dirright (down) to pos52. Then move up to pos53, etc. But this seems not helpful.

Alternatively, from pos22, the agent can move to pos23 (dirdown), then pos24, pos34, pos44, pos43, pos33, pos23, pos13. Once at pos13, the agent can push the stone from pos12 to pos13 by being east of it. But the agent is at pos13, direction from agent to stone is dirup (west). So pushing dirup would move the stone west to pos11. Not helpful.

Alternatively, the agent could move to pos14 and then push north, but pos14 is not a goal.

This is really tricky. Let's think about the constraints again and see if we can satisfy them in another way.

Constraint 7: player1 must be at pos41 in at least one state. So we need to include a move to pos41 in the plan.

Constraint 9: At least one state where pos33 is not clear or agent is at pos34.

Constraint 10: At least one state where pos34 is not clear or pos25 is not clear.

Constraint 11: Stone1 is never at pos12.

Wait, no. Constraint 11 is "stone1 is not at location pos12" in every state. But in our plan, the stone is moved to pos12, which violates this constraint. Oh no! So that's another problem. The initial plan moves the stone to pos12, which is prohibited. So the entire previous plan is invalid.

This is a critical mistake. The constraint says "stone1 is not at location pos12" must hold in every state. So the stone can never be at pos12. Therefore, our previous approach of moving the stone to pos12 is invalid.

This changes everything. So the stone cannot be moved to pos12. Therefore, we need to find a different path to pos13 that doesn't involve pos12.

So we need to move the stone from pos32 to pos13 without passing through pos12. How?

Possible path: pos32 → pos33 → pos34 → pos24 → pos14 → pos13. But pos14 is a non-goal. Then push to pos13 (goal).

Let's see if this path is possible.

Step 1: Push stone from pos32 to pos33 (east). Agent is at pos42, stone at pos32. To push east, agent needs to be west of the stone. So agent must be at pos31, but pos31 is clear. Alternatively, agent can approach from the south. Wait, pos32's east is pos33. To push east, the agent needs to be west of the stone (pos31) and push east (dirdown), or north/south.

Wait, the agent is at pos42. To push the stone east to pos33, the agent needs to be west of the stone (pos31), south (pos42), or north (pos22).

If agent is south of the stone (pos42), pushing north (dirleft) would move the stone to pos22, as before. But we can't push east from pos32 unless the agent is west of the stone. So agent needs to get to pos31 to push east.

But pos31 is clear. So agent can move from pos42 to pos41 (dirup), then to pos31 (dirleft).

So:

1. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup.
2. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft.
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown. Because the direction from agent (pos31) to stone (pos32) is dirdown (east). Then, the stone moves dirdown (east) from pos32 to pos33.

Check preconditions:

1. Agent at pos31: yes.
2. Stone at pos32: yes.
3. pos33 is clear: yes.
4. Can move from pos31 to pos32 via dirdown: pos31 to pos32 is allowed via dirdown? Looking at the movement rules for pos31: "You may move from location pos31 to location pos21 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos31 to location pos41 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos31 to location pos32 following direction dirdown". Yes. So direction dirdown from pos31 to pos32.
5. Can move from pos32 to pos33 via dirdown: pos32 to pos33 is allowed via dirdown? Yes, from pos32: "You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown".
6. pos33 is not a goal: correct.

After this, agent is at pos32, stone at pos33.

Next step: push stone from pos33 to pos34 (east). Agent needs to be west of the stone (pos32). Agent is at pos32. So action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown. Preconditions:

1. Agent at pos32: yes.
2. Stone at pos33: yes.
3. pos34 is clear: yes.
4. Can move from pos32 to pos33 via dirdown: yes.
5. Can move from pos33 to pos34 via dirdown: yes.
6. pos34 is not a goal: correct.

After this, agent at pos33, stone at pos34.

Next step: push stone from pos34 to pos24 (north). Agent needs to be south of the stone. Agent is at pos33. To get south of pos34, agent can move to pos34's south (pos44). But pos34's south is pos44. So agent needs to move from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown), but stone is at pos34. So can't move there. Alternatively, move to pos43, then pos44.

Alternatively, agent is at pos33. To push stone north from pos34 to pos24, agent needs to be south of pos34. So agent moves to pos44 (south of pos34). Let's plan:

4. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown → but pos34 has the stone. So invalid.
Alternative path: move from pos33 to pos43 (dirright down?), then to pos44. Let's check movement options from pos33: "You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown". So from pos33, move dirright (down) to pos43.

5. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright.
6. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown.
7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos24 dirleft. Because dirleft from pos44 to pos34 is up. Then, pushing dirleft from pos34 to pos24. Check preconditions:

1. Agent at pos44: yes.
2. Stone at pos34: yes.
3. pos24 is clear: yes.
4. Can move from pos44 to pos34 via dirleft: yes (from pos44, dirleft is up to pos34).
5. Can move from pos34 to pos24 via dirleft: yes (from pos34, dirleft is up to pos24).
6. pos24 is not a goal: correct.

After this, agent at pos34, stone at pos24.

Next step: push stone from pos24 to pos14 (north). Agent at pos34. To push north, agent needs to be south of pos24. So agent at pos34 can push north (dirleft) to pos24 → pos14.

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos14 dirleft. Preconditions:

1. Agent at pos34: yes.
2. Stone at pos24: yes.
3. pos14 is clear: yes.
4. Can move from pos34 to pos24 via dirleft: yes.
5. Can move from pos24 to pos14 via dirleft: yes.
6. pos14 is not a goal: correct.

Agent moves to pos24, stone at pos14.

Next step: push stone from pos14 to pos13 (west). Agent is at pos24. To push west, agent needs to be east of pos14. So agent at pos24 can push west (dirup) to pos14, then stone moves west to pos13.

Action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos14 pos13 dirup. Because pos13 is a goal. Preconditions:

1. Agent at pos24: yes.
2. Stone at pos14: yes.
3. pos13 is clear: yes.
4. Can move from pos24 to pos14 via dirup: yes (dirup from pos24 is column -1, pos14 is row 2, column 4 → wait, no. pos24 is row 2, column 4. dirup from pos24 would be column -1, so column 3 → pos23. Wait, this is confusing again.

Wait, pos24 is row 2, column 4. To move to pos14 (row 1, column 4), the direction is dirleft (row -1). So from pos24, dirleft would take you to pos14. So the agent is at pos24, direction dirleft to pos14. Then, pushing the stone from pos14 to pos13 via dirdown (east). Because pos13 is east of pos14.

So action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos14 pos13 dirdown. Preconditions:

1. Agent at pos24: yes.
2. Stone at pos14: yes.
3. pos13 is clear: yes.
4. Can move from pos24 to pos14 via dirleft: yes (from pos24 to pos14 is dirleft).
5. Can move from pos14 to pos13 via dirdown: yes (from pos14, dirdown is column +1 to pos15? No. pos14 is row 1, column 4. dirdown is column +1, so column 5 → pos15. Wait, no. pos13 is row 1, column 3. So from pos14 (row 1, column 4), dirdown (column +1) would be column 5 → pos15. To get to pos13, which is column 3, need to move west. So direction dirup (column -1).

This is getting too confusing. Let me recheck the movement from pos14:

"You may move from location pos14 to location pos24 following direction dirright" (down), "You may move from location pos14 to location pos13 following direction dirup" (column -1), "You may move from location pos14 to location pos15 following direction dirdown" (column +1).

So from pos14, dirup is column -1 → pos13. So to push from pos14 to pos13, direction is dirup.

So the agent needs to be east of pos14 (pos15) to push west, or south (pos24), north (pos13), or west (pos13). Wait, the agent is at pos24. To push the stone from pos14 to pos13, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos14. So agent at pos24 (south of pos14), direction dirleft (up) to pos14. Then, pushing dirup (column -1) from pos14 to pos13.

So the action is pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos14 pos13 dirleft. Because the agent is at pos24, direction dirleft to pos14. Then, pushing dirleft from pos14 to pos13.

Check preconditions:

1. Agent at pos24: yes.
2. Stone at pos14: yes.
3. pos13 is clear: yes.
4. Can move from pos24 to pos14 via dirleft: yes.
5. Can move from pos14 to pos13 via dirleft: yes.
6. pos13 is a goal: yes.

After this action, stone is at pos13 (goal), agent is at pos14.

Now, let's check constraints:

1. pos13 is not clear in at least one state: satisfied.
2. If pos13 is not clear, earlier state with pos14 not clear or agent at pos55. In this plan, pos14 becomes not clear when the stone is pushed there. So before pos13 is not clear, pos14 was not clear. So this condition is satisfied.
3. Agent at pos12: no. This plan doesn't have agent at pos12. So constraint 3 is not met. Need to adjust.
4. If agent at pos12, earlier state with pos13 or pos14 not clear. But since we don't have agent at pos12, this constraint is not triggered. But we need to satisfy constraint 3: agent must be at pos12 in some state.

So this plan fails constraint 3. Therefore, we need to ensure the agent visits pos12.

Additionally, other constraints:

5. Agent never at pos11: satisfied.
7. Agent at pos41: not yet. Need to include a move to pos41.

8. pos22 not clear in at least one state: in this plan, pos22 remains clear. So need to include a step where pos22 is not clear. But the stone is at pos32 → pos33 → pos34 → pos24 → pos14 → pos13. So pos22 is never occupied. So this constraint is violated.

Hmm, this is getting very complicated. Let's recap the constraints:

Constraints:

1. pos13 not clear in at least one state. Satisfied.

2. If pos13 not clear, then earlier state with pos14 not clear or agent at pos55. Satisfied because pos14 is not clear before pos13.

3. Agent at pos12 in some state. Not satisfied.

4. If agent at pos12, earlier state with pos13 or pos14 not clear. Not applicable yet.

5. Agent never at pos11. Satisfied.

6. pos11 not clear in at most one continuous sequence. Not triggered.

7. Agent at pos41 in some state. Not satisfied.

8. pos22 not clear in at least one state. Not satisfied.

9. At least one state with pos33 not clear or agent at pos34. In this plan, pos33 is not clear when agent is there. Yes, when agent moves to pos33.

10. At least one state with pos34 not clear or pos25 not clear. pos34 is not clear when stone is there. Yes.

11. Stone never at pos12. Satisfied.

12. At least one state with stone at pos41 or pos52 not clear. Not satisfied.

So additional constraints to meet:

3. Agent at pos12.

7. Agent at pos41.

8. pos22 not clear.

12. Either stone at pos41 or pos52 not clear.

To meet constraint 3, we need to have the agent visit pos12 at some point. But how, since the stone is not allowed to be there. Perhaps after delivering the stone to pos13, the agent can move to pos12. But pos12 is clear after the stone is at pos13.

So after the final action, agent is at pos14. From pos14, agent can move to pos13 (dirup), then to pos12 (dirup). But pos13 is occupied by the stone. So can't move there. Alternatively, move from pos14 to pos24 (dirright), then pos23, pos22, pos12. But pos22 is clear. Let's see:

From pos14, agent can move to pos24 (dirright). Then to pos23 (dirdown), pos22 (dirup), pos12 (dirleft). But pos22 and pos12 are clear. So:

Action: move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright.

Action: move player1 pos24 pos23 dirdown.

Action: move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup.

Action: move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft.

This gets the agent to pos12, satisfying constraint 3. But we need to ensure that when the agent is at pos12, there was an earlier state where pos13 or pos14 was not clear. In this case, pos13 is not clear (stone there) and pos14 was not clear earlier. So this satisfies constraint 4.

Also, constraint 7: agent must visit pos41. In the current plan, the agent starts at pos42, moves to pos41 in step 1. So step 1 is move to pos41. So yes, that satisfies constraint 7.

Constraint 8: pos22 must be not clear in some state. In the current plan, pos22 remains clear unless we have the agent move there. So we need to make pos22 not clear. Perhaps by having the agent visit pos22 and then leave, but that doesn't make it not clear. Alternatively, perhaps push a different stone there, but there's only one stone. So this is impossible. Therefore, to satisfy constraint 8, we need to have pos22 not clear, but the only stone is at pos13. So this can't be done. Therefore, we must find another way to satisfy constraint 8, which requires that pos22 is not clear in at least one state. But with only one stone, which is at pos13, this is impossible. Wait, no. The initial stone is at pos32, but in the plan we push it to pos33, pos34, pos24, pos14, pos13. So pos22 is never occupied. Therefore, constraint 8 is not satisfied. So this plan is invalid.

Therefore, we need to adjust the plan to have pos22 not clear at some point. The only way is to push the stone there. But the constraint 11 says stone1 can't be at pos12, but pos22 is allowed. So perhaps in the earlier steps, push the stone to pos22.

But earlier steps involve pushing the stone from pos32 to pos33. Maybe instead of that, push it to pos22 first.

Let's try a different approach:

1. Move agent to pos41 to satisfy constraint 7.

Action 1: move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup.

2. Move agent to pos31.

Action 2: move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft.

3. Push stone from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft from pos31).

Action 3: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos22 dirleft.

Now, pos22 is not clear (stone there), satisfying constraint 8.

Now, constraint 8's implication: if pos22 is not clear, there must be an earlier state where pos33 is not clear or stone1 is at pos41. In this case, the stone is at pos22 after action 3. The earlier states are actions 1 and 2. In action 1, agent is at pos41 (satisfies "player1 is at pos41" for constraint 7). But for constraint 8's implication, we need either pos33 not clear or stone1 at pos41 before action 3. However, stone1 is at pos32 initially and moves to pos22. So it's never at pos41. So we need to have pos33 not clear before action 3. How?

Perhaps after action 2, agent moves to pos33.

Revised steps:

1. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup.

2. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft.

3. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirleft (but pos32 has stone, so can't move there. So push instead.

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown.

Now, stone is at pos33, agent at pos32. This makes pos33 not clear, satisfying constraint 8's implication if we later push to pos22.

Then, push stone from pos33 to pos22.

But how? From pos32, agent can push stone from pos33 to pos22 by being east of the stone. So agent at pos32, stone at pos33. To push west, agent needs to be east of the stone. So agent is at pos34, but that's not possible. Alternatively, agent is south of the stone (pos33's south is pos43). So agent moves to pos43, then push north to pos33 to pos23. But that's not helpful.

This is getting too tangled. Let's try to integrate all constraints step by step.

Final Plan Attempt:

1. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup → satisfy constraint 7.
2. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft.
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown → stone at pos33, agent at pos32. Now, pos33 not clear (satisfies constraint 8's implication when pos22 is not clear later).
4. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown → agent at pos33 (pos33 not clear).
5. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright → agent at pos43.
6. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown → agent at pos44.
7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos24 dirleft → stone at pos24, agent at pos34.
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos14 dirleft → stone at pos14, agent at pos24.
9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos14 pos13 dirleft → stone at pos13, agent at pos14.
10. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright.
11. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirdown.
12. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup.
13. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft → agent at pos12 (satisfies constraint 3).

Now, check constraints:

1. pos13 not clear: yes.

2. When pos13 is not clear, earlier state pos14 not clear (when stone was at pos14).

3. Agent at pos12: yes.

4. When agent at pos12, earlier state pos14 not clear (stone at pos14).

5. Agent never at pos11: yes.

6. pos11 not clear: not triggered.

7. Agent at pos41: yes (step 1).

8. pos22 not clear: in step 13, agent is at pos12, and pos22 is clear. But earlier step 12, agent is at pos22. But pos22 is clear when agent is there. So pos22 is never not clear. Therefore, constraint 8 not satisfied.

To satisfy constraint 8, we need to have pos22 not clear. The only way is to have the stone there. But in this plan, the stone is at pos33, pos24, pos14, pos13. So pos22 remains clear. Therefore, this plan is invalid.

Alternative idea: after step 3, push the stone to pos22.

Let's try:

1. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup → pos41 visited.
2. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft.
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos22 dirleft → stone at pos22, agent at pos32.

Now, pos22 not clear (satisfies constraint 8).

Constraint 8's implication: there must be an earlier state where pos33 not clear or stone at pos41. In this case, before step 3, the stone is at pos32, so stone is not at pos41. pos33 is clear. So this violates the constraint. So need to have pos33 not clear before step 3.

So after step 2, move to pos33:

1. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup.
2. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft.
3. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown → can't, since pos32 has stone. So must push.
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown → stone at pos33, agent at pos32.
4. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown → agent at pos33.
5. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup → agent at pos32.
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos22 dirleft → stone at pos22, agent at pos33.

Now, pos22 is not clear (step 6). Before this, pos33 was not clear (step 4 and 5), satisfying constraint 8's implication.

Then proceed to move stone from pos22 to pos13:

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos22 pos12 dirleft → but this moves stone to pos12, which is prohibited (constraint 11). So invalid.

Thus, this approach also fails.

Given the time constraints, I'll try to compile a possible plan that meets as many constraints as possible, noting that this is a challenging problem.

Final Answer:

```
move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos22 dirleft
move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown
```

But this plan violates constraints 5 (agent at pos11) and 11 (stone at pos12). Therefore, it's invalid.

After several iterations, the correct plan must involve moving the stone from pos32 to pos22 to pos23 to pos24 to pos14 to pos13 while visiting required positions and satisfying all constraints. Given the complexity and time limitations, here's a tentative plan that may not satisfy all constraints but is an attempt:

```
move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos32 pos33 dirright
move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos34 dirright
move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos24 dirleft
move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos13 dirleft
move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
move player1 pos24 pos23 dirdown
move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft
```

But this is likely incorrect due to the complexity of constraints. The correct plan would require careful step-by-step validation against each constraint, which is time-consuming and beyond the current scope.
