Okay, let's see. I need to get stone1 to a goal location. The only goal location is pos55. So stone1 is currently at pos32. The agent is at pos24. So I need to figure out how to move the agent to push the stone all the way to pos55.

First, let me visualize the grid. The locations are named with posXY, where X is the row and Y is the column. So pos55 is the bottom-right corner. Stone1 is at pos32 (row 3, column 2). The agent starts at pos24 (row 2, column4).

Hmm. To push the stone to pos55, which is in row5, column5. So the stone needs to move down and right. Let me see the possible moves.

The movement directions are up, down, left, right. But for pushing, the agent needs to be adjacent to the stone in the direction opposite to where the stone is moving. For example, to push the stone down, the agent needs to be above it. Then, pushing it down would move the agent into the stone's original position, and the stone moves down.

Let's see the path from pos32 to pos55. Let's think about the route. From pos32, the stone can go right to pos42, then down to pos52, then right to pos53, then down to pos54, then right to pos55. Wait, but the movement directions might be limited by the allowed moves mentioned in the problem. Let me check the movement paths.

Looking at the allowed movements from the original state:

For pos32, the allowed moves are:
- You may move from location pos32 to pos22 (dirleft), pos42 (dirright), pos31 (dirup), pos33 (dirdown). Wait, but the directions are a bit confusing. The 'dirright' might correspond to moving east (right), so from pos32 (3,2) moving right would take it to pos42 (4,2)? Or maybe the grid is rows and columns differently. Wait, perhaps the first digit is the row (like Y-axis) and the second is the column (X-axis). So pos32 is row3, column2. Moving right (dirright) would increase the column by 1, so to pos33? No, wait, looking at the movement list:

Looking at the given movement possibilities:

For example, "You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft" — pos32 to pos22 is moving left (dirleft) which would decrease the column? Or perhaps rows and columns are arranged such that pos32 to pos22 is up? Wait, maybe the movement directions are as follows:

Wait, pos22 is up from pos32? Or maybe it's the other way around. Let me think. For instance, moving from pos32 to pos22: the row decreases by 1 (from 3 to 2), so that's moving up (dirup?), but the direction given here is dirleft. Hmm, maybe the directions are not directly aligned with rows and columns. Let me check some of the given moves to see the pattern.

Looking at the movement from pos24:

"You may move from location pos24 to pos14 (dirleft), pos34 (dirright), pos23 (dirup), pos25 (dirdown)."

So, pos24 is row2, column4. Moving dirleft takes you to pos14 (row1, column4) — so that's moving up? Or perhaps the first digit is the X-coordinate and the second is Y. Wait, maybe the positions are in a grid where the first digit is X (east-west) and the second is Y (north-south). So pos24 is X=2, Y=4. Moving dirleft would decrease X by 1 (to X=1, Y=4) which is pos14. Similarly, dirright increases X by 1 (pos34). Dirup increases Y by 1 (pos25 is X=2, Y=5?), but wait pos24 to pos23 is dirup? Wait, pos23 is X=2, Y=3. So maybe dirup decreases Y, and dirdown increases Y. Because moving from pos24 (X=2, Y=4) to pos23 (X=2, Y=3) is dirup. So dirup is north (decreasing Y), dirdown is south (increasing Y), dirleft is west (decreasing X), dirright is east (increasing X).

So, directions:

- dirleft: X decreases by 1 (west)
- dirright: X increases by 1 (east)
- dirup: Y decreases by 1 (north)
- dirdown: Y increases by 1 (south)

So, pos32 is X=3, Y=2. To move the stone to pos55 (X=5, Y=5), the stone needs to go east (X increases) and south (Y increases). The agent needs to get to the opposite side of the stone's current position to push it in the desired direction.

Starting at pos24 (X=2, Y=4), the agent needs to navigate to a position adjacent to the stone (pos32) to push it. Let's see the path from pos24 to pos32's adjacent positions.

The stone is at pos32. To push it east (dirright) to pos42, the agent needs to be at pos32's west (pos22) and push east. Alternatively, to push it south (dirdown) to pos33, the agent needs to be north (pos32's dirup is pos31). Wait, pos32's dirup would be pos22 (since moving dirup from pos32 is Y decreases by 1: pos32 (X=3, Y=2) → dirup is Y=1? Wait, maybe I need to clarify the coordinates again.

Wait, perhaps the positions are named with the first digit as the row (Y-axis) and the second as the column (X-axis). For example, pos24 is row 2, column 4. Then moving dirup would decrease the row, dirright would increase the column.

But looking at the movement from pos24:

- move to pos14 (dirleft): same row (2) → no. Wait, pos14 is row 1, column 4. So moving from pos24 (row 2, column4) to pos14 (row1, column4) would be dirleft. So dirleft here is moving up (row decreases). Then dirright from pos24 is pos34 (row3, column4). Hmm, this seems inconsistent. Wait, perhaps the directions are not directly mapped to rows and columns but are based on movement in a grid where each position is connected in specific directions as per the given allowed moves. So maybe I should just follow the allowed moves as per the problem statement.

Let's think about how to get the agent from pos24 to a position where they can push stone1 at pos32. The stone is at pos32, and the agent is at pos24. The allowed moves for pos24 include moving to pos34 (dirright) or pos25 (dirdown), etc. Let's see possible paths.

From pos24, possible moves are:

- dirleft to pos14 (row1, column4)
- dirright to pos34 (row3, column4)
- dirup to pos23 (row2, column3)
- dirdown to pos25 (row2, column5)

Wait, maybe the movement from pos24 to pos34 (dirright) is east, increasing the row number? Not sure. The key is that the allowed moves are given, so I need to see the possible path from pos24 to pos32's adjacent positions.

The stone is at pos32. The adjacent positions to pos32, according to the allowed moves from pos32 are:

- pos22 (dirleft)
- pos42 (dirright)
- pos31 (dirup)
- pos33 (dirdown)

So the agent needs to get to one of these positions to push the stone. Let's see which of these positions are clear. The initial state says that pos32 is clear (since "Location pos32 is clear" is part of the initial state). Wait, the agent is at pos24, and pos24 is clear (since "Location pos24 is clear" in the original state). Wait, the original state says "player1 is at location pos24" and "Location pos24 is clear" — wait, that's a contradiction. Wait, no. If the agent is at pos24, then pos24 is not clear. But in the initial state, it's stated:

Original state includes:

"player1 is at location pos24"

"Location pos24 is clear"

Wait, that can't be. Because if the agent is at pos24, then pos24 is occupied by the agent, so it's not clear. But according to the problem statement, the original state says "Location pos24 is clear". That's a mistake? Or maybe the 'clear' refers to not having stones. Wait, the problem states: "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So 'clear' means that the location is empty. So if the agent is at pos24, then pos24 is not clear. But the problem's original state says "Location pos24 is clear". Hmm, this seems like an error. Let me check the original state again.

Looking back: The original state says:

"player1 is at location pos24"

"Location pos24 is clear"

That's conflicting. Unless 'clear' here means no stones, but the agent's presence doesn't affect it. Wait, the problem says: "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty. Each position is flagged as either a goal position or a non-goal position."

So, if the agent is at pos24, then pos24 is occupied by the agent, so it's not clear. But according to the original state, the user lists "Location pos24 is clear" — that must be an error. But perhaps in the problem's setup, the agent's location is considered clear? Or maybe the 'clear' predicate only refers to stones. Wait, the problem's preconditions for "move" action say that the destination must be clear. So, if the agent is moving to a location, that location must be clear (i.e., not have a stone or another agent). So in the initial state, pos24 has the agent, so it's not clear. But the original state says "Location pos24 is clear". This is a contradiction. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem description, but perhaps the user intended that the agent is at pos24 and that location is not clear. But according to the given original state, it's listed as clear. Hmm. This might be a problem. But perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the original state is correctly specified. Wait, perhaps the 'clear' refers to the absence of stones, and the agent's presence is separate. For example, a location is clear if there's no stone there. So the agent being present doesn't affect the 'clear' status. That would make sense. So the 'clear' condition for movement refers to there being no stones in the location. Because in the move action's preconditions: (ii) location l_to is clear. So when moving, the destination must be clear of stones. But if the agent is moving there, then after moving, the agent is there. But maybe the 'clear' predicate only refers to stones. That would resolve the contradiction. So in the original state, pos24 is clear (no stones), but the agent is present. So when moving to a location, it's allowed if there's no stone there, even if the agent is there. Wait, but in the move action's effects, after moving, the destination is no longer clear. But if 'clear' refers to stones, then moving the agent to a location wouldn't make it not clear. This seems conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps 'clear' means that neither the agent nor a stone is present. So if a location is clear, it's empty. So the initial state says that pos24 is clear, but the agent is there. That's a contradiction, which suggests a possible error in the problem setup. Alternatively, maybe the 'clear' in the original state refers to the absence of stones, and the agent's presence is tracked separately. So when the move action requires the destination to be clear, it's checking for stones, not the agent. That would make sense. For example, the agent can move to a location that has no stone, even if another agent is there. But in this problem, there's only one agent. So perhaps 'clear' refers to stones. So in the original state, pos24 is clear (no stone), and the agent is there. Then, when moving to a location, it's allowed as long as there's no stone. The presence of the agent doesn't block movement. But that doesn't make sense, because the agent can't be in two places at once. So this seems like a problem with the problem description. However, given that the user provided this as the original state, I'll have to work with it. So, perhaps the 'clear' refers to stones only. So when the move action's precondition says the destination must be clear, it's referring to no stones. So the agent can move to a location even if another agent is there. But since there's only one agent, that's not an issue. Therefore, the initial state is that pos24 is clear (no stone) and the agent is there. Then, the move actions can be performed as per the preconditions.

But this is a bit confusing. However, given that the problem states the original state includes "player1 is at location pos24" and "Location pos24 is clear", I have to accept that as the initial setup.

So, the agent is at pos24, and pos24 is clear (no stone). So, to move from pos24, the agent can move to any adjacent location that is clear (no stone) and has a valid move direction. Let's proceed.

The stone is at pos32. The goal is to get it to pos55 (the only goal location). So the plan is to push the stone from pos32 to pos55.

First, the agent needs to reach a position adjacent to the stone to push it. Let's see possible paths.

From pos24, the agent can move to pos34 (dirright), then to pos44 (dirright again?), but let's see the allowed moves.

The allowed moves from pos24 are:

- move to pos14 (dirleft)
- move to pos34 (dirright)
- move to pos23 (dirup)
- move to pos25 (dirdown)

So pos24's neighbors are these four. Let's see how the agent can get to pos32's adjacent positions (pos22, pos42, pos31, pos33).

The stone is at pos32. To push it east (dirright) to pos42, the agent must be at pos32's west (pos22) and push east. Alternatively, to push it south (dirdown) to pos33, the agent must be at pos32's north (pos31) and push south.

Let's look at the path to reach pos22. pos22 is connected to pos12, pos32, pos21, and pos23. The agent is at pos24. Let's see possible moves.

From pos24, move dirup to pos23 (row2, column3). Then from pos23, possible moves include dirleft to pos13, dirright to pos33, dirup to pos22, dirdown to pos24. So moving from pos24 to pos23 (dirup), then from pos23 to pos22 (dirup). Then, from pos22, the agent can push the stone east to pos32 to pos42. Wait, but the stone is already at pos32. Wait, no. The stone is at pos32. So if the agent is at pos22, which is west of pos32, they can push the stone east (dirright) to pos42. But is pos42 clear? The initial state says pos42 is clear. So the agent can perform a pushtonongoal action, moving from pos22 to pos32 (pushing the stone to pos42). Wait, but pos42 is not a goal location. So using pushtonongoal. But we need to eventually push the stone to pos55, which is a goal. So perhaps pushing the stone east to pos42, then further east to pos52, then south to pos53, etc. But let's plan step by step.

Alternative approach: The agent moves from pos24 to pos34 (dirright), then to pos44 (dirright), then to pos54 (dirright), then to pos55 (dirdown?), but wait. Let's check the movement possibilities.

From pos24, dirright to pos34. From pos34, dirright to pos44. From pos44, dirright to pos54. From pos54, dirdown to pos55. But that's the agent moving to pos55. But how does that help? The stone is at pos32. Alternatively, the agent could move to pos32's east (pos42) to push the stone west, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, the agent needs to get north of the stone to push it south, or west to push east, etc.

Alternatively, the agent can move from pos24 to pos34 (dirright), then to pos33 (dirdown?), wait, pos34's allowed moves: looking at the original state's movement list.

Looking for movements from pos34:

"You may move from location pos34 to pos24 (dirleft), pos44 (dirright), pos33 (dirup), pos35 (dirdown)."

So from pos34, moving dirup (which is north) to pos33. So from pos34, move dirup to pos33. Then from pos33, possible moves?

From pos33, you can move to pos23 (dirleft), pos43 (dirright), pos32 (dirup), pos34 (dirdown). So from pos33, moving dirup (north) to pos32. Wait, pos32 is where the stone is. So the agent can't move into pos32 because it's occupied by the stone. Because the stone is there, so pos32 is not clear (since the stone is there). Wait, in the original state, "Location pos32 is clear". But the stone is at pos32. So that's a conflict. Wait, the original state says:

"stone1 is at location pos32"

"Location pos32 is clear"

Again, a contradiction. If a stone is at pos32, then pos32 is not clear. This must be a mistake in the problem description. So perhaps the user made a mistake here. Because if the stone is at pos32, then pos32 is not clear. But the original state says that pos32 is clear, which is conflicting. This is a problem. But since the user provided this as the initial state, I have to work with it. So perhaps 'clear' here refers to the agent not being present. Or maybe 'clear' is separate from stones. This is very confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the 'clear' predicate in the problem refers to the agent not being there. So when the agent is at a location, it's not clear. But stones are tracked separately. So, in the initial state, pos24 is clear (no stones), but the agent is there. So the 'clear' in the preconditions for move refers to the location not having a stone. So even if the agent is present, the location is considered clear for movement purposes. That might be the case.

But this is getting too tangled. Let's proceed with the given information, even if there's an inconsistency. The original state says:

"stone1 is at location pos32"

"Location pos32 is clear"

So according to this, pos32 is clear (no agent?), but the stone is there. So perhaps 'clear' means the agent is not present, but stones are allowed. So when moving, the destination must not have the agent, but stones are allowed. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the 'clear' refers to being free of both agents and stones. In which case, the original state has contradictions, but perhaps we have to ignore that and proceed.

In any case, the agent needs to push the stone from pos32 to pos55. Let's try to outline a path.

The stone is at pos32. The agent is at pos24. Possible steps:

1. Move agent from pos24 to pos34 (dirright). Preconditions: pos34 must be clear. The original state says pos34 is clear. So move player1 from pos24 to pos34 via dirright.

Action: move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright.

After this, agent is at pos34.

2. From pos34, move to pos33 (dirup). Because pos33 is clear (original state says pos33 is clear). So move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup.

3. Now agent is at pos33. Next, move dirup to pos32. But pos32 has the stone. So the agent can't move there. So instead, perhaps push the stone south (dirdown) to pos43. Wait, pos33 is south of pos32. Wait, no. pos32 is X=3, Y=2. pos33 is X=3, Y=3. So if the agent is at pos33 (X=3, Y=3), then to push the stone south (dirdown) would require the stone to be at pos33's north (Y=2?), but pos32 is X=3, Y=2. So the stone is at pos32. So the agent is at pos33, which is south of the stone. To push the stone north (dirup), the agent needs to be south of it. Wait, directions are dirup (north), dirdown (south), etc. If the agent is at pos33 (south of pos32), they can push the stone north (dirup) to pos22? No. Wait, pushing requires that the agent is adjacent to the stone in the direction opposite to where the stone is being pushed. For example, to push the stone east (dirright), the agent must be west of the stone. To push the stone south (dirdown), the agent must be north of the stone.

Wait, the direction in the push action refers to the direction from the agent's position to the stone's position. For example, in the pushtogoal action, the agent is at l_p, the stone is at l_from. The agent can push the stone to l_to, which is in direction d from l_from. So the direction d is from the stone's current position (l_from) to the destination (l_to). The agent must be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from in the direction opposite to d. For example, if the agent is pushing the stone east (d=dirright), then the agent must be west of the stone (l_p is west of l_from).

So, to push the stone from pos32 to pos42 (dirright), the agent needs to be at pos22 (west of pos32) and push east. Alternatively, to push it south (dirdown) to pos33, the agent must be north of pos32 (pos31) and push south.

But pos31 is clear (original state says pos31 is clear). So the agent could move to pos31 and push the stone south to pos33.

Let's see how to get the agent to pos31.

From pos24, possible moves:

Option 1:

pos24 → pos34 (dirright)

pos34 → pos33 (dirup)

pos33 → pos32 (dirup) → but pos32 has the stone, so cannot move there.

Alternatively, from pos34, move dirup to pos33, then dirleft to pos23 (dirleft). Then from pos23, move dirup to pos22. Then from pos22, move dirright to pos32. But again, pos32 has the stone. So this isn't helpful.

Alternative plan: agent moves from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown), then to pos35 (dirright), then to pos45 (dirright), then to pos55 (dirright). But that's just the agent moving to pos55, which is the goal location for the stone. Not helpful unless the agent can push the stone there.

But the stone is at pos32. So the agent needs to push it through the grid.

Alternative approach: push the stone east to pos42, then south to pos52, then east to pos53, then south to pos54, then east to pos55. Let's see if that path is possible.

To push east from pos32 to pos42:

Agent needs to be at pos32's west (pos22) and push east. So agent needs to get to pos22.

From pos24, the agent can move to pos23 (dirup), then to pos22 (dirup).

So:

Action 1: move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup.

Check preconditions: pos23 is clear (original state says yes).

Action 2: move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup.

Now agent is at pos22.

Then, push the stone from pos32 to pos42 (dirright). So:

Action 3: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright.

Preconditions check:

- Agent is at pos22 (yes after action2).

- Stone is at pos32 (yes).

- pos42 is clear (original state says yes).

- Can move from pos22 to pos32 following dirright? Wait, according to the allowed moves, from pos22 you can move to pos32 via dirright. Yes: "You may move from location pos22 to pos32 following direction dirright".

- From pos32 to pos42 via dirright: yes, allowed move "You may move from location pos32 to pos42 following direction dirright".

- pos42 is not a goal (correct, since pos42 is not a goal).

So this action is valid.

After this, stone1 is at pos42, and agent is at pos32.

Next step: push the stone east to pos52. So from pos42, push east to pos52. Agent needs to be west of pos42 (pos32) and push east.

Agent is currently at pos32. So:

Action4: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos52 dirright.

Check preconditions:

- Agent is at pos32 (yes, after action3's effect).

- Stone is at pos42 (yes, after action3).

- pos52 is clear (original state says pos52 is clear).

- Can move from pos32 to pos42 (yes, allowed direction dirright).

- From pos42 to pos52 via dirright: check allowed moves. Looking at the original state's movements, from pos42: "You may move from location pos42 to pos52 following direction dirright" (yes, if that's allowed). Wait, checking the list:

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos52 following direction dirright"

Yes. So the direction is allowed.

- pos52 is not a goal (correct).

So action4 is valid. Now stone is at pos52, agent at pos42.

Next, push the stone south to pos53. Because pos52 to pos53 is dirdown. So agent needs to be north of pos52 (pos42 is north of pos52? Wait, pos52's location is X=5, Y=2. To push south (dirdown) to pos53 (X=5, Y=3?), the agent needs to be north of pos52. Wait, the directions are a bit confusing. Let's clarify.

Wait, when pushing south (dirdown), the agent must be north of the stone. So if the stone is at pos52, to push it south to pos53, the agent needs to be at pos52's north, which is pos42. Because moving south from pos52 would take it to pos53. So the agent is at pos42, which is north of pos52. So can the agent push the stone south?

Yes. So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos52 pos53 dirdown.

Check preconditions:

- Agent at pos42 (yes, after action4).

- Stone at pos52 (yes).

- pos53 is clear (yes, per original state).

- Can move from pos42 to pos52 (dirright? Or is it dirsouth? Wait, pos42 is X=4, Y=2. pos52 is X=5, Y=2. So moving east (dirright) from pos42 to pos52. So the direction from pos42 to pos52 is dirright. But the direction for pushing is from the stone's current location to the destination, which is dirdown (south). So the agent is at pos42, the stone is at pos52. The agent can move dirright to pos52, but the stone is there. So how can the agent be adjacent to the stone? Wait, the agent is at pos42 (X=4, Y=2). The stone is at pos52 (X=5, Y=2). The agent is west of the stone. To push the stone east (dirright) to pos62, but there's no pos62. Alternatively, to push south (dirdown) to pos53, the agent needs to be north of the stone. Wait, pos52's north is pos42 (same column, Y decreases by 1). So if the agent is at pos42, which is north of pos52, then the direction from the agent to the stone is dirsouth (dirdown). But to push the stone south (dirdown) to pos53, the agent needs to be north of the stone. So the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos52 pos53 dirdown.

But let's check the allowed moves. The direction d in the action is the direction from the stone's current location (pos52) to the destination (pos53). So from pos52 to pos53 is dirdown. So the agent must be at pos52's north (pos42) and move south to pos52, pushing the stone to pos53. 

The preconditions for this action:

- Agent is at pos42 (yes).

- Stone is at pos52 (yes).

- pos53 is clear (yes).

- Can move from pos42 to pos52 (dirright? According to the allowed moves, from pos42: "You may move from location pos42 to pos52 following direction dirright". So yes.

- Can move from pos52 to pos53 following dirdown: check allowed moves. From pos52: "You may move from location pos52 to pos53 following direction dirdown". Yes.

- pos53 is not a goal (correct).

So action5: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos52 pos53 dirdown.

After this, stone1 is at pos53, agent is at pos52.

Next, push the stone south to pos54. Agent is at pos52. To push the stone south to pos54, the agent needs to be north of pos53 (pos52 is north of pos53). So from pos52, push the stone south (dirdown) to pos54.

Action6: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos53 pos54 dirdown.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos52 (yes).

- Stone at pos53 (yes).

- pos54 is clear (yes).

- Can move from pos52 to pos53 (dirsouth/dirdown): allowed move from pos52 to pos53 is dirdown (yes).

- Can move from pos53 to pos54 via dirdown: check allowed moves. From pos53: "You may move from location pos53 to pos54 following direction dirdown". Yes.

- pos54 is not a goal (correct).

So action6 is valid. Now stone at pos54, agent at pos53.

Next, push the stone east to pos55. pos54 is not a goal, but pos55 is. So agent needs to push the stone east (dirright) from pos54 to pos55. To do this, the agent must be west of pos54 (pos53) and push east. 

Action7: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirright.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos53 (yes after action6).

- Stone at pos54 (yes).

- pos55 is clear (yes, original state).

- Can move from pos53 to pos54 (dirdown?) Wait, pos53 is X=5, Y=3. pos54 is X=5, Y=4. So from pos53 to pos54 is dirdown (south). But the direction in the action is dirright (east). Wait, the direction for the push action is the direction from the stone's current location (pos54) to the destination (pos55). pos54 to pos55 is dirdown (since pos55 is south of pos54? Or maybe pos55 is east. Wait, pos54 is X=5, Y=4. pos55 is X=5, Y=5. So moving south (dirdown) increases Y. So pos54 to pos55 is dirdown. So to push the stone from pos54 to pos55, the direction is dirdown. Therefore, the agent must be north of pos54 (pos53 is north of pos54). So the agent is at pos53 (X=5, Y=3), which is north of pos54 (X=5, Y=4). So the direction from the agent to the stone is dirdown. The direction of the push is dirdown (from pos54 to pos55). 

So the action would be:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown.

Check preconditions:

- Agent is at pos53 (yes).

- Stone is at pos54 (yes).

- pos55 is clear (yes).

- Can move from pos53 to pos54 (dirdown): allowed move from pos53 to pos54 via dirdown (yes).

- Can move from pos54 to pos55 via dirdown: yes, according to allowed moves from pos54: "You may move from location pos54 to pos55 following direction dirdown".

- pos55 is a goal location (yes).

So action7 is valid. Now stone1 is at pos55 (goal), and agent is at pos54.

This completes the plan. Let's count the actions:

1. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup

2. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright

4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos52 dirright

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos52 pos53 dirdown

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos53 pos54 dirdown

7. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown

Wait, but after action3, the agent is at pos32. Then action4 requires the agent to be at pos32 to push from pos42 to pos52. Wait, no. After action3 (pushtonongoal from pos22 to pos32, pushing the stone to pos42), the agent's new position is pos32 (as per the action's effects: agent moves from l_p (pos22) to l_from (pos32)). So after action3, agent is at pos32. Then, to push the stone from pos42 to pos52, the agent needs to be at pos42's west (pos32) and push east. So action4 would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos52 dirright.

Preconditions:

- Agent is at pos32 (yes).

- Stone is at pos42 (yes).

- pos52 is clear (yes).

- Can move from pos32 to pos42 via dirright (yes).

- Can move from pos42 to pos52 via dirright (yes).

- pos52 is not a goal (correct).

So action4 is valid. After this, agent is at pos42, stone at pos52.

Then, action5: push from pos52 to pos53, which requires agent to be at pos52's north (pos42) and push south. So:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos52 pos53 dirdown.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos42 (yes).

- Stone at pos52 (yes).

- pos53 is clear (yes).

- Can move from pos42 to pos52 via dirright (yes).

- Can move from pos52 to pos53 via dirdown (yes).

- pos53 is not a goal.

Yes, valid.

Then action6: push from pos53 to pos54. Agent is at pos52 (after action5?), wait. After action5, the agent is at pos52's position (pos52) after pushing? Wait, the pushtonongoal action's effects: after pushing, the agent is at l_from (pos52), and the stone is at l_to (pos53). So after action5, the agent is at pos52.

Then, action6 would be pushing from pos53 to pos54. The agent needs to be at pos53's north (pos52) and push south. So:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos53 pos54 dirdown.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos52 (yes).

- Stone at pos53 (yes).

- pos54 clear (yes).

- Can move from pos52 to pos53 (dirdown) (yes).

- Can move from pos53 to pos54 (dirdown) (yes).

- pos54 is not a goal.

Valid.

Then action7: push from pos54 to pos55. Agent is at pos53 (after action6's effects: agent moves to pos53). So:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos53 (yes).

- Stone at pos54 (yes).

- pos55 is clear (yes).

- Can move from pos53 to pos54 (dirdown) (yes).

- Can move from pos54 to pos55 (dirdown) (yes).

- pos55 is goal.

Valid.

So the full plan is:

1. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup

2. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright

4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos52 dirright

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos52 pos53 dirdown

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos53 pos54 dirdown

7. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown

But wait, after action3, the agent is at pos32. So action4 starts with agent at pos32. Then action4 pushes from pos42 to pos52. So agent is at pos32. To push pos42 to pos52, the agent must be at pos42's west (pos32) and push east. Yes. So action4 is:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos52 dirright.

After this, agent is at pos42, stone at pos52.

Then action5: agent at pos42 pushes pos52 to pos53 via dirdown. So agent moves from pos42 to pos52 (dirright), pushing the stone to pos53. So the action is:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos52 pos53 dirdown.

After this, agent is at pos52.

Then action6: agent at pos52 pushes pos53 to pos54 via dirdown. Action is:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos53 pos54 dirdown.

After this, agent is at pos53.

Finally, action7: agent at pos53 pushes pos54 to pos55 via dirdown.

Yes, this seems correct.

So the plan has 7 actions. Is there a shorter plan?

Let's think. Alternative path: Instead of moving all the way west to pos22, maybe the agent can go north to pos23, then pos22, but that's the same as before. Alternatively, could the agent go from pos24 to pos34, then to pos33, then to pos32, but the stone is there. But since the agent can't move into a location with a stone unless pushing, perhaps that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe a different route. For example, pushing the stone south first.

The stone is at pos32. To push it south to pos33, the agent must be north of pos32 (pos31). So agent needs to get to pos31.

From pos24, how to get to pos31.

Path: pos24 → pos34 (dirright), then pos34 → pos33 (dirup), pos33 → pos32 (dirup) (but stone is there), so that's blocked. Alternative: pos24 → pos25 (dirdown), pos25 → pos35 (dirright), pos35 → pos34 (dirup), pos34 → pos33 (dirup), pos33 → pos32 (dirup) — again blocked.

Alternatively, pos24 → pos23 (dirup), pos23 → pos22 (dirup), pos22 → pos32 (dirright), but stone is there. No.

Alternatively, pos24 → pos34 (dirright), pos34 → pos44 (dirright), pos44 → pos54 (dirright), pos54 → pos55 (dirdown). Then agent is at pos55. But how to push the stone from there?

Not helpful. So perhaps the initial plan is the shortest.

But wait, after action3, the stone is at pos42. Then the agent is at pos32. To push it to pos52, the agent is at pos32. From pos32, the agent can move east to pos42 (dirright) and then push the stone further east. But perhaps there's a more efficient way.

Wait, after action3: stone at pos42, agent at pos32. Can the agent push the stone from pos42 to pos52 directly? Yes. Because the agent is at pos32, which is west of pos42. So to push east from pos42 to pos52, the agent must be at pos42's west (pos32), so the action is:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos52 dirright.

Yes, that's action4. So that's correct.

Is there a way to reduce the number of moves? Let's see.

Original plan:

1. move pos24 → pos23 (dirup)

2. move pos23 → pos22 (dirup)

3. push from pos22 → pos32 → pos42 (dirright)

4. push from pos32 → pos42 → pos52 (dirright)

5. push from pos42 → pos52 → pos53 (dirdown)

6. push from pos52 → pos53 → pos54 (dirdown)

7. push from pos53 → pos54 → pos55 (dirdown)

Total 7 actions.

Alternative idea: Can the agent push the stone from pos32 to pos33 (south) first, then move it east. Let's see.

To push the stone south to pos33, the agent must be north of pos32 (pos31). How to get there.

From pos24, the agent can:

1. move to pos34 (dirright)

2. move to pos33 (dirup)

3. move to pos32 (dirup) — blocked by stone.

Alternatively, agent moves from pos24 → pos34 (dirright), pos34 → pos33 (dirup), then move west to pos23 (dirleft), then north to pos22 (dirup), then east to pos32 (dirright), but the stone is there. Not helpful.

Alternative path: agent moves from pos24 to pos34, then pos34 to pos33, then pos33 to pos32 (dirup) — but can't. So no.

Alternatively, agent moves from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown), then to pos35 (dirright), then to pos34 (dirup), then to pos33 (dirup), etc. This seems longer.

So the initial plan seems to be the shortest. Thus, the answer is the sequence of 7 actions as outlined.
