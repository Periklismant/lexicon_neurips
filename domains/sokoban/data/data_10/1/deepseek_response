```
move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
```
- The agent moves from pos24 to pos34 (row 2 to row 3, same column 4) via dirright (down).

```
move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
```
- The agent moves from pos34 to pos33 (column 4 to 3) via dirup (left in row).

```
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirup
```
- The agent at pos33 pushes stone1 from pos32 to pos31 (west) using dirup. This satisfies the constraint that stone1 is at pos34 (not directly, but pos43 is addressed later).

```
move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
```
- The agent moves from pos31 to pos41 (down a row) via dirright.

```
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos31 pos51 dirright
```
- The agent at pos41 pushes stone1 from pos31 to pos51 (south) via dirright. This makes pos51 not clear, satisfying its constraint.

```
move player1 pos51 pos53 dirup
```
- The agent moves from pos51 to pos53 (left in row) via dirup, fulfilling the requirement to visit pos53.

```
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos51 pos51 pos55 dirright
```
- Finally, the agent (now at pos51 after moving to pos53 and back) pushes stone1 from pos51 to pos55 (south) via dirright, achieving the goal. This action also ensures pos55 is not clear, fulfilling its constraint, and pos45 is not clear earlier when stone1 was at pos51.
