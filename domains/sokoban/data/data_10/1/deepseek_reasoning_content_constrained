Okay, let's try to figure out this planning problem. So, the goal is to move stone1 to a goal location, which is pos55. The constraints are a bit complicated, so I need to make sure each one is satisfied.

First, the initial state: The agent (player1) is at pos24, and stone1 is at pos32. The goal is pos55. The allowed movements are based on the directions given. Let me visualize the grid. Positions go from pos11 (top-left) to pos55 (bottom-right). So pos32 is in row 3, column 2. The agent is at pos24 (row 2, column4). The goal is pos55.

Constraints to consider:

1. At least one state where stone1 is at pos34 or pos43 is not clear. So during the plan, either push stone1 to pos34 or make pos43 occupied at some point.

2. pos22 must always be clear. So the agent or stones can't be there at any time.

3. pos51 being not clear can happen in at most one continuous sequence. So if the agent or a stone is there, it can't be multiple separate times.

4. Agent must be at pos15 and pos53 at least once.

5. If the agent is at pos53, then stone1 must be at pos42 either at that state or later. So after visiting pos53, stone1 needs to be moved to pos42 at some point.

6. pos53 not clear can only be a single continuous period. So once it's occupied, it can't be cleared and then reoccupied.

7. pos55 must be not clear (i.e., have the stone or agent) at some point. Since the stone needs to end at pos55, this will happen when the stone is placed there.

8. Before pos55 is not clear (stone arrives), either pos45 or pos25 must have been not clear earlier. So maybe moving through those positions.

9. pos54 must be not clear at some point. So agent or stone must be there.

10. If pos54 is not clear, then pos12 or pos33 must be not clear at or after that state.

11. Agent must be at pos21 at least once.

12. pos23 must always be clear. So never occupied.

So the main steps: Move agent to push stone1 from pos32 to pos55. But need to navigate around the constraints.

Possible path:

From pos24, agent can move up to pos23 (but wait, pos23 must always be clear. So agent can't be there. Wait, no: the constraint says pos23 must be clear in every state. So agent can't go to pos23. Because if the agent is there, pos23 is not clear. So movement through pos23 is forbidden. So the agent cannot enter pos23 at any time. That complicates movement.

Wait, the initial state says "Location pos23 is clear". The constraint says in every state, pos23 must be clear. So the agent can't be there, and stones can't be there. So all actions must avoid pos23.

So the agent is at pos24. To reach the stone at pos32, which is at row3, column2. Let's see the movement options. From pos24, possible moves: move left to pos14, right to pos34, up to pos23 (forbidden), or down to pos25. But pos23 is forbidden, so can't go there. So agent can go to pos34 (right), pos14 (left), or pos25 (down). 

But the stone is at pos32. So how to get there. To push the stone from pos32, the agent needs to be adjacent in a direction that allows pushing. Let's look at pos32's neighbors. pos32 can be moved in directions like dirleft (to pos22?), dirright to pos42, dirdown to pos33, dirup to pos31. Wait, the allowed movements for pos32: "You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft", "to pos42 following dirright", "to pos31 following dirup", "to pos33 following dirdown".

So to push the stone from pos32, the agent needs to be in a position adjacent in the direction opposite to the push. For example, to push the stone from pos32 to pos42 (dirright), the agent needs to be at pos32's left (pos22), but pos22 must be clear? Wait, no. The preconditions for pushtogoal or pushtonongoal require that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (stone's current position) in direction d. Wait, the direction is from l_p to l_from. So if the agent is at pos22 and wants to push the stone from pos32 to pos42 (dirright), then the direction from pos22 to pos32 is dirdown? Because pos22 is row2, column2; pos32 is row3, column2. So direction from pos22 to pos32 is dirdown. Then the agent can push the stone from pos32 to pos42 (dirright). But the movement from pos22 to pos32 must be allowed. Let me check the allowed movements.

Looking at the allowed moves for pos22: "You may move from location pos22 to pos12 (dirleft), pos32 (dirright), pos21 (dirup), pos23 (dirdown)". Wait, but the movement from pos22 to pos32 is dirright? Or is it dirdown? Wait, the movement directions are a bit confusing. Let me check the given moves.

Looking at the given "You may move from" statements for pos22: 

- "You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft": pos12 is row1, column2. So from pos22 (row2, column2) to pos12 (row1, column2) would be dirup, but the direction here is dirleft. Wait, maybe directions are defined as movement along rows and columns. For example, dirright could be moving to the next column (same row), dirdown could be moving to the next row (same column). So pos22 to pos32 would be moving down one row (same column), which is dirdown. But according to the given moves, "You may move from location pos22 to location pos32 following direction dirright". Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because pos32 is row3, column2. So from pos22 (row2, column2) to pos32 (row3, column2) is moving down a row, which should be dirdown. But according to the given data, "You may move from location pos22 to location pos32 following direction dirright". Hmm, that's conflicting. Maybe there's a mistake in the movement directions. Or perhaps directions are named differently. Let me check.

Looking at pos22's moves:

- "You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft" (row2 to row1, same column; dirleft would be left in column, but row1 is up. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe directions are not as per typical grid movement. Wait, perhaps the directions are based on the movement's direction name, not the grid direction. For example, dirright could correspond to east, dirleft west, dirup north, dirdown south. So moving from pos22 (row2, column2) to pos32 (row3, column2) would be south, which is dirdown. But according to the given data, that movement is dirright. That can't be right. Wait, looking back at the problem statement's movement definitions:

Wait, looking at the original state's allowed moves, for example: "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright". pos11 is row1, column1. pos21 is row2, column1. So moving down a row (same column) is dirright. That's odd. So dirright here actually corresponds to moving down, not right in the grid. Similarly, "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown" â€” pos11 to pos12 is moving right in the column (from column1 to column2), same row. So direction dirdown is moving right in columns. So direction names are perhaps swapped. For example, dirright means moving down a row, and dirdown means moving right in columns. That's confusing, but according to the given movement definitions, that's how they are structured.

So for example:

pos11 (row1, column1) to pos21 (row2, column1) is direction dirright.

pos11 to pos12 (row1, column2) is direction dirdown.

Similarly, pos12 to pos22 (row2, column2) is dirright (moving down a row).

pos22 to pos32 (row3, column2) is dirright (down a row).

So directions:

dirright: move down a row (same column)

dirleft: move up a row (same column)

dirup: move left in column (same row)

dirdown: move right in column (same row)

Wait, that's the opposite of what I expected. So the direction names are perhaps mapped differently. So when the action says "direction dirright", it's moving along the row (i.e., down a row?), but according to the given example, moving from pos11 to pos21 is dirright. pos11 is (1,1), pos21 is (2,1). So moving from row1 to row2, same column. So dirright corresponds to moving down a row. Similarly, moving from pos11 to pos12 is dirdown, which is moving right in the same row.

This is crucial because movement directions affect how the agent can navigate.

So, directions:

dirright: down a row (same column)

dirleft: up a row (same column)

dirup: left in column (same row)

dirdown: right in column (same row)

So to move from pos22 to pos32, the direction is dirright (down a row). So pos22 is (2,2), pos32 is (3,2). The direction is dirright.

So, to push a stone from pos32 (row3, column2) to pos42 (row4, column2), direction dirright. The agent needs to be at pos32's previous position in that direction's opposite. Wait, no: the agent has to be at a position that allows moving to the stone's current location (l_from) via direction d. So for example, to push the stone from pos32 to pos42 (dirright, which is down a row), the agent needs to be at l_p, which is pos32's position when moving via direction d. Wait, the preconditions for pushtogoal require that the agent can move from l_p to l_from (the stone's current position) following direction d. So if the stone is at pos32, and the agent is pushing it to pos42 (dirright), then the agent must be at a position l_p such that moving from l_p to pos32 is direction d (dirright). But dirright is down a row, so l_p must be pos22 (since moving dirright from pos22 to pos32). So agent is at pos22, can push the stone from pos32 (but wait, pos22 to pos32 is dirright. So the agent is at l_p=pos22, l_from=pos32. Wait, no: the agent is at l_p, and moves to l_from via direction d. So if the agent is at pos22, and direction d is dirright, then l_from would be pos32. So the stone must be at pos32. So the agent is at pos22, pushing the stone from pos32 to pos42 (dirright). But wait, pos22 is in row2, column2. The stone is at pos32 (row3, column2). So the agent is at pos22, which is north (up a row) of the stone. To push the stone south (dirright), the agent would need to be north of the stone. But how can the agent push in that direction? Because to push the stone south, the agent would need to be at the stone's north position (pos22), then push it down. But according to the preconditions, the agent must be at l_p (pos22), and l_from is pos32. Then, pushing the stone from pos32 to pos42 (dirright). So that's possible. But in this case, the agent is at pos22, which is clear in the initial state. Wait, initial state says pos22 is clear. So the agent can move to pos22.

But wait, the agent is initially at pos24. How to get to pos22? Let's map the path.

From pos24, possible moves:

- move left (dirleft) to pos14 (row1, column4). But direction names are confusing. Wait, to move from pos24 to pos14, that would be moving up a row (from row2 to row1), same column4. So direction dirleft. Because moving up a row is dirleft. Because earlier, moving from pos11 to pos21 is dirright (down a row). So dirleft is up a row.

So pos24 (row2, column4) can move dirleft (up) to pos14 (row1, column4), dirright (down) to pos34 (row3, column4), dirup (left in column) to pos23 (row2, column3) which is forbidden, or dirdown (right in column) to pos25 (row2, column5).

But pos23 is forbidden. So agent can go to pos14, pos34, or pos25.

But to reach pos22, the agent needs to go west (dirup) from pos24? Let's think. pos24 is (2,4). To get to pos22 (2,2), the agent needs to move left in the row, which is dirup? Because moving left in the same row would be dirup, as per previous examples. For example, moving from pos22 to pos12 is dirleft (up a row?), but according to the given data, pos22 to pos12 is direction dirleft, which is moving up a row. Wait, maybe directions are as follows:

- dirright: move down a row (same column)
- dirleft: move up a row (same column)
- dirup: move left in the same row (decrease column)
- dirdown: move right in the same row (increase column)

Yes, that makes sense. So:

- dirup: move left (column decreases)
- dirdown: move right (column increases)
- dirleft: move up (row decreases)
- dirright: move down (row increases)

So for example, moving from pos22 (2,2) to pos12 (1,2) is dirleft (row decreases by 1, same column). Moving from pos22 to pos32 (3,2) is dirright (row increases by 1). Moving from pos22 to pos21 (2,1) is dirup (column decreases by 1). Moving to pos23 (2,3) is dirdown (column increases by 1).

So, for the agent to move from pos24 (2,4) to pos23 (2,3) is dirup (column decreases by 1). But pos23 must remain clear, so the agent cannot go there. So to reach pos22, the agent needs to go to column 2 in row2. Starting at pos24 (2,4), moving dirup (left in the row) to pos23 (2,3) is forbidden, so that's not allowed. So alternative path: go to pos14 (1,4) via dirleft (up a row from 2 to 1), then move dirup (left in the row) to pos13 (1,3), then dirup to pos12 (1,2), then dirright (down a row) to pos22 (2,2). But need to check if the path is allowed.

Wait, initial positions:

pos24 to pos14 via dirleft (up a row, from row2 to row1, column4). Then from pos14, can move dirup (left in the row) to pos13 (1,3), then dirup to pos12 (1,2). Then from pos12, dirright (down to row2, column2) to pos22. But pos22 is clear initially. So this path is possible. So the agent can go from pos24 -> pos14 (dirleft) -> pos13 (dirup) -> pos12 (dirup) -> pos22 (dirright). Then, from pos22, push the stone at pos32 to pos42 (dirright). But pos42 is a non-goal location, so would need to use pushtonongoal. However, the goal is to move stone1 to pos55 (a goal). So pushing to pos42 might be a step towards that.

But after pushing to pos42, the agent is at pos32. Then, to push the stone further, maybe to pos43, pos44, etc., but need to reach pos55.

Alternatively, maybe pushing the stone from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown, which is right in the column). But pos33 is clear. Wait, direction dirdown is moving right in the same row. So from pos32 (3,2) to pos33 (3,3) would be dirdown (column increases by 1). So pushing the stone to pos33 would require the agent to be at pos32's left (column1?), but how?

Alternatively, the agent could push the stone from pos32 to pos31 (dirleft, which is up a row). But pos31 is clear. Hmm.

But the ultimate goal is pos55, which is in row5, column5. So the stone needs to move right (dirdown in columns) and down (dirright in rows). So maybe pushing the stone east (dirdown) and south (dirright) towards pos55.

But with all the constraints, let's outline the steps:

1. Move agent to pos22 to push the stone from pos32 to pos42 (dirright). But need to check if pos42 is clear. Initially, pos42 is clear. So after pushing, stone is at pos42 (non-goal), agent is at pos32. Then, from pos32, can push the stone further.

But then, after pushing to pos42, the stone is at pos42, which is a non-goal. Then need to push it further towards pos55. For example, from pos42, push it dirright (down a row) to pos52, but pos52 is non-goal. Then to pos55, but that requires moving right (dirdown in columns) and dirright (down rows).

Alternatively, after pos42, push east (dirdown) to pos43, then pos44, pos45, then dirright to pos55.

Wait, pos45 is a non-goal location, but adjacent to pos55 (goal). So pushing from pos45 to pos55 (dirright). So steps:

stone1: pos32 -> pos42 (dirright) -> pos43 (dirdown) -> pos44 (dirdown) -> pos45 (dirdown) -> pos55 (dirright).

But each push requires the agent to be in the correct position.

But also, need to satisfy the constraints:

- Agent must visit pos15 and pos53.

- When agent is at pos53, stone1 must be at pos42 at that state or after.

- pos54 must be not clear at some point.

- Also, the constraint that when pos55 is not clear (stone arrives), there must be an earlier state where pos45 or pos25 is not clear. So if the stone is pushed to pos55, then earlier in the plan, pos45 (where the stone would be before pushing to pos55) would be occupied, so that's covered.

- Also, pos54 must be not clear. So perhaps pushing the stone to pos54 first, then to pos55. But pos54 is a non-goal location. So that would require pushtonongoal, but then pushing to pos55 (goal) with pushtogoal. However, the stone needs to end at a goal, so pos55 is the only goal.

But pos54 is a non-goal, so if the stone is there, it's not a goal. So the plan would need to push it from pos54 to pos55. But that's possible. So maybe push to pos54, then to pos55.

But let's see. Also, the constraint that if pos54 is not clear (which would happen when the stone is there), then pos12 or pos33 must not be clear at that state or after. So when the stone is at pos54, either pos12 or pos33 must be occupied (by agent or stone) at that time or later. Since the stone is moving towards pos55, after pos54, it goes to pos55. So pos12 is clear initially. The agent could be at pos12 earlier. But if the agent is at pos12 in some state, then pos12 is not clear, which could satisfy that constraint.

Another constraint: At least one state where stone1 is at pos34 or pos43 is not clear. So if the stone is pushed to pos34, that would satisfy it. Or if during the plan, pos43 is occupied (by stone or agent). For example, if the agent moves to pos43, that would make it not clear. Or the stone is at pos34.

But the stone's path from pos42 to pos43 to pos44 to pos45 to pos55 would go through pos43. So when the stone is at pos43, that's a non-goal location. So that would satisfy the constraint that pos43 is not clear in at least one state.

So maybe the plan is:

1. Move agent from pos24 to pos22 via pos14, pos13, pos12, etc.

But pos22 must always be clear. Wait, no: the constraint is that pos22 must be clear in every state. So if the agent moves into pos22, then pos22 becomes not clear, violating the constraint. Wait, the constraint says: "The following expression must hold in every state: Location pos22 is clear". So pos22 must be clear in every state. So the agent can never be at pos22, and the stone can never be there. So the previous idea of pushing the stone from pos32 to pos42 via pos22 is impossible because the agent would have to be at pos22, which would make pos22 not clear. Therefore, that path is invalid.

Ah, this is a critical point. So the agent can't be at pos22 at any time. So the initial plan of moving to pos22 is invalid. That complicates things.

So alternative approach: find a path to push the stone from pos32 without going through pos22.

So the agent is at pos24. The stone is at pos32. How can the agent reach a position adjacent to the stone to push it?

Looking at pos32's neighbors:

- pos22 (row2, column2) is forbidden (agent can't be there).

- pos31 (row3, column1): agent could approach from there.

- pos33 (row3, column3): agent could approach from there.

- pos42 (row4, column2): agent could approach from there.

Wait, pos32's adjacent locations are pos22 (north), pos42 (south), pos31 (west), pos33 (east).

But pos22 is forbidden. So the agent can approach from pos31, pos33, or pos42.

But how to get to those positions.

From pos24 (row2, column4), the agent can move dirright (down to row3, column4) to pos34. Then from pos34, possible moves:

- dirleft (up to row2, column4) back to pos24.

- dirright (down to row4, column4) to pos44.

- dirup (left to column3) to pos33 (row3, column3).

- dirdown (right to column5) to pos35.

So from pos34, moving dirup (left) to pos33 (row3, column3). Then pos33 is clear initially.

So agent could move from pos24 -> pos34 (dirright) -> pos33 (dirup). Then, from pos33, can push the stone from pos32 (west) to pos31 (dirleft). But pos31 is a non-goal. Or push east to pos34 (but stone is at pos32, pushing to pos33 is east (dirdown? Wait, directions again.

Wait, the agent is at pos33 (row3, column3). The stone is at pos32 (row3, column2). To push the stone west (column1) from pos32 to pos31 (dirleft), the agent would need to be east of the stone. Wait, no: to push the stone west, the agent must be east of the stone and push it west. But the agent is at pos33 (row3, column3), the stone is at pos32 (row3, column2). So the agent is east of the stone. To push the stone west to pos31 (row3, column1), the agent would need to be at pos32's east (pos33), and push the stone west. But according to the action's preconditions, the agent must be at l_p, which is adjacent to the stone's current location (l_from) in direction d. So for pushing from pos32 to pos31 (dirleft), the direction d from l_p to l_from is dirleft. Wait, the direction from the agent's position to the stone's position must be d. So the agent is at l_p, moving in direction d to reach l_from (the stone's position). For example, to push the stone west from pos32 to pos31, the agent needs to be at l_p, which is east of the stone (pos33), and the direction from pos33 to pos32 is dirleft (west). Then, pushing the stone to pos31 (dirleft). But wait, the direction for pushing is the same as the direction from l_p to l_from. So in this case, the agent is at pos33 (l_p), direction d is dirleft (west) to reach pos32 (l_from). Then, pushing the stone from pos32 to pos31, which is also dirleft. So the action would be pushtonongoal, since pos31 is not a goal.

So preconditions for pushtonongoal:

- agent at pos33.

- stone at pos32.

- pos31 is clear.

- can move from pos33 to pos32 via dirleft (west).

- can move from pos32 to pos31 via dirleft (west).

- pos31 is not a goal.

All these are true initially. So the agent can push the stone from pos32 to pos31. But why would we do that? Because we need to eventually get the stone to pos55.

Alternatively, after moving to pos33, the agent could push the stone east to pos34. Let's see. The stone is at pos32 (3,2). Pushing east (dirdown, right in column) to pos33 (3,3). Wait, no: from pos32, dirdown is right in the same row (increase column). So pos32 to pos33 is dirdown (right). The agent would need to be at pos32's west (pos31) to push it east. But the agent is at pos33. So to push the stone east (dirdown) to pos33 (3,3), the agent must be west of the stone. But the agent is at pos33, which is east of the stone. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, the agent is at pos33, and the stone is at pos32. The agent could push the stone north (dirleft) to pos22, but pos22 is forbidden. So that's not allowed.

Hmm. So the only possible pushes from pos32 are to pos31 (west), pos33 (east), or pos42 (south). But pos22 is forbidden.

So, perhaps pushing the stone south to pos42. But to do that, the agent needs to be north of pos32 (pos22), which is forbidden. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, pushing the stone east to pos33. To do that, the agent must be west of the stone (pos31). But the agent is at pos33. How to get to pos31?

Let me think. The agent is at pos24. Could the agent move to pos34 (dirright from pos24), then to pos33 (dirup), then to pos32 (dirleft)? Wait, pos32 is where the stone is. But initially, the stone is at pos32, so pos32 is not clear. The agent can't move into pos32 unless it's clear. So no.

Wait, the initial state says "Location pos32 is clear". But "stone1 is at location pos32". So pos32 is not clear. Wait, there's a contradiction here. Let me check the original state:

Original state says:

"stone1 is at location pos32"

"Location pos32 is clear"

But if a stone is at pos32, then pos32 is not clear. So this seems contradictory. But according to the problem statement, perhaps "clear" means that there's no agent or stone. Or maybe "clear" refers to being passable. Wait, the problem statement says: "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So a location is clear if it's empty. But in the initial state, stone1 is at pos32, so pos32 should not be clear. However, the original state says "Location pos32 is clear". This is a problem. Wait, let me check again.

In the original state:

The statements are:

"player1 is at location pos24"

"stone1 is at location pos32"

"Location pos11 is clear"

...

"Location pos32 is clear"

Wait, that's impossible. If the stone is at pos32, then pos32 is not clear. So this must be a mistake in the problem statement. Or perhaps "clear" refers to something else. Wait, maybe "clear" means that the agent can move through it. But the problem statement says "each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So a location is clear if it's empty. Therefore, the initial state has a contradiction: stone1 is at pos32, and pos32 is clear. That can't be. So perhaps this is a typo, and pos32 is not clear. But the user provided this as the problem, so I have to work with it as given. But this inconsistency is a problem. For the sake of solving the problem, I'll assume that the initial state has a typo, and pos32 is not clear. But according to the problem statement, it's given as clear, so maybe the stone's presence doesn't affect the "clear" status. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe "clear" refers to the agent's path. This is confusing. 

But according to the action preconditions, for example, the "move" action requires that the destination location is clear. So if a stone is at a location, it's not clear. Therefore, the original state must be incorrect. But since this is given, perhaps it's a mistake and pos32 is not clear. But the problem states that "Location pos32 is clear" in the original state. This is conflicting. But I have to proceed with the given information. 

Assuming that pos32 is clear despite the stone being there, which is a contradiction, but perhaps the problem's initial state is defined such that stones don't block movement. But that contradicts the problem description. This is a critical issue. 

Alternatively, maybe "clear" refers to the agent not being present. So a location is clear if the agent is not there. So stones don't affect the clear status. But the problem says "each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty". So a location is clear if it's empty (no agent, no stone). Therefore, the initial state has a mistake. But as a solver, I need to proceed with the given information. 

But the problem says "stone1 is at location pos32" and "Location pos32 is clear". This is impossible. Therefore, I must assume that it's a typo, and pos32 is not clear. But the user provided it as clear. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the "clear" predicate is only about the agent's presence, not the stone. But that's not consistent with the action effects. For example, when you push a stone to a location, that location becomes not clear. So the presence of a stone makes a location not clear. Therefore, the initial state is impossible. But perhaps the user made a mistake, and the stone is at pos32, and pos32 is not clear, but in the problem statement, they erroneously said it's clear. 

But since I have to work with the given problem, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that pos32 is clear, even with the stone there. Which would imply that stones do not block movement. But that's conflicting with the problem's description. This is a problem. 

Alternatively, maybe the initial state lists all clear locations, and the presence of the stone is an exception. But in that case, pos32 should not be listed as clear. 

This is a critical problem. Without resolving this, the planning is impossible. But given that the user provided this, perhaps it's best to proceed with the given data, assuming that pos32 is clear despite the stone being there. Therefore, the agent can move into pos32. But that contradicts the problem's own logic. 

Alternatively, perhaps the initial state's "clear" statements are after accounting for the agent and stones. So if the agent is at pos24, then pos24 is not clear, but in the original state, it says "Location pos24 is clear". Which is a contradiction. Because the agent is at pos24, so pos24 should not be clear. 

This suggests that the problem's initial state has multiple errors. However, since this is an exercise, I'll proceed by assuming that the clear statements are correct, and the presence of the agent and stones does not affect the clear status. But this is not logical. 

Alternatively, perhaps the "clear" predicate refers to there being no stones. So a location is clear if there are no stones, regardless of the agent. But then the agent's presence doesn't affect clear. But the problem's action effects mention that after moving, the destination is no longer clear, implying that the agent's presence affects clear status. 

This is very confusing. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed under the following assumptions:

- A location is clear if there is no agent or stone present.

- The initial state has errors in the clear status. For example, pos24 is clear, but the agent is there, which is a contradiction. Similarly, pos32 has a stone but is marked as clear.

But since this is given, perhaps I should ignore these contradictions and proceed as per the problem's description. 

Given that, let's proceed.

The agent is at pos24. To reach the stone at pos32, which is clear, the agent can move into pos32. But the stone is there. So moving into pos32 would require that pos32 is clear, which it is according to the initial state. So the agent can move into pos32 via a move action. But pos32 contains the stone. But the move action requires that the destination is clear. According to the initial state, pos32 is clear, so the agent can move there. But that would mean the agent and stone are both at pos32, which is impossible. Therefore, this is a contradiction. 

Given the contradictions in the problem's initial state, it's impossible to proceed logically. But perhaps the clear status is defined such that a location is clear if there is no agent. So stones don't affect the clear status. In that case, the initial state is possible. 

If that's the case, then:

- A location is clear if the agent is not there. Stones do not affect clear status.

But the problem's action effects for "move" say that after moving, the destination is no longer clear (because the agent is there). So the clear status is only about the agent's presence. Stones are separate. 

So in this case, the agent can move to a location even if there's a stone there, as long as the agent is not there. But this would mean that a stone and agent can occupy the same location, which contradicts the problem's initial statement that each position may contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. 

This is very confusing. To make progress, I'll proceed under the following assumptions:

- A location is clear if it does not have the agent or a stone. 

- The initial state has a mistake, but for the problem's sake, pos32 is not clear (due to the stone), and the "Location pos32 is clear" statement is incorrect. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in listing the clear locations, and pos32 is not clear. 

Given that, the stone is at pos32, making it not clear. Therefore, the agent cannot move into pos32. 

So to push the stone from pos32, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. 

But the agent is at pos24. How to get to a position adjacent to pos32 without violating constraints. 

Possibly, move from pos24 to pos34 (dirright), then to pos33 (dirup). From pos33, the agent can push the stone from pos32 to pos31 (dirleft) or to pos33 (dirdown) if possible. 

Wait, from pos33 (row3, column3), the stone is at pos32 (row3, column2). To push the stone east to pos33 (dirdown), the agent would need to be west of the stone. But the agent is east of the stone. So that's not possible. 

Alternatively, the agent can push the stone north (dirleft) from pos32 to pos22, but pos22 must remain clear. So that's forbidden. 

Alternatively, push the stone south to pos42 (dirright). To do that, the agent must be north of the stone (pos22), which is forbidden. 

Alternatively, the agent can move to pos34 (row3, column4) and then to pos33 (row3, column3). From pos33, can the agent push the stone west to pos31? 

Yes, if the agent is at pos33, direction dirleft (west) to reach pos32 (l_from). So the agent is at pos33 (l_p), and the stone is at pos32 (l_from). Then, pushing the stone from pos32 to pos31 (dirleft). But pos31 is a non-goal location. So this would use the pushtonongoal action.

The preconditions for pushtonongoal:

- Agent p is at l_p (pos33)

- Stone s is at l_from (pos32)

- l_to (pos31) is clear. According to initial state, pos31 is clear.

- Can move from pos33 to pos32 via dirleft (west). According to the allowed movements: From pos33, can you move to pos32 following dirleft? Let's check the given moves:

Looking for moves from pos33:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft", "to pos43 following dirright", "to pos32 following dirup", "to pos34 following dirdown". 

Wait, direction dirleft for pos33 would be moving west in column (same row). pos33 is (3,3). dirleft (west) would move to (3,2) pos32. But according to the given data, "You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup". Hmm, this is confusing again. 

So the movement from pos33 to pos32 is direction dirup. Which would mean moving left in the row (column decreases). So the direction names are not matching the physical directions. So to move from pos33 to pos32 (same row, column3 to column2), the direction is dirup. 

Therefore, the agent at pos33 can move to pos32 via dirup. But pos32 is occupied by the stone, so the agent can't move there via a move action. But for pushing, the agent doesn't need to move there; instead, the agent is at pos33 (l_p), and the direction from pos33 to pos32 is dirup. Then, the stone is pushed from pos32 to pos31 via dirleft. 

But the preconditions require that the agent can move from l_p (pos33) to l_from (pos32) following direction d (dirup). So that's allowed. 

Then, pushing the stone from pos32 to pos31 (dirleft). So the action would be pushtonongoal, since pos31 is not a goal. 

So the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirup

But need to check if the movement from pos32 to pos31 is allowed. According to the given data, "You may move from location pos32 to location pos31 following direction dirup". Yes. 

So after this action:

- Agent is no longer at pos33, moves to pos32.

- Stone moves to pos31.

- pos31 is no longer clear.

- Agent is now at pos32.

But pos32 was previously occupied by the stone, but after the action, the stone is at pos31, and the agent is at pos32. 

This action would satisfy the preconditions. 

But after this, the stone is at pos31, which is a non-goal. The agent is at pos32. Now, the agent needs to push the stone towards the goal. 

But how to proceed from here. 

The agent is at pos32. Can push the stone from pos31 to other locations. 

But the stone is at pos31. To push it further, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. 

From pos32, the agent can move to pos31 via dirup (left in the row). But pos31 is occupied by the stone. So the agent can't move there. 

Alternatively, the agent can move south to pos42 (dirright) from pos32. 

So from pos32, possible moves:

- dirleft (up a row) to pos22 (forbidden)

- dirright (down a row) to pos42.

- dirup (left in row) to pos31 (occupied by stone)

- dirdown (right in row) to pos33. 

So agent can move dirright to pos42. 

After moving to pos42, the agent is at pos42. Then, can push the stone from pos31 to pos21 (dirleft), but pos21 is clear. 

But pos21 is a non-goal. 

Alternatively, push the stone east (dirdown) to pos32. But the agent is at pos42. To push the stone from pos31 to pos32 (east), the agent needs to be west of the stone. So agent would need to be at pos21, but pos22 must remain clear. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better path.

Another approach: After pushing the stone to pos31, the agent is at pos32. Then, move the agent to pos33 (dirdown from pos32 to pos33). Then, from pos33, move to pos34 (dirdown to pos34's column increases? Wait, pos33 is (3,3). dirdown would be east to (3,4) pos34. Wait, no: directions again. From pos33, dirdown is moving right in the same row. So from pos33 (3,3), dirdown moves to pos34 (3,4). 

Yes. So the agent can move from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown), then to pos34 (dirdown). Then, from pos34, move to pos44 (dirright). 

But this isn't helping with the stone at pos31. 

Perhaps another plan is needed.

Alternative plan:

1. Move agent from pos24 to pos34 (dirright).

2. Move agent from pos34 to pos33 (dirup).

3. Push stone from pos32 to pos31 (dirup) using pushtonongoal.

4. Move agent from pos32 to pos42 (dirright).

5. Push stone from pos31 to pos41 (dirleft) using pushtonongoal.

6. Move agent to pos51 (dirright from pos41).

7. Push stone from pos41 to pos51 (dirleft) using pushtonongoal.

But pos51 is not a goal. Then need to move it further.

But this seems off-track. The goal is to get the stone to pos55. 

Another idea: After pushing the stone to pos31, the agent can move around to push it south. For example, push the stone from pos31 to pos41 (dirright). But how?

The agent is at pos32. To push the stone from pos31 to pos41 (dirright), the agent needs to be at pos31's north (pos21), which is forbidden. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, the agent can move to pos33, then to pos43, and then push the stone east.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Let's try to find a path that satisfies all constraints.

Constraints:

- Agent must be at pos15 and pos53.

- When agent is at pos53, stone1 must be at pos42 or later.

- pos54 must be not clear at some point.

- pos55 must be not clear, and before that, pos45 or pos25 must have been not clear.

- pos22 and pos23 must always be clear.

So perhaps the plan is:

1. Move agent to pos15 (to satisfy the constraint).

2. Move agent to pos53 (to satisfy the constraint).

But how to do that while also moving the stone.

Alternatively, the agent needs to visit pos15 and pos53 during the plan.

Let's think about how to get the agent to pos15 and pos53.

From pos24, the agent can move to pos25 (dirdown), then to pos15 (dirleft). But pos25 is allowed. 

Steps:

Move pos24 -> pos25 (dirdown) -> pos15 (dirleft). Then, to satisfy the constraint of being at pos15.

Then, the agent needs to go to pos53. From pos15, move to pos14 (dirup), pos25 (dirright). But to reach pos53, which is in row5, column3.

From pos15 (row1, column5), the agent can move to pos25 (dirright), then to pos35 (dirright), then to pos45 (dirright), then to pos55 (dirright). But pos55 is a goal. Then, from pos55, move to pos54 (dirup), pos45 (dirleft). But pos55 is the goal for the stone, not the agent.

Alternatively, from pos45, the agent can move to pos44 (dirup), pos43 (dirup), pos53 (dirright?), but this is complicated.

But the agent needs to reach pos53. So pos53 is in row5, column3. 

From pos24, the agent can move down to pos34, then dirright to pos44, then pos54, then pos53.

But how? Let's see:

pos24 -> pos34 (dirright)

pos34 -> pos44 (dirright)

pos44 -> pos54 (dirright)

pos54 -> pos53 (dirup) [moving left in the row from column4 to column3]

But pos54 to pos53 is allowed: "You may move from location pos54 to location pos53 following direction dirup". Yes.

So the agent can reach pos53 via pos34, pos44, pos54, then pos53.

But during this movement, the agent must not violate any constraints, such as pos23 being clear.

Now, integrating this with moving the stone:

The agent needs to push the stone to pos55. But the stone is at pos32. So after moving to pos53, the agent needs to return to push the stone.

This seems inefficient, but considering the constraints, it's necessary.

So possible steps:

1. Move agent from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown) to satisfy pos15 later.

Wait, no. To reach pos15, the agent needs to move from pos24 to pos14 (dirleft), then to pos13 (dirup), pos12 (dirup), pos11 (dirup), but that's not helpful. Alternatively, from pos24, move to pos25 (dirdown), then to pos15 (dirleft). 

But moving from pos25 to pos15: pos25 is row2, column5. dirleft (up a row) would be to pos15 (row1, column5). Is that allowed? 

From pos25's allowed moves: "You may move from location pos25 to location pos15 following direction dirleft". Yes. So the agent can move pos25 -> pos15 via dirleft. 

So steps to reach pos15:

pos24 -> pos25 (dirdown)

pos25 -> pos15 (dirleft)

This satisfies the constraint of being at pos15.

Then, the agent needs to reach pos53. From pos15, move to pos25 (dirright), then to pos35 (dirright), pos45 (dirright), pos55 (dirright). Then from pos55, move to pos54 (dirup), then to pos53 (dirup). 

But during this movement, the agent is moving through pos35, pos45, etc. But pos45 needs to be not clear at some point before pos55 is not clear (when the stone is placed there). So if the agent is at pos45, that location is not clear, which could satisfy the precondition for the pos55 constraint.

But the stone is still at pos32. So after visiting pos53, the agent needs to return to pos32 to push the stone.

This seems very long, but considering the constraints, it's necessary.

Once the agent is at pos53, according to the constraint, stone1 must be at pos42 or later. So after the agent reaches pos53, the stone needs to be at pos42 or later in the plan.

So the agent's path would be:

pos24 -> pos25 -> pos15 (constraint met)

pos15 -> pos25 -> pos35 -> pos45 -> pos55 -> pos54 -> pos53 (constraint met)

Then, from pos53, the agent needs to move back to the stone's area to push it towards pos55. 

But this is time-consuming. 

Alternatively, the agent could push the stone to pos42 before going to pos53. But how?

After the initial steps, the agent is at pos15. Then, the agent needs to move back to pos25, pos35, etc., to reach the stone.

But this seems inefficient. Perhaps a better plan is to push the stone first, then visit the required positions.

Alternative plan:

1. Push stone from pos32 to pos42 (dirright). But to do that, the agent must be at pos22, which is forbidden. So impossible.

So the only way to push the stone is west or east. 

Earlier, we considered pushing the stone from pos32 to pos31. Then, agent is at pos32. Then, move to pos33, pos43, pos53. 

But after pushing to pos31, the agent is at pos32. Then, moving to pos33 (dirdown), pos34 (dirdown), pos44 (dirright), pos54 (dirright), pos53 (dirup). This satisfies visiting pos53. 

At pos53, the constraint requires that stone1 is at pos42 or later. So after visiting pos53, the stone must be moved to pos42 or beyond. 

But after pushing to pos31, the stone is at pos31. The agent needs to push it further towards pos55.

So after pos53, the agent can return to the stone's location and push it south.

But this is getting too long. Let's try to outline a step-by-step plan.

Steps:

1. Move agent from pos24 to pos34 (dirright). 

2. Move agent from pos34 to pos33 (dirup). 

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirup. Now, stone is at pos31, agent at pos32.

4. Move agent from pos32 to pos42 (dirright). 

Now, agent is at pos42.

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos31 pos41 dirup. Push stone from pos31 to pos41. Agent ends at pos31.

6. Move agent from pos31 to pos41 (dirright). 

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos41 pos51 dirright. Wait, can't push from pos41 to pos51. Because the agent is at pos41, the stone is at pos41. Wait, this is not possible.

Alternative approach after step 5: stone is at pos41. Agent is at pos31. 

Agent needs to push the stone from pos41 to pos51 (dirright). But to do that, agent must be at pos41's north (pos31), and push dirright. 

Yes.

So step 5: stone at pos41, agent at pos31.

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos41 pos51 dirright. 

Now, stone is at pos51, agent at pos41.

7. Move agent from pos41 to pos51 (dirright). 

But pos51 is now occupied by the stone. So can't move there. So agent must find another path.

Alternatively, after step 5, stone is at pos41. Agent is at pos31. Agent can move to pos41 (dirright), then push the stone to pos51.

Yes:

6. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright.

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos41 pos51 dirright. 

But pos51 is a non-goal. Then, push to pos55 (goal).

But pos51 to pos55 is dirright (down a row). So agent needs to be at pos51's north (pos41) to push it south.

But after step 7, stone is at pos51. Agent is at pos41.

8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos51 pos55 dirright.

But pos55 is a goal. So this action is valid.

Now, stone is at pos55, satisfying the goal.

Now, check constraints:

- Constraint 1: At least one state where stone is at pos34 or pos43 not clear. In this plan, the stone is at pos34? No, it's moved from 32 to 31, 41, 51, 55. So pos43 is never occupied. But the agent moves through pos33, 34, etc. But pos43 is only visited if the agent moves there. Wait, in the steps outlined, the agent is at pos33, pos34, pos42, pos31, pos41, pos51. So pos43 is never visited. So to satisfy the first constraint, we need to have either stone at pos34 or pos43 not clear. Since the stone is never at pos34, we need to make pos43 not clear. So the agent must visit pos43.

But in the current plan, pos43 is not visited. So this constraint is not satisfied. Therefore, the plan is invalid.

So we need to adjust the plan to ensure that either stone is at pos34 or agent/stone is at pos43.

So perhaps after pushing the stone to pos31, the agent moves to pos43.

For example:

After step 3 (stone at pos31, agent at pos32):

4. Move agent from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown).

5. Move agent from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown).

6. Move agent from pos34 to pos44 (dirright).

7. Move agent from pos44 to pos43 (dirup).

Now, agent is at pos43, making it not clear. This satisfies the first constraint.

Then, proceed to push the stone towards pos55.

But this adds steps. Also, need to ensure that when the agent is at pos53, the stone is at pos42 or later.

So integrating this:

After step 7 (agent at pos43):

8. Move agent from pos43 to pos53 (dirright to pos53). Or via pos44, pos54, pos53.

But need to reach pos53.

Alternative steps:

4. After step 3 (agent at pos32):

   a. Move to pos33 (dirdown).

   b. Move to pos34 (dirdown).

   c. Move to pos44 (dirright).

   d. Move to pos54 (dirright).

   e. Move to pos53 (dirup).

Now, agent is at pos53, satisfying that constraint. But according to the constraint, when agent is at pos53, stone must be at pos42 or later. Currently, stone is at pos31. So this violates the constraint.

Thus, need to ensure that after agent is at pos53, the stone is moved to pos42 or later.

So perhaps the agent must push the stone to pos42 before going to pos53.

But how?

Alternative plan:

1. Move agent to pos33, push stone to pos33 (east), but that's not possible.

Alternatively, after step 3 (stone at pos31), agent moves to pos32, then pos42, then push stone to pos43.

But pos43 is a non-goal. Then, the agent is at pos43. This would satisfy the first constraint (pos43 not clear).

Then, proceed to push the stone to pos44, pos45, pos55.

But this requires more steps.

Alternatively, after pushing stone to pos31, agent moves to pos42, then pushes stone to pos43.

But how?

Agent at pos32, move to pos42 (dirright). 

Then, from pos42, push stone from pos31 to pos41 (dirleft), but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, the agent is at pos42. The stone is at pos31. To push it to pos32 (east), the agent needs to be at pos31's west (pos21, forbidden) or north (pos22, forbidden). So impossible.

This is getting very complex. Given the time constraints, I'll try to draft a plan that satisfies all constraints, even if it's not optimal, and then refine it.

Final Plan Outline:

1. Move agent from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown).

2. Move to pos15 (dirleft) to satisfy pos15 constraint.

3. Move back to pos25, then pos35, pos45, pos55, pos54, pos53 to satisfy pos53 constraint. Ensure that after visiting pos53, stone is at pos42 or later.

4. Move agent back to stone's location and push to pos55.

But during this, the stone needs to be at pos42 or later after pos53.

Alternatively, push the stone to pos42 before visiting pos53.

But how to do that.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos42:

1. Agent is at pos32.

2. Move to pos42 (dirright).

3. Push stone to pos43 (dirdown).

But agent at pos42 can push stone from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown). But this requires the stone to be at pos43.

Alternatively, after step 3 (stone at pos31), agent moves to pos32, then pos42.

Then, agent can push stone from pos31 to pos41 (dirleft).

But this doesn't help.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I think I need to look for a different approach. Perhaps the optimal plan is as follows:

```

move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright

move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirup

move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos31 pos41 dirup

move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos51 pos41 pos55 dirright

```

But this doesn't satisfy all constraints. For example, the agent must visit pos15 and pos53. Also, the constraint that when pos55 is not clear, pos45 or pos25 was not clear earlier. In this plan, pos41 and pos51 are occupied, but pos45 is not. So the constraint is not met.

Another approach: Push the stone to pos34, which satisfies the first constraint. Then push it to pos44, pos45, pos55.

To push to pos34:

Agent is at pos24, move to pos34 (dirright).

Then, from pos34, push the stone from pos32 to pos34 (dirdown). Wait, stone is at pos32, to push east (dirdown) to pos33, but agent must be west of the stone.

This is getting too time-consuming. Given the time, I'll provide a plan that attempts to meet all constraints, even if not perfect.
