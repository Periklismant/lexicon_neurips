move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos43 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos34 dirleft
``` 

Wait, wait. After pushing from pos42 to pos43, the agent is at pos42. Then pushing from pos43 to pos44 requires the agent to be at pos43's west (pos42). So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirdown. Then the agent moves to pos43. 

Then from pos43, how to push to pos34. pos44 to pos34 is north (dirleft). The agent needs to be at pos44's south (pos54) to push north. So the previous plan is incorrect. 

But in the answer I wrote earlier, the assistant provided a plan with 6 steps, which is incorrect. So I need to correct this. 

Let me re-express the correct plan. 

The correct plan should be:

1. Move from pos12 to pos22 (dirright).

2. Move from pos22 to pos21 (dirup).

3. Move from pos21 to pos31 (dirright).

4. Move from pos31 to pos41 (dirright).

5. Push from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown), agent ends up at pos42.

6. Push from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown), agent ends up at pos43.

7. Move from pos43 to pos53 (dirdown).

8. Move from pos53 to pos54 (dirdown).

9. Push from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft), agent ends up at pos44.

This totals 9 actions. But maybe there's a shorter path. 

Wait, after step6, the agent is at pos43. From there, can they move to pos44's south (pos54) directly? 

pos43 is (4,3). pos54 is (5,4). So the agent needs to move south (dirright) to pos53 (5,3), then east (dirdown) to pos54 (5,4). Two moves. Then push. So steps7-9 are necessary. 

But perhaps there's a way to push the stone from pos44 to pos34 in fewer steps. 

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos44, the agent can move around to pos34's south (pos44) and push north. But pos34 is already the goal. Wait, no. pos34 is the destination. The stone is at pos44. To push to pos34, the agent must be south of pos44 (pos54), then push north (dirleft). 

So the correct plan is nine steps. 

But the initial attempt had only 6 steps, which is incorrect. So the correct answer is the nine-step plan. 

But the user asked for an optimal plan with minimal steps. So I need to provide that. 

Another approach: After the second push (stone at pos44, agent at pos43), instead of moving to pos54, perhaps the agent can move east to pos44's west (pos43), then push north. But pos44's north is pos34, so the agent must be south of pos44 (pos54) to push north. 

Therefore, the nine-step plan is the minimal. 

But maybe there's a way to push the stone from pos44 to pos34 in one action. 

Yes: agent is at pos44's south (pos54), pushes north (dirleft) to pos34. 

But how does the agent get to pos54? 

From pos43, the agent moves to pos53 (dirdown), then to pos54 (dirdown). 

So steps 7 and 8 are needed. 

Thus, the correct plan is nine steps. 

But in the initial answer, the assistant provided a 6-step plan, which is incorrect. So I need to correct that. 

The correct answer is:

```
move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright
move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos43 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirdown
move player1 pos43 pos53 dirdown
move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirleft
```

But the user requested the plan to be optimal. Let's see if this is indeed optimal. 

Is there a shorter path? Let's think differently. 

What if the agent moves to pos32 first, then pushes the stone south to pos43, then east to pos44, then north to pos34. 

Let's see:

1. move pos12 → pos22 (dirright)

2. move pos22 → pos32 (dirright)

3. push pos32 → pos42 to pos43 (dirdown). But pos42 is south of pos32. So agent at pos32 can push south (dirright) to pos43. 

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos32.

- Stone at pos42.

- pos43 is clear.

- Can move from pos32 to pos42 (dirright/south). According to allowed movements, from pos32: "You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright". Yes.

- Can move from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown/east). Yes.

So action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos43 dirright. 

After this, agent is at pos42. 

Then push from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown), agent at pos43. 

Then move to pos53 and pos54, then push north. 

This path would have:

1. move to pos22

2. move to pos32

3. push to pos43

4. push to pos44

5. move to pos53

6. move to pos54

7. push to pos34

Total 7 steps. 

But is this possible? Let's check the third action:

Action3: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos43 dirright. 

The direction is dirright (south). So from pos32 to pos42 (south), then from pos42 to pos43 (east/dirdown). Wait, the direction must be the same for both movements. The action requires that the agent can move from l_p to l_from via direction d, and l_from to l_to via direction d. 

But in this case, dirright (south) from pos32 to pos42, and dirright (south) from pos42 to pos43. But pos42 to pos43 is east, not south. So this is invalid. 

Therefore, the direction must be the same for both movements. Therefore, this approach won't work. 

So the agent cannot push the stone east from pos42 using dirright (south). 

Therefore, the initial plan is still the correct one. 

Another approach: After step5 (stone at pos43, agent at pos42), perhaps the agent can move east to pos43 (but it's occupied by the stone), so no. 

Alternatively, move south to pos52, then east to pos53, etc. 

But this would require more steps. 

Thus, the nine-step plan is optimal.

<｜end▁of▁thinking｜>

The correct sequence involves moving the agent to pos41 to push the stone east to pos43, then east to pos44, then navigating to pos54 to push it north to the goal pos34. This requires 9 actions as outlined.
