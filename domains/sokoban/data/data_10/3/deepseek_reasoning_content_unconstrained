Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to get stone1 to a goal location, which in this case is pos34. The initial state has the agent at pos12 and stone1 at pos42. The grid is a 5x5, so positions go from pos11 to pos55. 

First, I need to figure out how to move the agent from pos12 to pos42, where the stone is. Then, push the stone towards pos34. Let me map out the possible paths.

The agent starts at pos12. To get to pos42, they need to move down or right. Let's see the movement possibilities. From pos12, they can go to pos22 (right), pos11 (up), or pos13 (down). Wait, but pos42 is in the fourth row. So maybe moving right first to pos22, then down? Or maybe moving down to pos13, then right?

Alternatively, maybe moving right to pos22, then right again to pos32, then right to pos42. Wait, let me check the allowed movements. The movement directions are given in the problem's state. For example, from pos12, moving right takes them to pos22. From pos22, moving right would take them to pos32. From pos32, moving right to pos42. That seems possible. Let's verify:

- From pos12, can move to pos22 (right direction). Then from pos22 to pos32 (right direction). From pos32 to pos42 (right direction). Yes, because the allowed moves include "You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright". So the path is pos12 -> pos22 (right), pos22 -> pos32 (right), pos32 -> pos42 (right). So that's three move actions.

Once the agent is at pos42, they need to push the stone. The stone is at pos42. Wait, in the initial state, stone1 is at pos42. But the agent can't be at the same location as the stone. Wait, the initial state says "player1 is at location pos12" and "stone1 is at location pos42". Also, "Location pos42 is clear" is in the original state. Wait, no: the original state lists "Location pos42 is clear" but also says "stone1 is at pos42". That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe I need to recheck.

Wait, the original state says:

"stone1 is at location pos42"

But also, "Location pos42 is clear". That's a problem because if the stone is there, the location shouldn't be clear. Wait, maybe that's a typo in the problem? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again.

Looking back: The original state includes "stone1 is at location pos42" and "Location pos42 is clear". That's contradictory because if a stone is at pos42, that location is not clear. Unless "clear" refers to the agent not being there. Wait, maybe "clear" means that there's nothing (no agent or stone) in that location. But if the stone is there, then it's not clear. So that's a contradiction. But according to the problem statement, this is the original state. Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake here, but I have to work with the given information.

Wait, maybe "clear" refers to the presence of the agent. Because stones can be at locations, but "clear" might mean the agent isn't there. Let me check the action preconditions. For the move action, "location l_to is clear" probably means that there's no agent or stone there. Because when the agent moves, they need the destination to be empty. But according to the original state, pos42 has the stone but is marked as clear. That must be an error. But since the problem states this, perhaps "clear" in the problem's context refers only to the agent not being present. But that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, and pos42 is not clear. But according to the problem's original state, the stone is at pos42, and pos42 is clear. That's conflicting. Unless "clear" here is a mistake. Hmm. This could be a problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem's original state has a typo, and "Location pos42 is clear" is incorrect. Because if the stone is at pos42, that location can't be clear. But according to the given problem, the initial state lists both "stone1 is at pos42" and "Location pos42 is clear". That's impossible. Therefore, there's a mistake here. But since I have to work with the given information, maybe the problem intended that the stone is at pos42 and that location is not clear. But in that case, how can the agent push it? Because if the stone is at pos42, the agent needs to be adjacent to it to push. Wait, maybe the problem's original state is correct, and "clear" refers to the agent's presence. So a location is clear if the agent isn't there. In that case, stones can be present but the location is still considered clear. That's possible. So, in the move action's preconditions, when it says "location l_to is clear", it just means the agent isn't there. So stones can be at locations, but the agent can't move into a location occupied by a stone. So in the initial state, pos42 has the stone, but since the agent isn't there, it's considered clear. That makes sense. So moving to pos42 would require that pos42 is clear (i.e., no agent there), but if there's a stone, the agent can't move there. Therefore, the agent can't move into a location with a stone. Therefore, the agent must navigate around stones or push them.

Wait, but in the move action's preconditions, (ii) says "location l_to is clear". So if a stone is at l_to, then the location is not clear. Therefore, the agent can't move into a location with a stone. Therefore, in the original state, pos42 has a stone and is considered not clear. But according to the problem's original state, "Location pos42 is clear". That's conflicting. Therefore, this must be a mistake in the problem. But since the problem states that pos42 is clear and the stone is there, maybe the definition of "clear" is that the agent is not there, regardless of stones. So stones don't block movement. But that's not logical. Alternatively, perhaps "clear" in the problem refers to the presence of the agent. But that would be inconsistent with the usual Sokoban-like rules. 

This is a critical point. Let me check the problem's action definitions again. The move action's preconditions require that l_to is clear. The effects of move are that the agent leaves l_from and moves to l_to, making l_from clear and l_to not clear. So "clear" refers to the presence of the agent, not stones. Therefore, a location can have a stone and still be considered clear (for the purposes of the move action) as long as the agent isn't there. So in the initial state, pos42 has stone1, but since the agent isn't there, it's considered clear. Therefore, the agent can move to pos42 if it's allowed. Wait, but moving to pos42 would require that l_to (pos42) is clear, which it is (agent not there), even if there's a stone. But then, when the agent moves to pos42, the stone is already there. That would mean two entities (agent and stone) are at the same location, which is impossible. Therefore, the problem's initial state is inconsistent. 

This is a problem. How can the problem state that pos42 is clear (agent not there) and also has the stone there? Unless the stones are allowed to coexist with the agent. But that's not typical. So perhaps the problem's initial state is correct in that the stone is at pos42, and the agent is at pos12, so pos42 is clear (agent not there), even though the stone is there. So "clear" in this context only refers to the agent's presence, not the stone's. Therefore, the move action can be used to move to a location that has a stone, as long as the agent isn't there. But that would lead to the agent and stone being in the same location, which would make the state invalid. Therefore, this can't be the case. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem's "clear" refers to the absence of both agent and stones. So if a stone is present, the location is not clear. Therefore, the initial state has a contradiction. Because in the problem, pos42 has the stone but is also stated as clear. That's a problem. Therefore, perhaps there's a typo in the problem's original state. Maybe the stone is at pos42, and pos42 is not clear. But according to the problem, the original state lists "Location pos42 is clear". 

Wait, let me check the original state again. The original state includes:

"Location pos12 is clear"

"Location pos42 is clear"

But also:

"stone1 is at location pos42"

So if a location having a stone makes it not clear, then the original state is contradictory. Therefore, this must be an error in the problem. But since I have to work with the problem as given, perhaps "clear" here means that the agent is not present, and stones are allowed. Therefore, the agent can move to a location with a stone, but that's impossible because the stone is there. So perhaps the problem's definition of "clear" is that the location has neither agent nor stone. Then the problem's initial state is invalid, but given that, perhaps the correct way is to proceed under the assumption that "clear" means no agent or stone. Therefore, in the initial state, pos42 has a stone and thus is not clear, but the problem states it is clear. That's a conflict. But perhaps the problem intended that the stone is at pos42, and pos42 is not clear, but the problem's list of clear locations includes pos42. This is confusing. 

This is a critical point. Let's try to proceed. Let's assume that "clear" means that there is no agent in the location. So stones can be in a location, but as long as the agent isn't there, the location is considered clear. Therefore, the agent can move to a location that has a stone, but that would result in both being there. Which is impossible. Therefore, the move action's precondition (ii) that l_to is clear (agent not there) is necessary, but the stone's presence would not affect that. Therefore, the agent can move to a location with a stone. But that would lead to the agent and stone being in the same location. Which is impossible, so the move action's preconditions must also require that l_to is clear of stones. But according to the problem's action definitions, the move action's preconditions only require that l_to is clear (which may only refer to the agent). 

This is very confusing. Let me recheck the problem's action definitions. 

The move action's preconditions: (i) agent is at l_from, (ii) l_to is clear, (iii) can move from l_from to l_to via direction d. The effects are that agent leaves l_from and moves to l_to, l_from becomes clear, l_to is no longer clear. So "clear" refers to the agent's presence. Therefore, a location is clear if the agent is not there. Stones can be present, but the agent can't move into a location with a stone, because the stone is blocking. Wait, but according to the problem's definition, the move action's preconditions don't check for stones. So if a location has a stone but no agent, it's considered clear. Therefore, the agent can move into that location, but then the stone would be there. But that's impossible. Therefore, the move action's preconditions must implicitly require that the location is free of stones as well. But according to the problem's description, the preconditions for "move" are only (i) agent is at l_from, (ii) l_to is clear (agent not there), (iii) movement allowed. So perhaps the problem allows the agent to move into a location with a stone, which would then make the location have both agent and stone. But that's invalid. Therefore, this must be an error in the problem's setup.

But given the problem as stated, perhaps the stones and agent can coexist. But that's unlikely. So perhaps the correct interpretation is that a location is clear if there's no agent or stone. Therefore, in the initial state, pos42 has a stone and is not clear, but the problem says it is. Therefore, there's a contradiction. But maybe the problem has a typo, and pos42 is not a clear location. But the original state lists "Location pos42 is clear". 

This is a significant issue. Given that, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the problem's original state is correct, even if it seems contradictory. So stone1 is at pos42, and pos42 is clear. Therefore, the agent can move to pos42, even though the stone is there. But then, when the agent moves there, they would be at the same location as the stone. Which is not allowed. Therefore, the move action cannot be used to move into a location with a stone, even if it's considered clear (agent not there). Therefore, the move action's preconditions must also require that the location is free of stones. But the problem's description doesn't mention that. Therefore, this is a problem with the problem's description.

Alternatively, perhaps the stones are considered part of the location's clear status. So if a stone is present, the location is not clear. Therefore, the initial state's assertion that pos42 is clear is incorrect, but given that the problem states it, perhaps there's a mistake. 

This is really challenging. Let me think of possible ways to proceed. 

The goal is to get stone1 to a goal location, which is pos34. The agent starts at pos12, and stone1 is at pos42. The available actions are move, pushtogoal, and pushtonongoal. 

To push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. For example, to push the stone north, the agent must be south of it. So the agent needs to get to a position adjacent to the stone. The stone is at pos42. So the agent needs to be at pos32 (north of pos42), pos41 (west), pos43 (east), or pos52 (south). 

Looking at the movement possibilities, from the agent's starting position at pos12, how can they get to pos32? Let's map a path. 

Starting at pos12:

pos12 can move right to pos22 (dirright). From pos22, move right to pos32 (dirright). Then from pos32, move down to pos42? But pos42 has the stone. Wait, the agent can't move into pos42 if it's occupied by the stone. Unless the move action allows that. But according to the problem's move preconditions, the agent can move to a location if it's clear (agent not there), but if the stone is there, the agent can't move there. So to push the stone, the agent must be adjacent and then use a push action. 

So the agent needs to reach a position adjacent to pos42. Let's see possible adjacent positions. pos32 (above), pos41 (left), pos43 (right), pos52 (below). 

Looking at pos32: From pos12, move right to pos22, then right to pos32. Then the agent is at pos32, which is north of pos42 (stone's location). From there, the agent can push the stone south (dirdown) to pos43? Wait, no. If the agent is at pos32, pushing the stone south (down) would require that the stone is at pos32's south, which is pos42. So the stone is at pos42, which is south of pos32. So the agent can push the stone south from pos32 to pos43? Wait, pos42's south is pos52. Wait, directions might be a bit confusing. Let's clarify the grid layout.

Assuming pos11 is top-left, pos51 is bottom-left, pos15 is top-right, pos55 is bottom-right. So rows are from 1 (top) to 5 (bottom), columns 1 (left) to 5 (right). Therefore, moving down increases the row number. So pos32 is row 3, column 2. pos42 is row 4, column 2. So south of pos32 is pos42. East of pos32 is pos33. West is pos31. North is pos22. 

So the agent at pos32 (row3, column2) can move south to pos42 (row4, column2). But pos42 has the stone. So the agent can't move there via move action. Instead, the agent needs to push the stone. 

But to push the stone, the agent must be at a position adjacent to the stone and in the direction from which the push is coming. For example, to push the stone south (down) from pos42, the agent must be north of it (pos32) and push it south. The action would be pushtogoal or pushtonongoal, depending on where the stone is being pushed to. 

The goal location is pos34. So we need to get stone1 from pos42 to pos34. Let's plan the path for the stone: pos42 → pos43 → pos44 → pos34. Wait, pos44 is east of pos43, which is east of pos42. But pos34 is north of pos44. Alternatively, another path. 

Wait, pos42 is row4, column2. The goal is pos34 (row3, column4). So the stone needs to move from (4,2) to (3,4). That's up one row and right two columns. But how can that be done with pushes? 

Let's think step by step. The agent needs to push the stone from pos42 to pos43 (east), then pos43 to pos44 (east), then pos44 to pos34 (north). Or alternatively, another path. 

But first, the agent must reach a position adjacent to the stone. Let's assume the agent moves to pos32. From pos32, they can push the stone south to pos43 (if pos43 is clear). Wait, pos43 is clear according to the initial state. So pushing from pos32 (agent at pos32) to pos42 (stone's location), direction dirdown (south) would move the stone to pos43. Because the direction from l_p (pos32) to l_from (pos42) is south (dirdown). Wait, no: the direction from pos32 to pos42 is south (since pos42 is south of pos32). So to push the stone from pos42 to pos43 (east), the agent needs to be west of the stone. So the agent would need to be at pos41, west of pos42. Because pushing east requires the agent to be west of the stone. 

Alternatively, the agent could be at pos32 (north of pos42) and push the stone east. Wait, but to push east, the agent must be west of the stone. So that's not possible. To push east, the agent must be at pos42's west (pos41) and push east. 

Wait, the direction in the push actions refers to the direction the stone is moving. For example, to push the stone east, the agent must be west of the stone. So for the stone at pos42, to push it east to pos43, the agent must be at pos42's west, which is pos41. So the agent needs to get to pos41. 

Alternatively, another approach. Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Move the agent from pos12 to pos41, adjacent to the stone at pos42.

But how to get from pos12 to pos41? Let's find a path. Starting at pos12:

pos12 → pos22 (right), then pos22 → pos32 (right), pos32 → pos42 (right). But pos42 has the stone, so can't move there. Wait, but according to the initial state, pos42 is clear (agent not there), but has the stone. So moving there would require that pos42 is clear (agent not there), which it is. But after moving, the agent would be at pos42, which has the stone. That's invalid. So perhaps the agent cannot move into pos42. Therefore, the agent must find another path to pos41.

Alternative path from pos12:

pos12 → pos22 (right), pos22 → pos21 (up), pos21 → pos31 (right), pos31 → pos41 (right). Let's check if this is possible.

- pos12 to pos22 (dirright) is allowed.

- pos22 to pos21 (dirup) is allowed? The allowed movements list "You may move from location pos22 to location pos21 following direction dirup". Yes.

- pos21 to pos31 (dirright): Allowed. From pos21, movement right to pos31.

- pos31 to pos41 (dirright): Allowed. Yes, from pos31 to pos41 via dirright.

So that's four move actions: move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright; move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup; move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright; move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright. 

Once at pos41, the agent is west of the stone at pos42. Then, they can push the stone east to pos43. Since pos43 is a non-goal location, we need to use pushtonongoal. Wait, pos43 is not a goal location (as per the original state: "pos43 is not a goal location"). The goal is to get the stone to pos34, which is a goal location. So the agent needs to push the stone east to pos43 (non-goal), then further east to pos44 (non-goal), then north to pos34 (goal). 

But each push action must be either pushtogoal (if the destination is a goal) or pushtonongoal (if not). 

So the first push would be from pos42 to pos43 (non-goal), so use pushtonongoal. Then from pos43 to pos44 (non-goal), again pushtonongoal. Then from pos44 to pos34 (goal), use pushtogoal. 

But each time, the agent must be in the correct position to push. 

Let's break it down step by step.

1. After moving to pos41, the agent is at pos41, adjacent to pos42 (stone's location) to the east. So the agent can push the stone east from pos42 to pos43. 

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos43 dirright. 

Preconditions check:

- Agent is at pos41: yes.

- Stone is at pos42: yes.

- pos43 is clear: initial state says pos43 is clear.

- Can move from pos41 to pos42 following dirright? The allowed movements include "You may move from location pos41 to location pos42 following direction dirdown". Wait, pos41 to pos42 is south (dirdown). Because pos41 is row4, column1; pos42 is row4, column2. Wait, no. Wait, pos41 is row4, column1. pos42 is row4, column2. So east direction would be dirright. Wait, the problem's directions: dirright is east, dirleft is west, dirup is north, dirdown is south. So from pos41 to pos42 is east (dirright) or south? Wait, pos41 is (4,1), pos42 is (4,2). So east. So the movement from pos41 to pos42 is dirright. But looking at the allowed movements:

The original state includes "You may move from location pos41 to location pos42 following direction dirdown". Wait, that must be a mistake. Because moving from pos41 (4,1) to pos42 (4,2) is east, not down. But according to the problem's list, "You may move from location pos41 to location pos42 following direction dirdown". That's a south direction, which would be pos51. Wait, this seems incorrect. There's a mistake in the problem's allowed movements. Because pos41 to pos42 is east, but the problem says direction dirdown. That's a problem. So according to the problem's allowed movements, moving from pos41 to pos42 is south. Which is impossible, because pos41 is row4, column1; pos42 is row4, column2. So east. Therefore, the problem has an error here. 

But given the problem's allowed movements as stated, "You may move from location pos41 to location pos42 following direction dirdown" would imply that pos42 is south of pos41. But pos41 is row4, column1. South would be row5, column1. So pos51. So the allowed movement from pos41 to pos42 via dirdown must be a mistake. It's possible that this is a typo, and the intended direction is dirright. But given that, we have to work with the problem's data. 

According to the problem's allowed movements list, the agent can move from pos41 to pos42 via dirdown. So even though geographically it's east, the direction is considered down. This suggests that the grid's movement directions are not aligned with typical cardinal directions. This is confusing. Therefore, perhaps the directions are different. Maybe dirright is east, dirleft is west, dirdown is south, dirup is north. But according to the allowed movements:

For example, "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright". pos11 is (1,1), pos21 is (2,1). So moving from pos11 to pos21 is south, but the direction is dirright. That contradicts typical directions. Therefore, the directions in this problem are not as expected. 

This is a critical issue. Let's look at some of the allowed movements to understand the direction mapping. 

For example, pos11 can move to pos21 (dirright). pos11 is (1,1), pos21 is (2,1). So moving south is dirright. Another example: pos12 can move to pos22 (dirright). pos12 is (1,2), pos22 is (2,2). Again, moving south is dirright. So it seems that dirright corresponds to south, dirleft is north, dirup and dirdown are east and west. Or perhaps the directions are rotated. 

Alternatively, the directions are swapped. For example, dirright is south, dirleft is north, dirup is west, dirdown is east. That would make some sense. For example, moving from pos11 to pos21 (south) is dirright. Then, moving from pos21 to pos31 (south again) would also be dirright. But pos21 to pos31 is row3, column1. 

Alternatively, the directions are defined as:

- dirright: move down (increase row)

- dirleft: move up (decrease row)

- dirup: move left (decrease column)

- dirdown: move right (increase column)

This is a possible mapping. Let's check:

From pos11 (1,1), moving dirright takes you to pos21 (2,1) — which is south. So dirright is south.

From pos11 (1,1), moving dirdown takes you to pos12 (1,2) — which is east. So dirdown is east.

Similarly, from pos12 (1,2), moving dirright (south) to pos22 (2,2).

From pos12 (1,2), moving dirdown (east) to pos13 (1,3).

So the directions are as follows:

- dirright: south (row increases by 1)

- dirleft: north (row decreases by 1)

- dirup: west (column decreases by 1)

- dirdown: east (column increases by 1)

That's a rotated mapping of directions. So the directions are:

- dirright: south

- dirleft: north

- dirup: west

- dirdown: east

This is unconventional, but according to the allowed movements, that's how it's structured. 

For example, moving from pos41 to pos42 via dirdown (east) makes sense. Because pos41 is (4,1), moving east (dirdown) to pos42 (4,2). 

So the directions are:

- dirup: west

- dirdown: east

- dirleft: north

- dirright: south

This is crucial for planning. 

So, to move from pos41 (4,1) to pos42 (4,2), the direction is dirdown (east). 

Now, back to the plan. The agent needs to reach pos41 to push the stone east (dirdown) to pos43. Wait, no. If the agent is at pos41 (4,1), and the stone is at pos42 (4,2), pushing east (dirdown) would move the stone to pos43 (4,3). 

Wait, pos42 (4,2) to pos43 (4,3) is east, which corresponds to dirdown direction. 

So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos43 dirdown. 

Yes. 

So let's proceed.

The agent is at pos12 (1,2). To reach pos41 (4,1), which is row4, column1. The directions are:

From pos12 (1,2), move dirright (south) to pos22 (2,2).

From pos22 (2,2), move dirright (south) to pos32 (3,2).

From pos32 (3,2), move dirright (south) to pos42 (4,2). But pos42 has the stone, so can't move there. So that's a dead end. 

Alternative path: pos12 → pos13 (dirdown/east) → pos14 → pos15 → ... but that might not help. 

Alternatively, pos12 → pos22 (dirright/south) → pos21 (dirleft/north) → pos31 (dirright/south) → pos41 (dirright/south). 

Wait, pos12 → pos22 (dirright/south). Then from pos22, move dirup (west) to pos21. Then from pos21, move dirright (south) to pos31. Then from pos31, move dirright (south) to pos41. 

Yes. Let's check the allowed movements:

- pos12 to pos22 via dirright: allowed.

- pos22 to pos21 via dirup (north). The allowed movements include "You may move from location pos22 to location pos21 following direction dirup". Yes.

- pos21 to pos31 via dirright (south): allowed.

- pos31 to pos41 via dirright (south): allowed.

So that's four move actions. 

Once the agent is at pos41, they can push the stone east (dirdown) to pos43. 

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos43 dirdown. 

Preconditions check:

- Agent at pos41: yes.

- Stone at pos42: yes.

- pos43 is clear: yes (initial state says pos43 is clear).

- Can move from pos41 to pos42 via dirdown (east): yes, per allowed movement.

- Can move from pos42 to pos43 via dirdown (east): allowed? Looking at the allowed movements for pos42: "You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown". Yes.

- pos43 is not a goal location: correct.

So this action is valid. 

After this action, the stone is at pos43. The agent is now at pos42. 

Next, the agent needs to push the stone further east to pos44. To do that, the agent needs to be at pos43's west (pos42) and push east. But after the first push, the agent is at pos42. Wait, after the pushtonongoal action, the agent moves to pos42. So now the agent is at pos42, and the stone is at pos43. 

To push the stone east from pos43 to pos44, the agent needs to be at pos43's west (pos42) and push east (dirdown). So the agent is already at pos42. 

So the next action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirdown. 

Preconditions check:

- Agent at pos42: yes.

- Stone at pos43: yes.

- pos44 is clear: yes (initial state).

- Can move from pos42 to pos43 via dirdown (east): allowed? Check allowed movements for pos42: "You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown". Yes.

- Can move from pos43 to pos44 via dirdown (east): allowed? Yes, according to allowed movements for pos43: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown". 

- pos44 is not a goal location: correct.

So this action is valid. 

After this, the stone is at pos44. The agent is now at pos43. 

Next, push the stone north (dirleft) to pos34. Because pos44 is row4, column4. To push north (dirleft), the agent needs to be south of pos44 (pos54), but that's not possible. Wait, the direction mapping is different. To push north (dirleft), the agent needs to be south of the stone. Wait, the direction for pushing north would be dirleft, which corresponds to moving north. 

Wait, when pushing, the direction d must be the direction from the agent's location to the stone's location. Wait, no. The action is pushtogoal/pushtonongoal with parameters (p, s, l_p, l_from, l_to, d). The preconditions require that you can get from l_p to l_from via direction d, and from l_from to l_to via direction d. 

So to push the stone from pos44 to pos34 (north), the agent must be at a location l_p from which moving direction d leads to pos44 (l_from). And moving direction d from pos44 leads to pos34. 

pos44 is (4,4). pos34 is (3,4). So moving north (dirleft) from pos44 to pos34. Therefore, the direction d would be dirleft. 

So the agent must be at pos54 (south of pos44), but that's not possible. Alternatively, the agent can be at pos44's east or west. Wait, no. To push north (dirleft), the agent must be south of the stone. Because pushing north requires the agent to move in the same direction as the stone's movement. 

Wait, the direction d in the push action is the direction from l_p to l_from (stone's location), and from l_from to l_to. So to push the stone from pos44 to pos34 (north), the agent must be at a location south of pos44 (pos54) and push north. But pos54 is (5,4). 

But the agent is currently at pos43 after the second push. To get to pos54, the agent would need to move south (dirright) to pos53, then east (dirdown) to pos54. But that's a long path. Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos44, the agent is at pos43. They need to move around to get to pos44's south (pos54). 

Alternatively, find another way to push the stone north from pos44. 

Wait, maybe the agent can push the stone west to pos43, then north to pos33, but that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, after the stone is at pos44, the agent is at pos43. The agent needs to move to pos44's east (pos45) to push west, but that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, the agent can move from pos43 to pos44 (east) via dirdown. But pos44 is now occupied by the stone. So the agent can't move there. 

Wait, after the second push, the stone is at pos44, and the agent is at pos43. The agent needs to get to pos54 to push north. Let's plan the moves:

Agent at pos43. 

Possible path:

pos43 → pos42 (dirup/west), pos42 → pos41 (dirup/west), pos41 → pos51 (dirdown/east?), wait, directions are confusing. 

Alternatively, agent needs to move south (dirright) from pos43 to pos53. But according to allowed movements, from pos43: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirdown". Yes. 

So from pos43, move dirdown (east) to pos53. 

Wait, pos43 is (4,3). Moving dirdown (east) would take to (4,4) which is pos44, but pos44 has the stone. So can't move there. 

Alternatively, from pos43, move dirright (south) to pos53. 

Wait, pos43 is (4,3). South would be pos53 (5,3). But according to allowed movements: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirdown". So yes, pos43 to pos53 via dirdown (east) is allowed. 

Wait, according to the problem's allowed movements, from pos43: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirdown". So moving dirdown (east) from pos43 (4,3) to pos53 (5,3). That's possible. 

So agent moves from pos43 to pos53 via dirdown. Then from pos53, move dirright (south) to pos54. 

Wait, pos53 is (5,3). Moving dirright (south) would take to (6,3), which is out of bounds. So that's invalid. 

Alternative path: from pos53, move dirdown (east) to pos54. 

pos53 is (5,3). dirdown is east, so to (5,4) which is pos54. 

Check allowed movements: "You may move from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown". Yes. 

So agent moves from pos43 to pos53 (dirdown), then to pos54 (dirdown). 

Once at pos54, the agent can push the stone north (dirleft) from pos44 to pos34. 

Action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirleft. 

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos54: yes.

- Stone at pos44: yes.

- pos34 is clear: initially, pos34 is clear, but after previous actions, is it? After the stone was moved to pos44, the agent moved to pos43, then to pos53 and pos54. So pos34 should still be clear.

- Can move from pos54 to pos44 via dirleft (north). pos54 is (5,4). dirleft (north) would take to pos44 (4,4). 

Check allowed movements: "You may move from location pos54 to location pos44 following direction dirleft". Yes. 

- Can move from pos44 to pos34 via dirleft (north). pos44 to pos34 is north (row3, column4). 

Check allowed movements: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft". Yes. 

- pos34 is a goal location: yes. 

So this action is valid. 

After this action, the stone is at pos34 (goal), and the agent is at pos44. 

This achieves the goal. 

Putting it all together:

The sequence of actions is:

1. Move player1 from pos12 to pos22 via dirright.

2. Move player1 from pos22 to pos21 via dirup.

3. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 via dirright.

4. Move player1 from pos31 to pos41 via dirright.

5. Push the stone from pos42 to pos43 via dirdown using pushtonongoal.

6. Push the stone from pos43 to pos44 via dirdown using pushtonongoal.

7. Move player1 from pos43 to pos53 via dirdown.

8. Move player1 from pos53 to pos54 via dirdown.

9. Push the stone from pos44 to pos34 via dirleft using pushtogoal.

But wait, after step 5 (pushtonongoal), the agent is at pos42. So after step 5, the agent is at pos42. Then step 6 is to push from pos43 to pos44. But after step 5, the stone is at pos43. So step 6 requires the agent to be at pos43's west (pos42), which is where the agent is after step 5. 

So step 6: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirdown. 

After this, the agent is at pos43. 

Then steps to get to pos54 would be:

7. Move player1 from pos43 to pos53 via dirdown.

8. Move player1 from pos53 to pos54 via dirdown.

9. Push the stone from pos44 to pos34 via dirleft.

So the complete plan is:

move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright

move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup

move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright

move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos43 dirdown

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirdown

move player1 pos43 pos53 dirdown

move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirleft

But this has 9 actions. However, perhaps there's a shorter path. Let's see. 

After pushing the stone to pos44 (step6), the agent is at pos43. From pos43, can they move east (dirdown) to pos44? But pos44 has the stone. So no. So they have to go around. 

Alternatively, after step6, agent is at pos43. To reach pos54, they need to go south (dirright) to pos53, then east (dirdown) to pos54. 

But perhaps there's a way to push the stone to pos34 in fewer steps. 

Wait, after pushing the stone to pos44, maybe the agent can move from pos43 to pos44's west (pos43 is east of pos44?), no. pos43 is (4,3), pos44 is (4,4). So pos43 is west of pos44. To push pos44 north to pos34, the agent needs to be south of pos44 (pos54) and push north (dirleft). So the steps 7-9 are necessary. 

Alternatively, after step6, the stone is at pos44. The agent is at pos43. Can the agent move to pos44's east (pos45), then push west to pos44 to pos34? No, because pos45 is east of pos44. To push west, the agent would need to be east of the stone, but pos44 is at (4,4), so east is pos45. But pushing west from pos45 to pos44 would move the stone west to pos43, which is not helpful. 

Alternatively, after step6, the agent is at pos43. Can they move north (dirleft) to pos33, then east (dirdown) to pos34, but pos34 is a goal location. But the agent needs to be south of pos44 to push north. 

Alternatively, after step6, the agent is at pos43. They can move west (dirup) to pos42, then south (dirright) to pos52, then east (dirdown) to pos53, then east to pos54. But that's longer. 

Alternatively, from pos43, move south (dirright) to pos53, then east (dirdown) to pos54. That's two moves. Then push. 

So steps7 and 8 are needed. 

So the total plan is 9 actions. 

But is there a shorter way? Let's think again. 

Alternative approach: After moving the stone to pos44, instead of moving the agent all the way to pos54, perhaps there's a way to push the stone north from pos44 directly. 

But to push north (dirleft), the agent must be south of pos44 (pos54). So it's unavoidable. 

Therefore, the plan of 9 actions is the shortest possible. 

But wait, maybe there's a better path for the agent to reach pos54 faster. 

Alternative path after step6:

Agent is at pos43. To get to pos54:

move from pos43 to pos44 (if possible, but pos44 has the stone, so no).

move from pos43 to pos53 (dirdown/east), then pos53 to pos54 (dirdown/east). Two moves. 

Then push. So steps7-9 are necessary. 

So the total actions are:

1. move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright

2. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup

3. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright

4. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos43 dirdown

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirdown

7. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirdown

8. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown

9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirleft

That's nine actions. 

But perhaps there's a way to reduce the number of steps. For example, after step5, the agent is at pos42. Can they then push the stone from pos43 to pos44 without moving? 

No, because after step5, the stone is at pos43, and the agent is at pos42. To push the stone east (dirdown) to pos44, the agent needs to be at pos43's west (pos42), which they are. So step6 can be done directly. 

So steps5 and 6 are consecutive pushes. 

Then, the agent is at pos43. 

Now, from pos43 to pos53 and pos54 requires two moves. 

So steps7 and 8 are necessary. 

Then step9 is the final push. 

So nine actions. 

Is there a way to combine some moves or pushes? 

Alternatively, after step6 (stone at pos44, agent at pos43), can the agent move directly from pos43 to pos44's south (pos54) in fewer steps? 

But pos43 is (4,3). pos54 is (5,4). So the agent needs to move south (dirright) to pos53 (5,3), then east (dirdown) to pos54 (5,4). Two moves. 

Alternatively, can the agent move east (dirdown) from pos43 to pos44? No, because pos44 has the stone. 

Therefore, the plan as outlined is optimal, with nine actions. 

But maybe there's a shorter path. Let's re-examine the initial movement. 

Alternative path to reach pos41: 

pos12 → pos13 (dirdown/east), then pos14, pos15, etc. But that would take longer. 

Alternatively, from pos12, move right to pos22, then down to pos32, then left to pos31, then right to pos41? No, that's the same number of steps. 

Alternatively, is there a way to push the stone west instead of east? For example, agent moves to pos32 (north of pos42), then push the stone south to pos52, but pos52 is not a goal. Then push west to pos51, etc. But that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, after getting to pos32, push the stone south to pos43 (but pos43 is non-goal). Then push east to pos44, then north to pos34. This might require fewer steps. Let's see:

Agent starts at pos12. 

1. move pos12 → pos22 dirright

2. move pos22 → pos32 dirright

Now at pos32. 

Push the stone south (dirright) from pos42 to pos43. 

But wait, agent is at pos32. The stone is at pos42. To push south (dirright), the agent must be north of the stone. So from pos32 (north of pos42), push south (dirright) to pos43. 

Wait, the stone is at pos42. To push it south (dirright) to pos52. Because south of pos42 is pos52. Wait, pos42 is (4,2). South would be (5,2) pos52. So pushing south (dirright) would move the stone to pos52. But pos52 is not a goal. 

But the goal is to get to pos34. So this would not help. 

Alternatively, push east from pos42 to pos43. But agent is at pos32 (north of pos42). To push east (dirdown), the agent must be west of the stone. So this isn't possible. 

Therefore, the initial approach of going to pos41 and pushing east seems better. 

Therefore, the original plan of nine steps is the shortest possible.
