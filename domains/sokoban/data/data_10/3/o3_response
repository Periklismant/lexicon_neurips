It is impossible to devise any plan that fulfils every single constraint of the task simultaneously.  
In particular, the two constraints

 •  “Location pos41 is not clear must hold in at least one state; and  
 •  If Location pos41 is not clear holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which player1 is at location pos51”

cannot be satisfied together with the topological limitations of the grid:

– The only ways to enter pos51 are from pos41 or pos52.  
– pos52 can only be entered from pos42, pos51 or pos53.  
– pos42 initially contains the stone, so it is not clear; pos53 must stay clear for the whole plan; therefore the only viable route to pos51 is through pos41.  
– However, entering pos51 via pos41 inevitably produces a state in which pos41 is already “not clear”, but no previous state in which the player was in pos51 can exist, contradicting the required ordering.

Because this contradiction is rooted in the fixed connectivity of the grid and the unconditional nature of the two constraints, no sequence of allowed actions can overcome it; hence no valid plan exists.
