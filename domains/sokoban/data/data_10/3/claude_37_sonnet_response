Alright, I'm given a planning problem for a Sokoban-like game, where a player needs to push a stone to a goal location. Let me break down the problem:

1. The world is a 2D grid (5x5 in this case) with positions named posXY (where X and Y are coordinates from 1 to 5).
2. The player (player1) is initially at pos12, and the stone (stone1) is initially at pos42.
3. The goal is to get the stone to a goal location, which is only pos34.
4. The available actions are:
   - move: Move the player in a direction.
   - pushtogoal: Push a stone to a goal location.
   - pushtonongoal: Push a stone to a non-goal location.
5. There are several constraints we need to respect.

Let's first understand the constraints:
1. pos53 must always be clear.
2. pos15 must be not clear at least once.
3. player1 can never be at pos43.
4. pos14 must be not clear at least once.
5. stone1 can never be at pos43.
6. pos54 must be not clear at least once.
7. If pos54 is not clear, then there must be an earlier state where player1 is at pos51.
8. pos42 must be not clear at least once.
9. pos41 must be not clear at least once.
10. If pos41 is not clear, then there must be an earlier state where player1 is at pos51.
11. stone1 must be at pos42 at least once. (This is satisfied in the initial state already).
12. If stone1 is at pos42 at some state s, then pos24 must be not clear at s or some state after s.
13. pos44 must always be clear.

Now, I need to plan how to get the stone from pos42 to the goal location pos34.

The first insight is that I need to bring the player next to the stone to push it. The player is at pos12, and the stone is at pos42.

I also need to ensure that all the constraints are satisfied.

Let me think about a possible plan:

1. The player needs to move to a position next to the stone to push it. Given that the stone is at pos42, the player needs to be at either pos32, pos41, or pos43. Given that we can never have the player at pos43 (constraint 3) or the stone at pos43 (constraint 5), pushing the stone from pos42 to pos43 is not possible. So, we'll need to push it in another direction.

2. Considering the constraints, I think a sensible approach is to:
   - Move the player next to the stone.
   - Push the stone to the goal location (pos34).

However, there are additional constraints to consider. For instance, constraint 7 states that if pos54 is not clear, then player1 must have been at pos51 earlier. Similarly, constraint 10 states that if pos41 is not clear, then player1 must have been at pos51 earlier.

These constraints suggest that we might need to have the player move to pos51 at some point.

Let's try to construct a plan step by step:

The player starts at pos12 and needs to push the stone from pos42 to pos34.

I'll try one approach: Player moves from pos12 to pos32 (going right and down), then pushes the stone from pos42 to pos33 (pushing left). Then, pushing from pos33 to pos34 (pushing down, as the goal is at pos34).

Let's check if this satisfies all the constraints:
- Constraint 1: pos53 must always be clear. Our plan doesn't involve pos53, so it's satisfied.
- Constraint 2: pos15 must be not clear at least once. Our plan doesn't make pos15 not clear, so we might need to adjust.
- Constraint 3: player1 can never be at pos43. Our plan doesn't put the player at pos43, so it's satisfied.
- Constraint 4: pos14 must be not clear at least once. Our plan doesn't make pos14 not clear, so we might need to adjust.
- Constraint 5: stone1 can never be at pos43. Our plan doesn't put the stone at pos43, so it's satisfied.
- Constraint 6: pos54 must be not clear at least once. Our plan doesn't make pos54 not clear, so we might need to adjust.
- Constraint 7: If pos54 is not clear, then there must be an earlier state where player1 is at pos51. We're not making pos54 not clear in our current plan.
- Constraint 8: pos42 must be not clear at least once. Initially, the stone is at pos42, making it not clear, so this is satisfied.
- Constraint 9: pos41 must be not clear at least once. Our plan doesn't make pos41 not clear, so we might need to adjust.
- Constraint 10: If pos41 is not clear, then there must be an earlier state where player1 is at pos51. We're not making pos41 not clear in our current plan.
- Constraint 11: stone1 must be at pos42 at least once. The stone starts at pos42, so this is satisfied.
- Constraint 12: If stone1 is at pos42 at some state s, then pos24 must be not clear at s or some state after s. Our plan doesn't make pos24 not clear, so we might need to adjust.
- Constraint 13: pos44 must always be clear. Our plan doesn't involve pos44, so it's satisfied.

It seems like we need to make some adjustments to satisfy all the constraints. Specifically, we need to:
- Make pos15 not clear at least once.
- Make pos14 not clear at least once.
- Make pos54 not clear at least once (and ensure player1 is at pos51 before this).
- Make pos41 not clear at least once (and ensure player1 is at pos51 before this).
- Make pos24 not clear at some point during or after the stone is at pos42 (which is its initial position).

Let's revise our plan:

1. Move player1 from pos12 to pos51 (This is to set up for constraints 7 and 10).
2. Move player1 from pos51 to pos41 (Making pos41 not clear, which is required by constraint 9, and constraint 10 is satisfied because player1 was at pos51 earlier).
3. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31.
4. Move player1 from pos31 to pos32.
5. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos32 (now player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos32).
6. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43.
7. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (now player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos33).
8. Move player1 from pos32 to pos24 (Making pos24 not clear, which is required by constraint 12).
9. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23.
10. Move player1 from pos23 to pos33.
11. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos34 (now player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at the goal location pos34).

Let's check if this revised plan satisfies all the constraints:
- Constraint 1: pos53 must always be clear. Our plan doesn't involve pos53, so it's satisfied.
- Constraint 2: pos15 must be not clear at least once. Our plan still doesn't make pos15 not clear, so we need to adjust.
- Constraint 3: player1 can never be at pos43. Our plan puts the player at pos43 (step 6), so we need to adjust.
- Constraint 4: pos14 must be not clear at least once. Our plan doesn't make pos14 not clear, so we need to adjust.
- Constraint 5: stone1 can never be at pos43. Our plan doesn't put the stone at pos43, so it's satisfied.
- Constraint 6: pos54 must be not clear at least once. Our plan doesn't make pos54 not clear, so we need to adjust.
- Constraint 7: If pos54 is not clear, then there must be an earlier state where player1 is at pos51. We're not making pos54 not clear in our current plan.
- Constraint 8: pos42 must be not clear at least once. Initially, the stone is at pos42, making it not clear, so this is satisfied.
- Constraint 9: pos41 must be not clear at least once. Our plan makes pos41 not clear, so this is satisfied.
- Constraint 10: If pos41 is not clear, then there must be an earlier state where player1 is at pos51. Our plan ensures player1 is at pos51 before pos41 is not clear, so this is satisfied.
- Constraint 11: stone1 must be at pos42 at least once. The stone starts at pos42, so this is satisfied.
- Constraint 12: If stone1 is at pos42 at some state s, then pos24 must be not clear at s or some state after s. Our plan makes pos24 not clear, so this is satisfied.
- Constraint 13: pos44 must always be clear. Our plan doesn't involve pos44, so it's satisfied.

We still need to adjust for constraints 2, 3, 4, and 6.

Let's revise our plan again:

1. Move player1 from pos12 to pos13.
2. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14 (Making pos14 not clear, which is required by constraint 4).
3. Move player1 from pos14 to pos15 (Making pos15 not clear, which is required by constraint 2).
4. Move player1 from pos15 to pos25.
5. Move player1 from pos25 to pos35.
6. Move player1 from pos35 to pos45.
7. Move player1 from pos45 to pos55.
8. Move player1 from pos55 to pos54 (Making pos54 not clear, which is required by constraint 6).
9. Move player1 from pos54 to pos53. (This might conflict with constraint 1, which states pos53 must always be clear, so I need to check the exact meaning of "clear" in this context).
10. Move player1 from pos53 to pos52.
11. Move player1 from pos52 to pos51.
12. Move player1 from pos51 to pos41 (Making pos41 not clear, which is required by constraint 9, and constraint 10 is satisfied because player1 was at pos51 earlier).
13. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31.
14. Move player1 from pos31 to pos32.
15. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos32 (now player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos32).
16. Move player1 from pos42 to pos52.
17. Move player1 from pos52 to pos51.
18. Move player1 from pos51 to pos41.
19. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31.
20. Move player1 from pos31 to pos32.
21. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (now player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos33).
22. Move player1 from pos32 to pos22.
23. Move player1 from pos22 to pos23.
24. Move player1 from pos23 to pos24 (Making pos24 not clear, which is required by constraint 12).
25. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23.
26. Move player1 from pos23 to pos33.
27. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos34 (now player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at the goal location pos34).

But I'm still concerned about constraint 1, which requires pos53 to always be clear. In step 9 of our revised plan, player1 is at pos53, which might make it not clear. Let me check the exact semantics of "clear" in this domain.

From the problem description, a location is "clear" if it doesn't have an agent or a stone. So, if player1 is at pos53, it's not clear. This conflicts with constraint 1. I need to adjust the plan to ensure pos53 is always clear.

Let's revise our plan once more:

1. Move player1 from pos12 to pos13.
2. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14 (Making pos14 not clear, which is required by constraint 4).
3. Move player1 from pos14 to pos15 (Making pos15 not clear, which is required by constraint 2).
4. Move player1 from pos15 to pos25.
5. Move player1 from pos25 to pos35.
6. Move player1 from pos35 to pos45.
7. Move player1 from pos45 to pos55.
8. Move player1 from pos55 to pos54 (Making pos54 not clear, which is required by constraint 6).
9. Move player1 from pos54 to pos44.
10. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43. (This conflicts with constraint 3, which states player1 can never be at pos43. So I need to adjust.)

I'm starting to see that it's challenging to satisfy all the constraints simultaneously. Let's try a different approach.

Wait, I'm reading the constraints more closely:

Constraint 1 states: "Location pos53 is clear". It means pos53 must always be unoccupied (no player or stone).
Constraint 3 states: "player1 is not at location pos43". It means the player can never be at pos43.
Constraint.
I was right in my original interpretation.

Let's rethink our plan:

1. Move player1 from pos12 to pos13.
2. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14 (Making pos14 not clear, which is required by constraint 4).
3. Move player1 from pos14 to pos15 (Making pos15 not clear, which is required by constraint 2).
4. Move player1 from pos15 to pos25.
5. Move player1 from pos25 to pos35.
6. Move player1 from pos35 to pos45.
7. Move player1 from pos45 to pos55.
8. Move player1 from pos55 to pos54 (Making pos54 not clear, which is required by constraint 6).
9. Move player1 from pos54 to pos44.
10. Move player1 from pos44 to pos34.
11. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24 (Making pos24 not clear, which is required by constraint 12).
12. Move player1 from pos24 to pos25.
13. Move player1 from pos25 to pos35.
14. Move player1 from pos35 to pos45.
15. Move player1 from pos45 to pos55.
16. Move player1 from pos55 to pos54.
17. Move player1 from pos54 to pos52. (Skipping pos53 to satisfy constraint 1).
18. Move player1 from pos52 to pos51.
19. Move player1 from pos51 to pos41 (Making pos41 not clear, which is required by constraint 9, and constraint 10 is satisfied because player1 was at pos51 earlier).
20. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31.
21. Move player1 from pos31 to pos32.
22. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos32 (now player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos32).
23. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32.
24. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (now player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos33).
25. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33.
26. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos34 (now player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at the goal location pos34).

Wait, there's an inconsistency in steps 22-23 (player ends up at pos42 but starts at pos32 in the next step). Let me revise:

22. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos32 (after this, player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos32).
23. Move player1 from pos42 to pos52.
24. Move player1 from pos52 to pos42.
25. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32.
26. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (after this, player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos33).
27. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33.
28. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos34 (after this, player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at the goal location pos34).

Actually, I see another inconsistency: after step 22, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32. Then, in step 26, the player is pushing the stone from pos32, but after step the player is at pos33, which doesn't make sense. I need to be more careful with the effects of the actions. Let me refine my understanding:

When the player pushes the stone, the player replaces the stone's position and the stone moves one step in the direction. For example, if the player is at pos32 and pushes the stone from pos42 to pos52, after the action, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos52.

Let me revise the plan:

1. Move player1 from pos12 to pos13.
2. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14 (Making pos14 not clear, which is required by constraint 4).
3. Move player1 from pos14 to pos15 (Making pos15 not clear, which is required by constraint 2).
4. Move player1 from pos15 to pos25.
5. Move player1 from pos25 to pos35.
6. Move player1 from pos35 to pos45.
7. Move player1 from pos45 to pos55.
8. Move player1 from pos55 to pos54 (Making pos54 not clear, which is required by constraint 6).
9. Move player1 from pos54 to pos44.
10. Move player1 from pos44 to pos34.
11. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24 (Making pos24 not clear, which is required by constraint 12).
12. Move player1 from pos24 to pos25.
13. Move player1 from pos25 to pos35.
14. Move player1 from pos35 to pos45.
15. Move player1 from pos45 to pos55.
16. Move player1 from pos55 to pos54.
17. Move player1 from pos54 to pos52. (Skipping pos53 to satisfy constraint 1).
18. Move player1 from pos52 to pos51.
19. Move player1 from pos51 to pos41 (Making pos41 not clear, which is required by constraint 9, and constraint 10 is satisfied because player1 was at pos51 earlier).
20. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31.
21. Move player1 from pos31 to pos32.
22. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos32. (After this, player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos32).

But now I realize that I need to check precisely what the push action does:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.

Effects:
- Agent p is no longer at location l_p.
- Stone s is no longer at location l_from.
- Location l_to is no longer clear.
- Agent p is at location l_from.
- Stone s is at location l_to.
- Location l_p is clear.
- Stone s is at a goal state.

This means that for a push, the agent needs to be adjacent to the stone in the opposite direction of the push.

For example, if the agent is at pos32 and wants to push the stone from pos42 to pos52, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos42 in the opposite direction of the push, which would be pos32. After the push, the agent is at pos42 and the stone is at pos52.

Given this, let's revise our plan:

1. Move player1 from pos12 to pos13 (dirdown).
2. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14 (dirdown).
3. Move player1 from pos14 to pos15 (dirdown).
4. Move player1 from pos15 to pos25 (dirright).
5. Move player1 from pos25 to pos35 (dirright).
6. Move player1 from pos35 to pos45 (dirright).
7. Move player1 from pos45 to pos55 (dirright).
8. Move player1 from pos55 to pos54 (dirup).
9. Move player1 from pos54 to pos44 (dirleft).
10. Move player1 from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft).
11. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft).
12. Move player1 from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown).
13. Move player1 from pos25 to pos35 (dirright).
14. Move player1 from pos35 to pos45 (dirright).
15. Move player1 from pos45 to pos55 (dirright).
16. Move player1 from pos55 to pos54 (dirup).
17. Move player1 from pos54 to pos52 (dirleft). (Since we can't move to pos53 due to constraint 1).
18. Move player1 from pos52 to pos51 (dirup).
19. Move player1 from pos51 to pos41 (dirleft).
20. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 (dirleft).
21. Move player1 from pos31 to pos32 (dirdown).
22. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft). (After this, player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos32).

However, I've been thinking a bit more, and I believe I misunderstood some of the constraints. Let me re-check:

Constraint 1: "Location pos53 is clear" should hold in every state. This means that at no point in time should pos53 be not clear (i.e., it should not have an agent or stone).
Constraint 2: "Location pos15 is not clear" should hold in at least one state. This means at some point, pos15 should have an agent or stone. (This is achieved in step 3).
Constraint 3: "player1 is not at location pos43" should hold in every state. This means that at no point in time should player1 be at pos43.
Constraint 4: "Location pos14 is not clear" should hold in at least one state. This means at some point, pos14 should have an agent or stone. (This is achieved in step 2).
Constraint 5: "stone1 is not at location pos43" should hold in every state. This means that at no point in time should stone1 be at pos43.
Constraint 6: "Location pos54 is not clear" should hold in at least one state. This means at some point, pos54 should have an agent or stone. (This is achieved in step 8).
Constraint 7: "If 'Location pos54 is not clear' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'player1 is at location pos51'". This means that before pos54 becomes not clear, player1 should have been at pos51 earlier. (This is satisfied, as player1 is at pos51 in step 18 and at pos54 in step 8).
Constraint 8: "Location pos42 is not clear" should hold in at least one state. This is already true in the initial state, since stone1 is at pos42 initially.
Constraint 9: "Location pos41 is not clear" should hold in at least one state. This means at some point, pos41 should have an agent or stone. (This is achieved in step 19).
Constraint 10: "If 'Location pos41 is not clear' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'player1 is at location pos51'". This means that before pos41 becomes not clear, player1 should have been at pos51 earlier. (This is satisfied, as player1 is at pos51 in step 18 and at pos41 in step 19).
Constraint 11: "stone1 is at location pos42" should hold in at least one state. This is already true in the initial state, since stone1 is at pos42 initially.
Constraint 12: "If 'stone1 is at location pos42' holds in some state s, then expression 'Location pos24 is not clear' must hold at s or at some state after s". This means that from the moment stone1 is at pos42 (which is already true in the initial state) and onwards, pos24 should become not clear at some point. (This is achieved in step 11).
Constraint 13: "Location pos44 is clear" should hold in every state. This means that at no point in time should pos44 be not clear (i.e., it should not have an agent or stone).

Wait, constraint 7 and step 8 are not consistent. I said player1 is at pos54 in step 8 and at pos51 in step 18, which would mean pos54 is not clear before player1 is at pos51, which contradicts constraint 7. I need to fix this.

Actually, there's a more fundamental issue. I'm trying to satisfy constraint 7, which requires player1
to be at pos51 before pos54 becomes not clear. But in my plan, player1 is at pos54 in step 8 and at pos51 in step 18, which is after. This is the wrong order. Similarly, constraint 10 requires player1 to be at pos51 before pos41 becomes not clear, but in my plan, player1 is at pos41 in step 19, after being at pos51 in step 18. This is the correct order, so that part is fine.

Let me revise the overall plan, taking into account these issues:

1. Move player1 from pos12 to pos22.
2. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32.
3. Move player1 from pos32 to pos31.
4. Move player1 from pos31 to pos41.
5. Move player1 from pos41 to pos51. (Player is at pos51, satisfying the prerequisite for constraints 7 and 10).
6. Move player1 from pos51 to pos52.
7. Move player1 from pos52 to pos42. (Player is next to stone1, which is initially at pos42).
8. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32. (Player gets ready to push stone1).
9. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos32. (After this, player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos32).
10. Move player1 from pos42 to pos52.
11. Move player1 from pos52 to pos51.
12. Move player1 from pos51 to pos41. (Now pos41 is not clear, satisfying constraint 9. And since player1 was at pos51 earlier, constraint 10 is also satisfied).
13. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31.
14. Move player1 from pos31 to pos21.
15. Move player1 from pos21 to pos11.
16. Move player1 from pos11 to pos12.
17. Move player1 from pos12 to pos13.
18. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14. (Now pos14 is not clear, satisfying constraint 4).
19. Move player1 from pos14 to pos15. (Now pos15 is not clear, satisfying constraint 2).
20. Move player1 from pos15 to pos25.
21. Move player1 from pos25 to pos35.
22. Move player1 from pos35 to pos45.
23. Move player1 from pos45 to pos55.
24. Move player1 from pos55 to pos54. (Now pos54 is not clear, satisfying constraint 6. And since player1 was at pos51 earlier, constraint 7 is also satisfied).
25. Move player1 from pos54 to pos44.
26. Move player1 from pos44 to pos34.
27. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24. (Now pos24 is not clear, satisfying constraint 12).
28. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23.
29. Move player1 from pos23 to pos22.
30. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32.
31. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33.
32. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos34.

But there's a problem: constraint 13 says pos44 must always be clear, but in step 25, player1 is at pos44, making it not clear. This conflicts with constraint 13. I need to adjust my plan further.

And there's another problem: after step 31, player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos33. But in step 32, player1 suddenly appears at pos33 to push the stone to pos34. This doesn't make sense. Player1 should first move to pos23.

Let me revise the plan to address these issues:

1. Move player1 from pos12 to pos22.
2. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32.
3. Move player1 from pos32 to pos31.
4. Move player1 from pos31 to pos41.
5. Move player1 from pos41 to pos51. (Player is at pos51, satisfying the prerequisite for constraints 7 and 10).
6. Move player1 from pos51 to pos52.
7. Move player1 from pos52 to pos42. (Player is next to stone1, which is initially at pos42).
8. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32. (Player gets ready to push stone1).
9. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos32. (After this, player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos32).
10. Move player1 from pos42 to pos52.
11. Move player1 from pos52 to pos51.
12. Move player1 from pos51 to pos41. (Now pos41 is not clear, satisfying constraint 9. And since player1 was at pos51 earlier, constraint 10 is also satisfied).
13. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31.
14. Move player1 from pos31 to pos21.
15. Move player1 from pos21 to pos11.
16. Move player1 from pos11 to pos12.
17. Move player1 from pos12 to pos13.
18. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14. (Now pos14 is not clear, satisfying constraint 4).
19. Move player1 from pos14 to pos15. (Now pos15 is not clear, satisfying constraint 2).
20. Move player1 from pos15 to pos25.
21. Move player1 from pos25 to pos35.
22. Move player1 from pos35 to pos45.
23. Move player1 from pos45 to pos55.
24. Move player1 from pos55 to pos54. (Now pos54 is not clear, satisfying constraint 6. And since player1 was at pos51 earlier, constraint 7 is also satisfied).
25. Move player1 from pos54 to pos34. (Skipping pos44 to ensure constraint 13 is satisfied).
26. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24. (Now pos24 is not clear, satisfying constraint 12).
27. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23.
28. Move player1 from pos23 to pos33.
29. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33. (After this, player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos33).
30. Move player1 from pos32 to pos22.
31. Move player1 from pos22 to pos23.
32. Move player1 from pos23 to pos33.
33. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos34. (After this, player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos34, which is the goal).

But I realize there's a problem again in steps 28-29. We're trying to push the stone from pos32 to pos33 using the push action, but the player is at pos33, not adjacent to the stone in the way required for the push. So there's a contradiction here. I think I misunderstood the puzzle layout. Let me double-check the grid structure and the constraints.

Given that the grid is a 2D square grid, and the positions are named posXY where X and Y are the coordinates, I'll reconsider the layout:

55 54 53 52 51
45 44 43 42 41
35 34 33 32 31
25 24 23 22 21
15 14 13 12 11

Initially, player1 is at pos12, and stone1 is at pos42. The goal is to bring the stone to pos34.

I'll now revise the plan to ensure all constraints are satisfied:

1. Move player1 from pos12 to pos22.
2. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32.
3. Move player1 from pos32 to pos31.
4. Move player1 from pos31 to pos41.
5. Move player1 from pos41 to pos51. (Player is at pos51, satisfying the prerequisite for constraints 7 and 10).
6. Move player1 from pos51 to pos52.
7. Move player1 from pos52 to pos42. (Player is next to stone1, which is initially at pos42).
8. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos42 pos32 dirleft. (Now stone1 is at pos32 and player1 is at pos42, both satisfying constraint 8).
9. Move player1 from pos42 to pos41. (Now pos41 is not clear, satisfying constraint 9. And since player1 was at pos51 earlier, constraint 10 is also satisfied).
10. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31.
11. Move player1 from pos31 to pos21.
12. Move player1 from pos21 to pos11.
13. Move player1 from pos11 to pos12.
14. Move player1 from pos12 to pos13.
15. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14. (Now pos14 is not clear, satisfying constraint 4).
16. Move player1 from pos14 to pos15. (Now pos15 is not clear, satisfying constraint 2).
17. Move player1 from pos15 to pos25.
18. Move player1 from pos25 to pos35.
19. Move player1 from pos35 to pos45.
20. Move player1 from pos45 to pos55.
21. Move player1 from pos55 to pos54. (Now pos54 is not clear, satisfying constraint 6. And since player1 was at pos51 earlier, constraint 7 is also satisfied).
22. Move player1 from pos54 to pos34. (Skipping pos44 to ensure constraint 13 is satisfied).
23. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24. (Now pos24 is not clear, satisfying constraint 12).
24. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23.
25. Move player1 from pos23 to pos33.
26. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos33 dirright. (Now stone1 is at pos33 and player1 is at pos32).
27. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33.
28. Pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos34 dirright. (Now stone1 is at the goal position pos34 and player1 is at pos33).

Actually, wait a second. The push actions have 6 arguments, so the format should be:
pushtonongoal/pushtogoal player1 stone1 agent_location stone_location new_stone_location direction
So the agent is at agent_location, the stone is at stone_location, and it gets pushed to new_stone_location.

So let me revise action 8 (and others) in our plan. Also, I think I misunderstood the grid layout. Positions should be posRC, where R is the row (increasing downwards) and C is the column (increasing right).

Let's go with:

11 12 13 14 15
21 22 23 24 25
31 32 33 34 35
41 42 43 44 45
51 52 53 54 55

Now, player1 starts at pos12, and the stone is at pos42. The goal is to bring the stone to pos34.

Let me redo the plan:

1. Move player1 from pos12 to pos22.
2. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32.
3. Move player1 from pos32 to pos42. (Player is next to stone1, which is initially at pos42).
4. Move player1 from pos42 to pos41. (Player is at pos41, preparing to push stone1 from pos42 in the next step).
5. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos43 dirright. (Now stone1 is at pos43 and player1 is at pos42).

Wait, this wouldn't work. Constraint 5 says stone1 can never be at pos43, but I'm pushing it there. Let's revise.

Also, I just realized that constraints 7 and 10 are conditional. They state that if pos54 (or pos41) is not clear, then player1 must have been at pos51 in an earlier state. So I only need to ensure that if I ever make these positions not clear, player1 should have been at pos51 earlier.

Let me redo the plan:

1. Move player1 from pos12 to pos13.
2. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14. (Now pos14 is not clear, satisfying constraint 4).
3. Move player1 from pos14 to pos15. (Now pos15 is not clear, satisfying constraint 2).
4. Move player1 from pos15 to pos25.
5. Move player1 from pos25 to pos24. (Now pos24 is not clear, satisfying constraint 12).
6. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34.
7. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33.
8. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32.
9. Move player1 from pos32 to pos31.
10. Move player1 from pos31 to pos41.
11. Move player1 from pos41 to pos51. (Player is at pos51, satisfying the prerequisite for constraints 7 and 10).
12. Move player1 from pos51 to pos41. (Now pos41 is not clear, satisfying constraint 9. And since player1 was at pos51 earlier, constraint 10 is also satisfied).
13. Move player1 from pos41 to pos32.
14. Move player1 from pos32 to pos42. (Player is below stone1, preparing to push it up).
15. Pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos42 pos32 dirup. (Now stone1 is at pos32 and player1 is at pos42).
16. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32.
17. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos32 pos33 dirright. (Now stone1 is at pos33 and player1 is at pos32).
18. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33.
19. Pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos34 dirright. (Now stone1 is at pos34 and player1 is at pos33).

But I need to double check if constraint 7 is satisfied. I'm not making pos54 not clear in this plan, so I don't need to satisfy the condition of having player1 at pos51 earlier. The constraint is a conditional, so if the first part is never true, we don't need to check the second part.

Checking the rest of the constraints:
- Constraint 1: pos53 is always clear. This is satisfied because none of our actions involve pos53.
- Constraint 2: pos15 is not clear at least once. This is satisfied in step 3.
- Constraint 3: player1 is never at pos43. This is satisfied because none of our actions place player1 at pos43.
- Constraint 4: pos14 is not clear at least once. This is satisfied in step 2.
- Constraint 5: stone1 is never at pos43. This is satisfied because none of our actions place stone1 at pos43.
- Constraint 6: pos54 is not clear at least once. This is not satisfied in our plan. I need to revise.
- Constraint 7: If pos54 is not clear, then player1 was at pos51 earlier. Since pos54 is always clear in our plan, this conditional is satisfied.
- Constraint 8: pos42 is not clear at least once. This is already true in the initial state, since stone1 is at pos42 initially.
- Constraint 9: pos41 is not clear at least once. This is satisfied in step 12.
- Constraint 10: If pos41 is not clear, then player1 was at pos51 earlier. This is satisfied, as player1 is at pos51 in step 11 and at pos41 in step 12.
- Constraint 11: stone1 is at pos42 at least once. This is already true in the initial state, since stone1 is at pos42 initially.
- Constraint 12: If stone1 is at pos42 at some state s, then pos24 is not clear at s or at some state after s. This is satisfied, as stone1 is at pos42 in the initial state and pos24 is not clear in step 5.
- Constraint 13: pos44 is always clear. This is satisfied because none of our actions involve pos44.

Let me fix Constraint 6 by adding a step where player1 is at pos54:

1. Move player1 from pos12 to pos13.
2. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14. (Now pos14 is not clear, satisfying constraint 4).
3. Move player1 from pos14 to pos15. (Now pos15 is not clear, satisfying constraint 2).
4. Move player1 from pos15 to pos25.
5. Move player1 from pos25 to pos24. (Now pos24 is not clear, satisfying constraint 12).
6. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34.
7. Move player1 from pos34 to pos44.
8. Move player1 from pos44 to pos54.  (Now pos54 is not clear, satisfying constraint 6. But the conditional in constraint 7 is not satisfied yet).
9. Move player1 from pos54 to pos44.
10. Move player1 from pos44 to pos34.
11. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33.
12. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32.
13. Move player1 from pos32 to pos31.
14. Move player1 from pos31 to pos41.
15. Move player1 from pos41 to pos51. (Player is at pos51, but this is after pos54 is not clear, so constraint 7 is still not satisfied).
16. Move player1 from pos51 to pos41. (Now pos41 is not clear, but constraint 10 is not satisfied either because player1 was at pos51 after, not before, pos41 is not clear).

Hmm, it seems like I need to make the player go to pos51 before pos54 and pos41 become not clear. Let me re-plan:

1. Move player1 from pos12 to pos13.
2. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14. (Now pos14 is not clear, satisfying constraint 4).
3. Move player1 from pos14 to pos15. (Now pos15 is not clear, satisfying constraint 2).
4. Move player1 from pos15 to pos25.
5. Move player1 from pos25 to pos24. (Now pos24 is not clear, satisfying constraint 12).
6. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34.
7. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33.
8. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32.
9. Move player1 from pos32 to pos31.
10. Move player1 from pos31 to pos41.
11. Move player1 from pos41 to pos51. (Player is at pos51, satisfying the prerequisite for constraints 7 and 10).
12. Move player1 from pos51 to pos52.
13. Move player1 from pos52 to pos42. (Player is below stone1, preparing to push it up).
14. Pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos42 pos32 dirup. (Now stone1 is at pos32 and player1 is at pos42).
15. Move player1 from pos42 to pos41. (Now pos41 is not clear, satisfying constraint 9. And since player1 was at pos51 earlier, constraint 10 is also satisfied).
16. Move player1 from pos41 to pos51.
17. Move player1 from pos51 to pos52.
18. Move player1 from pos52 to pos53.
19. Move player1 from pos53 to pos54. (Now pos54 is not clear, satisfying constraint 6. And since player1 was at pos51 earlier, constraint 7 is also satisfied).
20. Move player1 from pos54 to pos44.
21. Move player1 from pos44 to pos34.
22. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33.
23. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32.
24. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos32 pos33 dirright. (Now stone1 is at pos33 and player1 is at pos32).
25. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33.
26. Pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos34 dirright. (Now stone1 is at the goal position pos34 and player1 is at pos33).

But I'm hitting the same problem as before. I cannot satisfy constraint 1 and constraint 6 simultaneously. I need to pass through pos53 to reach pos54 from pos52, but this would make pos53 not clear, violating constraint 1.

Oh wait, I just realized I've been interpreting the direction, and push/move actions incorrectly. Let's re-read:

- "You may move from location posXX to location posYY following direction dirZZ" indicates that I can move from posXX to posYY in the dirZZ direction.
- "move p l_from l_to d": Move agent p from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.
- "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.
- "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to non-goal location l_to, following direction d.

So, for the move action, I need to find a valid move (for example, "You may move from location pos12 to location pos22 following direction dirright"), and then I'd use:
move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright.

For the push actions, I need to find a configuration where the player is at a location adjacent to the stone, and there's a place to push the stone to. The direction is the direction of the push.

Let me revise the plan with this understanding:

1. Move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright.
2. Move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright.
3. Move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown.
4. Move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown.
5. Move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft.
6. Move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft.
7. Move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown.
8. Move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright.
9. Move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright.
10. Move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright.
11. Move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright.
12. Move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup.
13. Move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup. (But this would make pos53 not clear, violating constraint 1).

I'm still having trouble navigating the grid while respecting all the constraints. Let me step back and reconsider.

Looking at the grid, if I want to get the stone from pos42 to pos34, a direct path would be to push it left (to pos32) and then up (to pos33) and then right (to pos34).

However, this plan needs to also ensure that:
- pos15, pos14, pos24, pos54, pos41, and pos42 are not clear at some point.
- pos53, pos43, and pos44 are always clear.
- player1 should be at pos51 before pos54 and pos41 become not clear.

Let me try a plan that focuses on getting the stone to the goal while making sure these positions become (or remain) clear as needed:

1. Move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright.
2. Move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright.
3. Move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup.
4. Move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright.
5. Move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright. (Player1 is at pos51, satisfying the prerequisites for constraint 7 and 10).
6. Move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft.
7. Move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft.
8. Move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft.
9. Move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft.
10. Move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown.
11. Move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown.
12. Move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown. (Now pos14 is not clear, satisfying constraint 4).
13. Move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown. (Now pos15 is not clear, satisfying constraint 2).
14. Move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright.
15. Move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup. (Now pos24 is not clear, satisfying constraint 12).
16. Move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup.
17. Move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup.
18. Move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright.
19. Move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright.
20. Move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup. (Now pos41 is not clear, satisfying constraint 9. And since player1 was at pos51 earlier, constraint 10 is also satisfied).
21. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos32 dirleft. (Now stone1 is at pos32 and player1 is at pos42).
22. Move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup.
23. Move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright.
24. Move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown.
25. Move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft.
26. Move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft.
27. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos32 pos33 dirdown. (Now stone1 is at pos33 and player1 is at pos32).
28. Move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown.
29. Pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos34 dirright. (Now stone1 is at the goal position pos34 and player1 is at pos33).

But I see I still haven't addressed constraint 6, which requires pos54 to be not clear at some point. Let me revise:

1. Move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright.
2. Move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright.
3. Move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup.
4. Move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright.
5. Move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright. (Player1 is at pos51, satisfying the prerequisites for constraint 7 and 10).
6. Move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown.
7. Move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft.
8. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos42 pos32 dirleft. (Now stone1 is at pos32 and player1 is at pos42).
9. Move player1 pos42 pos52 dirright.
10. Move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup. (Player1 is at pos51, ensuring prerequisite for constraint 7 again).
11. Move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft. (Now pos41 is not clear, satisfying constraint 9. And since player1 was at pos51 earlier, constraint 10 is also satisfied).
12. Move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft.
13. Move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft.
14. Move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft.
15. Move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown.
16. Move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown.
17. Move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown. (Now pos14 is not clear, satisfying constraint 4).
18. Move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown. (Now pos15 is not clear, satisfying constraint 2).
19. Move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright.
20. Move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup. (Now pos24 is not clear, satisfying constraint 12).
21. Move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright.
22. Move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown.
23. Move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright.
24. Move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright.
25. Move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup. (Now pos54 is not clear, satisfying constraint 6. And since player1 was at pos51 earlier, constraint 7 is also satisfied).
26. Move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft.
27. Move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft.
28. Move player1 pos34 pos33 dirleft.
29. Move player1 pos33 pos32 dirleft.
30. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos32 pos33 dirright. (Now stone1 is at pos33 and player1 is at pos32).
31. Move player1 pos32 pos33 dirright.
32. Pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos34 dirright. (Now stone1 is at the goal position pos34 and player1 is at pos33).

I think this plan addresses all constraints. Let me double check:
- Constraint 1: pos53 is always clear. This is satisfied because none of our actions involve pos53.
- Constraint 2: pos15 is not clear at least once. This is satisfied in step 18.
- Constraint 3: player1 is never at pos43. This is satisfied because none of our actions place player1 at pos43.
- Constraint 4: pos14 is not clear at least once. This is satisfied in step 17.
- Constraint 5: stone1 is never at pos43. This is satisfied because none of our actions place stone1 at pos43.
- Constraint 6: pos54 is not clear at least once. This is satisfied in step 25.
- Constraint 7: If pos54 is not clear, then player1 was at pos51 earlier. This is satisfied, as player1 is at pos51 in steps 5 and 10, before pos54 is not clear in step 25.
- Constraint 8: pos42 is not clear at least once. This is satisfied in the initial state and in step 7.
- Constraint 9: pos41 is not clear at least once. This is satisfied in step 11.
- Constraint 10: If pos41 is not clear, then player1 was at pos51 earlier. This is satisfied, as player1 is at pos51 in steps 5 and 10, before pos41 is not clear in step 11.
- Constraint 11: stone1 is at pos42 at least once. This is satisfied in the initial state.
- Constraint 12: If stone1 is at pos42 at some state s, then pos24 is not clear at s or at some state after s. This is satisfied, as stone1 is at pos42 in the initial state and pos24 is not clear in step 20.
- Constraint 13: pos44 is clear in every state, except step 27. I need to fix this.

I got confused again. Let's reread constraint 13: "Location pos44 is clear" should hold in every state. This means pos44 should always be unoccupied. But in step 27 of my plan, player1 is at pos44.

Let me fix this by ensuring player1 doesn't go through pos44:

1. Move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright.
2. Move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright.
3. Move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup.
4. Move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright.
5. Move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright. (Player1 is at pos51, satisfying the prerequisites for constraint 7 and 10).
6. Move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown.
7. Move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft.
8. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos42 pos32 dirleft. (Now stone1 is at pos32 and player1 is at pos42).
9. Move player1 pos42 pos52 dirright.
10. Move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup. (Player1 is at pos51, ensuring prerequisite for constraint 7 again).
11. Move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft. (Now pos41 is not clear, satisfying constraint 9. And since player1 was at pos51 earlier, constraint 10 is also satisfied).
12. Move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft.
13. Move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft.
14. Move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft.
15. Move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown.
16. Move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown.
17. Move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown. (Now pos14 is not clear, satisfying constraint 4).
18. Move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown. (Now pos15 is not clear, satisfying constraint 2).
19. Move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright.
20. Move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup. (Now pos24 is not clear, satisfying constraint 12).
21. Move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright.
22. Move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown.
23. Move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright.
24. Move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright.
25. Move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup. (Now pos54 is not clear, satisfying constraint 6. And since player1 was at pos51 earlier, constraint 7 is also satisfied).
26. Move player1 pos54 pos34 dirleft. (Skipping pos44 to ensure constraint 13 is satisfied).
27. Move player1 pos34 pos33 dirleft.
28. Move player1 pos33 pos32 dirleft.
29. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos32 pos33 dirright. (Now stone1 is at pos33 and player1 is at pos32).
30. Move player1 pos32 pos33 dirright.
31. Pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos34 dirright. (Now stone1 is at the goal position pos34 and player1 is at pos33).

But there's still a question of whether you can move from pos54 to pos34 directly (skipping pos44). According to the available moves, you can only move between adjacent positions. So, I can't skip pos44. But I need to keep pos44 clear at all times.

Let's revise and rethink this whole plan.

Is there a way to get the stone from its initial position to the goal without having the player go through pos44? We need a roundabout route.

Actually, if we break down all the moves:
- We have to make pos15, pos14, pos24, pos54, pos41, and pos42 not clear at some point.
- We need to push the stone from pos42 to pos34 without going through pos43 or pos44.
- We need player1 to be at pos51 before pos54 and pos41 become not clear.

Given that pos44 needs to be clear and the player can only move to adjacent positions, how can we get from pos54 to pos34? There's no direct path that doesn't go through pos44. This seems like a contradiction.

Wait, I didn't read properly. Looking again at the moves:
- "You may move from location pos54 to location pos44 following direction dirleft"
- "You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright"

The directions don't make sense given my understanding of the grid. Let me revisit the grid layout. Maybe it's:

11 12 13 14 15
21 22 23 24 25
31 32 33 34 35
41 42 43 44 45
51 52 53 54 55

Actually, let me just use the explicit list of valid moves as given in the problem. I'll try to build a path from player1's initial position to a position where it can push the stone to the goal.

Hmm, but I'd like to resolve the confusion I have. Let's look at the directions:
dirdown, dirleft, dirright, dirup

Given a position like pos12, "dirdown" would seem to move to pos22, "dirleft" would move to pos11, "dirright" would move to pos13, and "dirup" would move to pos02 (which doesn't exist).

Let's check some of the valid moves:
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" (from pos11 to pos21 is a right and a down, following direction dirright doesn't make sense).

I'm a bit confused about the directions. Let me look at more examples:
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown" (from pos11 to pos12 is a right, not a down).

I've got it. If the grid is:

11 12 13 14 15
21 22 23 24 25
31 32 33 34 35
41 42 43 44 45
51 52 53 54 55

Then moving from pos11 to pos21 is a downward move, not a rightward move. So, I've been reading the grid wrong. The positions are posYX where Y is the row (increasing downwards) and X is the column (increasing rightwards).

Now, with that sorted, let's try building a valid plan:

The player starts at pos12, and the stone is at pos42. The goal is to bring the stone to pos34.

Also, given our new understanding, I'm still having trouble satisfying all the constraints. There's no way to move from pos54 to pos34 without going through pos44, and pos44 needs to remain clear.

Actually, let's reread constraint 13 again:
"The following expression must hold in every state: 'Location pos44 is clear'". This means that at no point in time should pos44 be not clear.

If the player is at pos44, does that make it not clear? Let's reread the problem description. It states: "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." And "A location is 'clear' if it doesn't have an agent or a stone." So, if the player is at pos44, it's not clear.

However I'm misunderstanding the problem, there seems to be a contradiction. We need to make pos54 not clear, but there's no way for the player to reach pos54 without going through pos44, and pos44 must always be clear.

Actually, I'm sorry for my confusion, but I'm realizing if player1 is at some position, the related statement would be "player1 is at location posXX" not "Location posXX is clear." I've been confusing myself.

The initial state says:
"player1 is at location pos12"
"stone1 is at location pos42"
"Location pos12 is clear"
"Location pos42 is clear"

This suggests that the agent doesn't make its location "not clear"...which doesn't make sense. Let me look at the constraints:

"The following expression must hold in every state: 'Location pos53 is clear'"
"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'Location pos15 is not clear'"
"The following expression must hold in every state: 'player1 is not at location pos43'"
"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'Location pos14 is not clear'"

It's somewhat ambiguous, but I would guess that if the player is at a location, that location is not clear. So, if the player or the stone is at a location, it's not clear.

So, the initial state has wrong info in my opinion.

If we have to ensure pos44 is always clear, and we need to reach pos54 to make it not clear, we have a problem. This seems like a contradiction unless there's a path to pos54 that doesn't go through pos44.

Actually I think we need to reboot my thinking.

Let's start fresh. 

Available actions:
"move p l_from l_to d": Move the agent p from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.
"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": When the agent p is at location l_p, it pushes the stone s from location l_from to location l_to, where l_to is a goal location. Following direction d.
"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": When the agent p is at location l_p, it pushes the stone s from location l_from to location l_to, where l_to is a non-goal location. Following direction d.

Let me understand the effects of these actions from the problem description:

After a "move" action:
- (i) agent p is no longer at location l_from.
- (ii) location l_to is no longer clear.
- (iii) agent p is at location l_to.
- (iv) location l_from is clear.

So if player1 is at pos12 and moves to pos22, this means:
- player1 is no longer at location pos12.
- location pos22 is no longer clear.
- player1 is at location pos22.
- location pos12 is clear.

After a "pushtogoal" or "pushtonongoal" action:
- (i) agent p is no longer at location l_p.
- (ii) stone s is no longer at location l_from.
- (iii) location l_to is no longer clear.
- (iv) agent p is at location l_from.
- (v) stone s is at location l_to.
- (vi) location l_p is clear.

So if player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos42, pushing to pos52:
- player1 is no longer at location pos32.
- stone1 is no longer at location pos42.
- location pos52 is no longer clear.
- player1 is at location pos42.
- stone1 is at location pos52.
- location pos32 is clear.

So my understanding of "clear" is correct. If a location has an agent or a stone, it's not clear.

Given this, I think there may be a contradiction in the initial state. Both player1 and stone1 are assigned to positions and those same positions are labeled as clear. I'll take this as an errata. For example, the initial state says "player1 is at location pos12". This means pos12 is not clear.

Let's now actually look at the layout. player1 is initially at pos12. From the actions available to player1, we have:
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos22 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos11 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos13 following direction dirdown"

This suggests that dirright means moving down, dirup means moving up, and dirdown means moving right. That's a bit unusual for the naming, but I'll go with it.

So the layout is:

11 <- 12 -> 13 -> 14 -> 15
v     v     v     v     v
21 <- 22 -> 23 -> 24 -> 25
v     v     v     v     v
31 <- 32 -> 33 -> 34 -> 35
v     v     v     v     v
41 <- 42 -> 43 -> 44 -> 45
v     v     v     v     v
51 <- 52 -> 53 -> 54 -> 55

Given this, I'm still unsure if there's a way to make pos54 not clear without ever making pos44 not clear. I'll have to rethink.

Actually, wait. From pos55, can I directly go to pos54 without going through pos44? Let's check:
"You may move from location pos55 to location pos54 following direction dirup"

Good, so I can move from pos55 to pos54 directly. This means we can make pos54 not clear without ever making pos44 not clear.

Let's now build a valid plan with the correct understanding:

1. Move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown. (Based on the available moves, I think this means the player moves right).
2. Move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown. (Now pos14 is not clear, satisfying constraint 4).
3. Move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown. (Now pos15 is not clear, satisfying constraint 2).
4. Move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright. (I think this means the player moves down).
5. Move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup. (I think this means the player moves left. Now pos24 is not clear, satisfying constraint 12).
6. Move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright. (I think this means the player moves down).
7. Move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup. (I think this means the player moves left).
8. Move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup. (I think this means the player moves left).
9. Move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup. (I think this means the player moves left).
10. Move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright. (I think this means the player moves down).
11. Move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright. (I think this means the player moves down. Now player1 is at pos51, satisfying the prerequisites for constraint 7 and 10).
12. Move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown. (I think this means the player moves right).
13. Move player1 pos52 pos42 dirup. (I think this means the player moves up).
14. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos42 pos32 dirup. (I think this means the player pushes the stone up. Now stone1 is at pos32 and player1 is at pos42).
15. Move player1 pos42 pos52 dirright. (I think this means the player moves down).
16. Move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup. (I think this means the player moves left. Player1 is at pos51, reinforcing the prerequisite for constraint 7 and 10).
17. Move player1 pos51 pos41 dirup. (I think this means the player moves up. Now pos41 is not clear, satisfying constraint 9. And since player1 was at pos51 earlier, constraint 10 is also satisfied).
18. Move player1 pos41 pos31 dirup. (I think this means the player moves up).
19. Move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown. (I think this means the player moves right).
20. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos32 pos33 dirdown. (I think this means the player pushes the stone right. Now stone1 is at pos33 and player1 is at pos32).
21. Move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown. (I think this means the player moves right).
22. Pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos34 dirdown. (I think this means the player pushes the stone right to the goal. Now stone1 is at the goal position pos34 and player1 is at pos33).
23. Move player1 pos33 pos23 dirup. (I think this means the player moves up).
24. Move player1 pos23 pos13 dirup. (I think this means the player moves up).
25. Move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup. (I think this means the player moves left).
26. Move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright. (I think this means the player moves down).
27. Move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright. (I think this means the player moves down).
28. Move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright. (I think this means the player moves down).
29. Move player1 pos42 pos52 dirright. (I think this means the player moves down).
30. Move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown. (I think this means the player moves right).
31. Move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown. (I think this means the player moves right. Now pos54 is not clear, satisfying constraint 6. And since player1 was at pos51 several times earlier, constraint 7 is also satisfied).

But this is a problem because I'm making pos53 not clear, which is against constraint 1: "Location pos53 is clear" should hold in every state.

I'm still confused about this issue—constraing 6 says I need to make pos54 not clear, and constraint 7 says I need to have player1 at pos51 before that, but how can I reach pos54 without going through either pos53 or pos44? We need to stay clear of those positions.

Let me think about this. I can't go from pos55 to pos54 without the player being at pos55. But how do I get the player to pos55 without passing through pos44 or pos53? Seems like a contradiction.

Ok, I just recall that the format from "You may move from location posXX to location posYY following direction dirZZ" does not necessarily imply a direct adjacency. For all I know, there could be secret tunnels or teleporters in the grid.

So let's check if there's a direct move from some position to pos54 without going through pos44 or pos53:

"You may move from location pos55 to location pos54 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos54 to location pos44 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos54 to location pos53 following direction dirup"

So you can go to pos54 from pos55 (and from pos54 to pos44 or pos53). This suggests we can get to pos54 directly from pos55 without going through pos44 or pos53.

So, let's adjust the plan to ensure pos53 remains clear while making pos54 not clear:

21. Move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown.
22. Move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown.
23. Move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright.
24. Move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright.
25. Move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup. (Now pos54 is not clear, satisfying constraint 6. And since player1 was at pos51 earlier, constraint 7 is also satisfied).

And I can go directly from pos54 to pos34 without passing through pos44:
26. Move player1 pos54 pos34 dirleft.
27. Move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup.
28. Pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos34 dirdown. (Stone is at the goal).

Wait, I need to actually check if "pos54 pos34 dirleft" is a valid action. The problem description says "You may move from location pos54 to location pos44 following direction dirleft" and "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft", but I'm not sure there is a link between pos54 and pos34.

Actually, I think I'm overthinking this. Let's approach this step-by-step. The problem requires:
1. Getting the stone from pos42 to pos34 (the goal).
2. Ensuring the player visits specific states and avoid others.

Let's try a simplr approach:

1. Move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown. (Based on the available moves, I think this means the player moves right).
2. Move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown. (Now pos14 is not clear, satisfying constraint 4).
3. Move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown. (Now pos15 is not clear, satisfying constraint 2).
4. Move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright. (I think this means the player moves down).
5. Move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup. (I think this means the player moves left. Now pos24 is not clear, satisfying constraint 12).
6. Move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright. (I think this means the player moves down).
7. Move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown. (I think this means the player moves right).
8. Move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright. (I think this means the player moves down).
9. Move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright. (I think this means the player moves down).
10. Move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup. (I think this means the player moves left. Now pos54 is not clear. But we haven't satisfied the prerequisite for constraint 7 yet).
11. Move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft. (I think this means the player moves up. This makes pos44 not clear, violating constraint 13. I need to adjust).

Actually, I don't think we can make pos54 not clear without going through pos44 or pos53. It seems to be a contradiction.

I'm going to try a different approach. Looking at the "You may move from..." statements, I want to interpret the direction labels literally: dirleft is left, dirright is right, dirup is up, dirdown is down.

So, from pos12:
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos22 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos11 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos13 following direction dirdown"

Now, if dirleft is left, pos22 is not left of pos12. But if dirright refers to the direction of pos22 relative to pos12, that would make pos22 the right position of pos12. That seems off.

Actually, I think the answer is in the actual problem statement. It says: "a 2D square grid. Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty. Each position is flagged as either a goal position or a non-goal position."

Let's think of the grid as RxC (Row x Column) indexing.
Positions:
    1 2 3 4 5
  -----------
1 |11 12 13 14 15
2 |21 22 23 24 25
3 |31 32 33 34 35
4 |41 42 43 44 45
5 |51 52 53 54 55
