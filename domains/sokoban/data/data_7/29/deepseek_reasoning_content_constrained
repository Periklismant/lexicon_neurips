Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to move stone1 to a goal location, which in this case is pos25. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy as well. Let me first understand the initial state and the constraints.

Initial State:
- Player1 is at pos21.
- Stone1 is at pos44.
- The only goal location is pos25.
- All other locations are non-goal except pos25.
- The grid's movement directions are given, which I need to consider for moving the agent and pushing the stone.

Constraints:
1. At least one state must have stone1 at pos42 or pos24 not clear.
2. pos23 must be not clear in some state.
3. If pos23 is not clear, then stone1 was at pos42 earlier.
4. pos54 must be not clear in some state.
5. If pos54 is not clear, then earlier either player1 was at pos51 or stone1 was at pos21.
6. pos24 must be not clear in some state.
7. stone1 must be at pos23 in some state.
8. Player1 must be at pos54 in some state.
9. If player1 is at pos54, then pos44 was not clear earlier.
10. pos43 not clear can only hold in at most one continuous sequence.

Hmm, okay. Let's break down the required steps. The main goal is to get stone1 to pos25. But along the way, we need to satisfy all these constraints. Let's outline the path.

First, the stone is at pos44. To get it to pos25, the path would be pos44 → pos34 (left) → pos24 (left) → pos25 (down). But wait, pos25 is the goal. So pushing it from pos24 to pos25 with 'dirdown' direction. Let me check the movement possibilities.

But the constraints complicate things. For example, we need to have stone1 at pos23, which is not on the direct path. Also, pos24 and pos54 need to be blocked at some points, and player1 has to be at pos54. So maybe we need to take a detour.

Let me think. Let's see the constraints:

- Stone1 must be at pos23 in some state. So, we need to move it there temporarily. But how? From pos44, moving left to pos34, then up to pos33? Wait, pos34 is connected to pos33 (dirup?), no, pos34 to pos33 is up? Let me check the movement directions.

Looking at the allowed movements:

From pos44, you can move to pos34 (dirleft), pos54 (dirright), pos43 (dirup), or pos45 (dirdown). So to move the stone from pos44, the agent has to be in a position to push it. To push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent in the direction of the push.

So, for example, to push the stone from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft), the agent must be at pos44's right (dirleft direction), which would be pos45. Wait, no. Wait, the direction is the direction from the agent's position to the stone's position. For the "pushtogoal" action, the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (stone's position) in direction d. Then, pushing the stone from l_from to l_to in direction d. So, the agent moves from l_p to l_from (direction d), pushing the stone to l_to (same direction d). So l_to is the next cell in direction d from l_from.

Wait, for example, if the agent is at pos34 (l_p), and the stone is at pos44 (l_from), then the direction from pos34 to pos44 is dirright. So pushing the stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirright) would require the agent to be at pos44's left (pos34), pushing right. But pos44's right is pos54. So if the agent is at pos34, direction dirright to get to pos44, then pushing the stone to pos54 (dirright again). But pos54 is a non-goal location, so we would use pushtonongoal. But the goal is pos25. So maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, pushing the stone from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft). To do that, the agent would need to be at pos44's right (pos45) and push left. Wait, direction from agent's position to stone's position is dirleft. So agent at pos45, direction dirleft would be towards pos44. Then pushing the stone to pos34 (dirleft from pos44). Wait, no. Let me get this straight.

The action "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d" requires that the agent is at l_p, the stone is at l_from, and l_p is adjacent to l_from in direction d. Then, the stone is pushed from l_from to l_to in the same direction d. So l_to must be the next cell in direction d from l_from.

For example, if the agent is at pos34 (l_p) and the stone is at pos44 (l_from), direction d would be dirdown (since pos34 to pos44 is down). Then pushing the stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirdown from pos44). But pos54 is not a goal, so that's a pushtonongoal action. But we need to eventually get the stone to pos25.

Alternatively, pushing the stone from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft). For that, the agent would need to be at pos44's right (pos45) and direction dirleft. Wait, no. The agent's location l_p must be adjacent to l_from (stone's position) in direction d. So if the agent is at pos44's right (pos45), the direction from pos45 to pos44 is dirleft. Then, pushing the stone from pos44 to pos43 (dirleft from pos44? Wait, pos44's left is pos34, not pos43. Wait, the directions are a bit confusing here. Let me check the movement from pos44.

Looking at the movement possibilities:

From pos44, you can move to pos34 (dirleft), pos54 (dirright), pos43 (dirup), pos45 (dirdown). So pos44's up is pos43, down is pos45, left is pos34, right is pos54.

So, if the agent is at pos43 (above pos44), the direction from pos43 to pos44 is dirdown. So, to push the stone from pos44 to pos45 (dirdown), the agent would need to be at pos44's up (pos43), direction dirdown. Then pushing the stone down to pos45. But that's a non-goal location. Alternatively, pushing the stone left to pos34 (dirleft) would require the agent to be at pos44's right (pos45), direction dirleft. Wait, no: agent's position l_p must be such that you can get from l_p to l_from (pos44) via direction d. So if the agent is at pos45, direction dirleft would be towards pos44. So pushing the stone from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft) requires agent at pos45, direction dirleft. But then pushing the stone from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft), which is a valid movement. But pos34 is a non-goal location. So that's a pushtonongoal action.

But our main goal is to get the stone to pos25. So perhaps the path is pos44 → pos34 → pos24 → pos25. Let's see.

First, move the agent from pos21 to pos44's vicinity to be able to push the stone. The initial position of the agent is pos21. Let's plan the agent's path to reach pos44.

From pos21, possible moves are to pos11 (dirleft), pos31 (dirright), or pos22 (dirdown). Let's see the path from pos21 to pos44. Let's think of moving right to pos31, then right to pos41, then down to pos42, then right to pos52? Wait, maybe a better path. Alternatively, pos21 → pos22 (dirdown), then pos23, pos24, pos34, etc. Let's map out a possible path.

Wait, but the agent needs to reach a position adjacent to the stone (pos44) to push it. So the agent needs to get to pos43 (up from pos44), pos45 (down), pos34 (left), or pos54 (right). Let's see which of these is reachable.

From pos21, moving down to pos22, then down to pos23, then down to pos24. From pos24, right to pos34. Then, from pos34, right to pos44. Wait, no. pos34's right is pos44. So moving from pos34 to pos44 is allowed via dirright. But the agent can't move into a location that's not clear. Initially, pos44 has the stone, so it's not clear. So the agent can't move into pos44 unless it's pushing the stone.

So the agent can't directly move into pos44. Instead, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos44 to push the stone. So to push the stone from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft), the agent needs to be at pos45 (down from pos44), then direction dirleft to pos44, pushing it to pos34. But how does the agent get to pos45?

pos45 is initially clear. The path from pos21 to pos45: pos21 → pos22 (dirdown) → pos23 (dirdown) → pos24 (dirdown) → pos25 (dirright to pos35?), wait, no. Let's see the movement directions.

Wait, from pos24, you can go to pos34 (dirright), pos23 (dirup), etc. Let's see:

Agent path to pos45:

pos21 → pos22 (dirdown)
pos22 → pos23 (dirdown)
pos23 → pos24 (dirdown)
pos24 → pos34 (dirright)
pos34 → pos44 (dirright) → but pos44 is occupied by the stone. So can't move there. Instead, from pos34, perhaps move down to pos44's position, but that's blocked. Alternatively, from pos34, move down to pos44's location? No, because pos44 has the stone. So instead, the agent might need to go around.

Alternatively, from pos21, move right to pos31, then right to pos41, then down to pos42, then down to pos43, then down to pos44's position (but that's blocked). Hmm. Alternatively, from pos41, right to pos51, then down to pos52, etc. Not sure. This seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can reach pos45 by going down from pos21 to pos22, then pos23, pos24, pos25 (but pos25 is a goal), then right to pos35, down to pos45? Wait, pos25 can be moved to pos35 via dirright. Let's check:

pos21 → pos22 (dirdown)
pos22 → pos23 (dirdown)
pos23 → pos24 (dirdown)
pos24 → pos25 (dirdown) → but pos25 is a goal. Then from pos25, dirright to pos35. Then from pos35, dirright to pos45. But pos35 to pos45 is allowed via dirright? Wait, looking at the movement directions:

From pos35: "You may move from location pos35 to location pos25 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos35 to location pos45 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos35 to location pos34 following direction dirup".

So yes, from pos35, dirright to pos45. So the path could be:

pos21 → pos22 (dirdown)
pos22 → pos23 (dirdown)
pos23 → pos24 (dirdown)
pos24 → pos25 (dirdown)
pos25 → pos35 (dirright)
pos35 → pos45 (dirright)

Now the agent is at pos45. From there, can push the stone at pos44 to pos34 (dirleft). So action pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos34 dirleft. Because pos34 is not a goal. But we need to move the stone towards pos25 eventually. So after pushing to pos34, then push it to pos24, then to pos25.

But before that, let's check the constraints.

Constraints to satisfy:

1. At least one state where stone1 is at pos42 or pos24 is not clear. Hmm. pos24 is not clear when the stone is there. But the stone's path is pos44 → pos34 → pos24 → pos25. So when the stone is at pos24, pos24 is not clear, which satisfies one of the conditions for constraint 1. Also, constraint 6 requires pos24 to be not clear, which would be when the stone is there. But maybe we need to have the stone at pos42 as well. But that's not part of the direct path. So maybe we need to detour.

Constraint 7 requires stone1 to be at pos23 in some state. So the stone has to go to pos23, which is off the main path. How can that happen? Let's see. From pos34, to push the stone to pos24 (dirleft), the agent needs to be at pos34's right (pos44), but the stone is at pos34. Wait, no. Let me think again.

If the stone is at pos34, to push it to pos24 (dirleft), the agent needs to be at pos34's right (pos44), direction dirleft. So from pos44, push left to pos34. Wait, no. Wait, the agent is at pos44 (l_p), the stone is at pos34 (l_from). Then direction d would be dirleft (from pos44 to pos34 is dirleft). Pushing the stone from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft). But pos34's left is pos24? Wait, pos34's left is pos24? Let me check the movement from pos34:

From pos34, you can move to pos24 (dirleft), pos44 (dirright), pos33 (dirup), pos35 (dirdown). So yes, pos34's left is pos24. So pushing the stone from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft) requires the agent to be at pos44 (dirright from pos34 to pos44), direction dirleft. So agent at pos44 (if possible) pushing the stone from pos34 to pos24. But pos44 is initially occupied by the stone. So after pushing the stone to pos34, the agent is at pos34. Wait, after pushing, the agent moves to l_from (pos34) and the stone moves to l_to (pos24). Wait, no. Let me check the effect of pushtonongoal:

After pushtonongoal, the agent is at l_from (pos34), the stone is at l_to (pos24). So after pushing from pos34 to pos24, the agent ends up at pos34. Then, to push the stone from pos24 to pos25, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos24 in the direction of the push. pos24's down is pos25. So to push down to pos25, the agent needs to be at pos24's up (pos23) and direction dirdown. So agent at pos23, direction dirdown to pos24, pushing the stone down to pos25. But how does the agent get to pos23?

But this is getting complicated. Also, we need to satisfy the constraints, especially the one where stone1 must be at pos23. So perhaps we need to route the stone through pos23.

Alternative plan: move the stone from pos44 to pos43 (dirup), then to pos33 (dirleft), then to pos23 (dirleft), then to pos24 (dirdown), then to pos25. But how?

Let's see:

1. Push stone1 from pos44 to pos43 (dirup). To do this, the agent needs to be at pos44's down (pos45), direction dirup. Wait, pos44's down is pos45. So agent at pos45, direction dirup to pos44, pushing the stone up to pos43. But pos43 is a non-goal, so pushtonongoal. Then, the agent is at pos44 after the push? Wait, no. The effect of pushtonongoal is that the agent moves from l_p (pos45) to l_from (pos44), and the stone moves to l_to (pos43). Wait, the action is pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirup. Because dirup from pos45 to pos44 is not possible. Wait, no. The direction d must be the direction from l_p to l_from. So if the agent is at pos45 (l_p), l_from is pos44. The direction from pos45 to pos44 is dirup. So pushing the stone from pos44 to pos43 (dirup). So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirup. Then, after this action, the agent is at pos44, stone is at pos43.

But pos44 is now clear because the stone moved to pos43, and the agent is at pos44. Then, the agent can move to pos43 (dirup from pos44). But pos43 now has the stone. Wait, no. After pushing, the stone is at pos43, which is not clear. So the agent can't move there unless pushing again.

Alternatively, after pushing to pos43, the agent is at pos44. Then, the agent can move from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft), then to pos33 (dirup), etc. Hmm.

But this seems like a possible path to get the stone to pos23. Let's see:

After pushing to pos43, then push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft). Agent would need to be at pos43's right (pos44), direction dirleft. So pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos33 dirleft. Then the stone is at pos33. Then push to pos23 (dirleft), requiring agent at pos33's right (pos43), direction dirleft. So pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft. Then stone is at pos23, satisfying constraint 7. Then push from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown), agent at pos23's up (pos22?), direction dirdown. Then to pos24, then to pos25.

But this path would satisfy several constraints:

- Stone at pos23 (constraint 7)
- pos24 not clear when stone is there (constraint 6)
- Also, when the stone is at pos42 (if we route it there), but that's not part of this path. Wait, how to get the stone to pos42?

Alternatively, perhaps after moving the stone to pos43, push it to pos42 (dirleft). Let's see:

Stone at pos43. To push to pos42 (dirleft), agent needs to be at pos43's right (pos44?), direction dirleft. Wait, pos43's right is pos44? No, pos43's right would be pos53. Wait, the grid is 5x5, with pos11 to pos55. Let me visualize the grid:

Rows are 1 to 5 (top to bottom?), columns 1 to 5 (left to right). So pos11 is row 1, column 1; pos15 is row1, column5. pos51 is row5, column1.

So pos43 is row4, column3. Its right neighbor (dirright) would be pos44 (row4, column4). Left neighbor (dirleft) is pos42 (row4, column2). Up is pos33 (row3, column3). Down is pos53 (row5, column3)? Wait, no. Wait, movement directions: for pos43, the allowed movements are:

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown"

Wait, that seems odd. Or perhaps the directions are mapped differently. Let me check the given movements:

From pos43:
- "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft": so dirleft from pos43 leads to pos33 (row3, column3).
- "You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright": dirright from pos43 to pos53 (row5, column3? Wait, no, pos53 is row5, column3. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe the rows are numbered from top to bottom as 1 to 5, and columns left to right as 1 to5. So pos43 is row4, column3. Moving dirright would be to column4, but pos43's right is pos44 (row4, column4). But the movement says pos43 to pos53 is dirright. That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe there's a typo. Let me check the original problem's movement directions.

Looking back:

The movement for pos43 includes:
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown"

Wait, this seems inconsistent. pos43's dirright leading to pos53 (row5, column3) doesn't align with grid structure. Maybe there's a mistake in the movement directions. Alternatively, perhaps the directions are labeled differently. For example, dirright might correspond to moving east, which increases the column number. So pos43 (row4, column3) moving dirright would go to pos44 (column4). But according to the given movement, pos43's dirright is to pos53. That must be a typo. But given that the problem states these movements, I have to work with them as given.

So according to the problem, from pos43, dirright leads to pos53. That's row5, column3. So perhaps the grid is structured differently, but regardless, we have to follow the given movement connections.

So, from pos43, dirright is to pos53. So pushing the stone from pos43 to pos53 would require the agent to be at pos43's left (dirright direction would be from agent's position to stone's position). Wait, no. For the action, the agent is at l_p, adjacent to l_from (stone's position) in direction d.

So if the stone is at pos43, to push it dirright to pos53, the agent must be at pos43's opposite direction of dirright. Wait, direction d is the direction from l_p to l_from. So if the stone is at pos43 and the agent is at pos33 (since dirleft from pos43 to pos33), but that's dirleft. Alternatively, to push the stone dirright (to pos53), the agent must be at pos43's dirleft (pos33) and direction dirright. Wait, no. The direction d is the direction from the agent's position (l_p) to the stone's position (l_from). So if the agent is at pos33, direction dirright would go to pos34, not pos43. This is getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the movement directions are such that from pos43, dirright goes to pos53, which is south-east? Not sure. Given the complexity, perhaps it's better to follow the given movement directions as stated, regardless of grid layout.

Given that, let's think again. Suppose the stone is at pos43. To push it to pos42 (dirup), as per the movement from pos43 to pos42 via dirup. So the agent would need to be at pos43's down (pos44) and direction dirup. So agent at pos44, pushing the stone from pos43 to pos42 (dirup). But how does the agent get to pos44? If the stone was at pos43, the agent could be at pos44 (if it's clear). Wait, after pushing the stone to pos43, the agent is at pos44 (from the previous push action). Then, the agent can move to pos44, which is now clear (since the stone is at pos43). Wait, no. After pushing the stone from pos44 to pos43, the agent is at pos44 (l_from) because the action's effect is that the agent moves to l_from (pos44). So after that, the agent is at pos44, and pos44 is clear (since the stone was moved). Then, the agent can move from pos44 to other locations.

Wait, let's clarify the effects of pushtonongoal:

After "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d", the effects are:

(i) agent p is no longer at l_p.

(ii) stone s is no longer at l_from.

(iii) l_to is no longer clear.

(iv) agent p is at l_from.

(v) stone s is at l_to.

(vi) l_p is clear.

So after pushing, the agent moves from l_p to l_from, and the stone moves from l_from to l_to.

So, for example, if the agent is at pos45 (l_p), pushes the stone from pos44 (l_from) to pos34 (l_to) with direction dirleft, then after the action:

- Agent is no longer at pos45.

- Stone is no longer at pos44.

- pos34 is now occupied by the stone.

- Agent is now at pos44.

- pos45 becomes clear.

So in this case, after pushing, the agent is at pos44, which was previously occupied by the stone but is now clear (since the stone moved to pos34).

So, back to the earlier example:

1. Agent starts at pos21.

2. Move to pos22 (dirdown).

3. Move to pos23 (dirdown).

4. Move to pos24 (dirdown).

5. Move to pos34 (dirright).

6. Move to pos44 (dirright) → Wait, no, because pos44 has the stone initially. So can't move there. Instead, need to find a path around.

Alternatively, agent moves from pos21 to pos31 (dirright), then to pos41 (dirright), then to pos51 (dirright), then down to pos52 (dirdown), then down to pos53 (dirdown), then down to pos54 (dirdown). From pos54, move left to pos44 (dirleft). But pos44 has the stone. So the agent can't move there unless pushing.

So to push the stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirright), the agent must be at pos44's left (pos34), direction dirright. So agent at pos34, pushing the stone to pos54. But pos54 is a non-goal, so pushtonongoal. Then the stone is at pos54, which is a non-goal location. But we need to eventually get it to pos25. This seems counterproductive, but maybe necessary to satisfy constraints.

Wait, one of the constraints is that pos54 must be not clear in some state. Pushing the stone to pos54 would satisfy that. Also, the constraint says that if pos54 is not clear, then earlier either player1 was at pos51 or stone1 was at pos21. So pushing to pos54 would require that earlier the agent was at pos51 or stone was at pos21. The stone starts at pos44, so unless we move it to pos21, which is far away, perhaps the agent needs to go to pos51.

So, to satisfy the constraint for pos54 not clear, we need to have either player1 at pos51 earlier or stone1 at pos21. Since moving the stone to pos21 seems out of the way, maybe the agent needs to go to pos51 first.

So, let's plan:

Agent's path to pos51:

pos21 → pos31 (dirright)

pos31 → pos41 (dirright)

pos41 → pos51 (dirright)

Now, agent is at pos51. This satisfies one part of the condition for when pos54 is not clear. Then, the agent can move down to pos52, then to pos53, then to pos54. From pos54, push the stone to pos44 (dirleft?), but the stone is at pos44 initially. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me retrace.

Wait, the stone starts at pos44. So if the agent is at pos54, they can push the stone to pos54's left (pos44) if the stone is at pos44. But that's the initial position. So the agent at pos54, direction dirleft to pos44. But the stone is at pos44. So the agent can push the stone from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft), but that requires the agent to be at pos44's right (pos54), direction dirleft. So action pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirleft. Then the stone moves to pos34, agent moves to pos44.

This would satisfy the constraint for pos54 not clear (since the stone is at pos34, but the agent is at pos44 after pushing. Wait, no. The stone is pushed to pos34, so pos54 is clear again. Hmm. Alternatively, if we push the stone to pos54, but that's a non-goal. Let's try:

Agent moves to pos51 (satisfies the possibility for pos54's constraint), then moves to pos52, pos53, pos54. Then, from pos54, the agent can push the stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirright from pos44's perspective? Or dirright from the agent's perspective).

Wait, the stone is at pos44. The agent is at pos54. To push the stone, the agent must be adjacent to the stone in some direction. pos54 is to the right of pos44. So the direction from the agent's position (pos54) to the stone's position (pos44) is dirleft. So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirleft. Wait, no. The direction d is the direction from the agent's location to the stone's location. So agent at pos54, stone at pos44: direction is dirleft (from pos54 to pos44 is left). Then, pushing the stone in the same direction (dirleft) from pos44 to pos34. So after this action, the stone is at pos34, agent is at pos44. This would make pos54 clear (since the agent was at pos54 and moved to pos44). But the constraint requires pos54 to be not clear in some state. So maybe when the agent is at pos54, before pushing, pos54 is not clear (because the agent is there). So moving to pos54 would make pos54 not clear. Then, that state satisfies the constraint. Because the agent is at pos54, making it not clear. Then, the constraint is satisfied. And since the agent was at pos51 earlier, the condition for pos54 not clear is met (player1 was at pos51 earlier). So this could work.

So steps:

1. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (dirright).

2. Move to pos41 (dirright).

3. Move to pos51 (dirright). Now, player1 is at pos51. This is important for constraint 5.

4. Move down to pos52 (dirdown).

5. Move down to pos53 (dirdown).

6. Move down to pos54 (dirdown). Now, player1 is at pos54, making pos54 not clear. This satisfies constraint 4 (pos54 not clear in some state) and because the agent was at pos51 earlier, the conditional for constraint 5 is satisfied.

7. Then, push the stone from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft) using pushtonongoal. So agent is at pos54 (l_p), stone is at pos44 (l_from), direction dirleft. So action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirleft. After this, the agent is at pos44, stone is at pos34. pos54 becomes clear.

Now, the stone is at pos34. The agent is at pos44. From here, the agent can move to pos34 (dirleft), then push the stone to pos24 (dirleft), then to pos25 (dirdown).

But also, we need to get the stone to pos23 at some point (constraint 7). So perhaps after pushing to pos34, the agent can push the stone up to pos33 (dirup), then left to pos23.

Let's try:

8. Move agent from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft).

9. Push stone from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft): agent is at pos34 (l_p), stone at pos34 (l_from)? No, stone is at pos34. Wait, stone is at pos34 after step 7. So to push it further left to pos24, agent needs to be at pos34's right (pos44) and direction dirleft. But the agent is at pos34 after step 7. Wait, after step 7, the agent is at pos44. Wait, no: after step 7, the agent was at pos54, then after pushing, the agent moves to pos44. So after step 7, agent is at pos44.

So to push the stone from pos34 to pos24, the agent needs to be at pos34's right (pos44), direction dirleft. So agent is at pos44, stone at pos34. Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos24 dirleft. This is valid because pos24 is a non-goal. After this, the agent moves to pos34, stone moves to pos24. Now, pos24 is not clear, satisfying constraint 1 and 6.

Now, the stone is at pos24. Then, push it down to pos25 (dirdown). Agent needs to be at pos24's up (pos23) and direction dirdown. So agent needs to get to pos23.

Agent's current position is pos34. Path to pos23:

pos34 → pos33 (dirup)

pos33 → pos23 (dirleft)

Then, from pos23, push the stone down to pos25.

But wait, stone is at pos24. To push it down to pos25, agent must be at pos24's up (pos23), direction dirdown. So:

Agent at pos23, pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown. Since pos25 is a goal. This action would move the stone to pos25, achieving the goal.

But we also need to have the stone at pos23 in some state. Currently, the stone is at pos24, then to pos25. So how to get it to pos23?

Alternative plan: After step 7, stone is at pos34. Instead of pushing to pos24, push it up to pos33, then left to pos23.

So after step 7:

8. Agent at pos44. Move to pos34 (dirleft).

9. Push stone from pos34 to pos33 (dirup). Agent must be at pos34's down (pos44), direction dirup. So action pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos33 dirup. After this, agent is at pos34, stone at pos33.

10. Now, agent is at pos34. Move to pos33 (dirup).

11. Push stone from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft). Agent must be at pos33's right (pos43), direction dirleft. But pos43 is clear? Initially, yes. So agent moves from pos33 to pos43 (dirright?), but need to check allowed movements.

Wait, from pos33, allowed movements:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown"

So agent at pos33 can move to pos43 via dirright.

So steps:

10. Agent at pos34, move to pos33 (dirup).

11. Move to pos43 (dirright).

12. Push stone from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft). Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft. Now, stone is at pos23 (satisfies constraint 7), agent is at pos33.

Now, the stone is at pos23. Then, push it down to pos24 (dirdown). Agent must be at pos23's up (pos22), direction dirdown.

13. Agent moves from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft).

14. Push stone from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown). Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos23 pos24 dirdown. Wait, no. The stone is at pos23. To push it down to pos24, the agent must be at pos23's up (pos22), direction dirdown. So agent needs to move to pos22.

So:

13. Agent moves from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft).

But pos33 to pos23 is dirleft. So agent at pos23.

14. Push stone from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown). Agent must be at pos23's up (pos22), direction dirdown. So agent needs to move to pos22.

15. Agent moves from pos23 to pos22 (dirup).

16. Push stone from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown). Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown. Now, stone is at pos24, agent at pos23.

17. Then, push from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown). Agent must be at pos24's up (pos23), direction dirdown. So action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown. This moves the stone to pos25, which is the goal.

Now, let's check the constraints:

1. Stone at pos42 or pos24 not clear. pos24 is not clear when stone is there (steps 16, 17).

2. pos23 not clear: when stone is at pos23 (step 12), pos23 is not clear.

3. Before pos23 is not clear (step 12), stone was at pos33 (step 9), but the constraint requires that when pos23 is not clear, there was an earlier state where stone is at pos42. Wait, this is a problem. Because in this plan, the stone is at pos23, but there's no state where stone is at pos42. So this violates constraint 3. Because constraint 3 says that if pos23 is not clear (which it is when stone is there), then there must be an earlier state where stone is at pos42. But in this plan, the stone was never at pos42, so this constraint is violated.

Thus, this plan is invalid. So we need to adjust the plan to have the stone at pos42 at some point.

How can we route the stone to pos42?

Let's think. The stone is initially at pos44. To get to pos42, it needs to move left to pos43, then up to pos42.

Wait, from pos44, the stone can be pushed to pos43 (dirup), then from pos43 to pos42 (dirup). 

So let's try:

After agent is at pos44 (after step 7), push the stone to pos43 (dirup).

Then, push from pos43 to pos42 (dirup).

Then, from pos42, push to pos32 (dirup), etc. But this is a detour.

But this would require the agent to be at pos44 to push to pos43 (dirup), then agent moves to pos43, then push to pos42.

Let's outline this:

After step 7 (stone at pos34):

Wait, no, in the previous steps, after step 7, the stone was at pos34. Let's adjust the plan.

Alternative approach:

1. Agent moves to pos51 to satisfy constraint 5.

2. Then moves to pos54, making pos54 not clear.

3. Push stone from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft), agent at pos44.

4. Then push stone from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft), agent at pos34.

5. Push stone from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown), agent at pos24.

But this doesn't address the stone being at pos23 or pos42.

So to satisfy constraint 3, we need to have the stone at pos42 before pos23 is not clear.

So perhaps:

- Push the stone from pos44 to pos43 (dirup).

- Then to pos42 (dirup).

- Then to pos32 (dirup).

- Then to pos22 (dirup).

- Then to pos23 (dirright? Not sure). Wait, this is getting too convoluted.

Alternatively, after getting the stone to pos42, then move it to pos23.

Let's try:

Agent starts at pos21.

1. Move to pos22 (dirdown).

2. Move to pos23 (dirdown).

3. Move to pos24 (dirdown).

4. Move to pos34 (dirright).

5. Move to pos44 (dirright) → Can't, because pos44 has the stone. So instead, move around.

Alternative path to reach pos45:

1. pos21 → pos22 (dirdown).

2. pos22 → pos23 (dirdown).

3. pos23 → pos24 (dirdown).

4. pos24 → pos25 (dirdown).

5. pos25 → pos35 (dirright).

6. pos35 → pos45 (dirright).

Now, agent is at pos45. Can push the stone from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft).

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos34 dirleft. Agent now at pos44, stone at pos34.

8. Move agent to pos34 (dirleft from pos44).

9. Push stone from pos34 to pos33 (dirup). Agent at pos34, direction dirup to pos33. But to push, the agent needs to be at pos34's down (pos44) and push up. Wait, the agent is at pos34. To push the stone to pos33 (dirup), the agent must be at pos34's down (pos44) and direction dirup. So agent at pos44, stone at pos34. Push to pos33 (dirup). So action pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos33 dirup. After this, agent is at pos34, stone at pos33.

10. Now, agent is at pos34. Move to pos33 (dirup).

11. Push stone from pos33 to pos32 (dirup). Agent at pos33's down (pos43?), no. Wait, to push stone from pos33 to pos32 (dirup), the agent needs to be at pos33's down (pos43), direction dirup. So agent at pos43, pushing stone from pos33 to pos32 (dirup).

But agent is at pos34 after step 9. So to get to pos43:

12. pos34 → pos33 (dirup).

13. pos33 → pos43 (dirright).

14. Now, agent is at pos43. Push stone from pos33 to pos32 (dirup). Action pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos32 dirup. Now, stone at pos32.

This seems too far from the goal. Not helpful.

Alternative approach: After getting stone to pos34, push to pos24, then to pos25. But need to handle constraints.

Alternatively, after step 7 (stone at pos34), agent is at pos44. Move to pos43 (dirup).

15. Agent moves from pos44 to pos43 (dirup).

16. Push stone from pos34 to pos33 (dirup). Requires agent to be at pos34's down (pos44), but agent is at pos43. So this is not possible.

This is getting too complicated. Let's think of a different strategy that satisfies all constraints.

Required constraints:

- stone must be at pos23 (constraint 7).

- pos23 not clear must occur after stone is at pos42 (constraint 3).

- pos54 not clear must occur, and when it does, agent was at pos51 earlier.

- pos24 must be not clear.

- pos43 not clear can only be in one continuous sequence.

Let's try to build a plan that includes moving the stone to pos42 and pos23.

1. Agent moves to pos51 to satisfy constraint 5 later.

2. Then move to pos54, making pos54 not clear.

3. Push stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirright), making pos54 not clear. But pos54 is a non-goal, so use pushtonongoal. However, this requires the agent to be at pos44's right (pos54's left is pos44), but the agent is at pos54. So direction from pos54 to pos44 is dirleft. So to push the stone from pos44 to pos54, agent must be at pos44's right (pos54 is to the right of pos44), direction dirleft. Wait, agent at pos54, stone at pos44. Direction is dirleft (from pos54 to pos44). Then pushing the stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirleft would move it to pos43? No. Wait, the stone is at pos44, pushing dirleft would move it to pos34. But the agent is at pos54, so direction from agent to stone is dirleft. Then, pushing the stone in the same direction (dirleft) from pos44 to pos34. That's the same as earlier steps.

But if we push the stone to pos54, how? From pos44, dirright is pos54. So to push the stone to pos54, the agent must be at pos44's left (pos34), direction dirright. So agent at pos34, pushing stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirright).

But how does the agent get to pos34?

Agent's path:

pos21 → pos31 (dirright)

pos31 → pos41 (dirright)

pos41 → pos51 (dirright) → satisfies pos51 visit.

pos51 → pos52 (dirdown)

pos52 → pos53 (dirdown)

pos53 → pos54 (dirdown)

Now, agent is at pos54.

Then, agent needs to move to pos44's left (pos34) to push the stone to pos54.

But pos34 is clear. So agent moves from pos54 to pos44's left (pos34):

From pos54, movement options include pos44 (dirleft), pos53 (dirup), pos55 (dirdown).

So agent can move from pos54 to pos44 via dirleft, but pos44 has the stone. So can't move there. So agent must find another path.

Alternatively, agent moves from pos54 to pos44 via a different route. Wait, pos54's left is pos44. So direction dirleft from pos54 to pos44. But pos44 has the stone. So agent can't move there. So agent must push the stone from pos44 to pos54 while being at pos34.

So agent needs to get to pos34.

Path from pos54 to pos34:

pos54 → pos44 (dirleft) → blocked by stone.

Alternative path: pos54 → pos53 (dirup)

pos53 → pos43 (dirleft)

pos43 → pos33 (dirleft)

pos33 → pos34 (dirdown)

Now, agent is at pos34.

Then, push the stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirright). Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright. Now, stone is at pos54 (non-goal), agent at pos44.

This satisfies constraint 4 (pos54 not clear when stone is there). Also, since agent was at pos51 earlier, constraint 5 is satisfied.

Now, stone is at pos54. Next, push it to pos53 (dirleft). Agent at pos54's right (pos55?), but pos55 is clear. Wait, agent is at pos44 after pushing. To push stone from pos54 to pos53 (dirleft), agent must be at pos54's right (pos55), direction dirleft. But pos55 is clear.

So agent moves from pos44 to pos54 (dirright) → but pos54 has the stone. Can't move there. Instead, agent needs to go around.

Agent at pos44:

Possible moves: pos44 can move to pos34 (dirleft), pos54 (dirright), pos43 (dirup), pos45 (dirdown).

Agent moves to pos45 (dirdown).

From pos45, can move to pos35 (dirleft), pos55 (dirright), pos44 (dirup), pos46 (but pos46 doesn't exist).

So agent moves to pos55 (dirright from pos45).

From pos55, can move to pos45 (dirleft) or pos54 (dirup).

Agent moves to pos54 (dirup).

Now, agent is at pos54 again, but the stone is already there. Can't push because pos54 is occupied by the stone. So need to push the stone from pos54 to pos53.

To do that, agent must be at pos54's right (pos55), direction dirleft. So:

Agent moves from pos54 to pos55 (dirright).

Then, push stone from pos54 to pos53 (dirleft). Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos55 pos54 pos53 dirleft. Now, stone is at pos53, agent at pos54.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe this approach isn't efficient.

Alternative plan that satisfies all constraints:

Let's try to include a detour where the stone is at pos42 and pos23.

Steps:

1. Agent moves from pos21 to pos31 (dirright).

2. pos31 to pos41 (dirright).

3. pos41 to pos51 (dirright) → satisfies pos51 visit for constraint 5.

4. pos51 to pos52 (dirdown).

5. pos52 to pos53 (dirdown).

6. pos53 to pos54 (dirdown) → now pos54 is not clear (constraint 4), and since agent was at pos51 earlier, constraint 5 is satisfied.

7. Agent pushes stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirright) → agent is at pos44's left (pos34), but how to get there.

Wait, agent is at pos54. To push stone from pos44 to pos54, agent needs to be at pos44's left (pos34), direction dirright. But agent is at pos54. How to get to pos34?

Alternative route:

After step 6 (agent at pos54), move to pos44 via pos34:

7. pos54 → pos53 (dirup)

8. pos53 → pos43 (dirleft)

9. pos43 → pos33 (dirleft)

10. pos33 → pos34 (dirdown)

Now, agent is at pos34.

11. Push stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirright) → action pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright. Agent moves to pos44, stone at pos54.

Now, stone is at pos54, agent at pos44.

12. Agent moves to pos43 (dirup).

13. Push stone from pos54 to pos53 (dirleft) → requires agent at pos54's right (pos55), but agent is at pos43. Not possible.

This isn't working. Let's think differently.

Maybe after pushing the stone to pos54, we then move it to pos53, pos52, pos42, etc.

But this is time-consuming. Let's consider the constraints again.

We need to have:

- stone at pos23 (constraint 7).

- pos23 not clear must have occurred after stone at pos42 (constraint 3).

- pos24 not clear (constraint 6).

- pos54 not clear (constraint 4), and when that happens, player1 was at pos51 earlier.

- player1 must be at pos54 (constraint 8), and when that happens, pos44 was not clear earlier.

- pos43 not clear can only be in one continuous sequence.

Also, the main goal is to get stone1 to pos25.

So perhaps the plan should be:

1. Move player1 to pos51 (via pos21 → pos31 → pos41 → pos51), satisfying the requirement for constraint 5.

2. Then move to pos54 (pos51 → pos52 → pos53 → pos54), making pos54 not clear (constraint 4 and 8). At this point, player1 is at pos54 (constraint 8 satisfied). Also, before this, pos44 was not clear (since the stone was at pos44). So constraint 9 requires that when player1 is at pos54, pos44 was not clear earlier. Which is true because pos44 has the stone initially.

3. Push the stone from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft), using agent at pos54 → requires agent to be at pos44's right (pos54 is to the right of pos44), direction dirleft. But agent is at pos54. So direction from agent to stone is dirleft. Action pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirleft. After this, agent is at pos44, stone at pos34. pos54 becomes clear.

4. Now, agent is at pos44. Move to pos34 (dirleft).

5. Push stone from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft). Action pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos34 pos24 dirleft. No, wait: agent is at pos34, stone is at pos34. That's not possible. Wait, after step 3, the stone is at pos34, and agent is at pos44.

So after step 3, agent is at pos44, stone at pos34.

4. Move agent from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft).

5. Push stone from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft). Action pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos34 pos24 dirleft → invalid, because the agent is at pos34, which is where the stone is. So the agent must be adjacent to the stone. So to push the stone from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft), the agent must be at pos34's right (pos44), direction dirleft. So agent is at pos44.

But after step 3, agent is at pos44. So:

4. Push stone from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft). Action pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos24 dirleft. Agent moves to pos34, stone at pos24. Now, pos24 is not clear (constraint 6 and part of constraint 1).

5. Agent is at pos34. Move to pos24 (dirleft).

6. Push stone from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown). Agent must be at pos24's up (pos23), direction dirdown. So agent needs to get to pos23.

Path from pos24 to pos23:

 pos24 → pos23 (dirup).

But pos24's up is pos23. So agent can move from pos24 to pos23 via dirup.

7. Agent moves from pos24 to pos23 (dirup).

8. Push stone from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown). Action pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown. Stone is now at pos25, goal achieved.

But we still need to satisfy constraint 3 (when pos23 is not clear, stone was at pos42 earlier) and constraint 7 (stone must be at pos23 in some state).

In this plan, the stone was at pos24 and pos25. It was never at pos23 or pos42. So constraints 3 and 7 are violated.

So this plan is invalid.

Thus, we need to incorporate a detour where the stone is at pos42 and pos23.

Let me attempt a new plan that includes these steps.

Plan:

1. Agent moves to pos51 (for constraint 5).

   - pos21 → pos31 (dirright)

   - pos31 → pos41 (dirright)

   - pos41 → pos51 (dirright)

2. Agent moves to pos54 to satisfy constraint 8 and 4.

   - pos51 → pos52 (dirdown)

   - pos52 → pos53 (dirdown)

   - pos53 → pos54 (dirdown)

   Now, agent is at pos54 (constraint 8), pos54 not clear (constraint 4), and earlier was at pos51 (constraint 5).

3. Push stone from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft) → agent at pos54, direction dirleft to pos44.

   Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirleft.

   Now, agent is at pos44, stone at pos34.

4. Agent moves to pos34 (dirleft from pos44).

5. Push stone from pos34 to pos33 (dirup) → agent at pos34's down (pos44), direction dirup.

   Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos33 dirup.

   Agent moves to pos34, stone at pos33.

6. Agent moves to pos33 (dirup from pos34).

7. Push stone from pos33 to pos32 (dirup) → agent must be at pos33's down (pos43), but agent is at pos33.

   So agent needs to move to pos43.

   pos33 → pos43 (dirright).

8. Push stone from pos33 to pos32 (dirup) → action pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos32 dirup.

   Agent moves to pos33, stone at pos32.

9. Push stone from pos32 to pos22 (dirup) → agent must be at pos32's down (pos42).

   Agent moves to pos42 (dirright from pos32? Not sure. Need to check movements.

   From pos32: movements include pos22 (dirleft), pos42 (dirright), pos31 (dirup), pos33 (dirdown).

   Agent moves from pos33 → pos32 (dirdown).

   Then, push from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft).

   Action pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos32 pos22 dirleft. Wait, agent must be at a position adjacent to the stone. Stone is at pos32. To push left to pos22, agent must be at pos32's right (pos42), direction dirleft.

   So:

9. Agent moves from pos33 to pos32 (dirdown).

10. Agent moves to pos42 (dirright from pos32).

11. Push stone from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft). Action pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft. Agent moves to pos32, stone at pos22.

12. Now, push stone from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown). Agent must be at pos22's up (pos12?), but agent is at pos32.

   Alternatively, agent moves to pos22 (dirleft from pos32), then push down.

   This is getting too complicated and time-consuming, and likely exceeds the optimal plan length.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the optimal plan is to push the stone directly to pos25 while detouring through pos23 and pos42 to meet the constraints.

Final plan (simplified, but ensuring constraints are met):

1. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (dirright).

2. Move to pos41 (dirright).

3. Move to pos51 (dirright) → satisfies pos51 for constraint 5.

4. Move to pos52 (dirdown).

5. Move to pos53 (dirdown).

6. Move to pos54 (dirdown) → pos54 not clear (constraint 4, 8).

7. Push stone from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft) → player1 at pos54, action pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirleft. Now, agent at pos44, stone at pos34.

8. Move to pos34 (dirleft).

9. Push stone from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft) → agent at pos34, action pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos34 pos24 dirleft. No, agent must be at pos34's right (pos44). So agent moves back to pos44.

8. Move to pos44 (dirright from pos34? No. After step 7, agent is at pos44. So step 7: agent is at pos44.

9. Push stone from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft) → agent at pos44, action pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos24 dirleft. Now, agent at pos34, stone at pos24.

10. Move to pos24 (dirleft).

11. Push stone from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown) → agent at pos24's up (pos23). So agent needs to move to pos23.

12. Move from pos24 to pos23 (dirup).

13. Push stone to pos25: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown.

Now, check constraints:

- Stone at pos25 (goal achieved).

- pos54 not clear in step 6 (constraint 4).

- pos24 not clear when stone is there (constraint 6 and part of constraint 1).

- player1 at pos54 (constraint 8).

- pos44 was not clear initially (stone there), so when player1 is at pos54, pos44 was not clear (constraint 9).

But missing constraints:

- stone must be at pos23 (constraint 7).

- pos23 must be not clear (constraint 2) which requires stone to be there.

- constraint 3: if pos23 is not clear, stone was at pos42 earlier.

- stone must be at pos42 at some point.

Thus, this plan doesn't satisfy all constraints. Therefore, we need to adjust.

Alternative approach: After step 7, instead of pushing to pos34, push the stone to pos43 (dirup), then to pos42, then to pos23.

7. After reaching pos54 (step 6), agent pushes stone from pos44 to pos43 (dirup).

   Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos43 dirup. Agent at pos44, stone at pos43.

8. Agent moves to pos43 (dirup from pos44).

9. Push stone from pos43 to pos42 (dirup).

   Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos42 dirup. Agent at pos43, stone at pos42.

   Now, stone is at pos42 (satisfies part of constraint 1).

10. Agent moves to pos42 (dirup from pos43).

11. Push stone from pos42 to pos32 (dirup).

    Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos42 pos32 dirup. Agent at pos42, stone at pos32.

12. Agent moves to pos32 (dirup).

13. Push stone from pos32 to pos22 (dirup).

    Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos32 pos22 dirup. Agent at pos32, stone at pos22.

14. Agent moves to pos22 (dirup).

15. Push stone from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown).

    Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos22 pos23 dirdown. Agent at pos22, stone at pos23.

    Now, constraint 7 is satisfied (stone at pos23), and pos23 is not clear (constraint 2). Also, since stone was at pos42 earlier (step 9), constraint 3 is satisfied.

16. Agent moves to pos23 (dirdown from pos22).

17. Push stone from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown).

    Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos23 pos24 dirdown. Agent at pos23, stone at pos24.

18. Push stone from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown).

    Action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown. Stone at pos25, goal achieved.

This plan satisfies:

- stone at pos42 (step 9), satisfying part of constraint 1.

- pos23 not clear (step 15), and prior stone at pos42 (constraint 3).

- pos24 not clear (step 17) (constraint 6 and part of constraint 1).

- pos54 not clear (step 6) (constraint 4), with prior agent at pos51 (constraint 5).

- player1 at pos54 (step 6) (constraint 8), with prior pos44 not clear (constraint 9).

- pos43 not clear happens when agent is there (steps 8-9), but need to check if it's in at most one continuous sequence. From steps 7-9, pos43 is not clear when agent is there. Then, agent leaves pos43, so pos43 is clear again. No other sequences, so constraint 10 is satisfied.

Thus, this plan meets all constraints and the goal.
