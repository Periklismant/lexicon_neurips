**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Move to pos32:** The agent moves down from pos31 to pos32 to get adjacent to the stone at pos33.
2. **Push stone to pos34:** The agent pushes the stone down to pos34, positioning it closer to the goal.
3. **Move to pos23:** The agent moves left to pos23, satisfying the constraint that they must be at pos23. Before this step, the stone was at pos34 (not pos35 or pos54 occupied), but this plan might not meet the constraint. However, this step is required for another constraint.
4. **Push stone to pos44:** From pos23, the agent pushes the stone right to pos44, moving it toward the goal.
5. **Move to pos24:** The agent moves down to pos24 to position for the final push.
6. **Push stone to goal:** Finally, the agent pushes the stone right to the goal pos54, completing the task.

This plan ensures the stone reaches the goal while attempting to satisfy constraints, though some steps may need adjustment based on precise precondition checks.
