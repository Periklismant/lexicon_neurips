Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. First, I need to understand the initial state and the goal. The agent (player1) starts at pos31, and the stone (stone1) is at pos33. The goal is to get stone1 to a goal location, which from the given data is pos54. So the main objective is to move stone1 to pos54.

But there are a bunch of constraints to consider. Let's list them out to make sure I don't miss any:

1. "Location pos24 is not clear" can only be true in at most one continuous sequence. So pos24 can't be occupied in two separate periods; it has to be a single block of time.
2. The agent must be at pos23 in at least one state. But if they are, then either pos54 is not clear or stone1 is at pos35 in an earlier state.
3. pos23 must be not clear in at least one state. And if that happens, pos15 must have been not clear in an earlier state.
4. stone1 must be at pos53 in at least one state. So we have to move it there temporarily.
5. pos34 can't be non-clear in more than one continuous sequence. Also, pos34 must be non-clear in at least one state. And if pos34 is non-clear, then either pos33 was not clear or pos15 wasn't clear earlier.
6. The agent must be at pos43 at least once.

Hmm. So, let's start by figuring out the path for the stone. The stone starts at pos33. To get it to pos54 (the goal), the agent needs to push it through various positions. Let's think about possible paths.

From pos33, possible directions are left (to pos23), right (to pos43), up (to pos32), or down (to pos34). But the agent is initially at pos31. So the agent needs to reach pos33 to push the stone. But wait, the agent can move through adjacent cells. Let's see the movement possibilities.

The agent is at pos31. They can move to pos21 (left), pos41 (right), or pos32 (down). To get to pos33, which is where the stone is, the agent might need to go down to pos32, then down again to pos33? Wait, looking at the movement rules:

From pos31, possible moves are dirleft to pos21, dirright to pos41, or dirdown to pos32. From pos32, they can go left (dirleft to pos22?), wait no. Let me check the movement connections again.

Looking at the movement connections provided:

For pos31:
- You may move from location pos31 to pos21 following dirleft
- to pos41 via dirright
- to pos32 via dirdown.

From pos32:
- dirleft to pos22
- dirright to pos42
- dirup to pos31
- dirdown to pos33.

Ah, so from pos32, moving down (dirdown) takes the agent to pos33. But pos33 currently has the stone, which is not clear. So the agent can't move there unless they push the stone. Wait, the stone is at pos33, so that location is not clear. So the agent can't move directly into pos33. So the agent needs to get adjacent to pos33 to push the stone.

Wait, the initial state says "Location pos33 is clear" — no, wait, the original state lists "Location pos33 is clear" under the initial state? Let me check again.

Looking at the original state:

The original state includes "Location pos33 is clear"? Wait, no. Wait the original state lists:

"player1 is at location pos31"

"stone1 is at location pos33"

Then under the "Location ... is clear" statements:

"Location pos32 is clear"

"Location pos34 is clear"

...

"Location pos31 is clear" (no, player1 is there, so that's a contradiction. Wait, no, the original state says "player1 is at location pos31", so pos31 is not clear. Similarly, stone1 is at pos33, so pos33 is not clear. But looking back, the list of "Location ... is clear" includes:

"Location pos31 is clear" — wait, that can't be right because player1 is at pos31. That's probably a mistake. Wait, the user provided the original state. Let me check again.

Original state:

The original state of the world is the following:

	"player1 is at location pos31"

	"stone1 is at location pos33"

	"Location pos11 is clear"

	... (many locations listed as clear, including pos32, pos34, etc.)

	"Location pos31 is clear"

Wait, that's conflicting. Because if player1 is at pos31, then pos31 is not clear. So this must be an error in the problem statement. Or perhaps "Location pos31 is clear" is a typo. Because the initial state can't have both "player1 at pos31" and "pos31 is clear". So maybe there's a mistake here. But according to the given data, pos31 is clear. That must be a mistake. But I have to proceed with the given information. Wait, perhaps "Location pos31 is clear" is listed, but the player is there. That's impossible. Therefore, maybe the correct initial state is that pos31 is not clear (since the player is there), but the problem statement says it's clear. This seems like a contradiction. Hmm. But the problem says that the original state is as given, so perhaps there's a mistake here. However, I have to take the problem as given. Wait, looking again:

In the original state:

	"player1 is at location pos31"

	"stone1 is at location pos33"

	"Location pos11 is clear"

	"Location pos12 is clear"

	...

	"Location pos31 is clear"

Wait, that's conflicting. If the player is at pos31, then pos31 can't be clear. So this must be an error. But perhaps in the problem, "clear" means that there's no stone, but the agent can be there. Wait, the problem states that each position may contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. So "clear" would mean that the position is empty. So if the agent is at pos31, then pos31 is not clear. Therefore, the original state says "player1 is at pos31" and "Location pos31 is clear" — which is impossible. Therefore, this must be a typo. The user probably meant that pos31 is not clear, but perhaps in the problem statement, "Location pos31 is clear" is listed. But according to the problem's original state, the agent is at pos31, so pos31 is occupied and not clear. Therefore, the given initial state has a contradiction, but perhaps the user made a mistake. However, since the problem states the original state as such, perhaps the correct initial state is that pos31 is not clear (because the agent is there), and the "Location pos31 is clear" is a mistake. But how to resolve this?

Wait, looking back at the problem statement's original state:

The original state includes:

"Location pos31 is clear" — but player1 is at pos31, so that's impossible. Therefore, this must be an error. But since the problem is given as such, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that "Location pos31 is clear" is a mistake and ignore it. Or maybe the problem uses "clear" to mean that there's no stone. Wait, the problem says: Each position may contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. So a location is clear if it's empty. So if the agent is at pos31, then pos31 is not clear. But the original state says "Location pos31 is clear". That's a contradiction. Therefore, this must be a mistake in the problem statement. But since I have to work with the given information, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.

Alternatively, maybe "Location pos31 is clear" is correct, and the agent is not at pos31. But the problem says "player1 is at location pos31". So this is a contradiction. Therefore, the problem statement is inconsistent. However, perhaps the user intended that the initial state has the player at pos31, and pos31 is not clear, but other locations are as listed. Therefore, the correct initial state would have pos31 occupied by the player, hence not clear. The other locations, like pos32, pos34, etc., are clear. So the agent is at pos31 (not clear), stone1 is at pos33 (not clear). All other locations listed as clear are correct.

Therefore, the agent starts at pos31 (pos31 not clear), stone at pos33 (pos33 not clear), and other locations like pos32, pos34, etc., are clear.

So the first step is for the agent to move towards the stone. The agent is at pos31. To reach the stone at pos33, the agent needs to get adjacent to it. From pos31, the agent can move down to pos32 (since pos32 is clear). Then from pos32, they can move down to pos33? Wait, pos33 has the stone, so the agent can't move there. So they need to push the stone.

Wait, the agent can't move into a location that's not clear. So to push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent to it and then perform a push action. So from pos32, the agent is at pos32. The stone is at pos33. The agent can push the stone from pos33 by being at pos32 (l_p is pos32, l_from is pos33, but wait, the direction has to be such that the agent is moving into the stone's position. Wait, the push actions require that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's current position), and then the direction d allows moving from l_p to l_from (so the agent is next to the stone in direction d). Then the stone is pushed from l_from to l_to in direction d.

Wait, the preconditions for pushtogoal or pushtonongoal:

For "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d", the agent must be at l_p, the stone at l_from, l_to must be clear, the agent can move from l_p to l_from via direction d (so adjacent in direction d), and l_from to l_to via direction d (so pushing the stone in the same direction). So for example, if the agent is at pos32 and the stone is at pos33, and the direction is dirdown, then l_p is pos32, l_from is pos33, and l_to would be pos43 (since from pos33, moving dirdown would be pos43? Wait, looking at the movement directions. Let's check.

From pos33, moving dirdown would be to pos34? Or is the direction based on standard grid movement? Let me check the movement connections provided.

Looking at the movement from pos33:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown"

So, the directions are mapped as:

dirleft from pos33 → pos23 (left column)

dirright → pos43 (right column)

dirup → pos32 (up row)

dirdown → pos34 (down row)

So, if the agent is at pos32 (which is above pos33), then direction dirdown would move to pos33. But the stone is at pos33. So the agent can't move there. So to push the stone down (to pos34), the agent needs to be at pos33's up neighbor (pos32), push in dirdown direction. Wait, the agent is at pos32. To push the stone at pos33 down to pos34, the direction would be dirdown. So the agent moves from pos32 to pos33 (direction dirdown) and pushes the stone to pos34. But pos34 must be clear. Let's check: initial state says pos34 is clear. So that's possible.

So the action would be "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown". But pos34 is a non-goal location (since pos54 is the only goal). Wait, pos54 is the goal, so pos34 is not. Therefore, pushing to pos34 would require using pushtonongoal. But the goal is to get the stone to pos54. So the first step could be pushing the stone from pos33 to pos34, then further moves.

But wait, after pushing to pos34, the stone is there. Then the agent is at pos33 (since after pushing, the agent moves into the stone's previous position). Then, the agent can move to push the stone further. But let's think of the constraints.

One constraint is that stone1 must be at pos53 in at least one state. So we have to move it there. Also, the agent must be at pos43 at least once. And pos34 must be non-clear in at least one state, but only once continuously.

Hmm. So perhaps the path for the stone is pos33 → pos34 → pos44 → pos54. But pos44 to pos54 is via dirright (from pos44, moving right to pos54). Wait, checking the movement from pos44: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright". So yes. So pushing the stone from pos44 to pos54 would be a valid pushtogoal action, since pos54 is a goal.

So the plan could be:

1. Agent moves from pos31 to pos32 (move action).

2. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos34 (pushtonongoal, since pos34 is not a goal).

3. Agent then is at pos33. Then, the agent can move to pos34 (but pos34 has the stone now, so they can't. Wait, after pushing, the stone is at pos34, and the agent is at pos33. So the agent is now at pos33, which is clear (since the stone was moved). Then, the agent can move from pos33 to pos34? Wait, pos34 has the stone now, so it's not clear. So agent can't move there. So the agent needs to move elsewhere.

Alternatively, after pushing to pos34, the agent is at pos33. From there, the agent can move up to pos32, or left to pos23, right to pos43, or down to pos34 (but pos34 is occupied). So let's say the agent moves right to pos43. Wait, from pos33, moving dirright is to pos43. But does the movement allow that? Let me check the movement connections for pos33:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown"

So yes, from pos33, the agent can move right (dirright) to pos43 if it's clear. After pushing the stone to pos34, pos43 is clear (since initially, pos43 is clear). So after step 2, the agent is at pos33. Then step 3: move player1 from pos33 to pos43 via dirright. That's a move action.

But wait, after the push action, the agent is at pos33. So pos33 is now occupied by the agent. Then, moving to pos43 requires that pos43 is clear. Which it is initially. So step 3 would be "move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright".

Then, the agent is at pos43. Now, the stone is at pos34. The agent needs to get to pos34 to push it further. But how? The agent is at pos43. To reach pos34, they need to go left to pos33 (if clear) and then down to pos34. But pos33 is currently occupied by the agent after step 3. Wait, no: after step 3, the agent moved from pos33 to pos43. So after step 3, the agent is at pos43, pos33 is clear again. So pos33 is clear.

So step 4: move player1 from pos43 to pos33 via dirleft. Then step 5: move from pos33 to pos34 via dirdown. But pos34 has the stone. So can't move there. So instead, after step 3 (agent at pos43), the stone is at pos34. To push the stone from pos34 to pos44, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos34. The agent is at pos43. The stone is at pos34. The agent can't reach pos34 from pos43 directly. So perhaps the agent needs to move from pos43 to pos44 (dirright?), but wait, let's check movement from pos43:

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown"

So from pos43, dirleft is pos33, dirright is pos53, dirup is pos42, dirdown is pos44.

So the agent is at pos43. To reach pos34, the agent would need to go up to pos42, then left to pos32, then down to pos33, then down to pos34. Hmm, this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the agent can go from pos43 down to pos44 (dirdown), then left to pos34 (dirleft). But from pos44, moving dirleft is to pos34. So, if pos44 is clear, the agent can move to pos44, then to pos34.

Wait, but after step 3, the agent is at pos43. The stone is at pos34. Let's think:

After step 2: stone1 is at pos34, agent at pos33.

Step 3: move agent to pos43.

Step 4: move agent from pos43 to pos44 via dirdown. If pos44 is clear (initially it's clear, and after step 3, pos44 is still clear), then yes. So step 4 is "move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown".

Now, agent is at pos44. From here, they can move left to pos34 (dirleft), but pos34 has the stone. So they can push the stone from pos34 to pos44? Wait, no. Wait, if the agent is at pos44 and the stone is at pos34, they are not adjacent. To push the stone from pos34 to pos44, the agent needs to be at pos34's neighboring cell in the direction opposite to the push. For example, to push the stone from pos34 to pos44 (which is to the right), the agent would need to be at pos34's left (pos24?), but pos34's left is pos24. But the agent is at pos44. Alternatively, maybe the stone is at pos34, and the agent is at pos34's up neighbor (pos24) to push it down to pos34 to pos44. But pos24 is initially clear. So the agent needs to get to pos24 to push the stone down. But that's a long path.

Alternatively, perhaps the stone can be pushed from pos34 to pos44 by the agent being at pos33 (left of pos34) and pushing right. Wait, pos34's left neighbor is pos24? Wait no. Let's check the movement directions again.

From pos34, moving dirright would be to pos44. So if the stone is at pos34, to push it to pos44 (right), the agent needs to be at pos34's left neighbor (pos24) and push right. But the agent is currently at pos44. So this approach isn't working. Maybe there's a better path.

Alternatively, after step 2, the stone is at pos34. The agent is at pos33. From there, the agent can move up to pos32, then left to pos22, etc. But this seems to be going away from the stone.

Alternatively, perhaps after pushing the stone to pos34, the agent should move around to pos44 to push it further. Let's think:

After step 2, stone is at pos34. Agent is at pos33. To push the stone to pos44, the agent needs to be at pos34's left (pos24?), but that's not adjacent. Alternatively, the agent could move to pos43, then pos44, then push the stone east to pos54? No, pos44 to pos54 is dirright. So if the stone is at pos44, pushing it right to pos54 (which is a goal) would use pushtogoal.

But how to get the stone from pos34 to pos44.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the agent is at pos33. Then, move to pos34. But pos34 is occupied by the stone. So can't. So the agent needs to move around. Let's see:

Step 3: move agent from pos33 to pos43 (dirright).

Step 4: move agent from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown).

Now, agent is at pos44. The stone is at pos34. The agent is not adjacent to the stone. So how to get to the stone.

Alternatively, after step 2, agent is at pos33. Then, move to pos23 (dirleft). Then from pos23, move to pos24 (dirdown). Then from pos24, move to pos34 (dirright). But pos34 has the stone, so can't move there. Alternatively, from pos24, push the stone from pos34 to pos44. But the agent is at pos24, which is left of pos34. To push the stone east (dirright) from pos34 to pos44, the agent needs to be at pos34's west neighbor (pos24), push in dirright direction. So yes. So:

After step 2: stone at pos34, agent at pos33.

Step 3: move agent from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft). pos23 is clear initially.

Step 4: move agent from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown). pos24 is clear.

Step 5: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright. Because pos44 is a non-goal location (since only pos54 is a goal). But pos44 is not a goal, so this is valid. But wait, pos44 is not a goal, so we need to push to a goal later. 

After this push, the stone is at pos44, and the agent moves to pos34. Then, from pos34, the agent can push the stone to pos54 (dirright), which is a goal. So step 6: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright.

But before that, need to check if pos54 is clear. Initially, pos54 is clear. So after step 5, stone is at pos44, agent at pos34. Then step 6: pushtogoal.

But let's check the constraints:

- The stone must be at pos53 at least once. So current plan doesn't do that. So we need to adjust.

Also, the agent must be at pos43 at least once. In the previous steps, after step 3, the agent was at pos43. So that's covered.

Another constraint: pos23 must be not clear in at least one state. In step 3, the agent was at pos23, so pos23 is not clear during that step.

But also, the constraint says that if pos23 is not clear in some state, then there must be an earlier state where pos15 is not clear or pos54 is not clear. Wait, the constraint is:

"If expression "player1 is at location pos23" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "Location pos54 is not clear", "stone1 is at location pos35"""

So if the agent is at pos23 at any point, then before that, either pos54 is not clear or stone1 was at pos35. In our current steps, the agent is at pos23 in step 3. But at that point, pos54 is still clear (since we haven't pushed the stone there yet), and stone1 is at pos34, not pos35. So this violates the constraint. Therefore, our current plan is invalid.

Ah, right. So moving the agent to pos23 (step 3) requires that before that, either pos54 is not clear or stone1 is at pos35. But in the initial steps, neither is true. Therefore, the plan as outlined is invalid.

This means we need to adjust the plan to satisfy this constraint.

So, how to ensure that when the agent is at pos23, there's a prior state where pos54 is not clear or stone1 is at pos35.

Possibly, we need to first move stone1 to pos35, then move the agent to pos23. But getting the stone to pos35 would require pushing it there. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe during the plan, pos54 becomes not clear (e.g., by having the stone there) before the agent goes to pos23. But if the stone is at pos54 (the goal), then the plan is complete, but the agent still needs to go to pos23 afterward, which may not be possible.

This complicates things. Let's think of another approach.

Another constraint is that stone1 must be at pos53 in at least one state. So we need to route the stone through pos53.

Let's consider a different path for the stone: pos33 → pos34 → pos44 → pos54 is one way, but to get to pos53, perhaps we need to push it to pos43, then pos53, then pos54.

But how?

Alternatively, pos33 → pos43 → pos53 → pos54.

Let's see:

To push the stone from pos33 to pos43, the agent needs to be at pos33's right neighbor (pos43's left neighbor is pos33). Wait, pos33's right neighbor is pos43. So to push the stone from pos33 to pos43 (dirright), the agent must be at pos33's left neighbor (pos23) or other? Wait, no. Wait, the agent needs to be adjacent to the stone in the direction of the push. For example, to push the stone east (dirright) from pos33 to pos43, the agent must be west of pos33 (pos23) and push east. Or maybe south? Wait, the direction depends on the movement connections.

Wait, the movement from pos33 to pos43 is dirright. So to push the stone from pos33 to pos43, the agent needs to be at pos33's left (pos23) and push right. So the action would be "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright".

But how does the agent get to pos23?

The agent starts at pos31. To get to pos23, they need to move from pos31 to pos21 (dirleft), then to pos22 (dirdown), then to pos23 (dirdown). But pos21 is clear initially. So:

Step 1: move player1 from pos31 to pos21 (dirleft).

Step 2: move player1 from pos21 to pos22 (dirdown).

Step 3: move player1 from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown).

Now, the agent is at pos23. Then, they can push the stone from pos33 to pos43 (dirright). But this requires that pos43 is clear. Initially, pos43 is clear. So step 4: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright.

After this, the stone is at pos43, and the agent is at pos33.

Now, the agent needs to move to pos43 to push the stone further. But after step 4, the agent is at pos33. To get to pos43, they can move dirright to pos43. pos43 is now occupied by the stone, so they can't move there. So they need to push the stone again.

Alternatively, after step 4, the stone is at pos43. The agent is at pos33. From there, the agent can move to pos34 (dirdown) if it's clear. But initially, pos34 is clear, but after step 4, pos34 is still clear. So step 5: move player1 from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown).

Now, the agent is at pos34. They can push the stone from pos43 to pos53 (dirright). To do this, the agent needs to be at pos43's west neighbor (pos33), but they are at pos34. Alternatively, the agent can go to pos44 and push north.

Wait, the stone is at pos43. To push it to pos53 (dirright), the agent needs to be at pos43's left (pos33) and push right. But the agent is at pos34. So they need to move to pos33.

Step 5: move from pos34 to pos33 (dirup).

Now, agent is at pos33. Then, step 6: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirright. This requires that pos53 is clear. Initially, pos53 is clear.

After this, the stone is at pos53 (satisfying the constraint that it must be there at least once), and the agent is at pos43.

Then, step 7: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos53 pos54 dirdown. Because pos54 is a goal location. But first, the agent must be at pos43, the stone at pos53, and pos54 must be clear. pos54 is clear initially, but after previous steps, if the agent is at pos43 and the stone is at pos53, pos54 is clear. Then, pushing down from pos53 to pos54 (dirdown). Let's check movement from pos53 to pos54: "You may move from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown". So yes.

So step 7: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos53 pos54 dirdown.

After this, the stone is at pos54 (goal), and the agent is at pos53.

Now, let's check all constraints:

1. "Location pos24 is not clear" in at most one continuous sequence. In this plan, pos24 is only occupied if the agent is there. But in this current plan, the agent never goes to pos24. So this constraint is satisfied.

But wait, the plan we just outlined doesn't have pos24 being occupied. So the constraint is satisfied as it never occurs.

2. The agent must be at pos23 in at least one state. In step 3, the agent is at pos23. Check. But then, the constraint requires that before that, either pos54 is not clear or stone1 is at pos35. In our plan, before step 3 (steps 1-2), pos54 is clear and stone1 is at pos33. So this violates the constraint. Therefore, this plan is invalid.

So we need to adjust the plan to satisfy this.

So, how to get the agent to pos23 while ensuring that before that, either pos54 is not clear or stone1 is at pos35.

But pos54 is the goal, so if we first push the stone to pos54, then pos54 is not clear. But then the plan would be complete. But the agent needs to go to pos23 after that, which is unnecessary. But the constraint requires that the agent is at pos23 in at least one state, so the plan must include that.

Alternatively, arrange for stone1 to be at pos35 before the agent is at pos23.

So let's adjust the plan.

Alternative approach:

1. Move the stone to pos35 first, then move the agent to pos23.

But how to push the stone to pos35.

The stone starts at pos33. To get to pos35, the path could be pos33 → pos34 → pos35.

So steps:

Step 1: agent moves from pos31 to pos32 (dirdown).

Step 2: push stone1 from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown). Agent is now at pos33.

Step 3: agent moves from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown). But pos34 has the stone. Wait, no. After step 2, the stone is at pos34, agent at pos33. So pos34 is occupied. So agent can't move there. So instead, agent needs to push the stone from pos34 to pos35.

To do that, the agent needs to be at pos34's up neighbor (pos24) to push down. But how to get there.

Alternatively, after step 2, agent is at pos33. Moves to pos34 (can't), so moves elsewhere. Let's try:

Step 3: agent moves from pos33 to pos43 (dirright).

Step 4: agent moves from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown).

Step 5: agent moves from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft).

But pos34 has the stone. So can't move there. So instead, agent needs to push the stone from pos34 to pos35.

To push from pos34 to pos35 (dirdown), the agent must be at pos34's up neighbor (pos24) and push down.

So steps:

After step 2 (stone at pos34, agent at pos33):

Step 3: agent moves from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft).

Step 4: agent moves from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown).

Step 5: push stone1 from pos34 to pos35 (dirdown) using pushtonongoal. Because pos35 is not a goal.

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos35 dirdown.

After this, stone is at pos35, agent at pos34.

Now, the agent can move to pos23 (dirup from pos24 to pos23), satisfying the constraint that when they are at pos23, there's a prior state (step 5) where stone1 is at pos35. 

So step 6: move agent from pos24 to pos23 (dirup).

Now, the agent is at pos23, and the stone is at pos35. This satisfies the constraint because before step 6 (step 5), stone1 was at pos35.

Then, proceed to move the stone from pos35 to pos45, then to pos55, then to pos54. But that seems longer. Alternatively, perhaps push the stone from pos35 to pos45 (dirright), then to pos55 (dirright), then to pos54 (dirup). But pos55 is not a goal, so need to push to pos54.

But this may not be optimal. Alternatively, after step 5, stone is at pos35. Now, the agent is at pos34. The stone needs to go to pos54. To get there, perhaps push it from pos35 to pos45 (dirright), then to pos44 (dirleft?), but this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, after step 5, the stone is at pos35. The agent is at pos34. The agent can then move to pos35 (but it's occupied by the stone). So they need to push it further.

Step 6: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos35 pos45 dirright. But pos45 is clear.

After this, stone is at pos45, agent at pos35.

Then, agent moves to pos45 (can't), but can push from pos45 to pos55 (dirright), then to pos54 (dirup). But pos55 is not a goal. So step 7: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos55 pos54 dirup.

But pos54 is a goal, so pushtogoal. But pos55 is not adjacent to pos54. Let's check movement from pos55 to pos54: "You may move from location pos55 to location pos54 following direction dirup". So yes. So pushing from pos55 to pos54 would require the agent to be south of pos55 (but there's no location south of pos55), or perhaps from pos55's north neighbor. Wait, the directions are mapped such that dirdown is south, dirup is north, etc.

Wait, movement from pos55 to pos54 is dirup. So to push the stone from pos55 to pos54 (dirup), the agent must be at pos55's south neighbor (which doesn't exist), or perhaps the movement is allowed. Wait, looking at the movement connections:

"You may move from location pos55 to location pos45 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos55 to location pos54 following direction dirup"

So yes, from pos55, dirup is pos54. So to push the stone from pos55 to pos54, the agent must be at pos55's south neighbor (but there's no pos65), so this might not be possible. Alternatively, the agent is at pos54 and pushes up. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the directions wrong. For pos55, moving dirup would be to pos54. So the agent needs to be at pos55 to push the stone up to pos54. But that doesn't make sense. Wait, the movement from pos55 to pos54 is dirup. So the agent can be at pos55 and move dirup to pos54. But if the stone is at pos55, the agent can't be there. So perhaps this approach isn't feasible.

Alternatively, after step 5, the stone is at pos35. The agent needs to push it east to pos45, then south to pos44, then east to pos54. But pos44 to pos54 is dirright. So:

Step 6: push stone1 from pos35 to pos45 (dirright). Agent at pos35.

Step 7: push stone1 from pos45 to pos44 (dirleft). Agent at pos45.

But pos44 is east of pos45? No, pos44 is west of pos45. So pushing from pos45 to pos44 would be dirleft. 

Wait, movement from pos45: "You may move from location pos45 to location pos35 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos45 to location pos55 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos45 to location pos44 following direction dirup"

So to push from pos45 to pos44, the agent must be at pos45's down neighbor (pos55) and push up. But pos55 is clear. So agent would need to move to pos55, then push up.

But this is getting too complicated. Perhaps there's a better path.

Alternatively, after step 5, the stone is at pos35. The agent is at pos34. The agent can move to pos35 (can't), so instead, move to pos44 (dirright from pos34 to pos44). Then push the stone from pos35 to pos45 (dirright). But the agent is at pos44, not adjacent to pos35.

This is getting too tangled. Let's rethink.

Alternative approach: satisfy the constraints first.

Constraint requiring agent to be at pos23: let's plan to have that happen after stone1 is at pos35 or pos54 is not clear.

Since pos54 is the goal, once the stone is there, the agent can't use pos54 being not clear to justify moving to pos23. So perhaps we need to have the stone at pos35 before the agent goes to pos23.

So steps:

1. Move agent from pos31 to pos32 (move).

2. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos34 (pushtonongoal).

3. Move agent from pos33 to pos34 (can't, as it's occupied by the stone). So instead, move to pos43.

4. Move agent from pos33 to pos43 (dirright).

5. Move agent from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown).

6. Move agent from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft) – but pos34 has the stone. Can't.

7. So instead, push stone1 from pos34 to pos35 (requires agent to be at pos24).

So agent needs to move from pos43 to pos44, then to pos34, but that's occupied. Alternatively, go back to pos33, then to pos23, etc.

This is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to outline a valid plan that meets all constraints.

Given the time constraints, I'll attempt to write the step-by-step plan with all constraints satisfied:

1. Move player1 from pos31 to pos32 (dirright is to pos41? Wait, no. Wait, the movement from pos31 is dirleft to pos21, dirright to pos41, dirdown to pos32. So step 1: move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown.

2. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos34 (pushtonongoal) since pos34 is not a goal. Preconditions: agent is at pos32 (l_p), stone at pos33 (l_from), pos34 clear. Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown.

Now, agent is at pos33, stone at pos34.

3. Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 (dirright). Action: move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright.

4. Now, agent is at pos43. Need to satisfy the constraint that agent is at pos43 at least once. Check.

Next, need to get the stone from pos34 to pos44. To do that, agent needs to be at pos34's adjacent position. So:

5. Move player1 from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown). Action: move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown.

6. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos44 (pushtonongoal). Agent is at pos44's west neighbor (pos34 is not adjacent to pos44). Wait, pos44 is east of pos34. To push from pos34 to pos44 (dirright), the agent must be at pos34's west neighbor (pos24). But the agent is at pos44. So this isn't possible. So need to find another way.

Alternatively, agent needs to go to pos24 to push the stone east.

7. So steps after step 4: agent is at pos43.

8. Move to pos33 (dirleft).

9. Move to pos23 (dirleft).

10. Move to pos24 (dirdown).

11. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos44 (dirright). Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright.

Now, stone is at pos44. Agent is at pos34.

12. Now, need to push stone1 from pos44 to pos54 (dirright). Action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright.

After this, stone is at pos54 (goal). Agent is at pos44.

But we need to check constraints:

- stone1 must be at pos53 at least once. This plan doesn't achieve that. So invalid.

So need to adjust.

Alternative approach: after moving stone to pos34, push it to pos44, then to pos54. But we need to detour to pos53.

Let's try:

After step 2 (stone at pos34):

3. Move agent from pos33 to pos43 (dirright).

4. Move agent from pos43 to pos53 (dirright).

But pos43 to pos53 is allowed via dirright. Action: move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright.

5. Now, agent is at pos53. Push stone from pos34 to pos44 (requires agent to be at pos34's adjacent cell). Not possible. Alternatively, agent needs to push the stone from pos44 to pos54, but how?

This isn't working. Alternative idea: after step 2, stone is at pos34. Agent at pos33.

3. Move agent from pos33 to pos43 (dirright).

4. Push stone from pos34 to pos44. To do this, agent needs to be at pos34's west neighbor (pos24). So agent needs to move to pos24.

5. Move agent from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown).

6. Move agent from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft). Can't because pos34 has stone.

7. So instead, move agent from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft).

8. Move agent from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft).

9. Move agent from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown).

10. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos44 (dirright). Now, stone at pos44. Agent at pos34.

11. Move agent from pos34 to pos44 (dirright). Can't, pos44 has stone.

12. So agent moves to pos44's south neighbor pos54. Wait, pos44's dirdown is pos45. So agent can't.

Alternatively, from pos34, move to pos44 (dirright) if clear. But pos44 has the stone. So no.

This is getting too complicated. Perhaps a better approach is to find a plan that moves the stone to pos53, then to pos54, while satisfying all constraints.

Let me try again:

1. Move player1 from pos31 to pos32 (dirdown).

2. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown). Agent now at pos33.

3. Move agent from pos33 to pos43 (dirright).

4. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos44 (dirright). But agent is at pos43, stone at pos34. To push from pos34 to pos44, agent must be at pos34's west (pos24) or other adjacent cell. So agent needs to move to pos24.

5. Agent moves from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft).

6. Agent moves from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft).

7. Agent moves from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown).

8. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos44 (dirright). Now, stone at pos44, agent at pos34.

9. Move agent from pos34 to pos44 (dirright). Can't.

10. Agent moves from pos34 to pos44 (dirright) if possible. But stone is there.

So instead, agent at pos34 can push stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirright).

11. Push stone1 from pos44 to pos54 (dirright). This is pushtogoal. Agent must be at pos44's west neighbor (pos34). Action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright.

Now, stone is at pos54 (goal), agent at pos44.

But we need to have stone1 at pos53. So perhaps after step 8, stone is at pos44. Then:

9. Move agent from pos34 to pos44 (dirright) can't. So agent needs to go around.

Alternative idea: after step 3 (agent at pos43), push stone from pos34 to pos44 (but how?).

Perhaps:

After step 3 (agent at pos43):

4. Move agent to pos44 (dirdown).

5. Push stone from pos34 to pos44 (requires agent to be west of pos34). Not possible.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given the time, perhaps I should write the step-by-step plan that satisfies all constraints, even if it's longer.

Final plan:

1. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown

2. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown

3. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright

4. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirleft

6. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft

7. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft

8. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft

9. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown

10. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright

11. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright

12. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright

But this may not be optimal. But given the constraints, I think the correct plan involves moving the stone to pos53 first, then to pos54, and ensuring the agent visits the required locations and the constraints are met.

After several attempts, the optimal plan is likely:

```
move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown
move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos34 pos44 dirdown
move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos44 pos54 dirright
```

But this is incorrect because pushing from pos44 to pos54 requires the stone to be at pos44. Let's correct it.

Another approach:

```
move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown
move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown (invalid)
```

No, can't move into stone.

Alternative:

```
1. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown
2. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown
3. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos34 pos44 dirdown
5. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
6. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos44 pos54 dirright (invalid, stone not at pos44)
```

Instead, after step 4, stone is at pos44. Agent is at pos34.

Step 5: move agent from pos34 to pos44 (dirright) - but stone is there. Can't.

So need to push again.

Step 5: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright.

This requires that the agent is at pos34, stone at pos44, and pos54 is clear. This is valid.

So:

```
1. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown
2. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown
3. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
4. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos44 dirdown (invalid)
```

No, stone is at pos34, not pos44. So step 4 is invalid.

This is taking too long. Given the constraints, the correct plan is:

```
move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown
move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos34 pos44 dirdown
move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos44 pos54 dirright
```

But this is not valid because the stone is at pos34 in step 4, not pos44. So the correct steps are:

1. move to pos32.

2. push stone to pos34.

3. move to pos43.

4. push stone from pos34 to pos44 (agent must be at pos34's adjacent cell).

To push from pos34 to pos44 (dirright), agent must be at pos34's west neighbor (pos24). So:

After step 2, agent is at pos33.

3. move to pos23 (dirleft).

4. move to pos24 (dirdown).

5. push stone from pos34 to pos44 (dirright).

6. move to pos34 (dirright).

7. push stone to pos54 (dirright).

But this requires:

```
1. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown
2. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown
3. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
4. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright
6. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
7. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright
```

This plan satisfies:

- stone is at pos54 (goal).

- agent is at pos23 (step 3).

- Before step 3, stone is at pos34, not pos35 or pos54 not clear. So violates the constraint that if agent is at pos23, then before that, stone is at pos35 or pos54 not clear.

So this plan is invalid.

Thus, the correct plan must involve getting stone to pos35 or pos54 not clear before agent is at pos23.

This is very challenging. Given the time, I think the correct answer involves the agent moving to pos23 after the stone is at pos35, which requires additional steps.

Final answer:
