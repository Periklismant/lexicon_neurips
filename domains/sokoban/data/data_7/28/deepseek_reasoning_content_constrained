Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. First, I need to understand the initial state and the goal. The agent (player1) starts at pos41, and the stone (stone1) is at pos32. The goal is to have stone1 at a goal location. The only goal location mentioned is pos51. Wait, the original state says pos51 is a goal location, and others like pos52-55 are not. So the stone needs to be moved to pos51.

But there are constraints to satisfy. Let me list them out:

1. At least one state where pos21 is not clear.
2. If pos21 is not clear in some state, there must be an earlier state where pos53 is not clear or player1 is at pos51.
3. At least one state where player1 is at pos54 or pos55 is not clear.
4. pos42 being not clear can only hold in at most one continuous sequence. So maybe only once or not overlapping with another occurrence.
5. Player1 must never be at pos42 in any state.
6. pos43 must always be clear.
7. At least one state where pos25 is not clear.
8. At least one state where pos51 is not clear.
9. If pos51 is not clear in a state, then player1 must be at pos53 either at that state or a later one.

Hmm, okay. Let's start by figuring out the main path: moving the stone from pos32 to pos51. Let's see the possible paths.

The stone is at pos32. To get to pos51, which is on the top right corner (assuming pos51 is row 5, column1?), wait, the locations are labeled pos11 to pos55, where first digit is row and second is column. So pos51 is row 5, column1. But movement directions: from pos41, moving right would go to pos51? Looking at the movement rules:

- "You may move from location pos41 to location pos51 following direction dirright". So pos41 is row4, column1, right to pos51 (row5, column1). Wait, but that's possible. So the grid is arranged such that moving right from pos41 (row4, col1) takes you to pos51 (row5, col1)? Wait, maybe the rows are vertical. Let me check the movement directions again. For example, moving from pos11 to pos21 is direction dirright, which would mean that pos11 is column1, row1, and pos21 is column2, row1. Wait, but the movement from pos11 to pos21 is dirright, which suggests that direction right increases the column. So pos11 is (1,1), pos12 is (1,2), etc. Then moving right from pos11 (1,1) would go to pos21 (2,1)? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the first digit is the row and the second the column. So pos11 is row1, column1. Then moving right would increase the column. So from pos11, moving right would go to pos12. But the given movement from pos11 says "You may move from pos11 to pos21 following direction dirright". Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, maybe the movement directions are different. Let me re-examine the movement rules.

For example, "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright". So moving from pos11 to pos21 is right. That suggests that moving right from pos11 (row1, column1) takes you to pos21 (row2, column1). So perhaps the rows are vertical, and moving right changes the row? That seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the directions are named differently. Let me check another example. For instance, "You may move from location pos11 to pos12 following direction dirdown". So pos11 to pos12 is down. So if pos11 is (1,1), then pos12 would be (2,1), but that's direction down. But then moving right from pos11 to pos21 would be row-wise. This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe the grid is arranged such that pos11 is the top-left corner, pos15 is top-right, pos51 is bottom-left, pos55 is bottom-right. Then directions: dirright would be moving to the next column (right), dirleft to previous column (left), dirdown to next row (down), dirup to previous row (up). Wait, but the movement from pos11 to pos21 is dirright. If pos11 is (row1, column1), then pos21 would be (row2, column1). So moving dirright would be increasing the row? That would make direction right equivalent to moving down a row. That's possible but perhaps the naming is counterintuitive. Alternatively, maybe the movement directions are mislabeled. Let's look at another movement: pos11 can move to pos21 (dirright) and pos12 (dirdown). So perhaps dirright is moving down a row, and dirdown is moving right a column. That would make sense if the grid is arranged with rows as vertical and columns as horizontal. For example, pos11 (row1, column1), moving right (dirright) would take you to pos21 (row2, column1). Moving dirdown from pos11 would take you to pos12 (row1, column2). So, in this case, directions are as follows: dirright is down (row+1), dirleft is up (row-1), dirdown is right (column+1), dirup is left (column-1). That seems counterintuitive, but perhaps that's how it's defined here.

So, given that, let's map out the positions. For example, pos32 is row3, column2. The agent starts at pos41 (row4, column1). The stone is at pos32 (row3, column2). The goal is pos51 (row5, column1). So the stone needs to go from row3, column2 to row5, column1. Let's see the path.

To push the stone to pos51, the agent needs to get behind the stone (in the direction opposite to where it's being pushed). For example, to push the stone from pos32 to pos42 (dirright, which would be row+1), the agent would need to be at pos32 and push it down (dirright). Wait, but the movement direction from pos32 to pos42 is dirright. Wait, according to the movement rules, from pos32 you can move to pos42 via direction dirright. So pos32 (row3, column2) to pos42 (row4, column2) via dirright. So pushing the stone from pos32 to pos42 (dirright) would require the agent to be at pos32, but wait, the stone is at pos32. Wait, the agent can't be on the same position as the stone. So the agent needs to be adjacent to the stone to push it.

Wait, the preconditions for push actions: for example, pushtogoal requires the agent to be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's current location) in direction d. Then the agent pushes the stone from l_from to l_to, which is in the same direction d. So, for example, if the stone is at pos32, and the agent is at pos22 (which is north of pos32), then pushing the stone south (dirright?) would move the stone to pos42, and the agent would move to pos32.

But according to the movement directions, from pos22 to pos32 is dirright. So if the agent is at pos22, they can move to pos32 via dirright. So pushing the stone from pos32 (current location) to pos42 (dirright direction) would require the agent to be at pos32's 'dirright' direction's opposite. Wait, no. The 'pushtogoal' action requires that the agent is at l_p, which must be adjacent to l_from (the stone's position) in direction d. Wait, the preconditions for pushtogoal are:

(iv) you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d.

So the agent is at l_p, and l_from is in direction d from l_p. Then, when pushing, the stone moves from l_from to l_to, which is in direction d from l_from.

So for example, if the agent is at l_p = pos22, direction d is dirright (which from pos22, dirright leads to pos32). So the agent is at pos22, stone is at pos32 (l_from). Then pushing the stone dirright from pos32 would take it to pos42 (since from pos32, dirright is pos42). So the action would be pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright. But pos42 must be a goal location? Wait, no. pos42 is not a goal; pos51 is the only goal. So that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe pushing the stone to pos51 requires moving it through different positions.

Wait, pos51 is a goal location, so the stone needs to end up there. Let's plan the path for the stone: pos32 → pos42 → pos52 → pos51? But pos52 is not a goal, but pos51 is. Wait, but how can the stone get to pos51? Let's see the movement possibilities.

From pos51, the agent can move to pos41 (dirleft) or pos52 (dirdown). So pos51 is connected to pos41 (left) and pos52 (down). So to get the stone to pos51, maybe the agent can push it from pos52 to pos51, moving left. So the agent would need to be at pos52 to push the stone left into pos51. But how does the stone get to pos52?

Alternatively, the stone could be pushed from pos42 to pos52, then to pos51. Let's see:

Stone at pos32. Agent moves to pos22, then pushes the stone to pos42. Then agent moves around to push it from pos42 to pos52, then to pos51.

But let's check the movement paths. From pos32, the possible directions are:

- You may move from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft), pos42 (dirright), pos31 (dirup), pos33 (dirdown).

Wait, according to the movement rules, from pos32:

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos32 to location pos31 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown"

So dirleft from pos32 is to pos22 (row2, column2), dirright to pos42 (row4, column2), dirup to pos31 (row3, column1), dirdown to pos33 (row3, column3). Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe the directions are as follows:

- dirleft: decrease row by 1?
- dirright: increase row by 1?
- dirup: decrease column by 1?
- dirdown: increase column by 1?

Because moving from pos32 (row3, column2) to pos22 (row2, column2) via dirleft. So dirleft is row-1. Similarly, dirright is row+1 (to pos42, row4). Then dirup would be column-1 (pos31: row3, column1), and dirdown column+1 (pos33: row3, column3). So direction left/right affects the row, up/down affects the column. That's an unusual grid setup, but okay.

So, to move the stone from pos32 (row3, column2) to pos51 (row5, column1), which is a goal location. The stone's path would need to go from row3, column2 → row4, column2 (pos42) → row5, column2 (pos52) → row5, column1 (pos51). But pos51 is row5, column1. So to get from pos52 (row5, column2) to pos51 (row5, column1), the direction would be dirup (column-1). So the agent would need to be at pos52, column3 (pos53) to push the stone left (dirup) to pos52 → pos51. Wait, no. If the stone is at pos52 (row5, column2), to push it to pos51 (row5, column1), the direction would be dirup (since column decreases by 1). So the agent needs to be at pos52's dirup direction, which is pos52's column+1? Wait, no. The agent needs to be in a position that allows them to push the stone in the desired direction. For the stone at pos52, to push it dirup (column-1) to pos51, the agent must be at pos52's dirdown direction (column+1), which is pos53. Because to push the stone dirup, the agent needs to be behind it in the opposite direction. So the agent would be at pos53 (row5, column3), push the stone from pos52 to pos51 (dirup). But how does the agent get to pos53?

But the initial position of the agent is pos41 (row4, column1). Let's outline a possible plan:

1. Move agent from pos41 to pos31 (dirleft), then to pos32 (dirdown). Wait, but the stone is at pos32. The agent can't be there. So maybe the agent needs to approach from a different direction.

Wait, the stone is at pos32. The agent is at pos41. To push the stone, the agent needs to get adjacent to it. Let's see possible paths.

From pos41, the agent can move dirright to pos51, or dirdown to pos42. But moving to pos42 is prohibited because constraint 5 says player1 must never be at pos42. So the agent can't go to pos42. So they must take another route.

Alternative path: agent moves from pos41 to pos31 (dirleft). From pos31, can move to pos21 (dirleft), pos41 (dirright?), or pos32 (dirdown). Wait, movement from pos31:

"You may move from location pos31 to location pos21 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos31 to location pos41 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos31 to location pos32 following direction dirdown"

So from pos31, dirdown takes the agent to pos32. But pos32 has the stone, which is clear in the initial state. Wait, initial state says "Location pos32 is clear". Wait, the stone is at pos32, so how is pos32 clear? Wait, no. The initial state says "stone1 is at location pos32" and "Location pos32 is clear". That's a contradiction. Wait, looking back:

Original state includes:

"stone1 is at location pos32"

And under the list of clear locations:

"Location pos31 is clear"

"Location pos33 is clear"

But "Location pos32 is clear" is also listed. Wait, that's impossible. If the stone is at pos32, then pos32 is not clear. But the original state says:

"stone1 is at location pos32"

And also "Location pos32 is clear". That's conflicting. Is this a mistake in the problem statement? Because if a stone is at pos32, then pos32 is not clear. But according to the problem statement, in the original state, "Location pos32 is clear" is listed. That must be an error. But perhaps I need to proceed assuming that the problem statement is correct. Maybe the stone is at pos32, but the location is considered clear? That doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps "clear" means that there's no agent or stone. But the problem says "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So if a stone is at pos32, then pos32 is not clear. So the problem statement has a contradiction here. But perhaps the user made a mistake. Let's check again.

Looking back:

The original state includes:

"stone1 is at location pos32"

And in the list of clear locations:

"Location pos32 is clear"

This is conflicting. That must be a mistake. But since I have to work with the given information, perhaps the stone is at pos32, but pos32 is considered clear. That's impossible under normal logic, but perhaps in this problem's context, "clear" refers to the agent not being there. Wait, the problem statement says:

"Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty."

So a location is clear if it's empty. So if a stone is there, it's not clear. So the initial state has a contradiction. But since the problem says "Location pos32 is clear" and "stone1 is at location pos32", this must be an error. However, the user provided this as part of the problem, so maybe I have to proceed with that. Alternatively, perhaps the "clear" list is only for agent presence. Wait, the problem says:

"Location posXY is clear" means that the location is empty (no agent or stone). So if a stone is there, it's not clear. Therefore, the initial state is invalid. But this is part of the problem given, so perhaps it's a typo. Maybe the stone is actually at pos33, but the problem says pos32. Alternatively, maybe the clear list is incorrect. But given that the user provided this, I have to work with it. Alternatively, maybe the stone is at pos32, but the clear list is a mistake. But perhaps the correct initial state has the stone at pos32, and pos32 is not clear. But according to the problem, in the original state, "Location pos32 is clear" is stated. So this is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem statement, but I have to proceed as if the initial state is correct. If pos32 has the stone and is also clear, then that's a problem. But maybe "clear" refers to the agent not being present. Wait, the problem says:

"Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty."

So a location can have the agent, a stone, or be empty. Therefore, "clear" would mean empty. So if a stone is at pos32, pos32 is not clear. Therefore, the initial state as described is impossible. This is a problem. However, since this is the given problem, I must assume that there's a mistake, but proceed with the information as given. Maybe the stone is at pos32, and pos32 is not clear, but the problem mistakenly lists it as clear. Or perhaps the stone is at a different location. Let me check again.

Looking back:

Original state:

"stone1 is at location pos32"

"Location pos32 is clear"

This is conflicting. Therefore, this is likely an error in the problem statement. However, since I need to solve this, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the stone is at pos32, and pos32 is not clear (despite the problem's contradictory statement). Because otherwise, the problem is unsolvable. Alternatively, maybe "Location pos32 is clear" refers to the agent not being there. But the problem's definition says a location is clear if it's empty, i.e., no agent or stone. Therefore, this is a contradiction. However, I'll proceed assuming that the stone is at pos32, and the "Location pos32 is clear" is an error, and pos32 is not clear. Otherwise, the stone can't be moved because it's not there.

Proceeding under that assumption, the stone is at pos32 (which is not clear), and the agent is at pos41.

The agent needs to move to pos32 to push the stone. But pos32 is not clear (since the stone is there). Wait, no, the agent can't be on the same location as the stone. So the agent must be adjacent to the stone to push it.

So, for the agent to push the stone from pos32, the agent must be in an adjacent location. Let's look at the possible adjacent locations to pos32. From pos32's movement options:

- pos22 (dirleft, row2)
- pos42 (dirright, row4)
- pos31 (dirup, column1)
- pos33 (dirdown, column3)

So the agent can approach from pos22, pos42, pos31, or pos33. But the agent starts at pos41. Let's plan the path.

Agent's initial position: pos41. They need to reach a position adjacent to pos32. Let's see possible paths.

From pos41, possible moves:

- dirleft to pos31 (since "You may move from pos41 to pos31 following direction dirleft")
- dirright to pos51 (direction dirright)
- dirdown to pos42 (but pos42 is prohibited because constraint 5 says player1 can't be at pos42 in any state)

So the agent can't go to pos42. So possible moves from pos41 are to pos31 or pos51.

If the agent moves to pos31 (dirleft from pos41), then from pos31, they can move to pos21 (dirleft), pos41 (dirright), or pos32 (dirdown). Wait, pos32 is where the stone is. So from pos31, moving dirdown (which increases the column by 1) to pos32. But pos32 has the stone, which is not clear. So the agent can't move there. Therefore, the agent can't go to pos32 directly. So the agent needs to approach the stone from another direction.

Alternatively, the agent could go to pos51 (dirright from pos41), but pos51 is a goal location. But the agent can move there. From pos51, the agent can move to pos41 (dirleft) or pos52 (dirdown). But getting to pos51 might help in some way.

Wait, but the stone is at pos32. The agent needs to push it to pos51. So maybe the agent needs to go around to the other side.

Alternatively, the agent could go from pos41 → pos31 → pos21 → pos22 → pos32 (but pos32 is occupied by the stone). Wait, but that's not possible. The agent needs to be adjacent to the stone to push it.

Let me think differently. The agent needs to get to a position adjacent to pos32, such as pos22, pos42, pos31, or pos33.

But the agent starts at pos41. Let's see:

From pos41, move dirleft to pos31. Then from pos31, move dirdown to pos32? But pos32 has the stone. So no, can't move there. So from pos31, can the agent move to pos21, then to pos22, then to pos32?

Wait, pos21 is row2, column1. From pos21, can the agent move to pos22 (dirdown, which would increase column to 2). So pos22 is row2, column2. From pos22, moving dirright (row3) to pos32. So agent moves from pos22 to pos32 via dirright. But pos32 has the stone, so the agent can't move there. Therefore, the agent can't get to pos22 and then to pos32.

Alternatively, the agent could go from pos41 to pos51 (dirright). From pos51, move dirdown to pos52. Then from pos52, move dirdown to pos53, and so on. But this path may not help in pushing the stone.

Alternatively, the agent needs to get to pos42 to push the stone. But constraint 5 says the agent can never be at pos42. So that's not allowed.

Hmm, this is a problem. The agent can't go to pos42. So the only adjacent positions to pos32 that are accessible are pos22, pos31, pos33. But the agent can't reach those easily.

Wait, let's check the movement from pos31. From pos31, the agent can move to pos21 (dirleft), which is row2, column1. Then from pos21, move dirdown to pos22 (row2, column2). Then from pos22, move dirright to pos32 (row3, column2). But again, pos32 has the stone, so the agent can't move there. However, the agent can be at pos22 and push the stone from pos32 (since pos32 is adjacent to pos22 via dirright direction). Wait, the agent is at pos22. The stone is at pos32. The direction from pos22 to pos32 is dirright. So the agent can push the stone from pos32 to pos42 (dirright), as per the pushtogoal or pushtonongoal action.

But pos42 is a non-goal location, so if we push the stone there, we'd need to use pushtonongoal. But the goal is to get the stone to pos51. So perhaps pushing the stone to pos42, then to pos52, then to pos51.

But the agent can't be at pos42 due to constraint 5. So when pushing the stone from pos32 to pos42, the agent would end up at pos32. Let's see:

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright.

After this action, the agent moves from pos22 to pos32, and the stone moves from pos32 to pos42. But pos42 is prohibited for the agent to be in any state. Wait, no: the constraint says "player1 is not at location pos42" in every state. After pushing, the agent is at pos32. That's allowed. So the agent is at pos32, and the stone is at pos42. Then the agent can push the stone further.

From pos42, the stone can be pushed dirright to pos52 (since from pos42, dirright is pos52. Let's check the movement from pos42: "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos42 to location pos52 following direction dirright", etc. So pushing the stone from pos42 to pos52 (dirright) would require the agent to be at pos42's dirleft, which is pos32. But the agent is at pos32 after the first push. So the agent can then push the stone from pos42 to pos52.

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos52 dirright.

After this, the agent moves to pos42, but that's prohibited. Wait, no: the action's effect is that the agent moves from pos32 (l_p) to pos42's previous position, which is pos42's l_from. Wait, the action is pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d. The preconditions are:

- agent is at l_p (pos32)
- stone is at l_from (pos42)
- l_to is clear (pos52)
- can get from l_p (pos32) to l_from (pos42) following d (dirright). Wait, from pos32 to pos42 is dirright (row+1). So yes.

After this action, the agent moves from pos32 to pos42 (since l_p is pos32, l_from is pos42, and after the action, the agent is at l_from (pos42)). But this would place the agent at pos42, which violates constraint 5 (player1 must never be at pos42). Therefore, this action is invalid.

So this approach is not possible. Therefore, the agent cannot push the stone from pos42 to pos52 because it would require the agent to be at pos42, which is prohibited.

Alternative approach: Find another path to move the stone.

Perhaps push the stone from pos32 to pos33, then to pos43, but pos43 must always be clear (constraint 6). So the stone can't be at pos43. So that's not allowed.

Alternatively, push the stone from pos32 to pos31 (dirup direction). The agent would need to be at pos32's dirup direction's opposite. Wait, to push the stone dirup (column-1) from pos32 to pos31, the agent must be at pos32's dirdown direction (column+1), which is pos33. So the agent needs to be at pos33 to push the stone dirup to pos31.

But how to get the agent to pos33? From pos41, the agent can go to pos31 (dirleft), then to pos32 (dirdown) but can't because it's occupied by the stone. Alternatively, pos31 → pos21 → pos22 → pos23 → pos33.

But this seems long. Let's see:

Agent path:

1. pos41 → pos31 (dirleft)
2. pos31 → pos21 (dirleft)
3. pos21 → pos22 (dirdown)
4. pos22 → pos23 (dirdown)
5. pos23 → pos33 (dirright)

But pos33 is clear initially. Once at pos33, the agent can push the stone from pos32 to pos31 (dirup) if the stone is still there. But the stone is at pos32 initially. Wait, but to push it to pos31, the agent needs to be at pos33 (l_p) and push in direction dirup. But pos32 is l_from, and l_to is pos31. So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirup.

After this, the stone is at pos31, and the agent is at pos32. But pos31 is not a goal. Then, the agent can move to pos32 → pos42 (dirright), but pos42 is prohibited. So this seems not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft). To do that, the agent must be at pos32's dirright direction, which is pos42. But the agent can't go to pos42. So this is not possible.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's consider the constraints again.

Constraints:

1. pos21 must be not clear in at least one state. So either the agent or the stone must be at pos21 at some point.

2. If pos21 is not clear, then earlier in the plan, pos53 is not clear or agent is at pos51.

3. At least one state where agent is at pos54 or pos55 is not clear.

4. pos42 not clear can happen at most once in a continuous sequence.

5. Agent is never at pos42.

6. pos43 is always clear.

7. pos25 must be not clear in at least one state.

8. pos51 must be not clear in at least one state (which will happen when the stone is there).

9. If pos51 is not clear (stone is there), then agent must be at pos53 either then or later.

So the plan must include steps that satisfy these constraints.

Let's try to plan the main goal first: moving the stone to pos51.

Possible path:

pos32 → pos42 → pos52 → pos51.

But pushing to pos42 is problematic because the agent would end up at pos42, which is prohibited. So alternative path.

Another approach: agent moves to pos51 first, then somehow get the stone there.

But how? The agent is at pos51. To push the stone into pos51, the stone needs to be at pos52, and the agent at pos53, pushing dirup (column-1) to pos51. But the stone is at pos32. How to get it to pos52?

Alternative plan:

1. Move agent from pos41 to pos51 (dirright). Now agent is at pos51. This satisfies the constraint that pos51 is not clear (since agent is there) at some state (action 1).

But the stone is still at pos32. Then, the agent needs to move back to push the stone. But this may take many steps.

Another idea: use the pushtogoal action when possible. For example, when the stone is at pos52, pushing it to pos51 (goal) using pushtogoal.

But to get the stone to pos52, the agent needs to push it from pos42 to pos52, but again, pos42 is problematic.

Wait, perhaps the agent can take a different route. Let's think:

From pos41, agent moves to pos51 (action: move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright). Now pos51 is not clear (satisfying constraint 8). Then, according to constraint 9, the agent must be at pos53 either in this state or later. So after moving to pos51, the agent needs to eventually reach pos53.

But how to push the stone from pos32 to pos51. Let's consider that the agent is at pos51. To reach the stone, the agent may need to move down to pos52, then pos53, etc., but this may take a long time.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can move from pos51 to pos52 (dirdown), then to pos53 (dirdown), and then to pos43 (dirleft), but pos43 must remain clear. So that's not allowed.

This is getting quite complex. Let's try to outline a possible plan step by step, considering the constraints.

Step 1: Move agent from pos41 to pos51 (dirright). This action is allowed because pos51 is clear. Now, agent is at pos51. This makes pos51 not clear (satisfies constraint 8). Now, according to constraint 9, the agent must be at pos53 at this state or later. Since the agent is at pos51 now, they need to get to pos53 later.

Step 2: Agent moves from pos51 to pos52 (dirdown). Now, agent is at pos52. This is allowed, but need to check constraints. pos52 is not a goal.

Step 3: Agent moves from pos52 to pos53 (dirdown). Now at pos53. This satisfies part of constraint 3 if agent is at pos54 or pos55 not clear. Not yet.

Step 4: Agent moves from pos53 to pos54 (dirdown). Now at pos54. This satisfies constraint 3 (agent is at pos54).

Now, the agent is at pos54. But how does this help in moving the stone? Maybe the agent can now move towards the stone.

But the stone is at pos32. The agent is at pos54. This is far. Alternative path: agent needs to get back towards pos32.

But this seems inefficient. Let's think differently.

Another approach: The agent needs to make pos21 not clear. To do that, either the agent or the stone must be at pos21. But the stone is at pos32 initially. How to get it to pos21. That would require pushing it up (dirleft) from pos32 to pos22, then to pos21. But pushing to pos21 requires the agent to be at pos11, which is far away.

Alternatively, the agent can move to pos21 and be there, making pos21 not clear. But how?

From pos41, the agent can move to pos31 (dirleft), then to pos21 (dirleft). Then agent is at pos21. This satisfies constraint 1 (pos21 not clear). But according to constraint 2, this requires that earlier in the plan, pos53 was not clear or agent was at pos51. But in this case, the agent hasn't been to pos51 or pos53 yet. So this would violate constraint 2.

So to satisfy constraint 2, if we make pos21 not clear by having the agent there, we need to have either pos53 not clear or agent at pos51 before that.

So perhaps, first move agent to pos51 (satisfying constraint 8 and part of 9), then move to pos21 via a long path.

But this is getting too long. Let's think of a plan that satisfies all constraints:

Possible steps:

1. Move agent from pos41 to pos51 (dirright). Now pos51 is not clear (satisfies constraint 8). Also, agent is at pos51, which may help with constraint 2.

2. Now, according to constraint 9, since pos51 is not clear (agent is there), the agent must be at pos53 eventually. So after this, agent needs to go to pos53.

3. Agent moves from pos51 to pos52 (dirdown), then to pos53 (dirdown). Now at pos53. This satisfies part of constraint 3 if we later have agent at pos54.

4. Agent moves from pos53 to pos54 (dirdown). Now at pos54 (satisfies constraint 3).

Now, we need to get the stone to pos51. The stone is at pos32. How to push it there.

From pos54, the agent can move dirleft to pos44, then to pos34, etc. But this is a long path. Alternatively, perhaps after step 1, the agent is at pos51, then moves back to pos41, then to pos31, then to pos21 (to make pos21 not clear, satisfying constraint 1). But then constraint 2 requires that before pos21 is not clear, pos53 is not clear or agent was at pos51. Since agent was at pos51 in step 1, that satisfies constraint 2.

So:

1. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright → pos51 not clear (constraint 8)

2. move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft → back to pos41.

3. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft → pos31.

4. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft → pos21 (now pos21 is not clear, satisfying constraint 1). Since in step 1, agent was at pos51, this satisfies constraint 2 (earlier state where agent was at pos51).

Now, with agent at pos21, which is not clear, but we need to proceed to push the stone.

From pos21, agent can move to pos22 (dirdown). Then to pos32 (dirright), but pos32 has the stone. So agent can't move there. Instead, from pos22, agent can push the stone from pos32 to pos42 (dirright). But agent is at pos22, so action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright. This pushes the stone to pos42, and agent moves to pos32. But pos42 is not a goal, so we use pushtonongoal.

But after this action, the stone is at pos42, and the agent is at pos32. However, pos42 must not have the agent (constraint 5), which is satisfied. But the stone being at pos42 would make pos42 not clear. This must happen in at most one continuous sequence (constraint 4). So we need to ensure that pos42 is not clear only once and not again later.

But pushing the stone to pos42 would make pos42 not clear. Then, pushing it further to pos52 would require pos42 to be clear again (since the agent moves to pos42 after pushing from pos32 to pos42, but wait: no. The action pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright would have the agent move from pos22 to pos32, and the stone from pos32 to pos42. So after this action, the agent is at pos32, and the stone is at pos42. pos42 is not clear (stone is there), and pos32 is now occupied by the agent. So pos42 is not clear in this state. Then, to push the stone from pos42 to pos52, the agent needs to be at pos42's dirright direction's opposite. Wait, to push the stone from pos42 to pos52 (dirright), the agent needs to be at pos42's dirleft, which is pos32. So the agent is at pos32, and the stone is at pos42. So the agent can perform pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos52 dirright. This would move the stone to pos52, and the agent to pos42. But pos42 is prohibited for the agent to be there (constraint 5). So this action is invalid.

Therefore, pushing the stone from pos42 to pos52 is not possible because it would require the agent to be at pos42. So this approach fails.

Alternative idea: after pushing the stone to pos42, the agent is at pos32. Then, the agent can move to pos33 (dirdown from pos32). From pos33, the agent can push the stone from pos42 to pos43 (dirright?), but pos43 must remain clear (constraint 6). So that's not allowed.

Alternatively, from pos32, the agent can move to pos31 (dirup), then pos41, etc., but that doesn't help.

This is getting really tricky. Let's consider another approach.

Maybe the stone can be pushed from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown), then to pos43 (dirright), but pos43 must remain clear. So that's not allowed.

Alternatively, push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft). To do this, the agent must be at pos32's dirright (pos42) to push it dirleft, but pos42 is prohibited. No.

Alternatively, push the stone from pos32 to pos31 (dirup). To do this, the agent must be at pos33 (dirdown direction from pos32). So agent moves to pos33, then pushes the stone dirup to pos31.

But how to get the agent to pos33.

Agent's path after step 4 (at pos54):

5. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft.

6. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft.

7. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft.

8. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft.

9. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirdown.

But this seems like a long detour. Not sure.

Alternative plan with constraints in mind:

Need to have pos25 not clear at least once. So the agent or stone must be at pos25.

Maybe the agent can visit pos25, but that's far from the current path.

Alternatively, the stone can be pushed there. But that would require moving the stone to pos25, which is not a goal, so it's not helpful.

But the main goal is to have the stone at pos51. So perhaps the stone's path must include passing through pos25? Unlikely.

Another approach: Let's look for a path that satisfies all constraints while moving the stone to pos51.

Constraint 3 requires agent at pos54 or pos55 not clear. So maybe at the end, after moving the stone to pos51, the agent goes to pos54.

Constraint 7 requires pos25 not clear. So maybe the agent moves to pos25 at some point.

But how.

Perhaps the agent moves from pos21 to pos22 → pos23 → pos24 → pos25. Making pos25 not clear.

But this would require the agent to be at pos25, satisfying constraint 7.

So integrating this into the plan:

After step 4 (agent at pos21):

5. move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown.

6. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown.

7. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown.

8. move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown. Now pos25 is not clear (satisfies constraint 7).

Now, the agent is at pos25. But how to proceed to push the stone.

This is getting too long. Maybe there's a more optimal path.

Alternative idea: The stone needs to be at pos51. The agent can push it there directly from pos52, but how to get the stone to pos52.

Maybe the agent can push the stone from pos32 to pos42 (even though pos42 is problematic), but then find a way to push it further without the agent being at pos42.

But earlier attempt showed that pushing from pos42 requires the agent to be at pos42, which is not allowed.

Wait, wait. Let's re-examine the pushtonongoal action's effects. When the agent pushes a stone from l_from to l_to, the agent moves from l_p to l_from, and the stone moves to l_to. So the agent ends up at l_from, not l_to.

So, for example, if the agent is at pos22 (l_p), pushes the stone from pos32 (l_from) to pos42 (l_to) with dirright. After the action, the agent is at pos32, and the stone is at pos42. So the agent is at pos32, which is allowed. pos42 is now occupied by the stone, which is allowed as long as the agent is not there.

So, in this case, after pushing from pos32 to pos42, the agent is at pos32, and the stone is at pos42. Then, to push the stone from pos42 to pos52, the agent needs to be at pos42's dirright direction's opposite. Wait, to push the stone dirright from pos42 to pos52, the agent must be at pos42's dirleft (pos32). So the agent is already at pos32. So the next action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos52 dirright. After this, the agent moves to pos42 (which is prohibited), so this action is invalid.

Thus, this approach won't work.

Alternative idea: After pushing the stone to pos42, the agent is at pos32. Then, the agent moves away from pos32 to pos31, then to pos41, then to pos51, and then to pos52, pos53, etc., to push the stone from pos42 to pos52. But how?

Wait, the agent is at pos32. Can they move to pos31 (dirup). Yes. Then from pos31, to pos41 (dirright). Then to pos51 (dirright). Then to pos52 (dirdown). Then to pos53 (dirdown). Now, from pos53, the agent can push the stone from pos42 to pos52. But pos42 is row4, column2. The agent is at pos53 (row5, column3). To reach pos42, the agent would need to move left (dirup) to pos43, but pos43 must remain clear (constraint 6). So the agent can't be there. Therefore, this path is blocked.

This is extremely challenging. Perhaps there's another way to move the stone.

Let's think of the stone's path again: pos32 → pos33 → pos43 → pos53 → pos54 → pos55. But pos43 must remain clear, so the stone can't be there. So this is invalid.

Alternative path: pos32 → pos22 → pos23 → pos24 → pos25 → pos35 → pos45 → pos55 → pos54 → pos53 → pos52 → pos51. But this is very long and may not be optimal.

But considering the constraints, we need to have pos25 not clear at some point. So pushing the stone to pos25 would satisfy that. However, pos25 is not a goal, so the stone would need to be moved again. This complicates the plan.

Alternatively, the agent can visit pos25 themselves to satisfy constraint 7.

But the agent's path from pos21 to pos25 is possible:

Agent at pos21 → pos22 (dirdown) → pos23 (dirdown) → pos24 (dirdown) → pos25 (dirdown). Now pos25 is not clear. This satisfies constraint 7. Then, the agent can move back to pos24 → pos34 → pos44 → pos54 (satisfies constraint 3).

But how does this help with moving the stone?

This seems like a lot of steps just to satisfy constraints. Perhaps the optimal plan involves these steps.

But given the time constraints, perhaps I should outline a possible plan that meets all the requirements, even if it's long.

Here's a tentative plan:

1. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright → satisfies constraint 8 (pos51 not clear) and starts constraint 9.

2. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown.

3. move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown → now at pos53, satisfying part of constraint 9 (later steps will ensure agent is at pos53 after pos51 was not clear).

4. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown → satisfies constraint 3 (agent at pos54).

5. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft.

6. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft.

7. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft.

8. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft.

9. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirdown.

10. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirdown.

11. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirdown → now at pos22.

12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright → stone moves to pos42, agent moves to pos32. This action satisfies constraint 1 (pos21 not clear?) Wait, no. pos21 is still clear. Oh, this action doesn't involve pos21. So we need another step to make pos21 not clear.

Wait, perhaps after step 1, agent was at pos51. Then later, after step 11, agent is at pos22. From there, they can move to pos21 (dirup) to make pos21 not clear. So inserting:

11.5. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup → now pos21 not clear (satisfies constraint 1). But according to constraint 2, this requires that earlier in the plan, pos53 was not clear or agent was at pos51. Since agent was at pos51 in step 1, this satisfies constraint 2.

Then proceed to push the stone.

But this adds more steps. Let's adjust the plan:

After step 11 (agent at pos22):

12. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup → pos21 not clear (constraint 1).

13. move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown.

14. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright → stone at pos42, agent at pos32.

15. Now, the agent is at pos32. To push the stone from pos42 to pos52, the agent must be at pos42's dirleft (pos32), but they are already there. So action:

15. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos52 dirright → agent moves to pos42 (violates constraint 5). So this is invalid.

Thus, this approach fails.

Alternative idea: After pushing the stone to pos42 (step 14), the agent is at pos32. Then, the agent moves to pos31 (dirup), then to pos41, then to pos51, then to pos52, pos53. Now, from pos53, the agent can push the stone from pos52 to pos51 (dirup), using pushtogoal.

So continuing the plan:

15. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup.

16. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright.

17. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright → now at pos51 again.

18. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown.

19. move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown.

20. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos52 pos51 dirup → push the stone from pos52 to pos51 (goal location). This action's preconditions:

- agent at pos53 (yes)
- stone at pos52 (yes, if it's there)
- pos51 is clear (no, because agent was at pos51 earlier, but in step 17, agent moved to pos51, then left to pos52. So after step 17, agent is at pos51, then moves to pos52 in step 18, making pos51 clear again. So pos51 is clear when we do step 20.

Wait, let's track the stone's location:

After step 14: stone at pos42.

Steps 15-19: agent moves to pos53. The stone is still at pos42. So step 20 can't happen because the stone isn't at pos52.

Thus, this plan is invalid.

This is really challenging. I might need to start over.

Alternative approach:

Given the constraints, perhaps the optimal plan is:

1. Move agent to pos51 (satisfies constraint 8 and part of 9).

2. Move agent to pos53 (satisfies constraint 9).

3. Move agent to pos54 (satisfies constraint 3).

4. Move agent to pos21 (via a long path), making pos21 not clear (constraint 1), with earlier state at pos51 (satisfies constraint 2).

5. Push stone from pos32 to pos42, then to pos52, then to pos51.

But pushing to pos42 requires the agent to be at pos32 after the push, then moving away without going to pos42.

But how to push from pos42 to pos52 without the agent being at pos42.

Wait, after pushing the stone to pos42 (agent at pos32), then the agent can move to pos33, pos43 (but pos43 must remain clear), etc.

But this seems impossible. I'm stuck.

Perhaps the only way is to accept that the stone can't be pushed directly to pos51 and find another path.

Wait, another idea: The initial state says pos32 is clear. But the stone is there. This must be a mistake. Assuming that the stone is actually at pos33, and the clear locations are correct. But since the problem states pos32, I can't change that.

Alternatively, maybe the stone is at pos32, and pos32 is not clear, but the problem statement incorrectly lists it as clear. Proceeding under that assumption, the stone is at pos32, and pos32 is not clear.

Then, the agent can move to pos32's adjacent locations to push it.

From pos41, agent moves to pos31 (dirleft), then to pos32 (dirdown). But pos32 is not clear (stone is there). So agent can't move there. Thus, the agent must approach from another direction.

Agent moves from pos41 to pos51 (dirright), then to pos52 (dirdown), pos53 (dirdown), pos54 (dirdown), pos55 (dirdown). Now, agent is at pos55. This satisfies constraint 3 (pos55 not clear if agent is there).

But how to push the stone from here. The agent is far away. This seems not helpful.

Another idea: Use the fact that pos43 must remain clear. So the stone can't pass through there. The agent can't either.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, perhaps the optimal plan is as follows, even if it's longer:

```
move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft
move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft
move player1 pos14 pos13 dirdown
move player1 pos13 pos23 dirdown
move player1 pos23 pos22 dirdown
move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright
move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup
move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos52 dirright
```

But this is not correct. The last action tries to push from pos42 to pos52, but the agent is at pos52, which is not adjacent to pos42. This is invalid.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll try to provide a plan that satisfies the constraints, even if it's not optimal. But I need to make sure all constraints are met.

Final attempt:

1. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright → satisfies constraint 8, agent at pos51.
2. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown → agent at pos52.
3. move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown → agent at pos53 (satisfies constraint 9 as later step).
4. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown → agent at pos54 (satisfies constraint 3).
5. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft → agent at pos44.
6. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft → agent at pos34.
7. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft → agent at pos24.
8. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft → agent at pos14.
9. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirdown → agent at pos13.
10. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirdown → agent at pos23.
11. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirdown → agent at pos22.
12. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup → agent at pos21 (satisfies constraint 1, and earlier step 1 meets constraint 2).
13. move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown → agent at pos22.
14. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright → stone at pos42, agent at pos32.
15. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup → agent at pos31.
16. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright → agent at pos41.
17. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright → agent at pos51 (pos51 not clear again, but constraint 8 is already satisfied).
18. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown → agent at pos52.
19. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos52 dirright → invalid, because pos42 to pos52's direction is dirright (row+1?), but pos42 is row4, column2. dirright would be row5, column2 (pos52). So the agent needs to be at pos42's dirleft (pos32) to push dirright. But agent is at pos52, which is not adjacent. So this is invalid.

Thus, this plan doesn't work. I'm unable to find a valid plan within the time constraints. However, the correct approach would involve pushing the stone from pos32 to pos42, then to pos52, and finally to pos51, ensuring the agent never visits pos42 and satisfies all other constraints. The optimal plan would likely involve moving the agent around the constraints and using the required states to satisfy the constraints. For example, making sure pos21 is not clear by visiting it after being at pos51, and ensuring pos53 is visited after pos51 to meet constraint 9.
