Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. The only goal location mentioned is pos51. The initial state has the agent (player1) at pos53 and stone1 at pos33. Also, there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy. Let me list them out first to make sure I don't miss any.

Constraints:
1. Player must be at pos43 in at least one state.
2. If the player is at pos43 in some state, then either stone1 is at pos24 or pos24 is not clear must hold in that state or a later one.
3. pos31 must always be clear.
4. Player must be at pos52 or pos11 in at least one state.
5. pos41 must always be clear.
6. pos44 must be not clear in at least one state.
7. pos52 must be not clear in at least one state.
8. pos33 must be not clear in at least one state.
9. If pos33 is not clear, then earlier there must be pos51 or pos55 not clear.

First, let's think about moving the stone from pos33 to pos51. The path might involve pushing the stone through various positions. But we need to check the constraints as we go.

Starting position: player1 is at pos53, stone1 at pos33. Locations pos33 is initially clear? Wait, the original state says "Location pos33 is clear" but stone1 is at pos33. Wait, no—wait, the original state says "stone1 is at location pos33" and "Location pos33 is clear" — that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe a typo? Wait, no. Because "clear" probably means no agent or stone is there. But if the stone is at pos33, then pos33 should not be clear. Wait, the original state lists "Location pos33 is clear" but also says "stone1 is at location pos33". That's a contradiction. Wait, looking back:

Original state includes:
"stone1 is at location pos33"
"Location pos33 is clear"

Hmm, that must be a mistake. But according to the problem statement, we have to take the given initial state as true. So maybe "clear" here refers to being free for movement? Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Wait, maybe the "clear" in the initial state is a mistake. Because if a stone is at pos33, then pos33 shouldn't be clear. But according to the problem's initial state, pos33 is clear. That seems impossible. Wait, maybe the initial state is described in parts. Let me check again:

Looking back:

The original state includes:
"stone1 is at location pos33"
...
"Location pos33 is clear"

But that's impossible. So perhaps there's an error here. Wait, maybe the problem statement has a typo. Alternatively, maybe "clear" refers to something else. Wait, maybe "clear" means that there's no agent there. Because the agent is at pos53. So if the stone is at pos33, then pos33 is not clear (since a stone is there), but the initial state says "Location pos33 is clear". That's conflicting. So perhaps the problem statement has a mistake here. But the user expects us to work with the given initial state. So perhaps the initial state is such that even with a stone at pos33, pos33 is considered clear? That doesn't make sense. Maybe "clear" refers to the agent not being there. Wait, the effects of actions: when you move, you leave l_from clear. So "clear" probably refers to the presence of the agent. But stones are separate. So maybe "clear" means that there's no agent or stone in that location. Wait, but then if a stone is in pos33, then pos33 is not clear. But the initial state says it's clear. So this is conflicting. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement has a mistake. Let me check again. The original state says:

"stone1 is at location pos33"
"Location pos33 is clear"

This must be an error. But since the problem gives this, perhaps the "clear" here is a typo and should be "not clear". Or perhaps "Location pos33 is clear" refers to the agent not being there. But even with a stone, the location would be considered not clear. Because the "clear" probably indicates that no agent or stone is present.

Alternatively, maybe the initial state is correct, and there's a misunderstanding. Maybe "clear" refers to the absence of the agent. So stones don't block movement? But in the actions, for example, the move action requires that the destination is clear. But if a stone is there, then it's not clear, so you can't move. So if pos33 has a stone, then pos33 is not clear, which would conflict with the initial statement that pos33 is clear. Therefore, the initial state must have an error. But since this is given, perhaps we have to proceed assuming that the stone is at pos33 and the location is clear. That's contradictory. Alternatively, maybe "Location pos33 is clear" is a mistake in the problem. But since the user provided it, we have to work with it. Alternatively, maybe "clear" in the initial state refers to the agent not being there. Let's assume that "clear" in the initial state refers to the absence of the agent. Because the agent starts at pos53, which is clear. So perhaps "clear" here means the agent is not present. So the stone being at pos33 doesn't affect the "clear" status. That would make sense. So for the move action, you check if the destination is clear (i.e., no agent there), and for pushing stones, you check if the stone's location is where it is, and the destination for the stone is clear (no agent or stone there).

But the problem statement's preconditions for "move" are that (ii) location l_to is clear. So if a stone is in l_to, then it's not clear, so the move can't happen. Therefore, in the initial state, if pos33 has a stone, then pos33 is not clear. But the problem says "Location pos33 is clear". So this is conflicting. Therefore, there's a mistake in the problem statement. But perhaps the user intended that pos33 is not clear, but in the initial state, the problem says it is clear. This is a problem. But maybe the user made a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the "clear" in the initial state is for the agent, and stones don't block. That would be inconsistent with the action preconditions. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial state is correct, and the stone is at pos33, but pos33 is considered clear because "clear" means no agent. In that case, the move action can be to pos33 if it's clear (no agent there), even if there's a stone. But then the pushtogoal or pushtonongoal actions require the stone to be at l_from, which is pos33, and the agent can push it. So perhaps in this domain, "clear" for movement refers to the absence of the agent, while stones are separate. So when moving, you can move to a location that has a stone, but the action's preconditions require the destination to be clear (i.e., no agent there). Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Because if a stone is in the destination, you can't move there. Wait, the move action's preconditions say (ii) location l_to is clear. So if l_to has a stone, it's not clear. Therefore, in the initial state, pos33 is not clear because there's a stone there, but the problem says "Location pos33 is clear". So this is a contradiction. Therefore, the problem's initial state is invalid. But the user provided this, so perhaps it's a typo, and the initial state for pos33 should be not clear. But since we have to work with the given information, maybe we have to proceed under the assumption that the initial state has pos33 as clear, even though the stone is there. That would make the problem impossible, but perhaps there's an error.

Alternatively, perhaps "Location pos33 is clear" in the initial state is a mistake, and it's supposed to be not clear. Let's assume that. Otherwise, the problem is impossible. Since the user wants a valid plan, perhaps we should proceed under the corrected initial state where pos33 is not clear. Let's assume that. Otherwise, the move actions can't be done properly. But since the problem says "Location pos33 is clear", but stone1 is there, this is conflicting. So maybe the problem has a mistake. But perhaps the user intended that the stone is at pos33, and pos33 is not clear, so the initial state should have "Location pos33 is not clear". Let's proceed with that assumption. Otherwise, we can't form a valid plan. Let's proceed under the corrected initial state where pos33 is not clear. Otherwise, the problem is impossible. So in the initial state, pos33 has stone1, so it's not clear. Therefore, the initial state is:

player1 at pos53 (clear initially), stone1 at pos33 (making pos33 not clear). The rest as per the problem statement.

But given that the problem says "Location pos33 is clear", perhaps we need to proceed despite this contradiction. But that would make the problem impossible. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps "clear" in the initial state refers to the agent's absence. So pos33 is clear (no agent) even though there's a stone. Then, the move action's precondition (ii) is that l_to is clear (no agent). So the agent can move to a location that has a stone, but then the action would fail because the stone is there. But the move action's preconditions don't check for stones, only that the agent is at l_from and l_to is clear (agent-wise). So perhaps in this domain, stones don't block the agent's movement, but when pushing, you have to handle stones. Wait, but that's inconsistent with the action definitions. Let me recheck the preconditions.

The move action's preconditions are: (i) agent is at l_from, (ii) l_to is clear, (iii) can move from l_from to l_to via direction d. The definition of "clear" here probably includes that there's no agent or stone in l_to. Otherwise, the agent could move into a stone, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, the initial state's statement that pos33 is clear while stone1 is there is conflicting. Therefore, the problem has an error. But since we have to proceed, perhaps the user intended that pos33 is not clear. Let's proceed under that assumption.

Assuming that pos33 is not clear (since stone1 is there), and the initial state's mention of "Location pos33 is clear" is a mistake. So, the agent is at pos53, stone1 is at pos33 (pos33 not clear), and the goal is to get stone1 to pos51 (the only goal location mentioned).

Now, the constraints:

1. Player must be at pos43 at least once.
2. If player is at pos43, then in that state or a later one, stone1 is at pos24 or pos24 is not clear.
3. pos31 must always be clear. So, agent can never be at pos31, and no stones can be there.
4. Player must be at pos52 or pos11 at least once.
5. pos41 must always be clear. So no agent or stones can be there.
6. pos44 must be not clear (i.e., have agent or stone) in at least one state.
7. pos52 must be not clear in at least one state.
8. pos33 must be not clear in at least one state (but initially, it's not clear because of the stone, so this is already satisfied. Wait, but according to the problem's original state, pos33 is clear, which conflicts with the stone being there. So if we follow the problem's initial state, pos33 is clear (no agent, but stone is there), which would mean pos33 is clear. Then the constraint (8) requires that pos33 is not clear in at least one state. But in the initial state, it's clear. So we need to have a state where pos33 is not clear. But if the initial state already meets this (if the problem is incorrect), but assuming the initial pos33 is not clear (stone is there), then constraint 8 is satisfied in the initial state. But according to the problem's given initial state, pos33 is clear. So maybe this constraint is already satisfied by the initial state if the problem's initial state is correct. But this is confusing.

Assuming that the problem's initial state is correct as given, despite the contradiction. So pos33 is clear (no agent or stone), but the stone is at pos33. That's impossible. Therefore, the problem must have a mistake. But perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the initial state is as given, and the constraints are as stated.

Alternatively, perhaps "clear" in the initial state refers to the agent not being present. So stones can be in a location that is "clear" because "clear" only refers to the agent. Then, when the move action checks if l_to is clear, it's checking for the absence of the agent, not the stone. So the agent can move to a location with a stone. But pushing a stone requires the stone to be at l_from, which is the location the agent is moving to. But that's not possible. This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should proceed by trying to find a plan that moves the stone from pos33 to pos51, while satisfying all constraints, assuming that the initial state is correct as given (even with the possible contradiction).

So, the agent starts at pos53. Stone1 is at pos33, but pos33 is clear (which can't be, but let's proceed). The goal is to get stone1 to a goal location, which is pos51.

Constraints:

- The player must be at pos43 at least once. So in the plan, we need to have the agent at pos43 at some point.
- When the agent is at pos43, then either stone1 is at pos24 or pos24 is not clear in that state or later. So after visiting pos43, we need to ensure that stone1 ends up at pos24 or pos24 becomes occupied.
- pos31 must always be clear. So the agent can't go to pos31, and no stone can be there. So any path must avoid pos31.
- The agent must be at pos52 or pos11 at least once. So in the plan, the agent has to visit either pos52 or pos11.
- pos41 must always be clear. So agent can't go there, and stones can't be there.
- pos44 must be not clear at least once. So agent or stone must be there at some point.
- pos52 must be not clear at least once. So agent or stone there.
- pos33 must be not clear at least once. But according to initial state, it's clear. So we need to make it not clear. But since the stone is there, maybe when the agent moves to pos33? But the stone is already there. Wait, in the initial state, pos33 is clear (agent not there), but the stone is there. So "clear" here must mean that the agent is not present, and stones are allowed. So "clear" for movement is only about the agent. Therefore, the agent can move into a location with a stone, but when pushing, you need the stone to be in adjacent location.

But according to the move action's preconditions, (ii) location l_to is clear. If "clear" means no agent, then moving to a location with a stone is allowed. But that's not possible. Therefore, the problem's initial state must have an error.

This is a significant problem. Let me try to proceed by assuming that "clear" refers to the absence of both agent and stone. Therefore, the initial state has a contradiction. But since the problem requires a valid plan, perhaps the user intended that the stone is at pos33 and pos33 is not clear. So let's proceed with that.

So initial state:

- player1 at pos53.
- stone1 at pos33 (pos33 not clear).
- pos51 is a goal location.
- All other locations' statuses as per the problem.

Now, the goal is to get stone1 to pos51.

Constraints:

1. Player must be at pos43 once.
2. If player is at pos43, then stone1 at pos24 or pos24 not clear in that state or after.
3. pos31 always clear (no agent or stone there).
4. Player must be at pos52 or pos11 once.
5. pos41 always clear (no agent or stone there).
6. pos44 must be occupied (agent or stone) at least once.
7. pos52 must be occupied at least once.
8. pos33 must be occupied (not clear) at least once. But initial state already satisfies this (stone1 is there).
9. If pos33 is not clear (which it is in the initial state and after some actions?), then there must have been a prior state where pos51 or pos55 was not clear. Since pos51 is a goal location, and initially clear (since no agent or stone is there), unless the agent or stone is there. Initially, pos51 is a goal location and is clear. So to satisfy constraint 9, if pos33 is not clear (which it is in initial state), then we need an earlier state where pos51 or pos55 was not clear. But in the initial state, pos51 is clear. So this constraint is violated unless in the initial state, pos33 is not clear and we have an earlier state (which doesn't exist) where pos51 or pos55 is not clear. Therefore, this constraint can't be satisfied unless the plan modifies pos51 or pos55 to be not clear before pos33 becomes not clear. But pos33 is already not clear in the initial state, so the constraint requires that before the initial state, there was a state where pos51 or pos55 was not clear, which is impossible. Therefore, the problem is unsolvable unless there's a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the constraint 9 applies only when pos33 becomes not clear during the plan. So if pos33 is not clear in the initial state, the constraint requires that before any state where pos33 is not clear (including the initial state), there must have been a state where pos51 or pos55 was not clear. But in the initial state, pos51 and pos55 are clear. Therefore, the initial state violates constraint 9. Therefore, the problem is impossible unless the initial state is different. But this suggests that the problem is impossible as given, which can't be. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the constraints.

Alternatively, maybe constraint 9 is only triggered when pos33 becomes not clear during the plan. So if pos33 is already not clear in the initial state, the constraint is not applicable. The problem's constraint says:

"If expression "Location pos33 is not clear" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which ..."

So in the initial state, pos33 is not clear. Therefore, we need an earlier state (before the initial state) where pos51 or pos55 was not clear, which is impossible. Therefore, the problem is impossible. But the user expects a valid plan. So there must be a mistake in the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the constraint was intended to apply to states after the initial state. So if during the execution of the plan, pos33 becomes not clear (e.g., the agent moves there), then before that, pos51 or pos55 must have been not clear. But in the initial state, pos33 is not clear (due to the stone), and the constraint requires that there was a prior state where pos51 or pos55 was not clear. Since there's no prior state, the initial state violates the constraint. Therefore, the problem is impossible.

This suggests that there's a mistake in the problem's constraints. But given that the user wants a solution, perhaps we have to find a way to satisfy the constraints despite this.

Let me try to think of a plan that moves the stone from pos33 to pos51 while satisfying all constraints.

First, moving the agent from pos53 to pos43 (to satisfy constraint 1). But moving to pos43 requires a path. Let's look at the movement possibilities.

The agent starts at pos53. The possible moves from pos53 are:

- To pos43 via direction dirleft (since "You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft" — looking at the given movement options:

Looking at the original state's movement options:

"You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft"

Yes, that's present. So the agent can move from pos53 to pos43 via dirleft. But pos43 must be clear. Initially, pos43 is clear (as per initial state). So move player1 from pos53 to pos43.

Action: move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft

This satisfies constraint 1 (player is at pos43 in some state). Now, after this move, the agent is at pos43, which makes pos43 not clear, and pos53 becomes clear.

Now, according to constraint 2, after being at pos43, in that state or later, stone1 must be at pos24 or pos24 not clear. So we need to ensure that either stone1 moves to pos24 or pos24 is occupied (by agent or stone) at some point after the agent is at pos43.

But our goal is to move stone1 to pos51. So maybe after moving to pos43, the agent can push the stone from pos33 to pos24, but pos33 is where the stone is. Wait, the stone is at pos33. So from pos43, can the agent push the stone?

Wait, the agent is at pos43. To push the stone at pos33, the agent must be at a location adjacent to pos33 in the direction leading to the stone. Looking at the movement directions:

For example, to push the stone from pos33 to pos43's direction, but pos33 is to the left of pos43. Wait, pos43 is at (4,3), pos33 is at (3,3). So the direction from pos43 to pos33 is dirleft. But to push the stone from pos33, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. So to push the stone from pos33, the agent needs to be at pos33's adjacent location in the direction opposite to the push direction.

For example, to push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (down), the agent must be at pos33 and push down. But the agent can't be at pos33 because it's occupied by the stone. Wait, no. The agent can only push the stone if they are adjacent. Wait, the preconditions for pushtogoal or pushtonongoal are:

For "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d":

(i) agent p is at l_p

(ii) stone s is at l_from

(iii) l_to is clear

(iv) can move from l_p to l_from via direction d

(v) can move from l_from to l_to via direction d

So, for example, if the agent is at pos43 (l_p = pos43), and the stone is at pos33 (l_from = pos33), then can they push it? The direction from l_p (pos43) to l_from (pos33) is dirleft. Then, from l_from (pos33), direction dirleft would go to pos23, but the stone would be pushed to pos23. But pos23 is a non-goal location. Or direction dirright to pos43? Wait, no. The direction must be such that from l_p to l_from is possible. So if the agent is at pos43, and wants to push the stone at pos33, the direction from pos43 to pos33 is dirleft. Then, the stone is at pos33, and the agent is at pos43. But according to the movement options, can you move from pos43 to pos33 via direction dirleft? Let's check:

Looking at the movement options given:

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"

Yes, that's present. So the agent can move from pos43 to pos33 (but pos33 has the stone, so if "clear" for movement requires the destination to be clear (no stone), then this move is not possible. But if "clear" refers to the agent not being there, then pos33 is clear (stone is there but agent isn't), so the move is allowed. But after moving, the agent would be at pos33, which is where the stone is. That's impossible. Therefore, the move action's preconditions require that l_to is clear (no agent or stone). So if pos33 has a stone, then the move to pos33 is not allowed.

This brings us back to the initial problem: the initial state has a contradiction. Therefore, the problem is impossible as given. But since the user expects a solution, I must proceed under the assumption that the initial state is correct and find a way.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial state has the stone at pos33, and pos33 is not clear. The problem's initial state mentions "Location pos33 is clear" which is a mistake. Therefore, the correct initial state is pos33 not clear. So the agent can't move into pos33. Therefore, the agent needs to push the stone from pos33 to another location.

But the agent starts at pos53. To reach the stone at pos33, the agent needs to move to a position adjacent to pos33. Possible adjacent locations to pos33 are pos23 (up), pos43 (down), pos32 (left?), pos34 (right). Wait, pos33 is at (3,3). So:

- Up: pos23 (row 2, column 3)
- Down: pos43 (row 4, column3)
- Left: pos32 (row3, column2)
- Right: pos34 (row3, column4)

Wait, the movement directions may vary. The directions are dirup, dirdown, dirleft, dirright. So moving from pos33, dirup would go to pos23, dirdown to pos43, dirleft to pos32, dirright to pos34.

To push the stone from pos33, the agent must be at an adjacent location and then push the stone in a direction.

For example, to push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (right), the agent must be at pos33's left (pos32) and push right. But the agent can't be at pos32 unless they move there.

But the agent starts at pos53. To reach pos32, the path would be pos53 → pos43 → pos33 → pos32. But pos33 is occupied by the stone, so the agent can't move there. So alternative path: pos53 → pos43 → pos42 → pos32. Let's see:

From pos53, move to pos43 (dirleft). Then, from pos43, can move to pos42 (dirup) if pos42 is clear. Initially, pos42 is clear. So move player1 from pos43 to pos42 (dirup). Then from pos42, can move to pos32 (dirleft). So move to pos32. Now, the agent is at pos32, adjacent to pos33 (stone's location). From here, the agent can push the stone to pos34 (right direction). But pos34 must be clear. Initially, pos34 is clear. So using pushtonongoal (since pos34 is not a goal location), but we need to get the stone to pos51 eventually.

Wait, but pushing the stone to pos34 (non-goal) would require using pushtonongoal. But our goal is to get the stone to pos51, which is a goal location. So maybe after pushing the stone to pos34, then move around to push it further towards pos51.

But let's outline the steps:

1. Move player1 from pos53 to pos43 (dirleft). Satisfies constraint 1 (player at pos43).

Now, after this move, pos43 is not clear (agent there), and pos53 is clear.

Constraint 2: after being at pos43, stone1 must be at pos24 or pos24 not clear. So during or after this move, we need to make sure that either stone1 is moved to pos24 or pos24 is occupied.

But stone1 is at pos33. To get it to pos24, we need to push it there. But pos24 is in row2, column4. From pos33, pushing up to pos23, then right to pos24. But that requires multiple pushes.

Alternatively, after moving to pos43, the agent could push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (right), then to pos44 (down), then to pos54 (right?), but that might not help. Alternatively, push it up to pos23, then right to pos24, but pos24 is a non-goal location. Then push it further towards pos25, pos35, etc., but pos51 is the goal.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving to pos43, the agent can push the stone to pos34 (right), then move around to push it towards pos51.

But let's proceed step by step.

After moving to pos43:

Action 1: move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft

Now, player is at pos43. According to constraint 2, we need to ensure that stone1 is at pos24 or pos24 is not clear at some point after this. So perhaps after moving to pos43, the agent pushes the stone to pos34 (non-goal), then moves around to push it to pos44, then to pos54, etc., but this seems long.

Alternatively, after moving to pos43, the agent can move to pos42 (dirup), then to pos32 (dirleft), then push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (dirright). Let's try that.

Action 2: move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup

Now at pos42.

Action3: move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft

Now at pos32. Now, can push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (dirright). pos34 is a non-goal location, so use pushtonongoal.

Action4: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright

Preconditions check:

- Agent at pos32: yes.
- Stone at pos33: yes.
- pos34 is clear: yes.
- Can move from pos32 to pos33 (dirright)? Looking at movement options:

Looking at the given moves:

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown"

Wait, pos32 is at (3,2). pos33 is (3,3). So direction from pos32 to pos33 would be dirright, but the movement options for pos32 include:

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown"

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a typo in the movement directions. Alternatively, the directions are defined differently. For example, dirright might correspond to moving right in the grid, increasing the column index.

But the movement options list for pos32:

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos31 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown"

So to move from pos32 to pos33, direction is dirdown. That seems odd, as pos32 and pos33 are in the same row (3), columns 2 and 3. So moving from pos32 to pos33 would be to the right (dirright), but according to the problem's movement options, it's dirdown. This suggests that the directions might be mislabeled. For example, in a grid, moving from pos32 (row 3, column 2) to pos33 (row3, column3) would be to the right (dirright). But according to the problem, that movement is dirdown. This indicates that the directions are perhaps not aligned as expected. Therefore, the movement directions are not standard, and we have to follow the problem's given movement options.

So according to the problem's movement options, to get from pos32 to pos33, the direction is dirdown. So in action4, the direction would be dirdown.

So action4: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown

But wait, l_p is pos32, l_from is pos33, and direction from pos32 to pos33 is dirdown. Then, from pos33 to pos34, the direction would also be dirdown (since pos34 is row3, column4). But according to movement options:

From pos33, dirdown goes to pos43. Wait, pos33 is at (3,3). dirdown would be row4, column3 (pos43). So to move from pos33 to pos34, the direction would be dirright.

But according to the movement options for pos33:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"

Wait, no. Wait, looking back:

The movement options for pos33:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown"

Ah, here's the confusion. So from pos33, dirleft is to pos23, dirright to pos43, dirup to pos32, dirdown to pos34. So the directions are not as expected. Therefore, moving from pos33 to pos34 requires direction dirdown.

So for action4: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown

Preconditions:

(i) agent at pos32: yes.

(ii) stone at pos33: yes.

(iii) pos34 is clear: yes.

(iv) can move from pos32 to pos33 via dirdown: yes (according to movement options, pos32 to pos33 is dirdown).

(v) can move from pos33 to pos34 via dirdown: yes (from pos33's movement options).

(vi) pos34 is not a goal location: pos34 is not a goal location (as per problem statement: pos34 is not a goal location).

So this action is valid.

Effects:

- Agent is no longer at pos32.

- Stone is no longer at pos33.

- pos34 is no longer clear.

- Agent is now at pos33.

- Stone is at pos34.

- pos32 is clear.

- Stone is at non-goal state.

Now, after this action, stone1 is at pos34 (non-goal), agent at pos33. But pos33 is now clear? Because the stone was moved to pos34. So pos33 is now clear (since stone1 is no longer there). But the agent is at pos33, so pos33 is not clear. So pos33 is now occupied by the agent.

But according to constraint 3: pos31 must always be clear. pos31 is clear, so no problem.

Now, the agent is at pos33. Next, need to push the stone further towards pos51.

But pos34 has the stone. To push it further, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos34. So from pos33, the agent can move to pos34 (dirdown) to be adjacent, but pos34 has the stone. Alternatively, move to pos43 (dirright), then to pos44 (dirdown), then push the stone from pos34 to pos44.

Alternatively, the agent can push the stone from pos34 to pos44.

But the agent is at pos33. To push the stone at pos34, the agent must be at a position adjacent to pos34 in the direction opposite to the push direction. For example, to push the stone from pos34 to pos44 (dirdown), the agent needs to be at pos34's up direction (pos24), but the agent is at pos33. Alternatively, to push from pos34 to pos44 (dirright?), but directions are confusing.

Wait, let's look at the movement options for pos34:

From pos34:

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos33 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos35 following direction dirdown"

So, to push the stone from pos34 to pos44, direction dirright. The agent would need to be at pos34's left (pos24) to push it right. But the agent is at pos33, which is not adjacent to pos34 in the required direction.

Alternatively, the agent could move from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown), but pos34 is occupied by the stone. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, the agent can move from pos33 to pos43 (dirright). Then, from pos43, move to pos44 (dirdown). Then, from pos44, push the stone from pos34 to pos44 (dirleft)? Not sure.

This is getting complicated. Let's think differently. The goal is to get the stone to pos51. The stone is at pos34 now. To move it towards pos51, which is at (5,1). So need to move it left (west) and up (north). From pos34, moving left to pos24, then to pos14, etc., but pos51 is at the bottom row (row5). Wait, pos51 is (5,1). So to get there from pos34, the stone needs to go down to pos44, then right to pos54, then down to pos55? No, that's not helpful. Wait, pos51 is in row5, column1. So to reach pos51 from pos34, the stone needs to move down to pos44, then down to pos54, then left to pos53, pos52, pos51. But pos54 is not a goal location. Alternatively, push the stone to pos44, then pos54, then pos55, but pos55 is not a goal. The only goal is pos51.

Alternatively, maybe push the stone to pos35, then pos45, then pos55, then left to pos54, etc., but this seems long.

Alternatively, consider pushing the stone from pos34 back to pos33, then up to pos23, then left to pos24, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, after moving the stone to pos34, the agent can move to pos44 and push the stone to pos44, but that's not helpful.

This approach seems stuck. Maybe a better path is needed.

Alternative plan:

After the initial move to pos43 (satisfying constraint 1), the agent needs to handle constraint 2 by ensuring that stone1 is at pos24 or pos24 is not clear after that. To do that, perhaps push the stone to pos24 directly.

But from pos33, pushing the stone up to pos23 (dirleft), then right to pos24 (dirdown). Let's see.

After action1: move to pos43.

Action2: move to pos33 (but it's occupied by the stone, so can't. So alternative path: from pos43, move to pos42 (dirup), then to pos32 (dirleft), then push the stone from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft), but that requires the agent to be at pos33's right (pos34) to push left, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, from pos32, the agent can push the stone from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft), but the direction from pos32 to pos33 is dirdown, so the push direction would be dirup? No, the push direction is determined by the movement from l_from to l_to. Let me check.

For the pushtonongoal action, the agent is at l_p (pos32), pushes the stone from l_from (pos33) to l_to (pos23) using direction d. The direction d must be such that the agent can move from l_p (pos32) to l_from (pos33) via d, and from l_from to l_to via d.

From pos32 to pos33: direction is dirdown (per movement options).

From pos33 to pos23: direction is dirleft (per movement options). So the directions are different, so the push action would need to have direction dirdown for the agent to reach pos33, and then dirleft for the stone to move to pos23. But the action requires that both movements use the same direction. Therefore, this is not possible. Therefore, the agent cannot push the stone from pos33 to pos23 in a single action.

Therefore, the only possible directions for pushing from pos33 are the directions that are valid for both the agent's move to pos33 and the stone's move from pos33. For example, if the agent is at pos32, they can push the stone from pos33 to pos34 via dirdown (as done earlier). Or if the agent is at pos43, they can push the stone from pos33 to pos43 via dirright (but pos43 is where the agent was, but after moving, the agent is at pos43, so cannot push into themselves.

This is getting too complicated. Let's try to find a path that gets the stone to pos51 while satisfying all constraints.

Alternative approach:

The stone starts at pos33. To reach pos51, it needs to move left (to pos32, pos31, but pos31 must stay clear) or right to pos34, then down to pos44, etc. But pos31 can't be used. So the stone must go right to pos34, down to pos44, then right to pos54, down to pos55, then left to pos54, pos53, pos52, pos51. But pos51 is the only goal location.

But this path would require several pushes. Let's outline the steps:

1. Move agent from pos53 to pos43 (dirleft). Satisfies constraint 1.

2. Push stone from pos33 to pos34 (using agent at pos32 as before). But to get to pos32, the agent needs to move from pos43 to pos42 (dirup), then to pos32 (dirleft).

3. Push stone from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown). Now stone is at pos34.

4. Agent is now at pos33. Move agent from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown) but pos34 has the stone. So can't move there. Alternatively, move from pos33 to pos43 (dirright).

5. Agent moves from pos33 to pos43 (dirright).

6. Then, move to pos44 (dirdown).

7. Push stone from pos34 to pos44 (dirright). Now stone is at pos44.

8. Agent is now at pos34.

9. Move agent to pos44 (dirright), but pos44 is now occupied by the stone. So can't.

Alternatively, after step 3, the stone is at pos34. The agent is at pos33. Then, agent moves from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown). But pos34 is occupied by the stone. So invalid.

Alternative path after step 3:

3. Stone at pos34, agent at pos33.

4. Agent moves from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown) – impossible.

Alternative, agent moves from pos33 to pos43 (dirright).

4. Move agent from pos33 to pos43 (dirright).

Now, agent is at pos43. Then, push stone from pos34 to pos44 (dirright). But agent needs to be at pos34's left (pos24) to push right. Agent is at pos43, which is below pos34. So can't push directly.

This is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to find a different path that satisfies all constraints.

Another approach: To satisfy constraint 4 (agent at pos52 or pos11), we can have the agent move to pos52 at some point.

From pos53, moving to pos52 is possible via dirdown? Wait, movement options from pos53:

"You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos53 to location pos52 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown"

So, to get to pos52 from pos53: dirup.

Action: move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup.

Now, agent is at pos52, satisfying constraint 4.

But we also need to be at pos43. So after this, the agent needs to move to pos43.

But from pos52, the agent can move to pos42 (dirleft), then to pos43 (dirdown).

Action1: move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup (satisfies constraint4)

Action2: move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft

Action3: move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown (now at pos43, satisfying constraint1)

Now, constraint2: after being at pos43, stone1 must be at pos24 or pos24 not clear. So after action3, we need to ensure that stone1 is moved to pos24 or pos24 is occupied.

But the stone is at pos33. To move it to pos24, need to push it up to pos23, then right to pos24.

But how?

From pos43, agent can move to pos33 (dirleft), but pos33 has the stone, so can't move there. So agent needs to move around.

From pos43, move to pos42 (dirup), then to pos32 (dirleft), then push stone from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown) as before.

Then, from pos34, push to pos44 (dirright), then to pos54 (dirright), then to pos55 (dirdown), then left to pos54, pos53, etc. But this doesn't lead to pos51.

Alternatively, after moving the stone to pos34, agent can push it to pos35 (dirdown), then to pos45 (dirright), then to pos55 (dirright), then left to pos54, etc. But pos51 is at (5,1), so this path is not helpful.

Alternative idea: Push the stone from pos33 to pos43 (dirright), but the agent is at pos43. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, agent moves from pos43 to pos53 (dirdown), then to pos54 (dirdown), etc., but this doesn't help.

This is very complicated. Let's try to outline a possible plan step by step, considering all constraints.

Plan Outline:

1. Move player1 from pos53 to pos52 (dirup) to satisfy constraint4.

Action: move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup

Now, pos52 is not clear (agent there), satisfying constraint7.

2. Move player1 from pos52 to pos42 (dirleft).

Action: move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft

3. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown).

Action: move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown

Now, at pos43 (constraint1 satisfied).

4. Now, need to ensure constraint2: after this, stone1 is at pos24 or pos24 not clear. Let's make pos24 not clear by moving the agent there.

But pos24 is in row2, column4. To get there from pos43, the agent would need to move up to pos33, then left to pos23, then up to pos24. But pos33 has the stone, so can't move there. Alternative path: pos43 → pos44 → pos34 → pos24. But pos44 is clear initially.

Action4: move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown

Now at pos44 (satisfies constraint6: pos44 not clear).

5. Move from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft).

Action5: move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft

6. Move from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft).

Action6: move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft

Now, pos24 is not clear (agent there), satisfying constraint2.

But this doesn't involve the stone. However, this satisfies constraint2 because pos24 is not clear after the agent is at pos43. But we also need to move the stone to pos51.

But this approach uses many steps and may not be optimal. Also, need to check other constraints, like pos31 and pos41 must always be clear.

Now, after these steps, the stone is still at pos33. Need to move it.

Alternative approach: After step3 (agent at pos43), push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (dirright). To do this, the agent needs to be at pos33's west (pos32) to push east. But the agent is at pos43. So need to move to pos32.

7. Move from pos43 to pos42 (dirup).

Action7: move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup

8. Move from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft).

Action8: move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft

9. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown).

Action9: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown

Now, stone1 is at pos34, agent at pos33.

10. Move agent from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown) — impossible as pos34 has stone.

Alternative: move agent from pos33 to pos43 (dirright).

Action10: move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright

Now, agent at pos43.

11. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos44 (dirright).

Agent is at pos43. To push stone1 from pos34 to pos44, agent needs to be at pos34's west (pos24), which they are not. So can't push directly. Agent needs to move to pos34.

But pos34 is occupied by the stone. Can't move there.

Alternative path: agent moves to pos44.

Action10: move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown

Now, agent at pos44.

12. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos44 (dirright) — but pos44 is now occupied by the agent. Can't push there.

Alternatively, push stone1 from pos34 to pos35 (dirdown).

Agent at pos44. To push stone1 from pos34 to pos35, agent must be at pos34's up (pos24). Not possible.

This is not working. Let's try a different approach after step9:

After action9, stone1 is at pos34, agent at pos33.

Now, agent moves from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown) — invalid.

So agent moves from pos33 to pos43 (dirright).

Action10: move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright

Now, agent at pos43.

11. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos44 (dirright). To do this, agent must be at pos34's west (pos24), but agent is at pos43. So can't.

Alternative plan: from pos43, move to pos44 (dirdown).

Action11: move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown

Now, agent at pos44.

12. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos44 (dirright). But pos44 is occupied by the agent. Can't.

Alternatively, push stone1 from pos34 to pos35 (dirdown). To do this, agent must be at pos34's north (pos24), which is not possible.

This is not working. Perhaps we need to push the stone from pos34 to pos44 via a different direction.

From pos34, the movement options allow moving dirright to pos44. So the direction from pos34 to pos44 is dirright. Therefore, the agent must be at pos34's west (pos24) to push it east. But agent is at pos44, which is south of pos34. Can't push.

Thus, this path is blocked.

Alternative idea: After step9 (stone at pos34, agent at pos33), move agent to pos34 (dirdown) — impossible. So move agent to pos43 (dirright).

Action10: move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright

Now, agent at pos43.

Then, push stone1 from pos34 to pos44 (dirright). To do this, agent must be at pos34's west (pos24), but they're at pos43. Not possible.

Alternative path: agent moves from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown).

Action11: move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown

Now, agent at pos44.

Then, push stone1 from pos34 to pos44 (dirright). But pos44 is occupied by agent. Can't.

This seems impossible. Let's consider another approach: after moving the stone to pos34, the agent moves to pos44 and pushes the stone to pos45 (dirdown), then to pos55 (dirright), then left to pos54, pos53, pos52, pos51. But pos51 is a goal.

Let's try:

After action9 (stone at pos34, agent at pos33):

Action10: move agent from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown) — invalid.

Alternative, move agent from pos33 to pos43 (dirright).

Action10: move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright

Action11: move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown

Action12: push stone1 from pos34 to pos44 (dirright). Agent must be at pos34's west (pos24) to push east. Not possible.

This is not working. I'm stuck.

Alternative idea: Use the pushtogoal action when possible. The goal is pos51. So need to push the stone to pos51. To do that, the agent must push it from pos41 to pos51 (dirright), but pos41 must be clear. However, pos41 must always be clear (constraint5). So the agent can't be at pos41, and the stone can't be there. Therefore, the stone must be pushed to pos51 from pos41's west (pos31), but pos31 must be clear (constraint3). So this is impossible. Therefore, the only way to get the stone to pos51 is via pos51's south (pos41), which is always clear. So the stone must be pushed from pos41 to pos51 (dirright). But pos41 must be clear, so the stone can't be there. Therefore, this is impossible.

Wait, this can't be. There must be a way. Let me check the movement options again.

From pos41, you can move to pos51 via dirright. So to push the stone from pos41 to pos51, the agent must be at pos41, push the stone east to pos51. But pos41 must always be clear (constraint5), so the agent can't be there. Therefore, this is impossible. Thus, the problem is unsolvable. But the user expects a solution. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the stone can be pushed to pos51 from pos51's north (pos41), but pos41 must be clear. So the agent can't be at pos41 to push the stone. Therefore, it's impossible. Hence, the problem is impossible as given. But the user requires a valid plan, so I must have made a mistake.

Alternative path: The stone can be pushed to pos51 from pos51's west (pos41) but pos41 is always clear. So the agent can't be there. Alternatively, from pos51's east (pos52), but pos51 is the end of the row. So no.

Therefore, the problem is impossible. But since the user expects a solution, I must have missed something.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the only goal location is pos51. So the stone must end up there. But according to the initial state, pos51 is a goal location. So the plan must end with the stone at pos51.

But to get there, the agent must push the stone from pos41 to pos51. But pos41 must be clear. Therefore, the agent can't be at pos41 to push. Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, the problem is unsolvable. But the user expects a solution. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem's initial state or constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps the stone can be pushed to pos51 from pos51's south (pos5, which is not present in the grid). So no.

Alternatively, the agent can push the stone from pos51's west (pos41) to pos51. But pos41 must be clear. Therefore, the agent can't be there. Therefore, impossible.

This suggests that the problem is impossible to solve, but the user expects a plan. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my analysis.

Alternative idea: Maybe there's a different path that I'm missing. For example, pushing the stone from pos33 to pos43 (south), then to pos53 (south), then to pos54 (east), then to pos55 (south), then to pos54 (north), then west to pos53, pos52, pos51.

But let's see:

After moving the stone to pos34 (as before), then to pos44 (dirright), then to pos54 (dirright), then to pos55 (dirdown), then left to pos54, pos53, pos52, pos51.

But how?

Starting from pos34:

1. Push to pos44 (dirright): agent needs to be at pos34's west (pos24) to push east. So agent must be at pos24. But how to get there?

From pos33 (after pushing to pos34), agent is at pos33. Then move to pos34 (invalid), so agent moves to pos43.

Then, agent moves from pos43 to pos42, pos32, pos22, pos23, pos24. But this is a long path.

Let's try:

Action9: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown (stone at pos34, agent at pos33)

Action10: move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright

Action11: move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup

Action12: move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft

Action13: move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup

Action14: move player1 pos22 pos23 dirright

Action15: move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown

Now, agent at pos24. Can push stone from pos34 to pos44 (dirright).

Action16: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright

Now, stone at pos44, agent at pos34.

Then, push from pos44 to pos54 (dirright):

Agent needs to be at pos44's west (pos34) to push east.

Action17: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright

Stone at pos54, agent at pos44.

Then, push from pos54 to pos55 (dirdown):

Agent needs to be at pos54's north (pos44) to push south.

Action18: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos54 pos55 dirdown

Stone at pos55, agent at pos54.

Finally, push from pos55 to pos54 (dirup) — no. Or push to pos54's west (pos53), but pos54 to pos53 is dirleft.

But pos55 is not a goal. We need to get to pos51. So from pos55, the agent must push the stone left to pos54, then to pos53, pos52, pos51.

But pos55 is a non-goal location. So:

Action19: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos55 pos54 dirup (invalid)

Alternatively, move agent to pos55 and push west to pos54.

Agent at pos54, move to pos55 (dirdown).

Action19: move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown

Then, push stone from pos55 to pos54 dirup.

Action20: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos55 pos55 pos54 dirup (invalid, stone must be at pos55 to push to pos54).

Wait, the stone is at pos55. To push it west to pos54, the agent must be at pos55's east (invalid) or south (no), or north (pos54 is north of pos55). So direction dirup from pos55 to pos54. So agent must be at pos55's south (no), but pos55 is the bottom row. So no. Therefore, the stone can't be pushed from pos55 to pos54.

Therefore, this path is blocked.

Thus, the problem is impossible to solve given the constraints. But the user expects a solution. Therefore, I must have made a mistake.

Perhaps there's a different way to push the stone to pos51. Let me try a different approach.

From the initial state:

Agent at pos53. Stone at pos33.

Possible steps:

1. Move agent from pos53 to pos43 (dirleft) to satisfy constraint1.

2. Move agent from pos43 to pos42 (dirup).

3. Move agent from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft).

4. Push stone from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown).

5. Move agent from pos33 to pos43 (dirright).

6. Move agent from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown).

7. Push stone from pos34 to pos44 (dirright).

8. Move agent from pos44 to pos54 (dirright).

9. Push stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirright).

10. Move agent from pos54 to pos55 (dirdown).

11. Push stone from pos54 to pos55 (dirdown).

12. Move agent from pos55 to pos54 (dirup).

13. Push stone from pos55 to pos54 (dirup) — invalid.

This is not helpful.

Alternatively, after step7 (stone at pos44), agent at pos44:

8. Push stone from pos44 to pos45 (dirdown).

9. Push stone from pos45 to pos55 (dirright).

10. Move agent to pos55 and push left to pos54, etc. But again, pos55 is not a goal.

Thus, the problem seems impossible. Therefore, the only conclusion is that there's a mistake in the problem statement, possibly in the initial state or constraints. However, given that the user expects a solution, I'll proceed to provide a plan that attempts to satisfy the constraints, even if it's not perfect.
