Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. From the initial state, stone1 is at pos33, and the only goal location mentioned is pos24. So the final goal is to have stone1 at pos24.

First, the agent starts at pos41. So I need to move the agent to pos33 to push the stone. But there are constraints to consider. Let's list out the constraints to make sure I don't miss any.

Constraints:
1. The agent must be at pos22 in at least one state. But to be there, there must be an earlier state where pos41 is not clear or the agent is at pos45. Wait, pos41 is initially clear, so the only way is if the agent was at pos45 before being at pos22. But the agent starts at pos41. Hmm, maybe the agent needs to move to pos45 first to satisfy that precondition for being at pos22 later.

2. pos23 must always be clear. So when moving the agent or stones, we can't block pos23 at any time. That might affect the path we take.

3. pos42 being not clear can only happen in at most one continuous sequence. So if the agent or a stone is at pos42, it can't be left and then reoccupied again later. So we need to make sure that any action that blocks pos42 is done in a single continuous block of steps.

4. The agent must be at pos33 in at least one state. But to be there, there must be an earlier state where pos22 is not clear or the agent was at pos22. Since pos22 is initially clear, maybe the agent needs to go to pos22 first, then move to pos33.

5. pos22 being not clear can only happen once in a continuous sequence. So if the agent is at pos22, that's okay, but if they leave and come back, that's a problem. Wait, no—it's "at most one continuous sequence." So pos22 can't be not clear in two separate time periods. So if the agent is at pos22, leaves, and comes back, that's two sequences, which violates the constraint. So we need to ensure that pos22 is only occupied once continuously.

6. pos42 must be not clear in at least one state. So the agent or a stone must be there at some point, but with the constraint that before that, pos44 was not clear. Initially, pos44 is clear. So to make pos44 not clear, the agent must move there first. Wait, pos44 is clear initially. So to make pos44 not clear, the agent needs to be at pos44. Then, after that, pos42 can be blocked. But how to do that? Maybe move the agent to pos44 first, then later to pos42.

7. The agent must never be at pos43. So any path that goes through pos43 is invalid. So the agent can't move through pos43. So from pos41, moving to pos42 is allowed (since pos43 is forbidden), but moving to pos31 is allowed. Wait, the movement options from pos41 are to pos31 (dirleft) or pos51 (dirright) or pos42 (dirdown). So the agent can move down to pos42, which is allowed as long as they don't go to pos43.

Wait, but the constraint says the agent must never be at pos43. So all actions that involve moving to pos43 are forbidden. So the agent can't go to pos43. So the movement path must avoid pos43 entirely.

Let me sketch the possible path for moving the agent from pos41 to pos33 to push the stone to pos24.

First, the agent is at pos41. To get to pos33, possible path:

pos41 -> pos31 (dirleft), then pos31 -> pos32 (dirdown), pos32 -> pos33 (dirdown). But wait, can the agent move from pos31 to pos32? Let me check the "may move" list. Yes, "You may move from location pos31 to location pos32 following direction dirdown". Then pos32 to pos33 via dirdown. So that's possible. However, when moving from pos32 to pos33, the agent would end up at pos33. But we need to check if pos33 is clear. Initially, pos33 has stone1. So the agent can't move directly there. So the agent can't move into pos33 unless pushing the stone.

Wait, the "move" action requires that the target location is clear. Since pos33 has the stone, the agent can't move there. Therefore, the agent must push the stone from pos33 to another location. But the goal is to get the stone to pos24, which is a goal location.

So the plan would be:

1. Move agent to a position adjacent to the stone (pos33), then push the stone towards pos24.

But the stone is at pos33. To push it to pos24, the agent needs to be in a position adjacent to pos33 in the direction towards pos24. pos24 is to the left and down from pos33. Wait, pos33's coordinates are (3,3) if we consider pos11 as (1,1), pos12 as (1,2), etc. Then pos24 is (2,4). Wait, maybe the positions are arranged in a grid where the first digit is the row and the second is the column. So pos33 is row 3, column 3. pos24 is row 2, column4.

To move the stone from pos33 to pos24, the agent needs to push it up (dirup) from pos33 to pos23, then right (dirright) to pos24. But pos23 must remain clear at all times. Wait, no. The constraint says pos23 must be clear in every state. So if the stone is pushed to pos23, that would violate the constraint. Therefore, we cannot push the stone through pos23. So that path is blocked.

Alternative route: push the stone down to pos34, then left to pos24? Let's see. pos33 to pos34 (dirdown) would be possible. Then from pos34, pushing left (dirleft) to pos24. Because pos34 can move left to pos24. So pos34 to pos24 is allowed via direction dirleft. Let's check the movement possibilities. Looking at the "may move" list, "You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft". So yes, that's allowed. So pushing the stone from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown), then from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft). But to do that, the agent needs to be positioned south of pos33 (i.e., pos43) to push it down. But pos43 is forbidden for the agent. Oh right, the agent can't be at pos43. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, can the agent push the stone from pos33 to pos34 from the east? Wait, the direction for pushing would need to be such that the agent is adjacent to the stone and pushing it in the desired direction. For example, to push the stone south (dirdown) to pos34, the agent needs to be north of the stone (pos33) and push it down. But pos33's north is pos23, but the agent can't be at pos23 if it's required to be clear. Wait, no. The agent can be at pos23 as long as it's allowed. Wait, the constraint says pos23 must be clear in every state. So the agent cannot be at pos23 at any time, because that would make pos23 not clear. Therefore, the agent can't be at pos23, which blocks that path.

Hmm, this complicates things. So the stone is at pos33. The agent needs to push it to pos24, but cannot go through pos23 or pos43. Let's think of another path.

Another option: push the stone east to pos43, then north to pos42, then west to pos32, then north to pos22, then east to pos23 (but pos23 must remain clear). No, that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe push the stone west to pos23, but that's forbidden because pos23 must stay clear. So that's not allowed.

Wait, the only goal location is pos24. So the stone must end up at pos24. So how to get it there? The agent can't go through pos23 or pos43, and the stone can't be moved into pos23. Let me re-examine the movement possibilities.

Looking at the allowed moves from pos33: the stone is at pos33. The agent can push it if adjacent. Possible directions:

From pos33, the stone can be pushed to pos23 (dirleft), pos43 (dirright), pos32 (dirup), or pos34 (dirdown). But:

- Pushing to pos23 is forbidden because pos23 must remain clear.
- Pushing to pos43 would require the agent to be at pos33's right (pos43's left?), but pos43 is forbidden for the agent. Wait, the agent can't be at pos43. So to push the stone to pos43, the agent would need to be at pos43's west, which is pos33. But the agent can't be at pos33 unless they move there, but pos33 has the stone. Wait, the agent can't move into pos33 because it's occupied by the stone. So the only way to push the stone is if the agent is adjacent to it.

Wait, the "pushtogoal" and "pushtonongoal" actions require that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's current position) in the direction d. For example, to push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown), the agent needs to be at pos33's north (pos23) or south (pos43) or east (pos44?) Wait, no. The direction is the direction from l_p to l_from, then from l_from to l_to. So for pushing the stone down (dirdown) from pos33 to pos34, the agent must be at a location l_p such that you can move from l_p to pos33 following dirdown. Wait, no. The precondition for pushtogoal is that you can get from l_p to l_from (pos33) following direction d, and then from l_from to l_to (pos34) following direction d. So d must be the same direction for both.

Wait, the direction d is the direction from l_p to l_from and then from l_from to l_to. So if the agent is at l_p, then moving in direction d to l_from (the stone's position), and then the stone moves in direction d to l_to.

So for example, to push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown), the agent must be at pos33's north (pos23) and move down to pos33, pushing the stone down to pos34. But pos23 must remain clear, so the agent can't be there. Alternatively, the agent could be south of pos33 (pos43) and push up, but pos43 is forbidden. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the stone to the east (dirright) from pos33 to pos43. But again, to do that, the agent would need to be west of pos33 (pos23, which is forbidden) or east (pos43 is forbidden). Wait, no. To push east, the agent would be at pos33's west (pos23) and push east. But pos23 is forbidden. So that's not possible.

Wait, this seems like a dead end. How else can the agent approach the stone?

Alternatively, the agent could move around to the east side. Let's see. The agent starts at pos41. Maybe move right to pos51, then down to pos52, then left to pos42. But pos42 is allowed. Then from pos42, move up to pos32, then left to pos22. Wait, but the agent needs to reach pos22 at some point to satisfy the constraint. Let's map out the possible movement path.

Starting at pos41:

Option 1: move down to pos42 (dirdown). Then from pos42, move up to pos32 (dirup?), wait, looking at the "may move" list for pos42: "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"? Wait, let me check.

Wait, the "may move" list for pos42 includes:

- "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"
- "You may move from location pos42 to location pos52 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos42 to location pos41 following direction dirup"
- "You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown"

But moving to pos43 is forbidden. So from pos42, the agent can go to pos32 (dirleft), pos52 (dirright), pos41 (dirup), or pos43 (dirdown) which is forbidden. So the agent can't go down to pos43. So from pos42, possible directions are left (to pos32), right (pos52), or up (pos41).

Alternatively, from pos41, the agent could move left to pos31. Then from pos31, move right to pos41 again, but that's not helpful. Or down to pos32. Let's see:

pos41 -> pos31 (dirleft). Then from pos31, can move down to pos32 (dirdown). Then from pos32, can move left to pos22 (dirleft). Then from pos22, move down to pos23 (dirdown), but pos23 must stay clear. So that's not allowed. Alternatively, from pos32, move up to pos31 (dirup), but that's backtracking.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's consider the constraints again:

- Agent must be at pos22 at least once. But to get there, there must be an earlier state where pos41 is not clear or agent is at pos45. Since pos41 is initially clear, agent must have been at pos45 before being at pos22. So the agent needs to go to pos45 first. But how?

Starting at pos41, the agent can move right to pos51 (dirright), then down to pos52 (dirdown), then down to pos53 (dirdown), then right to pos54, etc. But pos45 is in row 4, column5. So from pos41, to reach pos45, the agent would need to go right to pos51, then down multiple times? Wait, pos51 is in row 5, column1. To get to pos45 (row4, column5), that's a long way. Let's see:

From pos41, the agent can move right to pos51 (dirright), then down to pos52 (dirdown). Then from pos52, down to pos53 (dirdown), then down to pos54, then down to pos55. Then from pos55, left to pos45 (dirleft). Then pos45 is column5, row4? Wait, the locations are posXY where X is the row and Y is the column. So pos45 is row4, column5. So from pos55 (row5, column5), moving left (dirleft) would go to pos54, then pos53, etc. Wait, no. The direction dirleft from pos55 would go to pos45, according to the "may move" list. Let me check: "You may move from location pos55 to location pos45 following direction dirleft". Yes. So pos55 to pos45 via dirleft. So the path from pos41 to pos45 would be:

pos41 → pos51 (dirright), then pos51 → pos52 (dirdown), pos52 → pos53 (dirdown), pos53 → pos54 (dirdown), pos54 → pos55 (dirdown), pos55 → pos45 (dirleft). That's a long path. Then, once at pos45, the agent can then move to pos35 (dirleft), then pos35 → pos34 (dirup), pos34 → pos24 (dirleft), etc. But this seems very time-consuming and may not be optimal.

But the constraint requires that if the agent is at pos22, there must have been an earlier state where pos41 was not clear or the agent was at pos45. Since pos41 is initially clear, the agent must have been at pos45 before reaching pos22. So the agent needs to go to pos45 first. Then, from pos45, maybe move up to pos35 (dirup?), but need to check the movement options.

Alternatively, after reaching pos45, the agent can move left to pos44, then pos44 → pos34 (dirleft), then pos34 → pos24 (dirleft), but that's getting closer to the goal location. However, the stone is at pos33. Maybe after reaching pos45, the agent can move left to pos44, then up to pos34, left to pos24, then work their way back to pos22. But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can go to pos45, then move up to pos35 (dirup), then left to pos34 (dirleft), then left to pos24 (dirleft), then down to pos25 (dirdown), then left to pos24 again. Wait, not sure.

This is getting really complex. Let's try to outline a possible path step by step, considering all constraints.

First, the agent must visit pos45 before visiting pos22. So steps:

1. Move from pos41 to pos51 (dirright)
2. Move from pos51 to pos52 (dirdown)
3. Move from pos52 to pos53 (dirdown)
4. Move from pos53 to pos54 (dirdown)
5. Move from pos54 to pos55 (dirdown)
6. Move from pos55 to pos45 (dirleft)

Now the agent is at pos45. This satisfies the condition that before being at pos22, the agent was at pos45. Now, the agent needs to get to pos22. How?

From pos45, the agent can move up to pos44 (dirup). Then from pos44, left to pos34 (dirleft). Then from pos34, left to pos24 (dirleft). Then from pos24, up to pos23 (dirup), but pos23 must remain clear. So that's not allowed. Alternatively, from pos24, the agent can move up to pos23 (dirup), but again, that's forbidden. So alternative path from pos34: from pos34, up to pos33 (dirup?), but pos33 has the stone. Wait, pos34 to pos33 is allowed via dirup. Let's check the movement list: "You may move from location pos34 to location pos33 following direction dirup". Yes. So pos34 → pos33 (dirup). But pos33 is occupied by the stone, so the agent can't move there unless pushing the stone. Wait, the move action requires the target to be clear. So the agent can't move into pos33 unless they push the stone.

So from pos34, the agent can't move to pos33 via move. So need to find another way. Alternatively, from pos34, the agent can move down to pos44 (dirup?), no. Wait, pos34's possible moves: "You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos34 to location pos33 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos34 to location pos35 following direction dirdown".

So from pos34, the agent can go left to pos24, right to pos44, up to pos33 (blocked by stone), or down to pos35. From pos34, moving left to pos24 (dirleft) is allowed. Then from pos24, the agent can move up to pos23 (dirup), but pos23 must stay clear. So that's invalid. So pos24 is the goal location for the stone. The agent can be at pos24, but the stone needs to be there.

Alternatively, from pos34, the agent can move right to pos44 (dirright). Then from pos44, move up to pos43 (dirup), but pos43 is forbidden. So no. Alternatively, move down to pos45 (dirdown?), no. From pos44, the directions are left (pos34), right (pos54), up (pos43 forbidden), or down (pos45). So from pos44, down to pos45 (dirdown). But that's backtracking.

This seems like a dead end. Maybe the agent needs to go from pos45 back towards pos22 via a different route. Let's try another approach.

From pos45, the agent can move left to pos44 (dirleft). Then pos44 → pos34 (dirleft). pos34 → pos24 (dirleft). Then from pos24, move up to pos23 (dirup) is forbidden. So maybe from pos24, move down to pos25 (dirdown). Then pos25 → pos24 (dirup) again. Not helpful.

Alternatively, from pos24, the agent can move right to pos34 (dirright). Then pos34 → pos44 (dirright). Not helpful.

Wait, maybe the agent needs to go from pos45 to pos35 (dirleft), then pos35 → pos34 (dirup), pos34 → pos24 (dirleft). Now, from pos24, how to get to pos22? pos24 can move up to pos23 (forbidden), or left to pos14 (dirleft?), no. Wait, pos24's movement options: "You may move from location pos24 to location pos14 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos24 to location pos34 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos24 to location pos23 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos24 to location pos25 following direction dirdown". So from pos24, the agent can move up to pos23 (forbidden), left to pos14, right to pos34, or down to pos25. To reach pos22, the agent would need to go from pos14 to pos24, but that's not helpful.

This is getting too complicated. Let's consider a different approach. Maybe the agent can move to pos22 via pos32 and pos22. But how?

Wait, after getting to pos45, the agent needs to go to pos22. Let's think of a path from pos45 to pos22:

pos45 → pos35 (dirleft), pos35 → pos34 (dirup), pos34 → pos24 (dirleft), pos24 → pos14 (dirleft), pos14 → pos13 (dirup), pos13 → pos12 (dirup), pos12 → pos22 (dirright). But this is a long path. And during this path, the agent would pass through various locations. But also, we have the constraint that pos42 must be not clear in at least one state, but before that, pos44 must be not clear. So the agent needs to make sure that pos44 is not clear (i.e., agent is there) before pos42 is not clear.

Hmm, this is getting too tangled. Let's try to outline the steps considering all constraints step by step.

Constraints to satisfy:

1. Agent must be at pos22 at least once. To do that, agent must have been at pos45 or pos41 not clear. Since pos41 is initially clear, agent must have been at pos45.

2. Agent must be at pos33 at least once. To do that, there must have been an earlier state where pos22 was not clear or agent was at pos22.

3. pos23 must be clear always.

4. pos42 must be not clear in at least one state, but only once continuously, and only after pos44 was not clear.

5. Agent must never be at pos43.

Let's start by getting the agent to pos45 to satisfy the first constraint's precondition.

Steps 1-6: Move from pos41 to pos45 via pos51, pos52, pos53, pos54, pos55, then pos45. Now at pos45. This satisfies the precondition for being at pos22 later.

Next, need to reach pos22. Path from pos45 to pos22:

pos45 → pos44 (dirup), pos44 → pos34 (dirleft), pos34 → pos24 (dirleft), pos24 → pos14 (dirleft), pos14 → pos13 (dirup), pos13 → pos12 (dirup), pos12 → pos22 (dirright). But this is a long way. Alternatively, from pos45 → pos35 (dirleft), pos35 → pos34 (dirup), pos34 → pos24 (dirleft), pos24 → pos23 (dirup) forbidden. Hmm.

Alternatively, from pos45, move left to pos44 (dirleft), then pos44 → pos43 (dirup), but pos43 is forbidden. So no. So maybe pos45 → pos35 (dirleft), pos35 → pos25 (dirleft), pos25 → pos24 (dirup), pos24 → pos14 (dirleft). Not helpful.

Alternatively, pos45 → pos35 (dirleft), pos35 → pos25 (dirleft), pos25 → pos24 (dirup), pos24 → pos14 (dirleft), pos14 → pos13 (dirup), pos13 → pos12 (dirup), pos12 → pos22 (dirright). Now, the agent is at pos22. This satisfies the first constraint.

Now, after being at pos22, the agent can move to pos33. But the constraint for pos33 requires that before being there, pos22 was not clear or agent was at pos22. Since the agent was at pos22, this is satisfied.

Now, to get to pos33, the agent needs to move from pos22 to pos32 (dirright?), then to pos33. Let's check movement options from pos22:

From pos22, you can move to pos12 (dirleft), pos32 (dirright), pos21 (dirup), or pos23 (dirdown). But pos23 must remain clear, so moving to pos23 is forbidden. So the agent can move to pos32 (dirright). Then from pos32, move to pos33 (dirdown). But pos33 has the stone. So the agent can't move there directly. They need to push the stone.

So from pos32, the agent can push the stone at pos33 to pos34 (dirdown) using the pushtogoal action if pos34 is a goal location. Wait, pos34 is not a goal location. The only goal is pos24. So pushing to pos34 would be a non-goal location. But we need to get the stone to pos24. So how?

Alternatively, the agent at pos32 can push the stone from pos33 to pos23 (dirup), but pos23 must remain clear. So that's invalid. Or push it to pos43 (dirright), but pos43 is forbidden. Or to pos34 (dirdown). But pos34 is not a goal. So that's not helpful. Wait, the only goal is pos24. So we need to push the stone to pos24.

So perhaps the agent needs to push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown), then from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft). But how to do that?

First, the agent needs to be in a position to push the stone south to pos34. To do that, the agent must be north of pos33 (pos23), but pos23 must remain clear. So that's not possible. Or south of pos33 (pos43), which is forbidden. Or east or west. Wait, the directions depend on the agent's position relative to the stone.

Wait, for the "pushtogoal" action, the agent must be at l_p such that moving in direction d from l_p reaches l_from (stone's current position), and then the stone moves in direction d to l_to. So to push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown), the agent must be at pos23 (north of pos33), move down to pos33, pushing the stone down to pos34. But pos23 must remain clear, so the agent can't be there. So this is impossible.

Similarly, pushing east to pos43 requires the agent to be west of pos33 (pos23 again), which is forbidden. Pushing west to pos23 is forbidden. Pushing north to pos23 is also forbidden. So the only possible direction is south to pos34, but that requires the agent to be at pos33's north (pos23), which is forbidden. So this seems impossible. 

Wait, maybe there's another way. What if the agent pushes the stone from pos33 to pos34 using the pushtonongoal action, then later pushes it to pos24. But pos34 to pos24 is allowed via dirleft. So to push from pos34 to pos24, the agent must be east of pos34 (pos44), then push left. But pos44 is initially clear. So agent can move to pos44, then push the stone from pos34 to pos24.

But first, the stone needs to be at pos34. How?

The only way to move the stone to pos34 is if the agent can push it there. But to do that, the agent must be able to access a position adjacent to pos33 in the direction of the push. Which seems impossible due to the constraints.

This suggests that the problem might require a more creative approach, perhaps moving the agent around to the east side and then pushing the stone west. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the stone from pos33 to pos34 from the east, but that would require the agent to be at pos34's east (pos44), but how?

Wait, let's think differently. Suppose the agent is at pos34 and pushes the stone from pos33 to pos34. But how? The stone is at pos33, and the agent is at pos34. To push the stone to pos34, the agent would need to be west of pos33 (pos23) and push east. That's not possible. Alternatively, if the agent is at pos34 and the stone is at pos33, can the agent push it north? That would move the stone to pos23, which is forbidden.

This seems like a dead end. Maybe there's a mistake in my understanding of the directions or the grid layout.

Wait, maybe the grid is arranged such that pos11 is top-left, pos15 is top-right, pos51 is bottom-left, pos55 is bottom-right. So moving right increases the column, and moving down increases the row. So pos33 is row3, column3. pos34 is row3, column4. pos24 is row2, column4. pos23 is row2, column3.

In that case, pushing the stone from pos33 to pos34 (right) would require the agent to be at pos33's west (pos32) and push east. pos32 is allowed. So agent at pos32 can push the stone east to pos33's east (pos34). But wait, the stone is at pos33. To push it east to pos34, the agent must be west of pos33 (pos32), move east to pos33 (pushing the stone east to pos34). So that's possible.

Yes! So the agent can be at pos32, then push the stone east from pos33 to pos34. Because pos32 is clear (initially). Let's check:

From pos32, the agent can move east to pos33 (dirright), but pos33 has the stone. So instead, the agent can perform a pushtonongoal action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright. This requires:

- Agent is at pos32 (yes, after moving there).
- Stone1 is at pos33 (yes).
- pos34 is clear (yes, initially).
- Can move from pos32 to pos33 following dirright (yes: pos32 to pos33 is dirdown? Wait, the direction for moving from pos32 to pos33 is dirdown according to the movement list: "You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown". So to push the stone east, the agent needs to move in the same direction as the push. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the direction in the push action must be such that from the agent's current location (l_p), moving in direction d reaches l_from (the stone's current position), and from l_from, moving in direction d reaches l_to. So for pushing the stone from pos33 to pos34 (east), the agent must be west of pos33 (pos32) and move east (dirright) to pos33, pushing the stone east to pos34. But according to the movement list, can the agent move from pos32 to pos33 following dirright? Looking at the movement list: "You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown". Oh, right, the movement from pos32 to pos33 is dirdown, not dirright. So the direction is dirdown. So to push the stone east to pos34, the agent must be at pos23 (north of pos33) and push south, but pos23 is forbidden. Alternatively, the agent must be at pos43 (south of pos33) and push north, but pos43 is forbidden.

This is really a problem. It seems like the only way to push the stone east is if the agent is at pos32 and moves down to pos33 (dirdown), pushing the stone east. Wait, but moving down from pos32 is to pos33. So the direction is dirdown. Then the stone would be pushed down to pos43. But pos43 is forbidden. No, the stone's direction would be the same as the agent's movement direction. So if the agent is at pos32 and moves down to pos33 (dirdown), pushing the stone down to pos43. But pos43 is forbidden for the agent, but the stone can be there as long as the agent isn't. However, pushing the stone to pos43 would require the agent to move to pos33, which is occupied by the stone. Wait, no. The pushtogoal/pushtonongoal actions have the agent ending up at l_from (pos33) after pushing. Wait, the effect of pushtonongoal is that the agent moves from l_p (pos32) to l_from (pos33), and the stone moves to l_to (pos34). Wait, no. Let me recheck the effects.

For "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d":

Effects:

(i) agent p is no longer at l_p (pos32)

(ii) stone s is no longer at l_from (pos33)

(iii) l_to (pos34) is no longer clear

(iv) agent p is at l_from (pos33)

(v) stone s is at l_to (pos34)

(vi) l_p (pos32) is clear

(vii) stone s is at non-goal state.

So after pushing, the agent is at pos33, and the stone is at pos34. But pos33 was the stone's previous location, which is now clear because the stone moved. So the agent can be at pos33 after the push. But the constraint requires that the agent must be at pos33 at least once. So this could satisfy that.

But wait, after pushing, the agent is at pos33, which was the stone's previous location. But pos33 is a non-goal location. So this is allowed.

However, the problem is that to perform the push, the agent must be at pos32, then push the stone from pos33 to pos34 with direction d. The preconditions are:

- agent is at l_p (pos32)

- stone is at l_from (pos33)

- l_to (pos34) is clear

- can move from l_p to l_from following direction d (pos32 to pos33 via d)

- can move from l_from to l_to following direction d (pos33 to pos34 via d)

So for this to work, direction d must be such that both movements are allowed. From pos32 to pos33, the direction is dirdown (as per movement list). From pos33 to pos34, the direction is dirdown. So yes, the direction is dirdown. So the agent can perform pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown.

This would move the stone from pos33 to pos34, and the agent ends up at pos33. This satisfies the requirement that the agent is at pos33 in some state. Also, the precondition for being at pos33 is that earlier, the agent was at pos22 or pos22 was not clear. Since the agent was at pos22 earlier (step where they moved to pos22), this is satisfied.

Then, the stone is at pos34. Now, the agent needs to push it to pos24. To do that, the agent is at pos33. From there, they can move to pos34 (dirdown), but pos34 now has the stone. So the agent can't move there. Alternatively, move to pos32 (dirup), then pos32 to pos22 (dirleft). But how to push the stone from pos34 to pos24.

The stone is at pos34. To push it to pos24 (which is west of pos34), the agent needs to be east of pos34 (pos44) and push west. But pos44 is initially clear. So the agent can move to pos44, then push the stone west to pos24.

So steps:

After pushing the stone to pos34, the agent is at pos33. Now, they need to move to pos44 to push the stone west.

From pos33, the agent can move right to pos34 (dirright?), but pos34 has the stone. So no. Alternatively, move down to pos43 (dirdown), but pos43 is forbidden. So that's not possible. Or move left to pos32 (dirleft), then from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft). Then from pos22, move right to pos32, then up to pos33. Wait, not helpful.

Alternatively, the agent at pos33 can move up to pos23 (dirup), but pos23 must remain clear. So forbidden. Hmm.

Wait, after the first push, the agent is at pos33. From there, they can move to pos34 (dirdown) if it's clear. But pos34 has the stone. So can't move there. So the agent is stuck at pos33. How to get out?

Wait, the agent can move from pos33 to pos32 (dirup), since after pushing, pos33 is clear. So from pos33, the agent can move up to pos32 (dirup). Then from pos32, move left to pos22 (dirleft). Then from pos22, move left to pos12 (dirleft), etc. But we need to get to pos44 to push the stone to pos24.

Alternatively, from pos33, the agent can move right to pos34 (dirright) if possible. But pos34 has the stone, so it's not clear. So no. So agent at pos33 can only move up to pos32 or left to pos23 (forbidden), or down to pos43 (forbidden). So the only valid move is up to pos32.

So steps:

After pushing the stone to pos34 (agent at pos33):

1. Move from pos33 to pos32 (dirup).

Now agent is at pos32. Then, need to move to pos44 to push the stone west to pos24.

Path from pos32 to pos44:

pos32 → pos42 (dirright). But pos42 is clear. Then from pos42 → pos43 (dirdown) forbidden. Alternatively, pos32 → pos31 (dirup), then pos31 → pos41 (dirright), then pos41 → pos51 (dirright), etc. Not helpful. 

Alternatively, from pos32 → pos42 (dirright) is possible. But pos42 is clear. So agent can move to pos42. But this requires:

Check movement options from pos32: "You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos32 to location pos31 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown". So yes, pos32 → pos42 (dirright).

So step:

2. Move from pos32 to pos42 (dirright).

Now agent is at pos42. This satisfies the constraint that pos42 is not clear in at least one state. But according to another constraint, before pos42 is not clear, pos44 must be not clear. So the agent needs to be at pos44 before being at pos42. But currently, the agent is at pos42 without having been at pos44. This violates the constraint. Therefore, this path is invalid.

So the agent must first be at pos44 to satisfy the constraint that pos44 is not clear before pos42 is not clear.

So how to get to pos44 from pos32.

Possible path:

pos32 → pos42 (dirright), but need to go to pos44 first. Alternative route:

From pos32, move to pos42 (dirright), then from pos42 move to pos52 (dirright), then pos52 → pos53 (dirdown), pos53 → pos54 (dirdown), pos54 → pos55 (dirdown), pos55 → pos45 (dirleft), pos45 → pos44 (dirleft), pos44 is now occupied. Then, from pos44, move to pos34 (dirleft), but this is getting complicated.

This suggests that the agent must first visit pos44 before visiting pos42. So after pushing the stone to pos34 and being at pos33, the agent needs to move to pos44 first.

But how?

From pos33, agent can move up to pos32, then from pos32 to pos42 (dirright), but that would require visiting pos42 before pos44. So violating the constraint. Hmm.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos34 and being at pos33, the agent needs to move to pos44 somehow. From pos33, possible moves are up to pos32 or down to pos43 (forbidden). So pos32 is the only way. From pos32, the agent can move right to pos42. But then, to get to pos44, the agent would need to move from pos42 to pos43 (forbidden) or pos42 to pos52. Not helpful.

This seems like a dead end. Perhaps the only way to satisfy the pos44 constraint is to visit pos44 before pos42. So earlier in the plan.

Let's revise the steps:

After getting to pos45 (step 6), the agent needs to move to pos44 to satisfy the pos44 not clear before pos42 is not clear.

So from pos45:

7. Move to pos44 (dirleft).

Now, pos44 is not clear (agent is there). Then, later when the agent is at pos42, this satisfies the constraint that pos44 was not clear before pos42 is not clear.

Then, from pos44, the agent can move to pos34 (dirleft), then pos34 → pos24 (dirleft). But again, the stone is at pos34. So the agent can push the stone from pos34 to pos24.

Wait, but the stone is currently at pos34. So to push it to pos24 (a goal location), the agent can use the pushtogoal action. The agent must be at a position adjacent to pos34 in the direction of the push. To push pos34 west to pos24, the agent must be east of pos34 (pos44) and push west. So agent at pos44 can push the stone from pos34 to pos24.

So steps:

After step 7 (agent at pos44):

8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos24 dirleft.

This requires:

- Agent is at pos44 (yes).

- Stone is at pos34 (yes).

- pos24 is clear (yes, initially).

- Can move from pos44 to pos34 following dirleft (yes, movement from pos44 to pos34 is dirleft).

- Can move from pos34 to pos24 following dirleft (yes, movement from pos34 to pos24 is dirleft).

- pos24 is a goal location (yes).

So this action is valid. After performing this, the stone is at pos24 (goal achieved), and the agent moves to pos34.

But then we need to check the constraints. The agent must be at pos33 at least once, which was achieved earlier when pushing the stone to pos34. Also, the agent must be at pos22, which we need to handle.

But wait, in this revised plan, when does the agent visit pos22? Let's recap:

1. Move to pos45 (steps 1-6).

2. Move to pos44 (step7).

3. Push stone to pos24 (step8).

But this skips visiting pos22. So we still need to visit pos22.

So the agent must visit pos22 at some point after pos45 but before the final steps. But after pushing the stone to pos24, the goal is achieved, but the agent still needs to satisfy the pos22 constraint.

So perhaps the plan should be:

After step6 (agent at pos45), move to pos44 (step7), then move to pos34 (step8: dirleft), then move to pos24 (step9: dirleft), then move to pos14 (step10: dirleft), then move to pos13 (step11: dirup), then move to pos12 (step12: dirup), then move to pos22 (step13: dirright). This way, the agent visits pos22 after being at pos45. But this requires a lot of steps.

But this also requires that the stone is already at pos24 before the agent starts moving to pos22. So the goal would be achieved early, but the agent still needs to fulfill the pos22 constraint. However, the problem's goal is to have the stone at a goal location, and other constraints must be satisfied during the plan.

But the constraint says that the agent must be at pos22 in at least one state. So even if the stone is already at the goal, the agent must still visit pos22.

So in this case, after pushing the stone to pos24 (step8), the agent is at pos34. Then, the agent can move to pos24 (step9: dirleft), then pos24 → pos23 (dirup) forbidden, so move to pos14 (step9: dirleft). pos14 → pos13 (dirup), pos13 → pos12 (dirup), pos12 → pos22 (dirright). Now the agent is at pos22, satisfying the constraint. But this requires several steps after the stone is already at the goal.

But the plan must be optimal, with the shortest possible steps. So perhaps there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, after step8 (stone at pos24, agent at pos34), the agent can move to pos24 (dirleft), then move up to pos23 (forbidden), or down to pos25 (dirdown), then from pos25 to pos24 (dirup), but not helpful. So the agent needs to go back to the earlier path.

But this is getting too long. Given the time constraints, let's try to compile the steps:

Initial steps to get to pos45:

1. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright

2. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown

3. move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown

4. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown

5. move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown

6. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft

Then move to pos44:

7. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirleft

Now pos44 is not clear. Then move to pos34:

8. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft

Then push the stone from pos34 to pos24:

9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos34 pos24 dirleft

Wait, no. The stone is at pos34, and the agent is at pos34. To push it west to pos24, the agent must be east of pos34 (pos44), but the agent is at pos34. So this is incorrect.

Wait, the correct way is to have the agent at pos44 (east of pos34), then push west to pos24. So after step7 (agent at pos44), then:

8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos24 dirleft.

This requires:

- Agent at pos44 (yes)

- Stone at pos34 (yes)

- pos24 clear (yes)

- Can move from pos44 to pos34 dirleft (yes, movement from pos44 to pos34 is dirleft)

- Can move from pos34 to pos24 dirleft (yes)

- pos24 is a goal (yes)

After this, the stone is at pos24, and the agent moves to pos34.

Now, the agent needs to visit pos22. From pos34, move to pos24 (dirleft), then pos24 → pos14 (dirleft), then pos14 → pos13 (dirup), pos13 → pos12 (dirup), pos12 → pos22 (dirright). So steps:

9. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft

10. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft

11. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup

12. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup

13. move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright

Now, the agent is at pos22. This satisfies the constraint.

But also, the agent must be at pos33 at least once. Earlier, when pushing the stone from pos33 to pos34, the agent was at pos33. So that's satisfied.

Additionally, the agent must ensure that pos42 is not clear in at least one state. This happened when the agent moved to pos42 in some step. But in the current plan, the agent never went to pos42. So this constraint is not met. Therefore, we need to include a step where pos42 is not clear.

But according to the constraints, pos42 must be not clear in at least one state, and before that, pos44 must be not clear. In the current plan, pos44 is not clear (step7), and pos42 is clear. So to make pos42 not clear, the agent needs to move there after step7.

So after step7 (agent at pos44), maybe:

8. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft (to push the stone, but no. Wait, the stone is at pos34 after step8. So perhaps after step7 (agent at pos44), before pushing the stone, the agent moves to pos42. But then pos44 is clear again. Hmm.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone (step8), the agent is at pos34. Then, they can move to pos44 (dirright), then pos44 → pos54 (dirright), pos54 → pos55 (dirdown), but this doesn't help.

Alternatively, after step8 (agent at pos34), move to pos44 (dirright), then to pos42 (dirleft):

9. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

10. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup → forbidden.

No. Alternatively, from pos44, move to pos34 (dirleft), not helpful. This is getting too complex.

Perhaps an alternative plan where after step7 (agent at pos44), they move to pos42:

8. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft (no, pos34 is clear? Wait, after step7, the agent is at pos44. The stone is at pos34 (since we haven't pushed it yet). So pos34 is clear because the stone is at pos33. Wait, no. Initial stone is at pos33. Earlier steps involve pushing it to pos34. But in the current plan, after step6 (agent at pos45), step7: move to pos44. Then step8: pushtogoal from pos44 to pos34 to pos24. But the stone is at pos34 after the push.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:

In the initial state, the stone is at pos33.

First, the agent must push the stone to pos34. To do that, the agent must be at pos32 and push it down to pos34. This requires:

After the agent is at pos45 (step6), they need to move to pos32. But how?

Wait, maybe the earlier approach of pushing the stone first, then handling the constraints. Let me try to outline a plan that satisfies all constraints:

1. Move agent from pos41 to pos51 (dirright)

2. pos51 to pos52 (dirdown)

3. pos52 to pos53 (dirdown)

4. pos53 to pos54 (dirdown)

5. pos54 to pos55 (dirdown)

6. pos55 to pos45 (dirleft) → agent at pos45 (satisfies pos45 precondition for pos22)

7. pos45 to pos44 (dirleft) → agent at pos44 (satisfies pos44 not clear before pos42)

8. pos44 to pos34 (dirleft) → agent at pos34

9. pos34 to pos24 (dirleft) → agent at pos24

10. pos24 to pos14 (dirleft) → agent at pos14

11. pos14 to pos13 (dirup) → agent at pos13

12. pos13 to pos12 (dirup) → agent at pos12

13. pos12 to pos22 (dirright) → agent at pos22 (satisfies first constraint)

14. pos22 to pos32 (dirright) → agent at pos32

15. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown → agent at pos33, stone at pos34

16. pos33 to pos32 (dirup) → agent at pos32

17. pos32 to pos42 (dirright) → agent at pos42 (satisfies pos42 not clear)

18. pos42 to pos32 (dirleft) → agent at pos32

19. pos32 to pos22 (dirleft) → agent at pos22

20. pos22 to pos32 (dirright) → agent at pos32

21. pos32 to pos34 (dirdown) → agent at pos34

22. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos34 pos24 dirleft → invalid because stone is at pos34, and pushtogoal requires l_from to have the stone. Wait, stone is at pos34, so this action would push it from pos34 to pos24.

Yes, this would be:

22. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos34 pos24 dirleft.

But this requires:

- Agent at pos34 (yes)

- Stone at pos34 (yes)

- pos24 clear (yes)

- Can move from pos34 to pos34 following dirleft (no, because pos34 to pos24 is dirleft, but the agent is already at pos34. Wait, the direction must be such that from l_p (pos34) to l_from (pos34) is dirleft. But pos34 to pos34 is not a valid move. So this is invalid.

Correct approach: the agent must be east of pos34 (pos44) to push west to pos24. So after step17 (agent at pos42), they need to get back to pos44.

This is getting too convoluted. Given time constraints, I'll try to provide a step-by-step plan that satisfies all constraints, even if it's not the shortest, but optimally as possible.

Final plan outline:

1. Move agent to pos45 via pos51, pos52, pos53, pos54, pos55.

2. Move to pos44.

3. Move to pos34.

4. Move to pos24.

5. Move to pos14.

6. Move to pos13.

7. Move to pos12.

8. Move to pos22.

9. Move to pos32.

10. Push stone from pos33 to pos34.

11. Move to pos32.

12. Move to pos42 (satisfies pos42 not clear, after pos44 was not clear).

13. Move back to pos32.

14. Move to pos34.

15. Push stone to pos24.

This satisfies the constraints:

- Agent is at pos22 (step8).

- Before pos22, agent was at pos45 (step1-6).

- pos23 is always clear.

- pos42 is not clear in step12, and before that, pos44 was not clear (step2).

- Agent is at pos33 in step10 after pushing.

- Before pos33, agent was at pos32 (step9) which is after pos22 (step8).

- pos22 not clear only once (step8).

- pos42 not clear once.

- Agent never at pos43.

This is the best I can do under time pressure. Now, translating this into actions with correct syntax.
