Let me analyze this Sokoban-style planning problem. I'll start by understanding the game layout, my current state, and my goal:

- We have a 5x5 grid with positions labeled `pos11` through `pos55`
- The player (`player1`) starts at position `pos15` (top-right corner)
- There's a stone (`stone1`) at position `pos44`
- The goal location is `pos41`
- I need to move the stone to the goal location

Let me also understand the constraints:
1. Position `pos35` must always remain clear
2. At some point, either `pos55` must be occupied OR the stone must be at `pos24`
3. The player can never be at position `pos35`
4. The player must visit position `pos25` at some point
5. If the player is at `pos25`, then before this `pos45` must have been occupied
6. At some point, either `pos55` must be occupied OR the player must be at `pos21`
7. The player can never be at position `pos43`
8. The stone can never be at position `pos42`

Now, let me visualize the grid to better understand the problem:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1 [ ][ ][ ][ ][P]
2 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
3 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
4 [G][ ][ ][S][ ]
5 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
```

where P is the player, S is the stone, G is the goal, and [ ] represents empty spaces.

To move the stone to the goal (from pos44 to pos41), I need to:
1. Get to a position where I can push the stone (probably pos34 or pos45)
2. Push the stone westward from pos44 to pos43
3. Push the stone westward from pos43 to pos42
4. Push the stone westward from pos42 to pos41

Let's think about constraints: 
- I can't put the stone at pos42 (constraint 8)
- I can't have the player at pos43 (constraint 7)
- I can't have the player at pos35 (constraint 3)
- I need to put the player at pos25 at some point (constraint 4)
- Before having the player at pos25, I need to have pos45 occupied (constraint 5)

Let me reconsider. If I can't have the stone at pos42, I can't push it directly from pos44 to pos41. I need to find another path.

Actually, let me analyze the initial condition again. The stone starts at pos44, and we need to move it to the goal at pos41. But constraint 8 says the stone can never be at pos42. This means we can't directly push the stone from pos44 to pos43 to pos42 to pos41, as that would violate the constraint.

Let's think about alternative paths. Perhaps we need to go around from the top or bottom of the grid?

The grid connections seem to allow horizontal and vertical movements only. So to get from pos44 to pos41 without going through pos42, I'd need to:
1. Push the stone from pos44 to pos43
2. Push the stone from pos43 to pos33
3. Push the stone from pos33 to pos32
4. Push the stone from pos32 to pos31
5. Push the stone from pos31 to pos41

Let me check if this path violates any constraints:
- The stone never goes through pos42, satisfying constraint 8
- The player would need to go to pos33, pos32, pos31, etc., which isn't explicitly prohibited
- We need to ensure the player visits pos25 and before that, pos45 is occupied
- We need to ensure either pos55 is occupied or the stone is at pos24 at some point
- We need to ensure either pos55 is occupied or the player is at pos21 at some point

So it seems we might need to deliberately create a situation where pos45 is occupied before the player goes to pos25, and also ensure one of the other conditions is met.

Now let's think about the actual plan. I'll start by figuring out how to get the player to pos45 to push the stone:

1. From pos15, move to pos14 (dirup)
2. From pos14, move to pos13 (dirup)
3. From pos13, move to pos23 (dirright)
4. From pos23, move to pos33 (dirright)
5. From pos33, move to pos34 (dirdown)
6. From pos34, move to pos35 (dirdown)
7. From pos35, move to pos45 (dirright)

Oops, we can't have the player at pos35 (constraint 3). Let's find another route:

1. From pos15, move to pos25 (dirright)
2. From pos25, move to pos35 (dirright)

Oops, that also goes through pos35. Let's try another route:

1. From pos15, move to pos14 (dirup)
2. From pos14, move to pos24 (dirright)
3. From pos24, move to pos34 (dirright)
4. From pos34, move to pos44 (dirright)

Wait, pos44 is where the stone is. So we can't get there. Let's try another approach:

1. From pos15, move to pos14 (dirup)
2. From pos14, move to pos24 (dirright)
3. From pos24, move to pos34 (dirright)
4. From pos34, move to pos43 (dirup)

But we can't have the player at pos43 (constraint 7). This is getting tricky.

Let's try a different approach. Let's use a different initial route:

1. From pos15, move to pos25 (dirright)
2. From pos25, move to pos24 (dirup)
3. From pos24, move to pos34 (dirright)
4. From pos34, move to pos45 (dirdown)

But to satisfy constraint 5, we need pos45 to be occupied before the player is at pos25. So this route won't work directly.

Let me try a different approach:

1. From pos15, move to pos14 (dirup)
2. From pos14, move to pos13 (dirup)
3. From pos13, move to pos12 (dirup)
4. From pos12, move to pos11 (dirup)
5. From pos11, move to pos21 (dirright)
6. From pos21, move to pos31 (dirright)
7. From pos31, move to pos41 (dirright)
8. From pos41, move to pos42 (dirdown)
9. From pos42, move to pos43 (dirdown)
10. From pos43 to pos44 (dirdown) - this places the player at pos43, which violates constraint 7

This is also not working.

Actually, let me think of it from the end goal. If the stone needs to be at pos41, and the player can push the stone, the player must be at pos51, pos42, or pos31 to push the stone into pos41.

- If the player is at pos51 and the stone is at pos41, then the player pushed the stone from pos42 to pos41. But constraint 8 says the stone can't be at pos42.
- If the player is at pos31 and the stone is at pos41, then the player pushed the stone from pos31 to pos41. But this doesn't make sense - the player and stone can't occupy the same position.
- If the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos41, then the player pushed the stone from pos42 to pos41. But constraint 8 says the stone can't be at pos42.

Wait a moment, I'm making an error in my reasoning. The player pushes the stone, so the stone starts at pos44 and the player is not at pos44, but can be adjacent to it.

Let's be more precise about the problem. To satisfy the goal, I need to have "stone1 is at a goal location". The only goal location is pos41.

Let me rethink. I need to move the stone from pos44 to pos41, and the constraint says the stone can never be at pos42.

So the only valid path for the stone would be:
pos44 -> pos43 -> pos33 -> pos32 -> pos31 -> pos41

To make this happen, the player would need to push the stone from positions:
pos45 -> pos44 -> pos43 -> pos33 -> pos32 -> pos31

But constraint 7 says the player can never be at pos43. So this path won't work.

Let me think about other possibilities. If the player can't be at pos43, but the stone needs to move from pos44 to pos41 without going through pos42, maybe there's another approach.

Let's see if there's a path where the player pushes the stone from behind (to the right of the stone), rather than from the front:

For the stone to go from pos44 to pos41, the player would need to be at positions:
pos54 -> pos53 -> pos43 -> pos42 -> pos32 -> pos31

But constraint 7 prohibits the player from being at pos43, and constraint 8 prohibits the stone from being at pos42.

Maybe there's another path from above or below?

If the player pushes the stone from above:
pos34 -> pos33 -> pos23 -> pos22 -> pos21 -> pos31

This would make the stone path:
pos44 -> pos43 -> pos33 -> pos23 -> pos22 -> pos21 -> pos31 -> pos41

This still has the stone going through positions that don't violate any constraints, but the player would need to be at pos43 at some point, which violates constraint 7.

What if the player pushes the stone from below?
pos54 -> pos53 -> pos43 -> pos33 -> pos23 -> pos22 -> pos21 -> pos31

This would make the stone path:
pos44 -> pos54 -> pos53 -> pos43 -> pos33 -> pos23 -> pos22 -> pos21 -> pos31 -> pos41

This still has the player going through pos43, which violates constraint 7.

This is getting quite complex. Let me rethink the problem.

Looking at the constraints again:
1. Position `pos35` must always remain clear
2. At some point, either `pos55` must be occupied OR the stone must be at `pos24`
3. The player can never be at position `pos35`
4. The player must visit position `pos25` at some point
5. If the player is at `pos25`, then before this `pos45` must have been occupied
6. At some point, either `pos55` must be occupied OR the player must be at `pos21`
7. The player can never be at position `pos43`
8. The stone can never be at position `pos42`

Let's focus on constraint 5: If the player is at pos25, then pos45 must have been occupied earlier. The only way to occupy pos45 is with either the player or the stone. But since the player can't be at pos43 (constraint 7), the player can't push the stone to pos45 directly. So, pos45 must be occupied by the player at some point.

Let's also look at constraint 2: At some point, either pos55 must be occupied OR the stone must be at pos24. If we choose to have the stone at pos24, the player would need to push it there, which implies the player would be at pos25. But by constraint 5, pos45 must be occupied before the player is at pos25.

OK so let's try to sequence things:
1. First, player occupies pos45
2. Then, player goes to pos25
3. At some point, either pos55 is occupied or the stone is at pos24 (for constraint 2)
4. At some point, either pos55 is occupied or the player is at pos21 (for constraint 6)
5. Eventually the stone ends up at pos41 without ever going through pos42 (for constraint 8)

Let's try to find a valid plan. We'll start by moving the player to pos45:

1. Move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
2. Move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
3. Move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
4. Move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

But, pos44 is where the stone is.

Maybe we can go around:

1. Move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
2. Move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
3. Move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
4. Move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
5. Move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
6. Move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright
7. Move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
8. Move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown
9. Move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft

But constraint 7 says the player can't be at pos43.

Hmm, we can't seem to reach pos45 without violating constraints or going through occupied spaces.

Let's try a different route:

1. Move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright (this violates constraint 5, as pos45 isn't occupied yet)

Maybe we need to use the stone to our advantage. If the stone is blocking a location, the player can push it, which moves the stone and the player. Let's see if we can use this to reach pos45 and then pos25.

Let's try this approach:
1. Move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
2. Move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
3. Move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
4. Move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup
5. Move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright
6. Move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
7. Move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
8. Move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
9. Move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
10. Move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
11. Move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
12. Move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown
13. Move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft
14. Move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft (this violates constraint 3, as the player can't be at pos35)

So even going all the way around, we'll still face issues satisfying the constraints.

Ok, I've figured out another approach. The constraints don't prohibit having the stone at pos45. What if we move the stone to pos45?

Here's a potential path:
1. Move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
2. Move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
3. Move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
4. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos45 dirdown (player at pos34, stone moved from pos44 to pos45, player now at pos44)
5. Move player1 pos44 pos34 dirup
6. Move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
7. Move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown (this is valid because pos45 is now occupied by the stone, satisfying constraint 5)

So now, we've moved the player to pos25 and satisfied constraint 5. We also satisfied constraint 6 by having pos55 not clear (the stone is at pos45, making pos55 not clear, though this is a silly point since pos55 is clear).

Next, let's satisfy constraint 2 by having the stone at pos24:

8. Move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright (this violates constraint 3, as the player can't be at pos35)

Oh, this is getting complex. Let's take a step back.

Looking at the constraints again, I realize I may have been misinterpreting constraint 6. It says "At some point, either pos55 must be occupied OR the player must be at pos21." So we can satisfy this constraint by having the player at pos21 at some point.

Also, for constraint 2, we need to have either pos55 occupied or the stone at pos24 at some point. 

And for constraint 5, before the player is at pos25, pos45 must be occupied.

So, we can use a different strategy. Let's first move the player to pos21, then have the stone at pos24, and finally get the stone to the goal pos41:

1. Move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
2. Move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
3. Move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
4. Move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup
5. Move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright (player at pos21, satisfying constraint 6)
6. Move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown
7. Move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
8. Move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
9. Move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
10. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos43 dirleft (this violates constraint 7, as the player would end up at pos43)

We still can't seem to satisfy all the constraints. Let's reevaluate.

I'm having a hard time finding a path where the player can reach pos45 without violating any constraints. But, maybe we don't need to. Constraint 5 says "If expression player1 is at location pos25 holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: Location pos45 is not clear." This implies that if the player is never at pos25, we don't need to worry about this constraint.

But constraint 4 says "The player must visit position pos25 at some point." So we still need to satisfy the requirement that pos45 is not clear before the player is at pos25.

Let's think outside the box. What if the stone starts at pos45? No, that's not the case; the stone is at pos44.

Maybe we can have the player go around the top of the grid and approach pos45 from pos55:

1. Move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
2. Move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
3. Move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
4. Move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup
5. Move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright
6. Move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
7. Move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
8. Move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
9. Move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
10. Move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
11. Move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
12. Move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown (position pos55 is occupied, which can satisfy constraint 2 and 6)
13. Move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft (player is at pos45, and pos45 is not clear)
14. Move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup (player at pos44, stone is pushed to pos43)
15. Move player1 pos44 pos34 dirup
16. Move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
17. Move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown (player at pos25, pos45 was not clear earlier, satisfying constraint 4 and 5)

Wait, I messed up on step 14. If the player is at pos45 and moves to pos44, the stone is pushed from pos44 to pos43. This contradicts constraint 7, which says the player can't be at pos43. Oh wait, I'm confusing things. The player would be at pos44, not pos43. Let me rethink.

Actually, let's focus on the core actions explicitly:

If the player is at position (x, y) and the stone is at position (x+1, y), then if the player moves dirright, the player would end up at (x+1, y) and push the stone to (x+2, y).

Now, in step 14, the player is at pos45 and moving dirup to pos44. But this doesn't automatically push the stone; the player would just move to pos44 where the stone is, which isn't allowed. When pushing, the player and the stone both move.

Let me start over and be more precise:

To push the stone, the player must be on the opposite side of the direction they want to push. So to push the stone from pos44 to pos43 (left direction), the player must be at pos45.

Let's re-examine the constraints and try a new approach:

1. Position `pos35` must always remain clear
2. At some point, either `pos55` must be occupied OR the stone must be at `pos24`
3. The player can never be at position `pos35`
4. The player must visit position `pos25` at some point
5. If the player is at `pos25`, then before this `pos45` must have been occupied
6. At some point, either `pos55` must be occupied OR the player must be at `pos21`
7. The player can never be at position `pos43`
8. The stone can never be at position `pos42`

Here's a potential plan:

1. Move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
2. Move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
3. Move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
4. Move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup
5. Move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright (player at pos21, which can satisfy constraint 6)
6. Move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
7. Move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
8. Move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
9. Move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
10. Move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
11. Move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
12. Move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown (pos55 is occupied, which can satisfy constraints 2 and 6)
13. Move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft (pos45 is occupied)
14. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirleft (player at pos45, stone moved from pos44 to pos43, player now at pos44)
15. Move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown
16. Move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft (this violates constraint 3, as the player can't be at pos35)

It's challenging to find a path to pos25 without putting the player at pos35, especially since we need to have pos45 occupied before the player is at pos25.

Let me try it from a different angle:
1. Move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
2. Move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
3. Move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
4. Move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup
5. Move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright (player at pos21, which can satisfy constraint 6)
6. Move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
7. Move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
8. Move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
9. Move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
10. Move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
11. Move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
12. Move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown (position pos55 is occupied, which can satisfy constraints 2 and 6)
13. Move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft (pos45 is occupied)
14. Move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup (player at pos44, stone is at pos44, which isn't allowed)

The above doesn't work because the player can't move to a position with the stone.

OK, we need to push the stone. From the action types, to push we would use either pushtogoal or pushtonongoal. Let's try again:

1. Move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
2. Move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
3. Move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
4. Move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup
5. Move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright (player at pos21, which can satisfy constraint 6)
6. Move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
7. Move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
8. Move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
9. Move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
10. Move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
11. Move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
12. Move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown (position pos55 is occupied, which can satisfy constraints 2 and 6)
13. Move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft (pos45 is occupied)
14. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirleft (player at pos45, stone moved from pos44 to pos43, player now at pos44)
15. PushToGoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos41 dirleft (player at pos44, stone moved from pos43 to pos41 (goal), player now at pos43) - This violates constraint 7, as the player can't be at pos43.

Ok, this still doesn't work.

Let's try to approach the problem differently:
1. Move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
2. Move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
3. Move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
4. Move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup
5. Move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright (player at pos21, which can satisfy constraint 6)
6. Move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown
7. Move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
8. Move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
9. Move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown (player at pos25, but we still haven't satisfied constraint 5 by having pos45 occupied earlier)

It seems like we're in a loop. Let's try to find a path to meet the constraints.

Actually, let me check: does the stone have to be at a goal location at the very end of the plan, or can it be at a goal location any time during the plan?

Reading the problem specs, it says "The task is to bring about the following situation: stone1 is at a goal location." So, I just need to make sure that at the end of the plan, the stone is at a goal location.

So, the stone ends at pos41, the only goal location. Let's try to find a plan to get there.

Let's see if any other actions can be used to push the stone to the goal without violating the constraints.

Actually, let me clarify the meanings of the actions:
- "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d" means the player is at l_p, pushes stone s from l_from to goal location l_to in direction d. This leaves the player at l_from.
- "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d" is similar but the stone goes to a non-goal location.

Let me approach the problem again. The stone starts at pos44. To get to goal loc41, the stone must go west (left). Given the constraints, the stone can't go through pos42.

So the stone must follow this path:
pos44 -> pos43 -> pos33 -> pos23 -> pos22 -> pos21 -> pos31 -> pos41

To push the stone along that path, the player must be at these positions:
pos45 -> pos44 -> pos34 -> pos24 -> pos23 -> pos22 -> pos32

For this, we'd do the following:
1. Move the player to pos45
2. PushToNonGoal from pos44 to pos43
3. Move player to pos34
4. PushToNonGoal from pos43 to pos33
5. Move player to pos24
6. PushToNonGoal from pos33 to pos23
7. Move player to pos13
8. PushToNonGoal from pos23 to pos13
9. Move player to pos12
10. PushToNonGoal from pos13 to pos12
11. Move player to pos11
12. PushToNonGoal from pos12 to pos11
13. Move player to pos21
14. PushToNonGoal from pos11 to pos21
15. Move player to pos31
16. PushToGoal from pos21 to pos41

But wait, I made a mistake. My player's position and the stone's position can't be the same. Let me re-layout the positions

OK, here's the stone's path:
pos44 -> pos43 -> pos33 -> pos23 -> pos13 -> pos12 -> pos11 -> pos21 -> pos31 -> pos41

To push the stone along this path, the player must be at these positions (just before pushing):
pos45 -> pos44 -> pos34 -> pos24 -> pos14 -> pos13 -> pos12 -> pos22 -> pos32

Let's see if any of these violate the constraints:
-player at pos43? No, the player is not at pos43, only the stone.
-stone at pos42? No, the stone isn't at pos42 at any point.
-player at pos35? No, the player is not at pos35 at any point.

But there's still the constraint that pos45 must be occupied before the player is at pos25. I'm not seeing a clear path for the player to be at pos25 with pos45 previously occupied. Actually though I'm not sure if we need to involve the player being at pos25 at all or if we can avoid it. Let's check:

Constraint 4: "The player must visit position `pos25` at some point."
Looks like we do need to have the player visit pos25.

Let me re-approach and see if we can develop a plan that satisfies all the constraints.

New plan:
1. Player moves to pos45
2. Player pushes stone from pos44 to pos43
3. Player moves to pos25 (since pos45 is now unoccupied, we previously satisfied constraint 5 by having pos45 occupied)
4. Player moves to pos24
5. Player pushes stone from pos43 to pos33
6. ... continue towards the goal

Let's try to lay this out:
1. Move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
2. Move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
3. Move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
4. Move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup
5. Move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright (player at pos21, which can satisfy constraint 6)
6. Move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
7. Move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
8. Move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
9. Move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
10. Move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
11. Move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
12. Move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown (pos55 is occupied, which can satisfy constraints 2 and 6)
13. Move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft (pos45 is occupied)
14. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirleft (player at pos45, stone moved from pos44 to pos43, player now at pos44)
15. Move player1 pos44 pos34 dirup
16. Move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
17. Move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown (player at pos25, and pos45 was occupied earlier, satisfying constraint 4 and 5)
18. Move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
19. Move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
20. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos43 pos33 dirup (player at pos34, stone moved from pos43 to pos33, player now at pos43) - This violates constraint 7, as the player can't be at pos43.

Hmm, we're still stuck with the player ending up at pos43 after pushing the stone from pos43 to pos33.

Let me try to sidestep this issue. From the constraints, we know the player must visit pos25, but the player can't be at pos43 or pos35. And the stone can't be at pos42. The stone starts at pos44, and the goal is to get it to pos41.

What if the stone went pos44 -> pos54 -> pos53 -> ... -> pos41?

Let's see:
pos44 -> pos54 -> pos53 -> pos52 -> pos51 -> pos41

This seems like a plausible path that doesn't violate constraints, and it also requires the player to be at positions:
pos34 -> pos44 -> pos53 -> pos52 -> pos51

No pos43, and no pos42 for the stone. Let's plan with this route:

1. Move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
2. Move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
3. Move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
4. Move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup
5. Move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright (player at pos21, which can satisfy constraint 6)
6. Move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown
7. Move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
8. Move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
9. Move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
10. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright (player pushes stone to pos54)
11. Move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown (because pos45 needs to be occupied before we can have the player at pos25)
12. Move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright (pos55 is occupied, which can satisfy constraints 2 and 6)
13. Move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
14. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos54 pos53 dirleft (player pushes stone to pos53)
15. Move player1 pos54 pos44 dirup
16. Move player1 pos44 pos34 dirup
17. Move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
18. Move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown (player at pos25, and pos45 was occupied earlier, satisfying constraint 4 and 5)
19. Move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright
20. Move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright

But this violates constraint 3, which says the player can't be at pos35.

I'm having a hard time finding a valid plan with all these constraints. Let me approach the problem systematically.

Actually, I think there might be some ambiguity in the problem setup. If I give up on having the player at pos25 (even though that's a requirement), maybe I can still get the stone to the goal?

Let's say we get the stone to pos41 via this path:
pos44 -> pos34 -> pos24 -> pos14 -> pos13 -> pos12 -> pos11 -> pos21 -> pos31 -> pos41

Would that still be a solution?

I'm not sure if the stone can be pushed up, given the available actions. Let me reevaluate.

For "pushtogoal" and "pushtonongoal" actions, the player must be on the opposite side of the direction they want to push. So to push a stone upwards (dirup), the player must be below the stone.

OK let's say we're looking at this path:
pos44 -> pos34 -> pos24 -> pos14

This requires the player to push from:
pos54 -> pos44 -> pos34 -> pos24

In fact, if the player is at pos54 and the stone at pos44, the player can push the stone to pos34. 

Let me adjust the plan:

1. Move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
2. Move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
3. Move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
4. Move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
5. Move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
6. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirup (the stone is at pos34, and this satisfies constraint 2 by having the stone at pos24 in a later state)
7. Move player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft (player at pos43, violating constraint 7)

Hmm, I got stuck again. This constraint set seems like it's making the problem infeasible.

That said, I understood from constraint 2 is: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: At least one of the following conditions is true: 'Location pos55 is not clear', 'stone1 is at location pos24'" So, we need to make sure that either pos55 is occupied at some point or the stone is at pos24 at some point.

And from constraint 6: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: At least one of the following conditions is true: 'Location pos55 is not clear', 'player1 is at location pos21'" Similar to constraint 2, either pos55 is occupied or the player is at pos21 at some point.

Let's first try to see if having the stone at pos24 is viable:

pos44 -> pos34 -> pos24 (Goal condition for constraint 2 met!)
pos24 -> pos14 -> pos13 -> pos12 -> pos11 -> pos21 -> pos31 -> pos41

But to push the stone up, the player needs to be below the stone, which gives:
pos54 -> pos44 -> pos34 (Player is at pos34 after pushing stone to pos24)

It seems viable. Let's continue the plan:

1. Move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
2. Move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
3. Move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
4. Move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
5. Move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
6. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirup (player pushes stone from pos44 to pos34, player is now at pos44)
7. Move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown (pos45 is occupied, which will help satisfy constraint 5 later)
8. Move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft (violates constraint 3, as the player can't be at pos35)

OK, so I'm having a hard time finding a path to pos25 that doesn't violate constraints. We need to be more creative.

Here's a different route for the stone:
pos44 -> pos54 -> pos53 -> pos52 -> pos51 -> pos41

For the player to push the stone along this route, the player must be at:
pos34 -> pos44 -> pos54 -> pos53 -> pos52

Is there a way to get the player to pos25 after pushing the stone to pos54, without violating constraints?

1. Move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
2. Move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
3. Move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright
4. Move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
5. Move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
6. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright (player pushes stone from pos44 to pos54, player is now at pos44)
7. Move player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft (violates constraint 7, as the player can't be at pos43)

Let's try a different approach.

Actually, it seems we're really trying to satisfy five main constraints:
1. Get the stone to pos41
2. Have the player visit pos25 at some point
3. Have pos45 occupied before the player is at pos25
4. The player can't be at pos43 or pos35 at any point
5. The stone can't be at pos42 at any point

Looking at constraint 3 (which says that if the player is at pos25, then pos45 must have been occupied earlier), I'm wondering if this can be satisfied by having the stone at pos45 at some point. If so, we can try to get the stone to pos45, and then get the player to pos25.

Let me try this route for the stone:
pos44 -> pos45 -> pos35 -> ... -> pos41

For the player to push the stone along these routes, the player would be at:
pos43 -> pos44 -> ...

But this violates constraint 7, which says the player can't be at pos43.

Here's a different route I'm thinking:
pos44 -> pos34 -> pos24 (satisfying constraint 2) -> pos25 (player at pos25, satisfying constraint 4) -> ... -> pos41

Oh wait, the positions can't overlap. The stone can't be at pos25 if the player is there.

I've been attempting a lot of routes, and most of them seem to be infeasible with the current constraints.

Looking at the grid, let's start from a different angle: If the stone needs to be at pos41, and it can't go through pos42, then the only route is from pos31. To get the stone to pos31, the player must be at pos32. But to get the player to pos25, at some point, pos45 must have been occupied.

Wait, I'm going in circles.

Let me try a completely different approach:
1. Push the stone to pos24 to satisfy constraint 2.
2. Move the player to pos21 to satisfy constraint 6.
3. Push the stone to pos41 (the goal).

This would involve a path like:
pos44 -> pos34 -> pos24 (constraint 2 satisfied) -> pos23 -> pos22 -> pos21 (constraint 6 satisfied) -> pos31 -> pos41.

Let's see if this is feasible:
1. Move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
2. Move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
3. Move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
4. Move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
5. Move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
6. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirup (player pushes stone from pos44 to pos34, player is now at pos44)
7. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos24 dirup (player pushes stone from pos34 to pos24, player is now at pos34)
8. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos23 dirleft (player pushes stone from pos24 to pos23, player is now at pos24)
9. Move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown (player is at pos25, but need to have pos45 occupied prior, violating constraint 5)

We're still stuck with the constraint about having pos45 occupied before the player is at pos25.

OK let's consider one last approach. Maybe the specific state constraints like "stone1 is at location pos24" and "player1 is at location pos21" don't have to be part of the final position. And maybe we can get creative with the movement.

Actually, I messed up on the visualization. The pos45 is in the bottom-right, pos15 is in the top-right.

So pos15, where the player starts, is probably at (5, 1), not (1, 5). And pos55 is (5, 5), the bottom-right. This changes the way I've been thinking about the problem.

Alright, the player starts at pos15 (right side of the top row), and the stone is at pos44.

Let me re-visualize:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1 [ ][ ][ ][ ][P]
2 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
3 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
4 [G][ ][ ][S][ ]
5 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
```

where P is the player, S is the stone, G is the goal, and [ ] represents empty spaces.

Let's approach this differently. If pos35 is off-limits for the player, and pos42 is off-limits for the stone, then getting the stone from pos44 to pos41 is challenging. But, if we can get the stone to pos24, that would satisfy constraint 2. And if we get the player to pos21, that would satisfy constraint 6.

The constraint about having the player at pos25 with pos45 being occupied prior is still a challenge. Let's think about it: If the stone is at pos45, then the player would have had to push it there from pos44, placing the player at pos43. But constraint 7 says the player can't be at pos43. So, it seems like the stone can't be at pos45.

But what if the player occupies pos45? To get there from the starting position pos15, the player would need to go through pos35 (which violates constraint 3) or pos43 (which violates constraint 7).

Maybe we can get to pos45 by pushing the stone away first, and then making a longer detour?

Let's try:
1. Move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
2. Move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
3. Move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
4. Move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
5. Move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
6. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirup (player pushes stone from pos44 to pos34, player is now at pos44)
7. Move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright (player at 54)
8. Move player1 pos54 pos53 dirleft (player at 53)
9. Move player1 pos53 pos52 dirleft (player at 52)
10. Move player1 pos52 pos51 dirleft (player at 51)
11. Move player1 pos51 pos41 dirup (player at 41)
12. Move player1 pos41 pos31 dirup (player at 31)
13. Move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown (player at 32)
14. Move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown (player at 33)
15. Move player1 pos33 pos23 dirup (player at 23)
16. Move player1 pos23 pos13 dirup (player at 13)
17. Move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown (player at 14)
18. Move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown (player at 15)
19. Move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright (player at 25)

But this doesn't satisfy constraint 5, since pos45 was never occupied before the player was at pos25.

OK, let me continue to try other routes. Maybe I'm making this more complicated than it is.

Actually, let's look at constraint 5 again: "If expression 'player1 is at location pos25' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'Location pos45 is not clear'".

This means if the player is at pos25, then pos45 must have been "not clear" previously. A position is "not clear" if it's occupied by either the player or the stone.

So, if we can get the stone to pos45 at some point, and then have the player visit pos25, we'd satisfy this constraint. But to push the stone to pos45, the player would be at pos55, pos44, or pos35. Pos35 is off-limits for the player, and to make a push from pos44 to pos45, the stone would have to be at pos44, which is its starting position.

So the most viable approach seems to be to get the player to pos55 and push the stone from pos44 to pos45.

Here's a try:
1. Move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
2. Move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
3. Move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
4. Move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup
5. Move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright (player at pos21, which can satisfy constraint 6)
6. Move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
7. Move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
8. Move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
9. Move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
10. Move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
11. Move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
12. Move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown (player at pos55 and pos55 is occupied, satisfying constraint 6)
13. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos55 pos44 pos45 dirdown (player at pos55, stone moved from pos44 to pos45, player now at pos44)

OK, so we've got the stone to pos45. This should satisfy the prerequisite for constraint 5, since pos45 is not clear (it's occupied by the stone).

Now, we need to get the player to pos25, and eventually get the stone to pos41.

14. Move player1 pos44 pos34 dirup
15. Move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
16. Move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown (player at pos25, and pos45 is not clear, satisfying constraint 4 and 5)

Now, we need to get the stone to pos41 (goal pos41).

From pos45, a possible path for the stone is:
pos45 -> pos35 -> pos25 -> pos24 (satisfying constraint 2) -> pos23 -> pos22 -> pos21 -> pos31 -> pos41

But the player would need to be at pos35 to push the stone, which is forbidden (constraint 3).

Let's see if we can get the stone back to pos44 and then find another path:

17. Move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
18. Move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
19. Move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
20. Move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright (player at pos43, violating constraint 7)

So this doesn't work either.

I'm finding it increasingly difficult to satisfy all the constraints. Maybe there's a completely different approach?

OK let's think about it again. If the stone has to end up at pos41, we need to get it to that location. Since the stone can't go through pos42, it must reach pos41 from pos31 or pos51. However, a push from pos51 to pos41 would place the player at pos51, which isn't prohibited.

So, maybe we can get the stone to pos51 and then to pos41?

From pos45 (where we got it previously):
pos45 -> pos55 -> pos54 -> pos53 -> pos52 -> pos51 -> pos41

For the player to push the stone along this route, the player would be at:
pos35 -> pos45 -> pos55 -> pos54 -> pos53 -> pos52 (for the final push to pos41)

But the player can't be at pos35 (constraint 3).

So, from pos44 (the stone's starting position):
pos44 -> pos54 -> pos55 -> pos45 -> ...

If we get the stone to pos54, the player would be at pos44. Then, to push it from pos54 to pos55, the player would be at pos53. Afterwards, to push it from pos55 to pos45, the player would be at pos55.

That gets us back to a position we've already explored (stone at pos45, player at pos55). Let me continue to find a path to pos41.

OK, maybe the stone can go from pos45 to pos35, and then we can find an alternate path. But for the stone to move from pos45 to pos35, the player would have to be at pos55 and push up. After this move, the player would be at pos45 and the stone at pos35.

From this, a potential path for the stone could be:
pos35 -> pos34 -> pos24 (satisfying constraint 2) -> pos23 -> pos22 -> pos21 -> pos31 -> pos41

And the player would be at (after each push):
pos45 -> pos35 (constraint 3 violation) -> ...

Ok I found it! I was overlooking the fact that there could be more efficient routes. Let's try:

1. Move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
2. Move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
3. Move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
4. Move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup
5. Move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright (player at pos21, which can satisfy constraint 6)
6. Move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
7. Move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
8. Move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
9. Move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
10. Move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
11. Move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
12. Move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown (player at pos55 and pos55 is occupied, satisfying constraints 2 and 6)
13. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos55 pos44 pos45 dirdown (player at pos55, stone moved from pos44 to pos45, player now at pos44)
14. Move player1 pos44 pos34 dirup
15. Move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
16. Move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown (player at pos25, and pos45 is not clear, satisfying constraints 4 and 5)
17. Move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft (player back at pos15)
18. Move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
19. Move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
20. Move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
21. Move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup
22. Move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright (we already satisfied constraint 6)
23. Move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
24. Move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
25. Move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
26. Move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
27. Move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
28. Move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
29. Move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown (player back at pos55)
30. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos55 pos45 pos55 dirright (player at pos55, stone moved from pos45 to pos55, player now at pos45)
31. Move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft (player at pos35, violating constraint 3)

Argh, we hit a constraint again.

OK let me try this:
1. Move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
2. Move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
3. Move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
4. Move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup
5. Move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright (player at pos21, which can satisfy constraint 6)
6. Move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
7. Move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
8. Move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
9. Move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
10. Move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
11. Move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
12. Move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown (player at pos55 and pos55 is occupied, satisfying constraints 2 and 6)
13. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos55 pos44 pos45 dirdown (player at pos55, stone moved from pos44 to pos45, player now at pos44)
14. Move player1 pos44 pos34 dirup
15. Move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
16. Move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown (player at pos25, and pos45 is not clear, satisfying constraints 4 and 5)
17. Move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
18. Move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
19. Move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
20. Move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
21. Move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
22. Move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
23. Move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
24. Move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
25. Move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
26. Move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
27. Move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft (player at pos44, stone is at pos45)
28. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos45 pos46 dirdown (wait, pos46 doesn't exist)

Arrgh.

OK, let's try a completely different approach. What if we push the stone to pos24 first, to satisfy constraint 2, and then find a way to get the player to pos25 while ensuring pos45 is occupied?

1. Move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
2. Move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
3. Move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
4. Move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
5. Move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
6. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirup (player pushes stone from pos44 to pos34, player is now at pos44)
7. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos24 dirup (player pushes stone from pos34 to pos24, player is now at pos34, stone is at pos24, satisfying constraint 2)

At this point, we need to get the player to pos25 while ensuring pos45 has been occupied.

Let's try to get the player to pos55, and then push the stone from pos24 to a new position (maybe pos23):

8. Move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
9. Move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
10. Move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown (player at pos55, satisfying constraint 2 and 6)
11. Move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft (player at pos45, and pos45 is now occupied)
12. Move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft (this violates constraint 3, as the player can't be at pos35)

OK, I'm getting really frustrated, but let's try one more approach.

OK, here's a potential plan:

1. Move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
2. Move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
3. Move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
4. Move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
5. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos44 pos54 dirright (player pushes stone from pos44 to pos54, player is now at pos44)
6. Move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown (player at pos45, pos45 is now occupied)
7. Move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright (player at pos55, pos55 is occupied, satisfying constraints 2 and 6)
8. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos55 pos54 pos53 dirleft (player pushes stone from pos54 to pos53, player is now at pos54)
9. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos53 pos52 dirleft (player pushes stone from pos53 to pos52, player is now at pos53)
10. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos52 pos51 dirleft (player pushes stone from pos52 to pos51, player is now at pos52)
11. PushToGoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos51 pos41 dirup (player pushes stone from pos51 to pos41 (goal), player is now at pos51)
12. Move player1 pos51 pos41 dirup
13. Move player1 pos41 pos31 dirup
14. Move player1 pos31 pos21 dirup (we visited pos21 earlier, so already satisfied constraint 6)
15. Move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown
16. Move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
17. Move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
18. Move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown (player at pos25, and pos45 was occupied earlier, satisfying constraints 4 and 5)

OK, this actually works! The stone is at pos41, a goal location, which satisfies the base objective. And we managed to satisfy all constraints:
1. Position `pos35` was always clear
2. We ensured pos55 was occupied at one point (action 7)
3. Player was never at position `pos35`
4. Player was at position `pos25` (action 18)
5. Before player was at pos25, pos45 was occupied (in action 6)
6. We ensured pos55 was occupied (action 7) and the player was at pos21 (action 14)
7. Player was never at position `pos43`
8. Stone was never at position `pos42`

Alright, let's lock in this solution:

```
Move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
Move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
Move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
Move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos44 pos54 dirright
Move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown
Move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright
PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos55 pos54 pos53 dirleft
PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos53 pos52 dirleft
PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos52 pos51 dirleft
PushToGoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos51 pos41 dirup
Move player1 pos51 pos41 dirup
Move player1 pos41 pos31 dirup
Move player1 pos31 pos21 dirup
Move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown
Move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
Move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
Move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown
```

Whoops, something looks wrong with action 5: PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos44 pos54 dirright.

If the player is at pos44 and the stone is at pos44, they can't be at the same position. Let's fix:

5. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright (player at pos34, stone moved from pos44 to pos54, player now at pos44)

Now the solution should be:

```
Move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
Move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
Move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright
Move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown
Move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright
PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos55 pos54 pos53 dirleft
PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos53 pos52 dirleft
PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos52 pos51 dirleft
PushToGoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos51 pos41 dirup
Move player1 pos51 pos41 dirup
Move player1 pos41 pos31 dirup
Move player1 pos31 pos21 dirup
Move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown
Move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
Move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
Move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown
```

According to the problem specs, the plan needs to have the stone end up at a goal location. The stone ends at pos41, which is a goal location. So this plan looks valid!
