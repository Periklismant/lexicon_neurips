**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Move to pos44:** The agent navigates from pos15 through pos14, pos24, pos34 to pos44. This positions the agent to interact with the stone.

2. **Push stone to pos24:** Using the `pushtonongoal` action, the agent pushes the stone from pos34 to pos24. This satisfies the constraint that the stone must be at pos24 in some state.

3. **Move to pos14:** The agent moves back to pos14 to reposition for the final push.

4. **Push stone to pos41:** Finally, the agent pushes the stone from pos14 to pos41 (a goal location). This action also ensures the agent is at pos25 (from the path taken), fulfilling the required constraints.
