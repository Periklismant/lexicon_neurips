Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. First, I need to understand the initial state and the goal. The agent is at pos15, and the stone1 is at pos44. The goal is to have stone1 at a goal location. From the initial state, pos41 is the only goal location mentioned. Wait, looking back, yes, pos41 is a goal. So, the stone needs to be moved to pos41. But wait, the stone is at pos44, which is not a goal. So the plan must move stone1 from pos44 to pos41.

But wait, let me check the initial state again. The initial state says pos41 is a goal location. All other positions are not goals. So stone1 must end up at pos41.

Now, the constraints. Let me list them:

1. Every state: pos35 must be clear.
2. At least one state: pos55 is not clear OR stone1 is at pos24.
3. Every state: player1 is not at pos35.
4. At least one state: player1 is at pos25.
5. If player1 is at pos25 in some state, there must be an earlier state where pos45 is not clear.
6. At least one state: pos55 is not clear OR player1 is at pos21.
7. Every state: player1 is not at pos43.
8. Every state: stone1 is not at pos42.

So, the main goal is to get stone1 to pos41. But there are several constraints to satisfy along the way.

First, let's think about moving the stone from pos44 to pos41. The path from pos44 to pos41 would require pushing the stone. Let's see the movement directions. From pos44, moving left would take it to pos34, then to pos33, then to pos32, etc. But wait, pos44 is connected to pos34 (left) and pos54 (right), and also up to pos43 and down to pos45. But the goal is pos41, which is in the top-left corner (row 4, column1). Wait, the locations are labeled posXY where X is the row and Y is the column? Let me check the movement possibilities. For example, pos41 is connected to pos31 (left?), wait the movement from pos31 to pos41 is via direction dirright. So pos31 to pos41 is right. So pos41 is to the right of pos31. So rows are probably vertical (like rows 1 to 5 going down) and columns 1 to 5 going right. So pos41 is row4, column1. Wait, no: the movement from pos31 to pos41 is via dirright. So if pos31 is row3, column1, then dirright would take to column2, but pos31's right is pos41. Wait, that can't be. Wait, looking at the movement connections:

From pos31, you can go to pos21 (dirleft), pos41 (dirright), and pos32 (dirdown). So pos31 is in row3, column1. dirleft would decrease the column to 0, which isn't possible, but according to the given movements, pos31 can go left to pos21. Hmm, maybe the grid is structured with rows as vertical and columns as horizontal, but the movement directions might be a bit different. Alternatively, perhaps the grid is laid out such that moving right from pos31 (row3, column1) takes you to pos41 (row4, column1?), but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the positions are arranged in a grid where the first digit is the row (from top to bottom) and the second is the column (left to right). For example, pos11 is top-left, pos15 is top-right, pos51 is bottom-left, pos55 is bottom-right.

So, movement directions: dirright would move to the next column (same row), dirdown would move to the next row (same column). Wait, but some movements seem to contradict that. For example, pos11 can move right to pos21. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, the movement from pos11 to pos21 is direction dirright. But if pos11 is row1, column1, then dirright would be to column2, which would be pos12. But according to the given, moving right from pos11 goes to pos21. That suggests that direction dirright is moving down a row, keeping the column. Wait, perhaps the directions are named differently. For example, dirright might mean moving down a row, dirleft up a row, dirdown to the next column, and dirup to the previous column. That would complicate things, but maybe that's the case. Alternatively, the directions are labeled differently. Let me check some movement connections to figure out the grid layout.

Looking at pos15: the movements are to pos25 (dirright) and pos14 (dirup). So if pos15 is row1, column5, then moving dirright to pos25 would be row2, column5. Moving dirup from pos15 to pos14 would be row1, column4. So dirright and dirleft are moving along the row (changing the row number?), while dirdown and dirup are moving along the column (changing the column number). Wait, that's possible. So, for example, pos15 (row1, column5) moving dirright would go to pos25 (row2, column5), and moving dirup would go to pos14 (row1, column4). So in this case, dirright and dirleft change the row, while dirdown and dirup change the column. That seems counterintuitive, but given the movement connections, that's how it's structured. So direction dirright increases the row number by 1, dirleft decreases the row by 1, dirdown increases the column by 1, dirup decreases the column by 1. So, for example, pos11 (row1, column1) moving dirright (row+1) goes to pos21 (row2, column1), and moving dirdown (column+1) goes to pos12 (row1, column2). That would make sense. So the grid is arranged with rows as the first number (vertical) and columns as the second (horizontal). So posXY is in row X, column Y. Directions: dirright is down a row (X increases), dirleft is up a row (X decreases), dirdown is right a column (Y increases), dirup is left a column (Y decreases). Wait, but that's opposite of usual terms, but perhaps that's how it's defined here.

Given that, to move from pos44 (row4, column4) to pos41 (row4, column1), the stone needs to move left (decrease column) from column4 to 1. But since the agent can only push stones, the agent has to get behind the stone and push it. Let's see the path.

Stone is at pos44. To push it to pos34 (left direction, since from pos44, moving left (dirleft) would be to pos34. Wait, no: the movement from pos44 to pos34 is via direction dirleft. Wait, according to the movement connections, pos44 can move left to pos34 (dirleft). So, from pos44, dirleft takes you to pos34. So if the agent is at pos44's adjacent position in the direction opposite to the push direction, they can push the stone. For example, to push the stone from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft), the agent needs to be at pos44's right (dirright from pos34?), wait, no. Wait, the action pushtogoal requires that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from in direction d. So for the action "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d", the agent is at l_p, which is connected to l_from via direction d. Then, the stone is at l_from, and is pushed to l_to in direction d. Wait, the direction is the same for both the agent moving to the stone and the stone moving to the new location. So for example, if the agent is at l_p, and l_from is in direction d from l_p, then the stone is pushed in direction d from l_from to l_to. So, to push the stone from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft), the agent must be at a position that is in direction dirleft from pos44. Wait, no. Wait, the preconditions for pushtogoal are: (iv) you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d. So l_p is the agent's position, and direction d leads from l_p to l_from. Then, direction d also leads from l_from to l_to. So l_to is in direction d from l_from. So for example, if the agent is at pos45 (which is down from pos44), direction dirdown would take from pos45 to pos44 (if that's allowed). Wait, but according to the movement connections, pos44 can be reached from pos34 via dirright (since pos34 can move right to pos44). Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the movement connections for pos44.

Looking at the movement for pos44: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown".

So, pos44 can go dirleft to pos34 (row3, column4?), dirright to pos54 (row5, column4?), dirup to pos43 (row4, column3?), dirdown to pos45 (row4, column5?).

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let's clarify:

If pos44 is row4, column4, then:

- dirleft would decrease the row by 1 (to row3, column4) → pos34.

- dirright would increase the row by 1 (to row5, column4) → pos54.

- dirup would decrease the column by 1 (row4, column3) → pos43.

- dirdown would increase the column by 1 (row4, column5) → pos45.

So, the directions are:

- dirleft: row decreases by 1.

- dirright: row increases by 1.

- dirup: column decreases by 1.

- dirdown: column increases by 1.

So, for example, pos44 (row4, column4):

- dirleft → pos34 (row3, column4).

- dirright → pos54 (row5, column4).

- dirup → pos43 (row4, column3).

- dirdown → pos45 (row4, column5).

This makes sense. So, movement in dirleft and dirright changes the row, while dirup and dirdown change the column.

So, to push the stone from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft), the agent needs to be at a position that is in the opposite direction from pos44. Wait, to push the stone in dirleft (from pos44 to pos34), the agent must be at pos44's right (dirright direction from pos34). Wait, no. Let's think again. The agent needs to be at a position l_p such that there's a direction d that allows moving from l_p to l_from (pos44). Then, pushing the stone in direction d from l_from (pos44) to l_to (pos34). So for pushing the stone from pos44 to pos34 (direction dirleft), the agent must be at a position that can reach pos44 via direction d. Wait, the direction d in the action is the direction from l_p to l_from, and then the same direction from l_from to l_to.

So, in this case, to push the stone from pos44 to pos34 (direction dirleft), the agent must be at a position l_p such that moving in direction dirleft from l_p reaches pos44. Wait, no. The direction d in the action is the direction from l_p to l_from. So if the agent is at l_p, and l_from is in direction d from l_p, then the stone is at l_from. Then, pushing in direction d from l_from would take it to l_to. So, for example, if the agent is at pos45 (row4, column5), and direction d is dirleft, then from pos45, moving dirleft would take to pos44 (since pos45's dirleft is row3, column5? Wait, no. Wait, pos45's directions: according to the given connections, from pos45 you can move to pos35 (dirleft), pos55 (dirright), pos44 (dirup), etc. Wait, pos45's movement options:

From pos45:

- You may move to pos35 following direction dirleft (row3, column5).

- You may move to pos55 following direction dirright (row5, column5).

- You may move to pos44 following direction dirup (column decreases by 1, so row4, column4).

Wait, dirup from pos45 (row4, column5) would be column4 → pos44.

So, if the agent is at pos45, and wants to push the stone at pos44 to pos34 (dirleft), the direction from the agent's position to the stone's position (l_from) is dirup. Because from pos45, dirup leads to pos44. Then, pushing in the same direction (dirup) from pos44 would lead to pos43 (since dirup from pos44 is column3). Wait, but we want to push the stone to pos34, which is dirleft from pos44. So the direction for the push must be dirleft. But the agent can't be in a position that allows moving dirleft to pos44. Because dirleft from l_p would be row-1. So to get to pos44 via dirleft, l_p must be pos54 (row5, column4), since dirleft from pos54 (row5, column4) is pos44 (row4, column4). So, if the agent is at pos54, and direction dirleft, then l_p is pos54, l_from is pos44 (since moving dirleft from pos54 gives pos44). Then, pushing dirleft from pos44 would take the stone to pos34. So the action would be pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirleft. But pos34 is a non-goal location (from the initial state, pos34 is not a goal). Wait, the goal is to get the stone to a goal location, which is pos41. So pushing to pos34 (non-goal) is not helpful. So perhaps we need to push the stone west (dirup) to pos43, then to pos42, etc. But wait, the constraint says stone1 must never be at pos42. So that's not allowed. So we can't push the stone to pos43, then pos42. Because constraint 8 is that in every state, stone1 is not at pos42. So that path is blocked.

Alternative route: push the stone north (dirleft) from pos44 to pos34 (non-goal), then west (dirup) to pos33, etc. But pos34 is not a goal. So how to get to pos41?

Wait, pos41 is a goal. So the stone needs to reach pos41. Let's plan the path from pos44 to pos41.

Possible path:

pos44 → pos34 (dirleft) → pos33 (dirup) → pos32 (dirup) → pos31 (dirup) → pos41 (dirright). Wait, but how? From pos31, dirright takes to pos41. So if the stone is at pos31, pushing it dirright to pos41 would place it at the goal. So the plan would be to move the stone from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft), then to pos33 (dirup), then to pos32 (dirup), then to pos31 (dirup), then to pos41 (dirright). But need to check if each of these steps is possible given the constraints.

But let's check each step:

1. Push from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft). Agent must be at pos54 (dirleft to pos44). But pos54 is clear initially. So the agent can move there. But after pushing, the agent ends up at pos44 (from the effect of pushtogoal/pushtonongoal). But pos44 is now clear? Wait, after pushing, the agent moves to l_from (pos44) and the stone moves to l_to (pos34). So after this action, the agent is at pos44, and the stone is at pos34. But pos44 is now clear because the stone moved. But the agent is now at pos44. But the constraints: constraint 7 says the agent cannot be at pos43. But pos44 is allowed. Wait, constraint 7 says player1 is not at pos43 in any state. So pos44 is okay.

But pushing to pos34 would require using pushtonongoal, since pos34 is not a goal. So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirleft. But before that, the agent needs to get to pos54. Let's see the initial position: agent is at pos15. So how to get to pos54.

Path from pos15 to pos54:

Looking at movement connections. pos15 can move dirright to pos25, or dirup to pos14.

From pos15 to pos25 (dirright). Then pos25 can move dirright to pos35 (but pos35 must remain clear always, per constraint 1. So if the agent moves to pos35, that would violate the constraint. Also, constraint 3 says the agent can never be at pos35. So the agent cannot go through pos35. So alternative path: pos15 → pos14 (dirup). Then pos14 → pos24 (dirright), pos24 → pos34 (dirright), pos34 → pos44 (dirright), but pos44 has the stone. Alternatively, pos15 → pos25 (dirright) → pos35 is blocked because of constraint. So pos25 can move dirright to pos35, but agent can't be there. So need a different path.

Alternative route: pos15 → pos14 (dirup), then pos14 → pos13 (dirup), pos13 → pos12 (dirup), pos12 → pos11 (dirup). Then pos11 → pos21 (dirright), pos21 → pos31 (dirright), pos31 → pos41 (dirright). Then pos41 → pos51 (dirright), but pos51 is clear. Then pos51 → pos52 (dirdown), pos52 → pos53 (dirdown), pos53 → pos54 (dirdown). So that's a long path. But this seems possible. Let's see:

move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup

move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup

move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup

move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup

move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright

move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright

move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright

move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright

move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown

move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown

move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown

Now the agent is at pos54. Then, perform pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirleft. But wait, the agent is at pos54, which is clear. The stone is at pos44. So this action would require that the agent is at pos54 (l_p), stone is at pos44 (l_from), pos34 (l_to) is clear. Is pos34 clear initially? Yes, according to initial state, pos34 is clear. So this action is possible.

After this action, the agent is at pos44, stone is at pos34. Then, the next step is to push the stone from pos34 to pos33 (dirup). Because dirup from pos34 would decrease column by 1, so pos33 (row3, column3). But pos33 is clear. To push the stone from pos34 to pos33 (dirup), the agent needs to be at pos34's dirdown direction, which is pos34's column+1, so pos35 (row3, column5? Wait, no. Wait, dirup from pos34 is column-1. So to push dirup from pos34 to pos33, the agent needs to be at a position l_p such that moving dirup from l_p reaches pos34. Wait, direction in the action is dirup, so l_p must be in the direction opposite to dirup from pos34. Since dirup from pos34 is column-1 (to pos33), the agent needs to be at a position that can reach pos34 via dirup. That would be pos34's dirdown direction (column+1). So pos34's dirdown is pos35 (column5). Wait, pos34's dirdown direction is to pos35 (row3, column5). So to push the stone from pos34 to pos33 (dirup), the agent must be at pos35 (l_p), moving dirup to pos34 (l_from), then pushing dirup to pos33. But pos35 must remain clear per constraint 1. So the agent can't be at pos35. Also, constraint 3 says the agent can't be at pos35 ever. So this is impossible. So this path is blocked.

Alternative approach: find another way to push the stone from pos34 to pos33. Maybe push from pos34's dirleft direction. Let's think: pos34's dirleft is pos24 (row2, column4). So if the agent is at pos24, and direction dirleft (which would take to pos14?), wait, no. Wait, pos24's dirleft is pos14 (row1, column4). No. Let me check the movement options for pos24.

From pos24, you can move dirleft to pos14, dirright to pos34, dirup to pos23, dirdown to pos25.

So to push the stone from pos34 to pos33 (dirup), the agent can't use pos35. So maybe another direction. Alternatively, push the stone from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft). Then from pos24 to pos23 (dirup), etc. But pos24 is not a goal. So this might not help, but let's see.

But wait, the final goal is to get the stone to pos41. So maybe pushing it up (dirleft) to pos34, then dirleft to pos24, then dirleft to pos14, then dirleft to pos41? Wait, pos14 is row1, column4. dirleft from pos14 is pos14's row-1, which is pos04, which doesn't exist. So that's not possible. So that approach won't work.

Alternative idea: after pushing the stone to pos34, the agent is at pos44. Then, the agent needs to move around to the other side to push the stone further. Let's see:

After pushing from pos44 to pos34, the agent is at pos44. Now, to push the stone from pos34 to pos33 (dirup), the agent needs to be at pos34's dirdown direction (pos35), which is forbidden. Alternatively, push the stone from pos34 to pos33 using dirup. But to do that, the agent needs to be at pos34's dirdown direction (pos35), which is not allowed. So this is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the stone needs to be moved in another direction.

Wait, from pos34, can the stone be pushed dirright to pos44? But that's where it came from. Not helpful. Or dirup to pos33? As before, but can't reach there.

Alternative path: After pushing the stone to pos34, the agent is at pos44. Then, the agent can move to pos43 (dirup from pos44), but constraint 7 says the agent can't be at pos43. So that's forbidden. So agent can't go to pos43. So the agent must move elsewhere. From pos44, the agent can move dirleft to pos34 (but the stone is there, so it's blocked), dirright to pos54 (clear), dirup to pos43 (forbidden), or dirdown to pos45 (clear). So the agent can move to pos45 or pos54.

If the agent moves to pos45, then from there, can push the stone from pos34 to pos35 (dirdown). But pos35 must remain clear. So pushing the stone to pos35 would violate constraint 1. So that's not allowed.

Alternative idea: Maybe the initial plan to push the stone west (dirup) from pos44 to pos43 is not possible because of constraint 8 (stone1 can't be at pos42). But pos43 is allowed, as long as it's not moved to pos42. So perhaps pushing the stone to pos43 (dirup from pos44), then to pos33 (dirleft), then to pos32 (dirup), etc.

But to push from pos44 to pos43 (dirup), the agent must be at pos44's dirdown direction, which is pos45. So the agent at pos45 can push dirup to pos44's pos43. So:

After the first push to pos34, the agent is at pos44. Then, move to pos45 (dirdown from pos44). Then, push the stone from pos44 to pos43 (dirup). Wait, no, the stone is at pos34 now. Oh right, after the first push, the stone is at pos34. So to push it again, the agent needs to be in a position to reach pos34. For example, the agent is at pos44 (after the first push), then moves to pos34 (dirleft), but pos34 has the stone, so it's blocked. So can't move there. Alternatively, the agent moves from pos44 to pos54 (dirright). Then, from pos54, can push the stone at pos34 to pos24 (dirleft). Because from pos34, dirleft is pos24. So to push from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft), the agent must be at pos34's dirright direction (pos44). But pos44 is clear after the first push. So agent can move to pos44 (from pos54 via dirleft?), but pos44 is clear. Wait, after the first push (pushtonongoal to pos34), the agent is at pos44. So after that, the agent can move to pos54 (dirright from pos44). Then, from pos54, can the agent push the stone from pos34 to pos24? To do that, the agent needs to be at a position l_p such that moving direction d from l_p reaches pos34. The direction would be dirleft. So from pos44, dirleft is pos34. So if the agent is at pos44, and the stone is at pos34, then pushing dirleft would move the stone to pos24. But the agent is at pos44, so direction dirleft would be from pos44 to pos34. So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos24 dirleft. But pos24 is a non-goal location. So that's allowed. But pos24 is not a goal. So this is a step towards getting the stone to pos41?

Hmm, not sure. Let's think: pos24 is row2, column4. Then, pushing the stone dirleft to pos14, then dirleft to pos41? But pos14's dirleft is row1, column4, which is pos14 itself? Wait, no. Wait, pos14's dirleft would be row0, which is invalid. So perhaps this path isn't helpful.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos24, maybe push it dirup to pos23, then dirleft to pos13, etc. But this seems complicated and not leading towards pos41.

Alternative approach: Maybe the initial plan to push the stone west (dirup) to pos43 is not possible due to constraint 8 (stone1 can't be at pos42). So pushing to pos43 is allowed, but then pushing from pos43 to pos42 is forbidden. So if we can push the stone from pos44 to pos43, then to pos33, avoiding pos42.

But how to push from pos44 to pos43 (dirup). The agent needs to be at pos45 (dirdown from pos44) to push dirup. But after the first push to pos34, the agent is at pos44. Then, to push to pos43, the agent needs to move to pos45. Let's see:

After first action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirleft.

Agent is now at pos44. Then, move to pos45 via dirdown.

Action: move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown.

Then, push the stone from pos34 to pos33 (dirup). Wait, the stone is at pos34. To push it dirup (column-1) to pos33 (row3, column3), the agent needs to be at pos34's dirdown direction (pos35). But pos35 must remain clear, and the agent can't be there. So this is not possible.

Alternative idea: push the stone from pos34 to pos33 via dirup. But how?

The agent is at pos45. To reach a position where they can push the stone at pos34 to pos33 (dirup). The agent needs to be at pos34's dirdown direction (pos35), which is forbidden. So this isn't possible.

This suggests that the initial approach of pushing the stone north (dirleft) to pos34 is a dead end. So perhaps a different path is needed.

Alternative plan: push the stone west (dirup) from pos44 to pos43, then north (dirleft) to pos33, etc. But to do that, the agent needs to first get to pos45 to push dirup.

But initially, the agent is at pos15. So path to pos45:

pos15 → pos25 (dirright) → pos35 (dirright) → but pos35 is blocked. So that's not possible. Alternatively, pos15 → pos14 (dirup) → pos24 (dirright) → pos34 (dirright) → pos44 (dirright). But pos44 has the stone. So agent can't move there unless it's clear. Initially, pos44 is clear (since stone is there, but "Location pos44 is clear" is false because the stone is there. Wait, in the initial state, "Location pos44 is clear" is false because stone1 is there. So the agent can't move into pos44 unless it's clear. So the initial state says pos44 is not clear (has stone1). So the agent can't move into pos44 unless pushing the stone.

So the agent must navigate around to reach pos45. Let's try:

pos15 → pos14 (dirup) → pos13 (dirup) → pos12 (dirup) → pos11 (dirup) → pos21 (dirright) → pos31 (dirright) → pos41 (dirright) → pos51 (dirright) → pos52 (dirdown) → pos53 (dirdown) → pos54 (dirdown). Then, from pos54, move to pos44 via dirleft. But pos44 has the stone, so the agent can't move there. So instead, from pos54, the agent can push the stone from pos44 to pos43 (dirup). Because to push dirup from pos44 to pos43, the agent must be at pos45 (dirdown from pos44). But how to get to pos45? From pos54, the agent can move to pos44 via dirleft, but that's blocked. So perhaps another path.

Wait, maybe the agent can go from pos54 to pos55 (dirdown), then to pos45 (dirleft). But pos55's dirleft is pos45. So:

pos54 → pos55 (dirdown) → pos45 (dirleft). Then, from pos45, push the stone at pos44 to pos43 (dirup). So action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirup.

But after this, the stone is at pos43, which is allowed. Then, the agent is at pos44. Now, to push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft). The agent needs to be at pos43's dirright (pos44). So agent is at pos44, push dirleft to pos33. Action: pushtonongoal ... but pos33 is a non-goal. Then, continue pushing to pos32 (dirup), etc.

But after pushing to pos43, the stone is at pos43. Now, the agent is at pos44. To push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft), the agent must be at pos43's dirright (pos44). So action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos33 dirleft. This would move the stone to pos33. Then, the agent is at pos43, which is forbidden by constraint 7. So that's a problem. Because after pushing, the agent moves to l_from (pos43), which is forbidden. So this action is invalid.

So this path is blocked by constraint 7.

Alternative idea: after pushing the stone to pos43, the agent is at pos44. Then, the agent needs to move away from pos44 to avoid being at pos43. For example, move to pos54 (dirright from pos44). Then, from pos54, push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft). But to do that, the agent must be at pos43's dirright (pos44), which is clear. Wait, pos43's dirright is pos44. So agent at pos44 can push the stone at pos43 to pos33 (dirleft). But the agent is at pos44, which is clear after the previous push. So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos33 dirleft. But after this action, the agent moves to pos43, which violates constraint 7. So this is invalid.

Thus, pushing the stone to pos43 is problematic because the agent ends up at pos43, which is forbidden.

Alternative plan: Push the stone east (dirright) to pos54, then north (dirleft) to pos53, but pos54 is not a goal. Wait, but the goal is to get to pos41. Not helpful.

Another approach: Maybe the agent needs to take a completely different path. Let's think about the constraints:

- Must have player1 at pos25 at least once. So the plan must include a move to pos25.

- Also, if player1 is at pos25, there must be an earlier state where pos45 is not clear. So pos45 must be occupied before reaching pos25.

- Also, one of the states must have pos55 not clear or stone1 at pos24.

- One of the states must have pos55 not clear or player1 at pos21.

So the plan must satisfy these.

Let's consider how to satisfy the constraint that when player1 is at pos25, pos45 was not clear in an earlier state. So pos45 needs to be occupied (by the agent or a stone) before the agent moves to pos25.

But initially, pos45 is clear. The only way to make pos45 not clear is to have the agent or stone there. Since the stone starts at pos44, perhaps pushing it to pos45. But pos45 is not a goal, and the stone would need to be moved again. But pushing the stone to pos45 would make pos45 not clear, satisfying the condition for the constraint when the agent later moves to pos25.

So maybe the plan includes pushing the stone to pos45 first, then moving to pos25, ensuring that pos45 was not clear before.

But the stone is at pos44 initially. Pushing it to pos45 would require the agent to be at pos44's dirdown direction (pos45's dirup is pos44). Wait, to push the stone from pos44 to pos45 (dirdown), the agent must be at pos44's dirup direction (pos43). But the agent can't be at pos43 due to constraint 7.

Wait, no. To push the stone from pos44 to pos45 (dirdown), the agent must be at a position l_p such that moving direction d from l_p leads to pos44, and direction d from pos44 leads to pos45. The direction here is dirdown. So l_p must be such that moving dirdown from l_p reaches pos44. Which direction is that? pos44's dirdown is pos45. So the agent must be at pos44's dirup direction, which is pos43. But pos43 is forbidden for the agent. So this is impossible.

Therefore, the agent can't push the stone to pos45 directly.

Alternative idea: the agent can move to pos45 by another path and then push the stone. But pos45 is clear initially. So the agent can move to pos45. But then, if the agent is at pos45, they can't push the stone from pos44 to anywhere unless they are adjacent. Since the agent is at pos45, to push the stone at pos44, which is dirup from pos45, they can push dirup to pos44's direction. Wait, pos45's dirup is pos44. So the agent at pos45 can push the stone at pos44 to pos43 (dirup). But that would require the stone to be at pos44 and the agent at pos45. So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirup. This is possible if pos43 is clear. But pos43 is initially clear. So this action would move the stone to pos43 and the agent to pos44. But then the agent is at pos44, which is allowed. However, after that, the agent is at pos44, and stone is at pos43. But then, when the agent needs to move to pos25, they must have pos45 not clear earlier. But pos45 is clear after this action (since the agent moved to pos44, pos45 becomes clear). So this doesn't help.

Alternatively, if the agent moves to pos45 and then moves to pos55, making pos45 clear again. But this doesn't help with the constraint.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's try to outline a possible plan step by step, considering all constraints.

First, the agent must reach pos25 at some point. But to do that, they need to pass through pos25's adjacent positions. But pos25 is row2, column5. The initial position is pos15 (row1, column5). So moving dirright from pos15 to pos25 is possible. But constraint 3 says the agent can't be at pos35. So moving from pos25 to pos35 is not allowed. But just being at pos25 is allowed.

But to satisfy the constraint that when the agent is at pos25, there must have been a previous state where pos45 was not clear. So pos45 must have been occupied before the agent reaches pos25.

How can pos45 be occupied? The stone starts at pos44. If we can push the stone to pos45, then pos45 would be occupied. But earlier analysis shows that pushing the stone to pos45 requires the agent to be at pos43, which is forbidden. So that's not possible.

Alternative idea: the agent moves to pos45 themselves, making it occupied. Then later moves to pos25. But pos45 is initially clear. So the agent can move to pos45, making it occupied. Then, when they later move to pos25, the condition is satisfied because pos45 was not clear (when the agent was there).

So let's consider:

1. move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright. But wait, pos15 can move dirright to pos25. Is that possible? From the movement connections, yes: "You may move from location pos15 to location pos25 following direction dirright". So the agent can move directly from pos15 to pos25. But if they do this, then the constraint 5 requires that there was a previous state where pos45 was not clear. But pos45 was clear initially. So this would violate the constraint. Therefore, the agent cannot move to pos25 until pos45 has been occupied.

So the agent must first make pos45 occupied, then move to pos25. The only way to make pos45 occupied is for the agent to be there. Because the stone can't be moved there. So:

1. move player1 from pos15 to pos25 is not allowed until pos45 is occupied. So the agent must first move to pos45.

Path to pos45:

pos15 → pos14 (dirup) → pos24 (dirright) → pos34 (dirright) → pos44 (dirright). But pos44 has the stone, so the agent can't move there unless it's clear. But pos44 is not clear (stone is there). So can't move there. Alternative path: pos15 → pos25 (dirright) → pos35 is blocked. So no. Alternative path: pos15 → pos14 → pos13 → pos12 → pos11 → pos21 → pos31 → pos41 → pos51 → pos52 → pos53 → pos54 → pos55 → pos45 (dirleft from pos55). So:

move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup

move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup

move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup

move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup

move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright

move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright

move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright

move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright

move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown

move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown

move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown

move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown

move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft

Now the agent is at pos45. Now, pos45 is not clear (occupied by the agent). Then, move to pos25. But how?

From pos45, the agent can move dirup to pos44 (but pos44 has the stone), dirleft to pos35 (forbidden), or dirright to pos55. So the agent can't move directly to pos25 from pos45. So they need to backtrack:

From pos45, move to pos55 (dirright), then to pos54 (dirup), pos53 (dirup), pos52 (dirup), pos51 (dirup), pos41 (dirleft), pos31 (dirleft), pos21 (dirleft), pos11 (dirleft), pos12 (dirdown), pos13 (dirdown), pos14 (dirdown), pos15 (dirdown), then pos25 (dirright). But this is a very long path and would take many steps, but it's possible. Once the agent is at pos25, the constraint is satisfied because pos45 was occupied earlier.

But this seems inefficient. However, given the constraints, it might be necessary. But this is time-consuming and may not be optimal.

But the main goal is to move the stone to pos41. So perhaps combining these steps.

Alternatively, after the agent is at pos45 (making pos45 not clear), then they can move to pos25 via some path that doesn't go through pos35.

But how?

From pos45, move to pos55 (dirright), then to pos54 (dirup), pos53 (dirup), pos52 (dirup), pos51 (dirup), pos41 (dirleft), pos31 (dirleft), pos21 (dirleft), pos11 (dirleft), pos12 (dirdown), pos13 (dirdown), pos14 (dirdown), pos15 (dirdown), pos25 (dirright). Yes, but this is many steps.

Once the agent is at pos25, the constraint 4 is satisfied. Then, they need to move to pos41 to push the stone.

But this seems too long. Let's think of a shorter path.

Alternative approach: Use the pushtogoal action to move the stone directly to pos41. But how?

The stone is at pos44. To push it to pos41, the agent needs to be in a position that allows pushing in the correct direction. pos41 is row4, column1. So from pos44, the agent needs to push the stone west (dirup) multiple times and then north (dirleft) once.

But the stone's path would be pos44 → pos43 (dirup) → pos33 (dirleft) → pos32 (dirup) → pos31 (dirup) → pos41 (dirright). Wait, pos31 is row3, column1. dirright from pos31 is pos41 (row4, column1). So pushing the stone from pos31 to pos41 would require the agent to be at pos31's dirright (pos41 is dirright from pos31). So the agent would need to be at pos31's dirleft (pos21) to push dirright. Wait, no. To push the stone from pos31 to pos41 (dirright), the agent must be at pos31's dirright direction, which is pos41. But pos41 is clear initially. So agent can move to pos41, then push the stone from pos31 to pos41. But the stone is at pos44 initially. So this is part of a longer plan.

But this seems complicated. Let's try to outline this path:

1. Push stone from pos44 to pos43 (dirup): agent at pos45 pushes dirup.

But agent can't be at pos43. Wait, no, the agent is at pos45, pushes dirup to pos44's pos43. Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirup. But after this, agent is at pos44. Stone at pos43.

2. Then, push stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft): agent needs to be at pos43's dirright (pos44). So agent at pos44 can push dirleft to pos33. Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos33 dirleft. But after this, agent is at pos43, which is forbidden. So this is invalid.

Alternative, after step 1, agent is at pos44. Then, move to pos34 (dirleft), but pos34 has the stone after step 1? No, after step 1, stone is at pos43.

Wait, after step 1: stone is at pos43, agent is at pos44.

3. Agent moves from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft). But pos34 is clear? Initially yes, but after step 1, pos34 is clear. So agent moves to pos34.

4. Then, push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft). Agent is at pos34, which is dirleft from pos44. To push the stone at pos43 to pos33 (dirleft), the agent must be at pos43's dirright (pos44). So agent at pos44 can push dirleft. But agent is at pos34. So agent needs to move to pos44.

5. Agent moves from pos34 to pos44 (dirright). But pos44 is clear after step 1. Yes. So move to pos44.

6. Then, push stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft). Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos33 dirleft. Now, agent is at pos43, which is forbidden. So invalid.

This approach isn't working due to constraint 7.

Alternative plan: Find a path where the agent doesn't end up at pos43.

Let me think differently. The only goal is to get the stone to pos41. The constraints are numerous, but perhaps there's a way to satisfy them while moving the stone.

Let's consider the constraints that must be satisfied:

- Constraint 2: At least one state where pos55 is not clear or stone1 is at pos24.

If we can push the stone to pos24 at some point, that would satisfy this. Alternatively, have the agent or stone at pos55.

But moving the stone to pos24 might be a detour, but it's allowed as long as it's moved to a goal later. But the stone must end at pos41.

Alternatively, the agent could briefly move to pos55, making it not clear, satisfying constraint 2.

Constraint 6: At least one state where pos55 is not clear or player1 is at pos21.

If the agent moves to pos21 at some point, this is satisfied.

Constraint 5: If the agent is at pos25, there must be an earlier state where pos45 was not clear.

So perhaps the plan is as follows:

1. Move agent from pos15 to pos25 (dirright), but this violates constraint 5 unless pos45 was occupied earlier.

But pos45 is clear initially. So can't do this first.

So first, the agent must make pos45 occupied.

The only way is to move to pos45.

Path to pos45:

pos15 → pos14 (dirup) → pos13 (dirup) → pos12 (dirup) → pos11 (dirup) → pos21 (dirright) → pos31 (dirright) → pos41 (dirright) → pos51 (dirright) → pos52 (dirdown) → pos53 (dirdown) → pos54 (dirdown) → pos55 (dirdown) → pos45 (dirleft). This is 13 moves. Then, agent is at pos45. Now, pos45 is not clear.

Now, the agent can move to pos25.

But how? From pos45, move to pos55 (dirright) → pos54 (dirup) → pos53 (dirup) → pos52 (dirup) → pos51 (dirup) → pos41 (dirleft) → pos31 (dirleft) → pos21 (dirleft) → pos11 (dirleft) → pos12 (dirdown) → pos13 (dirdown) → pos14 (dirdown) → pos15 (dirdown) → pos25 (dirright). This is another 13 moves. Now, agent is at pos25, and constraint 4 is satisfied. Also, constraint 5 is satisfied because pos45 was occupied earlier.

Now, the agent needs to move to pos41 to push the stone. But the stone is still at pos44.

But this is getting very long. Perhaps there's a shorter path.

Alternative idea: After moving to pos45, the agent can move directly to pos25 via some other route. For example, pos45 → pos35 (dirleft). But pos35 is forbidden. So that's not possible.

Alternative route from pos45 to pos25:

pos45 → pos44 (dirup) → but pos44 has the stone. So agent can't move there. So no.

This seems stuck. Maybe this approach is not feasible.

Alternative plan: Accept that the agent has to make a long journey to satisfy the constraints, but then push the stone to pos41.

But time is limited. Let's try to outline the plan steps.

1. Move agent from pos15 to pos14 (dirup).

2. pos14 to pos13 (dirup).

3. pos13 to pos12 (dirup).

4. pos12 to pos11 (dirup).

5. pos11 to pos21 (dirright).

6. pos21 to pos31 (dirright).

7. pos31 to pos41 (dirright).

8. pos41 to pos51 (dirright).

9. pos51 to pos52 (dirdown).

10. pos52 to pos53 (dirdown).

11. pos53 to pos54 (dirdown).

12. pos54 to pos55 (dirdown).

13. pos55 to pos45 (dirleft).

Now, pos45 is not clear (agent is there).

14. pos45 to pos55 (dirright).

15. pos55 to pos54 (dirup).

16. pos54 to pos53 (dirup).

17. pos53 to pos52 (dirup).

18. pos52 to pos51 (dirup).

19. pos51 to pos41 (dirleft).

20. pos41 to pos31 (dirleft).

21. pos31 to pos21 (dirleft).

22. pos21 to pos11 (dirleft).

23. pos11 to pos12 (dirdown).

24. pos12 to pos13 (dirdown).

25. pos13 to pos14 (dirdown).

26. pos14 to pos15 (dirdown).

27. pos15 to pos25 (dirright).

Now, the agent is at pos25, satisfying constraint 4. Also, constraint 5 is satisfied because pos45 was occupied earlier.

Now, the agent is at pos25. From here, need to get to pos41 to push the stone.

But the stone is still at pos44. So the agent needs to navigate to pos44's vicinity.

But this is getting too long. Perhaps there's a more optimal path.

Wait, perhaps instead of going all the way to pos45, the agent can push the stone to pos24 to satisfy constraint 2, and then proceed.

Let's try:

1. Move agent from pos15 to pos14 (dirup).

2. pos14 to pos24 (dirright).

3. pos24 to pos34 (dirright).

4. pos34 to pos44 (dirright). But pos44 has the stone, so can't move there.

So agent is at pos34. To push the stone at pos44 to pos43 (dirup), agent must be at pos45. But agent is at pos34. How to get to pos45?

Alternative path:

From pos34, move to pos33 (dirup).

But pos33 is clear. Then to pos32 (dirup), etc. But this is not helpful.

Alternatively, agent can move to pos44's dirleft (pos34) and push the stone to pos34. But pos44 is not clear.

This is getting too complicated. Given time constraints, perhaps the correct plan is to push the stone from pos44 to pos34, then to pos24, then to pos14, then to pos41. But pos41 is goal.

But how to push from pos14 to pos41?

pos14 is row1, column4. pos41 is row4, column1. The path would require pushing the stone from pos14 to pos13 (dirup), then pos12 (dirup), then pos11 (dirup), then pos21 (dirright), pos31 (dirright), pos41. But this would require multiple pushes.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos24, then to pos14, then to pos41 via dirleft.

But pos14's dirleft is pos04, which doesn't exist. So not possible.

Alternatively, after pushing to pos24, then push dirup to pos23, then dirleft to pos13, etc. But this seems too long.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I think the optimal plan involves the agent moving to pos54, pushing the stone to pos34, then to pos24, then to pos14, then to pos41. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps there's a direct path by pushing the stone west and north.

But given the constraints, especially that the agent can't be at pos43 or pos35, and the stone can't be at pos42, the only viable path is to push the stone north to pos34, then west to pos24, then north to pos14, then west to pos41. But pos14 to pos41 requires moving left (dirleft) three times, but pos14's dirleft is pos04, which is invalid. So that's not possible.

Wait, pos41 is row4, column1. To get there from pos44, the stone must move west (dirup) three times to column1, and south (dirright) to row4.

Wait, pos44 is row4, column4. dirup (column-1) to pos43 (row4,3), then dirup to pos42 (forbidden), so can't do that. So alternative: dirleft (row-1) to pos34 (row3,4), then dirleft to pos24 (row2,4), then dirleft to pos14 (row1,4). Then dirleft is impossible. So from pos14, the stone can't move further left. So this path doesn't reach pos41.

Therefore, the correct path must involve pushing the stone to pos31, then dirright to pos41. But how?

To get the stone to pos31, the agent must push it from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft), then to pos33 (dirup), then to pos32 (dirup), then to pos31 (dirup), then to pos41 (dirright).

But each push requires the agent to be in the correct position without violating constraints.

Let's outline this plan:

1. Agent moves from pos15 to pos14 (dirup).

2. pos14 to pos24 (dirright).

3. pos24 to pos34 (dirright).

4. pos34 to pos44 (dirright). But pos44 has the stone, so agent can't move there.

So agent is at pos34. To push the stone from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft), the agent must be at pos44's dirright (pos54). So agent needs to get to pos54.

Path from pos34 to pos54:

pos34 → pos44 (dirright), but blocked. So alternative route:

pos34 → pos33 (dirup).

pos33 → pos32 (dirup).

pos32 → pos31 (dirup).

pos31 → pos41 (dirright).

pos41 → pos51 (dirright).

pos51 → pos52 (dirdown).

pos52 → pos53 (dirdown).

pos53 → pos54 (dirdown).

Now, agent is at pos54. Then, push the stone from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft).

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirleft.

Now, agent is at pos44, stone at pos34.

Now, agent needs to push the stone from pos34 to pos33 (dirup). But to do that, agent must be at pos34's dirdown (pos44's dirup is pos43, which is forbidden). Wait, no. To push dirup from pos34 to pos33, agent must be at pos34's dirdown (pos44). Agent is at pos44. So:

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos33 dirup.

After this, agent is at pos34, stone at pos33.

Now, push from pos33 to pos32 (dirup). Agent must be at pos33's dirdown (pos34). So:

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos32 dirup.

Agent moves to pos33 (forbidden by constraint 7). So invalid.

This approach fails.

Alternative idea: Agent moves from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft), then pushes the stone to pos33.

But after the first push, agent is at pos44. Then, move to pos34 (dirleft) which is possible if pos34 is clear. But pos34 has the stone after the first push. So can't move there.

Thus, this path is invalid.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I think the correct plan is:

1. Move the agent from pos15 to pos54 via a long path.

2. Push the stone from pos44 to pos34.

3. Move the agent to pos25 to satisfy the constraint.

4. Continue pushing the stone to pos41.

But I'm not sure. Given the time, I'll attempt to write a possible plan that satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal.
