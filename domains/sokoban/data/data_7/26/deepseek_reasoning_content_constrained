Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So the goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. From the initial state, stone1 is at pos42, which is not a goal. The only goal location mentioned is pos11. So the final state needs stone1 at pos11. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy along the way. Let me list out the constraints first to make sure I don't miss any.

Constraints:
1. Stone1 must be at pos41 in some state, but before that, it must have been at pos21.
2. Location pos51 must not be clear in some state, and before that, the player must have been at pos13.
3. At least one of "stone1 at pos15" or "pos53 not clear" must hold in some state.
4. pos22 must not be clear in some state.
5. Player1 must be at pos52 in some state, and before that, either pos22 isn't clear or stone1 is at pos15.
6. pos41 must not be clear in some state, and before that, player1 was at pos42.
7. The pos51 not clear condition can only hold in at most one continuous sequence. So it can't happen in separate parts of the plan.

Alright, starting with the initial state: player1 is at pos44, stone1 at pos42. pos44 is clear, pos42 is clear. The goal is to get stone1 to pos11.

First, to move stone1 from pos42 to pos11, but considering the constraints. Let's break down each constraint and see how they can be integrated.

Constraint 1: stone1 must be at pos41, but before that, at pos21. So we need to move stone1 from pos42 → ... → pos21 → ... → pos41 → ... → pos11? Wait, but pos41 isn't a goal. Wait, the final goal is just stone1 at any goal location, which is pos11. So maybe after moving stone1 to pos41, we have to move it again towards pos11. But how?

But how to get stone1 from pos42 to pos21 and then to pos41. Let's think about the movement. Stone1 starts at pos42. The agent is at pos44. To push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. So to push stone1 from pos42, the agent can be at pos43 (south of pos42) or pos32 (west) or pos52 (east) or pos41 (north). Wait, pos42's neighbors: looking at the "may move" directions.

Looking at the allowed moves from pos42: the adjacent locations are pos32 (west), pos52 (east), pos41 (up), pos43 (down). So to push stone1 from pos42, the agent needs to be in one of those positions. For example, if the agent is at pos43 (south of stone1 at pos42), then pushing north would move the stone to pos41. Wait, directions can be a bit tricky. Let me check.

The direction for pushing: when the agent is at pos43 and the stone is at pos42, pushing north (dirup) would move the stone to pos41? Wait, pos42 is north of pos43. So if the agent is at pos43 and pushes the stone north (dirup), the stone would move from pos42 to pos41. Wait, maybe directions are relative. So when you push, the direction is the direction from the agent's position to the stone's position. Wait, the action's direction is the direction from the agent's location to the stone's location, and then from the stone's location to the target location. For example, in "pushtogoal" or "pushtonongoal", the agent is at l_p, the stone is at l_from. The agent can push the stone to l_to, which must be in the same direction as the direction from l_p to l_from, and then from l_from to l_to. Wait, the preconditions for "pushtogoal" say that you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d, and from l_from to l_to following direction d. So direction d must be the same for both steps.

So for example, if the agent is at pos43 and wants to push the stone at pos42 to pos41, the direction would be dirup, because moving from pos43 to pos42 is dirup (since pos42 is north of pos43). Then moving from pos42 to pos41 would also be dirup. So that's allowed. So the action would be pushtonongoal (since pos41 is not a goal) with direction dirup.

But pos41 is not a goal, so that's allowed. So pushing stone1 from pos42 to pos41, but first the agent needs to get to pos43.

Wait, initial position of the agent is pos44. To get to pos43, they can move from pos44 to pos43 via dirup or other directions. Let's check the allowed moves from pos44. According to the initial state's movement possibilities, pos44 can move to pos34 (dirleft), pos54 (dirright), pos43 (dirup), pos45 (dirdown). So moving from pos44 to pos43 via dirup. Then, from pos43, they can push stone1 at pos42 north (dirup) to pos41. That would satisfy moving stone1 to pos41. But then according to constraint 1, before stone1 is at pos41, it must have been at pos21. Hmm. So this approach doesn't satisfy that. So maybe stone1 needs to go via pos21 and pos41.

Wait, that's a problem. Because the initial position is pos42. How do we get stone1 to pos21? That's a long path. Let me see the grid layout. The grid is 5x5, with rows 1-5 and columns 1-5. pos11 is top-left, pos55 is bottom-right. So pos42 is row4, column2. pos21 is row2, column1. So moving stone1 from pos42 to pos21 would require moving it left and up. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to move around and push the stone through a series of positions to reach pos21 first, then pos41. Let's outline a possible path. But this could take many steps, and we need to satisfy all constraints.

But perhaps there's a way to loop through the necessary constraints while moving the stone to the goal. Let's consider each constraint step by step.

Constraint 6 requires that pos41 is not clear in some state, and before that, the player was at pos42. So the player must be at pos42 before pos41 is occupied. pos41 is clear initially, so maybe the player moves there, making pos41 not clear, but then moves away. But the constraint says "Location pos41 is not clear" in some state, which could be due to a stone or the agent being there. Since stone1 can be there, perhaps pushing the stone to pos41 would satisfy this. But then before that, the player must be at pos42. So if the player is at pos42, then they can push the stone from pos42 to pos41? Wait, if the agent is at pos42, which is where the stone is. Wait, no: initially, the stone is at pos42, and the agent is at pos44. So the agent can't be at pos42 unless they move there, but the stone is already there. So maybe the agent can't be at pos42 unless the stone is moved first. Wait, but pos42 is clear in the initial state? Wait, the original state says "Location pos42 is clear". Wait, but "stone1 is at location pos42". Wait, that's a contradiction. Wait, looking back at the initial state:

The original state says:

- "stone1 is at location pos42"

- "Location pos42 is clear"

Wait, that's impossible. If a stone is at pos42, then pos42 is not clear. But according to the problem statement, the initial state has:

"Location pos42 is clear" and "stone1 is at location pos42". That can't be. There must be a mistake here.

Wait, let me check again. The initial state:

The user provided:

The original state of the world is the following:

"player1 is at location pos44"

"stone1 is at location pos42"

"Location pos11 is clear"

...

"Location pos42 is clear"

...

But if the stone is at pos42, then pos42 is not clear. So this seems like a contradiction. But maybe in this domain, "clear" refers to being free for movement, and stones are considered as occupying the location. Wait, the problem says "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So if a stone is at pos42, then pos42 is not clear. But according to the initial state, it says "Location pos42 is clear", which contradicts "stone1 is at location pos42". This must be a mistake in the problem description. However, the problem states that this is the initial state, so perhaps there's an error here. But I have to work with the given information.

Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem's initial state. Let's recheck the original state:

Looking at the "original state" section:

- "player1 is at location pos44"

- "stone1 is at location pos42"

Then, in the list of locations that are clear, "Location pos42 is clear" is stated. So according to this, pos42 is clear despite having a stone there. That's a problem. Because according to the problem's description, a location is clear if it contains neither the agent nor a stone. So either the problem has an error, or perhaps "clear" is defined differently. But given that the problem states this, we have to proceed with the given initial state. So perhaps the initial state is incorrectly specified, but we have to take it as given.

Wait, but that's impossible. If stone1 is at pos42, then pos42 is not clear. Therefore, the initial state must have an error. But since the user provided this, perhaps "clear" here refers to something else. Alternatively, maybe "clear" means that the agent can move into it. But according to the problem's action preconditions, for a move action, the destination must be clear (i.e., not occupied by agent or stone). So if stone1 is at pos42, then pos42 is not clear. Therefore, the initial state as described is impossible. But since the user provided this, perhaps it's a typo. Maybe "Location pos42 is clear" is actually "Location pos42 is not clear". Alternatively, maybe the stone is at a different location. But according to the problem, the stone is at pos42 and pos42 is clear. This is conflicting.

But given that the problem is presented this way, perhaps we have to proceed under the assumption that the initial state is correct. Maybe in this domain, a location being clear refers to whether the agent can move there, and stones don't block? But that contradicts the action preconditions. For example, the move action requires that the destination is clear (i.e., not occupied). If the stone is at pos42 and pos42 is clear, then the agent can move into pos42 even though the stone is there. That would be inconsistent with the problem's description.

This seems like a critical issue. However, given that the problem is presented as such, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the way the initial state is presented. Let's assume that the stone's location is correctly stated as pos42, and that pos42 is indeed not clear. But in the initial state, the user lists "Location pos42 is clear" which would be a mistake. But since the problem is given, maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the initial state is correctly described, even if it's contradictory. Alternatively, perhaps "clear" refers to something else, like not having a stone, but allowing the agent. But that's not consistent with the problem's action preconditions.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's initial state, and the stone is actually at pos43, but the user wrote pos42. But without that information, I have to proceed as given. This is a problem. However, given that the user might have made a typo, but since they are the ones providing the problem, I'll have to proceed with the given information.

Assuming that the initial state is correctly specified, even if contradictory, perhaps the "Location pos42 is clear" is a mistake and should be "not clear". But how to proceed? Let's proceed under the assumption that the stone is at pos42, and pos42 is not clear. Therefore, the initial state's statement that pos42 is clear is incorrect. Perhaps that's a typo in the problem, but since the stone is at pos42, the location is not clear. Therefore, when solving the problem, we must assume that pos42 is not clear. However, the problem states "Location pos42 is clear" in the initial state, which conflicts with the stone's position. This is a problem. But perhaps the user intended that the stone is at pos42, making it not clear, but the initial state lists pos42 as clear. This would be an error, but as a solver, I have to work with the given data.

Alternatively, maybe the stone is at pos42, but the location is considered clear for some other reason. But according to the problem's definition, a location is clear if it has neither the agent nor a stone. So this is impossible. Therefore, the problem's initial state is contradictory, making it unsolvable. But that can't be the case. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem's initial state. Perhaps the stone is at pos43 instead of pos42. Let me check again.

Looking back: the user wrote:

The original state of the world is the following:

"player1 is at location pos44"

"stone1 is at location pos42"

Then, in the list of clear locations:

"Location pos42 is clear"

But that's a contradiction. So perhaps the stone is actually at pos43, and there's a typo. Alternatively, the clear statement for pos42 is incorrect. However, since the user provided this, I have to proceed as is. Maybe the problem expects us to ignore the contradiction and proceed. For the sake of solving the problem, I'll assume that the stone is at pos42 and that pos42 is not clear (overriding the given clear statement). Otherwise, the initial state is invalid. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps "clear" in this context refers to something else. For example, maybe a location is clear if there's no stone, but the agent can be there. But that doesn't align with the problem's action preconditions, where moving requires the destination to be clear (i.e., not occupied by agent or stone). So this seems like a critical error. However, given the time constraints, I'll proceed under the assumption that the initial state has a typo and that pos42 is not clear (due to the stone being there), and the statement "Location pos42 is clear" is a mistake. Therefore, in the initial state, pos42 is not clear because the stone is there, and the agent is at pos44. This is necessary for the problem to be solvable.

With that assumption, let's proceed.

The initial state: agent at pos44, stone1 at pos42 (so pos42 is occupied by stone, not clear). The goal is to get stone1 to pos11 (the only goal location). Now, considering the constraints.

Let's start by mapping out the path for the stone from pos42 to pos11. The grid is 5x5. pos42 is (4,2), pos11 is (1,1). So the stone needs to move up and left. Possible path: pos42 → pos32 (left) → pos22 (left) → pos21 (up) → pos11 (left). But that's a possible path. But along the way, we need to satisfy the constraints.

But constraint 1 requires that stone1 is at pos41 in some state, which is (4,1). So how to get stone1 to pos41? That's to the west of pos42's column. So from pos42, pushing it west (dirleft) to pos41? Wait, pos42 is (4,2), so west would be (4,1) which is pos41. So if the agent is at pos42's east (pos52?), but wait, pos42's east is pos52? Wait, pos42's east would be column 3, but pos42 is (row4, column2). East would be column3, so pos43. Wait, no. The movement directions may be different. Wait, in the movement descriptions, for example, from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft), pos52 (dirright), pos41 (dirup), pos43 (dirdown). So direction dirleft from pos42 is to pos32 (same row, left column). dirright would be to pos52 (same row, right column). dirup would be to pos41 (row3? Wait, maybe rows are numbered from top to bottom. For example, pos11 is row1, column1. pos21 is row2, column1. So moving up from pos42 (row4) would go to row3? Or is it the other way around? This is critical for planning.

Wait, the movement directions must be consistent with the given movement possibilities. For example, from pos44, you can move to pos34 (dirleft), which is same row, column3. Or to pos54 (dirright), same row, column5. Or pos43 (dirup) which would be row4, column3? Wait, pos44 is row4, column4. Moving dirup from pos44 would go to pos43 (row4-1=3? Or maybe rows increase downward. This is confusing.

Wait, the movement directions are given in the problem's movement possibilities. For example, "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright". So pos11 to pos21 is dirright. pos11 is (1,1), pos21 is (2,1). So dirright here corresponds to moving down a row. Similarly, "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown". pos11 to pos12 is (1,1) to (1,2), which is right in columns. So direction dirright is down a row, dirdown is right in column. Similarly, dirleft would be up a row, dirup would be left in column? Wait, this is conflicting. Let's look at the movement directions more carefully.

Looking at some examples:

- From pos11 (1,1), moving dirright takes you to pos21 (2,1). So dirright is down a row.

- From pos11, dirdown takes you to pos12 (1,2). So dirdown is right in column.

Similarly, from pos12, dirup takes you to pos11. So dirup is left in column (from 2 to 1). dirright takes you to pos22 (2,2). So dirright is down a row.

So directions:

- dirright: down a row (row+1)

- dirleft: up a row (row-1)

- dirup: left in column (column-1)

- dirdown: right in column (column+1)

Wait, that seems to be the pattern. For example:

pos12 to pos22 is dirright (row increases by 1).

pos12 to pos11 is dirup (column decreases by 1).

pos12 to pos13 is dirdown (column increases by 1).

Similarly, pos21 to pos31 is dirright (row increases by 1).

pos21 to pos22 is dirdown (column increases by 1).

So the directions are:

- dirright: south (row increases)

- dirleft: north (row decreases)

- dirup: west (column decreases)

- dirdown: east (column increases)

Yes, that makes sense. So each direction corresponds to a cardinal direction:

- dirright: south (row+1)

- dirleft: north (row-1)

- dirup: west (column-1)

- dirdown: east (column+1)

So for pos42 (row4, column2), moving dirright (south) would take to row5, column2: pos52.

Moving dirleft (north) to row3, column2: pos32.

Moving dirup (west) to column1: pos41.

Moving dirdown (east) to column3: pos43.

So, to move the stone from pos42 to pos41 (row4, column1), the agent needs to be west (dirup) of the stone. So the agent would be at pos42's west (dirup) which is pos41's east. Wait, no. To push the stone west (dirup direction), the agent needs to be east of the stone (since pushing west requires being on the east side). Wait, no. Because to push the stone west, the agent must be east of the stone (so they can push it west). But according to the action's preconditions, the agent must be at l_p, and the stone is at l_from. The direction d must allow moving from l_p to l_following d, and then from l_from to l_to following d.

So for example, if the agent is at pos43 (east of pos42), and pushes the stone west (dirup), then the direction from pos43 to pos42 is dirup (since to go from pos43 (row4, column3) to pos42 (row4, column2), that's west, which is dirup. Then pushing the stone from pos42 to pos41 (also dirup direction). So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirup.

This would move the stone from pos42 to pos41, with the agent moving to pos42.

But according to constraint 1, stone1 must be at pos41 in some state, but before that, it must have been at pos21. So this approach would not satisfy that. So we need to get stone1 to pos21 at some point before moving it to pos41.

So the plan must include moving stone1 to pos21 first. How to do that? Stone1 is at pos42. To get to pos21, which is row2, column1. So the path would require moving west and north.

Possible path: pos42 → pos32 → pos22 → pos21.

But how to push the stone along that path. Let's break it down.

First, agent is at pos44. To push stone1 from pos42 to pos32 (west), the agent needs to be east of pos42 (pos43) to push west. Wait, no. To push west, the agent needs to be east of the stone. So from pos43 (east of pos42), pushing west (dirup) would move the stone to pos32? Wait, no. pos42 is row4, column2. Pushing west (dirup) would take it to column1, same row: pos41. Wait, no. Wait, direction dirup is west (column-1). So pushing from pos42 to west would be pos41 (row4, column1). But pos32 is row3, column2. So how to get the stone to pos32?

Ah, perhaps the agent needs to push the stone north (dirleft) from pos42. To push north, the agent must be south of the stone (pos43) and push north (dirleft), which would move the stone to pos32 (row3, column2). Because dirleft corresponds to north (row-1). So let's see.

If the agent is at pos43 (south of pos42), the direction from pos43 to pos42 is dirup (west) since pos42 is west of pos43. Wait, no. pos43 is column3, pos42 is column2, same row. So moving from pos43 to pos42 is west (dirup). Then, pushing the stone from pos42 to pos32 (north) would require direction dirleft. Wait, but the direction must be the same for both steps.

The action preconditions for push require that the direction d is the same for moving from l_p to l_from and from l_from to l_to.

So, for example, if the agent is at pos43 (l_p), and the stone is at pos42 (l_from), to push the stone to pos32 (l_to), the direction must be such that from pos43 to pos42 is direction d, and from pos42 to pos32 is also direction d.

What direction d would allow both steps? pos43 to pos42 is west (dirup), and pos42 to pos32 is north (dirleft). These are different directions. Therefore, it's not possible to push the stone from pos42 to pos32 in a single action. So the agent can't do that. Therefore, the stone can't be moved from pos42 to pos32 in one push. So the agent must first move the stone west to pos41, then north to pos31, then west again, but this complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can move around to push the stone in different directions. For example, from pos42, the agent could push it north (dirleft) by being at pos52 (east of pos42), pushing west (dirup) to pos41, but that doesn't help. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternative approach: Let's try to chart a path for the stone from pos42 to pos21, considering the constraints.

Constraint 1: stone1 must be at pos41 after being at pos21. So stone1 must go pos42 → ... → pos21 → ... → pos41 → ... → pos11.

But how to get to pos21 first. Let's think:

To get stone1 from pos42 to pos21:

Possible steps:

1. Push stone1 north (dirleft) from pos42 to pos32 (row3, column2). To do this, the agent needs to be south of pos42 (pos43) and push north (dirleft). Wait, but direction must be the same for both steps. So the agent is at pos43, direction d must allow moving from pos43 to pos42 (which is west, dirup), and then from pos42 to pos32 (north, dirleft). These are different directions, so not possible. Therefore, this approach won't work.

Alternative idea: Push the stone west to pos41, then north to pos31, then west to pos21. Let's see:

Step 1: Push from pos42 to pos41 (west, dirup). Agent starts at pos44, moves to pos43 (dirup from pos44 to pos43), then pushes stone1 to pos41. So action pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirup.

Now stone1 is at pos41. Agent is now at pos42.

But according to constraint 1, stone1 must have been at pos21 before being at pos41. So this step violates the constraint. Therefore, this path is invalid.

So, to satisfy constraint 1, we need to get stone1 to pos21 before it's at pos41. Therefore, the stone's path must go through pos21 before pos41.

Alternative plan: Move the stone from pos42 to pos32, then to pos22, then to pos21, then to pos31, then to pos41, then to pos11.

But how to push from pos42 to pos32. Let's see:

Agent needs to be south of pos42 (pos43) and push north (dirleft). But direction must be the same for both steps.

Wait, if the agent is at pos43, to move to pos42, direction is dirup (west). Then pushing from pos42 to pos32 would require direction dirleft (north). But the directions must be the same. So this isn't possible. Therefore, this approach won't work.

Alternative idea: The agent can move to pos32 (north of pos42) and push the stone east to pos33. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the agent can move around to the other side of the stone.

Wait, maybe the agent can move to pos52 (east of pos42), then push the stone west to pos41. But that's the same as before, and again, constraint 1 isn't satisfied.

This is getting complicated. Let's consider the constraints one by one and see how to integrate them.

Constraint 2: At some point, pos51 is not clear. Before that, the agent was at pos13. So the agent must reach pos13, then later cause pos51 to be not clear. pos51 is clear initially. How to make pos51 not clear? Either by moving the agent there or pushing the stone there. Since the stone's goal is pos11, pushing it to pos51 would be counterproductive, but maybe temporarily. However, pos51 is not a goal location, so pushing the stone there would require using pushtonongoal. Then later moving it away. But this adds steps. Alternatively, the agent could move to pos51, making it not clear. But then they have to leave, which would clear it again. But the constraint requires that pos51 is not clear in at least one state, and that before that, the agent was at pos13.

So possible approach: Agent moves to pos13, then later moves to pos51, making pos51 not clear. But the agent needs to get to pos13 first. Let's see how to get the agent to pos13.

Initial agent position is pos44. To get to pos13, which is row1, column3. The path would be moving north and west. Let's see:

From pos44, possible moves:

pos44 can move to pos34 (dirleft/north), pos54 (dirright/south), pos43 (dirup/west), pos45 (dirdown/east).

To reach pos13, the agent needs to go north and west. For example:

pos44 → pos34 (dirleft) → pos33 (dirleft) → pos32 (dirleft) → pos31 (dirleft) → pos21 (dirleft) → pos11 (dirleft), but then from pos11, maybe move down to pos12, then up to pos13. Wait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, from pos44, move dirup (west) to pos43, then dirup to pos42 (but stone is there, so can't move there. So need to find another path.

Alternatively:

pos44 → pos34 (dirleft/north) → pos24 (dirleft) → pos14 (dirleft) → pos13 (dirdown/east) ?

But the movement possibilities must be checked according to the given allowed moves.

Let's check the allowed moves from pos44:

From pos44, you can move to pos34 (dirleft), pos54 (dirright), pos43 (dirup), pos45 (dirdown).

From pos34, you can move to pos24 (dirleft), pos44 (dirright), pos33 (dirup), pos35 (dirdown).

From pos24, you can move to pos14 (dirleft), pos34 (dirright), pos23 (dirup), pos25 (dirdown).

From pos14, you can move to pos24 (dirright), pos13 (dirup), pos15 (dirdown).

From pos14, moving dirup would go to pos13.

So the path from pos44 to pos13 could be:

pos44 → pos34 (dirleft) → pos24 (dirleft) → pos14 (dirleft) → pos13 (dirup).

Each of these steps requires that the next location is clear. Let's check the initial clear locations:

pos34 is clear initially? According to the initial state, pos34 is clear. Yes. pos24 is clear initially? Yes. pos14 is clear. pos13 is clear. So this path is possible.

So the agent can move from pos44 to pos34 via dirleft, then to pos24 via dirleft, then to pos14 via dirleft, then to pos13 via dirup.

Once at pos13, the agent needs to later make pos51 not clear. pos51 is clear initially. To make pos51 not clear, the agent can move there. So after being at pos13, the agent can move to pos51. But how?

From pos13, possible moves:

pos13 can move to pos23 (dirright/south), pos12 (dirup/west), pos14 (dirdown/east).

To get to pos51, which is row5, column1. So the agent needs to move south and east. But that's a long path. Alternatively, after pos13, the agent can move to pos23, then pos33, pos43, pos53, pos54, pos55, etc. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps after reaching pos13, the agent moves back down to pos14, pos24, etc., eventually moving south to pos51.

But this would take many steps. However, one of the constraints (constraint 5) requires that the agent is at pos52 in some state, and before that, either pos22 is not clear or stone1 is at pos15. So maybe combining these steps.

But this is getting very complex. Let's try to outline a possible plan that satisfies all constraints, step by step.

First, handle constraint 1: stone1 must be at pos41, and before that at pos21. So the stone's path must go through pos21 then pos41.

But how to get from pos42 to pos21. Let's think of a possible path.

pos42 → pos32 → pos22 → pos21.

To push the stone from pos42 to pos32 (north), the agent must be south of pos42 (pos43) and push north (dirleft). But as discussed earlier, the direction must be the same for both steps. So agent at pos43, direction dirup (west) to pos42, then pushing dirup (west) to pos41. That's not helpful. Alternatively, agent at pos52 (east of pos42), direction dirup (west) to pos42, then pushing dirup (west) to pos41. Again, not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe push the stone north from pos42 to pos32. For that, the agent must be south of pos42 (pos43) and push north (dirleft). But the directions must be same. So agent at pos43, direction dirleft (north) to pos42? No. pos43 is south of pos42. To move from pos43 to pos42, direction is dirup (west), since pos42 is west of pos43. Therefore, can't push north from pos42 unless the agent is north of pos42, which is pos32. But pos32 is clear initially.

Wait, agent can move to pos32 and push the stone south. But pos32 is clear. So agent can move to pos32, then push the stone south to pos42. But that's the opposite of what we want.

Alternatively, agent moves to pos33 (south of pos32), then pushes north to pos32. But that requires the stone to be at pos32, which it isn't.

This seems impossible. Therefore, perhaps the stone cannot be moved north from pos42 directly. So maybe the stone must be moved west to pos41 first, then north to pos31, then west to pos21.

Let's try that path.

Step 1: Push stone1 from pos42 to pos41.

Agent at pos43, pushes west (dirup) to pos41. Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirup.

Now, stone1 is at pos41. Agent is at pos42.

But constraint 1 requires that stone1 was at pos21 before being at pos41. So this violates the constraint. Therefore, this approach is invalid.

Alternative idea: Maybe the stone needs to go through pos21 before pos41. But how to get it to pos21 from pos42.

Another approach: Use the pushtonongoal action to move the stone through several steps.

But given the time, perhaps it's better to look for a plan that satisfies all constraints, even if it's longer.

Another constraint: constraint 3 requires that at some state, either stone1 is at pos15 or pos53 is not clear. pos53 is clear initially. So either push the stone to pos15 (which is a non-goal) or have the agent or another stone at pos53. Since there's only one stone, the latter isn't possible. So the agent can move to pos53, making it not clear. But this requires the agent to be there. Alternatively, push the stone to pos15. But pos15 is a non-goal location.

Constraint 4: pos22 must not be clear in some state. So either the agent or the stone is there. Since the stone is the only other object, perhaps the stone is at pos22 or the agent is there.

Constraint 7: The agent must be at pos52 in some state, and before that, either pos22 is not clear or stone1 is at pos15.

Constraint 6: pos41 must not be clear in some state, and before that, the agent was at pos42. So agent must be at pos42 before pos41 is occupied. But pos42 is occupied by the stone initially, so the agent can't be there until the stone is moved. So after moving the stone from pos42, the agent can move to pos42.

Constraint 9: pos41 not clear in some state. So after the stone is pushed to pos41, that satisfies this.

Constraint 8: pos51 not clear can only be in one continuous sequence. So once pos51 is occupied, it can't be cleared and then re-occupied.

Given all these constraints, let's try to outline a plan that satisfies them:

1. Move agent from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft).
2. Move to pos24 (dirleft).
3. Move to pos14 (dirleft).
4. Move to pos13 (dirup). Now agent is at pos13, satisfying the precondition for pos51 not clear later.
5. Move agent from pos13 to pos12 (dirup).
6. Move to pos11 (dirup). Now at pos11, which is a goal location. But we need to get the stone here.
7. But this is just the agent moving. Alternatively, after reaching pos13, the agent needs to go to pos51. Let's see:
   From pos13, move to pos23 (dirright), then to pos33 (dirright), then to pos43 (dirright), then to pos53 (dirright), then to pos54 (dirdown), then to pos55 (dirdown), then to pos54 (dirup), etc. This is time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe after pos13, the agent moves to pos14, then pos24, pos34, pos44, then moves south to pos54, pos55, etc.

But this seems off-track. Let's think of a different approach.

Alternative plan focusing on constraints:

- To satisfy constraint 3 (stone1 at pos15 or pos53 not clear), maybe push the stone to pos15. But pos15 is a non-goal, so we'd have to move it again. Alternatively, have the agent move to pos53, making it not clear.

- To satisfy constraint 4 (pos22 not clear), perhaps push the stone to pos22.

- To satisfy constraint 5 (agent at pos52 after pos22 is not clear or stone at pos15), let's have pos22 not clear (stone there) before agent goes to pos52.

- To satisfy constraint 1 (stone at pos41 after being at pos21), need to route the stone through pos21 and pos41.

- Constraint 9: pos41 not clear (stone there) after agent was at pos42.

But how to connect all these steps.

Perhaps the plan would look like this:

1. Move agent from pos44 to pos43 (dirup).
2. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown) using pushtonongoal. Wait, pos43 is clear initially. So the agent can push the stone from pos42 to pos43. But pos43 is a non-goal location.

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos43 dirdown. Wait, but the direction must be from pos43 to pos42 (dirup) and then from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown). No, the directions must be the same. So this is not possible. The agent at pos43 can push the stone east (dirdown) to pos44, but pos44 is clear. So:

Agent at pos43, stone at pos42. Push east (dirdown) from pos42 to pos43. Wait, no. The agent is at pos43, the stone is at pos42. To push east (dirdown), the agent must be west of the stone (pos41), but the agent is east (pos43). This is confusing.

Alternatively, the agent at pos43 can push the stone west (dirup) to pos41. Then later move the stone to pos21, but this violates constraint 1.

This is getting too time-consuming. Given the time constraints, I'll try to outline a possible plan that satisfies all constraints, even if not optimal.

Proposed steps:

1. Move agent from pos44 to pos43 (dirup).
2. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos41 (dirup). Now stone1 is at pos41. Agent is at pos42.
   - This satisfies constraint 9 (pos41 not clear) and requires agent to have been at pos42 (which they are now). But constraint 1 requires stone1 to be at pos21 before pos41. So this violates constraint 1. Therefore, this step is invalid.

Alternative approach:

1. Move agent to pos13 to satisfy the precondition for pos51 not clear.
   - Path: pos44 → pos34 (dirleft) → pos24 (dirleft) → pos14 (dirleft) → pos13 (dirup).
2. Then move agent to pos51 to make pos51 not clear.
   - Path from pos13 to pos51: pos13 → pos14 (dirdown) → pos24 (dirright) → pos34 (dirright) → pos44 (dirright) → pos54 (dirright) → pos55 (dirdown) → pos54 (dirup) → pos53 (dirup) → pos52 (dirup) → pos51 (dirup). This is long but possible.
3. Now pos51 is not clear (agent there), satisfying constraint 3 and 5.
4. Then, move agent back towards the stone.
   But stone is at pos42. Need to push it towards pos21 and pos41.

But this is taking too long, and I'm not sure. Given the complexity, perhaps the optimal plan involves the following steps, satisfying all constraints:

1. Move agent from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft).
2. Move to pos24 (dirleft).
3. Move to pos14 (dirleft).
4. Move to pos13 (dirup). Now at pos13, satisfying the precondition for pos51.
5. Move agent from pos13 to pos23 (dirright).
6. Move to pos33 (dirright).
7. Move to pos43 (dirright).
8. Move to pos42 (dirup). Now agent is at pos42 (stone was there, but after moving it).
   Wait, but initially stone is at pos42. So agent can't move there until the stone is moved. So this step is impossible. Therefore, after moving the stone, agent can move to pos42.

But this requires first moving the stone. So let's try:

After step 4 (agent at pos13), move back to pos14 → pos24 → pos34 → pos44 (dirright). Then move to pos43 (dirup). Then push stone from pos42 to pos41 (dirup). Now stone is at pos41. Agent at pos42. This violates constraint 1 because stone was never at pos21.

Therefore, this approach is invalid.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I think the correct plan must involve moving the stone to pos21 and then to pos41, but I'm struggling to find the path. Maybe the optimal plan is as follows, even if I can't verify all steps:

```
```
move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirup
move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos41 pos31 dirleft (invalid)
...
```
But this is not correct. Given the time constraints, I'll provide a possible plan that attempts to satisfy all constraints, but I may have missed some steps.
