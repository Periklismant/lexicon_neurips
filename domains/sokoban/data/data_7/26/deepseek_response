**Explanation:**
The plan starts by moving the agent to push the stone to pos41, then moves it through pos21 to satisfy constraints. The agent then moves to pos13 and later to pos51 to meet other constraints. Finally, the stone is pushed to the goal pos11. Each action is chosen to fulfill the preconditions and satisfy all constraints optimally.
