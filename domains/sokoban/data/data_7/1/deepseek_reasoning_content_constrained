Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to move stone1 to a goal location, which is pos25 according to the initial state. The constraints are a bit tricky, so I need to make sure each one is satisfied. Let me start by understanding the initial setup.

The agent (player1) is at pos55, and stone1 is at pos42. The goal location is pos25. The constraints require certain locations to be not clear at some states and others to be clear always. Also, some conditional constraints where if a location is not clear, certain conditions must be met before or after.

First, the main task: get stone1 to pos25. Since pos25 is a goal location, the action must be pushtogoal. But to push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. Let's see the path from pos55 to pos42.

Pos55 is the starting point. The agent can move up to pos54 or left to pos45. Let's see the movement options. From pos55, moving up to pos54 (direction dirup). Then from pos54, perhaps left to pos44 or down to pos55 again. Wait, need to find the shortest path to pos42 where the stone is.

Wait, stone1 is at pos42. The agent needs to get to a position adjacent to pos42 to push it. Looking at the allowed movements: pos42 is connected to pos32 (left), pos52 (right), pos41 (up), pos43 (down). So the agent can approach from pos32, pos52, pos41, or pos43. Let's see the best way.

Starting from pos55, moving up to pos54 (dirup), then left to pos44 (dirleft), then left to pos43 (dirleft again? Wait, from pos44, moving left would go to pos34, not pos43. Wait, the movement directions might be confusing. Let me check the allowed moves again.

Looking at the 'may move from' clauses. For pos55, the agent can move left to pos45 (dirleft) or up to pos54 (dirup). Let's try moving left to pos45 first. From pos45, directions: left to pos35, right to pos55, up to pos44. So pos45 to pos44 (dirup). Then from pos44, can move left to pos34 or right to pos54, or up to pos43. Wait, pos44's movement options: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup", and "You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown". So, to get to pos43, the agent can move up from pos44.

But maybe a better path is from pos55 to pos45 (dirleft), then pos45 to pos44 (dirup), then pos44 to pos43 (dirup). Then from pos43, can move down to pos42 (dirdown). Wait, but the stone is at pos42, so the agent can't move into pos42 unless pushing the stone. Alternatively, the agent can go around to pos52, which is adjacent to pos42's right side.

Wait, let's think differently. The stone is at pos42. To push it towards pos25, which is the goal, the agent needs to push it north (up) or west (left), but pos25 is in the top row. Wait, pos42 is in row 4, column 2. To get to pos25 (row 2, column5?), Wait no, pos25 is row 2, column5? Wait, the locations are posXY where X is the row and Y the column? Let me check the initial state: pos25 is a goal location. So, the agent needs to push stone1 from pos42 to pos25. That's a long path. Let me map out the grid.

Assuming rows are 1 to 5 (top to bottom) and columns 1 to 5 (left to right), so pos25 is row 2, column5. Wait, but pos25 is in the initial state as a goal. The stone is at pos42 (row4, column2). To get to pos25 (row2, column5), the stone needs to move up two rows and right three columns. But pushing a stone requires the agent to be behind it in the direction of movement. For example, to push the stone right, the agent must be to its left.

So possible path: push the stone right to pos52 (pos42 to pos52, direction dirright), then up from pos52 to pos42 (no, that's not right). Wait, maybe moving the stone up (north) from pos42 to pos32, then left to pos31, etc. But pos32 is not a goal. Wait, the only goal is pos25, so the stone must end up there. So the path needs to get the stone from pos42 to pos25.

Let's plan the stone's path. From pos42, possible moves:

- Up to pos32 (if pushed from pos42's south side, but wait, pushing requires the agent to be in the adjacent tile opposite the direction. For example, to push the stone north (dirup), the agent must be south of the stone (pos43), and push it north to pos33. Wait, no. Wait the direction in the action is the direction from the agent's position to the stone's position, then the direction from the stone's position to the target.

Wait the "pushtogoal" action's preconditions: (iv) you can get from l_p to l_from following d, and (v) you can get from l_from to l_to following d. So direction d must be the same for both steps. So, for example, if the agent is at pos43 (south of the stone at pos42), direction dirdown (from pos43 to pos42 is down?), then pushing the stone to pos41? No, wait, direction is the direction from the agent's position to the stone's position (l_p to l_from) and then from the stone's position to the target (l_from to l_to). So if the agent is at pos43 (south of the stone at pos42), then direction d would be dirup (since from pos43 to pos42 is up?), but the movement directions need to be checked.

Wait, the allowed movements are given. For example, pos42 can move to pos32 (dirleft) if moving left from pos42. Wait no, the 'may move from' clauses are about moving between adjacent tiles. For example, from pos42, you can go to pos32 (left), pos52 (right), pos41 (up), pos43 (down). Wait, maybe the directions are based on movement between tiles. So moving from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft (since column decreases), pos42 to pos52 is dirright (column increases), pos42 to pos41 is dirup (row decreases), pos42 to pos43 is dirdown (row increases).

Wait, the direction names might correspond to movement in the grid. For example, dirleft would be moving left (column decreases), dirright (column increases), dirup (row decreases), dirdown (row increases). So to move from pos42 to pos32, direction dirleft (column 2 to 1). Wait, no, pos32 is row3, column2. Wait, maybe the rows and columns are numbered differently. Let me check the movement from pos42.

Looking at the 'may move from' list: 

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft" (dirleft from pos42 to pos32: pos32 is row3, column2. So moving from pos42 (row4, column2) to pos32 (row3, column2) is direction dirup? Or maybe the direction names are relative. Wait, the direction is given as dirleft, but the movement is from pos42 to pos32. So pos42 is (4,2), pos32 is (3,2). That's moving up one row. So direction dirup. But in the movement description, it's listed as dirleft. Hmm, this is confusing. Wait, maybe the directions are named based on the direction of movement in the grid. For example, moving up (row decreases) is dirup, moving down (row increases) is dirdown, left (column decreases) is dirleft, right (column increases) is dirright. But in the movement from pos42 to pos32, the row decreases from 4 to 3, which would be dirup. But according to the given movement, "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft". That's conflicting. So maybe the directions are not aligned with row/column changes. So the movement directions are arbitrary labels. Therefore, I need to look at each allowed movement direction carefully.

For example, from pos42, moving dirleft takes you to pos32. So dirleft corresponds to moving up in the grid (row decreases by 1). Similarly, moving dirright from pos42 takes you to pos52 (row4, column3?), wait pos42 is (4,2), moving right would be column 3. But pos52 is (5,2), which is row5, column2. Wait that's down a row. Wait this is getting confusing. Let me check specific entries.

Looking at the list:

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"

pos42 to pos32: row decreases from 4 to 3, column stays at 2. So direction dirleft here is moving up (row-1). Then, "You may move from location pos42 to location pos52 following direction dirright". pos52 is row5, column2. So that's moving down a row (row+1). So direction dirright here is moving down. Hmm, this suggests that direction labels might not correspond directly to grid directions. That complicates things. So perhaps I need to model the directions based on the given allowed movements.

Alternatively, perhaps the directions are named based on the movement's effect. For example, dirleft could mean moving to the left in the grid (column-1), dirright column+1, dirup row-1, dirdown row+1. But according to the given movement from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft. pos32 is (3,2), which is row-1. So that's dirleft being row-1. But that contradicts the usual left being column-1. This is confusing. Maybe the directions are named based on the movement's direction in terms of the grid's layout, but it's not standard. Therefore, I need to rely on the given movement connections.

Given that, the agent's movement is constrained by the allowed directions between locations. For example, from pos55, the allowed moves are dirleft to pos45 or dirup to pos54. So to move from pos55 to pos45, direction dirleft. Then from pos45, the allowed moves are dirleft to pos35, dirright to pos55, dirup to pos44. So dirup from pos45 is to pos44. Then from pos44, dirup to pos43. So the path from pos55 to pos43 would be: pos55 (dirleft) → pos45 (dirup) → pos44 (dirup) → pos43. Once at pos43, the agent can move to pos42 (dirdown?), but pos42 is where the stone is. Wait, but the stone is at pos42. So the agent can't move into pos42 unless pushing the stone.

Wait, the preconditions for move require that the destination is clear. Since the stone is at pos42, pos42 is not clear. So the agent can't move into pos42. Therefore, to push the stone from pos42, the agent must be in a position adjacent to it. Let's see. The stone is at pos42. Adjacent locations are pos32 (dirleft), pos52 (dirright), pos41 (dirup?), pos43 (dirdown?). Wait, according to the allowed movements from pos42:

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos52 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos41 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown"

So, from pos42, dirleft is to pos32 (row3, column2), dirright to pos52 (row5, column2?), wait pos52 is row5, column2? Because pos42 is (4,2). Then dirright from pos42 would be to pos52 (5,2). So that's moving down one row. So directions are not standard.

So, to push the stone from pos42 to pos52 (direction dirright), the agent must be at pos42's dirright direction, which is pos52. But wait, no. For the push action, the agent must be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (stone's current position) in direction d. Then, the stone moves from l_from to l_to in direction d. So for example, if the agent is at pos52 (which is south of pos42?), and direction d is dirup (from pos52 to pos42), then pushing the stone from pos42 to pos52 (dirdown? Or direction is same as the movement. Wait, the direction d in the push action must be the same for moving from l_p to l_from and from l_from to l_to.

So, for "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d", the agent is at l_p, moves in direction d to l_from (stone's position), then the stone moves in direction d to l_to. So direction d must be a direction that allows moving from l_p to l_from and then from l_from to l_to.

For example, if the agent is at pos43 (south of pos42), then direction d would be dirdown (since moving from pos43 to pos42 is dirdown?), and then from pos42, moving dirdown would be to pos43 again. Wait no, that's not possible. Alternatively, if the agent is at pos43, direction dirdown would take them to pos42, then the stone would be pushed dirdown to pos43. But pos43 must be clear. Wait, but the stone is at pos42, so pos43 must be clear to push it there. But the initial state says pos43 is clear. So maybe that's a way.

But pos43 is a non-goal location. So pushing the stone to pos43 would require using pushtonongoal. But our goal is to get the stone to pos25, which is a goal. So perhaps pushing the stone north (dirup) from pos42 to pos32 (a non-goal), then west to pos31, etc., but that's not helpful. Alternatively, moving the stone east to pos52 (non-goal), then north, but pos52 is not a goal. Wait, the only goal is pos25, so the stone must end up there. So the path needs to be from pos42 to pos25.

Let me think of the path for the stone: pos42 → pos43 → pos44 → pos45 → pos35 → pos25. But pos45 is in row4, column5. Wait, no. Let's see the grid layout again. Maybe the rows are 1 (top) to 5 (bottom), columns 1 (left) to 5 (right). So pos25 is row2, column5. So the stone needs to move up from row4 to row2 and right from column2 to column5.

So possible path: pos42 → pos43 (right?), but pos43 is column3. Then pos43 → pos44 (right again), then pos44 → pos45 (right), pos45 → pos35 (up), pos35 → pos25 (up). But each move requires the agent to be in the correct position to push.

Alternatively, pos42 → pos52 (right), then pos52 → pos53 (down?), but pos53 is column3. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me map the grid:

Row 1: pos11, pos12, pos13, pos14, pos15

Row 2: pos21, pos22, pos23, pos24, pos25

Row 3: pos31, pos32, pos33, pos34, pos35

Row 4: pos41, pos42, pos43, pos44, pos45

Row 5: pos51, pos52, pos53, pos54, pos55

So pos42 is row4, column2. To get to pos25 (row2, column5), the stone needs to move up two rows (from 4 to 2) and right three columns (from 2 to 5).

Possible path:

pos42 → pos43 (right, column3)

pos43 → pos44 (right, column4)

pos44 → pos45 (right, column5)

pos45 → pos35 (up, row3)

pos35 → pos25 (up, row2)

But each push needs to be possible. Let's check the directions.

For example, pushing from pos42 to pos43 (direction dirdown). The agent would need to be at pos43, push the stone from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown). But pos43 must be clear. Initially, pos43 is clear. So agent moves to pos43, then pushes the stone to pos43 (but that's a non-goal location, so pushtonongoal. Then, from pos43, the agent can push the stone to pos44 (right). But pos43 is now occupied by the stone. So the agent needs to be at pos44 to push it right? Or maybe from pos43, the stone is at pos43, agent can be at pos44 (east) and push west into pos43, but that's not possible. Alternatively, agent needs to be in pos43 to push the stone east to pos44. Wait, no. The agent must be adjacent to the stone in the direction of the push. For example, to push the stone east (dirright) from pos43 to pos44, the agent must be west of the stone (pos43's west is pos33?), but pos33 is not adjacent. Wait, pos43's adjacent positions are pos33 (north), pos42 (west), pos44 (east), pos53 (south). So to push the stone east from pos43 to pos44, the agent must be west of the stone (pos43's west is pos42), but pos42 is now empty. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to plan the agent's path to reach the necessary positions to push the stone step by step.

First, the agent starts at pos55. They need to get to pos42 to push the stone. Let's find a path from pos55 to pos42's adjacent tiles.

From pos55, move left (dirleft) to pos45. Then up (dirup) to pos44. Then up to pos43. From pos43, move down (dirdown) to pos42? But pos42 has the stone, so the agent can't move there. So instead, from pos43, the agent is adjacent to pos42 (south). So to push the stone south from pos42 to pos43, the agent needs to be at pos43 and direction dirdown. Wait, for "pushtonongoal" (since pos43 is non-goal), the agent is at l_p (pos43), pushes the stone from l_from (pos42) to l_to (pos43), direction d. So the direction d must allow moving from l_p (pos43) to l_from (pos42), which is direction dirup (since from pos43 to pos42 is up). Wait, no: according to the movement rules, from pos43, moving dirdown leads to pos42? Let me check.

Looking at the allowed movements:

From pos43: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown".

Wait, so from pos43, dirup leads to pos42. So direction dirup is from pos43 to pos42. Therefore, to push the stone from pos42 to pos43, the agent must be at pos43, direction dirup. Then, the stone moves from pos42 to pos43 (dirup). But pos43 is non-goal, so use pushtonongoal.

So the action would be: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos43 dirup.

After this, the stone is at pos43 (non-goal), and the agent is at pos42. Then, the agent can push the stone further. Next step: push the stone from pos43 to pos44. For that, the agent needs to be at pos44, direction dirup (from pos44 to pos43). Wait, no. To push from pos43 to pos44 (east), the agent needs to be west of the stone (pos43's west is pos33?), but that's not adjacent. Wait, from pos43, moving east (dirright) to pos44 is allowed. So agent at pos44, direction dirleft (from pos44 to pos43 is dirleft?), then pushing the stone to pos44. Let's see:

For the action pushtonongoal, agent at pos44 (l_p), stone at pos43 (l_from). To push to pos44 (l_to), direction d must allow moving from pos44 to pos43 (l_p to l_from) and from pos43 to pos44 (l_from to l_to). So direction d would be dirleft (if moving from pos44 to pos43 is dirleft). Then pushing the stone from pos43 to pos44 in dirleft? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, direction dirright. Let's check the allowed directions between pos44 and pos43.

From pos44: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown".

So from pos44 to pos43 is dirup. So to push the stone from pos43 to pos44, the agent must be at pos44, direction dirup (from pos44 to pos43), then the stone moves dirup from pos43 to pos44. Wait, that would require the stone to move up from pos43 to pos44, but pos44 is east of pos43. This is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the direction names are not consistent. Perhaps I should rely on the allowed movements for direction.

In any case, after the stone is at pos43, the agent is at pos42. Then, the agent needs to move around to push the stone further. Let's say after pushing to pos43, the agent is at pos42. Then, the agent can move to pos43 (since pos43 is now occupied by the stone, so no). Wait, after pushing, the agent moves to l_from (pos42). Wait, no: the effect of pushtonongoal is that the agent moves to l_from (pos42). Because in the effects: (iv) agent p is at location l_from. So after pushing from pos43 to pos42 to pos43, the agent would end up at pos42? Wait, no: the action is pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d. The preconditions are agent at l_p (pos43), stone at l_from (pos42). Then, the effects are agent moves to l_from (pos42), stone moves to l_to (pos43). So after this action, the agent is at pos42, and the stone is at pos43.

Then, the agent can move from pos42 to pos43 (since pos43 is now occupied by the stone, so no). The agent can't move into pos43. So the agent is at pos42. To push the stone from pos43 to pos44, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos43. For example, at pos44 (east of pos43), direction dirleft (from pos44 to pos43). Then, push the stone from pos43 to pos44.

So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos44 dirleft. But wait, the direction must allow moving from l_p (pos44) to l_from (pos43) following d (dirleft). From pos44, moving dirleft to pos34? No. Wait, from pos44, the allowed movements are to pos34 (dirleft), pos54 (dirright), pos43 (dirup), pos45 (dirdown). So to move from pos44 to pos43, direction dirup. So for the action, the agent is at pos44 (l_p), stone is at pos43 (l_from), direction d is dirup. Then, the stone moves from pos43 to pos44 (l_to) following dirup. But pos43 to pos44 is east, so how does direction dirup work here? This is getting too complicated. Maybe the directions are not aligned with the grid directions as I thought.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the allowed movements as connections between locations with specific direction labels, regardless of actual grid direction. So for example, from pos43 to pos44 is direction dirdown. So if the agent is at pos43 and wants to push the stone east to pos44, the direction would be dirdown. But I'm getting stuck here.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Agent moves from pos55 to pos45 (dirleft).

2. Agent moves from pos45 to pos44 (dirup).

3. Agent moves from pos44 to pos43 (dirup).

4. Agent pushes stone1 from pos42 to pos43 using pushtonongoal. This requires agent at pos43 (l_p), stone at pos42 (l_from), pushing to pos43 (l_to) with direction dirup (since from pos43 to pos42 is dirup). Wait, no: l_p is pos43, l_from is pos42. To move from l_p (pos43) to l_from (pos42), direction must be allowed. From pos43 to pos42 is dirup. So direction d is dirup. Then, from l_from (pos42) to l_to (pos43) direction dirup. So the stone moves from pos42 to pos43, which is dirup. That makes sense. So the action is:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos43 dirup

After this, the agent is at pos42, stone is at pos43.

Now, the agent needs to push the stone further. From pos43, the next step is to push it east to pos44. To do that, the agent needs to be at pos44 and direction dirup (since from pos44 to pos43 is dirup). So:

5. Agent moves from pos42 to pos43 (can't, because stone is there). So agent needs to go around. From pos42, possible moves: pos32 (dirleft), pos52 (dirright), pos41 (dirup), pos43 (dirdown). But pos43 is occupied by stone. So agent can move to pos41 (dirup from pos42). But pos41 is clear. So:

5. Agent moves from pos42 to pos41 (dirup).

6. Then, agent needs to get to pos44 to push the stone. From pos41, possible moves: pos31 (dirleft), pos51 (dirright), pos42 (dirdown). But pos42 is now clear (since agent was there and moved to pos41). Wait, after the push action, the agent was at pos42. When the agent moves to pos41, pos42 becomes clear. So pos41 is now agent's location. From pos41, the agent can move dirright to pos51, dirleft to pos31, or dirdown to pos42. But to get to pos44, maybe go to pos42, then pos43 (but stone is there), then pos44. Alternatively, go from pos41 to pos31 (dirleft), then pos31 to pos32 (dirdown?), but this seems complicated.

Alternatively, agent could move from pos41 to pos42 (dirdown), then pos42 to pos43 is blocked. Hmm. Maybe another route. Let's see:

From pos41, the agent can move dirright to pos51. Then from pos51, dirdown to pos52. From pos52, dirright to pos53. From pos53, dirup to pos43? But pos43 has the stone. Alternatively, from pos53, dirleft to pos43. But pos43 is occupied. This is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, after step 4, the agent is at pos42. They can move to pos52 (dirright), then to pos53, etc., but I'm not sure. Maybe there's a better path.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos43, the agent is at pos42. Then, agent can move dirright to pos52. From pos52, move dirup to pos42 (but pos42 is clear now). Wait, no. From pos52, allowed moves are dirleft to pos42, dirup to pos51, or dirdown to pos53. So agent can move to pos42 (dirleft) from pos52. But pos42 is clear now. So:

5. Agent moves from pos42 to pos52 (dirright).

6. From pos52, agent can move dirleft to pos42, but that's back. Or dirup to pos51. Or dirdown to pos53. Maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, after step 4, agent at pos42. Move dirup to pos41. Then dirleft to pos31. From pos31, move dirright to pos41 again. Not helpful.

This approach seems stuck. Maybe I need to find a different path for the stone.

Alternative plan: push the stone from pos42 to pos52 (dirright), then from pos52 to pos53 (dirdown), then to pos54, etc. But pos52 is a non-goal location. Wait, but the goal is to get the stone to pos25, which is a goal location. So perhaps pushing the stone up through the right side of the grid.

Alternatively, push the stone west to pos32, then north to pos22, then west to pos21, but pos21 is not a goal. No, the goal is pos25. Hmm.

Alternatively, push the stone up to pos32 (dirleft from pos42), then to pos22 (dirleft from pos32), then to pos21 (dirleft from pos22), but pos21 is not a goal. Not helpful.

Alternatively, push the stone up to pos32, then right to pos33, pos34, pos35, then up to pos25. But pos35 is row3, column5. To get to pos25 (row2, column5), the stone needs to move up from pos35 to pos25. So that could work.

So steps:

1. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft).

2. Push from pos32 to pos33 (dirright).

3. Push from pos33 to pos34 (dirright).

4. Push from pos34 to pos35 (dirright).

5. Push from pos35 to pos25 (dirup).

Each of these steps requires the agent to be in the correct position.

Starting with step 1: Push from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft). For this, the agent needs to be at pos32's direction dirright (since to push left, the agent must be to the right of the stone). Wait, the direction in the push action must be such that the agent moves from l_p to l_from (stone's current position) in direction d, and then the stone moves from l_from to l_to in direction d. So to push the stone from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft), the agent must be at pos42's right (pos52), and direction dirleft. But from pos52 to pos42 is dirleft. So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft. Wait, no. The direction d must allow moving from l_p (pos52) to l_from (pos42) and then from l_from (pos42) to l_to (pos32). So from pos52 to pos42 is dirleft (since pos52 to pos42 is allowed with direction dirleft). Then, from pos42 to pos32 is also dirleft. So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft. But pos32 is a non-goal location. So this is valid.

But first, the agent needs to reach pos52. From pos55, move dirleft to pos45, then dirup to pos44, dirup to pos43, then dirdown to pos42 (but pos42 has the stone). Alternatively, agent moves from pos55 to pos45 (dirleft), pos45 to pos44 (dirup), pos44 to pos43 (dirup), pos43 to pos42 (dirdown), but pos42 is occupied by the stone. So agent needs to go around.

Alternative path to pos52:

pos55 → pos54 (dirup)

pos54 → pos53 (dirleft)

pos53 → pos52 (dirleft)

So:

1. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup

2. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirdown (wait, from pos54, the allowed moves are dirleft to pos44, dirup to pos53? Wait, no. From pos54's allowed movements:

"You may move from location pos54 to location pos44 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos54 to location pos53 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos54 to location pos55 following direction dirdown"

So to get to pos53 from pos54, direction dirup. So:

1. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup

2. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup

3. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirleft (from pos53, allowed movements include dirleft to pos43, but wait, pos53's allowed moves:

"You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos53 to location pos52 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown"

So to get to pos52 from pos53, direction dirup. So:

3. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup

Now the agent is at pos52. Now, they can push the stone from pos42 to pos32 dirleft.

But the stone is at pos42, so the agent at pos52 can push it to pos32. The action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft

But wait, check preconditions:

(i) agent is at pos52: yes.

(ii) stone is at pos42: yes.

(iii) pos32 is clear: initial state says pos32 is clear.

(iv) can move from pos52 to pos42 following dirleft: yes, as per movement rules.

(v) can move from pos42 to pos32 following dirleft: yes.

(vi) pos32 is not a goal: yes, so pushtonongoal is correct.

After this action, the agent moves to pos42, stone moves to pos32. Now, the stone is at pos32.

Next step: push from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft). Agent needs to be east of pos32 (pos42 is now clear). But after the previous action, the agent is at pos42. To push stone1 from pos32 to pos22, the agent needs to be at pos32's east (pos42), direction dirleft.

So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft.

Check preconditions:

(i) agent at pos42: yes.

(ii) stone at pos32: yes.

(iii) pos22 is clear: initial state says pos22 is clear.

(iv) can move from pos42 to pos32 dirleft: yes.

(v) can move from pos32 to pos22 dirleft: yes.

(vi) pos22 is not a goal: correct.

After this, agent is at pos32, stone at pos22.

Next step: push from pos22 to pos21 (dirleft). Agent needs to be east of pos22 (pos32). So:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos21 dirleft.

Check:

(i) agent at pos32: yes.

(ii) stone at pos22: yes.

(iii) pos21 is clear: initial state says pos21 is clear.

(iv) can move from pos32 to pos22 dirleft: yes.

(v) can move from pos22 to pos21 dirleft: yes.

(vi) pos21 is not a goal: correct.

After this, agent at pos22, stone at pos21. But pos21 is not a goal. This is not helpful. Wait, the goal is to get to pos25. So pushing left is not the right direction. Maybe instead of pushing left from pos32, push up.

Wait, pos32 is row3, column2. To get to pos25 (row2, column5), the stone needs to move right to column5 and up to row2. So after pos32, perhaps push the stone to pos33 (dirright), then to pos34, pos35, then up to pos25.

So after step 1: stone at pos32.

Step 2: push from pos32 to pos33 (dirright). Agent needs to be west of pos32 (pos22) to push it east. But pos22 is clear. So agent needs to get to pos22. Current agent location is pos42 (after first push). From pos42, agent can move to pos32 (dirleft). Then from pos32, move to pos22 (dirleft). Then push the stone from pos32 to pos33 dirright.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's see:

After first push, agent is at pos42. Stone is at pos32.

Agent needs to get to pos33 to push the stone east. Or wait, to push east from pos32, the agent must be west of pos32 (pos22) and push east. Or east of pos32 (pos42) and push west. Wait, no. The direction d must be the same for both moves. For example, to push the stone east from pos32 to pos33, the agent must be at pos32's west (pos22), and direction dirright. Because from pos22 to pos32 is dirright, then from pos32 to pos33 is dirright.

So agent needs to be at pos22. But pos22 is clear. How to get there?

From pos42, agent can move dirup to pos32 (dirleft from pos42 to pos32). Then from pos32, move dirleft to pos22. So:

2. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft

3. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft

Now agent is at pos22. Now, push the stone from pos32 to pos33 dirright.

4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos33 dirright

Check preconditions:

(i) agent at pos22: yes.

(ii) stone at pos32: yes.

(iii) pos33 is clear: yes.

(iv) can move from pos22 to pos32 dirright: yes.

(v) can move from pos32 to pos33 dirright: yes.

(vi) pos33 is not a goal: correct.

After this, agent is at pos32, stone at pos33.

Next step: push from pos33 to pos34 dirright. Agent needs to be at pos33's west (pos23) to push east. But pos23 is clear. So agent needs to get to pos23.

From pos32, agent can move dirright to pos33 (but stone is there). Alternatively, move dirup to pos22, then dirright to pos23. From pos22, allowed movements include dirright to pos32 (no), wait pos22's allowed moves:

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos32 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos21 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos23 following direction dirdown"

So from pos22, move dirdown to pos23.

So steps:

5. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup

6. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown

Now agent is at pos23. Push stone from pos33 to pos34 dirright.

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos34 dirright

Check:

(i) agent at pos23: yes.

(ii) stone at pos33: yes.

(iii) pos34 clear: yes.

(iv) can move from pos23 to pos33 dirright: yes (from pos23 to pos33 is dirright? Let me check pos23's allowed movements:

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos33 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos22 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos24 following direction dirdown"

Yes, so direction dirright from pos23 to pos33.

(v) can move from pos33 to pos34 dirright: yes.

After this action, agent is at pos33, stone at pos34.

Next step: push from pos34 to pos35 dirright. Agent needs to be at pos34's west (pos24), but pos24 is clear. So agent needs to get to pos24.

From pos33, agent can move dirright to pos34. But stone is there. Alternatively, move dirup to pos23, then dirright to pos24.

From pos23, allowed moves include dirdown to pos24.

So:

8. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirup

9. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown

Now agent is at pos24. Push stone from pos34 to pos35 dirright.

10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos35 dirright

Check:

(i) agent at pos24: yes.

(ii) stone at pos34: yes.

(iii) pos35 is clear: yes.

(iv) can move from pos24 to pos34 dirright: yes (pos24 to pos34 is dirright).

(v) can move from pos34 to pos35 dirright: yes.

After this, agent is at pos34, stone at pos35.

Finally, push the stone from pos35 to pos25 dirup. Agent needs to be south of pos35 (pos45) to push north. So agent needs to get to pos45.

From pos34, agent can move dirright to pos44, then dirdown to pos45.

But pos44 is clear. Let's plan:

11. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

12. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown

Now agent is at pos45. Now, push the stone from pos35 to pos25 dirup.

13. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos35 pos25 dirup

Check preconditions:

(i) agent at pos45: yes.

(ii) stone at pos35: yes.

(iii) pos25 is clear: yes.

(iv) can move from pos45 to pos35 dirup: yes (from pos45 to pos35 is dirleft? Or according to movement rules: "You may move from location pos45 to location pos35 following direction dirleft", so direction dirleft. But the action requires moving from pos45 to pos35 dirup. Wait, but according to the allowed movements, pos45 to pos35 is dirleft. So direction d must be dirleft.

So the action should be:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos35 pos25 dirleft.

Wait, but from pos35 to pos25 is dirleft? Let me check pos35's allowed movements:

"You may move from location pos35 to location pos25 following direction dirleft"

Yes, so from pos35 to pos25 is dirleft. So direction d for the push is dirleft.

So the action is:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos35 pos25 dirleft

Check:

(i) agent at pos45: yes.

(ii) stone at pos35: yes.

(iii) pos25 is clear: yes.

(iv) can move from pos45 to pos35 dirleft: yes (allowed movement from pos45 to pos35 dirleft).

(v) can move from pos35 to pos25 dirleft: yes.

(vi) pos25 is a goal: yes.

This action would move the stone to pos25, satisfying the goal.

Now, checking all constraints:

1. "Location pos25 is not clear" must hold in at least one state. After step 13, the stone is at pos25, so pos25 is not clear. So this is satisfied.

2. If pos25 is not clear in some state s, then "pos51 not clear" or "stone1 at pos11" must hold in s or after. However, in this plan, pos51 remains clear, and stone1 never goes to pos11. So this constraint is violated. Oh no, this is a problem.

This means that when pos25 becomes not clear (after step 13), we need to ensure that either pos51 is not clear at some point after, or stone1 is at pos11. But in this plan, neither happens. Therefore, this plan is invalid.

So I need to adjust the plan to satisfy this constraint. Let's see: after pos25 is not clear, we need to have either pos51 not clear (i.e., agent or stone there) or stone1 at pos11. Since stone1 is at pos25, we need to make sure that pos51 is not clear in some state after s.

But how? The agent could move to pos51 after pushing the stone to pos25. But that would require an additional move. However, the problem requires an optimal plan with minimal steps. But since this constraint is necessary, we have to include it.

So after step 13, the agent is at pos35. To make pos51 not clear, the agent can move to pos51. Let's plan that:

14. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright (but pos35 to pos45 is dirright? From pos35's allowed movements: "You may move from location pos35 to location pos25 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos35 to location pos45 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos35 to location pos34 following direction dirup".

So agent can move from pos35 to pos45 dirright.

Then from pos45 to pos55 dirright (but pos55 is clear).

15. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright

But pos55 is clear, so that's allowed. Then from pos55, move to pos54 dirup, pos54 to pos53 dirup, pos53 to pos52 dirup, pos52 to pos51 dirleft.

Alternatively, from pos45, move to pos55, then to pos54, pos53, pos52, pos51.

But this adds several steps. However, the constraint requires that if pos25 is not clear (which it is after step 13), then either pos51 is not clear or stone1 is at pos11 at some state after. Since stone1 is at pos25, the only option is to make pos51 not clear. So the agent must move to pos51 after step 13.

But this makes the plan longer. Is there a way to satisfy this constraint without adding steps?

Alternatively, during the plan, maybe the agent passes through pos51 earlier. For example, in the initial path, after pushing the stone to pos32, maybe the agent goes to pos51 and then comes back. But that would add steps.

Alternatively, after step 13, the agent moves to pos51 in a few steps:

13. pushtogoal ... (stone at pos25, agent at pos35)

14. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright

15. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright

16. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup

17. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup

18. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup

19. move player1 pos52 pos51 dirleft

Now, pos51 is not clear (agent there). So the constraint is satisfied: after pos25 is not clear (step13), in a later state (step19), pos51 is not clear.

But this adds 6 steps, making the plan longer. But the problem requires an optimal plan, so this approach may not be optimal. Are there other ways to satisfy this constraint earlier?

Another option: during the plan, make sure that pos51 is not clear at some point. For example, after moving to pos52 earlier, the agent could briefly visit pos51, then return. But this would add steps.

Alternatively, during the initial movement to reach the stone, the agent could pass through pos51. For example, instead of going via pos45, pos44, pos43, etc., the agent goes via pos55 to pos54, pos53, pos52, pos51, then to pos41, etc. Let's see:

Alternative agent path:

1. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup

2. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup

3. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup

4. move player1 pos52 pos51 dirleft

Now, pos51 is not clear (agent there). Then proceed to push the stone.

But this adds steps, but satisfies the constraint that pos51 is not clear at some point. However, the constraint requires that if pos25 is not clear, then pos51 must be not clear at some point after. So even if pos51 was not clear before pos25 is not clear, does that satisfy the constraint? The constraint says: if in some state s, pos25 is not clear, then there must be a state after or at s where pos51 is not clear or stone1 is at pos11. So if pos51 was not clear before s, but then becomes clear again, that doesn't satisfy. It needs to hold at s or after.

So in the original plan, after step 13 (pos25 not clear), the agent needs to make pos51 not clear after that.

So adding steps after step13 to move to pos51 is necessary.

But this makes the plan longer. Is there a way to incorporate this into the plan without adding steps? For example, after pushing the stone to pos25, the agent moves to pos51 as part of the optimal path. But why would that be necessary?

Alternatively, maybe during the plan, the agent has to move through pos51 for some reason. But in the current plan, they don't.

So perhaps the initial plan is invalid due to the second constraint, and needs to be adjusted.

This makes the problem more complex. Let's think of another approach where pos51 is not clear after pos25 is not clear.

Alternative plan idea: after pushing the stone to pos25, the agent moves to pos51. But how?

After step13: agent is at pos35.

From pos35, possible moves: dirleft to pos25 (but pos25 has stone), dirright to pos45, dirup to pos34.

So:

14. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright

15. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright

16. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup

17. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup

18. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup

19. move player1 pos52 pos51 dirleft

Now, pos51 is occupied by the agent. This satisfies the constraint because after step13 (s state where pos25 is not clear), in step19, pos51 is not clear.

But this adds 6 steps, which may not be optimal. Is there a shorter path?

From pos35 to pos45 (step14), then pos45 to pos55 (step15). Then pos55 to pos54 (step16). Then pos54 to pos53 (step17). pos53 to pos52 (step18). pos52 to pos51 (step19). That's 6 steps. Alternatively, from pos35, find a shorter path to pos51.

pos35 → pos34 (dirup)

pos34 → pos33 (dirup)

pos33 → pos32 (dirup)

pos32 → pos31 (dirup)

pos31 → pos41 (dirright)

pos41 → pos51 (dirright)

That's 6 steps as well. No improvement.

Alternatively, pos35 → pos45 (dirright), pos45 → pos55 (dirright), pos55 → pos54 (dirup), pos54 → pos44 (dirleft), pos44 → pos43 (dirup), pos43 → pos42 (dirup), pos42 → pos52 (dirright), pos52 → pos51 (dirleft). Still many steps.

This seems unavoidable. Therefore, the initial plan would have to include these steps, making the total steps 13 (original) +6 =19, which is not optimal. Hence, the initial approach is flawed.

Alternative approach: find a path that satisfies all constraints without requiring extra steps. Let's revisit the constraints.

Constraints:

1. pos25 not clear in at least one state. Satisfied by the stone being there.

2. If pos25 not clear, then pos51 not clear or stone1 at pos11 at s or after.

3. pos31 not clear in at most one continuous sequence.

4. pos52 not clear in at least one state.

5. If pos52 not clear, then earlier state with player1 at pos51.

6. pos21 not clear in at least one state.

7. If pos21 not clear, then earlier state with pos35 not clear or player1 at pos43.

8. player1 at pos23 in at least one state.

9. If player1 at pos23, then pos41 not clear or pos53 not clear at or after.

10. pos13 not clear in at least one state.

11. pos24 clear in every state.

So, the constraints require that during the plan:

- pos52 must be not clear (agent or stone there) at some point.

- When pos52 is not clear, the agent must have been at pos51 earlier.

- pos21 must be not clear at some point, and when it is, the agent must have been at pos43 or pos35 was not clear earlier.

- The agent must be at pos23 at some point, and when they are, either pos41 or pos53 is not clear at or after.

- pos13 must be not clear at some point.

- pos24 must remain clear always.

Additionally, the plan must be optimal (shortest possible).

So perhaps integrating these constraints into the plan can help satisfy them without extra steps.

For example, ensuring that when the agent is at pos23, they have either pos41 or pos53 not clear. If during the plan, the agent pushes a stone to pos41 or pos53, but there's only one stone (stone1). Since stone1 is being moved to pos25, pos41 and pos53 can only be occupied by the agent.

So when the agent is at pos23, if the agent is at pos23 and then moves to pos53, making pos53 not clear, that satisfies the condition. Or if the agent is at pos41 before.

Let me think of a plan that naturally incorporates these constraints.

Alternative plan:

1. Move agent from pos55 to pos54 (dirup)

2. Move to pos53 (dirup)

3. Move to pos52 (dirup) – now pos52 is not clear (agent there), satisfying constraint 4.

4. Before this, agent must have been at pos51. But pos51 is not visited yet. So this violates constraint 5. So to satisfy constraint 5, when pos52 is not clear, agent must have been at pos51 earlier. So agent must visit pos51 before step3.

Therefore, the agent must visit pos51 before making pos52 not clear. So:

1. Move to pos54 (dirup)

2. Move to pos53 (dirup)

3. Move to pos52 (dirup) – but this violates constraint5 because agent hasn't been to pos51.

Alternative path:

1. Move to pos55 to pos54 (dirup)

2. pos54 to pos53 (dirup)

3. pos53 to pos52 (dirup)

4. pos52 to pos51 (dirleft) – now pos51 is not clear.

But then, when pos52 was not clear (step3), the agent had not been to pos51 yet. So this violates constraint5. So the agent must be at pos51 before pos52 is occupied.

Therefore, the agent must go to pos51 first, then to pos52.

For example:

1. pos55 → pos54 (dirup)

2. pos54 → pos53 (dirup)

3. pos53 → pos52 (dirup) – invalid, as agent hasn't been to pos51.

Alternative:

1. pos55 → pos54 (dirup)

2. pos54 → pos53 (dirup)

3. pos53 → pos52 (dirup)

4. pos52 → pos51 (dirleft)

Now, pos52 is not clear in step3, but before that, agent was at pos53, not pos51. So this doesn't satisfy constraint5.

Thus, the agent must visit pos51 before moving to pos52.

So:

1. pos55 → pos54 (dirup)

2. pos54 → pos53 (dirup)

3. pos53 → pos52 (dirup) – but this is invalid because constraint5 requires agent to have been at pos51 before pos52 is occupied. So the agent must first go to pos51.

Alternative path:

1. pos55 → pos54 (dirup)

2. pos54 → pos53 (dirup)

3. pos53 → pos52 (dirup)

But this violates constraint5. So instead:

1. pos55 → pos54 (dirup)

2. pos54 → pos53 (dirup)

3. pos53 → pos52 (dirup)

4. pos52 → pos51 (dirleft)

Now, after step4, pos51 is not clear, but step3 already had pos52 not clear without prior visit to pos51. Therefore, this is invalid.

Correct approach:

Agent must visit pos51 before step where pos52 is occupied. So:

1. pos55 → pos54 (dirup)

2. pos54 → pos53 (dirup)

3. pos53 → pos52 (dirup) – invalid, needs prior visit to pos51.

Alternative path:

Agent first moves to pos51:

1. pos55 → pos54 (dirup)

2. pos54 → pos53 (dirup)

3. pos53 → pos52 (dirup)

4. pos52 → pos51 (dirleft)

But in step3, pos52 is not clear without prior visit to pos51. So this is invalid.

Thus, the agent must reach pos51 before moving to pos52. For example:

1. pos55 → pos54 (dirup)

2. pos54 → pos53 (dirup)

3. pos53 → pos52 (dirup)

But agent hasn't been to pos51. Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, the agent must take a different path to pos52 that includes pos51.

For example:

1. pos55 → pos54 (dirup)

2. pos54 → pos53 (dirup)

3. pos53 → pos52 (dirup)

4. pos52 → pos51 (dirleft)

But step3 violates constraint5. Therefore, the only way is to first go to pos51, then to pos52.

So:

1. pos55 → pos54 (dirup)

2. pos54 → pos53 (dirup)

3. pos53 → pos52 (dirup) – can't do this yet.

Alternative path:

1. pos55 → pos54 (dirup)

2. pos54 → pos53 (dirup)

3. pos53 → pos43 (dirleft)

4. pos43 → pos42 (dirup)

5. pos42 → pos52 (dirright)

But then, in step5, agent is at pos52, but prior to that, agent was at pos42, which is not pos51. So still violates constraint5.

Alternative approach: agent first visits pos51, then pos52, then proceeds to push the stone.

But how?

From pos55, the agent can:

1. move to pos54 (dirup)

2. move to pos53 (dirup)

3. move to pos52 (dirup)

4. move to pos51 (dirleft)

Now, pos51 is occupied. Then, agent can move back to pos52, pos53, etc.

But this adds steps. Let's say after step4, agent is at pos51.

Then, to push the stone, the agent needs to reach pos42.

So from pos51, agent can:

5. move to pos52 (dirright)

6. move to pos53 (dirdown)

7. move to pos43 (dirleft)

8. move to pos42 (dirup)

But this is a long path.

Alternatively, from pos51, move to pos41 (dirleft), then to pos42 (dirdown).

But pos41 is clear.

So steps:

5. move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft

6. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown

Now agent is at pos42, which is where the stone is. So they can push it.

But pos42 has the stone. So agent can't move there unless pushing.

Thus, agent must push the stone from pos42 to pos52 (dirright).

So after step6, agent is at pos42, stone at pos52.

But then, this satisfies constraint4 (pos52 not clear), and since agent was at pos51 earlier (step4), this satisfies constraint5.

Now, the stone is at pos52 (non-goal). Next, push it to pos53 (dirdown), then to pos54, pos55, then up to pos45, etc., but this seems long.

Alternatively, push the stone from pos52 to pos53 (dirdown), then to pos54 (dirdown), then to pos55 (dirdown), then left to pos45, up to pos35, then up to pos25.

But this would require many steps. However, this may help satisfy other constraints.

For example, when pushing the stone to pos53, pos53 becomes not clear, which could satisfy the constraint when agent is at pos23 (if we can arrange that).

This is getting too complicated. Given the time constraints, I'll try to draft a plan that satisfies all the constraints while being as short as possible.

Here's a possible plan that incorporates the necessary constraints:

1. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup

2. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup

3. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup

4. move player1 pos52 pos51 dirleft

   (Now, pos51 is not clear, satisfying part of constraint5 when pos52 is not clear later)

5. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirright

   (Now pos52 is not clear again, but agent was at pos51 in step4, satisfying constraint5)

6. move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft

   (Agent moves to pos42, which is where the stone is)

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos42 pos52 dirright

   (Wait, can't push from pos42 to pos52. The agent is at pos42 (l_p), stone is at pos42 (l_from)? No, the stone is at pos42. To push it, the agent must be adjacent. So this step is incorrect.)

Let me correct this. After step5, agent is at pos52. To push the stone from pos42 to pos52, the agent must be at pos52, direction dirleft (since from pos52 to pos42 is dirleft). So:

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos52 dirleft

But pos52 must be clear. However, the agent is at pos52, so pos52 is not clear. So the stone can't be pushed to pos52. This is invalid.

Alternative approach: after step5, agent is at pos52. To push the stone from pos42 to pos52, the agent must be at pos52 and the stone at pos42, and pos52 must be clear. But pos52 is occupied by the agent. Therefore, this is impossible.

Thus, the agent needs to move to a position adjacent to pos42 to push it. For example, pos52 is adjacent to pos42's east. So the agent at pos52 can push the stone west to pos42's west (pos32), but that's not helpful. Alternatively, push the stone south to pos43.

But this requires the agent to be at pos43's north (pos33) to push south. This is getting too complex.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity of the constraints, I think the optimal plan would involve moving the stone directly to pos25 while satisfying all constraints through strategic movements. However, I'm struggling to find a path that satisfies all the constraints without adding steps. Perhaps the key is to ensure that during the stone's movement, the agent passes through pos23 and pos51, and that pos52 and pos21 are occupied at some point.

Given the time constraints, I'll provide a sample plan that attempts to meet all the constraints, even if it's not optimal. This may require adjustments.
