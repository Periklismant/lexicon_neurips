Let me start by understanding the problem:

1. We have a 2D grid where each cell can contain an agent, a stone, or be empty.
2. The goal is to move all stones to goal positions.
3. We have several actions: move, pushtogoal, pushtonongoal.
4. We need to create a valid plan to reach the goal state while satisfying the given constraints.

First, I'll visualize the world to understand better:

The world is a 5x5 grid, where positions are labeled as 'posXY' where X is the row and Y is the column. It seems like the 5x5 grid can be visualized as:

```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25 (goal)
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

Let's understand the initial state:
- The player is at pos55 (bottom right)
- stone1 is at pos42 (4th row, 2nd column)
- All locations except pos42 and pos55 are clear
- pos25 is a goal location

The goal is to get stone1 to a goal location, which means getting stone1 to pos25.

Now, let's understand the constraints:
1. "Location pos25 is not clear" must hold in at least one state.
2. If "Location pos25 is not clear" holds in a state s, then "Location pos51 is not clear" or "stone1 is at location pos11" must hold in state s or a subsequent state.
3. "Location pos31 is not clear" can only hold in one continuous sequence of states.
4. "Location pos52 is not clear" must hold in at least one state.
5. If "Location pos52 is not clear" holds, there must be an earlier state where "player1 is at location pos51".
6. "Location pos21 is not clear" must hold in at least one state.
7. If "Location pos21 is not clear" holds, there must be an earlier state where "Location pos35 is not clear" or "player1 is at location pos43".
8. "player1 is at location pos23" must hold in at least one state.
9. If "player1 is at location pos23" holds in a state s, then "Location pos41 is not clear" or "Location pos53 is not clear" must hold in state s or a subsequent state.
10. "Location pos13 is not clear" must hold in at least one state.
11. "Location pos24 is clear" must hold in every state.

Let's think about how to get the stone to the goal (pos25). We'll need to push it, but we need to get to a position adjacent to the stone and push it in the direction of pos25. The stone is at pos42, so we need to get to a position like pos41, pos43, pos32, or pos52 to push the stone.

Given the constraints, let's plan out the steps:

1. Move to get to pos41 from pos55 (so we can push the stone from left).
2. Push the stone from pos42 to a position on a path to pos25.
3. Continue pushing or moving until the stone is at pos25 (goal).

Let's trace a path from pos42 to pos25:
pos42 -> pos32 -> pos22 -> pos23 -> pos24 -> pos25

Let's plan the steps:

1. Player starts at pos55.
2. We need to move to pos41 to push the stone from pos42 to pos32.
3. Then, move to push the stone from pos32 to pos22.
4. Push the stone from pos22 to pos23.
5. Then to pos24.
6. Finally to pos25.

Let's also keep in mind the constraints as we plan:

First, let's list the actions we need to perform to get the stone to the goal:

1. Move from pos55 to pos54
2. Move from pos54 to pos53
3. Move from pos53 to pos43
4. Move from pos43 to pos33
5. Move from pos33 to pos32 (so player is at pos32, stone at pos42)
6. Move from pos32 to pos31 (constraint 3 - pos31 not clear will happen once)
7. Move from pos31 to pos41 (now player is at pos41, stone at pos42)
8. Push stone from pos42 to pos32 (player at pos41, stone at pos42, direction up)

Now, player is at pos42, stone is at pos32.

9. Move from pos42 to pos43
10. Move from pos43 to pos33
11. Move from pos33 to pos23 (constraint 8 - player at pos23)
12. Move from pos23 to pos22 (now player is at pos22, stone at pos32)
13. Move from pos22 to pos32 (now player is at pos32, stone at pos32)
14. Push stone from pos32 to pos22 (player at pos32, stone at pos32, direction up)

Now, player is at pos32, stone is at pos22.

15. Move from pos32 to pos33
16. Move from pos33 to pos23 (now player is at pos23, stone at pos22)
17. Push stone from pos22 to pos23 (player at pos23, stone at pos22, direction left)

Now, player is at pos22, stone is at pos23.

18. Move from pos22 to pos23 (now player is at pos23, stone at pos23)
19. Push stone from pos23 to pos24 (player at pos23, stone at pos23, direction down)

Now, player is at pos23, stone is at pos24.

20. Push stone from pos24 to pos25 (player at pos24, stone at pos24, direction down)

Now, player is at pos24, stone is at pos25 (goal).

But wait, I realize there's an issue with the above plan. The constraints require that "Location pos24 is clear" at all times. But in step 19, the stone is at pos24. So the plan above won't work.

Let's adjust our path:

pos42 -> pos32 -> pos22 -> pos12 -> pos13 -> pos23 -> pos33 -> pos34 -> pos35 -> pos25

Let's plan again:

1. Move from pos55 to pos54
2. Move from pos54 to pos53
3. Move from pos53 to pos43
4. Move from pos43 to pos33
5. Move from pos33 to pos32 (so player is at pos32, stone at pos42)
6. Move from pos32 to pos31 (constraint 3 - pos31 not clear will happen once)
7. Move from pos31 to pos41 (now player is at pos41, stone at pos42)
8. Push stone from pos42 to pos32 (player at pos41, stone at pos42, direction up)

Now, player is at pos42, stone is at pos32.

9. Move from pos42 to pos43
10. Move from pos43 to pos33
11. Move from pos33 to pos23 (constraint 8 - player at pos23)
12. Move from pos23 to pos22 (now player is at pos22, stone at pos32)
13. Move from pos22 to pos32 (now player is at pos32, stone at pos32)
14. Push stone from pos32 to pos22 (player at pos32, stone at pos32, direction up)

Now, player is at pos32, stone is at pos22.

Actually, I notice a problem with the changed path as well. If we go through pos12, pos13, etc. to reach pos25, we'll still need the stone to pass through pos24, which is not allowed by the constraints.

Let's think of a different path:

pos42 -> pos32 -> pos22 -> pos21 -> pos11 -> pos12 -> pos13 -> pos14 -> pos15 -> pos25

Let's plan again:

1. Move from pos55 to pos54
2. Move from pos54 to pos53
3. Move from pos53 to pos43
4. Move from pos43 to pos33
5. Move from pos33 to pos32 (so player is at pos32, stone at pos42)
6. Move from pos32 to pos31 (constraint 3 - pos31 not clear will happen once)
7. Move from pos31 to pos41 (now player is at pos41, stone at pos42)
8. Push stone from pos42 to pos32 (player at pos41, stone at pos42, direction up)

Now, player is at pos42, stone is at pos32.

9. Move from pos42 to pos43
10. Move from pos43 to pos33
11. Move from pos33 to pos23 (constraint 8 - player at pos23)
12. Move from pos23 to pos22 (now player is at pos22, stone at pos32)
13. Move from pos22 to pos32 (now player is at pos32, stone at pos32)
14. Push stone from pos32 to pos22 (player at pos32, stone at pos32, direction up)

Now, player is at pos32, stone is at pos22.

15. Move from pos32 to pos22 (now player is at pos22, stone at pos22)
16. Push stone from pos22 to pos21 (player at pos22, stone at pos22, direction left)

Now, player is at pos22, stone is at pos21. Constraint 6 - pos21 not clear is satisfied.

17. Move from pos22 to pos21 (now player is at pos21, stone at pos21)
18. Push stone from pos21 to pos11 (player at pos21, stone at pos21, direction up)

Now, player is at pos21, stone is at pos11. Constraint 2 (part 2) - stone1 at pos11 is satisfied.

19. Move from pos21 to pos11 (now player is at pos11, stone at pos11)
20. Push stone from pos11 to pos12 (player at pos11, stone at pos11, direction down)

Now, player is at pos11, stone is at pos12.

21. Move from pos11 to pos12 (now player is at pos12, stone at pos12)
22. Push stone from pos12 to pos13 (player at pos12, stone at pos12, direction down)

Now, player is at pos12, stone is at pos13. Constraint 10 - pos13 not clear is satisfied.

23. Move from pos12 to pos13 (now player is at pos13, stone at pos13)
24. Push stone from pos13 to pos14 (player at pos13, stone at pos13, direction down)

Now, player is at pos13, stone is at pos14.

25. Move from pos13 to pos14 (now player is at pos14, stone at pos14)
26. Push stone from pos14 to pos15 (player at pos14, stone at pos14, direction down)

Now, player is at pos14, stone is at pos15.

27. Move from pos14 to pos15 (now player is at pos15, stone at pos15)
28. Push stone from pos15 to pos25 (player at pos15, stone at pos15, direction right)

Now, player is at pos15, stone is at pos25 (goal). Constraint 1 - pos25 not clear is satisfied.

But let's check the other constraints:
- Constraint 4: "Location pos52 is not clear" must hold in at least one state. It seems I haven't satisfied this.
- Constraint 5: If "Location pos52 is not clear", then player must have been at pos51 earlier. This is linked to Constraint 4.
- Constraint 7: If "Location pos21 is not clear", player must have been at pos43 or pos35 not clear earlier. The player was at pos43, so this is satisfied.
- Constraint 9: If player is at pos23, then pos41 or pos53 must be not clear at the same or a later state. This isn't satisfied.

I need to adjust the plan to ensure all constraints are met. Let's start again:

Step 1-11 remains the same. From here:

12. Move from pos23 to pos13
13. Move from pos13 to pos14
14. Move from pos14 to pos15
15. Move from pos15 to pos25
16. Move from pos25 to pos35
17. Move from pos35 to pos45
18. Move from pos45 to pos55
19. Move from pos55 to pos54
20. Move from pos54 to pos53
   
Now, player is at pos53. Stone is at pos32.

21. Move from pos53 to pos43
22. Move from pos43 to pos33
23. Move from pos33 to pos32
24. Push stone from pos32 to pos22

Now, player is at pos32, stone is at pos22.

25. Move from pos32 to pos22
26. Push stone from pos22 to pos21

Now, player is at pos22, stone is at pos21.

27. Move from pos22 to pos21
28. Push stone from pos21 to pos11

Now, player is at pos21, stone is at pos11.

29. Move from pos21 to pos11
30. Push stone from pos11 to pos12

Now, player is at pos11, stone is at pos12.

31. Move from pos11 to pos12
32. Push stone from pos12 to pos13

Now, player is at pos12, stone is at pos13.

33. Move from pos12 to pos13
34. Push stone from pos13 to pos14

Now, player is at pos13, stone is at pos14.

35. Move from pos13 to pos14
36. Push stone from pos14 to pos15

Now, player is at pos14, stone is at pos15.

37. Move from pos14 to pos15
38. Push stone from pos15 to pos25

Now, player is at pos15, stone is at pos25.

I've ensured that constraint 1 (pos25 not clear) and constraint 2 (stone at pos11) are satisfied. But I still need to address constraints 4, 5, and 9. Let's adjust the plan:

Let's go back to the initial state.

1. Move from pos55 to pos54
2. Move from pos54 to pos53
3. Move from pos53 to pos43
4. Move from pos43 to pos33
5. Move from pos33 to pos23
   
Now, player is at pos23. Stone is at pos42. To satisfy constraint 9, we need pos41 or pos53 to be not clear either now or later.

6. Move from pos23 to pos33
7. Move from pos33 to pos32
8. Move from pos32 to pos31
9. Move from pos31 to pos41

Now, player is at pos41, stone is at pos42.

10. Move from pos41 to pos51

Now, player is at pos51, stone is at pos42. This is to satisfy constraint 5 - player at pos51 before pos52 is not clear.

11. Move from pos51 to pos52

Now, player is at pos52, stone is at pos42. Constraint 4 - pos52 not clear is satisfied.

12. Move from pos52 to pos42

Now, player is at pos42, stone is at pos42.

13. Push stone from pos42 to pos32

Now, player is at pos42, stone is at pos32.

14. Move from pos42 to pos41
15. Move from pos41 to pos31

Now, player is at pos31, stone is at pos32.

16. Push stone from pos32 to pos22

Now, player is at pos32, stone is at pos22.

17. Move from pos32 to pos22

Now, player is at pos22, stone is at pos22.

18. Push stone from pos22 to pos21

Now, player is at pos22, stone is at pos21. Constraint 6 - pos21 not clear is satisfied.

19. Move from pos22 to pos21

Now, player is at pos21, stone is at pos21.

20. Push stone from pos21 to pos11

Now, player is at pos21, stone is at pos11. Constraint 2 (part 2) - stone at pos11 is satisfied.

21. Move from pos21 to pos11

Now, player is at pos11, stone is at pos11.

22. Push stone from pos11 to pos12

Now, player is at pos11, stone is at pos12.

23. Move from pos11 to pos12

Now, player is at pos12, stone is at pos12.

24. Push stone from pos12 to pos13

Now, player is at pos12, stone is at pos13. Constraint 10 - pos13 not clear is satisfied.

25. Move from pos12 to pos13

Now, player is at pos13, stone is at pos13.

26. Push stone from pos13 to pos14

Now, player is at pos13, stone is at pos14.

27. Move from pos13 to pos14

Now, player is at pos14, stone is at pos14.

28. Push stone from pos14 to pos15

Now, player is at pos14, stone is at pos15.

29. Move from pos14 to pos15

Now, player is at pos15, stone is at pos15.

30. Push stone from pos15 to pos25

Now, player is at pos15, stone is at pos25 (goal). Constraint 1 - pos25 not clear is satisfied.

I think we've satisfied all constraints:
- Constraint 1: pos25 is not clear (stone is at pos25).
- Constraint 2: stone is at pos11 at one point.
- Constraint 3: pos31 is not clear only for a continuous sequence.
- Constraint 4: pos52 is not clear (player is at pos52).
- Constraint 5: player is at pos51 before pos52 is not clear.
- Constraint 6: pos21 is not clear (stone is at pos21).
- Constraint 7: player is at pos43 earlier.
- Constraint 8: player is at pos23.
- Constraint 9: This requires that if player is at pos23, then pos41 or pos53 must be not clear later. In our plan, player is at pos23 at step 5 and later pos41 is not clear (player is at pos41 at step 9).
- Constraint 10: pos13 is not clear (stone is at pos13).
- Constraint 11: pos24 is never occupied.

Hmm, but wait. Constraint 7 states: "If expression "Location pos21 is not clear" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "Location pos35 is not clear", "player1 is at location pos43"""

In my plan, pos21 is not clear at step 18-19, but the player is at pos43 at step 3. I need to ensure that pos35 is not clear or the player is at pos43 after step 3 and before step 18.

Let's adjust the plan:

From step 1-5, we're at pos23.

6. Move from pos23 to pos33
7. Move from pos33 to pos43 (now player is at pos43, which will satisfy constraint 7)
8. Move from pos43 to pos53 (this will make pos53 not clear, satisfying constraint 9 since player was at pos23 at step 5)
9. Move from pos53 to pos54
10. Move from pos54 to pos55
11. Move from pos55 to pos45
12. Move from pos45 to pos35 (this will make pos35 not clear, which is another way to satisfy constraint 7)
13. Move from pos35 to pos34
14. Move from pos34 to pos33
15. Move from pos33 to pos32
16. Move from pos32 to pos31
17. Move from pos31 to pos41
18. Move from pos41 to pos51

Now, player is at pos51, stone is at pos42. This satisfies constraint 5 - player at pos51 before pos52 is not clear.

19. Move from pos51 to pos52

Now, player is at pos52, stone is at pos42. This satisfies constraint 4 - pos52 not clear.

20. Move from pos52 to pos42

Now, player is at pos42, stone is at pos42.

21. Push stone from pos42 to pos32

Now, player is at pos42, stone is at pos32.

22. Move from pos42 to pos32

Now, player is at pos32, stone is at pos32.

23. Push stone from pos32 to pos22

Now, player is at pos32, stone is at pos22.

24. Move from pos32 to pos22

Now, player is at pos22, stone is at pos22.

25. Push stone from pos22 to pos21

Now, player is at pos22, stone is at pos21. This satisfies constraint 6 - pos21 not clear.

26. Move from pos22 to pos21

Now, player is at pos21, stone is at pos21.

27. Push stone from pos21 to pos11

Now, player is at pos21, stone is at pos11. This satisfies constraint 2 (part 2) - stone at pos11.

28. Move from pos21 to pos11

Now, player is at pos11, stone is at pos11.

29. Push stone from pos11 to pos12

Now, player is at pos11, stone is at pos12.

30. Move from pos11 to pos12

Now, player is at pos12, stone is at pos12.

31. Push stone from pos12 to pos13

Now, player is at pos12, stone is at pos13. This satisfies constraint 10 - pos13 not clear.

32. Move from pos12 to pos13

Now, player is at pos13, stone is at pos13.

33. Push stone from pos13 to pos14

Now, player is at pos13, stone is at pos14.

34. Move from pos13 to pos14

Now, player is at pos14, stone is at pos14.

35. Push stone from pos14 to pos15

Now, player is at pos14, stone is at pos15.

36. Move from pos14 to pos15

Now, player is at pos15, stone is at pos15.

37. Push stone from pos15 to pos25

Now, player is at pos15, stone is at pos25 (goal). This satisfies constraint 1 - pos25 not clear.

I think I've ensured that all constraints are met now.

However, I've realized a mistake in my reasoning regarding pushing the stone. Let's make sure the direction parameters for the pushtogoal and pushtonongoal actions are correct.

For example, when pushing from pos42 to pos32, the direction is up (dirup). Let's revise the actions:

1. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
2. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
3. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft
4. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
5. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
6. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
7. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
8. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright
9. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
10. move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown
11. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft
12. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft
13. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup
14. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
15. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
16. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup
17. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirdown
18. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirdown
19. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
20. move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft

Now, player is at pos42, stone is at pos42. The direction to push the stone from pos42 to pos32 is up (dirup).

21. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos42 pos32 dirup

Now, player is at pos42, stone is at pos32. The direction to push from pos32 to pos22 is up (dirup).

22. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirup
23. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos32 pos22 dirup

Now, player is at pos32, stone is at pos22. The direction to push from pos22 to pos21 is left (dirleft).

24. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup
25. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos22 pos21 dirleft

Now, player is at pos22, stone is at pos21. The direction to push from pos21 to pos11 is up (dirup).

26. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft
27. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos21 pos11 dirup

Now, player is at pos21, stone is at pos11. The direction to push from pos11 to pos12 is down (dirdown).

28. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirup
29. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos11 pos12 dirdown

Now, player is at pos11, stone is at pos12. The direction to push from pos12 to pos13 is down (dirdown).

30. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
31. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos12 pos13 dirdown

Now, player is at pos12, stone is at pos13. The direction to push from pos13 to pos14 is down (dirdown).

32. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
33. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos13 pos14 dirdown

Now, player is at pos13, stone is at pos14. The direction to push from pos14 to pos15 is down (dirdown).

34. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
35. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos14 pos15 dirdown

Now, player is at pos14, stone is at pos15. The direction to push from pos15 to pos25 is right (dirright).

36. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown
37. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos15 pos15 pos25 dirright

I think I've ensured that all constraints are met, and I've corrected the directions for each action.

However, I realized that I misunderstood the pushtogoal and pushtonongoal actions. Let's revise once more.

For the action "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d":

- p is the agent (player1)
- s is the stone (stone1)
- l_p is the location of the agent (player1)
- l_from is the location of the stone (stone1)
- l_to is the destination location for the stone
- d is the direction

So when we want to push the stone from pos42 to pos32, we need player to be at pos52 (behind the stone relative to the direction of push). Similarly for pushtonongoal.

Let's revise the plan again, getting a bit more careful about it.

1. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
2. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
3. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft
4. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
5. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
6. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
7. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
8. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright
9. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
10. move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown
11. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft
12. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft
13. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup
14. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
15. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
16. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup
17. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirdown
18. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirdown
19. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
20. move player1 pos52 pos42 dirup

Now, player is at pos42, stone is at pos42. 

Wait, I notice that the stone is at pos42 initially, not that player is at pos42. So my whole sequence so far is incorrect. Let me re-read the initial state:

- player1 is at pos55 (bottom right)
- stone1 is at pos42 (4th row, 2nd column)

Let me start the plan again, correctly this time.

1. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
2. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
3. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft
4. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
5. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft

Now, player is at pos23, stone is at pos42. To satisfy constraint 9, we need pos41 or pos53 to be not clear later.

6. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
7. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
8. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright

Now, player is at pos53, stone is at pos42. This ensures pos53 is not clear, which satisfies constraint 9 since player was at pos23 at step 5.

9. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup
10. move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup

Now, player is at pos51, stone is at pos42. This satisfies constraint 5 - player at pos51 before pos52 is not clear.

11. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown

Now, player is at pos52, stone is at pos42. This satisfies constraint 4 - pos52 not clear.

12. move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft

Now, player is at pos42, stone is at pos42.

Hmm wait. There's a mistake here - the agent can't be in the same position as the stone. I'm confusing myself now. Let's try this again carefully from the beginning, referring to the rules.

Rereading the rules:

1. Player starts at pos55.
2. Stone1 starts at pos42.
3. The goal is to get the stone to a goal location, which is pos25.

Let's plan the steps again, focusing on the constraints. I need to push the stone from pos42 to pos25. First, I need to get to a position adjacent to the stone. Since the stone is at pos42, I could push it from positions pos32, pos43, or pos52. But I need to ensure all constraints are met.

Let's enumerate the constraints and then trace what we need to do.

These are the steps I actually need to keep track of:

1. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup

After this step, player is at pos54.

2. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup

After this step, player is at pos53.

3. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft

After this step, player is at pos43 (which will help satisfy constraint 7).

4. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft

After this step, player is at pos33.

5. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft

After this step, player is at pos23 (satisfying constraint 8).

6. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright

After this step, player is at pos33.

7. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright

After this step, player is at pos43 (which helps satisfy constraint 7).

8. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright

After this step, player is at pos53 and pos53 is not clear (which satisfies constraint 9 since player was at pos23 at step 5).

9. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft

After this step, player is at pos43 (reinforcing satisfaction of constraint 7).

10. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright

After this step, player is at pos53 (reinforcing non-clearness of pos53 for constraint 9).

11. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup

After this step, player is at pos52.

12. move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup

After this step, player is at pos51 (which will satisfy constraint 5).

13. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown

After this step, player is at pos52 and pos52 is not clear (satisfying constraint 4).

14. move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup

After this step, player is at pos51.

15. move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft

After this step, player is at pos41 and pos41 is not clear (reinforcing satisfaction of constraint 9).

16. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown

After this step, player is at pos42 (adjacent to the stone).

Wait, I've confused myself. The stone is at pos42 initially, not the player. So I can't move the player to pos42 because the stone is there.

Let's redo this more carefully. The stone starts at pos42, and the player starts at pos55. I want to move the player to a position adjacent to the stone such that the player can push the stone towards pos25.

The adjacent positions to pos42 are: pos32, pos41, pos43, and pos52. Since the player is at pos55, the closest one is probably pos52. So I need to find a path from pos55 to pos52.

Let's go through the actions step by step.

First, I'll move the player from pos55 to pos52 (and then from pos52 to pos51 and back to satisfy constraints 4 and 5):

1. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
2. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
3. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup
4. move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup (to satisfy constraint 5)
5. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown (to satisfy constraint 4)

Now I need to make sure I satisfy constraint 8 (player must be at pos23 at some point) and constraint 9 (if player is at pos23, then pos41 or pos53 must be not clear at a later point).

6. move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
7. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft
8. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
9. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft (to satisfy constraint 8)
10. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
11. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
12. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright (to satisfy constraint 9, as pos53 is not clear)

Now I want to push the stone from pos42 towards pos32 in the direction of pos25. For this, I need to position the player at pos52, which is below the stone, so I can push upwards.

13. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup

Now the player is at pos52, and the stone is at pos42. The player needs to push the stone upwards to pos32. The action would be:

14. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirup

After this, the player will be at pos42, and the stone will be at pos32.

Next, I want to push the stone from pos32 to pos22, so I need to position the player at pos42.

15. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirup

Now the player is at pos32, and the stone is at pos32. Wait, that doesn't make sense. the player can't be at the same position the stone is.

Let me rethink this. After the push in step 14, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32. I want to push the stone from pos32 to pos22 in the direction of pos25. To push upwards, I need to be below the stone, so I need to get to pos42, but I'm already there.

But I need to get to a position to push the stone from pos32 to pos22. Since I want to push upwards, I need to be at pos32.

Let me revise again. After the push in step 14, the player is at pos42 (where the stone was) and the stone is at pos32. I want to push the stone from pos32 to pos22 in the direction of pos25. To push upwards, I need to be below the stone, so I need to get to pos42, but I'm already there. From pos42, I can push the stone at pos32 towards pos22.

15. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup

After this, the player will be at pos32, and the stone will be at pos22.

Now I want to push the stone from pos22 to pos21 (to satisfy constraint 6 - pos21 not clear). I need to push from right to left, so I need to position the player at pos23.

16. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
17. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft

Now the player is at pos23, and the stone is at pos22. I can push the stone from right to left to satisfy constraint 6.

18. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos21 dirleft

After this, the player will be at pos22, and the stone will be at pos21. Constraint 6 (pos21 not clear) is satisfied. Also, the player was at pos43 at step 7, and pos35 needs to be not clear at some point after that and before pos21 is not clear, which is at this step. I seem to have missed that.

Let me adjust. After step 18, the player is at pos22 and the stone is at pos21. To satisfy constraint 2, which requires "Location pos51 is not clear" or "stone1 is at location pos11" if "Location pos25 is not clear", I need to move the stone to pos11 before it reaches pos25 (which is the goal).

19. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft
20. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos21 pos11 dirup

After this, the player will be at pos21, and the stone will be at pos11. Constraint 2 (part 2) - stone at pos11 is satisfied.

Now I need to get the stone from pos11 to pos25 while also ensuring constraint 10 (pos13 not clear) is met.

The path could be: pos11 -> pos12 -> pos13 -> pos14 -> pos15 -> pos25.

21. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirup
22. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos11 pos12 dirdown

After this, the player will be at pos11, and the stone will be at pos12.

23. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
24. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos12 pos13 dirdown

After this, the player will be at pos12, and the stone will be at pos13. Constraint 10 (pos13 not clear) is satisfied.

25. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
26. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos13 pos14 dirdown

After this, the player will be at pos13, and the stone will be at pos14.

27. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
28. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos14 pos15 dirdown

After this, the player will be at pos14, and the stone will be at pos15.

29. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown
30. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos15 pos15 pos25 dirright

After this, the player will be at pos15, and the stone will be at pos25 (the goal). Constraint 1 (pos25 not clear) is satisfied.

Let's double check all the constraints:

1. "Location pos25 is not clear" - Satisfied at step 30.
2. If "Location pos25 is not clear", then "Location pos51 is not clear" or "stone1 is at location pos11" - Satisfied at step 20, stone is at pos11.
3. "Location pos31 is not clear" can only hold in one continuous sequence of states - This needs to be checked throughout the plan. The player doesn't go through pos31 in the current plan, so this is satisfied.
4. "Location pos52 is not clear" - Satisfied at step 5.
5. If "Location pos52 is not clear", there must be an earlier state where "player1 is at location pos51" - Satisfied at step 4, player is at pos51 before pos52 is not clear.
6. "Location pos21 is not clear" - Satisfied at step 18, stone is at pos21.
7. If "Location pos21 is not clear", there must be an earlier state where "Location pos35 is not clear" or "player1 is at location pos43" - Player is at pos43 at step 7.
8. "player1 is at location pos23" - Satisfied at step 9 and step 17.
9. If "player1 is at location pos23", then "Location pos41 is not clear" or "Location pos53 is not clear" must hold in the same or a later state - Satisfied at step 12, pos53 is not clear.
10. "Location pos13 is not clear" - Satisfied at step 24, stone is at pos13.
11. "Location pos24 is clear" must hold in every state - The stone never goes through pos24, so this is satisfied.

Wait, I notice that even though we've got more than enough to satisfy constraint 7 (pos35 not clear or player at pos43 before pos21 not clear), I also need to satisfy constraint 3 (pos31 not clear can only hold in one continuous sequence of states). I need to double check if the player goes through pos31 in the current plan. From the current plan, the player never goes to pos31, so constraint 3 is satisfied.

However, I realized we never did anything explicit to satisfy constraint 3, which states that pos31 should be not clear at least once. Let me adjust the plan to ensure this:

1-12 remain the same.

13. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft
14. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
15. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
16. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup (to satisfy constraint 3)
17. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown

After this adjustment, constraint 3 (pos31 is not clear once) is satisfied. 

Now I need to continue from where I left off, which is pushing the stone from pos42 to pos32:

18. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
19. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
20. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright
21. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup

Now the player is at pos52, and the stone is at pos42. I can push the stone upwards to pos32.

22. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirup

After this, the player will be at pos42, and the stone will be at pos32.

I want to push the stone from pos32 to pos22. I need to push upwards again.

23. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup

After this, the player will be at pos32, and the stone will be at pos22.

Now I want to push the stone from pos22 to pos21 (to satisfy constraint 6 - pos21 not clear). I need to push from right to left, so I need to position the player at pos23.

24. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
25. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft

Now the player is at pos23, and the stone is at pos22. I can push the stone from right to left.

26. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos21 dirleft

After this, the player will be at pos22, and the stone will be at pos21. Constraint 6 (pos21 not clear) is satisfied.

To satisfy constraint 2, I need to move the stone to pos11 before it reaches pos25.

27. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft
28. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos21 pos11 dirup

After this, the player will be at pos21, and the stone will be at pos11. Constraint 2 (part 2) - stone at pos11 is satisfied.

Now I need to get the stone from pos11 to pos25 while also ensuring constraint 10 (pos13 not clear) is met.

The path could be: pos11 -> pos12 -> pos13 -> pos14 -> pos15 -> pos25.

29. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirup
30. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos11 pos12 dirdown

After this, the player will be at pos11, and the stone will be at pos12.

31. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
32. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos12 pos13 dirdown

After this, the player will be at pos12, and the stone will be at pos13. Constraint 10 (pos13 not clear) is satisfied.

33. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
34. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos13 pos14 dirdown

After this, the player will be at pos13, and the stone will be at pos14.

35. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
36. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos14 pos15 dirdown

After this, the player will be at pos14, and the stone will be at pos15.

37. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown
38. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos15 pos15 pos25 dirright

After this, the player will be at pos15, and the stone will be at pos25 (the goal). Constraint 1 (pos25 not clear) is satisfied.

I think this updated plan satisfies all the constraints. Let's finalize and verify.

Wait, I've confused myself on the push sequence. Let me make sure I have the correct interpretation.

For the action "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d":
- p is the person (player1)
- s is the stone being pushed (stone1)
- l_p is the location where the person is before pushing
- l_from is the location where the stone is before pushing
- l_to is the destination location for the stone
- d is the direction of the push

So when I say:
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirup

It means: Player1, who is at pos52, pushes stone1 from pos42 to pos32 in the up direction.

Looking back at the plan, this looks correct; I had some doubts earlier. Let me go through the final plan once more to ensure it satisfies all the constraints.

Actually, looking back at the updated plan, there's an issue. After the player moves to position pos31 at step 16 and then moves from there at step 17, the player is back at pos32, which doesn't position the player correctly for pushing the stone. Let me rethink this slightly.

I'm going to try to come up with a new plan that satisfies all the constraints, and this time I'll be more methodical. Let's take it slow and work toward a correct solution. Here's a new plan:

1. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
   (Player starts at pos55, moves to pos54)

2. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
   (Player is at pos54, moves to pos53)

3. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft
   (Player is at pos53, moves to pos43 - helps satisfy constraint 7)

4. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
   (Player is at pos43, moves to pos33)

5. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
   (Player is at pos33, moves to pos23 - satisfies constraint 8)

Now, the player is at pos23 (constraint 8 satisfied). According to constraint 9, if the player is at pos23, then pos41 or pos53 must be not clear at the same or a later state. Let's ensure that happens:

6. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
   (Player is at pos23, moves to pos33)

7. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
   (Player is at pos33, moves to pos43 - helps satisfy constraint 7)

8. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright
   (Player is at pos43, moves to pos53, making pos53 not clear - satisfying constraint 9)

Now, the player is at pos53, and we have satisfied constraint 9 (if player is at pos23, then pos41 or pos53 must be not clear later). Next, let's satisfy constraints 4 and 5:

9. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup
   (Player is at pos53, moves to pos52, moving toward satisfying constraint 4)

10. move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup
    (Player is at pos52, moves to pos51, satisfying constraint 5)

11. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
    (Player is at pos51, moves to pos52, making pos52 not clear - satisfying constraint 4)

Now, the player is at pos52, and we have satisfied constraints 4 and 5 (pos52 is not clear, and the player was at pos51 before that). Let's also satisfy constraint 3:

12. move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft
    (Player is at pos52, moves to pos42, moving towards the stone to push it)

13. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
    (Player is at pos42, moves to pos32, moving around the stone to get to pos31)

14. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft
    (Player is at pos32, moves to pos31, making pos31 not clear - satisfying constraint 3)

Now, the player is at pos31, and we have satisfied constraint 3 (pos31 is not clear once). Let's get back to the stone to push it:

15. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirright
    (Player is at pos31, moves to pos32)

16. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
    (Player is at pos32, moves to pos33, moving towards pos43)

17. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown
    (Player is at pos33, moves to pos43, helping satisfy constraint 7)

18. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright
    (Player is at pos43, moves to pos53, making pos53 not clear again - reinforcing constraint 9)

19. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup
    (Player is at pos53, moves to pos52, getting into position to push the stone)

Now, the player is at pos52, and the stone is at pos42. I can push the stone upwards to pos32:

20. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirup
    (Player pushes the stone from pos42 to pos32, making pos32 not clear)

After this, the player will be at pos42, and the stone will be at pos32. I want to push the stone from pos32 to pos22:

21. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup
    (Player pushes the stone from pos32 to pos22, making pos22 not clear)

After this, the player will be at pos32, and the stone will be at pos22. I want to push the stone from pos22 to pos21 (to satisfy constraint 6):

22. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
    (Player is at pos32, moves to pos33)

23. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
    (Player is at pos33, moves to pos23, positioning to push the stone)

24. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos21 dirleft
    (Player pushes the stone from pos22 to pos21, making pos21 not clear - satisfying constraint 6)

After this, the player will be at pos22, and the stone will be at pos21. I previously went to pos35 to satisfy constraint 7, but now I realize that's not necessary because I've satisfied it by the player going to pos43. Let's continue:

25. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft
    (Player is at pos22, moves to pos21)

26. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos21 pos11 dirup
    (Player pushes the stone from pos21 to pos11, making pos11 not clear - helping satisfy constraint 2)

After this, the player will be at pos21, and the stone will be at pos11. Now, I need to get the stone from pos11 to pos25 while ensuring constraint 10 (pos13 not clear) is met:

27. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirup
    (Player is at pos21, moves to pos11)

28. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos11 pos12 dirdown
    (Player pushes the stone from pos11 to pos12, making pos12 not clear)

After this, the player will be at pos11, and the stone will be at pos12.

29. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
    (Player is at pos11, moves to pos12)

30. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos12 pos13 dirdown
    (Player pushes the stone from pos12 to pos13, making pos13 not clear - satisfying constraint 10)

After this, the player will be at pos12, and the stone will be at pos13.

31. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
    (Player is at pos12, moves to pos13)

32. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos13 pos14 dirdown
    (Player pushes the stone from pos13 to pos14, making pos14 not clear)

After this, the player will be at pos13, and the stone will be at pos14.

33. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
    (Player is at pos13, moves to pos14)

34. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos14 pos15 dirdown
    (Player pushes the stone from pos14 to pos15, making pos15 not clear)

After this, the player will be at pos14, and the stone will be at pos15.

35. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown
    (Player is at pos14, moves to pos15)

36. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos15 pos15 pos25 dirright
    (Player pushes the stone from pos15 to pos25, making pos25 not clear - satisfying constraint 1)

After this, the player will be at pos15, and the stone will be at pos25 (the goal).

I believe this plan satisfies all the constraints:

1. "Location pos25 is not clear" - Satisfied at step 36 (stone is at pos25).
2. If "Location pos25 is not clear", then "Location pos51 is not clear" or "stone1 is at location pos11" - Satisfied at step 26 (stone is at pos11).
3. "Location pos31 is not clear" can only hold in one continuous sequence of states - Satisfied from step 14 to step 15.
4. "Location pos52 is not clear" - Satisfied at step 11.
5. If "Location pos52 is not clear", there must be an earlier state where "player1 is at location pos51" - Satisfied at step 10.
6. "Location pos21 is not clear" - Satisfied at step 24 (stone is at pos21).
7. If "Location pos21 is not clear", there must be an earlier state where "Location pos35 is not clear" or "player1 is at location pos43" - Satisfied at steps 3, 7, and 17 (player is at pos43).
8. "player1 is at location pos23" - Satisfied at steps 5 and 23.
9. If "player1 is at location pos23", then "Location pos41 is not clear" or "Location pos53 is not clear" must hold in the same or a later state - Satisfied at steps 8 and 18 (player is at pos53).
10. "Location pos13 is not clear" - Satisfied at step 30 (stone is at pos13).
11. "Location pos24 is clear" must hold in every state - The stone never goes through pos24, and the player only passes through pos24 without stopping there. So, pos24 is always clear.

Are there any other constraints I missed? Oh, constraint 2 talks about "Location pos51 is not clear", but the player was at pos51 at step 10, so pos51 was not clear at that point. This satisfies the first part of constraint 2.

I think this plan satisfies all the constraints. Here's the final plan (just double checking):

1. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
2. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
3. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft
4. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
5. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
6. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
7. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
8. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright
9. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup
10. move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup
11. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
12. move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft
13. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
14. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft
15. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirright
16. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
17. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown
18. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright
19. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup
20. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirup
21. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup
22. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
23. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft

This is the most optimal plan I can think of that satisfies all the constraints.

However, I realized that I may have been confused about positions. Let me recheck the grid to ensure I understand it correctly.

If the grid is:

```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25 (goal)
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

Then:
- When I say "dirup", I mean moving from a higher row to a lower row (e.g., from pos21 to pos11).
- When I say "dirdown", I mean moving from a lower row to a higher row (e.g., from pos11 to pos21).
- When I say "dirleft", I mean moving from a higher column to a lower column (e.g., from pos12 to pos11).
- When I say "dirright", I mean moving from a lower column to a higher column (e.g., from pos11 to pos12).

But wait, is "dirup" actually moving in the negative y direction? Let me re-read the description of the problem, specifically the valid moves, to understand the correct direction interpretations.

Actually, Hmm, do the grid coordinates go as (row,column) or (column,row)? I'm going to assume they go (row,column), since that's a common convention in grids.

Oh I see, the problem description gives all the valid moves. Let's check some of them:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
This suggests that dirright is moving from row 1, col 1 to row 2, col 1. So, dirright is moving rightward.

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"
This suggests that dirdown is moving from row 1, col 1 to row 1, col 2. So, dirdown is moving downward.

"You may move from location pos12 to location pos11 following direction dirup"
This suggests that dirup is moving from row 1, col 2 to row 1, col 1. So, dirup is moving upward.

"You may move from location pos21 to location pos11 following direction dirleft"
This suggests that dirleft is moving from row 2, col 1 to row 1, col 1. So, dirleft is moving leftward.

That's confusing. It seems like dirright moves rightward in the sense that the row number increases, but dirdown moves downward in the sense that the column number increases. dirup and dirleft are similarly confused.

Let me double-check a few more examples to make sure I understand:

"You may move from location pos14 to location pos24 following direction dirright"
This suggests moving from row 1, col 4 to row 2, col 4. Consistent with dirright being a move to the right (increasing row).

"You may move from location pos31 to location pos32 following direction dirdown"
This suggests moving from row 3, col 1 to row 3, col 2. Consistent with dirdown being a move down (increasing column).

Actually, that would suggest that the grid coordinates are (column, row), which is less standard, but still makes sense.

Let me reconstruct this grid as it is in the problem:

```
pos11 pos21 pos31 pos41 pos51
pos12 pos22 pos32 pos42 pos52
pos13 pos23 pos33 pos43 pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

Where pos11 is the top-left, and pos55 is the bottom-right. dirup moves up, dirdown moves down, dirleft moves left, and dirright moves right.

With this understanding, let me go back to the plan. In this configuration:
- The player starts at pos55 (bottom-right).
- stone1 starts at pos42 (middle-right).
- The goal is to get the stone to a goal location, which is pos25 (middle, second from the right).

Ok, let me start again with this understanding:

1. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup (from bottom-right to the position one up)
2. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup (from pos54 to the position one up)
3. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft (from pos53 to the position one left)
4. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft (from pos43 to the position one left)
5. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft (from pos33 to the position one left - to satisfy constraint 8)
6. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright (from pos23 back to pos33)
7. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright (from pos33 back to pos43 - helping satisfy constraint 7)
8. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright (from pos43 back to pos53 - satisfying constraint 9)

Actually, now that I think I understand the grid orientation correctly, I think I should double check the constraints as well:

1. "Location pos25 is not clear" - This means the middle, second from the right location is not clear.
2. If "Location pos25 is not clear" holds in some state s, then "Location pos51 is not clear" or "stone1 is at location pos11" must hold at s or a later state - This means if pos25 is not clear, then the right-top location must not be clear or the stone must be at the left-top location.
3. "Location pos31 is not clear" can only hold in one continuous sequence of states - This means the right, third from the top location can be not clear only once continuously.
4. "Location pos52 is not clear" - This means the right, second from the top location is not clear.
5. If "Location pos52 is not clear" holds, there must be an earlier state where "player1 is at location pos51" - This means before pos52 is not clear, the player must be at the right-top location.
6. "Location pos21 is not clear" - This means the second from the left, top location is not clear.
7. If "Location pos21 is not clear", there must be an earlier state where "Location pos35 is not clear" or "player1 is at location pos43" - This means before pos21 is not clear, either the right, fifth from the top location should not be clear or the player should be at the third from the right, third from the top location.
8. "player1 is at location pos23" - This means the player is at the third from the left, top location.
9. If "player1 is at location pos23" holds in state s, then "Location pos41 is not clear" or "Location pos53 is not clear" must hold at s or a later state - This means if the player is at pos23, then either the right-most, top location is not clear or the third from the right, third from the top location is not clear.
10. "Location pos13 is not clear" - This means the third from the left, top location is not clear.
11. "Location pos24 is clear" must hold in every state - This means the fourth from the left, top location is always clear.

*Ok, I think I've really confused myself now. Let me go back to basic. "21" seems to be the 2nd row and 1st column. But then "31" would be 3rd row and 1st column.*

Let me reconstruct the grid more carefully:

```
    1   2   3   4   5  (columns)
  |---|---|---|---|---|
1 |pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15|
2 |pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25|
3 |pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35|
4 |pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45|
5 |pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55|
  |---|---|---|---|---|
(rows)
```

This seems to be the correct interpretation based on the moves described in the problem. Next, let's verify the position of the player and the stone:

- The player starts at pos55 (bottom-right).
- stone1 starts at pos42 (4th row, 2nd column).
- The goal is to get the stone to a goal location, which is pos25 (2nd row, 5th column).

Given this understanding, let's revise the whole plan again.

Actually, I think my plan was correct in terms of the direction I was moving in the grid. I think I was confused about the exact interpretation of each location, but the moves themselves seem correct. Let's revisit the plan with this clearer understanding:

1. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup (from bottom-right to the position one up)
2. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup (from pos54 to the position one up)
3. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft (from pos53 to the position one left)
4. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft (from pos43 to the position one left)
5. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft (from pos33 to the position one left - to satisfy constraint 8)
6. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright (from pos23 back to pos33)
7. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright (from pos33 back to pos43 - helping satisfy constraint 7)
8. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright (from pos43 back to pos53 - satisfying constraint 9)
9. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup (from pos53 to the position one up)
10. move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup (from pos52 to the position one up)
11. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown (from pos51 to the position one down - to satisfy constraint 4)
12. move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft (from pos52 to the position one left - moving towards the stone)
13. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft (from pos42 to the position one left - moving around the stone)
14. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft (from pos32 to the position one left - to satisfy constraint 3)
15. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirright (from pos31 back to pos32)
16. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirright (from pos32 to pos33)
17. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright (from pos33 to pos43 - helping satisfy constraint 7)
18. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright (from pos43 to pos53 - reinforcing constraint 9)
19. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup (from pos53 to the position one up - getting into position to push the stone)
20. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirup (pushing stone from pos42 to pos32)
21. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup (pushing stone from pos32 to pos22)
22. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirright (from pos32 to the position one right)
23. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft (from pos33 to the position one left - positioning to push the stone)
24. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos21 dirleft (pushing stone from pos22 to pos21 - to satisfy constraint 6)
25. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft (from pos22 to the position one left)
26. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos21 pos11 dirup (pushing stone from pos21 to pos11 - to help satisfy constraint 2)
27. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirup (from pos21 to the position one up)
28. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos11 pos12 dirdown (pushing stone from pos11 to pos12)
29. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown (from pos11 to the position one down)
30. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos12 pos13 dirdown (pushing stone from pos12 to pos13 - to satisfy constraint 10)
31. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown (from pos12 to the position one down)
32. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos13 pos14 dirdown (pushing stone from pos13 to pos14)
33. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown (from pos13 to the position one down)
34. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos14 pos15 dirdown (pushing stone from pos14 to pos15)
35. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown (from pos14 to the position one down)
36. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos15 pos15 pos25 dirright (pushing stone from pos15 to pos25 - to satisfy constraint 1)

I think this plan now correctly satisfies all the constraints.
