Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. From the initial state, stone1 is at pos24, and the only goal location mentioned is pos41. Wait, looking back at the original state, pos41 is a goal location. So, we need to move stone1 to pos41.

But wait, there are a bunch of constraints. Let's list them out to make sure I don't miss any.

Constraints:
1. Player1 must be at pos54 in at least one state.
2. pos44 must not be clear in at least one state.
3. stone1 must be at pos23 in at least one state.
4. If stone1 is at pos23, then earlier there must be a state where either player1 is at pos54 or pos44 is not clear.
5. pos25 not clear can only be true in at most one continuous sequence of states.
6. pos22 must always be clear.
7. At least one state where stone1 is at pos34 and player1 is at pos54.
8. pos23 must be not clear in at least one state.
9. If pos23 is not clear, then there must be an earlier state where pos35 is not clear.

Wow, that's a lot. Let's start by figuring out the main path to move stone1 from pos24 to pos41. Since pos41 is the goal, maybe we need to push the stone through the grid towards pos41.

But the constraints complicate things. Let's see:

First, the stone has to be at pos23 at some point. So we need to push it there. But before that, either player1 is at pos54 or pos44 is not clear. Also, pos44 not clear must happen at some point. Then, we have to make sure that when pos23 is not clear (maybe when the stone is there?), there was an earlier state where pos35 was not clear. Also, pos22 must always be clear, so we can't have anything blocking there.

Also, the plan must have player1 at pos54 and stone1 at pos34 in the same state. And pos23 must be not clear (maybe when the stone is there). Also, the constraint on pos25 not clear being at most one continuous sequence. So, pos25 can't be occupied more than once in a row.

Let's start by trying to outline the steps:

Initial state: player1 at pos21, stone1 at pos24.

First, to move the stone, the player needs to get next to it. So player1 is at pos24's adjacent cell. Let's see the connections. From the movement rules, pos24 is connected to pos14 (left), pos34 (right), pos23 (up), pos25 (down). The player is at pos21. To get to pos24, the player can move from pos21 to pos22 (down), then to pos23 (down), then to pos24 (right? Wait, movement directions. Let's check the allowed moves.

Looking at the movement possibilities:

From pos21, possible moves are to pos11 (left), pos31 (right), or pos22 (down). So from pos21, the player can go down to pos22. Then from pos22, down to pos23, then from pos23, down to pos24? Wait, no. Looking at the allowed moves for pos23: "You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 (left), pos33 (right), pos22 (up), or pos24 (down)." So from pos23, moving down takes you to pos24. So if the player is at pos23, they can move down to pos24. But wait, the stone is at pos24. So to push the stone, the player needs to be adjacent to it.

Alternatively, the player could move right from pos21 to pos31, but that might not help. Let's think. Maybe the player needs to get to pos24's adjacent cell to push the stone.

Wait, the stone is at pos24. To push it, the player must be in a position adjacent to pos24 in a direction from which they can push. For example, if the player is at pos23 (which is above pos24), they could push the stone down to pos34. Or if the player is at pos14 (left of pos24), they could push it right to pos34. Or if the player is at pos34 (right of pos24), they could push it left to pos14. Or if the player is at pos25 (below pos24), push it up to pos23.

But the constraints say that stone1 must be at pos23 at some point. So perhaps pushing the stone from pos24 to pos23 first. To do that, the player needs to be at pos25 to push up, or pos24's other adjacent cells. Wait, pos24 is connected to pos14 (left), pos34 (right), pos23 (up), pos25 (down). Wait, no. The allowed moves from pos24: "You may move from location pos24 to pos14 (left), pos34 (right), pos23 (up), pos25 (down)." So to push the stone from pos24 to pos23, the player must be at pos24's up direction, which is pos23. Wait, no. Wait, the pushing action requires that the player is at location l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's current location) in the direction d. Then, when pushing, the stone moves from l_from to l_to in direction d. So for example, to push the stone from pos24 to pos23 (up), the player needs to be at pos24's up direction's adjacent cell. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the "pushtogoal" or "pushtonongoal" action's preconditions include that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's position) such that moving from l_p to l_from is possible in direction d. Then, from l_from, moving in direction d to l_to must be possible. So for example, if the player is at pos23, and the stone is at pos24, and the direction is down, then moving from l_p (pos23) to l_from (pos24) via direction down. Then the stone moves from pos24 (l_from) to pos25 (l_to) via direction down. But in that case, the stone would move down to pos25. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, if the player is at pos25 and wants to push the stone up to pos24, but the stone is already at pos24. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of directions. For the "pushtogoal" action, the agent is at l_p, which must be reachable from l_from via direction d. Wait, no. Precondition (iv) says you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d. So the direction is from l_p to l_from. Then, from l_from, moving in direction d to l_to must be possible. Wait, no. Precondition (v) says you can get from l_from to l_to following direction d. So the direction for moving the stone is the same as the direction from l_p to l_from. Wait, maybe not. Let me read the preconditions again.

For "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d":
- (iv) can move from l_p to l_from following direction d. So direction d is the direction from l_p to l_from. Then, (v) can move from l_from to l_to following direction d. So the same direction d. So the stone is pushed in the same direction from l_from. So for example, if the player is at pos23 and wants to push the stone at pos24 down, the direction d would be down. But moving from l_p (pos23) to l_from (pos24) in direction down would require that pos24 is down from pos23. Looking at the allowed moves, from pos23, moving down is to pos24. So direction d is dirdown. Then, moving from l_from (pos24) in direction dirdown would be to pos25. So pushing the stone from pos24 to pos25. But pos25 is not a goal. Alternatively, if the player is at pos34 (right of pos24), direction dirleft would be from pos34 to pos24. Then, the stone could be pushed left from pos24 to pos14. But pos14 is not a goal. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the player can push the stone from pos24 to pos34 (right) if the player is at pos34. Wait, but pos34 is to the right of pos24. So direction dirleft would be from pos34 to pos24. Then, pushing the stone from pos24 to pos34 (right). Because direction d would be dirleft (from l_p=pos34 to l_from=pos24), and then from l_from=pos24, moving in direction dirleft would be to pos14. Wait, no. Wait, the direction for moving from l_p to l_from is d. Then, the direction for moving from l_from to l_to is also d. So if the player is at pos34 and pushes the stone at pos24, direction dirleft (from pos34 to pos24), then the stone would move in dirleft direction from pos24 to pos14. But pos14 is not a goal. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, the player could push the stone from pos24 to pos34 (right), which would require the player to be at pos34's right, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe the player is at pos24's right, which is pos34. So direction dirleft (from pos34 to pos24). Then the stone is pushed from pos24 to pos34 (same direction dirleft? No, the direction for the stone's movement would be dirleft, which from pos24 would be to pos14. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the directions.

Wait, maybe the direction is the direction the agent moves to get to the stone. So if the agent is at pos23 and moves down to pos24 (the stone's location), but the stone is there. So to push the stone, the agent must be adjacent to the stone in the direction opposite to where they want to push. For example, to push the stone up, the agent must be below it. Wait, maybe that's the standard Sokoban-like movement. So if the agent is south of the stone (pos24), they can push it north. Or east, west, etc.

Wait, in Sokoban, the player can push a stone by moving into it from an adjacent cell, pushing it in the same direction. So if the player is south of the stone and moves north into the stone's cell, the stone moves north. But in this problem's actions, the "pushtogoal" and "pushtonongoal" actions require that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (stone's position) in direction d. Then, the stone is pushed from l_from to l_to in the same direction d. So direction d is the direction from the agent's position (l_p) to the stone's position (l_from). Then, the stone moves in that same direction from l_from to l_to. So for example, if the agent is at pos23 (north of pos24), direction d would be dirdown (from pos23 to pos24). Then, the stone is pushed from pos24 in direction dirdown to pos25. But that's moving the stone down. Alternatively, if the agent is at pos34 (east of pos24), direction dirleft (from pos34 to pos24), then the stone is pushed left from pos24 to pos14. But pos14 is not a goal.

Wait, the goal is pos41. So we need to get the stone to pos41. So perhaps the path is pos24 -> pos34 -> pos44 -> pos43 -> pos42 -> pos41? But pos44 is not a goal. Wait, no, pos41 is the only goal. So the stone needs to reach pos41.

But how to get there? Let's consider the possible paths. From pos24, possible pushes:

- To pos23 (up): requires the agent to be at pos24's south (pos25) and push up. But pos25 is clear initially. So the agent can move to pos25 and push the stone up to pos24? Wait, no. Wait, if the agent is at pos25 (south of pos24), direction dirup would be from pos25 to pos24. Then, pushing the stone from pos24 in dirup direction would be to pos23. So that's possible. So agent moves to pos25, then pushes the stone up to pos23. But pos23 is a non-goal, so we'd use pushtonongoal.

But according to the constraints, stone1 must be at pos23 at some point. So that's good. Then, after that, perhaps push it further. But pos23 is not a goal. So we need to move it from pos23 to pos41.

Alternatively, maybe pushing the stone east from pos24 to pos34. If the agent is at pos34, direction dirleft (west) to pos24, then pushing the stone west to pos14. No, that's not helpful. Alternatively, pushing east from pos24 to pos34. For that, the agent would need to be east of pos24 (pos34) and push west? Wait, no. To push east, the agent needs to be west of the stone. For example, agent at pos24's west (pos14), push east to pos24's east (pos34). So the agent would be at pos14, direction dirright (east) to pos24. Then pushing the stone from pos24 to pos34 (east). That would be possible if pos34 is clear. Let's check the initial state: pos34 is clear. So that's an option.

But the agent starts at pos21. To get to pos14, they need to move through pos22, pos23, pos24? Wait, but pos24 has the stone. Let's see. From pos21, the agent can move down to pos22, then down to pos23, then right to pos24? Wait, no. From pos23, moving right would be to pos33. Hmm, maybe a different path. Alternatively, the agent can go from pos21 to pos31 (right), then pos31 to pos41 (right), but pos41 is a goal. But the agent needs to push the stone. Maybe a longer path.

Alternatively, to get to pos14, the agent could go up from pos21 to pos11, then right to pos12, down to pos22, etc. This is getting complicated. Let's try to map out the grid.

The grid is 5x5, with rows 1 to 5 and columns 1 to 5. So pos11 is row 1, column 1; pos12 is row 1, column 2; pos21 is row 2, column 1, etc.

The initial positions:

- player1 at pos21 (2,1)
- stone1 at pos24 (2,4)

Goal locations: only pos41 (4,1) is a goal.

Constraints:

- stone1 must be at pos23 (2,3) at some point.
- When stone1 is at pos23, earlier state must have player1 at pos54 or pos44 not clear.
- Player1 must be at pos54 (5,4) at least once.
- pos44 (4,4) must be not clear at least once.
- pos23 must be not clear (so when stone is there, that's covered).
- pos35 (3,5) must be not clear before pos23 is not clear.
- Also, a state where stone1 is at pos34 (3,4) and player1 is at pos54 (5,4).

This is a lot. Let's try to find a path that satisfies all constraints.

First, moving the stone from pos24 to pos23. To do that, the agent needs to be south of pos24 (pos25) and push up. But pos25 is initially clear. So the agent can move to pos25, then push the stone up to pos23.

Wait, but how? Let's think step by step.

Initial position: agent at pos21, stone at pos24.

First, the agent needs to get to pos25 to push the stone up to pos23.

Path from pos21 to pos25:

pos21 → pos22 (down), then pos22 → pos23 (down), then pos23 → pos24 (right?) Wait, no. From pos23, moving right is to pos33. Wait, the allowed moves:

From pos23, you can move to pos13 (left), pos33 (right), pos22 (up), or pos24 (down). Wait, but pos24 is where the stone is. So the agent can't move into pos24 because it's occupied by the stone. So the agent can't directly move from pos23 to pos24.

So to reach pos25, maybe another path. From pos21, move down to pos22, then down to pos23, then down to pos24? No, because pos24 has the stone. So that's blocked. Alternatively, from pos22, the agent can move right to pos32, then down to pos33, etc. Wait, maybe a longer path.

Alternatively, from pos21, move right to pos31 (since from pos21, you can move right to pos31). Then from pos31, right to pos41 (goal location). But then, to get to pos25, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, from pos21, move down to pos22, then right to pos32. From pos32, down to pos33, then right to pos34. From pos34, down to pos44. But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, think of moving the stone first. Let's consider pushing the stone from pos24 to pos23. To do that, the agent needs to be at pos25 (south of pos24) and push up. So first, the agent must move to pos25.

How to get to pos25 from pos21:

pos21 → pos22 (down), pos22 → pos23 (down), pos23 → pos24 (down? Wait, pos23's down direction is pos24. But pos24 is occupied by the stone. So agent can't move there. So that's not possible. So how else can the agent get to pos25?

Looking at allowed moves from pos25:

pos25 can be reached from pos15 (left), pos35 (right), pos24 (up), or pos25's down? Wait, the allowed moves are:

From pos24, you can move down to pos25. But pos24 is occupied by the stone. So the agent can't go there. Alternatively, from pos15, you can move right to pos25, but the agent is at pos21.

This seems challenging. Maybe the agent needs to take a different route. For example, pos21 → pos31 (right), then pos31 → pos32 (down), pos32 → pos33 (down), pos33 → pos34 (down), pos34 → pos35 (down), pos35 → pos25 (left). That's a long path. Then, from pos25, the agent can push the stone up to pos23.

But pos25 must be clear. Initially, pos25 is clear, so the agent can move there. Let's check:

Initial locations clear: pos25 is clear. So agent can move to pos25 if possible.

Wait, the agent's path from pos21 to pos25:

pos21 → pos22 (down), pos22 → pos23 (down), pos23 → pos24 (down) is blocked by the stone. So alternative path: pos21 → pos31 (right), pos31 → pos32 (down), pos32 → pos33 (down), pos33 → pos34 (down), pos34 → pos35 (down), pos35 → pos25 (left). Yes, this path is possible. So the agent can go from pos21 to pos31, then down to pos32, pos33, pos34, pos35, then left to pos25.

Once at pos25, the agent can perform a pushtonongoal action to push the stone from pos24 to pos23 (up direction). So action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos24 pos23 dirdown. Wait, no. Because the direction d is the direction from l_p (pos25) to l_from (pos24), which is dirup. Because moving from pos25 to pos24 is dirup. Then, the stone is pushed from pos24 in direction dirup to pos23. So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos24 pos23 dirup.

But wait, the direction must be such that you can move from l_p to l_from following d. So pos25 to pos24 is up (since pos24 is north of pos25). So direction is dirup. Then, from pos24, moving dirup would be to pos23. So yes, that works.

So after moving to pos25, the agent can push the stone to pos23.

Now, this satisfies the constraint that stone1 is at pos23. But according to constraint 4, before that, there must be a state where either player1 is at pos54 or pos44 is not clear. So pushing to pos23 requires that earlier in the plan, one of those is true.

But in this path, when the agent is at pos25 and pushes to pos23, the earlier states are the agent moving from pos21 to pos31, pos32, etc. None of those involve pos54 or pos44. So this would violate constraint 4.

So this approach won't work. Therefore, we need to find a way to first satisfy the condition for constraint 4 before pushing the stone to pos23.

Hmm. So before stone1 is at pos23, the agent must have been at pos54 or pos44 was not clear.

So perhaps the agent needs to visit pos54 before pushing the stone to pos23. Or make pos44 occupied (not clear) before that.

But how? pos44 is initially clear. To make pos44 not clear, the agent or a stone must be there. But the only stone is stone1, which is at pos24. So the stone would have to be moved to pos44. But pos44 is not a goal, so that would require a pushtonongoal action. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, the agent can move to pos54, which would make pos54 not clear. But how?

The agent's path to pos54:

From pos21, moving right to pos31, then right to pos41, then right to pos51, then down to pos52, down to pos53, down to pos54. That's possible. So agent moves to pos54, satisfying the constraint that they are there at least once. Then, after that, the agent can proceed to move back to push the stone.

But that would be a long path. However, maybe necessary for the constraints.

So let's outline steps:

1. Move agent from pos21 to pos54.

This requires a series of move actions. Let's see:

pos21 → pos31 (right), pos31 → pos41 (right), pos41 → pos51 (right), pos51 → pos52 (down), pos52 → pos53 (down), pos53 → pos54 (down). So that's six move actions.

But during this movement, the agent must ensure that pos22 remains clear. Since pos22 is initially clear, and the agent is moving through other paths, pos22 stays clear.

Once the agent is at pos54, this satisfies the first constraint (player1 at pos54). Now, after that, the agent needs to move back towards the stone. But this seems time-consuming. But perhaps necessary.

But after reaching pos54, the agent can then move to other locations to push the stone. But the stone is still at pos24.

Alternatively, maybe after moving to pos54, the agent can then push the stone to pos23, since now the constraint 4 is satisfied (player1 was at pos54 earlier). So the plan would be:

- Move agent to pos54 (satisfies constraint 1 and part of constraint 4).
- Then, move back to pos25 to push stone from pos24 to pos23.

But moving back from pos54 to pos25 would take many steps. Let's see:

From pos54, the agent can move up to pos53, then up to pos52, then up to pos51, then left to pos41, then left to pos31, then down to pos32, then down to pos33, then down to pos34, then down to pos35, then left to pos25. That's a lot of steps. But possible.

Once at pos25, perform pushtonongoal to push stone1 from pos24 to pos23. Now, since in an earlier state (when agent was at pos54), the condition for constraint 4 is satisfied.

Then, the stone is at pos23. Now, we need to move it to pos41. But how?

From pos23, the possible pushes:

- To pos13 (left), pos33 (right), pos22 (up), pos24 (down). But pos41 is the goal. So need to find a path to pos41.

But pos41 is at (4,1). So the agent needs to push the stone from pos23 to pos33 (right), then to pos43 (right), then to pos42 (left?), etc. But pos42 is not a goal. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps push the stone east to pos33, then to pos43, then to pos44, then to pos43 again, etc. But pos44 is not a goal. Wait, the only goal is pos41.

Alternatively, after pos23, push the stone down to pos24 again, but that's backtracking.

Alternatively, push the stone from pos23 to pos24 (down), but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, push the stone from pos23 to pos33 (right). To do that, the agent needs to be west of pos23 (pos13), but pos13 is clear. Or east of pos33 (pos43?), but that's getting complicated.

Wait, to push the stone from pos23 to pos33 (right), the agent must be at pos23's west (pos13) and push east. But pos13 is clear. So agent can move to pos13, then push east to pos23, then east to pos33. But how to get the agent to pos13 from pos25 after pushing to pos23.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos23, the agent is at pos24 (since after pushing, the agent moves to l_from, which is pos24? Wait, no. Let's look at the effects of pushtonongoal:

After pushtonongoal, the agent is at l_from (pos24 in this case?), but wait, the action is "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d". The effects are:

(i) agent p is no longer at l_p (pos25 in this case)

(ii) stone s is no longer at l_from (pos24)

(iii) l_to (pos23) is no longer clear

(iv) agent p is at l_from (pos24)

So after pushing, the agent moves from pos25 to pos24, and the stone moves from pos24 to pos23.

So after this action, the agent is at pos24, and the stone is at pos23.

Now, pos24 is clear (since the stone moved to pos23 and the agent is at pos24). But pos23 is now occupied by the stone.

Now, the agent needs to push the stone further. From pos23, the agent could push it to pos33 (east). To do that, the agent needs to be west of pos23 (pos13) and push east. But the agent is at pos24. So they need to move to pos13.

But how? From pos24, the agent can move up to pos23 (but pos23 has the stone), down to pos25 (clear), left to pos14 (clear), or right to pos34 (clear). So the agent can move from pos24 to pos34 (right), then to pos44 (right), etc. Or move left to pos14.

Alternatively, the agent can move from pos24 to pos14 (left), then up to pos13, then right to pos23 (but the stone is there). Hmm.

This is getting complicated. Let's think of another approach.

Another constraint is that in some state, stone1 is at pos34 and player1 is at pos54. So we need to have the stone at pos34 and player at pos54 at the same time.

Also, the agent must be at pos54 in some state. So maybe after moving to pos54, the agent can push the stone to pos34 somehow.

But how? The stone is at pos24 initially.

Wait, another possible path: the agent moves to pos54, then returns to the stone's area, pushes the stone to pos34, then moves back to pos54 while the stone is at pos34. But how?

Alternatively, the agent moves to pos54, then pushes the stone from pos34 to pos44 (but that's not a goal). But how does the stone get to pos34 in the first place?

Alternatively, the agent pushes the stone to pos34 earlier. For example, from pos24 to pos34 (east). To do that, the agent needs to be west of pos24 (pos14) and push east. But how to get to pos14?

From pos21, the agent can move up to pos11, then right to pos12, down to pos22, right to pos23, down to pos24 (but stone is there). Wait, no. Alternatively, from pos21 to pos11 (left), then pos11 to pos12 (down), pos12 to pos13 (down), pos13 to pos14 (down). Then, from pos14, push the stone east to pos24. But that's the initial position. Hmm.

Alternatively, the agent moves to pos14, then pushes the stone east to pos24. But that's the initial state, so not helpful.

Alternatively, push the stone from pos24 to pos34 (east). To do that, the agent needs to be at pos24's west (pos14) and push east. So the agent must move to pos14.

Path to pos14 from pos21:

pos21 → pos11 (left), pos11 → pos12 (down), pos12 → pos13 (down), pos13 → pos14 (down). Then, from pos14, push east to pos24. But the stone is already at pos24, so pushing further east would require the agent to be at pos24's east (pos34) and push west. But that's not possible since pos34 is clear.

Wait, no. To push east from pos24, the agent must be west of pos24 (pos14), direction dirright (east) to pos24, then the stone moves east to pos34.

So action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright.

But for this, the agent must be at pos14 (l_p), stone at pos24 (l_from), pos34 (l_to) is clear. Then, can move from pos14 to pos24 via dirright (east), and from pos24 to pos34 via dirright (east). pos34 must be clear, which it is initially.

So after pushing, stone1 is at pos34, agent is at pos24.

Then, to satisfy the constraint that stone1 is at pos34 and player1 is at pos54, the agent needs to move to pos54 while the stone is at pos34.

So after pushing to pos34, the agent can move from pos24 to pos34 (right), then to pos44 (right), then to pos54 (down). But pos44 is initially clear. So:

pos24 → pos34 (right), then pos34 → pos44 (right), pos44 → pos54 (down).

So after these moves, the agent is at pos54, and stone1 is at pos34. This satisfies the constraint.

But this requires that the agent first pushes the stone to pos34, then moves to pos54. But this would also satisfy the constraint that player1 is at pos54. Also, during this movement, pos44 would be occupied by the agent when moving from pos34 to pos44, making pos44 not clear, satisfying another constraint.

Wait, pos44 is not clear when the agent is there. So when the agent moves from pos34 to pos44, pos44 becomes not clear. Then, when moving from pos44 to pos54, pos44 becomes clear again. So the state where pos44 is not clear is when the agent is at pos44. But the constraint requires that pos44 is not clear in at least one state. So that's satisfied.

Additionally, the constraint that if stone1 is at pos23, then there must be an earlier state where player1 is at pos54 or pos44 not clear. If we push the stone to pos23 after this, then the earlier state where pos44 was not clear (when agent was at pos44) would satisfy this.

So let's outline this approach:

1. Move agent from pos21 to pos14 to push stone1 to pos34.

But wait, how does the agent get to pos14? The path from pos21 to pos14 is:

pos21 → pos11 (left), then pos11 → pos12 (down), pos12 → pos13 (down), pos13 → pos14 (down). Then, perform the push.

But pos11 is clear. Let's check the initial state: pos11 is clear. Yes.

So steps:

Action: move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft

Action: move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown

Action: move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown

Action: move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown

Then, push the stone from pos24 to pos34:

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright

After this, stone1 is at pos34, agent is at pos24.

Then, agent moves to pos34 (right), then to pos44 (right), then to pos54 (down):

Action: move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright

Action: move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

Action: move player1 pos44 pos54 dirdown

Now, agent is at pos54, stone1 is at pos34. This satisfies the constraint where both are true in the same state.

Additionally, pos44 was not clear when the agent was there (during the move from pos34 to pos44 to pos54). So pos44 was not clear in the state after moving to pos44.

Now, we need to push the stone from pos34 to pos44. But pos44 is a non-goal location, so we can use pushtonongoal. But pos44 must be clear. After the agent moves to pos54, pos44 is clear again. So agent can push the stone from pos34 to pos44.

But how? The agent is at pos54. To push the stone at pos34 to pos44, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos34 in a direction that allows pushing. For example, agent at pos44 (east of pos34) and push west to pos44. Wait, pos34 to pos44 is east. So to push east, the agent must be west of pos34 (pos24) and push east. But the agent is at pos54.

This is getting complicated. Let's think of the next steps.

After the agent is at pos54, stone1 is at pos34. The goal is to get the stone to pos41. So the stone needs to move from pos34 to pos44, then to pos43, pos42, pos41. But pos44 is not a goal, so that's okay. However, pos41 is the goal.

So to push the stone from pos34 to pos44:

Agent needs to be west of pos34 (pos24) and push east. But agent is at pos54. To get to pos24, agent would need to move up from pos54 to pos53, up to pos52, up to pos51, left to pos41, left to pos31, down to pos32, down to pos33, down to pos34, then left to pos24. That's a long path.

Once at pos24, agent can push the stone east to pos34 again? Not helpful. Alternatively, from pos34, push east to pos44.

But how to get the agent to pos34's west (pos24) to push east. So agent needs to move from pos54 back to pos24.

Alternatively, after the agent is at pos54, they can move to pos44 (up), then to pos34 (left), then to pos24 (left), etc. But pos44 is clear now.

Wait, after the agent moves to pos54, pos44 is clear again. So agent can move back to pos44, then to pos34, etc.

But this seems time-consuming. Let's try to see:

From pos54, move up to pos44 (no, pos54's up is pos53. pos54 is (5,4). To get to pos44 (4,4), the agent needs to move left? Wait, movement directions are based on the grid.

Wait, the allowed moves from pos54 are:

"You may move from location pos54 to pos44 (left), pos53 (up), pos55 (down) following direction dirleft, dirup, dirdown."

Wait, no. Looking back at the movement rules:

From pos54: "You may move from location pos54 to pos44 (left), pos53 (up), pos55 (dirdown)."

So direction dirleft from pos54 to pos44. So the agent can move from pos54 to pos44 via dirleft.

Then, from pos44, they can move left to pos34 (dirleft), then to pos24, etc.

So steps from pos54:

Action: move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft

Then, pos44 to pos34 dirleft.

Action: move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft

Then, pos34 to pos24 dirleft.

Action: move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft

Now, agent is at pos24. The stone is at pos34. To push the stone east to pos44, the agent must be west of pos34 (pos24) and push east.

So action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright

Preconditions: agent at pos24, stone at pos34, pos44 clear. After pushing, stone moves to pos44, agent moves to pos34.

Now, stone is at pos44. Then, agent can push it further east to pos54? No, pos54 is not a goal. But we need to get to pos41.

Alternatively, push the stone from pos44 to pos43 (west), but that's not helpful. Or to pos54 (south), but pos54 is a non-goal.

Alternatively, push the stone from pos44 to pos43 (west), then to pos42 (west), then to pos41 (west). But pos41 is the goal.

So after pushing stone to pos44, the agent is at pos34. Then, agent moves to pos44 (east), then pushes the stone west to pos43.

Action: move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

Then, pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos44 pos43 dirleft? Wait, no. The stone is at pos44. To push west to pos43, the agent must be east of pos44 (pos54) and push west. But pos54 is clear. So agent needs to move to pos54, then push west.

But pos54 is clear. So:

Agent moves from pos34 to pos44 (dirright), then to pos54 (dirright?), wait, no. From pos44, moving right (dirright) would be to pos54? No, pos44 is (4,4). Moving right (east) would be to pos45. But pos45 is (4,5). To get to pos54 (5,4), the agent needs to move down from pos44 to pos54, but according to movement rules, from pos44 you can move to pos34 (left), pos54 (right?), no. Let me check:

Looking back at the movement rules:

From pos44: "You may move from location pos44 to pos34 (left), pos54 (right), pos43 (up), pos45 (down)."

Wait, no. The movement rules say:

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown"

So to move to pos54 from pos44, direction is dirright (east). So pos44 to pos54 is east.

So agent can move from pos44 to pos54 via dirright. Then, from pos54, push the stone west to pos44. But the stone is already at pos44. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, agent can move from pos44 to pos43 (up), then to pos42 (up), then to pos41 (left). But pos41 is the goal.

Alternatively, agent needs to push the stone from pos44 to pos43 (west), which requires the agent to be east of pos44 (pos54) and push west. So agent moves to pos54, then performs pushtonongoal to push stone from pos44 to pos43.

But pos44 is a non-goal location, so using pushtonongoal.

Preconditions for pushtonongoal:

- Agent at pos54 (l_p), stone at pos44 (l_from), pos43 (l_to) is clear.

Check if pos43 is clear initially. Yes, pos43 is clear.

Direction: from pos54 to pos44 is dirleft (west). Then, from pos44 to pos43 is dirleft (west). So action:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos43 dirleft

After this, stone is at pos43, agent is at pos44.

Then, push from pos43 to pos42 (west), agent at pos44 (east of pos43) and push west.

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirleft

Then, push from pos42 to pos41 (west), agent at pos42 (east of pos41) and push west.

But wait, pos41 is the goal. So once the stone is at pos41, we use pushtogoal.

Wait, pos41 is a goal location. So when pushing the stone to pos41, we use pushtogoal action.

So steps:

After stone is at pos42:

Agent at pos42 (from previous push), push stone to pos41.

Action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos42 pos41 dirleft

Wait, no. The agent is at pos42, stone is at pos42? No, stone is at pos42 after being pushed from pos43. So to push from pos42 to pos41, the agent must be east of pos42 (pos43) and push west. So agent moves to pos43, then pushes west to pos42.

Wait, no. Let me clarify:

If the stone is at pos42, to push it west to pos41, the agent must be at pos43 (east of pos42) and push west. So:

Agent moves from pos42 to pos43 (right), then performs pushtogoal action:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirleft

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos43 (l_p)

- stone at pos42 (l_from)

- pos41 (l_to) is clear and is a goal.

- Direction from l_p (pos43) to l_from (pos42) is dirleft (west). Then, from l_from (pos42) to l_to (pos41) is also dirleft (west).

pos41 is a goal location, so this action is valid.

After this, stone is at pos41 (goal), and agent is at pos42.

This completes the task.

Now, let's check all constraints:

1. Player1 must be at pos54: achieved when agent moved there.

2. pos44 not clear: achieved when agent was at pos44 during movement.

3. stone1 at pos23: not yet addressed. Oops, we didn't do this. So our current plan doesn't satisfy this.

Oh right, the stone must be at pos23 at some point. So our current approach skips that. So this plan is invalid.

So we need to integrate pushing the stone to pos23 into the plan.

Let's revise the plan.

Alternative approach:

After moving stone1 to pos34 and agent to pos54 (satisfying the constraint that they are both there), then the stone needs to be pushed to pos23. But how?

Alternatively, after the stone is at pos23, then proceed to push it towards pos41. But how to get the stone to pos23 after pos34.

This is getting too complex. Let's try to outline a complete plan step by step, ensuring all constraints are met.

Let's try this sequence:

1. Move agent to pos54 (satisfy constraint 1 and part of 4).

2. Move back to pos25 to push stone from pos24 to pos23 (satisfy constraint 3), ensuring that earlier state has player1 at pos54 (constraint 4).

3. Push stone to pos23.

4. Ensure that before pos23 is not clear (when stone is there), pos35 was not clear (constraint 9). So pos35 must be occupied earlier.

How to make pos35 not clear? The agent can move there, but pos35 is initially clear. So agent can move to pos35, making it not clear.

So steps:

- After pushing stone to pos23, but before that, agent must have been at pos35.

Wait, constraint 9 says: if pos23 is not clear (stone is there), then in an earlier state pos35 was not clear. So before pushing stone to pos23, pos35 must have been not clear at some point.

So agent must occupy pos35 before pushing stone to pos23.

So possible steps:

1. Agent moves from pos21 to pos35, making pos35 not clear.

2. Agent moves to pos25, pushes stone to pos23.

3. This satisfies constraint 9.

But how to get to pos35:

pos21 → pos31 (right), pos31 → pos32 (down), pos32 → pos33 (down), pos33 → pos34 (down), pos34 → pos35 (down). Then, agent is at pos35 (pos35 not clear).

Then, agent moves to pos25 (left), which is clear. Then, push stone to pos23.

This would satisfy constraint 9.

But also need to satisfy the other constraints.

So integrating all steps:

1. Move agent to pos35:

Actions:

move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright

move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown

move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown

move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown

move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown

Now, pos35 is not clear (agent is there).

2. Move agent to pos25:

From pos35, move left to pos25.

Action: move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft

3. Push stone from pos24 to pos23:

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos24 pos23 dirup

Now, stone is at pos23, agent is at pos24.

This satisfies constraint 3 (stone at pos23) and constraint 9 (pos35 was not clear earlier).

But constraint 4 requires that before stone is at pos23, either player1 was at pos54 or pos44 was not clear. But in this case, the agent was at pos35, not pos54, and pos44 was clear. So this violates constraint 4.

So this approach doesn't work. Therefore, we need to have either player1 at pos54 or pos44 not clear before pushing to pos23.

So let's try:

1. Agent moves to pos54 (satisfies constraint 1 and part of 4).

2. Then, agent moves to pos44 (dirleft from pos54 to pos44), making pos44 not clear (satisfies constraint 2).

3. Then, agent moves back to pos25 and pushes stone to pos23 (now, since pos44 was not clear earlier, constraint 4 is satisfied).

4. Also, before pushing to pos23, agent must have made pos35 not clear (constraint 9).

This is getting very complex. Let's try to outline the steps in order:

- Agent moves to pos54 (constraint 1).

- Agent moves to pos44 (dirleft), making pos44 not clear (constraint 2).

- Agent moves to pos35, making pos35 not clear (constraint 9).

- Agent moves to pos25, pushes stone to pos23 (constraint 3 and 4).

- Then, push stone to pos34 (to satisfy constraint 7 when agent is at pos54).

But this is getting too long. Let's try to find a sequence that covers all constraints.

Alternative plan outline:

1. Move agent to pos54 (satisfies constraint 1).

2. Move agent to pos44 (dirleft), making pos44 not clear (satisfies constraint 2).

3. Move agent to pos35 (dirleft from pos44 to pos34, then down to pos35), making pos35 not clear (satisfies constraint 9's precondition).

4. Move agent to pos25, push stone to pos23 (constraint 3, and since earlier pos44 was not clear, constraint 4 is satisfied).

5. Then, push stone from pos23 to pos33 (east), then to pos43 (east), then to pos44 (east), then to pos54 (south), but pos44 is a non-goal. Then, push to pos43, pos42, pos41 (goal).

But during this, ensure that when stone is at pos34 and agent at pos54 (constraint 7).

Alternatively, after step 4, push stone to pos34 and agent to pos54.

But this requires more steps.

This is extremely complex, and due to time constraints, I'll have to settle on a plan that possibly meets all the constraints, even if it's long.
