Alright, I have a planning problem which involves moving a stone to a goal location. Let's break down the problem:

### World Grid:
This is a 5x5 grid where each position (posXY) represents a location, where X is the column index (1-5) and Y is the row index (1-5).

### Objects:
1. `player1`: The agent/person who moves.
2. `stone1`: The stone that needs to be moved.
3. Locations: `pos11` to `pos55`, forming a 5x5 grid.
4. Directions: `dirdown`, `dirleft`, `dirright`, `dirup`.

### Initial State:
- `player1` is at location `pos35`.
- `stone1` is at location `pos32`.
- All other locations are clear (except of course `pos35` and `pos32`).
- `pos15` is the only goal location.
- Then we have a list of valid movements between locations (basically defining the grid).

### Goal:
- `stone1` is at a goal location (which is `pos15`).

### Actions:
1. `move p l_from l_to d`: Move agent `p` from `l_from` to `l_to` following direction `d`.
2. `pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d`: Agent `p` pushes stone `s` from `l_from` to goal location `l_to` following direction `d`. The agent is at `l_p` before the action.
3. `pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d`: Agent `p` pushes stone `s` from `l_from` to non-goal location `l_to` following direction `d`. The agent is at `l_p` before the action.

### Constraints:
1. `Location pos22 is not clear` must hold in at most one continuous sequence of states.
2. `Location pos13 is not clear` must hold in at least one state.
3. If `Location pos13 is not clear` holds in some state, there must be an earlier state where at least one of the following is true: `Location pos51 is not clear`, `Location pos24 is not clear`.
4. `Location pos11 is not clear` must hold in at most one continuous sequence of states.
5. `Location pos13 is not clear` must hold in at most one continuous sequence of states.
6. `Location pos42 is not clear` must hold in at most one continuous sequence of states.
7. `stone1 is at location pos14` must hold in at least one state.
8. If `stone1 is at location pos14` holds in some state, then `player1 is at location pos41` must hold at the same state or some state after.
9. At least one of the following must hold in at least one state: `Location pos23 is not clear`, `stone1 is at location pos31`.

Let's think about the overall plan. We need to move `stone1` from `pos32` to `pos15` (the goal location). We also need to satisfy the constraints. Let's sketch a rough plan:

1. We need to make sure that `stone1` reaches `pos14` at some point (constraint 7).
2. After the stone is at `pos14`, we need to ensure that `player1` reaches `pos41` (constraint 8).
3. We need to make `Location pos13 is not clear` at some point (constraint 2).
4. But before making `pos13` not clear, we need to ensure that either `pos51` or `pos24` is not clear (constraint 3).
5. We also need to satisfy constraint 9, which requires either `pos23` to be not clear or `stone1` to be at `pos31`.
6. We need to minimize the times when `pos22`, `pos11`, `pos13`, and `pos42` are not clear, to at most one continuous sequence each (constraints 1, 4, 5, 6).

Given these constraints, let's try to trace a path for moving `stone1` from `pos32` to `pos15`.

Let's first draw the initial grid to understand the layout:

```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15(Goal)
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 [S]   pos33 pos34 [P]
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

Where [S] represents the stone (`stone1` at `pos32`) and [P] represents the player (`player1` at `pos35`).

To move `stone1` to the goal (`pos15`), I need to move it up to `pos31`, then left to `pos21`, then `pos11`, then down to `pos12`, `pos13`, `pos14`, and finally `pos15`. Let's think through the steps:

First, I need to move `player1` from `pos35` to a location that allows me to push `stone1` up. I'll go to `pos33` (the location below `stone1`), then push `stone1` up to `pos31`. This satisfies part of constraint 9 (`stone1 is at location pos31`).

Then, I'll move to push `stone1` left to `pos21` and then to `pos11`. 

From `pos11`, I'll push `stone1` down to `pos12`, `pos13`, `pos14`, and finally to `pos15`. This will satisfy constraint 7 (`stone1 is at location pos14`).

After the stone reaches `pos14`, I need to ensure the player reaches `pos41` (constraint 8).

Before making `pos13` not clear (constraint 2), I need to make sure either `pos51` or `pos24` is not clear (constraint 3). Let's see how to do this.

Let's now formulate the detailed plan:

1. Move `player1` from `pos35` to `pos33`
2. Push `stone1` from `pos32` to `pos31` (upward)
3. Move `player1` from `pos32` to `pos21`
4. Push `stone1` from `pos31` to `pos21` (leftward)
5. Move `player1` from `pos31` to `pos11`
6. Push `stone1` from `pos21` to `pos11` (leftward)
7. Move `player1` from `pos21` to `pos12`
8. Push `stone1` from `pos11` to `pos12` (downward)
9. Move `player1` from `pos11` to `pos13`
10. Push `stone1` from `pos12` to `pos13` (downward)
11. Move `player1` from `pos12` to `pos14`
12. Push `stone1` from `pos13` to `pos14` (downward)
13. Move `player1` to `pos41` (to satisfy constraint 8)
14. Push `stone1` from `pos14` to `pos15` (downward, the goal location)

Wait, there's an issue with constraint 3. It says that if `Location pos13 is not clear` holds, there must be an earlier state where either `Location pos51 is not clear` or `Location pos24 is not clear`. In our plan, the stone will be at `pos13` at step 10, but we don't have the stone at either `pos51` or `pos24` before that. Let's adjust our plan.

I need to satisfy constraint 3. Since the stone starts at `pos32`, it's easier to make `pos24` not clear than `pos51`. So, I'll modify the plan:

1. Move `player1` from `pos35` to `pos34` (initial move)
2. Move `player1` from `pos34` to `pos24` (move up to prepare pushing the stone to `pos24`)
3. Move `player1` from `pos24` to `pos23` (continue moving towards `pos32`)
4. Move `player1` from `pos23` to `pos33` (now player is just below the stone)
5. Push `stone1` from `pos32` to `pos33` (downward)
6. Move `player1` from `pos32` to `pos23` (move to prepare pushing the stone right)
7. Push `stone1` from `pos33` to `pos43` (rightward)
8. Move `player1` from `pos33` to `pos34` (move to prepare pushing the stone up)
9. Move `player1` from `pos34` to `pos44` (continue moving to get above the stone)
10. Move `player1` from `pos44` to `pos43` (now player is above the stone)
11. Push `stone1` from `pos43` to `pos33` (leftward, returning to where the stone was)
12. Move `player1` from `pos43` to `pos34` (move to prepare pushing the stone further left)
13. Move `player1` from `pos34` to `pos24` (now the stone will be at `pos24`, satisfying constraint 3)
14. Push `stone1` from `pos33` to `pos23` (leftward)
15. Push `stone1` from `pos23` to `pos24` (downward, now `pos24` is not clear)
16. Move `player1` from `pos23` to `pos33` (move to prepare for pushing the stone back up)
17. Move `player1` from `pos33` to `pos34` (continue moving)
18. Move `player1` from `pos34` to `pos24` (now player is above the stone)
19. Push `stone1` from `pos24` to `pos23` (upward)
20. Move `player1` from `pos24` to `pos22` (move to prepare pushing the stone left)
21. Push `stone1` from `pos23` to `pos22` (leftward)
22. Move `player1` from `pos23` to `pos32` (move to get below the stone)
23. Move `player1` from `pos32` to `pos33` (continue moving)
24. Move `player1` from `pos33` to `pos23` (continue moving)
25. Move `player1` from `pos23` to `pos13` (move to position to push the stone up)
26. Move `player1` from `pos13` to `pos12` (continue moving to get above the stone)
27. Move `player1` from `pos12` to `pos22` (now player is above the stone)
28. Push `stone1` from `pos22` to `pos12` (upward)
29. Move `player1` from `pos22` to `pos13` (move to prepare pushing the stone right)
30. Push `stone1` from `pos12` to `pos13` (downward, now `pos13` is not clear, satisfying constraint 2)
31. Move `player1` from `pos12` to `pos14` (move to prepare pushing the stone right)
32. Push `stone1` from `pos13` to `pos14` (downward, now satisfying constraint 7)
33. Move `player1` from `pos13` to `pos14` (position to push the stone to the goal)
34. Move `player1` from `pos14` to `pos24` (continue moving to prepare for a different approach)
35. Move `player1` from `pos24` to `pos34` (continue moving)
36. Move `player1` from `pos34` to `pos44` (continue moving)
37. Move `player1` from `pos44` to `pos43` (continue moving)
38. Move `player1` from `pos43` to `pos42` (continue moving)
39. Move `player1` from `pos42` to `pos41` (now satisfying constraint 8)
40. Move `player1` from `pos41` to `pos31` (moving back to push the stone)
41. Move `player1` from `pos31` to `pos32` (continue moving)
42. Move `player1` from `pos32` to `pos33` (continue moving)
43. Move `player1` from `pos33` to `pos23` (continue moving)
44. Move `player1` from `pos23` to `pos13` (continue moving)
45. Move `player1` from `pos13` to `pos14` (now player is above the stone)
46. Push `stone1` from `pos14` to `pos15` (downward, pushing it to the goal)

Ok, wait. I was mistaken in my approach. I should be actually using the `pushtogoal` or `pushtonongoal` actions based on whether the target location is a goal or not. And I need to make sure the player positioning is correct for these actions. Let's approach this differently:

Let's analyze the constraints again:

1. `Location pos22 is not clear` must hold in at most one continuous sequence of states. This suggests that I should either avoid having `stone1` at `pos22` or if I need to have it there, it should be for a continuous sequence of states (no intermittent clearing of the location).
2. `Location pos13 is not clear` must hold in at least one state. The stone should be at `pos13` at some point.
3. If `Location pos13 is not clear` holds, there must be an earlier state where either `Location pos51 is not clear` or `Location pos24 is not clear`.
4. Constraints 4, 5, 6 are similar to constraint 1, suggesting I should minimize the time these locations are not clear.
5. `stone1 is at location pos14` must hold in at least one state. The stone should be at `pos14` at some point.
6. After the stone is at `pos14`, the player should reach `pos41`.
7. Either `pos23` should be not clear or `stone1` should be at `pos31` at some point.

I'm going to design a plan that meets these constraints, using the actual actions properly:

1. The player is initially at `pos35`. Let's move the player to be able to push the stone upwards:
   - `move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup`
   - `move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup`

2. Now, the player is just below the stone. Let's push it upwards to get to `pos31` (addressing constraint 9):
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirup`

3. Let's push the stone towards `pos24` to satisfy constraint 3:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos31 pos21 dirleft`
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos22 dirdown`
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirdown`
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown`

4. Let's push the stone back up and then towards `pos13` to satisfy constraint 2:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos23 dirup`
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirleft`

5. Let's push the stone to `pos14` to satisfy constraint 7:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos13 pos14 dirdown`

6. Let's move the player to `pos41` to satisfy constraint 8:
   - `move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright`
   - `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright`
   - `move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright`
   - `move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup`
   - `move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup`

7. Let's move the player back to `pos14` to push the stone to the goal:
   - `move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown`
   - `move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown`
   - `move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown`

8. Finally, push the stone to the goal:
   - `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos14 pos15 dirdown`

Wait, there's an issue with step 8. The player is already at `pos14`, so it can't push the stone from `pos14`. Let's adjust:

7. Let's move the player back to push the stone to the goal:
   - `move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown`
   - `move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown`

8. Push the stone to the goal:
   - `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown`

Now, let's look back at our sequence of steps and check if all the constraints are met:

- Constraint 2: `stone1` is at `pos13` at one point.
- Constraint 3: Before `stone1` is at `pos13`, it's at `pos24`.
- Constraint 7: `stone1` is at `pos14` at one point.
- Constraint 8: After `stone1` is at `pos14`, `player1` reaches `pos41`.
- Constraint 9: `stone1` is at `pos31` at one point.

Constraints 1, 4, 5, 6 demand that certain locations be not clear in at most one continuous sequence of states. Let's check if these are met:

- Constraint 1: `pos22` is occupied only once in our sequence (steps 3).
- Constraint 4: `pos11` is never occupied in our sequence, which satisfies the constraint.
- Constraint 5: `pos13` is occupied only once in our sequence (steps 4-5).
- Constraint 6: `pos42` is only occupied once during our player's movement from `pos43` to `pos41` in step 6.

I missed that `pos11` is also not clear when the player is passing through in step 7. Similarly, the player passes through `pos13` a few times. But the constraints only say "is not clear" must hold in at most one continuous sequence of states, and I interpret "not clear" as when a location is occupied by either the player or the stone.

Let's adjust to ensure that the locations are not clear in at most one continuous sequence of states:

Specifically for moving the player back to push the stone to the goal, we can try a different route to avoid `pos11` and `pos13`:

7. Let's move the player back to push the stone to the goal:
   - `move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown`
   - `move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown`
   - `move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown`
   - `move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown`
   - `move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright`
   - `move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup`
   - `move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup`
   - `move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft`

8. Push the stone to the goal:
   - `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown`

Oops, I passed through `pos14` while the stone is there, which isn't valid. Let's try again:

7. Let's move the player back to push the stone to the goal:
   - `move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown`
   - `move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown`
   - `move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft`

8. Push the stone to the goal:
   - `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown`

Wait, let's double-check the entire sequence with the specific actions. Since I have my plan more or less ready, I'm going to execute the whole plan using the given actions:

1. The player is initially at `pos35`. Let's move the player to be able to push the stone upwards:
   - `move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup`
   - `move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup`

2. Now, the player is just below the stone. Let's push it upwards to get to `pos31` (addressing constraint 9):
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirup`

3. Let's push the stone towards `pos24` to satisfy constraint 3:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos31 pos21 dirleft`
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos22 dirdown`
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirdown`
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown`

4. Let's push the stone back up and then towards `pos13` to satisfy constraint 2:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos23 dirup`
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirleft`

5. Let's push the stone to `pos14` to satisfy constraint 7:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos13 pos14 dirdown`

6. Let's move the player to `pos41` to satisfy constraint 8:
   - `move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright`
   - `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright`
   - `move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright`
   - `move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup`
   - `move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup`

7. Let's move the player back to push the stone to the goal:
   - `move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown`
   - `move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown`
   - `move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft`

8. Push the stone to the goal:
   - `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown`

Wait, I need to make sure constraints 1, 4, 5, and 6 are satisfied. These constraints require that certain locations be not clear in at most one continuous sequence of states. Let me review the steps:

- Constraint 1: `pos22` is occupied by the stone in step 3, and the player passes through it in the original step 7, but I've changed step 7 to avoid `pos22`. So, this constraint is met.
- Constraint 4: `pos11` is never occupied in our sequence, which satisfies the constraint.
- Constraint 5: `pos13` is occupied by the stone in step 4 and by the player in step 7. This might violate the constraint.
- Constraint 6: `pos42` is only occupied once, by the player during our player's movement from `pos43` to `pos41`. This constraint is met.

Let's reconsider our approach for step 7. I need to ensure `pos13` is only not clear in one continuous sequence of states.

7. Let's move the player back to push the stone to the goal, avoiding `pos13`:
   - `move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown`
   - `move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown`
   - `move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown`
   - `move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown`
   - `move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright`
   - `move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup`
   - `move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup`
   - `move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown`
   - `move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup`

Hmm, but this brings us back to `pos13`. Let's try a different approach from the beginning.

Actually, I now realize that "location X is not clear" means that there's an object (either stone or player) at that location. So, in our original plan, if the player passes through a location that's already been occupied by the stone (or vice versa), it's still considered the same continuous sequence of states where that location is not clear.

Let's stick with the original plan, but ensure that if the player passes through a location, that location hasn't been cleared and then occupied again in between.

1. The player is initially at `pos35`. Let's move the player to be able to push the stone upwards:
   - `move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup`
   - `move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup`

2. Now, the player is just below the stone. Let's push it upwards to get to `pos31` (addressing constraint 9):
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirup`

3. Let's push the stone towards `pos24` to satisfy constraint 3:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos31 pos21 dirleft`
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos22 dirdown`
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirdown`
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown`

4. Let's push the stone back up and then towards `pos13` to satisfy constraint 2:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos23 dirup`
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirleft`

5. Let's push the stone to `pos14` to satisfy constraint 7:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos13 pos14 dirdown`

6. Let's move the player to `pos41` to satisfy constraint 8:
   - `move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright`
   - `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright`
   - `move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright`
   - `move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup`
   - `move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup`

7. Let's move the player back to push the stone to the goal, avoiding occupied locations that have already been cleared:
   - `move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown`
   - `move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown`
   - `move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown`
   - `move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft`

8. Push the stone to the goal:
   - `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos14 pos15 dirdown`

Wait, there's a problem here. The player is at `pos14` and the stone is also at `pos14`. That's not possible. Let me adjust:

7. Let's move the player back to push the stone to the goal, avoiding occupied locations that have already been cleared:
   - `move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown`
   - `move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown`
   - `move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown`
   - `move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown`
   - `move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup`

8. Push the stone to the goal:
   - `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos14 pos15 dirdown`

I'm making the same mistake. The player can't push a stone from the location the player is already at. Let's revise:

7. Let's move the player back to push the stone to the goal, avoiding occupied locations that have already been cleared:
   - `move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown`
   - `move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown`
   - `move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft`

8. Push the stone to the goal:
   - `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown`

Wait, this isn't right. Let's revise step 8.

In the `pushtogoal` action, the preconditions say:
- The agent is at `l_p`.
- The stone is at `l_from`.
- The location `l_to` is clear.
- You can go from `l_p` to `l_from` following direction `d`.
- You can go from `l_from` to `l_to` following direction `d`.
- Location `l_to` is a goal location.

In this case:
- The agent is at `pos13`.
- The stone is at `pos14`.
- The location `pos15` is clear.
- You can go from `pos13` to `pos14` following direction `dirdown`.
- You can go from `pos14` to `pos15` following direction `dirdown`.
- Location `pos15` is a goal location.

So, the action would be:
- `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown`

Alright, now I'm confident that the entire plan is valid. Let's finalize it:

1. `move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup`
2. `move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup`
3. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirup`
4. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos31 pos21 dirleft`
5. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos22 dirdown`
6. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirdown`
7. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown`
8. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos23 dirup`
9. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirleft`
10. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos13 pos14 dirdown`
11. `move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright`
12. `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright`
13. `move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright`
14. `move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup`
15. `move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup`
16. `move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown`
17. `move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown`
18. `move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft`
19. `move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft`
20. `move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft`
21. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown`

Let's check if all the constraints are met:

1. `Location pos22 is not clear` holds only once in steps 5-6.
2. `Location pos13 is not clear` holds in steps 9-10 and 20.
3. `Location pos24 is not clear` holds in steps 7-8, which is before `Location pos13 is not clear` in steps 9-10.
4. `Location pos11 is not clear` never holds.
5. `Location pos13 is not clear` holds in steps 9-10 and 20.
6. `Location pos42 is not clear` holds in steps 14-15 and 16-17.
7. `stone1 is at location pos14` holds in step 10.
8. After `stone1 is at location pos14` in step 10, `player1 is at location pos41` in step 15.
9. `stone1 is at location pos31` holds in steps 3-4.

I don't think that constraints 5 and 6 are met since there are two discontinuous sequences where the locations are not clear. But, reading the constraint carefully, it states: "must hold in at most one continuous sequence of states." I'm interpreting this as saying that the location can only be "not clear" for one continuous stretch. It can't be "not clear", then become "clear", and then become "not clear" again.

Let's see if we can refactor the plan to meet these constraints. First, I'll redraw the grid to visualize better:

```
11 12 13 14 15(Goal)
21 22 23 24 25
31 32 33 34 35
41 42 43 44 45
51 52 53 54 55
```

Let's consider a more direct path:

1. `move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup`
2. `move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup`
3. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirup`
4. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos31 pos21 dirleft`
5. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos11 dirleft`
6. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos11 pos12 dirdown`
7. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown`
8. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirdown`
9. `move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright`
10. `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright`
11. `move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright`
12. `move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown`
13. `move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown`
14. `move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright`
15. `move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup`
16. `move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup`
17. `move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup`
18. `move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup`
19. `move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft`
20. `move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft`
21. `move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft`
22. `move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft`
23. `move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown`
24. `move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown`
25. `move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown`
26. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos14 pos15 dirdown`

Wait, let's hold off. Let's reconsider the constraints. Constraint 3 states that if `Location pos13 is not clear` holds in some state, there must be an earlier state in which `Location pos51 is not clear` or `Location pos24 is not clear` is true. This requires me to make either `pos51` or `pos24` not clear before making `pos13` not clear.

Wait, let's think about this differently. Are the locations only "not clear" when occupied by the stone, or does the player also make the location "not clear"? I think both the player and the stone make a location "not clear". 

With this interpretation, many of the constraints would be violated in my plan. Let's clarify how I understand the constraints:

1. `Location pos22 is not clear` must hold in at most one continuous sequence of states. Interpretation: Locations `pos22` can only be occupied (by either player or stone) in one continuous sequence of states.
2. `Location pos13 is not clear` must hold in at least one state. Interpretation: Locations `pos13` must be occupied at least once.
3. If `Location pos13 is not clear` holds, there must be an earlier state where either `Location pos51 is not clear` or `Location pos24 is not clear`. Interpretation: Before `pos13` becomes occupied, either `pos51` or `pos24` must be occupied.
4. `Location pos11 is not clear` must hold in at most one continuous sequence of states. Similar to Constraint 1.
5. `Location pos13 is not clear` must hold in at most one continuous sequence of states. Similar to Constraint 1.
6. `Location pos42 is not clear` must hold in at most one continuous sequence of states. Similar to Constraint 1.
7. `stone1 is at location pos14` must hold in at least one state. Interpretation: The stone must be at `pos14` at least once.
8. After `stone1 is at location pos14`, `player1 is at location pos41` must hold at the same state or some state after. Interpretation: After the stone is at `pos14`, the player should reach `pos41`.
9. At least one of the following must hold in at least one state: `Location pos23 is not clear` or `stone1 is at location pos31`.

With these interpretations, let's try to refine our plan. I'll have to be careful about ensuring that certain locations are only occupied in one continuous sequence.

Let's try a new approach:

1. `move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup`
2. `move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup`
3. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirup`
   (This satisfies constraint 9 by having the stone at `pos31`.)
4. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos31 pos41 dirright`
5. `move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown`
6. `move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown`
7. `move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown`
8. `move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft`
   (Player at `pos24` makes this location not clear, satisfying constraint 3.)
9. `move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown`
10. `move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright`
11. `move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright`
12. `move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup`
13. `move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup`
14. `move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup`
15. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos41 pos31 dirleft`
16. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos31 pos21 dirleft`
17. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos11 dirleft`
18. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos11 pos12 dirdown`
19. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown`
   (Stone at `pos13` makes this location not clear, satisfying constraint 2.)
20. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirdown`
   (Stone at `pos14` satisfies constraint 7.)
21. `move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup`
22. `move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup`
23. `move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright`
24. `move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright`
25. `move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright`
   (Player at `pos41` satisfies constraint 8.)
26. `move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft`
27. `move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft`
28. `move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft`
29. `move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown`
30. `move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown`
31. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown`

Hmm, there might still be issues. Let's reconsider the problem:

In my last plan, I think I addressed most of the constraints, but:
- The player passes through `pos11` in steps 22-23 and 28-29. This might violate constraint 4 if the player makes the location "not clear".
- Similarly for `pos13` in steps 19-21 and 30-31.
- And for `pos42` in steps 14-15.

I'm going to try a more careful plan. I'll have to be careful about constraints 1, 4, 5, and 6, which require certain locations to be not clear in at most one continuous sequence of states. Let's also try to cut corners where possible.

OK, I realized I was overthinking it. If we think about it, I should be able to design a path where the player doesn't have to go back to push the stone after reaching pos41.

Let me redo the approach from scratch and be more strategic:

First, let me fulfill constraint 3 by making `pos24` not clear:
1. `move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup`
2. `move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft`

Next, let me push the stone to `pos13` to fulfill constraint 2:
3. `move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup`
4. `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright`
5. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos22 dirleft`
6. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft`
7. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos12 pos13 dirdown`

Now, let me fulfill constraint 7 by pushing the stone to `pos14`:
8. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirdown`

next, let me fulfill constraint 9 by making the stone at `pos31`:
9. `move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright`
10. `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright`
11. `move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright`
12. `move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown`
13. `move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown`
14. `move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft`
15. `move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft`
16. `move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft`
17. `move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup`
18. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos14 pos24 dirright`
19. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright`
20. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos33 dirup`
21. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos32 dirup`
22. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirup`

Next, let me fulfill constraint 8 by reaching `pos41`:
23. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos31 pos41 dirright`
24. `move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright`

Finally, let me push the stone to the goal:
25. `move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown`
26. `move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft`
27. `move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft`
28. `move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft`
29. `move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown`
30. `move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown`
31. `move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown`
32. `move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright`
33. `move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright`
34. `move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright`
35. `move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup`
36. `move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup`
37. `move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup`
38. `move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup`
39. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos41 pos31 dirleft`
40. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos31 pos21 dirleft`
41. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos11 dirleft`
42. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos11 pos12 dirdown`
43. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown`
44. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirdown`
45. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown`

I think I've made some errors, let me re-analyze carefully.

In step 18, the player is at `pos14` and the stone is also at `pos14`, which isn't possible.

Let's redesign:

1. `move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup`
2. `move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft`

Next, let me push the stone to `pos13` to fulfill constraint 2:
3. `move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup`
4. `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright`
5. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos22 dirleft`
6. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft`
7. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos12 pos13 dirdown`

Now, let me fulfill constraint 7 by pushing the stone to `pos14`:
8. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirdown`

next, let me fulfill constraint 9 by making the stone at `pos31`:
9. `move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup`
10. `move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup`
11. `move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright`
12. `move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright`
13. `move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright`
14. `move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright`
15. `move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown`
16. `move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown`
17. `move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown`
18. `move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown`
19. `move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft`
20. `move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft`
21. `move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft`
22. `move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft`
23. `move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup`
24. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos15 pos14 pos24 dirright`
25. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright`
26. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos33 dirup`
27. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos32 dirup`
28. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirup`

Next, let me fulfill constraint 8 by reaching `pos41`:
29. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos31 pos41 dirright`
30. `move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright`

Finally, let me push the stone to the goal:
31. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos41 pos31 dirleft`

Hmm, I'm making the same error again. Let's be more careful. One key issue when pushing the stone is that the player needs to be *adjacent* to the stone, not at the stone's location.

Refining the plan:

I need to satisfy constraints 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Starting from the initial state:
The player is at `pos35`. The stone is at `pos32`.

Let me first satisfy constraint 3 by making `pos24` not clear:
1. `move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup`
2. `move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft`

Next, to fulfill constraint 2, I'll push the stone to `pos13`:
3. `move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup`
4. `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright`
5. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos22 dirleft`
6. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft`
7. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos12 pos13 dirdown`

Now, to fulfill constraint 7, I'll push the stone to `pos14`:
8. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirdown`

Next, to fulfill constraint 9, I need to have the stone at `pos31`. But before that, I'll fulfill constraint 8 by reaching `pos41`:
9. `move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup`
10. `move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright`
11. `move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright`
12. `move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright`
13. `move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup`

Now, I'll loop back to fulfill constraint 9:
14. `move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft`
15. `move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft`
16. `move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft`
17. `move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown`
18. `move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown`
19. `move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown`
20. `move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright`
21. `move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright`
22. `move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup`
23. `move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup`
24. `move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup`

Now, the player is at `pos31`, and the stone is at `pos14`. Let's bring the stone to `pos31` to fulfill constraint 9:
25. `move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft`
26. `move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft`
27. `move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown`
28. `move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown`
29. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos24 dirright`
30. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright`
31. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos33 dirup`
32. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos32 dirup`
33. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirup`

Now, I'll push the stone to the goal:
34. `move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown`
35. `move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft`
36. `move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft`
37. `move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown`
38. `move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown`
39. `move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright`
40. `move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright`
41. `move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup`
42. `move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup`
43. `move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup`
44. `move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup`
45. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos31 pos21 dirleft`
46. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos11 dirleft`
47. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos11 pos12 dirdown`
48. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown`
49. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirdown`
50. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown`

Hmm, in step 45, the player is at `pos31` and the stone is also at `pos31`. Same issue. I'm struggling with this part because I'm not understanding how to "push" a stone from the same position the player is at. Let me reread the actions more carefully...

OK, upon rereading the actions:

- `move`: moves the player from one location to another
- `pushtogoal`: player pushes stone to a goal location (player is at `l_p`, stone is at `l_from`, and push to goal `l_to`)
- `pushtonongoal`: player pushes stone to a non-goal location (player is at `l_p`, stone is at `l_from`, and push to non-goal `l_to`)

I think my issue is that I'm not understanding the parameters correctly. Here's how I understand it:

- `l_p` is the initial position of the player before the action
- `l_from` is the initial position of the stone before the action
- `l_to` is the final position of the stone after the action

If that's the case, let's rewrite our steps:

Revisiting the preconditions, for `pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d`:
- Agent p is at location l_p 
- Stone s is at location l_from 
- Location l_to is clear 
- You can get from l_p to l_from following d 
- You can get from l_from to l_to following d 
- l_to is not a goal location

And for effects:
- Agent p is no longer at l_p 
- Stone s is no longer at l_from 
- Location l_to is no longer clear 
- Agent p is at l_from 
- Stone s is at l_to 
- Location l_p is clear 
- Stone s is at a non-goal state

This makes more sense. The player pushes the stone from position l_from to l_to, and in doing so, the player moves from l_p to l_from.

Now, for our plan:

Starting from the initial state, the player is at `pos35`. The stone is at `pos32`.

I'll first satisfy constraint 3 by making `pos24` not clear by moving the player through it:
1. `move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup`
2. `move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft`

Next, I'll move the player to be able to push the stone:
3. `move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup`
4. `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright`

Now, the player is at `pos33` (just below the stone). I'll push the stone upwards:
5. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirup`

This gives me: player at `pos32`, stone at `pos31` (satisfying constraint 9 where `stone1 is at location pos31`).

I'll now push the stone towards `pos13`:
6. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos31 pos21 dirleft`
7. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos11 dirleft`
8. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos11 pos12 dirdown`
9. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown`

The player is now at `pos12` and the stone is at `pos13` (satisfying constraint 2 where `Location pos13 is not clear`).

Now, I'll push the stone to `pos14`:
10. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirdown`

The player is at `pos13` and the stone is at `pos14` (satisfying constraint 7 where `stone1 is at location pos14`).

Now, I need to move the player to `pos41` to satisfy constraint 8:
11. `move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright`
12. `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright`
13. `move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright`
14. `move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup`
15. `move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup`

The player is now at `pos41`, satisfying constraint 8.

Finally, I'll move the player to push the stone to the goal:
16. `move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft`
17. `move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft`
18. `move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft`
19. `move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown`
20. `move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown`
21. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown`

Now the stone is at the goal (`pos15`), satisfying the main goal.

Let's check the constraints:

1. `Location pos22 is not clear` never holds in our plan, so this constraint is satisfied.
2. `Location pos13 is not clear` holds in steps 9-10 and 20-21, but these form two separate continuous sequences. This might violate the constraint 5.
3. Before `pos13` becomes not clear (step 9), `pos24` is not clear (step 2), satisfying constraint 3.
4. `Location pos11 is not clear` holds in steps 7-8 and 18-19, but these form two separate continuous sequences. This might violate constraint 4.
5. Discussed in 2.
6. `Location pos42 is not clear` holds in steps 14-15, and only once, satisfying constraint 6.
7. `stone1 is at location pos14` holds in step 10, satisfying constraint 7.
8. After `stone1 is at location pos14` (step 10), `player1 is at location pos41` holds in step 15, satisfying constraint 8.
9. `stone1 is at location pos31` holds in step 5, satisfying constraint 9.

So, constraints 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are satisfied. But constraints 2, 4, and 5 might not be, based on my understanding.

OK, let's try a more direct plan from the beginning, and I'll be especially careful about constraints 4 and 5, ensuring that `pos11` and `pos13` are not clear in at most one continuous sequence of states each.

Starting from the initial state, the player is at `pos35`. The stone is at `pos32`.

I'll first satisfy constraint 3 by making `pos24` not clear by moving the player through it:
1. `move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup`
2. `move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft`

Next, I'll move the player to be able to push the stone:
3. `move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup`
4. `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright`

Now, the player is at `pos33` (just below the stone). I'll push the stone to get to `pos31`, satisfying constraint 9:
5. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirup`

Instead of pushing the stone from `pos31` to `pos11` and making `pos11` not clear (which would later cause us to violate constraint 4), I'll push it towards `pos41` and then back around to `pos13`:

6. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos31 pos41 dirright`
7. `move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown`
8. `move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown`
9. `move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright`
10. `move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup`
11. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos41 pos51 dirright`
12. `move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown`
13. `move player1 pos42 pos52 dirright`
14. `move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup`
15. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos51 pos51 pos41 dirleft`

Oops, I've made the same error again. Let's double check the actions:
- For `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos51 pos51 pos41 dirleft`, the player is at `pos51` and the stone is also at `pos51`, which is impossible.

I think I need to be more systematic and careful. Let's revise the plan:

Starting from the initial state, the player is at `pos35`. The stone is at `pos32`.

I'll first satisfy constraint 3 by making `pos24` not clear by moving the player through it:
1. `move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup`
2. `move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft`

Next, I'll move the player to be able to push the stone:
3. `move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup`
4. `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright`

Now, the player is at `pos33` (just below the stone). I'll push the stone to get to `pos31`, satisfying constraint 9:
5. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirup`

Now, the player is at `pos32` and the stone is at `pos31`.

I'll move the player to push the stone to `pos13` in a different way:
6. `move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft`
7. `move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup`
8. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos31 pos32 dirdown`

Now, the player is at `pos31` and the stone is at `pos32`.

9. `move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft`
10. `move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft`
11. `move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown`
12. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos32 pos22 dirleft`

Now, the player is at `pos32` and the stone is at `pos22`.

13. `move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft`
14. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos22 pos12 dirleft`

Oops, made the same error again. Let me think...

OK, I think here's a more direct plan:

Starting from the initial state, the player is at `pos35`. The stone is at `pos32`.

1. `move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup`
2. `move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft`
   (Player at `pos24` makes this location not clear, satisfying constraint 3.)
3. `move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup`
4. `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright`

Now, the player is at `pos33` (just below the stone).

5. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirup`
   (Stone at `pos31` satisfies constraint 9.)

Now, the player is at `pos32` and the stone is at `pos31`. I'll move the player to push the stone to `pos13`:

6. `move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft`
7. `move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup`
8. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos31 pos21 dirleft`

Now, the player is at `pos31` and the stone is at `pos21`.

9. `move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft`
10. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos21 pos11 dirleft`

Hmm, I'm making the same error again. Let me reanalyze.

I think when I do a `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 l_p l_from l_to d`, after this action, the player is at `l_from` and the stone is at `l_to`. The player is initially at `l_p`, and the stone is initially at `l_from`.

So, in step 8 above, I'm saying the player is at `pos21`, the stone is at `pos31`, and I'm trying to push the stone from `pos31` to `pos21`. But after step 7, the player is at `pos21` and the stone is at `pos31`. So, in step 8, I'd actually use `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos31 pos21 dirleft`.

But this action isn't valid, because `l_to` (`pos21`) isn't clear (the player is there).

Let me trace the states more carefully:

After step 5, the player is at `pos32` and the stone is at `pos31`.

In step 6, the player moves to `pos22`.

In step 7, the player moves to `pos21`.

This puts the player at `pos21` and the stone at `pos31`.

Now, to push the stone from `pos31` to a position where I can eventually get it to `pos13`, I need a valid move, where the destination is clear.

Let's see... If I push from `pos31` to `pos32` (back to where the stone was), the destination is clear. So:

8. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos31 pos32 dirdown`

After this, the player is at `pos31` and the stone is at `pos32`.

9. `move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft`
10. `move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown`
11. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos22 dirleft`

After this, the player is at `pos32` and the stone is at `pos22`.

12. `move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown`
13. `move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft`
14. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos12 dirleft`

After this, the player is at `pos22` and the stone is at `pos12`.

15. `move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown`
16. `move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft`
17. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos13 dirdown`

Now, the player is at `pos12` and the stone is at `pos13` (satisfying constraint 2).

18. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirdown`

Now, the player is at `pos13` and the stone is at `pos14` (satisfying constraint 7).

19. `move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright`
20. `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright`
21. `move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright`
22. `move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup`
23. `move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup`

The player is now at `pos41`, satisfying constraint 8.

24. `move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft`
25. `move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft`
26. `move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft`
27. `move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown`
28. `move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown`
29. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown`

Now the stone is at the goal (`pos15`), satisfying the main goal.

Let's check the constraints:

1. `Location pos22 is not clear` holds in steps 6-7, 11-12, and 14-15. This violates constraint 1.
2. `Location pos13 is not clear` holds in steps 17-18 and 28-29. This violates constraint 5.
3. Before `pos13` becomes not clear (step 17), `pos24` is not clear (step 2), satisfying constraint 3.
4. `Location pos11 is not clear` holds in step 26-27, satisfying constraint 4.
5. Discussed in 2.
6. `Location pos42 is not clear` holds in steps 22-23, satisfying constraint 6.
7. `stone1 is at location pos14` holds in step 18, satisfying constraint 7.
8. After `stone1 is at location pos14` (step 18), `player1 is at location pos41` holds in step 23, satisfying constraint 8.
9. `stone1 is at location pos31` holds in step 5, satisfying constraint 9.

I'm going to redesign the plan from the ground up to specifically address the requirements for constraints 1 and 5 (and hope the other constraints come naturally):

1. `move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup`
2. `move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft`
   (Player at `pos24` makes this location not clear, satisfying constraint 3.)
3. `move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright`
4. `move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup`
   (Player below the stone.)
5. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirup`
   (Stone at `pos31` satisfies constraint 9.)
6. `move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown`
7. `move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft`
8. `move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft`
   (Player at `pos13` makes this location not clear, satisfying constraint 2.)
9. `move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown`
10. `move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright`
11. `move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright`
12. `move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright`
13. `move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup`
14. `move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup`
15. `move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup`
   (Player at `pos41` will satisfy constraint 8 once the stone is at `pos14`.)
16. `move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft`
   (Player at the stone's location.)
17. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos31 pos21 dirleft`

Oops, made the same error. In a `pushtonongoal` action, the player and stone can't be at the same location. Let me rethink...

Actually, reading the preconditions carefully:
For `pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d`: 
- Agent p is at location l_p 
- Stone s is at location l_from 
- Location l_to is clear 
- You can get from l_p to l_from following d 
- You can get from l_from to l_to following d 
- l_to is not a goal location

So, the player and stone can't be at the same location, but the player must be at a location such that following direction `d` leads to the stone, and following `d` from the stone leads to the destination.

OK, rethinking the plan:

1. `move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup`
2. `move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft`
   (Player at `pos24` makes this location not clear, satisfying constraint 3.)
3. `move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup`
4. `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright`
   (Player below the stone.)
5. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirup`
   (Stone at `pos31` satisfies constraint 9.)
6. `move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown`
7. `move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright`
8. `move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright`
9. `move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup`
10. `move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup`
11. `move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft`
   (Now the player is at `pos41`, and the stone is at `pos31`.)
12. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos31 pos21 dirleft`
13. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos11 dirleft`
14. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos11 pos12 dirdown`
15. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown`
   (Stone at `pos13` satisfies constraint 2.)
16. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirdown`
   (Stone at `pos14` satisfies constraint 7, and player at `pos13`.)
17. `move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright`
18. `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright`
19. `move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright`
20. `move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup`
21. `move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup`
   (Player at `pos41` satisfies constraint 8.)
22. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos14 pos15 dirdown`

This last step isn't valid. The player is at `pos41` and the stone is at `pos14`, and I want to push the stone from `pos14` to `pos15`. But I can't get from `pos41` to `pos14` following `dirdown`.

Let me revise steps 17-22:

17. `move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown`
    (Player just below the stone, preventing `pos14` from being clear. But this might violate the constraint that `pos14` is not clear in at most one continuous sequence of states. Let's see if I can avoid this.)

Actually, if I look at the list of preconditions, for `move p l_from l_to d`, one of the preconditions is "location l_to is clear". So, the player can't move to a location occupied by a stone.

Let me go back to step 16 and rethink:

16. The stone is at `pos14` and the player is at `pos13`. I need to push the stone to `pos15` and satisfy constraint 8 (after the stone is at `pos14`, the player should reach `pos41`).

I can't move the player directly to `pos14` because it's not clear. Instead, I need to maneuver around.

16. `move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright`
17. `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright`
18. `move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright`
19. `move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup`
20. `move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup`
   (Player at `pos41` satisfies constraint 8.)
21. `move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft`
22. `move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft`
23. `move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft`
24. `move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown`
25. `move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown`
   (Player just below the stone.)
26. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown`
   (Stone at `pos15` satisfies the main goal.)

Let's check the constraints again:

1. `Location pos22 is not clear` never holds, satisfying constraint 1.
2. `Location pos13 is not clear` holds in steps 15-16 and 25-26, but these are not one continuous sequence. This violates constraint 5.
3. Before `pos13` becomes not clear (step 15), `pos24` is not clear (step 2), satisfying constraint 3.
4. `Location pos11 is not clear` holds in steps 13-14 and 23-24, but these are not one continuous sequence. This violates constraint 4.
5. Discussed in 2.
6. `Location pos42 is not clear` holds in steps 19-20, satisfying constraint 6.
7. `stone1 is at location pos14` holds in step 16, satisfying constraint 7.
8. After `stone1 is at location pos14` (step 16), `player1 is at location pos41` holds in step 20, satisfying constraint 8.
9. `stone1 is at location pos31` holds in step 5, satisfying constraint 9.

I'm struggling to find a plan that meets all the constraints. Let's try to focus on the most critical ones and see if we can find a solution.

I now realize that I misinterpreted the constraints. Here's what I was mistakenly thinking: "the location is not clear" means "it's occupied by either the player or the stone." But actually, "the location is not clear" means "it's currently occupied by an object (specifically, the stone or the player)."

Rereading constraint 5: "The following expression must hold in at most one continuous sequence of states: "Location
