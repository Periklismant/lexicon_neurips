Okay, let's try to tackle this planning problem. So the goal is to get stone1 to a goal location, which is pos15. The initial state has the agent at pos35 and stone1 at pos32. The constraints are a bit complex, so I need to make sure each one is satisfied.

First, let's note the goal locations. From the initial state, pos15 is a goal. All others are non-goals. So stone1 needs to end up at pos15.

Starting with the agent at pos35. The stone is at pos32. To push the stone to pos15, the path might be tricky. Let's think about possible paths.

But wait, the constraints are important. Let's list them:

1. pos22 not clear in at most one continuous sequence. So if the agent or stone is in pos22, it can't be for more than consecutive steps.
2. pos13 not clear must happen at least once. So we need to block pos13 at some point.
3. If pos13 is blocked, there must have been a previous state where pos51 or pos24 was blocked.
4. pos11, pos13, pos42 not clear can't be in more than one continuous sequence.
5. Stone1 must be at pos14 at least once.
6. When stone1 is at pos14, the agent must be at pos41 either at that state or after.
7. At least one state must have pos23 not clear or stone1 at pos31.

Hmm, this is a lot. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the main goal is to get stone1 to pos15. Let's plan the path for that. From pos32 to pos15. Possible path: pos32 → pos22 (left?), but pos22 is not a goal. Alternatively, maybe push the stone upwards? Let's see the movement directions.

Looking at the movement possibilities. For example, from pos32, the directions allowed. The stone is at pos32. The agent can push it if adjacent. Let's see:

To push a stone, the agent needs to be at a location adjacent to the stone in the direction they want to push. For example, to push the stone from pos32 to pos22, the agent would need to be at pos32's direction leading to pos22. Let's check the movement directions.

From the movement list, pos32 can go to pos22 (dirleft), pos42 (dirright), pos31 (dirup), or pos33 (dirdown). So if the agent is at pos32, they can move in those directions, but to push the stone, they need to be adjacent in the direction of the push.

Wait, the "pushtogoal" action requires that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's current location) in direction d. Then, the stone moves from l_from to l_to, also in direction d.

So for example, if the stone is at pos32, and the agent is at pos22 (south of pos32?), then the agent can push the stone north to pos22? Wait, directions might be a bit confusing here. Let me check the movement directions again.

Looking at the movement from pos22 to pos32 via dirright. So pos22's right is pos32. So direction dirright from pos22 leads to pos32. Therefore, if the agent is at pos22 and wants to push the stone at pos32 to pos33 (dirright?), wait no. Let me think.

Alternatively, if the agent is at pos32 and wants to push the stone, but the agent can't be on the same cell as the stone. Wait, the agent can only push the stone if they are adjacent. So for the stone at pos32, the agent needs to be in a neighboring cell from which they can push it.

Wait, the "pushtogoal" action's preconditions: (iv) you can get from l_p (agent's location) to l_from (stone's location) following direction d. So direction d is from l_p to l_from, and then from l_from to l_to in the same direction. So the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from in direction d. Then, pushing the stone from l_from to l_to (which is next in direction d). So for example, if the agent is at pos22 (l_p), direction dirright leads to pos32 (l_from). Then the stone would be pushed from pos32 (l_from) to pos42 (l_to) in direction dirright. Wait, because direction from l_p (pos22) to l_from (pos32) is dirright. Then from l_from (pos32) to l_to (pos42), also dirright. So pushing the stone from pos32 to pos42 would require the agent to be at pos22, moving right to pos32, then pushing the stone right to pos42.

But that's not helpful for getting to pos15. So maybe another approach.

Alternatively, the agent could move to pos32's north (pos31) and push the stone south to pos32 to pos33. Wait, but the stone is already at pos32. So maybe the agent can push it down (dirdown) to pos33. Let's see.

If the agent is at pos32's north (pos31), and direction dirdown leads to pos32. Then pushing the stone from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown). But pos33 is a non-goal, so that's a pushtonongoal action. But the final goal is pos15, which is a goal location. So maybe we need to push the stone to pos15 via a series of moves.

Alternatively, maybe move the stone to pos22 first, then to pos23, etc., but pos15 is the only goal. Let's think of the path from pos32 to pos15. Possible path:

pos32 → pos22 → pos23 → pos24 → pos25 → pos15. But that's a long path, and each step requires the agent to be in the correct position to push. Let's see.

First, to push stone1 from pos32 to pos22, the agent needs to be at pos32's left (pos22's direction). Wait, movement from pos22 to pos32 is dirright. So the agent could be at pos22, push the stone left (dirleft?) Wait, I'm getting confused with directions.

Wait, direction dirright from pos22 leads to pos32. So to push the stone from pos32 to pos22, the agent would need to be at pos32's right (pos42?), and push left. But perhaps I need to re-examine the movement directions.

Wait, the movement directions are defined as "You may move from location X to Y following direction D". So for example, "You may move from location pos22 to pos32 following direction dirright". That means that dirright from pos22 is pos32. So direction dirright corresponds to moving right, which in grid terms might be east. So pos22 is row 2, column 2. dirright (east) would go to column 3, so pos23? Wait, no, maybe the positions are labeled as posXY where X is row and Y is column. Wait, pos11 is row 1, column 1; pos12 is row 1, column 2. So moving right from pos22 (row 2, column 2) would go to pos23 (row 2, column 3), but according to the given movement, pos22 can move to pos32 via dirright. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps the grid is arranged with rows increasing down and columns increasing right. So pos11 is top-left, pos12 is to the right, pos21 is below pos11, etc. Then, dirright from pos22 (row 2, column 2) would be to pos23 (row 2, column 3), but according to the movement list, pos22 can move to pos32 via dirright. That suggests that direction dirright might actually be moving down, but that contradicts the name. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the directions are named differently. Let's look at some movement examples:

From pos11, you can move to pos21 (dirright) or pos12 (dirdown). So pos21 is down from pos11 (dirright is down?), and pos12 is right (dirdown is right?). That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe dirright is east, dirdown is south. Then, pos11 moving east would be pos12, and moving south would be pos21. Let's check:

Looking at the movement from pos11: "You may move from pos11 to pos21 following direction dirright" and to pos12 via dirdown. If dirright is east, pos11 to pos12 would be east. But according to that, moving dirright from pos11 takes you to pos21, which is south. So perhaps the directions are not standard. This is a problem.

Alternatively, the directions might be named such that dirright is to the right (east), dirleft is west, dirup is north, dirdown is south. Then, pos11 (1,1) moving east (dirright) would go to pos12 (1,2), and moving south (dirdown) to pos21 (2,1). But according to the movement list:

From pos11, you can move to pos21 (dirright) and pos12 (dirdown). So that contradicts standard directions. Therefore, the directions must be mapped differently.

This is crucial for planning. Let's re-express the grid:

Positions are labeled posXY where X is the row (increasing downward) and Y is the column (increasing to the right). So pos11 is row 1, column 1; pos12 is row 1, column 2; pos21 is row 2, column 1; pos22 is row 2, column 2, etc.

Given that, moving dirright from pos11 (row 1, column 1) would take you to pos12 (column 2), but according to the movement list, moving dirright from pos11 takes you to pos21. So that suggests that dirright is moving down a row. Similarly, dirdown from pos11 takes you to pos12, which is to the right. So the directions are named in a non-standard way. So:

dirright: move down a row (same column, row increases by 1)
dirleft: move up a row (same column, row decreases by 1)
dirup: move left in column (same row, column decreases by 1)
dirdown: move right in column (same row, column increases by 1)

Wait, that would explain why moving dirright from pos11 (row 1, column 1) takes you to pos21 (row 2, column 1). Similarly, moving dirdown from pos11 takes you to pos12 (row 1, column 2). So the directions are:

- dirright: down (row increases)
- dirleft: up (row decreases)
- dirup: left (column decreases)
- dirdown: right (column increases)

That's a bit counterintuitive but necessary to make sense of the given movements.

So, for example, moving from pos22 (row 2, column 2) dirright would take you to pos32 (row 3, column 2), and dirdown would take you to pos23 (row 2, column 3). Got it.

Now, considering this, the stone is at pos32 (row 3, column 2). The agent is at pos35 (row 3, column 5). The goal is to get the stone to pos15 (row 1, column 5), which is a goal location.

So the stone is currently at pos32 (row3, column2). The agent needs to navigate to push it towards pos15.

Possible path: push the stone up (dirleft) to row2, column2 (pos22), then up again to row1, column2 (pos12), then right (dirdown) to pos13, pos14, pos15. But wait, pos15 is the goal. Alternatively, maybe push the stone right (dirdown) to column3, then up, etc. Let's think.

But considering the constraints, let's see:

- The stone must be at pos14 at least once. So at some point, stone1 must be at pos14. So the path must pass through pos14.

Also, when the stone is at pos14, the agent must be at pos41 (row4, column1) either at that state or after. So after pushing to pos14, the agent needs to go to pos41.

Another constraint: in at least one state, pos23 is not clear or stone1 is at pos31. So either the agent or the stone is at pos23, or stone1 is at pos31.

Additionally, the constraint that if pos13 is blocked (i.e., not clear), then there must have been a previous state where pos51 or pos24 was blocked.

Also, pos13 not clear must occur at least once. So we need to make sure that pos13 is occupied (by agent or stone) at some point.

Moreover, pos22 not clear can only be in one continuous sequence. So if the agent or stone is in pos22, it can't be for more than consecutive steps.

So putting this all together, the plan needs to navigate the stone from pos32 to pos15, passing through pos14, and ensuring all constraints are met.

Let's sketch a possible path:

1. Agent moves from pos35 to pos34 (dirup, since pos35's dirup is pos34). Then to pos33, pos32. But wait, the stone is at pos32. So agent can't move into pos32 if it's occupied. Wait, in the initial state, pos32 is clear? Wait, initial state says "Location pos32 is clear". Wait, no: in the original state, "stone1 is at location pos32" and "Location pos32 is clear"? That can't be. Wait, looking back:

Original state includes:

"stone1 is at location pos32"

"Location pos32 is clear"

Wait, that's a contradiction. Unless "clear" means that there's nothing (agent or stone) in that location. But if the stone is at pos32, then pos32 is not clear. So perhaps there's a mistake here. Wait, the original state says:

"player1 is at location pos35"

"stone1 is at location pos32"

Then, in the list of clear locations, "Location pos32 is clear" — but that can't be true if the stone is there. So this is conflicting. Wait, perhaps the initial state description is incorrect. Let me check again.

Looking at the original state:

The original state includes:

- "stone1 is at location pos32"

- "Location pos32 is clear"

But if a stone is at pos32, then pos32 should not be clear. This seems like an error. But assuming that the problem is stated correctly, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Wait, maybe "clear" refers to the agent not being present. Because stones and the agent can both be in a location, but "clear" might mean that the agent is not there, and stones are considered part of the location's state but not affecting "clear". Wait, the problem statement says: "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So each location can have at most one entity: agent, stone, or empty. So if a stone is at pos32, then pos32 is not clear. Therefore, the original state has a contradiction. This must be a mistake. Let me check again.

Original state:

"player1 is at location pos35"

"stone1 is at location pos32"

Then in the list of clear locations:

"Location pos32 is clear"

This is a contradiction. So perhaps there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe "clear" refers to the agent not being present, and stones are allowed. Wait, but the problem statement says "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So each position can have only one of those. Therefore, if a stone is at pos32, then pos32 is not clear. So the original state has a mistake. But the user provided this, so we have to work with it. Wait, maybe in the initial state, the stone is at pos32 but pos32 is clear? That's impossible. So this must be a typo. Wait, perhaps the stone is at pos32, and pos32 is not clear. But according to the original state, "Location pos32 is clear". That can't be. Therefore, perhaps the correct initial state is that pos32 is not clear, but it's stated as clear. This is a problem. However, since this is part of the problem statement, perhaps we have to proceed assuming that despite the stone being at pos32, pos32 is considered clear. But that contradicts the problem's own definitions. Therefore, perhaps it's a typo, and the initial state should have pos32 not clear. But given that the user provided this, maybe I should proceed as if the stone is at pos32 and pos32 is not clear (i.e., the "clear" in the initial state is a mistake). Alternatively, maybe the stone's presence doesn't affect the "clear" status, only the agent's presence does. That could be possible. For example, "clear" means the agent is not there. So a location is clear if the agent is not present, regardless of stones. In that case, even if a stone is at pos32, pos32 is clear if the agent is not there. That would resolve the contradiction. So in this problem, "clear" refers to the agent's absence, not the stone's. That makes sense because the preconditions for move actions require the destination to be clear (i.e., no agent there). So when a stone is present, the location is still considered clear for the purpose of agent movement. That's a possible interpretation.

So, given that, the initial state has:

- stone1 at pos32.

- pos32 is clear (i.e., no agent there).

- player1 is at pos35 (so pos35 is not clear).

Therefore, when the problem says "Location pos32 is clear", it means that the agent is not there. Stones don't affect the clear status. So the agent can move to a location with a stone, but that would make it not clear. Wait, but the preconditions for move say that the destination must be clear. So if a stone is at a location, is that location considered clear for the purpose of moving? The problem statement says "each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So a location can have agent, stone, or be empty. So if a stone is present, the location is not empty, but the agent can move there only if it's clear (i.e., no agent or stone?). No, that can't be. Because then the preconditions for "move" require the destination to be clear, which would mean that the destination has no agent or stone. But in the initial state, pos32 has a stone and is considered clear. So that suggests that "clear" only refers to the agent's absence. So a location is clear if the agent is not there, regardless of stones. Therefore, a location with a stone is considered clear for the purpose of the agent moving there, but when the agent is there, it's not clear. That's the only way the initial state makes sense.

Therefore, in the initial state, pos32 has a stone and is clear (no agent), so the agent can move there. But when the agent moves to pos32, pos32 becomes not clear. The stone remains, but now the agent is there. But according to the problem's description, each location can have either the agent, a stone, or be empty. So how can a location have both agent and stone? That contradicts the problem statement. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps "clear" means that neither the agent nor a stone is present. So a location is clear if it's empty. Then, if a stone is there, it's not clear. But in the initial state, it's stated that "Location pos32 is clear" and "stone1 is at location pos32". That's a contradiction. Therefore, the problem statement has an error. But given that it's part of the user's input, perhaps I need to proceed under the assumption that "clear" refers only to the agent's presence. That is, a location is clear if the agent is not there, regardless of stones. Thus, the stone's presence doesn't affect the clear status. So in the initial state, pos32 is clear (no agent) even though there's a stone. Then, when the agent moves to pos32, it becomes not clear. This seems to be the only way to reconcile the initial state's description.

This is critical for planning. So, in this interpretation, stones don't block movement. The agent can move to a location with a stone, but the action's preconditions require the destination to be clear (i.e., no agent there). Wait, no. Because according to the preconditions for "move", the destination must be clear. If clear means no agent, then the agent can move to a location with a stone as long as there's no agent there. But according to the problem statement, each position can contain either agent, stone, or be empty. So a location can't have both agent and stone. Therefore, if a stone is at a location, the agent can't be there, so the location is not clear (since it's occupied by the stone). But the initial state says pos32 is clear even though the stone is there. Therefore, there's a contradiction. This suggests that the problem statement is incorrect, but as a solver, I have to proceed with the given information.

Given this confusion, perhaps the correct way is to assume that "clear" means that the location is empty (no agent, no stone). Therefore, the initial state's assertion that pos32 is clear and has a stone is a mistake, but perhaps it's intended that the stone is at pos32 and pos32 is not clear. However, the user provided "Location pos32 is clear" in the initial state. This is conflicting. This makes the problem impossible because you can't have a stone and a clear location. Therefore, I must assume that there's a mistake and that pos32 is not clear in the initial state. But since the user explicitly included "Location pos32 is clear", I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the stone is at pos32, but pos32 is clear because "clear" refers to the agent's absence. So even if a stone is present, the location is considered clear for movement purposes. Therefore, the agent can move to pos32 even if there's a stone there. But according to the problem statement, each position can contain either agent, stone, or be empty. Therefore, moving to a location with a stone is impossible. Hence, this is a contradiction. 

This is a major issue. Given that, perhaps the correct initial state is that pos32 is not clear (due to the stone), and the user made a typo. But since I have to work with the given data, I'll proceed under the assumption that "clear" only refers to the agent's presence. So a location is clear if the agent is not there, regardless of stones. Thus, in the initial state, pos32 is clear (agent not there), even though there's a stone. Then, the agent can move to pos32, but according to the problem's own description, each location can have either agent, stone, or empty. So this is a contradiction. Therefore, this must be an error, but I'll proceed.

Assuming that "clear" means the agent is not present, and stones can coexist with the agent (which contradicts the problem statement), but that's the only way to make sense of the initial state. Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement's initial state is correct in that pos32 has the stone and is clear, which would imply that stones don't affect the clear status, and the agent can be in the same location as a stone. But that contradicts the problem's own definition. 

This is a critical issue. Without resolving this, I can't proceed. Since the user provided the problem, perhaps the intended meaning is that "clear" means no agent is present, and stones are allowed. Therefore, the agent can move to a location with a stone, pushing it. But according to the problem statement, the agent can only push a stone if it is adjacent in the direction of the push. So pushing requires the agent to be in a position adjacent to the stone, then moving into the stone's position while pushing it to the next cell. But according to the problem's own action definitions, for example, the "pushtogoal" action requires the agent to be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (stone's current location) in direction d. Then the stone moves from l_from to l_to in direction d. So the agent must be in a position that allows them to push the stone in a direction. 

Given all that, perhaps the agent can't be in the same cell as the stone. So the initial state's pos32 having the stone and being clear is correct, meaning that the agent is not there. Therefore, when the agent moves to pos32, it's possible only if pos32 is clear (no agent there). But the stone being there doesn't block the agent. But according to the problem's own description, each cell can have only agent, stone, or empty. Therefore, this is impossible. 

This is a major problem. I think the best approach is to proceed under the assumption that the initial state has a mistake, and pos32 is not clear (since the stone is there), and ignore the "Location pos32 is clear" statement. Otherwise, the problem is unsolvable. Alternatively, perhaps "clear" refers to the stone's absence, and the agent can be present. But that contradicts other parts. 

Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that the initial state has a typo and pos32 is not clear, and the stone is there. Therefore, the agent needs to navigate around to push the stone.

But given the time, let's proceed to create a plan that satisfies all constraints, assuming that the agent can move to adjacent cells and push the stone accordingly.

So, the agent starts at pos35 (row3, column5). The stone is at pos32 (row3, column2). The goal is to get the stone to pos15 (row1, column5), which is a goal location.

The agent needs to move to positions where they can push the stone towards pos15, passing through pos14 as required.

First, the agent needs to reach a position where they can push the stone. Let's see:

From pos35, the agent can move dirup (which decreases row by 1?) Wait, directions are a bit confusing. Let's re-express the directions based on the movement examples.

For example, from pos35 (row3, column5), moving dirup would take the agent to pos34 (row3, column4) because in the movement list, "You may move from location pos35 to location pos34 following direction dirup". So dirup from pos35 is to pos34 (same row, column decreases by 1). Similarly, dirright from pos35 is to pos45 (row4, column5). Dirdown from pos35 is to pos36, but pos36 doesn't exist. Wait, the grid goes up to pos55. So pos35's movements:

- dirup: pos34 (row3, column4)

- dirright: pos45 (row4, column5)

- dirleft: pos25 (row2, column5)

Wait, looking at the movement list for pos35:

"You may move from location pos35 to location pos25 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos35 to location pos45 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos35 to location pos34 following direction dirup"

So dirleft from pos35 is to pos25 (row2, column5), dirright to pos45 (row4, column5), dirup to pos34 (row3, column4), and no dirdown.

So directions are:

- dirleft: move up a row (row decreases by 1)

- dirright: move down a row (row increases by 1)

- dirup: move left in column (column decreases by 1)

- dirdown: move right in column (column increases by 1)

So, for example:

From pos22 (row2, column2), dirright takes to pos32 (row3, column2), dirleft to pos12 (row1, column2), dirup to pos21 (row2, column1), dirdown to pos23 (row2, column3).

This is important for planning.

The agent is at pos35 (row3, column5). The stone is at pos32 (row3, column2). The agent needs to get to a position where they can push the stone.

Possible path:

Agent moves from pos35 to pos34 (dirup), then to pos33 (dirup), then to pos32 (dirup). But pos32 has the stone. However, according to the problem's initial state, pos32 is clear (agent not there). But if the stone is there, then moving to pos32 would require it to be clear. But the stone is there, making it not clear. So agent can't move there. Therefore, agent must find a way to push the stone from a distance.

Alternatively, agent needs to get to a position adjacent to the stone in a direction that allows pushing.

For example, the stone is at pos32 (row3, column2). The agent can be at pos31 (row3, column1), pos22 (row2, column2), pos33 (row3, column3), or pos42 (row4, column2) to push the stone.

Let's see:

To push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft), the agent must be at pos32's dirleft, which is pos22. Wait, no. According to the action's preconditions for "pushtogoal" or "pushtonongoal", the agent must be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (stone's current location) in direction d. So for example, to push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft), the agent must be at pos32's direction dirleft. Looking at the movement from pos22 to pos32 via dirright. So pos22's dirright is pos32. Therefore, to push the stone from pos32 to pos22, the agent must be at pos22 and push in dirleft (opposite of dirright?), but this is confusing.

Alternatively, for the "pushtogoal" action, the agent is at l_p (pos22), direction d is dirright, leading to l_from (pos32). Then, the stone is pushed from l_from (pos32) in the same direction dirright to l_to (pos42). So the direction for pushing is the same as the direction from l_p to l_from. So the stone is pushed further in that direction.

Wait, the action's direction d is the direction from l_p to l_from, and then from l_from to l_to. So the stone moves in the same direction. So if the agent is at pos22 and pushes the stone at pos32 via dirright (since pos22 to pos32 is dirright), then the stone would move from pos32 to pos42 (dirright from pos32). 

But pos42 is a non-goal, so that's a pushtonongoal action. But the goal is to get the stone to pos15. 

Alternatively, the agent can push the stone upwards. For example, agent at pos31 (row3, column1), which can move dirright to pos32. So direction d is dirright. Then pushing the stone from pos32 to pos33 (dirright from pos32). But pos33 is a non-goal. So that's a pushtonongoal action.

Hmm. Alternatively, agent moves to pos33 (row3, column3), which is east of pos32. Wait, pos32 is row3, column2. To push the stone west (dirleft), the agent needs to be east of the stone. So agent at pos33 (column3), pushing the stone west to pos32's west, which is pos31 (row3, column1). But the stone is already at pos32. So this would move it to pos31. But that's a non-goal location.

Alternatively, agent could push the stone north. To do that, the agent needs to be south of the stone. For example, agent at pos42 (row4, column2), which is south of pos32. Then, direction d would be dirup from pos42 to pos32. Then pushing the stone dirup from pos32 to pos22 (row2, column2). pos22 is a non-goal, so pushtonongoal.

This could be a step towards the goal. Let's say:

1. Agent moves from pos35 to pos34 (dirup), then to pos33 (dirup), then to pos32? But pos32 has the stone. Can't move there. So instead, agent needs to go around.

Alternative route: agent goes from pos35 → pos25 (dirleft), then to pos24 (dirup), etc. But this might take too long.

Alternatively, agent moves south to pos45 (dirright from pos35), then to pos44 (dirup), etc. Not sure.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline a possible path considering all constraints.

Constraints to satisfy:

- Stone1 must be at pos14 at least once.

- When stone1 is at pos14, agent must be at pos41 (row4, column1) either then or after.

- At least one state must have pos23 not clear or stone1 at pos31.

- pos13 must be not clear at least once.

- If pos13 is not clear, then earlier state with pos51 or pos24 not clear.

- pos22, pos11, pos13, pos42 not clear can't be in more than one continuous sequence.

Let's try to structure the plan to hit these constraints.

First, the stone needs to go to pos14. So path from pos32 → ... → pos14 → pos15.

To get to pos14 from pos32, possible path:

pos32 → pos33 → pos34 → pos35 → pos25 → pos15. But that doesn't go through pos14. Alternatively, pos32 → pos22 → pos23 → pos24 → pos14 → pos15.

But how to push the stone from pos32 to pos22? Agent needs to be at pos22 and push dirright to pos32, then further to pos42. That's not helpful. Alternatively, agent is at pos31 (row3, column1) and pushes the stone dirright to pos32 → pos33. Then from pos33, agent at pos43 (row4, column3) pushes dirup to pos33 → pos34. Not sure.

Alternatively, agent moves to pos42 (row4, column2), pushes the stone dirup to pos32 → pos22. Then from pos22, agent pushes it to pos23, pos24, pos14, etc.

Let's attempt:

1. Agent moves from pos35 to pos34 (dirup).

2. Then to pos33 (dirup).

3. Then to pos32 (dirup). But pos32 has the stone, so can't move there. So instead, agent needs to go around.

Alternative route: agent moves from pos35 → pos25 (dirleft), then pos24 (dirup), pos23 (dirup), pos22 (dirup), pos21 (dirup), etc. But that's time-consuming.

Alternatively, agent moves south to pos45 (dirright from pos35), then to pos44 (dirup), pos43 (dirup), pos42 (dirup), pos41 (dirup), etc.

But agent needs to get to a position to push the stone.

Alternatively, agent moves to pos32's south, pos42. So:

1. Agent moves from pos35 to pos45 (dirright).

2. Then to pos44 (dirup).

3. Then to pos43 (dirup).

4. Then to pos42 (dirup). Now at pos42 (row4, column2).

From here, the agent can push the stone at pos32 (row3, column2) by moving dirup (which from pos42 is to pos32). So action pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup. Because pos22 is a non-goal.

This action would move the stone from pos32 to pos22. Then, the agent is now at pos32.

But after pushing, the agent moves to pos32. So pos32 is now not clear.

Now, stone1 is at pos22.

Next, the agent needs to push the stone from pos22 to pos23. To do that, the agent needs to be at pos22's adjacent position in the direction of the push. For example, pushing the stone to pos23 (east) would require the agent to be at pos22's west (pos21) or south (pos23's north?), but directions are confusing.

Wait, to push the stone from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown, since pos22 to pos23 is dirdown), the agent must be at pos22's dirdown direction. Wait, no. The agent needs to be in a position adjacent to pos22 in the direction of the push. The direction d is the direction from the agent's current position to the stone's current position (pos22). Then, the stone is pushed in the same direction to the next cell.

So to push the stone from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown, which is east), the agent must be at a position from which they can move to pos22 via dirdown. So for example, the agent is at pos23 (row2, column3), and direction dirdown from pos23 to pos22. Then pushing the stone from pos22 to pos21 (dirup). No, that's the opposite direction.

Alternatively, the agent is at pos21 (row2, column1), and direction dirright to pos22. Then pushing the stone dirright to pos23. That's possible.

So:

After stone1 is at pos22, the agent is at pos32. To push it to pos23, the agent needs to move to pos23's west, which is pos22's east. Wait, this is getting too confusing.

Alternative approach: For the stone at pos22, to push it to pos23 (east), the agent needs to be at pos22's west (pos21), push east to pos22, then east to pos23. So action pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirright. But for this, the agent must be at pos21.

But the agent is currently at pos32 after pushing to pos22. So the agent needs to move from pos32 to pos21.

Path from pos32 to pos21:

pos32 → pos22 (dirup), pos21 (dirup). So:

5. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup

But pos32 is currently occupied by the agent. After pushing, the agent is at pos32. Then moving to pos22 (dirup from pos32 is pos22). So yes.

So after step 4 (pushtonongoal to pos22), agent is at pos32.

Then step 5: move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup. But pos22 has the stone now. So pos22 is not clear, so can't move there. Therefore, this is not possible.

Hmm. So after pushing the stone to pos22, the agent is at pos32. To push the stone from pos22 to pos23, the agent needs to be at pos22's adjacent cell in the direction of the push. For example, to push east to pos23, the agent needs to be west of pos22 (pos21), then push east. So the agent needs to move from pos32 to pos21.

Path from pos32 to pos21:

pos32 → pos31 (dirleft), pos21 (dirup). Let's see:

From pos32, movement options:

- dirleft: pos31 (row3, column1)

- dirright: pos42 (row4, column2)

- dirup: pos22 (row2, column2)

- dirdown: pos33 (row3, column3)

But pos22 has the stone, so moving dirup to pos22 is blocked. So agent can move dirleft to pos31.

Step 5: move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft.

Step 6: move player1 pos31 pos21 dirup.

Now agent is at pos21. From here, can push stone1 from pos22 to pos23 via dirright.

Step 7: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirright.

This moves the stone from pos22 to pos23. The agent is now at pos22.

Now stone1 is at pos23. This satisfies one of the constraints (either pos23 not clear or stone1 at pos31). Since stone1 is at pos23, which is not clear (agent is at pos22), but the constraint requires at least one state where pos23 is not clear or stone1 at pos31. So this step satisfies that constraint.

Next, the stone needs to move to pos24, then to pos14, then to pos15.

To push from pos23 to pos24 (east), agent needs to be at pos23's west (pos22), push east. Agent is currently at pos22. So step 8: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown (since from pos23, dirdown is to pos24). Wait, no. From pos23, dirdown is to pos24 (row2, column4). So to push east, direction would be dirdown? Because from pos23, dirdown is to pos24 (column increases by 1). So yes.

Step 8: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown.

Now stone1 is at pos24. Agent is at pos23.

Next, push from pos24 to pos14. pos24 is row2, column4. To push north (dirleft) to pos14 (row1, column4), agent needs to be south of pos24 (pos34), push dirup. Or east/west?

Alternatively, to push from pos24 to pos14 (dirleft, since pos24 to pos14 is dirleft), the agent needs to be at pos24's dirleft, which is pos14. Wait, no. The agent must be in a position that can reach pos24 via direction d. So if the agent is at pos34 (row3, column4), and direction dirup to pos24. Then push the stone from pos24 to pos14 (dirup from pos24). So action pushtogoal (since pos14 is not a goal, but wait, pos14 is not a goal. Wait, no, the goal location is pos15. So pushing to pos14 would be a pushtonongoal action.

But we need to have stone1 at pos14 at least once. So this is necessary.

So agent needs to move from pos23 to pos34 to be able to push pos24 to pos14.

Path from pos23 to pos34:

pos23 → pos24 (dirdown), but stone1 is at pos24. So blocked.

Alternative path: pos23 → pos33 (dirright), pos34 (dirdown). Let's see:

Step 9: move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright.

Step 10: move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown.

Now at pos34 (row3, column4). From here, can push stone1 from pos24 to pos14 via dirup.

Step 11: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos14 dirup.

Now stone1 is at pos14. Agent is at pos24. This satisfies the constraint that stone1 is at pos14 at least once. Now, the agent needs to be at pos41 either now or after. So agent needs to reach pos41.

Current position is pos24. To get to pos41 (row4, column1):

Path: pos24 → pos34 (dirright), pos44 (dirright), pos43 (dirup), pos42 (dirup), pos41 (dirup).

But this is time-consuming. Alternatively:

From pos24, agent can move dirright to pos34 (row3, column4 → pos34's dirright is pos44 (row4, column4). Then from pos44, move dirup to pos43 (row4, column3), then dirleft to pos42 (row4, column2), then dirleft to pos41 (row4, column1).

But this requires several moves.

Alternatively, after pushing to pos14, the agent is at pos24. They need to get to pos41. Let's see:

Step 12: move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright.

Step 13: move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright.

Step 14: move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup.

Step 15: move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup.

Step 16: move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup.

Now agent is at pos41. This satisfies the constraint that when stone1 is at pos14, the agent is at pos41 at some state after. Since step 11 has stone1 at pos14 and step 16 agent is at pos41.

Next, the stone is at pos14. Need to push it to pos15. pos14 to pos15 is dirdown (east). So agent needs to be west of pos14 (pos13) and push east. But pos13 is currently clear. So agent needs to move to pos13.

Path from pos41 to pos13:

pos41 → pos31 (dirleft), pos21 (dirup), pos11 (dirleft), pos12 (dirdown), pos13 (dirdown). That's a long path. But let's see:

Step 17: move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft.

Step 18: move player1 pos31 pos21 dirup.

Step 19: move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft.

Step 20: move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown.

Step 21: move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown.

Now agent is at pos13. From here, can push stone1 from pos14 to pos15 via dirdown.

Step 22: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown.

Now stone1 is at pos15, which is a goal location. This achieves the main goal.

Now, check constraints:

- pos13 must be not clear at least once. Agent is at pos13 in step 21 and 22, so pos13 is not clear then. Satisfied.

- If pos13 is not clear, there must be a prior state with pos51 or pos24 not clear. pos24 was not clear when stone1 was there (steps 8-11), so this is satisfied.

- pos22 was not clear when stone1 was there (steps 4-7), and it's a single continuous sequence. Since pos22 was not clear only during those steps, it's one continuous sequence. Satisfied.

- pos13 not clear in steps 21-22, which is one sequence.

- pos42 not clear: agent was at pos42 in step 15. But need to check if it's in more than one sequence. If agent moves through pos42 once, it's one sequence.

- The constraint requiring at least one state where pos23 is not clear or stone1 at pos31. Stone1 was at pos23 in step 7-8, so pos23 was not clear. Satisfied.

- The constraint that if pos13 is not clear, there's a prior state with pos51 or pos24 not clear. pos24 was not clear when stone1 was there (steps 8-11), which is before pos13 not clear (steps 21-22). Satisfied.

- The constraint that stone1 is at pos14 at least once: step 11.

- When stone1 is at pos14 (step 11), agent must be at pos41 either then or after. Agent reaches pos41 in step 16, which is after. Satisfied.

This plan seems to satisfy all constraints. Now, let's count the steps and see if it's optimal.

The steps are:

1. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright

2. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup

3. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

4. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup

6. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft

7. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirup

8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirright

9. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirright

10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos14 dirdown

11. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright

12. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

13. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

14. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup

15. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup

16. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft

17. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirup

18. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft

19. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown

20. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown

21. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown

This is 21 steps. However, this seems too long. Maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternative approach: After pushing the stone to pos14, the agent needs to get to pos41. Instead of moving all the way from pos24 to pos41, maybe find a shorter path.

After step 11, agent is at pos24. From pos24, can they move to pos34 (dirright), then to pos44 (dirright), pos43 (dirup), pos42 (dirup), pos41 (dirup). That's 5 steps. 

Alternatively, after step 11, agent is at pos24. To reach pos41, perhaps:

pos24 → pos34 (dirright), pos44 (dirright), pos43 (dirup), pos42 (dirup), pos41 (dirup). Steps 12-16.

But maybe there's a faster way. For example, from pos24, move dirright to pos34 (step 12), then dirright to pos44 (step13), dirup to pos43 (step14), dirup to pos42 (step15), dirup to pos41 (step16). That's 5 steps. But perhaps there's a more efficient path.

Alternatively, after step 11 (stone at pos14, agent at pos24), agent can move directly to pos34 (step12), pos44 (step13), then pos43 (step14), pos42 (step15), pos41 (step16). Then steps 17-21 to get to pos13. 

But perhaps there's a way to push the stone to pos15 directly from pos14 without the agent having to go all the way around.

Wait, after stone1 is at pos14 (step11), the agent is at pos24. To push it to pos15, the agent needs to be at pos14's west (pos13) and push east (dirdown) to pos15. But pos13 is clear. So agent needs to reach pos13. But how?

Instead of going all the way to pos41 then back, maybe agent can move from pos24 to pos14 (but pos14 has the stone). No, can't move there. So agent needs to go around.

Alternative path from pos24 to pos13:

pos24 → pos23 (dirup), pos13 (dirleft). But how?

From pos24, move dirup to pos23 (step12), then dirleft to pos13 (dirleft?). Let's check movement options:

From pos24, movement options include dirup to pos23, dirright to pos34, dirleft to pos14 (but pos14 has the stone), and dirdown to pos25.

So step12: move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup.

Now at pos23. From here, can move dirleft to pos13?

From pos23, movement options include dirleft to pos13 (dirup?), or other directions. Let's check:

"You may move from location pos23 to pos13 following direction dirleft".

Yes. So step13: move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft.

Now agent is at pos13. Then step14: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown.

This is shorter. So revised steps:

Steps 1-11 as before.

Step 11: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos14 dirup.

Agent is now at pos24.

Step12: move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup.

Step13: move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft.

Step14: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown.

This reduces steps from 21 to 14. Now, need to check if this path satisfies all constraints.

But also, after step11, agent is at pos24. Then steps 12 and13 to get to pos13. Then push to pos15.

Now, constraint that when stone1 is at pos14, agent must be at pos41 either then or after. In this revised plan, when stone1 is at pos14 (step11), the agent is at pos24. Then, the agent moves to pos23 and pos13, and pushes to pos15. The agent never goes to pos41, so this violates the constraint. Therefore, this approach is invalid.

So the agent must reach pos41 at some point after stone1 is at pos14. Therefore, the original longer path is necessary.

Alternatively, after pushing to pos14 (step11), the agent could move to pos41 before pushing to pos15. Let's see:

After step11, stone1 is at pos14, agent at pos24.

Agent needs to reach pos41:

pos24 → pos34 (dirright), pos44 (dirright), pos43 (dirup), pos42 (dirup), pos41 (dirup). Steps 12-16.

Then, agent is at pos41 (step16). Now, to push the stone from pos14 to pos15, agent needs to move to pos13. How?

From pos41:

pos41 → pos31 (dirleft), pos21 (dirup), pos11 (dirleft), pos12 (dirdown), pos13 (dirdown). Steps17-21.

Then step22: push.

This is necessary to satisfy the constraint that agent is at pos41 after stone1 is at pos14.

Thus, the original long path is required.

But this results in a very long plan. Is there a more optimal way?

Alternatively, perhaps during the journey, the agent can satisfy the pos51 or pos24 not clear condition for the pos13 constraint.

Wait, the constraint that if pos13 is not clear, there must be a prior state where pos51 or pos24 is not clear. In the current plan, pos24 is not clear when the stone is there (steps8-11). So that satisfies the condition. Therefore, when the agent is at pos13 (step21), pos24 was not clear earlier. Thus, the constraint is satisfied.

But perhaps there's a way to have pos51 not clear. For example, agent moves to pos51 at some point. But that's out of the way.

Alternatively, during the agent's movement, they can pass through pos51. But pos51 is row5, column1. The agent starts at pos35 (row3, column5). To get to pos51 would require a long detour. Not optimal.

Thus, the original plan is necessary.

But the problem requires an optimal plan, i.e., the shortest possible. Maybe there's a shorter path.

Let me think differently. Perhaps the agent can push the stone from pos32 to pos33, then to pos34, pos35, pos25, pos15. But pos35 is where the agent starts. Let's see:

Agent starts at pos35. Stone at pos32.

Agent moves to pos34 (dirup), pos33 (dirup), pos32 (dirup) — but can't because stone is there. So instead, agent moves to pos45 (dirright), pos44 (dirup), pos43 (dirup), pos42 (dirup), then push stone from pos32 to pos33.

But this seems similar to the previous plan.

Alternatively, agent moves south to pos45, then west to pos44, pos43, pos42. From pos42, push stone from pos32 to pos33 (dirup). Then from pos33, push to pos34, etc. But this also requires many steps.

Alternatively, let's consider the constraints again. The stone must be at pos14, and when it is, agent must be at pos41. Also, pos13 must be blocked at least once, with prior pos24 or pos51 blocked.

Perhaps there's a way to have the stone go through pos14 without the agent having to go all the way to pos41. But the constraint requires that when the stone is at pos14, the agent is at pos41 either then or after. So the agent can reach pos41 after pushing to pos14.

So after pushing to pos14, the agent must go to pos41.

So, after step11 (stone at pos14, agent at pos24), agent moves to pos34 → pos44 → pos43 → pos42 → pos41 (steps12-16). Then, agent must go back to push the stone from pos14 to pos15. To do that, agent needs to reach pos13.

From pos41, agent moves to pos31 → pos21 → pos11 → pos12 → pos13 (steps17-21), then pushes.

This is necessary.

But this makes the plan long. Is there a shorter path?

Wait, after agent is at pos41 (step16), can they move directly to pos13 via a different route? For example, pos41 → pos42 (dirright), pos43 (dirright), pos44 (dirright), pos45 (dirright), but that's not helpful. Alternatively, pos41 → pos31 (dirleft), pos32 (dirright), but pos32 is clear? No, after pushing the stone to pos22, pos32 is clear again.

Alternatively, pos41 → pos31 (dirleft), pos32 (dirright), pos33 (dirright), pos34 (dirright), pos35 (dirright), pos25 (dirleft), pos24 (dirup), pos23 (dirup), pos13 (dirleft). That's a long way.

This seems unavoidable. Therefore, the original plan of 21 steps may be necessary, but perhaps there's a more optimal way.

Alternatively, when the agent is at pos41 (step16), instead of going back through pos31, pos21, etc., maybe there's a different path to pos13.

From pos41, possible movements:

pos41 can move to pos31 (dirleft), pos51 (dirright), pos42 (dirdown).

pos41 → pos42 (dirdown), then pos43 (dirdown), pos44 (dirdown), pos45 (dirdown), pos35 (dirleft), pos34 (dirup), pos33 (dirup), pos32 (dirup), pos22 (dirup), pos23 (dirdown), pos13 (dirleft). But this is longer.

No, it's better to go through pos31.

Thus, the original plan seems to be the shortest possible given the constraints.

But this seems very long. Maybe I missed a shorter path.

Alternative approach: Use the constraint that pos13 must be not clear, and satisfy that by having the agent pass through pos13, but also ensure that pos24 is not clear earlier.

If the agent can pass through pos13 once, that satisfies the pos13 not clear constraint. And pos24 was not clear when the stone was there.

Let's see:

If the agent pushes the stone from pos32 → pos33 → pos34 → pos35 → pos25 → pos15, but this skips pos14. But the constraint requires stone1 to be at pos14. So can't do that.

Thus, the stone must pass through pos14.

Another idea: after pushing the stone to pos14, the agent moves to pos41, then from pos41 to pos51, which is a non-clear location, thus satisfying the pos51 constraint for pos13.

But this might not be necessary.

Alternatively, when the agent is at pos41, they can move to pos51 to make pos51 not clear, which satisfies the constraint for pos13. Then, when pos13 is not clear (when agent is there), there's a prior state with pos51 not clear. This could work.

So revised plan:

After step16 (agent at pos41), agent moves to pos51.

Step17: move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright.

Now pos51 is not clear. Then, agent moves back to pos41 (step18), then to pos31 (step19), etc.

But this adds steps. Not sure if this is better.

Alternatively, if the agent goes to pos51 after stone1 is at pos14, then when pos13 is blocked (agent there), the prior state of pos51 not clear exists.

But this requires additional steps.

This is getting too complicated. Given the time, I'll proceed with the original plan, ensuring all constraints are met, even if it's long. However, I suspect there's a more optimal path.

Wait, perhaps the stone can be pushed from pos32 to pos33, then to pos34, pos35, pos25, pos15. But the constraint requires stone1 to be at pos14. So this path doesn't work. Therefore, pos14 is mandatory.

Another idea: agent pushes the stone from pos32 to pos33 (east), then to pos34, pos44, pos54, pos55. But pos55 is not a goal. No, the only goal is pos15.

Thus, the stone must go through pos14.

Given all this, the optimal plan likely involves the steps outlined earlier. Therefore, I'll write the plan as per the steps I outlined, ensuring all constraints are met.
