Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. First, I need to understand the initial state and the goal. The agent (player1) is at pos13, and the stone (stone1) is at pos34. The goal is to have stone1 at a goal location. From the problem description, the only goal location mentioned is pos51. Wait, looking back: "pos51 is a goal location", and all others are not. So the stone needs to end up at pos51.

But wait, the task says "stone1 is at a goal location". So any goal location is okay. But according to the initial state, the only goal location is pos51. All other positions like pos52, pos53, etc., are not goals. So the stone must be moved to pos51.

Now, the constraints. Let's list them:

1. pos55 must always be clear.
2. pos54 can be non-clear in at most one continuous sequence.
3. stone1 must be at pos44 in at least one state.
4. If stone1 is at pos44, then before that, either player1 is at pos54 or pos25 is not clear.
5. At least one state where player1 is at pos21 and pos31 is not clear.
6. pos52 must always be clear.
7. pos53 can be non-clear in at most one continuous sequence.
8. At least one state where pos33 is not clear.

So, I need to plan a path that moves the stone from pos34 to pos51, while satisfying all these constraints.

First, let's think about moving the stone. Since the stone is at pos34, and the goal is pos51. The grid is 5x5, with rows 1-5 and columns 1-5. pos51 is row5, column1. So from pos34 (row3, column4) to pos51 (row5, column1). That's a diagonal move, but stones can only be pushed in directions allowed by the movement actions.

Looking at the movement possibilities. The agent can move in directions dirup, dirdown, dirleft, dirright. To push a stone, the agent needs to be adjacent to it and push in the direction towards the stone's next location.

Let's map the possible path for the stone. From pos34, possible pushes:

- To pos44 (right from pos34, direction dirright, but pos44 is not a goal. But the action could be pushtonongoal. Wait, but the final goal is to have the stone at pos51. So maybe we need to push the stone towards pos51 via certain steps.

Alternatively, maybe push the stone left to pos33, then down, etc. But need to check the movement allowed between locations.

Wait, the movement connections are given. For example, from pos34, you can move to pos24 (dirleft), pos44 (dirright), pos33 (dirup), pos35 (dirdown). So pushing the stone would require the agent to be in an adjacent position.

Let me think about the path from pos34 to pos51. Let's see:

pos34 -> pos44 (dirright) requires agent to be at pos34's left (pos24) to push right. But pos44 is a non-goal. Then from pos44, maybe push left to pos34 again? Not helpful. Alternatively, pos34 can be pushed up to pos33 (dirup) if the agent is at pos34's down (pos44? Wait, no. Wait, the direction is from where the agent is pushing. For example, to push a stone from l_from to l_to, the agent must be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from, and the direction from l_p to l_from is d. Then the stone moves from l_from to l_to, which is in direction d from l_from.

Wait, the 'pushtogoal' and 'pushtonongoal' actions require that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (stone's current location) in direction d. Then the stone moves from l_from to l_to, which is in direction d from l_from. So the agent is pushing the stone from l_p to l_from (i.e., moving into the stone's position, which pushes the stone to l_to).

Wait, the preconditions for pushtogoal: agent p is at l_p, stone s is at l_from. The direction d allows moving from l_p to l_from (so l_p is adjacent to l_from in direction d). Then the direction d must also allow moving from l_from to l_to. So the stone is being pushed from l_from to l_to, which is in the same direction as the agent's movement into l_from. So, for example, if the agent is to the left of the stone (l_p is pos24, l_from is pos34, direction dirright (from pos24 to pos34)), then pushing the stone would move it to pos44 (dirright from l_from).

So to push the stone from pos34 to pos44, the agent needs to be at pos34's left (pos24) and push right. Similarly, to push the stone from pos34 to pos24, the agent would need to be at pos34's right (pos44) and push left, but pos44 is clear initially. Wait, initial state: pos34 is clear? Wait, the initial state says "Location pos34 is clear" but the stone1 is at pos34. Wait, no. Wait the initial state lists "stone1 is at location pos34" and then "Location pos34 is clear". That seems contradictory. Wait, no. Because "clear" in this context probably means that there's no agent or stone present. But if the stone is at pos34, then pos34 is not clear. So maybe there's a mistake here.

Wait, looking back at the original state:

"Original state of the world":

- "stone1 is at location pos34"

- "Location pos34 is clear"

Wait, that can't be. If the stone is at pos34, then pos34 is not clear. So this is a contradiction. Unless "clear" refers to something else. Wait, maybe "clear" means that the agent is not there. Because the initial state says "player1 is at pos13", so pos13 is not clear. But then, if a location has a stone, is it considered clear or not?

Looking at the effects of the actions: For example, after a move action, the agent leaves l_from (making it clear) and occupies l_to (making it not clear). Similarly, when pushing a stone, the stone moves from l_from to l_to, so l_from becomes clear (if nothing else is there) and l_to becomes occupied. So "clear" refers to the presence of agent or stone. So if a stone is at a location, it's not clear. So in the initial state, pos34 is not clear because stone1 is there. But the original state says "Location pos34 is clear". That must be a mistake. But according to the problem statement, we have to take the original state as given. So perhaps there's an error here. But the user provided the problem, so we have to work with that.

Wait, let's check again:

Original state:

- "player1 is at location pos13"

- "stone1 is at location pos34"

Then, under "Location pos34 is clear" â€” that's conflicting. Unless "clear" here is a separate property that's not related to the presence of stones or agents. But that's not how the effects are described. For example, the move action's effect is that the agent is no longer at l_from (so l_from becomes clear) and the agent is at l_to (so l_to is not clear. So if a stone is at a location, the location is not clear. So the initial state has a contradiction. But according to the problem statement, we have to accept the given initial state. So maybe in this domain, a location can be clear even if a stone is there. Wait, that can't be. Because the preconditions for pushing require that the stone is at l_from, which would mean that l_from is not clear. So this must be an error in the problem statement. However, since the user provided this, perhaps we have to proceed under the assumption that in the initial state, pos34 is clear despite the stone being there. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the "clear" in the original state refers to something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement has a typo. Maybe the stone is at pos33 or another location. But according to the given original state, "stone1 is at pos34" and "Location pos34 is clear". This is conflicting. But since the problem is given as such, perhaps we need to proceed, assuming that there's a mistake, but the actual initial state is that the stone is at pos34 and pos34 is not clear, but the user incorrectly listed it as clear. Or perhaps the "clear" in the original state refers to the agent's presence only. Wait, maybe "clear" means that there's no agent, but stones can be present. Let me check the action effects.

Looking at the "move" action's effects: after moving, l_from is clear (agent leaves), l_to is not clear (agent arrives). So "clear" refers to the presence of the agent. Then, stones are separate. So a location can have a stone and be considered clear (as long as the agent isn't there). That would make sense. So the "Location pos34 is clear" in the initial state means that the agent is not there, but the stone can be. So the stone's presence doesn't affect the "clear" status. Then, in the preconditions for pushing actions, the location l_to must be clear (i.e., no agent there), but the stone can be there? Wait, no. Because in the pushtogoal action's preconditions, (iii) location l_to is clear. If a stone is at l_to, then l_to is not clear. Because when you push a stone into l_to, you need l_to to be clear (no stones or agents). Because the effect is that the stone moves there, making it not clear. So in that case, "clear" means that neither agent nor stone is present. So the initial state has a contradiction. Therefore, this must be a mistake in the problem statement. However, since the problem is given as such, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that in the initial state, pos34 is clear (no agent or stone), but the stone is at pos34. That's impossible, so perhaps it's a typo and the stone is actually at a different location. Alternatively, maybe the "clear" in the original state refers to something else. This is a problem. But given that the user provided this, perhaps I should proceed, but note that there's a conflict. However, given that the problem is presented, perhaps the stone is at pos34 and pos34 is not clear, but the user mistakenly listed it as clear. Or maybe the "clear" in the original state is a separate flag, not related to the presence of stones or agents. But according to the action effects, when you push a stone to a location, that location becomes not clear. So the presence of a stone makes a location not clear. Therefore, the initial state is inconsistent. But since the problem is given, perhaps we have to proceed under the assumption that the initial state is correct as per the problem's description, even if it's conflicting. Alternatively, maybe "clear" refers to agent's presence only, and stones don't affect it. Let's check the action preconditions again.

Looking at the "pushtogoal" preconditions: (iii) location l_to is clear. If "clear" here means no agent is present, then the stone can be there. But that would allow pushing a stone into a location with another stone, which isn't possible. So probably "clear" means that neither agent nor stone is present. Therefore, the initial state's statement that "Location pos34 is clear" while stone1 is there is conflicting. Therefore, this must be an error. But since the problem is given, perhaps it's a typo, and the stone is at a different location. Alternatively, the "clear" in the original state is a mistake. But since the user provided this, perhaps we have to proceed with the given data, even if contradictory. Alternatively, maybe the stone is at pos34, and pos34 is not clear, but the user listed it as clear by mistake. But how to proceed?

This is a critical point because if the stone is at pos34 and pos34 is clear (i.e., no agent or stone), that's impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem statement. But given that, perhaps the correct initial state is that the stone is at pos34, and pos34 is not clear. The user might have mistakenly included "Location pos34 is clear" in the original state. So I need to proceed under that assumption, because otherwise the problem is unsolvable. So I'll proceed as if pos34 is not clear (since stone1 is there), and the "Location pos34 is clear" in the original state is a mistake.

So, stone1 is at pos34 (which is not a goal location), and the agent is at pos13. The goal is to move stone1 to a goal location (pos51). The constraints must be satisfied.

Now, the constraints:

1. pos55 must always be clear. So no agent or stone can ever be there. But pos55 is not a goal location, so the stone can't end up there. So the agent must never move to pos55.

2. pos54 can be non-clear in at most one continuous sequence. So the agent or stone can be at pos54 only once, and for consecutive steps.

3. stone1 must be at pos44 in at least one state. So during the plan, the stone must pass through pos44.

4. If stone1 is at pos44, then before that, either player1 is at pos54 or pos25 is not clear. So before pushing the stone to pos44, the agent must have been at pos54 in some prior state, or pos25 was occupied (by a stone or the agent) before.

5. At least one state where player1 is at pos21 and pos31 is not clear. So during the plan, there must be a state where the agent is at pos21, and pos31 has a stone or the agent.

6. pos52 must always be clear. So the agent or stone can never be at pos52.

7. pos53 can be non-clear in at most one continuous sequence. So pos53 can be occupied once, but not in multiple separate times.

8. At least one state where pos33 is not clear. So the agent or stone must be at pos33 at some point.

Now, the plan needs to move the stone from pos34 to pos51, passing through pos44 (constraint 3), and ensuring all other constraints.

Let's outline the steps.

First, the agent is at pos13. The stone is at pos34. To push the stone, the agent needs to get adjacent to it. From pos34's adjacent positions:

- pos24 (left), pos44 (right), pos33 (up), pos35 (down).

But initially, the agent is at pos13. So the agent needs to move to pos24, pos33, etc., to push the stone.

Let's think of a path for the agent to reach pos34's adjacent positions.

From pos13, possible moves:

Looking at the allowed moves from the original state:

From pos13, you can move to pos23 (dirright), pos12 (dirup), pos14 (dirdown).

So the agent can move down to pos14, then right to pos24, then right to pos34? Wait, can the agent move from pos24 to pos34? Let's check the allowed moves.

From pos24: the allowed moves are:

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos14 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos34 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos23 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos25 following direction dirdown"

So yes, from pos24, the agent can move right to pos34 (if it's clear). But pos34 has the stone, so pos34 is not clear (assuming the initial state is correct, even though the problem states it's clear). So the agent can't move into pos34 unless the stone is moved. So to push the stone, the agent must be adjacent to it.

Wait, the agent can't move into pos34 because the stone is there. So to push the stone from pos34 to another location, the agent must be in an adjacent position and push the stone.

So for example, if the agent is at pos24 (left of pos34), they can push the stone right to pos44. But pos44 is a non-goal location, so we'd use pushtonongoal. But the stone needs to eventually get to pos51, which is a goal location.

Alternatively, pushing the stone up to pos33 (from pos34's down position, which is pos44, but initially, pos44 is clear. Wait, pos44's status in the initial state: according to the original state, "Location pos44 is clear". So if the agent can get to pos44, they could push the stone up to pos34. But that's the stone's current location. Wait, perhaps the agent can push the stone from pos34 to pos33 by being at pos34's down (pos44) and pushing up. But pos44 is clear, so the agent can move there.

Wait, the agent's path to pos44: starting at pos13, move down to pos14, then right to pos24, then right to pos34 (but pos34 has the stone, so can't move there). Alternatively, from pos14, move right to pos24, then right to pos34 (but blocked). Alternatively, the agent can move down from pos13 to pos14, then down to pos15? Let's see the allowed moves.

From pos14, allowed moves: pos24 (right), pos13 (up), pos15 (down). So from pos14, moving right to pos24 is possible. Then from pos24, moving right to pos34 is blocked by the stone. So the agent can't get to pos34. So the agent needs to find another way to reach a position adjacent to the stone.

Another approach: from pos13, move right to pos23. From pos23, the allowed moves are pos13 (left), pos33 (right), pos22 (up), pos24 (down). So from pos23, moving right to pos33 (if clear). pos33 is clear initially (original state says "Location pos33 is clear"). So the agent can move to pos33. Then from pos33, can move down to pos34 (if clear). But pos34 has the stone, so it's not clear. So the agent can't move there. But from pos33, the agent can push the stone down to pos44.

Wait, the stone is at pos34. If the agent is at pos33 (which is above pos34), then the agent can push the stone down to pos44. Because:

For the action "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d", the agent is at l_p (pos33), stone is at l_from (pos34). The direction from l_p to l_from is dirdown. Then l_to is pos34's dirdown, which is pos44. So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos44 dirdown.

But pos44 is a non-goal location, so this action is allowed. After this, the stone moves to pos44, and the agent moves to pos34.

But wait, the effect of pushtonongoal is that the agent moves to l_from (pos34), which was previously occupied by the stone. But after pushing, the stone moves to pos44. So pos34 becomes clear, and the agent is now at pos34.

But after this action, pos44 will have the stone, and the agent is at pos34. Now, we need to move the stone towards pos51.

But first, this action would satisfy constraint 3 (stone1 is at pos44 at least once). Now, before this action, we have to satisfy constraint 4: if stone1 is at pos44, then earlier state must have player1 at pos54 or pos25 not clear. Wait, in this scenario, the agent is pushing the stone from pos34 to pos44. The prior state is agent at pos33. So before this action, the agent was at pos33. To satisfy constraint 4, we need either the agent was at pos54 before, or pos25 was not clear (i.e., had a stone or agent).

But in the initial state, pos25 is clear. So to satisfy constraint 4, before this push to pos44, we need to have either player1 at pos54 (which is far away) or make pos25 not clear. How can we make pos25 not clear? The agent could move to pos25, making it not clear. So maybe before pushing to pos44, the agent needs to go to pos25.

But that seems like a detour. Let's see:

Alternative plan: agent moves from pos13 to pos23, then to pos33. Then, before pushing the stone to pos44, the agent moves to pos25, which would make pos25 not clear, satisfying the condition for constraint 4. Then the agent returns to pos33 and pushes the stone.

But moving from pos33 to pos25 would require a long path. Let's see:

From pos33, possible moves: to pos23 (left), pos43 (right), pos32 (up), pos34 (down, but blocked by stone). So the agent can't go directly to pos25 from pos33. Let's see the path from pos33 to pos25.

pos33 â†’ pos23 (dirleft), then pos23 â†’ pos24 (dirdown), pos24 â†’ pos25 (dirdown). So agent can move from pos33 to pos23, then pos24, then pos25. Then pos25 is not clear (agent is there). Then agent needs to return to pos33 to push the stone.

But this would take several steps. However, the constraint 4 requires that if the stone is at pos44, then there must be a prior state where either the agent was at pos54 or pos25 was not clear. So if we have the agent move to pos25 before pushing the stone to pos44, then in that prior state, pos25 is not clear, satisfying the condition.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can move to pos54, but pos54 must be kept clear except for one continuous sequence (constraint 2 and 7). Wait, pos54 is part of the constraints. Let's check:

Constraint 2: pos54 can be non-clear in at most one continuous sequence. So if the agent moves to pos54, that's a non-clear state, and it has to be in one continuous period. But pos54 is not a goal, and the stone can't be there (since the goal is pos51). So perhaps the agent can visit pos54 once, making it non-clear, and then leave, but only once.

But moving the agent to pos54 would require a long path. Let's see the path to pos54.

From pos13, moving down to pos14, right to pos24, right to pos34 (but blocked by stone). Alternatively, from pos13, right to pos23, down to pos24, right to pos34 (blocked). Alternatively, the agent can move right to pos23, then right to pos33 (if clear), then right to pos43 (if allowed).

From pos33, can move right to pos43 (dirright). From pos43, can move right to pos53 (dirright). But pos53 is not a goal, and we have constraint 7: pos53 can be non-clear in at most one continuous sequence. Also, pos52 must always be clear (constraint 6). So the agent can't go through pos52. So from pos43, moving right to pos53 is allowed. Then from pos53, down to pos54 (dirdown). Then pos54 is non-clear. But constraint 2 says pos54 can be non-clear in at most one continuous sequence. So if the agent goes to pos54, stays there for some steps, then leaves, that's allowed as long as it's a single continuous period.

But getting to pos54 would take many steps. Let's see:

Agent path: pos13 â†’ pos23 (dirright), pos23 â†’ pos33 (dirright), pos33 â†’ pos43 (dirright), pos43 â†’ pos53 (dirright), pos53 â†’ pos54 (dirdown). That's a long way. Then, once at pos54, the agent can push the stone from pos44 to pos54 (if possible), but the stone is at pos44, and pos54 is a non-goal. Then the stone would need to move to pos54, but that's not helpful for the goal. Alternatively, the agent could then push the stone from pos44 to pos54, but that's moving away from the goal.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can push the stone from pos34 to pos44 (using the earlier plan), but before that, ensure that the agent visited pos25 or pos54.

But this is getting complicated. Let's try to find a minimal path that satisfies all constraints.

Another approach: the stone needs to go to pos51. The optimal path would be pushing it from pos34 â†’ pos44 â†’ pos54 â†’ pos55 â†’ pos54 â†’ pos53 â†’ pos52 â†’ pos51. But pos55 must always be clear (constraint 1), so the stone can't go to pos55. Also, pos52 must always be clear (constraint 6), so the stone can't go there. So that path is invalid.

Alternative path: pos34 â†’ pos44 â†’ pos43 â†’ pos42 â†’ pos41 â†’ pos51. But pos44 is required (constraint 3), then from pos44, the stone can be pushed left to pos43 (non-goal), then left to pos42 (non-goal), left to pos41 (non-goal), then right to pos51 (goal). But pos41 is clear initially. So the agent can push the stone from pos44 to pos43, then to pos42, then to pos41, then to pos51.

But let's check if that's possible. From pos44, the stone can be pushed left to pos34 (but that's backward), or right to pos54 (but pos54 is non-goal, but the stone needs to reach pos51. Wait, pos44's allowed moves: from pos44, you can move left to pos34, right to pos54, up to pos43, down to pos45. Wait, the allowed moves are determined by the given connections. Looking at the original state's movement possibilities:

For pos44:

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown"

So, after pushing the stone to pos44, the agent is at pos34. Then, to push the stone from pos44 to pos43 (dirup), the agent needs to be at pos44's down (pos54) and push up. But pos54 is clear initially. So the agent would need to move from pos34 to pos44 (but pos44 has the stone now). Wait, no: after pushing the stone to pos44, the agent is at pos34. Then the agent can move from pos34 to pos44 (if it's clear). But pos44 has the stone now, so it's not clear. So the agent can't move there.

Wait, after pushing the stone to pos44, the agent is at pos34. The stone is at pos44, which is not clear. So the agent is at pos34. To push the stone from pos44 to pos43, the agent needs to be at pos44's south (pos54) and push north. So the agent needs to move to pos54, then push the stone north to pos44's north (pos43). But pos54 is initially clear, so the agent can move there.

But how to get to pos54 from pos34?

From pos34, the agent can move up to pos33, then right to pos43, then right to pos53, then down to pos54.

So path: pos34 â†’ pos33 (dirup), pos33 â†’ pos43 (dirright), pos43 â†’ pos53 (dirright), pos53 â†’ pos54 (dirdown).

At pos54, the agent can then push the stone from pos44 to pos43 (direction dirup). But pushing from pos44 to pos43 requires the agent to be at pos54 (south of pos44) and push north. The action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos43 dirup.

This action's preconditions:

- Agent is at pos54.

- Stone is at pos44.

- pos43 is clear.

- Direction from pos54 to pos44: is there a movement allowed? Looking at the movement connections:

From pos54: allowed moves are pos44 (dirleft), pos53 (dirup), pos55 (dirdown). So to move from pos54 to pos44, direction dirleft. So the agent can move from pos54 to pos44 (if clear). But pos44 has the stone, so the agent can't move there. Instead, to push the stone from pos44 to pos43, the agent must be at pos44's south (pos54) and push north. So the direction from agent's position (pos54) to stone's position (pos44) is dirup. But according to the movement connections, can the agent move from pos54 to pos44 following direction dirup? No, the movement from pos54 is dirleft (to pos44), dirup (to pos53), or dirdown (to pos55). So the direction from pos54 to pos44 is dirleft, not dirup. Therefore, the agent can't push the stone from pos44 to pos43 while being at pos54, because the direction from pos54 to pos44 is dirleft, not dirup. Therefore, this approach is invalid.

Alternative approach: the agent can push the stone from pos44 to pos43 by being at pos44's north (pos43) and pushing south. But pos43 is clear initially. So the agent can move to pos43, then push south to pos44.

Wait, no. To push the stone from pos44 to pos43, the agent needs to be at pos44's north (pos43) and push south into pos44, which would push the stone south to pos45? No, wait, the direction for pushing is the direction the agent is moving into the stone. For example, if the agent is at pos43 (north of pos44) and pushes south (direction dirdown), then the stone would move from pos44 to pos45 (dirdown from pos44). Because the stone's movement direction is the same as the agent's direction. So pushing from pos43 south to pos44 would push the stone south to pos45.

But we want to push the stone west (dirleft) to pos43. Wait, pos44 to pos43 is dirup (north), so the agent needs to be south of pos44 (pos54) and push north. But as before, the movement from pos54 to pos44 is dirleft, not dirup. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, the agent can be east of pos44 (pos54) and push west (dirleft) into pos44, which would push the stone west to pos43. Wait, pos44's east is pos54. So if the agent is at pos54, and pushes west (dirleft) into pos44, then the stone is pushed west to pos43. So the direction from agent's position (pos54) to stone's position (pos44) is dirleft. Then, the stone's movement would be dirleft from pos44, which is pos43.

Yes, that works. So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos43 dirleft.

The preconditions for this action:

- Agent is at pos54 (l_p=pos54).

- Stone is at pos44 (l_from=pos44).

- pos43 (l_to=pos43) is clear.

- Can move from pos54 to pos44 following dirleft (yes, according to movement connections: pos54 can move dirleft to pos44).

- Can move from pos44 to pos43 following dirleft (from pos44, dirleft is pos34, not pos43. Wait, no. pos44's directions: pos44's left (dirleft) is pos34. To move to pos43 from pos44, the direction is dirup. Because pos44's up is pos43.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me check the movement connections again.

From pos44: allowed moves are to pos34 (dirleft), pos54 (dirright), pos43 (dirup), pos45 (dirdown).

So to move from pos44 to pos43, the direction is dirup.

So, for the agent to push the stone from pos44 to pos43, the agent must be at pos44's south (pos54) and push north (dirup), but that would require the agent to move from pos54 to pos44 via dirup, which isn't allowed. Because the movement from pos54 to pos44 is dirleft, not dirup. Therefore, the agent can't push the stone from pos44 to pos43 by being at pos54.

Alternatively, the agent can be at pos43 (north of pos44) and push south (dirdown) into pos44, which would push the stone south to pos45. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, the agent can be at pos34 (west of pos44) and push east (dirright) into pos44, pushing the stone east to pos54. But then the stone is at pos54, which is a non-goal, and pos55 must remain clear.

This is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to push the stone from pos34 to pos44, then find a way to move it to pos51 via pos41.

After pushing the stone to pos44, the agent is at pos34. Then, the agent can move east to pos44 (but it's blocked by the stone). So the agent needs to go around. From pos34, the agent can move up to pos33, then right to pos43, then down to pos44 (but pos44 has the stone). Alternatively, the agent can move down to pos35, then east to pos45, then north to pos44 (blocked).

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos44, the agent is at pos34. Then the agent can move up to pos33, right to pos43 (clear), then down to pos44 (blocked). So perhaps the agent needs to move to pos43, then push the stone west to pos44's west (pos34) but that's moving back.

Alternatively, from pos43, the agent can push the stone south to pos44's south (pos45). But that's moving away from the goal.

This suggests that pushing the stone to pos44 might not be the optimal path. Maybe we need a different route.

Alternative plan: push the stone from pos34 to pos24 (west), then to pos14, etc. But that's moving away from the goal.

Wait, the goal is pos51 (row5, column1). So the stone needs to move west and then south. pos34 is row3, column4. To get to pos51 (row5, column1), the stone needs to move left (west) to column1, then down to row5. But how?

Another route: pos34 â†’ pos44 â†’ pos43 â†’ pos42 â†’ pos41 â†’ pos51.

pos41 is row4, column1. From pos41, pushing the stone right to pos51 (row5, column1) would require the agent to be at pos41's east (pos51 is east? No, pos51 is row5, column1. pos41 is row4, column1. So east would be column2. pos51 is south of pos41? No, pos51 is row5, column1, so south of pos41 would be row5, column1. So pos51 is south of pos41. So the agent can be at pos41 and push south to pos51.

Yes, pos41 is row4, column1. pos51 is row5, column1. So south direction from pos41 is pos51.

So, to push the stone from pos41 to pos51 (which is a goal), the agent needs to be at pos41, push south to pos51. That would be a pushtogoal action.

But to get the stone to pos41, the agent needs to push it from pos34 to pos44, then to pos43, pos42, pos41.

Let's outline this path:

1. Push stone from pos34 to pos44 (using agent at pos33, pushing down).

   - This satisfies constraint 3 (stone at pos44).

   - Before this, we need to ensure constraint 4: either agent was at pos54 or pos25 was not clear.

   So, perhaps the agent first visits pos25, making it not clear, then proceeds.

But how?

First, agent moves from pos13 to pos23 (dirright), then to pos24 (dirdown), then to pos25 (dirdown). Now pos25 is not clear. Then agent returns to pos23, moves to pos33, pushes stone to pos44.

But this adds steps but satisfies constraint 4.

So steps:

Action: move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright

Action: move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown

Action: move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown

Now pos25 is not clear. Then agent moves back to pos24, pos23, pos33.

Action: move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup

Action: move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup

Action: move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright

Then push stone from pos34 to pos44:

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos44 dirdown

Now stone is at pos44, agent at pos34.

Now, to move the stone west:

Agent needs to get to pos44's east (pos54) to push west into pos44, moving the stone to pos43.

But how to get to pos54 from pos34.

Agent path: pos34 â†’ pos35 (dirdown), pos35 â†’ pos45 (dirright), pos45 â†’ pos44 (dirup). But pos44 has the stone, so can't move there. Alternatively, pos34 â†’ pos44 (blocked), so agent needs to go around.

From pos34, agent can move up to pos33, then right to pos43, then down to pos44 (blocked). So no.

Alternative path from pos34: move down to pos35, then right to pos45, then up to pos44 (blocked). So no.

Alternative path: pos34 â†’ pos33 (dirup), pos33 â†’ pos43 (dirright), pos43 â†’ pos53 (dirright), pos53 â†’ pos54 (dirdown).

Now agent is at pos54, which is allowed, but pos54 can be non-clear only once. Now, agent pushes the stone from pos44 to pos43:

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos43 dirleft

Now stone is at pos43, agent at pos44.

Then, agent needs to push the stone to pos42:

Agent moves to pos43's east (pos53) and push west into pos43, moving stone to pos42.

But pos53 is clear. So agent can move to pos53, then push west to pos43.

Action: move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright (no, pos44's east is pos54? No, pos44's east is pos54 (dirright from pos44). So agent is at pos44, can move east to pos54 (if clear). pos54 is clear initially. So agent moves to pos54.

Then from pos54, agent can move west to pos44 (dirleft), but pos44 is clear (stone is at pos43 now). So agent can move back to pos44.

Wait, after pushing the stone to pos43, the agent is at pos44. Then agent can move east to pos54, then west to pos44, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, after stone is at pos43, agent is at pos44. Then agent can move up to pos43 (dirup), which is now clear (stone is at pos43, so pos43 is not clear. So agent can't move there. So agent needs to find another way.

This is getting too convoluted. Perhaps there's a better path.

Alternative approach: after pushing the stone to pos44 (satisfying constraint 3), the agent needs to push it west to pos43, then west to pos42, then west to pos41, then south to pos51.

But how to achieve that.

After stone is at pos44:

Agent is at pos34. To push the stone west to pos43, the agent needs to be at pos44's east (pos54) and push west (dirleft). So the agent needs to get to pos54.

So agent path from pos34 to pos54:

pos34 â†’ pos35 (dirdown), pos35 â†’ pos45 (dirright), pos45 â†’ pos44 (dirup) (blocked), pos45 â†’ pos55 (dirright) (but pos55 must remain clear). So can't go there.

Alternatively, pos34 â†’ pos33 (dirup), pos33 â†’ pos43 (dirright), pos43 â†’ pos53 (dirright), pos53 â†’ pos54 (dirdown).

Now agent is at pos54. Then, push stone from pos44 to pos43:

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos43 dirleft.

Now stone is at pos43, agent at pos44.

Now, agent needs to push the stone to pos42. To do that, the agent needs to be east of pos43 (pos53) and push west.

Agent moves from pos44 to pos43 (dirup) but pos43 has the stone. So no. Alternatively, agent moves from pos44 to pos54 (dirright), then to pos53 (dirup), then to pos43 (dirleft). But pos53 is clear (constraint 7 allows it once). So:

Action: move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright

Action: move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup

Action: move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft

Now agent is at pos43. Then, push stone west to pos42:

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos42 dirleft

Wait, no. The stone is at pos43. To push it west to pos42, the agent needs to be at pos43's east (pos53) and push west. But the agent is at pos43. So to push west, the agent must be at pos43's east (pos53) and push west into pos43, moving the stone to pos42. So agent needs to move to pos53.

Action: move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright

Then, pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos42 dirleft.

Now stone is at pos42, agent at pos43.

Then, push stone west to pos41:

Agent needs to be at pos42's east (pos52), but pos52 must remain clear (constraint 6). So can't go there. Alternatively, agent can be at pos42's north (pos32) or south (pos52, blocked). So this seems impossible.

Alternatively, agent can move to pos42's west (pos32) and push east into pos42, moving stone to pos41.

But pos32 is clear initially. So agent can move to pos32.

Path from pos43 to pos32:

pos43 â†’ pos33 (dirleft), pos33 â†’ pos32 (dirup).

Action: move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft

Action: move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup

Now agent is at pos32. Push stone at pos42 to pos41:

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos41 dirleft.

This requires that the agent is at pos32, stone at pos42, direction from pos32 to pos42 is dirright (since pos32 to pos42 is east). So pushing dirright into pos42, moving the stone east to pos43. No, that's not helpful. Wait, the direction from agent's position (pos32) to stone's position (pos42) is dirright (east). So the stone is at pos42, agent pushes east into pos42, moving the stone east to pos43. But we want to move west to pos41. So this approach isn't working.

This is getting too complicated. Perhaps there's a better way. Let's try to find a minimal path considering all constraints.

Alternative plan:

1. Agent moves from pos13 â†’ pos23 (dirright).

2. pos23 â†’ pos24 (dirdown).

3. pos24 â†’ pos25 (dirdown) â†’ now pos25 is not clear, satisfying part of constraint 4.

4. Agent returns to pos24 (dirup), then pos24 â†’ pos34 (dirright) â†’ but pos34 has stone, so can't move. Instead, agent moves from pos25 to pos24 (dirup), then to pos14 (dirleft), then to pos13 (dirup). Then from pos13, move to pos23, pos33 (dirright).

But this is time-consuming.

Alternatively, after making pos25 not clear, agent proceeds to push the stone to pos44.

So steps:

- move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright

- move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown

- move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown â†’ now pos25 is not clear (satisfies constraint 4 if we push stone to pos44 after this).

Then agent needs to get back to pos33 to push the stone.

From pos25, move up to pos24, then left to pos14, then up to pos13, then right to pos23, then right to pos33.

Then push stone from pos34 to pos44:

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos44 dirdown.

Now stone is at pos44, agent at pos34.

Then, to move the stone to pos41 and then to pos51.

But how?

From pos44, the agent is at pos34. To push the stone west, the agent needs to be at pos44's east (pos54) and push west.

Agent moves from pos34 to pos44 (blocked). So agent needs to go around.

From pos34, move up to pos33, then right to pos43, then down to pos44 (blocked). No.

Alternatively, agent moves down to pos35, then right to pos45, then up to pos44 (blocked).

Alternatively, agent moves up to pos33, right to pos43, then right to pos53, down to pos54.

At pos54, agent can push stone from pos44 to pos43 dirleft.

Then stone is at pos43, agent at pos44.

Then agent moves to pos43's east (pos53), push west to pos43, moving stone to pos42.

But pos53 is clear (constraint 7 allows one continuous sequence). So agent moves to pos53, then pushtonongoal to pos42.

Then stone at pos42, agent at pos43.

Then agent moves to pos42's east (pos52) but pos52 must be clear (constraint 6). So can't go there.

Alternatively, agent moves to pos42's north (pos32), then push south into pos42, moving stone to pos41.

Agent path: pos43 â†’ pos33 (dirleft), pos33 â†’ pos32 (dirup), pos32 â†’ pos42 (dirdown). But pos42 has the stone, so can't move there. So agent can't.

This is not working. Maybe the initial plan is too long. Let's think of another approach.

Another idea: after pushing the stone to pos44, the agent moves to pos54 (satisfying constraint 4 by being there), then pushes the stone to pos43.

But to reach pos54 from pos34:

pos34 â†’ pos35 (dirdown), pos35 â†’ pos45 (dirright), pos45 â†’ pos55 (blocked due to constraint 1). So no.

Alternatively, pos34 â†’ pos33 (dirup), pos33 â†’ pos43 (dirright), pos43 â†’ pos53 (dirright), pos53 â†’ pos54 (dirdown).

At pos54, agent pushes stone from pos44 to pos43 dirleft.

Then stone is at pos43, agent at pos44.

Now, to push stone to pos42, agent needs to be at pos43's east (pos53) and push west.

Agent moves from pos44 to pos54 (dirright), then to pos53 (dirup), then pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos42 dirleft.

Now stone is at pos42, agent at pos43.

Then, agent moves to pos42's east (pos52) which is forbidden. So no.

This is really challenging. Given the time I'm spending, perhaps the minimal plan involves moving the stone to pos44, then via pos43, pos42, pos41 to pos51, but ensuring all constraints.

Additionally, we need to satisfy constraint 5: at least one state where player1 is at pos21 and pos31 is not clear. How to achieve that?

pos31 is clear initially. To make pos31 not clear, the agent or stone must be there. Since the stone is moving towards pos51, perhaps the agent can visit pos31.

For example, after moving the stone to pos44, the agent can detour to pos31, making pos31 not clear. But why?

Alternatively, during the initial steps, the agent can move to pos21 and pos31.

Wait, the agent starts at pos13. To reach pos21, the path is pos13 â†’ pos23 (dirright), pos23 â†’ pos22 (dirup), pos22 â†’ pos21 (dirup). Then, from pos21, move to pos31 (dirright), making pos31 not clear.

So steps:

Action: move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright

Action: move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup

Action: move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup

Now agent is at pos21. Then, move to pos31:

Action: move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright

Now pos31 is not clear (agent is there), and agent is at pos31. This satisfies constraint 5: player1 is at pos21 (earlier step) and pos31 is not clear (current step). Wait, no: the agent was at pos21 in a previous state, but in the current state, the agent is at pos31. So the constraint requires that in the same state, player1 is at pos21 and pos31 is not clear. But in this case, when the agent is at pos21, pos31 is clear. When the agent is at pos31, pos31 is not clear, but the agent is not at pos21. So this doesn't satisfy the constraint.

To satisfy constraint 5, there must be at least one state where both conditions are true: agent is at pos21 AND pos31 is not clear. So during that state, pos31 must have either the agent or a stone. So perhaps the agent can be at pos21, and have moved the stone to pos31 earlier. Or have the agent move to pos31, then go back to pos21 while the stone is at pos31.

But the stone is initially at pos34 and needs to move to pos51. Having the stone at pos31 would be a detour. Alternatively, the agent can be at pos21 and have the stone at pos31.

But how? The stone is at pos34. The agent would need to push it to pos33, then to pos32, then to pos31. But that's a long way.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos44, the agent can move to pos31, making it not clear, then go back to pos21.

But this would require:

After pushing to pos44, agent is at pos34. Then:

pos34 â†’ pos33 (dirup), pos33 â†’ pos32 (dirup), pos32 â†’ pos31 (dirleft). Then agent is at pos31, making pos31 not clear. Then agent moves back to pos21.

But how?

From pos31 to pos21: move dirleft to pos21. Then agent is at pos21. So:

Action: move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup

Action: move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup

Action: move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft

Now pos31 is not clear (agent there).

Action: move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft

Now agent is at pos21, and pos31 is not clear (since agent just left pos31). Wait, no. When the agent leaves pos31, pos31 becomes clear. So in the state after moving to pos21, pos31 is clear again. So this doesn't satisfy the constraint.

Hmm. So to have a state where agent is at pos21 AND pos31 is not clear, pos31 must have something else (stone or agent) while the agent is at pos21. But the stone is at pos44 during this time. So the only way is for the agent to be at pos21 and have pos31 occupied by the stone. Which requires pushing the stone to pos31. But that's a long detour.

Alternatively, during the initial steps, before pushing the stone, the agent can move to pos21 and pos31, leaving a stone there. But the stone is at pos34 initially. So this seems impossible.

This suggests that satisfying constraint 5 is non-trivial. Perhaps the minimal plan involves a detour where the stone is temporarily moved to pos31.

But this would require a lot of steps. Given the time constraints, perhaps the optimal plan involves the following steps, ensuring all constraints:

1. Move agent to pos25 to satisfy constraint 4.

2. Push stone to pos44.

3. Move agent to pos21 and pos31 to satisfy constraint 5.

But this is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to outline a possible plan step-by-step, ensuring all constraints:

Initial state:

- player1 at pos13

- stone1 at pos34

- pos55, pos52 always clear.

Steps:

1. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright

2. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown

3. move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown â†’ now pos25 is not clear (satisfies constraint 4 when we push to pos44 later)

4. move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup

5. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup

6. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright â†’ now at pos33

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos44 dirdown â†’ stone at pos44, agent at pos34. This satisfies constraint 3.

Now, constraint 4 is satisfied because pos25 was not clear in step 3.

Next, need to satisfy constraint 5: agent at pos21 and pos31 not clear.

Agent moves from pos34 to pos33 (dirup), then to pos32 (dirup), then to pos31 (dirleft).

8. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup

9. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup

10. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft â†’ pos31 not clear (agent there)

11. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft â†’ agent at pos21, pos31 is now clear. Doesn't satisfy constraint 5.

Alternatively, agent stays at pos31 (pos31 not clear), and moves to pos21:

But when agent is at pos31, pos31 is not clear. If the agent then moves to pos21, pos31 becomes clear. So there's no state where agent is at pos21 and pos31 is not clear. So this approach fails.

Alternative approach: push stone to pos31. But that's a long way.

Another idea: after step 7, the stone is at pos44. Agent is at pos34.

Agent can move to pos21 and have the stone moved to pos31 somehow. But this seems unlikely.

Alternatively, agent can move from pos34 to pos33, then to pos23, then to pos22, then to pos21.

8. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup

9. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft

10. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup

11. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup â†’ agent at pos21.

At this point, pos31 is clear. So need to have pos31 not clear. How?

Maybe push the stone to pos31. But stone is at pos44. So agent needs to move to pos44's adjacent positions to push it.

Alternatively, after step 7, agent is at pos34. To push the stone to pos43, agent needs to be at pos54.

But this would require a long path.

Alternatively, after step 7, agent is at pos34. The stone is at pos44. Now, agent moves to pos44's east (pos54) to push west to pos44, moving stone to pos43.

Steps:

8. move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown

9. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright

10. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup â†’ blocked by stone at pos44. Can't move there.

No. So agent needs to go around.

From pos34, move up to pos33, right to pos43, right to pos53, down to pos54.

11. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup

12. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright

13. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright

14. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown â†’ agent at pos54 (pos54 is not clear now; constraint 2 allows this once)

15. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos43 dirleft â†’ stone at pos43, agent at pos44.

Now, agent is at pos44. To satisfy constraint 8 (pos33 not clear at least once), during step 11-12, agent was at pos33. But pos33 is clear after agent leaves. So perhaps during step 12, when agent is at pos43, pos33 is clear. Not helpful.

Alternatively, when agent is at pos33 (step 11), pos33 is not clear. So step 11 satisfies constraint 8.

So step 11: agent is at pos33, making pos33 not clear. So constraint 8 is satisfied.

Now, with the stone at pos43, agent at pos44.

Next, push stone to pos42:

16. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup â†’ blocked (stone at pos43). So agent needs to go around.

17. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright

18. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup

19. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft â†’ now agent is at pos43.

20. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos42 dirleft â†’ but stone is at pos43, agent at pos43. Can't push from same position.

Wait, agent must be at a position adjacent to the stone. So to push stone from pos43 to pos42, agent must be at pos43's east (pos53) and push west.

21. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright

22. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos42 dirleft â†’ stone at pos42, agent at pos43.

Now, push stone to pos41:

23. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft â†’ blocked (stone at pos42).

24. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright

25. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirright â†’ but pos52 must remain clear (constraint 6). So can't move there.

Alternative approach: agent moves to pos42's north (pos32), then push south into pos42, moving stone to pos41.

26. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft

27. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup

28. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirdown â†’ blocked (stone at pos42).

No.

Alternatively, agent moves from pos43 to pos33, then to pos32, then to pos42's north (pos32), then push south.

But pos42 is south of pos32.

29. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft

30. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup

31. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos41 dirdown â†’ but the stone is at pos42. Agent is at pos32, pushing south into pos42. So stone moves south to pos52. But pos52 must remain clear. So invalid.

This approach is not working.

Alternative plan: after stone is at pos42, agent needs to push it west to pos41. To do that, agent must be at pos42's east (pos52) and push west. But pos52 must remain clear. So impossible.

This suggests that the stone cannot be moved from pos42 to pos41 without violating constraint 6. Therefore, the initial path is invalid.

Alternative route: after stone is at pos43, push it north to pos33, then west to pos23, etc. But that's moving away from the goal.

This seems like a dead end. Perhaps the minimal plan requires the stone to be moved directly from pos44 to pos51 via pos41.

But how?

pos44 to pos41: the stone would need to move west three times (pos44 â†’ pos43 â†’ pos42 â†’ pos41), then south to pos51.

But earlier attempts to move the stone west from pos44 are blocked by constraints.

Given the time I'm spending, perhaps the correct plan involves the following steps, even if it's not the most optimal:

1. Move agent to pos25 to satisfy constraint 4.

2. Push stone to pos44.

3. Move agent to pos54 and push stone to pos43.

4. Push stone to pos42.

5. Push stone to pos41.

6. Push stone to pos51.

But ensuring all constraints are met.

Let's outline this plan with actions:

1. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright

2. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown

3. move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown â†’ pos25 not clear

4. move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup

5. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup

6. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos44 dirdown â†’ stone at pos44, agent at pos34

Now, stone at pos44 (constraint 3 met). Constraint 4 is met because pos25 was not clear in step 3.

Next:

8. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup

9. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright

10. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright â†’ pos53 not clear (constraint 7 allows once)

11. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown â†’ pos54 not clear (constraint 2 allows once)

12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos43 dirleft â†’ stone at pos43, agent at pos44

13. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright â†’ pos54 not clear (still in the same sequence)

14. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup â†’ pos53 not clear (allowed)

15. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos42 dirleft â†’ stone at pos42, agent at pos43

16. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright â†’ pos53 not clear (still allowed)

17. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirright â†’ invalid (constraint 6)

So step 17 is invalid. Need to find another way.

Alternative steps after 15:

16. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft

17. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup

18. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirdown â†’ blocked

No. Alternative:

16. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft â†’ blocked (stone at pos42)

No. So this approach is stuck.

Given the time, I think the correct answer involves the following steps, even if not fully optimal:

```
move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright
move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown
move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos44 dirdown
move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright
move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos43 dirleft
move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos42 dirleft
move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirleft
move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos41 pos51 dirdown
```

But this might not be valid due to constraint 6 (pos52 must be clear). Also, the final push from pos41 to pos51 would require the agent to be at pos41's south (pos51), but pos51 is the goal. The direction from pos41 to pos51 is dirdown. So agent must be at pos41 and push south to pos51.

So the correct action would be pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos41 pos51 dirdown, but the agent needs to be at pos41 and push south. The preconditions require that the agent is at l_p (pos41), stone is at pos41, and direction from pos41 to pos41 is invalid. Wait, no. To push the stone from pos41 to pos51, the agent must be at pos41, and the stone is at pos41. But the stone is at pos41, which is not the case. The stone is at pos41 after being pushed there.

Wait, after pushing the stone to pos41, the agent is at pos42. Then, the agent can move to pos41 and push south to pos51.

So steps after stone is at pos41:

Agent is at pos42.

Action: move player1 pos42 pos41 dirleft

Then, pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos41 pos51 dirdown.

But the stone is at pos41. The agent is at pos41. So the direction from pos41 to pos41 is invalid. Therefore, this is incorrect.

Correct approach: agent must be at pos41's north (pos31) and push south into pos41, moving the stone to pos51.

But pos31 is clear. So:

Agent moves from pos42 to pos41 (dirleft), then to pos31 (dirup).

Then, pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos41 pos51 dirdown.

This action's preconditions:

- Agent at pos31.

- Stone at pos41.

- pos51 is clear.

- Direction from pos31 to pos41 is dirdown (south).

- Direction from pos41 to pos51 is dirdown.

- pos51 is a goal.

So this action is valid.

Thus, the final steps would be:

After stone is at pos41:

Agent moves from pos42 to pos41 dirleft (step X).

Then moves up to pos31 dirup (step Y).

Then pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos41 pos51 dirdown.

This would move the stone to pos51.

Putting it all together:

Valid plan steps (simplified):

1. Move to pos25 to satisfy constraint 4.
2. Push stone to pos44.
3. Move to pos54 and push to pos43.
4. Move to pos53 and push to pos42.
5. Move to pos43 and push to pos41.
6. Move to pos31 and push to pos51.

Each step must ensure constraints are met.

Final answer:
