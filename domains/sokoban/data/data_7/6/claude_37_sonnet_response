I need to understand the problem:

We have a 5x5 grid with positions labeled pos11 (top-left) to pos55 (bottom-right).
The agent (player1) starts at pos13.
There is a stone (stone1) at pos34.
The goal location is pos51.
We need to move the stone to the goal location.

Let me visualize the grid:

```
(1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5)
(2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5)
(3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5)
(4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5)
(5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5)
```

Player1 starts at (1,3), stone1 is at (3,4), and the goal is at (5,1).

I have a couple of contraints:
1. pos55 must always be clear
2. pos54 can only be non-clear once in a consecutive sequence of states
3. stone1 must be at pos44 in at least one state
4. If stone1 is at pos44, then earlier player1 must have been at pos54 or pos25 must have been non-clear
5. There must be a state in which player1 is at pos21 and pos31 is not clear
6. pos52 must always be clear
7. pos53 can only be non-clear once in a consecutive sequence of states
8. pos33 must be non-clear in at least one state

Now, I'll start planning. Given that the stone needs to reach the goal position (5,1), and it starts at position (3,4), I need to find a path to push it there. 

Let's think step by step:
1. The agent needs to push the stone from (3,4) to (5,1).
2. To push the stone, the agent needs to be on the opposite side of where the stone should go.
3. Given the constraints, the stone might need to take a specific path to reach the goal.

Let's think about the path the stone might take from (3,4) to (5,1):
- From (3,4) to (4,4), pushing it down. (This satisfies constraint 3.)
- From (4,4) to (4,3), pushing it left.
- From (4,3) to (4,2), pushing it left again.
- From (4,2) to (4,1), pushing it left once more.
- From (4,1) to (5,1), pushing it down to reach the goal.

But there are constraints to consider:
- Constraint 4: Before the stone is at (4,4), the agent must have been at (5,4) or (2,5) must have been non-clear. This means that the agent might need to visit (5,4) first before pushing the stone to (4,4).
- Constraint 5: There must be a state where the agent is at (2,1) and (3,1) is not clear. This means the stone might need to be at (3,1) at some point.
- Constraint 8: There must be a state where (3,3) is not clear. This might be the stone, indicating that the stone might pass through (3,3).

Let's revise the path:
- The agent might need to first go to (5,4) to satisfy constraint 4.
- Then the agent can push the stone from (3,4) to (4,4).
- From (4,4), the agent can push the stone to (4,3), then to (4,2), then to (4,1).
- From (4,1), the agent can push the stone to (3,1), satisfying constraint 5 (if the agent is at (2,1) at that time).
- Finally, from (3,1), the agent can push the stone to the goal at (5,1).

But this doesn't make logical sense; we can't push a stone from (3,1) to (5,1) directly. Let me reconsider.

Maybe we need to push the stone through (3,3) to satisfy constraint 8, then to (4,4) (after the agent has been to (5,4)), and then find a path to (5,1).

Hmm, let me reconsider the problem more carefully.

Actually, a simpler way to understand the constraints might be to think about them in terms of the grid coordinates:

1. pos55 must always be clear => (5,5) must always be clear.
2. pos54 can only be non-clear once in a consecutive sequence of states => (5,4) can only be non-clear once.
3. stone1 must be at pos44 in at least one state => stone1 must be at (4,4) at some point.
4. If stone1 is at pos44, then earlier player1 must have been at pos54 or pos25 must have been non-clear => if stone1 is at (4,4), then player1 must have been at (5,4) or (2,5) must have been non-clear earlier.
5. There must be a state in which player1 is at pos21 and pos31 is not clear => There must be a state where player1 is at (2,1) and (3,1) is not clear.
6. pos52 must always be clear => (5,2) must always be clear.
7. pos53 can only be non-clear once in a consecutive sequence of states => (5,3) can only be non-clear once.
8. pos33 must be non-clear in at least one state => (3,3) must be non-clear at some point.

Now, let's reassess the path for the stone. Starting at (3,4), we need to push it to the goal at (5,1). Given the constraints, one possible path for the stone might be:
- From (3,4) to (3,3), satisfying constraint 8.
- From (3,3) to (4,3).
- From (4,3) to (4,4), satisfying constraint 3. But before this, the agent needs to have been at (5,4) or (2,5) must have been non-clear.
- From (4,4) to (4,3) back.
- From (4,3) to (4,2).
- From (4,2) to (4,1).
- From (4,1) to (3,1). When the stone is here, the agent can be at (2,1), satisfying constraint 5.
- From (3,1) to (4,1) back.
- From (4,1) to (5,1) to reach the goal.

But I'm still unsure about how to satisfy the constraint that before the stone is at (4,4), the agent must have been at (5,4) or (2,5) must have been non-clear. 

I'll refine the plan:
1. The agent starts at (1,3).
2. The agent navigates to a position to push the stone from (3,4) to (3,3).
3. The agent then pushes the stone from (3,3) to (4,3).
4. The agent navigates to (5,4).
5. The agent pushes the stone from (4,3) to (4,4).
6. The agent pushes the stone back from (4,4) to (4,3).
7. The agent continues pushing the stone to (4,2), then (4,1).
8. The agent pushes the stone to (3,1), and positions itself at (2,1).
9. The agent then pushes the stone back to (4,1).
10. Finally, the agent pushes the stone to the goal at (5,1).

Let's formalize this into a sequence of actions.

Actually wait, I'm getting confused with the coordinates. Let me go back to the original naming of positions: posXY where X is the row and Y is the column.

So, player1 starts at pos13, stone1 is at pos34, and the goal is at pos51.

Let me make a clearer representation of the grid:

```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

So, player1 starts at the top row, 3rd column, stone1 is at the 3rd row, 4th column, and the goal is at the bottom row, 1st column.

Given the grid and the constraints, I'll refine my plan again.

Basically, we need to push the stone from pos34 to pos51. We have a variety of constraints to satisfy along the way.

The fact that the stone needs to be at pos44 (constraint 3) tells me that one of the possible paths is:
- Push the stone from pos34 to pos44.
- Push it further down the path to pos51.

But before the stone is at pos44, player1 must have been at pos54 or pos25 must have been non-clear (constraint 4). I'll use the simpler one and ensure that player1 visits pos54 before the stone is at pos44.

Also, there must be a state where player1 is at pos21 and pos31 is not clear (constraint 5). This suggests the stone might be at pos31 at some point, with player1 at pos21.

And there must be a state where pos33 is not clear (constraint 8). This suggests the stone might be at pos33 at some point.

I think a valid path might be:
- Move player1 to a position where it can push the stone from pos34 to pos33.
- Move player1 to push the stone from pos33 to pos43.
- Move player1 to pos54.
- Move player1 to push the stone from pos43 to pos44.
- Move player1 to push the stone from pos44 to pos43 (going back).
- Move player1 to push the stone from pos43 to pos42, then to pos41.
- Move player1 to push the stone from pos41 to pos31 (with player1 at pos21 at this point, satisfying constraint 5).
- Move player1 to push the stone from pos31 to pos41 (going back).
- Move player1 to push the stone from pos41 to pos51 (the goal).

Ok, so the plan seems viable. I think constraint 2 to 8 get satisfied. I think constraint 1 (pos55 must always be clear) and 6 (pos52 must always be clear) will be respected if we're careful with the path the agent takes.

I'll now plan the agent's moves. I need to calculate a precise sequence of "move", "pushtogoal", and "pushtonongoal" actions.

Actually, let's quickly double check whether I'm understanding the coordinates correctly. I believe it's pos[x][y].

Based on the given connections, for instance, pos11 can move to pos21 (dirright) and pos12 (dirdown). This means that from position (1, 1), moving right leads to (2, 1) and moving down leads to (1, 2). 

Actually... I think I've got the naming conventions backwards, it's more like pos[row, column], so pos13 refers to the 1st row, 3rd column, pos34 means 3rd row, 4th column, and pos51 means 5th row, 1st column.

Let me re-visualize the grid:
```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

So, player1 starts at pos13 (1st row, 3rd column), stone1 is at pos34 (3rd row, 4th column), and the goal is at pos51 (5th row, 1st column).

Given this updated understanding, I'll refine my plan again. Here's a rough plan:
1. The player (at pos13) needs to move to a position from where they can push the stone (at pos34) towards the goal (pos51).
2. The player needs to satisfy the constraints along the way.

Let's assume I was understanding the directions correctly. Dirright means moving to a position with a higher row value, dirleft means moving to a position with a lower row value, dirdown means moving to a position with a higher column value, and dirup means moving to a position with a lower column value.

Okay, this is a bit confusing. Let me double check by looking at the given connections:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" - This means moving from (1,1) to (2,1) is moving right.
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown" - This means moving from (1,1) to (1,2) is moving down.

So, dirright increases the row value, and dirdown increases the column value.

Hmm, that's a bit strange for traditional grid coordinates. Let me check more connections:

"You may move from location pos12 to location pos22 following direction dirright" - This confirms that moving right increases the row value.
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos11 following direction dirup" - This confirms that moving up decreases the column value.

Ok, so the directions are:
dirright: Increase row value.
dirleft: Decrease row value.
dirdown: Increase column value.
dirup: Decrease column value.

This is a bit counterintuitive for traditional grid coordinates, but I will work with this.

Let's revisit the initial and goal states:
- Player1 starts at pos13 (1st row, 3rd column).
- Stone1 is at pos34 (3rd row, 4th column).
- The goal is at pos51 (5th row, 1st column).

For clarity, let me visualize the grid with objects:
```
P . . . .   (P: player1)
. . . . .   (S: stone1)
. . . S .   (G: goal at pos51)
. . . . .
G . . . .
```

Let's now refine my plan:
1. From pos13, the player needs to get to a position from where they can push the stone. The stone is at pos34, so the player needs to be at pos35, pos33, pos24, or pos44 to push it.
2. Let's say the player decides to move down to pos35, so the stone can be pushed to pos33 (to satisfy constraint 8).
3. The player then pushes the stone to pos43 (both from pos33).
4. The player moves to pos54 (to satisfy constraint 4).
5. The player then comes back to push the stone from pos43 to pos44 (satisfying constraint 3).
6. The player then pushes the stone from pos44 back to pos43, then to pos42, then to pos41.
7. The player pushes the stone from pos41 to pos31, and positions itself at pos21 (satisfying constraint 5).
8. The player then pushes the stone from pos31 back to pos41.
9. Finally, the player pushes the stone from pos41 to pos51 (the goal).

I think this plan satisfies all constraints. Now, let me formalize it into move actions.

From pos13, the player needs to move to pos35 to push the stone from pos34 to pos33. This involves the following moves:
1. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
2. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
3. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
4. move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown

Now, the player can push the stone from pos34 to pos33 (left).
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirleft

The player then pushes the stone from pos33 to pos43 (right).
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos43 dirright

The player moves to pos54 to satisfy constraint 4.
7. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
8. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown
9. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright
10. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup

The player then comes back to push the stone from pos43 to pos44.
11. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
12. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft

Now, the player can push the stone from pos43 to pos44.
13. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos44 dirdown

The player then pushes the stone from pos44 back to pos43.
14. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos44 pos43 dirup

The player then pushes the stone from pos43 to pos42, then to pos41.
15. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos42 dirleft
16. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos42 pos41 dirleft

The player pushes the stone from pos41 to pos31.
17. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos41 pos31 dirleft

The player positions itself at pos21.
18. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft

The player then pushes the stone from pos31 back to pos41.
19. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos31 pos41 dirright

Finally, the player pushes the stone from pos41 to pos51 (the goal).
20. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos41 pos51 dirright

Ah wait, but I need to fix some of the logic here. If the player pushes the stone from pos33 to pos43, the player should end up at pos33 after the push. So step 7 should start from pos33, not pos43.

Let's recheck and redo these steps:

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirleft

After this action, the player should be at pos34 (not pos35). The stone is at pos33.

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos43 dirright

After this, the player should be at pos33 (not pos34), and the stone is at pos43.

The player moves to pos54.
7. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
8. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
9. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown
10. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright
11. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup

The player then comes back to push the stone from pos43 to pos44.
12. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
13. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft

Now, the player can push the stone from pos43 to pos44.
14. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos44 dirdown

After this, the player should be at pos43, and the stone is at pos44.

The player then pushes the stone from pos44 back to pos43.
15. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos43 dirup

After this, the player should be at pos44, and the stone is at pos43.

The player then pushes the stone from pos43 to pos42, then to pos41.
16. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirleft

After this, the player should be at pos43, and the stone is at pos42.

17. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirleft

After this, the player should be at pos42, and the stone is at pos41.

The player pushes the stone from pos41 to pos31.
18. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos41 pos31 dirleft

After this, the player should be at pos41, and the stone is at pos31.

The player positions itself at pos21.
19. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
20. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft

The player then pushes the stone from pos31 back to pos41.
21. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos31 pos41 dirright

After this, the player should be at pos31, and the stone is at pos41.

Finally, the player pushes the stone from pos41 to pos51 (the goal).
22. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos41 pos51 dirright

After this, the player should be at pos41, and the stone is at pos51 (the goal).

Ok, I'm still a bit confused about the pushing actions. Let's go back to the definition of the actions:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.

This means the agent is at l_p and pushes the stone from l_from to l_to. For this to work, the agent at l_p should be able to reach l_from by moving in direction d, and l_from should be able to reach l_to by moving in direction d.

For instance, if the agent is at pos35 and the stone is at pos34, then to push the stone from pos34 to pos33, we would have:
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirleft

After this action, the agent would be at pos34, and the stone would be at pos33.

I think I was mostly understanding this correctly. Let me walk through my plan again, making sure the agent positions make sense.

Okay, let's restart and create a detailed plan, ensuring that the agent positions are correctly tracked.

Starting with:
- Player at pos13
- Stone at pos34
- Goal at pos51

The constraints say:
1. pos55 must always be clear.
2. pos54 can only be non-clear once in a consecutive sequence of states.
3. stone1 must be at pos44 in at least one state.
4. If stone1 is at pos44, then earlier player1 must have been at pos54 or pos25 must have been non-clear.
5. There must be a state where player1 is at pos21 and pos31 is not clear.
6. pos52 must always be clear.
7. pos53 can only be non-clear once in a consecutive sequence of states.
8. pos33 must be non-clear in at least one state.

Let's identify a path for the stone: pos34 -> pos33 -> pos43 -> pos44 -> pos43 -> pos42 -> pos41 -> pos31 -> pos41 -> pos51.

This path ensures that the stone visits pos33 (constraint 8), pos44 (constraint 3), and pos31 (which, if the agent is at pos21, satisfies constraint 5).

To ensure that constraint 4 is met, the agent must visit pos54 before the stone is at pos44.

For pushing the stone, the agent needs to be on the opposite side from the direction they want to push. So, for example, to push the stone from pos34 to pos33 (to the left), the agent must be at the position to the right of the stone, which is pos35.

Here's the plan step by step:

1. First, the agent needs to get from pos13 to pos35 (to push the stone from pos34 to pos33):
   - move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright
   - move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
   - move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
   - move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown

2. Push the stone from pos34 to pos33 (to satisfy constraint 8):
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirleft
   (After this, the agent is at pos34, and the stone is at pos33.)

3. Push the stone from pos33 to pos43 (to the right):
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos43 dirright
   (After this, the agent is at pos33, and the stone is at pos43.)

4. The agent needs to visit pos54 (to satisfy constraint 4) before pushing the stone to pos44:
   - move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
   - move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
   - move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
   (Now, the agent is at pos54, and the stone is still at pos43.)

5. The agent needs to move back to push the stone from pos43 to pos44:
   - move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft
   - move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
   (Now, the agent is at pos43, and the stone is at pos43 as well, which is a problem...)

Wait, this doesn't work. If the agent is at the same position as the stone, that's a contradiction. I need to rethink the plan.

Let's see... the agent needs to be below the stone to push it down. But the stone is currently at pos43, and the agent can't be at the same position. Let me adjust the plan a bit.

Oh, I see the problem. I'm thinking of the stone and agent being in the same cell, but from the problem statement, it's clear that each cell can have either the agent, a stone, or be empty. The agent and stone can't be in the same cell.

Let's refine the plan:

1. First, the agent needs to get from pos13 to pos33 (to the left of pos34 where the stone is):
   - move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright
   - move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright

2. Push the stone from pos34 to pos35 (to the right):
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirright
   (After this, the agent is at pos34, and the stone is at pos35.)

3. Move the agent to get to pos25 (above the stone, to push it down):
   - move player1 pos34 pos24 dirup
   - move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown
   (Now, the agent is at pos25, and the stone is at pos35.)

4. Push the stone from pos35 to pos45 (down):
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos35 pos45 dirdown
   (After this, the agent is at pos35, and the stone is at pos45.)

5. Move the agent to get to pos44 (to the left of the stone, to push it to the right):
   - move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup
   - move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
   (Now, the agent is at pos44, and the stone is at pos45.)

6. Push the stone from pos45 to pos55 (to the right):
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos45 pos55 dirright
   (After this, the agent is at pos45, and the stone is at pos55.)

Hmm, but this would make pos55 not clear, which would violate constraint 1. Let's rethink.

Alright, let's explore a completely different path:

1. Move the agent from pos13 to pos24 (below the stone, to push it up):
   - move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
   - move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
   (Now, the agent is at pos24, and the stone is at pos34.)

2. Push the stone from pos34 to pos33 (to the left, satisfying constraint 8):
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos33 dirleft
   (After this, the agent is at pos34, and the stone is at pos33.)

3. Move the agent to get to pos43 (below the stone, to push it up):
   - move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
   - move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
   (Now, the agent is at pos43, and the stone is at pos33.)

4. Push the stone from pos33 to pos23 (up):
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirup
   (After this, the agent is at pos33, and the stone is at pos23.)

5. Move to pos54 (to satisfy constraint 4):
   - move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
   - move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
   - move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
   (Now, the agent is at pos54, and the stone is at pos23.)

6. Move back to push the stone:
   - move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft
   - move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
   - move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
   - move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
   (Now, the agent is at pos23, and the stone is at pos23 as well, which is a problem...)

Again, I've put the agent and the stone in the same cell, which isn't allowed. I need to refine my approach.

Let's take a step back and think about this more systematically.

We need to push the stone from pos34 to pos51, satisfying the constraints.
The constraints indicate that the stone should pass through pos33, pos44, and pos31.
Furthermore, the player must visit pos54 before the stone is at pos44, and pos21 while the stone is at pos31.

Here's a possible path for the stone: pos34 -> pos24 -> pos23 -> pos33 -> pos43 -> pos44 -> pos34 -> pos24 -> pos23 -> pos22 -> pos32 -> pos31 -> pos41 -> pos51.

With stone positions and player positions after each push:
- stone at pos34, player below it at pos24.
- stone pushed to pos24, player at pos34.
- stone pushed to pos23, player at pos24.
- stone pushed to pos33, player at pos23.
- stone pushed to pos43, player at pos33.
- player moves to pos54 to satisfy constraint 4.
- player returns to pos43 below the stone.
- stone pushed to pos44, player at pos43.
- stone pushed to pos34, player at pos44.
- stone pushed to pos24, player at pos34.
- stone pushed to pos23, player at pos24.
- stone pushed to pos22, player at pos23.
- stone pushed to pos32, player at pos22.
- stone pushed to pos31, player at pos32.
- player moves to pos21 to satisfy constraint 5.
- player returns to pos31 to push the stone.
- stone pushed to pos41, player at pos31.
- stone pushed to pos51, player at pos41.

Let's walk through the actions for this plan:

1. Move player from pos13 to pos24 (to be below the stone at pos34):
   - move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
   - move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright

2. Push stone from pos34 to pos24:
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos24 dirup

3. Push stone from pos24 to pos23:
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos23 dirleft

4. Push stone from pos23 to pos33:
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos33 dirright

5. Push stone from pos33 to pos43:
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright

6. Move player to pos54 (to satisfy constraint 4):
   - move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
   - move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
   - move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright

7. Return to pos43 (to be below the stone):
   - move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft
   - move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

8. Push stone from pos43 to pos44 (satisfying constraint 3):
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos44 dirdown

9. Push stone from pos44 to pos34:
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos34 dirleft

10. Push stone from pos34 to pos24:
    - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos24 dirup

11. Push stone from pos24 to pos23:
    - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos23 dirleft

12. Push stone from pos23 to pos22:
    - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirleft

13. Push stone from pos22 to pos32:
    - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos32 dirright

14. Push stone from pos32 to pos31:
    - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos31 dirleft

15. Move player to pos21 (satisfying constraint 5):
    - move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup
    - move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft

16. Return to pos31 (to be left of the stone):
    - move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright

17. Push stone from pos31 to pos41:
    - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos31 pos41 dirright

Hmm, that's a problem. I'm confusing myself here. Let's revisit the definitions of the pushing actions:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.
"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to non-goal location l_to, following direction d.

Let's break down what this means for pushing the stone from pos34 to pos24:
- The player is at pos24.
- The stone is at pos34.
- We want to push the stone from pos34 to pos24.
- The direction from pos34 to pos24 is "up" (dirup).
- But, to push the stone in that direction, the player must be on the opposite side, which isn't the case here.

Actually, if we look at the preconditions:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is a goal location.

For precondition (iv), if the player is at pos24 and the stone is at pos34, can the player get from pos24 to pos34 by going in a given direction? From the given connections, pos24 can move to pos34 in the dirright direction.

For precondition (v), can the stone at pos34 move to pos24 in the same dirright direction? No, from the connections, pos34 can move to pos44 in the dirright direction, not to pos24.

So, the action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos24 dirup" wouldn't be valid.

Let's revisit the idea of pushing. 

If the stone is at pos34 and the player is at pos24, the stone is above the player. If the player wants to push the stone, they would be pushing it away from themselves, which means pushing it further up to pos44. In other words, the player can push the stone from pos34 to pos44, but not from pos34 to pos24.

Given this understanding, let's reconsider the plan.

Alright, I've been misunderstanding some of the actions. Let's think about the pushing dynamics:

When the player and stone are in adjacent positions, the player can push the stone away from themselves. So, if the player is at pos24 (below the stone at pos34), they can push the stone up to pos44. They can't pull the stone down to pos24.

Let's revisit the connections to see how the pushing actions work:

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft." - This means moving from pos34 to pos24 is going left.

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright." - This means moving from pos34 to pos44 is going right.

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos33 following direction dirup." - This means moving from pos34 to pos33 is going up.

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos35 following direction dirdown." - This means moving from pos34 to pos35 is going down.

Given these, if the player is at pos24 (left of the stone at pos34), they're pushing the stone from pos34 to pos44 to the right. If the player is at pos33 (up from the stone at pos34), they're pushing the stone from pos34 to pos35 down. And so on.

Okay, I think I've been overcomplicating things. Let's use one of the connections to understand how the pushing actions work:

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft." - This means moving from pos34 to pos24 is going in the dirleft direction.

If the player is at pos44 and the stone is at pos34, precondition (iv) for the pushing action says the player should be able to move from their location to the stone's location using the direction. Here, the player can move from pos44 to pos34 using the direction dirleft.

Precondition (v) says the stone should be able to move from its location to the target location using the same direction. Here, the stone can move from pos34 to pos24 using the same direction dirleft.

Hence, if the player is at pos44 and the stone is at pos34, the player can push the stone from pos34 to pos24 using the direction dirleft.

I think I'm on the right track now. Let me try again.

So, if the player is at pos44 and the stone is at pos34, the player can push the stone from pos34 to pos24 using the direction dirleft. This doesn't mean the player is magically pulling the stone; it means the player is pushing the stone in the dirleft direction, which is towards pos24.

Alright, with this understanding, let's revisit the plan:

1. Move player from pos13 to pos44 (to be to the right of the stone at pos34):
   - move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright
   - move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
   - move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
   - move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown

2. Push stone from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft):
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos24 dirleft

3. Move player to get to pos23 (to the left of the stone at pos24):
   - move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
   - move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft

4. Push stone from pos24 to pos34 (dirright):
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos34 dirright

5. Push stone from pos34 to pos33 (dirleft, satisfying constraint 8):
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos33 dirleft

Hmm, actually I might have been going back and forth a bit. This is not easy to debug.

But I hope we're converging. One more try:

If player is at pos24 and stone is at pos34, the player can push the stone from pos34 to which position? If we follow the direction from pos24 to pos34 (which is dirright), and then apply the same direction to pos34, we'd get to pos44. So, player at pos24 can push the stone from pos34 to pos44.

Similarly, if player is at pos33 and stone is at pos34, the player can push the stone from pos34 to pos35. And, if player is at pos35 and stone is at pos34, the player can push the stone from pos34 to pos33.

Here's a plan based on this understanding:

1. Move player from pos13 to pos33 (to be to the left of the stone at pos34):
   - move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright
   - move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright

2. Push stone from pos34 to pos33 (dirup, satisfying constraint 8):
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos33 dirup

3. Move player to get to pos34 (to the right of the stone at pos33):
   - move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
   - move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
   - move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
   - move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown

4. Push stone from pos33 to pos43 (dirright):
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos43 dirright

5. Move player to pos54 (to satisfy constraint 4):
   - move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
   - move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
   - move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright

6. Return to pos43 (to be above the stone):
   - move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft
   - move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

Actually I'm really overthinking this. Let me step back. I think what has happened is I've gotten too caught up reasoning about a complex multi-step plan intuitively, without actually reasoning about each step individually, from a mechanical point of view based on the precise preconditions needed for an action to work.

Let's approach this problem systematically, creating a valid sequence of actions one by one.

Starting state:
- Player: pos13
- Stone: pos34
- Goal: pos51

From the constraints:
1. At some point, the stone must be at pos44.
2. The player must visit pos54 before the stone is at pos44.
3. There must be a state where the player is at pos21 and pos31 is not clear (likely meaning the stone is at pos31).
4. At some point, pos33 must be not clear (likely meaning the stone is at pos33).

To start, I'll focus on getting the stone to pos33 to satisfy constraint 8.

From pos13, I want to reach a position where I can push the stone at pos34 to pos33. Since my goal is to push the stone from pos34 to pos33 (which is in dirup direction), I need to be in a position where I can push the stone in that direction.

For that, the player needs to be at a position from where the stone's position can be reached by following the direction dirup. There aren't any connections to directly go from any position to pos34 in the dirup direction. But I can go from pos35 to pos34 in the dirup direction. So, I need to get the player to pos35 and then push the stone to pos33.

1. Move player to pos35:
   - move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
   - move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
   - move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
   - move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown

2. Push stone from pos34 to pos33:
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirup

3. Find a way to push the stone from pos33 to pos43 by navigating the player to a position where they can push in the dirright direction.
Looking at the connections, I see that I can go from pos32, which is to the left of pos33, to pos33 in the dirright direction. So, I can push the stone from pos33 to pos43 if the player is at pos32.

   - move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
   - move player1 pos24 pos23 dirleft
   - move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
   - move player1 pos33 pos32 dirleft

4. Push stone from pos33 to pos43:
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos43 dirright

5. Move player to pos54:
   - move player1 pos32 pos33 dirright
   - move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
   - move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
   - move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright

6. Find a way to push the stone from pos43 to pos44.
The player can push the stone from pos43 to pos44 if the player is at a position from where pos43 can be reached with direction dirdown. The player can go from pos42 to pos43 in the dirdown direction. So, player at pos42 can push the stone from pos43 to pos44.

   - move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft
   - move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
   - move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft

7. Push stone from pos43 to pos44 (satisfying constraint 3):
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirdown

8. Navigate to a position to push the stone from pos44 to pos43:
   - move player1 pos42 pos43 dirright
   - move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
   - move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown

9. Push stone from pos44 to pos43:
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirup

10. Navigate to a position to push the stone from pos43 to pos33:
    - move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
    - move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
    - move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
    - move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright
    - move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup

11. Push stone from pos43 to pos33:
    - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirleft

Wait, I'm making an error here. If I'm at pos53, I can't go dirleft to pos43 directly.

Let me check the connections:
"You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft."

Okay, so I can't move from pos53 to pos43 in the dirleft direction. I'd need to go from pos53 to pos52 (dirup), then to pos42 (dirleft), and then to pos43 (dirdown).

Let me restart with clearer thinking.

From the constraints, I need to:
1. Move the stone to pos33.
2. Move the stone to pos44, with the player having visited pos54 first.
3. Have the player at pos21 and the stone at pos31.
4. Eventually, move the stone to the goal at pos51.

Step 1: Move the stone to pos33.
For this, the agent needs to be in a position to push the stone from pos34 to pos33. Looking at the connections, pos33 can be reached from pos34 in the dirup direction. So, to push the stone in that direction, the player needs to be on the opposite side, which is pos35.

   - move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
   - move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
   - move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
   - move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirup

Step 2: Move the stone to pos44, with the player having visited pos54 first.
First, the player needs to visit pos54.

   - move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
   - move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright

Now, the player needs to push the stone from pos33 to pos44. Judging from the connections, the player first needs to get to pos32 to push the stone from pos33 to pos43, and then to pos42 to push it from pos43 to pos44.

   - move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft
   - move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
   - move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
   - move player1 pos24 pos23 dirleft
   - move player1 pos23 pos22 dirleft
   - move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos43 dirright
   - move player1 pos32 pos33 dirright
   - move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
   - move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirdown

Step 3: Have the player at pos21 and the stone at pos31.
I first need to move the stone from pos44 to pos31. Looking at the connections, I need to navigate and push step by step.

First, push the stone from pos44 to pos34.
   
   - move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
   - move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft
   - move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
   - move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
   - move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
   - move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
   - move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirleft

Next, push the stone from pos34 to pos33.
   
   - move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
   - move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirup

Next, push the stone from pos33 to pos32, and then to pos31.
   
   - move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
   - move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos32 dirleft
   - move player1 pos33 pos32 dirleft
   - move player1 pos32 pos33 dirright
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirleft

Now, move the player to pos21.
   
   - move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft
   - move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft

Step 4: Eventually, move the stone to the goal at pos51.
First, push the stone from pos31 to pos41, and then to pos51.
   
   - move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos31 pos41 dirright
   - move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
   - pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos41 pos51 dirright

Wait wait, I didn't check the preconditions for the pushtogoal action.

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if 
(i) agent p is at location l_p, 
(ii) stone s is at location l_from, 
(iii) location l_to is clear, 
(iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, 
(v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and 
(vi) location l_to is a goal location.

I need to check if I can go from pos31 to pos41 in the dirright direction and from pos41 to pos51 in the dirright direction.

Let's check the connections:
"You may move from location pos31 to location pos41 following direction dirright."
"You may move from location pos41 to location pos51 following direction dirright."
"pos51 is a goal location"

So yes, the pushtogoal action with these parameters should be valid.

Actually, let's re-check my entire plan to ensure it's valid:

1. The final action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos41 pos51 dirright. This should be valid.
2. Before that: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos31 pos41 dirright.
3. Before that: move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright.

That's fine.

Actually let's trace the entire action sequence, tracking player and stone positions at each step.

Starting: Player at pos13, Stone at pos34.

- move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown => Player at pos14, Stone at pos34.
- move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright => Player at pos24, Stone at pos34.
- move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright => Player at pos34, Stone at... wait, that's a contradiction. The player and stone can't be at the same location.

I need to be more careful.

Let me think again about how to get the player to a position where it can push the stone from pos34 to pos33. 

To push the stone from pos34 to pos33 (in the dirup direction), the player needs to be in a position from where pos34 can be reached by moving in the dirup direction. Based on the connections, pos34 can be reached from pos35 in the dirup direction. So, the player needs to be at pos35.

But can a player be at the same location as the stone? No, each location can either have the agent, a stone, or be empty.

Oh wait, I think I misinterpreted the grid. If pos34 means row 3, column 4, then the stone starts at (3, 4) and the player starts at (1, 3). The grid might look like this:

```
. . P . .
. . . . .
. . . S .
. . . . .
G . . . .
```

Where P is the player, S is the stone, and G is the goal.

In this configuration, the player can't directly push the stone from pos34 to pos33 because pos35 (to the right of the stone) is out of bounds. Actually I confused myself here because the grid is 5x5 so pos35 does exist. 

Let me trace the positions one final time:

Starting: Player at pos13, Stone at pos34.

1. Move player to pos35:
   - move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright => Player at pos23, Stone at pos34.
   - move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright => Player at pos33, Stone at pos34.
   - move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown => X Error! Player would be at pos34, Stone at pos34.

Ugh. ok, final restart.

The player is at pos13 (row 1, column 3), and the stone is at pos34 (row 3, column 4). Ok, let me think by considering row/column coordinates:
- dirright: Increase row index.
- dirleft: Decrease row index.
- dirdown: Increase column index.
- dirup: Decrease column index.

Now, to push the stone from (3, 4) to (3, 3) (to the left), the player needs to be on the opposite side, which is at (3, 5).

Let's walk through the steps to move the player from (1, 3) to (3, 5):

1. Move player to (3, 5):
   - move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright => Player at pos23 (2, 3), Stone at pos34 (3, 4).
   - move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright => Player at pos33 (3, 3), Stone at pos34 (3, 4).
   - move player1 pos33 pos35 dirdown => X Error! This doesn't work because the player can't jump over the stone. To move from (3, 3) to (3, 5), the player would need to pass through (3, 4), which is occupied by the stone.

Okay, let's think differently. The player needs to reach a position from where they can push the stone from (3, 4) to (3, 3) (to the left). The player can push the stone from (3, 4) to (3, 3) if the player is at (3, 5).

But the player can't directly get to (3, 5) from (1, 3) without moving over the stone, which isn't allowed.

But I think it's more like:

```
1 1 P 1 1
2 2 2 2 2
3 3 3 S 3
4 4 4 4 4
G 5 5 5 5
```

I believe the correct interpretation is:
- The player is at pos13 (position (1, 3)).
- The stone is at pos34 (position (3, 4)).
- The goal is at pos51 (position (5, 1)).

For this configuration, the player can move from (1, 3) down to (1, 4), then right to (2, 4), then right to (3, 5). From (3, 5), the player can push the stone from (3, 4) to (3, 3) (to the left).
