This is a Sokoban-style puzzle where I need to move a stone to a goal location while satisfying certain constraints. Let me analyze the problem:

1. We have a 5x5 grid with positions labeled pos11 through pos55.
2. The player (player1) is initially at pos35.
3. There's one stone (stone1) initially at pos24.
4. The goal is at pos15.
5. We need to get stone1 to the goal location.

Let me sketch the initial state of the grid:

```
1  []  []  []  []  [] (G)
2  []  []  []  [S] []
3  []  []  []  []  [P]
4  []  []  []  []  []
5  []  []  []  []  []
   1   2   3   4   5
```

Where:
- [P] represents player1 (at pos35)
- [S] represents stone1 (at pos24)
- (G) indicates the goal location (pos15)
- [] represents an empty space

Available actions:
1. Move the player in any of the four directions.
2. Push a stone to a goal location.
3. Push a stone to a non-goal location.

Now let's look at the constraints:
1. Location pos23 can be not clear in at most one continuous sequence of states.
2. stone1 needs to be at pos15 in at least one state.
3. Before stone1 can be at pos15, either pos12 must not be clear or stone1 must be at pos25.
4. player1 needs to be at pos24 in at least one state.
5. Before player1 can be at pos24, either stone1 must be at pos22 or pos44 must not be clear.
6. player1 needs to be at pos34 in at least one state.
7. Before player1 can be at pos34, player1 must be at pos23.
8. At some point, either stone1 must be at pos44 or pos21 must not be clear.
9. At some point, either pos42 or pos55 must not be clear.
10. At some point, pos15 must not be clear.
11. After pos15 is not clear, either pos53 must not be clear or player1 must be at pos45.

These constraints are complex, but essentially they're specifying a certain order of operations and states that must occur during the solution.

Given that the stone starts at pos24 and needs to reach the goal at pos15, the most direct path would be to push it upward (through pos23, pos22, pos21) and then to the goal (through pos14, pos15). However, we need to satisfy all the constraints along the way.

Let me plan out a solution:

1. First, I need to position player1 to push the stone. The player starts at pos35, and the stone is at pos24. So I need to move the player to pos34 to push the stone from below.
2. But wait, constraint 7 says that before player1 can be at pos34, player1 must be at pos23. So I need to position the player at pos23 first.
3. To get to pos23, the player can go: pos35 -> pos34 -> pos33 -> pos23.
4. From pos23, the player can go to pos34 (satisfying constraint 6 and 7).
5. From pos34, the player can push the stone from pos24 to pos14 (moving upward).
6. But constraint 5 says that before player1 can be at pos24, either stone1 must be at pos22 or pos44 must not be clear. So I need to ensure one of these conditions is met.
7. I might need to move the stone to pos22 first, then come back and push it towards the goal.

Let me try to trace a possible plan:

1. Move player1: pos35 -> pos34 -> pos33 -> pos23 (satisfying the precondition for constraint 7)
2. Move player1: pos23 -> pos24 (satisfying constraint 4, but I need to satisfy constraint 5 first)
3. Ah, I see the issue. I need to push the stone to pos22 first.

So let me try a different approach:

1. Move player1: pos35 -> pos34 -> pos33 -> pos32 -> pos22 -> pos23
2. From pos23, player1 can push the stone horizontally from pos24 to pos23 (and the stone will now be at pos23).
3. From pos23, player1 can push the stone upward to pos22 (satisfying the precondition for constraint 5).
4. Then player1 can go back to pos23 -> pos24 (now satisfying constraint 4 and 5).
5. Player1 can then go to pos34 (satisfying constraint 6 and 7).
6. From there, player1 can push the stone from pos22 to pos21.
7. Then to pos11, pos12, pos13, pos14, and finally pos15 (the goal).

Let me revise this plan to make sure it satisfies all constraints:

1. Constraint 1: "Location pos23 is not clear" can hold in at most one continuous sequence of states. This means we can only have the stone at pos23 for one continuous sequence of states.
2. Constraint 2: stone1 needs to be at pos15 in at least one state. This is the goal state.
3. Constraint 3: Before stone1 can be at pos15, either pos12 must not be clear or stone1 must be at pos25. We're planning to move the stone through pos12, so this constraint should be satisfied.
4. Constraint 4: player1 needs to be at pos24 in at least one state. This is part of our plan.
5. Constraint 5: Before player1 can be at pos24, either stone1 must be at pos22 or pos44 must not be clear. We're planning to move stone1 to pos22, so this constraint should be satisfied.
6. Constraint 6: player1 needs to be at pos34 in at least one state. This is part of our plan.
7. Constraint 7: Before player1 can be at pos34, player1 must be at pos23. This is part of our plan.
8. Constraint 8: At some point, either stone1 must be at pos44 or pos21 must not be clear. We're planning to move stone1 to pos21, so this constraint should be satisfied.
9. Constraint 9: At some point, either pos42 or pos55 must not be clear. This might be an issue with our current plan.
10. Constraint 10: At some point, pos15 must not be clear. This will be satisfied when stone1 reaches the goal.
11. Constraint 11: After pos15 is not clear, either pos53 must not be clear or player1 must be at pos45. This might be an issue with our current plan.

Let me refine the plan:

1. Move player1: pos35 -> pos45 (this might help with constraint 11)
2. Move player1: pos45 -> pos44 -> pos43 -> pos42 (this helps with constraint 9)
3. Move player1: pos42 -> pos32 -> pos33 -> pos23 (this is to position player1 to move the stone)
4. Player1 pushes stone1 from pos24 to pos23 (this is a "pushtonongoal" action)
5. Player1 pushes stone1 from pos23 to pos22 (this is a "pushtonongoal" action)
6. Move player1: pos23 -> pos24 (satisfying constraint 4 and 5)
7. Move player1: pos24 -> pos34 (satisfying constraint 6 and 7)
8. Move player1: pos34 -> pos33 -> pos32 -> pos22 -> pos21
9. Player1 pushes stone1 from pos22 to pos21 (this is a "pushtonongoal" action, satisfying constraint 8)
10. Move player1: pos22 -> pos21 -> pos11
11. Player1 pushes stone1 from pos21 to pos11 (this is a "pushtonongoal" action)
12. Move player1: pos21 -> pos11 -> pos12
13. Player1 pushes stone1 from pos11 to pos12 (this is a "pushtonongoal" action, helping satisfy constraint 3)
14. Move player1: pos11 -> pos12 -> pos13
15. Player1 pushes stone1 from pos12 to pos13 (this is a "pushtonongoal" action)
16. Move player1: pos12 -> pos13 -> pos14
17. Player1 pushes stone1 from pos13 to pos14 (this is a "pushtonongoal" action)
18. Move player1: pos13 -> pos14 -> pos15
19. Player1 pushes stone1 from pos14 to pos15 (this is a "pushtogoal" action, satisfying constraint 2 and 10)
20. Move player1: pos14 -> pos24 -> pos34 -> pos44 -> pos54 -> pos53 (this helps with constraint 11)

So after refining, I believe this plan should satisfy all constraints. Let me now specify the actual actions in the required format.

Wait, let me rethink this. The constraints are quite intricate and I want to make sure I'm understanding them correctly.

Constraint 3: "If stone1 is at location pos15, then there must be an earlier state where pos12 is not clear or stone1 is at pos25." This means before the stone reaches the goal, either the stone was at pos25 or pos12 was not clear (i.e., the stone or the player was there).

Constraint 5: "If player1 is at location pos24, then there must be an earlier state where stone1 is at pos22 or pos44 is not clear." This means before the player is at pos24, either the stone was at pos22 or pos44 was not clear.

Constraint 7: "If player1 is at location pos34, then there must be an earlier state where player1 is at pos23." This is straightforward.

Constraint 11: "If pos15 is not clear, then at the same state or a later state, either pos53 is not clear or player1 is at pos45." This means once the stone (or the player) is at pos15, making it not clear, then at the same or a later state, either pos53 is not clear or the player is at pos45.

Let me refine my plan with these understandings:

1. First, let's satisfy constraint 9. We need to make either pos42 or pos55 not clear. Given the initial positions, it's easier to move the player to pos42.
   - Move player1: pos35 -> pos45 -> pos44 -> pos43 -> pos42

2. Now, let's satisfy constraint 7 and 6. The player needs to be at pos23 before being at pos34.
   - Move player1: pos42 -> pos32 -> pos33 -> pos23
   - Move player1: pos23 -> pos33 -> pos34

3. To satisfy constraint 5, before the player is at pos24, either stone1 needs to be at pos22 or pos44 should not be clear. Let's make the stone be at pos22.
   - Move player1: pos34 -> pos24
   - Push stone1 from pos24 to pos23 (pushtonongoal)
   - Push stone1 from pos23 to pos22 (pushtonongoal)

4. Now satisfy constraint 4 by moving the player to pos24.
   - Move player1: pos23 -> pos24

5. To satisfy constraint 8, we need to make stone1 be at pos44 or pos21 not clear. Let's move the stone to pos21.
   - Move player1: pos24 -> pos23 -> pos22 -> pos21
   - Push stone1 from pos22 to pos21 (pushtonongoal)

6. To satisfy constraint 3, before stone1 is at pos15, either pos12 should not be clear or stone1 should be at pos25. Let's move the stone from pos21 to pos25 (via pos24).
   - Move player1: pos22 -> pos23 -> pos24 -> pos25
   - Move player1: pos25 -> pos24 -> pos23 -> pos22 -> pos21 -> pos11
   - Push stone1 from pos21 to pos11 (pushtonongoal)
   - Move player1: pos21 -> pos22 -> pos23 -> pos24 -> pos25 -> pos15
   - Move player1: pos15 -> pos14 -> pos13 -> pos12 -> pos11 -> pos21
   - Push stone1 from pos11 to pos21 (pushtonongoal)
   - Move player1: pos11 -> pos12 -> pos13 -> pos14 -> pos24
   - Push stone1 from pos21 to pos22 (pushtonongoal)
   - Move player1: pos21 -> pos22 -> pos23
   - Push stone1 from pos22 to pos23 (pushtonongoal)
   - Move player1: pos22 -> pos23 -> pos24
   - Push stone1 from pos23 to pos24 (pushtonongoal)
   - Move player1: pos23 -> pos24 -> pos25
   - Push stone1 from pos24 to pos25 (pushtonongoal)

7. Now let's move the stone from pos25 to the goal at pos15.
   - Move player1: pos24 -> pos23 -> pos22 -> pos21 -> pos11 -> pos12 -> pos13 -> pos14 -> pos15 -> pos25
   - Push stone1 from pos25 to pos15 (pushtogoal)

8. To satisfy constraint 11, after pos15 is not clear (which it is now because the stone is there), either pos53 should not be clear or player1 should be at pos45. Let's move the player to pos45.
   - Move player1: pos25 -> pos35 -> pos45

I believe this plan satisfies all the constraints. Let me now specify the actual actions in the required format.

Actually, I need to double-check the plan, especially because constraint 1 says that location pos23 can only be not clear for one continuous sequence of states. But my plan has the stone pass through pos23 multiple times. Let me refine the plan again.

After thinking about it, I realize I've been overcomplicating the solution. Let's try a more direct approach while still satisfying all constraints:

1. First, satisfy constraint 9 by moving the player to pos42.
   - Move player1: pos35 -> pos34 -> pos33 -> pos32 -> pos42

2. Move to satisfy constraints 7 and 6.
   - Move player1: pos42 -> pos32 -> pos33 -> pos23
   - Move player1: pos23 -> pos33 -> pos34

3. Satisfy constraint 5 by moving the stone to pos22 before the player is at pos24.
   - Move player1: pos34 -> pos24
   - Push stone1 from pos24 to pos23 (pushtonongoal)
   - Push stone1 from pos23 to pos22 (pushtonongoal)

4. Satisfy constraint 4 by moving the player to pos24.
   - Move player1: pos23 -> pos24

5. To satisfy constraint 8, move the stone to pos21.
   - Move player1: pos24 -> pos23 -> pos22 -> pos21
   - Push stone1 from pos22 to pos21 (pushtonongoal)

6. Now move the stone to pos11, then pos12 (satisfying part of constraint 3), then to the goal.
   - Move player1: pos22 -> pos21 -> pos11
   - Push stone1 from pos21 to pos11 (pushtonongoal)
   - Move player1: pos21 -> pos22 -> pos12
   - Push stone1 from pos11 to pos12 (pushtonongoal)
   - Move player1: pos11 -> pos12 -> pos13
   - Push stone1 from pos12 to pos13 (pushtonongoal)
   - Move player1: pos12 -> pos13 -> pos14
   - Push stone1 from pos13 to pos14 (pushtonongoal)
   - Move player1: pos13 -> pos14 -> pos15
   - Push stone1 from pos14 to pos15 (pushtogoal) - This satisfies constraints 2 and 10.

7. Satisfy constraint 11 by moving the player to pos45 after pos15 is not clear.
   - Move player1: pos14 -> pos24 -> pos34 -> pos44 -> pos45

This should satisfy all constraints. Let me now specify the actual actions in the required format.

Actually, one more time. Let's make sure I have the most efficient plan. I notice a couple of inefficiencies in my previous plan. Let me revise:

1. Move player1 to pos42 to satisfy constraint 9.
   - move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup
   - move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
   - move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
   - move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright

2. Move player1 to pos23 and then to pos34 to satisfy constraints 7 and 6.
   - move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
   - move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
   - move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
   - move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
   - move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown

3. Move player1 to pos24 and push the stone to pos22 to satisfy constraint 5.
   - move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos24 pos23 dirleft
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirleft

4. Move player1 to pos24 to satisfy constraint 4.
   - move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown

5. Push the stone to pos21 to satisfy constraint 8.
   - move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
   - move player1 pos23 pos22 dirleft
   - move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos21 dirup

6. Move the stone to the goal while passing through pos12 to satisfy constraint 3.
   - move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos21 pos11 dirleft
   - move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown
   - move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos11 pos12 dirdown
   - move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos12 pos13 dirdown
   - move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos13 pos14 dirdown
   - move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
   - pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos14 pos15 dirdown

7. Move player1 to pos45 to satisfy constraint 11.
   - move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
   - move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
   - move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
   - move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown

This looks like a more efficient plan. Let me now specify the actual actions in the required format, double checking the preconditions for each action to ensure that they are met.

Actually, I notice I didn't set up the precondition for the first push correctly. Let me step back and check each action to ensure preconditions are properly met.

1. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup
   - Is player1 at pos35? Yes (initial state)
   - Is pos34 clear? Yes (initial state)
   - Can you move from pos35 to pos34 following dirup? Yes (based on the "You may move from..." statements)

2. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
   - Is player1 at pos34? Yes (after the previous action)
   - Is pos33 clear? Yes (initial state)
   - Can you move from pos34 to pos33 following dirup? Yes

And so on...

But for the push actions, I need to be careful:
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos24 pos23 dirleft
   - Is player1 at pos24? Yes (after previous moves)
   - Is stone1 at pos24? Yes (initial state)
   - Is pos23 clear? Yes (initial state)
   - Can you move from pos24 to pos24 following dirleft? No (the action doesn't match the precondition)

Actually, there's a problem with how I formatted the push actions. Let me check the action definitions again to ensure I have it right:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.
   - agent p is at location l_p
   - stone s is at location l_from
   - location l_to is clear
   - you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d
   - you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d
   - location l_to is a goal location

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to non-goal location l_to, following direction d.
   - agent p is at location l_p
   - stone s is at location l_from
   - location l_to is clear
   - you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d
   - you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d
   - location l_to is not a goal location

So for pushing the stone at position pos24 to pos23, the formatting should be:
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos24 pos23 dirleft
   - agent player1 is at location pos24 (after previous moves)
   - stone stone1 is at location pos24 (initial state)
   - location pos23 is clear (initial state)
   - you can get from location pos24 to pos24 following dirleft... wait, this doesn't make sense.

Ah, it seems like the agent only needs to be adjacent to the stone to push it, not necessarily behind it in the direction of the push. Let me revisit the action descriptions.

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.
   - agent p is at location l_p
   - stone s is at location l_from
   - location l_to is clear
   - you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d
   - you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d
   - location l_to is a goal location

So the agent needs to be at a position l_p, and it should be able to move from l_p to l_from following direction d. Then, the stone s at l_from is pushed to l_to.

Let me try again with the correct preconditions:

1. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup
2. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
3. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
4. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright
5. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
6. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
7. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
8. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
9. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
10. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
    - At this point, we need to push the stone. But there seems to be a misunderstanding in my earlier interpretation.

For the push actions, `l_p` is the position of the agent before the push and `l_from` is the position of the stone. The agent needs to be able to move from `l_p` to `l_from` following `d`, and the stone (at `l_from`) can be pushed to `l_to` following `d`. This means the agent should be adjacent to the stone in the direction opposite to the push direction.

Let me go through the plan again more carefully.

1. The player is at pos35 and the stone is at pos24.
2. To push the stone from pos24 to pos23 (leftward), the player needs to be at pos25.
3. So we first need to move the player to pos25, then push the stone.

Let's take it step by step:

1. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup
2. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
3. move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown

Since the action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos24 pos23 dirleft" means:
- player1 is at pos25
- stone1 is at pos24
- you can move from pos25 to pos24 following dirleft
- you can move from pos24 to pos23 following dirleft

This checks out since:
- player1 is at pos25 (after 3rd action)
- stone1 is at pos24 (initial state)
- you can move from pos25 to pos24 following dirleft (based on "You may move from..." statements)
- you can move from pos24 to pos23 following dirleft (based on "You may move from..." statements)

Let me revise my plan:

1. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup
2. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
3. move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown
4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos24 pos23 dirleft
5. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirleft
6. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
7. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
8. move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright
9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos22 dirup

But wait, this isn't right either. Let me re-understand the actions:

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to non-goal location l_to, following direction d.
p is the agent (player1)
s is the stone (stone1)
l_p is the location of the agent (e.g., pos25)
l_from is the location of the stone (e.g., pos24)
l_to is the destination of the stone (e.g., pos23)
d is the direction (e.g., dirleft)

Preconditions:
   - agent p is at location l_p
   - stone s is at location l_from
   - location l_to is clear
   - you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d
   - you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d
   - location l_to is not a goal location

So, if the agent is at pos25 and the stone is at pos24, to push the stone to pos23, the direction must be dirleft since that's how you'd move from pos24 to pos23. The agent being at pos25 and moving from pos25 to pos24 following dirleft is also consistent.

Let me revise my plan with this understanding. But this time I'll make sure each action satisfies its preconditions.

Let me formulate a plan to push stone1 to the goal location (pos15):

1. Move player1 to pos25:
   - move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft

2. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos23:
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos24 pos23 dirleft

3. Move player1 to pos13:
   - move player1 pos24 pos23 dirleft
   - move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft

4. Move player1 to pos22:
   - move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
   - move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright

5. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos22:
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos22 dirup

6. Move player1 to pos12:
   - move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
   - move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup

7. Move player1 to pos21:
   - move player1 pos12 pos11 dirleft
   - move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright

8. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos21:
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos21 dirup

   With this action, stone1 is at pos21, satisfying constraint 8.

9. Move player1 to pos11:
   - move player1 pos22 pos11 dirleft

10. Push stone1 from pos21 to pos11:
    - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos21 pos11 dirleft

11. Move player1 to pos12:
    - move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown
    - move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft

12. Push stone1 from pos11 to pos12:
    - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos11 pos12 dirdown

   With stone1 at pos12, we're satisfying part of constraint 3.

13. Move player1 to pos13:
    - move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
    - move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown

14. Push stone1 from pos12 to pos13:
    - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos13 dirdown

15. Move player1 to pos14:
    - move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
    - move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown

16. Push stone1 from pos13 to pos14:
    - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos14 dirdown

17. Move player1 to pos15:
    - move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
    - move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown

18. Push stone1 from pos14 to pos15:
    - pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos15 pos14 pos15 dirdown

   With stone1 at pos15, we satisfy constraint 2 and 10.

19. Move player1 to pos45 to satisfy constraint 11:
    - move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
    - move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
    - move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
    - move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown

Wait, I missed satisfying constraint 9, which requires either pos42 or pos55 to not be clear at some point. Let me revise the plan to ensure this:

1. Move player1 to pos42 first:
   - move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup
   - move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
   - move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
   - move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright

   With player1 at pos42, constraint 9 is satisfied.

2. Now move player1 to pos25:
   - move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
   - move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
   - move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
   - move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
   - move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown

Actually, I still have to ensure the constraint "player1 is at pos24" and the constraint "Before player1 can be at pos24, either stone1 must be at pos22 or pos44 must not be clear." Let me double-check my plan:

1. Move player1 to pos42 to satisfy constraint 9:
   - move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup
   - move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
   - move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
   - move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright

2. Move player1 to pos44 to ensure pos44 is not clear, which is one of the required preconditions for constraint 5:
   - move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
   - move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown

3. Move player1 to pos25:
   - move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
   - move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
   - move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown

4. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos23:
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos24 pos23 dirleft

5. Move player1 to pos24, satisfying constraint 4 (and constraint 5 because pos44 was not clear earlier):
   - move player1 pos24 pos24 dirdown

Actually, I can't move player1 from pos24 to pos24, so I'll have to revise:

5. Move player1 to pos24, satisfying constraint 4 (and constraint 5 because pos44 was not clear earlier):
   - move player1 pos24 pos23 dirleft
   - move player1 pos23 pos24 dirright

6. Move player1 to pos23:
   - move player1 pos24 pos23 dirleft

   player1 is at pos23, satisfying the precondition for constraint 7.

7. Move player1 to pos34, satisfying constraint 6 (and constraint 7 because player1 was at pos23 earlier):
   - move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
   - move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown

Now, the rest of the plan should proceed as before.

8. Move player1 to pos13:
   - move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
   - move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
   - move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft

9. Move player1 to pos22:
   - move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
   - move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright

10. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos22:
    - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos22 dirup

11. Move player1 to pos21:
    - move player1 pos23 pos22 dirleft
    - move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup

12. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos21, satisfying constraint 8:
    - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos21 dirup

13. Move player1 to pos11:
    - move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
    - move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft

14. Push stone1 from pos21 to pos11:
    - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos21 pos11 dirleft

15. Move player1 to pos12:
    - move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown
    - move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft

16. Push stone1 from pos11 to pos12, helping satisfy constraint 3:
    - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos11 pos12 dirdown

17. Move player1 to pos13:
    - move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
    - move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown

18. Push stone1 from pos12 to pos13:
    - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos13 dirdown

19. Move player1 to pos14:
    - move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
    - move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown

20. Push stone1 from pos13 to pos14:
    - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos14 dirdown

21. Move player1 to pos15:
    - move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
    - move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown

22. Push stone1 from pos14 to pos15, satisfying constraints 2 and 10:
    - pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos15 pos14 pos15 dirdown

23. Move player1 to pos45 to satisfy constraint 11:
    - move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
    - move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
    - move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
    - move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown

I think this plan is comprehensive and satisfies all the constraints. Let me double-check:

- Constraint 1: "Location pos23 is not clear" can hold in at most one continuous sequence of states. In my plan, pos23 is only not clear when stone1 is pushed there, which happens only once. So this constraint is satisfied.
- Constraint 2: stone1 needs to be at pos15 in at least one state. This is satisfied at the end of the plan.
- Constraint 3: Before stone1 can be at pos15, either pos12 must not be clear or stone1 must be at pos25. In my plan, stone1 passes through pos12, making it not clear. So this constraint is satisfied.
- Constraint 4: player1 needs to be at pos24 in at least one state. This is satisfied in the plan.
- Constraint 5: Before player1 can be at pos24, either stone1 must be at pos22 or pos44 must not be clear. In my plan, pos44 is not clear when player1 is there. So this constraint is satisfied.
- Constraint 6: player1 needs to be at pos34 in at least one state. This is satisfied in the plan.
- Constraint 7: Before player1 can be at pos34, player1 must be at pos23. This is satisfied in the plan.
- Constraint 8: At some point, either stone1 must be at pos44 or pos21 must not be clear. In my plan, stone1 is at pos21, so this constraint is satisfied.
- Constraint 9: At some point, either pos42 or pos55 must not be clear. In my plan, player1 is at pos42, making it not clear. So this constraint is satisfied.
- Constraint 10: At some point, pos15 must not be clear. This is satisfied at the end of the plan when stone1 is at pos15.
- Constraint 11: After pos15 is not clear, either pos53 must not be clear or player1 must be at pos45. In my plan, after stone1 is at pos15, player1 moves to pos45. So this constraint is satisfied.

All constraints are satisfied! Here's the final plan:
