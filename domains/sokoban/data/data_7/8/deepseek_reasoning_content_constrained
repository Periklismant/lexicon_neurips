Okay, let's try to figure out this planning problem. So the goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. The only goal location mentioned is pos15. So the final state needs stone1 at pos15. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy along the way. Let's start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

First, initial state: player1 is at pos35, stone1 is at pos24. All other locations are clear except pos24 (since the stone is there) and pos35 (player is there). The goal locations are pos15. So the main task is to move stone1 from pos24 to pos15.

But there are several constraints. Let's list them out:

1. pos23 can be non-clear in at most one continuous sequence. So if the stone or the agent is in pos23, it can't be for too long, maybe just once.

2. At least one state must have stone1 at pos15. That's our main goal.

3. If stone1 is at pos15 in some state, there must be an earlier state where either pos12 is not clear or stone1 was at pos25. So before moving stone1 to pos15, we need to have either pos12 occupied (maybe by the agent or another stone, but there's only one stone here) or have stone1 pass through pos25.

4. The agent must be at pos24 in at least one state. And when that happens, there must have been an earlier state where stone1 was at pos22 or pos44 is not clear. But stone1 starts at pos24, so getting it to pos22 would require moving it left. But pos44 is initially clear. So maybe the agent needs to move through pos44 first? Not sure yet.

5. The agent must be at pos34 in at least one state, and before that, they must have been at pos23. So the agent needs to go from pos23 to pos34.

6. At least one state where stone1 is at pos44 or pos21 is not clear. Since pos21 starts clear, maybe the agent has to move through pos21, making it not clear. Or move stone1 to pos44, which is a non-goal location. But the stone needs to end up at pos15, so moving it to pos44 might complicate things.

7. At least one state where pos42 or pos55 is not clear. Both start clear. So the agent or the stone has to be there. Since stone1 is the only stone, pos42 would need the agent to be there, or pos55. But pos55 is a non-goal location, so moving the stone there isn't helpful. So maybe the agent has to go to pos42 or pos55.

8. At least one state where pos15 is not clear. Since the stone needs to end up there, when we push it to pos15, pos15 will be not clear. But we need this to happen, and then ensure that after that, either pos53 is not clear or the agent is at pos45. Since pos53 starts clear, maybe the agent needs to go to pos45 after moving the stone to pos15.

So the main steps are: move the agent from pos35 to pos24, then push the stone towards pos15. But there are a lot of constraints to satisfy along the way.

Let me try to map out a path. The stone is at pos24. To get it to pos15, which is in the top right corner (assuming pos15 is (1,5)), the agent needs to push it up or right. But the movement directions might be tricky.

Wait, the grid positions: pos11 is (1,1), pos15 is (1,5). So pos24 is (2,4). The goal is pos15 (1,5). So the stone needs to move from (2,4) to (1,5). The agent starts at pos35 (3,5). So the agent is at (3,5). The stone is at (2,4). The agent needs to get to a position where they can push the stone.

Looking at the allowed movements. From pos24, the stone is at (2,4). To push it to pos15 (1,5), the agent would need to be adjacent to the stone in a direction that allows pushing towards the goal. Let's see the possible directions. pos24 is connected to pos14 (up), pos34 (right), pos23 (left), pos25 (down). Wait, the movement directions might vary. Let me check the movement possibilities.

Looking at the movement connections:

From pos24, you can move to pos14 (dirup?), pos34 (dirright?), pos23 (dirleft?), pos25 (dirdown). So the directions are up, right, left, down. Wait, the movement directions are given as "You may move from location pos24 to location pos14 following direction dirleft?" Wait, no, looking back:

Wait, the movement connections are listed. For example, "You may move from location pos24 to location pos14 following direction dirleft". Wait, maybe I need to check the exact movement directions for each location.

Wait, the original state lists the movement connections. Let's look for pos24:

The movement from pos24:

- "You may move from location pos24 to location pos14 following direction dirleft" → so from pos24, moving left (dirleft) takes you to pos14? Or is the direction dependent on the grid? Wait, perhaps the directions are relative. For example, moving from pos24 to pos14 would require moving up (since pos14 is row 1, column4, while pos24 is row 2, column4). So direction dirup. But the given movement says direction dirleft. Hmm, this might be a bit confusing. Let me check the specific connections.

Looking at the movement for pos24:

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos14 following direction dirleft"

Wait, pos24 is (2,4). pos14 is (1,4). So moving from (2,4) to (1,4) is up, but the direction is dirleft. That's strange. Maybe the direction names don't correspond to the actual grid movement. So perhaps direction names are arbitrary? Or maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, maybe the directions are dirup, dirdown, dirleft, dirright as per standard grid movement. But according to the movement entries, for example:

For pos14:

"You may move from location pos14 to location pos24 following direction dirdown"

So pos14 to pos24 is down, which makes sense. Then pos24 to pos14 would be up, but according to the given movement, it's dirleft. That's conflicting. Wait, the entry says:

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos14 following direction dirleft"

But pos24 to pos14 is moving up (row decreases by 1). So direction dirleft here is probably a typo, but according to the problem statement, we have to take the given connections as they are. So even if the direction name doesn't match the actual grid movement, we have to use the directions as specified.

So for example, moving from pos24 to pos14 is done via dirleft. That might be the case. So the directions are part of the movement graph as given, regardless of their names. So the actual directions (dirleft, dirright, etc.) are labels for allowed movement edges between locations. So even if moving from pos24 to pos14 is dirleft, even though in grid terms that's up, we have to follow that.

This complicates planning because we can't assume directions correspond to grid movement. We need to use the given movement connections as per the problem description.

So the agent's movement is constrained by these allowed direction moves. So first, we need to map out how the agent can move from their starting position (pos35) to pos24 to push the stone.

The agent starts at pos35. Let's look at the movement options from pos35.

From the original state:

"You may move from location pos35 to location pos25 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos35 to location pos45 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos35 to location pos34 following direction dirup"

So from pos35, the agent can go to pos25 (dirleft), pos45 (dirright), or pos34 (dirup).

The stone is at pos24. So to push the stone, the agent needs to be in a position adjacent to the stone in a direction that allows pushing. For example, to push the stone from pos24 to pos14, the agent would need to be at pos24, but wait, the preconditions for push actions require that the agent is at l_p, and the stone is at l_from. Then the agent can push the stone from l_from to l_to via direction d, which must be a valid movement from l_from to l_to.

Wait, the preconditions for pushtogoal and pushtonongoal:

For "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d", the agent must be at l_p, stone at l_from, l_to is clear, and you can move from l_p to l_from via direction d, and from l_from to l_to via direction d. Also, l_to must be a goal location.

So for example, if the agent is at pos34 (l_p), stone is at pos24 (l_from), and there's a direction d that allows moving from pos34 to pos24, and from pos24 to l_to (which must be a goal location, i.e., pos15). Wait, pos24 to pos15: looking at the movement connections from pos24:

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos25 following direction dirdown"

But pos25 is not a goal. The only goal is pos15. So how to get the stone from pos24 to pos15.

Alternatively, maybe we need to move the stone step by step. Let's see:

From pos24, possible moves (based on given directions):

- pos24 can go to pos14 (dirleft), pos34 (dirright), pos23 (dirup?), or pos25 (dirdown). Wait, according to the original state's movement connections for pos24:

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos14 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos34 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos23 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos25 following direction dirdown"

So directions from pos24: dirleft to pos14, dirright to pos34, dirup to pos23, dirdown to pos25.

So the stone is at pos24. To push it towards pos15 (which is pos15's location is (1,5)), we need to get it to pos15. How?

From pos24, moving dirleft takes it to pos14 (row 1, column4). Then from pos14, can we move it further? pos14's movement options:

From pos14, you can move to pos24 (dirright?), but according to the problem's movement list:

"You may move from location pos14 to location pos24 following direction dirright"

Wait, but pos14 to pos24 is row 2, column4. So that's down. But the direction is dirright. So again, directions are not aligned with grid movement.

So from pos14, the possible moves are:

- dirright to pos24 (but that's back where the stone was)

- dirup to pos13 (since "You may move from location pos14 to location pos13 following direction dirup")

- dirdown to pos15 ("You may move from location pos14 to location pos15 following direction dirdown")

Ah! So from pos14, moving dirdown takes you to pos15. So if the stone is at pos14, pushing it dirdown would take it to pos15, which is a goal. So that's a possible path.

So the plan could be:

1. Move the agent from pos35 to pos34 (dirup), since pos35 can move to pos34 via dirup.

2. Then push the stone from pos24 to pos14 using pushtonongoal (since pos14 is not a goal). Wait, no, pos14 is not a goal. Wait, pos15 is the goal. So to get the stone to pos15, we need to push it from pos14 to pos15. So first, get the stone to pos14, then push it to pos15.

But how to get the stone to pos14. Let's see.

The stone is at pos24. The agent needs to push it to pos14. To do that, the agent must be at a location l_p such that there's a direction d allowing movement from l_p to pos24 (stone's current location), and from pos24 to pos14 via the same direction d. Because in the push action, the direction d must allow moving from l_p to l_from (pos24) and from l_from (pos24) to l_to (pos14). So the direction d must be such that both movements are allowed.

Looking at the movement from pos24 to pos14: direction is dirleft. So for the agent to push the stone from pos24 to pos14 using dirleft, the agent must be at a location l_p that can move to pos24 via dirleft. So looking for l_p such that moving dirleft from l_p leads to pos24.

Wait, the movement connections are given. Let's check which locations can move to pos24 via dirleft.

Looking through the movement list:

Looking for entries where moving dirleft leads to pos24.

Searching the list:

For example, "You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft".

Yes: "You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft".

So if the agent is at pos34, they can move dirleft to pos24. Therefore, if the agent is at pos34, they can perform a push action to move the stone from pos24 to pos14 via dirleft.

So the steps would be:

1. Move agent from pos35 to pos34 (dirup). That's allowed because pos35 can move to pos34 via dirup, and pos34 is clear.

Action: move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup.

After this, the agent is at pos34, pos35 becomes clear.

2. Now, the agent is at pos34. The stone is at pos24. The agent can push the stone from pos24 to pos14 via dirleft.

But wait, pos14 is not a goal, so we have to use pushtonongoal. But pos14 is not a goal, so that's correct. But we need to eventually get the stone to pos15, which is a goal. So after moving the stone to pos14, we need to push it again to pos15.

But first, let's push from pos24 to pos14.

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos14 dirleft.

After this, the agent moves from pos34 to pos24, the stone moves to pos14. The agent is now at pos24, and pos34 is clear.

But pos14 is now occupied by the stone. Then, we need to push the stone from pos14 to pos15. Since pos15 is a goal, we can use pushtogoal.

To do that, the agent needs to be at a location l_p that can move to pos14 via a direction d, and pos14 can move to pos15 via the same d. Looking at pos14's movement:

From pos14, moving dirdown takes you to pos15. So direction d is dirdown.

So the agent needs to be at a location that can move to pos14 via dirdown. Let's check which locations can move to pos14 via dirdown.

Looking at the movement list:

Looking for "You may move from location X to pos14 following direction dirdown".

Searching the list:

"You may move from location pos13 to location pos14 following direction dirdown".

So pos13 can move to pos14 via dirdown.

But the agent is currently at pos24. How to get to pos13?

Path from pos24 to pos13. Let's see:

pos24's movement options:

From pos24, the agent can move to pos14 (dirleft), pos34 (dirright), pos23 (dirup), pos25 (dirdown). But after pushing the stone to pos14, the agent is at pos24. So from pos24, the agent can move to pos23 (dirup), which is allowed if pos23 is clear. Initially, pos23 is clear. But after the first push, is pos23 still clear? Let's check.

After the first push (pushtonongoal), the stone is at pos14, and the agent is at pos24. So pos23 is still clear. So the agent can move from pos24 to pos23 via dirup.

Wait, movement from pos24 to pos23 is via dirup. So action: move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup.

But after that, the agent is at pos23, which is clear. Then, from pos23, can they move towards pos13?

Looking at pos23's movement options:

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos33 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos22 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos24 following direction dirdown"

Wait, pos23 to pos13 via dirleft. So the agent can move from pos23 to pos13 via dirleft, assuming pos13 is clear. Since the stone is at pos14, pos13 should still be clear.

So steps after pushing to pos14:

3. Move agent from pos24 to pos23 via dirup.

Action: move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup.

4. Then move from pos23 to pos13 via dirleft.

Action: move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft.

Now the agent is at pos13. From here, they can push the stone from pos14 to pos15 using dirdown, since pos14 to pos15 is via dirdown.

But to push, the agent must be at a location l_p that can move to pos14 via dirdown. pos13 can move to pos14 via dirdown. Let's check:

Looking at pos13's movement:

"You may move from location pos13 to location pos23 following direction dirup"

Wait, looking for movement from pos13 to pos14. According to the original state's movement list:

"You may move from location pos13 to location pos14 following direction dirdown".

Yes: "You may move from location pos13 to location pos14 following direction dirdown".

So the agent is at pos13. The stone is at pos14. The agent can perform pushtogoal (since pos15 is a goal) by pushing from pos14 to pos15 via dirdown.

So action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown.

After this action, the agent moves from pos13 to pos14, the stone moves to pos15. Now, the stone is at the goal pos15, satisfying the main goal. 

But we also need to check all constraints.

Now, let's check the constraints:

1. pos23 can be non-clear in at most one continuous sequence. When the agent moves through pos23 (step 3), pos23 becomes non-clear. Then in step 4, they move away, so pos23 is clear again. So it's only non-clear once, which is allowed.

2. The stone is at pos15 in the final state, so that's covered.

3. The constraint says that if stone1 is at pos15, there must be an earlier state where pos12 is not clear or stone1 was at pos25. In our plan, stone1 goes from pos24 → pos14 → pos15. It never went to pos25, so we need to ensure that pos12 was not clear at some point. But in the initial state, pos12 is clear. So how can pos12 be not clear? The agent must have been there. So maybe our current plan doesn't satisfy this constraint. Oops, this is a problem.

Ah, right. So the plan as I outlined would fail because the third constraint requires that before stone1 is at pos15, there must be a state where either pos12 is not clear or stone1 was at pos25. In the current plan, stone1 never goes to pos25, and pos12 remains clear. So this constraint is not met. So we need to adjust the plan.

So we need to either have the agent occupy pos12 (making it not clear) before moving the stone to pos15, or have the stone pass through pos25. Since moving the stone to pos25 would take it further away from the goal, but maybe it's necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps during the agent's movement, they can pass through pos12, making it non-clear, which would satisfy the constraint.

So let's think: how can the agent reach pos13 in such a way that they pass through pos12. Let's see the movement possibilities.

Alternatively, perhaps after pushing the stone to pos14, instead of moving the agent through pos23 and pos13, maybe find another path where the agent goes through pos12.

Wait, after pushing the stone to pos14, the agent is at pos24. Then, to get to a position to push the stone to pos15, perhaps the agent can move up to pos23, then left to pos22, up to pos12, then down to pos13, etc. But that's a longer path. But maybe necessary to hit pos12.

Alternatively, maybe during the initial movement from pos35 to pos34, then to pos24, but that's the same as before.

Wait, let's think of another approach. Suppose the agent first moves to pos25, then to pos24, pushing the stone to pos25, then to pos15. But pos25 is not a goal, so that's not helpful. But if the stone is at pos25, then pushing it to pos15 (which is a goal) would require moving up from pos25 to pos15. Let's check the movement from pos25:

From pos25, can you move to pos15? The movement list says:

"You may move from location pos25 to location pos15 following direction dirleft".

Yes: "You may move from location pos25 to location pos15 following direction dirleft".

So if the stone is at pos25, the agent can be at pos25's adjacent location in the direction that allows pushing to pos15. Wait, but the agent would need to be at a location that can move to pos25 via direction dirleft, then push the stone to pos15 via dirleft. Let's see:

For example, if the stone is at pos25, the agent could be at pos35 (since pos35 can move to pos25 via dirleft). Then pushing the stone from pos25 to pos15 via dirleft. But pos35 is the starting position. Wait, the agent starts at pos35. So if the stone is at pos25, the agent could push it to pos15 from pos25.

But how to get the stone to pos25. From pos24, moving dirdown takes it to pos25. So maybe:

Alternative plan:

1. Move agent from pos35 to pos34 (dirup).

2. Push stone from pos24 to pos25 via dirdown. But pos25 is a non-goal, so use pushtonongoal.

3. Then, move agent from pos25 (where they end up after pushing) to pos35 (dirright?), then push the stone from pos25 to pos15 via dirleft.

But let's check the steps:

1. Move player1 from pos35 to pos34 (dirup).

2. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos25 via dirdown. So the agent is at pos34, needs to move to pos24 via dirdown? Wait, no. Wait, the agent is at pos34. To push the stone from pos24 to pos25 via dirdown, the agent must be at a location l_p that can move to pos24 via dirdown. Let's see:

Wait, the direction for the push is dirdown. So from pos24, moving dirdown is to pos25. So for the agent to push the stone from pos24 to pos25 via dirdown, the agent must be at a location l_p that can move to pos24 via dirdown. Let's check which locations can move to pos24 via dirdown.

Looking at the movement list:

Searching for "You may move from location X to pos24 following direction dirdown".

Found: "You may move from location pos23 to location pos24 following direction dirdown".

So the agent must be at pos23 to push the stone from pos24 to pos25 via dirdown. But how to get to pos23 from pos34.

Hmm, this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the agent can take a different path.

Alternatively, move from pos35 to pos25 (dirleft), then push the stone from pos24 to pos25 via dirdown. But how?

Wait, from pos35, the agent can move to pos25 via dirleft. But wait, the movement from pos35 is:

"You may move from location pos35 to location pos25 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos35 to location pos45 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos35 to location pos34 following direction dirup"

So yes, agent can move from pos35 to pos25 via dirleft.

So initial steps:

1. Move player1 from pos35 to pos25 (dirleft). Now, pos35 is clear, agent is at pos25.

But the stone is at pos24. To push it to pos25, the agent must be adjacent to pos24 in a direction that allows pushing. For example, the agent can move to pos24's adjacent locations.

But pos25 is below pos24 (since pos24 is (2,4), pos25 is (2,5)). So to push from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown), the agent must be at pos24's location, but that's where the stone is. Wait, no. Wait, the agent must be at a location l_p that can move to pos24 via direction d, and the stone can be pushed from pos24 to pos25 via the same direction d.

So for direction dirdown, the agent must be at a location that can move to pos24 via dirdown. Which is pos23 (as per the movement list: pos23 can move to pos24 via dirdown). So agent needs to be at pos23 to push the stone from pos24 to pos25 via dirdown.

So from pos25, how to get to pos23:

pos25's movement options:

"You may move from location pos25 to location pos15 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos25 to location pos35 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos25 to location pos24 following direction dirup"

So agent at pos25 can move to pos24 via dirup. But pos24 has the stone, so it's not clear. So cannot move there.

Alternatively, agent can move from pos25 to pos35 (dirright), but that's back to starting position.

Alternatively, agent could move from pos25 to pos15 via dirleft, but pos15 is clear. So:

1. Move agent from pos35 to pos25 (dirleft).

Now, agent is at pos25. Then, they can't move to pos24 because it's occupied by the stone. So they need to find another path to pos23.

From pos25, the agent can't reach pos23 directly. So maybe this approach isn't feasible.

Alternative idea: Use the original plan but include a step where the agent moves through pos12 to satisfy the constraint.

In the original plan, after pushing the stone to pos14, the agent is at pos24. Then they move to pos23 (dirup), then to pos13 (dirleft), then push to pos15. But this doesn't involve pos12. So to satisfy the constraint that before stone1 is at pos15, pos12 was not clear or stone1 was at pos25, we need to insert a step where the agent is at pos12.

So maybe after moving to pos13, before pushing to pos15, the agent moves to pos12, making pos12 not clear.

But how to get from pos13 to pos12. Let's check pos13's movement:

"You may move from location pos13 to location pos23 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos13 to location pos12 following direction dirup"

Wait, looking at the movement list:

"You may move from location pos13 to location pos12 following direction dirup".

Yes. So from pos13, the agent can move to pos12 via dirup.

So modified plan:

After step 4 (agent at pos13), add:

5. Move player1 from pos13 to pos12 (dirup). Now pos12 is not clear.

6. Then move back to pos13 (dirdown). Because to push the stone from pos14 to pos15, the agent needs to be at pos13.

So steps:

1. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup

2. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos14 dirleft

3. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup

4. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft

5. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup

6. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown

7. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown

Now, in this plan, step5 makes pos12 not clear, satisfying the third constraint (there's an earlier state where pos12 is not clear before stone1 is at pos15). Also, step7 is the final push.

But this adds more steps. However, the problem requires an optimal plan with minimal length. So this approach adds two more steps (steps 5 and 6), which may not be optimal.

Alternative approach: Find a way to have the agent pass through pos12 earlier in the plan.

Let me think: After the initial push to pos14, the agent is at pos24. Maybe instead of going through pos23 and pos13, the agent can move to pos25, then to pos15, but that may not help. Alternatively, find a path from pos24 to pos12.

But pos24 to pos12 would require moving through multiple steps. For example:

From pos24, the agent can move to pos23 (dirup), then to pos22 (dirup), then to pos12 (dirleft). Let's see:

pos24 → pos23 (dirup)

pos23 → pos22 (dirup)

pos22 → pos12 (dirleft)

But pos12 is clear initially.

So:

After step2 (agent at pos24):

3. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup

4. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup

5. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft

Now, pos12 is occupied by the agent. Then the agent needs to get back to pos13 to push the stone. So:

6. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown

Then push the stone to pos15.

This would satisfy the constraint that pos12 was not clear (step5). But this adds steps 3-6, which are four steps instead of the original three (steps 3-4 in the initial plan). This makes the plan longer. But since the problem requires an optimal plan, we need to find the shortest possible.

Is there a way to satisfy the constraints with fewer steps?

Another constraint is that the agent must be at pos24 in at least one state. Our initial plan already has that in step2 (agent at pos24 after pushing). So that's covered. Also, when the agent is at pos24, there must have been a previous state where stone1 was at pos22 or pos44 is not clear. But stone1 starts at pos24 and moves to pos14, then to pos15. So stone1 is never at pos22. So we need to have pos44 not clear at some point before the agent is at pos24.

But pos44 is initially clear. So the agent must make pos44 not clear. How? By moving there. So the agent needs to visit pos44 at some point before being at pos24.

Wait, this is another constraint. The agent must be at pos24, and when that happens, there must be an earlier state where stone1 is at pos22 or pos44 is not clear.

Since stone1 is never at pos22, we need pos44 to be not clear before the agent is at pos24. So the agent must move to pos44 before step2.

But how? Let's see:

The agent starts at pos35. To get to pos44, which is (4,4), the path would be:

pos35 → pos34 (dirup)

pos34 → pos44 (dirright) [check movement from pos34]

Looking at pos34's movement options:

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos33 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos35 following direction dirdown"

So yes, from pos34, agent can move to pos44 via dirright.

So possible steps:

1. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup

2. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

3. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft

4. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft (but pos24 is occupied by the stone, so can't move there)

Ah, no. Wait, after step2, the agent is at pos44. Then in step3, they move back to pos34. Then, step4 would require pushing the stone from pos24. But during step4, the agent is at pos34, which allows pushing the stone to pos14.

But this adds steps to visit pos44, making pos44 not clear (steps2 and 3). Then, when the agent is at pos24 (step5), there's an earlier state (step2) where pos44 was not clear, satisfying the constraint.

So the updated plan would be:

1. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup

2. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright (pos44 becomes not clear)

3. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft (pos44 becomes clear again)

4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos14 dirleft (agent moves to pos24, stone to pos14)

5. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup

6. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft

7. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup (pos12 not clear)

8. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown

9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown

This plan now satisfies the constraint for pos24 (agent was at pos44 in step2, which was not clear). But this adds several steps. However, we also need to check other constraints.

Other constraints:

- The agent must be at pos34 in at least one state, and before that, they must have been at pos23. In our initial plan, after step5, agent is at pos23. Then in step6, moves to pos13. Then step7 to pos12, etc. So to satisfy the agent being at pos34 (which happens in steps1 and 3), but the constraint says agent must be at pos34 in some state, and before that, they were at pos23. Wait, no: the constraint says if the agent is at pos34 in some state, there must be an earlier state where they were at pos23. But in this plan, the agent is at pos34 in steps1 and 3, but before that, they were at pos35 and pos44, not pos23. So this violates the constraint.

Wait, the sixth constraint states:

"If the agent is at pos34 in some state, then there must be an earlier state where they were at pos23."

But in this plan, the agent is at pos34 in steps1 and 3, but before those steps, they were not at pos23. So this violates the constraint. So this approach is invalid.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's list all constraints again to ensure coverage:

Constraints:

1. pos23 not clear in at most one continuous sequence.

2. stone1 at pos15 in at least one state.

3. If stone1 is at pos15, then earlier pos12 not clear or stone1 at pos25.

4. Agent at pos24 in at least one state, with earlier pos44 not clear or stone1 at pos22.

5. Agent at pos34 in at least one state, with earlier agent at pos23.

6. At least one state where stone1 at pos44 or pos21 not clear.

7. At least one state where pos42 or pos55 not clear.

8. At least one state where pos15 not clear (which is achieved when stone1 is there).

9. If pos15 is not clear in state s, then in s or after, pos53 not clear or agent at pos45.

Additionally, we have to satisfy all these.

So to handle constraint4 (agent at pos24 requires earlier pos44 not clear or stone1 at pos22), we need to have the agent visit pos44 before being at pos24.

To handle constraint5 (agent at pos34 requires earlier agent at pos23), the agent must visit pos23 before pos34.

But in the previous plan, the agent is at pos34 in steps1 and3, but pos23 is visited in step5. So steps1 and3 are before step5, which violates the constraint because when agent is at pos34 (steps1 and3), there's no earlier state where they were at pos23.

So we need to reorder the steps so that the agent visits pos23 before being at pos34.

But how? Because the agent starts at pos35. To get to pos23, they need to move through pos25, but that's not adjacent. Wait, let's see:

From pos35, the agent can move to pos34 (dirup), then to pos24 (dirleft), but pos24 is occupied by the stone. So that's not possible.

Alternative route: pos35 → pos25 (dirleft), then pos25 → pos24 (dirup). But pos24 is occupied by the stone. So not possible.

Alternatively, pos35 → pos34 (dirup), pos34 → pos33 (dirup?), then pos33 → pos23 (dirleft). Let's check:

pos34's movement options:

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos33 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos35 following direction dirdown"

So from pos34, agent can move to pos33 via dirup.

pos33's movement:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"

So from pos33, agent can move to pos23 via dirleft.

So steps:

1. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup

2. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup

3. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft

Now, agent is at pos23. Then, to satisfy constraint5, when they later are at pos34, they have been at pos23 earlier.

Then, agent can proceed to pos34 from pos33 (dirup to pos33, then dirup to pos34? Wait, pos34 is already visited.

Alternatively, after being at pos23, agent moves to pos24 (dirdown from pos23).

But pos24 is occupied by the stone. So they can't move there.

Alternatively, from pos23, agent moves to pos22 (dirup), then to pos12 (dirleft), etc.

But this is getting too long. Let's try to integrate all constraints.

Another approach:

- To satisfy constraint5 (agent at pos34 needs earlier pos23), agent must visit pos23 before being at pos34.

But initial steps can't have agent at pos34 before visiting pos23. So maybe first go to pos23, then to pos34.

But how?

From pos35, the agent can move to pos34 (dirup), but that's before visiting pos23. So perhaps:

Agent moves from pos35 to pos25 (dirleft), then to pos24 (dirup), but pos24 is occupied. Not possible.

Alternatively:

Agent moves from pos35 to pos34 (dirup), then to pos33 (dirup), then to pos23 (dirleft). Now agent is at pos23. Then later, when they are at pos34 again, they have already been at pos23.

But this requires multiple moves. Let's outline:

1. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup

2. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup

3. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft (now at pos23)

Now, agent is at pos23. Later, when they are at pos34 (again), they have been at pos23 earlier.

Then, proceed to push the stone.

But how to push the stone from pos24 to pos14:

Agent needs to be at pos34 to push via dirleft. So after step3, agent is at pos23. Then, they need to get to pos34.

So:

4. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright

5. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown

Now, agent is at pos34. Now, they can push the stone from pos24 to pos14.

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos14 dirleft (agent moves to pos24)

Now, agent is at pos24. This satisfies constraint4 if earlier pos44 was not clear. So during step4-5, the agent was at pos33 and pos34, not pos44. So this doesn't satisfy constraint4. So we need to make sure that before being at pos24, the agent visited pos44 or the stone was at pos22.

To satisfy constraint4, since stone1 is never at pos22, the agent must have visited pos44 before being at pos24. So steps before step6 must include visiting pos44.

So after step5 (agent at pos34), perhaps:

6. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright (now pos44 is not clear)

7. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft (now pos44 is clear again)

Then, push the stone from pos24 to pos14:

8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos14 dirleft (agent moves to pos24)

Now, when agent is at pos24 (step8), there was an earlier state (step6) where pos44 was not clear. This satisfies constraint4.

Now, after pushing, agent is at pos24. Then:

9. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup

10. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft

11. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup (making pos12 not clear)

12. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown

13. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown

This plan now satisfies:

- constraint3: step11 makes pos12 not clear before stone1 is at pos15.

- constraint4: step6 makes pos44 not clear before step8.

- constraint5: agent is at pos34 in step5 and step7, which was after step3 (agent at pos23).

- constraint6: agent is at pos34 (steps5,7,8), and before that, step3 (pos23), so constraint5 is satisfied.

- constraint7: at least one state where pos42 or pos55 is not clear. Neither is visited in this plan. So we need to address that.

So we need to add a step where the agent is at pos42 or pos55. Let's see:

Pos42 is initially clear. To make it not clear, the agent must move there. How?

From pos34, agent can move to pos44 (step6), then to pos54 (dirright?), but need to check movement options.

Alternatively, after step7 (agent at pos34), before step8, the agent can move to pos44 again, but that's redundant.

Alternatively, after step13, the agent can move to pos45 (which is adjacent to pos35), then to pos55 (dirright). Let's check:

After step13, agent is at pos14 (after pushing to pos15). From pos14, they can move to pos13 (dirup), then to pos23 (dirright?), etc. But to reach pos55, which is (5,5), the agent needs a long path.

Alternatively, after step13, agent is at pos14. To get to pos55:

pos14 → pos15 (dirdown), but pos15 is occupied by the stone. So can't move there.

Alternatively, pos14 → pos24 (dirright), but pos24 is clear now (stone was pushed to pos14, then to pos15). So agent can move to pos24, then pos34, then pos44, pos54, pos55.

But this adds many steps. But the constraint requires that in at least one state, pos42 or pos55 is not clear. So even if the agent visits pos55 after the stone is at pos15, it's still acceptable.

So after step13:

14. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright

15. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright

16. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

17. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright

18. move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown

Now, pos55 is not clear (step18). This satisfies constraint7.

But this adds many steps, making the plan longer. However, the problem requires an optimal plan, so we need to find a way to include this with minimal steps.

Alternatively, during the initial steps, the agent can take a detour to pos42.

For example, after step7 (agent at pos34), before step8, the agent can move to pos44 (step6), then pos44 to pos54, pos54 to pos55, but that's not towards pos42.

Alternatively, from pos34, the agent can move to pos33 (dirup), then pos32, pos42.

Let's check movement from pos34 to pos33 (dirup), then pos33 to pos32 (dirup), then pos32 to pos42 (dirright).

pos34 → pos33 (dirup)

pos33 → pos32 (dirup)

pos32 → pos42 (dirright)

So steps after step7:

8. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup

9. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup

10. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright (now pos42 is not clear)

11. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft

12. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown

13. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown

Then proceed to step8 (now step14):

14. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos14 dirleft

But this adds many steps. However, this allows pos42 to be not clear in step10, satisfying constraint7.

But this significantly increases the plan length, which may not be optimal.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos15 (step13), the agent can move to pos45 (from pos14, how? pos14 is at (1,4). To get to pos45 (4,5), the agent needs to move through multiple steps. But if the agent is at pos14, they can move to pos24, then pos34, pos44, pos45. Then, pos45 is not clear, satisfying the final part of constraint9: after pos15 is not clear, agent is at pos45.

So steps after step13:

14. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright

15. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright

16. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

17. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown

Now, agent is at pos45. This satisfies constraint9: after pos15 is not clear (step13), in a later state (step17), agent is at pos45.

So this takes care of constraint9.

But also, constraint7 requires that either pos42 or pos55 is not clear. In this plan, pos42 remains clear, but pos45 is not clear. But constraint7 requires pos42 or pos55. So this doesn't help. So the agent needs to visit pos42 or pos55.

So after step17, agent is at pos45. Then, move to pos55:

18. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright (since pos45 can move to pos55 via dirright).

Now, pos55 is not clear (step18). This satisfies constraint7.

So this adds steps14-18, but this makes the plan very long. However, the problem requires an optimal plan. So perhaps there's a shorter way.

Another idea: During the agent's initial movement to pos44 (step6), they could then move to pos42 from there. Let's see:

From pos44, movement options:

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown"

So to get to pos42 from pos44:

pos44 → pos43 (dirup)

pos43 → pos42 (dirup)

So steps after step6 (agent at pos44):

7. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

8. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup

Now, pos42 is not clear (step8). Then, the agent can move back:

9. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown

10. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown

Then proceed to step7 (now step10) as before.

This way, pos42 is not clear in step8, satisfying constraint7. This adds steps7-10, which is four steps. But this increases the plan length.

This is getting very complicated. Let's summarize the necessary constraints and see if there's a way to satisfy them with fewer steps.

To recap:

- The main goal is to get stone1 to pos15.

- Constraints:

  3. Before stone1 at pos15, pos12 not clear or stone1 at pos25.

  4. When agent is at pos24, earlier pos44 not clear or stone1 at pos22.

  5. When agent is at pos34, earlier agent at pos23.

  6. At least one state where stone1 at pos44 or pos21 not clear.

  7. At least one state where pos42 or pos55 not clear.

  9. After pos15 is not clear, agent must be at pos45 or pos53 not clear.

Let's address constraint6: at least one state where stone1 is at pos44 or pos21 is not clear. Since stone1 is moved from pos24 to pos14 to pos15, it's never at pos44. So pos21 must be not clear. pos21 is initially clear. So the agent must visit pos21.

So agent needs to be at pos21 at some point.

So how to get the agent to pos21.

From the initial position pos35, possible path:

pos35 → pos34 (dirup)

pos34 → pos33 (dirup)

pos33 → pos32 (dirup)

pos32 → pos22 (dirleft)

pos22 → pos21 (dirup)

So steps:

1. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup

2. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup

3. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup

4. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft

5. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup

Now, pos21 is not clear (step5). Then proceed to the main plan.

But this adds five steps just to visit pos21. This is not optimal.

Alternative idea: During the plan, after pushing the stone to pos14, the agent moves to pos24, then to pos23, pos22, pos21. So steps after step8 (agent at pos24):

9. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup

10. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup

11. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup

Now, pos21 is not clear (step11). This satisfies constraint6.

Then, the agent needs to get back to pos13 to push the stone to pos15. So steps:

12. move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown

13. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown

14. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft

15. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup

16. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown

17. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown

This adds steps9-11 and 12-14, significantly increasing the plan length. Not optimal.

This is very challenging. Given the complexity, perhaps the optimal plan requires a careful sequence that satisfies all constraints with minimal steps.

Let's try to integrate all constraints step by step.

Final approach:

1. Move agent to pos34 (dirup from pos35).

2. Move to pos44 (dirright from pos34), making pos44 not clear (satisfies part of constraint4).

3. Return to pos34 (dirleft), pos44 clear again.

4. Push stone from pos24 to pos14 (dirleft from pos34), agent moves to pos24.

   This satisfies constraint4 (pos44 was not clear in step2 before agent is at pos24).

5. Move agent to pos23 (dirup from pos24).

6. Move agent to pos13 (dirleft from pos23).

7. Move agent to pos12 (dirup from pos13), making pos12 not clear (satisfies constraint3).

8. Move back to pos13 (dirdown from pos12).

9. Push stone to pos15 (dirdown from pos13), satisfying main goal and constraint2.

10. Now, agent is at pos14. Move to pos24 (dirright from pos14).

11. Move to pos34 (dirright from pos24).

12. Move to pos44 (dirright from pos34).

13. Move to pos54 (dirright from pos44).

14. Move to pos55 (dirdown from pos54), making pos55 not clear (satisfies constraint7).

15. Then, move to pos45 (dirleft from pos55 via pos54's movement? Or from pos55 to pos45 via dirleft).

According to movement list:

"You may move from location pos55 to location pos45 following direction dirleft".

So from pos55, agent can move to pos45 (dirleft).

So step15: move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft.

Now, pos45 is not clear (satisfies constraint9, since after pos15 is not clear, agent is at pos45).

But during step14, pos55 was not clear, satisfying constraint7.

Additionally, during step2, pos44 was not clear, satisfying constraint4.

During step5, agent is at pos23. Later, when agent is at pos34 (step4 and step11), there's an earlier state (step5) where they were at pos23, satisfying constraint5.

During step7, pos12 is not clear, satisfying constraint3.

During step14, pos55 is not clear, satisfying constraint7.

During step9, pos15 is not clear (stone is there), and after that, agent is at pos45 (step15), satisfying constraint9.

Constraint6 requires at least one state where stone1 is at pos44 or pos21 is not clear. Since stone1 is never at pos44, we need pos21 to be not clear. But in this plan, pos21 remains clear. So this is a problem. We missed constraint6.

To address this, the agent needs to visit pos21 or have the stone at pos44. Since the stone is at pos15, we need to have the agent visit pos21.

So adding steps to visit pos21:

After step9 (agent at pos14):

10. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright

11. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup

12. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup

13. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup (pos21 not clear)

14. move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown

15. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown

16. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown

17. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright

18. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

19. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright

20. move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown

21. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft

Now, step13 makes pos21 not clear, satisfying constraint6.

But this adds many steps, making the plan very long. However, given the complexity of constraints, this might be necessary.

But the problem requires an optimal (shortest) plan. This suggests that there's a way to satisfy all constraints with fewer steps.

Alternative idea: Combine visits to multiple constrained locations in fewer steps.

For example, after pushing the stone to pos14 (step4), agent is at pos24.

Then, agent can move to pos23 (step5), then to pos22 (step6), then to pos21 (step7), then back to pos22 (step8), then to pos23 (step9), then to pos13 (step10), then to pos12 (step11), then back to pos13 (step12), then push to pos15 (step13).

This way:

- pos21 is visited (step7), satisfying constraint6.

- pos12 is visited (step11), satisfying constraint3.

- pos23 is visited (steps5,9), satisfying constraint5 when agent is at pos34.

But how does the agent get to pos34 again? They need to be at pos34 to satisfy constraint5.

Alternatively, after step13 (push to pos15), agent can move to pos34 via pos24 and pos34.

This is getting too involved. Perhaps the optimal plan is as follows, but I'm not certain:

```
move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup
move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos14 dirleft
move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown
move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown
move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft
```

This plan has 14 steps. Let's check the constraints:

1. pos23 not clear in one sequence (step5).

2. stone1 at pos15 (step9).

3. step7 makes pos12 not clear before step9.

4. step2 makes pos44 not clear before step4.

5. step5 (pos23) before step4 (agent at pos24) and step10 (pos34). So when agent is at pos34 (steps1,3,10), they were at pos23 in step5.

6. agent is at pos21 in none of the steps. So this violates constraint6. So need to add steps to visit pos21.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can visit pos21 during the movement from pos34 to pos44. But not directly. 

Alternatively, after step9, agent is at pos14. Then:

10. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright

11. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup

12. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup

13. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup

14. move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown

15. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown

16. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown

17. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright

18. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

19. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright

20. move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown

21. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft

Now, step13 makes pos21 not clear (constraint6), but adds many steps. This plan is now 21 steps, which is not optimal.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I'll try to provide a plan that satisfies all constraints, even if it's longer, but ensuring it meets all conditions.
