Okay, let's see. I need to find a valid plan to move stone1 to a goal location, which is pos32 according to the problem. The initial state has the agent at pos15 and stone1 at pos44. The constraints are a bit complex, so I need to make sure each one is satisfied.

First, let's outline the main goal: get stone1 to pos32. But there are several constraints to consider. Let's list them out:

1. Constraint 1: pos35 must always be clear. So the agent or stones can never be there.
2. Constraint 2: At some point, either pos13 is not clear or stone1 is at pos55. But since pos55 is not a goal, and our goal is to get stone1 to pos32, maybe this is a temporary condition.
3. Constraint 3: The agent must be at pos25 at least once.
4. Constraint 4: If the agent is at pos25, then either pos55 is not clear or stone1 is at pos13 at that state or later.
5. Constraint 5: stone1 must never be at pos42.
6. Constraint 6: The agent must be at pos43 at least once.
7. Constraint 7: If the agent is at pos43, then pos13 or pos12 must be not clear at that state or later.
8. Constraint 8: At some point, both pos33 and pos15 are not clear. Wait, pos15 is the initial position of the agent. So when the agent leaves pos15, pos15 becomes clear. But the constraint says they must both be not clear. Hmm, maybe pos15 is not clear (agent is there) and pos33 has a stone? But stone1 is initially at pos44. So maybe the agent has to be at pos15 and pos33 has something. But how? Since the only stone is stone1. Unless the agent moves to pos33 and pos15 is still occupied? Wait, initially, the agent is at pos15. So if the agent moves away, pos15 becomes clear. So to have pos15 not clear, the agent must be there. So the constraint is that in some state, the agent is at pos15 (making pos15 not clear) and pos33 is not clear (maybe the agent is there? But that's impossible unless the agent is in two places. Or maybe stone1 is at pos33? But the stone is at pos44 initially. So to satisfy this, stone1 needs to be moved to pos33, and the agent must be at pos15 at the same time. But how? Because moving the stone to pos33 would require the agent to be near it. So maybe the agent first moves stone1 to pos33, then goes back to pos15. But after moving stone1 to pos33, the agent is at pos34 (from pushing). Then moving back to pos15 would require a long path. But pos35 must always be clear (constraint 1), so the agent can't go through pos35. Let's keep this in mind.

9. Constraint 9: At some state, stone1 is at pos32. That's our main goal, but the problem requires it to be in the final state. But this constraint says it must be in at least one state, which would be the final state. However, there's another constraint that if stone1 is at pos32, then there must be a prior state where stone1 was at pos23. So we need to move stone1 from pos44 to pos23 first, then to pos32.

So the path for stone1 would be pos44 → ... → pos23 → ... → pos32.

Now, the agent starts at pos15. Let's plan the route.

First, move the agent from pos15 to pos44 to push stone1. But how? Let's see the possible moves.

From pos15, the agent can move to pos25 (dirright) or pos14 (dirup). Let's see the movement path.

To get to pos44, which is where stone1 is, the agent needs to reach a position adjacent to pos44 in the direction from which to push. Since the agent can push stones, he needs to be next to the stone and then push it in a direction.

Looking at pos44's neighbors: pos34 (left), pos43 (up), pos45 (down), pos54 (right). But the agent can only push if he's in a position adjacent to the stone and the direction of push is valid.

For example, to push stone1 from pos44 to pos34 (left), the agent needs to be at pos44's right (pos45?), but wait, directions are a bit confusing. Let me clarify the movement directions.

The movement directions: dirup, dirdown, dirleft, dirright. When moving, the agent moves from one location to another adjacent one in a direction. For example, moving from pos44 to pos34 is dirleft, because pos34 is to the left of pos44. Similarly, moving from pos44 to pos43 is dirup (if pos43 is above pos44). Wait, the grid is 5x5, with pos11 at top-left? Let me imagine the grid:

Rows are 1 to 5 (top to bottom?), columns 1 to 5 (left to right). So pos11 is row 1, column 1. pos15 is row 1, column 5. pos51 is row5, column1. So pos44 is row4, column4.

So adjacent cells:

- pos44's up is pos43 (row3, column4)
- pos44's down is pos45 (row5, column4) [Wait, row4 down would be row5? But row5 is the last. So pos44 down is pos54? Wait, maybe I'm mixing rows and columns. Wait, perhaps the positions are arranged such that pos11 is top-left, and moving down increases the row number. So pos11 is row1, column1. pos12 is row1, column2. pos21 is row2, column1. So, pos44 is row4, column4. Then, moving down from pos44 would be to pos54 (row5, column4). Moving right would be to pos45 (row4, column5). Wait, but looking at the allowed moves provided, for example, pos44 can move to pos34 (dirleft), which would be column3, row4. So perhaps the columns are the second digit. So pos44 is row4, column4. Then dirleft would decrease the column number: pos34 (row4, column3). Dirright increases column number: pos54 (row4, column5). Wait, no, pos44's right would be column4 +1 = column5, same row. So pos45 (row4, column5). But according to the allowed moves in the problem statement, for pos44, "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft" (so dirleft from pos44 is pos34). "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright" (dirright from pos44 is pos54). "You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup" (dirup from pos44 is pos43). "You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown" (dirdown from pos44 is pos45). Wait, that's confusing. So:

- dirup from pos44 is pos43 (row3, column4)
- dirdown is pos45 (row5, column4)? Wait, row4 down would be row5? But pos45 is row4, column5. Wait, maybe the directions are different. Let me check the given movements:

For example, pos15 (row1, column5) can move to pos25 (dirright). So dirright from pos15 (row1, column5) to pos25 (row2, column5). That suggests that dirright is moving down a row. Wait, that's unexpected. Or maybe the directions are not as I thought. Let's see another example: pos11 can move to pos21 (dirright) or pos12 (dirdown). So pos11 (row1, column1) moving dirright to pos21 (row2, column1) and dirdown to pos12 (row1, column2). Wait, that's inconsistent. So perhaps the directions are as follows:

- dirright: move to the next row (same column, row+1)
- dirleft: move to previous row (same column, row-1)
- dirup: move to previous column (same row, column-1)
- dirdown: move to next column (same row, column+1)

Wait, that can't be right. Because from pos11, moving dirright to pos21 (row2, column1) implies that dirright is increasing the row. Then, moving dirdown from pos11 to pos12 (row1, column2) implies that dirdown increases the column. So:

- dirright: row +1
- dirleft: row -1
- dirup: column -1
- dirdown: column +1

So pos44 (row4, column4):

- dirright: row5, column4 → pos54
- dirleft: row3, column4 → pos34
- dirup: column3, row4 → pos43
- dirdown: column5, row4 → pos45

But in the problem statement, moving from pos44 to pos34 is dirleft (row-1), pos54 is dirright (row+1), pos43 is dirup (column-1), pos45 is dirdown (column+1). So directions are:

- dirright: row +1
- dirleft: row -1
- dirup: column -1
- dirdown: column +1

This is crucial for planning movement.

So the agent is at pos15 (row1, column5). To reach pos44 (row4, column4), the agent needs to navigate through the grid. Let's plan the path.

Possible path from pos15 to pos44:

pos15 → pos25 (dirright, row2, column5)

Then pos25 → pos35 (dirright, row3, column5)

But constraint 1 says pos35 must always be clear. So the agent can't go to pos35. So this path is blocked.

Alternative path: pos15 → pos14 (dirup, column4, row1) → pos14 to pos24 (dirright, row2, column4) → pos24 to pos34 (dirright, row3, column4) → pos34 to pos44 (dirright, row4, column4). But wait, moving dirright from pos34 (row3, column4) would go to row4, column4 → pos44. Yes.

But let's check the allowed moves:

From pos15, allowed moves are dirright to pos25 or dirup to pos14.

So:

1. move from pos15 to pos14 (dirup). Then from pos14, can move to pos24 (dirright). Then pos24 to pos34 (dirright). Then pos34 to pos44 (dirright). But need to check if each step is allowed.

Check allowed moves:

- pos15 to pos14 via dirup: allowed as per the problem's stated possible moves ("You may move from location pos15 to location pos14 following direction dirup").

- pos14 to pos24 via dirright: yes ("You may move from location pos14 to location pos24 following direction dirright").

- pos24 to pos34 via dirright: yes ("You may move from location pos24 to location pos34 following direction dirright").

- pos34 to pos44 via dirright: yes ("You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright").

So this path is possible. But after moving to pos44, the agent would be there. But stone1 is at pos44 initially. Wait, in the initial state, stone1 is at pos44, and pos44 is clear? Wait the initial state says "Location pos44 is clear". Wait no: looking back at the original state:

"stone1 is at location pos44"

"Location pos44 is clear" → Wait, that's conflicting. How can pos44 be clear if stone1 is there? Wait, the original state says:

"Original state of the world":

- "player1 is at location pos15"

- "stone1 is at location pos44"

- "Location pos11 is clear" ... "Location pos44 is clear" (but stone1 is there). That must be a mistake. Wait, no. Because the "clear" status refers to whether the location is empty. If a stone or agent is there, it's not clear. So in the original state, pos15 is clear? Wait, the agent is at pos15, so pos15 is not clear. But the original state says:

"Location pos15 is clear" → That's a problem. Wait, the original state says:

"Original state of the world":

- "player1 is at location pos15"

- "stone1 is at location pos44"

- Then a list of "Location ... is clear" including "Location pos15 is clear" and "Location pos44 is clear".

But that's impossible. If the agent is at pos15, then pos15 is not clear. Similarly, stone1 is at pos44, so pos44 is not clear. But according to the problem statement, in the original state, pos15 and pos44 are clear. This must be an error. Wait, perhaps the problem statement has a typo. Let me check again:

Looking at the original state:

The original state includes:

"player1 is at location pos15"

"stone1 is at location pos44"

"Location pos11 is clear"

... (many locations listed as clear) ...

"Location pos45 is clear"

"Location pos51 is clear"

... 

"Location pos15 is clear"

"Location pos44 is clear"

So, this is conflicting. The agent is at pos15, so pos15 should not be clear. Similarly, stone1 is at pos44, so pos44 should not be clear. This must be a mistake in the problem statement. But since this is the given, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Maybe "clear" means something else. Wait, the problem defines that each position may contain the agent, a stone, or be empty. A location is clear if it's empty. So if the agent or a stone is present, it's not clear. Therefore, the original state as described has a contradiction because both the agent and stone are at positions that are stated as clear. That must be a mistake. But since this is the given problem, perhaps we have to proceed under the assumption that the initial state is correctly specified. But this is a problem. For example, the agent is at pos15, so pos15 is not clear, but the problem states "Location pos15 is clear". That's a contradiction. Similarly for pos44. So this must be an error. But perhaps the problem meant to say that initially, pos15 and pos44 are not clear. But given the way it's written, maybe the user made a mistake. However, since I have to work with the given information, perhaps I should proceed, but this is a critical point. 

Wait, perhaps the initial state lists the clear locations after placing the agent and stone. So perhaps the correct initial state is that all locations except pos15 (agent) and pos44 (stone) are clear. But according to the problem's original state, pos15 and pos44 are listed as clear, which is conflicting. This is a major issue. Without resolving this, the plan can't be made. But perhaps it's a typo, and the intended initial state is that pos15 and pos44 are not clear, but other locations are. Let's assume that. Because otherwise, the problem is impossible. So the agent is at pos15, so pos15 is not clear. Stone1 is at pos44, so pos44 is not clear. The rest of the locations are clear as listed. So when the problem says "Location pos15 is clear" and "Location pos44 is clear", it's incorrect. But we have to proceed with the correct initial state. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses "clear" to mean that there's no stone, but the agent can be there. But that's not standard. This is a critical problem. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem's original state is correct, and the agent and stone are placed in a way that doesn't affect the clear status. But that doesn't make sense. The presence of agent or stone should make the location not clear. 

Given this confusion, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the correct initial state is that pos15 is not clear (agent there), pos44 is not clear (stone there), and other locations as listed. So in that case, the agent starts at pos15 (not clear), and stone at pos44 (not clear). So when planning movement, the agent needs to leave pos15, making it clear. But the first move would be to move from pos15 to pos14 (dirup), but pos14 is clear. So that's allowed.

So proceeding under the assumption that the original state correctly lists all clear locations except where the agent and stone are. So pos15 and pos44 are not clear (agent and stone there), and other locations as listed.

Given that, the agent needs to move from pos15 to pos14 (dirup), then pos14 to pos24 (dirright), pos24 to pos34 (dirright), pos34 to pos44 (dirright). But pos44 has the stone, so the agent can't move there directly. Wait, no. The move action requires that the destination is clear. So the agent can't move into a location occupied by a stone. So the agent cannot move to pos44 directly because stone1 is there. Therefore, the agent must navigate around to reach a position adjacent to the stone to push it.

So the stone is at pos44. The agent needs to get to a position adjacent to pos44 to push it. Let's see possible adjacent positions:

From pos44, the agent can be at pos34 (left), pos43 (up), pos45 (down), or pos54 (right). But pos34 is clear (since stone is at pos44, and initial clear locations include pos34 as clear?), but according to the original state, pos34 is clear. So the agent needs to get to pos34, pos43, pos45, or pos54 to push the stone.

Let's plan the path to pos43 (up of pos44). To get to pos43, the agent needs to navigate through the grid.

Possible path from pos15 to pos43:

pos15 → pos14 (dirup) → pos24 (dirright) → pos34 (dirright) → pos44 (dirright) → but can't move into pos44. Alternatively, from pos34, the agent can go dirup to pos33 (dirup would be column-1). Wait, directions are:

From pos34 (row3, column4), dirup would decrease column by 1 → column3 → pos33 (row3, column3). But pos33 is clear. So perhaps:

pos15 → pos14 (dirup) → pos24 (dirright) → pos34 (dirright) → pos33 (dirup) → pos43 (dirright). Wait, pos33 to pos43? Let me check allowed moves. From pos33, can the agent move dirright (row+1) to pos43 (row4, column3). But according to the problem's allowed moves:

Looking at the given moves:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"

Yes. So pos33 to pos43 is allowed via dirright.

So the path would be:

move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup

move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright

move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright

move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup

move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright

Now, the agent is at pos43, which is adjacent to pos44 (stone's location). From here, the agent can push the stone. The stone is at pos44. To push it, the agent needs to be at pos43 (up of pos44) and push in the dirdown direction (column+1), which would move the stone to pos45 (row4, column5). But pos45 is a non-goal location. But our goal is to get the stone to pos32 (goal location). So pushing to pos45 may not help. Alternatively, the agent can push the stone to pos34 (dirleft from pos44). To do that, the agent would need to be at pos54 (right of pos44) and push left, but that's not possible. Or at pos34 (left of pos44) and push right to pos44's right (pos54?), but that's not possible.

Wait, the direction for pushing is the direction from the stone's current position to the new position. So if the agent is at pos43 (up of pos44), and wants to push the stone down (dirdown, which increases column), then the stone would move from pos44 (row4, column4) to pos45 (row4, column5). But pos45 is a non-goal. Alternatively, if the agent is at pos34 (left of pos44), and pushes the stone right (dirright, row+1), the stone would move to pos54 (row5, column4), which is also a non-goal. 

Alternatively, the agent could push the stone up (dirup) from pos44 to pos43. But to do that, the agent needs to be south of pos44 (pos45) and push up. But pos45 is clear, so the agent can move there. Wait, but pos45 is initially clear. So the agent could go to pos45, then push the stone up to pos44's up direction (pos43). Wait, but the stone is already at pos44. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, the agent could push the stone left (dirleft) from pos44 to pos34. To do that, the agent needs to be at pos44's right (pos54) and push left. But pos54 is clear, so the agent can move there. Let's see:

Path to pos54:

From pos15, the agent can move down to pos25, then pos35 (but pos35 must remain clear, so can't go there). Alternative path: pos15 → pos25 (dirright), then pos25 → pos24 (dirup), pos24 → pos34 (dirright), pos34 → pos44 (dirright) but can't enter. Wait, this is getting complicated.

Alternative approach: to push the stone from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft), the agent needs to be at pos54 (right of pos44) and push left. But how to get to pos54?

From pos15, the agent can move to pos25 (dirright), then pos25 → pos35 (dirright) is blocked because pos35 must always be clear. So can't go there. Alternative path: pos25 → pos24 (dirup), then pos24 → pos34 (dirright), pos34 → pos44 (dirright) can't enter. Alternatively, pos24 → pos23 (dirdown?), wait, directions are confusing. Let me re-examine the allowed moves.

For pos24:

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos14 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos34 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos23 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos25 following direction dirdown"

Wait, from pos24 (row2, column4), dirright (row+1) leads to pos34 (row3, column4). Dirleft (row-1) leads to pos14 (row1, column4). Dirup (column-1) leads to pos23 (row2, column3). Dirdown (column+1) leads to pos25 (row2, column5).

So, to reach pos54 (row5, column4), the agent needs to go down from pos44. But since pos44 is occupied by the stone, the agent can't get there. Alternative approach: perhaps the agent can go around the grid to reach pos54.

Alternative path from pos15:

pos15 → pos25 (dirright)

pos25 → pos24 (dirup)

pos24 → pos23 (dirup)

pos23 → pos13 (dirleft)

pos13 → pos14 (dirdown)

Wait, this seems not helpful. Maybe a better approach is needed.

Alternatively, the agent can move to pos51, then pos52, etc., but that's a long path. This is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a more efficient way.

Let's consider the required constraints:

- The agent must be at pos25 at least once. So during the plan, the agent needs to visit pos25.

- The agent must be at pos43 at least once.

- When the agent is at pos25, then either pos55 is not clear or stone1 is at pos13 in that state or later.

But since pos55 is a non-goal location and we need to move the stone to pos32 (a goal), getting the stone to pos13 would complicate things. So maybe we can satisfy this constraint by having the agent visit pos25, then later ensure that pos55 is not clear. How? By moving the agent to pos55, but that's allowed as long as pos35 remains clear.

But pos55 is a location that the agent can visit. For example, after pushing the stone to pos45 (from pos44), the agent could move to pos45, then to pos55 via dirright. But pos55 is a non-goal, but moving there would make pos55 not clear, satisfying the constraint if done after visiting pos25.

Another constraint: after the agent is at pos43, pos13 or pos12 must be not clear. Since pos13 and pos12 are initially clear, this means either the agent or stone must be there. Since the stone needs to go to pos32, perhaps the agent can move to pos13 or pos12 after being at pos43.

But this requires careful planning.

Another constraint: at some state, both pos33 and pos15 are not clear. pos15 is the initial position of the agent. So when the agent leaves pos15, pos15 becomes clear. To have pos15 not clear, the agent must be there. So the agent must return to pos15 at some point. And pos33 must be not clear, which could be achieved by having the stone there. So the stone needs to be moved to pos33, and the agent must be at pos15 at the same time. But how? The agent would have to push the stone to pos33, then return to pos15. But pushing the stone to pos33 requires the agent to be adjacent. So perhaps:

After moving the stone from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft), then to pos33 (dirleft), then to pos32 (dirleft). But pos32 is a goal location, so once it's there, we're done. But we need to have the stone at pos23 before it's at pos32. So the path for the stone would be pos44 → pos34 → pos33 → pos32. But that skips pos23. So we need to adjust.

Wait, the constraint says that if stone1 is at pos32, there must be an earlier state where it was at pos23. So the stone must go from pos44 to pos23, then to pos32. So how to get it to pos23.

Possible path for stone1: pos44 → pos34 → pos24 → pos23. Then pos23 → pos22 → pos32. But that requires a lot of steps.

Alternatively, pos44 → pos34 (pushed left by agent from pos44's right pos54). But how to get the agent to pos54 to push left.

Let me try to outline a possible plan:

1. Agent moves from pos15 to pos14 (dirup).

2. Agent moves from pos14 to pos24 (dirright).

3. Agent moves from pos24 to pos34 (dirright).

4. Agent moves from pos34 to pos44 (dirright) → but can't, since stone is there. So instead, agent needs to go around.

Wait, perhaps after step 3 (agent at pos34), he can push the stone from pos44 to pos34. But how? The agent is at pos34, which is to the left of pos44. So to push the stone from pos44 to pos34, the agent must be at pos44's right (pos54) and push left. Or wait, no. To push a stone, the agent must be adjacent to the stone in the direction opposite to the push. For example, to push the stone left, the agent must be to the right of the stone. So agent at pos54 (right of pos44) can push the stone left to pos34. So the agent needs to reach pos54.

Path to pos54:

From pos15 → pos25 (dirright) → pos25 can move to pos24 (dirup) → pos24 to pos34 (dirright) → pos34 to pos44 (dirright) can't. Alternatively, pos25 → pos35 (dirright) is invalid because pos35 must remain clear. So alternative path: pos25 → pos24 (dirup) → pos24 → pos23 (dirup) → pos23 → pos13 (dirleft) → pos13 → pos14 (dirdown) → pos14 → pos24 → ... this is getting too long.

Alternatively, agent moves from pos15 to pos25 (dirright), then pos25 → pos24 (dirup), pos24 → pos34 (dirright), pos34 → pos44 (dirright) can't. But the stone is at pos44. So agent is at pos34, stone at pos44. To push the stone west (dirleft) from pos44 to pos34, the agent needs to be east of pos44 (pos54) and push west. So agent needs to reach pos54. How?

From pos34, the agent can move dirup (column-1) to pos33 (row3, column3). Then pos33 → pos43 (dirright, row4, column3). Then pos43 → pos53 (dirright, row5, column3). Then pos53 → pos54 (dirdown, column4). Now the agent is at pos54 (row5, column4), which is east of pos44. Then agent can push the stone from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft). 

But wait, the stone is at pos44. To push it left (dirleft), the agent at pos54 can perform pushtonongoal (since pos34 is a non-goal location). The action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirleft. 

But preconditions for pushtonongoal:

- Agent is at pos54 (yes).

- Stone is at pos44 (yes).

- pos34 is clear (initially yes).

- Can move from pos54 to pos44 following dirleft. Wait, from pos54 (row5, column4) to pos44 (row4, column4), direction dirleft (row-1). Is that allowed? According to the allowed moves, from pos54:

"You may move from location pos54 to location pos44 following direction dirleft"

Yes. So yes, the agent can move from pos54 to pos44 via dirleft. But pos44 has the stone. So the precondition is that the agent is at pos54, stone at pos44, and pos34 is clear. Then the pushtonongoal action would be valid. 

After pushing, the stone moves to pos34 (non-goal), and the agent moves to pos44. 

Then, the stone is at pos34. Next, the agent needs to push it further. Now, pos34 is a non-goal, so next push can be towards pos32. Let's see.

But first, check constraints. After this push, the agent is at pos44. Now, he needs to push the stone again. The stone is at pos34. To push it to pos33 (dirleft), the agent needs to be east of pos34 (pos44) and push left. So from pos44, the agent can push the stone to pos33. 

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos33 dirleft.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos44 (yes, after previous push).

- Stone at pos34 (yes).

- pos33 is clear (initially yes).

- Can move from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft, which is allowed).

- Can move from pos34 to pos33 (dirleft) → allowed? Let's check allowed moves for pos34:

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft" (row-1), pos34 to pos24. But pos34 to pos33 would be dirup (column-1). Wait, directions are:

pos34 is row3, column4. pos33 is row3, column3. So to go from pos34 to pos33, the direction is dirup (column-1). 

So the agent needs to be south of pos34 (pos44) and push up (dirup). Wait, no. To push the stone from pos34 to pos33 (dirup), the agent must be south of pos34 (pos44) and push north (dirup). So the direction for the push is dirup. 

So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos33 dirup.

Check preconditions:

- Agent at pos44 (yes).

- Stone at pos34 (yes).

- pos33 is clear (yes, initially).

- Can move from pos44 to pos34 (dirup? No. pos44 to pos34 is dirleft. Wait, pos44 (row4, column4) to pos34 (row3, column4) is dirleft (row-1). So direction is dirleft. The push direction for the stone is dirup (from pos34 to pos33). 

So the action is pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos33 dirup.

Preconditions:

iv) You can get from pos44 to pos34 following dirleft (yes).

v) You can get from pos34 to pos33 following dirup (yes, since pos34 to pos33 is dirup).

vi) pos33 is a non-goal location (yes, according to the problem statement, pos33 is not a goal).

So this action is valid. 

After this, stone1 is at pos33 (non-goal), and agent is at pos34.

Next step: push the stone from pos33 to pos32 (a goal). 

But pos32 is a goal location, so the action must be pushtogoal. 

To push the stone from pos33 to pos32 (dirleft), the agent must be east of pos33 (pos43) and push left. 

Current agent position: pos34. 

To get to pos43, the agent needs to move from pos34 to pos44 (dirright), then to pos43 (dirup). Wait:

pos34 → pos44 (dirright): allowed.

pos44 → pos43 (dirup): allowed.

Then agent is at pos43. From there, can push the stone west (dirleft) to pos32. 

But wait, the stone is at pos33. So to push it from pos33 to pos32 (dirleft), the agent needs to be east of pos33 (pos43) and push west (dirleft). 

Action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos32 dirleft.

Check preconditions:

- Agent at pos43 (yes).

- Stone at pos33 (yes).

- pos32 is clear (yes, initially).

- Can move from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft). pos43 is row4, column3. pos33 is row3, column3. Direction dirleft (row-1). Is this allowed? According to the problem's allowed moves:

From pos43: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft".

Yes.

- Can move from pos33 to pos32 (dirleft). pos33 to pos32 is dirleft (row-1). From pos33's allowed moves: "You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft". Wait, pos33 (row3, column3) → dirleft (row-1) would be row2, column3 → pos23. So how to get to pos32 from pos33? pos32 is row3, column2. So from pos33, dirup (column-1) would get to pos32. Wait, directions are confusing again. Let me recheck:

pos33 is row3, column3.

- dirup: column-1 → pos32 (row3, column2).

- dirleft: row-1 → pos23 (row2, column3).

So to push the stone from pos33 to pos32 (dirup), the agent must be south of pos33 (pos43) and push north (dirup). 

Thus, the action is pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos32 dirup.

Check preconditions:

- Agent at pos43 (yes).

- Stone at pos33 (yes).

- pos32 is clear (yes).

- Can move from pos43 to pos33: dirleft (row-1). pos43 to pos33 is dirleft (row3, column3). Wait, pos43 is row4, column3. dirleft would be row-1 → row3, column3 → pos33. Yes.

- Can move from pos33 to pos32: dirup (column-1). Yes, as per allowed moves: "You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup".

- pos32 is a goal location (yes).

So this action is valid. 

After this, stone1 is at pos32 (goal), satisfying the main goal. 

But we also need to ensure all constraints are met. Let's check each constraint:

1. "Location pos35 is clear" in every state. The agent never goes to pos35, and stone1 never goes there. So this is satisfied.

2. At least one state has pos13 not clear or stone1 at pos55. In the current plan, neither happens. So we need to address this. How? Maybe the agent can visit pos25, then go to pos55 to make it not clear.

3. Agent must be at pos25 at least once. In the current plan, the agent moves from pos15 to pos14. So pos25 is not visited. So need to adjust the plan to include a visit to pos25.

4. If agent is at pos25, then pos55 is not clear or stone1 at pos13. So after visiting pos25, ensure pos55 is not clear by moving there.

5. stone1 never at pos42. In the plan, stone1 moves from pos44 → pos34 → pos33 → pos32. So never at pos42. Good.

6. Agent must be at pos43. In the current plan, the agent is at pos43 when pushing to pos32. So satisfied.

7. If agent is at pos43, then pos13 or pos12 must be not clear. After being at pos43, the agent pushes the stone to pos32. So after that, the agent is at pos33. Then, the agent needs to make pos13 or pos12 not clear. How? Perhaps after pushing, the agent moves to pos13 or pos12. 

8. Some state has pos33 and pos15 not clear. pos33 is not clear when the stone is there (after pushing to pos33). pos15 is not clear when the agent is there. So the agent needs to return to pos15 after the stone is at pos33. 

9. Some state has stone1 at pos32 (achieved in the final step). And there must be a prior state where stone1 was at pos23. Wait, in the current plan, stone1 goes from pos44 → pos34 → pos33 → pos32. Never at pos23. So this violates the constraint that if stone1 is at pos32, there must be an earlier state where it was at pos23. So the current plan is invalid. 

Thus, the path needs to include moving stone1 to pos23 before pos32. So the stone's path must be pos44 → ... → pos23 → ... → pos32.

This complicates things. Let's adjust the plan.

Alternative plan:

After pushing stone1 to pos34, then push it to pos24, then to pos23, then to pos32.

Let's see:

1. Move agent to pos54 and push stone1 to pos34 (dirleft).

2. Then, agent is at pos44. Push stone1 to pos34 → pos24.

Wait, no. After pushing to pos34, stone is at pos34. Then, agent is at pos44. Now, to push it to pos24 (dirleft), agent needs to be at pos34's east (pos44) and push left. So from pos44, agent can push stone1 from pos34 to pos24 via dirleft.

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos24 dirleft.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos44 (yes).

- Stone at pos34 (yes).

- pos24 is clear (yes, initially).

- Can move from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft) → allowed.

- Can move from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft) → allowed.

- pos24 is a non-goal (yes).

So this action is valid. After this, stone1 is at pos24, agent at pos34.

Then, push stone1 from pos24 to pos23. Agent needs to be east of pos24 (pos34) and push left.

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos23 dirleft.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos34 (yes).

- Stone at pos24 (yes).

- pos23 is clear (yes).

- Can move from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft) → allowed.

- Can move from pos24 to pos23 (dirleft) → allowed? pos24 to pos23 is dirup (column-1). Wait, pos24 is row2, column4. pos23 is row2, column3. So direction is dirup (column-1). So the push direction is dirup. 

So the action is pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos23 dirup.

Check preconditions:

- Agent at pos34 (row3, column4).

- Stone at pos24 (row2, column4).

- pos23 is clear.

- Can move from pos34 to pos24 following dirup. pos34 → pos24 is dirup (column-1)? No. pos34 (row3, column4) to pos24 (row2, column4) is dirleft (row-1). So direction is dirleft.

The push direction from pos24 to pos23 is dirup (column-1). 

So the action should be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos23 dirup.

But to perform this, the agent must be at pos24's south (pos34) and push north (dirup). 

Preconditions:

iv) You can get from pos34 to pos24 following direction dirleft (yes, since pos34 to pos24 is dirleft).

v) You can get from pos24 to pos23 following dirup (yes, per allowed moves: "You may move from location pos24 to location pos23 following direction dirup").

vi) pos23 is non-goal (yes).

So this action is valid. After this, stone1 is at pos23, agent at pos24.

Then, push stone1 from pos23 to pos22, then to pos32. But pos22 is non-goal. So:

Push from pos23 to pos22 (dirleft), then from pos22 to pos32 (dirright). 

But let's see:

To push from pos23 to pos22 (dirleft), the agent must be east of pos23 (pos33) and push left. 

Agent is at pos24. How to get to pos33? 

From pos24, agent can move to pos34 (dirright), then to pos33 (dirup). 

But time to adjust the plan:

After stone1 is at pos23 (agent at pos24):

Agent moves:

pos24 → pos34 (dirright)

pos34 → pos33 (dirup)

Then, from pos33, agent can push stone1 from pos23 to pos22 (dirleft).

But stone is at pos23, agent at pos33. To push west (dirleft) from pos23 to pos22, agent needs to be east of pos23 (pos24). Wait, pos23's east is pos24. So agent at pos24 can push west to pos22? No, pos23 is row2, column3. East is row2, column4 (pos24). So agent at pos24 can push stone1 from pos23 to pos22 (dirleft). Wait, no. To push from pos23 to pos22, the agent must be at pos23's east (pos24) and push west. So yes, agent at pos24 can push stone1 from pos23 to pos22.

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirleft.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos24 (yes).

- Stone at pos23 (yes).

- pos22 is clear (yes).

- Can move from pos24 to pos23 (dirup) → allowed.

- Can move from pos23 to pos22 (dirleft) → allowed.

- pos22 is non-goal (yes).

After pushing, stone1 is at pos22, agent at pos23.

Then push from pos22 to pos32 (dirright). Since pos32 is a goal, use pushtogoal.

Agent needs to be west of pos22 (pos12) and push east (dirright), or south or north? Wait, pos22 is row2, column2. To push east (dirright, row+1) to pos32 (row3, column2). So agent needs to be west of pos22 (pos12) and push east.

But agent is at pos23. To get to pos12, need to move:

pos23 → pos13 (dirleft) → pos13 → pos12 (dirdown).

But this is a long path. Alternatively, agent at pos23 can move to pos22 (dirleft), but pos22 has the stone now. So agent can't. Alternative approach: after pushing to pos22, agent is at pos23. Then, agent moves to pos24 (dirdown), pos24 → pos34 (dirright), pos34 → pos33 (dirup), pos33 → pos32 (dirup). But pos32 is the goal for the stone. Alternatively, the agent can push the stone from pos22 to pos32 via another path.

Wait, to push from pos22 to pos32 (dirright), the agent needs to be west of pos22 (pos12) and push east. But how to get there.

This is getting very complicated. Let's try to find a different path that satisfies all constraints.

Alternative approach:

1. Agent moves to pos25 to satisfy constraint 3.

But pos35 must remain clear. So agent can move to pos25, then leave.

After visiting pos25, the agent must ensure that pos55 is not clear or stone1 is at pos13. So after visiting pos25, the agent can move to pos55, making it not clear.

But how to fit this into the plan.

Let's outline a tentative plan step-by-step, considering all constraints:

1. Agent moves from pos15 to pos25 (dirright). Satisfies constraint 3.

Now, according to constraint 4, after being at pos25, either pos55 is not clear or stone1 is at pos13. Let's choose to make pos55 not clear by having the agent move there later.

2. Agent moves from pos25 to pos24 (dirup).

3. Agent moves from pos24 to pos34 (dirright).

4. Agent moves from pos34 to pos44 (dirright) → can't, so alternative path.

But stone is at pos44. So agent needs to go around to push it.

Alternative steps after step 1:

2. Agent moves from pos25 to pos24 (dirup).

3. Agent moves from pos24 to pos34 (dirright).

4. Agent moves from pos34 to pos33 (dirup).

5. Agent moves from pos33 to pos43 (dirright).

6. Agent pushes stone1 from pos44 to pos43 (dirup). But pos43 is a non-goal. Then, push to pos33 (dirleft), then to pos23 (dirleft), then to pos22 (dirleft), then to pos32 (dirright).

But this requires many steps. Also, after pushing to pos43, the agent is at pos44. Then push to pos43 (dirup) requires the agent to be at pos44 and push up.

But pos43 is non-goal, so pushtonongoal.

This is getting too time-consuming. Perhaps the optimal plan is as follows, but ensuring all constraints are met:

```
move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos43 dirup
move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos33 dirleft
move player1 pos33 pos23 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos23 dirup
move player1 pos23 pos22 dirleft
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos32 dirright
```

But this is likely incorrect and doesn't satisfy all constraints. 

Given the time constraints, I'll propose a plan that moves the stone from pos44 to pos34, then to pos33, then to pos32, ensuring the stone was at pos23 before pos32. However, this doesn't include pos23. Therefore, perhaps the stone must be routed through pos23. 

The correct plan must include pushing the stone to pos23 before pos32. This requires a longer path. Given the complexity, the final answer would require careful step-by-step actions that navigate all constraints.
