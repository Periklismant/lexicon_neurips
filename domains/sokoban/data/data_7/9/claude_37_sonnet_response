Let me analyze the problem:

1. We have a 2D grid (5x5 positions from pos11 to pos55).
2. We have an agent "player1" and a stone "stone1".
3. We need to move stone1 to a goal location (pos45 is the only goal location).
4. Initially, player1 is at pos35 and stone1 is at pos34.

The constraints:
1. "Location pos33 is not clear" must hold in at most one continuous sequence of states.
2. "player1 is at location pos24" must hold in at least one state.
3. If "player1 is at location pos24" holds in some state s, then "player1 is at location pos22" must hold at s or at some state after s.
4. "Location pos21 is not clear" must hold in at least one state.
5. "Location pos34 is not clear" must hold in at most one continuous sequence of states.
6. "Location pos25 is clear" must hold in every state.
7. "player1 is at location pos34" must hold in at least one state.
8. If "player1 is at location pos34" holds in some state s, then "At least one of the following conditions is true: "stone1 is at location pos22", "stone1 is at location pos43" must hold at s or at some state after s.
9. "player1 is at location pos33" must hold in at least one state.
10. If "player1 is at location pos33" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which "player1 is at location pos22" is true.

Let's think about how to solve this:

We need to move the stone to the goal location (pos45). Currently, the stone is at pos34, and the player is at pos35. The player needs to push the stone to pos45, which is a goal location.

Actually, let's first build a mental model of the grid to better understand the problem:

```
    1   2   3   4   5  
  +---+---+---+---+---+
1 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
2 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
3 |   |   |   | S | P |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
4 |   |   |   |   | G |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
5 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
```

Here, P is the player (at pos35), S is the stone (at pos34), and G is the goal location (at pos45).

The most direct approach would be to move the player to pos33 (left of the stone), and then push the stone right to the goal location. However, this would violate constraint 10, which says that before being at pos33, the player must have been at pos22.

So, the player needs to go to pos22 first, then to pos33, and then push the stone to the goal. Additionally, the player needs to visit pos24 (constraint 2), and after visiting pos24, the player must also visit pos22 (constraint 3).

The plan should also ensure that constraint 8 is satisfied: after the player is at pos34, the stone should be at either pos22 or pos43.

Given the constraints, here's a tentative plan:

1. Move from pos35 to pos25 (left).
2. Move from pos25 to pos24 (up). Now constraint 2 is satisfied.
3. Move from pos24 to pos23 (up).
4. Move from pos23 to pos22 (up). Now, constraint 3 is satisfied.
5. Move from pos22 to pos32 (right).
6. Move from pos32 to pos33 (down). Now, constraint 9 is satisfied, and constraint 10 is also satisfied (player was at pos22 before pos33).
7. Move from pos33 to pos34 (down). Now, constraint 7 is satisfied.
8. From pos34, we need to ensure the stone is at either pos22 or pos43 (constraint 8). 
   - Maybe we can push the stone to one of these locations.
   - Push the stone from pos34 to pos33 (up) using pushtonongoal.
   - Push the stone from pos33 to pos32 (up) using pushtonongoal.
   - Push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (left) using pushtonongoal. Now, constraint 8 is satisfied.
9. We've satisfied the condition for constraint 8, but we still need to move the stone to the goal. From pos22, we need to bring the stone back to pos45.
   - From pos22 (where the player is now), move to pos21 (up).
   - Move from pos21 to pos31 (right).
   - Move from pos31 to pos32 (down).
   - From pos32, push the stone to pos33 (down).
   - From pos33, push the stone to pos34 (down).
   - From pos34, push the stone to pos44 (right).
   - From pos44, push the stone to pos45 (down), which is the goal. This will be a pushtogoal action.

Let me think about the constraints again:

1. "Location pos33 is not clear" must hold in at most one continuous sequence of states. This means that pos33 can only be occupied in one continuous sequence. In our plan, the stone passes through pos33 twice, which might violate this constraint.
2. "player1 is at location pos24" must hold in at least one state. This is satisfied in our plan.
3. If "player1 is at location pos24" holds in some state s, then "player1 is at location pos22" must hold at s or at some state after s. This is satisfied in our plan.
4. "Location pos21 is not clear" must hold in at least one state. In our plan, the player visits pos21, making it not clear.
5. "Location pos34 is not clear" must hold in at most one continuous sequence of states. Hmm, the stone is initially at pos34 and later passes through it again in our plan, which might violate this constraint.
6. "Location pos25 is clear" must hold in every state. In our plan, the player passes through pos25, which would make it not clear at one point. This might violate the constraint.
7. "player1 is at location pos34" must hold in at least one state. This is satisfied in our plan.
8. If "player1 is at location pos34" holds in some state s, then "At least one of the following conditions is true: "stone1 is at location pos22", "stone1 is at location pos43" must hold at s or at some state after s. In our plan, after the player is at pos34, the stone is moved to pos22, satisfying this constraint.
9. "player1 is at location pos33" must hold in at least one state. This is satisfied in our plan.
10. If "player1 is at location pos33" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which "player1 is at location pos22" is true. This is satisfied in our plan.

Hmm, there are issues with constraints 1, 5, and 6. Let's rethink the plan:

First, I've realized I made a mistake about constraint 6. I was thinking "Location pos25 is clear" means that the player or stone cannot be there, but it actually means that the location is clear of the stone (the player can be there).

After reconsideration, I realized I was misinterpreting some constraints. "Location X is not clear" typically means that there's a stone at that location. The player being at a location does not make it "not clear." The player is treated separately.

So, constraints 1 and 5 are about the stone, not the player:
- Constraint 1: "Location pos33 is not clear" (the stone can only be at pos33 in one continuous sequence).
- Constraint 5: "Location pos34 is not clear" (the stone can only be at pos34 in one continuous sequence).

Given this interpretation, let's revise the plan:

1. The stone is initially at pos34.
2. We want to push the stone to the goal location (pos45).
3. The player needs to visit pos22, pos24, pos33, and pos34.
4. If the player is at pos34, the stone should later be at either pos22 or pos43.
5. The stone can only be at pos33 and pos34 in one continuous sequence each.

Given these constraints, I think the stone's path should be:
pos34 -> pos44 -> pos45 (goal)

But there's a challenge with constraint 8. If the player is at pos34, the stone needs to be at pos22 or pos43 later. But with the direct path above, the stone would go from pos34 to pos44, and not pass through pos22 or pos43.

Maybe we can push the stone to one of these locations first, and then to the goal?

Let's revise the plan again:

1. The player is at pos35 and the stone is at pos34.
2. The player moves to pos25 (left).
3. The player moves to pos24 (up). Now constraint 2 is satisfied.
4. The player moves to pos23 (up).
5. The player moves to pos22 (up). Now, constraint 3 is satisfied (after being at pos24, the player must also visit pos22).
6. The player moves to pos32 (right).
7. The player moves to pos33 (down). Now, constraint 9 is satisfied, and constraint 10 is also satisfied (player was at pos22 before pos33).
8. The player moves to pos34 (down). Now, constraint 7 is satisfied (player has been at pos34).
9. The player pushes the stone from pos34 to pos44 (right) using pushtonongoal.
10. The player moves from pos34 to pos24 (left).
11. The player moves from pos24 to pos34 (right).
12. The player moves from pos34 to pos43 (up).
13. The player pushes the stone from pos44 to pos43 (up) using pushtonongoal. Now, constraint 8 is satisfied (after the player is at pos34, the stone is at pos43).
14. The player pushes the stone from pos43 to pos44 (down) using pushtonongoal.
15. The player pushes the stone from pos44 to pos45 (down) using pushtogoal. Now the goal is achieved.

Actually, I'm a bit confused about constraint 8 again. It says, "If the player is at pos34, then 'At least one of the following conditions is true: stone1 is at location pos22, stone1 is at location pos43' must hold at s or at some state after s."

This means that after the player is at pos34, the stone should be at pos22 or pos43 in the same state or in a future state.

Hmm, wait, I think I'm overthinking this. Let's just go with a simpler plan:

1. The player starts at pos35 and the stone at pos34.
2. The player moves to pos25 (left). Goal: to later visit pos24 and pos22.
3. Player moves from pos25 to pos24 (up). Constraint 2 is satisfied.
4. Player moves from pos24 to pos23 (up).
5. Player moves from pos23 to pos22 (up). Constraint 3 is satisfied.
6. Player moves from pos22 to pos32 (right).
7. Player moves from pos32 to pos33 (down). Constraint 9 and 10 are satisfied.
8. Player moves from pos33 to pos34 (down). Constraint 7 is satisfied.
9. The player pushes the stone from pos34 to pos43 (right) using pushtonongoal. Now, constraint 8 is satisfied.
10. The player pushes the stone from pos43 to pos44 (down) using pushtonongoal.
11. The player pushes the stone from pos44 to pos45 (down) using pushtogoal. Goal achieved.

Let's check the constraints again:

1. "Location pos33 is not clear" must hold in at most one continuous sequence of states. In our plan, the stone is never at pos33, so this constraint is satisfied.
2. "player1 is at location pos24" must hold in at least one state. This is satisfied at step 3.
3. If "player1 is at location pos24" holds in some state s, then "player1 is at location pos22" must hold at s or at some state after s. This is satisfied as the player moves to pos22 after being at pos24.
4. "Location pos21 is not clear" must hold in at least one state. Hmm, in our plan, the player or stone never goes to pos21, so this constraint is not satisfied.
5. "Location pos34 is not clear" must hold in at most one continuous sequence of states. In our plan, the stone is initially at pos34 and is pushed away in step 9, and never returns to pos34, so this constraint is satisfied.
6. "Location pos25 is clear" must hold in every state. The stone never goes to pos25 in our plan, so this constraint is satisfied.
7. "player1 is at location pos34" must hold in at least one state. This is satisfied at step 8.
8. If "player1 is at location pos34" holds in some state s, then "At least one of the following conditions is true: "stone1 is at location pos22", "stone1 is at location pos43" must hold at s or at some state after s. This is satisfied as the stone is at pos43 after the player is at pos34.
9. "player1 is at location pos33" must hold in at least one state. This is satisfied at step 7.
10. If "player1 is at location pos33" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which "player1 is at location pos22" is true. This is satisfied as the player is at pos22 before being at pos33.

We need to revise the plan to satisfy constraint 4. Let's make the player pass through pos21:

1. The player starts at pos35 and the stone at pos34.
2. Player moves from pos35 to pos25 (left).
3. Player moves from pos25 to pos24 (up). Constraint 2 is satisfied.
4. Player moves from pos24 to pos23 (up).
5. Player moves from pos23 to pos22 (up). Constraint 3 is satisfied.
6. Player moves from pos22 to pos21 (up). Constraint 4 is satisfied as the player is at pos21.
7. Player moves from pos21 to pos22 (down).
8. Player moves from pos22 to pos32 (right).
9. Player moves from pos32 to pos33 (down). Constraint 9 and 10 are satisfied.
10. Player moves from pos33 to pos34 (down). Constraint 7 is satisfied.
11. The player pushes the stone from pos34 to pos43 (right) using pushtonongoal. Now, constraint 8 is satisfied.
12. The player pushes the stone from pos43 to pos44 (down) using pushtonongoal.
13. The player pushes the stone from pos44 to pos45 (down) using pushtogoal. Goal achieved.

This should satisfy all constraints.

Actually, while writing out the actions, I realized I made a mistake in the direction format. Here's the direction mapping based on the problem description:
- dirleft: Move left (e.g., from posXY to posWY where W = X-1)
- dirright: Move right (e.g., from posXY to posZY where Z = X+1)
- dirup: Move up (e.g., from posXY to posXW where W = Y-1)
- dirdown: Move down (e.g., from posXY to posXZ where Z = Y+1)

So, my above plan was wrong in terms of directions. I'll correct this:

1. The player starts at pos35 and the stone at pos34.
2. Player moves from pos35 to pos25 (dirleft).
3. Player moves from pos25 to pos24 (dirup).
4. Player moves from pos24 to pos23 (dirup).
5. Player moves from pos23 to pos22 (dirup).
6. Player moves from pos22 to pos21 (dirup).
7. Player moves from pos21 to pos22 (dirdown).
8. Player moves from pos22 to pos32 (dirright).
9. Player moves from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown).
10. Player moves from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown).
11. The player pushes the stone from pos34 to pos43 (dirright) using pushtonongoal.
12. The player pushes the stone from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown) using pushtonongoal.
13. The player pushes the stone from pos44 to pos45 (dirdown) using pushtogoal. Goal achieved.

But wait, I think I need to revise my understanding of the directions. Based on the connections provided in the problem, pos11 to pos21 is dirright, and pos11 to pos12 is dirdown. So, we have:
- pos11 to pos21 (dirright): Moving from the 1st column to the 2nd column (positive X direction).
- pos11 to pos12 (dirdown): Moving from the 1st row to the 2nd row (positive Y direction).

With this understanding, let's revise:

1. The player starts at pos35 and the stone at pos34.
2. Player moves from pos35 to pos25 (dirleft).
3. Player moves from pos25 to pos24 (dirup).
4. Player moves from pos24 to pos23 (dirup).
5. Player moves from pos23 to pos22 (dirup).
6. Player moves from pos22 to pos21 (dirup).
7. Player moves from pos21 to pos22 (dirdown).
8. Player moves from pos22 to pos32 (dirright).
9. Player moves from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown).
10. Player moves from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown).
11. The player pushes the stone from pos34 to pos44 (dirright) using pushtonongoal.
12. The player pushes the stone from pos44 to pos43 (dirup) using pushtonongoal. Now, constraint 8 is satisfied (after the player is at pos34, the stone is at pos43).
13. The player pushes the stone from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown) using pushtonongoal.
14. The player pushes the stone from pos44 to pos45 (dirdown) using pushtogoal. Goal achieved.

That still seems right, but let's sanity-check one more time. The problem says "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright". Looking at the positions, pos11 should be in row 1, column 1, and pos21 should be in row 2, column 1. But if dirright moves in the positive X direction, it would go from pos11 to pos12, not pos21.

Let's double-check: 
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

So, from pos11, dirright takes you to pos21, and dirdown takes you to pos12.

Oh, I think the naming convention is posCOLUMN_ROW, not posROW_COLUMN. 

So, posIJ would be at column I, row J. Using this convention:
- dirright: Move from column i to column i+1 at the same row.
- dirleft: Move from column i to column i-1 at the same row.
- dirdown: Move from row j to row j+1 at the same column.
- dirup: Move from row j to row j-1 at the same column.

With this understanding, let's revise the plan once more:

1. The player starts at pos35 (column 3, row 5) and the stone at pos34 (column 3, row 4).
2. Player moves from pos35 to pos25 (dirleft).
3. Player moves from pos25 to pos24 (dirup).
4. Player moves from pos24 to pos23 (dirup).
5. Player moves from pos23 to pos22 (dirup).
6. Player moves from pos22 to pos21 (dirup).
7. Player moves from pos21 to pos22 (dirdown).
8. Player moves from pos22 to pos32 (dirright).
9. Player moves from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown).
10. Player moves from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown).
11. The player pushes the stone from pos34 to pos44 (dirright) using pushtonongoal.
12. The player pushes the stone from pos44 to pos43 (dirup) using pushtonongoal. Now, constraint 8 is satisfied (after the player is at pos34, the stone is at pos43).
13. The player pushes the stone from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown) using pushtonongoal.
14. The player pushes the stone from pos44 to pos45 (dirdown) using pushtogoal. Goal achieved.

This should be correct.

Let's enumerate the plan using the exact syntax:

1. "move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft"
2. "move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup"
3. "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup"
4. "move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup"
5. "move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup"
6. "move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown"
7. "move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright"
8. "move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown"
9. "move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown"
10. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos34 pos44 dirright"
11. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos43 dirup"
12. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos44 dirdown"
13. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirdown"

Actually, I've made a basic misunderstanding in the pushtonongoal and pushtogoal actions. Let's revisit the action descriptions:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.

So, the agent (player) is at l_p, and is pushing the stone from l_from to l_to.

Revisiting steps 10-13:

10. At this point, the player is at pos34 and the stone is at pos34. The player can't be in the same position as the stone. This seems inconsistent.

Let me think again about how the pushing action works.

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.

For example, if the player is at (1,1) and wants to push a stone at (1,2) to (1,3), the action would be:
"pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown"

With this understanding, and considering the initial state where the player is at pos35 and the stone is at pos34, let's revise the plan:

1. "move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft"
2. "move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup"
3. "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup"
4. "move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup"
5. "move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup"
6. "move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown"
7. "move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright"
8. "move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown"
9. "move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown"
10. "move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown"  # Move from pos34 to pos35 to be behind the stone
11. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos44 dirright"  # Push the stone right
12. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos43 dirup"  # Push the stone up
13. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos44 dirdown"  # Push the stone down
14. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirdown"  # Push the stone down to the goal

Wait, action 10 is wrong. The player is already at pos34, but the stone is also at pos34. So, the player can't move to pos35 because that would mean passing through or jumping over the stone, which isn't allowed.

I think I need to rethink the scenario, especially the initial conditions.

Initially, the player is at pos35 and the stone is at pos34. This means the player is below the stone (or south of the stone). The player can push the stone upward (northward). But wait, there's a contradiction here. If the player is at pos35 and the stone is at pos34, they are adjacent and the player can push the stone. But then, in a 2D grid-like structure, pos35 should be below pos34 (assuming a 1-based index where pos11 is the top-left, etc.), which means the player is pushing the stone downward (southward), not upward.

Actually wait, looking at the available connections, it seems like the Y-coordinate increases as you go down (south). For example:
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"
- "You may move from location pos12 to location pos11 following direction dirup"

This means pos12 is below pos11 (increase in Y), and dirdown means moving down (increasing Y).

With this understanding, initially, the player is at pos35 (column 3, row 5) and the stone is at pos34 (column 3, row 4). This means the player is below (south of) the stone. The player can push the stone upward (northward).

Actually, I think the preconditon for the push action is slightly different from what I originally thought. Let's revisit:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is a goal location.

This says the player is at l_p, the stone is at l_from, and we're pushing the stone to l_to.

But more importantly, precondition (iv) says "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d", which indicates the player should be adjacent to the stone, and the direction of push is the direction from the player to the stone (i.e. it gives the direction the player is facing, not the direction the stone moves).

For the initial state, the player is at pos35 and the stone is at pos34. The player would be pushing the stone from the south (which is actually dirup, since increasing index means going south).

So, from the initial state, the player would push the stone using:
"pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos24 dirup"

No wait, that's incorrect again. If the stone is at pos34 and the player is pushing it up (which is the direction from the player to the stone), then the stone would move to pos33. But if the Y-coordinate increases as you move down (as per our previous observation), then pushing the stone up would mean the stone moves to a position with a smaller Y-coordinate, which would be pos33.

Let's go back to the basics. The problem says:

- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

This means pos21 is to the right of pos11, and pos12 is below pos11. So, the indexing is column, then row. And the directions are intuitive:
- dirright: Move right (increase column)
- dirleft: Move left (decrease column)
- dirdown: Move down (increase row)
- dirup: Move up (decrease row)

With this understanding:
- pos35 is at column 3, row 5 (bottom of column 3).
- pos34 is at column 3, row 4 (above pos35).

Initially, the player is at pos35 and the stone is at pos34. To push the stone, the player needs to be adjacent to the stone and move in the direction of the stone. If the player is at pos35 and the stone is at pos34, the player would push the stone using the direction dirup (moving up from pos35 to pos34).

But, more importantly, for the push action, the direction d isn't the direction the stone moves, but the direction the player is facing (i.e., the direction from the player to the stone). The stone will move one step in the same direction.

So, for the initial state, if the player at pos35 wants to push the stone at pos34 upward to pos33, the action would be:
"pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirup"

This is because the player is at pos35, the stone is at pos34, and the player is pushing the stone in the direction dirup. As a result, the stone moves from pos34 to pos33.

Alright, with this understanding, let's revise the plan:

1. "move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft"
2. "move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup"
3. "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup"
4. "move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup"
5. "move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup"
6. "move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown"
7. "move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright"
8. "move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown"
9. "move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright"
10. "move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown"
11. "move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft"  # Go to pos34, constraint 7 is satisfied
12. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos14 dirleft"  # Push the stone left
13. "move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright"  # Go back to pos34
14. "move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright"  # Go to pos44
15. "move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup"  # Go to pos43
16. "move player1 pos43 pos33 dirup"  # Go to pos33, constraint 9 is satisfied
17. "move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup"  # Go to pos32
18. "move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup"  # Go to pos22, constraint 3 is satisfied
19. "move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright"  # Go to pos32
20. "move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright"  # Go to pos42
21. "move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown"  # Go to pos43
22. "move player1 pos43 pos33 dirup"  # Go to pos33
23. "move player1 pos33 pos23 dirup"  # Go to pos23
24. "move player1 pos23 pos13 dirup"  # Go to pos13
25. "move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown"  # Go to pos14
26. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos14 pos24 dirdown"  # Push the stone down to pos24
27. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirdown"  # Push the stone down to pos34
28. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirdown"  # Push the stone down to pos44
29. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos43 dirup"  # Push the stone up to pos43, constraint 8 is satisfied
30. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos44 dirdown"  # Push the stone down to pos44
31. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirdown"  # Push the stone down to the goal

However, I think there's still a misunderstanding, especially in step 12. If the player is at pos34 and the stone is also at pos34, they can't be at the same position.

OK wait, I think the "Location posXY is clear" means exactly what it says - that the location posXY is clear, i.e., it doesn't have a stone at it. The problem says "the stone is at location pos34", which means the stone is at pos34, and the player is at pos35. These are two different locations, and they are adjacent.

As the stone is at pos34, we have:
- Location pos34 is not clear (because the stone is there)
- Location posXY is clear (for all other locations posXY except pos34)

Let me re-revise the plan from the beginning.

The initial state was described in the problem as "player1 is at location pos35" and "stone1 is at location pos34". Originally, I had used some incorrect indicators of the state of the grid:

The initial state is:
- Player is at pos35 (column 3, row 5).
- Stone is at pos34 (column 3, row 4).
- The only goal location is pos45 (column 4, row 5).

In the initial state, Location pos34 is actually clear according to the problem: "Location pos34 is clear". But this contradicts the earlier statement that "stone1 is at location pos34". I think "Location pos34 is clear" means it doesn't have the stone at it. Although the state says "stone1 is at location pos34", I think "Location pos34 is clear" in the original state description is a typo; the stone is definitely at pos34 in the initial state.

Given the information in the problem, let's revise the plan again:

1. "move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft" - Player moves left.
2. "move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup" - Player moves up, satisfying constraint 2.
3. "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup" - Player continues moving up.
4. "move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup" - Player continues moving up, satisfying constraint 3.
5. "move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup" - Player moves to pos21, satisfying constraint 4.
6. "move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown" - Player moves back to pos22.
7. "move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright" - Player moves to pos32.
8. "move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown" - Player moves to pos33, satisfying constraint 9 and 10.
9. "move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown" - Player moves to pos34, satisfying constraint 7.
10. Now, the player is at pos34 and the stone is at pos34. But they can't be at the same position. This is a contradiction.

Wait, let me check the original state again: "player1 is at location pos35" and "stone1 is at location pos34". And at the end of the original state description, it says "Location pos34 is clear", "Location pos35 is clear". These statements contradict each other.

Hmm, maybe the "Location posXY is clear" state in the initial description is just to say that the initial state of the stones is different from what's just described? I.e., the stone is NOT at pos34 and the player is NOT at pos35?

Let me re-read the instructions more carefully.

I went back to the original problem description. On re-reading, I see these statements in the initial state:

"player1 is at location pos35"
"stone1 is at location pos34"
"Location pos11 is clear"
"Location pos12 is clear"
...
"Location pos34 is clear"  // This is the contradiction.
"Location pos35 is clear"  // This is the contradiction.

If the player is at pos35, then pos35 should NOT be clear. Similarly, if the stone is at pos34, then pos34 should NOT be clear.

I'm guessing that "Location posXY is clear" means the location can be moved into, i.e., it doesn't have a stone or another object blocking it (but it can have the player). If so, then the player's position, pos35, can still be considered "clear" in the initial state.

So, the initial state could be:
- Player is at pos35.
- Stone is at pos34.

But, in this case, "Location pos34 is clear" does contradict the fact that the stone is at pos34. Maybe the problem description has an error, or I'm missing something.

Or maybe "Location posXY is clear" really just refers to whether there's a stone there. If so, then "Location pos34 is clear" contradicts "stone1 is at location pos34". Unless the problem has a typo, the stone is not at pos34 in the initial state, or I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Actually, I think the issue is that the description is listing the parts of the state that are GOING to be true after the initialization, not what's currently true. It's saying that player1 WILL BE at location pos35, and stone1 WILL BE at location pos34, but right now (in the meta state where all the objects are being set) it's saying location pos34 is clear. Once the initialization is done, the stone will be at pos34, so it will no longer be clear.

Assuming the initial state is as described:
- Player is at pos35.
- Stone is at pos34.

Let's continue with the plan:

1. "move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft" - Player moves left.
2. "move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup" - Player moves up, satisfying constraint 2.
3. "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup" - Player continues moving up.
4. "move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup" - Player continues moving up, satisfying constraint 3.
5. "move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup" - Player moves to pos21, satisfying constraint 4.
6. "move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown" - Player moves back to pos22.
7. "move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright" - Player moves to pos32.
8. "move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown" - Player moves to pos33, satisfying constraint 9 and 10.
9. "move player1 pos33 pos23 dirup" - Player moves up.
10. "move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown" - Player moves to pos24 (already visited once, constraint 2).
11. "move player1 pos24 pos34 dirdown" - Player moves to pos34, satisfying constraint 7.

Wait, but now the player is at pos34 and the stone is also at pos34. This seems like a contradiction. Unless the stone has been moved, which isn't the case in our plan so far.

Oh, I think I indeed misunderstood. I'm mixing up the "clear" descriptions with the "is at" descriptions. Clear means there's no stone or player there. "is at" means the stone or player is there. But in the original state description, the player and stone can't be in the same spot, and indeed they aren't. The player is at pos35, and the stone is at pos34.

But then, when I look at the initial state description, it says "Location pos34 is clear" and "Location pos35 is clear." If the player is at pos35, then pos35 shouldn't be clear. Similarly, if the stone is at pos34, then pos34 shouldn't be clear. This suggests I'm misunderstanding what "clear" means, or there's an inconsistency in the problem description.

Let's try another approach. Let's reindex the grid to better understand the problem:

Assume a 5x5 grid where the top-left corner is (1,1) and the bottom-right corner is (5,5).

The player is at pos35, which is (3,5), and the stone is at pos34, which is (3,4). The goal is at pos45, which is (4,5).

OK, I'm rereading the problem. I misunderstood the pushtogoal and pushtonongoal actions. 

Actually, I went through the preconditions of the pushing actions again. The stone and the player can't be at the same position. For a pushing action, the player is at l_p, the stone is at l_from, and they're pushing the stone to l_to.

Given the initial state:
- Player is at pos35 (column 3, row 5).
- Stone is at pos34 (column 3, row 4).

If the player wants to push the stone from pos34 to pos33, the player is currently at pos35, the stone is at pos34, and the direction the player is moving to get from pos35 to pos34 is dirup.

Hence, the action would be:
"pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirup"

Actually, let's now think step by step:

1. I want the player to go to various positions to satisfy constraints. From the initial position pos35, the player should visit:
   - pos24 (constraint 2)
   - pos22 (constraint 3, after visiting pos24)
   - pos21 (constraint 4)
   - pos33 (constraint 9, after visiting pos22)
   - pos34 (constraint 7)

2. In the initial state, the player is at pos35 and the stone is at pos34. If the player moves to pos34, the stone must move. So the player must push the stone at some point.

3. If the player visits pos34, then the stone must later be at pos22 or pos43 (constraint 8).

4. The stone can only be at pos33 and pos34 (or not at all) in at most one continuous sequence of states (constraints 1 and 5).

5. The stone must eventually be at a goal location (pos45).

Given these constraints, especially constraint 8, I think a plan should involve pushing the stone from pos34 to pos43, and then eventually to pos45.

Here's a plan:

1. "move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft" - Player moves left.
2. "move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup" - Player moves up, satisfying constraint 2.
3. "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup" - Player continues moving up.
4. "move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup" - Player continues moving up, satisfying constraint 3.
5. "move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup" - Player moves to pos21, satisfying constraint 4.
6. "move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown" - Player moves back to pos22.
7. "move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright" - Player moves to pos32.
8. "move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown" - Player moves to pos33, satisfying constraint 9 and 10.
9. "move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup" - Player moves up.
10. "move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright" - Player moves to pos42.
11. "move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown" - Player moves to pos43.
12. "move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown" - Player moves to pos44.
13. "move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown" - Player moves to pos45.
14. "move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft" - Player moves back to pos35.
15. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirup" - Player pushes the stone up.
16. "move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright" - Player moves to pos44.
17. "move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup" - Player moves to pos43.
18. "move player1 pos43 pos33 dirup" - Player moves to pos33.
19. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos43 dirright" - Player pushes the stone right, satisfying constraint 8.
20. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos44 dirdown" - Player pushes the stone down.
21. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirdown" - Player pushes the stone to the goal.

But there's a problem at step 19. The player is at pos33, the stone is at pos33, and the player wants to push the stone to pos43. This implies the player and stone are in the same position, which isn't possible.

I think I need to reconsider the plan.

Given the constraints and the complexity of the pushing action, let's focus on the constraints and construct a simpler plan:

1. "move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft" - Player moves left.
2. "move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup" - Player moves up, satisfying constraint 2.
3. "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup" - Player continues moving up.
4. "move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup" - Player continues moving up, satisfying constraint 3.
5. "move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup" - Player moves to pos21, satisfying constraint 4.
6. "move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown" - Player moves back to pos22.
7. "move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright" - Player moves to pos32.
8. "move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown" - Player moves to pos33, satisfying constraint 9 and 10.
9. "move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright" - Player moves to pos43.
10. "move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown" - Player moves to pos44.
11. "move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown" - Player moves to pos45.
12. "move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft" - Player moves back to pos35.
13. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirup" - Player pushes the stone up from pos34 to pos33.
14. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos43 dirright" - Player pushes the stone right from pos33 to pos43, satisfying constraint 8.
15. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos44 dirdown" - Player pushes the stone down from pos43 to pos44.
16. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirdown" - Player pushes the stone to the goal.

Actually, there's still an issue with the pushing actions. After pushing the stone from pos34 to pos33, the player will be at pos34, not pos33. So, the player can't immediately push the stone from pos33 to pos43 without first moving to pos33.

Let's revise the plan one more time:

1. "move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft" - Player moves left.
2. "move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup" - Player moves up, satisfying constraint 2.
3. "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup" - Player continues moving up.
4. "move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup" - Player continues moving up, satisfying constraint 3.
5. "move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup" - Player moves to pos21, satisfying constraint 4.
6. "move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown" - Player moves back to pos22.
7. "move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright" - Player moves to pos32.
8. "move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown" - Player moves to pos33, satisfying constraint 9 and 10.
9. "move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown" - Player moves to pos34, satisfying constraint 7.
10. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos34 pos44 dirright" - Player pushes the stone right from pos34 to pos44.
11. "move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup" - Player moves to pos33.
12. "move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright" - Player moves to pos43.
13. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos43 dirup" - Player pushes the stone up from pos44 to pos43, satisfying constraint 8.
14. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos44 dirdown" - Player pushes the stone down from pos43 to pos44.
15. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirdown" - Player pushes the stone to the goal.

Wait, at Step 10, there's a problem. If the player is at pos34 and the stone is also at pos34, then they're in the same position. The player is supposed to push the stone while the player is at l_p, the stone is at l_from, and the player is trying to push the stone to l_to.

I think I've been misunderstanding the problem. Let me go back and reread it.

OK, so here are the revised constraints about the pushing action from the problem:
"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is a goal location.

So, in a pushing action, the agent is at l_p and the stone is at l_from. For the push to be valid, the agent must be able to get from l_p to l_from following direction d. This suggests the agent and stone are adjacent, and the agent is trying to move in the direction of the stone.

For example, if the player is at (3,5) and the stone is at (3,4), and the player wants to push the stone to (3,3), then:
l_p = (3,5), l_from = (3,4), l_to = (3,3), d = dirup

The action would be:
"pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirup"

After this action, the player would be at (3,4) (previously l_from) and the stone would be at (3,3) (previously l_to).

With this understanding, let's revise the plan once more:

1. "move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft" - Player moves left.
2. "move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup" - Player moves up, satisfying constraint 2.
3. "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup" - Player continues moving up.
4. "move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup" - Player continues moving up, satisfying constraint 3.
5. "move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup" - Player moves to pos21, satisfying constraint 4.
6. "move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown" - Player moves back to pos22.
7. "move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright" - Player moves to pos32.
8. "move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown" - Player moves to pos33, satisfying constraint 9 and 10.
9. "move player1 pos33 pos23 dirup" - Player moves to pos23.
10. "move player1 pos23 pos33 dirdown" - Player moves back to pos33.
11. "move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright" - Player moves to pos43.
12. "move player1 pos43 pos33 dirup" - Player moves back to pos33.
13. "move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown" - Player moves to pos34, satisfying constraint 7.
14. "move player1 pos34 pos24 dirup" - Player moves to pos24.
15. "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup" - Player moves to pos23.
16. "move player1 pos23 pos33 dirdown" - Player moves to pos33.
17. "move player1 pos33 pos23 dirup" - Player moves to pos23.
18. "move player1 pos23 pos33 dirdown" - Player moves to pos33.
19. "move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown" - Player moves down.
20. "move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown" - Player moves to pos35.
21. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirup" - Player pushes the stone up from pos34 to pos33.
22. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos43 dirright" - Player pushes the stone right from pos33 to pos43, satisfying constraint 8.
23. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos44 dirdown" - Player pushes the stone down from pos43 to pos44.
24. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirdown" - Player pushes the stone to the goal.

Steps 9-20 are unnecessary repetitions and back-and-forth movements. Let's streamline the plan:

1. "move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft" - Player moves left.
2. "move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup" - Player moves up, satisfying constraint 2.
3. "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup" - Player continues moving up.
4. "move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup" - Player continues moving up, satisfying constraint 3.
5. "move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup" - Player moves to pos21, satisfying constraint 4.
6. "move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown" - Player moves back to pos22.
7. "move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright" - Player moves to pos32.
8. "move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown" - Player moves to pos33, satisfying constraint 9 and 10.
9. "move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown" - Player moves to pos34, satisfying constraint 7.
10. "move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown" - Player moves to pos35.
11. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirup" - Player pushes the stone up from pos34 to pos33.
12. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos43 dirright" - Player pushes the stone right from pos33 to pos43, satisfying constraint 8.
13. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos44 dirdown" - Player pushes the stone down from pos43 to pos44.
14. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirdown" - Player pushes the stone to the goal.

This seems like a consistent and efficient plan. Let's double-check if it satisfies all the constraints:

1. "Location pos33 is not clear" must hold in at most one continuous sequence of states. In our plan, the stone is at pos33 only once, from step 11 to step 12, so this constraint is satisfied.
2. "player1 is at location pos24" must hold in at least one state. The player is at pos24 in step 2, so this constraint is satisfied.
3. If "player1 is at location pos24" holds in some state s, then "player1 is at location pos22" must hold at s or at some state after s. The player is at pos24 in step 2 and at pos22 in step 6, so this constraint is satisfied.
4. "Location pos21 is not clear" must hold in at least one state. The player is at pos21 in step 5, so this constraint is satisfied.
5. "Location pos34 is not clear" must hold in at most one continuous sequence of states. In our plan, the stone is at pos34 only once, at the beginning until step 11, so this constraint is satisfied.
6. "Location pos25 is clear" must hold in every state. The player passes through pos25 once in step 1, but the stone never goes there, so this constraint is satisfied.
7. "player1 is at location pos34" must hold in at least one state. The player is at pos34 in step 9, so this constraint is satisfied.
8. If "player1 is at location pos34" holds in some state s, then "At least one of the following conditions is true: "stone1 is at location pos22", "stone1 is at location pos43" must hold at s or at some state after s. The player is at pos34 in step 9, and the stone is at pos43 in step 12, so this constraint is satisfied.
9. "player1 is at location pos33" must hold in at least one state. The player is at pos33 in step 8, so this constraint is satisfied.
10. If "player1 is at location pos33" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which "player1 is at location pos22" is true. The player is at pos33 in step 8 and at pos22 in step 6, so this constraint is satisfied.

All constraints are satisfied!

Let's go with this plan:

1. "move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft" - Player moves left.
2. "move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup" - Player moves up, satisfying constraint 2.
3. "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup" - Player continues moving up.
4. "move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup" - Player continues moving up, satisfying constraint 3.
5. "move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup" - Player moves to pos21, satisfying constraint 4.
6. "move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown" - Player moves back to pos22.
7. "move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright" - Player moves to pos32.
8. "move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown" - Player moves to pos33, satisfying constraint 9 and 10.
9. "move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown" - Player moves to pos34, satisfying constraint 7.
10. "move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown" - Player moves to pos35.
11. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirup" - Player pushes the stone up from pos34 to pos33.
12. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos43 dirright" - Player pushes the stone right from pos33 to pos43, satisfying constraint 8.
13. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos44 dirdown" - Player pushes the stone down from pos43 to pos44.
14. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirdown" - Player pushes the stone to the goal.
