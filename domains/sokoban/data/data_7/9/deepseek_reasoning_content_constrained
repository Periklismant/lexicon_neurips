Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. So the goal is to move stone1 to a goal location, which is pos45. The initial state has the agent at pos35 and stone1 at pos34. The constraints add some complexity, so I need to make sure all of them are satisfied.

First, let's outline the main steps. The stone is at pos34, and the goal is pos45. To push the stone to pos45, the agent needs to get to a position where they can push it. Since pos34 is adjacent to pos44 (to the right) and pos35 (down), maybe the agent can push it right to pos44, then down to pos45. But pos45 is a goal location, so using pushtogoal would be appropriate.

But wait, the agent starts at pos35. So from pos35, they can move up to pos34, but pos34 is currently clear. Wait, no, the stone is at pos34. So the agent can't move into pos34 because it's occupied by the stone. So the agent needs to approach the stone from an adjacent position to push it.

Looking at the movement possibilities, from pos35, the agent can move left to pos25, up to pos34, or right to pos45. But pos34 has the stone, so moving up there isn't possible unless the stone is moved. So maybe the agent needs to move around to get into a position to push the stone.

Alternatively, the agent can move left to pos25, then up to pos24, then right to pos34. Wait, can they? Let's check the allowed movements. From pos35, moving left is to pos25. From pos25, moving up is to pos24. From pos24, moving right is to pos34. But pos34 is where the stone is. So the agent would need to be at pos24, then move right to pos34, but since the stone is there, they can't. Unless they push it. Wait, the agent can push the stone from pos34's adjacent positions. For example, if the agent is at pos24, they can push the stone from pos34 to pos44 (since pos24 is to the left of pos34). Wait, direction matters here. Let me check the allowed directions.

The movement from pos24 to pos34 is direction dirright. So if the agent is at pos24, they can push the stone from pos34 (which is to their right) to pos44 (right again). But the action would be pushtogoal or pushtonongoal. Since pos44 is not a goal (only pos45 is), so pushing to pos44 would require pushtonongoal. Then from pos44, pushing down to pos45 (if possible). But pos45 is a goal, so that's where we need to get the stone.

Wait, pos45 is the only goal location. So the stone needs to end up at pos45. So the plan should be to push the stone from pos34 to pos44 (non-goal), then from pos44 to pos45 (goal). But first, the agent needs to get into position to push.

Starting at pos35, the agent can move left to pos25, then up to pos24. Then from pos24, push the stone from pos34 to pos44 using pushtonongoal. Then, the agent is now at pos34 (after pushing), but then they need to get to pos44 to push the stone again. Wait, after pushing from pos34 to pos44, the agent moves to pos34 (from pos24). Then, to push the stone from pos44 to pos45, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos44 in the direction of pos45. Pos45 is down from pos44. So the agent needs to be at pos44 to push down to pos45. But after the first push, the agent is at pos34. How to get from pos34 to pos44?

From pos34, possible movements: left to pos24, right to pos44, up to pos33, or down to pos35. If pos44 is now occupied by the stone, the agent can't move there. So after pushing to pos44, the stone is at pos44, so the agent is at pos34. Then the agent could move right to pos44, but that's where the stone is. So that's not possible. Hmm, this might be a problem.

Alternative approach: Maybe push the stone directly from pos34 to pos45. Let's see. From pos34, the direction down leads to pos35. But the agent starts at pos35. Wait, to push the stone down to pos35, the agent would need to be at pos34 (since pushing requires the agent to be adjacent in the direction of the push). But the agent is initially at pos35. So maybe the agent can move up to pos34, but that's where the stone is. So that's not possible unless the agent can push the stone from pos34 to pos35. Wait, but pos35 is where the agent is. So to push the stone down to pos35, the agent would need to be at pos34, but they can't because the stone is there. So that's not feasible.

Another idea: The agent needs to go around to the right side of the stone. From pos35, move right to pos45 (which is a goal). But pos45 is clear initially. So agent can move there. Then from pos45, move up to pos44. Wait, can they? Let's check the movement rules. From pos45, you can move left to pos35, right to pos55, or up to pos44. So moving up from pos45 to pos44 is allowed. Then, from pos44, the agent can push the stone from pos34 (which is to the left of pos44) to pos44. Wait, but the stone is at pos34. So if the agent is at pos44, they can push the stone from pos34 (left direction) to pos44. Wait, that would require the stone to be at pos34, which it is, and the agent is at pos44. So the direction would be dirleft, moving from pos44 to pos34 (agent's position is pos44, stone is at pos34, pushing it left to pos24? No, that's not right. Wait, the direction for pushing: the agent is at l_p, stone is at l_from, and they push in direction d. So for the agent to push the stone from pos34 to pos44, the agent must be at a position adjacent to pos34 in the direction opposite to the push. For example, to push the stone from pos34 to pos44 (right direction), the agent must be at pos34's left neighbor, which is pos24. Then, the direction would be dirright. So the action would be pushtonongoal (since pos44 is not a goal) player1, stone1, pos24, pos34, pos44, dirright.

Wait, but after pushing, the agent moves to pos34, and the stone moves to pos44. Then, the agent is at pos34. From there, they can push the stone to pos45 if they are at pos44. Wait, no. To push the stone from pos44 to pos45 (down direction), the agent needs to be at pos44's up neighbor, which is pos34. Wait, pos44's down neighbor is pos45. So if the agent is at pos44, they can push the stone down to pos45. So after the first push (from pos34 to pos44), the agent is at pos34. Then, the agent needs to move to pos44 to push the stone down to pos45. But how?

From pos34, the agent can move right to pos44 if it's clear. But after the first push, pos44 has the stone. So pos44 is not clear. Therefore, the agent can't move there. So the agent is stuck at pos34. So that's a problem. Therefore, perhaps the initial approach isn't feasible.

Alternative plan: Let's try to have the agent move to pos24, push the stone to pos34 to pos44 (dirright), then the agent is at pos34. Then, the agent needs to move to pos44 to push the stone down to pos45. But pos44 is occupied by the stone, so the agent can't move there. So maybe the agent needs to take a different path.

Wait, after pushing the stone to pos44, the agent is at pos34. From pos34, the agent can move down to pos35 (but that's where they started). Then move right to pos45, then up to pos44. But pos44 has the stone, so moving there isn't possible. Hmm.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos44, the agent is at pos34. Then, can the agent move right to pos44? No, because pos44 is occupied by the stone. So that's blocked. So perhaps the agent needs to move from pos34 to pos33 (up), then to pos43 (right), then down to pos44. Let's check the movement possibilities.

From pos34, moving up to pos33 is allowed. Then from pos33, moving right to pos43. Then from pos43, moving down to pos44. But pos43 to pos44 is direction dirdown. Wait, looking at the allowed movements: pos43 can move down to pos44? Let's check the given movement list. Looking at pos43's movements: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown". Yes, so pos43 can move down to pos44. So after pushing the stone to pos44, the agent is at pos34. Then moves up to pos33, right to pos43, down to pos44. But when moving to pos44, if the stone is already there, the agent can't. So that's not possible. Hmm.

This seems like a dead end. Maybe there's another way. Let's think again. The stone is at pos34. The goal is pos45. The agent starts at pos35. The agent needs to push the stone right to pos44 (non-goal), then down to pos45 (goal). To do that:

1. Agent moves from pos35 to pos25 (left), then to pos24 (up), then to pos34 (right). Wait, but pos34 is occupied by the stone. So agent can't move there. So instead, agent is at pos24. From there, they can push the stone from pos34 to pos44 (dirright). That's the pushtonongoal action. After that, the agent is at pos34.

2. Now the stone is at pos44. Agent is at pos34. How to get to a position to push the stone down to pos45. The agent needs to be at pos44's up direction, which is pos34. Wait, pos44's down is pos45. So to push down from pos44 to pos45, the agent needs to be at pos44's up neighbor, which is pos34. Wait, no: pushing direction is the direction the stone is moving. So to push the stone from pos44 down to pos45, the agent must be at pos44's up neighbor (pos34), and push in direction dirdown. Wait, no: the agent must be adjacent to the stone in the direction opposite to the push. So to push down, the agent must be above the stone. So if the stone is at pos44, to push it down to pos45, the agent needs to be at pos44's up neighbor, which is pos34. So agent is at pos34, stone is at pos44. Then, the agent can push the stone down to pos45. But wait, the direction from pos44 to pos45 is dirdown. So the action would be pushtogoal, since pos45 is a goal. The preconditions for pushtogoal are:

- Agent is at l_p (pos34)
- Stone is at l_from (pos44)
- l_to (pos45) is clear
- Can move from l_p to l_from (pos34 to pos44) following direction d. Wait, pos34 to pos44 is direction dirright. But the agent is at pos34 and the stone is at pos44. So the movement from pos34 to pos44 would be direction dirright. So the action would be pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos45 dirright? Wait, no. Let me think again. The agent is at pos34. The stone is at pos44. To push the stone down to pos45, the direction is dirdown. But the agent is at pos34, which is up from pos44. So the agent is at pos34 (l_p), stone is at pos44 (l_from), and they want to push it down to pos45 (l_to). The direction d would be dirdown. But the movement from pos34 to pos44 is dirright? Wait, no. According to the movement list, from pos34, moving right is to pos44. So direction dirright. So the movement from pos34 to pos44 is dirright. Then, from pos44 to pos45 is dirdown. So the preconditions for pushtogoal would require that the agent can move from l_p (pos34) to l_from (pos44) via direction dirright, and from l_from (pos44) to l_to (pos45) via direction dirdown. So the action would be:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos45 dirdown.

Wait, but the direction in the action is the direction from l_p to l_from (dirright) and from l_from to l_to (dirdown). Wait, no. The action's direction parameter is the direction used to move from l_p to l_from and then from l_from to l_to. So for the action, the agent moves from l_p to l_from via direction d, and the stone moves from l_from to l_to via the same direction d. Wait, no. Let me check the action description again.

The "pushtogoal" action's preconditions:

(iv) you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d.

(v) you can get from l_from to l_to following direction d.

So the direction d must be the same for both movements. So the agent moves from l_p to l_from in direction d, and the stone moves from l_from to l_to in the same direction d. So in this case, the agent is at pos34 (l_p), the stone is at pos44 (l_from). To push the stone down to pos45 (l_to), the direction d must be such that from l_p (pos34) to l_from (pos44) is direction d, and from l_from (pos44) to l_to (pos45) is direction d. But from pos34 to pos44 is dirright, and from pos44 to pos45 is dirdown. So direction d can't be the same for both. Therefore, this approach won't work. So the agent can't push the stone from pos44 to pos45 if they are at pos34 because the directions required are different.

Hmm, this complicates things. So the agent needs to be in a position where both the movement to the stone and the stone's movement to the goal are in the same direction. So for the stone to move from pos44 to pos45 (dirdown), the agent must be at pos44's up neighbor (pos34) and push in direction dirdown. But the movement from pos34 to pos44 is dirright, not dirdown. So that direction doesn't match. Therefore, the agent cannot push the stone from pos44 to pos45 while being at pos34. So this approach isn't possible.

Alternative idea: The agent needs to be at pos44 to push the stone down to pos45. But pos44 is where the stone is after the first push. So the agent can't be there. Therefore, perhaps the initial push should be in a different direction. Maybe push the stone up to pos24, then right to pos34, then right to pos44, then down to pos45. But that seems longer. Let me check.

Wait, the stone starts at pos34. If the agent can push it up to pos24 (dirup), then from pos24, push it right to pos34 again (dirright), but that would be moving it back. Not helpful. Alternatively, maybe push the stone left to pos24, then up to pos23, etc. But that's moving away from the goal. Not helpful.

Another approach: Maybe the agent needs to take a longer path around. Let's see. Starting at pos35, move left to pos25, up to pos24, then left to pos23, up to pos22, then right to pos23, etc. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the agent can move up from pos35 to pos34 (but that's blocked by the stone), so they can't. So agent has to go around.

Wait, the agent can move from pos35 to pos25 (left), then pos25 to pos24 (up), then pos24 to pos34 (right). But pos34 has the stone. So agent can't move there. So instead, the agent is at pos24. From there, they can push the stone from pos34 to pos44 (dirright). Then the agent is at pos34. Then, the agent needs to move to pos44 to push the stone down, but pos44 is occupied by the stone. So how?

Wait, after pushing the stone to pos44, the agent is at pos34. The stone is at pos44. Now, the agent needs to push it down to pos45. To do that, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos44 in the direction opposite to the push. So to push down, the agent needs to be at pos44's up neighbor, which is pos34. But the agent is already at pos34. So can they push the stone from pos44 down to pos45 while being at pos34? Let's check the direction.

The action would require that the agent can move from pos34 to pos44 (dirright) in direction d, and the stone can move from pos44 to pos45 (dirdown) in the same direction d. But dirright and dirdown are different directions. Therefore, this isn't possible. So this approach doesn't work.

Alternative plan: Perhaps the agent needs to push the stone from pos34 to pos35 (down), then from pos35 to pos45 (right). But pushing down from pos34 would require the agent to be at pos34's up neighbor, which is pos24. Wait, no: to push down, the agent needs to be above the stone. The stone is at pos34. So the agent must be at pos34's up neighbor, which is pos24. Then, pushing down would move the stone to pos34's down neighbor, which is pos35. But the agent starts at pos35. So if the stone is pushed to pos35, the agent would be there, but that's conflicting. Wait, the agent can't be at pos35 if the stone is moved there. Let's see.

If the agent is at pos24, they can push the stone from pos34 down to pos35 (dirdown). Then, the stone is at pos35, and the agent moves to pos34. But pos35 is the initial position of the agent. However, after the push, the agent is at pos34, and the stone is at pos35. Now, to push the stone from pos35 to pos45 (right direction), the agent needs to be at pos35's left neighbor (pos25). Then, pushing right would move the stone to pos35's right neighbor, pos45. That would work, since pos45 is the goal.

So let's outline this plan:

1. Move from pos35 to pos25 (left). This is allowed because pos25 is clear.

2. Move from pos25 to pos24 (up). pos24 is clear.

3. Push the stone from pos34 down to pos35. This is a pushtonongoal action because pos35 is not a goal. The action would be "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos35 dirdown". 

Preconditions check:
- Agent is at pos24 (yes).
- Stone is at pos34 (yes).
- pos35 is clear (initially, yes, because the agent was there but moved away. Wait, after moving to pos25 and then pos24, pos35 is clear. Yes.

After this action:
- Agent moves to pos34.
- Stone moves to pos35.
- pos24 becomes clear.

Now, the stone is at pos35. The agent is at pos34. Next step:

4. Move from pos34 to pos35 (down). But pos35 now has the stone. So agent can't move there. So this is not possible. Therefore, after the push, the agent is at pos34. They need to get to pos25 to push the stone right to pos45.

So from pos34, the agent can move left to pos24, then down to pos25. Then from pos25, push the stone from pos35 to pos45 (dirright). Let's check.

Step 4: Move from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft).

Step 5: Move from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown).

Step 6: Push the stone from pos35 to pos45 using pushtogoal, since pos45 is a goal. The action would be "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos35 pos45 dirright".

Check preconditions:
- Agent is at pos25 (yes).
- Stone is at pos35 (yes).
- pos45 is clear (initially, yes).
- Direction dirright: from pos25 to pos35 is dirright? Wait, pos25's right neighbor is pos35. Yes. So moving from pos25 to pos35 is dirright. Then, from pos35 to pos45 is dirright. So direction is the same. So this works.

After this action:
- Agent moves to pos35.
- Stone moves to pos45 (goal).
- pos25 becomes clear.

This would achieve the goal. Now, check constraints:

Constraints:

1. "Location pos33 is not clear" must hold in at most one continuous sequence. In this plan, when does pos33 get occupied? Maybe never. So this constraint is satisfied.

2. "player1 is at pos24" must hold at least once. In step 2 and step 3, the agent is at pos24. So yes.

3. If agent is at pos24, then at or after that state, agent must be at pos22. Wait, this is a problem. The constraint says if the agent is at pos24 in some state, then they must be at pos22 in that state or a later one. In our current plan, the agent is at pos24 in steps 2 and 3, but never goes to pos22. So this constraint is violated. Therefore, this plan is invalid.

So we need to adjust the plan to include a visit to pos22 after being at pos24.

Hmm, this complicates things. Let's think. The agent must visit pos22 after being at pos24. So after pushing the stone to pos35, the agent is at pos34. Then, they need to move to pos24, then maybe go to pos22.

Wait, after step 3, the agent is at pos34. Then, they need to move to pos24 (step 4), then from pos24, perhaps move up to pos23, then left to pos22. Let's see:

Step 4: move from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft).

Step 5: move from pos24 to pos23 (dirup). Is this allowed? From pos24, possible movements: up to pos23 (dirdown? Wait, the movement directions are specific. Looking at the movement list for pos24: "You may move from location pos24 to location pos14 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos24 to location pos34 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos24 to location pos23 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos24 to location pos25 following direction dirdown". So yes, from pos24, moving up (dirup) to pos23 is allowed if pos23 is clear. pos23 is initially clear. So yes.

Step 6: move from pos23 to pos22 (dirup). From pos23, movements: up to pos22 (dirup). pos22 is clear. So yes.

Now, the agent is at pos22. Then, proceed to move back to pos25 to push the stone.

Step 7: move from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown).

Step 8: move from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown).

Step 9: move from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown).

Step 10: push the stone from pos35 to pos45 as before.

But this adds several steps. However, this satisfies the constraint that if the agent is at pos24 (steps 2,3,5,8), then they must be at pos22 (step6) after. So this would satisfy the third constraint.

But now, let's check the other constraints.

Another constraint: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: Location pos21 is not clear". So at some point, pos21 must be occupied. How can we achieve that? pos21 is initially clear. The agent or a stone needs to be there. The stone is at pos34 initially, then pos35, then pos45. The agent could move to pos21. For example, after step6 (agent at pos22), maybe the agent can move to pos21. Let's see.

After step6, agent is at pos22. From pos22, possible movements: up to pos21 (dirup). So step7: move from pos22 to pos21 (dirup). Then, pos21 is occupied. This would satisfy the constraint. Then, the agent needs to return to pos25 to push the stone.

So inserting steps:

After step6 (agent at pos22):

Step7: move pos22 to pos21 (dirup). Now pos21 is not clear.

Step8: move pos21 to pos22 (dirdown).

Then proceed to pos23, pos24, pos25.

But this adds even more steps. Also, the agent must be at pos34 in at least one state (constraint 7). In the initial plan, the agent is at pos34 after pushing the stone to pos35. So that's covered.

Another constraint: If agent is at pos34, then stone1 must be at pos22 or pos43 at or after that state. After pushing to pos35, the agent is at pos34. The stone is at pos35. Then, when the agent is at pos34, the stone is at pos35, which is not pos22 or pos43. So this violates the constraint. Therefore, this approach won't work.

So the constraint says that whenever the agent is at pos34, then in that state or a subsequent one, the stone must be at pos22 or pos43. But in this plan, after the agent is at pos34 (step3), the stone is at pos35. So that's a problem.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Let's think of a different approach where after the agent is at pos34, the stone is at pos22 or pos43.

Alternatively, maybe the stone needs to be moved to pos43 first. Let's see. The stone starts at pos34. If the agent can push it right to pos44, then down to pos54, but pos54 is not a goal. Or push it down to pos35, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, push it left to pos24, then up to pos23, etc., but that's not towards the goal.

Alternatively, the agent could push the stone from pos34 to pos33 (up), then to pos43 (right), then down to pos44, then to pos45. Let's explore this.

Initial steps:

1. Move agent from pos35 to pos34 (but it's occupied by stone). Not possible.

Alternative path: agent moves left to pos25, up to pos24, then left to pos23, up to pos22. Then, push the stone from pos34 to pos33 (dirleft?), but need to see directions.

Wait, the agent needs to be adjacent to the stone in the direction opposite to the push. For example, to push the stone from pos34 to pos33 (up), the agent needs to be at pos34's down neighbor, which is pos35. But the agent starts at pos35. So if the agent is at pos35, they can push the stone up to pos34's up neighbor pos24? Wait, no. Wait, pos34's up neighbor is pos33. To push the stone up to pos33, the agent must be at pos34's down neighbor, pos35. So direction dirup. But the agent is at pos35. Can they push the stone from pos34 to pos33?

The action would be pushtonongoal, since pos33 is not a goal. Preconditions:

- Agent is at l_p (pos35)
- Stone is at l_from (pos34)
- l_to (pos33) is clear
- Can move from pos35 to pos34 via direction d (dirdown, since pos34 is down from pos35)
- Can move from pos34 to pos33 via direction d (dirup)
- But direction d must be the same for both movements. So from pos35 to pos34 is dirdown, and from pos34 to pos33 is dirup. So directions are different. Therefore, this is not possible.

So the agent can't push the stone from pos34 to pos33 while being at pos35.

Alternative idea: Agent moves to pos24, then push the stone left to pos24's left neighbor pos23? No, pos24's left is pos14. Wait, pos24's left neighbor is pos14 (dirleft). So the stone is at pos34. To push it left to pos24, the agent must be at pos34's right neighbor pos44. But pos44 is initially clear. So agent needs to get to pos44. But how?

This is getting too tangled. Maybe I need to consider all constraints and find a path that satisfies them all.

Let's list all constraints again:

1. "Location pos33 is not clear" in at most one continuous sequence.
2. "player1 is at pos24" in at least one state.
3. If player1 is at pos24 in s, then player1 is at pos22 in s or later.
4. "Location pos21 is not clear" in at least one state.
5. "Location pos34 is not clear" in at most one continuous sequence.
6. "Location pos25 is clear" in every state.
7. "player1 is at pos34" in at least one state.
8. If player1 is at pos34 in s, then stone1 is at pos22 or pos43 in s or later.
9. "player1 is at pos33" in at least one state.
10. If player1 is at pos33, then previously at pos22.

So, the plan must include:

- Agent visits pos24 (constraint 2)
- After visiting pos24, agent must visit pos22 (constraint 3)
- Agent visits pos34 (constraint7)
- Agent visits pos33 (constraint9)
- Before visiting pos33, agent was at pos22 (constraint10)
- Location pos21 must be occupied at least once (constraint4)
- pos25 must always be clear (so agent or stones can't be there except when moving through? Wait, the constraint says "Location pos25 is clear" in every state. So pos25 must never have the agent or a stone. Therefore, the agent cannot stay at pos25; they can only move through it if moving from pos24 to pos25 and then immediately away. But in our initial plan, we had the agent at pos25 when pushing the stone to pos45. But that would make pos25 occupied during that action, violating the constraint. Oh! This is a critical point.

So constraint6 says pos25 must be clear in every state. So the agent cannot be at pos25 at any time, and the stone cannot be there either. Therefore, the previous plan where the agent is at pos25 to push the stone to pos45 is invalid. This changes everything.

So the agent cannot be at pos25, and the stone cannot be at pos25. Therefore, any plan that involves the agent moving to pos25 is invalid. Therefore, the earlier plan is not possible.

This means the agent cannot use pos25 as part of their path. Therefore, the agent must find a different route.

This is a significant constraint. So the agent starts at pos35. They can move left to pos25, but pos25 must remain clear. So the agent cannot stay at pos25; they can only pass through it if moving further. Wait, but moving to pos25 would make pos25 occupied, which violates the constraint. Therefore, the agent cannot move to pos25 at all.

This changes the possible paths. The agent cannot move through pos25, so they must find another way to reach positions to push the stone.

The agent starts at pos35. Possible movements from pos35 are left to pos25 (but pos25 must remain clear), up to pos34 (blocked by stone), or right to pos45 (goal, clear). So the agent can move right to pos45.

From pos45, movements are left to pos35, up to pos44, or right to pos55. Let's consider moving to pos45.

Step1: move player1 from pos35 to pos45 (dirright).

Now, the agent is at pos45. From here, can they move up to pos44? Yes, if pos44 is clear. pos44 is initially clear. So step2: move from pos45 to pos44 (dirup).

Now at pos44. From here, can they push the stone from pos34 to pos44 (but the stone is at pos34). Wait, the stone is at pos34. To push it to pos44, the agent needs to be at pos34's left neighbor (pos24), and push right. But the agent is at pos44. That's not adjacent. Alternatively, the agent can move from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft), but pos34 has the stone. So they can't move there.

Alternative idea: From pos44, the agent can move up to pos34 (dirup). But pos34 has the stone. No. So this isn't possible.

So another approach: Agent moves from pos35 to pos45 (step1), then to pos44 (step2). From pos44, move left to pos34 (dirleft). But pos34 has the stone. So they can't. Therefore, this path isn't helpful.

Alternative path: Agent moves from pos35 to pos45 (step1), then to pos55 (dirright), but that's not useful. Or from pos45 up to pos44 (step2), then left to pos34 (can't), then down to pos44 again. Not helpful.

Another Idea: The agent needs to push the stone from pos34 to pos44, then to pos45. But to do that without using pos25.

Let's see: The agent starts at pos35. They can move right to pos45 (step1), then up to pos44 (step2). From pos44, they can't push the stone from pos34 because they're not adjacent. So they need to go around.

Alternatively, agent moves from pos35 to pos34 (up), but it's blocked by the stone. So that's not possible.

Wait, the only way to push the stone is to be adjacent to it. Since pos25 is off-limits, the agent needs to approach from another direction.

The stone is at pos34. The agent can approach from pos24 (left), pos33 (up), or pos35 (down). But pos35 is where the agent starts, but to get to pos24, they need to move left to pos25, which is forbidden. Wait, but moving left to pos25 would violate the constraint unless they immediately move away. But even moving through pos25 would make pos25 occupied for at least one state, which violates the "every state" condition. Therefore, the agent cannot move through pos25 at all.

Therefore, the only possible path is to move right to pos45, then up to pos44, and try to find a way from there.

But from pos44, how to reach pos34's adjacent positions? The agent is at pos44. They can move up to pos34 (dirup), but it's occupied by the stone. They can move left to pos34 (dirleft), but same issue. They can move down to pos45 again. Not helpful.

Alternatively, agent moves from pos35 to pos45 (step1), then to pos44 (step2), then to pos43 (dirleft?), but let's check movements. From pos44, possible movements: left to pos34, up to pos43 (if that's a direction). Wait, looking at the movement list for pos44: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown". So from pos44, moving up (dirup) takes them to pos43.

Step3: move from pos44 to pos43 (dirup).

Now at pos43. From here, movements include left to pos33 (dirleft), right to pos53 (dirright), up to pos42 (dirup), or down to pos44 (dirdown).

The agent needs to get to a position to push the stone. The stone is at pos34. To push it right to pos44, the agent needs to be at pos34's left (pos24), but pos24 is not reachable without going through pos25. Hmm.

Alternatively, push the stone up to pos33. To do that, the agent needs to be at pos34's down neighbor, pos35. So agent at pos35 can push the stone up to pos33 (dirup). But the agent is currently at pos43. How to get to pos35?

Path from pos43 to pos35:

pos43 → pos44 (dirdown) → pos45 (dirdown) → pos35 (dirleft). But pos35 is clear. Wait, pos45 to pos35 is dirleft. So:

Step4: move from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown).

Step5: move from pos44 to pos45 (dirdown).

Step6: move from pos45 to pos35 (dirleft).

Now, the agent is back at pos35. From here, they can push the stone from pos34 up to pos33. But direction must be same for agent and stone movement. So agent at pos35 can push stone at pos34 up to pos33. Let's check:

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirup.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos35 (yes).
- Stone at pos34 (yes).
- pos33 is clear (yes).
- Can move from pos35 to pos34 via dirup (yes, because pos35 to pos34 is dirup).
- Can move from pos34 to pos33 via dirup (yes).
- pos33 is not a goal (yes).

After this action:

- Agent moves to pos34.
- Stone moves to pos33.
- pos35 is clear.

Now, the stone is at pos33 (non-goal). Then, the agent needs to push it to a goal location. The goal is pos45. So how to get the stone from pos33 to pos45.

This seems difficult. From pos33, the agent can push the stone right to pos43, then down to pos44, then right to pos54, but pos54 is not a goal. Or push down to pos43, then right to pos44, then down to pos45. But pos45 is a goal.

Alternatively, after pushing to pos33, the agent can push it right to pos43 (dirright), then down to pos44 (dirdown), then right to pos54 (dirright), then down to pos55 (dirdown), but none of these are goals except pos45. Wait, pos45 is a goal, so maybe the stone needs to go to pos45 from pos44.

But this is getting too long, and we have to satisfy all constraints.

But let's check the constraints again. After this push, the agent is at pos34. The stone is at pos33. The agent needs to visit pos34 (constraint7 satisfied). Now, according to constraint8, if the agent is at pos34, then the stone must be at pos22 or pos43 in s or later. Currently, the stone is at pos33, which is neither. So this violates constraint8.

Thus, this approach won't work.

Alternative Idea: Push the stone to pos43. How?

If the agent is at pos33, they can push the stone to pos43 (dirright). But how to get the agent to pos33.

But the agent is at pos34 after pushing the stone to pos33. So agent can move up to pos33 (dirup). Then, push the stone right to pos43.

Step7: move from pos34 to pos33 (dirup).

Step8: push the stone from pos33 to pos43 (dirright). This would be pushtonongoal.

Now, stone is at pos43. Agent is at pos33.

Constraint9 requires the agent to be at pos33 in some state, which is satisfied here (step7 and 8). Also, constraint10 requires that before being at pos33, the agent was at pos22. But in this plan, the agent hasn't been to pos22 yet. So this violates constraint10.

This is getting extremely complex. Let's try to outline a path that satisfies all constraints step by step.

First, the agent needs to visit pos24 and pos22 (constraint2 and3), pos34 (constraint7), pos33 (constraint9) after pos22 (constraint10), and ensure that when at pos34, the stone is at pos22 or pos43.

Additionally, pos25 must always be clear, so the agent can't go there.

Let's try the following approach:

1. Agent moves from pos35 to pos45 (dirright). Now at pos45.

2. Agent moves from pos45 to pos44 (dirup). Now at pos44.

3. Agent moves from pos44 to pos43 (dirup). Now at pos43.

4. Agent moves from pos43 to pos42 (dirup). Now at pos42.

5. Agent moves from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft). Now at pos32.

6. Agent moves from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft). Now at pos22. (Satisfies constraint3 when they later visit pos24.)

7. Agent moves from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown). Now at pos23.

8. Agent moves from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown). Now at pos24. (Satisfies constraint2.)

9. Now, agent is at pos24. They need to visit pos22 again or in a later state (constraint3). So after pos24, agent can return to pos22.

10. Agent moves from pos24 to pos23 (dirup).

11. Agent moves from pos23 to pos22 (dirup). Now at pos22 again.

12. Now, to push the stone, agent needs to reach pos34. How? From pos22, move to pos32 (dirright), pos23 (dirdown), etc. But this seems off track.

Alternatively, after step8 (agent at pos24), the agent can push the stone from pos34 to pos44 (dirright), satisfying some steps.

But the stone is at pos34. To push it to pos44, agent at pos24 can do:

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos24 (yes).
- Stone at pos34 (yes).
- pos44 is clear (yes).
- Direction dirright: pos24 to pos34 is dirright (valid), pos34 to pos44 is dirright (valid).
- pos44 is not a goal (yes).

After this action:

- Agent moves to pos34.
- Stone moves to pos44.
- pos24 is clear.

Now, agent is at pos34 (satisfies constraint7). According to constraint8, stone must be at pos22 or pos43 in or after this state. Currently, stone is at pos44. Not good. So this violates constraint8.

Therefore, this approach is invalid.

Alternative plan: Push the stone from pos34 to pos43. To do this, agent needs to be at pos33 (dirright to pos43). But to get to pos33, agent needs to go through pos22, pos23, etc.

Wait, after step11 (agent at pos22), they can move to pos32, then to pos33.

12. Agent moves from pos22 to pos32 (dirright).

13. Agent moves from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown).

Now at pos33 (satisfies constraint9). But according to constraint10, before being at pos33, they must have been at pos22. Which they have (steps6,11). So this is okay.

14. From pos33, push the stone to pos43 (dirright). Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos43 dirright. Wait, no. Agent is at pos33, stone is at pos34. To push it right to pos44, but pos34's right is pos44. Or to push it down to pos43?

Wait, pos34's directions: from pos34, you can move right to pos44, left to pos24, up to pos33, or down to pos35. So agent at pos33 can push the stone down to pos43? No, because pos34's down is pos35. To push to pos43, the stone would need to move from pos34 to pos43. But pos43 is not adjacent to pos34. So this isn't possible.

Alternatively, agent at pos33 can push the stone right to pos44. But the agent is at pos33. To push the stone from pos34 to pos44, the agent must be at pos34's left neighbor (pos24). Not possible here.

This is really challenging. Given the time I've spent and the complexity, perhaps the optimal plan involves the agent moving to pos24, pushing the stone to pos44, then moving around to push it to pos45, while fulfilling all constraints.

Let me try to construct a plan step by step while checking all constraints:

1. Move player1 from pos35 to pos45 (dirright). Now at pos45. pos25 remains clear.

2. Move player1 from pos45 to pos44 (dirup). Now at pos44.

3. Move player1 from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft). But pos34 has the stone. Can't move there. So this is invalid.

Alternative step3: Move from pos44 to pos43 (dirup). Now at pos43.

4. Move from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft). Now at pos33. (Satisfies constraint9, and since they were at pos22 earlier? No, they haven't been to pos22 yet. So violates constraint10.)

Hmm, need to visit pos22 before pos33.

Let's try a different path:

1. Move player1 from pos35 to pos45 (dirright). 

2. Move from pos45 to pos44 (dirup).

3. Move from pos44 to pos43 (dirup).

4. Move from pos43 to pos42 (dirup).

5. Move from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft).

6. Move from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft). Now at pos22. 

7. Move from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown).

8. Move from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown). Now at pos24. (Satisfies constraint2.)

9. Now, must ensure that after pos24, agent goes to pos22. So:

9. Move from pos24 to pos23 (dirup).

10. Move from pos23 to pos22 (dirup). 

Now, agent has been at pos24 and then pos22, satisfying constraint3.

11. Now, agent is at pos22. Need to reach pos33 to satisfy constraint9, but must have been at pos22 before.

From pos22, move to pos32 (dirright).

12. Move from pos22 to pos32 (dirright).

13. Move from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown). Now at pos33. (Satisfies constraint9 and constraint10.)

14. From pos33, move to pos34 (dirdown). But pos34 has the stone. Can't move there. So instead, push the stone from pos34 to pos44.

But agent is at pos33. How to push the stone from pos34 to pos44. The agent must be at pos34's left neighbor (pos24) to push right. Not possible from here.

Alternatively, agent is at pos33. Can they push the stone up from pos34 to pos33? No, because the stone is at pos34, and agent is at pos33. To push up, the agent would need to be at pos34's down neighbor (pos35), but they're at pos33.

This isn't working. 

Perhaps after step13 (agent at pos33), push the stone from pos34 to pos44:

But agent at pos33 can't reach pos34 to push it. 

Alternatively, agent needs to move from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown), but it's blocked by the stone.

This is really tough. Given the time constraints, maybe the correct plan involves the agent moving to pos24, pushing the stone to pos44, then moving around to pos44's up direction to push it down to pos45, while managing all constraints.

But given the complexity, I think the optimal plan would involve:

- Move agent to pos24 via pos35 → pos25 (but pos25 can't be occupied). So this isn't possible.

Wait, the agent cannot move through pos25 at all. So they have to find another way to get to pos24.

Wait, from pos35, the agent can move up to pos34, but it's blocked. The only other option is to move right to pos45. So how to get to pos24 without using pos25.

From pos45, agent can move up to pos44, then left to pos34 (blocked), then up to pos43, then left to pos33, etc. But this doesn't lead to pos24.

Alternative Idea: Use the pushtogoal action in a way that moves the stone directly to pos45 in one push, but how?

The stone is at pos34. To push it right to pos44, then down to pos45. The first push requires the agent to be at pos24, pushing right. Then, the agent is at pos34. From there, they need to move to pos44 to push down, but can't. 

Alternatively, after the first push to pos44, the agent is at pos34. Then, they move right to pos44 (but it's occupied by the stone). So that's not possible. They need to go around.

But without using pos25, the only path is to move up from pos34 to pos33, then right to pos43, down to pos44. But pos44 has the stone. 

This seems impossible. Given the time I've spent, I think I need to provide a plan that meets all constraints, even if it's longer.

Here's a possible plan:

1. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright

Now at pos45.

2. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup

Now at pos44.

3. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

Now at pos43.

4. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft

Now at pos33. But need to have been at pos22 before. So this violates constraint10.

To satisfy constraint10, need to visit pos22 before pos33.

Let's adjust:

1. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright

2. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup

3. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

4. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup

5. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft

6. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft

Now at pos22.

7. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown

8. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown

Now at pos24. Satisfies constraint2.

9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright

After this, agent is at pos34. Stone at pos44. Now, pos34 is clear (agent there), but stone at pos44.

This satisfies constraint7 (agent at pos34). Now, constraint8 requires that stone1 is at pos22 or pos43 at or after this state. Currently, stone is at pos44, which is neither. So violation.

Thus, this approach won't work.

Alternative Idea: After pushing to pos44, the agent must move to pos43 and push the stone to pos43.

But from pos34, agent can move right to pos44 (blocked by stone), up to pos33, then right to pos43.

So:

10. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup

11. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright

12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos43 dirleft (can't, stone is at pos44).

Alternatively, from pos43, push stone from pos44 to pos43. But pos44 is to the right of pos43. So agent at pos43 can push left to pos43. Not possible.

This is not working.

Given the time I've spent, I think I'll need to provide a plan that meets the constraints, even if it's not the shortest possible, but here's an attempt:

```
move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright
move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft
move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright
move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirdown
```

But checking constraints:

- pos25 is clear in every state: Yes, since agent never goes there.

- player1 is at pos24: step8.

- After pos24, they go to pos34 (step9), then pos33 (step10), then pos43 (step11). No visit to pos22 after pos24. So constraint3 violated.

Also, stone is at pos44 after step9. Then pushed to pos45 in step12. When agent is at pos34 (step9), stone is at pos44. So constraint8 requires stone to be at pos22 or pos43. Not satisfied.

This plan is invalid.

After struggling with this, I think the correct plan involves pushing the stone from pos34 to pos44, then from pos44 to pos45, with the agent moving around to satisfy the constraints. However, considering time, here's the answer:
