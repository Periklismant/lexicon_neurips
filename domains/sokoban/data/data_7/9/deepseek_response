move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos44 pos45 dirdown
```
But this is not correct. Due to the complexity and time constraints, the correct answer would require a more detailed and accurate path, but based on the given constraints and movement rules, the optimal valid plan is:

```
```
move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright
move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos34 pos45 dirdown
```
```

However, this doesn't satisfy all constraints. Due to the extensive constraints and movement limitations, the correct plan requires careful step-by-step execution that meets all conditions, but due to the complexity, the assistant might not arrive at the correct sequence within the allowed time.
