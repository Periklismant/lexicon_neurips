**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Move to pos44 (dirdown from pos43):** This satisfies the constraint that pos44 is not clear.
2. **Move to pos45 (dirdown from pos44):** Prepares for moving to pos55.
3. **Move to pos55 (dirright from pos45):** Fulfills the requirement for the agent to be at pos55.
4. **Return to pos45 (dirleft from pos55):** Necessary for backtracking.
5. **Move back to pos44 (dirup from pos45):** Continue backtracking.
6. **Move to pos34 (dirleft from pos44):** Positions the agent to reach pos24 and eventually pos23.
7. **Move to pos24 (dirleft from pos34):** Prepares to move to pos23.
8. **Move to pos23 (dirup from pos24):** Satisfies the constraint that the agent must be at pos23. Earlier steps ensure pos45 was not clear.
9. **Push stone from pos33 to pos43 (dirright):** Moves the stone to pos43, allowing the agent to later push it to the goal.
10. **Move to pos24 (dirdown from pos23):** Prepares for repositioning.
11. **Move to pos34 (dirright from pos24):** Continue repositioning.
12. **Move to pos44 (dirright from pos34):** Fulfills the pos44 constraint again.
13. **Move to pos43 (dirup from pos44):** Positions the agent to push the stone back north.
14. **Push stone to pos23 (dirleft from pos43):** Places the stone back at pos23 for the final push.
15. **Move to pos33 (dirleft from pos43):** Positions the agent for the final push.
16. **Move to pos34 (dirdown from pos33):** Continue to pos24.
17. **Move to pos24 (dirleft from pos34):** Final preparation to push the stone to the goal.
18. **Push stone to pos22 (dirup from pos24):** Achieves the goal by moving the stone to the goal location pos22.

This plan meets all constraints and ensures the stone reaches the goal while adhering to all specified conditions.
