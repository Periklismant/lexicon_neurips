Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. First, I need to understand the initial state and the goal. The agent (player1) starts at pos43, and stone1 is at pos33. The goal is to have stone1 at a goal location. From the problem description, the only goal location mentioned is pos22. Wait, looking back, yes, the original state lists "pos22 is a goal location" and all others are not. So the stone needs to end up at pos22.

But wait, the constraints mention that "stone1 is at location pos23" must hold in at least one state. But pos23 is not a goal location. So the plan must move the stone through pos23 before eventually getting it to pos22. Hmm, but the final goal is just that stone1 is at any goal location, which is pos22. So the stone needs to be moved from pos33 to pos22, possibly passing through pos23. Also, there are several constraints that need to be satisfied during the plan.

Let me list out all the constraints to ensure they are met:

1. Player1 must be at pos23 in at least one state. And if they are, then earlier there must be either player1 at pos32 or pos45 not clear.
2. Location pos44 must not be clear in at least one state.
3. Player1 must be at pos34 in at least one state. And when they are, then either at that state or later, player1 must be at pos44 or pos13 is not clear.
4. Player1 must be at pos55 in at least one state.
5. Location pos24 not clear can only hold in at most one continuous sequence. So pos24 can't be occupied in two separate time intervals; it's allowed once but not again after clearing.
6. Location pos33 must not be clear in at least one state. Since the stone starts at pos33, but initially, pos33 is clear? Wait, the original state says "Location pos33 is clear". Wait, but stone1 is at pos33. Wait, no: the original state says "stone1 is at location pos33" and "Location pos33 is clear". Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, let me check again.

Original state:
- "stone1 is at location pos33"
- "Location pos33 is clear"

Wait, that's impossible. If the stone is at pos33, then pos33 should not be clear. But according to the problem statement, in the original state, "Location pos33 is clear". This must be a mistake. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again.

Looking at the original state:

Under "The original state of the world is the following:"

- "player1 is at location pos43"
- "stone1 is at location pos33"
- Then a list of clear locations, including "Location pos33 is clear"

Wait, that's a contradiction. If a stone is at pos33, then pos33 is not clear. So this must be an error in the problem statement. But perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Maybe "clear" refers to being free for the agent to move into. Wait, the problem says "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So a location is clear if it doesn't have the agent or a stone. But the initial state says stone1 is at pos33 and pos33 is clear. That can't be. So maybe the problem statement has a mistake here, but perhaps I need to proceed as if it's correct. Wait, perhaps "clear" means something else. Wait, looking at the action effects: when you move, the agent leaves l_from and arrives at l_to. So "clear" probably means that the location is empty (no agent or stone). So if a stone is at pos33, pos33 is not clear. Therefore, the initial state has a contradiction. But since the problem is given, maybe there's a misinterpretation. Alternatively, perhaps "clear" refers to being not occupied by the agent. But that seems unlikely because the move action's preconditions require l_to to be clear, meaning the agent can't be there. So the problem statement must have an error here. But since the user provided this, I have to work with it. Maybe it's a typo. Let me check again.

Original state:

"Location pos33 is clear"

But also, "stone1 is at location pos33". So this is conflicting. That's a problem. But perhaps it's a mistake in the problem, and the actual initial state has pos33 not clear because the stone is there. So maybe the correct initial state is that pos33 is not clear. But the user provided that pos33 is clear. This is a problem. Wait, maybe the "clear" in the initial state is a mistake, but since the problem is given, I have to proceed. However, logically, if a stone is at pos33, pos33 cannot be clear. Therefore, perhaps the problem statement has a typo, and the actual initial state is that pos33 is not clear. But how to resolve this?

Alternatively, maybe "clear" refers to not having the agent. But then, the stone being there would not affect "clear". But in the move action's preconditions, the agent can only move to a clear location, which would mean a location without the agent or a stone. But that's not possible because if a stone is there, the agent can't move there. So perhaps the initial state is that pos33 is not clear (due to the stone), and the problem statement's mention of "Location pos33 is clear" is a mistake. But since the problem says that, maybe I have to proceed. But this is a critical issue because it affects the possible actions.

Wait, the problem states the original state includes "stone1 is at location pos33" and "Location pos33 is clear". That's a contradiction. Therefore, this must be an error. However, since the problem is presented as such, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the stone is at pos33, making pos33 not clear. Therefore, the correct initial state is that pos33 is not clear, and the given "Location pos33 is clear" is incorrect. But how to handle this? The user might have made a mistake, but as a solver, I have to follow the given data. But logically, this is impossible. So perhaps the problem intended that pos33 is clear, but stone1 is not there. But that contradicts the initial statement. Hmm. This is confusing. Maybe I should proceed with the given data as is, even if it's conflicting, but that would make the problem unsolvable.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the stone is actually at a different location. For example, maybe the stone is at pos34, but the problem says pos33. But I have to work with the given information. Wait, maybe "clear" refers to the agent's presence. So a location is clear if the agent is not there. Then, the stone's presence doesn't affect "clear". But in the move action's preconditions, you need the l_to to be clear, meaning the agent is not there. But stones can be there. But then, in the initial state, pos33 has a stone, but the agent is at pos43, so pos33 is clear (since the agent isn't there). That could make sense. So perhaps "clear" refers only to the agent's presence, not the stone's. That would resolve the contradiction. So, in that case, the initial state says "Location pos33 is clear" because the agent is not there, even though there's a stone. Then, when moving, the agent can move to a location that has a stone, but according to the move action's preconditions, l_to must be clear. But if "clear" means the agent is not present, then the presence of a stone doesn't block the agent from moving there. But that contradicts the problem's description, which states that a position may contain the agent, a stone, or be empty. So moving to a location with a stone would not be allowed because it's not clear (i.e., not empty). Therefore, there's a contradiction in the problem's initial state. 

This is a major issue. However, given that the problem is presented as such, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that "clear" refers to the absence of both agent and stones. Therefore, the initial state has a contradiction, but perhaps it's a typo, and the correct initial state is that pos33 is not clear. Therefore, stone1 is at pos33, making pos33 not clear. Therefore, the initial state's "Location pos33 is clear" is incorrect. But I have to proceed with the given data. This is a problem, but maybe the problem expects us to ignore that contradiction. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended that the stone is at pos33 but pos33 is clear, which is impossible. Therefore, the problem is unsolvable. But that can't be the case. 

Alternatively, maybe "clear" refers to the agent's presence only. So a location is clear if the agent is not there, regardless of stones. Then, the initial state's "Location pos33 is clear" is correct because the agent is not there. The stone's presence doesn't affect "clear". But then, when the agent wants to move to a location, they can move there even if there's a stone. But according to the problem description, each position can contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. So moving to a location with a stone would not be allowed. Therefore, the move action's precondition (ii) says "location l_to is clear", which would mean that l_to is empty (no agent or stone). Therefore, the initial state's "Location pos33 is clear" is incorrect if there's a stone there. 

Given this, perhaps the problem statement has a mistake, but I have to proceed. Let's assume that the stone is at pos33, making pos33 not clear, and the initial state's "Location pos33 is clear" is a mistake. So, in reality, pos33 is not clear. Therefore, the initial state is that pos33 has stone1, so it's not clear. The rest of the clear locations are as stated. 

Proceeding with that assumption, the agent starts at pos43, and stone1 is at pos33. The goal is to move stone1 to a goal location (pos22). Additionally, the plan must satisfy all the constraints listed.

Now, let's outline the steps needed to move the stone from pos33 to pos22. The agent needs to navigate to the stone and push it towards the goal. However, the constraints add extra requirements that must be met during the plan.

Let's list the constraints again to make sure I address each:

1. Player1 must be at pos23 in at least one state. When that happens, there must be a prior state where player1 was at pos32 or pos45 was not clear.
2. Location pos44 must be not clear (i.e., occupied) in at least one state.
3. Player1 must be at pos34 in at least one state. When that happens, in that state or later, player1 must be at pos44 or pos13 is not clear.
4. Player1 must be at pos55 in at least one state.
5. Location pos24 can only be not clear in one continuous sequence. So if pos24 is occupied (by agent or stone) during some steps, it can't be occupied again after being cleared.
6. Location pos33 must not be clear (i.e., occupied) in at least one state. Since the stone starts at pos33, which makes it not clear, this is already satisfied. But wait, the initial state says pos33 is clear, but if we corrected that, then initially pos33 is not clear. But the problem's original state says "Location pos33 is clear" and "stone1 is at location pos33", which is conflicting. So under the corrected assumption, pos33 is not clear. Therefore, the constraint that pos33 must not be clear in at least one state is already satisfied in the initial state. But the problem's initial state says pos33 is clear, so maybe this constraint requires that during the plan, pos33 is not clear again. Wait, the constraint says "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "Location pos33 is not clear"". But if in the initial state, pos33 is clear (as per the problem's statement), then this constraint is not satisfied. Therefore, we need to have pos33 not clear at some point. But if the initial state has pos33 clear (which is impossible with the stone there), then we need to make pos33 not clear. But how? Since the stone is already there, the problem's initial state must have a mistake, but assuming the problem's data is correct, this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's initial state is correct, and the "Location pos33 is clear" is true, which would mean that the stone is not there. But the problem also says "stone1 is at location pos33". This is a contradiction, making the problem unsolvable. However, since the user has provided this, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that "clear" refers only to the agent's presence, and stones do not affect clearness. Therefore, the stone can be at a location that is considered clear as long as the agent is not there. That would resolve the contradiction, but it's inconsistent with the problem's description. 

Given the time constraints, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that "clear" refers to the absence of the agent only, not the stone. Therefore, in the initial state, pos33 is clear (no agent) even though the stone is there. Then, moving to pos33 would require that it's clear (no agent), which it is. But pushing the stone would require the agent to be adjacent. Wait, the "pushtogoal" and "pushtonongoal" actions require the agent to be at l_p, adjacent to the stone's location l_from, and then push in direction d. So for example, to push the stone from pos33 to pos23 (direction dirleft), the agent would need to be at pos43 (south of pos33) and move north to pos33, pushing the stone west to pos23. But according to the movement directions, can the agent move from pos43 to pos33? Let's check the allowed movements.

Looking at the allowed moves from pos43:

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"
Wait, no. Let me check the list:

Looking at the "You may move..." statements:

- "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft": Yes, that's in the list.

Wait, let's look:

Original movement possibilities include:
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"

So the agent can move from pos43 (current location) to pos33 (dirleft). But pos33 has the stone. If "clear" only refers to the agent's presence, then pos33 is clear (since the agent isn't there), but the stone is there. So moving there would require that pos33 is clear (no agent), which it is. But according to the problem's description, a location can't have both the agent and a stone. Therefore, moving to pos33 (which has a stone) would not be allowed. Therefore, there's a conflict. 

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the problem expects us to ignore the contradiction and proceed. So, assuming that the initial state is correct as given, even though it's contradictory. So, the stone is at pos33, and pos33 is clear. That would mean that the stone is not actually blocking the agent from moving there. But that's impossible per the problem's description. Therefore, this must be a mistake, but I need to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the "clear" in the initial state refers to the agent's absence, and stones don't affect it. Therefore, the agent can move into a location with a stone, but that's not allowed. Therefore, the move action's precondition (ii) requires that l_to is clear (no agent or stone). Therefore, moving to pos33 is not allowed because the stone is there. Therefore, the agent cannot move into pos33. 

But the agent is at pos43, and the stone is at pos33. To push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. For example, to push the stone north from pos33 to pos23, the agent would need to be south of the stone (pos43) and move north into pos33, pushing the stone north. But for that, the agent must be able to move into pos33, which is blocked by the stone. Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, the problem is unsolvable. But that can't be the case. 

Alternatively, perhaps the allowed movements allow the agent to move into pos33 even with the stone there, but the problem's preconditions would prevent that. Let me check the move action's preconditions:

"move p l_from l_to d": preconditions are (i) agent is at l_from, (ii) l_to is clear, (iii) movement from l_from to l_to is allowed via direction d.

If l_to is pos33, and pos33 has a stone, then l_to is not clear (since a stone is there), so the move action is not allowed. Therefore, the agent cannot move into pos33. Therefore, to push the stone, the agent must be adjacent to it. But the stone is at pos33, and the agent is at pos43. pos33 is adjacent to pos43 (south to north). So the agent is at pos43, which is south of pos33. To push the stone north (to pos23), the agent would need to be at pos33 and push the stone north. But the agent cannot move into pos33 because it's occupied by the stone. Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, the problem is unsolvable. But this can't be right. There must be a way.

Wait, perhaps the stone can be pushed in other directions. Let's look at the stone's position. pos33 is surrounded by pos32 (west), pos34 (east), pos23 (north), and pos43 (south). The agent is at pos43 (south of the stone). To push the stone north to pos23, the agent would need to be at pos33, but that's blocked. Alternatively, the agent can move around to the east or west of the stone and push it.

Alternatively, the agent can move east from pos43 to pos44, then north to pos34, then west to pos33? But again, pos33 is occupied by the stone. Hmm.

Wait, the agent is at pos43. They can move to pos44 (dirdown?), no. Let's check the allowed movements:

From pos43, the allowed moves are:

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown"

Wait, pos43 to pos44 is direction dirdown? That seems odd, but perhaps the grid is such that moving down from pos43 (which is row 4, column 3) would go to pos44 (row 4, column 4). Wait, perhaps the positions are labeled as posXY where X is the row and Y is the column. So pos43 is row 4, column 3. Moving down would increase the row number? Or maybe directions are different. Let me clarify the directions:

The directions are dirdown, dirleft, dirright, dirup. The movement from pos43 to pos33 is dirleft, which would be left (column decreases by 1). So pos43 is (4,3), dirleft would be to (4,2) but that's pos42. Wait, no. Wait, the movement from pos43 to pos33 is dirleft. So from pos43 (row 4, column 3) moving left (dirleft) to pos33 (row 3, column 3)? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps the directions are different. Maybe dirleft is west, dirright is east, dirup is north, dirdown is south. So pos43 moving dirup would be to pos33 (north), dirleft to pos42 (west), dirright to pos44 (east), dirdown to pos53 (south)? Wait, but the allowed movements from pos43 are:

- "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft": So dirleft from pos43 is to pos33. That suggests that dirleft corresponds to north. Wait, perhaps the directions are not standard. This is confusing. Let's check the movement from pos43 to pos33 as dirleft. So, if pos43 is (4,3), pos33 is (3,3), which is north. So dirleft here is north. Similarly, moving from pos43 to pos42 is dirup, which would be west? This seems inconsistent. Alternatively, the directions might be labeled differently. For example, moving from pos43 to pos33 is dirleft, which could mean moving left in terms of columns. But pos43 is column 3, moving left to column 2 would be pos42. But the allowed move is from pos43 to pos33 via dirleft, which suggests that dirleft is moving up a row. This is very confusing. 

To resolve this, perhaps I should create a grid layout based on the allowed movements. Let's try to map out the connections.

Starting with pos43:

From pos43, you can move to pos33 (dirleft), pos53 (dirright), pos42 (dirup), pos44 (dirdown).

Wait, pos43 is row 4, column 3. Moving dirleft (whatever that means) to pos33 (row 3, column 3). So dirleft is north. Dirright from pos43 is to pos53 (row 5, column3?), but pos53 is row5, column3. So that's south. Wait, but pos53 is south of pos43? Then dirright is south. Dirup from pos43 is pos42 (row4, column2), which is west. Dirdown from pos43 is pos44 (row4, column4), which is east. So directions are:

- dirleft: north
- dirright: south
- dirup: west
- dirdown: east

That seems counterintuitive, but based on the allowed movements, that's how it's set up. For example, from pos43, dirleft is to pos33 (north), dirright to pos53 (south), dirup to pos42 (west), dirdown to pos44 (east). So the directions are mapped as:

- dirleft: north
- dirright: south
- dirup: west
- dirdown: east

This is a bit confusing, but it's the pattern in the given movements. So, when moving dirleft from a position, you go north; dirright is south, dirup is west, dirdown is east. 

Given that, the agent is at pos43 (row4, column3). The stone is at pos33 (row3, column3). To push the stone north (dirleft) to pos23, the agent would need to be south of the stone (pos33's south is pos43). But the agent is already at pos43. To push the stone north, the agent needs to be at pos33 and push north. But the agent can't move into pos33 because it's occupied by the stone. So how can the agent push the stone?

Ah, wait, the push actions allow the agent to push the stone from an adjacent position. For example, the pushtogoal action requires the agent to be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's current location), and then push the stone in direction d. 

The preconditions for pushtogoal are:

(i) agent p is at l_p
(ii) stone s is at l_from
(iii) l_to is clear
(iv) you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d (so l_p is adjacent to l_from in direction d)
(v) you can get from l_from to l_to following direction d (so l_to is adjacent to l_from in direction d)
(vi) l_to is a goal location.

Wait, for example, if the stone is at pos33 (l_from), and the agent is at pos43 (l_p), which is south of pos33. The direction from pos43 to pos33 is dirleft (north). Then, pushing the stone from pos33 to pos23 (north) would require that the agent is at pos43, direction d is dirleft (north). Then, l_to is pos23, which must be a goal location. But pos23 is not a goal location. The only goal location is pos22. So pushing the stone to pos23 wouldn't help. Therefore, the agent needs to push the stone west, east, or south.

Wait, the goal is to get the stone to pos22, which is a goal location. So the stone needs to move from pos33 to pos23, then to pos22. But pos23 is not a goal, so it's a stepping stone. 

But to push the stone from pos33 to pos23, the agent must be adjacent to pos33 in the opposite direction of the push. For example, to push north to pos23, the agent must be south (pos43) and move north into pos33, pushing the stone north. But according to the push action's preconditions, the agent must be at l_p (pos43), and the stone is at l_from (pos33). Then, the direction d must be from l_p to l_from, which is dirleft (north). Then, from l_from (pos33) to l_to (pos23) following direction d (dirleft/north). So the pushtogoal or pushtonongoal action would be possible if l_to is clear and the other conditions are met.

Wait, the pushtogoal action requires that l_to is a goal location. Since pos23 is not a goal, we have to use pushtonongoal. So the agent can perform "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft". This would move the stone from pos33 to pos23, with the agent moving from pos43 to pos33. But wait, after the push, the agent is at pos33, and the stone is at pos23. 

But wait, the preconditions for pushtonongoal:

(i) agent is at l_p (pos43)
(ii) stone is at l_from (pos33)
(iii) l_to (pos23) is clear
(iv) can move from l_p to l_from via d (dirleft) – yes, since the movement from pos43 to pos33 is allowed via dirleft
(v) can move from l_from to l_to via d (dirleft) – yes, pos33 to pos23 via dirleft (north)
(vi) l_to is not a goal – pos23 is not a goal, so yes.

So this action is possible if pos23 is clear. Initially, pos23 is clear. So this action can be performed. 

After performing this action, the effects are:

- agent is no longer at pos43
- stone1 is no longer at pos33
- pos23 is no longer clear (stone is there)
- agent is now at pos33
- stone1 is at pos23
- pos43 becomes clear
- stone1 is at a non-goal state (pos23 is not a goal)

So this action is valid. Then, the stone is at pos23, which satisfies the constraint that "stone1 is at location pos23" in at least one state. Also, after this action, the agent is at pos33. 

Now, the stone is at pos23. The next step is to push it to pos22. pos22 is a goal location. So we can use pushtogoal. To do that, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos23 in the direction opposite to the push. For example, to push the stone west from pos23 to pos22, the agent needs to be east of pos23 (pos24) and push west. Or south (pos33) and push north. Wait, pos23's adjacent locations are pos13 (north), pos22 (west), pos24 (east), and pos33 (south). 

The agent is currently at pos33 (south of pos23). To push the stone west to pos22, the agent needs to be east of pos23 (pos24) and push west, or north of pos23 (pos13) and push south, or west of pos23 (pos22) and push east. But pos22 is a goal location, which is where we want to push the stone. 

Alternatively, the agent is at pos33 (south of pos23) and can push the stone north to pos13? No, because pos13 is not a goal. We need to push it west to pos22. 

So the agent needs to get to the east side of pos23 (pos24) to push it west to pos22. Let's see how to do that.

From pos33, the agent can move east to pos34 (dirdown from pos33 to pos34? Because directions are mapped as dirleft=north, dirright=south, dirup=west, dirdown=east). Wait, from pos33, the allowed movements are:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown"

So dirup from pos33 is west (to pos32), dirdown is east (to pos34). 

So the agent is at pos33. To reach pos24 (east of pos23), the agent needs to move from pos33 to pos34 (east), then to pos44, then to pos44 to pos34? Wait, perhaps a better path. Alternatively, the agent can move east from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown), then north to pos24 (dirleft). Let's check if that's possible.

From pos34, allowed movements:

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft" (north)
"You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright" (south)
"You may move from location pos34 to location pos33 following direction dirup" (west)
"You may move from location pos34 to location pos35 following direction dirdown" (east)

So, from pos34, moving dirleft (north) to pos24. Yes. So the agent can move:

1. pushtonongoal to get stone1 to pos23, agent at pos33.
2. move from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown).
3. move from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft).
4. Now, agent is at pos24, which is east of pos23. From here, the agent can push the stone west to pos22 using pushtogoal.

But pos24 must be clear. After the first action, the agent is at pos33. Then, moving to pos34 requires that pos34 is clear. Initially, pos34 is clear. After the first action, pos33 is occupied by the agent, and pos23 has the stone. pos34 is still clear. So step 2: move player1 from pos33 to pos34 via dirdown (east). Then step 3: move from pos34 to pos24 via dirleft (north). Now, agent is at pos24. 

From pos24, the agent can push the stone from pos23 to pos22 (west) using pushtogoal. The preconditions:

- agent is at pos24 (l_p)
- stone is at pos23 (l_from)
- pos22 (l_to) is clear and is a goal.
- direction from l_p (pos24) to l_from (pos23) is dirup (west), since pos24 to pos23 is west. Wait, pos24 is (2,4), pos23 is (2,3). So west from pos24 to pos23 is dirup (west). 

So the action would be "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirup". 

Checking preconditions:

(i) agent at pos24 – yes.
(ii) stone at pos23 – yes.
(iii) pos22 is clear – initially, yes.
(iv) can move from pos24 to pos23 via dirup (west) – yes, as per the allowed movements: "You may move from location pos24 to location pos23 following direction dirup".
(v) can move from pos23 to pos22 via dirup (west) – yes: "You may move from location pos23 to location pos22 following direction dirup".
(vi) pos22 is a goal – yes.

So this action is valid. After performing it, the stone is at pos22, which is the goal. 

This achieves the main goal. Now, we need to check all constraints and ensure they are met during the plan.

Let's outline the steps so far:

1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft
   - Agent moves from pos43 to pos33, stone moves to pos23.
   - Now, agent is at pos33, stone at pos23.
   - This satisfies the constraint that stone1 is at pos23 in some state.

2. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
   - Agent moves from pos33 to pos34.

3. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
   - Agent moves to pos24.

4. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirup
   - Stone moves to pos22 (goal).

This plan has 4 steps. Now, check the constraints:

Constraint 1: Player1 must be at pos23 in at least one state. In the current plan, player1 is never at pos23. The first action moves the agent to pos33. So this constraint is not met. Therefore, we need to adjust the plan to include the agent being at pos23.

Similarly, other constraints need to be addressed.

Let's list all constraints again:

1. Player1 at pos23 in some state. When that happens, earlier state has player1 at pos32 or pos45 not clear.
2. pos44 not clear in some state.
3. Player1 at pos34 in some state. When that happens, in that or later state, player1 at pos44 or pos13 not clear.
4. Player1 at pos55 in some state.
5. pos24 not clear in at most one continuous sequence.
6. pos33 not clear in some state. (Initially, pos33 is clear per problem, but stone is there. But if we assume the problem is correct, then this constraint requires pos33 to be not clear, which it is after the first action when the agent moves there. Or perhaps in the initial state, pos33 is clear, but after the first action, the agent is there, making it not clear. So this constraint is satisfied after step 1.
7. stone1 at pos23 in some state (satisfied in step 1).
8. If stone1 is at pos23 in state s, then in s or later, pos51 is not clear or pos33 is not clear. After step 1, stone1 is at pos23. At that point, pos33 is occupied by the agent (not clear), so this constraint is satisfied.

Now, the missing constraints are:

- Player1 must be at pos23 (constraint 1)
- pos44 must not be clear in some state (constraint 2)
- Player1 must be at pos34 (step 2 in current plan satisfies this)
   - But then, when player1 is at pos34, in that state or later, player1 must be at pos44 or pos13 not clear. So after step 2 (player1 at pos34), in subsequent steps, we need to have player1 go to pos44 or make pos13 not clear.
- Player1 must be at pos55 (constraint 4)
- pos24 not clear can only be in one continuous sequence. In current plan, pos24 is occupied by the agent in step 3 and during step 4. So pos24 is not clear from step3 until step4. That's one continuous sequence, which is allowed.
- pos44 not clear in some state (constraint2): need to have pos44 occupied at some point.

Additionally, constraint 1 requires that when player1 is at pos23, there's an earlier state where player1 was at pos32 or pos45 is not clear. So to meet this, we need to have player1 reach pos23, and before that, either visit pos32 or have pos45 not clear.

So, let's adjust the plan to include these constraints.

First, let's make the agent go to pos23. How?

After step1, agent is at pos33. To get to pos23, they can move north from pos33 to pos23 via dirleft. But pos23 has the stone. Wait, after step1, the stone is at pos23, so pos23 is not clear. Therefore, the agent cannot move there. So they can't move to pos23 directly. Therefore, the agent must reach pos23 before pushing the stone there. But how?

Alternatively, the agent can reach pos23 before moving the stone. Wait, but the stone starts at pos33. Let's think:

Original plan:

1. pushtonongoal to move stone to pos23, agent at pos33.

But if the agent needs to be at pos23, they can't be there after the stone is pushed. So perhaps they need to be at pos23 before pushing the stone. But the stone is at pos33 initially. To push the stone to pos23, the agent must be south (pos43) and push north. But then the agent can't be at pos23 during that action.

Wait, maybe the agent can move to pos23 after pushing the stone there. But after pushing, the stone is at pos23, so pos23 is occupied. The agent can't move there. Therefore, the agent can't be at pos23 after the stone is there. So how to satisfy the constraint that the agent must be at pos23? 

Ah, perhaps the agent can move to pos23 before pushing the stone. But the stone is at pos33. The agent is initially at pos43. To get to pos23, the agent would need to move north to pos33 (but it's occupied by the stone). So that's not possible. Alternatively, take a different path.

Alternative approach:

Agent starts at pos43. Can move east to pos44 (dirdown), then north to pos34 (dirleft), then west to pos33 (dirup), but pos33 is occupied by the stone. Alternatively, move west to pos42 (dirup), then north to pos32 (dirleft), then west to pos22 (dirup), but that's a long path. 

Wait, let's think of a path that gets the agent to pos23 without going through pos33. For example:

From pos43, move west to pos42 (dirup), then north to pos32 (dirleft), then west to pos22 (dirup), then north to pos23 (dirleft). But pos23 is initially clear. So:

1. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
2. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
3. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup
4. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirleft

Now, agent is at pos23. This satisfies constraint1. Also, before that, the agent was at pos32 (step2), which satisfies the requirement that if agent is at pos23, there's an earlier state where agent was at pos32. 

Then, after being at pos23, the agent needs to push the stone from pos33 to pos23. But the stone is at pos33. Wait, the agent is at pos23. To push the stone from pos33 to pos23, the agent needs to be south of pos33 (pos43) and push north. But the agent is at pos23. Therefore, this approach won't work. 

Alternatively, after reaching pos23, the agent can push the stone from pos33 to pos23. But the stone is at pos33, and the agent is at pos23. To push the stone south to pos43, the agent would need to be north of the stone. But the stone is at pos33, so north would be pos23. But the agent is already there. So the agent can push the stone south to pos43. But pos43 is clear initially (since the agent moved away in step1). 

But pushing the stone south to pos43 would require the agent to be at pos23 (north of pos33) and push south. Let's see:

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright (south). 

Preconditions:

(i) agent at pos23 – yes.
(ii) stone at pos33 – yes.
(iii) pos43 clear – yes, after agent moved away in step1.
(iv) can move from pos23 to pos33 via dirright (south) – allowed? Looking at movement list:

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos33 following direction dirright" (south). Yes.
(v) can move from pos33 to pos43 via dirright (south) – yes.
(vi) pos43 is not a goal – correct.

So this action is possible. Then, after pushing, the stone is at pos43, and the agent is at pos33.

But this seems to move the stone away from the goal. However, this allows the agent to be at pos23, satisfying constraint1. But then the stone is at pos43, which is further from the goal. This may complicate the plan, but let's see.

So, steps:

1. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
2. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
3. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup
4. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirleft
   - Now, agent is at pos23, satisfying constraint1. The earlier state at pos32 (step2) satisfies the requirement for constraint1.
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright
   - Stone moves to pos43, agent to pos33.

Now, the stone is at pos43. Then, the agent needs to push it back towards the goal. This seems inefficient, but necessary to satisfy the constraints.

Next, the agent is at pos33. To push the stone from pos43 to pos33 north to pos23 again? No, because pos43 is south of pos33. Wait, the stone is now at pos43. To push it north to pos33, the agent must be south of pos43 (pos53) and push north. But the agent is at pos33. So this isn't possible. 

Alternatively, the agent can move from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown), then to pos44, etc., to get to the south of pos43. This is getting complicated. 

Alternatively, perhaps after step5, the stone is at pos43. Then, the agent can move to pos43 (south of pos33) and push the stone north to pos33 again. But the agent is at pos33. To push the stone from pos43 to pos33, the agent would need to be at pos53 (south of pos43) and push north. But the agent is at pos33, which is north of pos43. So the agent can't push the stone north from pos43 unless they are south of it. 

This approach is leading to a longer plan and possibly not optimal. 

Perhaps there's a better way to satisfy the constraints without deviating too much. 

Let's try to adjust the original plan to include the necessary constraints.

Original plan (4 steps) doesn't satisfy several constraints. Let's see which ones:

- Constraint1: player1 at pos23. Not met.
- Constraint2: pos44 not clear. Not met.
- Constraint3: player1 at pos34 (step2). But after that, need to have player1 at pos44 or pos13 not clear. In current plan, after step2, player1 moves to pos24 and then to pos24. So pos44 is not visited. Therefore, need to have pos13 not clear. But pos13 is initially clear. How to make it not clear? By having the agent or a stone there. But the stone is at pos23 after step1. So pos13 remains clear. Therefore, this constraint is not met unless the agent goes to pos44 later.
- Constraint4: player1 at pos55. Not met.
- Constraint2: pos44 not clear. Not met.
- Constraint4: player1 must reach pos55.

So, to satisfy all constraints, the plan needs to include:

- A visit to pos23 by the agent.
- A visit to pos55 by the agent.
- pos44 must be occupied at some point.
- After being at pos34, the agent must go to pos44 or have pos13 not clear.

Let's try to integrate these into the plan.

Here's a possible approach:

1. Move agent to pos44 to satisfy pos44 not clear.
2. Move agent to pos55.
3. Ensure agent visits pos23 with prior pos32 visit.
4. Push stone to pos22.

But integrating all these steps optimally is challenging. Let's try to construct a path.

Initial position: agent at pos43, stone at pos33.

Step 1: move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown (east to pos44)
   - Now, pos44 is not clear (agent there), satisfying constraint2.
   - Agent is at pos44.

Step 2: move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown (east to pos45)
   - Agent at pos45.

Step 3: move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright (south to pos55)
   - Check if allowed: movement from pos45 to pos55 via dirright (south). Yes, according to the allowed movements: "You may move from location pos45 to location pos55 following direction dirright".
   - Agent at pos55, satisfying constraint4.

Step4: move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft (north to pos45)
   - Agent at pos45.

Step5: move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup (west to pos44)
   - Agent at pos44.

Step6: move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft (north to pos34)
   - Agent at pos34, satisfying constraint3.

Now, after step6, agent is at pos34. According to constraint3, after this, the agent must be at pos44 or pos13 not clear. Since the agent is at pos34, they can move back to pos44 later, satisfying that.

Step7: move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft (north to pos24)
   - Agent at pos24.

Step8: move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup (west to pos23)
   - Agent at pos23, satisfying constraint1. But need to check if prior state has agent at pos32 or pos45 not clear. In this case, agent was at pos24 before pos23. pos45 was not clear during steps2-5. So after step5, pos45 is clear again (agent left to pos44 in step5). Therefore, during step8, the earlier state where pos45 was not clear was steps2-4. So when agent is at pos23 (step8), there's an earlier state (steps2-4) where pos45 was not clear. This satisfies constraint1.

Step9: Now, need to push the stone from pos33 to pos23. Wait, the stone is still at pos33. The agent is at pos23. So the agent can push the stone south to pos43.

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright (south)
   - Preconditions: 
      - agent at pos23 (yes)
      - stone at pos33 (yes)
      - pos43 is clear (yes, since agent was at pos23)
      - can move from pos23 to pos33 via dirright (south): yes.
      - can move from pos33 to pos43 via dirright (south): yes.
      - pos43 is not a goal: correct.

After this, stone is at pos43, agent at pos33.

Step10: move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright (south)
   - Now agent at pos43.

Step11: push the stone from pos43 to pos33 north again. But this seems counterproductive.

Alternatively, after step9, the stone is at pos43. The agent is at pos33. Then, the agent can move to pos43 and push the stone further south to pos53, but that's moving away from the goal.

Alternatively, after step9, the stone is at pos43. The agent is at pos33. Then, the agent can move east to pos34, north to pos24, and then push the stone west from pos43 to pos33, but this isn't helpful.

This approach is leading to a long plan and may not be optimal. Perhaps there's a better way.

Alternative approach:

After step6 (agent at pos34), to satisfy constraint3 (after being at pos34, agent must be at pos44 or pos13 not clear), the agent can move to pos44 (satisfying pos44).

Step7: move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright (south to pos44)
   - Agent at pos44, satisfying the constraint3's requirement.

Now, proceed to push the stone.

But the stone is still at pos33. How to get it to pos22.

Agent is at pos44. Need to get to a position to push the stone.

From pos44, agent can move west to pos43 (dirup), then north to pos33 (dirleft), but pos33 has the stone. So can't move there. 

Alternatively, move north to pos34, then west to pos33. 

This is getting too tangled. Let's consider integrating the stone pushing into the constraint-fulfilling steps.

Perhaps the optimal plan is as follows, incorporating the necessary constraints:

1. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown (east to pos44) → satisfies constraint2 (pos44 not clear).
2. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown (east to pos45).
3. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright (south to pos55) → satisfies constraint4.
4. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft (north to pos45).
5. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup (west to pos44).
6. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft (north to pos34) → satisfies constraint3.
7. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft (north to pos24).
8. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup (west to pos23) → satisfies constraint1. Earlier state has pos45 not clear (steps2-5).
9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright (south) → stone to pos43.
10. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright (south) → agent at pos33, stone at pos43.
11. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown (east to pos34).
12. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright (south to pos44).
13. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup (west to pos43).
14. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft (north) → stone to pos23.
15. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft (north to pos33).
16. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown (east to pos34).
17. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft (north to pos24).
18. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirup (west) → stone to pos22.

This plan is very long and likely not optimal. Also, steps9-18 involve moving the stone back and forth, which isn't efficient. 

Clearly, this approach isn't working. I need to find a way to satisfy all constraints without unnecessary steps.

Alternative idea: Incorporate the necessary constraint-fulfilling steps into the main plan.

For example:

- To satisfy pos44 not clear: have the agent move through pos44.
- To satisfy player1 at pos55: have a detour to pos55.
- To satisfy player1 at pos23: make a detour to pos23.
- Ensure the stone is pushed to pos22.

Let's try:

1. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown (pos44 not clear, constraint2)
2. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown (east)
3. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright (south to pos55, constraint4)
4. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft (north)
5. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup (west)
6. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft (north to pos34, constraint3)
7. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup (west to pos33)
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos23 dirleft → wait, can't push from pos33 to pos23. The agent needs to be adjacent. 

Wait, agent at pos33, stone at pos33. That's not possible. Mistake.

After step6, agent is at pos34. Then move to pos33 (west), which is where the stone is. But the stone is at pos33, so agent can't move there. So this is invalid.

Alternative path from pos34:

6. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft (north to pos24)
7. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup (west to pos23, constraint1). Prior state pos24, but need earlier state where agent was at pos32 or pos45 not clear. pos45 was not clear during steps2-5. So this satisfies constraint1.
8. Now, agent at pos23. Need to push stone from pos33 to pos23. But agent is at pos23. To push, agent must be south of pos33 (pos43). So need to move back.

9. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown (east)
10. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright (south)
11. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright (south)
12. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup (west)
13. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft (north)
   - Stone moves to pos23, agent to pos33.
14. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown (east)
15. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft (north)
16. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirup (west)
   - Stone to pos22.

This plan includes:

- pos44 not clear (step1)
- agent at pos55 (step3)
- agent at pos23 (step7), with pos45 not clear earlier (steps2-5)
- agent at pos34 (step6), and later moves to pos44 (step11), satisfying constraint3
- pos24 not clear only in steps6-9 and step15-16. But need to check if it's continuous.

This is still a long plan, but perhaps it's necessary to meet all constraints. However, the problem requires an optimal plan with minimal steps. This approach may not be optimal.

Alternative plan focusing on shortest path while meeting constraints:

1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft → stone at pos23, agent at pos33. This satisfies constraint7 (stone at pos23) and constraint8 (pos33 not clear after this action).
   - Also, pos33 is not clear (agent there), satisfying constraint6.

2. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown (east to pos34). Now at pos34, satisfying constraint3.

3. From pos34, need to ensure that either player1 goes to pos44 or pos13 not clear. Let's go to pos44.

   move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright (south to pos44). Now pos44 not clear (agent there), satisfying constraint2.

4. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown (east to pos45).

5. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright (south to pos55), satisfying constraint4.

6. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft (north).

7. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup (west).

8. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft (north).

9. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft (north to pos24).

10. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirup → stone to pos22.

Now, check constraints:

- Constraint1: player1 at pos23. Not met. So we need to insert a step where player1 goes to pos23.

But in this plan, the agent never goes to pos23. So need to adjust.

Insert after step2:

2. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown (pos34).

3. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft (north to pos24).

4. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup (west to pos23) → satisfies constraint1. Earlier state pos24. But need prior state where agent was at pos32 or pos45 not clear. pos45 was not clear during steps5-7. So when agent is at pos23 (step4), there's an earlier state (step5-7) where pos45 was not clear. So this satisfies constraint1.

Then proceed:

5. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown (east).

6. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright (south).

7. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright (south) → pos44 not clear (constraint2).

8. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown (east).

9. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright (south) → constraint4.

10. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft (north).

11. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup (west).

12. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft (north).

13. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft (north).

14. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirup → stone to pos22.

Now, this plan has 14 steps, which is not optimal. But it's challenging to find a shorter path that meets all constraints.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can reach pos23 after pushing the stone there. But after pushing, pos23 has the stone, so agent can't move there. Therefore, the agent must reach pos23 before pushing the stone there. But the stone starts at pos33. 

Another approach:

1. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown (east to pos44) → pos44 not clear (constraint2).

2. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown (east to pos45).

3. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright (south to pos55) → constraint4.

4. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft (north).

5. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup (west).

6. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft (north to pos34) → constraint3.

7. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup (west to pos33) → but stone is there. Cannot.

So this is invalid.

Alternative path from pos34:

6. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft (north to pos24).

7. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup (west to pos23) → constraint1. Prior states have pos45 not clear (steps2-4), which satisfies the requirement.

8. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown (east).

9. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright (south).

10. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright (south).

11. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup (west).

12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft → stone to pos23, agent to pos33.

13. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown (east).

14. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft (north).

15. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirup → stone to pos22.

This plan has 15 steps, still not optimal.

It's clear that meeting all constraints requires additional steps. Given the problem's complexity, the optimal plan would likely have around 10 steps. But due to time constraints, I'll proceed to draft a plan that meets all constraints, even if it's longer than desired.
