Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. First, I need to understand the initial state, the goal, and the constraints. The main goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. The only goal location mentioned is pos55. So, stone1 is initially at pos33, and we need to move it to pos55.

Now, let's look at the constraints. There are several constraints here that the plan must satisfy. Let me list them out:

1. At least one state must have player1 at pos55 or pos11 not clear.
2. At least one state must have stone1 at pos31 or pos12 not clear.
3. Player1 can never be at pos34.
4. At least one state must have pos44 not clear or player1 at pos12.
5. At least one state must have player1 at pos25.
6. If player1 is ever at pos25, then either pos52 is not clear or player1 is at pos44 in that state or later.
7. At least one state must have player1 at pos13 or pos41 not clear.
8. Player1 can never be at pos32.

Alright, so the plan has to not only move the stone to pos55 but also satisfy all these constraints. Let's think about how each constraint can be met.

Starting with the main goal: moving stone1 from pos33 to pos55. The agent can push stones either to goal or non-goal locations. Since pos55 is a goal, the final action must be a pushtogoal to pos55.

Looking at the movement paths, pos33 to pos43 (right), then pos43 to pos53 (right), then pos53 to pos54 (down?), and then pos54 to pos55 (right). Wait, maybe the directions are a bit tricky. Let me check the allowed movements.

From pos33, moving right would go to pos43. Then pos43 to pos53 (right). Then pos53 to pos54 (down). Then pos54 to pos55 (down again). But wait, according to the movement definitions, for example, pos53 can move down to pos54, and pos54 can move down to pos55. So pushing stone1 from pos53 to pos54 (down), then from pos54 to pos55 (down) using pushtogoal.

But first, the agent needs to get to the correct positions to push the stone. The initial position of the agent is pos21. So the agent needs to move from pos21 to pos33 to push the stone. But how?

Let's map a possible path. From pos21, the agent can move right to pos31, then down to pos32, but wait, constraint 8 says player1 can never be at pos32. So that's not allowed. So alternative routes. Let's see:

From pos21, possible moves are to pos11 (left), pos31 (right), or pos22 (down). Since pos31 is allowed (not a forbidden location), maybe the agent can go to pos31, then pos31 can go to pos41 (right) or pos32 (down). But pos32 is forbidden. So from pos31, right to pos41. Then pos41 can go to pos51 (right) or down to pos42. But maybe that's a longer path. Alternatively, pos21 to pos22 (down), then pos22 to pos23 (down), then pos23 to pos33 (right). Wait, pos23 to pos33 is allowed via direction right. So that could be a path: pos21 → pos22 → pos23 → pos33. Let's check the movement preconditions.

From pos21 to pos22: direction down. That's allowed. Then pos22 to pos23: direction down. Then pos23 to pos33: direction right. So that's possible. But once at pos23, pushing the stone at pos33 to the right (to pos43) would require the agent to be at pos33's left (which is pos23) and direction right. So that's possible. Wait, the pushtogoal action requires the agent to be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's current position) in direction d. So to push the stone from pos33 to pos43 (right direction), the agent needs to be at pos23 (since pos33's left is pos23), and move right to pos33, then pushing the stone to pos43. Wait, no. The direction is from the agent's position to the stone's position. So for the agent to push the stone right, the agent must be to the left of the stone, and push it right. So if the stone is at pos33, the agent needs to be at pos23 (left of pos33), then push it right to pos43. So the action would be "pushtonongoal" (since pos43 is not a goal) or "pushtogoal" if pos43 is a goal. But pos43 is not a goal; only pos55 is. So first, pushing from pos33 to pos43 (non-goal), then from pos43 to pos53 (non-goal), then from pos53 to pos54 (non-goal), then from pos54 to pos55 (goal). Each push requires the agent to be in the correct position.

But the agent starts at pos21. Let's plan the path:

1. Move from pos21 to pos22 (down). Possible.
2. Move from pos22 to pos23 (down). Then from pos23 to pos33 (right) but wait, moving to pos33 would require that pos33 is clear. But initially, pos33 has the stone. So the agent can't move into pos33. Therefore, the agent can't move into the stone's position. So instead, the agent needs to reach a position adjacent to the stone to push it.

So initial stone is at pos33. To push it right to pos43, the agent must be at pos23 (left of pos33) and direction right. So the agent needs to get to pos23. How?

From pos21, move down to pos22 (action move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown). Then move down again to pos23 (move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown). Now at pos23. Now, can push the stone from pos33 to pos43 (right direction). But pos43 must be clear. Initially, pos43 is clear. So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright. After this, the stone is at pos43, and the agent is at pos33.

But wait, after pushing, the agent moves to pos33 (from pos23). Then, to push the stone again from pos43 to pos53 (right), the agent needs to be at pos43's left (pos33), and direction right. So the agent is already at pos33. So next action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirright. Now, stone is at pos53, agent at pos43. Then, to push down to pos54: the stone is at pos53, to push it down to pos54, the agent needs to be at pos53's up direction, which is pos43. So from pos43, direction dirdown. So action pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos53 pos54 dirdown. Now stone is at pos54, agent at pos53. Then, push down again to pos55 (goal). So pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown. Now, stone is at pos55 (goal), which satisfies the main goal.

But wait, does pos54 to pos55 require moving down? Let's check the allowed movements. Looking at the movement from pos54 to pos55: according to the given movements, "You may move from location pos54 to location pos55 following direction dirdown". So yes, direction dirdown from pos54 to pos55. So pushing the stone from pos54 to pos55 with direction dirdown would work.

Now, let's check the constraints:

1. At least one state has player1 at pos55 or pos11 not clear. In this plan, after the final push, the agent is at pos55 (since pushing from pos54 to pos55 would place the agent at pos54's position, which is pos54. Wait, no. Let's recheck the effect of pushtogoal. The action "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d" has the effect that the agent moves from l_p (pos53) to l_from (pos54), then the stone moves to l_to (pos55). Wait, the parameters for pushtogoal are (p, s, l_p, l_from, l_to, d). So l_p is the agent's current position (before the push), l_from is the stone's current position, l_to is where the stone is pushed to, and d is the direction.

Wait, the preconditions for pushtogoal are:

- agent p is at l_p
- stone s is at l_from
- l_to is clear
- can move from l_p to l_from (direction d)
- can move from l_from to l_to (direction d)
- l_to is a goal.

So in the final push, the agent is at pos54 (since after the previous push, the agent is at pos53. Wait, the previous step was pushing from pos53 to pos54. So after that, the agent is at pos53 (l_p is pos43, l_from is pos53, l_to is pos54. Wait, no. Let's correct this.

Wait, let's step through each push action.

First push: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright.

Here, the agent is at pos23 (l_p=pos23), stone is at pos33 (l_from=pos33). The direction is dirright, meaning the agent moves from pos23 to pos33 (direction right), then the stone is pushed from pos33 to pos43 (direction right). After this action, the agent is now at pos33 (from the effect: agent p is at l_from). So after first push, agent is at pos33, stone at pos43.

Second push: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirright.

Agent is at pos33 (l_p=pos33), stone at pos43. Direction right, so agent moves to pos43, stone moves to pos53. Now agent is at pos43.

Third push: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos53 pos54 dirdown.

Agent at pos43 (l_p=pos43), stone at pos53. Direction down. So agent moves to pos53 (from pos43 to pos53 via direction down?), wait, the allowed movements. Let me check if moving from pos43 to pos53 is allowed. Looking at the movement definitions: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown". Wait, no. Wait, for pos43:

- "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"
- "You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup"
- "You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown"

So to move from pos43 to pos53, direction is dirright. So pushing the stone from pos53 to pos54 requires the agent to be at pos53's up direction (since pushing down). Wait, no. The direction d for the push is the direction from the agent's position to the stone's position. So to push the stone down (from pos53 to pos54), the agent must be at pos53's up position, which is pos43. So the agent is at pos43, direction dirdown to reach pos53 (stone's position), then push down to pos54. So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos53 pos54 dirdown.

After this, the agent moves to pos53 (from pos43 via dirdown?), but according to the movement definitions, from pos43, moving dirdown leads to pos44. Wait, no. Wait, the movement from pos43 to pos44 is direction dirdown. So the agent is at pos43, stone is at pos53. To push the stone from pos53 to pos54 (down), the agent needs to be adjacent to pos53 in the direction leading to the push. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the directions here.

Let me clarify: The direction in the push action is the direction from the agent's current position to the stone's position (l_from), and then the same direction continues to push the stone to l_to. So for example, if the agent is at pos43, and the stone is at pos53, the direction would be dirright (since pos43 to pos53 is right). But pos53 to pos54 is down. Wait, that's conflicting. So perhaps the direction for pushing must be the same for both the agent moving to the stone and the stone moving to the target. So the direction must be the same for both steps.

Wait, the preconditions for pushtogoal are:

(iv) you can get from location l_p to l_from following direction d.

(v) you can get from l_from to l_to following direction d.

So the direction d must be the same for both movements. So for the agent to push the stone from pos53 to pos54 down, the agent must be at a position l_p such that moving direction d (dirdown) from l_p reaches pos53. But pos53's up is pos43. So moving down from pos43 would go to pos44, not pos53. So that's not possible. Therefore, the direction must be such that from l_p to l_from is direction d, and from l_from to l_to is also direction d.

So for the stone at pos53, to push it down to pos54, the agent must be at pos53's up position (pos43), and direction dirdown. But moving from pos43 to pos53 is direction dirright, not dirdown. Therefore, this is not possible. So perhaps the stone can't be pushed down from pos53 to pos54 in a single push action. Instead, maybe the agent needs to be at pos53's left (pos43) and push right to pos53, then right again to pos54? Wait, pos53's right is pos54? No, pos53's right would be pos54 if the grid is 5x5. Wait, the positions are labeled pos11 to pos55, where the first digit is the row and the second is the column. So pos53 is row 5, column 3? Wait, no, wait the locations are pos11 (row 1, column 1), pos12 (row1, column2), pos13 (row1, column3), etc. So pos53 is row5, column3? Wait, maybe not. Wait, the problem statement says it's a 2D grid. Let me check the movement directions again. For example, from pos43, moving right goes to pos53. So pos43 is row4, column3, moving right (dirright) would be to pos44? Wait, no. Wait, the movement from pos43 to pos53 is via dirright. So that suggests that moving right from pos43 (which is row4, column3) would go to pos44 (row4, column4)? Or perhaps the grid is laid out with rows as the first digit and columns as the second, so pos43 is row4, column3. Moving right would increase the column, so from pos43, right is pos44. But according to the movement definitions, "You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright". Wait, that's confusing. So pos43 to pos53 is direction right. That suggests that the columns are the second digit, so pos43 is row4, column3, and moving right (dirright) would take you to column4 (pos44), but according to the problem's movement definitions, pos43 can move right to pos53. That's conflicting. Wait, perhaps the movement directions are not based on row and column but as per the given connections. Let's check the given movements.

Looking at pos43's movements:

- "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"
- "You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup"
- "You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown"

So pos43 can go right to pos53, which is row5, column3 (assuming pos53 is row5, column3). So dirright from pos43 leads to pos53, which is in the same column but next row? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the grid is structured such that moving right increases the column, and moving down increases the row. So pos11 is top-left, pos15 is top-right, pos51 is bottom-left, pos55 is bottom-right. So moving right from pos43 (row4, column3) would go to pos44 (row4, column4). But according to the problem's movement definitions, moving right from pos43 takes you to pos53. That's inconsistent. This suggests that the movement directions might be different. For example, maybe dirright means moving east, which could be increasing the column, but the positions are arranged such that pos43's right is pos44. But according to the problem's movement definitions, pos43 can move right to pos53. So perhaps the grid is structured with rows as the first digit and columns as the second, and moving right increases the row? That seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the movement directions are defined differently. For example, dirright could be east (column increase), dirdown is south (row increase), dirup is north (row decrease), dirleft is west (column decrease).

Given that pos43 can move right to pos53, that would mean that moving right from pos43 increases the row by 1 (from 4 to 5), keeping the column the same. But that would mean dirright is south, which conflicts with the name. Alternatively, perhaps the grid is transposed. This is confusing. Let's take another example: pos11 can move right to pos21. So from pos11 (row1, column1), moving right (dirright) takes you to pos21. That would suggest that dirright increases the row, which is typically down in a grid. So dirright is actually moving down a row. Similarly, dirdown would increase the column. This is a bit counterintuitive, but based on the given movement connections, that's how it seems.

Wait, let's check the first movement:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"

So pos11 to pos21 is dirright. pos11 to pos12 is dirdown.

So pos11 (row1, column1) moving dirright goes to pos21 (row2, column1), which is down. So dirright is moving down a row. Similarly, dirdown from pos11 goes to pos12 (row1, column2), which is right in terms of columns. So directions are:

- dirright: down (row increases)
- dirleft: up (row decreases)
- dirup: left (column decreases)
- dirdown: right (column increases)

This is a bit unconventional, but based on the given connections, that's how it works. So directions are as follows:

- dirright: row increases by 1 (south)
- dirleft: row decreases by 1 (north)
- dirup: column decreases by 1 (west)
- dirdown: column increases by 1 (east)

Wait, no. For example, pos11 to pos21 is dirright, which is row increases (south). pos11 to pos12 is dirdown, column increases (east). So:

- dirright: south (row+1)
- dirleft: north (row-1)
- dirup: west (column-1)
- dirdown: east (column+1)

This is the mapping. So when moving dirright from pos43 (row4, column3), you go to pos53 (row5, column3). Moving dirdown from pos43 would go to pos44 (row4, column4). Moving dirleft from pos43 would go to pos33 (row3, column3). Dirup from pos43 would go to pos42 (row4, column2).

Given this, the directions are a bit counterintuitive but follow the given connections. So to push the stone from pos53 (row5, column3) to pos54 (row5, column4), the agent needs to be at pos53's west (dirup direction?), wait no. Let's think: to push the stone east (dirdown direction, since dirdown increases column), the agent must be west of the stone. So agent at pos53's west, which is pos52? Wait, no. Let's see: pos53 (row5, column3). To push it east (dirdown direction, which increases column), the agent needs to be at pos53's west (column2), which is pos52. But can the agent get there?

Alternatively, perhaps the direction for pushing is such that the agent is in the direction opposite to where the stone is moving. For example, to push the stone east (dirdown), the agent must be west of the stone (dirup direction). So agent at pos53's west (pos52) and pushes east. But pos53's west would be pos52's east? Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to model this properly.

Given the movement directions:

- To move from pos A to pos B via direction D, the agent must have a defined movement path.

For pushing a stone from l_from to l_to in direction D, the agent must be at a position l_p such that there's a movement from l_p to l_from via D, and from l_from to l_to via D.

So, for example, to push the stone from pos53 to pos54 (dirdown direction), the agent must be at a position l_p where moving D (dirdown) from l_p leads to l_from (pos53). Since D is dirdown (east), then l_p must be west of pos53. So pos53's west is pos52 (since moving dirup from pos53 would decrease the column by 1, which is west). Wait, no: pos53 is row5, column3. Dirup direction decreases the column by 1 (west), so pos53's dirup is pos52 (row5, column2). Dirdown from pos53 is pos54 (row5, column4). So to push the stone from pos53 to pos54 (dirdown), the agent must be at pos52 (west of pos53), and direction dirup? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, the precondition (iv) for pushtogoal is that you can move from l_p to l_from following direction D. So if the agent is at pos52, and direction is dirdown, can they move to pos53? Let's check the movement definitions.

Looking for movement from pos52 to pos53: "You may move from location pos52 to location pos53 following direction dirdown". Yes, because dirdown increases the column (east), so pos52 (row5, column2) moving dirdown (east) to pos53 (row5, column3). So if the agent is at pos52, direction dirdown would move to pos53, which is the stone's current position. Then, the stone would be pushed to pos54 (dirdown from pos53 to pos54). So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos53 pos54 dirdown.

But how does the agent get to pos52? Let's see. The agent is at pos43 after pushing the stone to pos53. From pos43, the possible moves are:

- dirleft to pos33
- dirright to pos53
- dirup to pos42
- dirdown to pos44

But pos43 to pos53 is dirright. So after the second push, the agent is at pos43. To get to pos52, the agent would need to move from pos43 to pos42 (dirup), then pos42 to pos52 (dirright). But pos42 to pos52 is allowed via dirright (row increases by 1): pos42 is row4, column2. dirright would take to row5, column2 (pos52). Wait, pos42's dirright is pos52? Let's check the movement definitions for pos42:

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos42 to location pos52 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos42 to location pos41 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown".

Yes, pos42 can move dirright to pos52. So from pos43, agent can move dirup to pos42, then dirright to pos52. Then, from pos52, push the stone from pos53 to pos54 with dirdown. Then, from pos54, push to pos55 (dirdown again). But pos54 to pos55 is dirdown (east), so the agent must be at pos53 (west of pos54) to push it east. Wait, no. To push from pos54 to pos55 (dirdown, which is east), the agent must be at pos54's west (pos53) and direction dirdown (east). So agent at pos53, pushing to pos54, then pos54 to pos55.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Let's try to outline the steps again:

Initial positions:

- Agent: pos21
- Stone: pos33
- Goal: pos55

Constraints:

- Agent must visit pos25 at least once.
- Agent must never be at pos34 or pos32.
- Other constraints need to be checked.

Let me try to find a path that satisfies all constraints.

First, the agent needs to reach the stone at pos33 to push it. To avoid forbidden locations (pos34 and pos32), the agent's path must not go through those.

Possible path from pos21 to pos23:

pos21 → pos22 (down) → pos23 (down). Then, push stone from pos33 to pos43 (dirright). Agent moves to pos33.

Then, push stone from pos43 to pos53 (dirright). Agent moves to pos43.

Then, agent needs to get to pos53's west (pos52?) to push east to pos54. But how?

Alternatively, after pushing to pos53, the agent is at pos43. Then, move to pos44 (dirdown), then to pos54 (dirright), but pos54 is a goal location? No, pos54 is not a goal. Only pos55 is.

Wait, maybe the agent can move from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown), then to pos54 (dirright), but pos43 to pos44 is dirdown (column increases by 1, so pos44 is row4, column4). Then dirright from pos44 would be pos54 (row5, column4). From pos54, push the stone from pos53 to pos54? No, the stone is at pos53. This approach isn't working.

Alternative plan:

Push stone from pos33 to pos43 (dirright), agent at pos33.

Then push from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown?), but pos44 is not a goal. Wait, the stone needs to reach pos55. Maybe another path.

Another approach: push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown). But pos34 is a non-goal. Then push from pos34 to pos44 (dirdown), then pos44 to pos54 (dirdown), then pos54 to pos55 (dirdown). But pushing from pos34 to pos44 requires the agent to be at pos34's up direction (pos24), but pos34 is forbidden (constraint 3: agent can't be at pos34). So that's not possible.

Alternatively, after pushing stone to pos43, agent is at pos33. Then move to pos34? But pos34 is forbidden. So can't do that.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Let's think again.

The main issue is pushing the stone from pos53 to pos54 and then to pos55. The agent needs to be positioned correctly for each push.

After pushing the stone to pos53 (agent at pos43), the next step is to get to pos52 to push the stone east to pos54. So from pos43:

1. Move dirup to pos42.
2. Move dirright to pos52.
3. Now at pos52, push stone from pos53 to pos54 (dirdown).
   - Preconditions: agent at pos52, stone at pos53. Direction dirdown (east).
   - Check if movement from pos52 to pos53 is allowed: yes, pos52 can move dirdown to pos53.
   - Then stone moves to pos54 (dirdown from pos53 is pos54).
   - This action is pushtonongoal because pos54 is not a goal.
   - After this, agent is at pos53, stone at pos54.
4. Then, push from pos54 to pos55 (dirdown). Agent must be at pos54's west (pos53), direction dirdown (east).
   - So agent at pos53, push stone from pos54 to pos55 (dirdown).
   - Check if pos53 to pos54 is allowed via dirdown: pos53's dirdown is pos54.
   - Then, pos54's dirdown is pos55.
   - So action pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown.

This would work. So the steps are:

1. Move from pos21 → pos22 → pos23.
2. Push stone from pos33 → pos43 (agent at pos23, direction dirright).
3. Agent moves to pos33.
4. Push stone from pos43 → pos53 (agent at pos33, direction dirright).
5. Agent moves to pos43.
6. Move from pos43 → pos42 (dirup).
7. Move from pos42 → pos52 (dirright).
8. Push stone from pos53 → pos54 (agent at pos52, direction dirdown).
9. Agent moves to pos53.
10. Push stone from pos54 → pos55 (agent at pos53, direction dirdown).
    - But wait, agent is at pos53, stone is at pos54. To push to pos55, the agent must be able to move from pos53 to pos54 via direction dirdown (east). From pos53, dirdown is column+1, so pos53 (row5, column3) → pos54 (row5, column4). So yes, direction dirdown. Then, the stone moves from pos54 to pos55 (same direction).

But step 10 requires the agent to be at pos53, stone at pos54. To push, the agent must be at pos53, and stone at pos54. Wait, no. The stone is at pos54, and the agent needs to be west of it (pos53) to push east (dirdown). So the action would be pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown. This is allowed because pos55 is a goal.

Now, let's check the constraints:

Constraint 5: Agent must be at pos25 in at least one state. Our current plan doesn't include pos25. So we need to insert a move to pos25 somewhere.

Similarly, other constraints need to be checked.

So, how to integrate the constraints into the plan.

Let's list all constraints again:

1. At least one state where player1 is at pos55 OR pos11 is not clear.
   - In the final step, after pushing to pos55, the agent is at pos54. So not at pos55. So this constraint is not met. So we need to have the agent visit pos55 at some point, or make pos11 not clear.

2. At least one state where stone1 is at pos31 OR pos12 is not clear.
   - Stone1 starts at pos33, moves to pos43, 53, 54, 55. Never at pos31. So need to make pos12 not clear. How? By moving the agent to pos12 and pushing a stone there. But there's only one stone. So unless the stone is moved to pos12, but that's not part of the current plan. So this constraint requires that either stone1 is at pos31 (which isn't happening) or pos12 is not clear. So we need to make pos12 occupied by the agent or a stone at some point. But the stone is being moved to pos55. So the agent must visit pos12, making it not clear. So perhaps the agent can move to pos12 during the plan.

3. Player1 must never be at pos34. Our current plan doesn't go there, so that's fine.

4. At least one state where pos44 is not clear OR player1 is at pos12. If the agent visits pos12 (to satisfy constraint 2), then this constraint is also satisfied.

5. Agent must be at pos25 at least once. So need to include a move to pos25.

6. If agent is at pos25, then in that state or later, pos52 must not be clear or agent is at pos44. So when we visit pos25, we need to ensure that after that, either pos52 is occupied (by agent or stone) or agent is at pos44.

7. At least one state where player1 is at pos13 OR pos41 is not clear. So agent can visit pos13, or make pos41 not clear (by being there or having the stone there). The stone is moving to pos55, so it won't be at pos41. So agent needs to visit pos13.

8. Player1 must never be at pos32. Our current plan doesn't go there.

So integrating these constraints:

- Need to visit pos25 (constraint 5)
- Visit pos12 (constraint 2 and 4)
- Visit pos13 (constraint7)
- Ensure that after visiting pos25, pos52 is not clear or agent is at pos44.

Let's adjust the plan to include these steps.

The current plan's steps are:

1. Move from pos21 to pos22 (down)
2. Move to pos23 (down)
3. Push stone to pos43 (dirright)
4. Agent at pos33
5. Push stone to pos53 (dirright)
6. Agent at pos43
7. Move to pos42 (up)
8. Move to pos52 (right)
9. Push stone to pos54 (dirdown)
10. Agent at pos53
11. Push stone to pos55 (dirdown)
12. Agent at pos54

But this misses the constraints. Let's insert necessary steps.

To visit pos25: perhaps after pushing the stone to pos43, the agent can move to pos25, then continue.

But moving to pos25 from pos33: possible paths.

From pos33, possible movements:

- dirleft to pos23
- dirright to pos43
- dirup to pos32 (forbidden)
- dirdown to pos34 (forbidden)

So can't go up or down from pos33. So agent at pos33 can only move left to pos23 or right to pos43.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos43 (agent at pos33), the agent can move back to pos23 (dirleft), then pos22 (up), pos21 (up), pos31 (right), pos41 (right), etc. But this might take time.

Alternatively, after the first push to pos43 (agent at pos33), the agent can move left to pos23, then up to pos22, then up to pos21, then right to pos31, then right to pos41, then down to pos42, right to pos52, etc. But this is a long path. But to visit pos25, the agent needs to reach it somehow.

Pos25 is in row2, column5. From pos21, the agent can move down to pos22, down to pos23, down to pos24, down to pos25. But initially, pos24 and pos25 are clear.

So perhaps after moving to pos23, before pushing the stone, the agent can go down to pos24, then down to pos25 to satisfy constraint5, then return. But this would require moving from pos23 to pos24 (down), then pos24 to pos25 (down). But after that, the agent needs to return to pos23 to push the stone.

But this adds steps. Let's see:

Original steps up to pos23:

1. pos21 → pos22 (down)
2. pos22 → pos23 (down)

Then, instead of pushing the stone, the agent continues down to pos24 and pos25:

3. pos23 → pos24 (down)
4. pos24 → pos25 (down) → satisfies constraint5.

Now, agent is at pos25. Then, according to constraint6, if the agent is at pos25, then in that state or later, pos52 must not be clear or agent is at pos44. So after being at pos25, we need to ensure that pos52 is not clear (e.g., agent moves there later) or the agent is at pos44.

But how? Let's see. After pos25, the agent needs to get back to pos23 to push the stone. So steps:

5. pos25 → pos24 (up)
6. pos24 → pos23 (up)
7. Now, push the stone from pos33 to pos43.

This would satisfy constraint5 (agent was at pos25). Then, later steps would have to ensure that after pos25, either pos52 is not clear or agent is at pos44.

But in the current plan, after pos25, the agent returns to pos23, pushes the stone, then proceeds. Later, the agent moves to pos52 (step8), making pos52 not clear. So in the state when the agent is at pos52, pos52 is not clear, which satisfies constraint6. Because the agent was at pos25 in step4, and later at step8, pos52 is not clear. So constraint6 is satisfied.

Now, other constraints:

- constraint2: need pos12 not clear or stone1 at pos31. Stone1 is at pos33 → pos43 → ... → pos55. Never at pos31. So must make pos12 not clear by having the agent visit pos12. So insert a move to pos12 somewhere.

Similarly, constraint7: agent at pos13 or pos41 not clear. Since pos41 is clear initially, and the stone is not moved there, need the agent to visit pos13.

Let's plan to visit pos12 and pos13.

Perhaps after the initial move to pos25, when returning, the agent can take a detour to pos12 and pos13.

After step7 (agent back at pos23), before pushing the stone, the agent can:

8. pos23 → pos22 (up)
9. pos22 → pos12 (left)
10. pos12 → pos13 (down)

This visits pos12 and pos13.

But moving from pos22 to pos12 is allowed via dirleft (movement from pos22 to pos12 is dirleft). Then pos12 to pos13 is dirdown.

Now, at pos13, which satisfies constraint7.

Then, the agent needs to get back to pos23 to push the stone. From pos13:

11. pos13 → pos23 (right)
12. Then push the stone from pos33 → pos43.

This way, the agent visits pos12 and pos13, satisfying constraints2 and7 (pos12 is not clear when agent is there, and agent is at pos13).

But this adds a lot of steps. Let's see if this can be optimized.

Alternatively, after visiting pos25, the agent returns to pos24 → pos23 → pos22 → pos12 → pos13 → pos23 → push stone.

This would add steps but ensure constraints2,4,5,7 are met.

Now, let's check the constraints:

1. At least one state with agent at pos55 or pos11 not clear. If the agent doesn't reach pos55, then pos11 must not be clear. But pos11 is clear initially. So to satisfy this, either the agent must reach pos55 (but in the final step, after pushing to pos55, the agent is at pos54, not pos55), or make pos11 not clear. Since the stone is at pos55, and the agent is at pos54, pos11 remains clear. So to satisfy constraint1, the agent must reach pos55 at some point. But in the current plan, the final push leaves the agent at pos54. So the agent needs to move to pos55 after that.

So after step11 (pushing stone to pos55), agent is at pos54. Then, the agent can move to pos55 (dirright? Wait, from pos54, movement to pos55 is dirdown. So move from pos54 to pos55 via dirdown. So action move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown. Now, agent is at pos55, satisfying constraint1.

So adding that step:

12. move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown.

Now, constraint1 is satisfied because agent is at pos55 in step12.

Now, let's outline the entire plan with all constraints considered:

Steps:

1. move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown
2. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
3. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
4. move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown → satisfies constraint5
5. move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
6. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
7. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
8. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft → pos12 not clear (satisfies constraint2 and 4)
9. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown → satisfies constraint7
10. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright
11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright → stone to pos43, agent to pos33
12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirright → stone to pos53, agent to pos43
13. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
14. move player1 pos42 pos52 dirright → pos52 not clear (satisfies constraint6 after pos25)
15. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos53 pos54 dirdown → stone to pos54, agent to pos53
16. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown → stone to pos55, agent to pos54
17. move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown → satisfies constraint1

Now, check constraints:

- constraint1: agent at pos55 in step17 → satisfied.
- constraint2: pos12 not clear in step8 → satisfied.
- constraint3: agent never at pos34 → satisfied.
- constraint4: pos12 not clear in step8 → satisfied.
- constraint5: agent at pos25 in step4 → satisfied.
- constraint6: after step4 (pos25), in step14, agent is at pos52 (pos52 not clear), so satisfied.
- constraint7: agent at pos13 in step9 → satisfied.
- constraint8: agent never at pos32 → satisfied.

This plan should satisfy all constraints and achieve the goal.

Now, check if all actions are valid:

Step1: move from pos21 to pos22 (down) – allowed.
Step2: pos22 to pos23 (down) – allowed.
Step3: pos23 to pos24 (down) – allowed.
Step4: pos24 to pos25 (down) – allowed.
Step5: pos25 to pos24 (up) – allowed.
Step6: pos24 to pos23 (up) – allowed.
Step7: pos23 to pos22 (up) – allowed.
Step8: pos22 to pos12 (left) – allowed.
Step9: pos12 to pos13 (down) – allowed.
Step10: pos13 to pos23 (right) – allowed.
Step11: push from pos23 to pos33 to pos43 – agent at pos23, stone at pos33, direction right. Preconditions: pos23 is agent's location, stone at pos33, pos43 clear. Yes, pos43 is initially clear. Directions: pos23 to pos33 (right), pos33 to pos43 (right). Valid. So pushtonongoal.
Step12: push from pos33 to pos43 to pos53. Agent at pos33, stone at pos43. Direction right. pos53 is clear. Valid. pushtonongoal.
Step13: move pos43 to pos42 (up) – allowed.
Step14: move pos42 to pos52 (right) – allowed.
Step15: push from pos52 to pos53 to pos54. Agent at pos52, stone at pos53. Direction dirdown (east). pos54 is clear. Valid. pushtonongoal.
Step16: push from pos53 to pos54 to pos55. Agent at pos53, stone at pos54. Direction dirdown. pos55 is goal. Valid. pushtogoal.
Step17: move pos54 to pos55 (dirdown) – allowed.

All actions are valid. All constraints are met. The plan length is 17 steps, but maybe there's a shorter way. However, given the constraints, especially needing to visit multiple positions, this might be the optimal.
