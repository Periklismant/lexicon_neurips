Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. From the initial state, stone1 is at pos43, and the only goal location mentioned is pos14. So the main task is to move stone1 from pos43 to pos14. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy as well. Let me list them out and see how to handle each one.

First, the constraints:

1. At least one of pos23 or pos22 must be not clear in some state.
2. pos53 must be not clear in some state.
3. If pos53 is not clear in a state, then player1 was at pos52 earlier.
4. pos32 being not clear can only hold in at most one continuous sequence. So maybe only once, or not overlapping with other times.
5. pos14 must be not clear in some state. Since pos14 is the goal, maybe after moving the stone there.
6. If pos14 is not clear (which would be when the stone is there), then either stone1 is at pos55 or pos53 is not clear must hold in that state or later. But since stone1 is at pos14 (the goal), pos55 is not involved. So maybe we need to have pos53 not clear after moving the stone to pos14. But how?
7. stone1 must be at pos24 in some state.
8. If stone1 is at pos24, then earlier either stone1 was at pos45 or pos21 was not clear. So need to ensure that when moving stone1 to pos24, either it came from pos45 (which it's not initially) or pos21 was occupied before.
9. stone1 must be at pos14 (the goal) in some state, which is our main goal.
10. If stone1 is at pos14, then player1 was at pos11 earlier. So we need to have the agent visit pos11 before moving the stone to pos14.
11. pos33 must be not clear in some state.

Okay, this is a lot. Let's start by figuring out the main path. The stone is at pos43, and needs to get to pos14. The agent starts at pos22. Let's think about the possible paths.

From pos43, the stone can be pushed up, left, right, or down, based on the movement directions. Let's check the movement options. Looking at the allowed moves for pos43: You can go from pos43 to pos33 (left), pos53 (right), pos42 (up), or pos44 (down). But to push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. So to push the stone from pos43, the agent must be in pos42, pos33, pos44, or pos53? Wait, no. The agent has to be in a position adjacent to the stone, in the direction opposite to the push. For example, to push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (left), the agent needs to be at pos43 and push left, but wait, no. Wait, the direction is the direction of the movement. Let me check the action definitions again.

The "pushtogoal" action requires that the agent is at l_p, and the stone is at l_from. The agent can push the stone from l_from to l_to following direction d. So the agent must be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from in the direction opposite to d. Wait, no. The preconditions say that you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d, and from l_from to l_to following direction d. So if the direction is, say, dirleft, then moving from l_p to l_follow via dirleft would mean that l_p is to the right of l_from. Then, pushing the stone from l_from (pos43) to l_to (pos42, which is up?), no. Wait, perhaps the directions need to be mapped to the grid. Let's consider the grid layout. The positions are in a 5x5 grid, with pos11 at top-left, pos15 top-right, pos51 bottom-left, etc. So directions: dirup would be from a higher row to a lower row (like pos22 to pos12), dirdown is lower row (pos22 to pos32), dirleft is left column (pos22 to pos21), dirright is right column (pos22 to pos23). So, for example, moving from pos43 to pos42 would be dirleft (since moving left in columns: 3 to 2), but according to the allowed moves, from pos43, moving up is pos42 (since row 4 to row 4? Wait, maybe the positions are rows and columns. Wait, pos43 is row 4, column 3. So moving up would decrease the row number, down increases. So pos43 moving up would be pos33 (row 3, column3), moving down to pos53 (row5, column3). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, looking at the allowed moves given in the problem: For example, "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft". Wait, pos43 is row4, column3. pos33 is row3, column3. So moving from pos43 to pos33 would be dirup. But according to the given allowed moves, pos43 can move to pos33 via dirleft? That seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps the directions are different. Let me check the movement directions again.

Looking at the allowed moves for pos43: 

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"

Wait, pos43 to pos33 is moving from row4 to row3, same column. That should be direction dirup. But according to the problem statement, that move is allowed with direction dirleft. That's conflicting. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem's direction mappings. Alternatively, perhaps the directions are labeled differently. For example, dirleft might correspond to moving left along the row (columns decrease), dirright to columns increase, dirup to rows decrease, dirdown to rows increase. So, for example, moving from pos43 to pos33 would be dirup (row decreases by 1). But the problem says that move is allowed with direction dirleft, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me check the allowed moves again.

Looking at the allowed moves for pos43:

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"

Wait, pos43 is row4, column3. pos33 is row3, column3. So moving up (dirup) would be correct. But the problem states the direction as dirleft. That's a problem. Similarly, moving from pos43 to pos53 (row5, column3) is direction dirdown. But according to the problem statement, pos43 can move to pos53 via dirright. Wait, no. Let me check:

Wait the allowed moves for pos43 are:

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown"

Wait, this is strange. pos43 to pos33 is dirleft? That would imply that moving from column3 to column3 but row4 to row3, which doesn't make sense. Unless the directions are not aligned with rows and columns. Alternatively, perhaps the directions are relative. For example, dirleft could mean moving left in the grid (columns decrease), dirright columns increase, dirup rows decrease, dirdown rows increase. But according to the allowed moves, moving from pos43 (row4, column3) to pos33 (row3, column3) is dirleft. That can't be right. That move should be dirup. But according to the problem statement, it's dirleft. This suggests that the direction labels might be incorrect, or perhaps there's a different way of interpreting the grid.

Alternatively, perhaps the grid is structured such that moving in a direction corresponds to a certain axis. For example, dirleft and dirright could correspond to moving along the rows (left being column decrease, right column increase), and dirup/down moving along columns (up being row decrease, down row increase). But then, moving from pos43 to pos33 would be dirup (row decreases by 1), but the problem says it's dirleft, which would be column decrease. But pos43 to pos33 is same column, row decreases. So this is conflicting. There's a mistake here, perhaps. Alternatively, the problem has a typo in the allowed directions.

Alternatively, perhaps the movement directions are defined such that each direction corresponds to moving in a certain way. For example, dirleft could mean moving to the cell to the left, regardless of row/column. But in that case, pos43's left neighbor would be pos42 (column decreases by 1), but according to the allowed moves, moving from pos43 to pos42 is dirup. This is confusing. Let me check some other allowed moves to see the pattern.

Looking at pos22's allowed moves:

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft"

pos22 is row2, column2. pos12 is row1, column2. So moving up (row decreases by 1). But the direction here is dirleft. That's inconsistent. So perhaps the directions are labeled incorrectly. This is a problem because if the directions are not correctly mapped, then the plan might be invalid.

Wait, this must be a mistake in the problem statement. For example, the allowed move from pos22 to pos12 is direction dirleft. But pos12 is above pos22. So perhaps the directions are not aligned with the grid as I assumed. Alternatively, the grid is structured differently. Let me try to map the allowed moves to understand the directions.

Let's take some examples:

- pos11 can move to pos21 (direction dirright) and pos12 (dirdown). pos21 is row2, column1, which is down from pos11. So moving dirright from pos11 leads to pos21 (down), and dirdown leads to pos12 (right). This suggests that the directions are not as I thought. So dirright from pos11 (row1, column1) goes to pos21 (row2, column1), which is down. Dirdown from pos11 goes to pos12 (row1, column2), which is right. So in this case, dirright corresponds to moving down (increasing row), and dirdown corresponds to moving right (increasing column). Similarly, dirleft would be moving up (decreasing row), and dirup would be moving left (decreasing column). That seems inverted.

Wait, let's see: pos11 to pos21 via dirright. So direction dirright is moving down. pos11 to pos12 via dirdown, which is moving right. So directions are as follows:

- dirright: move down (row increases)
- dirleft: move up (row decreases)
- dirdown: move right (column increases)
- dirup: move left (column decreases)

That's the only way to make sense of the given allowed moves. For example:

- pos22 to pos12 via dirleft: pos12 is up (row1) from pos22 (row2), so dirleft corresponds to moving up (row decreases).
- pos22 to pos32 via dirright: dirright is down (row3).
- pos22 to pos21 via dirup: dirup is moving left (column decreases to 1).
- pos22 to pos23 via dirdown: dirdown is moving right (column increases to 3).

So in this mapping:

- dirright: row +1 (down)
- dirleft: row -1 (up)
- dirdown: column +1 (right)
- dirup: column -1 (left)

This is counterintuitive but based on the allowed moves provided. So for example, moving from pos43 to pos33 would be dirleft (row decreases by 1). pos43 (row4, column3) to pos33 (row3, column3) via dirleft. That makes sense now. Similarly, moving from pos43 to pos53 (row5, column3) via dirright (row increases by 1). Moving from pos43 to pos42 via dirup (column decreases by 1, from 3 to 2). And pos43 to pos44 via dirdown (column increases by 1 to 4).

Okay, now that I understand the directions, let's proceed.

The stone is at pos43 (row4, column3). The goal is to get it to pos14 (row1, column4), which is a goal location.

So the agent starts at pos22 (row2, column2). They need to navigate to the stone and push it to pos14.

But there are constraints. Let's list them again and see how to satisfy each.

Constraints:

1. At least one of pos23 or pos22 not clear in some state. So either the agent or a stone is there at some point.
2. pos53 must be not clear in some state. So agent or stone is at pos53.
3. If pos53 is not clear, then earlier the agent was at pos52.
4. pos32 not clear can be in at most one continuous sequence. So if the agent or stone is at pos32, it can't be multiple times unless it's a single continuous period.
5. pos14 must be not clear (when the stone is there).
6. When pos14 is not clear (stone there), then either stone1 is at pos55 (which it's not) or pos53 is not clear. So after putting the stone at pos14, we need to have pos53 not clear. So maybe after moving the stone to pos14, the agent moves to pos53, or another stone is there (but there's only one stone). Wait, but the stone is at pos14. So the agent must be at pos53 in some state after the stone is at pos14. But the agent can't be at pos53 unless they move there. So perhaps after placing the stone at pos14, the agent moves to pos53. But how? Let's think.

7. stone1 must be at pos24 in some state. So the stone needs to pass through pos24. But pos24 is not a goal. So maybe we need to push it there temporarily.

8. If stone1 is at pos24, then earlier either it was at pos45 or pos21 was not clear. Since initially, pos21 is clear, the agent can occupy pos21 to make it not clear. So when pushing the stone to pos24, the agent must have been at pos21 before, or the stone was at pos45. But the stone starts at pos43, so maybe we need to push it to pos45 first, then to pos24. Or have the agent move to pos21 before pushing to pos24.

9. stone1 must be at pos14 (the goal).

10. If stone1 is at pos14, then the agent was at pos11 earlier. So the agent must visit pos11 before the stone reaches pos14.

11. pos33 must be not clear in some state. So agent or stone there.

Additionally, constraint 7 requires that the stone is at pos24 at some point. So the path from pos43 to pos14 must go through pos24? Or maybe take a detour.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline a possible path.

First, the agent needs to reach the stone at pos43. Starting at pos22.

Possible path: pos22 → pos23 (dirdown) → pos24 (dirdown) → pos34 (dirright) → pos44 (dirright) → pos43 (dirup). Wait, let's check the allowed moves.

From pos22, moving dirdown (right) to pos23. Then from pos23, dirdown (right) to pos24. From pos24, dirright (down) to pos34. Then from pos34, dirright (down) to pos44. Then from pos44, dirup (left) to pos43. Wait, no. Let's check the allowed moves:

From pos22, moving dirdown (right) would go to pos23. From pos23, dirdown (right) to pos24. From pos24, dirright (down) to pos34. Then from pos34, dirright (down) to pos44. From pos44, dirup (left) is to pos43. So agent moves to pos44, then to pos43 via dirup. But to push the stone at pos43, the agent needs to be adjacent in the direction opposite to the push direction. Wait, the agent is at pos44 and wants to push the stone from pos43. So the stone is at pos43, agent is at pos44. The direction for pushing would be dirleft (since from pos44 to pos43 is dirup (column decreases), so the agent can push the stone from pos43 to pos42 (dirup), but wait, no. Let me clarify.

The agent is at pos44. To push the stone at pos43, the direction must be such that the agent can get from pos44 to pos43 (precondition iv: you can get from l_p to l_from following d). So direction from pos44 to pos43 is dirup (since moving from pos44 to pos43 is column decreases by 1, which is dirup). Then, pushing the stone from pos43 to pos42 (dirup), but pos42 is a non-goal. So using pushtonongoal. But we need to push the stone to pos14 eventually.

Alternatively, the agent could push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft), which is a non-goal. Then from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft), then to pos24 (dirdown?), but this seems complicated.

Alternatively, the agent could push the stone from pos43 to pos53 (dirright), but pos53 is a non-goal. But this could help with constraint 2 (pos53 not clear). Also, constraint3 requires that if pos53 is not clear, the agent was at pos52 earlier. So if we push the stone to pos53, the agent must have been at pos52 before.

Alternatively, the agent could push the stone up (dirleft) to pos33, then left (dirleft) to pos23, etc. But this would require multiple steps.

But let's think about the constraints. The stone must pass through pos24 (constraint7). So perhaps the path is pos43 → pos44 → pos34 → pos24 → ... → pos14.

But how to get from pos43 to pos24. Let's think:

From pos43, pushing the stone to pos44 (dirdown, right column). Then from pos44, pushing to pos45 (dirdown), then pos55 (dirright), but pos55 is not a goal. Not helpful. Alternatively, from pos44, push to pos34 (dirleft), then pos24 (dirleft), etc.

Alternatively, the agent moves to pos43 and pushes the stone to pos33 (dirleft), then to pos23 (dirleft), then to pos24 (dirdown). But pos24 is not a goal. Then from pos24, push to pos14 (dirleft). But pos14 is a goal. So that could work.

But let's outline steps:

1. Agent moves from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown), then to pos24 (dirdown), then to pos34 (dirright), then to pos44 (dirright), then to pos43 (dirup). Now agent is at pos43. Wait, no. The stone is at pos43, so the agent can't be there unless it's pushing it. Wait, no. The initial state has stone1 at pos43, and pos43 is clear. Wait, no. Wait, in the initial state, the stone is at pos43, so pos43 is not clear. Because the initial state says "Location pos43 is clear" is false. Wait, the original state says "Location pos43 is clear" is in the initial state? Let me check the original state.

Original state: "Location pos22 is clear" and "Location pos43 is clear". Wait, no. Looking back:

The original state says:

"player1 is at location pos22"

"stone1 is at location pos43"

Then, in the list of "Location ... is clear", it includes "Location pos43 is clear" but that can't be correct if the stone is there. Wait, no. Let me check again.

In the original state, the "clear" locations are listed. For example, "Location pos11 is clear", "Location pos12 is clear", etc. Then at the end, "Location pos22 is clear" and "Location pos43 is clear". But that's impossible because the agent is at pos22 and the stone is at pos43. So this must be a mistake. Wait, the original state says:

"player1 is at location pos22"

"stone1 is at location pos43"

Then, the list of clear locations includes:

"Location pos11 is clear"

...

"Location pos22 is clear"

Wait, but player1 is at pos22, so pos22 should not be clear. Similarly, stone1 is at pos43, so pos43 should not be clear. But according to the problem statement, the original state includes "Location pos22 is clear" and "Location pos43 is clear". That's contradictory. This must be a mistake in the problem statement, but since I have to work with it, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, the problem statement might have a typo, and some of the clear locations are incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps "clear" means that there is no stone or agent present. But if the agent is at pos22, then pos22 is not clear. Similarly, the stone is at pos43, so pos43 is not clear. Therefore, the original state's description of "Location pos22 is clear" and "Location pos43 is clear" must be incorrect. But the problem states that these are part of the original state. This is confusing. Wait, perhaps the initial state's clear locations are after considering the agent and stones. So if the agent is at pos22, then pos22 is not clear, and if the stone is at pos43, then pos43 is not clear. Therefore, the problem's listing of "Location pos22 is clear" and "Location pos43 is clear" must be errors. But I have to proceed with the given information.

Wait, no. Let me recheck the problem statement's original state:

The original state of the world is the following:

- "player1 is at location pos22"

- "stone1 is at location pos43"

- Then a list of clear locations: pos11, pos12, ..., pos21, pos23, pos24, ..., pos43 is NOT in the clear list. Wait, looking at the list:

The clear locations include:

"Location pos11 is clear"

"Location pos12 is clear"

"Location pos13 is clear"

"Location pos14 is clear"

"Location pos15 is clear"

"Location pos21 is clear"

"Location pos23 is clear"

"Location pos24 is clear"

"Location pos25 is clear"

"Location pos31 is clear"

"Location pos32 is clear"

"Location pos33 is clear"

"Location pos34 is clear"

"Location pos35 is clear"

"Location pos41 is clear"

"Location pos42 is clear"

"Location pos44 is clear"

"Location pos45 is clear"

"Location pos51 is clear"

"Location pos52 is clear"

"Location pos53 is clear"

"Location pos54 is clear"

"Location pos55 is clear"

Then, at the end:

"Location pos22 is clear" and "Location pos43 is clear"

Wait, but this contradicts the initial placement of the agent and stone. Because if the agent is at pos22, then pos22 should not be clear. Similarly, if the stone is at pos43, pos43 should not be clear. So there's a mistake here. But perhaps the problem intended that the initial state has the agent at pos22 (so pos22 is not clear), and the stone at pos43 (so pos43 is not clear). But the problem lists pos22 and pos43 as clear, which is impossible. This is a critical error. However, since I have to work with the given data, perhaps the clear list is after considering the agent and stone positions. So maybe the initial clear list is including pos22 and pos43, which is incorrect, but we have to proceed as if those are clear. But that would mean the agent is not at pos22, which contradicts. This is very confusing. Perhaps there's a typo, and the clear locations for pos22 and pos43 are actually not clear. But the problem states:

Original state includes:

"player1 is at location pos22" → pos22 is occupied by the agent, so not clear.

"stone1 is at location pos43" → pos43 is occupied by the stone, so not clear.

But in the list of clear locations, "Location pos22 is clear" and "Location pos43 is clear" are present. That's impossible. This must be a mistake. Maybe the problem intended that pos22 and pos43 are NOT clear. But according to the given data, they are. This is a problem. But since I have to proceed, perhaps I should assume that the clear list is correct, which would mean the agent and stone are not in those positions. But that contradicts the initial state. This is a major issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's initial state lists "Location pos22 is clear" and "Location pos43 is clear" but also states that the agent and stone are at those positions. That would be a contradiction. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem statement. But since I can't change the problem, I'll proceed under the assumption that the initial positions of the agent and stone are correct, and the clear locations are listed except for those occupied by the agent and stone. So pos22 and pos43 are not clear, but the problem's list incorrectly includes them. Therefore, in reality, pos22 and pos43 are not clear.

So, the agent is at pos22 → pos22 is not clear.

Stone is at pos43 → pos43 is not clear.

The other clear locations are as listed. So, the initial clear locations include all except pos22 and pos43.

This is the only way to make sense of the problem. So, I'll proceed with that assumption.

Now, back to the plan.

The agent starts at pos22. The stone is at pos43. The agent needs to reach the stone and push it to pos14, satisfying all constraints.

First, the agent must move to a position adjacent to the stone to push it. The stone is at pos43. The adjacent positions are pos42 (up), pos33 (left), pos44 (down), pos53 (right). But the agent needs to reach one of those positions to push the stone.

Let's consider moving the agent to pos33, which is left of the stone. To get there from pos22:

pos22 → pos23 (dirdown) → pos24 (dirdown) → pos34 (dirright) → pos33 (dirup). Wait, let's check the allowed moves.

From pos22, moving dirdown (right) to pos23.

From pos23, dirdown (right) to pos24.

From pos24, dirright (down) to pos34.

From pos34, dirup (left) to pos33.

Now agent is at pos33. Then, the agent can push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft). Wait, but pos43 is at row4, column3. Pushing dirleft (row decrease) would take it to pos33 (row3, column3). So the action would be pushtonongoal, since pos33 is not a goal. So:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos33 dirleft

Wait, but the preconditions for pushtonongoal are:

(i) agent is at l_p (pos33), 

(ii) stone is at l_from (pos43), 

(iii) l_to (pos33) is clear. But pos33 is currently clear (according to initial state, but after agent moves to pos33, pos33 is not clear. So the agent is at pos33, which is now not clear. Then, pushing the stone to pos33 would require pos33 to be clear, but it's occupied by the agent. So this is impossible. Therefore, the agent can't push the stone into the same cell they are in.

So this approach is invalid.

Alternatively, the agent could move to pos42 (up from the stone). To get to pos42 from pos22:

Possible path:

pos22 → pos32 (dirright) → pos42 (dirright). Let's see:

From pos22, dirright (down) to pos32.

From pos32, dirright (down) to pos42.

Now agent is at pos42. From here, the agent can push the stone at pos43 to pos42 (dirup), but pos42 is clear initially. So the action would be pushtonongoal, pushing to pos42 (non-goal). But after pushing, the stone is at pos42, which is not a goal. Then, the agent would need to push it further. But this might help with some constraints.

But also, pushing the stone to pos42 would make pos42 not clear, which might affect other constraints. Also, pos53 must be not clear at some point. So maybe after pushing to pos53.

Alternatively, agent moves to pos44 (down from stone). From pos22:

pos22 → pos32 (dirright) → pos42 (dirright) → pos43 (dirup). Wait, no. pos42 to pos43 is dirdown? Wait, from pos42, moving dirdown (right) would be to pos43. Because dirdown increases the column. So from pos42 (row4, column2), dirdown (right) to pos43 (column3). So agent moves from pos42 to pos43 via dirdown. But the stone is at pos43, so the agent can't move there unless pushing it. So to push the stone from pos43 to pos44, the agent needs to be at pos43. But that's only possible if the agent is adjacent and pushes it. So perhaps agent is at pos44 and pushes the stone to pos44. Wait, no. Let's see.

Agent is at pos44. They can push the stone from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown). But pos44 needs to be clear. Initially, pos44 is clear. So agent moves to pos44 via some path, then pushes the stone to pos44. But pos44 is not a goal, so pushtonongoal.

But the agent needs to reach pos44. Path from pos22 to pos44:

pos22 → pos32 (dirright) → pos42 (dirright) → pos43 (dirdown) → pos44 (dirdown). Wait, but pos43 is occupied by the stone. So agent can't move there. So alternative path: pos22 → pos23 (dirdown) → pos24 (dirdown) → pos34 (dirright) → pos44 (dirright). Now agent is at pos44. Then push the stone from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown). This would require:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos44 dirdown

Preconditions:

(i) agent is at pos44 → yes.

(ii) stone is at pos43 → yes.

(iii) pos44 is clear → yes, before the action.

(iv) can move from pos44 to pos43 via dirdown. Wait, pos44 to pos43 is dirup (column decreases by 1). So the direction would have to be dirup, but the action's direction is dirdown. This is confusing. Let me check the allowed moves for pos44:

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown"

So, to move from pos44 to pos43, direction is dirup (column decreases by 1). Therefore, to push the stone from pos43 to pos44, the agent must be at pos43 and push in direction dirdown. But the agent can't be at pos43 because it's occupied by the stone. So this approach is invalid.

Alternatively, the agent is at pos44 and pushes the stone from pos43 to pos44 via direction dirup. But that would require moving from pos44 to pos43 via dirup, which is allowed. So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos44 dirup. But the direction for pushing is dirup, meaning the stone moves from pos43 to pos44 following dirup. But dirup from pos43 would be column decrease, which is pos42. Wait, no. Wait, the direction is dirup, which corresponds to column decrease. So from pos43, dirup would be pos42. So pushing the stone from pos43 to pos44 would require direction dirdown (column increase). Because pos43 to pos44 is dirdown (column 3 → 4). So to push from pos43 to pos44, the direction is dirdown. But the agent must be able to move from their current location (pos44) to pos43 following direction d. So direction from pos44 to pos43 is dirup (column decrease). So the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos44 dirdown. But wait, the direction for the push is dirdown (from pos43 to pos44). The agent is at pos44. To push, the agent must be able to move from pos44 to pos43 following direction d. Which direction allows that? According to allowed moves, pos44 to pos43 is dirup. So the agent must use dirup as the direction for moving from pos44 to pos43. Therefore, the action's direction is dirup. But the stone is pushed from pos43 to pos44 following dirdown. So the action's direction is dirup for the agent's movement from pos44 to pos43, and dirdown for the stone's movement. But the action requires that both movements follow the same direction. The action's parameters include direction d, which must be the same for both the agent's movement to the stone and the stone's movement to the destination. Therefore, this is not possible. Hence, the agent can't push the stone from pos43 to pos44 from pos44.

This is getting really complicated. Let's try a different approach. Maybe the agent needs to go around to pos53 and push the stone left to pos43 to pos42, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, the agent could push the stone up to pos33, then left to pos23, etc.

But let's think about the constraints. Constraint 7 requires the stone to be at pos24. So maybe the stone's path must go through pos24. How to get there from pos43.

Possible path: pos43 → pos33 → pos23 → pos24. But pushing from pos43 to pos33 requires the agent to be at pos33. So agent moves to pos33, then pushes the stone to pos33. But then the stone is at pos33, and the agent is at pos33. No, that's not possible. Wait, after pushing, the agent moves to pos43. Because when you push, the agent moves from pos33 to pos43, pushing the stone to pos33. Wait, no. The pushtonongoal action's effect is that the agent moves from l_p (pos33) to l_from (pos43), and the stone moves from l_from (pos43) to l_to (pos33). So after the action, the agent is at pos43, and the stone is at pos33. But pos43 is now clear, and pos33 is occupied by the stone. Then, the agent can push the stone from pos33 to pos23, etc.

So let's outline this path:

1. Agent moves from pos22 to pos33.

Path: pos22 → pos32 (dirright) → pos33 (dirdown). Let's check:

pos22 to pos32 via dirright (down). From pos32, dirdown (right) to pos33. Now agent is at pos33.

Then, pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos33 dirleft. Wait, but the direction from pos33 to pos43 is dirright (down), but the stone is at pos43. Wait, no. The agent is at pos33. To push the stone at pos43 to pos33, the direction must allow the agent to move from pos33 to pos43. The allowed direction from pos33 to pos43 is dirright (down). So the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos33 dirright.

Preconditions:

(i) agent at pos33 → yes.

(ii) stone at pos43 → yes.

(iii) pos33 is clear → initially yes, but after agent moves to pos33, it's not clear. So no. This action is invalid because after moving to pos33, pos33 is occupied by the agent, so the stone can't be pushed there.

Therefore, this approach is invalid.

Alternative approach: The agent needs to push the stone from pos43 to pos42. So the agent moves to pos42. How?

Agent starts at pos22. To get to pos42:

pos22 → pos32 (dirright) → pos42 (dirright). Now at pos42.

Then, push the stone from pos43 to pos42 via dirup.

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos42 dirup.

Preconditions:

(i) agent at pos42 → yes.

(ii) stone at pos43 → yes.

(iii) pos42 is clear → initially yes. But after the agent moves to pos42, pos42 is not clear. Wait, after the agent moves to pos42, pos42 is occupied. So the stone can't be pushed to pos42 because it's not clear. Therefore, this action is invalid.

Hmm. So pushing the stone to pos42 is not possible because the agent is already there. So the agent needs to be at a position adjacent to the stone, but not in the direction they want to push. So for example, to push the stone from pos43 to pos42 (dirup), the agent must be at pos43 and push dirup. But the agent can't be at pos43 because it's occupied by the stone. Alternatively, the agent can be at pos53 and push the stone to pos43's left, but that's not helpful.

This is getting really tricky. Let's try to think of the shortest path to get the stone to pos14 while satisfying all constraints.

Another approach: The stone needs to reach pos14. The goal is pos14. The constraints require that the agent visits pos11 before moving the stone to pos14 (constraint10). Also, the stone must be at pos24 (constraint7), and when it's at pos24, either it was at pos45 earlier or pos21 was not clear. So maybe the agent needs to move to pos21 first to make it not clear.

Also, constraint11 requires pos33 to be not clear. So perhaps the stone must pass through pos33.

Let me try to outline a possible sequence:

1. Agent moves to pos21 (from pos22 via dirup). Then, pos21 is not clear, satisfying part of constraint8 if the stone is later at pos24.

2. Agent moves to pos31 (from pos21 via dirright), then to pos41, pos51, etc. Not sure.

Alternatively, agent moves from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown), pos24 (dirdown), pos34 (dirright), pos44 (dirright), pos54 (dirright), pos55 (dirright). But this seems long.

Wait, let's focus on the constraints one by one.

Constraint3: If pos53 is not clear, then agent was at pos52 earlier.

So to make pos53 not clear (either agent or stone there), agent must visit pos52 first.

Constraint2: pos53 must be not clear in some state.

So the agent can move to pos53, but first must go to pos52. So perhaps:

Agent moves to pos52, then to pos53.

But why? To satisfy constraint2 and 3.

Constraint10: When stone is at pos14, agent must have been at pos11 earlier.

So agent needs to visit pos11 before the final push to pos14.

Constraint4: pos32 not clear can be in at most one continuous sequence. So pos32 can be occupied once, but not multiple times.

Constraint6: After pos14 is not clear (stone there), either stone1 is at pos55 (impossible) or pos53 is not clear. So after placing the stone at pos14, the agent must make pos53 not clear (by being there or another stone). Since there's only one stone, the agent must go to pos53 after moving the stone to pos14.

Constraint5: pos14 must be not clear (stone there).

Constraint9: stone must be at pos14.

Constraint7: stone must be at pos24. So during the plan, the stone must pass through pos24.

Constraint8: When stone is at pos24, earlier either stone was at pos45 or pos21 was not clear. So if the agent makes pos21 not clear before moving the stone to pos24, that satisfies it.

Constraint11: pos33 must be not clear in some state.

Let's try to outline a plan that satisfies all constraints:

Step 1: Move agent to pos21. This makes pos21 not clear, which can help with constraint8.

Action: move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup.

Preconditions: agent at pos22, pos21 clear (initially yes), path exists. Yes, from pos22 to pos21 via dirup.

After moving, pos21 is not clear.

Step 2: Move agent back to pos22. Not sure why, but perhaps to reach other areas.

But maybe not. Let's think.

Step 1: Agent moves to pos21. Now pos21 is not clear. This helps satisfy constraint8 when the stone is at pos24.

Step 3: Agent moves to pos31 (dirright from pos21), then to pos32 (dirdown), then to pos42 (dirright), then to pos43 (dirdown). But pos43 is occupied by the stone. So agent can't move there.

Alternatively, agent moves from pos21 to pos22 (dirdown), then to pos32 (dirright), pos42 (dirright), then to pos43 (dirdown). But again, pos43 is occupied.

Hmm. Alternatively, agent moves from pos21 to pos11 (dirleft), but how? From pos21, allowed moves are to pos11 (dirleft), pos31 (dirright), pos22 (dirdown). So agent can move to pos11 via dirleft.

Action: move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft.

This satisfies constraint10 if later the stone is at pos14, because the agent was at pos11.

Step 4: Now agent is at pos11. Then, they need to navigate to the stone.

From pos11, possible moves: pos21 (dirright), pos12 (dirdown). Let's go to pos12 (dirdown).

Action: move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown.

Step5: From pos12 to pos22 (dirright).

Action: move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright.

Now agent is back at pos22.

This seems like a detour, but it ensures that the agent visited pos11, satisfying constraint10 when the stone is later moved to pos14.

Now, from pos22, agent needs to reach the stone at pos43.

Possible path: pos22 → pos32 (dirright) → pos42 (dirright) → pos43 (dirdown). But pos43 is occupied by the stone. So agent can't move there. So instead, agent can push the stone from pos43 once they are adjacent.

Alternatively, agent moves to pos42 (dirright from pos32), then pushes the stone to pos42.

But as before, agent can't be at pos42 and push to pos42.

Alternative approach: agent moves to pos53 to satisfy constraint2 and 3.

But to get to pos53, agent needs to go through pos52 first (constraint3).

Path: pos22 → pos32 (dirright) → pos42 (dirright) → pos52 (dirright) → pos53 (dirdown).

Action: move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright.

Action: move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright.

Action: move player1 pos42 pos52 dirright.

Action: move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown.

Now agent is at pos53. This satisfies constraint2 (pos53 not clear) and constraint3 (agent was at pos52 earlier).

Then, agent can push the stone from pos43 to pos53 (dirright). But pos53 is a non-goal. So action:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos53 dirleft.

Preconditions:

Agent at pos53 (yes).

Stone at pos43 (yes).

pos53 is clear (after agent moves there, it's not clear. Wait, after moving to pos53, pos53 is occupied by the agent. So the stone can't be pushed there. So this is invalid.

Thus, the agent can't push the stone to pos53 while being there. So another approach: agent moves to pos52, then to pos53, but then can't push. So perhaps, after moving to pos53, the agent leaves and pushes from another direction.

Alternatively, the agent could push the stone from pos43 to pos53 while being at pos52. How?

From pos52, the agent can move to pos53 (dirdown). So to push the stone from pos43 to pos53, the agent must be at pos43 and push dirright. But the agent can't be at pos43.

Alternatively, the agent is at pos53 and pushes the stone to pos53. No, same cell.

Alternatively, the agent is at pos53 and pushes the stone from pos53 to pos54. But the stone isn't there.

This is getting too convoluted. Maybe the best approach is to focus on the main goal and see which constraints can be satisfied along the way.

Main goal: Move stone from pos43 to pos14.

Constraints:

- Must visit pos11 before placing stone at pos14.

- Stone must be at pos24.

- When stone is at pos24, either pos21 was not clear or stone was at pos45.

- pos53 must be not clear, and agent was at pos52 before.

- pos33 must be not clear.

- pos14 must be not clear, and after that, pos53 must be not clear.

Let's try to plan the main path:

1. Agent moves to pos11 (to satisfy constraint10 later).

Path: pos22 → pos21 (dirup) → pos11 (dirleft).

Actions:

move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup

move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft

2. Agent moves back to pos22 to proceed to the stone.

Actions:

move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright

move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown

3. Agent moves to pos43 to push the stone.

But how? Let's find a path from pos22 to pos43.

Possible path:

pos22 → pos32 (dirright) → pos42 (dirright) → pos43 (dirdown)

But pos43 is occupied by the stone. So agent can't move there. So instead, the agent can push the stone from pos43 once adjacent.

From pos42, the agent can push the stone to pos43 (dirright) but the stone is already there. So maybe push it from pos42 to pos43.

Wait, no. The stone is at pos43. To push it, the agent must be at a position adjacent to it.

From pos42, the agent can push the stone to pos43 (dirdown). But the stone is already there. So no.

Alternatively, agent is at pos44 and pushes the stone to pos44. But as discussed earlier, this isn't possible.

Alternative approach: Push the stone from pos43 to pos33.

To do this, agent needs to be at pos33.

Path from pos22 to pos33:

pos22 → pos32 (dirright) → pos33 (dirdown)

Actions:

move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright

move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown

Now agent is at pos33. Push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft).

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos33 dirleft.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos33 (yes).

- Stone at pos43 (yes).

- pos33 is clear (no, agent is there). So invalid.

Thus, can't push to pos33.

Alternative: Push the stone from pos43 to pos42.

Agent moves to pos42.

Path: pos33 → pos32 (dirup) → pos42 (dirright)

Wait, from pos33, move to pos32 (dirup) → pos32. Then to pos42 (dirright).

Actions:

move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup

move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright

Now agent at pos42. Push stone from pos43 to pos42 (dirup).

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos42 dirup.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos42 (yes).

- Stone at pos43 (yes).

- pos42 is clear (no, agent is there). Invalid.

Another dead end.

Perhaps the agent needs to push the stone to pos53.

But to do that, agent must first be at pos52 (constraint3).

Path: pos22 → pos32 → pos42 → pos52 → pos53.

Actions:

move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright

move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright

move player1 pos42 pos52 dirright

move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown

Now agent at pos53 (satisfies constraint2 and 3).

Then, push the stone from pos43 to pos53 (dirright).

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos53 dirleft.

But agent is at pos53, which is not clear, so the stone can't be pushed there. Invalid.

Thus, this approach is not working.

Alternative plan:

Let's try to push the stone to pos24 as required by constraint7.

From pos43, how to get to pos24.

Possible path: pos43 → pos33 → pos23 → pos24.

To push from pos43 to pos33, agent needs to be at pos33.

Agent's path to pos33:

pos22 → pos32 → pos33.

Actions:

move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright

move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown

Now at pos33. Push stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft).

But pos33 is occupied by agent. Invalid.

Alternatively, agent moves to pos34 and pushes the stone to pos34.

But how?

From pos33, move to pos34 (dirdown).

Action: move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown.

Now agent at pos34. Push stone from pos43 to pos34 (dirleft).

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos43 pos34 dirleft.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos34 (yes).

- Stone at pos43 (yes).

- pos34 is clear (after agent moved there, it's not clear). So invalid.

Another dead end.

This is really challenging. Maybe the optimal plan requires multiple steps and passing through various positions to satisfy the constraints. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should outline a possible plan that satisfies all constraints, even if it's longer.

Let's try the following steps:

1. Move agent to pos52 to later satisfy constraint3.

move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright

move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright

move player1 pos42 pos52 dirright

move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown

Now agent at pos53 (satisfies constraint2 and 3).

Then, move back to pos52.

move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup

Now agent at pos52.

2. Move agent to pos11 to satisfy constraint10.

Path: pos52 → pos42 dirleft → pos32 dirleft → pos22 dirleft → pos21 dirup → pos11 dirleft.

Actions:

move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft

move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft

move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft

move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup

move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft

Now agent is at pos11.

3. Move agent back to pos43 to push the stone.

But this is a long path. Maybe:

pos11 → pos21 dirright → pos22 dirdown → pos32 dirright → pos42 dirright → pos43 dirdown.

But pos43 is occupied by the stone. So agent can't move there. So need to push the stone from a distance.

Alternative approach: From pos11, agent moves to pos12, pos22, then to pos32, pos42, pos43 (but can't).

Alternatively, agent moves to pos21, pos31, pos41, pos51, etc.

This is taking too long. Given the time, I'll try to outline a possible plan with the necessary steps, even if it's not optimal, but meets all constraints.

Possible plan:

1. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup (makes pos21 not clear, helps constraint8)

2. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft (satisfies constraint10)

3. move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright

4. move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown

5. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright

6. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright

7. move player1 pos42 pos52 dirright (to reach pos52 for constraint3)

8. move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown (satisfies constraint2 and 3)

9. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup

10. move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft

11. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft

12. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown (makes pos33 not clear, satisfying constraint11)

13. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown

14. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

15. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup (now adjacent to stone at pos43)

16. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos44 dirdown (invalid, since stone is at pos43, can't push to pos44)

Wait, this is not working. Let's try pushing from pos43 to pos44:

To push from pos43 to pos44, agent must be at pos44 and push in dirdown.

But how to get to pos44:

From step14, agent is at pos44.

Then, push stone from pos43 to pos44:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos44 dirdown.

But preconditions:

- Agent at pos44 (yes).

- Stone at pos43 (yes).

- pos44 is clear (after agent moved there, no. So invalid.

Another dead end.

This is extremely challenging. I think I need to find a way to push the stone step by step while meeting all constraints. Given the time I've spent, I'll try to propose a plan that moves the stone through pos24 and pos14, with the agent visiting pos11 and pos52.

Here's a tentative plan:

1. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup (satisfies part of constraint8)

2. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft (satisfies constraint10)

3. move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright

4. move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown

5. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright

6. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright

7. move player1 pos42 pos52 dirright (prep for constraint3)

8. move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown (satisfies constraint2 and 3)

9. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup

10. move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft

11. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown (invalid, as pos43 has stone)

Alternative, push stone from pos43 to pos44:

12. move player1 pos42 pos44 dirdown (from pos42 to pos44: possible?)

Looking at allowed moves from pos42: 

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos52 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos41 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown"

So from pos42, moving dirdown (right) to pos43 (column 2 →3). But pos43 is occupied by stone. So can't move there.

Thus, agent can't reach pos44 from pos42 directly. Another path needed.

This is really taking too long. Given the time constraints, I'll propose a plan that may not be optimal but satisfies all constraints, even if it's not the shortest.
