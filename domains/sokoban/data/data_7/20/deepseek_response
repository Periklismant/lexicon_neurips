**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Move to pos55 to satisfy constraint 9:**
   - The agent moves from pos33 → pos34 → pos35 → pos45 → pos55. This ensures that if pos31 becomes non-clear (stone there), the agent was previously at pos55.

2. **Return to pos33:**
   - The agent moves back from pos55 → pos45 → pos35 → pos34 → pos33. This positions the agent to handle the stone.

3. **Navigate to pos12 to push the stone:**
   - The agent moves pos33 → pos23 → pos13 → pos12. This allows pushing the stone from pos22.

4. **Push stone to pos23:**
   - `pushtonongoal` moves the stone from pos22 to pos23. The agent ends at pos22, satisfying the constraint 6 (agent at pos23 later).

5. **Move to pos33 and push stone to pos31:**
   - The agent moves pos22 → pos23 → pos33. Then, `pushtogoal` moves the stone from pos23 to pos31 (goal), satisfying the task.

**Constraints Met:**
- **pos21 always clear:** Never visited.
- **pos23 not clear once:** Stone at pos23 briefly.
- **Agent at pos23:** Achieved during movement.
- **pos31 not clear:** After final push.
- **pos55 visited before pos31 not clear:** Achieved in initial steps.
