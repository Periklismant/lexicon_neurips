Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. First, I need to understand the initial state and the goal. The agent (player1) starts at pos33, and the stone (stone1) is at pos22. The goal is to have stone1 at a goal location. From the initial state, the only goal location mentioned is pos31. All other locations are non-goal except pos31.

So the main objective is to move stone1 to pos31. But wait, let me check the initial state again. The problem says pos31 is a goal location. So the stone needs to be there. However, the path from pos22 to pos31 might be blocked, and I need to consider the constraints.

Now, the constraints are quite a few. Let's list them:

1. Location pos12 being not clear can only be true in at most one continuous sequence. So if pos12 is occupied (by the agent or a stone), it can't happen more than once in separate parts of the plan.

2. pos21 must always be clear. So the agent or stones can never be at pos21.

3. At some point, both pos24 and pos32 must be not clear. But that has to happen in at least one state.

4. The agent can never be at pos21.

5. pos23 can't be not clear in more than one continuous sequence.

6. The agent must be at pos23 in at least one state.

7. If the agent is at pos23 in some state, then either stone1 is at pos13 or pos24 is not clear, either in that state or a later one.

8. pos31 must be not clear in at least one state. But since the stone needs to end up there, maybe pushing it there will satisfy this.

9. If pos31 is not clear (which it will be when the stone is there), then there must be an earlier state where the agent was at pos55.

Additionally, movement actions need to follow the allowed directions. The agent can only move to adjacent locations in the grid as per the given directions.

Let me start by mapping out the grid. The positions are labeled posXY where X is the row and Y the column. So pos11 is top-left, pos55 is bottom-right. The directions are up, down, left, right (dirup, dirdown, dirleft, dirright).

The agent starts at pos33. Stone1 is at pos22. The goal location is pos31. So the stone is at pos22 (which is non-goal), and we need to get it to pos31.

First, how to get the stone from pos22 to pos31. Let's see possible paths. From pos22, moving the stone to pos32 (if possible), then to pos31. Alternatively, pushing it left to pos21, but pos21 must always be clear, so that's not allowed. So pos21 can't be used. So another path: pos22 -> pos23 -> pos33 -> pos34 -> ... but pos33 is the starting position of the agent, but if the agent moves, maybe that's possible. Wait, but pushing stones requires the agent to be adjacent in a direction to the stone.

Let me think: To push a stone from pos22, the agent needs to be in a position adjacent to pos22 in the direction opposite to where the stone is moving. For example, to push the stone from pos22 to pos32 (dirright), the agent needs to be at pos22 and push it right. But wait, the action "pushtogoal" requires that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's current position) in direction d. So for pushing the stone from l_from to l_to, the agent must be at l_p which is in the direction opposite to d from l_from. For example, to push a stone from pos22 to pos32 (dirright), the agent needs to be at pos22's left, which is pos12. But pos12 is clear. Wait, no: the agent needs to be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (pos22) in direction d. Wait, the action's preconditions say that the agent is at l_p, and l_p is connected to l_from via direction d. So direction d is from l_p to l_from. So for example, if the agent is at pos12 and wants to push the stone at pos22, direction d would be dirdown (since from pos12, moving down gets to pos22). Then the stone is pushed from pos22 (l_from) to l_to, which would need to be in direction d from l_from. Wait, the action's direction is the direction from l_p to l_from, and then the direction from l_from to l_to must be the same. So in this case, the agent is at pos12, direction d is dirdown (from pos12 to pos22). Then the stone is pushed in direction d (dirdown) from pos22 to pos32. So the direction for moving the stone is dirdown. So the agent at pos12 can push the stone from pos22 down to pos32. But pos32 must be clear. Let's check the initial state: pos32 is clear. So that's possible. Then, once the stone is at pos32, the next step is to push it to pos31. For that, the agent would need to be at pos32's right (dirleft) to push it left. Wait, no. Let me think again. To push the stone from pos32 to pos31 (dirleft), the agent needs to be at a position from which direction dirleft leads to pos32. So that would be pos33 (since moving left from pos33 leads to pos32? Wait, the allowed moves: looking at the 'You may move from' statements. Let me check pos32's connections. The allowed moves from pos32: You may move from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft), pos42 (dirright), pos31 (dirup), pos33 (dirdown). So to get to pos32 from another location via direction d. So if the agent is at pos32's right (pos42), direction dirleft would go to pos32. But pos42 is clear. Alternatively, to push the stone from pos32 to pos31, direction dirup. So the agent would need to be at pos32's down (pos42?), but no. Wait, the direction for pushing is from l_p (agent's location) to l_from (stone's current position). Then the stone is moved from l_from to l_to in the same direction. So for pushing the stone from pos32 to pos31 (dirup), the agent must be at a position where moving dirup from there leads to pos32. Looking at the allowed moves: From pos32, moving dirup would be to pos31. Wait, the allowed moves include "You may move from location pos32 to location pos31 following direction dirup". So if the agent is at pos32, moving dirup to pos31. But the agent can't be at pos32 while pushing the stone. Wait, the action is "pushtogoal" p s l_p l_from l_to d. So l_p is the agent's current position. So to push the stone from pos32 (l_from) to pos31 (l_to) in direction dirup, the agent must be at l_p which is in direction dirup from l_from. Wait, no: the agent must be at l_p, and the direction from l_p to l_from is d. Then the stone moves from l_from to l_to in direction d. So for example, if the agent is at pos33, and direction is dirup (from pos33 to pos32), that's not possible. Wait, the allowed moves: from pos33, you can move dirup to pos32. So direction d is dirup. So the agent is at pos33 (l_p), pushes the stone from pos32 (l_from) to pos31 (l_to), direction dirup. Let me check if that's allowed. The preconditions for pushtogoal: agent is at l_p (pos33), stone is at l_from (pos32), l_to (pos31) is clear, the direction from l_p to l_from is d (dirup), and from l_from to l_to is d (dirup). Also, l_to must be a goal location. pos31 is a goal location. So yes. So after moving the stone to pos32, the agent can push it to pos31 from pos33.

But how does the agent get to pos33 after moving the stone to pos32? Wait, the agent's initial position is pos33. Wait, the initial state says player1 is at pos33, and stone1 is at pos22. So the agent starts at pos33. So first, the agent needs to move to a position where it can push the stone from pos22. To push the stone from pos22 to pos32, the agent needs to be at pos12 (since from pos12, moving down (dirdown) to pos22). So agent moves from pos33 to pos23, then to pos22? Wait, but pos22 is where the stone is. Wait, but the agent can't be at the same position as the stone. The initial state says pos22 is clear, but the stone is there. Wait, no: in the original state, "stone1 is at location pos22" and "Location pos22 is clear". Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, no. The "clear" condition refers to whether a location is occupied by the agent or a stone. Wait, no. Let me check the original state again. The original state lists:

- player1 is at pos33.

- stone1 is at pos22.

- Then, under "Location pos22 is clear": that's part of the original state. Wait, that's a problem. If stone1 is at pos22, then pos22 should not be clear. But according to the original state, "Location pos22 is clear" is listed. That's a contradiction. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check again.

Original state:

The original state includes:

"stone1 is at location pos22"

"Location pos22 is clear"

But if a stone is at pos22, then pos22 is not clear. So this must be a mistake in the problem statement. But perhaps I'm misunderstanding the definition. Wait, the problem says "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So each location can have at most one object (agent or stone) or be empty. So if a stone is at pos22, then pos22 is not clear. So in the initial state, the user says "Location pos22 is clear", but also "stone1 is at location pos22". That's conflicting. But perhaps it's an error in the problem. Alternatively, maybe "clear" refers to the presence of the agent. Wait, the preconditions for "move" require that the destination location is clear. So "clear" probably means that neither the agent nor a stone is present. Therefore, in the original state, if the stone is at pos22, then pos22 is not clear. But according to the original state, "Location pos22 is clear" is listed. That's contradictory. This suggests that there's an error in the problem setup. However, since I have to work with the given information, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that in the initial state, pos22 is not clear (since the stone is there). But according to the problem's original state, it's listed as clear. This is confusing. Wait, maybe the problem has a typo, but let's check again.

Looking back:

Original state includes:

"player1 is at location pos33"

"stone1 is at location pos22"

Then, under the clear locations:

"Location pos22 is clear"

But if pos22 has the stone, it can't be clear. Therefore, this must be a mistake. However, since the problem is given as such, perhaps "clear" refers to being free of the agent. But that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the problem has a mistake, but I have to proceed with the given data. Wait, maybe the "clear" in the initial state refers to the agent not being there. For example, a location is clear if the agent is not present, but stones can be present. But that would contradict the action preconditions. For example, the "move" action requires the destination to be clear, but if a stone is there, it's not clear. So perhaps there's a mistake here. But given that the problem states that pos22 is clear in the initial state, but the stone is there, this is conflicting. This might be a critical error. However, since the user provided this, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that "clear" refers to the agent not being present, and stones are allowed. But that's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's initial state is correct, and there's a misunderstanding in the definitions. Let me check the problem's action effects. For example, when you move, the effect is that the agent leaves the from location and the to location is no longer clear. So "clear" refers to the agent's presence. But then stones being present would not affect the "clear" status. But that's not how it's usually defined. Alternatively, perhaps "clear" means that the location is free of both agent and stones. If that's the case, then the initial state is invalid because pos22 has a stone but is marked as clear. But the problem says it's part of the original state, so perhaps there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the "clear" in the problem's original state refers to the agent's presence. So in the original state, pos22 is clear (agent not there), but the stone is there. So when moving, the destination must be clear (agent not there), but stones are allowed. That would make sense. So in that case, a location is clear if the agent is not there, regardless of stones. Then, when moving, the agent can move to a location with a stone? That can't be, because moving would require the destination to be clear (i.e., no agent or stone). Hmm, this is confusing. Let me check the action preconditions again.

For the "move" action, the preconditions are: (i) agent is at l_from, (ii) l_to is clear, (iii) can move from l_from to l_to via direction d. So if "clear" means that neither agent nor stone is present, then moving to a location with a stone is impossible. But if "clear" only refers to the agent's presence, then moving to a location with a stone is possible. But according to the problem's original state, pos22 has a stone but is clear, implying that "clear" refers to the agent's presence. Therefore, the stone's presence doesn't affect the "clear" status. That's possible. So the "clear" in the problem refers to the agent not being present, regardless of stones. So in that case, when moving, the agent can move to a location that has a stone as long as the agent isn't there. But that seems odd. But given the problem's initial state, that must be the case. Therefore, in the original state, pos22 has a stone but is clear (because the agent isn't there). So when the agent moves to pos22, it's possible if the location is clear (no agent), even if there's a stone. But then, how does pushing work? Because pushing requires that the stone is at l_from, and the agent can push it. So in the initial state, the agent is at pos33. The stone is at pos22. The agent needs to get to a position adjacent to pos22 in a direction to push it. So possible directions: from pos12 (down to pos22), pos21 (right to pos22), pos23 (up to pos22?), wait, no. Let's check the allowed moves.

Looking at the allowed moves for pos22:

"You may move from location pos22 to pos12 (dirleft), pos32 (dirright), pos21 (dirup), pos23 (dirdown)."

So directions from pos22 are dirleft (to pos12), dirright (to pos32), dirup (to pos21), dirdown (to pos23). So for the agent to push the stone from pos22, the agent needs to be in a position adjacent to pos22 in a certain direction. For example, if the agent is at pos12, moving down to pos22 (direction dirdown). Then, pushing the stone from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown) would require the agent to be at pos22, but that's the stone's location. Wait, no. The agent can't be at the stone's location. So the agent must be at an adjacent position. Let me think again. The "pushtogoal" action's preconditions require that the agent is at l_p, which is connected to l_from (stone's current position) via direction d. So for example, if the agent is at pos12, and direction d is dirdown (since from pos12 to pos22 is dirdown), then the agent can push the stone from pos22 (l_from) to l_to (pos32 if direction is dirright? Wait, no. Wait, the direction d is from l_p to l_from. Then, the stone is pushed from l_from to l_to in the same direction d. So if the agent is at pos12 (l_p), direction d is dirdown (from pos12 to pos22), then the stone is pushed from l_from (pos22) to l_to (pos22 + direction d = pos22 down, which is pos23). So in this case, pushing from pos22 to pos23, direction dirdown. But pos23 must be a goal location. But pos23 is not a goal. So pushtonongoal would be needed. However, our goal is to get the stone to pos31, which is a goal location. So perhaps pushing the stone down to pos23 is not helpful. Alternatively, pushing the stone right from pos22 to pos32. For that, the agent needs to be at a position from which direction dirright leads to pos22. Looking at the allowed moves: which positions can reach pos22 via dirright? For example, pos21 can move dirright to pos22. So if the agent is at pos21, direction dirright would lead to pos22. Then, pushing the stone from pos22 to pos32 (dirright). But wait, pos21 must always be clear (constraint 2), so the agent cannot be at pos21. So that's not allowed. Therefore, the agent can't use pos21 as a position to push from. So alternative options: pushing the stone from pos22 to pos32 requires the agent to be at pos22's left (dirright direction from l_p to l_from). So the agent would be at pos22's left, which is pos12. Wait, pos12 is at the same row? Wait, pos22 is row 2, column 2. pos12 is row 1, column 2. So moving down from pos12 to pos22 is dirdown. So the agent is at pos12, direction dirdown to pos22. Then, pushing the stone in direction dirdown would move it to pos23. But pos23 is a non-goal location. But the goal is to get the stone to pos31. Alternatively, pushing the stone from pos22 to pos32 (dirright). To do that, the agent needs to be at a position from which direction dirright leads to pos22. Which positions can do that? For example, pos21: moving dirright to pos22. But pos21 is off-limits because of constraint 2 (must always be clear). So the agent can't be there. Another option: pos12 to pos22 via dirdown, then push the stone in dirright. Wait, but direction must be the same. Wait, the direction from l_p to l_from is d, and the direction from l_from to l_to is also d. So if the agent is at pos12, direction d is dirdown (to pos22), then the stone is pushed in direction dirdown to pos23. To push the stone to pos32 (dirright), the agent must approach from the left. So the agent must be at pos22's left, which is pos21 (but can't be there) or pos12 (but from pos12, direction is dirdown to pos22, then pushing in dirdown to pos23. So not helpful. Hmm. Alternatively, can the agent push the stone upwards? From pos22 to pos21, but pos21 must remain clear. So that's impossible. So the only possible directions to push the stone from pos22 are down (to pos23) or right (to pos32) or left (to pos12) or up (to pos21). But up and left are problematic. Left would push the stone to pos12 (non-goal), and up is pos21 which must stay clear. So the only options are down to pos23 or right to pos32. Let's consider pushing it to pos32. To do that, the agent needs to approach from the left (pos22's left is pos21, which is forbidden), or from above? Wait, pos22's left is pos21 (column 1), but pos21 is row 2, column 1. No, pos22 is row 2, column 2. So pos22's left (dirleft) is pos21 (row 2, column 1). But the agent can't be at pos21. So the only way to push the stone right (dirright) to pos32 is if the agent is at pos22's left (pos21), which is forbidden. Therefore, this path is impossible. So the agent must push the stone down to pos23. But pos23 is not a goal. Then, from pos23, the agent can push it further. Let's consider that path.

But first, the agent is at pos33. To get to pos12, they need to move through several positions. Let's see the path from pos33 to pos12. pos33 can move up to pos32 (dirup), then pos32 can move up to pos31 (dirup), but pos31 is a goal location. Then from pos31, the agent can move left to pos21 (but forbidden), or right to pos41. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, from pos33, move left to pos23 (dirleft), then up to pos22 (dirup?), but pos22 has the stone. Wait, movement is allowed only along specified directions. Let me check the allowed moves from pos33:

"You may move from location pos33 to pos23 (dirleft), pos43 (dirright), pos32 (dirup), pos34 (dirdown)."

So from pos33, the agent can move dirleft to pos23. Then from pos23, allowed moves are to pos13 (dirleft), pos33 (dirright), pos22 (dirup), pos24 (dirdown). So from pos23, the agent can move dirup to pos22, but pos22 has the stone, and pos22 is clear (according to initial state, which might be a mistake). But if pos22 is clear (agent not there), then the agent can move there. Wait, but the stone is there. If "clear" only refers to the agent's presence, then moving to pos22 is allowed. But then, when the agent moves to pos22, the stone is there, but according to the problem's setup, that's allowed. But that would mean the agent and stone are at the same location, which isn't possible. This is conflicting. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's initial state. Given the confusion, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the "Location pos22 is clear" in the initial state and proceed under the assumption that the stone is at pos22, making it not clear. But this is getting too tangled. Let's proceed under the assumption that the stone's presence makes the location not clear, so the initial state's mention of pos22 being clear is incorrect. Therefore, the stone is at pos22, making pos22 not clear. Therefore, the agent cannot move to pos22. So the agent must find another path.

So the agent starts at pos33. To push the stone at pos22, the agent needs to be at a position adjacent to pos22. The allowed adjacent positions are pos12 (up), pos21 (left), pos23 (down), pos32 (right). But pos21 is forbidden (constraint 4: agent can't be there), so the agent can't approach from pos21. pos32 is to the right of pos22. To get to pos32, the agent can move from pos33 to pos32 (dirup). Then, from pos32, the agent can push the stone to pos31 (dirup), since pos31 is a goal. But wait, the stone is at pos22. How to get it to pos31? Let's think.

Wait, if the agent is at pos32 (right of pos22), then to push the stone to pos32's direction, the agent would need to be in a position that allows pushing. For example, if the agent is at pos32 and wants to push the stone from pos22 to pos32, that's not possible because the stone is at pos22, and the agent is at pos32. The agent can't push the stone from pos22 unless they are adjacent in the direction. Wait, to push the stone from pos22 to pos32 (dirright), the agent must be at pos22's left (pos21) or another direction. But pos21 is forbidden. So this is not possible. Therefore, the agent needs to find another path.

Alternative approach: The agent moves from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft), then to pos13 (dirleft), then to pos12 (dirup?), but let's check the allowed moves. From pos33, moving dirleft to pos23. From pos23, moving dirleft to pos13. From pos13, moving dirup to pos12. Now, the agent is at pos12. From pos12, the agent can push the stone at pos22 down to pos23 (dirdown). So action pushtonongoal, since pos23 is not a goal. Then, the stone is at pos23. Now, the agent is at pos22 after pushing, but pos23 is not a goal. Then, the agent needs to push the stone further. From pos23, the agent can push the stone to pos33 (dirright) if possible. But pos33 is initially clear. Wait, the agent's initial position is pos33, but after moving, it's no longer there. So after the first move, pos33 is clear.

But after pushing the stone from pos22 to pos23, the agent ends up at pos22. Then, the agent can move to pos23 (dirdown from pos22), but pos23 now has the stone. So the agent can't move there. Wait, after pushing, the agent moves to pos22's location? No, the effect of pushtonongoal is that the agent is at l_from (pos22) after pushing. Wait, no: looking at the effects of pushtonongoal:

Effects of pushtonongoal:

(i) agent p is no longer at l_p (pos12 in this case).

(ii) stone s is no longer at l_from (pos22).

(iii) l_to (pos23) is no longer clear.

(iv) agent p is at l_from (pos22).

(v) stone s is at l_to (pos23).

(vi) l_p (pos12) is clear.

(vii) stone s is at a non-goal state.

So after pushing, the agent is at pos22. But pos22 was the stone's original location, which is now clear (since the stone is moved to pos23). Wait, but the agent is now at pos22, so pos22 is not clear. But according to constraint 2, pos21 must remain clear. Also, after this action, the stone is at pos23, which is not a goal. So we need to get it to pos31.

But the agent is now at pos22. However, pos22 is not a goal, and the stone is at pos23. The next step would be to push the stone from pos23 to pos33. To do that, the agent needs to be at a position adjacent to pos23 in a direction. For example, from pos13 (up), pos22 (dirup), pos24 (down), or pos33 (right). The agent is currently at pos22. From pos22, they can move down to pos23 (dirdown), but pos23 has the stone. So the agent can't move there. Therefore, the agent needs to move around.

From pos22, the agent can move up to pos12 (dirup), but that's possible. Then, from pos12, move to pos13 (dirdown), then to pos23 (dirright). Wait, no. Let's see allowed moves. From pos22, moving dirup to pos12 is allowed (if pos12 is clear). After pushing the stone to pos23, the agent is at pos22. Then, the agent can move to pos23 (dirdown) only if pos23 is clear. But pos23 now has the stone, so it's not clear. Therefore, the agent cannot move there. So the agent is stuck at pos22 unless they move elsewhere. But pos22's other exits: pos22 can move dirleft to pos12, dirright to pos32, dirup to pos21 (forbidden), or dirdown to pos23 (occupied by stone). So the agent can move to pos12 or pos32. Let's say the agent moves to pos32. Then, from pos32, they can move to pos31 (dirup), pos42 (dirright), pos33 (dirdown), etc. But how does this help in pushing the stone from pos23 to pos33.

Alternatively, after the first push to pos23, the agent is at pos22. Then, they move to pos32 (dirright). From pos32, the agent can move to pos33 (dirdown). Now, the agent is at pos33. The stone is at pos23. To push it further, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos23 in a direction. For example, from pos33, moving dirleft to pos23. Then, the agent is at pos23 (but the stone is there, which is not allowed). So this is impossible. Therefore, the agent needs to find another path.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos23, the agent is at pos22. The agent moves to pos12 (dirup), then to pos13 (dirdown), then to pos23 (dirright). But pos23 has the stone, so the agent can't move there. So this is not possible. Therefore, the initial approach of pushing the stone to pos23 may not be helpful. Maybe another path is needed.

Alternative plan: The agent needs to reach pos55 at some point to satisfy constraint 9. Because constraint 9 says that if pos31 is not clear (which will be the case when the stone is there), then the agent must have been at pos55 in an earlier state. So we need to include a step where the agent moves to pos55 before moving the stone to pos31.

So the steps would be:

1. Move agent from pos33 to pos55 (this path may be long).

2. Then move back to a position to push the stone to pos31.

But how to reach pos55 from pos33. Let's map the path. pos33 is row3, column3. pos55 is row5, column5.

Possible path: pos33 → pos34 (dirdown) → pos35 (dirdown) → pos45 (dirright?) → pos55. Let's check allowed moves.

From pos33, can move dirdown to pos34.

From pos34, dirdown to pos35.

From pos35, dirright to pos45 (no, dirright from pos35 is to pos45? Wait, pos35 is row3, column5. Moving dirright would be to column6, which doesn't exist. Wait, the grid is 5x5. So pos35 is row3, column5. dirright would be to pos36, which doesn't exist. So allowed moves from pos35: "You may move from location pos35 to pos25 (dirleft), pos45 (dirright), pos34 (dirup), pos35 can't move right beyond pos45. Wait, the allowed moves for pos35 are:

"You may move from pos35 to pos25 (dirleft), pos45 (dirright), pos34 (dirup)."

So from pos35, dirright to pos45.

From pos45, dirright to pos55.

Yes. So path from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown), pos34 to pos35 (dirdown), pos35 to pos45 (dirright), pos45 to pos55 (dirright). So that's four moves. Then, after reaching pos55, the agent needs to move back to push the stone.

But this is a long detour, and the constraints must be satisfied. Also, constraint 8 requires that pos31 is not clear in at least one state. That will happen when the stone is there. Constraint 9 requires that before pos31 is not clear, the agent was at pos55. So the agent must visit pos55 before pushing the stone to pos31.

So the plan must include:

- Agent moves to pos55.

- Then, pushes the stone to pos31.

But how to get the stone to pos31 after that.

But the stone is initially at pos22. So the steps would be:

1. Move agent from pos33 to pos55 (several moves).

2. Then, move back to a position to push the stone to pos31.

But this seems very long. Let's think of the minimal path. Also, we need to satisfy other constraints, like the agent must be at pos23 at least once, and when the agent is at pos23, either stone1 is at pos13 or pos24 is not clear at some point.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can first push the stone to pos31, but then constraint 9 requires that the agent was at pos55 before. So the agent must first go to pos55, then come back and push the stone to pos31. But that's a lot of steps.

But let's see: The shortest possible plan would involve the agent moving to pos55, then moving back to push the stone to pos31. But how to push the stone from pos22 to pos31. Let's see.

Alternative idea: Push the stone from pos22 to pos32 (dirright), then to pos31 (dirup). To push from pos22 to pos32, the agent must be at pos22's left (pos21, which is forbidden) or perhaps another direction. Wait, to push the stone right to pos32, the agent needs to be at a position from which direction dirright leads to pos22. The only such position is pos21 (since pos21 dirright leads to pos22). But pos21 is off-limits. Therefore, this path is impossible. Therefore, the only way is to push the stone down to pos23, then right to pos33, then up to pos32, etc. But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the stone from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown), then from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown), then to pos34 (dirright), then to pos44 (dirright), etc., but that seems even longer.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos23, the agent can push it to pos33 (dirright), then to pos34 (dirdown), then to pos44 (dirright), but that's not helpful. Wait, the goal is to get to pos31. So perhaps after pos23, the agent pushes the stone to pos33 (dirright), then to pos34 (dirdown), then to pos44 (dirright), but this is not leading towards pos31. This seems incorrect.

This is getting quite complicated. Let's try to outline the steps considering all constraints:

1. The agent must visit pos23 at least once (constraint 6). When they do, they must ensure that either stone1 is at pos13 or pos24 is not clear at some point.

2. pos24 and pos32 must be not clear in at least one state (constraint 3).

3. pos31 must be not clear in at least one state (which will be when the stone is there), but the agent must have been at pos55 before that.

4. The agent can't be at pos21 ever.

5. pos21 must always be clear.

6. pos12 can't be not clear more than once consecutively.

7. pos23 can't be not clear more than once consecutively.

So, considering all this, perhaps the optimal plan is:

- Agent moves from pos33 to pos55 (to satisfy constraint 9).

- Then, agent moves back to pos33, pos34, etc., to push the stone.

But this is a lot of steps. Let's try to draft the plan.

First, moving to pos55:

move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown

move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown

move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright

move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright

Now, agent is at pos55. This satisfies that they were there, which is needed for constraint 9.

Then, agent needs to return to push the stone to pos31.

But the stone is at pos22. So agent needs to move from pos55 to pos22's vicinity.

But this will take many steps. Alternative idea: perhaps after visiting pos55, the agent can push the stone to pos31 via a series of moves.

But how? Let's see.

After pos55, agent needs to move back. For example, move left to pos54, then up to pos44, then left to pos43, etc.

But this would take a lot of steps. However, we need to find the optimal (shortest) plan.

Alternative approach: Find a way to push the stone to pos31 with the agent visiting pos55 first.

But perhaps there's a shorter path. For example, agent moves to pos55 quickly, then returns to push the stone.

But let's count the steps.

Steps to reach pos55 from pos33:

pos33 → pos34 (dirdown)

pos34 → pos35 (dirdown)

pos35 → pos45 (dirright)

pos45 → pos55 (dirright)

4 moves.

Then, returning to pos31 area:

pos55 → pos54 (dirup)

pos54 → pos44 (dirleft)

pos44 → pos34 (dirleft)

pos34 → pos33 (dirup)

pos33 → pos32 (dirup)

pos32 → pos31 (dirup)

Now agent is at pos31. But the stone is at pos22. The agent needs to get to pos32 to push the stone from pos22 to pos32, but as discussed earlier, that's not possible due to pos21 being blocked.

Alternatively, after returning, the agent can push the stone from pos22 to pos23, then to pos33, etc.

But this is getting too long. Let's think of another approach.

Wait, maybe the agent can push the stone to pos31 directly from pos32. For that, the agent needs to be at pos32's down (pos42) to push it up. Wait, no. To push the stone from pos32 to pos31 (dirup), the agent must be at pos32's down (pos42), but then direction d would be dirup from pos42 to pos32. Then, pushing the stone dirup to pos31. But pos42 to pos32 is dirup. So agent at pos42 can push the stone from pos32 to pos31. But how to get the stone to pos32.

But the stone starts at pos22. To get it to pos32, the agent needs to push it right from pos22. But as before, that's only possible if the agent is at pos21, which is forbidden. So this is not possible.

Alternative idea: Use pos23 as an intermediate step. Push the stone down to pos23, then right to pos33, then up to pos32, then left to pos31. But pos33 is a non-goal location. However, pos31 is the goal.

So steps:

1. Agent moves from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft).

2. Then, pushes the stone from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown). This requires the agent to be at pos13 (dirdown to pos22), but wait, how? Agent is at pos23 after step 1. To push the stone from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown), the agent must be at pos22's up (pos12) and move down. So agent needs to move from pos23 to pos22 (dirup), but pos22 is occupied by the stone. So this is not possible.

Alternatively, after step 1, the agent is at pos23. To push the stone from pos22 to pos23, the agent needs to be at pos22's up (pos12) and push down. So agent needs to move to pos12. From pos23, move to pos13 (dirleft), then to pos12 (dirup). Then, push the stone down to pos23. But this would involve several steps.

Let's outline:

1. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft.

Now at pos23.

2. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft.

At pos13.

3. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup.

At pos12.

4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos23 dirdown.

This action pushes the stone from pos22 to pos23. Now, the stone is at pos23, which is non-goal. The agent is now at pos22.

But pos22 is clear after this action (since the stone is moved to pos23, and the agent is now at pos22). But wait, after pushtonongoal, the agent is at pos22, which was the stone's original location. So pos22 is now occupied by the agent.

But pos22 was originally clear (according to problem's initial state, but that's conflicting). Assuming pos22 is not clear after this action.

Now, agent is at pos22. But this violates constraint 4? No, constraint 4 says the agent can't be at pos21. pos22 is allowed.

But after pushing, the stone is at pos23. Now, the agent is at pos22.

Next steps: push the stone from pos23 to pos33.

To do that, the agent needs to move to a position adjacent to pos23. For example, from pos22, move down to pos23 (dirdown), but pos23 has the stone. So agent can't move there. So agent must move elsewhere.

From pos22, the agent can move to pos12 (dirup), pos32 (dirright), or pos21 (forbidden).

Let's choose pos32:

5. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright.

Now at pos32.

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos23 pos33 dirdown.

This requires that the agent is at pos32 (l_p), stone is at pos23 (l_from), pos33 (l_to) is clear. pos33 is initially clear (after agent moved away in step 1). So this is possible. After this action, the agent is at pos23, the stone is at pos33.

But pos33 is not a goal. Now, the agent is at pos23, which satisfies constraint 6. However, constraint 7 requires that if the agent is at pos23, then either stone1 is at pos13 or pos24 is not clear at some state. In this case, after this push, stone1 is at pos33, not pos13. So we need to ensure that pos24 is not clear at some point.

But this may require additional steps. For example, pushing another stone to pos24, but there's only one stone. So this might not be possible. Therefore, this approach may violate constraint 7.

Alternatively, when the agent is at pos23 (step 6's effect), we need to make sure that pos24 is not clear either now or in the future. Since there's only one stone, the only way pos24 is not clear is if the stone is there or the agent is there. But the stone is at pos33, and the agent is at pos23. So pos24 is clear. Therefore, this plan would violate constraint 7 unless we take additional steps.

This is getting too complicated. Let's try to find a different path that satisfies all constraints.

Another approach: Use the requirement that pos24 and pos32 must be not clear in at least one state (constraint 3). Since there's only one stone, we can only have one of them not clear unless the agent is at the other. But the agent can be at pos32, making it not clear, and the stone can be at pos24. But how?

Alternatively, when pushing the stone to pos24, but that's a non-goal location. Let's see:

If the agent pushes the stone from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown), then from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown), then from pos24 to pos34 (dirright). But pos34 is not a goal. Then, from pos34 to pos44 (dirright), etc. But this doesn't help in reaching pos31.

But this would make pos24 not clear (stone at pos24) and pos32 not clear (agent at pos32) at some point, satisfying constraint 3.

But this is a long path. Let's outline:

1. Agent moves to pos12 (via pos33 → pos23 → pos13 → pos12).

2. Push stone from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown).

3. Agent moves to pos23 → pos24.

4. Push stone from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown).

5. Agent moves to pos32.

Now, pos24 has the stone (not clear), and pos32 has the agent (not clear). This satisfies constraint 3.

Then, continue pushing the stone to pos34, etc. But the goal is to get the stone to pos31.

This is getting too long. Given the time constraints, perhaps the optimal plan is as follows, considering all constraints and the need to visit pos55 before pos31 is filled:

1. Move agent to pos55 to satisfy constraint 9.

2. Return to pos33.

3. Push the stone from pos22 to pos32 (requires agent to be at pos22's left, but impossible due to pos21 being forbidden. So this is not possible. Hence, must find another way).

Alternative plan:

- Agent moves to pos55 (4 moves).

- Agent moves back to pos33 (4 moves).

- Agent moves to pos32 (dirup from pos33).

- Agent pushes stone from pos22 to pos32 (dirright). But this requires agent to be at pos21 (forbidden) or pos12 (requires agent to be at pos12 and direction dirdown to pos22, then push dirright to pos32). Wait, no. The direction must be the same for l_p to l_from and l_from to l_to. So if agent is at pos12 (l_p), direction dirdown to pos22 (l_from), then pushing the stone in direction dirdown to pos23. To push to pos32, the direction would have to be dirright, but that's not possible from pos12 to pos22. So this is impossible.

Therefore, perhaps the only way is to push the stone down to pos23, then right to pos33, then up to pos32, then left to pos31.

But how:

Steps:

1. Agent moves from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft).

2. Agent pushes stone from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown). But how? Agent must be at pos12 to push down.

So steps:

1. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft.

2. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft.

3. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup.

4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos23 dirdown.

Now, stone is at pos23, agent is at pos22.

5. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright.

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos23 pos33 dirdown.

Stone is at pos33, agent is at pos23.

This satisfies constraint 6 (agent is at pos23). Now, we need to ensure that either stone1 is at pos13 or pos24 is not clear. Stone is at pos33, so we need pos24 to be not clear. How? Maybe push the stone to pos24.

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos34 dirdown.

Stone is at pos34, agent is at pos33.

8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos44 dirdown.

Stone is at pos44, agent is at pos34.

9. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirdown.

10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos44 pos54 dirdown. Wait, this doesn't make sense. This approach is not leading towards pos31.

This is clearly not the optimal path. Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I think the optimal plan involves the agent visiting pos55 early on, then pushing the stone to pos31 via a specific route. Here's a possible plan:

1. Move agent from pos33 to pos55 (4 moves).

2. Move agent back to pos31 area.

3. Push stone from pos22 to pos31 via intermediate steps.

But I'm struggling to find the exact steps. Given the time, I'll propose a plan that meets all constraints, even if it's not the shortest possible. However, the problem requires an optimal plan, so I must ensure it's the shortest.

Alternative Idea:

Let's use the fact that pos31 must be not clear (stone there), and the agent must have been at pos55 before. So the agent first goes to pos55, then pushes the stone to pos31.

But how to get the stone to pos31.

Steps:

1. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown

2. move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown

3. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright

4. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright (now at pos55)

5. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft

6. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft

7. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup

8. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup

9. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup

10. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup (agent at pos31)

Now, agent is at pos31, which is a goal location. But the stone is at pos22. The agent needs to push it to pos31. But how?

Agent is at pos31. To push the stone from pos22 to pos31, the agent needs to be at a position adjacent to pos22 in a direction that allows pushing towards pos31. For example, pos22 to pos31 is dirup. So the agent must be at pos22's down (pos32) to push it up. But pos32 is clear. So:

11. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown

12. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos31 dirup

This action's preconditions: agent at pos32, stone at pos22, pos31 is clear, direction from pos32 to pos22 is dirup (since pos32 to pos22 is dirup?), wait, pos32 is row3, column2. pos22 is row2, column2. So moving up from pos32 to pos22 is dirup. Then, pushing the stone from pos22 to pos31 (dirup). pos31 is a goal.

So this action would work if pos31 is clear. After step 10, the agent is at pos31. Step 11 moves to pos32. Then, pos31 is clear again. So step 12 is possible.

But after step 12, the stone is at pos31, which is the goal. This satisfies the task. Now, check constraints:

- pos12 must not be not clear more than once. In this plan, pos12 is clear throughout.

- pos21 must always be clear. Check steps: agent never goes there.

- pos24 and pos32 must be not clear at least once. pos32 is not clear when agent is there (steps 11 and 12). pos24 remains clear. So this violates constraint 3. Therefore, this plan is invalid.

So another approach is needed to satisfy constraint 3.

Perhaps during the steps, the agent must make pos24 not clear. Since there's only one stone, the only way is to push the stone to pos24. But that's a non-goal location. So steps:

Push the stone from pos22 to pos23, then to pos24, then to pos34, etc., but this adds steps. But we need to satisfy constraint 3 (pos24 and pos32 not clear).

Alternatively, have the agent at pos32 and the stone at pos24. But how?

This is getting too complicated. Given time constraints, I'll provide the best plan I can devise, ensuring all constraints are met.
