Alright, this is a sokoban-like puzzle. I need to manipulate the agent to push the stone to the goal position, which is at pos55.

Let's analyze the initial state:
- The agent (player1) is at pos45.
- There's a stone (stone1) at pos34.
- The goal location is at pos55.

And I have several constraints to satisfy:

1. Location pos24 must not be clear at some point, and before that, pos34 must not be clear.
2. Location pos25 can only be not clear in a single continuous sequence of states.
3. Location pos44 can only be not clear in a single continuous sequence of states.
4. Location pos43 must not be clear at some point, and before that, stone1 should be at pos42 or pos13 should not be clear.
5. Player1 cannot be at pos44 at any point.
6. Location pos55 must not be clear at some point, and after that, pos11 should not be clear.
7. Player1 must be at pos34 at some point, and after that, pos35 should not be clear.

Let me think step by step:

First, I need to get the agent to the stone at pos34. The agent is at pos45, so I need to move left to pos35, then up to pos34.
- `move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft`
- `move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup`

Now, constraint 7 is satisfied: player1 is at pos34. Now, I need to make pos35 not clear, this can be satisfied by pushing the stone from pos34 to pos35:
- `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos34 pos35 dirdown`

Now the stone is at pos35, and player1 is at pos34. I need a strategy to push the stone to pos55 (the goal location). Moreover, I need to satisfy other constraints like making pos43 not clear, pos24 not clear (and before that, pos34 not clear), etc.

Let's think about a path to get the stone from pos35 to pos55:
1. From pos35, I could push the stone right to pos45.
2. From pos45, I could push the stone right to pos55, which is the goal.

But I also have to satisfy other constraints. Let's check if this path satisfies other constraints:

- For constraint 1: I need to make pos24 not clear, and before that, pos34 should not be clear. The initial state already satisfies that pos34 is not clear because the stone is there. I need to plan a path that traverses pos24 with the stone.
- For constraint 4: I need to make pos43 not clear, and before that, stone1 should be at pos42 or pos13 should not be clear. I might need to detour to make this happen.

Let me rethink:

I've already moved player1 to pos34 and pushed the stone to pos35. Now, I need to get the player behind the stone to push it further. I'll move player to pos25, then pos35, then push the stone to pos45, and then to pos55.

Actually, I could start by pushing the stone to pos44, then to pos43, and so on, to satisfy constraint 4.

Let's formulate a plan:

From the current state (player1 at pos34, stone1 at pos35):
1. I need to move to pos25 to get behind the stone at pos35.
   - `move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown`

2. Now I can push the stone from pos35 to pos45.
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos35 pos45 dirright`

3. The stone is at pos45, player1 is at pos35. Let's move player1 to pos55 and push the stone to the goal.
   - `move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright`
   - `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos45 pos55 dirright`

Wait, this plan doesn't satisfy all constraints.

Let's check a different approach:

From the current state (player1 at pos34, stone1 at pos35):
1. I'll move player1 to pos25, then to pos35, and push the stone to pos34.
   - `move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown`
   - `move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright`
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos35 pos34 dirup`

2. Now, player1 is at pos35, stone1 is at pos34. I'll move to pos33 to push the stone to pos43.
   - `move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup`
   - `move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup`
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos43 dirright`

3. Now, player1 is at pos34, stone1 is at pos43. This has satisfied constraint 4.

4. Let's continue the plan to move the stone to the goal:
   - `move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup`
   - `move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright`
   - `move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown`
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup`

5. Now, player1 is at pos43, stone1 is at pos42.
   - `move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup`
   - `move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup`
   - `move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown`
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos52 dirright`

6. Player1 is at pos42, stone1 is at pos52.
   - `move player1 pos42 pos52 dirright`
   - `move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown`
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos52 pos51 dirup`

7. Player1 is at pos52, stone1 is at pos51.
   - `move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup`
   - `move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft`
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos51 pos41 dirleft`

8. Player1 is at pos51, stone1 is at pos41.
   - `move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown`
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos41 pos31 dirleft`

9. Player1 is at pos41, stone1 is at pos31.
   - `move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown`
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos31 pos21 dirleft`

10. Player1 is at pos31, stone1 is at pos21.
    - `move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft`
    - `move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown`
    - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos21 pos11 dirleft`

11. Player1 is at pos21, stone1 is at pos11.
    - Actually, I've satisfied constraint 6: pos55 is not clear at some point (because the stone will be at the goal) and after that, pos11 is not clear (because the stone is at pos11).

Wait, I've misinterpreted constraint 6. It says "If pos55 is not clear at some state, then pos11 should not be clear at that state or some state after it." This is different from what I said above.

Let me rethink my plan:

Ok, I think I need to be more methodical about this. Let's see if I can map out a plan that satisfies all the constraints.

Constraint 1: "Location pos24 must not be clear at some point, and before that, pos34 must not be clear."
- This means I need to move the stone from pos34 to pos24 at some point. The initial state already has the stone at pos34, so that part is satisfied.

Constraint 2: "Location pos25 can only be not clear in a single continuous sequence of states."
- This means if the stone is at pos25, I can't later bring it back to pos25.

Constraint 3: "Location pos44 can only be not clear in a single continuous sequence of states."
- Similar to constraint 2, if the stone is at pos44, I can't later bring it back to pos44.

Constraint 4: "Location pos43 must not be clear at some point, and before that, stone1 should be at pos42 or pos13 should not be clear."
- I need to move the stone to pos43 at some point, and before that, I need to have stone1 at pos42 or something at pos13.

Constraint 5: "player1 cannot be at pos44 at any point."
- This means I can't move the player to pos44. This is a key constraint, as it restricts my movement.

Constraint 6: "Location pos55 must not be clear at some point, and after that, pos11 should not be clear."
- This means after the stone reaches the goal (pos55), I need to make pos11 not clear, which might be by placing the player there.

Constraint 7: "player1 must be at pos34 at some point, and after that, pos35 should not be clear."
- This means I need to move the player to pos34, and then make pos35 not clear, which I can do by pushing the stone from pos34 to pos35.

Let's revisit the initial state:
- The agent (player1) is at pos45.
- There's a stone (stone1) at pos34.
- The goal location is at pos55.

Here's a new plan: initial state -> reach pos55 (the goal):

1. Move player1 from pos45 to pos44 to pos34:
   - `move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup`
   - `move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft`

2. Now, player1 is at pos34 and stone1 is at pos34. This doesn't make sense. Let me recheck the initial state:
   Oh, I missed something. If stone1 is at pos34, then pos34 is not clear in the initial state. Let's recheck the state.

From the constraints, it seems that stone1 is at pos34 and player1 is at pos45. 

Let's continue. For constraint 7, I need to move player1 to pos34 and then make pos35 not clear. I can move player1 from pos45 to pos35 to pos34, and then I need to move the stone from pos34 to pos35.

Wait, I can't move the player to a position with a stone. I need to re-read the action descriptions more carefully:

For the "move" action: the agent moves from one position to another if there's a clear path.
For "pushtogoal" and "pushtonongoal" actions: the agent pushes a stone from one position to another if they're in the right positions.

Let's carefully rethink this:

From the initial state:
- player1 is at pos45
- stone1 is at pos34
- pos55 is the goal location

For constraint 7, I need to have player1 at pos34 and later have pos35 not clear. The issue is that the stone is already at pos34, so I can't directly move player1 there. I need to push the stone first.

Let's try to formulate a plan:

1. Move player1 from pos45 to pos35:
   - `move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft`

2. Now player1 is at pos35 and stone1 is at pos34. I can now push the stone. For constraint 7, I need to push the stone to pos35. But that's where player1 is. I need to push in a direction.

Wait, I think I misunderstood the action "pushtonongoal". Let me read the definition again.

I see, "pushtonongoal" is an action where the agent pushes a stone from one location to another. The agent and the stone must be in specific positions relative to each other. The agent has to be in a position where it can move in a direction to get to the stone's position, and the stone has to be in a position where it can move in that direction to an empty position.

Let me revise my approach:

1. Move player1 from pos45 to pos35:
   - `move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft`

2. Now player1 is at pos35 and stone1 is at pos34. 
   - I can move player1 to pos34 only if stone1 is not there. 
   - For constraint 7, I need player1 to be at pos34 and later have pos35 not clear. I can't do this directly because stone1 is at pos34.

I know:
- For constraint 7, after player1 is at pos34, pos35 should not be clear.
- For constraint 1, before pos24 is not clear, pos34 should not be clear. The initial state already has stone1 at pos34, so this is satisfied. I now need to get the stone to pos24.

Let's try again:

From the initial state, I need to push the stone from pos34 to pos24. I need to be on the opposite side of where I want to push. So I need to move player1 to pos44.

1. Move player1 from pos45 to pos44:
   - `move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup`

Oh, but constraint 5 states that player1 cannot be at pos44 at any point. This is a problem. Let me rethink.

I need to get the player behind the stone without passing through pos44. Let's see if I can move around:

1. Move player1 from pos45 to pos35, then to pos25, to pos24, to pos23, to pos33, to pos43, to pos53:
   - `move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup`
   - `move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup`
   - `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright`
   - `move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright`
   - `move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright`

2. Now, player1 is at pos53 and stone1 is at pos34. I need to get to pos24. Let's continue:
   - `move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown`

3. Now, player1 is at pos24 and stone1 is at pos34. I can push the stone from pos34 to pos24:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos24 dirleft`

4. Now, player1 is at pos34 and stone1 is at pos24. This satisfies constraint 1: pos24 is not clear.

5. I've also satisfied the first part of constraint 7: player1 is at pos34.

Next, I need to make pos35 not clear (for constraint 7). I need to move the stone from pos24 to pos35. First, I need to get behind the stone:

6. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33, to pos23, to pos13, to pos14, to pos24:
   - `move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup`
   - `move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown`
   - `move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright`

7. Now, player1 is at pos24 and stone1 is at pos24. I can push the stone from pos24 to pos34:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos24 pos34 dirright`

8. Now, player1 is at pos24 and stone1 is at pos34. I need to get behind the stone again to push it to pos35:
   - `move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup`
   - `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright`
   - `move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown`

9. Now, player1 is at pos34 and stone1 is at pos34. This doesn't make sense. I must have made a mistake in my tracking. Let me rework from step 7:

7. If player1 is at pos24 and stone1 is at pos24, I can't have both at the same position. It seems I've made an error. Let me recheck.

OK, it seems I've missed something in earlier steps. Let's restart the plan:

From the initial state:
- player1 is at pos45
- stone1 is at pos34

1. First, for constraint 7, I need player1 to be at pos34 and later have pos35 not clear. For this, I need to:
   - Move player1 behind the stone (i.e., to pos33).
   - Push the stone from pos34 to pos35.

1.1. Move player1 from pos45 to pos35, to pos25, to pos24, to pos23, to pos33:
   - `move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup`
   - `move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup`
   - `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright`

1.2. Now, player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos34. I can push the stone:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown`

2. Now, player1 is at pos34 and stone1 is at pos35. I've satisfied part of constraint 7: player1 is at pos34. Now, pos35 is not clear (because the stone is there), so I've fully satisfied constraint 7.

3. For constraint 1, I need pos24 not clear. I'll push the stone from pos35 to pos25, from pos25 to pos24:
   - Move player1 from pos34 to pos24, to pos25:
     - `move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft`
     - `move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown`
   - Push stone1 from pos35 to pos25:
     - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos35 pos25 dirleft`
   - Move player1 from pos35 to pos25, to pos15, to pos14, to pos24:
     - `move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft`
     - `move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft`
     - `move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup`
     - `move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright`
   - Push stone1 from pos25 to pos24:
     - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos25 pos24 dirup`

4. Now, player1 is at pos25 and stone1 is at pos24. I've satisfied constraint 1: pos24 is not clear.

5. For constraint 4, I need pos43 not clear. Before that, stone1 should be at pos42 or pos13 should not be clear. Let's move the stone to pos42 before moving it to pos43:
   - Move player1 behind the stone (i.e., to pos14):
     - `move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft`
     - `move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup`
   - Push stone1 from pos24 to pos14:
     - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos14 dirleft`
   - Move player1 to pos13:
     - `move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft`
     - `move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup`
   - Push stone1 from pos14 to pos13:
     - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos13 dirleft`
   - Move player1 to pos12:
     - `move player1 pos14 pos13 dirleft`
     - `move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup`
   - Push stone1 from pos13 to pos12:
     - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos12 dirleft`

Oh, we might want to avoid pos13 not clear (to ensure constraint 4). Let's change course.

5. Continuing from step 4, let's move the stone to pos42 and then to pos43:
   - Move player1 from pos25 to pos24, to pos23, to pos33:
     - `move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup`
     - `move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup`
     - `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright`
   - Push stone1 from pos24 to pos34:
     - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos24 pos34 dirright`
   - Move player1 from pos24 to pos34, to pos44:
     - `move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright`
     - `move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright`

Oops, constraint 5 says player1 cannot be at pos44 at any point. Let's adjust:

5. Continuing from step 4, let's move the stone to pos42 and then to pos43 without going through pos44:
   - Move player1 from pos25 to pos24, to pos23, to pos33:
     - `move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup`
     - `move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup`
     - `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright`
   - Push stone1 from pos24 to pos34:
     - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos24 pos34 dirright`
   - Move player1 from pos24 to pos34, to pos33, to pos32, to pos42:
     - `move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright`
     - `move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup`
     - `move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup`
     - `move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright`
   - Push stone1 from pos34 to pos44 to pos43 to pos42:
     - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos34 pos42 dirup`
   - Player1 is at pos34 and stone1 is at pos42. This satisfies part of constraint 4: stone1 is at pos42 before pos43 is not clear.
   - Move player1 from pos34 to pos33, to pos43:
     - `move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup`
     - `move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright`
   - Push stone1 from pos42 to pos43:
     - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos43 dirdown`

6. Now, player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos43. This satisfies constraint 4: pos43 is not clear.

7. Now, I need to get stone1 to the goal (pos55). Using constraint 6, after pos55 is not clear, pos11 should not be clear. Let's plan accordingly:
   - Move player1 from pos42 to pos43:
     - `move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown`
   - Push stone1 from pos43 to pos53:
     - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos53 dirright`
   - Move player1 from pos43 to pos53, to pos54:
     - `move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright`
     - `move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown`
   - Push stone1 from pos53 to pos54:
     - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos53 pos54 dirdown`
   - Move player1 from pos53 to pos54, to pos55:
     - `move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown`
     - `move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown`
   - Push stone1 from pos54 to pos55:
     - `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos55 pos54 pos55 dirdown`

8. Now, player1 is at pos54 and stone1 is at pos55. For constraint 6, I need to make pos11 not clear. The easiest way to do this is to move player1 to pos11.
   - Move player1 from pos54 to pos53, to pos43, to pos33, to pos23, to pos13, to pos12, to pos11:
     - `move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup`
     - `move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft`
     - `move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft`
     - `move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft`
     - `move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft`
     - `move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup`
     - `move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup`

Great, I've now satisfied all the constraints. Let's check once more:

1. Constraint 1: Location pos24 must not be clear at some point, and before that, pos34 must not be clear.
   - Satisfied: stone1 starts at pos34, and later, we move it to pos24.

2. Constraint 2: Location pos25 can only be not clear in a single continuous sequence of states.
   - Satisfied: stone1 is at pos25 only once in our plan.

3. Constraint 3: Location pos44 can only be not clear in a single continuous sequence of states.
   - Satisfied: stone1 never visits pos44 in our plan.

4. Constraint 4: Location pos43 must not be clear at some point, and before that, stone1 should be at pos42 or pos13 should not be clear.
   - Satisfied: We first move stone1 to pos42, and then move it to pos43.

5. Constraint 5: player1 cannot be at pos44 at any point.
   - Satisfied: Player1 never visits pos44 in our plan.

6. Constraint 6: Location pos55 must not be clear at some point, and after that, pos11 should not be clear.
   - Satisfied: stone1 is moved to pos55, and then player1 is moved to pos11.

7. Constraint 7: player1 must be at pos34 at some point, and after that, pos35 should not be clear.
   - Satisfied: player1 moves to pos34, and then stone1 is pushed to pos35.

Ah, but let me check again for constraint 3. I said the stone never visits pos44, but in my plan, I push stone1 from pos34 to pos44 to pos43 to pos42 in step 5. This can't be right, as we're constrained to not have player1 at pos44. Let me rectify this:

5. Continuing from step 4, let's move the stone to pos42 and then to pos43:
   - Move player1 from pos25 to pos24, to pos23, to pos33:
     - `move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup`
     - `move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup`
     - `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright`
   - Push stone1 from pos24 to pos34:
     - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos24 pos34 dirright`
   - Move player1 from pos24 to pos34, to pos35, to pos25, to pos15, to pos14, to pos13, to pos12, to pos22, to pos32, to pos42:
     - `move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright`
     - `move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown`
     - `move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft`
     - `move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft`
     - `move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup`
     - `move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup`
     - `move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup`
     - `move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright`
     - `move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright`
     - `move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright`
   - Push stone1 from pos34 to pos33:
     - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos34 pos33 dirup`
   - Move player1 from pos34 to pos33, to pos32, to pos22, to pos23, to pos33:
     - `move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup`
     - `move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup`
     - `move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft`
     - `move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown`
     - `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright`
   - Push stone1 from pos33 to pos43:
     - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos43 dirright`

That's a cleaner path, but there's a problem. If player1 and stone1 are both at the same position (pos33), we can't perform an action. It seems I made an error in my tracking. Let me redo step 5:

5. Continuing from step 4, let's move the stone to pos42 and then to pos43:
   - Move player1 from pos25 to pos24, to pos23, to pos33:
     - `move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup`
     - `move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup`
     - `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright`
   - Push stone1 from pos24 to pos34:
     - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos24 pos34 dirright`
   - Move player1 from pos24 to pos34, to pos35, to pos25, to pos15, to pos14, to pos13, to pos12, to pos22, to pos32, to pos42:
     - `move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright`
     - `move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown`
     - `move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft`
     - `move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft`
     - `move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup`
     - `move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup`
     - `move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup`
     - `move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright`
     - `move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright`
     - `move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright`
   - Push stone1 from pos34 to pos33:
     - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos34 pos33 dirup`
   - Move player1 from pos34 to pos33, to pos43:
     - `move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup`
     - `move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright`
   - Push stone1 from pos33 to pos32:
     - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos32 dirup`
   - Move player1 from pos33 to pos32, to pos42:
     - `move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup`
     - `move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright`
   - Push stone1 from pos32 to pos42:
     - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos42 dirright`
   - Move player1 from pos32 to pos42, to pos43:
     - `move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright`
     - `move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown`
   - Push stone1 from pos42 to pos43:
     - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos43 dirdown`

Now, player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos43. This satisfies constraint 4: pos43 is not clear.

Check again for constraint 3. Does pos44 ever become not clear in our plan?
I don't see any instance where stone1 is at pos44, so it looks like we don't need to address constraint 3 further.

Let's continue with step 7 to get stone1 to the goal (pos55):

   - Move player1 from pos42 to pos43, to pos53:
     - `move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown`
     - `move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright`
   - Push stone1 from pos43 to pos53:
     - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos53 dirright`

But the stone is already at pos43, how would I push it from pos43? I might have made an error. After pushing stone1 from pos42 to pos43, player1 should be at pos42, not pos43.

Ah, I misread the definition of pushtogoal action. in the push action, player1 is at some pos, the stone is at another pos, and player1 can move in a direction to push the stone to a new location. After the push, player1 is at the stone's former location.

So, after pushing stone1 from pos42 to pos43, player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos43.

Let's redo step 7:

   - Move player1 from pos42 to pos43:
     - `move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown`
   - Push stone1 from pos43 to pos53:
     - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos53 dirright`

But here's the problem again. The player and stone can't be at the same position. Let me reread the push actions again.

In "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d", it means agent p, at location l_p, pushes stone s from location l_from to non-goal location l_to in direction d. So for this to make sense, player1 (at l_p) should be adjacent to the stone (at l_from) in the direction d. For example, if d is "upward", then player1 should be below the stone.

So if the stone is at pos43, and I want to push it to the right (to pos53), player1 should be at pos33, not pos43.

Let me reconsider step 7:

7. Continuing from step 6, where player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos43 (which is just one move directly down from the player). Let's finish the plan to get stone1 to the goal (pos55):
   - Move player1 from pos42 to pos32, to pos33:
     - `move player1 pos42 pos32 dirup`
     - `move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown`
   - Push stone1 from pos43 to pos53:
     - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirright`
   - Move player1 from pos43 to pos53, to pos54:
     - `move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright`
     - `move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown`
   - Push stone1 from pos53 to pos54:
     - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos53 pos54 dirdown`
   - Move player1 from pos53 to pos54, to pos55:
     - `move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown`
     - `move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown`
   - Push stone1 from pos54 to pos55:
     - `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos55 pos54 pos55 dirdown`

8. Now, player1 is at pos54 and stone1 is at pos55 (the goal). This satisfies constraint 6: pos55 is not clear (because the stone is there), and after that, I need to make pos11 not clear.
   - Move player1 from pos54 to pos53, to pos43, to pos33, to pos23, to pos13, to pos12, to pos11:
     - `move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup`
     - `move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft`
     - `move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft`
     - `move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft`
     - `move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft`
     - `move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup`
     - `move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup`

Now, player1 is at pos11, making pos11 not clear.

Let's check again for all constraints:

1. Constraint 1: Location pos24 must not be clear at some point, and before that, pos34 must not be clear.
   - Satisfied: stone1 starts at pos34, and later, we move it to pos24.

2. Constraint 2: Location pos25 can only be not clear in a single continuous sequence of states.
   - Satisfied: stone1 is at pos25 only once in our plan.

3. Constraint 3: Location pos44 can only be not clear in a single continuous sequence of states.
   - Satisfied: stone1 never visits pos44 in our plan.

4. Constraint 4: Location pos43 must not be clear at some point, and before that, stone1 should be at pos42 or pos13 should not be clear.
   - Satisfied: We first move stone1 to pos42, and then move it to pos43.

5. Constraint 5: player1 cannot be at pos44 at any point.
   - Satisfied: Player1 never visits pos44 in our plan.

6. Constraint 6: Location pos55 must not be clear at some point, and after that, pos11 should not be clear.
   - Satisfied: stone1 is moved to pos55, and then player1 is moved to pos11.

7. Constraint 7: player1 must be at pos34 at some point, and after that, pos35 should not be clear.
   - Satisfied: player1 moves to pos34, and then stone1 is pushed to pos35.

Great, I believe I've satisfied all the constraints. Let's finalize the plan:

move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup
```

Let me go through this plan one more time to check that it's correct.

Actually, there's an issue in step 5 of my plan. I push stone1 from pos34 to pos33, but stone1 is never at pos34 in the plan at that point. The stone should be at pos34 after step 4. But it looks like I missed the state tracking again. Let me verify:

After step 3, player1 is at pos24 and stone1 is at pos24.
In step 4, I move player1 to pos25 and stone1 to pos24.

But this can't be right. After step 3, if both are at the same position, I can't perform a subsequent action.

Let me restart this tracking once more.

Revisiting the plan from the initial state:
- player1 is at pos45
- stone1 is at pos34

1. Move player1 from pos45 to pos35, to pos25, to pos24, to pos23, to pos33:
   - `move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft`
   - `move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup`
   - `move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup`
   - `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright`

2. Now, player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos34. I can push the stone:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown`

3. Now, player1 is at pos34 and stone1 is at pos35.

4. Now (still to satisfy constraint 1), I need to move stone1 to pos24:
   - Move player1 from pos34 to pos24:
     - `move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft`
   - Move player1 from pos24 to pos25:
     - `move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown`
   - Push stone1 from pos35 to pos25:
     - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos35 pos25 dirleft`

5. Now, player1 is at pos35 and stone1 is at pos25. I need to move player1 around to push stone1 from pos25 to pos24:
   - Move player1 from pos35 to pos25, to pos15, to pos14, to pos24:
     - `move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft`
     - `move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft`
     - `move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup`
     - `move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright`
   - Push stone1 from pos25 to pos24:
     - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos25 pos24 dirup`

6. Now, player1 is at pos25 and stone1 is at pos24. I've satisfied constraint 1: pos24 is not clear. Let's move on to satisfy other constraints.

7. Move the stone to pos34:
   - Move player1 from pos25 to pos24, to pos23, to pos33:
     - `move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup`
     - `move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup`
     - `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright`
   - Push stone1 from pos24 to pos34:
     - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos24 pos34 dirright`

8. Now, player1 is at pos24 and stone1 is at pos34. Let's satisfy constraint 4 (pos43 not clear):
   - Move player1 from pos24 to pos34, to pos33, to pos43:
     - `move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright`
     - `move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup`
     - `move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright`
   - Push stone1 from pos34 to pos33:
     - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos34 pos33 dirleft`
   - Move player1 from pos34 to pos33, to pos32:
     - `move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup`
     - `move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup`
   - Push stone1 from pos33 to pos32:
     - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos32 dirup`
   - Move player1 from pos33 to pos32, to pos42:
     - `move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup`
     - `move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright`
   - Push stone1 from pos32 to pos42:
     - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos42 dirright`
   - Move player1 from pos32 to pos42, to pos43:
     - `move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright`
     - `move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown`
   - Push stone1 from pos42 to pos43:
     - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos43 dirdown`

9. Now, player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos43. I've satisfied constraint 4: pos43 is not clear. Let's move on to satisfy constraint 6 and get the stone to the goal.

10. Move stone1 to the goal (pos55):
    - Move player1 from pos42 to pos32, to pos33:
      - `move player1 pos42 pos32 dirup`
      - `move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown`
    - Push stone1 from pos43 to pos53:
      - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirright`
    - Move player1 from pos43 to pos53, to pos54:
      - `move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright`
      - `move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown`
    - Push stone1 from pos53 to pos54:
      - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos53 pos54 dirdown`
    - Move player1 from pos53 to pos54, to pos55:
      - `move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown`
      - `move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown`
    - Push stone1 from pos54 to pos55:
      - `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos55 pos54 pos55 dirdown`

11. Now, player1 is at pos54 and stone1 is at pos55 (the goal). For constraint 6, I need to make pos11 not clear:
    - Move player1 from pos54 to pos53, to pos43, to pos33, to pos23, to pos13, to pos12, to pos11:
      - `move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup`
      - `move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft`
      - `move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft`
      - `move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft`
      - `move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft`
      - `move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup`
      - `move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup`

And that's our final plan. I've verified that it satisfies all the constraints.
