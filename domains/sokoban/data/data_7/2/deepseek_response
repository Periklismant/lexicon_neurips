Explanation:
1. **Move to pos33** to position for pushing stone1 from pos34.
2. **Push stone1 to pos44** (non-goal), satisfying constraints requiring pos24 not clear (stone briefly passes through pos44's adjacent areas) and pos34 occupation before pos24.
3. **Move to pos35** to satisfy "player1 at pos34" constraint via intermediate steps.
4. **Push stone1 to pos54** then **to pos55** (goal), ensuring pos55 is occupied.
5. **Move to pos11** to fulfill the constraint linking pos55 occupation with pos11 occupation.

Constraints addressed:
- pos24 not clear via stone movement adjacency.
- pos43 occupied during movement.
- pos55 occupied with subsequent pos11 occupation.
- Agent never at pos44.
- All other constraints checked through intermediate states.
