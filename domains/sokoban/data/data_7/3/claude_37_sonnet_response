Alright, let's break down this problem step-by-step.

First, let's understand the environment:
- We have a 5x5 grid (positions pos11 to pos55).
- The player, player1, is initially at pos13.
- There's a stone, stone1, initially at pos44.
- pos53 is a goal location.
- We need to get the stone to a goal location.

Now, let's consider the constraints:
1. Location pos45 must always be clear.
2. Player1 must be at location pos14 at least once.
3. If player1 is at pos14, then eventually player1 must be at pos11 or stone1 must be at pos52.
4. Location pos55 can be not clear in at most one continuous sequence of states.
5. Player1 must be at location pos41 at least once.
6. Location pos51 must not be clear at least once.
7. Location pos24 must not be clear at least once.
8. If location pos24 is not clear, then stone1 must have been at pos35 or pos34 earlier.
9. Player1 must be at location pos52 at least once.

Let's start thinking about the plan.

Our goal is to move the stone to pos53. Initially, the stone is at pos44. Let's consider how to get it to pos53. 

One way is:
- Move the player from pos13 to pos34 to be adjacent to the stone.
- Push the stone to pos54.
- Push the stone from pos54 to pos53.

But we have several constraints to satisfy. Let's see how to integrate these:

1. "Location pos45 must always be clear."
   - We should avoid pushing the stone to pos45 or moving the player to pos45.

2. "Player1 must be at location pos14 at least once."
   - During our plan, we need to make sure the player visits pos14.

3. "If player1 is at pos14, then eventually player1 must be at pos11 or stone1 must be at pos52."
   - After the player is at pos14, at some point we need to either move the player to pos11 or push the stone to pos52.

4. "Location pos55 can be not clear in at most one continuous sequence of states."
   - If we make pos55 not clear, we should ensure it becomes clear again before making it not clear again.

5. "Player1 must be at location pos41 at least once."
   - During our plan, the player needs to visit pos41.

6. "Location pos51 must not be clear at least once."
   - At some point, we need to either place the player or the stone at pos51.

7. "Location pos24 must not be clear at least once."
   - At some point, we need to either place the player or the stone at pos24.

8. "If location pos24 is not clear, then stone1 must have been at pos35 or pos34 earlier."
   - Before making pos24 not clear, we need to ensure the stone has been at pos35 or pos34.

9. "Player1 must be at location pos52 at least once."
   - During our plan, the player needs to visit pos52.

Given these constraints, we need to be strategic in our approach. Let's develop a plan.

Actually, I think we need to move the stone to position pos34 or pos35 first, so that we can then satisfy the constraint that pos24 is not clear, and prior to that the stone must have been at pos34 or pos35.

So a potential strategy would be:
1. Player moves from pos13 to pos23.
2. Player moves from pos23 to pos33.
3. Player moves from pos33 to pos34.
4. Player moves from pos34 to pos43.
5. Push the stone from pos44 to pos34.

At this point, the stone is at pos34, satisfying the precondition for constraint 8. 

Next, we can move the stone to pos24 to satisfy constraint 7.
6. Player moves to pos33.
7. Push the stone from pos34 to pos24.

Now let's satisfy some other constraints:
- Player needs to visit pos14 (constraint 2).
- After being at pos14, the player needs to be at pos11 or the stone needs to be at pos52 (constraint 3).
- Player needs to visit pos41 and pos52 (constraints 5 and 9).
- Location pos51 must not be clear at some point (constraint 6).

Let's continue the plan:
8. Player is now at pos33. Move to pos23.
9. Player moves from pos23 to pos13.
10. Player moves from pos13 to pos14, satisfying constraint 2.
11. Player moves from pos14 to pos13.
12. Player moves from pos13 to pos12.
13. Player moves from pos12 to pos11, satisfying part of constraint 3.
14. Player moves from pos11 to pos21.
15. Player moves from pos21 to pos31.
16. Player moves from pos31 to pos41, satisfying constraint 5.
17. Player moves from pos41 to pos51, making pos51 not clear and satisfying constraint 6.
18. Player moves from pos51 to pos52, satisfying constraint 9.

Now let's get the player close to the stone again and try to move it to the goal:
19. Player moves from pos52 to pos42.
20. Player moves from pos42 to pos32.
21. Player moves from pos32 to pos22.
22. Player moves from pos22 to pos23.
23. Player moves from pos23 to pos24, making the stone move from pos24 to pos25.
24. Player moves from pos24 to pos25, making the stone move to pos26. Oops, there's no pos26.

Let me reconsider this plan.

Actually, I think while the player is at pos24 (after step 23), we should push the stone to pos25. Then, the player would move to push it further.

Let's adjust the plan after step 22:
23. Player moves from pos23 to pos24, now adjacent to the stone.
24. Player pushes the stone from pos24 to pos25, making pos24 clear.
25. Player moves from pos24 to pos34.
26. Player moves from pos34 to pos44.
27. Player moves from pos44 to pos54.
28. Player moves from pos54 to pos53.
29. Player pushes the stone from pos25 to pos35.
30. Player pushes the stone from pos35 to pos45. But this violates constraint 1.

I should rethink the approach. Maybe we can move the stone from pos34 (after step 5) directly to the goal without pushing it to pos24.

Let's adjust the plan after step 5:
6. Player is now at pos43. Push the stone from pos34 to pos33.
7. Player moves from pos33 to pos43.
8. Push the stone from pos33 to pos43.
9. Player moves from pos43 to pos33.
10. Push the stone from pos43 to pos53, satisfying the task.

But we still need to satisfy the constraints. Let's integrate them:
11. Player moves from pos43 to pos44.
12. Player moves from pos44 to pos34.
13. Player moves from pos34 to pos24, making pos24 not clear and satisfying constraint 7.
14. Player moves from pos24 to pos14, satisfying constraint 2.
15. Player moves from pos14 to pos13.
16. Player moves from pos13 to pos12.
17. Player moves from pos12 to pos11, satisfying part of constraint 3.
18. Player moves from pos11 to pos21.
19. Player moves from pos21 to pos31.
20. Player moves from pos31 to pos41, satisfying constraint 5.
21. Player moves from pos41 to pos51, making pos51 not clear and satisfying constraint 6.
22. Player moves from pos51 to pos52, satisfying constraint 9.

This seems to work, but I'd still like to double-check if all the constraints are satisfied.

Constraint 1: "Location pos45 must always be clear."
- The plan does not involve moving the player or the stone to pos45, so this constraint is satisfied.

Constraint 2: "Player1 must be at location pos14 at least once."
- Step 14 satisfies this constraint.

Constraint 3: "If player1 is at pos14, then eventually player1 must be at pos11 or stone1 must be at pos52."
- Player1 is at pos14 in step 14, and then at pos11 in step 17. This satisfies the constraint.

Constraint 4: "Location pos55 can be not clear in at most one continuous sequence of states."
- The plan does not involve making pos55 not clear, so this constraint is satisfied.

Constraint 5: "Player1 must be at location pos41 at least once."
- Step 20 satisfies this constraint.

Constraint 6: "Location pos51 must not be clear at least once."
- Step 21 satisfies this constraint.

Constraint 7: "Location pos24 must not be clear at least once."
- Step 13 satisfies this constraint.

Constraint 8: "If location pos24 is not clear, then stone1 must have been at pos35 or pos34 earlier."
- pos24 becomes not clear in step 13. The stone is at pos34 in step 5, before this. This satisfies the constraint.

Constraint 9: "Player1 must be at location pos52 at least once."
- Step 22 satisfies this constraint.

Great, it seems the plan satisfies all the constraints. Let's review it once more to ensure it's valid and optimal. But first, I need to be more precise about the actions. Let's write down the plan in the form of the actions provided (move, pushtogoal, pushtonongoal).

1. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirdown
2. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirdown
3. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
4. move player1 pos34 pos43 dirright
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos34 dirleft
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos34 pos33 dirup
7. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos43 dirright
9. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
10. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirright
11. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
12. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
13. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
14. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft
15. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
16. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
17. move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup
18. move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright
19. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
20. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
21. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
22. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown

I think there's an issue with this plan, especially steps 5 and 6. Let's re-think:

When the player is at pos43, they can't directly push the stone from pos44 to pos34, as they need to be adjacent to the stone. Similarly, when the player is at pos34, they can't push the stone from pos34 to pos33, as the player's position would be the starting position of the stone.

So, we need to adjust our plan. Let me reconstruct this:

1. The player is at pos13 and the stone is at pos44.
2. The player needs to get to pos43 to be adjacent to the stone.
3. Then, player can push the stone from pos44 to pos43.
4. After that, player can push the stone from pos43 to pos53, which is the goal.

Let's revise the plan:

1. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
2. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
3. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
4. move player1 pos34 pos43 dirup
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos43 dirleft
6. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos53 dirright

This plan gets the stone to the goal, but we need to ensure all constraints are satisfied. Let's continue from step 6 to satisfy the other constraints:

7. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
8. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
9. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown (Now pos24 is not clear, satisfying constraint 7)
10. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft (Now the player is at pos14, satisfying constraint 2)
11. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
12. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
13. move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup (After player was at pos14, now is at pos11, satisfying constraint 3)
14. move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright
15. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
16. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright (Now the player is at pos41, satisfying constraint 5)
17. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright (Now pos51 is not clear, satisfying constraint 6)
18. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown (Now the player is at pos52, satisfying constraint 9)

Wait, there's still an issue. Let's check if constraint 8 is satisfied. It states: "If location pos24 is not clear, then stone1 must have been at pos35 or pos34 earlier."
In our plan, pos24 becomes not clear in step 9 because the player moves there. Before that, the stone has been at pos44 and pos43, but not at pos35 or pos34. 

So we need to adjust the plan again. Let's revise:

1. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
2. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
3. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
4. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright (The player is now adjacent to the stone)
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos44 pos34 dirleft (The stone is now at pos34, satisfying the first part of constraint 8)
6. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft (Now the player is at pos24)
7. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
8. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
9. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown (Now the player is adjacent to the stone)
10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos34 pos43 dirright (The stone is now at pos43)
11. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft (Now pos24 is not clear, satisfying constraint 7, and the stone has been at pos34, satisfying constraint 8)
12. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft (Now the player is at pos14, satisfying constraint 2)
13. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
14. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
15. move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup (After player was at pos14, now is at pos11, satisfying constraint 3)
16. move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright
17. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
18. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright (Now the player is at pos41, satisfying constraint 5)
19. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright (Now pos51 is not clear, satisfying constraint 6)
20. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown (Now the player is at pos52, satisfying constraint 9)
21. move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft
22. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown (Now the player is adjacent to the stone)
23. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos53 dirright

This plan satisfies constraint 8, but I've realized something more important: in step 5, when the player pushes the stone from pos44 to pos34, the player will end up at pos44 (the stone's starting position), not pos34. So, there's another issue with the plan. Let's correct it.

Actually, let me rethink this from scratch.

The player is at pos13 and the stone is at pos44. We want to get the stone to the goal at pos53.

To push the stone to pos53, the player needs to be at pos43 and push to the right.

Let's break down the steps:
1. Player moves from pos13 to a position adjacent to pos44 (e.g., pos34).
2. Player pushes the stone from pos44 to pos43.
3. Player pushes the stone from pos43 to pos53 (goal).

Now, let's incorporate the constraints:
- Stone should be at pos34 or pos35 at some point (for constraint 8).
- After this, pos24 should be not clear (for constraint 7).
- Player should visit pos14 (for constraint 2).
- After being at pos14, player should be at pos11 (for constraint 3).
- Player should visit pos41 (for constraint 5).
- Location pos51 should be not clear at some point (for constraint 6).
- Player should visit pos52 (for constraint 9).

Let me try to sketch out a flow:
1. Player moves from pos13 to pos34.
2. Player pushes the stone from pos44 to pos34 (satisfying the first part of constraint 8).
3. Player moves to a position where they can push the stone from pos34 to pos24.
4. Player pushes the stone from pos34 to pos24 (making pos24 not clear, satisfying constraint 7).
5. Player moves the stone to pos43 (possibly through pos33).
6. Player pushes the stone from pos43 to pos53 (goal).
7. Player visits pos14, pos11, pos41, pos51, and pos52 to satisfy the other constraints.

I think I'm on the right track now. Let's see if we can piece together a complete, correct plan.

Let me be extra careful with the actions, particularly the push actions. For "pushtonongoal", the first location is the agent's initial position, the second is the stone's initial position, and the third is the stone's final position.

Here's the plan:
1. Player starts at pos13.
2. Player moves to pos14.
3. Player moves to pos24.
4. Player moves to pos34.
5. Player moves to pos44. (Now player is adjacent to the stone)
6. Player pushes the stone from pos44 to pos34. (Stone is at pos34, player is at pos44, satisfying the first part of constraint 8)

1. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
2. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
3. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
4. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos44 pos34 dirleft

After this, the player is at pos44 and the stone is at pos34.
6. Player moves from pos44 to pos34. (Now player is adjacent to the stone again)
7. Player pushes the stone from pos34 to pos24. (Stone is at pos24, player is at pos34, satisfying constraint 7)

6. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos34 pos24 dirleft

After this, the player is at pos34 and the stone is at pos24.
8. Player moves from pos34 to pos24. (Now player is adjacent to the stone again)
9. Player pushes the stone from pos24 to pos23. (Stone is at pos23, player is at pos24)

8. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos24 pos23 dirup

After this, the player is at pos24 and the stone is at pos23.
10. Player moves from pos24 to pos23. (Now player is adjacent to the stone again)
11. Player pushes the stone from pos23 to pos33. (Stone is at pos33, player is at pos23)

10. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos23 pos33 dirright

After this, the player is at pos23 and the stone is at pos33.
12. Player moves from pos23 to pos33. (Now player is adjacent to the stone again)
13. Player pushes the stone from pos33 to pos43. (Stone is at pos43, player is at pos33)

12. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
13. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos43 dirright

After this, the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos43.
14. Player moves from pos33 to pos43. (Now player is adjacent to the stone again)
15. Player pushes the stone from pos43 to pos53 (goal). (Stone is at pos53, player is at pos43)

14. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
15. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos53 dirright

Now the stone is at the goal, but we still need to satisfy some other constraints.
16. Player moves from pos43 to pos42. 
17. Player moves from pos42 to pos32.
18. Player moves from pos32 to pos22.
19. Player moves from pos22 to pos12.
20. Player moves from pos12 to pos11. (Player is at pos11, satisfying part of constraint 3)
21. Player moves from pos11 to pos21.
22. Player moves from pos21 to pos31.
23. Player moves from pos31 to pos41. (Player is at pos41, satisfying constraint 5)
24. Player moves from pos41 to pos51. (pos51 is not clear, satisfying constraint 6)
25. Player moves from pos51 to pos52. (Player is at pos52, satisfying constraint 9)
26. Player moves from pos52 to pos42.
27. Player moves from pos42 to pos32.
28. Player moves from pos32 to pos22.
29. Player moves from pos22 to pos12.
30. Player moves from pos12 to pos13.
31. Player moves from pos13 to pos14. (Player is at pos14, satisfying constraint 2)

16. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
17. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
18. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft
19. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft
20. move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup
21. move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright
22. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
23. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
24. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
25. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
26. move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft
27. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
28. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft
29. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft
30. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
31. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown

Wait, I realized that constraint 3 states: "If player is at pos14, then eventually player must be at pos11 or stone must be at pos52." The ordering I have doesn't satisfy this. 

Let's rearrange our plan. We'll move the player to pos14 first, then to pos11.
1. Player moves from pos13 to pos14. (Player is at pos14, satisfying constraint 2)
2. Player moves from pos14 to pos13. 
3. Player moves from pos13 to pos12. 
4. Player moves from pos12 to pos11. (After player was at pos14, player is now at pos11, satisfying constraint 3)
5. Player moves from pos11 to pos21.
6. Player moves from pos21 to pos31.
7. Player moves from pos31 to pos41. (Player is at pos41, satisfying constraint 5)
8. Player moves from pos41 to pos51. (pos51 is not clear, satisfying constraint 6)
9. Player moves from pos51 to pos52. (Player is at pos52, satisfying constraint 9)
10. Player moves from pos52 to pos42.
11. Player moves from pos42 to pos32.
12. Player moves from pos32 to pos22.
13. Player moves from pos22 to pos23.
14. Player moves from pos23 to pos24.
15. Player moves from pos24 to pos34.
16. Player moves from pos34 to pos44. (Now player is adjacent to the stone)
17. Player pushes the stone from pos44 to pos34. (Stone is at pos34, player is at pos44, satisfying the first part of constraint 8)
18. Player moves from pos44 to pos34. (Now player is adjacent to the stone again)
19. Player pushes the stone from pos34 to pos24. (Stone is at pos24, player is at pos34, satisfying constraint 7)
20. Player moves from pos34 to pos24. (Now player is adjacent to the stone again)
21. Player pushes the stone from pos24 to pos23. (Stone is at pos23, player is at pos24)
22. Player moves from pos24 to pos23. (Now player is adjacent to the stone again)
23. Player pushes the stone from pos23 to pos33. (Stone is at pos33, player is at pos23)
24. Player moves from pos23 to pos33. (Now player is adjacent to the stone again)
25. Player pushes the stone from pos33 to pos43. (Stone is at pos43, player is at pos33)
26. Player moves from pos33 to pos43. (Now player is adjacent to the stone again)
27. Player pushes the stone from pos43 to pos53 (goal). (Stone is at pos53, player is at pos43)

This plan satisfies all our constraints, but I'm still worried about the optimality.

Let me re-think the problem more systematically.

Our goal is to push the stone to a goal location (pos53). The stone starts at pos44, and the player starts at pos13.

To push the stone from pos44 to pos43, the player needs to be at pos44 first (to push from the right).
To push the stone from pos43 to pos53, the player needs to be at pos43 (to push from the left).

So, the "base" plan, just to achieve the goal, would be:
1. Player moves from pos13 to pos44.
2. Player pushes the stone from pos44 to pos43.
3. Player moves from pos44 to pos43.
4. Player pushes the stone from pos43 to pos53 (goal).

But we also have several constraints to respect. Let's group them by what locations the player or stone needs to visit:

Player visits: pos14, pos11, pos41, pos52, pos24 (not clear).
Stone visits: pos34 or pos35 (if pos24 is not clear).

Given these constraints, I'll try to derive the most direct and optimal path.

After re-evaluating, I think we need to keep in mind that the constraints say the following:

- if the player is at pos14, then eventually they must be at pos11 or the stone must be at pos52. 
- if pos24 is not clear at some point, the stone must have been at pos34 or pos35 prior to this.

Given these constraints, I think we should revise our strategy. 

We could first move the player to pos14 as we did before, then to pos11, to satisfy constraint 3. But if we push the stone to pos52 after the player is at pos14, this would also satisfy constraint 3 and might make our plan more efficient.

But let's first stick to the first approach, since moving the stone to pos52 would require a lot of detours. We'll then navigate to pos41 and pos51 to satisfy constraints 5 and 6, and finally to pos52 for constraint 9. Then we'll go about the business of pushing the stone to the goal, making sure it passes through pos34 or pos35 to satisfy constraint 8 before making pos24 not clear.

I think the most straightforward plan is:
1. Player moves from pos13 to pos14. (Player is at pos14, satisfying constraint 2)
2. Player moves from pos14 to pos13.
3. Player moves from pos13 to pos12.
4. Player moves from pos12 to pos11. (After player was at pos14, player is now at pos11, satisfying constraint 3)
5. Player moves from pos11 to pos21.
6. Player moves from pos21 to pos31.
7. Player moves from pos31 to pos41. (Player is at pos41, satisfying constraint 5)
8. Player moves from pos41 to pos51. (pos51 is not clear, satisfying constraint 6)
9. Player moves from pos51 to pos52. (Player is at pos52, satisfying constraint 9)
10. Player moves from pos52 to pos42.
11. Player moves from pos42 to pos32.
12. Player moves from pos32 to pos33.
13. Player moves from pos33 to pos34.
14. Player moves from pos34 to pos44. (Now player is adjacent to the stone)
15. Player pushes the stone from pos44 to pos34. (Stone is at pos34, player is at pos44, and the stone has been at pos34, satisfying the first part of constraint 8)
16. Player moves from pos44 to pos43.
17. Player moves from pos43 to pos33.
18. Player moves from pos33 to pos23.
19. Player moves from pos23 to pos24. (Now pos24 is not clear, satisfying constraint 7, and the stone has been at pos34, satisfying constraint 8 completely)
20. Player moves from pos24 to pos34. (Now player is adjacent to the stone again)
21. Player pushes the stone from pos34 to pos33. (Stone is at pos33, player is at pos34)
22. Player moves from pos34 to pos33. (Now player is adjacent to the stone again)
23. Player pushes the stone from pos33 to pos43. (Stone is at pos43, player is at pos33)
24. Player moves from pos33 to pos43. (Now player is adjacent to the stone again)
25. Player pushes the stone from pos43 to pos53 (goal). (Stone is at pos53, player is at pos43)

This seems to be an optimal plan given all the constraints. Let's write out the full plan in the required format:

1. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
2. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
3. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
4. move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup
5. move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright
6. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
7. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
8. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
9. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
10. move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft
11. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
12. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
13. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
14. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
15. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos44 pos34 dirleft
16. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
17. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
18. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
19. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
20. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
21. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos34 pos33 dirup
22. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
23. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos43 dirright
24. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
25. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos53 dirright

Actually, I think there might be an issue with the pushto... actions. Let me sanity-check these:

- "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Preconditions include agent p at l_p, stone s at l_from, l_to clear, can get from l_p to l_from following d, can get from l_from to l_to following d, and l_to is a goal location.
- "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Same as pushtogoal, but l_to is not a goal location.

So for the push action in step 15, I would need:
- player1 at pos44 (correct)
- stone1 at pos44 (correct)
- pos34 clear (should be correct based on earlier steps)
- can get from pos44 to pos44 following dirleft (this seems redundant, so maybe it's just a check if the player is adjacent to the stone)
- can get from pos44 to pos34 following dirleft (correct based on the available moves)
- pos34 is not a goal location (correct)

So this seems right.

For the push action in step 21, I would need:
- player1 at pos34 (correct)
- stone1 at pos34 (correct)
- pos33 clear (should be correct based on earlier steps)
- can get from pos34 to pos34 following dirup (as before, seems redundant)
- can get from pos34 to pos33 following dirup (correct based on the available moves)
- pos33 is not a goal location (correct)

This seems right too.

For the push action in step 23, I would need:
- player1 at pos33 (correct)
- stone1 at pos33 (correct)
- pos43 clear (should be correct based on earlier steps)
- can get from pos33 to pos33 following dirright (redundant, as discussed)
- can get from pos33 to pos43 following dirright (correct based on the available moves)
- pos43 is not a goal location (correct)

And this seems right too.

For the push action in step 25, I would need:
- player1 at pos43 (correct)
- stone1 at pos43 (correct)
- pos53 clear (should be correct based on earlier steps)
- can get from pos43 to pos43 following dirright (redundant, as discussed)
- can get from pos43 to pos53 following dirright (correct based on the available moves)
- pos53 is a goal location (correct)

All the push actions seem correctly formulated.

Let me go through each step to make sure it's valid and check if the final plan is optimal.

Starting state:
- player1 is at pos13
- stone1 is at pos44
- pos53 is a goal location

Step 1: player1 moves from pos13 to pos14.
After this: player1 is at pos14, stone1 is at pos44.
This step begins satisfying constraint 2.

Step 2: player1 moves from pos14 to pos13.
After this: player1 is at pos13, stone1 is at pos44.

Step 3: player1 moves from pos13 to pos12.
After this: player1 is at pos12, stone1 is at pos44.

Step 4: player1 moves from pos12 to pos11.
After this: player1 is at pos11, stone1 is at pos44.
This satisfies constraint 3 since player1 was at pos14 in a previous state and now is at pos11.

Step 5: player1 moves from pos11 to pos21.
After this: player1 is at pos21, stone1 is at pos44.

Step 6: player1 moves from pos21 to pos31.
After this: player1 is at pos31, stone1 is at pos44.

Step 7: player1 moves from pos31 to pos41.
After this: player1 is at pos41, stone1 is at pos44.
This step satisfies constraint 5.

Step 8: player1 moves from pos41 to pos51.
After this: player1 is at pos51, stone1 is at pos44.
This step satisfies constraint 6 since pos51 is not clear.

Step 9: player1 moves from pos51 to pos52.
After this: player1 is at pos52, stone1 is at pos44.
This step satisfies constraint 9.

Step 10: player1 moves from pos52 to pos42.
After this: player1 is at pos42, stone1 is at pos44.

Step 11: player1 moves from pos42 to pos32.
After this: player1 is at pos32, stone1 is at pos44.

Step 12: player1 moves from pos32 to pos33.
After this: player1 is at pos33, stone1 is at pos44.

Step 13: player1 moves from pos33 to pos34.
After this: player1 is at pos34, stone1 is at pos44.

Step 14: player1 moves from pos34 to pos44.
After this: player1 is at pos44, stone1 is at pos44.
Wait, this is not valid. The stone is already at pos44, so the player can't move there. Let me revise the plan.

It seems like the order of the action descriptions in the original problem wasn't consistent. I assumed the push actions would put the stone first, but for these actions, it's actually the player's position that matters first (which was stated in the problem description, but got blurred with other interpretations).

Let's re-examine the state of the world. The player is at pos13 and the stone is at pos44. Let's revisit the constraints and come up with a direct, valid plan.

Let me focus on what I missed. For the pushto... actions:
- pushtogoal player1 stone1 l_p l_from l_to d means:
  - player1 is at l_p (adjacent to l_from)
  - stone1 is at l_from
  - l_to (destination for the stone) is clear
  - you can move from l_p to l_from following d (player is adjacent to stone)
  - you can move from l_from to l_to following d (stone is adjacent to destination)
  - l_to is a goal location

So, to push the stone from pos44 to pos34, the player would need to be at a position adjacent to pos44, like pos43 (to the left).

Let's rethink the plan from the beginning. The player is at pos13 and the stone is at pos44. The goal is to push the stone to pos53, which is a goal location.

Given the constraints, the player needs to:
1. Be at pos14 at some point (constraint 2).
2. After being at pos14, either be at pos11 or the stone should be at pos52 (constraint 3).
3. Be at pos41 at some point (constraint 5).
4. Make pos51 not clear at some point (constraint 6).
5. Make pos24 not clear at some point (constraint 7).
6. Before making pos24 not clear, ensure the stone has been at pos34 or pos35 (constraint 8).
7. Be at pos52 at some point (constraint 9).

With these constraints in mind, I'll try to come up with a valid, direct plan.

First, the player will satisfy constraints 2 and 3 by going to pos14 and then to pos11. They'll then continue to satisfy other constraints like being at pos41, making pos51 not clear, and being at pos52. After that, they'll position themselves to push the stone. 

The player needs to be at pos43 to push the stone from pos44 to pos34 (satisfying the first part of constraint 8). Then, they might need to move the stone around to eventually push it to the goal at pos53. They'll also need to ensure pos24 is not clear at some point, after the stone has been at pos34 or pos35.

Let's come up with the plan.

Before directly going to the stone, the player will first visit the positions needed by the constraints:
1. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown (constraint 2)
2. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
3. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
4. move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup (constraint 3)
5. move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright
6. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
7. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright (constraint 5)
8. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright (constraint 6)
9. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown (constraint 9)

Now, the player will go to position themselves to push the stone:
10. move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft
11. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos34 dirleft (constraint 8, first part)

Now, the player needs to ensure pos24 is not clear after the stone has been at pos34 (which it is now). One way is to move the player to pos24.
13. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
14. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft (constraint 7, and with constraint 8 satisfied as the stone has been at pos34)

Now, the player needs to get the stone to the goal (pos53):
15. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
16. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
17. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos33 dirleft

Now the stone is at pos33 and the player is at pos34. The player needs to get the stone to pos53 (the goal).
18. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
19. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos43 dirright

Now the stone is at pos43 and the player is at pos33. The player can push the stone to the goal:
20. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
21. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos53 dirright

And now the stone is at the goal (pos53). This plan should satisfy all the constraints.

Actually, I need to revise this plan slightly. In step 12, I can't use pushtonongoal because there's an issue with the directions. In the problem, I'm assuming the player has to be at a location adjacent to the stone, from which they can move to the stone's location following a direction d. Then, the stone can move in the same direction d to its destination.

Let's break down step 12. The player is at pos43 (adjacent to stone at pos44 from the left). To push the stone, the player would move to the stone's location (pos44) from a direction, and the stone would move in that same direction. However, the stone would move to a position to the right of pos44, not to the left as intended for pos34.

In reality, to push the stone from pos44 to pos34, the player needs to be at pos54 and push the stone to the left.

I'll rethink the plan.

The player starts at pos13 and the stone is at pos44. The goal is to push the stone to pos53 (a goal location). Given all the constraints, the player must visit certain positions and ensure the stone is at pos34 or pos35 before making pos24 not clear.

The player will first satisfy the constraints by visiting the required positions, and then position themselves to push the stone to the goal.

Let's try again:
1. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown (constraint 2)
2. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
3. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
4. move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup (constraint 3)
5. move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright
6. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
7. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright (constraint 5)
8. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright (constraint 6)
9. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown (constraint 9)

Now, to push the stone from pos44 to pos34, the player needs to be at pos54:
10. move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
11. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirup

But I realize we have a problem. The player can't push the stone from below because the player is at pos54, and the stone is at pos44. Let me reconsider what "following direction d" means. D is the direction of the push, not the relative position.

For example, if the player is at pos43, they can push the stone at pos44 to the right (dirright) to pos45 or to the left (dirleft) to pos42.

Actually looking back at the problem description, let me re-read the pushtogoal and pushtonongoal preconditions:

For pushtogoal, preconditions are:
(i) agent p is at location l_p, 
(ii) stone s is at location l_from, 
(iii) location l_to is clear, 
(iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, 
(v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and 
(vi) location l_to is a goal location.

I need to be more careful about the direction d. For example, if the player is at pos43 and the stone is at pos44, to push the stone to its right (to pos45), we'd use pushto... player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirright. The player (at pos43) can get to the stone (at pos44) following dirright, and the stone (at pos44) can get to its destination (pos45) following dirright.

To push the stone from pos44 to pos34, the player would need to be at pos54, and the push direction would be dirup. The player (at pos54) can get to the stone (at pos44) following dirup, and the stone (at pos44) can get to its destination (pos34) following dirup.

OK, let's revise the plan with a clearer understanding of the push actions.

1. The player starts at pos13.
2. The stone starts at pos44.
3. The goal is to move the stone to a goal location (pos53).

Let's come up with a direct plan that satisfies all the constraints:

1. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown (constraint 2)
2. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
3. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
4. move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup (constraint 3)
5. move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright
6. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
7. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright (constraint 5)
8. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright (constraint 6)
9. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown (constraint 9)

Now the player is at pos52. They need to get to a position from which they can push the stone from pos44 to pos34 or pos35 (to satisfy the first part of constraint 8). Looking at the grid, to push the stone from pos44 to pos34, the player can either be at pos54 (pushing up) or at pos43 (pushing left).

Let's continue:
10. move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
11. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirup (constraint 8, first part)

Now the stone is at pos34 and the player is at pos44. The player should then ensure pos24 is not clear after the stone has been at pos34. The simplest way is to move the player to pos24.
13. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
14. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft (constraint 7, and with constraint 8 satisfied as the stone has been at pos34)

Now the player is at pos24 and the stone is at pos34. Next, the goal is to get the stone to pos53.

From pos34, to get to pos53, the stone has to move through several positions. One path could be: pos34 -> pos33 -> pos43 -> pos53. To navigate this path, the player needs to reposition themselves at each step.

Let's continue:
15. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
16. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
17. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos33 dirleft

Now the stone is at pos33 and the player is at pos34. Next, the goal is to get the stone to pos43.
18. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
19. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos43 dirright

Now the stone is at pos43 and the player is at pos33. Next, the goal is to push the stone to pos53.
20. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
21. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos53 dirright

Now the stone is at the goal (pos53) and we're done. This plan should satisfy all the constraints.

Let me double-check the push actions.

For step 12:
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirup
- player1 is at pos54
- stone1 is at pos44
- pos34 is clear
- player1 can move from pos54 to pos44 following dirup (this is a valid move)
- stone1 can move from pos44 to pos34 following dirup (this is a valid move)
- pos34 is not a goal location

For step 17:
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos33 dirleft
- player1 is at pos33
- stone1 is at pos34
- pos33 is clear
- player1 can move from pos33 to pos34 following dirright (this is a valid move)
- stone1 can move from pos34 to pos33 following dirleft (this is a valid move)
- pos33 is not a goal location

But wait, there's a contradiction here. The player is moving from pos33 to pos34 following dirright, but the stone is moving from pos34 to pos33 following dirleft. They're going in opposite directions. This doesn't seem to match the constraint that "you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d".

I think I misunderstood the action descriptions again. Let me re-read them.

For "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d", the preconditions state that "You may only perform this action if ... (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is a goal location."

So, the direction d is consistent for both movements: the player to the stone and the stone to its destination. This means the player and the stone move in the same direction.

Let's say the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos34. To push the stone to pos33, the player would move from pos33 to pos34 (dirleft) and the stone would move from pos34 to pos33 (also dirleft). But this means the player and the stone would be at the same position, which is physically impossible. 

I think I'm misunderstanding the constraints. The problem says "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d" and "you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d", so the direction is consistent. But it doesn't make sense for the player and stone to move in the same direction during a push.

OK, I think I'm confusing myself. Let's re-read the action descriptions:

"move p l_from l_to d": Move agent p from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.
"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.
"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to non-goal location l_to, following direction d.

I think the confusion is with the direction `d`. It seems like it's simply the direction of the push. So for example, if the player is at pos43 and the stone is at pos44, then to push the stone to the right (to pos45), the direction would be dirright. The player doesn't move to the stone's position and the stone doesn't move from the player's position.
The player is at `l_p` and their position relative to the stone (`l_from`) combined with the direction `d` determines where the stone ends up (`l_to`).

For example, to push the stone from pos44 to pos34, the player needs to be at a position adjacent to pos44 such that pushing in the required direction would result in the stone moving to pos34. In this case, the player would need to be at pos45, and the direction would be dirleft.

At pos45, the player pushes the stone at pos44 dirleft, which gives l_to as pos43 (wrong). If the player is at pos54, they push the stone at pos44 dirup gives l_to as pos34 (correct).

Ah, wait. Let me reread the action descriptions more.

For "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d" (and similarly for "pushtonongoal"), the preconditions state:
"(iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is a goal location."

I think the confusion I have is what "following direction d" means in this context. Is the player pushing the stone from its position, or is the player entering the position of the stone and displacing it?

Reading the effects of the action: it says, "(i) agent p is no longer at location l_p, (ii) stone s is no longer at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is no longer clear, (iv) agent p is at location l_from, (v) stone s is at location l_to, (vi) location l_p is clear, and (vi) stone s is at a goal state."

So, after the "pushtogoal" action, the player is at the stone's old position, and the stone is at its new position. This suggests that the player moves into the stone's position, displacing the stone in the direction d.

This means to push the stone from pos44 to pos34, the player needs to be at a position such that moving in the direction dirup would put the player at pos44. This position would be pos54.

Let's revise my understanding and the plan accordingly.

When the player is at pos54 and the stone is at pos44, a push in the dirup direction:
- The player moves from pos54 to pos44 (dirup).
- The stone moves from pos44 to pos34 (dirup).
- After the action, the player is at pos44 and the stone is at pos34.

With this understanding, let's revise the plan.

The player starts at pos13 and the stone is at pos44. The goal is to get the stone to pos53 (a goal location).

I'll outline a direct plan taking into account all the constraints:

1. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown (constraint 2)
2. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
3. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
4. move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup (constraint 3)
5. move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright
6. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
7. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright (constraint 5)
8. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright (constraint 6)
9. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown (constraint 9)

Now, to push the stone from pos44 to pos34, the player needs to be at a position such that moving in the direction would put the player at pos44. This position would be pos54 for direction dirup.
10. move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
11. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirup (constraint 8, first part)

After this action, the player is at pos44 and the stone is at pos34. To ensure pos24 is not clear after the stone has been at pos34, the player can move to pos24.
13. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
14. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
15. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
16. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown (constraint 7, and with constraint 8 satisfied as the stone has been at pos34)

Now the player is at pos24. The goal is to get the stone to pos53. From pos34, a trajectory could be: pos34 -> pos33 -> pos43 -> pos53.

To push the stone from pos34 to pos33, the player needs to be at pos35.
17. move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown
18. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright
19. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirleft

After this, the player is at pos34 and the stone is at pos33. To push the stone from pos33 to pos43, the player needs to be at pos23.
20. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
21. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
22. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright

After this, the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos43. To push the stone from pos43 to pos53, the player needs to be at pos33.
23. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirright

After this, the player is at pos43 and the stone is at pos53 (the goal). This plan satisfies all the constraints. However, I just realized there might be a shorter way to satisfy the constraints. 

Recall constraint 3: "If player1 is at pos14, then eventually player1 must be at pos11 or stone1 must be at pos52." We've chosen to satisfy this by moving the player from pos14 to pos11. However, we could also satisfy it by moving the stone to pos52. This might lead to a shorter plan.

Actually, the constraints that the player needs to satisfy are quite scattered (pos14, pos11, pos41, pos52), which might make this plan close to optimal already.

So the whole plan is:

1. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown (constraint 2)
2. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
3. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
4. move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup (constraint 3)
5. move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright
6. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
7. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright (constraint 5)
8. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright (constraint 6)
9. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown (constraint 9)
10. move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
11. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirup (constraint 8, first part)
13. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
14. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
15. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
16. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown (constraint 7, and with constraint 8 satisfied as the stone has been at pos34)
17. move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown
18. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright
19. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirleft
20. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
21. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
22. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright
23. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirright

This should be a valid plan that satisfies all the constraints. Double-checking the push actions:

For step 12:
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirup
- player1 is at pos54
- stone1 is at pos44
- pos34 is clear
- player1 can move from pos54 to pos44 following dirup (valid move)
- stone1 can move from pos44 to pos34 following dirup (valid move)
- pos34 is not a goal location
After the action, player1 is at pos44 and stone1 is at pos34.

For step 19:
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirleft
- player1 is at pos35
- stone1 is at pos34
- pos33 is clear
- player1 can move from pos35 to pos34 following dirleft (valid move)
- stone1 can move from pos34 to pos33 following dirleft (valid move)
- pos33 is not a goal location
After the action, player1 is at pos34 and stone1 is at pos33.

For step 22:
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright
- player1 is at pos23
- stone1 is at pos33
- pos43 is clear
- player1 can move from pos23 to pos33 following dirright (valid move)
- stone1 can move from pos33 to pos43 following dirright (valid move)
- pos43 is not a goal location
After the action, player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos43.

For step 23:
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirright
- player1 is at pos33
- stone1 is at pos43
- pos53 is clear
- player1 can move from pos33 to pos43 following dirright (valid move)
- stone1 can move from pos43 to pos53 following dirright (valid move)
- pos53 is a goal location
After the action, player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos53.

The pushto... actions seem to be correctly formulated. The rest of the plan looks valid as well.

Now, let's see if the entire plan is optimal (or at least close to optimal). 

The goal is to move the stone to a goal location (pos53). Without any constraints, an optimal plan would be to directly position the player to push the stone to its trajectory to the goal. However, with all the constraints, we may need to make some detours.

Given the constraints, the player must visit pos14, pos11 (after being at pos14), pos41, pos52, and make pos51 not clear. Additionally, pos24 must be not clear after the stone has been at pos34 or pos35. These constraints add overhead to the basic plan.

After revisiting the plan, taking into account the constraints, the plan proposed above is at most 23 actions and is likely close to optimal.

Let me address one more potential issue. Constraint 4 states: "The following expression must hold in at most one continuous sequence of states: "Location pos55 is not clear"". In the original state, pos55 is clear. Our plan does not involve making pos55 not clear, so this constraint is satisfied. All other constraints are also satisfied by the plan.

So, the final optimal plan is:

1. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
2. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
3. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
4. move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup
5. move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright
6. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
7. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
8. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
9. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
10. move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
11. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirup
13. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
14. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
15. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
16. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
17. move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown
18. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright
19. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirleft
20. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
21. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
22. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright
23. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirright
