**Explanation:**

1. **Move to pos14**: Satisfies the constraint requiring the agent to be at pos14 in some state. Later, the stone is moved to pos52 (step 14), fulfilling the conditional constraint linked to pos14.

2. **Push stone to pos54**: Using pos34, the agent pushes the stone to pos54 (non-goal). This keeps pos45 clear and positions the stone for the final push.

3. **Navigate to pos41**: Directly satisfies the constraint requiring the agent to visit pos41.

4. **Trigger pos51 occupancy**: Moving through pos51 makes it non-clear, satisfying another constraint.

5. **Final push to pos53**: By moving to pos54 (temporarily making pos55 clear except for one sequence) and pushing up to the goal pos53, all primary objectives and constraints are met, including pos24 being non-clear earlier when the stone was at pos34.
