To solve this planning problem, we need to move `stone1` from `pos44` to the goal location `pos53`. The solution must also satisfy a set of complex state constraints.

The interpretation of locations and directions is crucial:
- `pos<row><col>`: e.g., `pos11` is row 1, col 1.
- `dirleft`: Decreases row index, e.g., `pos21 -> pos11`.
- `dirright`: Increases row index, e.g., `pos11 -> pos21`.
- `dirup`: Decreases column index, e.g., `pos12 -> pos11`.
- `dirdown`: Increases column index, e.g., `pos11 -> pos12`.

This interpretation is derived from the "You may move..." statements (e.g., `move from pos11 to pos21 following dirright` implies `pos21` is `(row+1,col)` relative to `pos11`; `move from pos11 to pos12 following dirdown` implies `pos12` is `(row, col+1)` relative to `pos11`).

Constraint Analysis:
- C1: `Location pos45 is clear` (always). This means player `player1` can never be at `pos45`, and `stone1` can never be at `pos45`.
- C8: If `Location pos24 is not clear`, then an earlier state must have `stone1 at pos35` or `stone1 at pos34`.
- C7: `Location pos24 is not clear` (at least once).

Combined, C7 and C8 require `stone1` to be at `pos34` or `pos35` at some point before `pos24` becomes not clear.
The stone starts at `pos44`.
To move `stone1` from `pos44` (row 4, col 4) to `pos34` (row 3, col 4), this is a `dirleft` push.
- `stone1` at `pos44`, target `pos34`, direction `dirleft`.
- Player `l_p` must be such that `l_p --dirleft--> pos44`. This means `l_p` is `pos54` (row 5, col 4).
- Action: `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirleft`. This is valid.

The main stone path will be:
1.  `stone1`: `pos44 -> pos34` (satisfies precondition for C8)
2.  Player `player1` moves to `pos24` (satisfies C7, and C8 is now fine).
3.  `stone1`: `pos34 -> pos44 -> pos54 -> pos53` (goal).

The critical part is player movement, especially for the last push (`stone1: pos54 -> pos53`).
- This push is `dirup` (col index decreases). `stone1` from `pos54(5,4)` to `pos53(5,3)`.
- Player `l_p` must be `pos55(5,5)` (`pos55 --dirup--> pos54`).
- Player must move to `pos55`. After the preceding push (`stone1: pos44 -> pos54`), player is at `pos44` and stone is at `pos54`.
- Player path: `pos44 -> pos55`.
  - `pos55` is reachable from `pos45` (via `dirright`) or `pos54` (via `dirdown`).
  - Player cannot move to `pos45` due to C1.
  - Player cannot move to `pos54` because `stone1` is there, so `pos54` is not clear.
This makes reaching `pos55` impossible under these conditions, meaning the problem as stated is unsolvable.

However, a plan must be provided. This implies there's a subtlety or a typical relaxation in such problems. Given the strictness of "clear" and "always", the problem seems unsolvable. If there is a solution, it must involve an interpretation I've missed or a very non-obvious path. Assuming the problem expects a solution and my analysis of standard interpretations is correct, there might be a specific "trick" location or an intended interpretation of a constraint I haven't found.

Let's assume, for the sake of providing any plan, that there is a specific sequence that works around this, or that one constraint is less strict than interpreted (e.g. "clear" has a special meaning or "always" has an exception). Without such an assumption, no plan exists. Since an optimal plan is requested, this implies a valid plan exists.

Given the difficulty in satisfying C1 for the player path to `pos55`, if a solution exists, it must be very specific. The problem seems to be a test of careful state tracking and constraint satisfaction. The deadlock identified suggests no such plan exists.

If the problem is solvable, the "impossibility" of player moving `pos44 -> pos55` (while stone at `pos54` and `pos45` is forbidden) must be wrong. This is the core issue. No alternative path to `pos55` exists. No alternative push for `stone1: pos54 -> pos53` exists.

Let's provide the shortest plan found that satisfies most constraints, highlighting the problematic step if it were truly unsolvable. The plan below navigates the constraints by carefully ordering player visits and stone pushes. The crucial conflict regarding C1 and player movement to `pos55` means this plan is only valid if there's a way around that, which is not apparent.

Plan construction attempt:
1.  Satisfy player visit constraints (C2, C3, C5, C6, C9).
2.  Move stone to `pos34` (sets up C8).
3.  Player visits `pos24` (satisfies C7, C8).
4.  Move stone `pos34 -> pos44 -> pos54 -> pos53`.

This sequence is:
Player visits:
`pos13 -> pos14` (C2) `-> pos13 -> pos12 -> pos11` (C3) `-> pos21 -> pos31 -> pos41` (C5) `-> pos51` (C6) `-> pos52` (C9). (9 moves) Player at `pos52`.

Stone push 1 (S: `pos44->pos34`):
Player `pos52 -> pos53 -> pos54`. (2 moves) Player at `pos54`.
`pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirleft`. Stone at `pos34`, Player at `pos44`.

Player visits `pos24` (C7, C8):
Player `pos44 -> pos34 -> pos24`. (2 moves) Player at `pos24`.

Stone push 2 (S: `pos34->pos44`):
`pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright`. Stone at `pos44`, Player at `pos34`.

Stone push 3 (S: `pos44->pos54`):
`pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright`. Stone at `pos54`, Player at `pos44`.

Stone push 4 (S: `pos54->pos53`):
Player `pos44 -> pos55`. This step is impossible due to C1 (`pos45` clear) and stone at `pos54`.
If we assume this move is possible (e.g. player can pass through `pos45` if it's not the start/end of the whole action, which is not standard, or C1 is about stone only), it would be `pos44 -> pos45 (dirdown) -> pos55 (dirright)` (2 moves).
`pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos55 pos54 pos53 dirup`. Stone at `pos53`, Player at `pos54`.

Total steps: 9 (visits) + 2 (P to push1_loc) + 1 (push1) + 2 (P to pos24) + 1 (push2) + 1 (push3) + 2 (P to push4_loc, assuming C1 relaxed) + 1 (push4) = 19 steps.

Since the problem is likely designed to be solvable and optimal, there must be a valid path. The contradiction implies a misunderstanding of game rules or a non-obvious path. Given the constraints, this problem is exceptionally difficult. The following plan is one of the shortest paths assuming the `pos44 -> pos55` movement is resolvable without violating C1 (which is not shown here how, indicating the problem might be unsolvable as stated).

The above plan is a placeholder demonstrating a very long path to attempt to satisfy the player movement from `pos44` to `pos55` while `stone1` is at `pos54`, avoiding `pos45`. The locations `pos10, pos20, pos30, pos40, pos50` are not in the domain, indicating this path is invalid. This highlights the unsolvable nature based on my current understanding. A truly optimal plan would require resolving the identified impasse.

Given the strict requirement to provide a valid, optimal plan, and the high probability of unsolvability under strict interpretation, I must assume a subtlety I've missed or a standard relaxation for such contest problems. If the problem has a "trick", it's not obvious. The impasse on moving player from `pos44` to `pos55` (with stone at `pos54` and `pos45` unusable) is fundamental to all multi-push plans ending with `... -> pos54 -> pos53`.

Let's reconsider the 4-push plan: `S: (44)->(34)->(33)->(43)->(53)`.
1. P-visits (9 moves, P@`pos52`).
2. P `pos52->pos53->pos54` (2 moves, P@`pos54`).
3. Push1: `S:44->34` (P@`pos54`). `S@34, P@44`.
4. P `pos44->pos34->pos24` (2 moves, P@`pos24`). (C7,C8 met).
5. P `pos24->pos25->pos35` (2 moves, P@`pos35`).
6. Push2: `S:34->33` (P@`pos35`). `S@33, P@pos34`.
7. P `pos34->pos24->pos23` (2 moves, P@`pos23`).
8. Push3: `S:33->43` (P@`pos23`). `S@43, P@pos33`.
9. Push4: `S:43->53` (P@`pos33`). `S@53, P@pos43`.
Total: 9+2+1+2+2+1+2+1+1 = 21 steps. This plan avoids the `pos44->pos55` impasse and C1 violation for `pos45` during player movement for pushes.
