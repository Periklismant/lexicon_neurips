Okay, let's try to figure out this planning problem. So, the goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. The only goal location mentioned is pos24. So, we need to move stone1 from pos43 to pos24.

First, let's look at the constraints because they might affect the plan. The constraints are:

1. Location pos43 is not clear in at most one continuous sequence. So, pos43 can't be blocked for more than a single continuous period. Since stone1 starts at pos43, once we move it, pos43 becomes clear. So maybe this isn't a big issue as long as we don't have other things blocking it again.

2. The agent (player1) must be at pos24 in at least one state. Also, pos24 must not be clear in at least one state. Since pos24 is a goal location, once stone1 is there, pos24 won't be clear. So when we push stone1 to pos24, that should satisfy both conditions.

3. If pos24 is not clear (i.e., stone1 is there), then earlier the agent must have been at pos55. So before we can push stone1 to pos24, the agent needs to have visited pos55 at some point. That's a tricky constraint. So the plan must include the agent moving to pos55 before pos24 is occupied.

4. Stone1 must be at pos23 in some state. So we need to move stone1 from pos43 to pos23 first, then to pos24? But wait, how? Because the agent can push stones. Let's think about the movement.

5. If stone1 is at pos23, then before that, either pos55 or pos13 was not clear. So before moving stone1 to pos23, we need to have either pos55 or pos13 occupied. Since initially pos13 and pos55 are clear, we need to make sure that in the plan, before moving stone1 to pos23, one of these locations is occupied.

6. At least one state must have stone1 at pos13 or pos14 not clear. So maybe when moving stone1 around, we can pass through pos13, or have something block pos14.

7. The agent must be at pos22 in some state. Also, if they are at pos22, then pos12 must not be clear either at that state or later. Since pos12 is initially clear, we need to make sure that after being at pos22, pos12 becomes blocked. Maybe by moving a stone there, but we only have stone1. Wait, but stone1 needs to end up at pos24. So perhaps the agent pushes stone1 through pos23 to pos24, and then later moves to pos22, but how does pos12 become not clear? Unless the agent moves something else there, but there's only stone1. Hmm, maybe we need to use the agent's own position. Wait, when the agent is at a location, it's not clear. So if the agent moves to pos12 after being at pos22, then pos12 becomes not clear. But the constraint says that if the agent is at pos22 in state s, then pos12 must be not clear in s or a subsequent state. So maybe after moving to pos22, the agent moves to pos12, making pos12 not clear. That would satisfy the constraint.

8. The agent must be at pos53 in some state, and if they are, then pos15 must not be clear either then or later. Again, pos15 is initially clear. So after being at pos53, the agent needs to make pos15 not clear. But pos15 is a non-goal location, and the only stone is stone1. So unless the agent moves stone1 there, but stone1 is supposed to end at pos24. Alternatively, the agent can move to pos15 themselves, making it not clear. So maybe after visiting pos53, the agent moves to pos15.

But the agent starts at pos33. Let's outline the steps.

First, the agent needs to push stone1 from pos43 to pos24. But the constraints require that before pos24 is occupied, the agent was at pos55. Also, stone1 must be at pos23 at some point. Let's see the path from pos43 to pos24.

pos43 is where stone1 is. The agent starts at pos33. To push the stone from pos43, the agent needs to be adjacent. So pos43 is at row4, column3. The agent is at pos33 (row3, column3). So pos33 is adjacent to pos43 via direction dirright? Wait, according to the movement allowed:

Looking at the movement rules, from pos33, you can move to pos23 (dirleft), pos43 (dirright), pos32 (dirup), pos34 (dirdown). So the agent is at pos33, which is connected to pos43 via dirright. So the agent can move to pos43, but pos43 is occupied by stone1. Wait, the move action requires that the destination is clear. So the agent can't move into pos43 because it's occupied by stone1. So to push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. So the agent needs to be at pos33, and stone1 is at pos43. To push the stone, the agent must be at a position adjacent to the stone. So in this case, pos33 is adjacent to pos43 (since moving dirright from pos33 gets to pos43). So the agent can perform a push action from pos33 (l_p) to pos43 (l_from) to l_to.

Wait, the pushtogoal action requires that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (stone's current location) in direction d. Then, the stone is pushed from l_from to l_to in direction d. So for example, if the agent is at pos33, stone is at pos43. So to push the stone down to pos44, direction dirdown. But pos44 needs to be clear. Alternatively, pushing it left to pos42, but that's non-goal. But the goal is pos24, which is a goal location.

Wait, but the stone needs to end at pos24, which is a goal. So the final action should be a pushtogoal action moving stone1 to pos24.

But there's a constraint that stone1 must be at pos23 at some point. So maybe the path is pos43 -> pos33 -> pos23 -> pos24? Wait, but how? Because pos43 is at row4, column3. To get to pos24 (row2, column4), the stone needs to move up and right. Let's think.

Alternatively, maybe the agent pushes the stone from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown), then to pos54 (dirright?), but that's getting further. Hmm.

Alternatively, the agent can push the stone up. From pos43, moving up (dirup) would require the agent to be at pos42 (since pushing from pos42 to pos43 to pos44? Wait, no. Let me clarify the directions.

Wait, directions are dirup, dirdown, dirleft, dirright. The movement directions are based on the grid. For example, moving from pos33 to pos43 is dirright (assuming columns increase to the right). Wait, perhaps the grid is arranged such that pos11 is top-left, pos15 is top-right, pos51 is bottom-left, pos55 is bottom-right. So rows increase down, columns increase right. So moving right would be same row, next column. Moving down would be next row, same column.

So pos33 is row3, column3. pos43 is row4, column3. So to move from pos33 to pos43 is dirdown (since row increases by 1). Wait, no. Wait, the movement from pos33 to pos43 is dirright? Wait, looking at the given movement connections:

In the original state, one of the movement possibilities is:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"

Wait, that's strange. pos33 is (3,3), pos43 is (4,3). So moving down would be dirdown. But according to the given movement, moving from pos33 to pos43 is dirright. That's a bit confusing. So perhaps the directions are not aligned as expected. For example, moving from pos33 to pos43 is dirright. That would mean that direction dirright corresponds to moving down a row? Maybe the grid is laid out differently. Alternatively, the directions might be named differently. This is critical to get right.

Looking at the movement from pos33:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos32 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos34 following direction dirdown"

Wait, pos33 to pos23 is dirleft. pos23 is row2, column3. So dirleft from pos33 is moving up a row. Similarly, dirright from pos33 is moving down to pos43. So in this grid, dirleft and dirright correspond to moving up and down, while dirup and dirdown correspond to left and right? That seems odd, but given the movement directions, that's how it's structured. For example:

From pos33, moving dirleft takes you to pos23 (row2, same column), which is up. Moving dirright takes you to pos43 (row4, same column), which is down. Then moving dirup would take you to pos32 (same row, column2), and dirdown to pos34 (same row, column4). So the directions are a bit different. So dirleft/right are for row changes (up/down), and dirup/down are for column changes (left/right). That's a bit counterintuitive, but that's how the movement is defined here.

So, to move from pos33 to pos43, direction is dirright. To push the stone at pos43, the agent needs to be at pos43's adjacent tile in the direction opposite to the push. Wait, no. For the push action, the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (stone's current position) in direction d. Then, the stone is pushed from l_from to l_to, which is in the same direction d. So, for example, if the agent is at pos33 (l_p), and the stone is at pos43 (l_from), and direction d is dirright (since moving from pos33 to pos43 is dirright), then pushing the stone in direction dirright would take it to pos53 (since pos43 dirright is pos44? Wait no, pos43's movement options:

Looking at the movement from pos43:

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos42 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos44 following direction dirdown"

So, from pos43, dirright takes you to pos53 (same row, column5?). Wait, pos43 is row4, column3. dirright would be moving to column4? Wait, perhaps the columns are numbered from 1 to 5, and moving dirright increases the column number. So pos43 is row4, column3. dirright would take to column4, so pos44. But according to the movement from pos43:

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright"

Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, maybe the directions are different. For example, dirright from pos43 leads to pos53, which is row5, column3? No, pos53 is row5, column3. Wait, maybe the movement is not grid-based as I thought. Alternatively, perhaps the movement directions are not aligned with rows and columns as expected. This is critical to get right.

Looking at the movement from pos43:

- move to pos33 (dirleft)
- move to pos53 (dirright)
- move to pos42 (dirup)
- move to pos44 (dirdown)

Wait, pos42 is row4, column2. pos44 is row4, column4. So dirup from pos43 (row4, column3) is to pos42 (column2?), but that's left. So perhaps dirup and dirdown correspond to left and right in terms of columns, and dirleft and dirright correspond to up and down in rows.

This is a bit confusing. Let's take another example: from pos22, you can move to pos12 (dirleft), pos32 (dirright), pos21 (dirup), pos23 (dirdown). So pos12 is row1, column2 (up), pos32 is row3, column2 (down), pos21 is row2, column1 (left), pos23 is row2, column3 (right). So:

- dirleft: up (row decreases by 1)
- dirright: down (row increases by 1)
- dirup: left (column decreases by 1)
- dirdown: right (column increases by 1)

So the directions are:

- dirleft/right for row up/down
- dirup/down for column left/right

This is unconventional but based on the given movement rules. So, when moving in dirright, you increase the row number (move down), and dirleft decreases the row (move up). dirup decreases the column (left), dirdown increases the column (right).

So, for example, moving from pos33 (row3, column3):

- dirleft: row2, column3 → pos23
- dirright: row4, column3 → pos43
- dirup: row3, column2 → pos32
- dirdown: row3, column4 → pos34

This is important for planning the moves.

Now, stone1 is at pos43 (row4, column3). The goal is to move it to pos24 (row2, column4), which is a goal location.

So the path for the stone would be pos43 → ... → pos24.

Let's think about possible paths. Since pos24 is row2, column4, the stone needs to move up two rows (from row4 to row2) and right one column (from column3 to 4).

But how to push it there. Let's see:

From pos43 (row4, column3), possible directions:

- dirleft (up) to pos33 (row3, column3)
- dirright (down) to pos53 (row5, column3)
- dirup (left) to pos42 (row4, column2)
- dirdown (right) to pos44 (row4, column4)

But pos24 is row2, column4. So the stone needs to get to row2 and column4.

Let's consider pushing the stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft, up). So agent is at pos43's adjacent tile in direction d. Wait, no. To push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft), the agent must be at pos43's dirleft direction, which would be pos33. Wait, no. For a push action, the agent must be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (stone's position) in direction d. Then, the stone is pushed from l_from to l_to in direction d. So, if the agent is at pos33 (l_p), and the stone is at pos43 (l_from), and direction d is dirright (since moving from pos33 to pos43 is dirright), then pushing the stone in dirright would take it to pos53 (since from pos43, dirright is pos53). But pos53 is not a goal. Alternatively, pushing the stone dirup (left in columns) from pos43 would require the agent to be at pos42 (since dirup from pos43 is pos42). So if the agent is at pos42, they can push the stone from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown, which is right in columns). Wait, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the easiest way is to push the stone up (dirleft) from pos43 to pos33, then from pos33 to pos23, then to pos24. But pos24 is column4, so from pos23 (row2, column3), pushing dirdown (right in columns) to pos24 (row2, column4). That would work.

So the steps would be:

1. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft). Agent needs to be at pos43's dirleft direction, which is pos33. Wait, no. Wait, the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (pos43) in direction d. So to push the stone from pos43 in dirleft (up), the agent must be at the direction opposite to dirleft from pos43. Wait, no. The direction d is the direction from l_p to l_from. So for example, if the agent is at pos33 and wants to push the stone at pos43, the direction from pos33 to pos43 is dirright. So the agent is at pos33 (l_p), l_from is pos43, direction d is dirright. Then the stone is pushed in direction dirright (down) to pos53. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, if the agent is at pos43's dirup (left) direction, which is pos42. So agent is at pos42 (l_p), l_from is pos43, direction d is dirup. Then pushing the stone in direction dirup (left) would take it to pos42? No, that's the agent's position. Wait, no. When pushing, the stone moves from l_from to l_to in direction d. So if the agent is at pos42 (l_p), and the stone is at pos43 (l_from), direction d is dirup (from pos42 to pos43 is dirdown, since pos42 to pos43 is dirdown (right in columns). Wait, this is getting very confusing. Let's clarify.

The movement from pos42 to pos43 is dirdown (right in column). So if the agent is at pos42, and wants to push the stone at pos43, the direction d is dirdown (from pos42 to pos43). Then, pushing the stone in direction dirdown (right) would take it to pos44 (column4). But pos44 is a non-goal location. So pushtonongoal would be needed here.

Alternatively, if the agent is at pos33 (l_p), stone at pos43 (l_from), direction d is dirright (from pos33 to pos43). Then pushing the stone in dirright would take it to pos53 (row5, column3), which is non-goal. Not helpful.

Alternatively, the agent could move to pos44 and push the stone up. Wait, pos44 is to the right of pos43 (column4). So to push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft/up), the agent needs to be south of the stone? No, because pushing in dirleft (up) would require the agent to be north of the stone. Wait, no. If the agent is pushing the stone up (dirleft), the agent must be south of the stone (since dirleft is up in rows). So to push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft), the agent must be at pos53 (dirright of pos43), and push in dirleft? No, I'm getting mixed up.

Let me think of the push action structure. For "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d", the agent is at l_p, which is connected to l_from via direction d. So l_p → l_from via d. Then, the stone is pushed from l_from to l_to via the same direction d.

Wait, no. The movement from l_p to l_from is direction d. So for example, if the agent is at pos33 (l_p) and pushes the stone at pos43 (l_from) with direction d as dirright, that's because pos33 to pos43 is dirright. Then, the stone is pushed from pos43 in the same direction dirright, which would be to pos53. But pos53 is not a goal. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, the agent needs to get to a position where they can push the stone towards pos24.

Another approach: the stone is at pos43. To get it to pos24, we need to move it up two rows (dirleft twice) and right one column (dirdown once). But how to do that.

First, push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft). For that, the agent must be south of the stone (dirright direction). So agent is at pos43's south? Wait, pos43 is row4, column3. South would be row5, but there's pos53. Wait, no. To push the stone north (dirleft) from pos43 to pos33, the agent needs to be south of the stone (pos53) and push north. But the movement from pos53 to pos43 is dirleft (since moving from pos53 to pos43 is dirleft, as per the movement rules: "You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft". So to push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft), the agent must be at pos53, direction dirleft. Wait, no. The agent needs to be at a location l_p such that l_p can reach l_from (pos43) via direction d. So if the agent is at pos53, direction dirleft would take them to pos43. Then pushing the stone in dirleft would take it to pos33. So the action would be pushtogoal (if pos33 is a goal? No, pos33 is not a goal. So pushtonongoal.

But pos33 is not a goal, so pushing to pos33 would require using pushtonongoal. Then, from pos33, push the stone to pos23 (dirleft again), then from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown, which is right in column).

But let's check:

1. Agent starts at pos33. To push the stone at pos43, the agent needs to be at a position adjacent to pos43 via a direction. For example, pos33 is north of pos43 (dirright from pos33 to pos43). So if the agent is at pos33, they can push the stone south (dirright) to pos53. But pos53 is not a goal. Alternatively, the agent could move to pos43's east (dirdown direction, which is column4) but that's pos44. Wait, pos43's dirdown is pos44 (column4). So if the agent is at pos44, they can push the stone west (dirup) to pos43-1 column (pos42). But that's not helpful.

This seems complicated. Let's think about the required constraints.

The agent must visit pos55 at some point before pos24 is occupied. So the agent needs to go to pos55 first. How to get there from pos33?

The agent's path to pos55: from pos33, possible moves. Let's see:

From pos33, possible moves are:

- dirleft to pos23 (up)
- dirright to pos43 (down)
- dirup to pos32 (left)
- dirdown to pos34 (right)

To reach pos55, which is row5, column5. So the agent needs to move down (dirright) to row5 and right (dirdown) to column5.

From pos33:

1. Move dirright to pos43 (row4, column3)
2. From pos43, dirright to pos53 (row5, column3)
3. From pos53, dirdown to pos54 (column4)
4. From pos54, dirdown to pos55 (column5)

But during this movement, the agent must avoid the stone which is at pos43. Wait, initially, the agent is at pos33, stone1 is at pos43. So pos43 is occupied by the stone, so the agent can't move there unless they push the stone. But the agent can't move into a position occupied by a stone unless they are pushing it.

So to move to pos43, the agent would need to push the stone first. But the stone is at pos43, so the agent can't move there. So the initial plan to reach pos55 requires a different path.

Alternative route to pos55:

From pos33:

- Move dirdown (right) to pos34 (row3, column4)
- From pos34, dirright (down) to pos44 (row4, column4)
- From pos44, dirright (down) to pos54 (row5, column4)
- From pos54, dirdown (right) to pos55 (row5, column5)

But let's check if these moves are allowed.

Check movement from pos33 to pos34: pos33's dirdown is pos34 (column4). Yes, allowed.

From pos34 to pos44: dirright (down) from pos34 to pos44. Yes, movement is allowed: "You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright".

From pos44 to pos54: dirright (down) from pos44 to pos54. Yes, movement allowed: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright".

From pos54 to pos55: dirdown (right) to column5. Yes: "You may move from location pos54 to location pos55 following direction dirdown".

So this path is possible. But the agent needs to move through pos34, pos44, pos54 to pos55. But when moving from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown), pos34 is initially clear. Then move to pos34. Then to pos44, which is clear. Then to pos54, clear. Then to pos55. So the agent can reach pos55 via this path.

But while doing this, the stone is still at pos43. So after reaching pos55, the agent needs to go back and push the stone.

But there's a constraint that pos24 must be occupied only after the agent has been to pos55. So the agent must go to pos55 first, then proceed to push the stone to pos24.

But also, stone1 must be at pos23 at some point, which requires that before that, either pos55 or pos13 is not clear. Since pos55 is clear initially, but after the agent moves there, pos55 is not clear. So after the agent visits pos55, pos55 is not clear, which satisfies one of the conditions. So after the agent is at pos55, then moving the stone to pos23 would satisfy the constraint.

So the plan could be:

1. Agent moves from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown)
2. pos34 to pos44 (dirright)
3. pos44 to pos54 (dirright)
4. pos54 to pos55 (dirdown)
   Now agent is at pos55, satisfying the constraint that before pos24 is occupied, agent was at pos55.
5. Then, agent needs to return to the stone's location and push it.

But after moving to pos55, the agent needs to get back to the stone. But the stone is at pos43. Let's plan the return path.

From pos55:

- Move dirup (left) to pos54 (column4)
- From pos54, dirleft (up) to pos44 (row4, column4)
- From pos44, dirleft (up) to pos34 (row3, column4)
- From pos34, dirup (left) to pos33 (row3, column3) → but pos33 is clear now? Because the agent moved away. Wait, the initial state says pos33 is clear except for the agent. After the agent moves from pos33 to pos34, pos33 becomes clear. So yes, pos33 is clear.

But the stone is at pos43. So the agent needs to reach a position where they can push the stone.

Alternative return path from pos55 to pos43:

pos55 → pos54 (dirup)
pos54 → pos44 (dirleft)
pos44 → pos43 (dirup? pos44's dirup is pos43's column? Wait, pos44 is row4, column4. dirup is column3? Or dirup is left in column. So from pos44, dirup would be to pos43 (column3? No. pos44's dirup (left) is column3, so pos43? Wait, pos44 is row4, column4. dirup (left) would be column3, same row → pos43? No, pos43 is row4, column3. So yes. From pos44, dirup (left) is pos43. So movement from pos44 to pos43 is dirup.

So:

5. pos55 → pos54 (dirup)
6. pos54 → pos44 (dirleft)
7. pos44 → pos43 (dirup)
   But pos43 has the stone. So the agent can't move there unless they push the stone.

Ah, right. The stone is at pos43. So when the agent is at pos44, they can attempt to push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft) by being at pos44 and using dirup to reach pos43. Wait, no. The agent is at pos44, and wants to push the stone at pos43. The direction from pos44 to pos43 is dirup (left). So the agent is at pos44 (l_p), l_from is pos43, direction d is dirup. Then, pushing the stone in direction dirup (left) would take it to pos42 (since from pos43, dirup is left to column2, pos42). But pos42 is a non-goal location. So the action would be pushtonongoal.

But pushing the stone to pos42 would move it away from the goal. Not helpful. Alternatively, the agent could push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft) by being at pos53. Let's see:

From pos55, the agent needs to get to pos53 to push the stone north. So path from pos55 to pos53:

pos55 → pos54 (dirup)
pos54 → pos53 (dirup)
pos53 → pos43 (dirleft)
But pos43 has the stone. So the agent can't move there. So agent is at pos53, which is clear. Then, they can push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft). So the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirleft

Because pos33 is not a goal location. This action requires:

- agent at pos53
- stone at pos43
- pos33 is clear (initially, yes, since agent was at pos33 but moved away)
- direction from pos53 to pos43 is dirleft (since pos53 to pos43 is dirleft)
- direction from pos43 to pos33 is dirleft (yes)
- pos33 is non-goal (correct)

After this action:

- agent moves from pos53 to pos43 (but wait, no. The effect is: agent is no longer at pos53 (l_p), stone is no longer at pos43, pos33 is occupied by stone, agent is now at pos43.

Wait, the effects of pushtonongoal:

(i) agent is no longer at l_p (pos53)
(ii) stone is no longer at l_from (pos43)
(iii) l_to (pos33) is no longer clear
(iv) agent is at l_from (pos43)
(v) stone is at l_to (pos33)
(vi) l_p (pos53) is clear
(vii) stone is at non-goal (pos33 is non-goal)

So after this action, the stone is at pos33, and the agent is at pos43.

This would satisfy the constraint that stone1 is at pos23 in some state. Wait, no. After this push, stone1 is at pos33. Then, the agent can push it to pos23 (dirleft).

So steps:

8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirleft
   Now stone is at pos33, agent at pos43.

9. Then, agent needs to push the stone from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft). For that, agent needs to be south of pos33 (pos43) and push dirleft (up). So the action would be pushtonongoal again:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft

Preconditions:

- agent at pos43 (yes)
- stone at pos33 (yes)
- pos23 clear (initially yes)
- direction from pos43 to pos33 is dirleft (yes)
- direction from pos33 to pos23 is dirleft (yes)
- pos23 is non-goal (yes)

After this action:

- agent moves to pos33
- stone moves to pos23

Now, stone is at pos23. This satisfies the constraint that stone1 must be at pos23 in some state. Also, before this, the agent was at pos55 (step 4), which makes pos55 not clear, satisfying the constraint that before stone1 is at pos23, pos55 was not clear.

Then, the agent needs to push the stone from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown, right in column). Since pos24 is a goal, this would be a pushtogoal action.

But to do that, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos23 in the direction of the push. pos23 is at row2, column3. To push it to pos24 (row2, column4), direction is dirdown (right in column). So the agent must be at pos22 (column2) to push east (dirdown).

Wait, pos23's dirdown is pos24. So to push from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown), the agent must be west of pos23 (pos22) and push east (dirdown). So the agent needs to be at pos22 (l_p), push the stone from pos23 (l_from) to pos24 (l_to) with direction dirdown.

But currently, the agent is at pos33 after step9. Wait, after step9, the agent is at pos33. Because after pushing from pos43 to pos33, the agent ends up at pos33. Wait, no. Let me recheck the effects of pushtonongoal.

After performing pushtonongoal:

- agent is no longer at pos53 (l_p)
- stone is no longer at pos43 (l_from)
- pos33 (l_to) is no longer clear
- agent is now at pos43 (l_from)
- stone is at pos33 (l_to)
- pos53 (l_p) is clear

Wait, no. The effects of pushtonongoal are:

(i) agent is no longer at l_p (pos53)
(ii) stone is no longer at l_from (pos43)
(iii) l_to (pos33) is no longer clear
(iv) agent is at l_from (pos43)
(v) stone is at l_to (pos33)
(vi) l_p (pos53) is clear
(vii) stone is at non-goal.

So after step8, agent is at pos43 (l_from), stone at pos33.

Then, step9: pushing from pos33 to pos23.

To do this, the agent must be adjacent to pos33 in the direction of the push. The direction is dirleft (up) to pos23. So the agent needs to be south of pos33 (pos43) to push dirleft (up). So from pos43, the agent can push pos33 to pos23 dirleft.

So the action is pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft.

Preconditions:

- agent at pos43 (yes)
- stone at pos33 (yes)
- pos23 clear (yes)
- direction from pos43 to pos33 is dirleft (no. pos43 to pos33 is dirleft? Let's check movement directions.

From pos43, you can move to pos33 via dirleft. Yes: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft".

So direction d is dirleft. So pushing from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft). So l_p is pos43, l_from is pos33, l_to is pos23, d is dirleft.

Preconditions met:

- agent at pos43 (yes)
- stone at pos33 (yes)
- pos23 clear (yes)
- can move from pos43 to pos33 via dirleft (yes)
- can move from pos33 to pos23 via dirleft (yes)
- pos23 is non-goal (yes)

After this action:

- agent moves to pos33
- stone moves to pos23
- pos43 becomes clear

Now, stone is at pos23. This satisfies the constraint.

Next step: push the stone from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown, which is east/right in column). pos24 is a goal, so pushtogoal.

To push from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown), the agent must be west of pos23 (pos22) and push east (dirdown). So the agent needs to be at pos22 (l_p), stone at pos23 (l_from), direction d is dirdown (from pos22 to pos23 is dirdown).

But currently, the agent is at pos33. So how to get to pos22.

Path from pos33 to pos22:

From pos33, possible moves:

- dirleft to pos23 (up)
- dirright to pos43 (down)
- dirup to pos32 (left)
- dirdown to pos34 (right)

To reach pos22:

pos33 → pos23 (dirleft)
pos23 → pos22 (dirup)
But pos23 has the stone. So agent can't move to pos23 unless they push it.

Wait, after step9, the agent is at pos33 (since after pushing from pos33 to pos23, the agent moves to pos33? Wait, no. Let's check the effects of step9's action:

After pushtonongoal from pos43 to pos33 to pos23:

- agent is no longer at pos43 (l_p)
- stone is no longer at pos33 (l_from)
- pos23 (l_to) is not clear
- agent is now at pos33 (l_from)
- stone is at pos23 (l_to)
- pos43 (l_p) is clear
- stone is non-goal.

Wait, no. The action is pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d.

In this case, l_p is pos43 (agent's initial position), l_from is pos33 (stone's initial position), l_to is pos23.

Wait, no. Wait, the action is "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft".

So l_p is pos43 (agent's position before action), l_from is pos33 (stone's position), l_to is pos23.

But to perform this action, the agent must be at pos43 (l_p), stone at pos33 (l_from), and direction from pos43 to pos33 is dirleft. Yes.

After performing the action:

- agent is no longer at pos43 (l_p)
- stone is no longer at pos33 (l_from)
- pos23 (l_to) is no longer clear
- agent is now at pos33 (l_from)
- stone is at pos23 (l_to)
- pos43 (l_p) is clear
- stone is at non-goal.

So after this action, the agent is at pos33, stone at pos23.

Now, to push the stone from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown), the agent needs to be at pos22 (l_p), stone at pos23 (l_from), direction d is dirdown (from pos22 to pos23).

So the agent needs to move from pos33 to pos22.

Path from pos33 to pos22:

From pos33:

- dirup to pos32 (left)
- pos32 to pos22 (dirleft)
So:

10. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
11. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft

Now, agent is at pos22. This satisfies the constraint that agent must be at pos22 in some state.

Now, perform the pushtogoal action:

12. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown

Check preconditions:

- agent at pos22 (yes)
- stone at pos23 (yes)
- pos24 is clear (initially yes)
- direction from pos22 to pos23 is dirdown (yes: pos22 to pos23 is dirdown)
- direction from pos23 to pos24 is dirdown (yes: pos23 to pos24 is dirdown)
- pos24 is a goal (yes)

Effects:

- agent moves to pos23
- stone moves to pos24
- pos24 is now occupied by stone1 (goal achieved)
- pos22 becomes clear
- stone is at goal.

This action satisfies the goal.

Now, check constraints:

- pos24 is not clear after this action, which satisfies one of the constraints.
- agent was at pos55 earlier (step4), satisfying the requirement that before pos24 is not clear, agent was at pos55.
- agent was at pos22 (step11-12), and after that, pos12 must not be clear. Since pos12 is initially clear, but after the agent is at pos22, they need to move to pos12 or have something else there. Wait, the constraint says that if the agent is at pos22 in state s, then pos12 must not be clear in s or later. So after step11, agent is at pos22. They then perform step12 (pushtogoal), which moves them to pos23. After that, pos12 is still clear. So to satisfy the constraint, the agent must later make pos12 not clear. How? Since the only stone is now at pos24, the agent can move to pos12, making it not clear. So after step12, the agent can move to pos12.

But do we need to? The constraint says that if agent is at pos22 in state s, then pos12 is not clear in s or later. So after being at pos22 (step11), in step12, the agent is at pos23. Then, perhaps the agent can move to pos12 later.

So after step12, the agent is at pos23. They can move to pos22 (step12's agent position is pos23). From pos23, move dirup to pos13 (dirleft?), no. Let's check movement from pos23:

From pos23, possible moves:

- dirleft to pos13 (up)
- dirright to pos33 (down)
- dirup to pos22 (left)
- dirdown to pos24 (right)

Wait, after step12, the agent is at pos23 (from the pushtogoal action). They can move dirup (left in column) to pos22 (same row, column2). Then from pos22, dirup (left in column) to pos21 (row2, column1). Not helpful. Alternatively, from pos23, move dirleft (up) to pos13. But how to get to pos12.

Alternatively, after step12, agent is at pos23. They can move to pos22 (dirup), then to pos12 (dirleft). Wait, pos22 to pos12 is dirleft (up in row). So:

13. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
14. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft

Now, pos12 is not clear because agent is there. This satisfies the constraint that after being at pos22, pos12 is not clear.

But this adds steps. However, the plan needs to be optimal (shortest possible). So perhaps there's a way to combine steps.

Alternatively, after step12 (agent at pos23), they can move to pos13 (dirleft), then to pos12 (dirup). But that's longer.

Alternatively, after step12, agent can move to pos22 (dirup), then to pos12 (dirleft). Steps 13 and 14. This makes pos12 not clear. But the constraint is satisfied.

But this adds steps. However, the problem requires an optimal plan. So perhaps there's a way to avoid these steps if the agent is already going to visit pos12 naturally.

Alternatively, during the plan, after step12, the agent is at pos23. The goal is achieved (stone1 at pos24). The constraints may already be satisfied. Let's check all constraints:

Constraints:

1. pos43 is not clear in at most one continuous sequence. When the agent pushes the stone from pos43 to pos33 (step8), pos43 becomes clear. So the only time pos43 is not clear is when the stone is there initially. So that's one continuous sequence (from initial state until step8). So this is okay.

2. player1 is at pos24 in some state. After step12, the agent is at pos23. So this is not satisfied. Wait, no. The pushtogoal action's effect is that the agent moves to l_from (pos23) after pushing. So after step12, agent is at pos23. To get to pos24, the agent can move there. But pos24 is occupied by the stone. So they can't move there. So to satisfy the constraint that player1 is at pos24, they need to move there before the stone is placed. But pos24 is a goal location, so when the stone is placed there, pos24 is occupied. So agent can't move there after. So the only way for the agent to be at pos24 is before the stone is there. But that's impossible because the stone is placed there in step12. So perhaps the constraint is that pos24 is not clear in some state, which happens when the stone is there. But the agent can't be at pos24. Wait, the constraint says "player1 is at location pos24" must hold in at least one state. But after the stone is at pos24, the agent can't be there. So the agent must be at pos24 before the stone is placed there. But how?

This is a problem. The constraint requires the agent to be at pos24 in some state, but pos24 is a goal location for the stone. So the agent must visit pos24 before step12. But how?

Wait, the agent's path to pos24 would require moving there before the stone is placed. Let's think:

After step4, agent is at pos55. Then, they need to return to the stone. But perhaps on the way back, they can visit pos24.

Alternative plan:

After step4 (agent at pos55), they need to go back. But to reach pos24, the agent could take a different route.

For example:

From pos55:

5. pos55 → pos54 (dirup)
6. pos54 → pos44 (dirleft)
7. pos44 → pos34 (dirleft)
8. pos34 → pos24 (dirleft)

Now agent is at pos24. This satisfies the constraint that player1 is at pos24. Then, from pos24, proceed to push the stone.

But this would require adjusting the plan. However, this adds steps. Also, the constraint requires that if pos24 is not clear (when the stone is there), then agent must have been at pos55 earlier. But in this case, the agent was at pos55 before pos24 is not clear, which is okay.

But this approach requires the agent to visit pos24 before the stone is there. So steps would be:

1-4: same as before (agent reaches pos55)
5-8: move to pos24
9. Then, move to pos43 to push the stone.

But this seems complicated. Let's re-express the plan with this in mind.

But this may not be optimal. Let's think again.

The original plan steps:

1. Move from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown)
2. pos34 to pos44 (dirright)
3. pos44 to pos54 (dirright)
4. pos54 to pos55 (dirdown)
5. pos55 to pos54 (dirup)
6. pos54 to pos44 (dirleft)
7. pos44 to pos34 (dirleft)
8. pos34 to pos24 (dirleft) → agent at pos24, satisfying the constraint
9. pos24 to pos23 (dirup)
10. pos23 to pos33 (dirright)
11. pos33 to pos43 (dirright)
12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos33 dirleft → wait, no. The stone is at pos43.

This is getting too tangled. Let's try to find a way to have the agent visit pos24 before pushing the stone there.

Alternatively, after reaching pos55 (step4), the agent returns via pos24.

Path from pos55 to pos24:

pos55 → pos54 (dirup)
pos54 → pos44 (dirleft)
pos44 → pos34 (dirleft)
pos34 → pos24 (dirleft)

So steps5-8: agent moves to pos24. Now, agent is at pos24. This satisfies the constraint.

Then, from pos24, agent needs to get to the stone's location. The stone is at pos43. Path from pos24 to pos43:

pos24 → pos34 (dirright)
pos34 → pos44 (dirright)
pos44 → pos43 (dirup)

But pos43 is occupied by the stone. So agent can't move there. So agent needs to push the stone.

So after reaching pos24 (step8), agent moves to pos34, then to pos44, then to pos43 (dirup). But pos43 is occupied by stone. So agent can't move there. So agent must push the stone from pos43.

Alternatively, agent is at pos44, and pushes the stone from pos43 to pos33.

But this requires the same steps as before. So after visiting pos24 (step8), agent continues to pos44, then pushes the stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft).

But this would require:

9. pos24 → pos34 (dirright)
10. pos34 → pos44 (dirright)
11. pos44 → pos43 (dirup) → but can't move there. So instead, from pos44, push the stone at pos43 to pos33.

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos33 dirup

But direction from pos44 to pos43 is dirup (left in column). So pushing dirup (left) would take the stone to pos42 (column2). Not helpful.

Alternatively, pushing dirleft (up) from pos43 would require the agent to be south of pos43 (pos53), which they are not.

This approach is getting too complicated. Let's revert to the original plan and see how to satisfy the agent being at pos24.

In the original plan, after step12, the agent is at pos23. The constraint requires that the agent must be at pos24 in some state. But in that plan, the agent never visits pos24. So this plan is invalid.

Thus, the original plan is missing a crucial step. We need to insert a step where the agent visits pos24.

So after step4 (agent at pos55), steps5-8 should include moving to pos24.

Let's adjust the plan:

1. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
2. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
3. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
4. move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown → agent at pos55 (satisfies constraint)
5. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
6. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft
7. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
8. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft → agent at pos24 (satisfies constraint)
9. Now, agent needs to get to pos53 to push the stone from pos43 to pos33.

From pos24, possible moves:

- dirright (down) to pos34
- dirleft (up) to pos14
- dirup (left) to pos23
- dirdown (right) to pos25

To reach pos53, the agent needs to move down and right.

But this is getting too long. Perhaps after visiting pos24, the agent proceeds to pos34, then pos44, pos54, pos55 again, but this is not efficient.

Alternatively, from pos24, move to pos23 (dirup), but pos23 is clear initially. Then from pos23 to pos33 (dirright), then to pos43 (dirright). But pos43 has the stone.

Alternatively, from pos24, move to pos34 (dirright), then pos44 (dirright), then pos54 (dirright), then pos53 (dirup). Then push the stone from pos43 to pos33.

But this is a long path.

This indicates that the original plan was missing the step where the agent visits pos24, which is required by the constraints.

Thus, the correct plan must include a visit to pos24 by the agent, which adds steps.

But how to fit this into the optimal plan.

Alternative approach: The agent starts at pos33. They need to visit pos55, pos24, and pos53, and pos22, and pos53 again. This seems complicated.

But let's try:

1. move from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown)
2. pos34 to pos44 (dirright)
3. pos44 to pos54 (dirright)
4. pos54 to pos55 (dirdown) → agent at pos55 (constraint satisfied)
5. move back to pos54 (dirup)
6. pos54 to pos44 (dirleft)
7. pos44 to pos34 (dirleft)
8. pos34 to pos24 (dirleft) → agent at pos24 (constraint satisfied)
9. pos24 to pos23 (dirup)
10. pos23 to pos33 (dirright)
11. pos33 to pos43 (dirright)
   Now, agent is at pos43, but the stone is there. So they can't move there. So need to push.

But the stone is at pos43. So agent is at pos33 (step10). They can push the stone to pos53 (dirright).

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirright → this moves the stone to pos53.

But pos53 is non-goal. Then, the agent is at pos43.

But now, the stone is at pos53. To get it to pos24, we need a different path.

This is getting too long. Perhaps the optimal plan requires a different approach.

Alternative idea: Use the fact that the stone must be at pos23. So the agent pushes the stone from pos43 to pos33, then to pos23, then to pos24. But along the way, ensure that the agent visits pos55, pos24, etc.

But how to integrate the constraints.

Let me outline a possible plan step by step, considering all constraints:

1. Agent moves from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown)
2. pos34 to pos44 (dirright)
3. pos44 to pos54 (dirright)
4. pos54 to pos55 (dirdown) → agent at pos55 (satisfies constraint)
5. pos55 to pos54 (dirup)
6. pos54 to pos44 (dirleft)
7. pos44 to pos34 (dirleft)
8. pos34 to pos24 (dirleft) → agent at pos24 (satisfies constraint)
9. pos24 to pos23 (dirup)
10. pos23 to pos33 (dirright)
11. pos33 to pos43 (dirright)
    Now, agent is at pos43, but stone is there. Can't move. So push.

12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos33 dirleft → invalid, because stone is at pos43, agent can't be there.

Wait, no. Agent is at pos33, wants to push stone at pos43. So agent is at pos33, direction dirright (to pos43). So action:

12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirright → stone moves to pos53.

13. Then, agent needs to push stone from pos53 to pos43 (dirleft), but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, after step11, agent is at pos43, but can't push because stone is there.

This approach is not working. Let's think differently.

Alternative plan:

- Agent moves to pos55 first (steps 1-4).
- Then returns to push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (step5-8).
- Then pushes to pos23 (step9).
- Then pushes to pos24 (step10).
- Then agent moves to pos24 somehow.

Wait, but after step10, stone is at pos24, so agent can't move there. So how to get agent to pos24?

Maybe before pushing the stone to pos24, the agent must visit pos24. So:

After step4 (agent at pos55):

5. move to pos54 (dirup)
6. move to pos44 (dirleft)
7. move to pos34 (dirleft)
8. move to pos24 (dirleft) → agent at pos24 (constraint satisfied)
9. move to pos23 (dirup)
10. move to pos33 (dirright)
11. move to pos43 (dirright)
12. push stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft)
13. push stone from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft)
14. push stone from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown)

This way, agent visits pos24 in step8.

But after step8, the agent is at pos24, then moves to pos23, pos33, etc. Then pushes the stone to pos24. This way, the agent was at pos24 before the stone arrives.

This satisfies the constraint that agent is at pos24 in some state.

Now, check all constraints:

- pos43 is not clear only until step12 when the stone is pushed to pos33. So one continuous sequence.

- agent is at pos24 (step8).

- pos24 is not clear after step14 (stone is there).

- before pos24 is not clear (step14), agent was at pos55 (step4).

- stone is at pos23 (step13).

- before stone is at pos23 (step13), agent was at pos55 (step4), which makes pos55 not clear (agent was there), satisfying the condition that pos55 or pos13 was not clear.

- At least one state has stone1 at pos13 or pos14 not clear. Since stone is at pos23, pos33, pos43, pos53, pos24. Doesn't include pos13 or pos14. So this constraint is not met. So this plan is invalid.

So we need to ensure that in some state, either stone1 is at pos13 or pos14 is not clear.

So perhaps during the plan, the agent must visit pos13 or cause pos14 to be not clear.

But how? The only stone is stone1. To have pos14 not clear, either the agent or the stone must be there.

The agent can move to pos14, making it not clear. Or push the stone there.

But the stone needs to end at pos24. So pushing it to pos14 would be a detour.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos23 (step13), the agent can move to pos14.

But that adds steps. Let's see:

After step14, the stone is at pos24 (goal). The agent is at pos23. Then, agent can move to pos24 (but it's occupied by the stone), so can't. Instead, agent can move to pos13 via pos23 → pos13 (dirleft).

15. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft → agent at pos13. This makes pos13 not clear, satisfying the constraint that in some state, stone1 is at pos13 or pos14 is not clear. Since pos13 is not clear (agent is there), this satisfies the constraint.

Alternatively, if the agent visits pos14, making it not clear.

But this requires additional steps.

So in this plan:

Steps:

1. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
2. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
3. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
4. move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown → at pos55
5. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
6. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft
7. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
8. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft → at pos24
9. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
10. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
11. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos33 dirleft → invalid, agent is at pos43, stone at pos43. Can't push. Wait, no. The agent is at pos43, trying to push the stone at pos43. No, the stone is at pos43, and the agent is at pos43? No, the agent can't be at the same position as the stone. This indicates a mistake.

Ah, here's the problem. After step11, the agent is at pos43. But the stone is at pos43 initially. So step11's move to pos43 is impossible because the stone is there. The agent can't move into a location occupied by a stone unless pushing it.

So step11 is invalid. So the agent cannot move to pos43 unless pushing the stone.

Thus, the plan must be adjusted.

Correct approach:

After step10, agent is at pos33. To push the stone from pos43 to pos33, the agent must be at a position adjacent to pos43 in the direction of the push. Since the agent is at pos33, which is north of pos43, they can push the stone south (dirright) to pos53. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, the agent needs to be south of pos43 to push it north. So agent must move to pos53.

But how?

After step10, agent is at pos33. To get to pos53:

pos33 → pos43 (dirright)
But pos43 is occupied by the stone. So the agent can't move there. So agent must take a different path.

Alternative path from pos33 to pos53:

pos33 → pos34 (dirdown)
pos34 → pos44 (dirright)
pos44 → pos54 (dirright)
pos54 → pos53 (dirup)
But this is a long path. So steps:

11. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
12. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
13. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
14. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup → agent at pos53
15. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirleft → stone moves to pos33
16. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos23 dirleft → stone moves to pos23
17. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown → agent must be at pos22 to push

But after step16, agent is at pos33. To get to pos22:

18. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
19. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
20. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown → stone at pos24

Now, check constraints:

- pos43 is not clear until step15 when stone is moved to pos33. So one continuous sequence.

- agent is at pos24 in step8.

- pos24 is not clear after step20.

- before pos24 is not clear, agent was at pos55 (step4).

- stone is at pos23 in step16.

- before stone at pos23, agent was at pos55 (step4) → pos55 not clear.

- At least one state has stone1 at pos13 or pos14 not clear. Stone is never at pos13, and pos14 is clear unless agent moves there. So agent must move to pos14 or pos13.

After step20, agent is at pos23. They can move to pos13 (dirleft):

21. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft → pos13 not clear.

This satisfies the constraint.

Additionally, the agent must be at pos22 (step19) and pos53 (step14).

The constraint for pos22: after being there, pos12 must not be clear. So after step19, agent is at pos22. They can then move to pos12:

22. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft → pos12 not clear.

And the agent must be at pos53 (step14), after which they must ensure pos15 is not clear. So after step14, agent is at pos53. To satisfy the constraint, pos15 must be not clear either at step14 or later. So the agent can move to pos15:

23. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
24. move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown
25. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
26. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft
27. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
28. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
29. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft
30. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown → pos15 not clear.

But this adds many steps, making the plan non-optimal.

This indicates that satisfying all constraints requires a longer plan, but the problem states that the plan must be optimal (shortest possible).

Thus, there must be a more efficient way to satisfy all constraints without adding too many steps.

Let me try to find a shorter path:

1. Agent moves to pos55 to satisfy the constraint (steps 1-4).
2. On the way back, visit pos24 (step5-8).
3. Push stone from pos43 to pos33 (requires agent to go to pos53, push north).
4. Push to pos23, then to pos24.
5. Ensure agent visits pos22 and pos53, and makes pos12 and pos15 not clear.

But this is still complex.

Alternative approach:

Use the fact that when the agent pushes the stone to pos23, the agent is at pos33 (after pushing), and can then move to pos22 and pos12.

But let's outline:

Steps:

1. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
2. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
3. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
4. move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown → agent at pos55 (constraint met)
5. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
6. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft
7. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
8. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft → agent at pos24 (constraint met)
9. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup → agent at pos23
10. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright → agent at pos33
11. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright → agent at pos43 (can't, stone is there)
So invalid.

Alternative:

After step8 (agent at pos24), move to pos23, then to pos33, then to pos43 (invalid).

So instead, after step8, agent moves to pos34, then to pos44, then to pos53.

Steps:

9. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
10. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
11. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
12. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup → agent at pos53
13. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirleft → stone to pos33
14. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos23 dirleft → stone to pos23
15. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown → requires agent at pos22
16. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup → agent at pos22
17. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown → stone to pos24
18. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft → pos12 not clear (constraint met)
19. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown → agent at pos13 (satisfies constraint: stone1 is at pos13 or pos14 not clear. Agent at pos13 makes pos13 not clear)
20. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown → agent at pos14 (optional)
21. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown → agent at pos15 (satisfies constraint: after being at pos53 (step12), pos15 must be not clear)

But step12: agent is at pos53. So after step12, in step21, agent moves to pos15, making pos15 not clear.

This plan includes:

- Visiting pos55 (step4)
- Visiting pos24 (step8)
- Visiting pos22 (step16)
- Visiting pos53 (step12)
- pos12 not clear (step18)
- pos15 not clear (step21)
- pos13 not clear (step19)

This satisfies all constraints.

Now, let's count the steps:

1. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
2. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
3. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
4. move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown
5. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
6. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft
7. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
8. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
9. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
10. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
11. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
12. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
13. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirleft
14. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos23 dirleft
15. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
16. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown
17. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft
18. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
19. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
20. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown

This is 20 steps, but it's possible that some steps can be optimized.

But perhaps there's a shorter path. For example, after step8 (agent at pos24), instead of moving back to pos34, find a shorter path to pos53.

Alternatively, after step8, agent can move from pos24 to pos23 (dirup), then to pos33 (dirright), then to pos43 (dirright), but that's blocked by the stone.

Alternatively, after step8, agent can move to pos23 (dirup), then to pos33 (dirright), then to pos43 (dirright), but stone is there.

Thus, it seems that the plan requires these steps to satisfy all constraints.

However, this plan may not be optimal. There must be a shorter way.

Alternative idea: Combine visits to multiple required locations in a single path.

For example:

- Agent moves from pos33 to pos34, pos44, pos54, pos55 (steps1-4)
- Returns to pos54, pos44, pos34, pos24 (steps5-8)
- Then moves to pos23, pos33, pos43 (but can't)
- Instead, after pos24, move to pos23, then to pos22 (dirup), then to pos12 (dirleft), making pos12 not clear.
- Then, agent moves to pos13 (dirdown), pos14, pos15 (dirdown), making pos15 not clear.
- Then, agent returns to push the stone.

But this skips visiting pos53, which is required for pushing the stone.

This approach may not work.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to provide the step-by-step plan as outlined earlier, even if it's long, ensuring all constraints are met.

But the problem requires an optimal plan, so perhaps there's a shorter way.

Wait, perhaps after visiting pos55, the agent can go directly to pos53, push the stone, then proceed.

Steps:

1. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
2. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
3. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
4. move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown → at pos55
5. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
6. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup → at pos53
7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirleft → stone to pos33
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos23 dirleft → stone to pos23
9. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup → at pos22
10. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown → stone to pos24
11. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft → pos12 not clear
12. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown → pos13 not clear
13. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown → pos14 not clear (optional)
14. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown → pos15 not clear

This plan has 14 steps.

Check constraints:

- pos43 is not clear until step7: one continuous sequence.

- agent at pos24: no. In this plan, the agent never visits pos24. So this is a problem.

Ah, right. The constraint requires agent to be at pos24 in some state. So this plan is invalid.

Thus, the agent must visit pos24. So steps need to include that.

Modified plan:

After step4 (agent at pos55):

5. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
6. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft
7. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
8. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft → agent at pos24
9. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
10. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
11. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright → can't, stone at pos43. So push.
12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos33 dirleft → invalid, agent not at pos43.

No. Agent is at pos33, can push stone at pos43.

Wait, stone is at pos43, agent at pos33. So:

12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirright → stone to pos53.

13. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft → invalid, stone at pos53.

No. After step12, stone is at pos53. Agent is at pos43.

But then, agent can push the stone from pos53 to pos43, but that's not helpful.

This is getting too complicated. Given the time, I'll proceed with the initial plan that includes visiting pos24 and satisfies all constraints, even if it's longer.
