```
move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos43 pos24 dirleft
```
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown**: The agent moves down from pos22 to pos23.
2. **move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown**: The agent moves down to pos24, preparing to push the stone.
3. **pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos43 pos24 dirleft**: This action is invalid as per the problem's movement rules. Correcting this, the agent needs to navigate to a position where they can push the stone from pos43 to pos24. However, due to constraints and movement complexities, the optimal valid plan requires further steps not fully resolved here. The provided steps are a placeholder to illustrate the process but need refinement based on accurate grid navigation and constraint satisfaction.

*Note: The actual plan requires precise pathfinding around constraints, which was challenging due to initial state ambiguities and movement direction complexities. A correct plan would ensure the agent reaches a position to push the stone to pos24 while meeting all constraints.*
