Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So the goal is to move stone1 to a goal location. The only goal location given is pos24. Right now, stone1 is at pos43. So I need to get the agent (player1) to push stone1 from pos43 to pos24. But wait, pos24 is a goal location, so the action pushtogoal would be used here. But first, the agent needs to get to a position where they can push the stone towards the goal.

Initial positions: player1 is at pos22, stone1 at pos43. The grid is 5x5, with locations pos11 to pos55. Let me visualize this. The agent is at (2,2), stone at (4,3). The goal is pos24, which is (2,4). Wait, pos24 is row 2, column 4? Or maybe row 2 is the second row from top? Hmm, assuming posXY where X is row and Y is column, with pos11 top-left, pos55 bottom-right. So pos22 is row 2, column 2. pos43 is row 4, column 3. pos24 is row 2, column 4. So the stone needs to move from (4,3) to (2,4). That's a diagonal move, but since movement is grid-based and direction-based, the agent has to push it step by step.

First, the agent needs to reach a position adjacent to the stone. From pos22, the agent can move in various directions. Let's see the possible moves. The movement directions are up, down, left, right, based on the allowed directions between locations.

Looking at the initial state's allowed movements: From pos22, the agent can move to pos12 (up?), pos32 (down?), pos21 (left?), pos23 (down?), etc. Wait, the movement directions are defined as "You may move from location pos22 to location pos32 following direction dirright". Wait, directions are a bit confusing. Let's parse the movement options.

Looking at the movement rules for pos22:

- You may move from pos22 to pos12 (dirleft?), wait no. The movement from pos22 to pos12 is direction dirleft? Wait, the movement directions are given as "You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft". Wait, no, let me check the actual movement entries. Let's search for the entries starting with pos22.

Original state includes these movement possibilities for pos22:

- "You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft": So from pos22, moving dirleft takes you to pos12? Or is dirleft meaning left in terms of direction. Wait, perhaps the directions are named dirup, dirdown, dirleft, dirright, but the actual grid movement might not directly correspond. For example, moving from pos22 to pos12 is dirleft? That might be. Because pos22 is row 2, column 2. pos12 is row 1, column 2. So moving up. But the direction is called dirleft here. Hmm, maybe the direction names are not aligned with the grid movement. Alternatively, perhaps the directions are named based on their direction in the grid. For example, moving up would be dirup, moving right is dirright, etc. But according to the movement entries, from pos22, moving dirright takes you to pos32. pos32 is row 3, column 2. So that's down one row. Wait, pos32 is row 3, column 2. So from pos22 (row 2, column 2), moving to pos32 (row 3, column 2) is down. So dirright here corresponds to moving down? That's confusing. Wait, maybe the direction names are arbitrary. Let me clarify. The movement directions are given as "direction dirdown", "dirleft", etc., but the actual direction in terms of grid movement is determined by the allowed moves.

For example, from pos22, moving dirright takes you to pos32. So pos32 is directly below pos22. So dirright in this context is down. Or maybe the directions are based on the grid's coordinate system. Maybe rows increase downward and columns increase to the right. So pos22 is (row 2, column 2). Moving down (dirdown) would take you to row 3, column 2 (pos32). Moving right (dirright) would take you to column 3, row 2 (pos23). Wait, but looking at the movement entries, from pos22, direction dirdown is to pos23. Wait, pos23 is row 2, column 3. So that's moving right. So direction dirdown might actually correspond to moving right? That's inconsistent. Wait, let's check:

From pos22:

- "You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft" (dirleft: up)
- "You may move from location pos22 to location pos32 following direction dirright" (dirright: down)
- "You may move from location pos22 to location pos21 following direction dirup" (dirup: left)
- "You may move from location pos22 to location pos23 following direction dirdown" (dirdown: right)

So, the directions are named based on the movement direction relative to the grid. Wait, but how does that make sense? For example, moving from pos22 to pos21 is dirup, which is left. Moving to pos23 is dirdown (right). Moving to pos12 is dirleft (up). Moving to pos32 is dirright (down). So the directions are named in a way that dirup is left, dirdown is right, dirleft is up, dirright is down. That's counterintuitive, but perhaps the names are arbitrary. So when the agent is at pos22, moving in direction dirright (which is down) takes them to pos32. Moving in direction dirleft (up) takes them to pos12. Moving dirup (left) to pos21, and dirdown (right) to pos23. Hmm. So the directions' names don't correspond to the actual grid movement directions. This is a bit confusing, but I'll have to work with the given movement paths as per the problem's specifications.

So the agent is at pos22. To reach stone1 at pos43, which is at row 4, column 3. So the agent needs to navigate from pos22 to a position adjacent to pos43 to push it.

Looking at pos43's adjacent positions:

The allowed moves from pos43 are:

- To pos33 (dirleft), pos53 (dirright), pos42 (dirup), pos44 (dirdown). So adjacent locations are pos33 (left), pos53 (right), pos42 (up), pos44 (down). Wait, according to the movement entries, from pos43:

- "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft" (dirleft is left, so pos33 is left)
- "You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright" (right to pos53)
- "You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup" (dirup is up, so pos42 is up)
- "You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown" (dirdown is down, so pos44 is down)

So, to push the stone from pos43 to pos24, the agent needs to get to a position adjacent to pos43. For example, if the agent is at pos42 (which is above pos43), they can push the stone down (dirdown) to pos44. Or if the agent is at pos33 (left of pos43), they can push it right (dirright) to pos53. Wait, but the goal is pos24. So how to get the stone from pos43 to pos24?

Let's think of the possible path. The stone is at pos43. To move it towards pos24, which is to the left and up. So we need to move the stone left and up. Let's see possible steps.

Option 1: Push the stone left from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft). Then from pos33 to pos23, then to pos24. But pos24 is the goal. Let's see:

- First, push from pos43 to pos33. To do this, the agent needs to be at pos42 (since pushing dirleft would require the agent to be at the position opposite the direction. Wait, the preconditions for pushtogoal or pushtonongoal require that the agent is at a position l_p, from which they can move to l_from (stone's current position) following direction d. Then the stone is pushed from l_from to l_to following direction d. Wait, the direction must be the same for both agent moving to the stone's position and the stone moving to the new position. So the agent must be adjacent to the stone in the direction opposite to the push direction.

Wait, the "pushtogoal" action requires that the agent is at l_p, which is connected to l_from (stone's current location) via direction d. Then, the stone is pushed from l_from to l_to, which is connected via direction d. So for example, if the agent is at l_p, and they can move to l_from via direction d, then the stone can be pushed from l_from to l_to via the same direction d. So the agent must be in a position adjacent to the stone's current position (l_from), such that moving in direction d from l_p leads to l_from. Then, the stone is pushed in direction d from l_from to l_to.

So, for instance, to push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft direction), the agent must be at a location that can move to pos43 via dirleft. Wait, no. The agent is at l_p, and moving from l_p to l_from (pos43) via direction d. Then the stone is pushed from l_from to l_to via direction d. So the direction d is the same for both the agent's movement to the stone and the stone's movement to the new location.

Wait, let's clarify the preconditions for "pushtogoal":

- (iv) you can get from location l_p to l_from following direction d.

- (v) you can get from l_from to l_to following direction d.

So, for example, if the agent is at l_p, and direction d is dirleft, then l_p to l_from via dirleft. Then l_from to l_to via dirleft. So l_p must be to the right of l_from, and l_from must be to the right of l_to. So pushing the stone left would require the agent to be to the right of the stone. Then the agent moves left into the stone's position, pushing it left to l_to.

So in this case, if the stone is at pos43, and we want to push it left (dirleft) to pos33, the agent must be at pos44 (since from pos44, moving dirleft to pos43 would require that direction. Wait, no. Wait, l_p is the agent's current position. From l_p, moving in direction d leads to l_from (stone's current position). Then, from l_from, moving in direction d leads to l_to. So if the direction is dirleft, then l_p must be to the right of l_from. Because moving left from l_p would reach l_from. Then, moving left from l_from would reach l_to.

So for example, if the stone is at pos43, and we want to push it left to pos33 (direction dirleft), then l_p (agent's position) must be pos44. Because moving dirleft from pos44 would go to pos43. Then pushing dirleft from pos43 would go to pos33. So the agent must be at pos44 to push the stone left.

Alternatively, if the agent is at pos53 (to the right of pos43), moving dirleft to pos43, then pushing the stone dirleft to pos33. But pos53 is to the right of pos43, so moving dirleft from pos53 would go to pos43. Then pushing dirleft would go to pos33. So the agent could be at pos44 or pos53 to push the stone left. Wait, no. Let me check the allowed movements.

Looking at the allowed moves from pos44: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft" (dirleft here would be moving left, which is to pos34. Wait, but pos44 is row 4, column4. pos34 is row3, column4. So dirleft from pos44 leads to pos34, which is up. Hmm, this is getting more confusing. Maybe I need to map out the allowed moves for each location and direction.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the grid as a graph where each node is a location, and edges are the allowed movements with directions. Then, for each push action, the agent must be in a position adjacent to the stone in a direction that allows pushing.

But this could take a while. Let's try to plan step by step.

First, the agent is at pos22. Stone1 is at pos43. Goal is pos24 (which is a goal location). Constraints:

1. At least one state must have pos22 or pos43 not clear. Since initially, pos22 is clear (agent is there, but the initial state says "player1 is at pos22", so pos22 is not clear. Wait, no. Wait, the initial state says "Location pos22 is clear" at the end. Wait, looking back at the original state:

Original state includes:

"player1 is at location pos22"

"Location pos22 is clear"

Wait, that's conflicting. If the player is at pos22, then pos22 should not be clear. But according to the problem statement, the initial state includes "Location pos22 is clear". That's a contradiction. Hmm, maybe a typo. Let's check again.

Looking at the original state:

The original state includes:

"player1 is at location pos22"

"stone1 is at location pos43"

Then, a list of "Location ... is clear". Among those:

"Location pos22 is clear"

But if the player is at pos22, then pos22 should not be clear. So this seems like a mistake in the problem setup. However, the problem states that the original state is as given, so perhaps "clear" here refers to not containing a stone. Wait, the problem says "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So a location is clear if it's empty (no agent or stone). But in the initial state, player1 is at pos22, so pos22 is not clear. However, the original state lists "Location pos22 is clear". That's a problem. But according to the problem statement, we have to take the given initial state as correct. So perhaps the definition of "clear" is that a location is clear if there's no stone. But the problem says "clear" if the location is empty (no agent or stone). But given the initial state as provided, perhaps the "clear" statements are after considering agent and stone positions. So this is conflicting.

Wait, the original state says:

"player1 is at location pos22"

"stone1 is at location pos43"

Then, in the list of clear locations, "Location pos22 is clear" and "Location pos43 is clear". That's impossible because pos22 has the agent and pos43 has the stone, so they should not be clear. But according to the problem's initial state, they are marked as clear. This suggests that the problem's initial state has an error. But perhaps the definition of "clear" is different. Maybe "clear" means that there's no stone, regardless of the agent. Wait, but the problem says that each position may contain the agent, a stone, or be empty. So a location is clear if it's empty (no agent, no stone). So in the initial state, pos22 has the agent, so it's not clear. But the problem's original state says "Location pos22 is clear". This is a contradiction, but maybe it's a typo, and the correct initial state has pos22 not clear. But since the problem states the original state as given, perhaps we have to proceed with that.

Alternatively, perhaps the "clear" statements in the original state are only for stones, not considering the agent. That is, a location is clear if there's no stone. But then the agent's presence doesn't affect the "clear" status. But according to the action's effects, moving the agent affects the clear status. For example, the "move" action's effect is that the agent leaves l_from (making it clear) and arrives at l_to (making it not clear). So the "clear" status is determined by whether the location has an agent or a stone.

Given that, the initial state has a contradiction because pos22 is occupied by the agent but is listed as clear. However, the problem provides this as part of the initial state, so perhaps we have to accept that as part of the problem's setup, and proceed under the assumption that the agent's location is considered clear. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the initial state's "clear" statements are incorrect, and the actual initial state has pos22 not clear. But this is confusing.

Assuming that the initial state is correctly given, with pos22 and pos43 both clear despite the agent and stone being there, perhaps the problem's "clear" refers to the absence of stones only. So a location is clear if there's no stone. The agent's presence doesn't affect the clear status. But that contradicts the action effects. For example, the "move" action's effect is that the destination location is no longer clear. But if clear only refers to stones, then the agent's presence wouldn't affect it. This is conflicting.

This seems like a critical point. Let's re-examine the problem description:

"Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty. Each position is flagged as either a goal position or a non-goal position. Your task is to manipulate the agent in order to move all stones to goal positions."

The preconditions for the move action require that the destination is clear. So, "move p l_from l_to d" can only be done if l_to is clear. Which implies that a location is clear if it doesn't contain the agent or a stone. So if the agent is at l_from, then l_from is not clear. But the initial state says "Location pos22 is clear" while the agent is there. This is a contradiction. Therefore, it's likely a mistake in the problem statement. But since the problem provides this initial state, we must work with it as given. So perhaps in this problem, the "clear" status is only about stones. That is, a location is clear if there's no stone, regardless of the agent's presence. But that would contradict the move action's preconditions, which require that the destination is clear. For example, if the agent is moving to a location that has no stone, even if another agent is there (but there's only one agent here), then it's allowed. But since there's only one agent, maybe the clear status for movement only considers stones. However, the problem's action effects mention that after moving, the destination is no longer clear, implying that the agent's presence makes it not clear. So this is confusing.

Given this confusion, perhaps the problem's initial state has a typo, and the actual initial state has pos22 not clear (since the agent is there), and pos43 not clear (since the stone is there). But the given initial state lists them as clear. So perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with the given initial state, even if it's conflicting, and assume that "clear" refers to the absence of a stone, and the agent's presence is allowed in clear locations. So when moving, the agent can move to a location that is clear (no stone), even if the agent is there? No, but there's only one agent. So perhaps the initial state's "clear" statements are correct, but the agent's location is considered clear. That would mean that the agent's presence doesn't block the clear status. But then, when moving, the destination must be clear (no stone), but the agent can be there. But that doesn't make sense. I'm stuck here. Maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the initial state is correct as given, and the "clear" status is only about stones. So the agent can be in a clear location, and moving to a clear location just means there's no stone. That way, the agent can move to a location that has the agent? No, but there's only one agent. So perhaps the problem's "clear" refers to stones only. So when the move action's preconditions say the destination is clear, it means there's no stone there. The agent's presence doesn't affect it. But then, the move action's effect says that the destination is no longer clear, implying that the agent's presence makes it not clear. This is conflicting.

Given this ambiguity, I'll proceed with the assumption that "clear" means the location has neither an agent nor a stone. Therefore, the initial state's mention of "Location pos22 is clear" is incorrect, but the problem states it as such, so I have to work with it. Wait, but how can the agent be at pos22 and pos22 be clear? That's a contradiction. Perhaps the problem has a mistake here. But as a solver, I have to take the given initial state as correct, even if it's contradictory. Therefore, I'll proceed under the assumption that in this problem, the agent's presence does not affect the clear status of a location. So "clear" only refers to the absence of a stone. Therefore, the agent can be in a clear location, and moving to a location requires that there's no stone there. The move action's effect on clear status would then only pertain to stones, but that contradicts the problem's description. This is very confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's initial state has a typo, and "Location pos22 is clear" should be "Location pos22 is not clear". Similarly for pos43. But since I can't change the problem's initial state, I have to proceed with the given information.

Let me try to proceed, assuming that the clear status is as given. So pos22 and pos43 are clear, despite the agent and stone being there. Then, when the agent moves, the destination location's clear status is updated. But this is illogical. However, given the problem's instructions, I'll proceed as per the given initial state.

Now, back to the plan. The agent needs to move to a position where they can push the stone1 from pos43 to a goal location (pos24). The constraints add complexity. Let's list the constraints:

1. At least one state must have pos22 or pos43 not clear. Since initially, according to the problem, pos22 is clear (agent is there, but pos22 is marked as clear), but after moving, pos22 becomes clear again. But this constraint must be met. Maybe when the agent moves away from pos22, pos22 becomes clear (if clear means empty). But this is confusing. Alternatively, if the agent is at pos22, then pos22 is not clear. So the initial state already satisfies "pos22 is not clear", so this constraint is already met. But according to the problem's initial state, pos22 is clear. So this is conflicting. This is a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's initial state has the agent at pos22, but pos22 is clear, meaning the agent is not considered as occupying the location. Which is impossible. This is a major issue. Given this confusion, perhaps the problem has an error, but as a solver, I need to proceed.

Assuming that the initial state is correct, and the agent's location doesn't affect the clear status, the first constraint requires that in at least one state, pos22 or pos43 is not clear. Since pos43 has the stone, it's not clear. So if the stone is moved, then pos43 becomes clear, but the new location of the stone would be not clear. So during the plan, when the stone is at pos43 (initially), pos43 is not clear. But according to the problem's initial state, pos43 is clear. This is conflicting. I think there's a mistake in the problem's initial state regarding the clear status of pos22 and pos43. But since I can't change that, I'll have to proceed.

Assuming that the problem's initial state is correct as given, then pos22 and pos43 are clear, even though the agent and stone are there. So to satisfy the first constraint ("At least one of "Location pos22 is not clear", "Location pos43 is not clear" in at least one state"), we need to make sure that either pos22 or pos43 is not clear at some point. But according to the initial state, they are clear. So during the plan, we need to have a state where pos22 or pos43 is not clear. How?

If the agent moves back to pos22 later, then pos22 would be not clear again. Or if the stone is pushed back to pos43. But since the stone starts at pos43, and we need to move it to pos24, perhaps the constraint is already satisfied when the stone is at pos43 (which is not clear). But according to the initial state, pos43 is clear. So this is a problem. The constraint requires that in at least one state, pos22 or pos43 is not clear. But according to the initial state, they are clear. So during the plan, we need to make sure that either pos22 or pos43 is not clear in some state. For example, moving the agent back to pos22 would make it not clear (assuming that agent's presence makes a location not clear). But according to the initial state, pos22 is clear even with the agent there. This is very confusing.

Perhaps the problem's initial state has a mistake, and the correct initial state is that pos22 and pos43 are not clear because the agent and stone are there. Then, the first constraint is already satisfied. But the problem's initial state lists them as clear. This is a critical issue. Without resolving this, it's impossible to proceed accurately.

Given the time I've spent on this confusion, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the initial state's clear statuses are correct as given, and the agent's presence doesn't affect the clear status. Therefore, the first constraint requires that during the plan, either pos22 or pos43 is not clear. Since initially they are clear, we need to make one of them not clear. But how? For example, if the agent moves to pos22 again later, but that would require pos22 to be clear, which it is. So moving to pos22 would make it not clear. But according to the move action's effect, after moving, the agent is at l_to, which becomes not clear. So if the agent moves to pos22 again (from somewhere else), then pos22 would become not clear. But initially, the agent is at pos22, and pos22 is clear, which is conflicting. So this approach is not feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's initial state is correct, and "clear" means something else. For example, "clear" means that no stone is present. So pos43 is clear if there's no stone. But the stone is there, so pos43 should not be clear. But the problem says "Location pos43 is clear" in the initial state. This is contradictory. Given this, I think there's an error in the problem statement. But since I have to proceed, I'll assume that the agent's presence does not affect the clear status, and only stones do. Therefore, pos43 is not clear because the stone is there. So the initial state's mention of "Location pos43 is clear" is incorrect, but I'll proceed with the problem's actual initial state where the stone is at pos43, making pos43 not clear. Therefore, the first constraint is satisfied in the initial state because pos43 is not clear. But according to the problem's original state, pos43 is clear. This is a problem, but perhaps it's a typo, and the correct initial state has pos43 not clear. So I'll proceed under that assumption.

Assuming that pos43 is not clear initially (due to the stone), then the first constraint is already satisfied. So we don't need to worry about it.

Moving on to the other constraints:

2. "pos54 is not clear" in at most one continuous sequence of states. So after pos54 becomes not clear (e.g., agent or stone is there), it can be cleared again, but the period when it's not clear should be a single continuous sequence.

3. "pos42 is clear" in every state. So the agent or stone cannot be at pos42 at any time.

4. "pos24 is not clear" in at least one state. Since the goal is to place the stone at pos24, this will happen when the stone is there. So this constraint is satisfied when the stone reaches pos24.

5. If pos24 is not clear (i.e., when the stone is there), then the agent must be at pos32 at that state or some state after.

6. "pos53 is not clear" in at least one state. So the agent or stone must be there at some point.

7. If pos53 is not clear in some state, then there must be an earlier state where either the agent was at pos11 or pos14 is not clear.

8. "pos52 is not clear" in at least one state.

9. "pos34 is not clear" in at least one state.

10. If pos34 is not clear, then the agent must be at pos32 or pos51 at that state or later.

So, the plan must satisfy all these constraints.

Let's outline the steps needed to move the stone from pos43 to pos24, considering the constraints.

First, the stone is at pos43. Goal is pos24. We need to push it to pos24. The path from pos43 to pos24 requires moving the stone left and up. Let's see possible routes:

Option 1: Push the stone left to pos33, then up to pos23, then left to pos24. But pos24 is a goal location, so the final push must be to pos24 using pushtogoal.

But pushing from pos23 to pos24 would require the agent to be at pos25 (direction dirdown to push up?), but this is getting complicated. Let's map out the movements.

Alternative route: pos43 → pos33 (left), then pos33 → pos23 (left), then pos23 → pos24 (right? But pos24 is to the right of pos23? pos23 is row 2, column3. pos24 is row2, column4. So right direction.

Wait, directions are confusing. For example, moving from pos23 to pos24 is dirdown. Because in the movement entries, "You may move from location pos23 to location pos24 following direction dirdown". So from pos23, direction dirdown leads to pos24. So to push the stone from pos23 to pos24 (right), the agent needs to be at pos22 (up from pos23) and push dirdown (which is right? Or is dirdown actually down? This is unclear. 

Assuming that from pos23, direction dirdown takes you to pos24 (which is row 2, column4, so right?), then pushing the stone from pos23 to pos24 would require the agent to be at pos22 (since the agent needs to move in direction dirdown to reach pos23). So agent at pos22 can push the stone from pos23 to pos24 via dirdown.

But first, the stone needs to reach pos23.

So steps:

1. Agent moves from pos22 to pos32 (dirright), then to pos42 (dirdown?), but need to check movement options.

Wait, the agent is at pos22. To reach pos43's adjacent positions (pos42, pos44, pos33, pos53), considering constraints like pos42 must always be clear.

Since pos42 must be clear in every state, the agent and stone cannot be there. So the agent cannot move to pos42, and the stone cannot be pushed there. So the only adjacent positions available are pos33, pos44, pos53.

But pos53 is in column5, row3. So pushing the stone to pos53 would require the agent to be at pos54 (if pushing dirleft), but pos54 must be clear. But pos53 is a location we need to make not clear at some point (constraint 7).

But let's think: to push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (left), the agent needs to be at pos44 (dirleft from pos44 to pos43) or pos53 (dirleft from pos53 to pos43). But pos44 is a non-goal location. Let's see the movement options.

From pos43, pushing left (dirleft) to pos33 would require the agent to be at pos44 (dirleft from pos44 to pos43) and then push dirleft to pos33.

But pos44 is clear initially. So agent can move to pos44.

But how to get to pos44 from pos22.

Path from pos22 to pos44:

pos22 → pos32 (dirright), pos32 → pos42 (dirdown?), but pos42 must remain clear. So the agent cannot go through pos42.

Alternative route: pos22 → pos23 (dirdown), pos23 → pos24 (dirdown), pos24 → pos34 (dirright). Wait, but direction names are confusing. Let's check allowed movements.

From pos22, directions:

- dirleft: to pos12
- dirright: to pos32
- dirup: to pos21
- dirdown: to pos23

So to get to pos44, the agent needs to go from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown), then pos23 to pos24 (dirdown), pos24 to pos34 (dirright). Then pos34 to pos44 (dirright). But pos34 is a non-goal location.

But this path may be possible. Let's check each movement:

pos22 → pos23 (dirdown): allowed.

pos23 → pos24 (dirdown): allowed.

pos24 → pos34 (dirright): yes, "You may move from location pos24 to location pos34 following direction dirright".

pos34 → pos44 (dirright): "You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright".

So agent can move from pos22 → pos23 → pos24 → pos34 → pos44.

Once at pos44, the agent can push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft), since from pos44, moving dirleft to pos43 is allowed. Then, pushing dirleft from pos43 to pos33.

But wait, the action would be pushtonongoal since pos33 is not a goal location. After pushing, the stone is at pos33. Then, the agent is at pos43.

Next, the agent needs to push the stone from pos33 to pos23. To do that, the agent needs to be at pos34 (dirleft from pos34 to pos33). So agent moves from pos43 → pos44 (dirup?), wait, the agent is at pos43 after pushing. From pos43, where can they go? They can move to pos42 (dirup), but pos42 must remain clear. So agent can't go to pos42. Other options: pos33 (dirleft), pos53 (dirright), pos44 (dirdown).

Assuming the agent moves to pos44 (dirdown from pos43). Then, from pos44, they can move to pos34 (dirleft). Then, from pos34, move dirleft to pos33. Wait, no. From pos34, moving dirleft would be to pos24. Because "You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft". So direction dirleft from pos34 leads to pos24.

Alternatively, the agent needs to get to a position where they can push the stone from pos33 to pos23. For that, the agent needs to be at pos34 (dirleft from pos34 to pos33), then push dirleft to pos23.

Wait, the agent at pos34 can move dirleft to pos33 (stone's current location) if allowed. Looking at the movement entries:

From pos34: "You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos34 to location pos33 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos34 to location pos35 following direction dirdown".

So from pos34, moving dirup would take the agent to pos33. So agent at pos34 can move dirup to pos33. Then, push the stone dirup to pos23. Wait, but dirup from pos33 leads to pos23? Checking movement from pos33: "You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft". No, looking at pos33's movements:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown".

So from pos33, dirleft leads to pos23. So to push the stone from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft), the agent must be at pos34 (since moving dirleft from pos34 to pos33 is allowed. Wait, no. The agent needs to be at a location l_p from which they can move to l_from (pos33) via direction d. Then, pushing the stone from pos33 to pos23 via direction d (dirleft). So the agent must be at pos34, move dirleft to pos33, then push dirleft to pos23. But the movement from pos34 to pos33 is dirup, not dirleft. So this approach won't work.

Alternative approach: agent is at pos32. From pos32, moving dirright to pos33. Then push dirleft to pos23.

But how does the agent get to pos32 from pos44? That would require moving back. Let's see:

Agent is at pos44 after pushing the stone to pos33. To reach pos32:

pos44 → pos34 (dirleft), pos34 → pos24 (dirleft), pos24 → pos23 (dirup), pos23 → pos22 (dirup), pos22 → pos32 (dirright). But this is a long path.

Alternatively, from pos44, move to pos34 (dirleft), then pos34 → pos33 (dirup?), no. From pos34, dirup is to pos33. So pos34 → pos33 (dirup). Then from pos33, move dirup to pos32? No, from pos33, dirup is to pos32. So pos33 → pos32 (dirup). Then, agent is at pos32. Now, the agent can push the stone from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft) by being at pos32 and moving dirright to pos33, then pushing dirleft to pos23.

So steps:

1. Move from pos44 → pos34 (dirleft)
2. Move from pos34 → pos33 (dirup)
3. Move from pos33 → pos32 (dirup)
4. Push from pos33 to pos23: agent at pos32, move dirright to pos33, then push dirleft to pos23. But wait, the action requires that the agent is at l_p (pos32), can move to l_from (pos33) via direction d (dirright), then push dirleft from pos33 to pos23. But direction d must be the same for both movement and push. So if the agent moves dirright to pos33, the push direction must also be dirright. But pushing dirright from pos33 would take the stone to pos43. Which is not helpful. So this approach doesn't work.

Hmm. This is getting complex. Let's try a different approach.

Alternative route: Push the stone from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown), then to pos54 (dirright?), but pos44 is a non-goal location. But pushing to pos44 would require using pushtonongoal. Then, from pos44, push the stone to pos34 (dirleft), then to pos24 (dirleft). But pos24 is a goal.

Let's see:

Agent starts at pos22. Needs to reach pos43 to push it.

Wait, agent needs to be at pos44 to push the stone from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown). How?

Agent's path to pos44: pos22 → pos23 → pos24 → pos34 → pos44.

Once at pos44, push the stone from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown). But pos44 is not a goal, so use pushtonongoal. Wait, no. The stone is at pos43, and the agent is at pos44. To push the stone to pos44 (same location as agent?), but that's impossible. Wait, no. The stone is at pos43, and the agent is at pos44. To push the stone to pos44, the agent would have to be at pos43's position. Wait, no. The preconditions for pushing require that the agent is at l_p, can move to l_from (stone's current position) via direction d. Then, the stone is pushed from l_from to l_to via direction d. So to push the stone from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown), the agent must be at pos42 (since moving dirdown from pos42 to pos43 is allowed), then push dirdown to pos44. But pos42 must remain clear, so the agent can't be there. This is a problem.

Alternatively, the agent can't use pos42. So another approach is needed.

Alternative plan: agent moves from pos22 to pos32 (dirright), then to pos42 (dirdown) but pos42 must be clear. So this is not allowed. So agent cannot go through pos42.

Alternative route: pos22 → pos32 (dirright), pos32 → pos33 (dirdown), pos33 → pos34 (dirdown), pos34 → pos44 (dirright). Then agent is at pos44.

Now, from pos44, the agent can push the stone from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown), but pos44 is already occupied by the agent. So this isn't possible. Alternatively, push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft). Agent at pos44 can move dirleft to pos43 (if allowed), then push dirleft to pos33.

Checking movement from pos44: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown".

So from pos44, moving dirup to pos43 is allowed. So the agent can move from pos44 to pos43 via dirup. Then, push the stone from pos43 to pos33 via dirleft. But pos43 is the stone's initial position. Wait, the stone is at pos43. So if the agent is at pos44 and moves dirup to pos43, that's possible only if pos43 is clear. But the stone is there, so pos43 is not clear. Therefore, the agent cannot move to pos43. This is a problem.

So this approach is invalid.

Alternative idea: push the stone from pos43 to pos53 (dirright). The agent needs to be at pos54 to push dirleft to pos53. But pos54 must be clear. Let's see:

Agent's path to pos54: pos22 → pos23 → pos24 → pos34 → pos44 → pos54 (dirright). From pos44, dirright to pos54 is allowed.

Once at pos54, the agent can push the stone from pos43 to pos53 (dirleft). Wait, agent at pos54 can move dirleft to pos53 (if allowed). From pos54: "You may move from location pos54 to location pos44 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos54 to location pos53 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos54 to location pos55 following direction dirdown".

So from pos54, dirup to pos53. Then push dirleft to pos43? No, the stone is at pos43. To push it to pos53 (dirright), the agent must be at pos54 and move dirleft to pos53, then push dirright to pos43. That's not helpful. Alternatively, the agent needs to be at pos53 to push the stone to pos53. But how?

This is getting too complicated. Let's try to find a different path, considering the constraints.

Constraint 6 requires that pos53 is not clear at some state. So the agent or stone must be there. Similarly, constraint 8 requires pos52 not clear. Constraint 9 requires pos34 not clear.

Also, when pos34 is not clear (e.g., agent or stone is there), the agent must be at pos32 or pos51 in that or a later state.

Let's try to plan a route that satisfies all constraints:

1. Agent needs to push stone1 from pos43 to pos24.

2. Ensure pos53 is not clear at some point. Maybe the agent moves there.

3. Ensure pos52 is not clear. Agent can move there.

4. Ensure pos34 is not clear. Perhaps the agent moves there.

But pos34 is a non-goal location. Let's try:

Agent moves from pos22 to pos32 (dirright), then to pos33 (dirdown), then to pos34 (dirdown). Now, pos34 is not clear (agent is there), satisfying constraint 9. Then, according to constraint 10, the agent must be at pos32 or pos51 now or later. Since the agent is at pos34, they need to move to pos32 or pos51 afterward.

From pos34, agent can move to pos32 (dirup), satisfying the constraint.

But how does this help with moving the stone?

Alternatively, the agent can push the stone to pos34. But stone is at pos43. To push it to pos34, the agent needs to be at pos44 (dirleft to pos43), then push dirleft to pos33, then from pos33, push dirup to pos23, etc. But this seems too long.

Alternatively, consider using the pushtogoal action directly. The goal is pos24. To push the stone to pos24, the agent needs to be at a position from which they can move to the stone's current location in a direction that leads to pos24. For example, if the stone is at pos24's west (pos23), then the agent can push it east (dirdown) to pos24.

But the stone starts at pos43. So how to get it to pos23?

Perhaps:

1. Agent moves to pos44.

2. Pushes stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft).

3. Agent moves to pos33.

4. Pushes stone from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft).

5. Agent moves to pos23.

6. Pushes stone from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown, which is east).

But during this process, need to check constraints.

But pos42 must remain clear at all times, so the agent cannot move through pos42.

Let's see step by step:

Step 1: Agent moves from pos22 to pos32 (dirright).

Step 2: Agent moves from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown).

Step 3: Agent moves from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown).

Step 4: Agent moves from pos34 to pos44 (dirright).

Now, agent is at pos44.

Step 5: Push stone from pos43 to pos33. Wait, agent is at pos44. To push from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft), the agent must be able to move from pos44 to pos43 via dirleft. Checking movement from pos44: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft", not to pos43. So can't move dirleft to pos43. Instead, from pos44, agent can move dirup to pos43 (if allowed). From pos44: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup".

Yes. So agent can move dirup to pos43. But pos43 has the stone, so it's not clear. Therefore, the agent can't move there unless it's clear. But according to the initial state, pos43 is clear. But the stone is there. This is conflicting. Assuming pos43 is not clear (stone is there), the agent can't move there. So this approach is invalid.

Alternative approach: agent at pos44 can push the stone from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown). But pos44 is occupied by the agent. No, that's impossible. So this won't work.

Alternative idea: agent at pos44 can push the stone from pos43 to pos53 (dirright). To do this, the agent must be at pos54, move dirleft to pos53, then push dirright to pos43. But the stone is already at pos43. Not helpful.

This is very challenging. Let's consider using the pushtonongoal action to move the stone to pos44, then push it further.

Agent's path to pos44:

pos22 → pos23 → pos24 → pos34 → pos44.

Now, agent is at pos44. Now, push the stone from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown). Preconditions:

- Agent is at pos44 (l_p = pos44).

- Stone is at l_from = pos43.

- l_to = pos44.

- Can move from l_p (pos44) to l_from (pos43) via direction d. From pos44, direction dirup leads to pos43. So d = dirup.

- Then, can move from pos43 to pos44 via direction dirup? No, because the stone is being pushed from pos43 to pos44 via direction d. But dirup from pos43 is to pos42, which is not allowed (pos42 must remain clear).

Wait, this is confusing. The direction for the push must be the same as the direction the agent moved to reach the stone. So agent moves from pos44 to pos43 via dirup. Then, the stone is pushed via dirup to pos42. But pos42 must remain clear. So this is invalid.

Alternatively, pushing the stone in a different direction. For example, agent moves from pos44 to pos43 via dirup, then pushes the stone dirright to pos53. But how?

The action would be pushtonongoal, since pos53 is not a goal. Preconditions:

- Agent at pos44, moves dirup to pos43 (stone's location). But pos43 is not clear (stone is there), so agent can't move there unless it's clear. But according to initial state, pos43 is clear. This is conflicting.

Assuming pos43 is not clear (stone is there), the agent can't move there. Therefore, the agent can't perform this action.

Given all this, perhaps the optimal plan is to move the agent around the grid to push the stone directly to the goal, while satisfying all constraints. Let's attempt a step-by-step plan:

1. Agent moves from pos22 to pos32 (dirright).

2. Agent moves from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown).

3. Agent moves from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown).

4. Agent moves from pos34 to pos44 (dirright).

5. Agent moves from pos44 to pos54 (dirright).

Now, agent is at pos54, which is not clear (satisfies constraint 8 if pos54 is considered not clear here, but constraint 2 says pos54 can be not clear at most one continuous sequence. But we'll need to check.

6. Agent moves from pos54 to pos53 (dirup). Now, pos53 is not clear (agent is there), satisfying constraint 6. Also, for constraint 7, before pos53 is not clear, there must be a state where agent is at pos11 or pos14 is not clear. Since agent hasn't been to pos11 or pos14, this is a problem. So this violates constraint7.

So to satisfy constraint7, before pos53 is not clear (which happens when agent is there), there must be a state where agent was at pos11 or pos14 is not clear. Since we can't get the agent to pos11 quickly, perhaps we need to make pos14 not clear.

But pos14 is clear initially. How to make it not clear? By moving the agent or stone there. But the stone's path is from pos43 to pos24. Moving the agent to pos14 would require a long path, but it's possible.

Alternatively, the agent can move to pos14, making it not clear, then proceed. This adds steps but satisfies constraint7.

So revised plan:

1. Agent moves from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown).

2. Agent moves from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown).

3. Agent moves from pos24 to pos14 (dirleft). Because from pos24, moving dirleft to pos14 is allowed? Let's check the movement entries for pos24:

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos14 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos24 to location pos34 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos24 to location pos23 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos24 to location pos25 following direction dirdown".

So yes, agent can move from pos24 to pos14 (dirleft).

4. Now, agent is at pos14. This makes pos14 not clear, satisfying part of constraint7.

5. Agent then moves back to pos24 (dirright).

6. Agent moves from pos24 to pos34 (dirright).

7. Agent moves from pos34 to pos44 (dirright).

8. Agent moves from pos44 to pos54 (dirright).

9. Agent moves from pos54 to pos53 (dirup). Now, pos53 is not clear. Since in step4, pos14 was not clear, this satisfies constraint7.

Now, continue pushing the stone:

10. Agent moves from pos53 to pos43 (dirleft). But pos43 has the stone, so agent can't move there unless it's clear. But according to initial state, pos43 is clear. If it's not, this is impossible. Assuming pos43 is not clear (stone is there), agent can't move there. So alternative approach.

Alternative after step9:

10. Agent is at pos53. From here, agent can push the stone from pos43 to pos53 (dirright), but the stone is at pos43. To push to pos53, agent must be at pos54 (dirleft to pos53), then push dirright to pos43. But stone is already there. Not helpful.

This is getting too complicated. Perhaps the optimal plan involves moving the stone from pos43 to pos24 via pos33, pos23, and then pos24, while ensuring all constraints are met.

But given time constraints, I'll propose a possible plan that satisfies the constraints, even if it's not the shortest.

Proposed plan:

1. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown

2. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown

3. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft

4. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright

5. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright

6. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

7. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright

8. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup

9. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft

10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos33 dirleft

But step10 is invalid because the agent can't be at pos43 if it's not clear. This is a problem.

Alternative:

After step8 (agent at pos53), push the stone from pos43 to pos53:

9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos53 dirright

This requires that agent is at pos53, stone is at pos43. Agent moves dirright to pos43 (if allowed). From pos53, moving dirright to pos43 is possible? From pos53, allowed movements are:

"You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos53 to location pos52 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown".

So to move to pos43, direction dirleft is needed. So agent at pos53 can move dirleft to pos43, but pos43 has the stone, so unless it's clear, this isn't allowed. Again, conflicting.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I'll proceed to provide a plan that attempts to satisfy the constraints, even if it's not perfect. The key steps involve moving the agent to pos24 to satisfy the constraint that pos24 is not clear (when the stone arrives there), then ensuring the agent is at pos32 afterward. Also, ensuring pos53 and pos52 are not clear at some point, and pos34 is not clear.

Final answer:
