Let's first understand the problem clearly:

1. We have a 2D grid with an agent (player1) and a stone (stone1).
2. The goal is to push the stone to a goal location.
3. The agent can move to adjacent cells and push the stone.
4. The actions are:
   - move: Agent moves to an adjacent cell.
   - pushtogoal: Agent pushes the stone to a goal cell.
   - pushtonongoal: Agent pushes the stone to a non-goal cell.
5. The initial state includes:
   - player1 is at pos35
   - stone1 is at pos23
   - pos42 is a goal location (the only one)
6. The task is to make stone1 be at a goal location (which is pos42).

Let's also understand the constraints:
1. pos24 can be non-clear at most once continuously.
2. pos25 can be non-clear at most once continuously.
3. pos32 must be non-clear at least once.
4. If pos32 is non-clear at some state s, then either pos31 is non-clear or player1 is at pos41 at s or some state after s.
5. pos42 must be non-clear at least once.
6. If pos42 is non-clear at some state s, then pos33 must be non-clear at s or some state after s.
7. player1 must be at pos13 at least once.
8. If player1 is at pos13 at some state s, then pos34 must be non-clear at s or some state after s.
9. pos54 must be non-clear at least once.
10. Either pos54 or pos52 must be non-clear at least once.

Let's visualize the grid to better understand the problem. The grid is a 5x5 grid with positions labeled as posXY, where X is the column and Y is the row:

```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

Initially, player1 is at pos35 and stone1 is at pos23. The goal location is pos42.

I need to create a plan to push stone1 from pos23 to pos42 while satisfying all the constraints. Let's think about how to approach this.

First, let's think about the most direct route to push stone1 from pos23 to pos42:
- To push stone1 from pos23, the agent needs to be at an adjacent position (e.g., pos13, pos33, pos22, or pos24).
- The agent needs to push stone1 in the direction of the goal (pos42). This would mean pushing it right and then down.

But I also need to consider the constraints. For example, I must make sure pos32 is non-clear at some point, and similarly for the other constraints.

Let's plan the agent's movements:

1. First, the agent needs to move from pos35.
2. The agent should reach a position adjacent to stone1 (either above, below, left, or right of pos23).
3. Then, the agent should push stone1 towards the goal (pos42) while satisfying the constraints.

Let's sketch a plan:
1. Agent (player1) moves from pos35 to pos13 (satisfying constraint 7).
2. Agent pushes stone1 from pos23 to pos33 (making pos33 non-clear and satisfying part of constraint 6).
3. Agent moves to pos32 to get in position to push stone1 again.
4. Agent pushes stone1 from pos33 to pos43 (making it one step closer to the goal).
5. Agent moves to pos42 (making pos42 non-clear and satisfying constraint 5).
6. Agent pushes stone1 from pos43 to pos42 (the goal location).

But this plan doesn't satisfy all the constraints. For instance, I don't make pos32 non-clear, and I don't ensure that pos54 is non-clear at some point. Let's refine the plan.

Actually, let's try to create a more comprehensive plan that satisfies all the constraints:

1. Agent moves from pos35 to pos34.
2. Agent moves from pos34 to pos33.
3. Agent moves from pos33 to pos23.
4. Agent moves from pos23 to pos13 (satisfying constraint 7).
5. Agent moves from pos13 to pos14.
6. Agent moves from pos14 to pos24.
7. Agent moves from pos24 to pos23.
8. Agent pushes stone1 from pos23 to pos33 (making pos33 non-clear and satisfying part of constraint 6).
9. Agent pushes stone1 from pos33 to pos32 (making pos32 non-clear and satisfying constraint 3).
10. Agent moves from pos33 to pos23.
11. Agent moves from pos23 to pos24.
12. Agent moves from pos24 to pos25.
13. Agent moves from pos25 to pos35.
14. Agent moves from pos35 to pos45.
15. Agent moves from pos45 to pos44.
16. Agent moves from pos44 to pos54 (making pos54 non-clear and satisfying constraint 9 and 10).
17. Agent moves from pos54 to pos53.
18. Agent moves from pos53 to pos43.
19. Agent moves from pos43 to pos33.
20. Agent moves from pos33 to pos32.
21. Agent pushes stone1 from pos32 to pos42 (making pos42 non-clear and satisfying constraint 5).

But I realize I've made a mistake. The player1 doesn't make a location non-clear by itself. Only stone1 makes a location non-clear. Let me rethink this.

OK, for a location to be "not clear", it means either the agent is there or the stone is there. Let's replan with this understanding.

Let's create a refined plan:

1. Agent moves from pos35 to pos34.
2. Agent moves from pos34 to pos33.
3. Agent moves from pos33 to pos23 (getting adjacent to stone1).
4. Agent pushes stone1 from pos23 to pos13 (agent is at pos23, stone1 is at pos13).
5. Agent moves from pos23 to pos24.
6. Agent moves from pos24 to pos25 (non-clear once, satisfying constraint 2).
7. Agent moves from pos25 to pos35.
8. Agent moves from pos35 to pos34 (making pos34 non-clear, satisfying constraint 8 after agent is at pos13).
9. Agent moves from pos34 to pos33.
10. Agent moves from pos33 to pos32.
11. Agent moves from pos32 to pos22.
12. Agent moves from pos22 to pos12.
13. Agent moves from pos12 to pos13.
14. Agent pushes stone1 from pos13 to pos23 (agent is at pos13, stone1 is at pos23).
15. Agent moves from pos13 to pos14.
16. Agent moves from pos14 to pos24 (non-clear once, satisfying constraint 1).
17. Agent moves from pos24 to pos34.
18. Agent moves from pos34 to pos33.
19. Agent moves from pos33 to pos23.
20. Agent pushes stone1 from pos23 to pos33 (agent is at pos23, stone1 is at pos33).
21. Agent pushes stone1 from pos33 to pos43 (agent is at pos33, stone1 is at pos43).
22. Agent moves from pos33 to pos32 (making pos32 non-clear, satisfying constraint 3).
23. Agent moves from pos32 to pos31 (making pos31 non-clear, satisfying constraint 4 after pos32 is non-clear).
24. Agent moves from pos31 to pos41 (making player1 at pos41, also satisfying constraint 4).
25. Agent moves from pos41 to pos42 (making pos42 non-clear, satisfying constraint 5).
26. Agent moves from pos42 to pos52 (making pos52 non-clear, satisfying part of constraint 10).
27. Agent moves from pos52 to pos53.
28. Agent moves from pos53 to pos54 (making pos54 non-clear, satisfying constraint 9 and fully satisfying constraint 10).
29. Agent moves from pos54 to pos53.
30. Agent moves from pos53 to pos43.
31. Agent pushes stone1 from pos43 to pos33 (agent is at pos43, stone1 is at pos33) (making pos33 non-clear, satisfying constraint 6 after pos42 is non-clear).
32. Agent pushes stone1 from pos33 to pos32 (agent is at pos33, stone1 is at pos32).
33. Agent pushes stone1 from pos32 to pos42 (agent is at pos32, stone1 is at pos42), achieving the goal.

I think this plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal. Let me double-check the constraints:

1. pos24 can be non-clear at most once continuously: Satisfied, as the agent only passes through pos24 once continuously.
2. pos25 can be non-clear at most once continuously: Satisfied, as the agent only passes through pos25 once continuously.
3. pos32 must be non-clear at least once: Satisfied in step 22 and step 32.
4. If pos32 is non-clear at some state s, then either pos31 is non-clear or player1 is at pos41 at s or some state after s: Satisfied in steps 23 and 24 after pos32 is non-clear in step 22.
5. pos42 must be non-clear at least once: Satisfied in step 25 and step 33.
6. If pos42 is non-clear at some state s, then pos33 must be non-clear at s or some state after s: Satisfied in step 31 after pos42 is non-clear in step 25.
7. player1 must be at pos13 at least once: Satisfied in steps 5 and 13.
8. If player1 is at pos13 at some state s, then pos34 must be non-clear at s or some state after s: Satisfied in step 8 after player1 is at pos13 in step 5.
9. pos54 must be non-clear at least once: Satisfied in step 28.
10. Either pos54 or pos52 must be non-clear at least once: Satisfied in steps 26 and 28.

Actually, I need to be more careful. I need to check specifically what satisfies constraint 8, which requires pos34 to be non-clear after player1 is at pos13. In my plan, player1 is at pos13 in steps 5 and 13, and pos34 is "non-clear" in step 8 (when player1 is there).

Wait, I need to be even more careful. Let's make sure I understand what "non-clear" means. Based on the description, a location is clear if it doesn't have an agent or a stone at it. So, a location is "non-clear" if an agent or a stone is there. From the initial state, it seems the locations have a "clear" predicate associated with them which describes this.

Actually, I think I misunderstood. Let's start with the initial state:
- player1 is at pos35
- stone1 is at pos23
And many locations are described as "clear".

After an action, I'd expect some changes:
- After moving player1 from pos35 to pos34, I'd expect pos35 to be clear and pos34 to be non-clear.

Let me reread the problem and the effects of the actions to clarify this.

OK, here's how I understand it:
- If a location is clear, it means neither agent nor stone is there.
- If an agent is at a location, the location is not clear.
- If a stone is at a location, the location is not clear.

Let's now trace the actions more carefully:

1. Agent moves from pos35 to pos34:
   Effects: 
   - player1 is no longer at pos35
   - pos34 is no longer clear
   - player1 is at pos34
   - pos35 becomes clear

2. Agent moves from pos34 to pos33:
   Effects: 
   - player1 is no longer at pos34
   - pos33 is no longer clear
   - player1 is at pos33
   - pos34 becomes clear

OK, let's think about this again. I need to make a plan for the agent to push the stone to the goal while satisfying all the constraints. I'll trace through the actions more carefully this time, tracking when a location becomes clear or non-clear:

First, let's elaborate on the constraints again:
1. pos24 can be non-clear at most once continuously. This means the agent or stone can only be at pos24 at most once continuously, and then it must become clear again before potentially becoming non-clear again.
2. pos25 can be non-clear at most once continuously. Same as above, but for pos25.
3. pos32 must be non-clear at least once. Either the agent or stone must be at pos32 at some point.
4. If pos32 is non-clear at some state s, then either pos31 is non-clear or player1 is at pos41 at s or some state after s. After pos32 becomes non-clear, at some point (could be the same state or later) either pos31 becomes non-clear or player1 is at pos41.
5. pos42 must be non-clear at least once. Either the agent or stone must be at pos42 at some point.
6. If pos42 is non-clear at some state s, then pos33 must be non-clear at s or some state after s. After pos42 becomes non-clear, at some point (could be the same state or later) pos33 becomes non-clear.
7. player1 must be at pos13 at least once. Self-explanatory.
8. If player1 is at pos13 at some state s, then pos34 must be non-clear at s or some state after s. After player1 is at pos13, at some point (could be the same state or later) pos34 becomes non-clear.
9. pos54 must be non-clear at least once. Either the agent or stone must be at pos54 at some point.
10. Either pos54 or pos52 must be non-clear at least once. At some point, either pos54 or pos52 (or both) become non-clear.

Now, let's create a plan with these constraints in mind. I'll trace through the actions and the resulting state changes to ensure we satisfy all constraints:

1. Agent moves from pos35 to pos34:
   Effects: 
   - player1 is no longer at pos35
   - pos34 is no longer clear
   - player1 is at pos34
   - pos35 becomes clear

2. Agent moves from pos34 to pos33:
   Effects: 
   - player1 is no longer at pos34
   - pos33 is no longer clear
   - player1 is at pos33
   - pos34 becomes clear

3. Agent moves from pos33 to pos23 (getting adjacent to stone1):
   Effects: 
   - player1 is no longer at pos33
   - pos23 is no longer clear
   - player1 is at pos23
   - pos33 becomes clear

4. Agent pushes stone1 from pos23 to pos13 (satisfying constraint 7):
   Effects: 
   - player1 is no longer at pos23
   - stone1 is no longer at pos23
   - pos13 is no longer clear
   - player1 is at pos23
   - stone1 is at pos13
   - stone1 is at a non-goal state

5. Agent moves from pos23 to pos24 (making pos24 non-clear, relevant for constraint 1):
   Effects: 
   - player1 is no longer at pos23
   - pos24 is no longer clear
   - player1 is at pos24
   - pos23 becomes clear

6. Agent moves from pos24 to pos34 (making pos34 non-clear, satisfying constraint 8):
   Effects: 
   - player1 is no longer at pos24
   - pos34 is no longer clear
   - player1 is at pos34
   - pos24 becomes clear

7. Agent moves from pos34 to pos33:
   Effects: 
   - player1 is no longer at pos34
   - pos33 is no longer clear
   - player1 is at pos33
   - pos34 becomes clear

8. Agent moves from pos33 to pos32 (making pos32 non-clear, satisfying constraint 3):
   Effects: 
   - player1 is no longer at pos33
   - pos32 is no longer clear
   - player1 is at pos32
   - pos33 becomes clear

9. Agent moves from pos32 to pos31 (making pos31 non-clear, satisfying constraint 4):
   Effects: 
   - player1 is no longer at pos32
   - pos31 is no longer clear
   - player1 is at pos31
   - pos32 becomes clear

10. Agent moves from pos31 to pos21:
    Effects: 
    - player1 is no longer at pos31
    - pos21 is no longer clear
    - player1 is at pos21
    - pos31 becomes clear

11. Agent moves from pos21 to pos11:
    Effects: 
    - player1 is no longer at pos21
    - pos11 is no longer clear
    - player1 is at pos11
    - pos21 becomes clear

12. Agent moves from pos11 to pos12:
    Effects: 
    - player1 is no longer at pos11
    - pos12 is no longer clear
    - player1 is at pos12
    - pos11 becomes clear

13. Agent moves from pos12 to pos13:
    Effects: 
    - player1 is no longer at pos12
    - pos13 is no longer clear
    - player1 is at pos13
    - pos12 becomes clear
    - stone1 is at pos13 (already established from step 4)

14. Agent pushes stone1 from pos13 to pos23:
    Effects: 
    - player1 is no longer at pos13
    - stone1 is no longer at pos13
    - pos23 is no longer clear
    - player1 is at pos13
    - stone1 is at pos23
    - pos13 becomes clear
    - stone1 is at a non-goal state

Wait, I just realized, the effect of the push would be that player1 is at pos23, not still at pos13. Let me continue with the correct understanding.

14. Agent pushes stone1 from pos13 to pos23:
    Effects: 
    - player1 is no longer at pos13
    - stone1 is no longer at pos13
    - pos23 is no longer clear
    - player1 is at pos13
    - stone1 is at pos23
    - pos13 becomes clear
    - stone1 is at a non-goal state

Wait, let me double-check the effects of a push action. From the problem:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": After performing this action, (i) agent p is no longer at location l_p, (ii) stone s is no longer at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is no longer clear, (iv) agent p is at location l_from, (v) stone s is at location l_to, (vi) location l_p is clear, and (vi) stone s is at a goal state.

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": After performing this action, (i) agent p is no longer at location l_p, (ii) stone s is no longer at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is no longer clear, (iv) agent p is at location l_from, (v) stone s is at location l_to, (vi) location l_p is clear, and (vi) stone s is at a non goal state.

So, for a push action, the agent should be at location l_p, and the stone at location l_from. After the push, the agent will be at l_from, and the stone will be at l_to.

For instance, if player1 is at pos13 and stone1 is at pos23, a push action would move player1 to pos23 and stone1 to, say, pos33. 

But in our step 4, we had player1 at pos23 and stone1 at pos23, which isn't possible. Let me correct our steps.

Alright, let's restart the plan:

1. Agent moves from pos35 to pos34:
   Effects: 
   - player1 is no longer at pos35
   - pos34 is no longer clear
   - player1 is at pos34
   - pos35 becomes clear

2. Agent moves from pos34 to pos33:
   Effects: 
   - player1 is no longer at pos34
   - pos33 is no longer clear
   - player1 is at pos33
   - pos34 becomes clear

3. Agent moves from pos33 to pos32:
   Effects: 
   - player1 is no longer at pos33
   - pos32 is no longer clear
   - player1 is at pos32
   - pos33 becomes clear

4. Agent moves from pos32 to pos31 (making pos31 non-clear, relevant for constraint 4):
   Effects: 
   - player1 is no longer at pos32
   - pos31 is no longer clear
   - player1 is at pos31
   - pos32 becomes clear

5. Agent moves from pos31 to pos32 (making pos32 non-clear again, satisfying constraint 3):
   Effects: 
   - player1 is no longer at pos31
   - pos32 is no longer clear
   - player1 is at pos32
   - pos31 becomes clear

6. Agent moves from pos32 to pos22:
   Effects: 
   - player1 is no longer at pos32
   - pos22 is no longer clear
   - player1 is at pos22
   - pos32 becomes clear

7. Agent moves from pos22 to pos12:
   Effects: 
   - player1 is no longer at pos22
   - pos12 is no longer clear
   - player1 is at pos22
   - pos22 becomes clear

8. Agent moves from pos12 to pos13 (making player1 be at pos13, satisfying constraint 7):
   Effects: 
   - player1 is no longer at pos12
   - pos13 is no longer clear
   - player1 is at pos13
   - pos12 becomes clear

9. Agent moves from pos13 to pos23:
   Effects: 
   - player1 is no longer at pos13
   - pos23 is no longer clear
   - player1 is at pos23
   - pos13 becomes clear
   - stone1 is at pos23 (from initial state)

Wait, here player1 and stone1 would both be at pos23, which doesn't make sense. Let me reconsider from the initial state.

Player1 is at pos35, and stone1 is at pos23. If the agent wants to push the stone, it first needs to be adjacent to it. Let's plan again:

1. Agent moves from pos35 to pos34:
   Effects: 
   - player1 is no longer at pos35
   - pos34 is no longer clear
   - player1 is at pos34
   - pos35 becomes clear

2. Agent moves from pos34 to pos33:
   Effects: 
   - player1 is no longer at pos34
   - pos33 is no longer clear
   - player1 is at pos33
   - pos34 becomes clear

3. Agent pushes stone1 from pos23 to pos13 (with player1 at pos33):
   - player1 is no longer at pos33
   - stone1 is no longer at pos23
   - pos13 is no longer clear
   - player1 is at pos23
   - stone1 is at pos13
   - pos33 becomes clear
   - stone1 is at a non-goal state

Actually, let me re-read the conditions for push. For "pushtonongoal":

You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is not a goal location.

So player1 should be at pos33, stone1 at pos23, and the agent should push the stone to pos13, which should be clear.

I'll reread the moves allowed too:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"

Yes, that's possible. Let's continue with the plan:

1. Agent moves from pos35 to pos34:
   Effects: 
   - player1 is no longer at pos35
   - pos34 is no longer clear
   - player1 is at pos34
   - pos35 becomes clear

2. Agent moves from pos34 to pos33:
   Effects: 
   - player1 is no longer at pos34
   - pos33 is no longer clear
   - player1 is at pos33
   - pos34 becomes clear

3. Agent pushes stone1 from pos23 to pos13 (with player1 at pos33):
   - player1 is no longer at pos33
   - stone1 is no longer at pos23
   - pos13 is no longer clear
   - player1 is at pos23
   - stone1 is at pos13
   - pos33 becomes clear
   - stone1 is at a non-goal state

4. Agent moves from pos23 to pos24 (making pos24 non-clear, relevant for constraint 1):
   Effects: 
   - player1 is no longer at pos23
   - pos24 is no longer clear
   - player1 is at pos24
   - pos23 becomes clear

5. Agent moves from pos24 to pos34 (making pos34 non-clear, satisfying constraint 8 after player1 is at pos13):
   Effects: 
   - player1 is no longer at pos24
   - pos34 is no longer clear
   - player1 is at pos34
   - pos24 becomes clear

6. Agent moves from pos34 to pos44:
   Effects: 
   - player1 is no longer at pos34
   - pos44 is no longer clear
   - player1 is at pos44
   - pos34 becomes clear

7. Agent moves from pos44 to pos54 (making pos54 non-clear, satisfying constraint 9):
   Effects: 
   - player1 is no longer at pos44
   - pos54 is no longer clear
   - player1 is at pos54
   - pos44 becomes clear

8. Agent moves from pos54 to pos53:
   Effects: 
   - player1 is no longer at pos54
   - pos53 is no longer clear
   - player1 is at pos53
   - pos54 becomes clear

9. Agent moves from pos53 to pos52 (making pos52 non-clear, satisfying constraint 10 along with step 7):
   Effects: 
   - player1 is no longer at pos53
   - pos52 is no longer clear
   - player1 is at pos52
   - pos53 becomes clear

10. Agent moves from pos52 to pos42 (making pos42 non-clear, satisfying constraint 5):
    Effects: 
    - player1 is no longer at pos52
    - pos42 is no longer clear
    - player1 is at pos42
    - pos52 becomes clear

11. Agent moves from pos42 to pos32 (making pos32 non-clear, satisfying constraint 3):
    Effects: 
    - player1 is no longer at pos42
    - pos32 is no longer clear
    - player1 is at pos32
    - pos42 becomes clear

12. Agent moves from pos32 to pos31 (making pos31 non-clear, satisfying constraint 4 after pos32 is non-clear):
    Effects: 
    - player1 is no longer at pos32
    - pos31 is no longer clear
    - player1 is at pos31
    - pos32 becomes clear

    - pos21 is no longer clear
    - player1 is at pos21
    - pos31 becomes clear

14. Agent moves from pos21 to pos11:
    Effects: 
    - player1 is no longer at pos21
    - pos11 is no longer clear
    - player1 is at pos11
    - pos21 becomes clear

15. Agent moves from pos11 to pos12:
    Effects: 
    - player1 is no longer at pos11
    - pos12 is no longer clear
    - player1 is at pos12
    - pos11 becomes clear

16. Agent moves from pos12 to pos13 (making agent be at pos13 again, satisfying constraint 7 again, and agent is at same position as stone1):
    Effects: 
    - player1 is no longer at pos12
    - pos13 is no longer clear
    - player1 is at pos13
    - pos12 becomes clear
    - stone1 is at pos13 (from step 3)

Wait, I made another mistake. The clear predicate says a location has neither a stone nor an agent. So in step 16, when player1 is at pos13, and stone1 is also at pos13, I'm making a mistake. They can't both be at the same location. Let me reconsider the plan.

Let me take another approach. I'll trace the clear predicate more carefully to see which positions have an agent, which have a stone, and which are truly clear:

From the initial state:
- player1 is at location pos35
- stone1 is at location pos23

This means those cells are not clear:
- pos35 not clear (has player1)
- pos23 not clear (has stone1)

Let's try again to design a plan to achieve the goal of having stone1 at the goal location (pos42), while satisfying all the constraints:

1. Agent moves from pos35 to pos34:
   - player1 is now at pos34 (not clear)
   - pos35 becomes clear

2. Agent moves from pos34 to pos33:
   - player1 is now at pos33 (not clear)
   - pos34 becomes clear

3. Agent pushes stone1 from pos23 to pos13 (with player1 at pos33):
   For the push, player1 is at pos33, stone1 is at pos23, and the push direction is left. After the push:
   - player1 is at pos23 (not clear)
   - stone1 is at pos13 (not clear)
   - pos33 becomes clear

4. Agent moves from pos23 to pos24:
   - player1 is at pos24 (not clear) (once, satisfying constraint 1)
   - pos23 becomes clear

5. Agent moves from pos24 to pos25:
   - player1 is at pos25 (not clear) (once, satisfying constraint 2)
   - pos24 becomes clear

6. Agent moves from pos25 to pos35:
   - player1 is at pos35 (not clear)
   - pos25 becomes clear

7. Agent moves from pos35 to pos34:
   - player1 is at pos34 (not clear) (satisfying constraint 8 after player1 is at pos13)
   - pos35 becomes clear

8. Agent moves from pos34 to pos44:
   - player1 is at pos44 (not clear)
   - pos34 becomes clear

9. Agent moves from pos44 to pos54:
   - player1 is at pos54 (not clear) (satisfying constraint 9 and part of constraint 10)
   - pos44 becomes clear

10. Agent moves from pos54 to pos53:
    - player1 is at pos53 (not clear)
    - pos54 becomes clear

11. Agent moves from pos53 to pos43:
    - player1 is at pos43 (not clear)
    - pos53 becomes clear

12. Agent moves from pos43 to pos33:
    - player1 is at pos33 (not clear)
    - pos43 becomes clear

13. Agent moves from pos33 to pos32:
    - player1 is at pos32 (not clear) (satisfying constraint 3)
    - pos33 becomes clear

14. Agent moves from pos32 to pos31:
    - player1 is at pos31 (not clear) (satisfying constraint 4 after pos32 is non-clear)
    - pos32 becomes clear

15. Agent moves from pos31 to pos41:
    - player1 is at pos41 (not clear) (also satisfying constraint 4 after pos32 is non-clear)
    - pos31 becomes clear

16. Agent moves from pos41 to pos42:
    - player1 is at pos42 (not clear) (satisfying constraint 5)
    - pos41 becomes clear

17. Agent moves from pos42 to pos32:
    - player1 is at pos32 (not clear) (making pos32 non-clear again)
    - pos42 becomes clear

18. Agent moves from pos32 to pos22:
    - player1 is at pos22 (not clear)
    - pos32 becomes clear

19. Agent moves from pos22 to pos12:
    - player1 is at pos12 (not clear)
    - pos22 becomes clear

20. Agent moves from pos12 to pos13:
    - player1 is at pos13 (not clear) (satisfying constraint 7 again)
    - stone1 is at pos13 (from step 3)
    - pos12 becomes clear

But this doesn't work. In step 20, both player1 and stone1 would be at pos13, which is not valid according to our understanding of the clear predicate.

Let me reconsider the problem, particularly the push actions.

For a push action, the agent should be adjacent to the stone (in the direction from the stone that the agent wants to push), and the stone should be adjacent to a clear position (in the direction the agent wants to push).

So, for example, if the agent is at pos33 and the stone is at pos23, the agent can push the stone left (from pos23 to pos13) because the agent is adjacent to the stone in the direction it wants to push (left), and the position pos13 is clear.

Let me try again with a more careful plan:

1. Agent moves from pos35 to pos34:
   - player1 is now at pos34 (not clear)
   - pos35 becomes clear

2. Agent moves from pos34 to pos33:
   - player1 is now at pos33 (not clear)
   - pos34 becomes clear

3. Agent pushes stone1 from pos23 to pos13 (with player1 at pos33, pushing in the left direction):
   - player1 is now at pos23 (not clear)
   - stone1 is at pos13 (not clear)
   - pos33 becomes clear

4. Agent moves from pos23 to pos13 (INVALID because stone1 is at pos13 from step 3)

I think I made another mistake. Let me reconsider the effects of the push action:

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": After performing this action, (i) agent p is no longer at location l_p, (ii) stone s is no longer at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is no longer clear, (iv) agent p is at location l_from, (v) stone s is at location l_to, (vi) location l_p is clear, and (vi) stone s is at a non goal state.

For the push action, the stone moves from l_from to l_to, and the agent moves from l_p to l_from. The agent is initially at a position one step away from the stone in the direction it wants to push, and the stone moves one step further in that direction.

Here is a correct plan:

1. Agent moves from pos35 to pos34:
   - player1 is now at pos34 (not clear)
   - pos35 becomes clear

2. Agent moves from pos34 to pos33:
   - player1 is now at pos33 (not clear)
   - pos34 becomes clear

3. Agent pushes stone1 from pos23 to pos13 (with player1 at pos33, pushing in the left direction):
   - player1 is now at pos23 (not clear)
   - stone1 is at pos13 (not clear)
   - pos33 becomes clear

4. Agent moves from pos23 to pos24 (making pos24 non-clear, satisfying constraint 1):
   - player1 is at pos24 (not clear)
   - pos23 becomes clear

5. Agent moves from pos24 to pos34:
   - player1 is at pos34 (not clear) (satisfying constraint 8 after player1 is at pos13 from step 3)
   - pos24 becomes clear

6. Agent moves from pos34 to pos44:
   - player1 is at pos44 (not clear)
   - pos34 becomes clear

7. Agent moves from pos44 to pos54 (making pos54 non-clear, satisfying constraint 9 and part of constraint 10):
   - player1 is at pos54 (not clear)
   - pos44 becomes clear

8. Agent moves from pos54 to pos44:
   - player1 is at pos44 (not clear)
   - pos54 becomes clear

9. Agent moves from pos44 to pos43:
   - player1 is at pos43 (not clear)
   - pos44 becomes clear

10. Agent moves from pos43 to pos33:
    - player1 is at pos33 (not clear) (satisfying constraint 6 after pos42 is non-clear in a future step)
    - pos43 becomes clear

11. Agent moves from pos33 to pos32:
    - player1 is at pos32 (not clear) (satisfying constraint 3)
    - pos33 becomes clear

12. Agent moves from pos32 to pos22:
    - player1 is at pos22 (not clear)
    - pos32 becomes clear

13. Agent moves from pos22 to pos12:
    - player1 is at pos12 (not clear)
    - pos22 becomes clear

14. Agent moves from pos12 to pos13 (pos13 is INVALID because stone1 is at pos13 from step 3)

OK, let me reconsider the whole plan again. I need the stone to be at pos42 (the goal location), and I need to satisfy all the constraints. I also need to make sure I don't try to move the agent to a position where the stone already is.

1. Agent moves from pos35 to pos34:
   - player1 is now at pos34 (not clear)
   - pos35 becomes clear

2. Agent moves from pos34 to pos33:
   - player1 is now at pos33 (not clear)
   - pos34 becomes clear

3. Agent pushes stone1 from pos23 to pos22 (with player1 at pos33, pushing in the up direction):
   - player1 is now at pos23 (not clear)
   - stone1 is at pos22 (not clear)
   - pos33 becomes clear

4. Agent moves from pos23 to pos24 (making pos24 non-clear, satisfying constraint 1):
   - player1 is at pos24 (not clear)
   - pos23 becomes clear

5. Agent moves from pos24 to pos25 (making pos25 non-clear, satisfying constraint 2):
   - player1 is at pos25 (not clear)
   - pos24 becomes clear

6. Agent moves from pos25 to pos15:
   - player1 is at pos15 (not clear)
   - pos25 becomes clear

7. Agent moves from pos15 to pos14:
   - player1 is at pos14 (not clear)
   - pos15 becomes clear

8. Agent moves from pos14 to pos13:
   - player1 is at pos13 (not clear) (satisfying constraint 7)
   - pos14 becomes clear

9. Agent moves from pos13 to pos23:
   - player1 is at pos23 (not clear)
   - pos13 becomes clear

10. Agent moves from pos23 to pos33:
    - player1 is at pos33 (not clear) (satisfying constraint 6 after pos42 is non-clear in a future step)
    - pos23 becomes clear

11. Agent moves from pos33 to pos34:
    - player1 is at pos34 (not clear) (satisfying constraint 8 after player1 is at pos13 in step 8)
    - pos33 becomes clear

12. Agent moves from pos34 to pos44:
    - player1 is at pos44 (not clear)
    - pos34 becomes clear

13. Agent moves from pos44 to pos54 (making pos54 non-clear, satisfying constraint 9 and part of constraint 10):
    - player1 is at pos54 (not clear)
    - pos44 becomes clear

14. Agent moves from pos54 to pos53:
    - player1 is at pos53 (not clear)
    - pos54 becomes clear

15. Agent moves from pos53 to pos43:
    - player1 is at pos43 (not clear)
    - pos53 becomes clear

16. Agent moves from pos43 to pos33:
    - player1 is at pos33 (not clear)
    - pos43 becomes clear

17. Agent moves from pos33 to pos32:
    - player1 is at pos32 (not clear) (satisfying constraint 3)
    - pos33 becomes clear

18. Agent moves from pos32 to pos31:
    - player1 is at pos31 (not clear) (satisfying constraint 4 after pos32 is non-clear in step 17)
    - pos32 becomes clear

19. Agent moves from pos31 to pos41:
    - player1 is at pos41 (not clear) (also satisfying constraint 4 after pos32 is non-clear in step 17)
    - pos31 becomes clear

20. Agent moves from pos41 to pos42:
    - player1 is at pos42 (not clear) (satisfying constraint 5)
    - pos41 becomes clear

21. Agent moves from pos42 to pos32:
    - player1 is at pos32 (not clear) (making pos32 non-clear again)
    - pos42 becomes clear

22. Agent moves from pos32 to pos22:
    - player1 is at pos22 (not clear)
    - pos32 becomes clear
    - stone1 is at pos22 (from step 3) (the agent would push the stone, not move to its position)

Ah, I see the mistake again. In the last step, the agent can't simply move to the position of the stone. Let's restart the plan:

1. Agent moves from pos35 to pos34:
   - player1 is now at pos34 (not clear)
   - pos35 becomes clear

2. Agent moves from pos34 to pos33:
   - player1 is now at pos33 (not clear)
   - pos34 becomes clear

3. Agent pushes stone1 from pos23 to pos22 (with player1 at pos33, pushing in the up direction):
   - player1 is now at pos23 (not clear)
   - stone1 is at pos22 (not clear)
   - pos33 becomes clear

4. Agent moves from pos23 to pos24 (making pos24 non-clear, satisfying constraint 1):
   - player1 is at pos24 (not clear)
   - pos23 becomes clear

5. Agent moves from pos24 to pos25 (making pos25 non-clear, satisfying constraint 2):
   - player1 is at pos25 (not clear)
   - pos24 becomes clear

   - player1 is at pos15 (not clear)
   - pos25 becomes clear

7. Agent moves from pos15 to pos14:
   - player1 is at pos14 (not clear)
   - pos15 becomes clear

8. Agent moves from pos14 to pos13:
   - player1 is at pos13 (not clear) (satisfying constraint 7)
   - pos14 becomes clear

9. Agent moves from pos13 to pos23:
   - player1 is at pos23 (not clear)
   - pos13 becomes clear

10. Agent moves from pos23 to pos33:
    - player1 is at pos33 (not clear) (satisfying constraint 6 after pos42 is non-clear in a future step)
    - pos23 becomes clear

11. Agent moves from pos33 to pos34:
    - player1 is at pos34 (not clear) (satisfying constraint 8 after player1 is at pos13 in step 8)
    - pos33 becomes clear

12. Agent moves from pos34 to pos44:
    - player1 is at pos44 (not clear)
    - pos34 becomes clear

13. Agent moves from pos44 to pos54 (making pos54 non-clear, satisfying constraint 9 and part of constraint 10):
    - player1 is at pos54 (not clear)
    - pos44 becomes clear

14. Agent moves from pos54 to pos53:
    - player1 is at pos53 (not clear)
    - pos54 becomes clear

15. Agent moves from pos53 to pos43:
    - player1 is at pos43 (not clear)
    - pos53 becomes clear

16. Agent moves from pos43 to pos33:
    - player1 is at pos33 (not clear)
    - pos43 becomes clear

17. Agent moves from pos33 to pos32:
    - player1 is at pos32 (not clear) (satisfying constraint 3)
    - pos33 becomes clear

18. Agent moves from pos32 to pos31:
    - player1 is at pos31 (not clear) (satisfying constraint 4 after pos32 is non-clear in step 17)
    - pos32 becomes clear

19. Agent moves from pos31 to pos21:
    - player1 is at pos21 (not clear)
    - pos31 becomes clear

20. Agent pushes stone1 from pos22 to pos32 (with player1 at pos21, pushing in the right direction):
    - player1 is now at pos22 (not clear)
    - stone1 is at pos32 (not clear)
    - pos21 becomes clear

21. Agent moves from pos22 to pos12:
    - player1 is at pos12 (not clear)
    - pos22 becomes clear

22. Agent moves from pos12 to pos11:
    - player1 is at pos11 (not clear)
    - pos12 becomes clear

23. Agent moves from pos11 to pos21:
    - player1 is at pos21 (not clear)
    - pos11 becomes clear

24. Agent moves from pos21 to pos31:
    - player1 is at pos31 (not clear)
    - pos21 becomes clear

25. Agent moves from pos31 to pos41:
    - player1 is at pos41 (not clear) (satisfying constraint 4 again after pos32 is non-clear in step 20)
    - pos31 becomes clear

26. Agent pushes stone1 from pos32 to pos42 (with player1 at pos41, pushing in the down direction):
    - player1 is now at pos32 (not clear)
    - stone1 is at pos42 (not clear) (pos42 is a goal location, stone1 is at a goal state)
    - pos41 becomes clear
    - pos42 is not clear (satisfying constraint 5)

This plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal of having stone1 at the goal location (pos42). Let's check the constraints again:

1. pos24 can be non-clear at most once continuously: Satisfied, in step 4.
2. pos25 can be non-clear at most once continuously: Satisfied, in step 5.
3. pos32 must be non-clear at least once: Satisfied, in steps 17, 20, and 26.
4. If pos32 is non-clear at some state s, then either pos31 is non-clear or player1 is at pos41 at s or some state after s: Satisfied, in steps 18 (pos31 is non-clear) and 25 (player1 is at pos41).
5. pos42 must be non-clear at least once: Satisfied, in step 26.
6. If pos42 is non-clear at some state s, then pos33 must be non-clear at s or some state after s: Satisfied, in step 10 (pos33 is non-clear).
7. player1 must be at pos13 at least once: Satisfied, in step 8.
8. If player1 is at pos13 at some state s, then pos34 must be non-clear at s or some state after s: Satisfied, in step 11 (pos34 is non-clear).
9. pos54 must be non-clear at least once: Satisfied, in step 13.
10. Either pos54 or pos52 must be non-clear at least once: Satisfied, in step 13 (pos54 is non-clear).

The plan is valid and achieves the goal. So, here's the final plan:
1. Move player1 from pos35 to pos34 following dirup
2. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33 following dirup
3. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos22 dirup

24. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 following dirright
25. Move player1 from pos31 to pos41 following dirright
26. Pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos32 pos42 dirdown
