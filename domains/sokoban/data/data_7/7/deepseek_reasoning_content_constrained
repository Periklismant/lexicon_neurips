Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. First, I need to understand the initial state and the goal. The agent (player1) starts at pos35, and the stone (stone1) is at pos23. The goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. The only goal location mentioned is pos42. So the main objective is to move stone1 from pos23 to pos42.

But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy. Let's list them out:

1. pos24 not clear can be true in at most one continuous sequence. So we can't have pos24 occupied multiple times non-consecutively.
2. Similarly for pos25.
3. pos32 must be not clear at least once.
4. If pos32 is not clear in some state, then either pos31 is not clear or player1 is at pos41 must hold in that state or later.
5. pos42 must be not clear at least once. But since that's the goal, once the stone is there, pos42 will be not clear. So maybe that's covered when we push the stone there.
6. If pos42 is not clear (which it will be when the stone is there), then pos33 must not be clear at some point after. So after moving the stone to pos42, we need to make sure pos33 is not clear in a subsequent state. But how? Maybe the agent moves there?
7. The agent must be at pos13 at least once. And when they are, pos34 must not be clear afterward. So after being at pos13, something needs to occupy pos34. Maybe the agent moves there, or pushes a stone there? But there's only one stone. Wait, the stone is supposed to be at pos42 eventually. So perhaps the agent moves to pos34 after being at pos13.
8. pos54 must be not clear at least once. Since the agent can move there, but pos54 is not a goal. So maybe the agent needs to step on pos54 at some point.
9. At least once, either pos54 or pos52 is not clear. So covering pos54 would satisfy this, but if not, then pos52 needs to be occupied.

Now, let's think about the path. The stone is at pos23. The goal is pos42. The agent starts at pos35. So the agent needs to get to the stone's location to push it. But pos23's adjacent positions: from pos23, you can move to pos13 (dirleft), pos33 (dirright), pos22 (dirup), or pos24 (dirdown). The agent needs to get to a position adjacent to the stone to push it.

Let me sketch the possible path for the stone. From pos23, to pos24 (dirdown), then to pos34 (dirright), then to pos44 (dirright), but that's not a goal. Alternatively, from pos23 to pos33 (dirright), then to pos43 (dirright), but that's not a goal. Wait, the goal is pos42. So perhaps pushing the stone up from pos23 to pos22, then left to pos32, then right to pos42? Let me check the movement directions.

Wait, the movement between positions is predefined. Let me check the allowed moves.

From pos23, possible directions:

- dirleft (to pos13)
- dirright (to pos33)
- dirup (to pos22)
- dirdown (to pos24)

So to push the stone towards pos42, which is in the pos32's dirright (pos32 → pos42). So the stone needs to be moved to pos33, then to pos34, then to pos44, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe push the stone up to pos22, then right to pos32, then right to pos42. That seems better.

So let's see:

Current stone position: pos23.

First, agent needs to get to pos22 (above the stone) to push it down to pos23→pos24? No, but the goal is pos42, which is in the upper right. Alternatively, agent could push the stone up from pos23 to pos22, then push it right to pos32, then right to pos42.

But let's check if that's possible.

From pos23, pushing up (dirup) would require the agent to be at pos22. Wait, to push the stone from pos23 to pos22 (dirup), the agent would need to be at pos22, but that's where the stone would be moving. Wait no, pushing requires the agent to be adjacent in the direction of the push. Wait, the pushtogoal action requires that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's current position), and the stone moves from l_from to l_to in direction d. So for example, to push the stone from pos23 to pos22 (dirup), the agent must be at pos23's dirup direction's adjacent. Wait, the direction is the direction from l_p to l_from. So the agent is at l_p, which must be adjacent to l_from in direction d. So for example, to push the stone from pos23 to pos22, the agent would need to be at pos22 (since the direction from l_p (pos22) to l_from (pos23) is dirdown. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait the preconditions for pushtogoal are:

- agent p is at l_p.

- stone s is at l_from.

- l_to is clear.

- You can get from l_p to l_from following direction d. So direction d is the direction from l_p to l_from. Then, from l_from, you can go to l_to in the same direction d. So for example, if the agent is at pos22 (l_p), and the stone is at pos23 (l_from), then the direction from l_p (pos22) to l_from (pos23) is dirdown. Then, from l_from (pos23), moving in direction dirdown would take us to pos24. So pushing from pos23 to pos24 with the agent at pos22. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the agent is at pos13 (l_p), and the stone is at pos23 (l_from). The direction from pos13 to pos23 is dirright. Then, pushing the stone in dirright direction from pos23 to pos33. So that's possible. Then, the stone moves to pos33, and then from there to pos43, etc. But pos42 is the goal. So maybe another path.

Alternatively, the agent could move to pos32 (which is adjacent to pos42) and push the stone from pos32 to pos42. But how does the stone get to pos32?

Alternatively, perhaps the stone can be pushed from pos23 to pos24, then to pos34, then to pos44, but pos44 is not a goal. So that's not helpful. Wait, but the goal is pos42. So maybe the stone needs to go up to pos22, then right to pos32, then right to pos42.

Let me think about the movement steps:

1. Agent starts at pos35. Need to get to pos22 to push the stone up.

Wait, initial agent position is pos35. How to get to pos22? Let's see the allowed moves.

From pos35, possible directions:

- dirleft (to pos25)

- dirright (to pos45)

- dirup (to pos34)

So from pos35, the agent can move up to pos34. Then from pos34, where can they go?

pos34 can go dirleft to pos24, dirright to pos44, dirup to pos33, or dirdown to pos35 (back). To get to pos22, the agent would need to move up to pos34, then to pos33, then to pos32, then to pos22? Let's see.

pos34 → pos33 (dirup). Then pos33 can move dirup to pos32? Let's check the allowed moves from pos33. The allowed moves are:

From pos33: dirleft (to pos23), dirright (to pos43), dirup (to pos32), dirdown (to pos34).

So from pos33, moving up (dirup) takes the agent to pos32.

Then from pos32, possible moves: dirleft (pos22), dirright (pos42), dirup (pos31), dirdown (pos33). So from pos32, moving left to pos22.

So the path from pos35 to pos22 would be: pos35 → pos34 (dirup), pos34 → pos33 (dirup), pos33 → pos32 (dirup), pos32 → pos22 (dirleft). That's four moves.

Once at pos22, the agent can push the stone from pos23 (l_from) to pos22 (l_to?) Wait, no. The stone is at pos23. To push it, the agent needs to be adjacent. So to push the stone from pos23 to pos22 (dirup), the agent must be at pos23's dirup direction, which is pos22. So agent is at pos22, stone is at pos23. Then, the direction from l_p (pos22) to l_from (pos23) is dirdown. So the direction is dirdown. Then, from l_from (pos23), moving in direction dirdown would take the stone to pos24. Wait, that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps pushing the stone from pos23 to pos13 (dirleft), but then the agent would need to be at pos13's direction to pos23, which is dirright. Wait, let me clarify.

If the agent is at pos22, and the stone is at pos23, the direction from agent's position (pos22) to stone's position (pos23) is dirdown. So the direction d is dirdown. Then, the stone is pushed in the same direction d (dirdown) from l_from (pos23) to l_to (pos24). But pos24 is a non-goal location. But if we use pushtonongoal, that's allowed. But the final goal is to get the stone to a goal location (pos42). So perhaps pushing the stone to pos24 is not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the stone to pos33.

To push the stone from pos23 to pos33 (dirright), the agent needs to be at pos23's dirright direction's adjacent, which is pos33's left (dirleft). Wait, no. Let's think again. For the agent to push the stone from pos23 to pos33 (dirright), the agent must be at a position such that the direction from the agent's location to pos23 is dirright. So agent must be to the left of pos23. pos23's left is pos13. So if the agent is at pos13, direction from pos13 to pos23 is dirright. Then, pushing the stone in dirright direction from pos23 to pos33. That would require the agent to be at pos13.

So to do that, the agent needs to get to pos13. Let's see the path from pos35 to pos13. How?

Current agent position: pos35. To get to pos13, possible path:

pos35 → pos34 (dirup)

pos34 → pos33 (dirup)

pos33 → pos32 (dirup)

pos32 → pos22 (dirleft)

pos22 → pos23 (dirdown) → but pos23 has the stone, so can't move there. Wait, no. The agent can't move into a location that's not clear. Initially, pos23 is clear (since stone is there, but "Location pos23 is clear" is in the initial state. Wait, the initial state says "Location pos23 is clear", but "stone1 is at location pos23". Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, in the initial state, the list includes "Location pos23 is clear" but also "stone1 is at location pos23". Wait, that's a contradiction. Because if a stone is at pos23, then pos23 should not be clear. But according to the problem statement, the initial state says:

"stone1 is at location pos23"

"Location pos23 is clear"

Wait, that can't be. That must be a mistake. Wait, let me check again.

Looking back at the original state:

Under "The original state of the world is the following", the lines include:

"player1 is at location pos35"

"stone1 is at location pos23"

Then, later:

"Location pos23 is clear"

But if the stone is at pos23, then pos23 should not be clear. So this must be an error in the problem statement. But perhaps "clear" here refers to the agent not being there. Because stones and agent can be in the same location? No, because the move action requires that the destination is clear, which would include both agent and stones. Wait, but according to the problem description, each position may contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. So a location is clear if it has neither the agent nor a stone. So if a stone is present, the location is not clear. Therefore, the initial state is contradictory. But this must be a mistake in the problem setup. Maybe "Location pos23 is clear" is a typo. Let me check again.

Looking back: the original state lists:

"Location pos11 is clear"

... (many lines)

"Location pos23 is clear"

But "stone1 is at location pos23". That's impossible. Therefore, this must be a mistake. But since the problem is given as such, perhaps I have to proceed under the assumption that the stone is at pos23 and pos23 is not clear. Wait, but the problem says:

"Location pos23 is clear"

So according to the problem, pos23 is clear (no agent, no stone), but also "stone1 is at location pos23". That's impossible. So there's a mistake here. Wait, maybe "Location pos23 is clear" is a mistake. Looking at the list of original state, after listing all clear locations except pos23 and pos35:

Wait, the original state includes:

"Location pos23 is clear"

But then, "stone1 is at location pos23". That's conflicting. This must be an error. But perhaps in the problem, the stone's presence doesn't block the location? Or maybe "clear" refers only to the agent. But the problem statement says each position may contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. So a location is clear if it has neither. Therefore, the initial state is invalid. But the problem says this is the original state, so perhaps it's a mistake, and we have to assume that the stone is at pos23, making pos23 not clear. But the problem says "Location pos23 is clear". Hmm. This is confusing. Maybe it's a typo, and the stone is at pos33 or another location. But according to the problem, the stone is at pos23. So perhaps the problem statement has an error, but we have to proceed with the given information.

Alternatively, maybe the "clear" in the problem refers to the absence of the agent, and stones don't affect it. But that contradicts the problem description. So this is a problem. How to resolve this?

Alternatively, perhaps "clear" refers to the agent not being present. So a stone can be present but the location is considered clear for the agent's movement. But according to the move action's preconditions, the destination must be clear. If a stone is there, the location is not clear. So the initial state is invalid. Therefore, perhaps the problem statement intended that the stone is at pos23, making pos23 not clear, but the original state says it is. This is a contradiction.

But since the problem is given as is, I need to proceed. Maybe the "Location pos23 is clear" was a mistake and should not be there. Let me check again the list of clear locations in the original state:

The original state lists:

"Location pos11 is clear"

... (many lines)

"Location pos23 is clear" – this is the problematic line.

But if the stone is at pos23, then this line is incorrect. So perhaps the problem has a typo. For the sake of solving the problem, perhaps we should assume that the stone's location (pos23) is not clear. Therefore, pos23 is occupied by the stone, so it's not clear. But the problem says it's clear. This is a conflict, but maybe the user intended that. How to proceed?

Alternatively, maybe the problem statement is correct, and there's a misunderstanding. Let's re-examine the problem's initial state:

The original state includes:

"stone1 is at location pos23"

"Location pos23 is clear"

So according to the problem, pos23 is clear despite having a stone. That's impossible under the problem's definition. Therefore, this must be a mistake. To proceed, perhaps the correct initial state is that pos23 is not clear, and the stone is there. Therefore, when solving, we'll consider pos23 as not clear.

Assuming that, the agent starts at pos35 (which is clear, as per "Location pos35 is clear"), and stone1 is at pos23 (so pos23 is not clear).

Now, the agent needs to move to a position adjacent to the stone to push it. Since the stone is at pos23, adjacent positions are pos22 (up), pos13 (left), pos24 (down), pos33 (right).

The agent starts at pos35. To reach pos23's adjacent positions:

Option 1: Move to pos33 (right of pos23). To get there, agent needs to go from pos35 to pos34 (dirup), then pos34 to pos33 (dirup), then pos33 to pos32 (dirup), then pos32 to pos22 (dirleft), then pos22 to pos23 (dirdown) – but pos23 is occupied by the stone. So agent can't move there. Alternatively, from pos33, the agent can move to pos23 via dirleft, but again, pos23 is occupied.

Wait, the agent can't move into a location that's not clear. So to push the stone from pos23 to pos33 (dirright), the agent must be at pos23's left (pos13) or right (pos33) but pos33 is clear. Wait, no. To push the stone to the right (dirright), the agent must be on the left side of the stone (pos13) and push it right. Or on the right side (pos33) and push it further right, but pos33 is clear. Wait, but the stone is at pos23. So to push it to pos33 (dirright), the agent must be at pos23's left (pos13) and push it right. Because the direction from the agent's position to the stone's position is dirright. So the agent is at pos13, direction dirright to pos23. Then, the stone is pushed dirright to pos33.

So the agent needs to get to pos13. How?

Path from pos35 to pos13:

pos35 → pos34 (dirup)

pos34 → pos33 (dirup)

pos33 → pos32 (dirup)

pos32 → pos22 (dirleft)

pos22 → pos12 (dirleft)

pos12 → pos13 (dirdown)

So that's a series of moves. But that's six move actions. Then, from pos13, the agent can push the stone to pos33 using pushtogoal or pushtonongoal. Since pos33 is not a goal location, we have to use pushtonongoal. Wait, but the goal is to get the stone to pos42. So pushing it to pos33 is a step towards that.

But pushing the stone to pos33 would make pos33 not clear. Then, from pos33, the agent can push it further to pos43 (dirright), but pos43 is not a goal. Alternatively, push it up to pos32, but pos32 is adjacent to pos42.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos33, the agent could move around to pos43 and push it up to pos42, but pos43 to pos42 is dirup? Let me check the allowed directions.

From pos43, you can move dirleft to pos33, dirright to pos53, dirup to pos42, dirdown to pos44. So from pos43, dirup to pos42. So if the stone is at pos43, the agent could push it up to pos42 (which is a goal). But how to get the stone from pos33 to pos43.

So the plan could be:

1. Agent moves from pos35 to pos34 (move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup)
2. pos34 to pos33 (move ...)
3. pos33 to pos32
4. pos32 to pos22
5. pos22 to pos12
6. pos12 to pos13
7. At pos13, push the stone from pos23 to pos33 (pushtonongoal, since pos33 is not a goal)
   - Preconditions check: agent at pos13, stone at pos23, pos33 is clear, direction from pos13 to pos23 is dirright, direction from pos23 to pos33 is dirright (same direction)
   - After this, agent is at pos23, stone at pos33
8. Then, agent needs to push the stone from pos33 to pos43 (dirright). For that, agent must be at pos33's left (pos23) or right (pos43). Wait, to push from pos33 to pos43 (dirright), agent must be at pos33's left (pos23) and direction dirright to pos33. But pos23 is now clear (after step 7, agent is at pos23). Wait, after step 7, agent is at pos_from, which is pos23. Because when you push, the agent moves to l_from (pos23) after the action.

Wait, the effects of pushtonongoal are:

- agent is no longer at l_p (pos13)
- stone is no longer at l_from (pos23)
- l_to (pos33) is no longer clear
- agent is now at l_from (pos23)
- stone is at l_to (pos33)
- l_p (pos13) is clear

So after pushing, agent is at pos23, stone at pos33.

Now, agent is at pos23. To push the stone from pos33 to pos43 (dirright), the agent needs to be at pos33's left (pos23), direction dirright. So agent is at pos23, stone is at pos33. Then, direction from agent's pos23 to stone's pos33 is dirright. So the agent can perform pushtonongoal: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright.

But need to check preconditions:

- agent is at pos23 (yes)
- stone is at pos33 (yes)
- pos43 is clear (initially, yes)
- direction from pos23 to pos33 is dirright? Let's check allowed moves: From pos23, you can move to pos33 via dirright. So yes, direction dirright is allowed.

So after this action, the stone moves to pos43, agent moves to pos33.

Now, agent is at pos33, stone at pos43.

Next, push the stone from pos43 to pos42 (dirup). To do this, agent needs to be at pos43's down direction (pos53?) or up. Wait, to push the stone from pos43 to pos42 (dirup), the agent must be at pos43's dirup direction, which is pos42? No, the direction from agent's location to stone's location must be dirup. So the agent needs to be south of the stone (pos43). To push north (dirup), the agent must be at pos53 (south of pos43), but that's not adjacent. Wait, pos43's south is pos44 (dirdown). Hmm.

Alternatively, agent can be at pos43's west (pos33) and push east (dirright) to pos43 to pos53, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, agent can be at pos42 (north of pos43) and push south (dirdown) to pos43 to pos44. But that's not helpful.

Wait, the desired direction for the stone to move from pos43 to pos42 (dirup). So the agent needs to be south of pos43 (pos44?), but pos43's south is pos44. So agent at pos44, direction dirdown to pos43. Then, pushing the stone from pos43 to pos42 (dirup) would require the direction from agent's location (pos44) to stone's location (pos43) is dirup. Then, from stone's location (pos43), moving dirup to pos42. So yes. So the agent would need to be at pos44 to push the stone up to pos42.

But how does the agent get to pos44 from pos33 after pushing the stone to pos43?

Path from pos33 to pos44:

pos33 → pos34 (dirdown)

pos34 → pos44 (dirright)

But pos34 to pos44: allowed? Check the allowed moves. From pos34, you can move dirright to pos44. Yes. So:

Agent is at pos33 after pushing to pos43.

Move from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown).

Then from pos34 to pos44 (dirright).

Now agent is at pos44. Then, push the stone from pos43 to pos42 (dirup).

Check preconditions:

- agent at pos44 (l_p)
- stone at pos43 (l_from)
- pos42 is clear (initially yes, but after previous steps? The stone was moved to pos43, so pos43 is not clear. pos42 is initially clear. So pos42 is clear unless something else is there. Agent is at pos44, so pos44 is not clear. So pos42 is clear.

Direction from pos44 to pos43 is dirleft. Because pos44 is to the right of pos43. Wait, pos44 is east of pos43. So direction from pos44 to pos43 is dirleft. Then, from pos43, moving dirleft would take it to pos33. But we want to move it up to pos42. So this approach isn't working.

Wait, maybe the agent needs to be at pos53 (south of pos43) to push it north. But pos53 is far away. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, after the stone is at pos43, the agent can move to pos42 (which is a goal location) and then push the stone up from pos43 to pos42. But how?

Wait, pos42 is north of pos43. So to push the stone from pos43 to pos42 (dirup), the agent must be at pos43's south (pos44) and push north. Wait, no. The direction from the agent's location to the stone's location must be the same as the direction the stone is being pushed. So to push the stone north (dirup), the agent must be south of the stone (pos44), and the direction from agent's pos44 to stone's pos43 is dirup. Wait, no: pos44 is east of pos43. So direction from pos44 to pos43 is dirleft. So pushing in dirleft direction would move the stone from pos43 to pos42. Wait, no. Let me clarify the movement directions.

The allowed moves between locations are predefined. From pos43, can you move to pos42? Looking at the original allowed moves:

From pos43: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown".

Ah, so from pos43, moving dirup takes you to pos42. So the direction from pos43 to pos42 is dirup. Therefore, to push the stone from pos43 to pos42 (dirup), the agent must be at a location from which the direction to pos43 is dirup. That would require the agent to be at pos53 (south of pos43), but dirup from pos53 to pos43 is not allowed. Wait, according to the allowed moves, from pos53 you can move to pos43 via dirleft (since pos53 is east of pos43, moving dirleft would go west to pos43). Wait, no:

Looking at the allowed moves:

For pos53: "You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos53 to location pos52 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown".

So from pos53, dirleft takes you to pos43. So direction from pos53 to pos43 is dirleft. Therefore, to push the stone from pos43 to pos42 (dirup), the agent needs to be at a location where the direction to pos43 is dirup. That location would be pos53's north? No, pos53's north is pos52. Hmm.

Alternatively, the agent can be at pos42 and push the stone up. But pos42 is north of pos43. So direction from pos42 to pos43 is dirdown. So the agent at pos42 can push the stone in dirdown direction to pos43, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, the agent needs to be south of pos43 (pos44) and push north. Let's check:

From pos44, can you move to pos43? Yes: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown".

So direction from pos44 to pos43 is dirup. Therefore, if the agent is at pos44, the direction to pos43 is dirup. Then, the stone is at pos43. So the agent can perform pushtogoal (since pos42 is a goal) action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup.

Check preconditions:

- agent at pos44 (yes)
- stone at pos43 (yes)
- pos42 is clear (yes, initially)
- direction from pos44 to pos43 is dirup (yes)
- from pos43, direction dirup to pos42 (yes)
- pos42 is a goal (yes)

So this action is valid. After this, the stone is at pos42 (goal), agent is at pos43.

This would satisfy the main goal. Now, we need to check all the constraints.

Let's list the constraints again:

1. pos24 not clear in at most one continuous sequence.
2. pos25 not clear in at most one continuous sequence.
3. pos32 not clear at least once.
4. If pos32 not clear, then pos31 not clear or player1 at pos41 in that state or later.
5. pos42 not clear at least once (achieved when stone is there).
6. If pos42 not clear (when stone is there), then pos33 must not be clear at some point after. So after pushing to pos42, pos33 must be not clear. But after pushing to pos43, pos33 was clear (agent moved from pos33 to pos34). Unless the agent is at pos33 again. But after pushing to pos43, the agent is at pos44. Then, after pushing to pos42, the agent is at pos43. So pos33 is clear. Hmm. So this constraint may not be satisfied. So this plan may not work.

Wait, after the stone is at pos42, the constraint is that pos33 must be not clear at some state after. So we need to ensure that after pos42 is not clear (when the stone is there), pos33 is not clear in some subsequent state. How?

Maybe after pushing the stone to pos42, the agent can move to pos33, making it not clear. But that would require a move action to pos33. Let's see:

After the stone is at pos42, agent is at pos43. From pos43, can the agent move to pos33?

pos43 → pos33 (dirleft). Yes. So:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup (stone at pos42, agent at pos43)

Then move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft).

Now, pos33 is not clear (agent there). This satisfies the constraint that after pos42 is not clear, pos33 is not clear. So this would satisfy constraint 6.

Now, let's check other constraints.

3. pos32 must be not clear at least once. In the current plan, when does pos32 get occupied? In the initial path, when the agent moves from pos32 to pos22. The agent was at pos32 (when moving from pos33 to pos32 to pos22). So pos32 was occupied then. But that's before the stone is pushed to pos42. So that counts as pos32 being not clear. So constraint 3 is satisfied.

4. If pos32 is not clear (when agent was there), then either pos31 is not clear or player1 is at pos41 in that state or later. So when the agent was at pos32, we need to ensure that either pos31 is not clear (which it wasn't) or the agent later moves to pos41. So after being at pos32, the agent needs to eventually reach pos41.

But in the current plan, the agent moves from pos32 to pos22, then to pos12, pos13, then pushes the stone, moves to pos23, pos33, pos34, pos44, then to pos43, and finally to pos33. So the agent doesn't go to pos41. So constraint 4 is not satisfied. So this plan is invalid.

So we need to adjust the plan to ensure that after pos32 is occupied, either pos31 is occupied or the agent moves to pos41.

How to do that? One way is to have the agent move to pos41 after being at pos32. But that would add steps. Alternatively, during the initial movement, after pos32, the agent could go to pos42 instead of pos22. But pos42 is a goal location, but initially clear. Let's think.

Alternative path for agent:

After reaching pos32, instead of going to pos22, move to pos42. But pos42 is clear initially. So:

pos35 → pos34 → pos33 → pos32 → pos42 (dirright). But from pos32, can the agent move to pos42 via dirright? Yes, according to allowed moves: "You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright". So that's a possible move.

Then, from pos42, the agent can move to pos52 (dirright), but that's not helpful. Alternatively, the agent can move to pos32 again. But this doesn't help. However, moving to pos42 would occupy pos42, which is a goal. But the stone isn't there yet, so that's allowed. Then, after pos42 is occupied by the agent, when the stone is pushed there, the agent would have to move away. But this complicates things.

Alternatively, after the stone is at pos42, the agent needs to go to pos41. Let's see. After the stone is at pos42, agent is at pos43. Then, move to pos44 → pos54 → pos53 → pos52 → pos51 → pos41. That's a long path, but possible. Then, when the agent is at pos41, constraint 4 is satisfied (if pos32 was occupied earlier).

But this adds several steps. How to fit this into the plan while keeping it optimal.

Alternatively, during the initial movement, after the agent is at pos32, they move to pos42 (making pos42 not clear), then move to pos41. But this would satisfy the constraint. Let's try:

Agent's path:

1. pos35 → pos34 (dirup)
2. pos34 → pos33 (dirup)
3. pos33 → pos32 (dirup)
4. pos32 → pos42 (dirright) → now pos42 is not clear (agent there)
5. pos42 → pos41 (dirup) → since from pos42, dirup is to pos41? Let's check allowed moves.

From pos42: "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos42 to location pos52 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos42 to location pos41 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown".

Yes, dirup from pos42 to pos41. So agent moves to pos41. Now, pos41 is occupied.

This way, when pos32 was occupied (step 3), the agent later moves to pos41, satisfying constraint 4.

But now, the agent is at pos41. How to proceed to push the stone? The stone is still at pos23. The agent is far away. This complicates the path. So this approach may not be optimal.

Alternative approach: Include a visit to pos41 after pos32 to satisfy constraint 4.

But this adds steps. Let's see.

Original agent path to pos13 was:

pos35 → pos34 → pos33 → pos32 → pos22 → pos12 → pos13 → push to pos33 → ... 

But if after pos32, the agent goes to pos42 → pos41 → then back to pos42 → pos32 → pos22 etc. But this adds many steps. Not optimal.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos42, the agent moves to pos43 → pos44 → pos54 (to satisfy pos54 not clear constraint). Then, from pos54, move to pos53 → pos52 (to satisfy pos52 not clear). But this might help with constraint 9.

Alternatively, during the plan, ensure that pos54 is occupied. For example, after pushing the stone to pos42, the agent moves to pos54. Let's see:

After pushtogoal to pos42, agent is at pos43. Then move to pos44 → pos54 (dirright). This makes pos54 not clear. Then, move to pos53 → pos52 (dirdown), making pos52 not clear. This satisfies constraint 9 (either pos54 or pos52 not clear).

Also, pos54 not clear at least once (satisfied).

Now, let's check all constraints:

1. pos24 not clear in at most one continuous sequence.

In the current plan, when is pos24 not clear? If the stone is pushed to pos24. But in this plan, the stone is moved from pos23 → pos33 → pos43 → pos42. So pos24 is never occupied. So this constraint is satisfied.

2. pos25 not clear in at most one sequence.

Similarly, pos25 is only occupied if the agent moves there. But in the plan, the agent starts at pos35, moves up to pos34, etc. So pos25 is never occupied. So satisfied.

3. pos32 not clear at least once. Yes, when agent was at pos32 during movement.

4. If pos32 not clear, then pos31 not clear or player1 at pos41 in that state or later. Agent was at pos32, then moved to pos42 → pos41. So later, agent is at pos41. So this condition is satisfied.

5. pos42 not clear at least once. Yes, when stone is there.

6. If pos42 not clear, then pos33 not clear at some point after. After pos42 is not clear, agent moves to pos43 → pos33. So pos33 is not clear (agent there). So satisfied.

7. Agent must be at pos13 at least once. In the plan, agent moves to pos13 to push the stone. Satisfied.

8. When agent is at pos13, pos34 must not be clear afterward. After pos13, agent pushes the stone to pos33 (agent moves to pos23). Then, the agent moves to pos33 → pos34. So pos34 is occupied by the agent. So pos34 not clear after being at pos13. Satisfied.

9. pos54 must be not clear at least once. Agent moves to pos54 after pos44. Satisfied.

10. Either pos54 or pos52 not clear at least once. Both are satisfied if agent moves to pos54 and pos52.

So incorporating these steps:

Plan steps:

1. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup
2. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
3. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
4. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright
5. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
6. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
7. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
8. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft
9. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft
10. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirright
12. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
13. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirright (Wait, no. To push from pos33 to pos43, direction dirright. Then from pos43 to pos53 is dirright. But pos53 is not a goal. Alternatively, push to pos43.

Wait, after step 11, stone is at pos33. Agent is at pos23. Then, agent moves to pos33 (step 12). Now, agent is at pos33. Then, push stone from pos33 to pos43 (dirright). So step 13: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos43 dirright. Wait, but the stone is at pos33. The agent is at pos33. To push the stone, the agent must be adjacent to the stone's current position. So to push from pos33 to pos43 (dirright), the agent must be at pos33's left (pos23) or west, but the agent is at pos33. So agent needs to be at pos33 to push east? No. The direction from agent's location to the stone's location must be dirright. So agent must be west of the stone. If the stone is at pos33, agent must be at pos23 (west) to push east. But after step 11, agent is at pos23, then moves to pos33. Then, can't push from pos33 to pos43 because agent is at pos33, stone is at pos33? No, the stone is at pos33 after step 11. Wait, no. After step 11, the stone is at pos33, and the agent is at pos23.

Step 12: move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright. Now, agent is at pos33, which is occupied by the stone? But pos33 is not clear (stone is there). So this move is invalid. Oh no, this is a mistake. Because after step 11, the stone is at pos33, making pos33 not clear. So the agent cannot move there. Therefore, the previous plan is invalid.

So after step 11 (pushtonongoal from pos23 to pos33), the agent is at pos23 (from the action's effect). Then, the agent needs to move to pos33, but pos33 is occupied by the stone. So that's not possible. Therefore, the agent cannot move to pos33 after pushing the stone there. Hence, the plan is incorrect.

This highlights a mistake in the earlier reasoning. After pushing the stone to pos33, the agent is at pos23. To push the stone further to pos43, the agent needs to be at pos33's west (pos23) and push east. But the stone is already at pos33. So the agent can perform pushtonongoal from pos23 to pos33 to pos43, but wait:

Wait, the stone is at pos33. To push it to pos43 (dirright), the agent must be at pos33's west (pos23), direction dirright to pos33. Then, from pos33, dirright to pos43. So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright. Preconditions:

- agent at pos23 (yes)
- stone at pos33 (yes)
- pos43 is clear (yes)
- direction from pos23 to pos33 is dirright (yes)
- direction from pos33 to pos43 is dirright (yes)
- pos43 is not a goal (yes)

So this action is valid. After this, stone is at pos43, agent is at pos33.

Now, agent is at pos33. Then, agent can move to pos34 (dirdown), then to pos44 (dirright). Then push the stone from pos43 to pos42.

So revised steps:

1. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup
2. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
3. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
4. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright
5. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
6. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
7. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
8. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft
9. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft
10. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirright
12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright
13. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
14. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
15. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup
16. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
17. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
18. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
19. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
20. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirdown
21. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirleft

But this plan is very long. Need to check if it's optimal.

Alternatively, after step 15, the agent is at pos43. Then:

16. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft (satisfies pos33 not clear)
17. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
18. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
19. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright (satisfies pos54 not clear)
20. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirdown (pos54 is clear again, but we needed it to be not clear at least once, which step 19 does)
21. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirleft (satisfies pos52 not clear, which helps with constraint 9)

But this adds many steps, making the plan longer. However, the problem requires an optimal plan, i.e., the shortest possible. So need to find a way to satisfy all constraints with minimal steps.

Alternative approach: Find a path that satisfies all constraints without unnecessary steps.

Let's try to think of a different path.

Starting fresh:

Agent at pos35.

Goal: move stone1 from pos23 to pos42.

Constraints:

- Must visit pos13 at least once, and after that, pos34 must be not clear.

- pos32 must be not clear at least once, and if so, agent must reach pos41 eventually.

- pos42 must be not clear (done when stone is there), and after that, pos33 must be not clear.

- pos54 must be not clear at least once.

- Either pos54 or pos52 must be not clear at least once.

Alternative idea: Push the stone directly from pos23 to pos33, then to pos43, then to pos42. Along the way, ensure the agent passes through pos32 and pos13, and visits pos54.

But how?

Let's outline the steps:

1. Agent moves from pos35 to pos34 (dirup)
2. pos34 → pos33 (dirup)
3. pos33 → pos32 (dirup)
   - Now, pos32 is not clear (constraint 3 satisfied)
4. pos32 → pos42 (dirright) to satisfy constraint 4 by moving to pos41 later
5. pos42 → pos41 (dirup)
   - Now, agent at pos41, satisfying the implication for pos32
6. pos41 → pos42 (dirdown)
7. pos42 → pos32 (dirleft)
8. pos32 → pos22 (dirleft)
9. pos22 → pos12 (dirleft)
10. pos12 → pos13 (dirdown)
    - Agent at pos13 (constraint 7)
11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirright
    - Stone at pos33, agent at pos23
12. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright (invalid, pos33 has stone)
    - So instead, after step 11, agent is at pos23. Need to push again.
13. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright
    - Stone at pos43, agent at pos33
14. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
15. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
16. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup
    - Stone at pos42, agent at pos43
17. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft (to make pos33 not clear, satisfying constraint 6)
18. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
19. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
20. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright (satisfy constraint 8 and 9)
21. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirdown
22. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirleft (satisfy constraint 9)

This plan has 22 steps, which is probably not optimal.

But perhaps there's a shorter path. Let's think again.

Alternative path:

After pushing the stone to pos42 (step 16), the agent is at pos43. Then, instead of moving to pos33, the agent can move to pos54 directly.

16. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup
17. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirright (no, pos44 is clear?)
Wait, after step 16, agent is at pos43. From pos43, can move to pos44 via dirdown.

17. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
18. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
19. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirdown
20. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirleft

This would cover pos54 and pos52, satisfying constraints 8 and 9.

Also, after pushing to pos42, the agent moves to pos43, then to pos44 and pos54. This makes pos54 not clear.

Now, check constraint 6: after pos42 is not clear (stone there), pos33 must be not clear. In this plan, pos33 is not clear when the agent was there during step 3 (pos32 → pos22), but after that, agent leaves pos33. So pos33 is clear after that. Therefore, constraint 6 is not satisfied.

So need to ensure that after pos42 is not clear, pos33 is not clear. So after step 16, the agent must move to pos33.

16. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup
17. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
    - Now, pos33 is not clear (agent there)
    - Satisfies constraint 6
18. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
19. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
20. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
21. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirdown
22. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirleft

This way, after pos42 is not clear (step 16), agent moves to pos33 (step 17), making pos33 not clear.

Now, all constraints are satisfied.

But how many steps is this? Let's count:

1. move pos35 to pos34
2. move pos34 to pos33
3. move pos33 to pos32
4. move pos32 to pos42
5. move pos42 to pos41
6. move pos41 to pos42
7. move pos42 to pos32
8. move pos32 to pos22
9. move pos22 to pos12
10. move pos12 to pos13
11. pushtonongoal to pos33
12. pushtonongoal to pos43
13. move pos33 to pos34
14. move pos34 to pos44
15. pushtogoal to pos42
16. move pos43 to pos33
17. move pos33 to pos34
18. move pos34 to pos44
19. move pos44 to pos54
20. move pos54 to pos53
21. move pos53 to pos52

That's 21 steps. Still too long. This suggests that the initial approach is not optimal.

Alternative idea: Find a path where the agent's visit to pos13 is combined with other constraints.

For example, after moving to pos13 and pushing the stone, the agent must ensure that pos34 is not clear. The agent can move to pos34 after pos13.

But after pushing the stone to pos33, the agent is at pos23. To get to pos34:

pos23 → pos24 (dirdown) → pos34 (dirright). But pos24 is not clear if the stone is there. Alternatively, if the stone is at pos33, pos23 is clear. So agent can move from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown) if pos24 is clear. But initially, pos24 is clear. So:

After step 11 (pushtonongoal to pos33), agent is at pos23.

12. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown (pos24 now not clear)
13. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright (pos34 now not clear)
    - This satisfies the constraint that after being at pos13, pos34 is not clear.

Now, pos34 is not clear, which satisfies constraint 7's implication.

But then, the agent is at pos34. From there, can push the stone to pos43.

But the stone is at pos33. To push to pos43, agent needs to be at pos33's west (pos23) or east (pos43). But the agent is at pos34. So can't push directly.

Alternative, agent moves from pos34 to pos33 (dirup). But pos33 has the stone. So can't move there.

So this approach may not work.

Another idea: After pushing the stone to pos33, the agent is at pos23. Then, move to pos24, then to pos34, making pos34 not clear (satisfying the constraint). Then, move to pos44, and push the stone from pos33 to pos43.

But how? The stone is at pos33. To push from pos33 to pos43, agent must be at pos23 (west) or pos43 (east). If the agent is at pos34, can't push.

So this suggests that the initial plan must include the agent moving back to pos23 after pos34.

But this is getting too complicated. Perhaps the optimal plan requires fewer steps by combining constraint satisfaction.

Let me try to outline a shorter plan:

1. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup
2. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
3. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
   - pos32 not clear (constraint 3)
4. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright
   - pos42 not clear (constraint 5)
5. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
   - satisfies constraint 4 (after pos32 not clear, agent is at pos41)
6. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
7. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
8. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft
9. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft
10. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
    - agent at pos13 (constraint 7)
11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirright
    - stone at pos33, agent at pos23
12. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
    - pos24 not clear (must be at most one continuous sequence)
13. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
    - pos34 not clear (satisfies constraint 7's implication)
14. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
15. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup
    - stone at pos42, agent at pos43
16. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
    - pos33 not clear (satisfies constraint 6)
17. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
18. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
19. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
    - pos54 not clear (constraint 8)
20. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirdown
21. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirleft
    - satisfies constraint 9

Now, check constraints:

- pos24 not clear in steps 12-13: continuous sequence of two steps. So it's one continuous sequence (allowed).

- pos25 not clear: never occupied.

- pos32 not clear in steps 3-4, then again in step7. But constraint 1 allows at most one continuous sequence. However, pos32 is cleared in step4 (agent moves to pos42) and then re-occupied in step7. So that's two separate sequences, which violates the constraint. Oh no, constraint 1 says pos24 and pos25 can have at most one continuous sequence. Constraint 1 is for pos24, constraint 2 for pos25. So pos32's handling is okay. The constraints for pos24 and pos25 are separate.

Wait, the constraints are:

1. "The following expression must hold in at most one continuous sequence of states: Location pos24 is not clear"

So pos24 can be not clear in one continuous period, not multiple. In the current plan, pos24 is not clear in steps 12-13 (agent is there), then cleared when agent leaves. That's one continuous sequence, which is allowed.

Similarly for pos25: never not clear.

Constraint 3: pos32 not clear in steps 3 and 7. Each time the agent is there, it's a separate sequence. But the constraint requires that pos32 is not clear in at least one state. Since it's not clear in steps 3 and 7, it satisfies the "at least once" part. The constraints about pos32's implications are handled by step5 (agent moves to pos41).

Constraint 6: after pos42 is not clear (step15), pos33 is not clear in step16.

Constraint 8: pos54 not clear in step19.

Constraint 9: pos54 or pos52 not clear in steps19 and 21.

Thus, this plan satisfies all constraints. But the number of steps is 21, which may not be optimal.

But maybe there's a shorter way. Let's try to optimize steps.

Alternative plan:

1. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup
2. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
3. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
   - pos32 not clear
4. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright
   - pos42 not clear
5. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
   - satisfies constraint 4
6. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
7. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
8. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft
9. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft
10. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
    - pos13 visited
11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirright
    - stone at pos33, agent at pos23
12. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
    - pos24 not clear
13. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
    - pos34 not clear
14. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
15. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup
    - stone at pos42
16. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
    - pos33 not clear
17. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
18. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
19. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
    - pos54 not clear
20. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirdown
21. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirleft
    - pos52 not clear

This is still 21 steps. But perhaps some steps can be merged or avoided.

For example, after step 16, the agent is at pos33. Then, moving to pos34 and pos44 again may not be necessary. Instead, after step 16, go directly to pos54:

16. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
17. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
18. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
    - pos54 not clear
19. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirdown
20. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirleft

This reduces steps from 21 to 20.

But how to further optimize?

Alternatively, after step 15 (stone at pos42), the agent is at pos43. Instead of moving to pos33, maybe directly go to pos54:

15. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup
16. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
17. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
18. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirdown
19. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirleft
    - satisfies pos54 and pos52 not clear

But this skips making pos33 not clear after pos42 is not clear. So constraint 6 is violated.

Thus, this plan would not satisfy constraint 6.

Therefore, we must include a step where after pos42 is not clear, pos33 is not clear.

So after step 15, agent must go to pos33.

But how?

After step 15, agent is at pos43.

16. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
    - makes pos33 not clear
17. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
18. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
19. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
20. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirdown
21. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirleft

This gives 21 steps. Is there a shorter path?

Let me think differently. Can the agent visit pos13 earlier, thereby allowing the agent to move to pos34 and satisfy the constraint in fewer steps?

Alternative plan:

1. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup
2. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
3. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
   - pos32 not clear
4. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft
5. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft
6. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
   - agent at pos13
7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirright
   - stone at pos33, agent at pos23
8. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
   - pos24 not clear (one continuous sequence)
9. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
   - pos34 not clear (satisfies constraint after pos13)
10. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
11. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup
    - stone at pos42, agent at pos43
12. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
    - pos33 not clear (satisfies constraint 6)
13. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
14. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright
15. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
    - satisfies constraint 4 (pos32 was occupied in step3 and step13, so need to reach pos41 after each occurrence)
16. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
17. move player1 pos42 pos52 dirright
    - pos52 not clear (satisfies constraint 9)
18. move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
19. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
    - pos54 not clear (satisfies constraint 8 and 9)

But this plan may have overlaps and possibly missing steps.

Another angle: The constraints require that pos32 is not clear at least once, and when it is, agent must reach pos41. So agent must go to pos41 after being at pos32. Also, after pos13, agent must make pos34 not clear. And after pos42 is not clear, pos33 must be not clear. 

Let me try to find the minimal steps:

1. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup
2. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
3. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup (pos32 not clear)
4. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright (pos42 not clear)
5. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup (satisfies constraint 4)
6. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
7. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
8. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft
9. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft
10. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown (pos13 visited)
11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirright (stone at pos33, agent at pos23)
12. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown (pos24 not clear)
13. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright (pos34 not clear)
14. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
15. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup (stone at pos42, agent at pos43)
16. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft (pos33 not clear)
17. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
18. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
19. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright (pos54 not clear)
20. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirdown
21. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirleft (pos52 not clear)

This plan still has 21 steps. It's possible that this is the minimal plan given the constraints, but I'm not sure. However, the problem requires an optimal plan. Perhaps there's a way to combine some steps.

For example, after step 15, the agent is at pos43. Instead of moving to pos33, maybe go directly to pos54:

15. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup
16. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
17. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright (pos54 not clear)
18. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirdown
19. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirleft (pos52 not clear)

But this skips step 16 (moving to pos33), which violates constraint 6. So this is not acceptable.

Another idea: After step 15, the agent is at pos43. If the agent moves to pos33, making it not clear, then to pos34, pos44, and pos54, this satisfies the constraints. But it requires those steps.

Given the complexity of the constraints, it's likely that the minimal plan requires around 20 steps. However, considering the problem's initial state and the required constraints, the following plan satisfies all constraints with the minimal number of steps possible:
