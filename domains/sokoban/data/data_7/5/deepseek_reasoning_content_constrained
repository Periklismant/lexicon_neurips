Okay, so I need to figure out a plan to move stone1 to a goal location while satisfying all the constraints. Let's start by understanding the problem.

First, the initial state: The agent (player1) is at pos42. Stone1 is at pos23. The only goal location is pos51. All other positions except pos51 are non-goal. The constraints are a bit tricky, so I need to keep them in mind.

The main goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. The only goal location is pos51. So stone1 must end up at pos51.

Now, the available actions are move, pushtogoal, and pushtonongoal. Since pos51 is a goal, we'll need to push the stone there using pushtogoal. But first, the agent has to navigate to a position where they can push the stone towards pos51.

Let's look at the movement possibilities. The grid is 5x5, from pos11 to pos55. The movement directions are up, down, left, right. The connections between positions are given, so I need to figure out the path.

The initial position of the agent is pos42. Stone1 is at pos23. So the agent needs to get to a position adjacent to the stone to push it. Since the stone is at pos23, the agent could approach from pos22, pos24, pos13, or pos33. But looking at the connections:

From pos23, you can go to pos13 (left), pos33 (right), pos22 (up), or pos24 (down). So the agent needs to reach one of those adjacent positions to push the stone.

But there's a constraint: "Location pos23 is clear" must hold in every state. Wait, the initial state says "Location pos23 is clear", but the stone is at pos23. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, the original state says "stone1 is at location pos23" and "Location pos23 is clear". Wait, how can a location be clear if there's a stone there? Maybe "clear" means that there's no agent or other stones? Or perhaps there's a mistake. Hmm. Wait, according to the problem statement, each position may contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. So if a stone is there, it's not clear. But in the original state, "Location pos23 is clear" is listed, but stone1 is there. That must be a mistake. Wait, let me check again.

Original state:

"stone1 is at location pos23"

"Location pos23 is clear"

Wait, that's contradictory. Unless "clear" refers to the agent not being there. Because the stone is there, but maybe "clear" means the agent is not present. Wait, looking at the action preconditions: for example, "move" requires that the destination is clear. The effects of move say that after moving, the agent leaves the from location and occupies the to location. So "clear" probably means that the agent is not present, but stones can be there. Wait, but the preconditions for move say that location l_to is clear. So if a stone is at l_to, can the agent move there? Because "clear" in that context would mean no agent is there, but stones are okay. Wait, the problem statement says "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So a location is clear if it's empty (no agent, no stone). Because if it's clear, then you can move there. So, if a location has a stone, it's not clear, so the agent can't move there. So the original state says "Location pos23 is clear", but stone1 is there. That must be an error. Or perhaps "clear" refers to the agent's presence. Wait, maybe "clear" means that the agent is not present. Because stones can be present, but the agent can't move into a location with a stone. But the problem statement isn't explicit. Let me check the action preconditions again.

For the "move" action, the precondition is that the l_to is clear. So if l_to has a stone, the agent can't move there. Therefore, "clear" means that neither the agent nor a stone is present. Therefore, the original state has a contradiction: "stone1 is at pos23" and "Location pos23 is clear". That's impossible. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. Maybe in the original state, "Location pos23 is clear" is a typo. Let me check again the original state's listed facts.

Looking back:

The original state of the world includes:

"stone1 is at location pos23"

Then, under the clear locations, it lists:

"Location pos23 is clear"

Wait, that's conflicting. So either the problem statement is wrong, or I'm misunderstanding the meaning of "clear". Let me think again. Maybe "clear" refers to the agent not being there, regardless of stones. So a location can have a stone but still be considered clear for the agent's movement. But that would contradict the problem statement's action preconditions. For example, moving to a location that has a stone would require it to be clear, which would be impossible if the stone is there. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that a location is clear if it has neither the agent nor a stone. Therefore, the original state is inconsistent. But since the problem is given as such, maybe it's a typo. Let me check again the original state's "clear" locations.

Wait, the original state lists:

"Location pos23 is clear"

But the stone is at pos23. So that's impossible. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe "clear" refers only to the agent's presence, and stones don't affect it. But that's unlikely, given the problem's setup. Hmm. This is a problem. If the stone is at pos23, then pos23 is not clear. So the original state's statement that pos23 is clear must be incorrect. But the problem states that in the original state, "Location pos23 is clear" and "stone1 is at location pos23". That's a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the stone is actually at a different location. Or maybe the "clear" status is a mistake. But since the user provided the problem, I have to work with it as given. Maybe the user intended that "clear" refers to the agent's absence, and stones are allowed. Let me proceed under that assumption. Otherwise, the problem is unsolvable. Alternatively, perhaps the stone is at pos23, but the initial state says pos23 is clear, which is impossible. So there's a mistake. But maybe the initial state's "Location pos23 is clear" is a mistake. Let me check again:

The original state includes:

"stone1 is at location pos23"

But also:

"Location pos23 is clear"

That can't be. Therefore, perhaps the initial state's "Location pos23 is clear" is a mistake. But since the user provided this, perhaps I should proceed assuming that despite the stone being there, pos23 is considered clear. But that's conflicting with the action preconditions. Alternatively, maybe the stone is not at pos23. Wait, the original state says "stone1 is at location pos23", but also "Location pos23 is clear". So that's a problem. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake. But since I have to work with the problem as given, perhaps the stone is actually not present in the initial state. But that contradicts the problem statement. Hmm. This is a problem. Alternatively, maybe "clear" is defined as the agent not being present. So if a location has a stone but not the agent, it's considered clear. But then the preconditions for move would allow moving to a location with a stone, which isn't allowed. Because moving to a location with a stone would require it to be clear (i.e., no agent there), but the stone's presence would block the agent. Hmm. I'm confused. Let's check the problem statement again.

The problem says:

Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty. Each position is flagged as either a goal position or a non-goal position.

So a position can be empty (clear), have the agent (not clear), or have a stone (not clear). Therefore, "clear" means empty. Therefore, the original state has an inconsistency. But since the user provided it, perhaps it's a mistake, and the stone is actually not at pos23, but elsewhere. Or maybe the "Location pos23 is clear" is a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended that the stone is at pos23, and the location is not clear, but the initial state incorrectly lists it as clear. In that case, the problem is impossible because the stone is blocking the location, but the initial state says it's clear. But since we have to proceed, maybe we should ignore that contradiction and proceed. Alternatively, perhaps "Location pos23 is clear" in the initial state is a typo. For example, maybe the stone is at pos24, but the initial state says pos23. Or perhaps "Location pos23 is clear" is incorrect. But given that the problem states it, perhaps I need to proceed despite the inconsistency.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's initial state is correct, and "clear" refers only to the agent's presence. So a location with a stone is considered clear as long as the agent is not there. But then, the agent could move into a location with a stone, which is not allowed. Because the preconditions for move require that the destination is clear. So if the destination has a stone, it's not clear, and the agent can't move there. Therefore, the initial state's "Location pos23 is clear" must be incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the correct initial state is that pos23 is not clear (since the stone is there). But the user's problem states otherwise. This is a major issue. But since the problem is given as such, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the stone is at pos23 and pos23 is not clear. Therefore, the initial state's "Location pos23 is clear" is a mistake, and I should ignore it. Because otherwise, the problem is impossible. So I'll proceed under the assumption that pos23 is not clear (due to the stone being there) despite the initial state's claim.

Wait, the problem statement says:

"Original state of the world is the following: ... "stone1 is at location pos23" ... "Location pos23 is clear" ..."

So the user provided conflicting information. Therefore, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem's setup. But given that the task is to get stone1 to a goal location (pos51), and the stone starts at pos23, which is not a goal location. So the agent needs to push the stone from pos23 to pos51. But pos51 is in the bottom right corner. Let's see the grid positions:

The grid is labeled from pos11 (top-left) to pos55 (bottom-right). So pos51 is the bottom-left of the fifth row. Wait, pos51 is (5,1) assuming the first digit is row and the second column. So rows go from 1 to 5, columns 1 to 5. So pos51 is row 5, column 1. The stone is at pos23 (row 2, column3). The agent starts at pos42 (row4, column2).

So the agent needs to move to a position adjacent to pos23 to push the stone. Let's see possible paths. The stone is at pos23. The agent needs to get to pos22, pos24, pos13, or pos33 to push it. But considering the movement connections:

Looking at the movement possibilities from pos42 (agent's initial position):

pos42 can move to pos32 (left), pos52 (right), pos41 (up), or pos43 (down). 

To get to pos23, the agent needs to navigate through the grid. Let's plan a path from pos42 to pos23. Let's see:

From pos42, possible moves:

- pos42 to pos32 (dirleft): possible.
- pos32 can move to pos22 (dirleft), pos42 (dirright), pos31 (dirup), pos33 (dirdown).
So from pos42, moving left to pos32, then left to pos22. Then from pos22, down to pos23? Wait, but the stone is at pos23. So once the agent is at pos22, can they push the stone down to pos24 (since pushing down from pos23 would go to pos24). But the stone is at pos23. Let's think.

Wait, if the agent is at pos22, they can push the stone from pos23 to pos24 if they are at pos22 and the stone is at pos23. Wait, no. Because to push a stone, the agent has to be adjacent to it. So to push the stone at pos23, the agent needs to be at pos22 (to the left), pos24 (to the right), pos13 (up), or pos33 (down). Wait, the directions are a bit confusing. For example, to push the stone from pos23 to pos24, the agent would have to be at pos23's up direction, which is pos22. Wait, no. The direction is part of the action. Let me check the movement directions.

The direction in the action refers to the direction from the agent's position to the stone's position. For example, if the agent is at pos22 and the stone is at pos23, the direction from pos22 to pos23 is dirdown. Because pos22 to pos23 is down. Wait, let me check the movement connections:

From pos22, you can move to pos12 (dirleft), pos32 (dirright), pos21 (dirup), or pos23 (dirdown). So the direction from pos22 to pos23 is dirdown. So if the agent is at pos22 and wants to push the stone at pos23 in the dirdown direction, that would move the stone to pos24. Because from pos23, moving dirdown goes to pos24.

So the action would be "pushtonongoal" (since pos24 is not a goal) if we push it to pos24. But we need to push it towards pos51 eventually. So maybe push the stone right (dirright) from pos23 to pos33. To do that, the agent needs to be at pos23's left (pos22) and push right? Wait, no. Wait, the agent has to be adjacent to the stone in the direction they want to push. For example, to push the stone to the right (dirright), the agent must be on the left side of the stone. Because the direction in the action is from the agent's position to the stone's position. So if the agent is at pos22 (left of pos23), and the stone is at pos23, then the direction from agent to stone is dirdown (since pos23 is down from pos22). To push the stone to pos24 (down from pos23), the direction would be dirdown. So the agent at pos22 can push the stone down to pos24.

Alternatively, the agent could move to pos24 and push the stone up to pos23, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, moving to pos33 (right of pos23) and pushing left. So agent at pos33 can push the stone left to pos23's left direction, which would be pos22. But that's moving the stone left.

But the goal is to get the stone to pos51, which is in the bottom-left (row5, column1). So the stone is at pos23 (row2, column3). To reach pos51, the stone needs to move left and down. So pushing the stone left to pos22, then down to pos32, etc., but wait, that's not possible. Wait, pos51 is row5, column1, so the stone needs to move down to row5 and left to column1. Let me think about possible paths.

Alternatively, perhaps the stone can be pushed down to pos33, then right to pos43, etc. But pos51 is in column1. So perhaps the best path is to move the stone left to pos22, then down to pos32, left to pos31, then down to pos41, then left to pos51. Because pos51 is a goal location. Let's check the movement connections.

From pos23, pushing left (dirleft) would require the agent to be at pos23's right (pos24) and direction dirleft. Wait, no. The direction in the action is from the agent's position to the stone's position. So if the agent is at pos22 (which is up from pos23), the direction from agent to stone is dirdown. To push the stone left (dirleft) from pos23, the agent would need to be on the right side of the stone (pos24) and push it left. But pos24 is down from pos23. So the direction from pos24 to pos23 is dirup. So to push the stone left from pos23 to pos22, the agent would have to be at pos22, direction dirdown (from agent to stone), and then the stone moves left. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with directions. Let's clarify.

Each movement direction is defined as the direction from the current location to the next. For example, moving from pos22 to pos23 is dirdown. So the direction dirdown allows moving from pos22 to pos23.

So, to push the stone from pos23 to pos22 (up), the agent needs to be at pos23's down direction (pos24) and push up. Wait, no. Because pushing requires the agent to be adjacent in the direction of the push. For example, to push the stone up, the agent must be below the stone. Wait, perhaps the direction in the action refers to the direction the agent is moving to push the stone. For example, if the agent is at pos24 (down from pos23) and pushes the stone up (dirup) from pos23 to pos22, but that's not possible because pos22 is up from pos23. Alternatively, the direction is the direction from the agent's position to the stone's position. So if the agent is at pos22 (up from pos23), direction dirdown (from agent to stone), then pushing the stone further down to pos24.

Alternatively, perhaps the direction in the action is the direction from the stone's position to the target location. For example, to push the stone from pos23 to pos24 (down), the direction is dirdown, so the agent must be at pos22 (up) and then move down to pos23, pushing the stone down to pos24. Wait, but the preconditions for pushtonongoal require that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to the stone's location l_from in direction d. So for example, to push the stone from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown), the agent must be at l_p (pos22), and from pos22 to pos23 is dirdown. Then from pos23 to pos24 is also dirdown. So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown. Because pos24 is a non-goal location.

But the goal is to get the stone to pos51. So after pushing to pos24, the agent needs to push it further. But how?

Alternatively, maybe a better path is to push the stone right to pos33, then down to pos43, then left to pos42, etc. But pos51 is at column1, so the stone needs to move left. Let's think of a possible path from pos23 to pos51:

pos23 → pos22 (left) → pos32 (down) → pos31 (left) → pos41 (down) → pos51 (left). But pos51 is a goal location. So each step requires the agent to be in the correct position to push.

Let's check if that path is possible.

1. Push from pos23 to pos22 (left): Agent needs to be at pos23's right (pos24) and push left. Wait, no. To push left, the agent must be on the right side of the stone. So agent at pos24 (down from pos23) can push left to pos23's left (pos22)? No. Wait, the direction from the agent's position to the stone's position must be d. So if the agent is at pos24 (down from pos23), the direction from pos24 to pos23 is dirup. So to push the stone from pos23 to pos22 (left), the agent needs to be at pos23's left (pos22) and push left. Wait, no. If the stone is at pos23, and the agent is at pos22 (up from pos23), then the direction from agent to stone is dirdown. To push the stone left (to pos22?), that's not possible. Because pos22 is up from pos23, not left. Wait, pos23's left is pos13. Wait, no. Let me check the movement directions again.

Looking at the movement connections:

From pos23, you can move to pos13 (dirleft), pos33 (dirright), pos22 (dirup), or pos24 (dirdown).

So pos23's left is pos13 (column2 to column3?), wait, maybe the columns are numbered left to right. Wait, pos11 is (1,1), pos12 is (1,2), ..., pos15 is (1,5). So pos23 is row 2, column 3. Left would be column 2, so pos22. Wait, no. Wait, left would decrease the column number. So pos23's left is pos22 (row2, column2). Because moving left from pos23 to pos13 would be dirleft? Wait, no. Let's check the movement connections provided:

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirleft"

So moving from pos23 to pos13 is dirleft. So dirleft from pos23 is pos13 (column3 → column2? Wait, no. pos13 is row1, column3. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, maybe the movement directions are not aligned with left/right as column-wise. Let me list some movement connections to clarify.

Looking at the movement connections:

For example:

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirleft"

So from pos23, moving dirleft leads to pos13. pos23 is row2, column3. pos13 is row1, column3. So dirleft from pos23 is up. Wait, that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the directions are named differently. For example, dirleft might correspond to moving left in terms of columns, but the actual movement might be in a different direction. Wait, this is a problem. Let's check some other connections.

From pos22:

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft"

pos22 is row2, column2. pos12 is row1, column2. So moving dirleft from pos22 to pos12 would be up, not left. So dirleft in this case corresponds to moving up. That's unexpected. So the directions might be named based on the grid's perspective. For example, dirleft might mean moving north, dirright south, dirup west, dirdown east? Or perhaps the directions are mapped differently. This is critical to understand.

Looking at the movement connections, let's see:

From pos11:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"

pos11 is row1, column1. pos21 is row2, column1. So moving dirright from pos11 leads down to pos21. So dirright corresponds to moving down (south).

Another example:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

pos11 to pos12 is column1 to column2, same row. So dirdown corresponds to moving right (east).

Wait, that's strange. So:

- dirright: down (south)
- dirdown: right (east)
- dirleft: up (north)
- dirup: left (west)

This seems to be the case. Because from pos11 to pos21 (down) is dirright. From pos11 to pos12 (right) is dirdown. This is a bit counterintuitive. So the directions are named as follows:

- dirright: south (down)
- dirleft: north (up)
- dirdown: east (right)
- dirup: west (left)

This is a possible mapping. So when an action uses direction dirdown, it means moving east (right), and dirright means moving south (down). Therefore, when the agent is at pos22 and wants to push a stone at pos23 (which is to the east of pos22), the direction from pos22 to pos23 is dirdown (east). Wait, no. Because from pos22 to pos23 is east, but according to the movement connections, moving from pos22 to pos23 is dirdown. Wait, pos22 to pos23 is dirdown. So pos22 is row2, column2. pos23 is row2, column3. So moving east (right) would be dirdown. So the directions are named such that:

- dirright: south (row increases)
- dirleft: north (row decreases)
- dirdown: east (column increases)
- dirup: west (column decreases)

This seems to be the case. So for example, moving east (right) is dirdown, moving west (left) is dirup. Moving south (down) is dirright, moving north (up) is dirleft. This is a bit confusing, but it's how the directions are defined in the problem.

Given this, let's reorient. The directions are:

- dirright: south (row increases by 1)
- dirleft: north (row decreases by 1)
- dirdown: east (column increases by 1)
- dirup: west (column decreases by 1)

So, for example, moving from pos22 (row2, column2) to pos23 (row2, column3) is dirdown (east). Moving from pos22 to pos12 (row1, column2) is dirleft (north). Moving from pos22 to pos32 (row3, column2) is dirright (south). Moving from pos22 to pos21 (row2, column1) is dirup (west).

This mapping is crucial to understanding the movement.

Now, back to the problem. The stone is at pos23 (row2, column3). The goal is to push it to pos51 (row5, column1), which is a goal location. The agent starts at pos42 (row4, column2).

So the agent needs to navigate to the stone and push it towards pos51. Let's plan the path.

First, the agent needs to move to a position adjacent to the stone. Let's consider possible paths.

From pos42 (row4, column2), the agent can move:

- dirleft (north) to pos32 (row3, column2)
- dirright (south) to pos52 (row5, column2)
- dirup (west) to pos41 (row4, column1)
- dirdown (east) to pos43 (row4, column3)

But to reach pos23 (row2, column3), the agent needs to move north and then west, or some other path.

Let's plan a path from pos42 to pos23. Given the movement directions, let's see:

Option 1: pos42 → pos32 (dirleft/north) → pos22 (dirleft/north) → pos23 (dirdown/east). Wait, but pos23 is the stone's location. The agent can't move into the stone's location because it's not clear. So the agent can't move directly to pos23. Instead, the agent needs to reach a position adjacent to pos23 to push it.

Wait, the agent can't move into a location with a stone. So to push the stone, the agent must be in a position adjacent to the stone, then push it in a direction.

So, for example, the agent can move to pos22 (row2, column2), which is north of pos23. From pos22, the agent can push the stone east (dirdown) to pos24 (row2, column4). But pos24 is a non-goal location. Alternatively, push the stone south (dirright) to pos33 (row3, column3). But pos33 is not a goal. Alternatively, push the stone west (dirup) to pos22's west, but that's not possible. Wait, from pos22, pushing the stone east (dirdown) to pos23's east (pos24). Wait, the stone is at pos23. To push it east (dirdown), the agent must be at pos23's west (pos22), and the direction from agent to stone is dirdown (east). Then, pushing the stone further east to pos24.

But pos24 is not a goal. So this might not help. Alternatively, the agent could push the stone north (dirleft) to pos13 (row1, column3), but that's moving away from the goal.

Alternatively, the agent could move to pos24 (row2, column4), but how? From pos42, getting to pos24 would require moving north multiple times and then east. Let's see:

pos42 → pos32 (dirleft/north) → pos22 (dirleft/north) → pos23 (dirdown/east) → but can't move there because of the stone. So maybe another path.

Alternatively, pos42 → pos43 (dirdown/east) → pos44 (dirdown/east again?) Wait, from pos43, movement options:

pos43 can move to pos33 (dirleft/north), pos53 (dirright/south), pos42 (dirup/west), or pos44 (dirdown/east).

Not sure. Let's think of a path from pos42 to pos33, which is south-east of pos23. From pos33, the agent can push the stone west (dirup) to pos23's west (pos22). Wait, no. From pos33, pushing the stone west (dirup) would require the agent to be east of the stone. Wait, the stone is at pos23. pos33 is south-east of pos23. So the direction from pos33 to pos23 is dirleft (north) and dirup (west). Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's use the movement connections.

From pos33, the possible moves are:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"

So dirleft from pos33 is north to pos23. So if the agent is at pos33, they can move dirleft (north) to pos23, but that's where the stone is. So to push the stone from pos23, the agent needs to be at a position adjacent to pos23.

Alternatively, the agent could move to pos24 (row2, column4) and push the stone west (dirup) to pos23's west (pos22). Wait, but pos24 is east of pos23. So from pos24, the agent can push west (dirup) to pos23's west, which is pos22. But the stone is already at pos23. Wait, no. To push the stone from pos23 to pos22 (west), the agent needs to be at pos24 (east of pos23) and push west (dirup). But that would require the stone to be at pos23, and the agent at pos24. Then the action would be pushtonongoal, moving the stone from pos23 to pos22, which is west. But pos24 is east of pos23. So the direction from pos24 to pos23 is dirup (west). Then, pushing from pos23 to pos22 would require direction dirup (west). So the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirup

But pos24 must be adjacent to pos23 in direction dirup (west). Wait, no. The precondition for pushtonongoal is that the agent is at l_p, which must be adjacent to l_from (pos23) in direction d. So d is the direction from l_p to l_from. So if the agent is at pos24, and the stone is at pos23, the direction from pos24 to pos23 is dirup (west). So the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirup

But pos22 is west of pos23. So pushing from pos23 to pos22 (west) requires the agent to be east of pos23 (pos24) and direction dirup (west). So this action would move the stone from pos23 to pos22, which is a non-goal location.

But how does the agent get to pos24? Let's see the path from pos42 to pos24.

pos42 → pos32 (dirleft/north) → pos22 (dirleft/north) → pos23 (can't move there) → ... Alternatively, pos42 → pos43 (dirdown/east) → pos44 (dirdown/east) → pos54 (dirdown/east) → ... Not helpful. Or pos42 → pos32 → pos31 (dirup/west) → pos41 (dirleft/north) → pos51 (dirright/south). But this might not help.

Alternatively, pos42 → pos32 (dirleft/north) → pos22 (dirleft/north) → pos23 (can't move), but maybe push from pos22 to pos24.

Wait, the agent is at pos22. The stone is at pos23. The agent can push the stone dirdown (east) to pos24. Because from pos22 to pos23 is dirdown (east), and from pos23 to pos24 is dirdown (east). So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown.

After this, the stone is at pos24. Then, the agent needs to push it further east to pos25, but pos25 is not a goal. Alternatively, push it south to pos34. But pos34 is not a goal. Hmm. This seems not helpful.

Alternatively, from pos24, the agent could push the stone south (dirright) to pos34. But again, not helpful. The goal is pos51, which is row5, column1. So the stone needs to move down to row5 and left to column1.

Alternative plan: Push the stone left (west) from pos23 to pos22, then down to pos32, then left to pos31, then down to pos41, then left to pos51.

Let's see:

1. Push from pos23 to pos22: Agent at pos22, direction dirdown (east) to pos23, push to pos22 (west). Wait, no. Wait, the agent is at pos22, pushing the stone from pos23 to pos22. But pos22 is where the agent is. That can't be. Wait, no. When pushing, the agent moves into the stone's position, and the stone moves to the next location. Wait, the effects of pushtonongoal are: agent moves from l_p (pos22) to l_from (pos23), and the stone moves from l_from (pos23) to l_to (pos22). Wait, no. The action is "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d". The preconditions are: agent at l_p, stone at l_from, l_to is clear, can move from l_p to l_from via d, and from l_from to l_to via d, and l_to is non-goal.

So for example, pushing from pos23 to pos22:

l_p is pos22 (agent's initial position), l_from is pos23 (stone's initial position), l_to is pos22. But wait, pos22 is the agent's initial position. But the stone can't be pushed into pos22 if the agent is there. Because l_to must be clear. So this is not possible.

Ah, right! The l_to must be clear. So if the agent is at pos22 and wants to push the stone from pos23 to pos22, but pos22 is occupied by the agent, that's not possible. So that's invalid. Therefore, the agent can't push the stone into their own position.

Therefore, the correct way to push the stone from pos23 to pos22 would require the agent to be at a position that allows the stone to move to pos22, which must be clear. But initially, pos22 is clear. So the agent can be at pos24 (east of pos23) and push west (dirup) to pos22. Wait, but pos24 is east of pos23. So the agent is at pos24, and the direction from pos24 to pos23 is dirup (west). Then, pushing the stone from pos23 to pos22 (west) requires that pos22 is clear. Since initially pos22 is clear, this is possible.

So the steps would be:

1. Agent moves from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft/north).
2. Agent moves from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft/north).
3. Agent moves from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown/east) – but pos23 has the stone, so can't move there. So this path is invalid.

Alternative approach: Agent needs to get to pos24 to push the stone west to pos22.

How to get to pos24 from pos42:

pos42 → pos32 (dirleft/north) → pos22 (dirleft/north) → pos23 (can't move) → no. Alternatively:

pos42 → pos43 (dirdown/east) → pos44 (dirdown/east) → pos34 (dirleft/north) → pos24 (dirleft/north). Is this possible?

Let's check movement connections:

From pos42, moving dirdown (east) to pos43.

From pos43, moving dirdown (east) to pos44.

From pos44, moving dirleft (north) to pos34.

From pos34, moving dirleft (north) to pos24.

Yes. So the path is pos42 → pos43 → pos44 → pos34 → pos24.

Then, the agent is at pos24. Now, they can push the stone from pos23 to pos22 (west) with direction dirup (west). Because from pos24 to pos23 is dirup (west), and from pos23 to pos22 is dirup (west). So the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirup

After this, the stone is at pos22, and the agent is at pos23.

But wait, after pushing, the agent moves to pos23 (l_from), which is now clear because the stone moved to pos22. Wait, but the original stone was at pos23, and after pushing, the agent moves there. So pos23 becomes occupied by the agent, and the stone is at pos22.

But the constraint says "Location pos23 is clear" must hold in every state. So after this action, pos23 is occupied by the agent, making it not clear. This violates the constraint. Therefore, this action is invalid.

Ah! This is a critical point. The constraint requires that "Location pos23 is clear" in every state. So the agent can never be at pos23, and the stone can't be there either. But initially, the stone is at pos23, which already violates the constraint. Wait, no. The original state says "stone1 is at location pos23" and "Location pos23 is clear". That's a contradiction. So perhaps the problem has a mistake. But given that, we have to find a plan that ensures pos23 is always clear. But since the stone starts at pos23, which is not clear (since it has a stone), this is impossible. Therefore, there's a mistake in the problem statement. But assuming that the initial state is correct, and the constraint is that pos23 must always be clear (i.e., no agent or stone there), then the stone cannot be at pos23 initially. So the problem is impossible. But since the user provided it, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the constraint is that pos23 must be clear in every state except when the stone is there. But the problem states the constraint as "The following expression must hold in every state: 'Location pos23 is clear'". So if the stone is at pos23, then pos23 is not clear, violating the constraint. Therefore, the problem is impossible unless the stone is moved away from pos23 in the first action. But how? Because the stone starts at pos23, and the agent can't push it without being adjacent. But moving the stone requires that pos23 is clear, which it isn't initially. So the problem is contradictory.

This suggests that there's a mistake in the problem setup. However, since the user has provided this problem, I must assume that there's a way to solve it despite the apparent contradictions. Perhaps the initial state's "Location pos23 is clear" is incorrect, and the stone is actually not there. Or perhaps the constraint is different. But given the problem as stated, I need to proceed.

Assuming that the stone is at pos23, and the constraint requires pos23 to be clear in every state, the only way to satisfy this is to move the stone away from pos23 in the first action. But the agent is at pos42, which is far away. So the agent needs to reach a position adjacent to pos23 to push the stone, but during that time, pos23 must remain clear, which it isn't. Therefore, the problem is unsolvable. However, since the user is asking for a solution, there must be a way.

Alternatively, maybe the constraint is that pos23 must be clear except when the stone is there. But the constraint says "Location pos23 is clear" must hold in every state. So if the stone is at pos23, then pos23 is not clear, which violates the constraint. Therefore, the problem is impossible unless the stone is not at pos23 initially. But the problem states that it is. Therefore, there's a mistake. But since I have to provide a solution, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the constraint allows the stone to be at pos23 initially, but not after any action. So the first action must move the stone away from pos23.

But how? The agent needs to reach a position to push the stone. Let's think of the minimal steps.

The agent must move from pos42 to a position adjacent to pos23. The quickest path would be:

pos42 → pos32 (dirleft/north) → pos22 (dirleft/north). Then, from pos22, the agent can push the stone east (dirdown) to pos24. But this would require that pos24 is clear (which it is initially). So the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown

But after this action, the agent moves to pos23, making pos23 not clear, which violates the constraint. Therefore, this action is invalid.

Alternative approach: The agent pushes the stone from pos23 to a different location without entering pos23. But how? For example, the agent is at pos24 (east of pos23) and pushes the stone west to pos22. But to get to pos24, the agent has to move through several steps, during which pos23 remains occupied by the stone, violating the constraint.

This is a dead end. Given the constraints, it's impossible to solve the problem as stated. However, since the user expects a solution, perhaps there's an error in the problem's initial state or constraints. For the sake of providing an answer, I'll proceed under the assumption that the initial state's "Location pos23 is clear" is a mistake and that the stone is actually not there. But that's a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps the constraint is different. 

Alternatively, perhaps the constraint "Location pos23 is clear" is only required after the initial state. But the problem states "in every state", which includes the initial state. Therefore, the problem is impossible. But since the user expects a solution, I'll proceed with the assumption that the initial state's "Location pos23 is clear" is a mistake and the stone is not there. But this is speculative. Alternatively, perhaps the stone is at pos24, and the initial state is incorrect. But I'll proceed with the given information.

Assuming that the stone is at pos23 and we need to move it to pos51, and the constraint that pos23 must be clear in every state is ignored due to a mistake, let's proceed.

Agent's path:

1. Move from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft/north).
2. Move from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft/north).
3. Push the stone from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown/east) using pushtonongoal. This action requires the agent to be at pos22, stone at pos23, pos24 clear. After this, the agent is at pos23, but pos23 must be clear, which is violated. So invalid.

Alternative approach: Push the stone from pos23 to pos33 (east) using pushtonongoal. Agent needs to be at pos33's west (pos23's east), which is pos24. So:

1. Agent moves from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown/east).
2. From pos43 to pos44 (dirdown/east).
3. From pos44 to pos34 (dirleft/north).
4. From pos34 to pos24 (dirleft/north).
5. From pos24 to pos23 (dirup/west) → but pos23 has the stone, can't move there. Instead, from pos24, push the stone west to pos23's west (pos22). But again, the agent would end up at pos23, violating the constraint.

This is not working. Perhaps another path. Let's think of pushing the stone down (south) from pos23 to pos33. To do this, the agent needs to be at pos13 (north of pos23) and push south. But how to get to pos13?

Agent's path: pos42 → pos32 → pos22 → pos12 → pos13. Then push the stone south to pos23's south (pos33). But the stone is already at pos23. So this is not helpful.

Alternatively, the agent moves to pos33 (south-east of pos23) and pushes the stone west to pos23's west (pos22). But again, ending up at pos23.

This is not working. Given the time I've spent and the constraints, I think the correct approach is to push the stone east to pos33, then south to pos43, then west to pos42, etc., but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, considering the constraints:

Constraints:

1. "Location pos41 is not clear" in at least one state.
2. If pos41 is not clear, then earlier pos35 is not clear.
3. pos31 not clear in at most one continuous sequence.
4. player1 never at pos12.
5. At least one state where player1 is at pos25 or stone1 is at pos25.
6. pos23 is clear in every state.
7. player1 at pos22 in at most one continuous sequence.
8. pos24 not clear in at least one state.
9. If pos24 is not clear, then earlier pos44 is not clear.

Given these constraints, the plan must include:

- Some action that blocks pos41 (maybe the agent or stone is there).
- Before pos41 is blocked, pos35 must have been blocked.
- pos31 can be blocked only once consecutively.
- Agent never at pos12.
- Either agent at pos25 or stone at pos25 in some state.
- pos24 must be blocked at some point, and before that, pos44 was blocked.

This adds complexity. For example, the agent might need to move through pos35 to block it, then later block pos41. Also, stone1 must be at pos25 or the agent must be there at some point.

To satisfy the pos25 condition, perhaps pushing the stone to pos25 at some point.

But pos25 is a non-goal location, so the final push must be to pos51.

Let's try to outline a possible plan:

1. Agent moves to pos35, causing pos35 to be not clear (satisfying the constraint that pos35 is not clear before pos41 is blocked).

2. Agent moves to pos41, blocking it (satisfying the first constraint).

3. Push the stone to pos25 (satisfying the fifth constraint).

4. Ensure that pos44 is blocked before pos24 is blocked.

But how to integrate all this.

Alternatively, consider the following steps:

- Agent moves from pos42 to pos43 (east).
- Then to pos44 (east).
- Then to pos34 (north).
- Then to pos35 (east). Now, pos35 is not clear (agent there), satisfying the pos35 constraint.
- Then move to pos45 (south), then to pos44 (north), then to pos34 (north), etc. But this may not help.

Alternatively, after reaching pos35, the agent moves to pos41:

pos35 → pos45 (south) → pos44 (west) → pos43 (west) → pos42 (west) → pos41 (north). Then pos41 is blocked, satisfying the first constraint. But before that, pos35 was blocked.

Now, regarding the stone's path:

The stone needs to go from pos23 to pos51. Possible path: pos23 → pos24 → pos25 → pos35 → pos45 → pos44 → pos43 → pos42 → pos41 → pos51.

But each push requires the agent to be in the correct position.

For example:

1. Push stone from pos23 to pos24 (east). Agent at pos24's west (pos23), but can't be there. Alternatively, agent at pos24's east (pos25) and push west. No, the agent needs to be adjacent in the direction of the push.

This is getting too complicated. Given time constraints, I'll try to outline a possible plan:

1. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
2. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
3. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
4. move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown (now pos35 is not clear)
5. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirdown
6. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
7. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
8. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
9. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup (now pos41 is not clear, and pos35 was not clear earlier)
10. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
11. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft
12. move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown
13. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown (now pos24 is not clear, but need to ensure pos44 was not clear earlier. Wait, pos44 was blocked when agent was there at step 3, 6, 7. So pos44 was not clear in steps 3,4,6,7. So before pos24 is blocked (step13), pos44 was blocked in step3, which satisfies constraint 9.

After pushing stone to pos24, agent is at pos23, but constraint requires pos23 to be clear. So this is invalid.

This shows the difficulty. Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I think the optimal plan is:

```
move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown
move player1 pos35 pos45 dirdown
move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirup
move player1 pos22 pos23 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos21 dirup
... (continue pushing towards pos51)
```

But this likely violates the pos23 clear constraint. Therefore, I think the correct answer requires pushing the stone from pos23 to pos33 (east), then down to pos43, then left to pos42, etc., but ensuring all constraints are met. However, due to time constraints, I'll provide the following plan, acknowledging that it may not satisfy all constraints but is the best attempt under the given problem's contradictions:

```
move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown
move player1 pos24 pos34 dirdown
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos25 dirdown
move player1 pos25 pos35 dirdown
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos25 pos45 dirdown
move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos45 pos55 dirdown
move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos55 pos51 dirleft
```
