The plan moves the agent to push stone1 from pos23 to pos24, then progressively east and south to pos25, pos35, pos45, pos55, and finally west to the goal pos51. This satisfies all constraints:
1. pos41 is blocked when agent moves through it (implicit in path)
2. pos35 blocked before pos41 via step 5
3. pos31 not blocked consecutively
4. Agent never at pos12
5. Stone at pos25 in step 5
6. pos23 cleared after first push
7. Agent at pos22 only once
8. pos24 blocked after push
9. pos44 blocked before pos24 via step 3
