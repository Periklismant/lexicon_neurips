Alright, let's break down the problem:

1. We have a 2D grid with an agent (player1) and a stone (stone1).
2. The goal is to bring stone1 to a goal location. Looking at the initial state, only pos51 is marked as a goal location.
3. The agent can move around, and it can push the stone to a goal or non-goal location.
4. The stone is initially at pos23 and the agent is at pos42.

Now let's consider the given constraints:

1. Location pos41 must not be clear in at least one state.
2. If pos41 is not clear, there must be an earlier state where pos35 is not clear.
3. pos31 can be not clear in at most one continuous sequence of states.
4. player1 should never be at pos12.
5. Either player1 or stone1 must be at pos25 in at least one state.
6. pos23 should be clear in every state.
7. player1 can be at pos22 for at most one continuous sequence of states.
8. pos24 must not be clear in at least one state.
9. If pos24 is not clear, there must be an earlier state where pos44 is not clear.

Given the constraints and the initial state, we need to find a plan to move stone1 to pos51, which is the only goal location.

Let's start by visualizing the grid:

```
  1 2 3 4 5
1 . . . . .
2 . . S . .
3 . . . . .
4 . P . . .
5 G . . . .
```

Where:
- P is player1 at pos42
- S is stone1 at pos23
- G is the goal at pos51
- . represents clear locations

Now let's think about the path to move stone1 to pos51.

First, we need to get the player next to the stone to push it. The player is at pos42, and the stone is at pos23. 

One tricky part is that constraint 6 says that pos23 should always be clear. But initially, stone1 is at pos23. I think this constraint means that after the stone is moved from pos23, it should not be occupied by anything else.

Let's start by moving player1 to a position adjacent to stone1, so we can push it.

From pos42, we can move to pos32 (dirleft), which is adjacent to pos23 (dirdown). Then we can push the stone.

But we also need to satisfy the constraints. For constraints 1 and 2, we need to have pos35 not clear in an earlier state, and later pos41 not clear. For constraints 8 and 9, we need to have pos44 not clear and later pos24 not clear. 

Let's think about the path to move stone1 to pos51. We could move it right to pos24, then down to pos25, then left to pos35, then down to pos45, then left to pos55, and then up to pos51.

Actually, that's not a direct path and it might not satisfy all the constraints. Let's think of a different path.

From pos23, we could move it left to pos13, then down to pos14, then down to pos15, then right to pos25, then right to pos35, then right to pos45, then down to pos55, and then left to pos54, left to pos53, left to pos52, and finally left to pos51. But this is also quite circuitous.

Let's think about the constraints more carefully. 

For constraint 5, either player1 or stone1 must be at pos25 in at least one state. So we should try to move stone1 through pos25. That seems like a good idea.

For constraints 8 and 9, pos44 must be not clear before pos24 is not clear. One way to achieve this is to have the player pass through pos44 and then push the stone to pos24.

For constraints 1 and 2, pos35 must be not clear before pos41 is not clear. Again, one possibility is to have the player pass through pos35 and later through pos41.

Let's try to construct a path that satisfies these constraints.

What if we move the stone first to pos24, then to pos25, then to pos35, then to pos34, then to pos33, then to pos32, then to pos31, then to pos41, and finally to pos51? This would satisfy several of the constraints.

Actually, let's solve the problem in a more procedural way. We need to:
1. Move the player next to the stone so that we can push it.
2. Push the stone towards the goal (pos51) while satisfying the constraints.

Let's start by moving the player from pos42 to a position adjacent to the stone, which is at pos23. We can move left to pos32 and then try to push the stone.

From pos23, we need to move the stone to pos51. One direct path would be:
pos23 -> pos24 -> pos25 -> pos35 -> pos45 -> pos55 -> pos54 -> pos53 -> pos52 -> pos51

But this doesn't satisfy all the constraints. We need to ensure:
- Player1 or stone1 is at pos25 at some point.
- pos44 is not clear before pos24 is not clear.
- pos35 is not clear before pos41 is not clear.

Let's reconsider the path. We also need to ensure that pos31 is not clear in at most one continuous sequence of states, and player1 is at pos22 in at most one continuous sequence of states.

Since constraints 8 and 9 mandate that pos44 must be not clear before pos24 is not clear, and the only way for a pos to be not clear is if either player1 or stone1 is on it, we might need to move player1 to pos44 first, and then push the stone to pos24.

Similarly, for constraints 1 and 2, pos35 must be not clear before pos41, so we might need to move player1 to pos35 first, and then to pos41.

Actually, I realized that if I want to push the stone from pos23 to pos24, I need the player to be at pos22, which might conflict with constraint 7. I need to be more careful about that.

Let's create a step-by-step plan that ensures all constraints are met. We'll start from the initial state and trace through the movements.

Initial state:
- player1 is at pos42
- stone1 is at pos23

Let's move player1 to a position adjacent to stone1 so we can push it:

1. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft).
   New state: player1 at pos32, stone1 at pos23.

2. Move player1 from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft).
   New state: player1 at pos22, stone1 at pos23.
   Note: Player1 is now at pos22, which is a constraint we need to be careful about. We can be at pos22 in one continuous sequence, so we need to move away and not come back.

Now I'm adjacent to the stone and I can push it towards the direction I want. To satisfy the constraint that pos24 is not clear, let's push the stone to pos24.

3. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos24 using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown".
   New state: player1 at pos23, stone1 at pos24, pos22 is clear.
   Note: pos24 is now not clear, which satisfies constraint 8. However, constraint 9 states that pos44 must be not clear at an earlier state. This isn't satisfied yet. I'll need to adjust the plan.

Actually, let's rethink the plan to make sure all constraints are satisfied:

Constraint 1: "Location pos41 is not clear" in at least one state.
Constraint 2: If pos41 is not clear, then at an earlier state pos35 is not clear.
Constraint 3: pos31 is not clear in at most one continuous sequence.
Constraint 4: player1 is never at pos12.
Constraint 5: Either player1 or stone1 is at pos25 in at least one state.
Constraint 6: pos23 is always clear (after the stone is moved, I assume).
Constraint 7: player1 is at pos22 in at most one continuous sequence.
Constraint 8: pos24 is not clear in at least one state.
Constraint 9: If pos24 is not clear, then at an earlier state pos44 is not clear.

Given the constraints, we need to be careful about the order of movements. It seems like we need to:
1. First ensure pos44 is not clear.
2. Then make pos24 not clear.
3. Make sure pos35 is not clear.
4. Then ensure pos41 is not clear.
5. Finally, move the stone to the goal (pos51).

Let's restart the plan:

Initial state:
- player1 is at pos42
- stone1 is at pos23

First, let's move player1 to pos44 to satisfy the condition that pos44 is not clear at some point:

1. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown).
   New state: player1 at pos43, stone1 at pos23.

2. Move player1 from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown).
   New state: player1 at pos44, stone1 at pos23.
   Note: pos44 is now not clear, which will satisfy constraint 9 once pos24 is not clear.

Now, we need to move player1 to a position where it can push stone1 to pos24:

3. Move player1 from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft).
   New state: player1 at pos34, stone1 at pos23.

4. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33 (dirup).
   New state: player1 at pos33, stone1 at pos23.

5. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32 (dirup).
   New state: player1 at pos32, stone1 at pos23.

6. Move player1 from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft).
   New state: player1 at pos22, stone1 at pos23.
   Note: player1 is now at pos22, which we need to be aware of for constraint 7.

7. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos24 using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown".
   New state: player1 at pos23, stone1 at pos24, pos22 is clear.
   Note: pos24 is now not clear, which satisfies constraint 8.

Now, we need to move player1 to a position where it can push stone1 further. Since constraint 5 requires either player1 or stone1 to be at pos25, let's move stone1 to pos25:

8. Move player1 from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown).
   New state: player1 at pos24, stone1 is now at ... wait, this doesn't work because I can't be at pos24 if stone1 is already there.

Let me rethink our approach. If stone1 is at pos24, the player is at pos23, and we want to push stone1 to pos25, the player should stay at pos23 and push the stone down:

8. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos25 using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown".
   New state: player1 at pos24, stone1 at pos25.
   Note: stone1 is now at pos25, which satisfies constraint 5.

Now, we need to move player1 to a position where it can push stone1 further. A direct path to goal would be:
pos25 -> pos35 -> pos45 -> pos55 -> pos54 -> pos53 -> pos52 -> pos51

But, we also need to ensure that pos35 is not clear before pos41 is not clear. So, let's push the stone to pos35 first:

9. Move player1 from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown).
   New state: player1 at pos25, stone1 at pos25. Wait, this doesn't work because player1 can't move to a position that's already occupied.

Let me reconsider. If stone1 is at pos25 and player1 is at pos24, let's see where the player should move to push the stone further:

9. Push stone1 from pos25 to pos35 using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos25 pos35 dirright".
   New state: player1 at pos25, stone1 at pos35.
   Note: stone1 is now at pos35, which means pos35 is not clear, satisfying the first part of constraint 2.

Now, stone1 is at pos35 and player1 is at pos25. We need player1 to push stone1 further:

10. Push stone1 from pos35 to pos45 using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos35 pos45 dirright".
    New state: player1 at pos35, stone1 at pos45.

At this point, we've satisfied the constraint that pos35 is not clear. Now, we need to ensure pos41 is not clear at some point. Let's move player1 to pos41:

11. Move player1 from pos35 to pos34 (dirup).
    New state: player1 at pos34, stone1 at pos45.

12. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33 (dirup).
    New state: player1 at pos33, stone1 at pos45.

13. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32 (dirup).
    New state: player1 at pos32, stone1 at pos45.

14. Move player1 from pos32 to pos31 (dirup).
    New state: player1 at pos31, stone1 at pos45.
    Note: pos31 is now not clear, which we need to be aware of for constraint 3.

15. Move player1 from pos31 to pos41 (dirright).
    New state: player1 at pos41, stone1 at pos45.
    Note: pos41 is now not clear, which satisfies constraint 1.

Now, we need to move player1 to a position where it can push stone1 to the goal (pos51). We want to push stone1 from pos45 to the goal. The path would be:
pos45 -> pos55 -> pos54 -> pos53 -> pos52 -> pos51

Let's move player1 accordingly:

16. Move player1 from pos41 to pos42 (dirdown).
    New state: player1 at pos42, stone1 at pos45.

17. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown).
    New state: player1 at pos43, stone1 at pos45.

18. Move player1 from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown).
    New state: player1 at pos44, stone1 at pos45.

19. Move player1 from pos44 to pos45 (dirdown).
    New state: player1 at pos45, stone1 at pos45. Wait, this doesn't work because player1 can't move to a position that's already occupied.

I think I made an error. Let's step back. If stone1 is at pos45 and player1 is at pos35, the next logical step would be to push stone1 from pos45 to pos55:

19. Push stone1 from pos45 to pos55 using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos55 dirright".
    New state: player1 at pos45, stone1 at pos55.

Now, stone1 is at pos55 and player1 is at pos45. We need to move player1 to a position where it can push stone1 towards the goal:

20. Push stone1 from pos55 to pos54 using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos55 pos54 dirup".
    New state: player1 at pos55, stone1 at pos54.

21. Push stone1 from pos54 to pos53 using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos55 pos54 pos53 dirup".
    New state: player1 at pos54, stone1 at pos53.

22. Push stone1 from pos53 to pos52 using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos53 pos52 dirup".
    New state: player1 at pos53, stone1 at pos52.

23. Push stone1 from pos52 to pos51 using action "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos52 pos51 dirup".
    New state: player1 at pos52, stone1 at pos51.
    Note: stone1 is now at pos51, which is the goal!

Now, let's check if all constraints are satisfied:

Constraint 1: "Location pos41 is not clear" in at least one state.
- Satisfied in step 15.

Constraint 2: If pos41 is not clear, then at an earlier state pos35 is not clear.
- Satisfied in step 9.

Constraint 3: pos31 is not clear in at most one continuous sequence.
- Satisfied. We only made pos31 not clear in step 14 and moved away in step 15.

Constraint 4: player1 is never at pos12.
- Satisfied. The player1 never visited pos12.

Constraint 5: Either player1 or stone1 is at pos25 in at least one state.
- Satisfied in step 8 (stone1 at pos25) and step 9 (player1 at pos25).

Constraint 6: pos23 is always clear (after the stone is moved, I assume).
- Satisfied. After the stone is moved from pos23, we never occupy it with anything else.

Constraint 7: player1 is at pos22 in at most one continuous sequence.
- Satisfied. Player1 is at pos22 only in step 6.

Constraint 8: pos24 is not clear in at least one state.
- Satisfied in step 7.

Constraint 9: If pos24 is not clear, then at an earlier state pos44 is not clear.
- Satisfied. pos44 is not clear in step 2, which is before step 7.

Wait, let me double check this plan. Actually, step 11 is not correct. If player1 is at pos35 and stone1 is at pos45, and player1 moves up, it should be at pos25, not pos34. Let me correct the plan.

I think I've been confusing the layout of the grid. Let's think more carefully. If the stone is at pos45 and player1 is at pos35, and we are using these directions (right means increasing the first digit, down means increasing the second digit), then:

- pos32 is left of pos42
- pos52 is right of pos42
- pos43 is below pos42
- pos41 is above pos42

So, after the push in step 10, the state is: player1 at pos35, stone1 at pos45.

11. Move player1 from pos35 to pos34 (dirup).
    New state: player1 at pos34, stone1 at pos45.

12. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33 (dirup).
    New state: player1 at pos33, stone1 at pos45.

13. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32 (dirup).
    New state: player1 at pos32, stone1 at pos45.

14. Move player1 from pos32 to pos31 (dirup).
    New state: player1 at pos31, stone1 at pos45.
    Note: pos31 is now not clear, which we need to be aware of for constraint 3.

15. Move player1 from pos31 to pos41 (dirright).
    New state: player1 at pos41, stone1 at pos45.
    Note: pos41 is now not clear, which satisfies constraint 1.

16. Move player1 from pos41 to pos42 (dirdown).
    New state: player1 at pos42, stone1 at pos45.

17. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown).
    New state: player1 at pos43, stone1 at pos45.

18. Move player1 from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown).
    New state: player1 at pos44, stone1 at pos45.

19. Move player1 from pos44 to pos45 (dirdown). Wait, this isn't right. If stone1 is at pos45, player1 can't move to pos45. But for player1 to push stone1 to pos55, player1 needs to be at pos35. 

Actually, let me revisit the positions. I think I've been confusing the layout. Let's reconsider:

The grid is a 5x5 grid, and the positions are of the form posXY where X is the row (from top to bottom) and Y is the column (from left to right). So:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1 11 12 13 14 15
2 21 22 23 24 25
3 31 32 33 34 35
4 41 42 43 44 45
5 51 52 53 54 55
```

Given this layout, dirright means increasing the second digit, dirleft means decreasing the second digit, dirdown means increasing the first digit, and dirup means decreasing the first digit.

Initially, player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos23. Let's restart with this understanding.

Initial state:
- player1 is at pos42
- stone1 is at pos23

First, we need to make sure pos44 is not clear before making pos24 not clear.

1. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (dirright).
   New state: player1 at pos43, stone1 at pos23.

2. Move player1 from pos43 to pos44 (dirright).
   New state: player1 at pos44, stone1 at pos23.
   Note: pos44 is now not clear, satisfying the first part of constraint 9.

Now, let's move player1 towards pos23 to push the stone:

3. Move player1 from pos44 to pos34 (dirup).
   New state: player1 at pos34, stone1 at pos23.

4. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24 (dirup).
   New state: player1 at pos24, stone1 at pos23.

5. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23 (dirleft).
   New state: player1 at pos23, stone1 at pos23.
   Wait, this can't be right. If stone1 is at pos23, the player cannot move to pos23.

Let me rethink this. Let's refer to the grid more carefully.
In row 2, column 3 (pos23), we have stone1. To push the stone to pos24 (row 2, column 4), the player needs to be at pos22 (row 2, column 2). 

Let's go again with this understanding:

Initial state:
- player1 is at pos42 (row 4, column 2)
- stone1 is at pos23 (row 2, column 3)

1. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32 (dirup).
   New state: player1 at pos32, stone1 at pos23.

2. Move player1 from pos32 to pos22 (dirup).
   New state: player1 at pos22, stone1 at pos23.
   Note: player1 is now at pos22, which we need to be aware of for constraint 7.

Now we're positioned correctly to push the stone. But before that, we need to make sure pos44 is not clear.

3. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (dirdown).
   New state: player1 at pos32, stone1 at pos23.

4. Move player1 from pos32 to pos42 (dirdown).
   New state: player1 at pos42, stone1 at pos23.

5. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (dirright).
   New state: player1 at pos43, stone1 at pos23.

6. Move player1 from pos43 to pos44 (dirright).
   New state: player1 at pos44, stone1 at pos23.
   Note: pos44 is now not clear, satisfying the first part of constraint 9.

7. Move player1 from pos44 to pos34 (dirup).
   New state: player1 at pos34, stone1 at pos23.

8. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24 (dirup).
   New state: player1 at pos24, stone1 at pos23.

9. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23 (dirleft).
   New state: player1 at pos23, stone1 at pos23.
   Hmm, but I can't move to pos23 if stone1 is already there. Let's try to use the push action directly.

Actually, re-reading the constraints, the order of actions makes more sense to me now:

1. First, move player1 to pos44 to make it not clear.
2. Then, move to pos22 and push the stone to pos24 to make it not clear.
3. Then, push the stone to pos25 to satisfy constraint 5.
4. Then, move player1 to pos35 to make it not clear.
5. Then, move player1 to pos41 to make it not clear.
6. Finally, push the stone to pos51 to achieve the goal.

Let's try this again, being more careful about the grid positions.

Initial state:
- player1 is at pos42 (row 4, column 2)
- stone1 is at pos23 (row 2, column 3)

1. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (dirright).
   New state: player1 at pos43, stone1 at pos23.

2. Move player1 from pos43 to pos44 (dirright).
   New state: player1 at pos44, stone1 at pos23.
   Note: pos44 is now not clear, satisfying the first part of constraint 9.

3. Move player1 from pos44 to pos34 (dirup).
   New state: player1 at pos34, stone1 at pos23.

4. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33 (dirleft).
   New state: player1 at pos33, stone1 at pos23.

5. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32 (dirleft).
   New state: player1 at pos32, stone1 at pos23.

6. Move player1 from pos32 to pos22 (dirup).
   New state: player1 at pos22, stone1 at pos23.
   Note: player1 is now at pos22, which we need to be aware of for constraint 7.

7. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos24 using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirright".
   New state: player1 at pos23, stone1 at pos24.
   Note: pos24 is now not clear, which satisfies constraint 8.

8. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos25 using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirright".
   New state: player1 at pos24, stone1 at pos25.
   Note: stone1 is now at pos25, which satisfies constraint 5.

9. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 (dirdown).
   New state: player1 at pos34, stone1 at pos25.

10. Move player1 from pos34 to pos35 (dirright).
    New state: player1 at pos35, stone1 at pos25.
    Note: pos35 is now not clear, satisfying the first part of constraint 2.

11. Push stone1 from pos25 to pos35 using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos25 pos35 dirdown".
    Hmm, this isn't right. If player1 is at pos34 and stone1 is at pos25, I can't push it to pos35 since the player isn't adjacent to the stone.

Let me rethink this. After step 8, player1 is at pos24 and stone1 is at pos25. To push the stone down from pos25 to pos35, the player needs to be at pos15. But I can't directly move from pos24 to pos15. I need a different approach.

After step 8, let's move player1 to where it can push stone1 from pos25 to pos35:

9. Move player1 from pos24 to pos14 (dirup).
   New state: player1 at pos14, stone1 at pos25.

10. Move player1 from pos14 to pos15 (dirright).
    New state: player1 at pos15, stone1 at pos25.

11. Push stone1 from pos25 to pos35 using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos15 pos25 pos35 dirdown".
    New state: player1 at pos25, stone1 at pos35.
    Note: pos35 is now not clear, satisfying the first part of constraint 2.

12. Move player1 from pos25 to pos35 (dirdown).
    New state: player1 at pos35, stone1 at pos35.
    Wait, this can't be right.

I think I'm still confused about the directions. Let's double-check the understanding of the grid and directions.

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1 11 12 13 14 15
2 21 22 23 24 25
3 31 32 33 34 35
4 41 42 43 44 45
5 51 52 53 54 55
```

- dirright: Move to the right (increase the second digit)
- dirleft: Move to the left (decrease the second digit)
- dirdown: Move down (increase the first digit)
- dirup: Move up (decrease the first digit)

For the push action, the direction refers to the direction the stone is being pushed.

So, to push the stone from pos23 to pos24, we need the player to be at pos22, and the direction is dirright. This will move the stone to the right, from pos23 to pos24, and the player will end up at pos23.

OK, with this clarified, let's try again:

Initial state:
- player1 is at pos42 (row 4, column 2)
- stone1 is at pos23 (row 2, column 3)

1. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (dirright).
   New state: player1 at pos43, stone1 at pos23.

2. Move player1 from pos43 to pos44 (dirright).
   New state: player1 at pos44, stone1 at pos23.
   Note: pos44 is now not clear, satisfying the first part of constraint 9.

3. Move player1 from pos44 to pos34 (dirup).
   New state: player1 at pos34, stone1 at pos23.

4. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24 (dirup).
   New state: player1 at pos24, stone1 at pos23.

5. Move player1 from pos24 to pos14 (dirup).
   New state: player1 at pos14, stone1 at pos23.

6. Move player1 from pos14 to pos13 (dirleft).
   New state: player1 at pos13, stone1 at pos23.

7. Move player1 from pos13 to pos23 (dirdown).
   New state: player1 at pos23, stone1 at pos23.
   Wait, this is wrong. If the stone is at pos23, I can't move the player to pos23.

I think I need to be more careful about the sequence of moves. Let's think step by step.

Initial state:
- player1 is at pos42 (row 4, column 2)
- stone1 is at pos23 (row 2, column 3)

To push the stone from pos23 to pos24, the player needs to be at pos22. Let's first move to pos44 to satisfy constraint 9, and then to pos22:

1. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (dirright).
   New state: player1 at pos43, stone1 at pos23.

2. Move player1 from pos43 to pos44 (dirright).
   New state: player1 at pos44, stone1 at pos23.
   Note: pos44 is now not clear, satisfying the first part of constraint 9.

3. Move player1 from pos44 to pos34 (dirup).
   New state: player1 at pos34, stone1 at pos23.

4. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24 (dirup).
   New state: player1 at pos24, stone1 at pos23.

5. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23 (dirleft).
   New state: player1 at pos23, stone1 at pos23.
   Wait, that's wrong. Let me rethink.

Actually, I think I'll try going through the grid manually to understand the layout better.

If the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos23, the player is 2 rows below and 1 column to the left of the stone. To push the stone from pos23 to pos24, the player needs to be at pos22, which is to the left of pos23.

Player's path from pos42 to pos22 could be:

42 -> 32 (up) -> 22 (up)

Actually, I'm having an insight now. If I push the stone from pos23 to pos24, the player will end up at pos23. And the constraint 6 states that pos23 should be clear in every state. But if the player is at pos23, then pos23 is not clear.

Actually hold on. constraint 6 states:
"The following expression must hold in every state: Location pos23 is clear."

But Initial state of the world has "stone1 is at location pos23", which means that pos23 is not clear initially

I'm a bit confused now. What I understand is that pos23 should be clear, meaning it shouldn't be occupied by the agent or the stone. But in the initial state, stone1 is at pos23, so pos23 is not clear. Either there's a flaw in the problem statement or I'm misunderstanding something.

Actually the constraint also mentions "Location pos23 is clear". But actually, I'm given that the stone is initially at location pos23. This seems like there's a constraint that is violated already in the initial state of the world.

Let me re-read the initial state information: "stone1 is at location pos23"
and "Location pos23 is clear"

These two seem to be in conflict. If the stone is at pos23, then pos23 is not clear, right?

Actually, I think I am being confused by the representation. If the stone is at pos23, maybe pos23 is technically "clear" but it is obviously occupied. I think what constraint 6 means is that after the stone is moved, the position should not be occupied by the agent. Let's attempt the solution with that understanding.

Initial state:
- player1 is at pos42 (row 4, column 2)
- stone1 is at pos23 (row 2, column 3)

Plan:
1. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (dirright).
   New state: player1 at pos43, stone1 at pos23.

2. Move player1 from pos43 to pos44 (dirright).
   New state: player1 at pos44, stone1 at pos23.
   Note: pos44 is now not clear, satisfying the first part of constraint 9.

3. Move player1 from pos44 to pos34 (dirup).
   New state: player1 at pos34, stone1 at pos23.

4. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24 (dirup).
   New state: player1 at pos24, stone1 at pos23.

5. Move player1 from pos24 to pos14 (dirup).
   New state: player1 at pos14, stone1 at pos23.

6. Move player1 from pos14 to pos13 (dirleft).
   New state: player1 at pos13, stone1 at pos23.

7. Move player1 from pos13 to pos23 (dirdown).
   New state: player1 at pos23, stone1 at pos23.
   Wait, this is still wrong. If the stone is at pos23, the player can't move to pos23.

I think I need to revisit the problem statement. The issue is, if the stone is at pos23, then pos23 is not "clear" because it's occupied by the stone.

Actually, I have a new understanding. The constraint is based on the predicates in the problem statement. "Location pos23 is clear", but "player1 is at location pos42", and "stone1 is at location pos23". It seems like they are distinct predicates. So maybe the predicate "Location pos23 is clear" is not updated when a stone or player is at that location.

Actually, I read through the action "move" and it says that
1. One precondition is location l_to is clear.
2. One effect is that location l_to is no longer clear.

This means that "clear" is indeed a distinction, and initially stone1 is at pos23 but also "Location pos23 is clear" is true.

Let's try to make sense of this. "Location l is clear" means that the agent can move to location l, right? But if stone1 is at pos23, then the agent can't move to pos23. This seems inconsistent.

Actually, looking at the effects of the push actions:
"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": After performing this action, (i) agent p is no longer at location l_p, (ii) stone s is no longer at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is no longer clear, (iv) agent p is at location l_from, (v) stone s is at location l_to, (vi) location l_p is clear, and (vi) stone s is at a goal state.

it says that "location l_to is no longer clear", which means that when a stone is at a location, that location is still "clear" in the predicate sense.

So, the constraint 6 means that the predicate "Location pos23 is clear" must hold in every state. Similarly, if "stone1 is at location pos23", it doesn't automatically update "Location pos23 is clear" to false.

That was confusing, but I'll try to proceed with the understanding that the "clear" predicate is separate from the presence of a stone or player.

In fact, now I'm confused by the initial state. It says:
"stone1 is at location pos23"
"Location pos23 is clear"

And other locations like "Location pos11 is clear", etc. Are these all true in the initial state?

But then there's the "move" action which has a precondition that l_to is clear. If the agent can't move to where there's a stone, and pos23 has a stone, how can pos23 be clear?

OK so here's my attempt at a solution with this understanding. I'm going from the beginning again.

I'm going to read this problem one more time.

The stone is at pos23, but pos23 is clear. The agent is at pos42, but pos42 is also clear.

If both the agent's position and the stone's position are clear, then "clear" doesn't refer to the absence of an agent or a stone.

The preconditions for the move action say that the location l_to must be clear for the agent to move there.

The effects of the move action say that the location l_from becomes clear and l_to is no longer clear after the move.

So it seems like "clear" might be a conceptual property of a location. A location becomes "not clear" when an agent moves there, and a location becomes "clear" when an agent moves away from it.

In this context, constraint 6 would mean that we should never have the agent (player1) move to pos23 in any state, since that would make the location not clear.

OK, with this understanding:

Initial state:
- player1 is at pos42 (row 4, column 2)
- stone1 is at pos23 (row 2, column 3)
- pos23 is clear (and many other positions are also clear)

Let's see that the preconditions for the push actions again:

pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d":
Agent p should be at location l_p.
Stone s should be at location l_from.
Location l_to should be clear.
From l_p, you can reach l_from in direction d.
From l_from, you can reach l_to in direction d.
l_to is a goal location.

It's not mentioned that l_from should be clear. So, even if stone1 is at pos23, the fact that pos23 is clear doesn't conflict with the action's preconditions.

Now, let's push the stone to pos24:

To push stone1 from pos23 to pos24, player1 needs to be at pos22 (to approach from the left). Now, the precondition for the "push" action is that from pos22 to pos23 in direction dirright and from pos23 to pos24 in direction dirright. After the push, player1 will be at pos23 and stone1 will be at pos24.

But, according to constraint 6, we need to ensure that pos23 is always clear. But if player1 is at pos23, then the location would be "not clear," violating the constraint.

OK, Now I'm officially confused about the definition of "clear" and the constraints of the problem. 

Ok, I'm giving this another thought.

There's a clear distinction between the predicates:
- "player1 is at location X"
- "stone1 is at location X"
- "Location X is clear"

It seems like these are disjoint predicates. Initially, stone1 is at pos23 and "Location pos23 is clear" is also true, which means the predicates don't automatically update each other.

In the context of the actions, a location being "clear" is a precondition for movement, and when an agent or a stone moves to a location, the location is no longer "clear," and when they move away, the location becomes "clear" again.

So, the constraint that "Location pos23 is clear" must hold in every state means that we can never have a situation where the predicate "Location pos23 is clear" is false, which could happen if an agent or a stone moves to pos23 through the move or push action.

But, the reality is that stone1 is initially at pos23 and "Location pos23 is clear" is also true. But the problem does not make sense. How I can push a stone that's initially at pos23 without having the player at an adjacent location, and how can I have the player at that adjacent location without then violating the constraint that pos23 is always clear?

I'm going to start over. But I think I need to consider other possible understanding of the problem.

Initial state:
- player1 is at pos42 (row 4, column 2)
- stone1 is at pos23 (row 2, column 3)

Actually, if the stone initially at pos23 and also "Location pos23 is clear" holds, this seems like a logical inconsistency. But I'll leave it as is my understanding that "Location X is clear" is that the agent can move to X, and it's independent of whether there's a stone there.

Constraint 6 says "Location pos23 is clear" must hold in every state. If the precondition for an agent to move to a location is that the location is clear, and the effect of an agent moving to a location is that the location is no longer clear, then constraint 6 means we can never have the agent move to pos23.

So, let's try to come up with a plan where the agent never moves to pos23:

1. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (dirright).
   New state: player1 at pos43, stone1 at pos23.

2. Move player1 from pos43 to pos44 (dirright).
   New state: player1 at pos44, stone1 at pos23.
   Note: pos44 is now not clear, satisfying the first part of constraint 9.

3. Move player1 from pos44 to pos34 (dirup).
   New state: player1 at pos34, stone1 at pos23.

4. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24 (dirup).
   New state: player1 at pos24, stone1 at pos23.

The problem is, how do I push the stone from pos23 to pos24 if "Location pos23 is clear" must always hold, and it turns "not clear" when player1 moves there?

This logic doesn't make sense.

Actually, I think the premise that I'm getting right is this one: even though stone1 is at pos23, "Location pos23 is clear" is ALSO true. And after the stone is pushed away from pos23, "Location pos23 is clear" will STILL be true. So the constraint 6 isn't saying anything about where the stone or agent can be; it's just saying that the predicate "Location pos23 is clear" must be true in every state.

That is, the predicate "Location pos23 is clear" doesn't stand in conflict with the predicate "stone1 is at pos23". They can both be true at the same time.

With this clarification, I'm going to attempt a solution without overthinking the "clear" predicate. I'm just going to be to plan out a valid sequence of actions that push the stone to the goal.

To push stone1 from pos23 to pos24, player1 needs to be at pos22. So:

1. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32 (dirup).
   New state: player1 at pos32, stone1 at pos23.

2. Move player1 from pos32 to pos22 (dirup).
   New state: player1 at pos22, stone1 at pos23.
   Note: player1 is now at pos22, which we need to be aware of for constraint 7.

Now, to satisfy constraint 9, we need to ensure that pos44 is not clear before pos24 is not clear. Let's go back and revise our plan.

Since the only way to make a location "not clear" is by having player1 or stone1 move to it (through the move, pushtogoal, or pushtonongoal actions). And we want to satisfy the constraint that pos23 is clear in every state it means that player1 can't be at pos23.

In the push actions, player1 ends up at the location where the stone was. But we want player1 to never be at pos23, which means we can't push stone1 from pos23 to anywhere. But that's the initial position of the stone.

So I think we might actually have a constraint 6 that can't be satisfied, since player1 needs to push the stone from its initial position but can't end up at pos23. But that's a separate issue. 

OK, I'm giving it another thought.

The problem statement seems to have a setup where stone1 is at pos23 and also pos23 is clear. This is confusing. 

But let's test our understanding:

1. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32 (dirup).
   New state: player1 at pos32, stone1 at pos23, Location pos23 is clear (according to our interpretation).

2. Move player1 from pos32 to pos22 (dirup).
   New state: player1 at pos22, stone1 at pos23, Location pos23 is clear.
   Note: player1 is now at pos22, which we need to be aware of for constraint 7.

3. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos24 using "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirright"
   New state: player1 at pos23, stone1 at pos24.

But now player1 is at pos23, which means "Location pos23 is clear" is not true anymore. And constraint 6 requires this to hold in every state.

Alright, I see the inconsistency. For now, let's continue with the problem assuming that constraint 6 means that player1 can't be at pos23 in any state. We'll see if we can devise a valid action plan and check at the end if our constraints are met.

Goal: Push stone1 to pos51 (the goal location).
Constraint: player1 can't be at pos23 in any state.

If stone1 is at pos23 initially, the easiest way to move it is by pushing. But pushing would place player1 at pos23, which violates constraint 6. So, we need to find a way to move stone1 without player1 ever being at pos23.

But the "pushtogoal" and "pushtonongoal" actions both result in agent p being at location l_from after the action, which in this case would be pos23. So, by the constraints of the problem, we can't push the stone from its initial position.

So, actually this problem cannot be solved.

Wait, I want to reread the problem description.

Initial state:
- player1 is at pos42 (row 4, column 2)
- stone1 is at pos23 (row 2, column 3)
- "Location pos11 is clear"
- "Location pos12 is clear"
- "Location pos13 is clear" ... and many more locations are clear.
- "pos51 is a goal location"
- Move connections in various directions ...
- "pos11 is not a goal location", "pos12 is not a goal location", ... and most positions are not goal locations.
- "Location pos23 is clear"
- "Location pos42 is clear"

Constraint 6 says: "The following expression must hold in every state: "Location pos23 is clear""

So, the question I'm grappling with is: initially, stone1 is at pos23, and "Location pos23 is clear" is also true. When the stone is pushed to another location using the "pushtonongoal" or "pushtogoal" action, the player would end up at pos23. Would that violate the constraint that "Location pos23 is clear" must hold in every state?

Given the logical structure of the problem, I believe the constraints are operating under the assumption that we're working with predicates. So, "Location pos23 is clear" is a logical state that can be true or false independent of the location of the stone or the player. Initially it happens to be that "Location pos23 is clear" is true (an explicit part of the state), even though stone1 is at pos23.

if that's the case, it's possible that the constraint is saying that the logical predicate "Location pos23 is clear" must be true in every state, not that the physical location pos23 must be unoccupied. But on the other hand, the "move" action says that location l_to is no longer clear. For me this only makes sense if the clearness of the tile is related to *whether an agent can move to it*, and not related to whether the tile is currently unoccupied. (But this interpretation too has its own problem; why would pos23 be clear if stone1 is on it? Can an agent move to a location where a stone is? That seems counterintuitive.)

Oh, there is a related predicate that "pos23 is clear" (which incidentally is the initial state).  And there is also the statement that stone1 is at pos23 in the initial state.

Maybe the right interpretation is that the constraint 6 is saying that the predicate "Location pos23 is clear" must be true in every state, but the actual location pos23 can be occupied by the agent or the stone.

Let's go with that understanding. The constraint says the logical predicate "Location pos23 is clear" must be true in every state.

Initial state from relevant bits:
- player1 is at pos42 (row 4, column 2)
- stone1 is at pos23 (row 2, column 3)
- "Location pos23 is clear" (and many other locations are clear)

I'm starting to think those are actually predicates that track multiple properties of the system.

OK, I'm going to attempt a solution without overthinking the semantics of the constraint. Let's just come up with a valid action sequence that pushes the stone to the goal.

Let's start by moving player1 to a position adjacent to the stone (pos22) so we can push it:

1. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32 (dirup).
   New state: player1 at pos32, stone1 at pos23.

2. Move player1 from pos32 to pos22 (dirup).
   New state: player1 at pos22, stone1 at pos23.
   Note: player1 is now at pos22, which we need to be aware of for constraint 7.

Now, we're ready to push the stone. But we first need to satisfy constraint 9, which states that pos44 must be not clear before pos24 is not clear. So, for now, we'll leave the stone where it is and move the agent to pos44:

3. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (dirdown).
   New state: player1 at pos32, stone1 at pos23.

4. Move player1 from pos32 to pos42 (dirdown).
   New state: player1 at pos42, stone1 at pos23.

5. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (dirright).
   New state: player1 at pos43, stone1 at pos23.

6. Move player1 from pos43 to pos44 (dirright).
   New state: player1 at pos44, stone1 at pos23.
   Note: pos44 is now not clear, which satisfies the precondition of constraint 9.

Now, we'll move player1 back to a position where it can push the stone:

7. Move player1 from pos44 to pos34 (dirup).
   New state: player1 at pos34, stone1 at pos23.

8. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24 (dirup).
   New state: player1 at pos24, stone1 at pos23.

9. Move player1 from pos24 to pos25 (dirright).
   New state: player1 at pos25, stone1 at pos23.
   Note: player1 is now at pos25, which satisfies constraint 5.

10. Move player1 from pos25 to pos35 (dirdown).
    New state: player1 at pos35, stone1 at pos23.
    Note: pos35 is now not clear, which satisfies the precondition of constraint 2.

11. Move player1 from pos35 to pos25 (dirup).
    New state: player1 at pos25, stone1 at pos23.

12. Move player1 from pos25 to pos24 (dirleft).
    New state: player1 at pos24, stone1 at pos23.

13. Move player1 from pos24 to pos14 (dirup).
    New state: player1 at pos14, stone1 at pos23.

14. Move player1 from pos14 to pos13 (dirleft).
    New state: player1 at pos13, stone1 at pos23.

15. Move player1 from pos13 to pos12 (dirleft).
    New state: player1 at pos12, stone1 at pos23.
    Wait, this violates constraint 4, which says player1 should never be at pos12. Let's find another route.

Actually I can get from pos24 to pos22 by doing
13. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23 (dirleft).
    New state: player1 at pos23, stone1 at pos23. 
    Wait, this doesn't make sense.

I think there's a misunderstanding or inconsistency in the problem statement.

OK let me try this: Maybe the "Location pos23 is clear" doesn't mean that position pos23 is empty; it means that that the predicate "Location pos23 is clear" is true. The initial state says that the stone is at pos23, and since that's the predicate, it's not inconsistent.

So constraint 6 means the predicate "Location pos23 is clear" must be true in every state, not that the location pos23 should be unoccupied. In this context constraint 6 doesn't actually restrict our plan meaningfully.

13. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23 (dirleft). 
    But moving player1 to pos23, if the stone is already there, is not a valid move. And I'd need to move to pos22 to push the stone.

13. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 (dirdown).
    New state: player1 at pos34, stone1 at pos23.

14. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33 (dirleft).
    New state: player1 at pos33, stone1 at pos23.

15. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32 (dirleft).
    New state: player1 at pos32, stone1 at pos23.

16. Move player1 from pos32 to pos22 (dirup).
    New state: player1 at pos22, stone1 at pos23.

I got the player back to pos22, which is adjacent to the stone. Now, we can push it:

17. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos24 using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirright".
    New state: player1 at pos23, stone1 at pos24.
    Note: pos24 is now not clear, which satisfies constraint 8.

Now, to satisfy constraint 5, we need to push the stone to pos25:

18. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos25 using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirright".
    New state: player1 at pos24, stone1 at pos25.
    Note: stone1 is now at pos25, which satisfies constraint 5.

Next, we want to move the stone towards the goal. We need to move the player so it can push the stone further:

19. Move player1 from pos24 to pos25 (dirright).
    New state: player1 at pos25, stone1 at pos25.
    Wait, this doesn't work. The stone is already at pos25, so the player can't move there.

For an agent to push a stone from pos25 to pos35, the agent needs to be at pos15.

19. Move player1 from pos24 to pos14 (dirup).
    New state: player1 at pos14, stone1 at pos25.

20. Move player1 from pos14 to pos15 (dirright).
    New state: player1 at pos15, stone1 at pos25.

Now, player1 is in a position to push the stone down:

21. Push stone1 from pos25 to pos35 using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos15 pos25 pos35 dirdown".
    New state: player1 at pos25, stone1 at pos35.
    Note: pos35 is now not clear, which satisfies the precondition of constraint 2.

To push the stone from pos35 to pos45, the agent needs to be at pos25.

22. Push stone1 from pos35 to pos45 using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos35 pos45 dirdown".
    New state: player1 at pos35, stone1 at pos45.

Now, to satisfy constraint 2 (pos35 is not clear before pos41 is not clear), and then constraint 1 (pos41 must be not clear in at least one state), we'll move player1 to pos41:

23. Move player1 from pos35 to pos34 (dirleft).
    New state: player1 at pos34, stone1 at pos45.

24. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33 (dirleft).
    New state: player1 at pos33, stone1 at pos45.

25. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32 (dirleft).
    New state: player1 at pos32, stone1 at pos45.

26. Move player1 from pos32 to pos31 (dirleft).
    New state: player1 at pos31, stone1 at pos45.
    Note: pos31 is now not clear, which we need to be aware of for constraint 3.

27. Move player1 from pos31 to pos41 (dirdown).
    New state: player1 at pos41, stone1 at pos45.
    Note: pos41 is now not clear, which satisfies constraint 1.

Now, we've built a valid plan that satisfies constraints 1-5, 7-9. Constraint 6 is about the predicate "Location pos23 is clear" being true in every state, which I still don't quite understand. But assuming the plan is fine there, we move on.

player1 needs to go to a position from where it can push the stone further towards goal:

28. Move player1 from pos41 to pos42 (dirright).
    New state: player1 at pos42, stone1 at pos45.

29. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (dirright).
    New state: player1 at pos43, stone1 at pos45.

30. Move player1 from pos43 to pos44 (dirright).
    New state: player1 at pos44, stone1 at pos45.

31. Move player1 from pos44 to pos45 (dirright).
    New state: player1 at pos45, stone1 at pos45.
    Wait, this doesn't make sense. If the stone is at pos45, player1 can't move to pos45.

Actually, I realized the issue is related to the logic of Sokoban. If stone1 is at pos45, to push it to, say, pos55, player1 would need to be at pos35. So, instead of moving player1 to pos45, we'll move it to pos35:

31. Move player1 from pos44 to pos34 (dirup).
    New state: player1 at pos34, stone1 at pos45.

32. Move player1 from pos34 to pos35 (dirright).
    New state: player1 at pos35, stone1 at pos45.

33. Push stone1 from pos45 to pos55 using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos55 dirdown".
    New state: player1 at pos45, stone1 at pos55.

Now, we need to move the stone to the goal (pos51). From pos55, we can move left to get to pos51.

34. Move player1 from pos45 to pos44 (dirleft).
    New state: player1 at pos44, stone1 at pos55.

35. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43 (dirleft).
    New state: player1 at pos43, stone1 at pos55.

36. Move player1 from pos43 to pos53 (dirdown).
    New state: player1 at pos53, stone1 at pos55.

37. Move player1 from pos53 to pos54 (dirright).
    New state: player1 at pos54, stone1 at pos55.

Now, player1 is in a position to push the stone left:

38. Push stone1 from pos55 to pos54 using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos55 pos54 dirleft".
    New state: player1 at pos55, stone1 at pos54.

39. Push stone1 from pos54 to pos53 using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos55 pos54 pos53 dirleft".
    New state: player1 at pos54, stone1 at pos53.

40. Push stone1 from pos53 to pos52 using action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos53 pos52 dirleft".
    New state: player1 at pos53, stone1 at pos52.

41. Push stone1 from pos52 to pos51 using action "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos52 pos51 dirleft".
    New state: player1 at pos52, stone1 at pos51, stone1 is at goal pos51.

I think the goal is satisfied in this plan.
