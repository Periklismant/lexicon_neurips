Let's first understand the current state of the world:

Current state:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
- red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- green_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- black_block_1 is clear
- purple_block_1 is clear
- green_block_1 is clear
- the robot is not holding any block

To visualize this:
```
           purple_block_1
                 |
           red_block_1
                 |
           blue_block_2
                 |
           blue_block_1
                 
           black_block_1

           green_block_1
                 |
           grey_block_1
```

The goal is to bring about:
- blue_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1

Let's now analyze the constraints:

1. "purple_block_1 is not on the table" must be true in every state. This is already true in the initial state, as purple_block_1 is on top of red_block_1.

2. "you are holding purple_block_1" must be true in at least one state. This means we need to include in our plan an action that involves picking up purple_block_1.

3. If "you are holding purple_block_1" is true in a state s, then "black_block_1 is not on the table" must be true at state s or later. This means that once we pick up purple_block_1, we need to ensure that black_block_1 is no longer on the table.

4. "blue_block_1 is on top of green_block_1" must be true in at least one state. This means we need to include in our plan the action of placing blue_block_1 on top of green_block_1 at some point.

5. "blue_block_2 is not on the table" must be true in every state. This is already satisfied in the initial state, as blue_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1.

6. "there is no block on top of blue_block_1, i.e., blue_block_1 is clear" must be true in at least one state. This means we need to make sure blue_block_1 is clear at some point.

7. If "there is no block on top of blue_block_1, i.e., blue_block_1 is clear" is true in a state, then "grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2" must be true in an earlier state. This means that before we can have blue_block_1 clear, we need to have grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2 at some point.

8. "you are holding blue_block_2" must be true in at least one state. This means we need to include in our plan the action of picking up blue_block_2.

9. If "you are holding blue_block_2" is true in a state s, then "black_block_1 is not clear OR black_block_1 is not on the table" must be true at state s or later. This means that after we pick up blue_block_2, we need to make sure black_block_1 is either not clear or not on the table.

10. "red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2" must be true in at least one state. This is already satisfied in the initial state.

11. If "red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2" is true in a state s, then "grey_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 OR grey_block_1 is clear" must be true at state s or later. Looking at the initial state, red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2, but grey_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1 and it's not clear (it has green_block_1 on top). This means we need to make one of these conditions true.

Now, let's try to devise a plan that achieves the goal while satisfying all constraints.

First, let's break down the goal: we need to put blue_block_1 on top of purple_block_1. This means:
- We need to clear blue_block_1 (i.e., remove blue_block_2, red_block_1, and purple_block_1 from the stack).
- We need to make purple_block_1 clear (which it already is) and keep it off the table (constraint 1).

Given constraint 7, before we can clear blue_block_1, we need to have grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2 at some point.

Let's start planning:

1. Current state: blue_block_1 is on the table, blue_block_2 is on blue_block_1, red_block_1 is on blue_block_2, purple_block_1 is on red_block_1, black_block_1 is on the table, grey_block_1 is on the table, green_block_1 is on grey_block_1.

2. First, let's unstack purple_block_1 from red_block_1:
   - unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1
   Now, we are holding purple_block_1 (satisfying constraint 2).
   Due to constraint 3, we need to make sure black_block_1 is not on the table. Let's stack purple_block_1 on black_block_1:
   - stack purple_block_1 black_block_1
   Now black_block_1 is not clear (it has purple_block_1 on top). We'll handle constraint 3 later.

3. Now, let's unstack red_block_1 from blue_block_2:
   - unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2
   We're holding red_block_1.

4. Due to constraint 11, since red_block_1 was on top of blue_block_2, we need to make sure that grey_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 or grey_block_1 is clear.
   But grey_block_1 currently has green_block_1 on top. Let's unstack green_block_1 from grey_block_1:
   - stack red_block_1 black_block_1
   - unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1
   Now grey_block_1 is clear (satisfying the second condition of constraint 11).

5. Now, let's unstack blue_block_2 from blue_block_1:
   - unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1
   We're holding blue_block_2 (satisfying constraint 8).
   Due to constraint 9, we need to ensure that "black_block_1 is not clear OR black_block_1 is not on the table". Currently, black_block_1 has red_block_1 and purple_block_1 stacked on it, so it's not clear. This satisfies constraint 9.

6. Due to constraint 7, before we can have blue_block_1 clear (which it already is), we need to have grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2 at some point. Let's stack blue_block_2 on grey_block_1, and then stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2:
   - stack blue_block_2 grey_block_1
   - unstack grey_block_1 (from the table)
   
Wait, I'm making an error in my planning. The "unstack" action is for unstacking a block from another block, not from the table. Let's revise:

5. Now, let's unstack blue_block_2 from blue_block_1:
   - unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1
   We're holding blue_block_2 (satisfying constraint 8).
   Due to constraint 9, we need to ensure that "black_block_1 is not clear OR black_block_1 is not on the table". Currently, black_block_1 has red_block_1 and purple_block_1 stacked on it, so it's not clear. This satisfies constraint 9.

6. Due to constraint 7, before we can have blue_block_1 clear (which it already is), we need to have grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2 at some point.
   - stack blue_block_2 grey_block_1
   - unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_2
   Actually, this sequence doesn't make sense. We're stacking blue_block_2 on grey_block_1, but then we're trying to unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_2, which is inconsistent.

Actually, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's revise and just focus on satisfying the goal and constraints in a straightforward manner.

Let's start with the initial state again:

Blue_block_1 is on the table, blue_block_2 is on blue_block_1, red_block_1 is on blue_block_2, purple_block_1 is on red_block_1, and so on.

Constraint 7 says that if blue_block_1 is clear, then grey_block_1 must have been on top of blue_block_2 at some earlier point. So, let's plan to put grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2 before making blue_block_1 clear.

Constraint 4 says that blue_block_1 must be on top of green_block_1 at some point.

Constraint 11 says that if red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2 (which it initially is), then grey_block_1 must be on top of red_block_1 or grey_block_1 must be clear. Currently, neither of these is true.

Constraint 9 says that if we're holding blue_block_2, then black_block_1 must not be clear or not on the table.

Let's first ensure that constraint 11 is satisfied by making grey_block_1 clear:
- unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1

Now grey_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint 11.

Next, let's satisfy constraint 4 by temporarily placing blue_block_1 on top of green_block_1. This means we need to clear blue_block_1 first, which in turn requires satisfying constraint a bunch of other constraints.

Actually, I realized I'm getting confused and overcomplicating. Let me take a step back and think more systematically.

Let's first identify the actions needed to achieve the goal: place blue_block_1 on top of purple_block_1.

For this, we need to:
1. Clear blue_block_1 (i.e., remove blue_block_2 and everything above it from blue_block_1).
2. Make purple_block_1 accessible (it's already clear).
3. Pick up blue_block_1 and stack it on purple_block_1.

To clear blue_block_1, we need to:
1. Remove purple_block_1 from red_block_1.
2. Remove red_block_1 from blue_block_2.
3. Remove blue_block_2 from blue_block_1.

Given constraint 7, before blue_block_1 becomes clear, grey_block_1 must be on top of blue_block_2 at some point. 

Given constraint 2, we must hold purple_block_1 at some point.

Given constraint 3, after we hold purple_block_1, black_block_1 must not be on the table at some point.

Given constraint 8, we must hold blue_block_2 at some point.

Given constraint 9, after we hold blue_block_2, black_block_1 must not be clear or not on the table.

Given constraint 4, blue_block_1 must be on top of green_block_1 at some point.

Given constraint 11, after red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2, grey_block_1 must be on top of red_block_1 or clear.

Before I dive into the detailed planning, let's think about the structure of the plan:

1. Handle constraint 11 first. Since red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2 in the initial state, we need to ensure grey_block_1 is clear or on top of red_block_1. Let's try to make grey_block_1 clear by removing green_block_1.
2. Clear blue_block_1, but first satisfy constraint 7 by ensuring grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2 at some point.
3. Satisfy constraint 2 by picking up purple_block_1 at some point.
4. After picking up purple_block_1, satisfy constraint 3 by ensuring black_block_1 is not on the table.
5. Satisfy constraint 4 by placing blue_block_1 on top of green_block_1 at some point.
6. Finally, achieve the goal by placing blue_block_1 on top of purple_block_1.

Let's try to sequence the actions:

1. unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1
   Now grey_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint 11.

2. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1
   Now we're holding purple_block_1, satisfying constraint 2.

3. stack purple_block_1 green_block_1
   We need to put purple_block_1 somewhere and we choose green_block_1.

4. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2
   We're clearing the way to access blue_block_2.

5. stack red_block_1 black_block_1
   We're placing red_block_1 so that black_block_1 is not clear.

6. pickup grey_block_1
   We're picking up grey_block_1 to place it on top of blue_block_2 (to satisfy constraint 7).

7. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2
   Now grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2, satisfying constraint 7.

8. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_2
   We're clearing the way to access blue_block_2.

9. stack grey_block_1 red_block_1
   We're placing grey_block_1 somewhere. Choosing red_block_1.

10. unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1
    Now blue_block_1 is clear, and we previously satisfied constraint 7, so this is ok.

11. stack blue_block_2 black_block_1
    We're placing blue_block_2. Now black_block_1 is not clear, satisfying constraint 9. Also, by placing it on black_block_1, we're ensuring black_block_1 won't be on the table when we pick up blue_block_1.

12. pickup blue_block_1
    Now we're holding blue_block_1.

13. stack blue_block_1 green_block_1
    This satisfies constraint 4.

14. unstack blue_block_1 green_block_1
    We're retrieving blue_block_1 to fulfill the goal.

15. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_1
    We're retrieving purple_block_1 to position it for the goal.

16. stack purple_block_1 black_block_1
    Now black_block_1 is not on the table (due to having blocks on it), satisfying constraint 3.

17. pickup blue_block_1
    Now we're holding blue_block_1.

18. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1
    Goal achieved!

Wait, there's an issue. Before unstack purple_block_1 (step 15), blue_block_1 is somewhere, but that couldn't be achieved with the step 14, since unstack requires the block to be on top of another block, not on the table. Let's revise.

Also, I'm losing track of the state. Let me try to be more organized and keep track of the state after each action.

Initial state:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
- red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- green_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- black_block_1 is clear
- purple_block_1 is clear
- green_block_1 is clear
- the robot is not holding any block

Let's make a more organized plan:

1. Action: unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1
   Now we're holding green_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear, purple_block_1 still on red_block_1, red_block_1 still on blue_block_2, blue_block_2 still on blue_block_1, blue_block_1 and black_block_1 still on the table.

2. Action: stack green_block_1 black_block_1
   We place green_block_1 on black_block_1, so black_block_1 is no longer clear. grey_block_1 is clear, purple_block_1 still on red_block_1, red_block_1 still on blue_block_2, blue_block_2 still on blue_block_1, blue_block_1 still on the table.

3. Action: unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1
   Now we're holding purple_block_1 (satisfying constraint 2), red_block_1 is now clear, red_block_1 still on blue_block_2, blue_block_2 still on blue_block_1, blue_block_1 and black_block_1 still on the table, green_block_1 on black_block_1. We need to satisfy constraint 3, which says black_block_1 should not be on the table after holding purple_block_1, but black_block_1 is currently on the table.

4. Action: stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1
   We place purple_block_1 on grey_block_1, so grey_block_1 is no longer clear, red_block_1 is clear, red_block_1 still on blue_block_2, blue_block_2 still on blue_block_1, blue_block_1 and black_block_1 still on the table, green_block_1 on black_block_1.

5. Action: unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2
   Now we're holding red_block_1, blue_block_2 is now clear, blue_block_2 is still on blue_block_1, blue_block_1 and black_block_1 still on the table, green_block_1 on black_block_1, purple_block_1 on grey_block_1. We need to satisfy constraint 11, which says that after red_block_1 was on blue_block_2, grey_block_1 should be on top of red_block_1 or clear. But grey_block_1 is not clear anymore (it has purple_block_1 on top), so we need to ensure grey_block_1 is on top of red_block_1. (Actually, I'm being paranoid here because red_block_1 isn't on blue_block_2 anymore, but let's satisfy it just to be on the safe side. If constraint 11 only applies when red_block_1 is currently on blue_block_2, then we already satisfied it earlier when we made grey_block_1 clear.)

6. Action: stack red_block_1 green_block_1
   We place red_block_1 on green_block_1, so green_block_1 is no longer clear, blue_block_2 is clear, blue_block_2 still on blue_block_1, blue_block_1 and black_block_1 still on the table, green_block_1 on black_block_1, purple_block_1 on grey_block_1.

7. Action: unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1
   Now we're holding blue_block_2 (satisfying constraint 8), blue_block_1 is now clear. We need to satisfy constraint 9, which says black_block_1 should not be clear or not on the table after holding blue_block_2. Currently, black_block_1 is on the table and not clear (it has green_block_1, red_block_1 on top), so that's satisfied.

8. Action: pickup grey_block_1
   Oops, I can't do this because grey_block_1 isn't clear. Let's revise.

7. (Alternative) Action: stack blue_block_2 purple_block_1
   We place blue_block_2 on purple_block_1, so purple_block_1 is no longer clear, blue_block_1 is clear, blue_block_1 and black_block_1 still on the table, green_block_1 on black_block_1, red_block_1 on green_block_1. Now we have a problem with constraint 7, which says before making blue_block_1 clear, grey_block_1 should be on top of blue_block_2. But blue_block_2 is no longer on blue_block_1, and grey_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2. Let's revise again. We need to make sure grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2 before clearing blue_block_1.

Let's reconsider the whole plan, focusing on satisfying constraint 7 first:

1. Action: unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1
   Now we're holding green_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear, purple_block_1 still on red_block_1, red_block_1 still on blue_block_2, blue_block_2 still on blue_block_1, blue_block_1 and black_block_1 still on the table.

2. Action: stack green_block_1 black_block_1
   We place green_block_1 on black_block_1, so black_block_1 is no longer clear. grey_block_1 is clear, purple_block_1 still on red_block_1, red_block_1 still on blue_block_2, blue_block_2 still on blue_block_1, blue_block_1 still on the table.

3. Action: unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1
   Now we're holding purple_block_1 (satisfying constraint 2), red_block_1 is now clear, red_block_1 still on blue_block_2, blue_block_2 still on blue_block_1, blue_block_1 and black_block_1 still on the table, green_block_1 on black_block_1. We need to satisfy constraint 3, which says black_block_1 should not be on the table after holding purple_block_1, but we'll address this later.

4. Action: stack purple_block_1 black_block_1
   We place purple_block_1 on black_block_1 (on top of green_block_1), so green_block_1 remains not clear. red_block_1 is clear, red_block_1 still on blue_block_2, blue_block_2 still on blue_block_1, blue_block_1 still on the table.

5. Action: unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2
   Now we're holding red_block_1, blue_block_2 is now clear, blue_block_2 is still on blue_block_1, blue_block_1 still on the table, purple_block_1 on black_block_1 (and black_block_1 on the table).

6. Action: stack red_block_1 grey_block_1
   We place red_block_1 on grey_block_1, so grey_block_1 is no longer clear. blue_block_2 is clear, blue_block_2 still on blue_block_1, blue_block_1 still on the table, purple_block_1 on green_block_1, green_block_1 on black_block_1.

7. Action: unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1
   Now we're holding blue_block_2 (satisfying constraint 8), blue_block_1 is now clear. We need to satisfy constraint 9, which says black_block_1 should not be clear or not on the table after holding blue_block_2. Currently, black_block_1 is on the table and not clear (it has green_block_1, purple_block_1 on top), so that's satisfied.

8. Action: stack blue_block_2 red_block_1
   We place blue_block_2 on red_block_1, so red_block_1 is no longer clear, blue_block_1 is clear. We still need to satisfy constraint 7, which says before making blue_block_1 clear, grey_block_1 should be on top of blue_block_2. Right now, grey_block_1 is under red_block_1, and red_block_1 is under blue_block_2. This doesn't satisfy constraint 7, which requires grey_block_1 to be on top of blue_block_2.

Let's try yet again.

Hmm, we have a challenging set of constraints. Let's approach it from a different angle. Instead of trying to satisfy all the constraints in one go, let's try to think of the constraints one-by-one and see how to satisfy them all.

First, let's look at constraint 7, which effectively forces a specific sequence: "First put grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2, then make blue_block_1 clear."

So, our first objective should be to put grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2. This means we need to:
1. Clear grey_block_1 (remove green_block_1).
2. Clear the top of blue_block_2 (remove red_block_1 and everything above it).
3. Stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2.

After that, we need to remove grey_block_1 and then blue_block_2 to make blue_block_1 clear.

Let's try this approach:

1. Action: unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1
   Now we're holding green_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear, purple_block_1 still on red_block_1, red_block_1 still on blue_block_2, blue_block_2 still on blue_block_1, blue_block_1 and black_block_1 still on the table.

2. Action: stack green_block_1 black_block_1
   We place green_block_1 on black_block_1, so black_block_1 is no longer clear. grey_block_1 is clear, purple_block_1 still on red_block_1, red_block_1 still on blue_block_2, blue_block_2 still on blue_block_1, blue_block_1 still on the table.

3. Action: unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1
   Now we're holding purple_block_1 (satisfying constraint 2), red_block_1 is now clear, red_block_1 still on blue_block_2, blue_block_2 still on blue_block_1, blue_block_1 and black_block_1 still on the table, green_block_1 on black_block_1.

4. Action: stack purple_block_1 green_block_1
   We place purple_block_1 on green_block_1, so green_block_1 remains not clear. red_block_1 is clear, red_block_1 still on blue_block_2, blue_block_2 still on blue_block_1, blue_block_1 still on the table, black_block_1 and grey_block_1 are also on the table.

5. Action: unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2
   Now we're holding red_block_1, blue_block_2 is now clear, blue_block_2 is still on blue_block_1, blue_block_1 still on the table, purple_block_1 on green_block_1, green_block_1 on black_block_1.

6. Action: stack red_block_1 black_block_1
   Oops, seems like I mixed up. Black_block_1 already has green_block_1 and purple_block_1 on it.

Let me be even more careful and just trace through a simple set of steps to achieve our goal:

Initial state:
```
           purple_block_1
                 |
           red_block_1
                 |
           blue_block_2
                 |
           blue_block_1
                 
           black_block_1

           green_block_1
                 |
           grey_block_1
```

First, let's unstack green_block_1 from grey_block_1 to make grey_block_1 clear:
```
           purple_block_1
                 |
           red_block_1
                 |
           blue_block_2
                 |
           blue_block_1
                 
           black_block_1

           green_block_1 (holding)
           
           grey_block_1
```

Action: unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1

Next, we'll place green_block_1 somewhere. Let's pick black_block_1:
```
           purple_block_1
                 |
           red_block_1
                 |
           blue_block_2
                 |
           blue_block_1
                 
           green_block_1
                 |
           black_block_1

           grey_block_1
```

Action: stack green_block_1 black_block_1

Now, let's unstack purple_block_1 from red_block_1. This will satisfy constraint 2, requiring us to hold purple_block_1 at some point:
```
           purple_block_1 (holding)
                 
           red_block_1
                 |
           blue_block_2
                 |
           blue_block_1
                 
           green_block_1
                 |
           black_block_1

           grey_block_1
```

Action: unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1

Now, to satisfy constraint 3, we need to ensure black_block_1 is not on the table after holding purple_block_1. It's already not on the table (since it's under green_block_1), right? Oh wait, I've been misreading the state. Let me correct:

Initial state:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
- red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- green_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1

So, black_block_1 is on the table in the initial state, not under green_block_1. I need to be more careful.

Actually, wait. The initial state:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
- red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- green_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1

And to re-visualize this correctly:
```
         purple_block_1
               |
         red_block_1
               |
         blue_block_2
               |
         blue_block_1

         black_block_1

         green_block_1
               |
         grey_block_1
```

Now, let's execute our plan step by step:

1. Action: unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1
   Current state: We're holding green_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear, purple_block_1 is on red_block_1, red_block_1 is on blue_block_2, blue_block_2 is on blue_block_1, blue_block_1, black_block_1, and grey_block_1 are on the table.

2. Action: stack green_block_1 black_block_1
   Current state: green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear, purple_block_1 is on red_block_1, red_block_1 is on blue_block_2, blue_block_2 is on blue_block_1, blue_block_1, black_block_1, and grey_block_1 are on the table.

3. Action: unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1
   Current state: We're holding purple_block_1 (satisfying constraint 2), red_block_1 is clear, red_block_1 is on blue_block_2, blue_block_2 is on blue_block_1, blue_block_1, black_block_1, and grey_block_1 are on the table, green_block_1 is on black_block_1.

4. Action: stack purple_block_1 green_block_1
   Current state: purple_block_1 is on top of green_block_1, green_block_1 is on black_block_1, red_block_1 is clear, red_block_1 is on blue_block_2, blue_block_2 is on blue_block_1, blue_block_1, black_block_1, and grey_block_1 are on the table.

Now, constraint to satisfy:
1. The first state after "holding purple_block_1" where black_block_1 is not on the table.

Currently, black_block_1 is on the table. We need to pick it up, but it has green_block_1 and purple_block_1 on top. We'll come back to this constraint.

5. Action: unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2
   Current state: We're holding red_block_1, blue_block_2 is clear, blue_block_2 is on blue_block_1, blue_block_1, black_block_1, and grey_block_1 are on the table, purple_block_1 is on green_block_1, green_block_1 is on black_block_1.

6. Action: stack red_block_1 grey_block_1
   Current state: red_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1, blue_block_2 is clear, blue_block_2 is on blue_block_1, blue_block_1, black_block_1, and grey_block_1 are on the table, purple_block_1 is on green_block_1, green_block_1 is on black_block_1.

7. Action: pickup grey_block_1
   No, we can't pick up grey_block_1 because it now has red_block_1 on top. Let's revise.

7. Action: unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1
   Current state: We're holding blue_block_2 (satisfying constraint 8), blue_block_1 is clear, blue_block_1, black_block_1, and grey_block_1 are on the table, purple_block_1 is on green_block_1, green_block_1 is on black_block_1, red_block_1 is on grey_block_1.

Now, we need to satisfy constraint 9, which says "black_block_1 is not clear OR black_block_1 is not on the table." Currently, black_block_1 is on the table but not clear (it has green_block_1 and purple_block_1 on top), so that's already satisfied.

8. Action: unstack red_block_1 grey_block_1
   Oops, we can't do that yet because we're still holding blue_block_2.

8. Action: stack blue_block_2 red_block_1
   Current state: blue_block_2 is on top of red_block_1, red_block_1 is on grey_block_1, blue_block_1 is clear, blue_block_1, black_block_1, and grey_block_1 are on the table, purple_block_1 is on green_block_1, green_block_1 is on black_block_1.

Per constraint 7, before blue_block_1 is clear, grey_block_1 must be on top of blue_block_2 at some point. Right now, grey_block_1 is under red_block_1 and blue_block_2. So, we need to unstack both blue_block_2 and red_block_1, then stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2 to satisfy constraint 7. (Hmm, the constraint says "an ealier state", which means grey_block_1 could have been on top of blue_block_2 before blue_block_1 became clear. But right now, blue_block_1 is already clear, so we might already be violating the constraint. Since it might be too late, let's continue building the plan and see if we can come up with a solution that satisfies all constraints.)

9. Action: unstack blue_block_2 red_block_1
   Current state: We're holding blue_block_2, red_block_1 is clear, red_block_1 is on grey_block_1, blue_block_1 is clear, blue_block_1, black_block_1, and grey_block_1 are on the table, purple_block_1 is on green_block_1, green_block_1 is on black_block_1.

10. Action: stack blue_block_2 blue_block_1
    Current state: blue_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1 again, red_block_1 is on grey_block_1, blue_block_1, black_block_1, and grey_block_1 are on the table, purple_block_1 is on green_block_1, green_block_1 is on black_block_1.

Oh dear, we're getting in a cyclic pattern and still not addressing constraint 7. Let's take a step back and think more carefully.

It seems the fundamental issue lies with constraint 7, which requires grey_block_1 to be on top of blue_block_2 before blue_block_1 becomes clear. But blue_block_1 is already clear in our plan (step 7). This implies that I've been misinterpreting the constraints.

Let's revisit the constraints once again and think more carefully.

Actually, I think I've been overly strict with the constraints. Constraint 7 does not say "before blue_block_1 is clear, grey_block_1 must be on top of blue_block_2." Instead, it says "if blue_block_1 is clear, there must be an earlier state in which grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2."

Given that, we need to make sure grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2 at some state before blue_block_1 becomes clear. Let's revise our plan.

From the beginning:

1. Action: unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1
   Current state: We're holding green_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear, purple_block_1 is on red_block_1, red_block_1 is on blue_block_2, blue_block_2 is on blue_block_1, blue_block_1, black_block_1, and grey_block_1 are on the table.

2. Action: stack green_block_1 black_block_1
   Current state: green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear, purple_block_1 is on red_block_1, red_block_1 is on blue_block_2, blue_block_2 is on blue_block_1, blue_block_1, black_block_1, and grey_block_1 are on the table.

3. Action: unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1
   Current state: We're holding purple_block_1 (satisfying constraint 2), red_block_1 is clear, red_block_1 is on blue_block_2, blue_block_2 is on blue_block_1, blue_block_1, black_block_1, and grey_block_1 are on the table, green_block_1 is on black_block_1.

4. Action: stack purple_block_1 green_block_1
   Current state: purple_block_1 is on top of green_block_1, green_block_1 is on black_block_1, red_block_1 is clear, red_block_1 is on blue_block_2, blue_block_2 is on blue_block_1, blue_block_1, black_block_1, and grey_block_1 are on the table.

5. Action: unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2
   Current state: We're holding red_block_1, blue_block_2 is clear, blue_block_2 is on blue_block_1, blue_block_1, black_block_1, and grey_block_1 are on the table, purple_block_1 is on green_block_1, green_block_1 is on black_block_1.

6. Action: stack red_block_1 black_block_1
   Oops that's problematic because black_block_1 already has green_block_1 and purple_block_1 on top.

Actually, I think I'm losing track of the state of the world at each step. Let me go back to the initial state and just focus on the goal and a simplified approach.

Initial state:
```
         purple_block_1
               |
         red_block_1
               |
         blue_block_2
               |
         blue_block_1

         black_block_1

         green_block_1
               |
         grey_block_1
```

Here's my plan without considering the constraints for now:

1. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1
2. stack purple_block_1 [some other block, maybe black_block_1]
3. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2
4. stack red_block_1 [some other block, maybe green_block_1]
5. unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1
6. stack blue_block_2 [some other block]
7. pickup blue_block_1
8. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1

For this to work with all constraints, we need to ensure:

- purple_block_1 is never on the table (constraint 1).
- we hold purple_block_1 at some point (constraint 2).
- after holding purple_block_1, at some later state, black_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 3).
- blue_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 at some point (constraint 4).
- blue_block_2 is never on the table (constraint 5).
- blue_block_1 is clear at some point (constraint 6).
- before blue_block_1 becomes clear, grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2 at some point (constraint 7).
- we hold blue_block_2 at some point (constraint 8).
- after holding blue_block_2, at some later state, black_block_1 is not clear or not on the table (constraint 9).
- red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2 at some point (constraint 10).
- after red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2, at some later state, grey_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 or grey_block_1 is clear (constraint 11).

Actually, I'm getting confused by all the constraints because we can't know if we've truly satisfied them until the end of the plan. Let's try a different approach.

Let's first create a rough outline of our plan, and then try to fit in the constraints.

1. To make blue_block_1 clear, we need to remove everything on top of it (blue_block_2, red_block_1, purple_block_1).
2. Due to constraint 7, Before blue_block_1 becomes clear, grey_block_1 must be on top of blue_block_2 at some point. However, this is a little tricky because grey_block_1 currently has green_block_1 on top, and blue_block_2 has red_block_1 and purple_block_1 on top.
3. We need to clear grey_block_1, clear blue_block_2, and then stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2 before we can make blue_block_1 clear.
4. After we can clear blue_block_1, we need to stack it on top of green_block_1 at some point (constraint 4).
5. And the ultimate goal is to have blue_block_1 on top of purple_block_1.

Let's map out this plan:

1. unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1 (to clear grey_block_1)
2. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1 (to start clearing blue_block_2)
3. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2 (to clear blue_block_2)
4. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2 (to satisfy constraint 7)
5. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_2 (to clear blue_block_2 again)
6. unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1 (to clear blue_block_1)
7. stack blue_block_1 green_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 4)
8. unstack blue_block_1 green_block_1 (to free blue_block_1 for the goal)
9. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1 (to achieve the goal)

Now, let's check if this plan satisfies all constraints and if there are other constraints that we haven't addressed yet.

Checking constraints:

- Constraint 1: "purple_block_1 is not on the table" (must hold in every state). In the initial state, purple_block_1 is on top of red_block_1. After step 2, we've removed it, but we still need to ensure it never goes on the table.
- Constraint 2: "you are holding purple_block_1" (must hold in at least one state). This is satisfied in step 2.
- Constraint 3: "After holding purple_block_1, black_block_1 is not on the table at some point". But black_block_1 is on the table in the initial state. We need to pick up black_block_1 at some point.
- Constraint 4: "blue_block_1 is on top of green_block_1" (must hold in at least one state). This is satisfied in step 7.
- Constraint 5: "blue_block_2 is not on the table" (must hold in every state). In the initial state, blue_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1, so it's not on the table. After step 6, we've removed it, but we need to ensure it never goes on the table.
- Constraint 6: "blue_block_1 is clear" (must hold in at least one state). This is satisfied in step 6.
- Constraint 7: "Before blue_block_1 is clear, grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2 at some point". This is satisfied in step 4.
- Constraint 8: "you are holding blue_block_2" (must hold in at least one state). This is satisfied in step 6.
- Constraint 9: "After holding blue_block_2, black_block_1 is not clear or not on the table at some point". We still need to ensure this.
- Constraint 10: "red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2" (must hold in at least one state). This is already satisfied in the initial state.
- Constraint 11: "After red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2, at some later state, grey_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 or grey_block_1 is clear". In the initial state, red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2, but grey_block_1 has green_block_1 on top, so it's not clear. We satisfy this constraint in step 1 when we make grey_block_1 clear.

It looks like we still need to address constraints 3 and 9.

For constraint 3, after holding purple_block_1, black_block_1 should not be on the table at some point. But the plan doesn't address this.

For constraint 9, after holding blue_block_2, black_block_1 should not be clear or not on the table at some point. But the plan doesn't address this.

Let's revise the plan to address these constraints.

1. unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1 (to clear grey_block_1) - This satisfies constraint 11.
2. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1 (to start clearing blue_block_2) - This satisfies constraint 2.
3. stack purple_block_1 black_block_1 (ensuring black_block_1 is not clear for constraint 9).
4. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2 (to clear blue_block_2)
5. stack red_block_1 black_block_1 (further ensuring black_block_1 is not clear).
6. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2 (to satisfy constraint 7).
7. pickup black_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 3). But wait, we can't pick up black_block_1 since it has purple_block_1 and red_block_1 on it.

OK let me just try a plan.

Given the initial state:
```
        purple_block_1
              |
        red_block_1
              |
        blue_block_2
              |
        blue_block_1

        black_block_1

        green_block_1
              |
        grey_block_1
```

1. unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1 (to clear grey_block_1, satisfying constraint 11).
2. stack green_block_1 black_block_1 (to have a place to put green_block_1).
3. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 2).
4. stack purple_block_1 black_block_1 (to ensure it's not on the table, satisfying constraint 1).
5. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2 (to clear blue_block_2).
6. stack red_block_1 black_block_1 (to have a place to put red_block_1).
7. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2 (to satisfy constraint 7).
8. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_2 (to free blue_block_2).
9. stack grey_block_1 black_block_1 (to have a place to put grey_block_1).
10. unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1 (to clear blue_block_1 and satisfy constraint 8).
11. stack blue_block_2 black_block_1 (to ensure it's not on the table, satisfying constraint 5 and also making black_block_1 not clear for constraint 9).
12. pickup blue_block_1 (to prepare for the next steps).
13. stack blue_block_1 green_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 4).
14. unstack blue_block_1 green_block_1 (to free blue_block_1).
15. unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1 (to have other blocks reachable).
16. stack grey_block_1 green_block_1 (to have a place to put grey_block_1).
17. unstack purple_block_1 black_block_1 (to prepare for the goal).
18. unstack blue_block_2 black_block_1 (to free black_block_1).
19. stack blue_block_2 grey_block_1 (to have a place to put blue_block_2).
20. pickup black_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 3).
21. putdown black_block_1 (to have a place for it).
22. pickup blue_block_1 (to prepare for the goal).
23. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1 (to achieve the goal).

I'm not sure this works yet, it's complex and probably sub-optimal. Let me try making a much more simple plan for the goal.

1. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1
2. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2
3. unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1
4. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1

This plan achieves the goal but it doesn't satisfy the constraints. Now, let's consider the constraints.

1. "purple_block_1 is not on the table" (must hold in every state). After step 1, we need to ensure purple_block_1 never goes on the table.
2. "you are holding purple_block_1" (must hold in at least one state). This is satisfied in step 1.
3. "After holding purple_block_1, black_block_1 is not on the table at some point". After step 1, we need to pick up black_block_1 at some point.
4. "blue_block_1 is on top of green_block_1" (must hold in at least one state). We need to add a step to put blue_block_1 on green_block_1 at some point.
5. "blue_block_2 is not on the table" (must hold in every state). After step 3, we need to ensure blue_block_2 never goes on the table.
6. "blue_block_1 is clear" (must hold in at least one state). This is satisfied in step 3.
7. "Before blue_block_1 is clear, grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2 at some point". Before step 3, we need to have grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2.
8. "you are holding blue_block_2" (must hold in at least one state). This is satisfied in step 3.
9. "After holding blue_block_2, black_block_1 is not clear or not on the table at some point". After step 3, we need to ensure black_block_1 is not clear or not on the table.
10. "red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2" (must hold in at least one state). This is satisfied in the initial state.
11. "After red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2, at some later state, grey_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 or grey_block_1 is clear". After the initial state, we need to ensure grey_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 or grey_block_1 is clear.

Let's try to integrate these constraints into the plan.

Actually, I'm going to try a different approach, I'll make a plan and then check all the constraints at each step.

1. unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1
   
   Current state:
   - We're holding green_block_1.

   - C1: purple_block_1 is not on the table - Satisfied.
   - C5: blue_block_2 is not on the table - Satisfied.
   - C11: After red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2, grey_block_1 is clear - This is no longer satisfied because we've put red_block_1 on grey_block_1, making it not clear. But constraint 11 only requires that grey_block_1 is clear at some state after red_block_1 is on blue_block_2, and we've already satisfied that.

Now, we need to address constraint 7 before we can make blue_block_1 clear:

7. unstack red_block_1 grey_block_1
   
   Current state:
   - We're holding red_block_1.
   - grey_block_1 is clear.
   - blue_block_2 is clear.
   - blue_block_2 is on blue_block_1.
   - blue_block_1, black_block_1, and grey_block_1 are on the table.
   - purple_block_1 is on green_block_1.
   - green_block_1 is on black_block_1.

8. stack red_block_1 blue_block_2
   
   Current state:
   - red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2.
   - grey_block_1 is clear.
   - blue_block_2 is on blue_block_1.
   - blue_block_1, black_block_1, and grey_block_1 are on the table.
   - purple_block_1 is on green_block_1.
   - green_block_1 is on black_block_1.

9. stack grey_block_1 red_block_1
   
   Current state:
   - grey_block_1 is on top of red_block_1.
   - red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2.
   - blue_block_2 is on blue_block_1.
   - blue_block_1, black_block_1 are on the table.
   - purple_block_1 is on green_block_1.
   - green_block_1 is on black_block_1.

   Checking constraint 7: We're about to make blue_block_1 clear (by unstacking blue_block_2), but before that, grey_block_1 must be on top of blue_block_2 at some point. In this state, grey_block_1 is above blue_block_2, but not directly on top of it (it's on top of red_block_1). So it's better to unstack everything and stack grey_block_1 directly on blue_block_2:

10. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1
11. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2
12. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2 (this satisfies constraint 7)
13. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_2
14. unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1 (this satisfies constraints 6 and 8)

OK will my reasoning so far create a plan that satisfies all constraints. Let me retract to step 5 and try again.

5. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2
6. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1
7. pickup blue_block_2 (this satisfies constraint 8)
8. stack blue_block_2 red_block_1

In this state:
   - blue_block_2 is on top of red_block_1.
   - red_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1.
   - blue_block_1 is clear (this satisfies constraint 6).
   - blue_block_1, black_block_1, and grey_block_1 are on the table.
   - purple_block_1 is on green_block_1.
   - green_block_1 is on black_block_1.

But constraint 7 is missed: blue_block_1 is clear, but grey_block_1 was never on top of blue_block_2.

Actually, I see my problem: step 7 should have been:

7. unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1

OK, so far:

1. unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1
2. stack green_block_1 black_block_1
3. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1
4. stack purple_block_1 green_block_1
5. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2
6. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1
7. unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1

Current state:
   - We're holding blue_block_2 (this satisfies constraint 8).
   - blue_block_1 is clear (this satisfies constraint 6).
   - red_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1.
   - blue_block_1, black_block_1, and grey_block_1 are on the table.
   - purple_block_1 is on green_block_1.
   - green_block_1 is on black_block_1.

But we missed constraint 7 because grey_block_1 was never on top of blue_block_2.

Let's resubmit the plan, one more time.

1. unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1
2. stack green_block_1 black_block_1
3. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1
4. stack purple_block_1 green_block_1
5. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2
6. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1
7. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2
8. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_2
9. unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1
10. pickup blue_block_1
11. stack blue_block_1 green_block_1
12. unstack blue_block_1 green_block_1
13. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1
