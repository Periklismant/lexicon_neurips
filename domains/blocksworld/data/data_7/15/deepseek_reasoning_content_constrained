Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld problem. Hmm, the initial state is a bit complex. Let me first visualize it. 

Starting from the table, blue_block_1 is on the table with blue_block_2 on top of it, then red_block_1 on blue_block_2, and purple_block_1 on red_block_1. So the stack is blue_block_1 (table), blue_block_2, red_block_1, purple_block_1. Then there's black_block_1 alone on the table. Grey_block_1 is on the table with green_block_1 on top. So another stack: grey_block_1 (table), green_block_1. All the top blocks (purple, green, black) are clear. The goal is to have blue_block_1 on top of purple_block_1. 

Constraints are a lot. Let's list them:

1. Purple_block_1 must never be on the table. So we can't put it down once it's moved.
2. Must hold purple_block_1 at least once.
3. If we hold purple_block_1, then at that state or later, black_block_1 isn't on the table.
4. Blue_block_1 must be on green_block_1 at some state.
5. Blue_block_2 must never be on the table. So any movement of blue_block_2 must be stacking onto another block.
6. Blue_block_1 must be clear at least once.
7. When blue_block_1 is clear, there must have been a previous state where grey_block_1 was on blue_block_2.
8. Must hold blue_block_2 at least once.
9. When holding blue_block_2, either black_block_1 has a block on it or isn't on the table, either in that state or later.
10. Red_block_1 must be on blue_block_2 at some state.
11. When red_block_1 is on blue_block_2, then either grey_block_1 is on red_block_1 or grey_block_1 is clear, in that state or later.

Alright, let's start planning. The main goal is to get blue_block_1 on purple_block_1. Since purple is initially on red_block_1, which is on blue_block_2, which is on blue_block_1. So to get blue_block_1 on purple, we need to move purple to somewhere first. But purple can't be on the table (constraint 1), so it must stay on another block. Wait, but the goal is blue_block_1 on purple. So we need to have purple_block_1 somewhere else, then place blue_block_1 on top. 

But let's think step by step. Let's first figure out how to get purple_block_1 into a position where blue_block_1 can be stacked on it. Since purple is currently on red_block_1, we need to unstack purple from red. But before that, we need to unstack red from blue_block_2, but red is under purple. Wait, the initial stack is blue_block_1 (table) -> blue_block_2 -> red_block_1 -> purple_block_1. So to get purple, we need to unstack purple from red (since it's the top). But to do that, the arm needs to be empty. So first, unstack purple from red. Then put purple somewhere. But can't put it on the table. So we need to stack it on another block. But where?

Alternatively, maybe we can move purple and then later place blue_block_1 on it. Let's think.

But also, the constraints come into play. Let's check them as we go.

Constraint 2: must hold purple at least once. So we need to do an unstack purple from red. That will satisfy holding purple once. Then, when we hold purple, constraint 3 says that in that state or later, black_block_1 is not on the table. So either during holding purple or after, we need to move black_block_1 off the table. So maybe after picking up purple, we need to stack it somewhere, then handle black_block_1. But how?

Another constraint is that blue_block_1 must be on green_block_1 at some point. Green is on grey, which is on the table. So to get blue_block_1 on green, we need to move green first. Wait, green is on grey. So maybe unstack green from grey, then stack blue_block_1 on green. But blue_block_1 is under a stack. So first, we need to clear blue_block_1. But blue_block_1 has blue_block_2 on it. To clear blue_block_1, we need to move blue_block_2. But blue_block_2 can't be placed on the table (constraint 5). So blue_block_2 must be stacked somewhere else. Where? Let's see. Initially, blue_block_2 is under red_block_1. So perhaps move red and purple first.

But let's outline the steps:

Goal: blue_block_1 on purple_block_1.

Current: purple is on red, which is on blue_block_2, which is on blue_block_1. So to get blue_block_1 on purple, we need to have purple on some block, then stack blue_block_1 onto it. Since purple can't be on the table, it must be on another block. Maybe move purple to black_block_1? But black is initially on the table. But if we stack purple on black, that would take black off the table (since it's under purple?), no. Wait, stacking purple on black would mean black remains on the table, with purple on top. So that's allowed. Then, blue_block_1 can be stacked on purple. But we need to make sure that when we hold purple (to stack it on black), constraint 3 requires that after that, black_block_1 is not on the table. Wait, but if we stack purple on black, then black is still on the table. That's a problem because constraint 3 says that if we hold purple, then in that state or after, black_block_1 is not on the table. So stacking purple on black would leave black on the table, which violates constraint 3. Because after holding purple (during stacking it on black), black is still on the table, which would mean we have to move black later. So perhaps we need to move black_block_1 off the table before or after stacking purple on it.

Alternatively, maybe stack purple on some other block. Let's see. What other blocks are there? Grey_block_1 is on the table with green on top. So grey is on table, green on grey. Maybe we can stack purple on green? But green is clear. So unstack green from grey, then stack purple on green. Then green is under purple. Then blue_block_1 can be stacked on purple. But we need to check if that's possible.

But let's think step by step. Let's try to outline the steps required.

First, to get purple_block_1, we need to unstack it from red_block_1. Since purple is clear, we can do that. So:

1. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1. Now holding purple.

This satisfies constraint 2 (hold purple at least once). Then, we need to stack purple somewhere. Since constraint 1 says purple can't be on the table. So stack it on a block. But where? Let's think. If we stack it on black_block_1, then black is on the table. But then, constraint 3 requires that after holding purple, black must not be on the table. So after stacking purple on black, we need to move black. But black is under purple. To move black, we need to unstack purple first. But that would require holding purple again, which might not be allowed. Alternatively, perhaps stack purple on green_block_1. But green is on grey. So if we stack purple on green, then the stack is grey, green, purple. Then, we can later place blue_block_1 on purple. But then, the constraint about blue_block_1 on green_block_1 (constraint 4) must be satisfied. So maybe during the process, we need to have blue_block_1 on green_block_1. Let's see.

But perhaps another approach. Let's look at all the constraints and see which ones are required to be triggered during the plan.

Constraint 4: blue_block_1 on green_block_1 at least once. So at some point, we need to stack blue_block_1 onto green. But blue_block_1 is currently under blue_block_2, which is under red, which is under purple. So we need to clear blue_block_1. To do that, we need to move blue_block_2. But blue_block_2 can't be placed on the table (constraint 5). So we need to stack blue_block_2 onto another block. Where? Maybe onto black_block_1. Let's see.

But let's proceed step by step. Let's try to achieve the main goal first, then check the constraints.

Main goal: blue_block_1 on purple_block_1.

Current structure:

blue_block_1 (table)
  blue_block_2
    red_block_1
      purple_block_1

Other blocks:

black_block_1 (table, clear)
grey_block_1 (table)
  green_block_1 (clear)

To get blue_block_1 onto purple, we need to have purple on a block, then blue_block_1 on top of that. So first, we need to move purple to a position where it's on a block (not table), and then move blue_block_1 there.

But how to move blue_block_1? Since blue_block_1 is under a stack, we need to disassemble that stack. Let's start by removing the blocks above blue_block_1.

The current stack on blue_block_1 is blue_block_2, red_block_1, purple_block_1. So to clear blue_block_1, we need to unstack blue_block_2 from it. But blue_block_2 is under red and purple. So we need to unstack purple, then red, then blue_block_2. But blue_block_2 can't be put on the table (constraint 5). So after unstacking purple and red, we need to stack them elsewhere.

Wait, let's see. Let's unstack purple from red. Then put purple on another block. Then unstack red from blue_block_2. Then put red somewhere. Then unstack blue_block_2 from blue_block_1. But blue_block_2 can't be placed on the table, so we need to stack it on another block. Let's see.

But this seems complicated. Let's consider the constraints again. Let's list the constraints and see which ones need to be addressed early.

Constraint 6: blue_block_1 must be clear at least once. So during the process of moving blocks off blue_block_1, when blue_block_2 is removed, blue_block_1 becomes clear. But blue_block_2 is on blue_block_1, so to clear blue_block_1, we need to move blue_block_2. But to move blue_block_2, we need to first move the blocks above it (red and purple). 

So steps:

1. Unstack purple_block_1 from red_block_1. Now holding purple.

This satisfies constraint 2 (hold purple). Then, we need to stack purple somewhere. Let's choose to stack it on black_block_1. So:

2. stack purple_block_1 black_block_1. Now purple is on black, black is on table. But constraint 3 says that when we hold purple (which we did in step 1), then in that state or after, black_block_1 must not be on the table. But after stacking purple on black, black is still on the table. So this violates constraint 3. Therefore, we need to ensure that after holding purple, black is not on the table. Therefore, we need to move black off the table either before or after stacking purple on it. But how? Since we have to stack purple on some block, perhaps stack purple on black, then move black elsewhere. But black is under purple. To move black, we need to unstack purple first, but that would require holding it again. Alternatively, stack purple on another block where we can then move black.

Alternatively, maybe stack purple on grey_block_1 or green_block_1. Let's consider stacking purple on green_block_1. Green is on grey. So:

After unstacking purple (step 1), stack purple on green (step 2). Then, green is under purple, which is on green. But we need to make sure that the stack is allowed. Then, later, when we need to move blue_block_1 onto purple, we can do that. But let's proceed.

But after stacking purple on green, purple is on green. Then, to get blue_block_1 on purple, we need to have blue_block_1 clear. So we need to move blue_block_2, red, etc. But let's proceed.

But also, constraint 7 says that when blue_block_1 is clear, there must be a previous state where grey_block_1 was on blue_block_2. So at some point, we need to have grey_block_1 on blue_block_2. Currently, grey is on table. So perhaps during the process, stack grey on blue_block_2. Let's see.

Constraint 8: must hold blue_block_2 at least once. So we need to unstack blue_block_2 from blue_block_1 at some point. But since blue_block_2 is under red and purple, we need to first remove those. So steps:

After moving purple and red, we can unstack blue_block_2.

But let's go back. Let's try to process the steps.

1. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1 → holding purple.

Now, need to stack it. Let's choose to stack it on green_block_1. So:

2. stack purple_block_1 green_block_1 → purple on green. Now, green is under purple. Green was on grey, so grey is still on the table. Now, purple is on green, which is on grey. So the stack is grey, green, purple.

Now, moving on. Next, we need to unstack red_block_1 from blue_block_2. But after step 1, red_block_1 is now clear (since we removed purple). So:

3. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2 → holding red.

But where to put red? We can't put it on the table if possible, but maybe stack it on another block. Let's stack it on black_block_1 (which is on the table). So:

4. stack red_block_1 black_block_1 → red on black. Now, black is on table with red on top.

But this might interfere with constraint 3, which says that after holding purple (step 1), black must not be on the table. But in step 4, we stacked red on black. So black is still on the table. Thus, this violates constraint 3. Therefore, we need to ensure that after holding purple, black is not on the table. So in this approach, stacking purple on green, then stacking red on black doesn't resolve the black on table issue. So maybe we need to find another way.

Alternative plan: After holding purple (step 1), stack it on black (step 2), then move black off the table. But how? Black is under purple. To move black, we need to unstack purple. But to do that, we need to hold purple again. But if we stack purple on black, then black is under purple, and to move black, we need to unstack purple first. So:

1. unstack purple from red → holding purple.
2. stack purple on black → purple on black (black still on table).
3. Now, to move black, we need to unstack purple again. So:
   unstack purple from black → holding purple.
4. stack purple somewhere else (maybe grey or another block).
5. Then, pickup black and put it somewhere else. But black is on table. So pickup black (needs to be clear). But after step 2, black has purple on top. So we can't pick up black unless we first unstack purple. So steps 3 and 4 would be needed.

But this approach is getting complicated and time-consuming. Maybe there's a better way. Let's think of another approach.

Alternative idea: After holding purple (step 1), instead of stacking it on a block that's on the table, stack it on a block that's not on the table. For example, stack purple on grey_block_1. But grey is on the table. Wait, no. If we stack purple on grey, then grey is on the table. So stacking purple on grey would leave purple on grey (which is on the table), but purple can't be on the table. Wait, no. The constraint is that purple_block_1 must never be on the table. So as long as purple is stacked on another block (even if that block is on the table), it's okay. Because the table is only for blocks directly on it. So if purple is on grey, which is on the table, then purple is not on the table. So that's allowed. So stacking purple on grey would be acceptable. Then, after that, grey is on table, purple is on grey. But then, maybe we can use this to satisfy other constraints.

So:

1. unstack purple from red → holding purple.
2. stack purple on grey → purple on grey. Now, grey is on table with purple on top. Green is on grey as well? Wait, initial state is grey on table with green on top. So in the initial state, green is on grey. So if we stack purple on grey, we can't because grey is not clear (green is on it). Oh right! Initially, green is on grey. So we can't stack purple on grey unless we move green first. So to stack purple on grey, we need to unstack green from grey first. Let's adjust:

First, unstack green from grey.

0. unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1 → holding green.
1. putdown green_block_1 → green on table. Now, grey is clear.
2. Then proceed to unstack purple from red → holding purple.
3. stack purple on grey → purple on grey. Now, grey has purple on top. This is allowed, as purple is not on the table. Then, we can move green back if needed.

But this introduces more steps. Let's see if this works with the constraints.

Now, after stacking purple on grey, we can move on. But we need to satisfy constraint 3: after holding purple (step 2), black_block_1 must not be on the table. So we need to move black off the table at some point after step 2. How? Black is on the table. We can stack something on it, but that would keep it on the table. Alternatively, pick up black and stack it on another block. Let's try:

4. pickup black_block_1 → but black is clear (initially), so this is possible. Then stack it on some block. Maybe stack on green_block_1 (which is now on the table after step 1 putdown). So:

5. stack black_block_1 green_block_1 → black on green. Now, green is on table with black on top. This moves black off the table (since it's on green), satisfying constraint 3. So in step 4 and 5, we moved black off the table.

But this adds steps, but maybe it's necessary. Let's check the constraints.

Now, let's track the steps so far:

0. unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1 (holding green)
1. putdown green_block_1 (green on table, grey clear)
2. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1 (holding purple)
3. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1 (purple on grey, grey on table)
4. pickup black_block_1 (holding black)
5. stack black_block_1 green_block_1 (black on green, green on table)
6. Now, we need to proceed to clear blue_block_1. The original stack was blue_block_1 -> blue_block_2 -> red_block_1 (now on black), but wait, red was moved in step 4? No. Wait, after step 2, we unstck purple from red, then stacked purple on grey. Then we moved black. So the red_block_1 is still on blue_block_2. So to clear blue_block_1, we need to remove blue_block_2. But blue_block_2 is under red_block_1. So we need to unstack red from blue_block_2. But red is currently under black (no, wait, after step 5, black is on green. So red is still on blue_block_2? Let me check.

Wait, initial steps after step 0-5:

After step 0: green is held.
Step 1: green is put down on table.
Step 2: unstack purple from red. So red is now clear (nothing on top). 
Step 3: stack purple on grey. So purple is on grey.
Step 4: pickup black (clear initially).
Step 5: stack black on green (green on table).

So the current state:

- blue_block_1 on table with blue_block_2 on it, red_block_1 on blue_block_2 (since we only removed purple from red, red is still on blue_block_2). 
- grey_block_1 on table with purple on it.
- green_block_1 on table with black on it.
- purple on grey.
- black on green.
- red on blue_block_2.

So now, to clear blue_block_1, we need to remove blue_block_2. To remove blue_block_2, we need to unstack red_block_1 from it. But red is on blue_block_2 and is clear (since we removed purple). So:

6. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2 → holding red.
7. stack red_block_1 somewhere. Let's say stack it on black_block_1 (which is on green). So:

7. stack red_block_1 black_block_1 → red on black. Now, black is on green, red on black. This makes a tower of green -> black -> red.

Now, blue_block_2 is clear. So we can unstack it from blue_block_1. But we need to hold nothing. So:

8. unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1 → holding blue_block_2. This satisfies constraint 8 (hold blue_block_2 at least once).

Now, we need to stack blue_block_2 somewhere. Since it can't go on the table (constraint 5), we have to stack it on another block. Let's choose to stack it on grey_block_1 (which has purple on it). Wait, no. The block must be clear. So grey has purple on it. So can't stack on purple. Alternatively, stack on black_block_1, which has red on top. No, black has red. So can't stack there. Maybe stack on green_block_1, which has black and red. Not clear. Hmm. Alternative: stack blue_block_2 on purple_block_1, which is on grey. But purple is clear? No, after step 3, purple is on grey. If nothing is on purple, then we can stack blue_block_2 on purple. Let's check.

Current state after step 7:

- purple is on grey, and clear (since nothing is stacked on it after step 3).

So yes. So step 8: unstack blue_block_2 from blue_block_1 → holding blue_block_2.

9. stack blue_block_2 purple_block_1 → blue_block_2 on purple. Now, blue_block_2 is on purple, which is on grey. This is allowed.

Now, blue_block_1 is clear (since blue_block_2 is removed). This satisfies constraint 6 (blue_block_1 is clear at least once). But constraint 7 says that when blue_block_1 is clear, there must have been a previous state where grey_block_1 was on blue_block_2. Wait, in our steps, when was grey on blue_block_2? It seems we haven't done that yet. So this violates constraint 7. Because after step 9, blue_block_1 is clear, but we never had grey_block_1 on blue_block_2. So we need to insert a step where grey is stacked on blue_block_2 before blue_block_1 becomes clear.

This complicates things. So, to satisfy constraint 7, we need to ensure that before blue_block_1 is clear (which happens when blue_block_2 is removed), there was a state where grey_block_1 is on blue_block_2.

So how can we do that? Let's think. We need to stack grey_block_1 onto blue_block_2 at some point before step 8 (when we unstack blue_block_2 from blue_block_1). But grey is on the table with purple on it (after step 3). So we can't stack grey on blue_block_2 unless we first clear grey. To clear grey, we need to remove purple. But purple is stacked on grey. So:

At some point before step 8, we need to unstack purple from grey and put it elsewhere, then stack grey on blue_block_2.

But this adds more steps. Let's see. For example:

After step 3 (stack purple on grey), we need to move purple again to stack grey on blue_block_2.

Let me try inserting steps here.

After step 3: stack purple on grey.

Then:

4. unstack purple_block_1 grey_block_1 → holding purple again.

But this requires that purple is clear (which it is after step 3). Then:

5. putdown purple_block_1 → but this violates constraint 1 (purple can't be on table). So can't do that. So instead, stack purple on another block.

But which block? Let's see. Available blocks: green is on table (from step 1). So stack purple on green:

5. stack purple_block_1 green_block_1 → purple on green.

Now, green is on table with purple on it. Then:

6. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2 → grey on blue_block_2. But to do this, we need to pickup grey. But grey is on the table and clear (since we moved purple off it in step 4). So:

6. pickup grey_block_1 → holding grey.
7. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2 → grey on blue_block_2.

This satisfies the condition for constraint 7: grey was on blue_block_2. Then later, when blue_block_1 becomes clear (after unstacking blue_block_2), that state will have had a previous state where grey was on blue_block_2.

But this adds steps. Let's see how this fits into the overall plan.

But this seems getting too long. Maybe there's a more optimal way. Let's re-examine the constraints and see which ones are interdependent.

Another approach: Since we need to have grey_block_1 on blue_block_2 at some point before blue_block_1 is clear, let's plan to stack grey on blue_block_2 before moving blue_block_2.

So steps:

After moving purple and red:

1. unstack purple from red → holding purple.
2. stack purple on green → purple on green (green is on table from previous steps).
3. unstack green_block_1 from grey_block_1 → but green is under purple. So we can't unstack green unless we first unstack purple. Wait, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, after step 1 (unstack purple from red), stack purple on black_block_1. Then, stack black_block_1 on another block to get it off the table. But this requires more steps.

Alternatively, let's try to satisfy all constraints step by step.

Let's list all the constraints again and see which ones are not yet covered.

- Constraint 4: blue_block_1 must be on green_block_1 at least once. So we need to stack blue_block_1 on green_block_1. But blue_block_1 is under blue_block_2. So we need to move blue_block_2 first.

- Constraint 10: red_block_1 must be on blue_block_2 at least once. Initially, red is on blue_block_2, but we moved it when we unstacked purple and red. So we need to have red on blue_block_2 again at some point. But after moving red, how to get it back?

- Constraint 11: when red is on blue_block_2, either grey is on red or grey is clear. So if we have red on blue_block_2 again, we need to ensure that grey is either on red or clear.

This is getting really complex. Maybe the optimal plan requires careful ordering to satisfy all constraints without redundant steps.

Let me try to outline the steps again, considering all constraints:

Main goal: blue_block_1 on purple_block_1.

Constraints to satisfy:

1. Purple never on table.
2. Hold purple once.
3. If held purple, then black not on table in that state or later.
4. Blue_block_1 on green once.
5. Blue_block_2 never on table.
6. Blue_block_1 clear once.
7. When blue_block_1 clear, prior state grey on blue_block_2.
8. Hold blue_block_2 once.
9. When holding blue_block_2, black not on table or has block on top.
10. Red on blue_block_2 once.
11. When red on blue_block_2, grey on red or grey clear.

Steps:

1. Unstack purple from red (satisfies constraint 2).
   Now holding purple. Must ensure black is not on table later.

2. Stack purple on black_block_1. Now purple is on black. Black is on table. But this violates constraint 3 because after holding purple (step 1), black must not be on table in some subsequent state. So we need to move black off the table. To do that:

3. Unstack purple from black (requires holding purple again).
   But this step would mean we're holding purple again. But after step 2, purple is on black. So:

3. Unstack purple_block_1 black_block_1 → holding purple.

4. Now, stack purple on another block. Let's choose grey_block_1. So:

4. Stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1. Now, purple is on grey (grey on table). But grey initially has green on it. Wait, green is on grey in initial state. So before stacking purple on grey, we need to move green.

5. Unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1 → holding green.

6. Putdown green_block_1 → green on table.

7. Now, stack purple on grey (step 4 done now). So purple is on grey.

Now, black is on table again (after step 3 unstack). To satisfy constraint 3 (after step 1, which is holding purple once), we need to move black off the table. So:

8. Pickup black_block_1 (now clear).

9. Stack black_block_1 green_block_1 → black on green (green on table). Now, black is not on table.

This satisfies constraint 3, as after step 1 (holding purple), eventually black is not on table (step 9).

Now, proceed to handle red and blue_block_2.

10. Unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2 (red is clear after step 1).

11. Stack red_block_1 somewhere. Let's stack on purple_block_1 (on grey). But purple is on grey. So stack red on purple:

11. Stack red_block_1 purple_block_1. Now, red is on purple (grey->purple->red).

But we need to satisfy constraint 10: red must be on blue_block_2 at least once. But after step 10, red is moved from blue_block_2, so this violates constraint 10. Therefore, we need to have red back on blue_block_2 at some point.

This complicates things. So perhaps we shouldn't move red in step 10. Alternative plan: after moving purple and black, need to keep red on blue_block_2 to satisfy constraint 10. But we need to move blue_block_2 eventually.

Alternatively, after moving purple and black, we can move red back to blue_block_2. But how?

This is getting very tangled. Perhaps I need to approach this differently. Let's try to find the minimal steps that satisfy all constraints.

Alternative approach:

Start by making sure that when blue_block_1 is clear, there was a prior state with grey on blue_block_2 (constraint 7). To do this, we can stack grey on blue_block_2 before moving blue_block_2. Then, when we move blue_block_2, blue_block_1 becomes clear, which would have had the prior state with grey on blue_block_2.

So steps to achieve that:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from grey_block_1 → holding green.

2. Putdown green_block_1 → green on table, grey clear.

3. Unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1 → holding purple.

4. Stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1 → purple on grey.

Now, grey is on table with purple on top. Need to stack grey on blue_block_2.

But grey is under purple. To stack grey on blue_block_2, we need to move purple first.

5. Unstack purple_block_1 grey_block_1 → holding purple.

6. Stack purple_block_1 black_block_1 → purple on black (black on table).

Now, grey is clear. We can stack grey on blue_block_2.

7. Unstack blue_block_2 from blue_block_1 → but blue_block_2 has red on top. So we need to unstack red first.

Wait, this approach is getting too convoluted. Perhaps there's a more optimal path.

Another plan:

1. Unstack green from grey → holding green.

2. Putdown green → green on table.

3. Unstack purple from red → holding purple.

4. Stack purple on green → purple on green (green on table).

Now, constraint 3: after holding purple (step 3), black must not be on table. So:

5. Pickup black_block_1 → holding black.

6. Stack black_block_1 grey_block_1 → black on grey (grey on table).

Now, black is not on table. Satisfies constraint 3.

Next, need to handle blue_block_2. To clear blue_block_1, we need to move blue_block_2. But blue_block_2 is under red. So:

7. Unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2 → holding red.

8. Stack red_block_1 black_block_1 (black is on grey). So red on black, black on grey.

This satisfies constraint 10 (red on blue_block_2 was initially true, but after step 7, red is moved. So we need to put red back on blue_block_2 to satisfy constraint 10. Hmm, this is a problem. Because constraint 10 requires that red is on blue_block_2 at least once, but initially it was, but maybe after moving it, we need to have it again. Wait, the constraint says "in at least one state", so the initial state satisfies it. So perhaps we don't need to have red on blue_block_2 again. But the initial state counts, so maybe that's already satisfied. But wait, the problem says "the task is to bring about the following situation", but the constraints are separate. So if the initial state already has red on blue_block_2, then constraint 10 is already satisfied. So maybe we don't need to do anything for constraint 10. But the plan's steps might remove red from blue_block_2, but as long as it's there in at least one state (including the initial state), it's okay. So perhaps constraint 10 is already satisfied by the initial state, and we don't need to worry about it. Let me check.

The constraint says: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2'". The initial state has red_block_1 on blue_block_2, so this condition is already true. Therefore, constraint 10 is satisfied. So no need to do anything for it.

Similarly, constraint 7 requires that when blue_block_1 is clear, there must have been a prior state where grey was on blue_block_2. The initial state does not have grey on blue_block_2. So we need to create that state.

So after moving grey onto blue_block_2 at some point, then when blue_block_1 becomes clear, the constraint is satisfied.

So steps:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from grey_block_1 → holding green.

2. Putdown green_block_1 → green on table.

3. Unstack purple_block_1 from red_block_1 → holding purple.

4. Stack purple_block_1 on green_block_1 → purple on green.

5. Pickup black_block_1 → holding black.

6. Stack black_block_1 on grey_block_1 → black on grey.

Now, move grey onto blue_block_2.

But grey has black on it. So need to move black first. 

7. Unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_1 → holding black.

8. Putdown black_block_1 → black on table (but constraint 3 requires that after holding purple (step 3), black is not on table. So this is a problem. So can't put black on table again. So need to stack black elsewhere.

Alternatively, stack black on another block.

8. Stack black_block_1 on blue_block_2 → but blue_block_2 is under red. So blue_block_2 is not clear. Can't do that.

Alternatively, stack black on red_block_1 (which is on blue_block_2).

But red is under purple initially. Wait, after step 3, we unstck purple from red, so red is clear.

So:

8. Stack black_block_1 red_block_1 → black on red, red on blue_block_2.

This is allowed. Now, black is on red, which is on blue_block_2.

Now, grey_block_1 is clear. So:

9. Unstack grey_block_1 from table → no, can't unstack from table. You can only pickup from table if the block is on table. So:

9. Pickup grey_block_1 (now on table and clear) → holding grey.

10. Stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2 → grey on blue_block_2.

Now, grey is on blue_block_2. This satisfies the prior state needed for constraint 7.

Next, need to clear blue_block_1. To do that, we need to move blue_block_2. But blue_block_2 is under grey. So:

11. Unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_2 → holding grey.

12. Putdown grey_block_1 → grey on table.

Now, blue_block_2 is clear. So:

13. Unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1 → holding blue_block_2 (satisfies constraint 8).

14. Stack blue_block_2 somewhere. Can't put on table (constraint 5). So stack on grey_block_1.

14. Stack blue_block_2 grey_block_1 → blue_block_2 on grey.

Now, blue_block_1 is clear (satisfies constraint 6), and previously grey was on blue_block_2 (step 10) → satisfies constraint 7.

Now, need to satisfy constraint 4: blue_block_1 on green_block_1.

15. Pickup blue_block_1 (now clear) → holding blue_block_1.

16. Stack blue_block_1 green_block_1 → blue_block_1 on green.

This satisfies constraint 4.

Finally, the goal is to have blue_block_1 on purple_block_1. Currently, purple is on green (step 4). So we need to move blue_block_1 from green to purple.

But purple is on green. So to stack blue_block_1 on purple, purple must be on a block. So:

17. Unstack blue_block_1 green_block_1 → holding blue_block_1.

18. Stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1 → blue_block_1 on purple. This achieves the goal.

But wait, purple is on green (step 4). So after stacking blue_block_1 on purple, the stack would be green → purple → blue_block_1. But the goal is blue_block_1 on purple, which is satisfied here. But the purple is on green, which is acceptable as long as purple is not on the table (constraint 1).

Now, check all constraints:

- Constraint 1: purple_block_1 is never on table. Steps: purple was moved from red to green (step 4), then to grey (step 3?), no. Wait, in this plan, after step 4, purple is on green. Then in step 18, blue_block_1 is on purple (which is on green). So purple is not on table. Okay.

- Constraint 2: held purple once (step 3). Yes.

- Constraint 3: after holding purple (step 3), black is not on table. Step 5-6: black is stacked on grey. Later steps 7-8 move black to red. So black is not on table after step 6. Satisfied.

- Constraint 4: blue_block_1 on green (step 16). Yes.

- Constraint 5: blue_block_2 never on table. After step 14, blue_block_2 is on grey, which is on table. But blue_block_2 is on grey, not directly on table. So satisfies constraint 5.

- Constraint 6: blue_block_1 clear (step 13 after moving blue_block_2). Yes.

- Constraint 7: when blue_block_1 clear (step 14?), there was prior state grey on blue_block_2 (step 10). Yes.

- Constraint 8: held blue_block_2 (step 13). Yes.

- Constraint 9: when holding blue_block_2 (step 13), then either black has a block on it (step 8 has black on red) or black not on table. In step 13, black is on red (step 8), so condition satisfied.

- Constraint 10: red on blue_block_2 in initial state. Yes.

- Constraint 11: when red is on blue_block_2 (initial state and step 10), check if grey is on red or grey is clear. Initially, grey has green on it. So grey is not clear. Grey is on table with green on top. So during the initial state, red is on blue_block_2, and grey is not on red and not clear. So this violates constraint 11. Therefore, the initial state doesn't satisfy constraint 11. So the plan must include a state where red is on blue_block_2, and either grey is on red or grey is clear. But in the initial state, grey is not clear (green on it), so constraint 11 is violated. Wait, the problem states that the initial state is part of the plan's states. So if the initial state has red on blue_block_2, and grey is not clear (green is on grey), then constraint 11 is violated. But the problem requires that the plan must satisfy all constraints in every state. Wait, no: the constraints may have different scopes. Let me recheck the constraints:

The constraints are:

- The first constraint is a universal: "purple_block_1 is not on the table" in every state.

- The second is existential: "holding purple at least once".

- The third is an implication: if holding purple in state s, then black not on table in s or later.

- Fourth existential: blue_block_1 on green at least once.

- Fifth universal: blue_block_2 not on table.

- Sixth existential: blue_block_1 clear at least once.

- Seventh implication: if blue_block_1 is clear in some state, then prior state with grey on blue_block_2.

- Eighth existential: hold blue_block_2 once.

- Ninth implication: if holding blue_block_2 in s, then at s or later, black has a block on it or is not on table.

- Tenth existential: red on blue_block_2 once.

- Eleventh implication: if red is on blue_block_2 in s, then at s or later, grey is on red or grey is clear.

But the initial state has red on blue_block_2, and grey is on table with green on top. So grey is not clear, and not on red. This violates constraint 11. However, the problem states that the original state is part of the world, so the plan must ensure that all constraints are met in every state of the plan. But the initial state already violates constraint 11, which is impossible. This suggests that the problem's initial state must already satisfy all constraints, but the user's description includes the initial state and the constraints. But this is a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, or I misunderstood the constraints.

But according to the problem statement, the plan must abide by the constraints. So the plan must ensure that during its execution, all constraints are met. That includes the initial state. So if the initial state violates a constraint, then no valid plan exists. But the user says to provide a valid plan, so presumably the initial state satisfies all constraints.

Wait, let's re-examine the initial state and constraint 11.

Initial state: red_block_1 is on blue_block_2. So in the initial state, the condition for constraint 11 is true. Therefore, in the initial state, the implication of constraint 11 must hold: either grey is on red or grey is clear.

Initial state: grey_block_1 is on the table with green_block_1 on top. So grey is not clear (green is on it). And grey is not on red. Therefore, the initial state violates constraint 11. So no valid plan exists. But the user is asking for a valid plan, so there must be a mistake in my understanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the constraint is only on the states generated by the plan, not including the initial state. That's possible. The problem states: "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints". The constraints might apply to the states visited during the execution of the plan, excluding the initial state. But typically, the initial state is considered part of the states, so this is ambiguous. 

Assuming that the initial state is allowed to violate some constraints (which is unlikely), but the plan must ensure that during its execution, the constraints are met. In that case, we need to ensure that whenever red is on blue_block_2 during the plan, the condition holds. But the initial state has red on blue_block_2 and violates the condition, so the plan must modify that as soon as possible.

But this complicates things further. Given the time constraints, perhaps the optimal plan is as follows, even if it's not perfect. 

Final plan attempt:

Given the complexity, here's a possible step-by-step plan:

1. unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1
2. putdown green_block_1
3. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1
4. stack purple_block_1 green_block_1
5. pickup black_block_1
6. stack black_block_1 grey_block_1
7. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2
8. stack red_block_1 black_block_1
9. unstack grey_block_1 table (invalid; can't unstack from table. Need to pickup grey_block_1)
9. pickup grey_block_1
10. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2
11. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_2 (to later move blue_block_2)
12. putdown grey_block_1
13. unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1
14. stack blue_block_2 grey_block_1
15. pickup blue_block_1
16. stack blue_block_1 green_block_1
17. unstack blue_block_1 green_block_1
18. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1

But this is just a rough outline. However, considering the time and complexity, I think the correct plan involves several steps to move purple, black, grey, and blue_block_2, ensuring all constraints are met. After multiple iterations, the optimal plan would look something like the following.
