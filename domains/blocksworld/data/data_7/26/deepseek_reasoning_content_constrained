Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld problem. Hmm, the initial state is a bit complex. Let me first visualize the blocks. 

Starting with the initial state: white_block_1 is on the table, and grey_block_1 is on top of it. Then purple_block_2 is on grey_block_1, followed by yellow_block_1 and blue_block_1. So the tower here is white_block_1 -> grey_block_1 -> purple_block_2 -> yellow_block_1 -> blue_block_1. Then there's another tower: purple_block_1 has orange_block_1 on top. All the top blocks (orange_block_1 and blue_block_1) are clear. The goal is to make grey_block_1 clear. So currently, grey_block_1 has purple_block_2 on it, so we need to remove that.

But wait, the constraints complicate things. Let me list them out:

1. At some state, grey_block_1 is not on the table. Since initially it's on white_block_1 (which is on the table), maybe moving it elsewhere would satisfy this. But after moving, maybe putting it on another block or the table again. Wait, but if we unstack purple_block_2 from grey_block_1, then grey_block_1 would be clear. But the goal is to make grey_block_1 clear. Wait, the goal is already to have grey_block_1 clear. Wait, no. Wait the initial state says grey_block_1 is on white_block_1, and purple_block_2 is on grey_block_1. So initially, grey_block_1 is not clear. The goal is to make it clear. So we need to remove whatever is on top of grey_block_1, which is purple_block_2. But how?

But the constraints must be satisfied. Let's go through each constraint:

Constraint 1: "grey_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in at least one state. Since initially, grey_block_1 is on white_block_1 (which is on the table), so it's not on the table. Wait, no. If a block is on another block, it's not on the table. So in the initial state, grey_block_1 is on white_block_1, so it's not on the table. So maybe this constraint is already satisfied in the initial state. But the problem says the constraints must be abided by in the plan. Wait, but the constraint says that in at least one state of the plan, this must hold. But in the initial state, grey_block_1 is not on the table. So if the plan doesn't move it to the table, then this constraint is already satisfied. But if during the plan, we put grey_block_1 on the table, then in that state, it would be on the table. So we have to ensure that in at least one state of the plan, grey_block_1 is not on the table. Since the initial state already satisfies that, maybe we don't need to do anything. But perhaps during the plan, if we move grey_block_1 to the table, then in that state, it's on the table, but maybe in another state it's not. Wait, but the initial state counts as part of the plan states. So maybe constraint 1 is already satisfied. However, the problem might require that the plan includes actions that make this true, but perhaps the initial state counts. Hmm. Let's note that and move on.

Constraint 2: If grey_block_1 is not on the table in some state s, then either blue_block_1 is not clear or purple_block_2 is clear must hold in s or after. Since grey_block_1 is not on the table initially, in the initial state, we need to check if either blue_block_1 is not clear (but it is clear in the initial state) or purple_block_2 is clear (which it isn't, since yellow_block_1 is on it). So in the initial state, the condition isn't met, so we must ensure that after the initial state, either blue_block_1 becomes not clear or purple_block_2 becomes clear. Since the plan needs to start from the initial state, maybe during the plan, after the initial state, these conditions must be met. So perhaps in some subsequent step, we need to either put something on blue_block_1 or clear purple_block_2. But how?

Constraint 3: At some state, the agent is holding purple_block_1 and white_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2. So we need to have a state where both these are true. The second part, white_block_1 on purple_block_2. Currently, white_block_1 is under grey_block_1. So we need to move white_block_1 to be on purple_block_2. That would require moving white_block_1, but since it's under grey_block_1, we can't pick it up unless we first remove the blocks on top. So to get white_block_1 on purple_block_2, perhaps we need to unstack grey_block_1 from white_block_1, but that's part of achieving the goal. Wait, the goal is to make grey_block_1 clear. So if we unstack purple_block_2 from grey_block_1, then grey_block_1 becomes clear. But that would make purple_block_2 clear? Wait, purple_block_2 is currently under yellow_block_1. So to unstack purple_block_2 from grey_block_1, we have to first remove yellow_block_1 and blue_block_1. Because yellow_block_1 is on purple_block_2, which is on grey_block_1, which is on white_block_1. So the stack is white_block_1, grey_block_1, purple_block_2, yellow_block_1, blue_block_1. So to get to purple_block_2, we need to unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1, then unstack yellow_block_1 from purple_block_2. Then unstack purple_block_2 from grey_block_1. That would leave grey_block_1 clear, achieving the goal. But then, during this process, when we unstack purple_block_2, we can put it somewhere. Also, constraint 3 requires that at some point, white_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2. So white_block_1 is on the table initially. To put it on purple_block_2, we need to pick up white_block_1 (but it's under grey_block_1, so first we need to clear it by moving grey_block_1 and purple_block_2, which is part of the main goal). Wait, but if we move purple_block_2 and grey_block_1, then white_block_1 is clear. Then we can pick it up and stack it onto purple_block_2. So perhaps that's part of the plan. Also, during this process, the agent must be holding purple_block_1. So maybe in the same state, we need to be holding purple_block_1 and have white_block_1 on purple_block_2. So perhaps after moving white_block_1 to purple_block_2, then we need to pick up purple_block_1. But purple_block_1 is under orange_block_1. So to pick up purple_block_1, we need to first remove orange_block_1. So unstack orange_block_1 from purple_block_1, put it down, then pickup purple_block_1. Then, while holding purple_block_1, white_block_1 is on purple_block_2. So that would satisfy constraint 3.

Constraint 4: Yellow_block_1 is not on the table in every state. So in every state of the plan, yellow_block_1 must be on top of some block, never on the table. Initially, it's on purple_block_2, so that's okay. But if during the plan we putdown yellow_block_1, that would violate the constraint. So we can't put it on the table. So any action that involves putting yellow_block_1 down must stack it on another block.

Constraint 5: At some state, orange_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1. So we need to stack orange_block_1 onto blue_block_1 at some point.

Constraint 6: Blue_block_1 is not on the table in every state. So blue_block_1 must always be on some block. Initially, it's on yellow_block_1. So as long as we don't put it on the table, that's okay. So any movement of blue_block_1 must involve stacking it on another block.

Constraint 7: At some state, there's a block on top of white_block_1 (i.e., white_block_1 is not clear). But in the initial state, white_block_1 has grey_block_1 on it. So initially, white_block_1 is not clear. So maybe this constraint is already satisfied. But the plan's initial state is part of the states considered. However, if during the plan we remove grey_block_1 from white_block_1, then white_block_1 becomes clear, but in that case, maybe we have to put something back on it to satisfy constraint 7. Wait, no. The constraint says that in at least one state, there's a block on top of white_block_1. Since the initial state already satisfies that, perhaps we don't need to do anything. But if during the plan, we remove all blocks from white_block_1, then in the final state, white_block_1 would be clear, but the constraint only requires that in at least one state (could be the initial state) the condition holds. So maybe constraint 7 is already satisfied. But we need to check the plan steps to ensure that we don't violate it. Wait, no, the constraint is that in at least one state, the condition holds. So as long as in some state of the plan (including the initial state), that's true. So if the initial state satisfies it, then we don't need to do anything. But if during the plan, we remove the block from white_block_1 and never put anything back, then the constraint is still satisfied because the initial state had it. So that's okay.

Constraint 8: If at any state s, white_block_1 is not clear (i.e., has a block on top), then in s or a subsequent state, purple_block_2 must be on the table. So initially, white_block_1 is not clear (has grey_block_1 on it). So in the initial state, we must have purple_block_2 on the table in that state or a subsequent state. But initially, purple_block_2 is on grey_block_1, which is on white_block_1. So in the initial state, purple_block_2 is not on the table. Therefore, the constraint requires that in some state after the initial state, purple_block_2 is on the table. So during the plan, we need to put purple_block_2 on the table. But how? Because to do that, we need to unstack purple_block_2 from grey_block_1, but then we have to put it down. Wait, but purple_block_2 is under yellow_block_1 and blue_block_1. So we need to first unstack blue_block_1, then yellow_block_1, then purple_block_2. Then we can put purple_block_2 on the table. But putting it on the table would require using putdown, but that would make purple_block_2 on the table, which is allowed. However, constraint 8 says that whenever white_block_1 is not clear, purple_block_2 must be on the table in that state or later. Since the initial state has white_block_1 not clear, we must have purple_block_2 on the table at some point after the initial state. So during the plan, after the initial state, at some point, purple_block_2 must be on the table. So perhaps when we unstack purple_block_2 from grey_block_1, we can put it on the table. But putting it on the table would involve putdown purple_block_2. However, to do that, we need to have purple_block_2 in hand. So first, we need to unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1, unstack yellow_block_1 from purple_block_2, unstack purple_block_2 from grey_block_1, then putdown purple_block_2. But putting purple_block_2 on the table would satisfy that in that state, purple_block_2 is on the table, which would meet the requirement from constraint 8. But also, after that, if we have to stack purple_block_2 somewhere else, that's okay as long as in the state where white_block_1 was not clear (like the initial state), we have a subsequent state where purple_block_2 is on the table.

Constraint 9: At least one state where either purple_block_2 is on the table or the agent is holding purple_block_1. Since constraint 8 requires that purple_block_2 is on the table at some point (if we do put it there), then that would satisfy constraint 9. Alternatively, if we don't put purple_block_2 on the table but the agent is holding purple_block_1 at some point, that also works. But given constraint 3 requires that the agent is holding purple_block_1 in some state, perhaps that's already covered. So if we satisfy constraint 3, then constraint 9 is also satisfied because in that state, the agent is holding purple_block_1. So maybe that's covered.

Now, the main goal is to make grey_block_1 clear. So we need to remove whatever is on top of it, which is purple_block_2. But purple_block_2 has yellow_block_1 and blue_block_1 on top. So the steps would be:

1. Unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1. Since blue_block_1 is clear, and we're not holding anything, we can do this. Then put blue_block_1 somewhere. But constraint 6 says blue_block_1 can't be on the table. So after unstacking, we need to stack it on another block. But where? Maybe stack it on orange_block_1? But orange_block_1 is on purple_block_1. So unstack orange_block_1 first, then stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_1? Wait, but we need to stack orange_block_1 on blue_block_1 for constraint 5. Hmm.

Alternatively, after unstacking blue_block_1, we can stack it on some other block. Let's think:

The initial state has two towers:

Tower 1: white_block_1 (on table) -> grey_block_1 -> purple_block_2 -> yellow_block_1 -> blue_block_1.

Tower 2: purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1.

The goal is to clear grey_block_1. So we need to remove purple_block_2 from it. But purple_block_2 has yellow and blue on top.

So steps to remove purple_block_2:

- Unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1. Then stack it somewhere. Since we can't put it on the table (constraint 6), we need to stack it on another block. Let's say we stack it on orange_block_1. To do that, we need to unstack orange_block_1 from purple_block_1, put it down, then stack blue_block_1 on it. But that would require more steps. Alternatively, stack blue_block_1 directly on purple_block_1 if possible. Wait, purple_block_1 has orange_block_1 on top. So to stack on purple_block_1, we need to clear it first by unstacking orange_block_1.

Let me outline the steps:

1. unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1. Now holding blue_block_1. Then stack it on some block. Let's choose orange_block_1. To stack on orange_block_1, it must be clear. But orange_block_1 is clear. So stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_1. Now, orange_block_1 has blue_block_1 on top. This satisfies constraint 5 (orange_block_1 is on blue_block_1? Wait, no. The constraint says orange_block_1 must be on top of blue_block_1. So if we stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_1, then orange_block_1 is under blue_block_1. That's the opposite. So that's not helpful. So perhaps stack blue_block_1 on a different block. Maybe on purple_block_1. But purple_block_1 has orange_block_1 on top. So to stack on purple_block_1, we need to unstack orange_block_1 first.

So:

1. unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1. Now holding blue_block_1.

2. stack blue_block_1 on some block. Let's choose purple_block_1. But to do that, we need to clear purple_block_1.

But purple_block_1 has orange_block_1 on top. So:

a. unstack orange_block_1 from purple_block_1. Now holding orange_block_1.

b. putdown orange_block_1. Now orange_block_1 is on the table.

c. stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_1. Now blue_block_1 is on purple_block_1.

But this uses multiple steps, and blue_block_1 is now on purple_block_1. Then, we can proceed to unstack yellow_block_1 from purple_block_2. But let's see.

But perhaps there's a better way. Alternatively, after unstacking blue_block_1, stack it on purple_block_2. Wait, but purple_block_2 is under yellow_block_1. So can't stack on it until we clear yellow_block_1. Hmm.

Alternatively, after unstacking blue_block_1, we need to stack it somewhere. Let's think of stacking it on orange_block_1. But orange_block_1 is on purple_block_1. So to stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_1, we need to unstack orange_block_1 first. Then put it down, then stack blue_block_1 on it. But that's more steps. Alternatively, stack blue_block_1 on a new block. But all blocks are in use. Maybe stack it on white_block_1, but that's under grey_block_1. Not possible unless we clear grey_block_1 first, which is the goal.

Wait, maybe after unstacking blue_block_1, stack it on purple_block_1. To do that, we need to clear purple_block_1 by removing orange_block_1. So:

1. unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1. Now holding blue_block_1.

2. unstack orange_block_1 from purple_block_1. Now holding orange_block_1.

3. stack orange_block_1 on blue_block_1. Wait, but blue_block_1 is currently being held. Oh, no, after step 1, we have blue_block_1 in hand. Then step 2, unstack orange_block_1 from purple_block_1 (now holding orange_block_1). Then we can't stack orange_block_1 on blue_block_1 because blue_block_1 is in hand. Wait, maybe:

1. unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1. Hold blue.

2. unstack orange_block_1 from purple_block_1. Hold orange.

3. stack orange_block_1 on blue_block_1. But blue_block_1 is in hand. So can't stack. So perhaps first putdown blue_block_1, then stack orange on it. But constraint 6 says blue_block_1 can't be on the table. So that's not allowed. So putting blue_block_1 on the table is invalid. Therefore, this approach is not possible.

Alternative approach: After unstacking blue_block_1, we need to stack it on a clear block. Let's look for a clear block. Initially, the clear blocks are orange_block_1 and blue_block_1. After unstacking blue_block_1, the clear blocks would be yellow_block_1 (since blue_block_1 was removed) and orange_block_1. So stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_1. Wait, but yellow_block_1 is on purple_block_2. So after unstacking blue_block_1, yellow_block_1 is clear. So can stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_1. So:

1. unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1. Hold blue.

2. stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_1. Now, blue is on yellow, which is on purple_block_2. But this doesn't help, but satisfies constraint 6 (blue not on table). But then, when we unstack yellow_block_1 later, blue_block_1 is on it. Hmm. Not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_1. But orange is on purple_block_1. So:

1. unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1. Hold blue.

2. unstack orange_block_1 from purple_block_1. Hold orange.

3. stack orange_block_1 on blue_block_1. But blue is in hand. Can't do that. So need to put blue down first. But can't put blue on the table. So this approach isn't possible.

Hmm, perhaps the best way is to stack blue_block_1 on a new block. Maybe create a new tower. Let's see. Since we have purple_block_2 in the initial tower, perhaps after moving blue and yellow, we can stack them elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe after unstacking blue_block_1, we can stack it on purple_block_1. But to do that, we need to clear purple_block_1 by removing orange_block_1. So:

1. unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1. Hold blue.

2. unstack orange_block_1 from purple_block_1. Hold orange.

3. stack orange_block_1 somewhere. Since we can't put it on the table (constraint 5 isn't met yet), but constraint 5 requires orange_block_1 on blue_block_1. So maybe stack orange_block_1 on blue_block_1. But blue_block_1 is in hand. So:

Wait, step 1: hold blue.

Step 2: unstack orange, now hold orange.

Step 3: stack orange on blue. But blue is in hand. Can't stack. So need to put blue down first. But blue can't be put on the table. So this is a problem.

Alternative idea: First unstack orange_block_1 from purple_block_1, then put it down. Then stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_1. Then stack orange_block_1 on blue_block_1.

Let's try:

1. unstack orange_block_1 from purple_block_1. Now holding orange.

2. putdown orange_block_1. Now orange is on the table.

3. unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1. Now holding blue.

4. stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_1. Now purple_block_1 has blue_block_1 on it.

5. pickup orange_block_1. Now holding orange.

6. stack orange_block_1 on blue_block_1. Now orange is on blue. This satisfies constraint 5: orange_block_1 is on blue_block_1 in this state.

So this sequence would satisfy constraint 5. But let's check the steps. Are all preconditions met?

Step 1: unstack orange_block_1 from purple_block_1. Preconditions: orange is on purple_block_1, orange is clear (it is), and not holding anything (correct). So possible.

Step 2: putdown orange. Now orange is on table. But constraint 5 requires that at some state, orange is on blue. So step 6 achieves that.

Step 3: unstack blue from yellow. Possible.

Step 4: stack blue on purple_block_1. Purple_block_1 is clear (after step 1). So yes.

Step 5: pickup orange from table. Possible, since it's clear.

Step 6: stack orange on blue. Blue is on purple_block_1. So yes.

Okay, that sequence works for those steps. Now, proceeding to handle the purple_block_2 and grey_block_1.

After these steps, we have:

- Tower 1: white_block_1 -> grey_block_1 -> purple_block_2 -> yellow_block_1 (still there, since we only moved blue and orange).

Wait, no. After step 3, we unstacked blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1. So yellow_block_1 is now clear. Then in step 4, we stacked blue_block_1 on purple_block_1. Then in step 6, stacked orange on blue.

So now, the towers are:

Tower 1: white_block_1 -> grey_block_1 -> purple_block_2 -> yellow_block_1 (clear).

Tower 2: purple_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> orange_block_1.

And orange_block_1 is on blue_block_1, satisfying constraint 5.

Now, the next step is to unstack yellow_block_1 from purple_block_2. But to do that, we need to pick up yellow_block_1, which is clear. So:

7. pickup yellow_block_1. Since it's on purple_block_2 and clear. Then stack it somewhere. But constraint 4 says yellow_block_1 can't be on the table. So we need to stack it on another block.

Let's stack it on orange_block_1. Orange_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1, so it's clear. So:

8. stack yellow_block_1 on orange_block_1. Now, yellow is on orange, which is on blue, etc.

Now, purple_block_2 is clear. So we can now unstack purple_block_2 from grey_block_1. But wait, purple_block_2 is on grey_block_1, and after steps 7 and 8, purple_block_2 is clear. So:

9. unstack purple_block_2 from grey_block_1. Now holding purple_block_2.

At this point, grey_block_1 is clear, which is the goal. But we need to put purple_block_2 somewhere. However, constraint 8 says that whenever white_block_1 is not clear (which it is, since grey_block_1 is still on it), then purple_block_2 must be on the table at that state or a subsequent one. So after unstacking purple_block_2, we need to put it on the table. Because in the state after step 9, white_block_1 is still under grey_block_1 (so not clear), so we must have purple_block_2 on the table in that state or later. So:

10. putdown purple_block_2. Now purple_block_2 is on the table. But wait, putdown requires that you are holding the block. After step 9, we are holding purple_block_2. So yes, we can put it down. However, this would make purple_block_2 on the table, which satisfies constraint 8. But putting it down would also make purple_block_2 clear. However, we have constraint 1 which requires that in some state, grey_block_1 is not on the table. But grey_block_1 is on white_block_1, which is on the table. So grey_block_1 is not on the table. So constraint 1 is satisfied.

But also, constraint 8 is satisfied because in step 10, purple_block_2 is on the table. So after step 9, when we unstack purple_block_2, grey_block_1 is clear (achieving the goal), but we need to put purple_block_2 on the table to satisfy constraint 8. However, the main goal is to make grey_block_1 clear, which is achieved at step 9. But we need to complete the plan by putting purple_block_2 somewhere. However, putting it on the table would make it on the table, which is allowed. So step 10: putdown purple_block_2. Now, the plan is:

But wait, the goal is to have grey_block_1 clear. So after step 9, the goal is achieved. But the problem requires that the plan brings about the goal, so the final state must have grey_block_1 clear. However, step 10 is putting down purple_block_2, which doesn't affect grey_block_1's clearness. So the goal is achieved at step 9. But the plan must continue until all actions are done. However, in planning problems, the plan is a sequence of actions that, when executed from the initial state, results in the goal being true. So even if the goal is achieved before all actions are done, it's still valid. But perhaps the constraints require certain things beyond the goal. For example, constraint 8 requires that if white_block_1 is not clear (which it still is, since grey_block_1 is on it), then purple_block_2 must be on the table in some state after. So after step 9, we have to put purple_block_2 on the table (step 10) to satisfy constraint 8.

But also, after step 9, the goal is achieved, but we need to make sure that all constraints are met. So proceeding to step 10 is necessary.

Now, after step 10, purple_block_2 is on the table, satisfying constraint 8. Also, constraint 3 requires that in some state, the agent is holding purple_block_1 and white_block_1 is on purple_block_2. Currently, white_block_1 is on the table, so to have white_block_1 on purple_block_2, we need to move white_block_1 onto purple_block_2. But white_block_1 is under grey_block_1. To move white_block_1, we need to first remove grey_block_1. But grey_block_1 is now clear (since purple_block_2 was removed in step 9). So we can pick up grey_block_1 and move it. Wait, but the goal is to make grey_block_1 clear. If we move grey_block_1, it would no longer be clear. But the goal is achieved once grey_block_1 is clear, so after step 9, it's clear, but if we then move it, the final state would have it not clear. So we must ensure that the final state has grey_block_1 clear. Therefore, after step 9, we cannot move grey_block_1. So steps after 9 must not affect grey_block_1's clearness.

But in step 10, putting down purple_block_2 doesn't affect grey_block_1. So the final state after step 10 would have grey_block_1 clear, and purple_block_2 on the table. So the goal is achieved.

Now, let's check constraint 3: there must be a state where the agent is holding purple_block_1 and white_block_1 is on purple_block_2. Currently, white_block_1 is on the table, so how can it be on purple_block_2? We need to perform actions to move white_block_1 onto purple_block_2. But white_block_1 is under grey_block_1. To pick up white_block_1, we need to first move grey_block_1. But grey_block_1 is clear. So:

After step 10, we can:

11. unstack grey_block_1 from white_block_1. Now holding grey_block_1.

12. putdown grey_block_1 on the table. Now grey_block_1 is on the table. But the goal requires grey_block_1 to be clear. Wait, but the goal is to have grey_block_1 clear. If we put it on the table, it's clear. So that's okay. Then:

13. pickup white_block_1. Now holding white_block_1.

14. stack white_block_1 on purple_block_2 (which is on the table). But to stack, purple_block_2 must be clear. Since we put purple_block_2 on the table in step 10, it is clear. So stack white_block_1 on purple_block_2.

But during this, the agent must also be holding purple_block_1 in some state. So perhaps after step 14, we need to pickup purple_block_1. But purple_block_1 has blue_block_1 on top. So to pick up purple_block_1, we need to unstack blue_block_1 first. So:

15. unstack blue_block_1 from purple_block_1. Now holding blue_block_1.

16. stack blue_block_1 somewhere (can't put on table). Maybe stack on grey_block_1 (which is on the table). So stack blue_block_1 on grey_block_1.

17. unstack orange_block_1 from blue_block_1 (since it's on top of blue_block_1). Now holding orange_block_1.

18. putdown orange_block_1.

19. pickup purple_block_1. Now holding purple_block_1.

At this point, in state 19, the agent is holding purple_block_1, and white_block_1 is on purple_block_2 (from step 14). This satisfies constraint 3. But this adds a lot of steps. However, the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). So this approach is adding many steps, which may not be optimal.

Wait, but constraint 3 requires that in some state, both holding purple_block_1 and white_block_1 is on purple_block_2. So we need to have those two conditions in the same state. So during the plan, there must be a state where both are true. So perhaps during the process of moving white_block_1 to purple_block_2 and then picking up purple_block_1.

But this seems like a lot of steps. Maybe there's a smarter way to satisfy constraint 3.

Alternatively, during the initial steps, after moving orange and blue, we can move white_block_1 onto purple_block_2 before clearing grey_block_1. But white_block_1 is under grey_block_1. So to move white_block_1, we need to first clear it by moving grey_block_1. Which would require unstacking grey_block_1, but grey_block_1 is under purple_block_2. Wait, the initial stack is white_block_1 -> grey_block_1 -> purple_block_2 -> yellow_block_1 -> blue_block_1. So to get grey_block_1 clear, we need to remove purple_block_2. So perhaps the steps are:

- Unstack blue, yellow, purple_block_2 to clear grey_block_1. Then move grey_block_1 to the table, then move white_block_1 onto purple_block_2. But this would take many steps.

But this would require:

1. unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1.

2. stack blue_block_1 somewhere (e.g., on orange_block_1, which requires unstacking orange_block_1 first).

3. unstack yellow_block_1 from purple_block_2.

4. stack yellow_block_1 somewhere.

5. unstack purple_block_2 from grey_block_1.

6. putdown purple_block_2.

7. unstack grey_block_1 from white_block_1.

8. putdown grey_block_1.

9. pickup white_block_1.

10. stack white_block_1 on purple_block_2.

Then, to hold purple_block_1, we need to unstack blue_block_1 from wherever it is, then unstack orange_block_1, then pickup purple_block_1.

This seems very lengthy. But maybe necessary.

Alternatively, after achieving the main goal (grey_block_1 clear), then handle the constraints. But the constraints must be met during the plan.

But given the complexity, perhaps the optimal plan is to first clear grey_block_1 by unstacking purple_block_2, then handle the constraints in a way that minimizes steps.

But given all the constraints, this is getting quite complex. Let's try to outline a possible plan step by step, ensuring all constraints are met.

Let's start with the main goal: clear grey_block_1. To do this, we need to unstack purple_block_2 from grey_block_1. But purple_block_2 has yellow and blue on top. So:

1. unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1. Hold blue.

2. stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_1 (since orange is clear and on purple_block_1). But to stack on orange_block_1, need to unstack orange_block_1 first.

Wait, no. orange_block_1 is on purple_block_1. To stack blue on orange, we can do that if orange is clear. But orange is clear initially. So:

1. unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1. Hold blue.

2. stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_1. Now, orange_block_1 has blue_block_1 on top. This way, blue is not on the table.

But constraint 5 requires orange_block_1 to be on blue_block_1. So this is the opposite. So this doesn't help. Alternatively, stack blue on purple_block_1 after unstacking orange.

Alternative plan:

1. unstack orange_block_1 from purple_block_1. Hold orange.

2. putdown orange_block_1.

3. unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1. Hold blue.

4. stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_1.

5. pickup orange_block_1.

6. stack orange_block_1 on blue_block_1. Now, orange is on blue, satisfying constraint 5.

7. unstack yellow_block_1 from purple_block_2. Hold yellow.

8. stack yellow_block_1 on orange_block_1. Now, yellow is on orange.

9. unstack purple_block_2 from grey_block_1. Hold purple_block_2.

10. putdown purple_block_2. Now, grey_block_1 is clear (goal achieved), and purple_block_2 is on the table (satisfies constraint 8).

Now, we need to check constraint 3: holding purple_block_1 and white_block_1 on purple_block_2. Currently, white_block_1 is under grey_block_1. So we need to move white_block_1 to purple_block_2.

But to move white_block_1, we need to first unstack grey_block_1 from it. Since grey_block_1 is clear (after step 9), we can:

11. unstack grey_block_1 from white_block_1. Hold grey.

12. putdown grey_block_1. Now grey is on the table.

13. pickup white_block_1. Hold white.

14. stack white_block_1 on purple_block_2 (which is on the table). Now white is on purple_block_2.

Now, we need to be holding purple_block_1 in some state. So:

15. unstack blue_block_1 from purple_block_1 (blue is on purple_block_1). Hold blue.

16. stack blue_block_1 somewhere, maybe on grey_block_1.

17. pickup purple_block_1. Now holding purple_block_1.

At this point, in step 14, white_block_1 is on purple_block_2. In step 17, holding purple_block_1. These are in different states. But constraint 3 requires both to be true in the same state. So we need to have a state where the agent is holding purple_block_1 and white_block_1 is on purple_block_2. 

So after step 14, white_block_1 is on purple_block_2. Then, to hold purple_block_1, we need to unstack blue_block_1 from purple_block_1. So:

15. unstack blue_block_1 from purple_block_1. Hold blue.

16. stack blue_block_1 on grey_block_1 (which is on the table).

17. unstack orange_block_1 from blue_block_1. Hold orange.

18. putdown orange_block_1.

19. pickup purple_block_1. Now holding purple_block_1.

At this state (step 19), white_block_1 is still on purple_block_2, and agent is holding purple_block_1. This satisfies constraint 3.

But this adds many steps. However, the problem requires an optimal plan. So this approach might be longer than necessary. Let's see if there's a shorter way.

Alternative approach: After step 10 (putdown purple_block_2), we have grey_block_1 clear (goal achieved). Now, to satisfy constraint 3, we need to have white_block_1 on purple_block_2 and hold purple_block_1. So perhaps during the process of unstacking purple_block_2, we can stack it elsewhere and move white_block_1 onto it.

Alternatively, after step 10, purple_block_2 is on the table. To get white_block_1 on purple_block_2:

- Unstack grey_block_1 from white_block_1 (now possible since grey is clear).

- Put grey_block_1 on the table.

- Pick up white_block_1 and stack it on purple_block_2.

Then, to hold purple_block_1:

- Unstack blue_block_1 from purple_block_1 (requires unstacking orange and blue first).

But this adds several steps. However, perhaps it's necessary.

Let me count the steps so far in this approach:

Steps 1-10: 10 steps.

Steps 11-14: unstack grey, putdown, pickup white, stack on purple_block_2. (4 steps)

Steps 15-19: unstack blue, stack on grey, unstack orange, putdown, pickup purple. (5 steps)

Total steps: 19. That's a lot. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, can we satisfy constraint 3 during the earlier steps? Let's think.

When we unstack purple_block_2 from grey_block_1 (step 9), we are holding it. Then we put it down (step 10). Now, to get white_block_1 on purple_block_2, we need to move white_block_1. But white_block_1 is under grey_block_1. So after step 9, grey_block_1 is clear. So we can unstack grey_block_1 from white_block_1 (step 11), put it down (step 12), then pickup white_block_1 (step 13), stack on purple_block_2 (step 14). Then, to hold purple_block_1, we need to unstack blue_block_1 from purple_block_1. But blue is under orange_block_1. So:

After step 6 (orange on blue), we can unstack orange_block_1 (step 7), put it down (step 8), then unstack blue_block_1 (step 9), then pickup purple_block_1 (step 10).

Wait, perhaps interleaving steps.

But this is getting too complicated. Given time constraints, perhaps the optimal plan is as follows:

But let's think of a shorter path. What if after achieving the main goal (grey_block_1 clear), we can handle the constraints in fewer steps.

For example, after step 10 (putdown purple_block_2), we need to:

- Make sure that in some state, we are holding purple_block_1 and white_block_1 is on purple_block_2.

To do this:

After step 10:

11. unstack grey_block_1 from white_block_1. Hold grey.

12. putdown grey_block_1.

13. pickup white_block_1.

14. stack white_block_1 on purple_block_2. Now white is on purple_block_2.

Now, to hold purple_block_1:

15. unstack orange_block_1 from blue_block_1 (orange is on blue, which is on purple_block_1). So:

15. unstack orange_block_1 from blue_block_1. Hold orange.

16. stack orange_block_1 somewhere (maybe on white_block_1).

17. unstack blue_block_1 from purple_block_1. Hold blue.

18. stack blue_block_1 on grey_block_1.

19. pickup purple_block_1. Now holding purple_block_1.

In step 14, white_block_1 is on purple_block_2. In step 19, holding purple_block_1. These are different states. So we need to have a state where both are true. So perhaps during step 19, white_block_1 is still on purple_block_2, and the agent is holding purple_block_1. Yes, that's true. Because step 14 is stacking white_block_1 on purple_block_2, and steps 15-19 are manipulating other blocks. So in step 19, white_block_1 remains on purple_block_2. So in step 19, the agent is holding purple_block_1 and white_block_1 is on purple_block_2. Thus satisfying constraint 3.

This would take 19 steps, but maybe there's a way to combine steps.

Alternatively, maybe during the initial steps, after unstacking purple_block_2, instead of putting it down, we can stack it on purple_block_1. But that would require purple_block_1 to be clear. Purple_block_1 has blue and orange on it. So:

After step 9 (holding purple_block_2), instead of step 10 (putdown), we can:

10. stack purple_block_2 on purple_block_1. But purple_block_1 has blue and orange on it. So not clear. So can't stack. Thus, not possible.

Alternative idea: Use the unstacking of purple_block_2 to satisfy constraint 9 (purple_block_2 on table or holding purple_block_1). Since after step 9, we are holding purple_block_2, which is not purple_block_1. So that doesn't help. But putting it on the table satisfies the first part of constraint 9 (purple_block_2 on table).

But constraint 3 requires holding purple_block_1. So regardless, we need to pickup purple_block_1 at some point.

Another way to satisfy constraint 3: While holding purple_block_2, stack it on white_block_1. But white_block_1 is under grey_block_1. So no.

Alternatively, after step 14 (white_block_1 on purple_block_2), and step 19 (holding purple_block_1), that's the state that satisfies constraint 3.

But this seems very long. Given that the problem requires an optimal plan, perhaps there's a shorter path.

Let me try to outline a possible optimal plan:

1. unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1. Hold blue.

2. stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_1. Now, orange has blue on top. This doesn't satisfy constraint 5 yet.

3. unstack orange_block_1 from purple_block_1. Hold orange.

4. stack orange_block_1 on blue_block_1. Now, orange is on blue, satisfying constraint 5.

5. unstack yellow_block_1 from purple_block_2. Hold yellow.

6. stack yellow_block_1 on orange_block_1.

7. unstack purple_block_2 from grey_block_1. Hold purple_block_2.

8. putdown purple_block_2. Now grey is clear (goal), and purple_block_2 is on table (satisfies constraint 8).

9. unstack grey_block_1 from white_block_1. Hold grey.

10. putdown grey_block_1.

11. pickup white_block_1.

12. stack white_block_1 on purple_block_2. Now white is on purple_block_2.

13. unstack blue_block_1 from orange_block_1. Hold blue.

14. stack blue_block_1 on grey_block_1.

15. pickup purple_block_1. Now holding purple_block_1.

In step 12, white_block_1 is on purple_block_2. In step 15, holding purple_block_1. So in step 15, both conditions are true (white on purple_block_2 and holding purple_block_1). This satisfies constraint 3.

Total steps: 15.

Checking constraints:

- Constraint 1: grey_block_1 is not on the table. After step 10, grey_block_1 is on the table. So in steps before step 10, grey_block_1 is not on the table (steps 1-9). So constraint 1 is satisfied in step 9.

- Constraint 2: Whenever grey_block_1 is not on the table (steps 1-9), then either blue_block_1 is not clear or purple_block_2 is clear. Let's check:

After step 7, purple_block_2 is clear (since we unstacked it from grey_block_1). So from step 7 onward, purple_block_2 is clear. So in steps 7-9, purple_block_2 is clear, satisfying the condition. For steps 1-6: grey_block_1 is not on the table, so we need to ensure that either blue_block_1 is not clear or purple_block_2 is clear during or after those steps.

In steps 1-6:

- After step 1, blue is on orange (step 2). So blue is not clear. So in step 2 onward, blue is not clear. So for steps 2-6, blue is not clear, satisfying the condition.

Thus, constraint 2 is satisfied.

- Constraint 3: In step 15, holding purple_block_1 and white_block_1 is on purple_block_2. Yes.

- Constraint 4: yellow_block_1 is never on the table. After step 6, yellow is stacked on orange. Yes.

- Constraint 5: orange_block_1 is on blue_block_1 in step 4. Yes.

- Constraint 6: blue_block_1 is never on the table. Yes.

- Constraint 7: white_block_1 is not clear in the initial state and steps 1-9. Yes.

- Constraint 8: in step 8, purple_block_2 is put on the table. Since white_block_1 was not clear in steps 1-9, and step 8 is after, this satisfies constraint 8.

- Constraint 9: in step 8, purple_block_2 is on the table. Yes.

This plan seems to satisfy all constraints with 15 steps. But maybe it can be shorter.

Wait, step 13-15: unstack blue from orange (step 13), stack on grey (step 14), pickup purple_block_1 (step 15). But after step 4, purple_block_1 is clear (since we unstacked orange in step 3 and stacked orange on blue in step 4). So purple_block_1 is clear. So after step 4, can we pickup purple_block_1 directly? Let's see:

After step 4:

4. stack orange_block_1 on blue_block_1. Now, orange is on blue, which is on purple_block_1. So purple_block_1 has blue and orange on it. Therefore, purple_block_1 is not clear. So we can't pickup purple_block_1 until it's cleared. Hence, steps 13-15 are necessary to clear purple_block_1 by moving blue and orange.

So this plan is necessary.

But perhaps there's a shorter way. Let's see:

Alternatively, after step 8 (putdown purple_block_2), can we immediately pickup purple_block_1? No, because purple_block_1 has blue and orange on it. So we need to clear it first.

Another idea: Combine some steps. For example, after step 4 (orange on blue), can we unstack blue_block_1 from purple_block_1 while holding orange? No, because to unstack blue, we need to have nothing in hand.

This seems unavoidable.

Overall, the plan I outlined with 15 steps seems to meet all constraints. But let's verify each step:

1. unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1. Preconditions: blue is clear, on yellow, hand empty. Correct.

2. stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_1. Preconditions: holding blue, orange is clear. Yes, orange was on purple_block_1 and was unstacked in step 3? Wait, no. Step 3 is after step 2. Wait, this plan may have an error.

Wait, in the plan outline I wrote earlier:

Step 1: unstack blue from yellow.

Step 2: stack blue on orange.

But at step 2, orange is still on purple_block_1. So orange is not clear. So stacking blue on orange is not possible. So this plan is incorrect.

Ah, this is a mistake. So step 2 is invalid because orange_block_1 is still on purple_block_1. Thus, the initial plan outline is flawed.

This shows the complexity of manually planning. Let's try to correct this.

Revised plan:

1. unstack orange_block_1 from purple_block_1. Now holding orange.

2. putdown orange_block_1.

3. unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1. Hold blue.

4. stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_1. Now purple_block_1 has blue.

5. pickup orange_block_1.

6. stack orange_block_1 on blue_block_1. Now orange is on blue, satisfying constraint 5.

7. unstack yellow_block_1 from purple_block_2. Hold yellow.

8. stack yellow_block_1 on orange_block_1.

9. unstack purple_block_2 from grey_block_1. Hold purple_block_2.

10. putdown purple_block_2. Now grey is clear.

11. unstack grey_block_1 from white_block_1. Hold grey.

12. putdown grey_block_1.

13. pickup white_block_1.

14. stack white_block_1 on purple_block_2.

15. unstack blue_block_1 from purple_block_1. Hold blue.

16. stack blue_block_1 on grey_block_1.

17. pickup purple_block_1. Now holding purple_block_1.

In step 14, white is on purple_block_2. In step 17, holding purple_block_1. So constraint 3 is satisfied.

Checking step 4: stacking blue on purple_block_1. Since purple_block_1 was cleared by step 1 (unstacking orange), yes.

This plan has 17 steps and satisfies all constraints. But maybe it's possible to optimize further.

Another approach:

Let's try to make sure that after unstacking purple_block_2, we put it on the table (to satisfy constraint 8), then manipulate other blocks to meet constraint 3.

But given time constraints, perhaps the correct answer is the following plan, ensuring all steps are valid and constraints are met.
