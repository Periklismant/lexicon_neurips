Let's break down the problem:

**Initial State:**
- white_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- purple_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2
- blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- orange_block_1 is clear
- blue_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

The structure looks like two towers:
1. white_block_1 -> grey_block_1 -> purple_block_2 -> yellow_block_1 -> blue_block_1
2. purple_block_1 -> orange_block_1

**Goal:**
- grey_block_1 is clear

**Constraints:**
1. "grey_block_1 is not on the table" must occur at least once.
2. If "grey_block_1 is not on the table" occurs, then "blue_block_1 is not clear" OR "purple_block_2 is clear" must be true afterwards.
3. "you are holding purple_block_1 AND white_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2" must occur at least once.
4. "yellow_block_1 is not on the table" must be true in every state.
5. "orange_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1" must occur at least once.
6. "blue_block_1 is not on the table" must be true in every state.
7. "white_block_1 is not clear" must occur at least once.
8. If "white_block_1 is not clear" occurs, then "purple_block_2 is on the table" must be true afterwards.
9. "purple_block_2 is on the table OR you are holding purple_block_1" must occur at least once.

Let's think about the goal first. To make grey_block_1 clear, we need to remove purple_block_2 from its top. And to do that, we need to first remove yellow_block_1 and blue_block_1. Here's a possible plan:

1. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1
2. putdown blue_block_1 (but this violates constraint 6 saying "blue_block_1 is not on the table" in every state)

So, we can't put blue_block_1 down on the table. Let's try stacking it somewhere else:

1. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1
2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1 (this satisfies constraint 5 "orange_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1" by its inverse)

Wait, that's not correct. The constraint is "orange_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1", not the other way around. Let's correct this:

1. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1
2. From here, blue_block_1 must not be placed on the table (constraint 6)
3. We can stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_1 temporarily.

Let's continue:
3. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2
4. Now, yellow_block_1 can't be put on the table (constraint 4)
5. We can stack yellow_block_1 on top of blue_block_1.
6. unstack purple_block_2 grey_block_1
7. Now, we can put purple_block_2 on the table (this might satisfy constraint 8).
8. We already have "grey_block_1 is not on the table" (it's on white_block_1), which satisfies constraint 1. But constraint 2 says if "grey_block_1 is not on the table", then "blue_block_1 is not clear" OR "purple_block_2 is clear" must be true afterwards. We can ensure "purple_block_2 is clear" by not stacking anything on it after we put it on the table.

For constraint 3, we need to have a state where "you are holding purple_block_1 AND white_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2". This requires some planning.

For constraint 9, we need a state where "purple_block_2 is on the table OR you are holding purple_block_1". We can ensure this by putting purple_block_2 on the table, which we already planned.

Let's refine our plan based on these constraints:

1. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1
2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1
3. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2
4. stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_2 grey_block_1 (now "purple_block_2 is on the table OR you are holding purple_block_1" is satisfied, supporting constraint 9)
6. putdown purple_block_2 (now "purple_block_2 is on the table" is satisfied, also supporting constraint 9)

At this point, we need to satisfy constraint 3: "you are holding purple_block_1 AND white_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2". And also constraint 5: "orange_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1"

Maybe we should place white_block_1 on top of purple_block_2 before we satisfy constraint 3 and constraint 5.

Let's continue our plan:

7. unstack orange_block_1 purple_block_1
8. stack orange_block_1 yellow_block_1

Wait, we're still having the issue of satisfying "you are holding purple_block_1" AND "white_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2" simultaneously. Let's rethink our plan.

To satisfy constraint 3, we need to first get white_block_1 on top of purple_block_2. white_block_1 is currently under grey_block_1. So, we need to first remove grey_block_1, then place white_block_1 on top of purple_block_2, and finally pick up purple_block_1.

But to remove grey_block_1, we need to first remove purple_block_2 from its top.

Let's try to outline the plan with these considerations:

1. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1
2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1
3. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2
4. stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_2 grey_block_1 (at this point, grey_block_1 is not on the table, so constraint 1 is satisfied)
6. putdown purple_block_2 (now "purple_block_2 is on the table" is satisfied, fulfilling the latter part of constraint 9)
7. unstack grey_block_1 white_block_1 (at this point, grey_block_1 is not on any block)
8. putdown grey_block_1 (this will make grey_block_1 clear, which is our goal)
9. pickup white_block_1
10. stack white_block_1 purple_block_2 (this is preparing for constraint 3)
11. unstack orange_block_1 purple_block_1 (this makes purple_block_1 clear)
12. pickup purple_block_1 (at this point, we have "you are holding purple_block_1" AND "white_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2", satisfying constraint 3)

So, at step 12, we have constraint 3 satisfied. We still need to satisfy constraint 5: "orange_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1". Currently, orange_block_1 is being held, so we need to place it on blue_block_1. However, blue_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on it, which needs to be removed first.

Let's continue our plan:

13. putdown purple_block_1 (now we are not holding any block)
14. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1 (this makes blue_block_1 clear)
15. stack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1 (this makes white_block_1 not clear, satisfying constraint 7)
16. pickup orange_block_1
17. stack orange_block_1 blue_block_1 (this satisfies constraint 5)

Wait, I think constraint 7 and 8 might be a bit tricky. Constraint 7 states "white_block_1 is not clear" must occur at least once, and constraint 8 states if "white_block_1 is not clear" occurs, then "purple_block_2 is on the table" must be true afterwards.

Since we are stacking white_block_1 on purple_block_2, it would be clear unless something is stacked on it. But we haven't planned to stack anything on white_block_1.

Let me reconsider our plan based on all constraints:

INITIAL STATE:
white_block_1 (on table) -> grey_block_1 -> purple_block_2 -> yellow_block_1 -> blue_block_1
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1

1. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1
2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1
3. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2
4. stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_2 grey_block_1
6. putdown purple_block_2
7. unstack grey_block_1 white_block_1
8. stack grey_block_1 purple_block_2 (this makes white_block_1 clear and satisfies the goal)
9. pickup white_block_1
10. stack white_block_1 grey_block_1 (this makes white_block_1 not clear, satisfying constraint 7, and at this point purple_block_2 is on the table, satisfying constraint 8)
11. unstack orange_block_1 purple_block_1
12. pickup purple_block_1 (satisfying constraint 9)
13. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
14. stack yellow_block_1 white_block_1 (keeping white_block_1 not clear)
15. pickup orange_block_1
16. stack orange_block_1 blue_block_1 (satisfying constraint 5)

Ok, there's a problem with the plan above. At step 11, we try to unstack orange_block_1 from purple_block_1. But in our prior steps, we've moved orange_block_1 (in step 2, we stacked blue_block_1 on orange_block_1). So orange_block_1 is not on purple_block_1 at step 11.

Let's recalibrate our plan:

INITIAL STATE:
white_block_1 (on table) -> grey_block_1 -> purple_block_2 -> yellow_block_1 -> blue_block_1
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1

1. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1
2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1 (blue_block_1 is on orange_block_1)
3. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2
4. stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is on blue_block_1)
5. unstack purple_block_2 grey_block_1
6. putdown purple_block_2 (purple_block_2 is on the table)
7. unstack grey_block_1 white_block_1
8. stack grey_block_1 purple_block_2 (grey_block_1 is on purple_block_2)
9. pickup white_block_1
10. stack white_block_1 grey_block_1 (white_block_1 is on grey_block_1)
11. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is held)
12. stack yellow_block_1 white_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is on white_block_1, making white_block_1 not clear)
13. unstack orange_block_1 purple_block_1 (orange_block_1 is held)

Oops, I'm still making the same mistake. Let's recalibrate again by keeping track of the positions of all blocks:

INITIAL STATE:
white_block_1 (on table) -> grey_block_1 -> purple_block_2 -> yellow_block_1 -> blue_block_1
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1

1. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1 (blue_block_1 is held, yellow_block_1 is on purple_block_2)
2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1 (blue_block_1 is on orange_block_1, orange_block_1 is on purple_block_1)

CURRENT STATE:
white_block_1 (on table) -> grey_block_1 -> purple_block_2 -> yellow_block_1
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1 -> blue_block_1

3. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2 (yellow_block_1 is held, purple_block_2 is on grey_block_1)
4. stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is on blue_block_1, blue_block_1 is on orange_block_1)

CURRENT STATE:
white_block_1 (on table) -> grey_block_1 -> purple_block_2
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> yellow_block_1

5. unstack purple_block_2 grey_block_1 (purple_block_2 is held, grey_block_1 is on white_block_1)
6. putdown purple_block_2 (purple_block_2 is on the table)

CURRENT STATE:
white_block_1 (on table) -> grey_block_1
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> yellow_block_1
purple_block_2 (on table)

7. unstack grey_block_1 white_block_1 (grey_block_1 is held, white_block_1 is on the table)
8. stack grey_block_1 purple_block_2 (grey_block_1 is on purple_block_2, purple_block_2 is on the table)

CURRENT STATE:
white_block_1 (on table)
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> yellow_block_1
purple_block_2 (on table) -> grey_block_1

9. pickup white_block_1 (white_block_1 is held)
10. stack white_block_1 grey_block_1 (white_block_1 is on grey_block_1, grey_block_1 is on purple_block_2)

CURRENT STATE:
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> yellow_block_1
purple_block_2 (on table) -> grey_block_1 -> white_block_1

I notice that grey_block_1 is not clear at this point (it has white_block_1 on it), which contradicts the goal. So, stacking white_block_1 on grey_block_1 (step 10) is not a good idea. Let's modify:

CURRENT STATE:
white_block_1 (on table)
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> yellow_block_1
purple_block_2 (on table) -> grey_block_1

9. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is held, blue_block_1 is on orange_block_1)
10. stack yellow_block_1 white_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is on white_block_1, white_block_1 is on the table)

CURRENT STATE:
white_block_1 (on table) -> yellow_block_1
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1 -> blue_block_1
purple_block_2 (on table) -> grey_block_1

11. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_1 (blue_block_1 is held, orange_block_1 is on purple_block_1)
12. putdown blue_block_1 (blue_block_1 is on the table)

Oops, constraint 6 says "blue_block_1 is not on the table" in every state, so we can't put it on the table. Modifying:

11. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_1 (blue_block_1 is held, orange_block_1 is on purple_block_1)
12. stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1 (blue_block_1 is on yellow_block_1, yellow_block_1 is on white_block_1)

CURRENT STATE:
white_block_1 (on table) -> yellow_block_1 -> blue_block_1
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1
purple_block_2 (on table) -> grey_block_1

13. pickup orange_block_1 (orange_block_1 is held, purple_block_1 is on the table)
14. stack orange_block_1 blue_block_1 (orange_block_1 is on blue_block_1, blue_block_1 is on yellow_block_1)

CURRENT STATE:
white_block_1 (on table) -> yellow_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> orange_block_1
purple_block_1 (on table)
purple_block_2 (on table) -> grey_block_1

If I check constraint 3: "you are holding purple_block_1 AND white_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2", I don't see how we can satisfy it with the current configuration. I need to ensure that white_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2.

Let's go back and modify our plan:

We start from the initial state:
white_block_1 (on table) -> grey_block_1 -> purple_block_2 -> yellow_block_1 -> blue_block_1
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1

1. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1 (blue_block_1 is held, yellow_block_1 is on purple_block_2)
2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1 (blue_block_1 is on orange_block_1, orange_block_1 is on purple_block_1)

CURRENT STATE:
white_block_1 (on table) -> grey_block_1 -> purple_block_2 -> yellow_block_1
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1 -> blue_block_1

3. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2 (yellow_block_1 is held, purple_block_2 is on grey_block_1)
4. stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is on blue_block_1, blue_block_1 is on orange_block_1)

CURRENT STATE:
white_block_1 (on table) -> grey_block_1 -> purple_block_2
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> yellow_block_1

5. unstack purple_block_2 grey_block_1 (purple_block_2 is held, grey_block_1 is on white_block_1)
6. putdown purple_block_2 (purple_block_2 is on the table)

CURRENT STATE:
white_block_1 (on table) -> grey_block_1
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> yellow_block_1
purple_block_2 (on table)

Let's have orange_block_1 on top of blue_block_1 now (constraint 5):

7. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is held, blue_block_1 is on orange_block_1)
8. putdown yellow_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is on the table)

Oops, constraint 4 says "yellow_block_1 is not on the table" in every state. Modifying:

7. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is held, blue_block_1 is on orange_block_1)
8. stack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is on grey_block_1, grey_block_1 is on white_block_1)

CURRENT STATE:
white_block_1 (on table) -> grey_block_1 -> yellow_block_1
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1 -> blue_block_1
purple_block_2 (on table)

9. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_1 (blue_block_1 is held, orange_block_1 is on purple_block_1)
10. unstack orange_block_1 purple_block_1 (orange_block_1 is held, purple_block_1 is on the table, blue_block_1 was put down somewhere—but due to constraint 6, we can't put it on the table)

I'm making a mistake here in step 9 & 10. I can't do two actions in a row where I'm holding a block. Let's revise:

9. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_1 (blue_block_1 is held, orange_block_1 is on purple_block_1)
10. stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1 (blue_block_1 is on yellow_block_1, yellow_block_1 is on grey_block_1)

CURRENT STATE:
white_block_1 (on table) -> grey_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 -> blue_block_1
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1
purple_block_2 (on table)

11. unstack orange_block_1 purple_block_1 (orange_block_1 is held, purple_block_1 is on the table)
12. stack orange_block_1 blue_block_1 (orange_block_1 is on blue_block_1, blue_block_1 is on yellow_block_1)

CURRENT STATE:
white_block_1 (on table) -> grey_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> orange_block_1
purple_block_1 (on table)
purple_block_2 (on table)

We need to get white_block_1 on top of purple_block_2 to satisfy constraint 3 (along with holding purple_block_1). So, we need to remove white_block_1 from its current position.

13. unstack orange_block_1 blue_block_1 (orange_block_1 is held, blue_block_1 is on yellow_block_1)
14. putdown orange_block_1 (orange_block_1 is on the table)

CURRENT STATE:
white_block_1 (on table) -> grey_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 -> blue_block_1
purple_block_1 (on table)
purple_block_2 (on table)
orange_block_1 (on table)

15. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1 (blue_block_1 is held, yellow_block_1 is on grey_block_1)
16. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1 (blue_block_1 is on orange_block_1, orange_block_1 is on the table)

Wait, I'm getting confused with all these steps. Let's approach this differently. 

Let's focus on satisfying constraint 3: "you are holding purple_block_1 AND white_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2".

We need:
1. white_block_1 on top of purple_block_2
2. Holding purple_block_1

For 1, white_block_1 is initially under grey_block_1. We need to free it.

For 2, purple_block_1 is initially under orange_block_1. We need to free it.

Let's work on 1 first:

1. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1
2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1
3. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2
4. stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_2 grey_block_1
6. putdown purple_block_2
7. unstack grey_block_1 white_block_1
8. stack grey_block_1 yellow_block_1
9. pickup white_block_1
10. stack white_block_1 purple_block_2

CURRENT STATE (after step 10):
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 -> grey_block_1
purple_block_2 (on table) -> white_block_1

Now, for 2:
11. unstack orange_block_1 purple_block_1
12. pickup purple_block_1

At this point, we have white_block_1 on top of purple_block_2 and we are holding purple_block_1, which satisfies constraint 3.

Let's make sure grey_block_1 is clear, which is our goal:

13. putdown purple_block_1
14. unstack grey_block_1 yellow_block_1
15. putdown grey_block_1

The goal is achieved, but we've not satisfied all constraints yet.

Let's check constraint 5: "orange_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1". We need to arrange for this.

16. pickup orange_block_1
17. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1
18. stack blue_block_1 white_block_1
19. stack orange_block_1 blue_block_1

I've realized we're going to exceed the number of actions a normal plan would take. And I'm making mistakes due to the constant shuffling. Let me try a systematic approach so I don't get lost, and to ensure I'm not missing any constraints.

Let me analyze the constraints once more:

1. "grey_block_1 is not on the table" must occur at least once. In the initial state, grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, so it's not on the table.
2. If "grey_block_1 is not on the table" occurs (which is true in the initial state), then "blue_block_1 is not clear" OR "purple_block_2 is clear" must be true afterwards. In the initial state, blue_block_1 is clear, and purple_block_2 is not clear, which contradicts the constraint.
3. "you are holding purple_block_1 AND white_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2" must occur at least once.
4. "yellow_block_1 is not on the table" must be true in every state.
5. "orange_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1" must occur at least once.
6. "blue_block_1 is not on the table" must be true in every state.
7. "white_block_1 is not clear" must occur at least once.
8. If "white_block_1 is not clear" occurs, then "purple_block_2 is on the table" must be true afterwards.
9. "purple_block_2 is on the table OR you are holding purple_block_1" must occur at least once.

Let's handle them one by one and create a clean plan.

First, let's visualize the initial state:
white_block_1 (on table) -> grey_block_1 -> purple_block_2 -> yellow_block_1 -> blue_block_1
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1

Constraint 1: "grey_block_1 is not on the table" must occur at least once.
In the initial state, grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, so it's not on the table. This constraint is satisfied.

Constraint 2: If "grey_block_1 is not on the table" occurs, then "blue_block_1 is not clear" OR "purple_block_2 is clear" must be true afterwards.
In the initial state, grey_block_1 is not on the table, but blue_block_1 is clear, and purple_block_2 is not clear. We need to ensure that one of these conditions changes.

Let's start our plan by making purple_block_2 clear:

1. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1 (blue_block_1 is held, yellow_block_1 is on purple_block_2)
2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1 (blue_block_1 is on orange_block_1, orange_block_1 is on purple_block_1)
3. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2 (yellow_block_1 is held, purple_block_2 is on grey_block_1)
4. stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is on blue_block_1, blue_block_1 is on orange_block_1)

CURRENT STATE:
white_block_1 (on table) -> grey_block_1 -> purple_block_2
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> yellow_block_1

At this point, grey_block_1 is not on the table, and purple_block_2 is clear, so constraint 2 is satisfied.

Next, let's work on constraint 3: "you are holding purple_block_1 AND white_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2" must occur at least once. This is a complex constraint, and we need to work towards it.

5. unstack purple_block_2 grey_block_1 (purple_block_2 is held, grey_block_1 is on white_block_1)
6. putdown purple_block_2 (purple_block_2 is on the table)

Regarding constraint 9: "purple_block_2 is on the table OR you are holding purple_block_1" must occur at least once. After step 6, purple_block_2 is on the table, so constraint 9 is satisfied.

7. unstack grey_block_1 white_block_1 (grey_block_1 is held, white_block_1 is on the table)
8. pickup white_block_1 (white_block_1 is held, this step assumes we've already put grey_block_1 somewhere)

Wait, I can't do step 8 right after step 7 because I'm already holding grey_block_1. I need to place grey_block_1 somewhere first.

7. unstack grey_block_1 white_block_1 (grey_block_1 is held, white_block_1 is on the table)
8. putdown grey_block_1 (grey_block_1 is on the table)
9. pickup white_block_1 (white_block_1 is held)
10. stack white_block_1 purple_block_2 (white_block_1 is on purple_block_2, purple_block_2 is on the table)

Regarding constraint 8: If "white_block_1 is not clear" occurs, then "purple_block_2 is on the table" must be true afterwards. At the end of step 10, white_block_1 is clear. I need to ensure that if at any point white_block_1 becomes not clear, purple_block_2 is on the table afterwards.

11. unstack orange_block_1 purple_block_1 (orange_block_1 is held, purple_block_1 is on the table)
12. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1 (orange_block_1 is on white_block_1, white_block_1 is on purple_block_2)

After step 12, white_block_1 is not clear (constraint 7 is satisfied). And purple_block_2 is on the table, so constraint 8 is also satisfied.

13. pickup purple_block_1 (purple_block_1 is held)

After step 13, we are holding purple_block_1 and white_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2, which satisfies constraint 3.

Our goal is to make grey_block_1 clear, which is already the case after step 8. So, the goal is achieved.

As for constraints 5: "orange_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1" must occur at least once, and 6: "blue_block_1 is not on the table" must be true in every state, we still need to arrange for constraint 5, and we've been ensuring blue_block_1 is not on the table throughout.

14. putdown purple_block_1 (purple_block_1 is on the table)
15. unstack orange_block_1 white_block_1 (orange_block_1 is held, white_block_1 is on purple_block_2)
16. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is held, blue_block_1 is on orange_block_1, But wait, we can't do this if we're already holding orange_block_1)

I realize we need to think about which blocks to hold at each step more carefully. let me continue from the initial state, but trying to satisfy all the constraints more carefully:

INITIAL STATE:
white_block_1 (on table) -> grey_block_1 -> purple_block_2 -> yellow_block_1 -> blue_block_1
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1

Let's ensure constraint 6 (blue_block_1 is not on the table) and 4 (yellow_block_1 is not on the table) throughout:

1. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1 (blue_block_1 is held, yellow_block_1 is on purple_block_2)
2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1 (blue_block_1 is on orange_block_1, orange_block_1 is on purple_block_1)

CURRENT STATE:
white_block_1 (on table) -> grey_block_1 -> purple_block_2 -> yellow_block_1
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1 -> blue_block_1

At this point, grey_block_1 is not on the table (satisfying constraint 1), and blue_block_1 is clear (as is the top of each tower).

3. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2 (yellow_block_1 is held, purple_block_2 is on grey_block_1)
4. stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is on blue_block_1, blue_block_1 is on orange_block_1)

CURRENT STATE:
white_block_1 (on table) -> grey_block_1 -> purple_block_2
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> yellow_block_1

At this point, grey_block_1 is not on the table, and purple_block_2 is clear, satisfying constraint 2.

5. unstack purple_block_2 grey_block_1 (purple_block_2 is held, grey_block_1 is on white_block_1)
6. putdown purple_block_2 (purple_block_2 is on the table)

CURRENT STATE:
white_block_1 (on table) -> grey_block_1
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> yellow_block_1
purple_block_2 (on table)

Constraint 9 (purple_block_2 is on the table OR you are holding purple_block_1) is now satisfied.

7. unstack grey_block_1 white_block_1 (grey_block_1 is held, white_block_1 is on the table)
8. putdown grey_block_1 (grey_block_1 is on the table)

CURRENT STATE:
white_block_1 (on table)
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> yellow_block_1
purple_block_2 (on table)
grey_block_1 (on table)

Our goal (grey_block_1 is clear) is now satisfied.

Now, let's focus on constraint 3 (you are holding purple_block_1 AND white_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2):

9. pickup white_block_1 (white_block_1 is held)
10. stack white_block_1 purple_block_2 (white_block_1 is on purple_block_2, purple_block_2 is on the table)

CURRENT STATE:
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> yellow_block_1
purple_block_2 (on table) -> white_block_1
grey_block_1 (on table)

11. unstack orange_block_1 purple_block_1 (orange_block_1 is held, purple_block_1 is on the table)
12. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1 (orange_block_1 is on white_block_1, white_block_1 is on purple_block_2)

CURRENT STATE:
purple_block_1 (on table)
purple_block_2 (on table) -> white_block_1 -> orange_block_1
grey_block_1 (on table)
blue_block_1 (on ???) -> yellow_block_1

I just realized I lost track of blue_block_1 after step 11 (it was previously on orange_block_1). Let me recalibrate.

CURRENT STATE after step 10:
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> yellow_block_1
purple_block_2 (on table) -> white_block_1
grey_block_1 (on table)

11. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is held, blue_block_1 is on orange_block_1)
12. stack yellow_block_1 white_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is on white_block_1, white_block_1 is on purple_block_2)

CURRENT STATE:
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1 -> blue_block_1
purple_block_2 (on table) -> white_block_1 -> yellow_block_1
grey_block_1 (on table)

Constraint 7 (white_block_1 is not clear) is now satisfied, and purple_block_2 is on the table, so constraint 8 is also satisfied.

13. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_1 (blue_block_1 is held, orange_block_1 is on purple_block_1)
14. stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1 (blue_block_1 is on yellow_block_1, yellow_block_1 is on white_block_1)

CURRENT STATE:
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1
purple_block_2 (on table) -> white_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 -> blue_block_1
grey_block_1 (on table)

15. unstack orange_block_1 purple_block_1 (orange_block_1 is held, purple_block_1 is on the table)
16. stack orange_block_1 blue_block_1 (orange_block_1 is on blue_block_1, blue_block_1 is on yellow_block_1)

CURRENT STATE:
purple_block_1 (on table)
purple_block_2 (on table) -> white_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> orange_block_1
grey_block_1 (on table)

Constraint 5 (orange_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1) is now satisfied.

17. pickup purple_block_1 (purple_block_1 is held)

CURRENT STATE:
purple_block_1 (held)
purple_block_2 (on table) -> white_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> orange_block_1
grey_block_1 (on table)

After step 17, we are holding purple_block_1 and white_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2, which satisfies constraint 3.

Wait, I think I might've misinterpreted constraint 3: "you are holding purple_block_1 AND white_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2". I interpreted it as "you are holding purple_block_1" AND "white_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2", but maybe it means white_block_1 is directly on top of purple_block_2?

Let's check the current state:
purple_block_1 (held)
purple_block_2 (on table) -> white_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> orange_block_1
grey_block_1 (on table)

white_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2, but not directly (there are blocks in between). Let me check if the constraint is satisfied.

Actually, "on top of" is typically interpreted in planning domains as "directly on top of." So, we need to ensure white_block_1 is directly on top of purple_block_2.

In our plan, after step 10, white_block_1 is directly on top of purple_block_2, but then we added yellow_block_1 on top of white_block_1, which means white_block_1 is no longer on top of purple_block_2. So, constraint 3 is not satisfied yet.

Let's adjust our plan:

After step 10, we have:
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> yellow_block_1
purple_block_2 (on table) -> white_block_1
grey_block_1 (on table)

11. pickup purple_block_1 (purple_block_1 is held)

After step 11, we are holding purple_block_1 and white_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2, which satisfies constraint 3.

12. putdown purple_block_1 (purple_block_1 is on the table)

CURRENT STATE:
purple_block_1 (on table)
purple_block_2 (on table) -> white_block_1
grey_block_1 (on table)
orange_block_1 (on table) -> blue_block_1 -> yellow_block_1

Wait, that's not correct. After step 10, we have:
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> yellow_block_1
purple_block_2 (on table) -> white_block_1
grey_block_1 (on table)

I said pickup purple_block_1, but I can't do that because it has orange_block_1 on top of it.

Let's backtrack and fix:

11. unstack orange_block_1 purple_block_1 (orange_block_1 is held, purple_block_1 is on the table)
12. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1 (orange_block_1 is on white_block_1, white_block_1 is on purple_block_2)

At this point, constraint 7 (white_block_1 is not clear) is satisfied, and purple_block_2 is on the table, so constraint 8 is also satisfied.

CURRENT STATE:
purple_block_1 (on table)
purple_block_2 (on table) -> white_block_1 -> orange_block_1
grey_block_1 (on table)
blue_block_1 (???) -> yellow_block_1

I've lost track of blue_block_1 again.

After step 10, we had:
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> yellow_block_1
purple_block_2 (on table) -> white_block_1
grey_block_1 (on table)

When we unstack orange_block_1 from purple_block_1 at step 11, blue_block_1 and yellow_block_1 come with it, because they're stacked on orange_block_1.

I think I've been making a fundamental error. In blocksworld, unstacking a block only removes that block, not all blocks above it. So, let me start fresh:

INITIAL STATE:
white_block_1 (on table) -> grey_block_1 -> purple_block_2 -> yellow_block_1 -> blue_block_1
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1

Let's satisfy our goal and constraints one by one:

1. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1 (blue_block_1 is held, yellow_block_1 is on purple_block_2)
2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1 (blue_block_1 is on orange_block_1, orange_block_1 is on purple_block_1)
3. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2 (yellow_block_1 is held, purple_block_2 is on grey_block_1)
4. stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is on blue_block_1, blue_block_1 is on orange_block_1)
5. unstack purple_block_2 grey_block_1 (purple_block_2 is held, grey_block_1 is on white_block_1)
6. putdown purple_block_2 (purple_block_2 is on the table)
7. unstack grey_block_1 white_block_1 (grey_block_1 is held, white_block_1 is on the table)
8. putdown grey_block_1 (grey_block_1 is on the table)
9. pickup white_block_1 (white_block_1 is held)
10. stack white_block_1 purple_block_2 (white_block_1 is on purple_block_2, purple_block_2 is on the table)
11. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is held, blue_block_1 is on orange_block_1)
12. stack yellow_block_1 white_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is on white_block_1, white_block_1 is on purple_block_2)
13. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_1 (blue_block_1 is held, orange_block_1 is on purple_block_1)
14. stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1 (blue_block_1 is on yellow_block_1, yellow_block_1 is on white_block_1)
15. unstack orange_block_1 purple_block_1 (orange_block_1 is held, purple_block_1 is on the table)
16. stack orange_block_1 blue_block_1 (orange_block_1 is on blue_block_1, blue_block_1 is on yellow_block_1)
17. pickup purple_block_1 (purple_block_1 is held)

CURRENT STATE:
purple_block_1 (held)
purple_block_2 (on table) -> white_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> orange_block_1
grey_block_1 (on table)

Let's check all constraints:
1. "grey_block_1 is not on the table" - satisfied in initial state.
2. If "grey_block_1 is not on the table", then "blue_block_1 is not clear" OR "purple_block_2 is clear" must be true afterwards. This is satisfied after step 3, where purple_block_2 is clear.
3. "you are holding purple_block_1 AND white_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2" - Not satisfied. At step 17, we're holding purple_block_1 but white_block_1 is not directly on top of purple_block_2; yellow_block_1 is on white_block_1.

I need to adjust the plan again.

Let's redo the plan from after step 10:

10. stack white_block_1 purple_block_2 (white_block_1 is on purple_block_2, purple_block_2 is on the table)
11. unstack orange_block_1 purple_block_1 (orange_block_1 is held, purple_block_1 is on the table)
12. pickup purple_block_1 (purple_block_1 is held, orange_block_1 was put down somewhere before this step)

We need to put orange_block_1 down before step 12:

11. unstack orange_block_1 purple_block_1 (orange_block_1 is held, purple_block_1 is on the table)
12. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1 (orange_block_1 is on white_block_1, white_block_1 is on purple_block_2)
13. pickup purple_block_1 (purple_block_1 is held)

CURRENT STATE:
purple_block_1 (held)
purple_block_2 (on table) -> white_block_1 -> orange_block_1
grey_block_1 (on table)
blue_block_1 (???) -> yellow_block_1

I've lost blue_block_1 and yellow_block_1 again.

Actually, let's go back to the start and lay out the plan step-by-step, focusing only on the required blocks for constraints:

INITIAL STATE:
white_block_1 (on table) -> grey_block_1 -> purple_block_2 -> yellow_block_1 -> blue_block_1
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1

First, ensure goal: "grey_block_1 is clear"
1. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1
2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1
3. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2
4. stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_2 grey_block_1 (now grey_block_1 is clear, but we need to satisfy other constraints)
6. putdown purple_block_2 (this satisfies constraint 9)

Now, satisfy constraint 3: "you are holding purple_block_1 AND white_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2"
7. unstack orange_block_1 purple_block_1
8. stack orange_block_1 yellow_block_1
9. unstack grey_block_1 white_block_1
10. stack grey_block_1 orange_block_1
11. pickup white_block_1
12. stack white_block_1 purple_block_2
13. pickup purple_block_1 (now holding purple_block_1 and white_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2, satisfying constraint 3)

Now, satisfy constraint 5: "orange_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1"
14. putdown purple_block_1
15. unstack grey_block_1 orange_block_1
16. stack grey_block_1 purple_block_1
17. unstack orange_block_1 yellow_block_1
18. unstack blue_block_1 purple_block_1
19. stack blue_block_1 grey_block_1
20. stack orange_block_1 blue_block_1 (now orange_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1, satisfying constraint 5)

Let's ensure constraint 7 and 8: "white_block_1 is not clear" and if so, "purple_block_2 is on the table"
21. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
22. stack yellow_block_1 white_block_1 (now white_block_1 is not clear, satisfying constraint 7, and purple_block_2 is already on the table, so constraint 8 is satisfied)

At the end, we have grey_block_1 clear, which is our goal. But this is a longer plan than needed.

After reflecting, I realize I've been overcomplicating things. Let's simplify and focus.

INITIAL STATE:
white_block_1 (on table) -> grey_block_1 -> purple_block_2 -> yellow_block_1 -> blue_block_1
purple_block_1 (on table) -> orange_block_1

GOAL: grey_block_1 is clear.

To achieve the goal, we need to empty everything above grey_block_1, which means removing blue_block_1, yellow_block_1, and purple_block_2.

1. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1
2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1
3. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2
4. stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_2 grey_block_1

Goal achieved! But let's ensure we satisfy all constraints:

6. putdown purple_block_2 (satisfies constraint 9)
7. unstack grey_block_1 white_block_1
8. putdown grey_block_1
9. pickup white_block_1
10. stack white_block_1 purple_block_2
11. unstack orange_block_1 purple_block_1
12. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1 (satisfies constraint 7, and constraint 8 is satisfied because purple_block_2 is on the table)
13. pickup purple_block_1 (satisfies constraint 3)
14. putdown purple_block_1
15. unstack orange_block_1 white_block_1
16. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
17. stack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
18. stack orange_block_1 blue_block_1 (satisfies constraint 5)

I think all constraints are now satisfied. Let's double-check:

Constraint 1: "grey_block_1 is not on the table" - satisfied in the initial state.
Constraint 2: If "grey_block_1 is not on the table", then "blue_block_1 is not clear" OR "purple_block_2 is clear" - satisfied after step 3, where purple_block_2 is clear.
Constraint 3: "you are holding purple_block_1 AND white_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2" - satisfied after step 13.
Constraint 4: "yellow_block_1 is not on the table" - satisfied throughout.
Constraint 5: "orange_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1" - satisfied after step
Constraint 6: "blue_block_1 is not on the table" - satisfied throughout.
Constraint 7: "white_block_1 is not clear" - satisfied after step 12 and after step 17.
Constraint 8: If "white_block_1 is not clear", then "purple_block_2 is on the table" - satisfied because purple_block_2 is on the table after step 6.
Constraint 9: "purple_block_2 is on the table OR you are holding purple_block_1" - satisfied after step 6 and step 13.

Alright, I think our plan satisfies all constraints. Let's summarize:

```
unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1
stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1
unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2
stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
unstack purple_block_2 grey_block_1
putdown purple_block_2
unstack grey_block_1 white_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
pickup white_block_1
stack white_block_1 purple_block_2
unstack orange_block_1 purple_block_1
stack orange_block_1 white_block_1
pickup purple_block_1
putdown purple_block_1
unstack orange_block_1 white_block_1
unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
stack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
stack orange_block_1 blue_block_1
```

The goal is achieved (grey_block_1 is clear) and all constraints are satisfied.
