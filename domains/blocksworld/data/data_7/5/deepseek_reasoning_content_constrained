Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld problem. The goal is to get green_block_2 on top of orange_block_1, but there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy. First, I need to understand the initial state and all the requirements.

Starting with the initial state:
- orange_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_1 on top (and purple is clear).
- brown_block_1 is on the table with red_block_1 on top (red is clear).
- green_block_1 is on the table with grey_block_1 on top (grey is clear).
- green_block_2 is on the table and clear.
- The arm is empty.

The goal is green_block_2 on orange_block_1. So, I need to move green_block_2 to orange_block_1. But orange_block_1 currently has purple_block_1 on it. So, first, I might need to move purple_block_1 somewhere else to free up orange_block_1. But there's a constraint that purple_block_1 must be on the table at some point. Also, when purple_block_1 is put on the table, there's a precondition that in an earlier state, either orange_block_1 is on grey_block_1 or the arm is holding orange_block_1. Since orange_block_1 is on the table initially, maybe we need to pick it up? But that might not be necessary. Wait, if we put purple_block_1 on the table, the action would be putdown or stack. Wait, no: to move purple_block_1 from orange_block_1 to the table, we need to unstack it. Let's see.

To unstack purple_block_1 from orange_block_1:
Preconditions: purple is on orange, purple is clear, and arm is empty. All true initially. So unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1. Then, the arm is holding purple_block_1. Then, we can put it down. But putting it down would satisfy the constraint that purple_block_1 is on the table at some state. So that's one of the constraints. But when we put it down, we need to check the other constraint: if purple_block_1 is on the table, then in an earlier state, either orange is on grey or the arm is holding orange. Wait, the initial state has orange on the table. So putting purple on the table would require that in an earlier state, either orange is on grey (which it's not) or the arm is holding orange. So if we just unstack purple and put it down, then the state where purple is on the table would require that in an earlier state (before that action), the arm was holding orange. But when we unstack purple, the arm is holding purple, not orange. So that's a problem. Therefore, we need to satisfy that constraint when we put purple on the table.

So, the constraint says: if purple is on the table in some state, then in an earlier state, either orange is on grey_block_1 or the arm was holding orange. Since initially orange is on the table, not on grey. So, to satisfy this, before putting purple on the table, we need to have a state where the arm is holding orange_block_1. But how? Because orange is under purple. So to pick up orange, we need to first remove purple. But if we unstack purple from orange, then orange is clear. Then, can we pick up orange? But orange is on the table. So after unstacking purple, orange is on the table and clear. So we could then pickup orange. But then, the arm would be holding orange. So maybe the sequence is:

1. Unstack purple_block_1 from orange_block_1. Now holding purple.
2. Putdown purple_block_1. Now purple is on the table. But to do this, the constraint requires that in an earlier state (before putting purple down), the arm was holding orange or orange was on grey. At the time of putting purple down, the previous states are step 1 and initial. In step 1, the arm was holding purple. Initial state: orange is on table. So this doesn't satisfy the constraint. Therefore, putting purple down directly after unstacking would violate the constraint. So we need a different approach.

Alternative plan: After unstacking purple, instead of putting it down immediately, we need to somehow get the arm to hold orange_block_1. But how? Because after unstacking purple, orange is clear. So we can pickup orange_block_1. But then, to do that, the arm needs to be empty. After unstacking purple, the arm is holding purple. So first, putdown purple, then pickup orange. But then putting purple down would already trigger the constraint, which requires that before putting purple down, we have a state where arm holds orange. But when we put purple down (step 2), the earlier state (step1) has the arm holding purple, not orange. So that's not sufficient.

Wait, maybe the order is different. Let's see:

If after unstacking purple (step1), we need to put it somewhere else, but before putting it down, we have to have a state where the arm is holding orange. So perhaps:

1. Unstack purple from orange. Arm holds purple.
2. Stack purple onto some other block. But which one? Let's see the other constraints.

Another constraint is that there must be a state where purple is not clear (i.e., something is on top of purple). Also, when that happens, there must have been an earlier state where either brown_block_1 is clear or green_block_2 is on purple.

Also, there's a constraint that the arm must hold green_block_2 at some state, and after that, the arm must hold purple_block_1 at the same or later state. Also, holding purple_block_1 requires that in an earlier state, the arm held red_block_1.

Another constraint: there must be a state where green_block_2 is not clear (something is on top of it), and when that's true, there must have been an earlier state where the arm held green_block_1 or grey is on orange.

Also, there's a constraint that brown_block_1 must have a block on top at some state, and when that happens, either grey is on orange or orange is not on the table (which would be true if we move orange, but orange starts on the table and is under purple).

Additionally, there's a constraint that green_block_1 is not on brown_block_1. Initially, green_block_1 is on the table, so this is already true. But maybe after moving, we need to ensure that this remains the case. But perhaps the constraint is that in some state, green_block_1 is not on brown_block_1, which is already true. But the conditional says if that's true in a state, then in that state or after, either green_block_1 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not on the table. So as long as they are both on the table, the condition must be met. But since initially both are on the table, but the constraint is already satisfied because green_block_1 is not on brown_block_1. So perhaps this constraint is automatically satisfied.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline the necessary steps considering all constraints.

Main goal: green_block_2 on orange_block_1.

Steps needed:

- Clear orange_block_1 (currently has purple_block_1 on it). So need to move purple_block_1.

- Then, place green_block_2 on orange_block_1.

But to place green_block_2 on orange, we need to have green_block_2 in the arm, and orange_block_1 must be clear. So after moving purple_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear. So steps:

1. Unstack purple_block_1 from orange_block_1. (Now holding purple)
2. Putdown purple_block_1. (But this would require that before putting down, either orange was on grey or the arm was holding orange. Which we don't have. So this violates a constraint.)

So we need to find another way to move purple_block_1 such that when we put it on the table, the prior condition is met. The prior condition is that before putting purple on the table, there's a state where either orange is on grey or the arm is holding orange.

So perhaps:

After unstacking purple (step1), we need to get the arm to hold orange. But after step1, the arm is holding purple. So we need to put down purple first, then pick up orange. But putting down purple would require that prior to that, the arm held orange or orange was on grey.

But if we do:

1. Unstack purple from orange. (Arm has purple)
2. Putdown purple. (Now purple is on table. But this triggers the constraint that before this, the arm was holding orange or orange was on grey. Neither is true here. So invalid.)

Alternative approach: After unstacking purple, don't put it down immediately. Instead, stack it somewhere else. But where? Let's see.

Suppose we stack purple on another block. Let's say brown_block_1. But brown_block_1 has red_block_1 on it. So to stack purple on brown_block_1, we need to clear brown_block_1 first. So:

1. Unstack red_block_1 from brown_block_1. (Now holding red)
2. Putdown red_block_1. (Now red is on table, clear)
3. Stack purple_block_1 on brown_block_1. (Now purple is on brown, brown has purple on top, which satisfies the constraint that there's a block on top of brown_block_1. Also, purple is not clear (if something is stacked on it later). But we need to check other constraints.

But this might complicate things. Let's see the constraints again.

Another constraint: The arm must hold green_block_2 at some point, and after that, hold purple_block_1. So we need to sequence holding green_block_2 and then purple.

Also, holding purple requires that in an earlier state, the arm held red_block_1.

So perhaps:

- First, unstack red_block_1 from brown_block_1. Then, hold red. Then, putdown red. Then, later, when we need to hold purple, we can satisfy the condition that we held red before.

But how does that connect?

Let's outline steps:

1. Unstack red_block_1 from brown_block_1. (Holding red)
   - This satisfies the constraint that in some state, the arm holds red, which is needed before holding purple.
   - Then putdown red_block_1.

Now red is on the table. Then, proceed to unstack purple from orange.

But then when we unstack purple, we can stack it somewhere else. Maybe stack purple on red_block_1. But red is on the table and clear. So stacking purple on red would make red not clear.

But let's see:

2. Unstack purple_block_1 from orange_block_1. (Holding purple)
3. Stack purple_block_1 on red_block_1. (Now purple is on red, red is under purple. So purple is clear, red is not.)

But stacking requires that the target block (red) is clear. After step1, red is on the table and clear. So step3 is valid.

This way, purple is not on the table, so the constraint that purple must be on the table at some state isn't satisfied yet. So we need to put it on the table later. But when we do that, we have to ensure that before that, the arm held orange or orange was on grey.

Alternatively, maybe we can put purple on the table after stacking it on red, but that would require unstacking again. Hmm.

Alternatively, let's consider that purple needs to be on the table at some point. So after step3 (stacking purple on red), we might need to unstack it again and put it down. But that's more steps. Let's see.

But perhaps there's a better way. Let's try to satisfy the purple on the table constraint first.

Suppose we need to put purple on the table. To do that, after unstacking it, we need to have held orange_block_1 earlier. So:

1. Unstack purple_block_1 from orange_block_1. (Holding purple)
2. Now, to put down purple, we need to have held orange_block_1 before. But how?

Wait, maybe we can't put purple down until we have held orange. So after step1, we need to put purple somewhere temporarily, then pick up orange, then put purple down.

Like:

1. Unstack purple from orange. (Hold purple)
2. Stack purple on some block, say green_block_2 (which is on table and clear). Stack purple_block_1 green_block_2. Now purple is on green_block_2, making green_block_2 not clear. This satisfies the constraint that green_block_2 has a block on top at some state. Then, for that state, the earlier condition is that the arm held green_block_1 or grey is on orange. Hmm, but stacking purple on green_block_2 would require that the arm is holding purple (which it is) and that green_block_2 is clear (which it is). So valid.

After step2, purple is on green_block_2. Now, to get orange_block_1, which is clear, we can pickup orange_block_1. So:

3. Pickup orange_block_1. (Now holding orange)
4. Putdown orange_block_1. (This would make orange on table again, clear. But why do this? Because we need to have held orange before putting purple on the table. Wait, after step3, the arm is holding orange. Then, if we proceed to unstack purple from green_block_2 and put it down, then when we put it down, the condition that in an earlier state the arm held orange is satisfied (since step3 was before).

So:

5. Unstack purple_block_1 from green_block_2. (Holding purple)
6. Putdown purple_block_1. (Now purple is on table. This is allowed because step3 (holding orange) was before this. So the constraint is satisfied.)

But this seems lengthy. Let's check if this works.

But the goal is green_block_2 on orange_block_1. After step6, orange_block_1 is on the table (from step4). So we need to place green_block_2 on it. But green_block_2 is under purple in step2. Wait, no: in step2, we stacked purple on green_block_2. Then in step5, we unstack purple from green_block_2, so green_block_2 is clear again. Then, after step6, green_block_2 is on table and clear. So then:

7. Pickup green_block_2. (Now holding it)
8. Stack green_block_2 on orange_block_1. (Which is on table and clear after step4.)

This would achieve the goal. But we also have to satisfy the constraint that after holding green_block_2, the arm must hold purple at some point. So after step7, we need to hold purple again. But after step8, the arm is empty. So perhaps after step8, we need to do something else. But the plan is supposed to be optimal. Let's see.

Wait, the constraint says: if you are holding green_block_2 in some state s, then you must hold purple_block_1 in s or after. So after step7 (holding green_block_2), we need to hold purple at some point after. But in this plan, after step7, we stack green_block_2, then the arm is empty. So we need to hold purple again later. But how? Because the goal is already achieved. Unless there's another step needed.

Alternatively, maybe we can hold purple after stacking green_block_2. For example:

After step8 (stack green_block_2 on orange), then:

9. Pickup purple_block_1 (which is on the table from step6). Then put it down again. But this would be unnecessary steps, making the plan longer. But the constraint requires that after holding green_block_2, we must hold purple at some point. So steps 7-9 would satisfy that. But this adds steps. Is there a way to combine this?

Alternatively, after step5 (holding purple), instead of putting it down (step6), we could stack it somewhere else, but then we need to hold green_block_2, which is under purple. Hmm.

This is getting too complicated. Let's try to outline a possible plan step by step, considering all constraints.

Let's list all constraints again:

1. At least one state where purple_block_1 is not clear (has a block on top).
   - Need to stack something on purple.
2. If purple is not clear, then earlier state where brown_block_1 is clear OR green_block_2 is on purple.
3. At least one state where purple is on table.
4. If purple is on table, earlier state where orange is on grey or arm holds orange.
5. At least one state where green_block_2 is not clear.
6. If green_block_2 is not clear, earlier state where arm holds green_block_1 OR grey is on orange.
7. At least one state where arm holds green_block_2.
8. If arm holds green_block_2 in state s, then arm must hold purple in s or later.
9. At least one state where arm holds purple.
10. If arm holds purple, earlier state where arm held red.
11. At least one state where brown_block_1 has a block on top.
12. If brown_block_1 has a block on top in state s, then in s or later, grey is on orange OR orange is not on table.
13. At least one state where green_block_1 is not on brown_block_1 (already true initially).
14. If green_block_1 is not on brown_block_1 in state s, then in s or later, green_block_1 not on table OR brown_block_1 not on table.

So, let's try to hit all these constraints.

Starting with the main goal: green_block_2 on orange_block_1.

To get there, need to move purple from orange. So first, unstack purple from orange. But then, after that, we need to handle the constraints.

Let's start:

1. Unstack purple_block_1 from orange_block_1. (Holding purple)
   - Now, orange is clear, purple is in arm.
   - This action requires that purple is clear (which it was) and arm is empty (which it was). Valid.

Now, we need to put purple somewhere. To satisfy constraint 3 (purple on table), we can put it down, but that requires that before putting it down, we have held orange or orange was on grey. So after step1, we need to handle that.

So maybe after unstacking purple, we need to pick up orange:

But after step1, arm is holding purple. So we need to put purple down first, then pick up orange, but that would require violating constraint4 when putting purple down.

Alternative plan: After step1, stack purple on another block. Let's choose brown_block_1. But brown_block_1 has red_block_1 on it. So first, unstack red from brown.

2. Unstack red_block_1 from brown_block_1. (Holding red)
   - Preconditions: red is on brown, red is clear, arm is empty. All true after step1 (arm is empty after step1? No, after step1, arm is holding purple. Wait, no. Step1 is unstack purple, so arm is holding purple. So step2 can't be done unless we put down purple first.

So perhaps:

1. Unstack purple from orange. (Holding purple)
2. Putdown purple. (But this would violate constraint4 unless we first held orange or orange was on grey. So invalid.)

Thus, we need to find another way. Let's instead, after unstacking purple (step1), stack it onto another block, but that block must be clear. So possible candidates: green_block_2 (on table and clear). So:

2. Stack purple_block_1 green_block_2. (Now purple is on green_block_2, green_block_2 is not clear. This satisfies constraint5 (green_block_2 not clear) and the condition for constraint6: when green_block_2 is not clear, earlier state had arm hold green_block_1 or grey on orange. But initially, grey is on green_block_1, which is on table. So grey is on green_block_1, not on orange. So to satisfy constraint6, we need to have either held green_block_1 earlier or have grey on orange. Since we haven't moved grey yet, perhaps we need to move grey onto orange.

But that's a lot. Let's see:

After step2, green_block_2 has purple on it. So constraint5 is satisfied. For constraint6, we need an earlier state where arm held green_block_1 or grey is on orange. Since we haven't done anything with green_block_1 or grey, neither is true. So this violates constraint6. Therefore, stacking purple on green_block_2 would make constraint6 violated.

Thus, this approach won't work. So we need to ensure that when green_block_2 is not clear (due to purple being on it), there was an earlier state where arm held green_block_1 or grey is on orange.

To have an earlier state where grey is on orange, we would need to move grey from green_block_1 to orange. But grey is on green_block_1 initially. So steps:

a. Unstack grey from green_block_1. (Holding grey)
b. Stack grey on orange. Now grey is on orange, satisfying the condition for constraint6.

But then, when we stack purple on green_block_2, the earlier state (step a and b) would have grey on orange, satisfying constraint6.

So integrating this into the plan:

1. Unstack grey_block_1 from green_block_1. (Holding grey)
2. Stack grey_block_1 orange_block_1. (Now grey is on orange, orange has grey on top. But initially, orange had purple on top. Wait, no, initially, orange has purple on top. So to unstack grey, which is on green_block_1, we can do that.

Wait, the initial state has grey_block_1 on green_block_1. So step1 is unstack grey from green. Then step2 stack grey on orange. Now, orange has grey on top. But our main goal is to put green_block_2 on orange, so we need to clear orange again. But this adds steps. However, doing this would satisfy the constraint6 when we later have green_block_2 not clear (if we stack something on green_block_2).

Then, proceeding:

3. Unstack purple_block_1 from orange_block_1. (Now orange has grey, but wait: after step2, grey is on orange. So purple is still on orange? No, no. Initially, orange has purple on top. After step1 and 2, grey is on orange, but purple is still on orange? No, initial state: orange has purple on top. So steps1 and 2 would not affect that. Wait, no. The initial state is:

- orange_block_1 is on table with purple on top.
- green_block_1 is on table with grey on top.

So step1 is unstack grey from green_block_1. Then stack grey on orange_block_1. Now, orange has purple and grey? No, blocks can only have one block on top. So when you stack grey on orange, you need to have orange clear. But initially, orange has purple on it. So step2 is impossible unless you first remove purple.

This complicates things. So the initial plan to stack grey on orange is not possible unless we first remove purple from orange.

So back to square one.

Alternative approach:

Let's try to satisfy the constraints step by step.

First, the arm must hold green_block_2 (constraint7), and after that, hold purple (constraint8). Also, holding purple requires having held red earlier (constraint10). So steps involving red must come before holding purple.

Also, there must be a state where brown_block_1 has a block on top (constraint11), and when that happens, either grey is on orange or orange is not on the table (constraint12). Since orange is initially on the table, if we put something on brown_block_1, we need to ensure that later, either grey is on orange or orange is moved.

Let's attempt to build the plan:

First, handle red and purple:

1. Unstack red_block_1 from brown_block_1. (Holding red)
   - Satisfies the need to have held red before holding purple (constraint10).
2. Putdown red_block_1. (Now red is on table, clear)
3. Unstack purple_block_1 from orange_block_1. (Holding purple)
   - Now, orange is clear.
4. Stack purple_block_1 on red_block_1. (Purple on red, red is not clear)
   - Now, purple is on red, so purple is not on table. But constraint3 requires purple to be on table at some point. So later, we need to move purple to table.
5. Later, unstack purple from red and put it down. But before putting it down, we need to have held orange or orange on grey.

But how to do that.

After step4, purple is on red. To put purple on the table, we need to unstack it:

6. Unstack purple_block_1 from red_block_1. (Holding purple)
7. Now, to putdown purple, we need an earlier state where arm held orange or orange is on grey. So we need to pick up orange after step6.

But after step6, arm is holding purple. So:

7. Putdown purple_block_1. (But this would violate constraint4 unless we have held orange before.)

So alternative steps after step6:

7. Stack purple_block_1 on some other block. Maybe brown_block_1, which is clear after step1. Because brown_block_1 had red, which was moved in step1. So brown_block_1 is clear.

7. Stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1. (Now brown_block_1 has purple on top. This satisfies constraint11 (brown has a block on top). Then, according to constraint12, in this state or later, either grey is on orange or orange is not on table. So we need to arrange for that.

To satisfy constraint12, after stacking purple on brown_block_1, we need to either move grey to orange or move orange off the table. But orange is currently clear (from step3). So we could pick up orange and put it elsewhere.

8. Pickup orange_block_1. (Holding orange)
9. Stack orange_block_1 somewhere. Maybe on grey_block_1. But grey is on green_block_1. So:

9. Unstack grey_block_1 from green_block_1. (Holding grey)
10. Putdown grey_block_1. (Now grey is on table)
11. Stack orange_block_1 on grey_block_1. (Now orange is on grey, which is on table. This makes orange not on table, satisfying constraint12's alternative condition.)

But this is getting very long. Let's see if this works.

At this point, brown_block_1 has purple (step7), and orange is on grey (step11). So in state after step7, brown_block_1 has a block on top (purple), and in step11, orange is not on table. So constraint12 is satisfied.

Now, returning to the main goal: green_block_2 on orange_block_1. But orange is now on grey. So we need to move green_block_2 to orange, which is on grey. But the goal is to have green_block_2 on orange_block_1, regardless of where orange is. Wait, no: the goal is "green_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1". So orange can be anywhere, as long as green is on top. So if orange is on grey, then green on orange is acceptable. But perhaps the goal requires orange to be on the table. Let me check the problem statement.

The goal is to have "green_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1". The problem doesn't specify where orange_block_1 should be, so it's acceptable for orange to be on another block as long as green is on top.

But in the current steps, orange is on grey, which is on the table. So to place green on orange, we need to have orange clear. So after step11, orange is on grey and has nothing on top (since it was just stacked). So:

12. Pickup green_block_2. (Holding green_block_2)
    - Now, constraint7 is satisfied (arm holds green_block_2).
13. Stack green_block_2 orange_block_1. (Now green is on orange, which is on grey. This achieves the goal.)

But after step13, we need to ensure that the arm holds purple at some point after holding green_block_2 (constraint8). Currently, after step13, the arm is empty. So we need to do:

14. Pickup purple_block_1. (From brown_block_1, which is under purple from step7)
    - But purple is on brown_block_1, which is clear (since we stacked purple on it in step7). So unstack purple from brown_block_1.
14. Unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1. (Holding purple)
    - Now, arm holds purple. This satisfies constraint8 (after holding green_block_2 in step12, we hold purple in step14).

Additionally, constraint9 requires that the arm holds purple at least once (satisfied by steps3,6,14).

Constraint10: holding purple requires having held red earlier. We held red in step1, which is before steps3,6,14. So that's satisfied.

Constraint3: purple must be on table at least once. But in our current plan, purple is on red (step4), then on brown (step7), then in arm (step14). So it's never on the table. Thus, this plan violates constraint3. So we need to adjust.

Ah, right. We need to have purple on the table at some point. So in the current plan, we never put purple on the table. So we need to add that.

Let's adjust the plan:

After step14 (holding purple), we can put it down:

15. Putdown purple_block_1. Now purple is on table. This satisfies constraint3. But when we put it down (step15), we need to ensure that in an earlier state, the arm held orange or orange was on grey. In this case, in step8, we picked up orange, which means the arm held orange. Step8 is before step15. So this satisfies constraint4.

So steps up to 15:

1. Unstack red_block_1 brown_block_1. (Hold red)
2. Putdown red.
3. Unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1. (Hold purple)
4. Stack purple red.
5. Unstack purple red. (Hold purple)
6. Stack purple brown_block_1.
7. Pickup orange_block_1.
8. Unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1.
9. Putdown grey.
10. Stack orange grey.
11. Pickup green_block_2.
12. Stack green_block_2 orange.
13. Unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1. (Hold purple)
14. Putdown purple.

This way, purple is on the table in step14, and in step7, the arm held orange (step7 is before step14). So constraint4 is satisfied.

Now, checking other constraints:

- Constraint1: purple_block_1 is not clear (has a block on top). This happens when purple is stacked on red (step4) and on brown (step6). So satisfied.

- Constraint2: If purple is not clear (step4 or step6), then earlier state where brown_block_1 is clear or green_block_2 is on purple. For step4 (purple on red), the earlier state is step3 (arm holds purple). Brown_block_1 was cleared in step1. So in step4, brown_block_1 is clear (after step1, red is put down, brown is clear). So when purple is stacked on red (step4), brown_block_1 is clear. So satisfies constraint2. Similarly for step6 (purple on brown), the earlier state would have brown_block_1 clear (step5?), which is true because after step1, brown is clear, and before step6, it's still clear. So constraint2 is satisfied.

- Constraint5: green_block_2 is not clear. This happens in step12 when green is stacked on orange. But green_block_2 is on top of orange, so green is clear. Wait, no. If green is stacked on orange, then green is clear (since nothing is on top), but orange has green on top. So green_block_2 is clear. So this does not satisfy constraint5. Oops. So we need to have something on top of green_block_2.

Ah, right. So in the current plan, green_block_2 is on orange, but nothing is on green_block_2, so it's clear. So constraint5 is not satisfied. We need to have a state where green_block_2 is not clear.

So we need to stack something on green_block_2. But how?

Maybe after step12, we need to put something on green_block_2. But that would require another block. Let's think.

Alternatively, before step11 (picking up green_block_2), we can stack something on it. For example, after step3 (holding purple), stack purple on green_block_2. Let's see:

Adjusting the plan:

1. Unstack red_block_1 brown_block_1. (Hold red)
2. Putdown red.
3. Unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1. (Hold purple)
4. Stack purple green_block_2. (Now green_block_2 has purple on top, making it not clear. This satisfies constraint5.)
   - Then, to satisfy constraint6: when green_block_2 is not clear (step4), there must have been an earlier state where arm held green_block_1 or grey on orange. At this point, grey is still on green_block_1. So to satisfy constraint6, we need to have either held green_block_1 before step4 or have grey on orange. Since we haven't done that yet, this would violate constraint6. Thus, need to adjust.

To satisfy constraint6 when green_block_2 is not clear (step4), we need to have earlier held green_block_1 or have grey on orange.

So before step4, we need to move grey to orange or hold green_block_1.

Let's insert steps:

After step3:

3a. Unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1. (Hold grey)
3b. Stack grey_block_1 orange_block_1. (Grey is on orange, which is on table)
3c. Now, orange has grey on top, so we can't stack purple on orange. So we need to stack purple elsewhere, like green_block_2.

Then proceed:

4. Stack purple green_block_2. (Now green_block_2 has purple, which is not clear. Satisfies constraint5. Also, in step3b, grey is on orange, which satisfies constraint6's condition.)

Now, after step4, green_block_2 has purple, which is not clear. The earlier state (step3b) has grey on orange, so constraint6 is satisfied.

Continuing the plan:

5. Unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2. (Hold purple)
6. Stack purple_block_1 red_block_1. (Purple on red)
7. Unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1. (Hold purple)
8. Stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1. (Purple on brown, satisfying constraint11)
9. Pickup orange_block_1. (Can't, because orange has grey on top from step3b. So need to unstack grey first.)
9. Unstack grey_block_1 orange_block_1. (Hold grey)
10. Putdown grey_block_1. (Grey on table)
11. Pickup orange_block_1. (Now holding orange)
12. Stack orange_block_1 grey_block_1. (Orange on grey)
13. Pickup green_block_2. (Holding green_block_2)
14. Stack green_block_2 orange_block_1. (Green on orange, which is on grey)
15. Unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1. (Hold purple)
16. Putdown purple_block_1. (Satisfies constraint3. Before this, step11 held orange, so constraint4 satisfied.)

But this is getting very long. Let's check if all constraints are met:

- Constraint1: purple not clear (steps4,6,8)
- Constraint2: when purple not clear (steps4,6,8), earlier state with brown clear or green on purple. For step4: brown was cleared in step1 (red unstacked), so brown is clear. So satisfied. For steps6 and8, brown may be clear or not. But step8 puts purple on brown, which was clear after step1. So constraint2 satisfied.
- Constraint3: purple on table in step16.
- Constraint4: when purple is on table (step16), earlier state held orange (step11) or orange on grey. Satisfied.
- Constraint5: green_block_2 not clear in step4.
- Constraint6: when green_block_2 not clear (step4), earlier state held green_block_1 or grey on orange (step3b). Satisfied.
- Constraint7: arm holds green_block_2 in step13.
- Constraint8: after step13 (holding green_block_2), step15 holds purple. Satisfied.
- Constraint9: arm holds purple in steps3,5,7,15.
- Constraint10: when holding purple, earlier held red (step1). Yes, step1 before steps3,5,7,15.
- Constraint11: brown has block on top in step8.
- Constraint12: when brown has block on top (step8), in that state or later, grey on orange or orange not on table. In step8, orange is on grey (step12), so orange is not on table. Satisfied.
- Constraint13: green_block_1 not on brown_block_1 (initially true, remains true).
- Constraint14: if green_block_1 not on brown in state s, then in s or after, green not on table or brown not on table. Initially, both are on table. After step3a, green_block_1 is still on table. Brown is on table until step8, where purple is stacked on it. So in step8, brown has purple, so brown is not clear but still on table. So after step8, brown is on table. So constraint14 requires that after the initial state (where green_block_1 is not on brown), in some state after, green_block_1 is not on table or brown not on table. But in this plan, green_block_1 remains on table, and brown remains on table. So this would violate constraint14. Oh no!

So this plan doesn't satisfy constraint14. Therefore, we need to ensure that either green_block_1 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not on the table at some point after the initial state.

To satisfy constraint14, since green_block_1 is on the table initially, we need to either move green_block_1 or move brown_block_1.

But moving brown_block_1 is not possible since it's on the table and can only be picked up if clear. Initially, brown_block_1 has red_block_1 on top, which is cleared in step1. So after step1, brown_block_1 is clear and can be picked up.

So perhaps:

After step1 (unstack red from brown), we can pickup brown_block_1 and put it somewhere else. For example:

2. Pickup brown_block_1. (Now holding brown)
3. Stack brown_block_1 somehwere, say on red_block_1. But red is on table. Wait, after step1, red is on table. So step3: stack brown on red. Now brown is on red, which is on table. This way, brown is not on table. So satisfies constraint14, because in the initial state, green_block_1 is not on brown, and after step3, brown is not on table. Thus, in the state after step3, brown is not on table, satisfying constraint14.

But integrating this into the plan would change many steps.

This is getting very complex. Given the time constraints, I'll try to draft a possible plan that meets all constraints, even if it's lengthy.

Final plan outline:

1. Unstack red_block_1 brown_block_1. (Hold red)
   - To satisfy constraint10 (hold red before purple)
2. Putdown red_block_1.
3. Unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1. (Hold grey)
   - To later satisfy constraint6
4. Stack grey_block_1 orange_block_1. (Grey on orange)
   - Now orange is under grey, so need to clear it later.
5. Unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1. (Hold purple)
   - Now orange is clear (grey is on orange)
6. Stack purple_block_1 green_block_2. (Purple on green_block_2)
   - Satisfies constraint5 (green_block_2 not clear), and constraint6 (grey on orange)
7. Unstack grey_block_1 orange_block_1. (Hold grey)
8. Putdown grey_block_1.
9. Pickup orange_block_1. (Hold orange)
   - To satisfy constraint4 when putting purple on table later
10. Putdown orange_block_1. (Orange on table)
11. Unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2. (Hold purple)
12. Putdown purple_block_1. (Satisfies constraint3, and step9 held orange)
13. Pickup green_block_2. (Hold green_block_2)
    - Satisfies constraint7
14. Stack green_block_2 orange_block_1. (Achieves goal)
15. Unstack red_block_1 from table. (Hold red)
    - Not needed, but to hold purple again after green_block_2
16. Pickup purple_block_1. (Hold purple)
    - Satisfies constraint8 (hold purple after green_block_2)

But steps15 and 16 are redundant. Instead, after step14, the arm is empty. So:

15. Pickup purple_block_1. (Hold purple)
    - Satisfies constraint8

But why do we need to hold purple after green_block_2? Because constraint8 says that if you hold green_block_2 in state s, then in s or later, hold purple. In step13, we hold green_block_2, then in step15, hold purple. This satisfies the constraint.

Now, check all constraints:

1. Purple not clear: step6 (purple on green_block_2)
2. When purple not clear (step6), earlier state (step4) grey on orange, which satisfies the condition.
3. Purple on table: step12
4. When purple on table (step12), earlier state (step9) held orange.
5. green_block_2 not clear: step6
6. When green_block_2 not clear (step6), earlier state (step4) grey on orange.
7. Arm holds green_block_2: step13
8. After holding green_block_2 (step13), holds purple in step15.
9. Arm holds purple: steps5,11,15
10. When holding purple, earlier held red: step1 before steps5,11,15.
11. Brown_block_1 has block on top: need to address. Currently, after step1, brown is clear. So we need to stack something on brown. Perhaps after step1, stack red on brown again. Let's adjust:

After step2 (putdown red), stack red on brown again.

3. Stack red_block_1 brown_block_1. (Red on brown, satisfying constraint11)
   - Now, when red is stacked on brown, constraint11 is satisfied. Then, in step3, brown has red on top. For constraint12: in this state or later, grey on orange or orange not on table. Step4: grey on orange (step4), which satisfies constraint12.

So inserting step3 as stack red on brown:

Adjusted plan:

1. Unstack red_block_1 brown_block_1. (Hold red)
2. Putdown red_block_1. (Red on table)
3. Stack red_block_1 brown_block_1. (Red on brown, satisfies constraint11)
4. Unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1. (Hold grey)
5. Stack grey_block_1 orange_block_1. (Grey on orange)
6. Unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1. (Hold purple)
7. Stack purple_block_1 green_block_2. (Purple on green_block_2)
8. Unstack grey_block_1 orange_block_1. (Hold grey)
9. Putdown grey_block_1.
10. Pickup orange_block_1. (Hold orange)
11. Putdown orange_block_1.
12. Unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2. (Hold purple)
13. Putdown purple_block_1.
14. Pickup green_block_2. (Hold green_block_2)
15. Stack green_block_2 orange_block_1.
16. Pickup purple_block_1. (Hold purple)

Now, checking constraint12: when brown has red on top (step3), in that state or later, grey on orange (step5) or orange not on table. Step5 comes after step3, so in step5, grey is on orange, satisfying constraint12.

This seems to cover all constraints. Let's verify:

- Constraint11: brown has red on top (step3).
- Constraint12: in step3 (brown has red), later step5 has grey on orange. So satisfied.
- Constraint14: green_block_1 is not on brown_block_1. Initially true. Then, in step4, green_block_1 is clear (grey was unstacked). So in step4 and after, green_block_1 is on table. Brown_block_1 is on table until step3, then has red on top (still on table). So to satisfy constraint14, after initial state, in some state, green_block_1 is not on table or brown is not on table. However, in this plan, green_block_1 remains on table, and brown is on table. So violates constraint14.

Thus, need to move either green_block_1 or brown_block_1 off the table.

So after step3 (stack red on brown), we can unstack brown_block_1 from table. Wait, no. Blocks can't be picked up if there's something on top. After step3, brown_block_1 has red on top. So can't pick up brown. Alternative, move green_block_1.

After step4 (unstack grey from green_block_1), green_block_1 is clear. So:

4. Unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1. (Hold grey)
5. Pickup green_block_1. (Hold green_block_1)
6. Putdown green_block_1. (No, but this doesn't help)
   - To move green_block_1 off table, stack it somewhere.

But this adds steps. Let's try:

After step4:

5. Pickup green_block_1. (Hold green_block_1)
6. Stack green_block_1 some block. Say, red_block_1 which is on brown_block_1.

But red is on brown. To stack green_block_1 on red:

6. Stack green_block_1 red_block_1. Now green_block_1 is on red, which is on brown. So green_block_1 is not on table. Satisfies constraint14.

Then proceed:

7. Stack grey_block_1 orange_block_1. (Grey on orange)
8. Unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1. (Hold purple)
9. Stack purple_block_1 green_block_2. (Purple on green_block_2)
10. Unstack grey_block_1 orange_block_1. (Hold grey)
11. Putdown grey_block_1.
12. Pickup orange_block_1. (Hold orange)
13. Putdown orange_block_1.
14. Unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2. (Hold purple)
15. Putdown purple_block_1.
16. Pickup green_block_2. (Hold green_block_2)
17. Stack green_block_2 orange_block_1.
18. Pickup purple_block_1. (Hold purple)

Now, constraint14: green_block_1 is not on brown_block_1 (true), and after step6, green_block_1 is on red_block_1 (not on table). So in step6, green_block_1 is not on table, satisfying constraint14.

This way, all constraints should be satisfied.

Final plan steps:

1. Unstack red_block_1 brown_block_1
2. Putdown red_block_1
3. Stack red_block_1 brown_block_1
4. Unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
5. Pickup green_block_1
6. Stack green_block_1 red_block_1
7. Stack grey_block_1 orange_block_1
8. Unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1
9. Stack purple_block_1 green_block_2
10. Unstack grey_block_1 orange_block_1
11. Putdown grey_block_1
12. Pickup orange_block_1
13. Putdown orange_block_1
14. Unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2
15. Putdown purple_block_1
16. Pickup green_block_2
17. Stack green_block_2 orange_block_1
18. Pickup purple_block_1

This plan meets all the constraints and the goal. Let's check each constraint again:

1. Purple not clear: step9 (on green_block_2)
2. When purple not clear (step9), earlier state (step7) grey on orange
3. Purple on table: step15
4. When purple on table (step15), earlier state (step12) arm held orange
5. green_block_2 not clear: step9
6. When green_block_2 not clear (step9), earlier state (step7) grey on orange
7. Arm holds green_block_2: step16
8. After step16, step18 holds purple
9. Arm holds purple: steps8,14,18
10. When holding purple, earlier held red (step1 before steps8,14,18)
11. Brown has block on top: step3 (red)
12. When brown has block (step3), later step7 has grey on orange
13. green_block_1 not on brown: always true
14. After step6, green_block_1 is not on table (stacked on red)
15. Other constraints related to holding purple and green are satisfied.

This seems to work. Now, let's write the final plan with the correct order and actions.
