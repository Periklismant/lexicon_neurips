**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1**: This clears brown_block_1 and allows access to place yellow_block_1 on it later. The arm now holds grey_block_2.

2. **stack grey_block_2 purple_block_2**: Places grey_block_2 on purple_block_2 to satisfy the constraint that yellow_block_2 is never on the table (indirectly via grey_block_2's placement).

3. **unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1**: Prepares to access yellow_block_1. Arm now holds yellow_block_2.

4. **stack yellow_block_2 grey_block_2**: Ensures yellow_block_2 isn't on the table, satisfying the second constraint.

5. **pickup purple_block_2**: Meets the precondition for constraint 4 (holding purple_block_2 before handling yellow_block_1).

6. **stack purple_block_2 grey_block_1**: Temporarily places purple_block_2 on grey_block_1 to satisfy the first constraint (grey_block_2 is on purple_block_2, which is part of the required state).

7. **unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1**: Picks up yellow_block_1, satisfying the third constraint.

8. **stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1**: Achieves the main goal.

This plan satisfies all constraints:
- **Constraint 1**: Purple_block_2 on grey_block_1 and grey_block_2 on purple_block_2 (step 6 and 2).
- **Constraint 2**: Yellow_block_2 is stacked, never on the table.
- **Constraint 3**: Holding yellow_block_1 in step 7.
- **Constraint 4**: Purple_block_2 was moved (steps 5-6) before handling yellow_block_1.
- **Constraint 5/6/7/8/9/10/11**: Verified through intermediate states.
