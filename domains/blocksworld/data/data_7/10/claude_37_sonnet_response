Let's first summarize the planning problem:

### Initial State:
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- purple_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1
- grey_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1
- purple_block_2 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is clear
- yellow_block_2 is clear
- purple_block_2 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Visually, this is:
```
  grey_block_2        yellow_block_2        purple_block_2
        ^                   ^                     
brown_block_1          yellow_block_1         
        ^                   ^               
grey_block_1           purple_block_1            
        ^                   ^                     ^
       Table               Table                 Table
```

### Goal State:
- yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1

### Constraints:
1. At some point: "purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1" AND "grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1" must both be true.
2. In every state: "yellow_block_2 is not on the table" must be true.
3. At some point: "you are holding yellow_block_1" must be true.
4. Before "you are holding yellow_block_1" can be true, there must be an earlier state where "purple_block_2 is not on the table" OR "you are holding purple_block_2" is true.
5. At some point: "brown_block_1 is not clear" must be true. (Already true in the initial state)
6. If "brown_block_1 is not clear" is true in some state s, then at s or some later state, "brown_block_1 is clear" OR "you are holding grey_block_2" must be true.
7. At some point: "brown_block_1 is not on the table" must be true. (Already true in the initial state)
8. If "brown_block_1 is not on the table" is true in some state s, then at s or some later state, "purple_block_1 is not clear" must be true.
9. At some point: "brown_block_1 is clear" must be true.
10. Before "brown_block_1 is clear" can be true, there must be an earlier state where "purple_block_2 is not on the table" is true.
11. At some point: "purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1" OR "you are holding grey_block_1" must be true.

Now, let's break down the problem:

1. The goal is to have yellow_block_1 on top of brown_block_1.
2. In the initial state, yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1, and brown_block_1 has grey_block_2 on top of it.
3. To achieve the goal, I need to:
   a. Clear brown_block_1 (which means removing grey_block_2 from it).
   b. Clear yellow_block_1 (which means removing yellow_block_2 from it).
   c. Stack yellow_block_1 on top of brown_block_1.

Let's also note the constraints that are already satisfied in the initial state:
- Constraint 2: "yellow_block_2 is not on the table" is true in the initial state, and we need to ensure it remains true.
- Constraint 5: "brown_block_1 is not clear" is true in the initial state.
- Constraint 7: "brown_block_1 is not on the table" is true in the initial state.

Now, let's try to come up with a plan that satisfies all constraints:

First, let's note that due to constraint 10, I need to move purple_block_2 off the table before I can make brown_block_1 clear. 

Let's start planning:

1. I need to unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1 to make brown_block_1 clear. But before I can do that, due to constraint 10, I need to ensure "purple_block_2 is not on the table" is true in an earlier state.
   - So, I'll start by picking up purple_block_2 from the table.

2. After picking up purple_block_2, I need to place it somewhere. Since placing it back on the table would make constraint 10 not satisfied, I'll place it on another clear block. Let's place it on top of purple_block_1.

3. Now, I can unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1, which makes brown_block_1 clear. Due to constraint 6, I need to ensure "brown_block_1 is clear" OR "you are holding grey_block_2" is true, which it is.

4. Before I can place yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1, I need to remove yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. But, due to constraint 2, I can't place yellow_block_2 on the table. So, I'll need to place it on another clear block.

5. Due to constraint 1, I need to ensure "purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1" AND "grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1" are both true at some point. This means I can't simply place yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1 right away. I need to fulfill constraint 1 first. To do that, I'll first place purple_block_1 on top of brown_block_1. But to do this, I need to clear purple_block_1 first (which has purple_block_2 on it from step 2).

6. So, let's revise: After unstacking grey_block_2, I'll place it on grey_block_1, satisfying part of constraint 1.

7. Then, I'll grab purple_block_2 from purple_block_1 and place it somewhere else, making purple_block_1 clear.

8. Now, I'll pick up purple_block_1 and stack it on brown_block_1, satisfying the other part of constraint 1.

9. Then, I'll need to remove purple_block_1 from brown_block_1 to eventually place yellow_block_1 there. But due to constraint 4, before I can hold yellow_block_1, I need to ensure "purple_block_2 is not on the table" OR "you are holding purple_block_2" is true, which is already satisfied from step 7.

10. Now, I can unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1, but due to constraint 2, I can't place yellow_block_2 on the table. Let's place it on purple_block_2.

11. Next, I can pick up yellow_block_1, satisfying constraint 3.

12. Finally, I'll place yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1, achieving the goal.

Let's see if this works. Here's the plan step by step:

1. pickup purple_block_2
2. stack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
4. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
6. stack purple_block_2 brown_block_1
7. pickup purple_block_1
8. stack purple_block_1 purple_block_2
9. unstack purple_block_1 purple_block_2
10. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
11. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
12. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2
13. pickup yellow_block_1
14. putdown yellow_block_1
15. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
16. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
17. pickup yellow_block_1
18. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1

Wait, I don't think this plan works. Let's recheck.

Step 5 is problematic because we just put purple_block_2 on purple_block_1, and now we're trying to unstack it, which is fine, but in step 6, we're trying to stack purple_block_2 on brown_block_1, which has purple_block_1 on it. This is not possible.

Let's rethink the sequence of actions:

1. pickup purple_block_2
2. stack purple_block_2 grey_block_2 (grey_block_2 is currently clear)
3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
4. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 (satisfying part of constraint 1)
5. unstack purple_block_2 grey_block_2
6. stack purple_block_2 purple_block_1 (making yellow_block_1 inaccessible for now)
7. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
8. stack yellow_block_2 grey_block_2
9. pickup yellow_block_1
10. putdown yellow_block_1
11. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
12. stack purple_block_2 yellow_block_1
13. pickup purple_block_1
14. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1 (satisfying the other part of constraint 1)
15. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
16. stack purple_block_1 purple_block_2
17. pickup yellow_block_1
18. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1

Actually, there is another issue with the plan. In step 10, I'm putting down yellow_block_1 on the table, which doesn't advance my goal. I'm also not taking advantage of constraint 11.

Let's refine the plan:

1. pickup purple_block_2 (satisfy constraint 10)
2. stack purple_block_2 grey_block_2
3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1 (satisfy constraint 9)
4. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 (partially satisfy constraint 1)
5. unstack purple_block_2 grey_block_2
6. stack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
7. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
8. stack yellow_block_2 grey_block_2
9. pickup yellow_block_1 (satisfy constraint 3)
10. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1 (achieve the goal)

Wait, I'm rushing to the goal without satisfying constraint 1 completely, constraint 8, and constraint 11.

Let's think through the problem more carefully, focusing on the constraints.

After removing grey_block_2 from brown_block_1, I need to ensure "purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1" at some point. Then, I need to place yellow_block_1 there.

Also, due to constraint 8, since "brown_block_1 is not on the table" is true in the initial state and will remain true (as I don't plan to move it to the table), I need to ensure "purple_block_1 is not clear" is true at some point. This means I need to place a block on top of purple_block_1.

Let's refine the plan again:

1. pickup purple_block_2 (start satisfying constraint 10)
2. stack purple_block_2 grey_block_2 (continue satisfying constraint 10)
3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1 (satisfy constraint 9, making brown_block_1 clear)
4. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 (partially satisfy constraint 1)
5. unstack purple_block_2 grey_block_2
6. putdown purple_block_2 (this potentially breaks constraint 10, but it's already satisfied)
7. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
8. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2 (ensure yellow_block_2 is not on the table)
9. pickup yellow_block_1 (satisfy constraint 3)
10. putdown yellow_block_1 (temporary)
11. pickup purple_block_1
12. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1 (fully satisfy constraint 1, as grey_block_2 is already on grey_block_1)
13. pickup yellow_block_1
14. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1 (satisfy constraint 8)
15. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
16. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1 (achieve the goal)

Wait, there's still an issue. In step 16, I'm trying to stack yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1, but brown_block_1 has purple_block_1 on it from step 12. I need to remove purple_block_1 first.

Let's refine once more:

1. pickup purple_block_2 (start satisfying constraint 10)
2. stack purple_block_2 grey_block_2 (continue satisfying constraint 10)
3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1 (satisfy constraint 9, making brown_block_1 clear)
4. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 (partially satisfy constraint 1)
5. unstack purple_block_2 grey_block_2
6. putdown purple_block_2 (this potentially breaks constraint 10, but it's already satisfied)
7. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
8. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2 (ensure yellow_block_2 is not on the table)
9. pickup yellow_block_1 (satisfy constraint 3)
10. putdown yellow_block_1 (temporary)
11. pickup purple_block_1
12. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1 (fully satisfy constraint 1, as grey_block_2 is already on grey_block_1)
13. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
14. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1 (satisfy constraint 8)
15. pickup yellow_block_1
16. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1 (achieve the goal)

I still seem to be missing something. In step 15, I'm attempting to pick up yellow_block_1, but it has purple_block_1 on top of it from step 14, so it's not clear.

Let me redo this more carefully, considering each state after each action to ensure it's valid.

Initial state:
```
  grey_block_2        yellow_block_2        purple_block_2
        ^                   ^                     
brown_block_1          yellow_block_1         
        ^                   ^               
grey_block_1           purple_block_1            
        ^                   ^                     ^
       Table               Table                 Table
```

1. pickup purple_block_2 (satisfy constraint 10)
   Now you're holding purple_block_2.

2. stack purple_block_2 grey_block_2
   ```
   purple_block_2
        ^
   grey_block_2
        ^
brown_block_1          yellow_block_2
        ^                   ^
grey_block_1           yellow_block_1
        ^                   ^
       Table               purple_block_1
                                ^
                               Table
   ```

3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1 (satisfy constraint 9, making brown_block_1 clear)
   Now you're holding grey_block_2 (with purple_block_2 on top).

Wait, that's not valid. If I have purple_block_2 on top of grey_block_2, I can't unstack grey_block_2.

I need to backtrack and rethink. Let's get more methodical.

Initial state:
```
  grey_block_2        yellow_block_2        purple_block_2
        ^                   ^                     
brown_block_1          yellow_block_1         
        ^                   ^               
grey_block_1           purple_block_1            
        ^                   ^                     ^
       Table               Table                 Table
```

Let's consider the constraints and try to construct a valid plan:

First, I need to make brown_block_1 clear, but before that can happen, due to constraint 10, "purple_block_2 is not on the table" must be true at some point.

1. pickup purple_block_2 (satisfy constraint 10)
   Now you're holding purple_block_2.

2. stack purple_block_2 grey_block_2
   ```
   purple_block_2
        ^
   grey_block_2        yellow_block_2
        ^                   ^
brown_block_1          yellow_block_1
        ^                   ^
grey_block_1           purple_block_1
        ^                   ^
       Table               Table
   ```

Now, I can make brown_block_1 clear, but I need to consider where to put grey_block_2.

According to constraint 1, I need to have a state where "purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1" AND "grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1". So, I should place grey_block_2 on grey_block_1.

3. unstack purple_block_2 grey_block_2
   Now you're holding purple_block_2.

4. putdown purple_block_2
   ```
                      purple_block_2
   grey_block_2        yellow_block_2
        ^                   ^
brown_block_1          yellow_block_1
        ^                   ^
grey_block_1           purple_block_1
        ^                   ^                     ^
       Table               Table                 Table
   ```

5. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
   Now you're holding grey_block_2.

6. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 (partially satisfy constraint 1)
   ```
                      purple_block_2
                       yellow_block_2
                             ^
  brown_block_1          yellow_block_1
        ^                   ^
grey_block_2          purple_block_1
        ^                   ^                     ^
  grey_block_1             Table                 Table
        ^
       Table
   ```

Now, I need to satisfy the other part of constraint 1, which is having "purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1". But before I can do that, I need to clear purple_block_1, which has yellow_block_1 and yellow_block_2 on top of it.

7. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
   Now you're holding yellow_block_2.

I can't place yellow_block_2 on the table due to constraint 2. Let's put it on purple_block_2.

8. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2
   ```
   yellow_block_2
        ^
   purple_block_2

  brown_block_1          yellow_block_1
        ^                   ^
grey_block_2          purple_block_1
        ^                   ^
  grey_block_1             Table
        ^
       Table
   ```

9. pickup yellow_block_1 (satisfy constraint 3)
   Now you're holding yellow_block_1.

Due to constraint 4, before I can hold yellow_block_1, there must be an earlier state where "purple_block_2 is not on the table" OR "you are holding purple_block_2" is true. This is already satisfied from steps 1-3.

Now, I can pick up purple_block_1 and place it on brown_block_1.

10. putdown yellow_block_1 (temporarily)
   ```
   yellow_block_2
        ^
   purple_block_2      yellow_block_1

  brown_block_1          
        ^                   
grey_block_2          purple_block_1
        ^                   ^
  grey_block_1             Table
        ^
       Table
   ```

11. pickup purple_block_1
    Now you're holding purple_block_1.

12. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1 (fully satisfy constraint 1)
   ```
   yellow_block_2
        ^
   purple_block_2      yellow_block_1

  purple_block_1          
        ^                   
  brown_block_1          
        ^
grey_block_2          
        ^                   
  grey_block_1             
        ^
       Table
   ```

Now, for constraint 11, I need to ensure "purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1" OR "you are holding grey_block_1" is true at some point. The first condition is already satisfied.

Next, for constraint 8, since "brown_block_1 is not on the table" is true, I need to ensure "purple_block_1 is not clear" is true at some point. This means I need to place a block on top of purple_block_1. Let's use yellow_block_1.

13. pickup yellow_block_1
    Now you're holding yellow_block_1.

14. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1 (satisfy constraint 8)
   ```
   yellow_block_2
        ^
   purple_block_2      

  yellow_block_1          
        ^
  purple_block_1          
        ^                   
  brown_block_1          
        ^
grey_block_2          
        ^                   
  grey_block_1             
        ^
       Table
   ```

Now, to achieve the goal, I need to place yellow_block_1 on top of brown_block_1. I first need to remove yellow_block_1 from purple_block_1 and then place purple_block_1 somewhere else.

15. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
    Now you're holding yellow_block_1.

16. putdown yellow_block_1 (temporarily)
   ```
   yellow_block_2
        ^
   purple_block_2      yellow_block_1

  purple_block_1          
        ^                   
  brown_block_1          
        ^
grey_block_2          
        ^                   
  grey_block_1             
        ^
       Table
   ```

17. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
    Now you're holding purple_block_1.

18. putdown purple_block_1 (temporarily)
   ```
   yellow_block_2
        ^
   purple_block_2      yellow_block_1      purple_block_1

  brown_block_1          
        ^
grey_block_2          
        ^                   
  grey_block_1             
        ^
       Table
   ```

19. pickup yellow_block_1
    Now you're holding yellow_block_1.

20. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1 (achieve the goal)
   ```
   yellow_block_2
        ^
   purple_block_2      purple_block_1

  yellow_block_1          
        ^
  brown_block_1          
        ^
grey_block_2          
        ^                   
  grey_block_1             
        ^
       Table
   ```

Now, let's check if all constraints are satisfied:

Constraint 1: "purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1" AND "grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1" must both be true at some point. From steps 12 onwards, this is satisfied.

Constraint 2: "yellow_block_2 is not on the table" must be true in every state. This is true in every state of the plan.

Constraint 3: "you are holding yellow_block_1" must be true at some point. This is satisfied in steps 9, 13, 15, and 19.

Constraint 4: Before "you are holding yellow_block_1" can be true, there must be an earlier state where "purple_block_2 is not on the table" OR "you are holding purple_block_2" is true. This is satisfied in steps 1-3.

Constraint 5: "brown_block_1 is not clear" must be true at some point. This is true in the initial state and in several other states.

Constraint 6: If "brown_block_1 is not clear" is true in some state s, then at s or some later state, "brown_block_1 is clear" OR "you are holding grey_block_2" must be true. This is satisfied in step 5.

Constraint 7: "brown_block_1 is not on the table" must be true at some point. This is true in the initial state and remains true.

Constraint 8: If "brown_block_1 is not on the table" is true in some state s, then at s or some later state, "purple_block_1 is not clear" must be true. This is satisfied in step 14 (and potentially earlier).

Constraint 9: "brown_block_1 is clear" must be true at some point. This is satisfied after step 5.

Constraint 10: Before "brown_block_1 is clear" can be true, there must be an earlier state where "purple_block_2 is not on the table" is true. This is satisfied in steps 1-3.

Constraint 11: "purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1" OR "you are holding grey_block_1" must be true at some point. This is satisfied in step 12.

So, all constraints are satisfied and the goal is achieved. This plan should work.

Let's simplify the plan:

1. pickup purple_block_2
2. stack purple_block_2 grey_block_2
3. unstack purple_block_2 grey_block_2
4. putdown purple_block_2
5. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
6. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
7. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
8. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2
9. pickup yellow_block_1
10. putdown yellow_block_1
11. pickup purple_block_1
12. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
13. pickup yellow_block_1
14. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
15. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
16. putdown yellow_block_1
17. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
18. putdown purple_block_1
19. pickup yellow_block_1
20. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1

I notice that steps 9, 10, and 13 can be consolidated. If I don't put down yellow_block_1 after picking it up, I can directly stack it on purple_block_1.

Also, steps 3 and 4, where I unstack and put down purple_block_2, should be reconsidered. They don't seem to serve a purpose.

Let's simplify for the optimal plan:

1. pickup purple_block_2
2. stack purple_block_2 grey_block_2
3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
4. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
5. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
6. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2
7. pickup yellow_block_1
8. putdown yellow_block_1
9. pickup purple_block_1
10. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
11. pickup yellow_block_1
12. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
13. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
14. putdown yellow_block_1
15. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
16. putdown purple_block_1
17. pickup yellow_block_1
18. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1

Actually, hold on... I'm constrained now by grey_block_2 being on top of grey_block_1, but I don't need to move grey_block_2 in steps 3-4. I can directly unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1 and place it on grey_block_1 as I need to do for constraint 1. Let me reorganize the plan taking this into account.

Also, I realized I may have missed something. In the initial state, I mentioned:
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- grey_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1

So, the tower is actually:
```
grey_block_2
     ^
brown_block_1
     ^
grey_block_1
     ^
    Table
```

Now, let's re-plan:

Initial state:
```
  grey_block_2        yellow_block_2        purple_block_2
        ^                   ^                     
brown_block_1          yellow_block_1         
        ^                   ^               
grey_block_1           purple_block_1            
        ^                   ^                     ^
       Table               Table                 Table
```

1. pickup purple_block_2 (satisfy constraint 10)
   Now you're holding purple_block_2.

2. stack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
   ```
                      purple_block_2
                           ^
  grey_block_2        yellow_block_2
        ^                   ^
brown_block_1          yellow_block_1
        ^                   ^
grey_block_1           purple_block_1
        ^                   ^
       Table               Table
   ```

3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1 (satisfy constraint 9, making brown_block_1 clear)
   Now you're holding grey_block_2.

4. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 (partially satisfy constraint 1)
   ```
                      purple_block_2

        ^                   ^
grey_block_2          yellow_block_1
        ^                   ^
grey_block_1          purple_block_1
        ^                   ^
       Table               Table
   ```

5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
   Now you're holding purple_block_2.

6. stack purple_block_2 brown_block_1
   ```
   purple_block_2

   ```

7. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
   Now you're holding yellow_block_2.

8. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2
   ```
   yellow_block_2
        ^
   purple_block_2
        ^
  brown_block_1        
        ^                   
grey_block_2          yellow_block_1
        ^                   ^
grey_block_1          purple_block_1
        ^                   ^
       Table               Table
   ```

9. pickup yellow_block_1 (satisfy constraint 3)
   Now you're holding yellow_block_1.

10. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
   ```
   yellow_block_2         yellow_block_1
        ^                      ^

        ^                   
       Table               
   ```

11. unstack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2
   Now you're holding yellow_block_2.

12. stack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
   ```
                         yellow_block_2

13. unstack purple_block_2 brown_block_1
   Now you're holding purple_block_2.

14. stack purple_block_2 purple_block_1

                         yellow_block_2

                         yellow_block_1
                              ^
   brown_block_1          purple_block_2
        ^                      ^
grey_block_2              purple_block_1
        ^                      ^
grey_block_1                  Table
        ^                   
       Table               
   ```

15. pickup purple_block_1 (we need to move this, but it's not clear)
    Wait, purple_block_1 is not clear in this state; purple_block_2 is on top of it. Let's rethink.

13. unstack purple_block_2 brown_block_1
   Now you're holding purple_block_2.

14. putdown purple_block_2
   ```
                         yellow_block_2
                              ^
                         yellow_block_1
                              ^         purple_block_2
   brown_block_1          purple_block_1
        ^                      ^
grey_block_2                  Table
        ^                   
grey_block_1                 
        ^                   
       Table               
   ```

15. pickup purple_block_1 (this is also not valid, purple_block_1 is still not clear)

I'm making mistakes in tracking the states. Let's reorganize and be more precise.

Initial state:
```
  grey_block_2        yellow_block_2        purple_block_2
        ^                   ^                     
brown_block_1          yellow_block_1         
        ^                   ^               
grey_block_1           purple_block_1            
        ^                   ^                     ^
       Table               Table                 Table
```

To satisfy constraint 1, I need to ensure "purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1" AND "grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1". This means I need to move grey_block_2 from brown_block_1 to grey_block_1, and then move purple_block_1 to brown_block_1.

1. pickup purple_block_2 (satisfy constraint 10)
   Now you're holding purple_block_2.

2. putdown purple_block_2
   ```
  grey_block_2        yellow_block_2        purple_block_2
        ^                   ^                     
brown_block_1          yellow_block_1         
        ^                   ^               
grey_block_1           purple_block_1            
        ^                   ^                     ^
       Table               Table                 Table
   ```
   Purple_block_2 is off the table for a brief period, so constraint 10 is satisfied. Now, I can make brown_block_1 clear.

3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
   Now you're holding grey_block_2.

4. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 (partially satisfy constraint 1)
   ```
                      yellow_block_2        purple_block_2
                             ^                     
brown_block_1          yellow_block_1         
        ^                   ^               
grey_block_2           purple_block_1            
        ^                   ^                     ^
  grey_block_1             Table                 Table

        ^                   ^                     
brown_block_1                            
        ^                                       
grey_block_2                        
        ^                                       ^
  grey_block_1             Table                 Table
        ^
       Table
   ```

16. pickup yellow_block_1
    Now you're holding yellow_block_1.

17. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1 (achieve the goal)
   ```
                                        yellow_block_2
                                              ^        
  yellow_block_1        purple_block_1     purple_block_2
        ^                   ^                     
brown_block_1                            
        ^                                       
grey_block_2                        
        ^                                       ^
  grey_block_1             Table                 Table
        ^
       Table
   ```

Now, let's check if all constraints are satisfied:

Constraint 1: "purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1" AND "grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1" must both be true at some point. From steps 10-13, this is satisfied.

Constraint 2: "yellow_block_2 is not on the table" must be true in every state. This is true in every state of the plan.

Constraint 3: "you are holding yellow_block_1" must be true at some point. This is satisfied in steps 7, 11, 13, and 16.

Constraint 4: Before "you are holding yellow_block_1" can be true, there must be an earlier state where "purple_block_2 is not on the table" OR "you are holding purple_block_2" is true. This is satisfied in steps 1-2.

Constraint 5: "brown_block_1 is not clear" must be true at some point. This is true in the initial state and in several other states.

Constraint 6: If "brown_block_1 is not clear" is true in some state s, then at s or some later state, "brown_block_1 is clear" OR "you are holding grey_block_2" must be true. This is satisfied in step 3.

Constraint 7: "brown_block_1 is not on the table" must be true at some point. This is true in the initial state and remains true.

Constraint 8: If "brown_block_1 is not on the table" is true in some state s, then at s or some later state, "purple_block_1 is not clear" must be true. This is satisfied in step 12.

Constraint 9: "brown_block_1 is clear" must be true at some point. This is satisfied after step 3.

Constraint 10: Before "brown_block_1 is clear" can be true, there must be an earlier state where "purple_block_2 is not on the table" is true. This is satisfied in steps 1-2.

Constraint 11: "purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1" OR "you are holding grey_block_1" must be true at some point. This is satisfied in step 10.

Simplifying the plan, I think the optimal plan would be:

1. pickup purple_block_2
2. putdown purple_block_2
3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
4. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
5. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
6. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2
7. pickup yellow_block_1
8. putdown yellow_block_1
9. pickup purple_block_1
10. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
11. pickup yellow_block_1
12. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
13. putdown yellow_block_1
14. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
15. putdown purple_block_1
16. pickup yellow_block_1
17. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1

Wait, I think step 13 is oops above; I'm stacking yellow_block_1 on purple_block_1 and then immediately unstacking it. Let me double check a more optimal plan.

1. pickup purple_block_2
2. putdown purple_block_2
3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
4. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
5. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
6. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2
7. pickup yellow_block_1
8. putdown yellow_block_1
9. pickup purple_block_1
10. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
11. pickup yellow_block_1
12. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
13. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
14. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
15. putdown purple_block_1
16. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1

But I will again run into the problem in step 14 because I'm holding yellow_block_1, so I need to put it down first. I think my original plan is correct.

Let me re-check steps 12-17:

12. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1 (satisfy constraint 8)
    ```
                                    yellow_block_2
                                          ^
      yellow_block_1                   purple_block_2
            ^
      purple_block_1
            ^
    brown_block_1
            ^
    grey_block_2
            ^
      grey_block_1
            ^
           Table
    ```

13. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
    Now you're holding yellow_block_1.

I don't think we needed to stack yellow_block_1 on purple_block_1. Let's simplify:

1. pickup purple_block_2
2. putdown purple_block_2
3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
4. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
5. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
6. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2
7. pickup yellow_block_1
8. putdown yellow_block_1
9. pickup purple_block_1
10. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
11. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
12. putdown purple_block_1
13. pickup yellow_block_1
14. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1

But this doesn't satisfy constraint 8. Let's recall constraint 8:
"If "brown_block_1 is not on the table" is true in some state s, then at s or some later state, "purple_block_1 is not clear" must be true."

We can simplify this by making "purple_block_1 is not clear" true by stacking purple_block_1 on some block and then stacking another block on top of it.

1. pickup purple_block_2
2. putdown purple_block_2
3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
4. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
5. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
6. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2
7. pickup yellow_block_1
8. putdown yellow_block_1
9. pickup purple_block_1
10. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
11. pickup yellow_block_1
12. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
13. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
14. putdown yellow_block_1
15. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
16. putdown purple_block_1
17. pickup yellow_block_1
18. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1

But there's an optimization here. We can skip steps 12-14 and go directly to step 15:

1. pickup purple_block_2
2. putdown purple_block_2
3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
4. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
5. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
6. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2
7. pickup yellow_block_1
8. putdown yellow_block_1
9. pickup purple_block_1
10. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
11. pickup yellow_block_1
12. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
13. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
14. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1

But if I do that, I won't satisfy constraint 8. Let's check this again.

Constraint 8: "If "brown_block_1 is not on the table" is true in some state s, then at s or some later state, "purple_block_1 is not clear" must be true."

"purple_block_1 is not clear" means there's a block on top of purple_block_1, which we achieve in step 12.

Actually, let's reconsider step 13-14. If I've stacked yellow_block_1 on purple_block_1, I can't immediately unstack it and stack it on brown_block_1, because I can only hold one block at a time.

I'm going to revise the plan once more, tracking every state carefully:

1. pickup purple_block_2
   Now you're holding purple_block_2.

2. putdown purple_block_2
   ```
  grey_block_2        yellow_block_2        purple_block_2
        ^                   ^                     
brown_block_1          yellow_block_1         
        ^                   ^               
grey_block_1           purple_block_1            
        ^                   ^                     ^
       Table               Table                 Table
   ```

3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
   Now you're holding grey_block_2.

4. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
   ```
                     yellow_block_2        purple_block_2
                            ^                     
brown_block_1          yellow_block_1         
        ^                   ^               
grey_block_2           purple_block_1            
        ^                   ^                     ^
  grey_block_1             Table                 Table
        ^
       Table
   ```

5. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
   Now you're holding yellow_block_2.

6. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2
   ```
                                       yellow_block_2
                                             ^        
brown_block_1          yellow_block_1      purple_block_2
        ^                   ^                     
grey_block_2           purple_block_1            
        ^                   ^                     ^

        ^
       Table
    ```

This plan seems to satisfy all constraints. Let's double-check once more:

1. pickup purple_block_2
2. putdown purple_block_2
3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
4. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
5. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
6. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2
7. pickup yellow_block_1
8. putdown yellow_block_1
9. pickup purple_block_1
10. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
11. pickup yellow_block_1
12. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
13. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
14. putdown yellow_block_1
15. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
16. putdown purple_block_1
17. pickup yellow_block_1
18. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1

That'll be my answer.
