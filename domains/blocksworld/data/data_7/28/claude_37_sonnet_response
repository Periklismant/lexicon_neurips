Let me understand the initial state, the goal, and the constraints.

Initial state:
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- black_block_1 is clear
- white_block_1 is clear
- purple_block_1 is clear
- white_block_2 is clear
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- robotic arm is not holding any block

I can represent this state visually as:
```
     white_block_2       yellow_block_1
          |                   |
   orange_block_1      grey_block_1

   black_block_1     white_block_1     purple_block_1
```

Goal:
- yellow_block_1 is on the table

So we need to move yellow_block_1 from the top of grey_block_1 to the table.

Now, let's analyze the constraints:
1. "white_block_2 is on the table" must hold in at least one state.
2. "you are holding yellow_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
3. If "you are holding yellow_block_1" holds, then there must be an earlier state where "you are holding black_block_1".
4. At least one of these must hold in at least one state: "orange_block_1 is clear" or "grey_block_1 is not on the table".
5. "orange_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
6. If "orange_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1" holds in state s, then at s or after, "grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" or "white_block_1 is not clear" must hold.
7. "orange_block_1 is clear" must hold in at least one state.
8. "grey_block_1 is clear" must hold in at least one state.
9. If "grey_block_1 is clear" holds, then in an earlier state, "black_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1" or "purple_block_1 is not clear" must have held.
10. "black_block_1 is not on top of purple_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
11. If "black_block_1 is not on top of purple_block_1" holds in state s, then at s or after, "white_block_2 is on the table" or "you are holding yellow_block_1" must hold.

Let's analyze these constraints in detail:

Constraints 5 and 10 are already satisfied in the initial state because orange_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1 and black_block_1 is not on top of purple_block_1. But due to constraints 6 and 11, I need to ensure "grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" or "white_block_1 is not clear" for 6, and "white_block_2 is on the table" or "you are holding yellow_block_1" for 11.

Constraints 2 and 3 together imply that I need to hold black_block_1 at some point, and then later I need to hold yellow_block_1 at some point.

Let's plan step-by-step considering these constraints:

Looking at constraint 9, if grey_block_1 is clear, then in an earlier state, "black_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1" or "purple_block_1 is not clear" must have held. Since in the initial state grey_block_1 is not clear, it's fine. But if we want to get yellow_block_1 off of grey_block_1, we'd need to make grey_block_1 clear.

Let's plan a sequence of actions:

1. To satisfy constraint 1, I need to move white_block_2 to the table. To do that, I need to unstack it from orange_block_1:
   - unstack white_block_2 orange_block_1
   - putdown white_block_2

2. Now, to satisfy constraint 7, I've already made orange_block_1 clear.

3. To satisfy constraint 9, before making grey_block_1 clear, I need to either put black_block_1 on top of orange_block_1 or make purple_block_1 not clear. I'll go with the second option for now:
   - pickup black_block_1
   - stack black_block_1 purple_block_1

This also satisfies constraint 3 partially, as I've held black_block_1.

4. Now, I can make grey_block_1 clear by removing yellow_block_1:
   - unstack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1

This also satisfies constraint 2, as I'm now holding yellow_block_1. And it satisfies constraint 8, as grey_block_1 is now clear.

5. To satisfy constraint 6, I need to make either "grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" or "white_block_1 is not clear". I'll go with the first:
   - putdown yellow_block_1 (I put this down because I'm holding it and need to perform other actions)
   - pickup grey_block_1
   - stack grey_block_1 white_block_1

6. Now, I need to achieve the goal of having yellow_block_1 on the table. I've already put it down in step 5, so the goal is satisfied.

But there's a problem here: the given constraint tells me that if I'm holding yellow_block_1, then there should be an earlier state where I'm holding black_block_1. Also, constraint 11 requires that after "black_block_1 is not on top of purple_block_1" (which is the initial state), I need to have a state where "white_block_2 is on the table" or "you are holding yellow_block_1".

Let's revise:

1. First, since black_block_1 is not on top of purple_block_1 in the initial state, I need to satisfy constraint 11 early on:
   - unstack white_block_2 orange_block_1
   - putdown white_block_2

This satisfies constraint 1 and addresses constraint 11.

2. Now, to satisfy constraint 3, I need to handle black_block_1 before yellow_block_1:
   - pickup black_block_1

3. To satisfy constraint 9, I'll make purple_block_1 not clear:
   - stack black_block_1 purple_block_1

4. Now, I can unstack yellow_block_1 from grey_block_1:
   - unstack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1

This satisfies constraint 2, and since I held black_block_1 earlier, it also satisfies constraint 3.

5. To satisfy constraint 6, I need to make either "grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" or "white_block_1 is not clear". I'll go with the first:
   - putdown yellow_block_1
   - pickup grey_block_1
   - stack grey_block_1 white_block_1

Now, I've satisfied all the constraints and the goal is achieved.

Let's double-check:
1. "white_block_2 is on the table" ✓
2. "you are holding yellow_block_1" ✓
3. Held black_block_1 before holding yellow_block_1 ✓
4. orange_block_1 is clear ✓
5. orange_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1 (always satisfied) ✓
6. After orange_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1, grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 ✓
7. orange_block_1 is clear ✓
8. grey_block_1 is clear ✓
9. Before grey_block_1 is clear, purple_block_1 is not clear ✓
10. black_block_1 is not on top of purple_block_1 (initially satisfied, but violated after step 3) ✗
11. After black_block_1 is not on top of purple_block_1, white_block_2 is on the table ✓

Ah, there's an inconsistency with constraint 10. The constraint says "black_block_1 is not on top of purple_block_1" must hold in at least one state, but I've made black_block_1 on top of purple_block_1.

Let's revise the plan again:

1. To satisfy constraint 1 and address constraint 11:
   - unstack white_block_2 orange_block_1
   - putdown white_block_2

2. To satisfy constraint 3 and 10, I'll handle black_block_1 but not put it on purple_block_1:
   - pickup black_block_1
   - putdown black_block_1

3. Hmm, we've seen that constraint 9 requires that before grey_block_1 is clear, we need to satisfy "black_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1" or "purple_block_1 is not clear". Let's attempt a different approach:
   - pickup black_block_1
   - stack black_block_1 orange_block_1 (This also addresses the alternative in constraint 4)

4. Now, I can unstack yellow_block_1 from grey_block_1:
   - unstack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1

5. To satisfy constraint 6, I need to make either "grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" or "white_block_1 is not clear". I'll go with the first:
   - putdown yellow_block_1
   - pickup grey_block_1
   - stack grey_block_1 white_block_1

But hold on, this still doesn't address constraint 10 ("black_block_1 is not on top of purple_block_1" must hold in at least one state). But this is already satisfied in the initial state and several other states, so we're good.

I think the plan is now correct. Let's trace through it again for clarity:

Initial state:
```
     white_block_2       yellow_block_1
          |                   |
   orange_block_1      grey_block_1

   black_block_1     white_block_1     purple_block_1
```

Step 1: unstack white_block_2 orange_block_1
```
                     yellow_block_1
                          |
   orange_block_1    grey_block_1

   black_block_1     white_block_1     purple_block_1     white_block_2 (in hand)
```

Step 2: putdown white_block_2
```
                     yellow_block_1
                          |
   orange_block_1    grey_block_1

   black_block_1     white_block_1     purple_block_1     white_block_2
```

Constraints 1 and 11 are satisfied.

Step 3: pickup black_block_1
```
                     yellow_block_1
                          |
   orange_block_1    grey_block_1

                     white_block_1     purple_block_1     white_block_2     black_block_1 (in hand)
```

Step 4: stack black_block_1 orange_block_1
```
                     yellow_block_1
     black_block_1        |
          |          grey_block_1
   orange_block_1    

                     white_block_1     purple_block_1     white_block_2
```

Constraint 3 is partially satisfied as black_block_1 has been held.

Step 5: unstack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1
```
     black_block_1    
          |          
   orange_block_1    grey_block_1

                     white_block_1     purple_block_1     white_block_2     yellow_block_1 (in hand)
```

Constraints 2 and 3 are satisfied. Constraint 8 is satisfied as grey_block_1 is clear.

Step 6: putdown yellow_block_1
```
     black_block_1    
          |          
   orange_block_1    grey_block_1

                     white_block_1     purple_block_1     white_block_2     yellow_block_1
```

Goal "yellow_block_1 is on the table" is satisfied.

Step 7: pickup grey_block_1
```
     black_block_1    
          |          
   orange_block_1                         

                     white_block_1     purple_block_1     white_block_2     yellow_block_1     grey_block_1 (in hand)
```

Step 8: stack grey_block_1 white_block_1
```
     black_block_1    
          |                    grey_block_1
   orange_block_1                 |
                             white_block_1     purple_block_1     white_block_2     yellow_block_1
```

Constraint 6 is satisfied.

Let's check all the constraints again:
1. "white_block_2 is on the table" ✓
2. "you are holding yellow_block_1" ✓
3. Held black_block_1 before holding yellow_block_1 ✓
4. "orange_block_1 is clear" or "grey_block_1 is not on the table" (Not satisfied, need to fix) ✗
5. orange_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1 (always satisfied) ✓
6. After orange_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1, grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 ✓
7. orange_block_1 is clear (Not satisfied, need to fix) ✗
8. grey_block_1 is clear ✓
9. Before grey_block_1 is clear, black_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 ✓
10. black_block_1 is not on top of purple_block_1 ✓
11. After black_block_1 is not on top of purple_block_1, white_block_2 is on the table ✓

I missed constraints 4 and 7, which require orange_block_1 to be clear at some point. Let me adjust the plan:

1. unstack white_block_2 orange_block_1
2. putdown white_block_2

Now orange_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraints 4 and 7.

3. pickup black_block_1
4. stack black_block_1 orange_block_1

Now orange_block_1 is not clear anymore due to black_block_1 on top.

5. unstack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1
6. putdown yellow_block_1
7. pickup grey_block_1
8. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1

So, the plan is:
1. unstack white_block_2 orange_block_1
2. putdown white_block_2
3. pickup black_block_1
4. stack black_block_1 orange_block_1
5. unstack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1
6. putdown yellow_block_1
7. pickup grey_block_1
8. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1

Let's check if all constraints are satisfied:
1. "white_block_2 is on the table" ✓
2. "you are holding yellow_block_1" ✓
3. Held black_block_1 before holding yellow_block_1 ✓
4. "orange_block_1 is clear" (satisfied after step 2) ✓
5. orange_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1 (always satisfied) ✓
6. After orange_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1, grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 ✓
7. orange_block_1 is clear (satisfied after step 2) ✓
8. grey_block_1 is clear (satisfied after step 5) ✓
9. Before grey_block_1 is clear, black_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 ✓
10. black_block_1 is not on top of purple_block_1 ✓
11. After black_block_1 is not on top of purple_block_1, white_block_2 is on the table ✓

All constraints are satisfied, and the goal "yellow_block_1 is on the table" is achieved.

Let's trace through to ensure the proper sequencing:

Initial state: yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1, orange_block_1 on the table, black_block_1 on the table, white_block_1 on the table, purple_block_1 on the table, white_block_2 on orange_block_1, grey_block_1 on the table.

Step 1: unstack white_block_2 orange_block_1
Preconditions: white_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1, white_block_2 is clear, robotic arm is not holding any block.
Effects: robotic arm is holding white_block_2, orange_block_1 is clear.

Step 2: putdown white_block_2
Preconditions: robotic arm is holding white_block_2.
Effects: white_block_2 is on the table, white_block_2 is clear, robotic arm is not holding any block.

Step 3: pickup black_block_1
Preconditions: black_block_1 is on the table, black_block_1 is clear, robotic arm is not holding any block.
Effects: robotic arm is holding black_block_1, black_block_1 is not on the table.

Step 4: stack black_block_1 orange_block_1
Preconditions: robotic arm is holding black_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear.
Effects: black_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1, black_block_1 is clear, orange_block_1 is not clear, robotic arm is not holding any block.

Step 5: unstack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1
Preconditions: yellow_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1, yellow_block_1 is clear, robotic arm is not holding any block.
Effects: robotic arm is holding yellow_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear.

Step 6: putdown yellow_block_1
Preconditions: robotic arm is holding yellow_block_1.
Effects: yellow_block_1 is on the table, yellow_block_1 is clear, robotic arm is not holding any block.

Step 7: pickup grey_block_1
Preconditions: grey_block_1 is on the table, grey_block_1 is clear, robotic arm is not holding any block.
Effects: robotic arm is holding grey_block_1, grey_block_1 is not on the table.

Step 8: stack grey_block_1 white_block_1
Preconditions: robotic arm is holding grey_block_1, white_block_1 is clear.
Effects: grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear, white_block_1 is not clear, robotic arm is not holding any block.

The sequence is valid, and we've achieved the goal of having yellow_block_1 on the table while satisfying all constraints. Let me summarize the plan:

1. unstack white_block_2 orange_block_1
2. putdown white_block_2
3. pickup black_block_1
4. stack black_block_1 orange_block_1
5. unstack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1
6. putdown yellow_block_1
7. pickup grey_block_1
8. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1
