Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get yellow_block_1 on the table. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy along the way. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the required goal.

Initially, yellow_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1. So to get it on the table, I need to unstack it from grey_block_1. But wait, the preconditions for unstack are that yellow_block_1 is clear and the arm isn't holding anything. In the initial state, yellow_block_1 is clear, so that's good. So the action would be unstack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1, then put it down. But wait, putting it down would achieve the goal. But maybe there's more steps needed because of the constraints.

Wait, the constraints are a lot. Let's list them one by one:

1. At least one state must have white_block_2 on the table. Currently, white_block_2 is on orange_block_1. So maybe we need to move it to the table at some point.

2. Must hold yellow_block_1 in some state. That's already part of the plan to unstack and putdown, so that's covered.

3. If holding yellow_block_1, there must have been an earlier state where holding black_block_1. So before we can hold yellow, we must have held black_block_1. So we need to pick up black_block_1 at some point before picking up yellow.

4. At least one state must have either orange_block_1 clear or grey_block_1 not on the table. Orange_block_1 initially has white_block_2 on it, so it's not clear. Grey_block_1 is on the table. So to satisfy this, either move white_block_2 off orange_block_1 (making it clear) or move grey_block_1 somewhere else (so it's not on the table).

5. At least one state must have orange_block_1 not on top of yellow_block_1. Well, in the initial state, orange is on the table, so this is already true. So maybe this is automatically satisfied. But wait, maybe after some actions, someone stacks orange on yellow? But that's not part of the goal. So maybe this constraint is already satisfied in the initial state. Wait, the initial state says orange_block_1 is on the table. So orange is not on top of yellow. So the constraint "orange_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1" is already true. But then the next constraint says if that holds in state s, then in s or after, either grey is on white or white is not clear. So we need to ensure that after that condition is true (which it already is), then at some point either grey is on white or white has something on it. Hmm.

6. The next constraint is that orange_block_1 must be clear in at least one state. Currently, white_block_2 is on orange_block_1. So to make orange clear, we need to move white_block_2 off.

7. Grey_block_1 must be clear in at least one state. Initially, yellow is on grey, so grey is not clear. After we unstack yellow, grey becomes clear. So that's covered when we unstack yellow.

8. If grey_block_1 is clear in some state, then before that, either black is on orange or purple has a block on it. So when we unstack yellow from grey, making grey clear, we need to have a prior state where either black is on orange or purple is not clear. So how can we achieve that? Let's see: Initially, purple is clear (on table). So maybe we need to stack something on purple before unstacking yellow.

9. The next constraint is black_block_1 not on purple. Initially, black is on table, so not on purple. So this is already true. But then the constraint says if that's the case, then in that state or after, either white_block_2 is on table or holding yellow. Since black not on purple is already true, we need to ensure that in some state after, white_block_2 is on table or we are holding yellow. Since our plan includes holding yellow (when we unstack it), that's covered.

Wait, but the constraints are a bit interdependent. Let's try to outline the steps needed.

First, the main goal is to get yellow on table. To do that:

1. Unstack yellow from grey.
2. Putdown yellow.

But before unstacking yellow, we need to have held black_block_1. So steps before that:

- Pickup black_block_1 (since it's on table and clear).
- Then putdown black_block_1 (or maybe stack it somewhere, but putting it down would satisfy that we held it earlier).

But also, when we unstack yellow, after that, grey_block_1 is clear. The constraint says that when grey is clear, there must have been a prior state where black is on orange or purple is not clear. So after we unstack yellow, grey is clear. So before that step, we need to have either black on orange or something on purple. But initially, purple is clear. So maybe we need to stack something on purple. Let's see.

Another approach: Let's try to list all constraints and see which steps can satisfy them.

Constraints:

1. white_block_2 on table in some state. Currently, it's on orange. So we need to unstack it and put it down. So maybe we need to do that.

2. Holding yellow_block_1. That's part of the main plan.

3. Before holding yellow, must have held black. So pick up black first.

4. Either orange clear or grey not on table. To get orange clear, unstack white_block_2 from it. So maybe do that.

5. orange not on yellow: already true.

6. orange must be clear in some state: achieved by unstacking white_block_2.

7. grey must be clear in some state: achieved by unstacking yellow.

8. When grey is clear (after unstacking yellow), there must have been a prior state where black is on orange or purple is not clear. So before unstacking yellow, need to either stack black on orange or put something on purple.

9. black not on purple: already true, but the implication is that after that, in some state, white_block_2 is on table or holding yellow. Since we will hold yellow, that's covered.

So the steps would involve:

- Unstack white_block_2 from orange (to make orange clear, satisfying constraint 4 and 6).

But to unstack white_block_2, the preconditions are: white_block_2 is clear (it is), and the arm is empty. So:

Action: unstack white_block_2 orange_block_1.

Then, putdown white_block_2. That puts it on the table, satisfying constraint 1.

Then, we need to handle the constraint that before holding yellow, we must have held black. So:

Pickup black_block_1 (it's on table and clear). Then putdown black_block_1 (or use it for something else). But just picking it up and putting it down would satisfy the constraint.

But also, when we unstack yellow from grey, making grey clear, we need to have prior state where black is on orange or purple is not clear. So before unstacking yellow, we need to have done something to satisfy that.

So perhaps after putting down white_block_2, we need to stack something on purple. But purple is clear. Let's see. Maybe stack black_block_1 on purple_block_1. But stacking requires holding black and purple is clear. So:

After putting down white_block_2, pick up black_block_1 (again), then stack it on purple. But then that would make purple not clear, which satisfies the condition for the constraint when we unstack yellow.

Wait, let me outline possible steps:

1. Unstack white_block_2 orange_block_1 → holding white_block_2.

2. Putdown white_block_2 → white on table (satisfies constraint 1).

3. Now, to satisfy the prior condition for when we unstack yellow (which will make grey clear), we need either black on orange or something on purple. Let's choose to stack something on purple. Let's use black_block_1 for that.

So, pickup black_block_1 (since it's on table and clear).

4. Stack black_block_1 purple_block_1. Now, purple is not clear (satisfies part of constraint 8's condition).

Now, when we unstack yellow, the prior condition (black on orange or purple not clear) is met because purple is not clear.

Then proceed to unstack yellow from grey.

But wait, before unstacking yellow, we need to have held black. So step 3 is pickup black, which satisfies that.

Then, after stacking black on purple, we can proceed to unstack yellow.

But to unstack yellow, we need to have the arm empty. So after stacking black, the arm is empty.

Then:

5. Unstack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1 → holding yellow.

6. Putdown yellow_block_1 → goal achieved.

This sequence would satisfy:

- Step 2: white_block_2 on table.

- Step 5: holding yellow (satisfies constraint 2).

- Step 3: holding black before holding yellow (step 3 before step 5).

- Step 1: After unstacking white_block_2, orange_block_1 is clear (constraint 6 and 4).

- Step 5: After unstacking yellow, grey is clear (constraint 7).

- When grey becomes clear (step 5), the prior condition is that in some earlier state, either black is on orange or purple is not clear. Here, step 4 stacked black on purple, making purple not clear. So that's satisfied.

- The constraint that black not on purple: Initially, black is on table, then stacked on purple. So after step 4, black is on purple, violating the constraint that "black_block_1 is not on top of purple_block_1" must hold in at least one state. Wait, the constraint says "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'black_block_1 is not on top of purple_block_1'". But if we stack black on purple in step 4, then after step 4, black is on purple. So in the initial state, black is not on purple. So that's already satisfied. But the constraint requires that it holds in at least one state. Since initially it's true, that's okay. But the other part of the constraint says that if in some state s, black is not on purple, then in s or after, either white_block_2 is on table or holding yellow. Since in the initial state, black is not on purple, we need to ensure that after that, either white is on table (which we do in step 2) or hold yellow (step 5). So that's satisfied.

Wait, but the constraint says: "If expression 'black_block_1 is not on top of purple_block_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: white_block_2 is on the table, you are holding yellow_block_1' must hold at s or at some state after s." 

In the initial state, black is not on purple. So s is the initial state. Then in the plan, after s, step 2 puts white on table. So that's satisfied.

So putting all together, the steps would be:

1. Unstack white_block_2 orange_block_1

2. Putdown white_block_2

3. Pickup black_block_1

4. Stack black_block_1 purple_block_1

5. Unstack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1

6. Putdown yellow_block_1

Let me check if all constraints are satisfied:

1. white_block_2 on table in step 2: yes.

2. holding yellow in step 5: yes.

3. before step 5, held black in step 3: yes.

4. either orange clear or grey not on table. After step 1, orange is clear. So yes.

5. orange not on yellow: always true.

6. when orange not on yellow (always true), then after that, either grey on white or white not clear. Wait, the constraint says that if orange not on yellow in state s, then in s or after, there's a state where grey is on white or white is not clear. Let's see: in our plan, after step 1, orange is clear, and the other blocks are as per steps. After step 4, black is on purple. The white_block_1 is clear initially and remains so unless something is stacked on it. So perhaps in our current plan, white_block_1 remains clear. So this constraint may not be satisfied.

Wait, the constraint says: If "orange_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1" holds in state s, then there must be a state at or after s where either grey is on white or white is not clear. Since in all states, orange is not on yellow, then this applies. So in the initial state s0, the condition is true. Therefore, after s0, we need to have a state where grey is on white or white has a block on top.

But in our plan, after step 4, black is on purple, white_block_1 is clear. So we might not be satisfying this.

So we need to add a step where either grey is stacked on white_block_1 or something else is stacked on white_block_1.

But how can we do that? Let's see.

Maybe after step 4 (stacking black on purple), we need to stack something on white_block_1. But what blocks are available? Let's see:

After step 2, white_block_2 is on table. orange_block_1 is clear. grey_block_1 has yellow unstacked (later steps). black is on purple. white_block_1 is clear.

So perhaps we can stack white_block_2 on white_block_1. That would make white_block_1 not clear.

So let's add steps:

After step 2 (putdown white_block_2), before step 3 (pickup black), we can:

2a. Pickup white_block_2 (since it's on table and clear).

2b. Stack white_block_2 on white_block_1. Now, white_block_1 has white_block_2 on top, so not clear. This would satisfy the condition that after s0 (initial state), there's a state where white is not clear.

But this would add steps. However, this increases the plan length. The problem says to provide an optimal (shortest) plan. So adding steps may not be optimal. But perhaps this is necessary to satisfy the constraint.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Let's think.

Wait, the constraint says that if in any state s, orange is not on yellow (which is always true), then in s or after, there must be a state where either grey is on white or white is not clear.

So in our initial plan, after step 4, we haven't affected white_block_1. So we need to make sure that after the initial state, at some point white is not clear or grey is on white.

So perhaps in step 4, instead of stacking black on purple, stack black on white_block_1. Then white_block_1 would have black on top, making it not clear.

Let's adjust the plan:

1. Unstack white_block_2 orange_block_1

2. Putdown white_block_2

3. Pickup black_block_1

4. Stack black_block_1 white_block_1

5. Unstack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1

6. Putdown yellow_block_1

Now, after step 4, white_block_1 has black on top, so not clear. This satisfies the constraint.

But then, when we stack black on white, the constraint about purple comes into play. Because when we unstack yellow, making grey clear, we need to have had prior a state where either black was on orange or purple was not clear. In this adjusted plan, after step 4, black is on white, not on orange. Purple remains clear. So the condition for constraint 8 is not met. Because we need to have, before unstacking yellow (step 5), either black on orange or purple not clear. But here, black is on white and purple is still clear. So this violates constraint 8.

So that's a problem. So we need to make sure that before step 5 (unstacking yellow), there is a state where either black is on orange or purple is not clear.

So maybe we need to stack something on purple. Let's revisit.

Alternative plan:

1. Unstack white_block_2 orange_block_1 → hold white2.

2. Putdown white2 → white2 on table.

3. Pickup black → hold black.

4. Stack black on purple → now purple has black, so not clear.

5. Unstack yellow from grey → hold yellow.

6. Putdown yellow.

This way, after step 4, purple is not clear. So when we unstack yellow in step 5, making grey clear, the prior condition (purple not clear) is satisfied. Also, after step 4, black is on purple, which in the initial state, black wasn't, but the constraint requires that at least one state has black not on purple. Since in the initial state, black wasn't on purple, that's satisfied. The other part of that constraint is that whenever black is not on purple, then after that, either white2 is on table or holding yellow. Since in the initial state, black isn't on purple, and after that, we put white2 on table in step 2, which satisfies that.

Now, regarding the constraint that after any state where orange is not on yellow, there's a subsequent state where grey is on white or white is not clear. In this plan, after step 4, black is on purple, and white_block_1 is still clear. So after step 5, we have white_block_1 clear. So this constraint isn't satisfied. Because in the initial state, orange is not on yellow (always true), so we need to ensure that at some point after, white_block_1 has something on it or grey is on white.

Hmm, so this is a problem. So maybe we need to add a step where we stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1. But grey is on the table, and we have yellow_block_1 on grey initially. Wait, no: initially, yellow is on grey. So after unstacking yellow (step5), grey is on the table and clear. So after step5, we can pickup grey and stack it on white.

But that adds steps. Let's see:

After step6 (putdown yellow), we can:

7. Pickup grey_block_1 (since it's on table and clear).

8. Stack grey_block_1 white_block_1 → now white is not clear.

But this adds two steps. But the problem requires the optimal plan, i.e., the shortest possible. So maybe this isn't necessary if we can find another way.

Alternatively, in step4, stack black on white_block_1. Then, white is not clear. But then, when we unstack yellow, we need to ensure that before that, either black is on orange or purple is not clear. But if we stack black on white, then purple is still clear. So that doesn't satisfy the prior condition for constraint8.

So this is tricky. Let's recap:

We need to satisfy:

- When we unstack yellow (step5), grey becomes clear. Then, according to constraint8, there must be an earlier state where black is on orange or purple is not clear.

So if in step4, we stack black on purple, then purple is not clear. So that's okay. But then we need to satisfy the constraint that after any state where orange is not on yellow (which is all states), there's a state where either grey is on white or white is not clear. But in this plan, after step4, purple is not clear, but white is still clear. So this constraint isn't satisfied.

So to fix that, we need to modify the plan to include a step where white is not clear or grey is on white. But how?

Alternative idea: After stacking black on purple (step4), we can stack white_block_2 on white_block_1. So:

1. Unstack white2 from orange.

2. Putdown white2.

3. Pickup black.

4. Stack black on purple.

5. Pickup white2.

6. Stack white2 on white1.

7. Unstack yellow from grey.

8. Putdown yellow.

This way, after step6, white1 has white2 on top, making it not clear. Thus satisfying the constraint that after any state where orange is not on yellow (which is all states), there's a state (step6) where white is not clear.

But this adds steps. Let's see if this is necessary.

The constraint says: If "orange_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1" holds in some state s, then there must be a state after or at s where either grey is on white or white is not clear. Since in all states s, this holds, so in every state s, we need to have after s a state where white is not clear or grey on white. But the problem says "at s or at some state after s". So perhaps as long as there exists at least one state in the plan where this condition is met, that's sufficient.

Wait, the constraint says: If expression A holds in some state s, then expression B must hold in s or after. So if there exists any s where A is true (which it is in all states), then B must hold in s or after. So the plan must have B hold at least once. Because in this case, A is always true. Therefore, the entire plan must have at least one state where B holds. So B is "grey on white or white not clear".

So in our initial plan where we stack black on purple and unstack yellow, we don't have B. So we need to add a step where B is true.

So in the adjusted plan with steps 5 and 6 (stacking white2 on white1), that makes B true (white not clear). So this is necessary.

But this increases the plan's length. So the optimal plan must include these steps. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, can we stack grey on white_block_1? After unstacking yellow, grey is on the table and clear. So after step7 (unstack yellow), we can:

7. Pickup grey.

8. Stack grey on white_block_1.

But then step7 is unstack yellow, putdown. Then pickup grey, stack.

But that's after the goal is achieved. But the constraint requires that after any state s where orange is not on yellow (which includes all states), there's a state after s where B holds. So if we stack grey on white after putting down yellow, then in the states after step8, B holds. So that's acceptable. But this adds steps, making the plan longer.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different way to arrange the blocks.

Wait, after step4, if we stack black on purple, then we can pick up white_block_2 (which is on table) and stack it on white_block_1. That would make white_block_1 not clear. So:

1. Unstack white2 from orange → hold white2.

2. Putdown white2.

3. Pickup black.

4. Stack black on purple.

5. Pickup white2.

6. Stack white2 on white1 → now white1 is not clear.

7. Unstack yellow from grey → hold yellow.

8. Putdown yellow.

This plan has 8 steps. But does it satisfy all constraints?

Check:

Constraint requiring after any state s (since orange is not on yellow in all s) that there's a state where B holds. In this plan, after step6, B holds (white not clear). So this is satisfied.

Constraint8: when grey is clear (after unstacking yellow in step7), we need prior state where black on orange or purple not clear. After step4, purple has black, so not clear. So that's satisfied.

Other constraints:

- white2 on table: step2.

- holding yellow: step7.

- before holding yellow, held black: step3.

- orange clear: step1.

- grey clear: after step7.

- black not on purple: in initial state, yes.

- after black not on purple (initial state), in step2 white2 on table, which satisfies the implication.

So this plan would satisfy all constraints but is 8 steps. However, maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, perhaps after step4 (stack black on purple), we can use another block to stack on white1. But what blocks are available? After step4, black is on purple. The available blocks on table are white_block_1, purple_block_1 (with black), orange_block_1 (clear), grey_block_1 (with yellow), black_block_1 (stacked on purple), white_block_2 (on table after step2). So white_block_2 is on table. So after step4, we can pickup white2 and stack it on white1.

So steps:

1. Unstack white2 from orange.

2. Putdown white2.

3. Pickup black.

4. Stack black on purple.

5. Pickup white2.

6. Stack white2 on white1.

7. Unstack yellow from grey.

8. Putdown yellow.

This is 8 steps.

But maybe we can combine steps. For example, after unstacking white2 (step1), can we stack it directly on white1 instead of putting it down and picking it up again?

Let's try:

1. Unstack white2 from orange.

2. Stack white2 on white1. → now white1 is not clear.

3. Pickup black.

4. Stack black on purple.

5. Unstack yellow from grey.

6. Putdown yellow.

This plan has 6 steps.

Check constraints:

- white2 on table: No, white2 is stacked on white1. So constraint1 requires that white2 is on table at least once. So this plan doesn't satisfy constraint1. So invalid.

So we need to have white2 on table at least once. So step2 in this case would violate that.

Therefore, we need to put white2 down at least once. So the previous plan of 8 steps is necessary.

Alternatively, maybe after stacking white2 on white1, we can put it back down later, but that would add more steps.

Alternatively, is there a way to have white2 on table in one step and then stack it on white1 in another step, but without adding steps?

Wait, the initial plan with 8 steps may be necessary. Let's check all constraints again with that plan.

Plan steps:

1. Unstack white_block_2 orange_block_1 → holding white2.

2. Putdown white2 → white2 on table (satisfies constraint1).

3. Pickup black_block_1 → holding black (satisfies part of constraint3).

4. Stack black_block_1 purple_block_1 → black on purple, purple not clear (helps with constraint8).

5. Pickup white_block_2 → holding white2 again.

6. Stack white_block_2 white_block_1 → white1 not clear (satisfies constraint B).

7. Unstack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1 → holding yellow (satisfies constraint2 and part of constraint3).

8. Putdown yellow_block_1 → goal achieved.

Now, check all constraints:

1. white2 on table in step2: yes.

2. holding yellow in step7: yes.

3. before step7 (step3) held black: yes.

4. either orange clear or grey not on table: orange is clear after step1, so yes.

5. orange not on yellow: always true.

6. orange clear in step1: yes.

7. grey clear after step7: yes.

8. when grey is clear (step7), prior state (step4) where purple not clear: yes.

9. black not on purple: in initial state (yes), and after step4, black is on purple. But the constraint requires that black not on purple in at least one state. Initial state satisfies it.

10. For the constraint that if black not on purple in state s, then after s, white2 on table or holding yellow. In the initial state (s), black is not on purple. After that, step2 puts white2 on table: satisfied.

11. The constraint that after any state where orange not on yellow, there's a state where grey on white or white not clear. After step6, white is not clear: satisfied.

So this plan satisfies all constraints. But it's 8 steps. Is there a shorter plan?

Alternative plan:

Maybe after putting down white2, instead of stacking black on purple and then stacking white2 on white1, we can stack black on white1. Then:

1. Unstack white2 from orange → hold white2.

2. Putdown white2 → white2 on table.

3. Pickup black → hold black.

4. Stack black on white1 → white1 not clear.

5. Unstack yellow from grey → hold yellow.

6. Putdown yellow.

This is 6 steps. Check constraints:

Constraint8: When grey becomes clear (step5), prior state must have black on orange or purple not clear. In this plan, after step4, black is on white1, and purple remains clear. So no, doesn't satisfy constraint8. So invalid.

Thus, the initial 8-step plan seems necessary.

But maybe there's a shorter path. Let's think differently.

What if after unstacking white2 and putting it down, we stack black on orange. Then:

1. Unstack white2 from orange.

2. Putdown white2.

3. Pickup black.

4. Stack black on orange.

5. Unstack yellow from grey.

6. Putdown yellow.

Now, check constraints:

- Constraint1: white2 on table: yes.

- Constraint2: holding yellow: yes.

- Constraint3: held black before yellow: yes.

- Constraint4: orange clear after step1 (yes), so satisfied.

- Constraint5: orange not on yellow: yes.

- Constraint6: orange clear in step1: yes.

- Constraint7: grey clear after step5: yes.

- Constraint8: after step5, grey is clear. Prior state (step4) has black on orange, so satisfies the condition.

- The other constraint about B (grey on white or white not clear): in this plan, white_block_1 is clear throughout. So no. So need to add steps to stack something on white.

But this plan doesn't satisfy that. So again, need to stack something on white.

Thus, the 8-step plan is required.

But maybe there's another way. Suppose after stacking black on orange (step4), then stack grey on white. But how?

After step4, black is on orange. So orange is not clear. To stack grey on white, need to unstack black from orange. But that's adding more steps. Not optimal.

Alternatively, after step5 (unstack yellow), grey is clear. Then, stack grey on white.

1. Unstack white2 from orange.

2. Putdown white2.

3. Pickup black.

4. Stack black on orange.

5. Unstack yellow from grey.

6. Putdown yellow.

7. Pickup grey.

8. Stack grey on white.

Now, this is 8 steps. But this adds steps after achieving the goal. However, the constraint B is satisfied in step8. But the problem requires the goal to be achieved, but the constraints must be satisfied in the plan. The goal is achieved at step6. The rest of the steps are part of the plan to satisfy constraints.

But the problem says the plan must bring about the goal and satisfy all constraints. So even after achieving the goal, additional steps may be needed for constraints.

But this plan would have 8 steps, and satisfies all constraints:

- B is satisfied in step8.

But this is longer than necessary.

Alternatively, after step4 (stack black on orange), we can unstack black from orange and stack on white. But this requires:

5. Unstack black from orange.

6. Putdown black.

7. Pickup black again.

8. Stack black on white.

This is getting too long.

Thus, the 8-step plan seems necessary.

But wait, in the initial plan where we stack black on purple and then stack white2 on white1, the steps are 8. But maybe there's a way to reduce that.

Wait, after step4 (stack black on purple), we can stack white2 on white1 without putting it down first. Wait, white2 is on the table after step2. So after step4, we can pickup white2 (which is on table and clear) and stack on white1. So steps:

1. Unstack white2 from orange.

2. Putdown white2.

3. Pickup black.

4. Stack black on purple.

5. Pickup white2.

6. Stack white2 on white1.

7. Unstack yellow from grey.

8. Putdown yellow.

Yes, this is 8 steps. So that's the same as before.
