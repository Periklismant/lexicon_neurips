Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. First, I need to understand the initial state and the goal. The goal is to have blue_block_1 on top of yellow_block_2. The initial state has several blocks on the table or stacked. Let me list them out:

- yellow_block_1 is on the table with white_block_1 on top.
- grey_block_1 is on the table with grey_block_2 on top.
- black_block_1, yellow_block_2, and blue_block_1 are all on the table and clear.

So the main task is to move blue_block_1 to yellow_block_2. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy as well. Let's look at each constraint and see how they affect the plan.

First constraint: At some state, the robot must be holding grey_block_1 and blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1. So we need to have a step where blue is on black, and during that time, we're holding grey_1.

Second: At some point, grey_block_1 must be clear. Initially, grey_block_1 has grey_block_2 on it. So maybe we need to unstack grey_2 from grey_1 to make grey_1 clear.

Third: At some state, either grey_1 is on white_1 or yellow_1 is clear. Initially, white_1 is on yellow_1, so yellow_1 isn't clear. To make yellow_1 clear, we need to remove white_1. Or we can put grey_1 on white_1. But since the goal doesn't involve white_1 or yellow_1, maybe moving white_1 off would be necessary for some constraint.

Fourth: At some state, yellow_1 is not on the table (so it's on another block) and black_1 is not clear (has a block on top). Since yellow_1 is initially on the table, we need to move it. But the goal doesn't involve yellow_1, so this might be a detour. Also, black_1 needs a block on it. Blue_block_1 on black_block_1 could satisfy part of this, but we also need yellow_1 not on the table. So maybe stack yellow_1 onto some block, but which one? Maybe stack it onto black_1, but then that would make black_1 not clear, which is part of the fourth constraint.

Fifth: Blue_block_1 is not on the table. The goal requires it to be on yellow_2, which satisfies this. But this constraint needs to be true at some state, which the final state does. But also, there's a sixth constraint: if blue is not on the table in some state, there must be an earlier state where yellow_2 has a block on top. Wait, but the goal is blue on yellow_2. So when blue is placed on yellow_2, that makes yellow_2 not clear. But before that, maybe we need to have another block on yellow_2 temporarily? That complicates things. But the sixth constraint says that whenever blue is not on the table (which will be true once it's stacked), there must have been a prior state where yellow_2 had a block on it. So maybe we need to first put some block on yellow_2, then remove it before placing blue. But that's extra steps. Hmm.

Seventh: At some state, yellow_2 is clear. Initially, it's clear. So maybe the initial state satisfies this, but if we ever put something on it, we need to clear it again. But the goal requires blue on it, so after that, it's not clear. So maybe the initial state counts, but we need to check if the constraints require it to hold at some state during the plan. Since the seventh constraint says it must hold in at least one state, and the initial state does, but if during the plan we put something on yellow_2 and then remove it, that could work. But the sixth constraint requires that if blue is not on the table (which is the case in the final state), there must have been a prior state where yellow_2 had a block on top. So we have to have a state where yellow_2 has a block on top before the final step. So perhaps we need to place a block on yellow_2 and then remove it, then place blue. But how?

Eighth constraint: If yellow_2 is clear in some state s, then either blue is on black_1 or grey_2 is on the table at s or later. Since the initial state has yellow_2 clear, we need to ensure that after that, either blue is on black_1 or grey_2 is on the table. But grey_2 is initially on grey_1. So maybe moving grey_2 to the table would satisfy that. But the plan might involve moving grey_2, so putting it down would make it on the table again.

Ninth constraint: At some state, the robot is holding blue_block_1. Which would happen when we pick it up to stack it on yellow_2. But the tenth constraint says that if we're holding blue_block_1, there must have been an earlier state where grey_2 was on top of blue_block_1. But initially, blue is on the table and clear. So to have grey_2 on blue, we need to stack grey_2 on blue. Then later unstack it, and then pick up blue. So this seems like an additional step.

This is getting complex. Let's outline the steps needed considering all constraints.

First, the goal is blue on yellow_2. To do that, we need to pickup blue and stack it on yellow_2. But before that, yellow_2 must be clear. However, according to constraint six, when blue is not on the table (i.e., after stacking), we need to have had a prior state where yellow_2 was not clear. So perhaps we need to first place another block on yellow_2, then remove it. Let's say we place grey_2 on yellow_2, then unstack it. Then stack blue on yellow_2. But that adds steps. Let's see.

But also, constraint ten requires that if we hold blue_block_1 (which we will do when stacking it), there must have been an earlier state where grey_2 was on blue. So we need to stack grey_2 on blue, then unstack it, then pick up blue. But initially, blue is on the table. So steps would be: stack grey_2 on blue, then unstack grey_2 from blue (putting it back on table?), then pickup blue. But stacking grey_2 on blue requires that we have grey_2. Initially, grey_2 is on grey_1. So first, we need to unstack grey_2 from grey_1, then maybe put it down, then stack it on blue. Let's track:

1. Unstack grey_2 from grey_1. Now holding grey_2. Then putdown grey_2. Now grey_2 is on table. Then, to stack grey_2 on blue, need to pick up grey_2 and stack on blue. But blue is on the table and clear. So:

2. pickup grey_2 (from table), stack grey_2 on blue. Now, grey_2 is on blue. Then later, unstack grey_2 from blue, put it down, then pickup blue. But this seems like a lot of steps. However, this would satisfy constraint ten: when we hold blue, there was a prior state (step 2) where grey_2 was on blue.

But this is adding steps. Let's see if there's a smarter way. Alternatively, maybe stack grey_2 on blue_block_1 first. To do that:

- Unstack grey_2 from grey_1 (since it's on grey_1 initially). Then stack grey_2 on blue_block_1. Then later, unstack grey_2 from blue, then pickup blue and stack on yellow_2. But how does this affect other constraints?

Also, constraint one requires that at some state, the robot is holding grey_block_1 and blue is on black_block_1. So during the plan, we need to have a step where blue is on black and we're holding grey_1. So to get blue on black, we need to stack blue on black. But then we need to move it from there to yellow_2. So perhaps:

- Stack blue on black (satisfying part of constraint one), then later move it. But how do we get grey_1 in hand while blue is on black?

Hmm. Let's break down each constraint and see how to fit them in.

Constraint 1: Must have a state where holding grey_1 and blue is on black_1. So steps needed:

- Move blue to black_1 (stack blue on black_1).
- At the same time, be holding grey_1. So perhaps during the process of stacking blue on black, we first have to pick up blue, stack it on black. Then later, when we need to hold grey_1, maybe unstack grey_1 from somewhere. Wait, but grey_1 is on the table initially with grey_2 on it. So to hold grey_1, we need to unstack grey_2 from grey_1 first, then putdown grey_2, then pickup grey_1. But in that case, when we pickup grey_1, blue might already be on black_1. So maybe the sequence is:

- Unstack grey_2 from grey_1.
- Putdown grey_2.
- Stack blue on black_1.
- Pickup grey_1.

But after stacking blue on black_1, to pick up grey_1, we need to make sure it's clear. Since grey_1 was on the table and after putting down grey_2, it's clear. So after stacking blue on black_1, we can pickup grey_1. At this point, we're holding grey_1 and blue is on black_1, satisfying constraint 1.

Then, after that, we can putdown grey_1 or stack it elsewhere.

Constraint 4: At some state, yellow_1 is not on the table and black_1 is not clear (has a block on top). Since yellow_1 is initially on the table with white_block_1 on top. To make yellow_1 not on the table, we need to move it. But how? Since white_block_1 is on top of yellow_1, we need to unstack white_1 first. So:

- Unstack white_1 from yellow_1. Then, we can move yellow_1. But moving yellow_1 would require picking it up. So after unstacking white_1, put it down, then pickup yellow_1 and stack it somewhere. Where? Maybe stack it on black_1, but black_1 might have blue on it from earlier steps. Wait, if we stack yellow_1 on black_1 after blue is on black_1, that's not possible because blue would be on top. So maybe stack yellow_1 on another block. Alternatively, stack yellow_1 on white_1. But white_1 is on the table after we put it down.

Alternatively, after moving white_1, stack yellow_1 on white_1. Let's see:

- Unstack white_1 from yellow_1. Now holding white_1, put it down. Now white_1 is on table. Then pickup yellow_1 (since it's clear now) and stack it on white_1. Then, yellow_1 is not on the table, which satisfies part of constraint 4. Also, if black_1 has blue on it (from earlier steps), then black_1 is not clear. So that would satisfy constraint 4.

So steps so far:

1. Unstack grey_2 from grey_1. (Now holding grey_2)
2. Putdown grey_2. (grey_2 on table)
3. Unstack white_1 from yellow_1. (holding white_1)
4. Putdown white_1. (white_1 on table)
5. Pickup yellow_1. (holding yellow_1)
6. Stack yellow_1 on white_1. (yellow_1 not on table, on white_1)
7. Pickup blue_block_1. (blue was on table, clear)
8. Stack blue_block_1 on black_block_1. (now blue is on black, which helps constraint 1 and 4)
9. Now, need to hold grey_1 while blue is on black. Since after step 2, grey_1 is clear (since grey_2 was removed). So next step:
10. Pickup grey_block_1. (now holding grey_1, and blue is on black_1. This satisfies constraint 1)
11. Then putdown grey_block_1 or stack it somewhere.

But wait, after step 10, we have to handle the rest of the plan. The main goal is to get blue on yellow_2. But currently, blue is on black_1. So need to unstack blue from black_1, then stack on yellow_2. But to do that, yellow_2 must be clear. Also, constraint 6: if blue is not on table (which it is after being stacked on black_1 and later on yellow_2), there must be a prior state where yellow_2 was not clear. So we need to have a block on yellow_2 before stacking blue. How?

Maybe after step 2, put grey_2 on yellow_2, then unstack it. Let's insert steps:

After step 2 (grey_2 on table), maybe:

3. Pickup grey_2 (from table)
4. Stack grey_2 on yellow_2. (now yellow_2 has grey_2 on it)
5. Then unstack grey_2 from yellow_2. (holding grey_2, put it down again)
6. Now, proceed with the rest.

But this adds steps. Then, when we later stack blue on yellow_2, the sixth constraint is satisfied because before blue was placed, yellow_2 had grey_2 on it.

But this is getting complicated. Let's try to outline all necessary steps considering all constraints.

Let's try to build the plan step by step, making sure all constraints are met.

First, constraints that need to be addressed early:

- Constraint 10: When holding blue, there must have been an earlier state where grey_2 was on blue. So before picking up blue, we need to have grey_2 on blue.

So steps required:

1. Move grey_2 to blue.

How? Initially, grey_2 is on grey_1. So unstack grey_2 from grey_1, then stack it on blue.

So:

1. Unstack grey_2 from grey_1. (Now holding grey_2)
2. Stack grey_2 on blue_block_1. (Now grey_2 is on blue, blue is on table. This satisfies the condition for constraint 10.)

Now, later when we unstack grey_2 from blue, we can then pickup blue.

Next, constraint 1: Need to hold grey_1 while blue is on black_1.

To get blue on black_1, after picking it up, stack it on black_1. But before that, we need to have moved grey_2 from blue.

So steps after step 2:

3. Unstack grey_2 from blue_block_1. (Now holding grey_2)
4. Putdown grey_2. (grey_2 on table)
5. Pickup blue_block_1. (blue is clear now)
6. Stack blue_block_1 on black_block_1. (blue is on black)

Now, to satisfy constraint 1: hold grey_1 while blue is on black.

grey_1 is currently clear (since grey_2 was moved off). So:

7. Pickup grey_block_1. (holding grey_1, blue is on black_1. This satisfies constraint 1)
8. Putdown grey_block_1. (grey_1 on table, clear)

Now, constraint 4: yellow_1 not on table and black_1 not clear. We have black_1 not clear (blue on it). Now, need to make yellow_1 not on table. Currently, yellow_1 has white_block_1 on top. So:

9. Unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (holding white_1)
10. Putdown white_block_1. (white_1 on table)
11. Pickup yellow_block_1. (now holding yellow_1)
12. Stack yellow_block_1 on white_block_1. (yellow_1 not on table, satisfies part of constraint 4. Now, black_1 has blue on it, so both parts of constraint 4 are met.)

Constraint 3: At some state, either grey_1 is on white_1 or yellow_1 is clear. In the current state, yellow_1 is on white_1, so yellow_1 is not clear (since it's stacked on white_1). But if we have a state where grey_1 is on white_1, that would satisfy. Alternatively, after step 12, yellow_1 is on white_1, so yellow_1 is not clear. But perhaps earlier steps may satisfy this. For example, after step 10, white_1 is on the table, and yellow_1 is clear. So at step 11, when we pick up yellow_1, the state before that (step 10) has yellow_1 clear. So that state satisfies the third constraint (yellow_1 is clear). So that's covered.

Constraint 2: grey_block_1 must be clear at some state. After step 7, when we picked up grey_block_1, we put it down in step 8. So after step 8, grey_block_1 is on the table and clear. So that's covered.

Constraint 5: blue is not on table. After step 6, blue is on black_1, so not on table. This is satisfied.

Constraint 6: If blue is not on table (which it is from step 6 onwards), there must have been an earlier state where yellow_2 was not clear. But we haven't touched yellow_2 yet. So this is a problem. Because in the current plan, yellow_2 remains clear until we stack blue on it. So when we stack blue on yellow_2 (which is the goal), blue is not on table, and the prior state must have yellow_2 not clear. But we haven't done anything with yellow_2 yet. So we need to ensure that before stacking blue on yellow_2, there was a block on yellow_2.

So we need to add steps where we put a block on yellow_2, then remove it. Let's say we use grey_2 for that. So after step 4 (grey_2 on table), we can stack grey_2 on yellow_2, then unstack it.

Insert steps after step 4:

5. Pickup grey_block_2. (from table)
6. Stack grey_block_2 on yellow_block_2. (now yellow_2 has grey_2)
7. Unstack grey_block_2 from yellow_block_2. (holding grey_2)
8. Putdown grey_block_2. (back on table)

Now, this satisfies constraint 6, because when blue is not on the table (after step 6 in original plan, which is now step 10), there was an earlier state (step 6) where yellow_2 had grey_2 on it.

But this adds more steps. Let's adjust the steps with this in mind.

Revised steps:

1. Unstack grey_2 from grey_1. (hold grey_2)
2. Stack grey_2 on blue_block_1. (grey_2 on blue)
3. Unstack grey_2 from blue_block_1. (hold grey_2)
4. Stack grey_2 on yellow_block_2. (now yellow_2 not clear)
5. Unstack grey_2 from yellow_block_2. (hold grey_2)
6. Putdown grey_2. (grey_2 on table)
7. Pickup blue_block_1. (now blue is clear)
8. Stack blue_block_1 on black_block_1. (blue on black)
9. Pickup grey_1. (now grey_1 in hand, blue on black)
10. Putdown grey_1. (grey_1 on table)
11. Unstack white_1 from yellow_1. (hold white_1)
12. Putdown white_1. (white_1 on table)
13. Pickup yellow_1. (hold yellow_1)
14. Stack yellow_1 on white_1. (yellow_1 not on table)
15. Now, need to move blue from black to yellow_2. But yellow_2 is clear now (after step 6). So:

15. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1. (hold blue)
16. Stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_2. (goal achieved)

But wait, when we stack blue on yellow_2 in step 16, blue is not on table, so constraint 6 requires that before this, there was a state where yellow_2 was not clear. Which was satisfied in step 4 (grey_2 on yellow_2). So that's okay.

Now, let's check all constraints:

Constraint 1: During step 9, holding grey_1 and blue is on black_1 (step 8). Yes.

Constraint 2: After step 10, grey_1 is on table and clear. Yes.

Constraint 3: After step 11, when we unstack white_1 from yellow_1, yellow_1 becomes clear. So in the state after step 11 (before putting down white_1), yellow_1 is clear. Or after step 12, when white_1 is on table, yellow_1 is clear. So that satisfies the third constraint (either grey_1 on white_1 or yellow_1 clear). So at step 12, yellow_1 is clear. That works.

Constraint 4: After step 14, yellow_1 is not on table (stacked on white_1), and black_1 has blue on it (step 8). So both conditions met.

Constraint 5: blue is not on table after step 8 and 16. Yes.

Constraint 6: When blue is not on table (steps 8,16), there was a prior state (step 4) where yellow_2 had grey_2. Yes.

Constraint 7: yellow_2 is clear in the initial state and after step 6. So step 0 (initial) satisfies it.

Constraint 8: When yellow_2 is clear (initial state, after step 6, after step 16?), need to have blue on black_1 or grey_2 on table. After step 6, grey_2 is on table. So in the initial state, yellow_2 is clear, and grey_2 is on grey_1. But the constraint says that if yellow_2 is clear in state s, then in s or later, blue on black or grey_2 on table. In the initial state, grey_2 is on grey_1, not on table. So that's a problem. Wait, but after step 6, grey_2 is on table. So any time after step 6, if yellow_2 is clear, grey_2 is on table. So when we have yellow_2 clear after step 6, the constraint is satisfied because grey_2 is on table. For the initial state, which is before any actions, the constraint requires that either blue is on black_1 (which isn't until step 8) or grey_2 is on table (which isn't until step 6). So the initial state violates the eighth constraint. Wait, no: the eighth constraint says if yellow_2 is clear in state s, then in s or later, either blue on black or grey_2 on table. So in the initial state, yellow_2 is clear. So we need to ensure that either in the initial state or later, blue is on black or grey_2 is on table. Since in step 6, grey_2 is on table, which is after the initial state. So the initial state's condition is satisfied because in a later state (step 6), grey_2 is on table. So that's okay.

Constraint 9: The robot must hold blue_block_1 at some state. Steps 7 and 15: yes.

Constraint 10: When holding blue (steps 7,15), there must have been an earlier state where grey_2 was on blue. That's step 2. Yes.

Now, let's check if all steps are valid.

Step-by-step validation:

1. Unstack grey_2 from grey_1: grey_2 is on grey_1, both clear. Valid.

2. Stack grey_2 on blue_block_1: holding grey_2, blue is clear. Valid.

3. Unstack grey_2 from blue_block_1: grey_2 is on blue, clear. Valid.

4. Stack grey_2 on yellow_block_2: holding grey_2, yellow_2 is clear. Valid.

5. Unstack grey_2 from yellow_block_2: holding grey_2, yellow_2 has grey_2. Valid.

6. Putdown grey_2: valid.

7. Pickup blue_block_1: blue is on table, clear. Valid.

8. Stack blue on black_block_1: holding blue, black is clear. Valid.

9. Pickup grey_1: grey_1 is on table, clear. Valid.

10. Putdown grey_1: valid.

11. Unstack white_1 from yellow_1: white is on yellow_1, both clear. Valid.

12. Putdown white_1: valid.

13. Pickup yellow_1: yellow_1 is on table, clear. Valid.

14. Stack yellow_1 on white_1: holding yellow_1, white_1 is clear. Valid.

15. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1: blue is on black, clear. Valid.

16. Stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_2: holding blue, yellow_2 is clear. Valid.

Yes, all steps seem valid. Now let's check if all constraints are met:

- Constraint 1: Step 9 (holding grey_1) and blue is on black (step 8 onwards). Yes.

- Constraint 2: Step 10: grey_1 is on table, clear. Yes.

- Constraint 3: After step 12, yellow_1 is clear. Yes.

- Constraint 4: After step 14, yellow_1 is not on table, and black_1 has blue. Yes.

- Constraint 5: Blue not on table in steps 8 and 16. Yes.

- Constraint 6: When blue is not on table (steps 8,16), prior state step 4 where yellow_2 had grey_2. Yes.

- Constraint 7: Initial state and after step 6, yellow_2 is clear. Yes.

- Constraint 8: In initial state (yellow_2 clear), later step 6 has grey_2 on table. Yes.

- Constraint 9: Steps 7 and 15 hold blue. Yes.

- Constraint 10: When holding blue in steps 7 and 15, prior step 2 had grey_2 on blue. Yes.

This seems to satisfy all constraints. Now, is this the optimal (shortest) plan? Let's count the steps: 16 actions. But maybe there's a shorter way. For example, after step 2 (grey_2 on blue), can we use that state to also satisfy other constraints?

Alternatively, when we stack grey_2 on yellow_2, maybe we can leave it there and then stack blue on top. But then yellow_2 would have grey_2 and blue. But the goal is blue on yellow_2, which requires that blue is directly on yellow_2. So that's not possible unless we first remove grey_2.

Alternatively, if we can stack blue on grey_2 which is on yellow_2, but that would require that grey_2 is clear. So steps:

- stack grey_2 on yellow_2.

- stack blue on grey_2.

But that would make blue on grey_2 on yellow_2. The goal is blue on yellow_2, so that doesn't meet the goal. Thus, we need to have only blue on yellow_2.

Therefore, the previous plan seems necessary. But perhaps there's a shorter path. For example, combining some steps.

Wait, in step 4, after stacking grey_2 on yellow_2, then step 5 unstacks it. Maybe instead of moving grey_2 to yellow_2 and back, can we use another block to satisfy constraint 6?

Alternatively, use white_block_1. After moving white_1 from yellow_1, put it on yellow_2, then remove it. But that would add more steps. Let's see:

Alternative approach:

After unstacking white_1 from yellow_1 (step 11), stack it on yellow_2 (step 12), then unstack it (step 13), then proceed. Then, when blue is stacked on yellow_2, the prior state would have had white_1 on yellow_2. But this also adds steps. So perhaps the original plan is the most efficient.

Another thought: When we stack grey_2 on blue (step 2), then unstack (step3), then stack on yellow_2 (step4), unstack (step5), putdown (step6). This uses grey_2 to satisfy multiple constraints. But this is necessary for constraint 6 and 10.

Alternatively, can we stack another block on yellow_2? Like black_block_1? But black is on table and clear. But stacking something on black would conflict with constraint 4, which requires black to have a block. But maybe not. Wait, constraint 4 requires that yellow_1 is not on table and black_1 is not clear. So as long as black_1 has a block (like blue), it's okay.

But I think the original plan is the way to go. Now, let's write the plan in the required format.
