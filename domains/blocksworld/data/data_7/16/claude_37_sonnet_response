Let me analyze this problem step by step:

First, I'll visualize the initial state:
- green_block_1 on table with grey_block_2 on top of it
- grey_block_1 on table with orange_block_1 on top of it
- orange_block_1 has brown_block_1 on top of it
- black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2 (and is clear)
- black_block_2 is on the table (and is clear)

Visual representation:
```
   black_block_1    brown_block_1   black_block_2
        |                |               
   grey_block_2     orange_block_1       
        |                |               
   green_block_1    grey_block_1        
        |                |
      table            table            table
```

The goal is to be holding green_block_1.

Now let me go through the constraints:

1. At some point we need to be holding orange_block_1 while black_block_2 has something on top of it.
2. At some point black_block_1 must have something on top of it.
3. Before black_block_1 has something on top of it, either brown_block_1 must be on the table or grey_block_1 must not be on the table.
4. black_block_1 must never be on the table.
5. At some point, grey_block_2 must be on top of green_block_1 (which it is initially).
6. If grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1, then sometime after that, grey_block_2 must be on top of black_block_2.
7. grey_block_2 must never be on the table.
8. At some point, grey_block_2 must not be on top of orange_block_1 (which is true initially).
9. If grey_block_2 is not on top of orange_block_1, then sometime after that, brown_block_1 must be on top of grey_block_2.
10. At some point, either brown_block_1 is on the table or we are holding grey_block_1.

I need to plan actions to achieve the goal of holding green_block_1 while satisfying all these constraints.

Let's start by thinking about what we need to do to get to green_block_1, which is at the bottom of a stack.

Initial steps would be to clear green_block_1 by removing everything above it. But I need to be careful about the constraints.

Let me think about a high-level plan:

1. Grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1 (satisfying constraint 5).
2. Grey_block_2 must later be on top of black_block_2 (constraint 6).
3. Grey_block_2 must never be on the table (constraint 7).
4. I need to have brown_block_1 on top of grey_block_2 at some point (constraint 9).
5. Black_block_1 must have something on top of it at some point (constraint 2).
6. I need to be holding orange_block_1 while something is on black_block_2 (constraint 1).

Let me trace a potential plan:

1. First, I'll unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_2 (this is necessary to get to green_block_1)
2. Since black_block_1 can't be on the table (constraint 4), I'll stack it on black_block_2
3. Now, I need to place something on top of black_block_1 (constraint 2). But first, I need to satisfy constraint 3: either brown_block_1 on table or grey_block_1 not on table.
4. I'll unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1 and put it on the table (satisfying part of constraint 3)
5. Then I can unstack orange_block_1 from grey_block_1
6. At this point I'm holding orange_block_1, so I need something on black_block_2 to satisfy constraint 1. black_block_1 is already on black_block_2, so this constraint is satisfied.
7. I'll stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1 (satisfying constraint 2)
8. Now I need to work towards putting brown_block_1 on top of grey_block_2 (constraint 9)
9. I'll pickup brown_block_1 from the table
10. I'll unstack grey_block_2 from green_block_1 (to free green_block_1)
11. I can't put grey_block_2 on the table (constraint 7), so I need to stack it somewhere. Let's stack it on black_block_2 (satisfying constraint 6)
12. Now I'll stack brown_block_1 on grey_block_2 (satisfying constraint 9)
13. Now I can pick up green_block_1 (goal achieved)

But wait, I need to check if this plan is feasible and if I've satisfied all constraints. Let me trace through it again with the exact actions and check the state after each action:

Initial state:
```
   black_block_1    brown_block_1   
        |                |               
   grey_block_2     orange_block_1       black_block_2
        |                |               
   green_block_1    grey_block_1        
        |                |
      table            table            table
```

1. `unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2` - Now holding black_block_1, grey_block_2 is clear
2. `stack black_block_1 black_block_2` - black_block_1 is on black_block_2, not holding anything
3. `unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1` - Now holding brown_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear
4. `putdown brown_block_1` - brown_block_1 is on the table, not holding anything
5. `unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1` - Now holding orange_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear

At this point, I'm holding orange_block_1 and black_block_1 is on black_block_2, which means black_block_2 is not clear. This satisfies constraint 1.

6. `stack orange_block_1 black_block_1` - orange_block_1 is on black_block_1, black_block_1 is not clear (satisfying constraint 2), not holding anything
7. `pickup brown_block_1` - Now holding brown_block_1
8. `unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1` - Now holding grey_block_2, green_block_1 is clear, brown_block_1 is on floor
   Hmm, wait, there's a problem here. I can't be holding both brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 at the same time.

Let me reconsider my plan:

1. `unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2` - Now holding black_block_1, grey_block_2 is clear
2. `stack black_block_1 black_block_2` - black_block_1 is on black_block_2, not holding anything
3. `unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1` - Now holding brown_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear
4. `putdown brown_block_1` - brown_block_1 is on the table, not holding anything (this satisfies part of constraint 3)
5. `unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1` - Now holding orange_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear

At this point, I'm holding orange_block_1 and black_block_1 is on black_block_2, which means black_block_2 is not clear. This satisfies constraint 1.

6. `stack orange_block_1 black_block_1` - orange_block_1 is on black_block_1, black_block_1 is not clear (satisfying constraint 2), not holding anything
7. `unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1` - Now holding grey_block_2, green_block_1 is clear
8. `stack grey_block_2 black_block_2` - grey_block_2 is on black_block_2, satisfying constraint 6, not holding anything
9. `pickup brown_block_1` - Now holding brown_block_1
10. `stack brown_block_1 grey_block_2` - brown_block_1 is on grey_block_2, satisfying constraint 9, not holding anything
11. `pickup green_block_1` - Now holding green_block_1, goal achieved

Let me check if this plan satisfies all constraints:

1. Constraint: At some point, I'm holding orange_block_1 while black_block_2 has something on top of it (black_block_1) - Satisfied after step 5
2. Constraint: At some point, black_block_1 has something on top of it - Satisfied after step 6 when orange_block_1 is on black_block_1
3. Constraint: Before black_block_1 has something on top of it, either brown_block_1 must be on the table or grey_block_1 must not be on the table - Satisfied because after step 4, brown_block_1 is on the table
4. Constraint: black_block_1 must never be on the table - Satisfied, black_block_1 goes from grey_block_2 to black_block_2
5. Constraint: At some point, grey_block_2 must be on top of green_block_1 - Satisfied in the initial state
6. Constraint: If grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1, then sometime after that, grey_block_2 must be on top of black_block_2 - Satisfied after step 8
7. Constraint: grey_block_2 must never be on the table - Satisfied, grey_block_2 goes from green_block_1 to black_block_2
8. Constraint: At some point, grey_block_2 must not be on top of orange_block_1 - Satisfied, grey_block_2 is never on top of orange_block_1
9. Constraint: If grey_block_2 is not on top of orange_block_1, then sometime after that, brown_block_1 must be on top of grey_block_2 - Satisfied after step 10
10. Constraint: At some point, either brown_block_1 is on the table or we are holding grey_block_1 - Satisfied after step 4 when brown_block_1 is on the table

This plan seems to satisfy all constraints and achieves the goal. Let me trace through it one more time to make sure I haven't missed anything:

Initial state:
```
   black_block_1    brown_block_1   
        |                |               
   grey_block_2     orange_block_1       black_block_2
        |                |               
   green_block_1    grey_block_1        
        |                |
      table            table            table
```

1. `unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2` - Now holding black_block_1, grey_block_2 is clear
   State: Holding black_block_1, grey_block_2 on green_block_1, orange_block_1 on grey_block_1, brown_block_1 on orange_block_1, black_block_2 on table

2. `stack black_block_1 black_block_2` - black_block_1 is on black_block_2, not holding anything
   State: black_block_1 on black_block_2, grey_block_2 on green_block_1, orange_block_1 on grey_block_1, brown_block_1 on orange_block_1, nothing in hand

3. `unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1` - Now holding brown_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear
   State: Holding brown_block_1, black_block_1 on black_block_2, grey_block_2 on green_block_1, orange_block_1 on grey_block_1

4. `putdown brown_block_1` - brown_block_1 is on the table, not holding anything
   State: brown_block_1 on table, black_block_1 on black_block_2, grey_block_2 on green_block_1, orange_block_1 on grey_block_1, nothing in hand

5. `unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1` - Now holding orange_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear
   State: Holding orange_block_1, brown_block_1 on table, black_block_1 on black_block_2, grey_block_2 on green_block_1, grey_block_1 on table
   (This satisfies constraint 1: holding orange_block_1 while black_block_2 is not clear)

6. `stack orange_block_1 black_block_1` - orange_block_1 is on black_block_1, not holding anything
   State: orange_block_1 on black_block_1, brown_block_1 on table, black_block_1 on black_block_2, grey_block_2 on green_block_1, grey_block_1 on table, nothing in hand
   (This satisfies constraint 2: black_block_1 has something on top of it)

7. `unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1` - Now holding grey_block_2, green_block_1 is clear
   State: Holding grey_block_2, orange_block_1 on black_block_1, brown_block_1 on table, black_block_1 on black_block_2, green_block_1 on table, grey_block_1 on table

8. `stack grey_block_2 black_block_2` - grey_block_2 is on black_block_2, not holding anything
   State: grey_block_2 on black_block_2, orange_block_1 on black_block_1, brown_block_1 on table, black_block_1 on black_block_2, green_block_1 on table, grey_block_1 on table, nothing in hand
   (This satisfies constraint 6: grey_block_2 is on top of black_block_2 after being on green_block_1)

Wait, I made a mistake in step 8. We can't stack grey_block_2 on black_block_2 because black_block_1 is already on black_block_2. Let me reconsider.

7. `unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1` - Now holding grey_block_2, green_block_1 is clear
   State: Holding grey_block_2, orange_block_1 on black_block_1, brown_block_1 on table, black_block_1 on black_block_2, green_block_1 on table, grey_block_1 on table

I need to find a place to put grey_block_2 that isn't the table (constraint 7). Options are: grey_block_1, green_block_1, orange_block_1, or brown_block_1.

Let's try:

8. `stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1` - grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1, not holding anything
   State: grey_block_2 on grey_block_1, orange_block_1 on black_block_1, brown_block_1 on table, black_block_1 on black_block_2, green_block_1 on table, nothing in hand

9. `pickup brown_block_1` - Now holding brown_block_1
   State: Holding brown_block_1, grey_block_2 on grey_block_1, orange_block_1 on black_block_1, black_block_1 on black_block_2, green_block_1 on table

10. `stack brown_block_1 grey_block_2` - brown_block_1 is on grey_block_2, not holding anything
    State: brown_block_1 on grey_block_2, grey_block_2 on grey_block_1, orange_block_1 on black_block_1, black_block_1 on black_block_2, green_block_1 on table, nothing in hand
    (This satisfies constraint 9: brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2 after grey_block_2 is not on top of orange_block_1)

11. `pickup green_block_1` - Now holding green_block_1, goal achieved
    State: Holding green_block_1, brown_block_1 on grey_block_2, grey_block_2 on grey_block_1, orange_block_1 on black_block_1, black_block_1 on black_block_2

But constraint 6 says that grey_block_2 must be on top of black_block_2 after being on green_block_1. This isn't satisfied in my current plan.

I need to revise the plan. The challenging part is that if grey_block_2 needs to be on black_block_2, I need to first move black_block_1 off of black_block_2.

Let me reconsider:

1. `unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2` - Now holding black_block_1, grey_block_2 is clear
2. `stack black_block_1 grey_block_1` - black_block_1 is on grey_block_1, not holding anything
3. `unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1` - Now holding brown_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear
4. `putdown brown_block_1` - brown_block_1 is on the table, not holding anything
5. `unstack orange_block_1 black_block_1` - Now holding orange_block_1, black_block_1 is clear

Wait, I made an error. Let me restart with the initial state:

```
   black_block_1    brown_block_1   
        |                |               
   grey_block_2     orange_block_1       black_block_2
        |                |               
   green_block_1    grey_block_1        
        |                |
      table            table            table
```

1. `unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2` - Now holding black_block_1, grey_block_2 is clear
2. `stack black_block_1 black_block_2` - black_block_1 is on black_block_2, not holding anything
3. `unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1` - Now holding brown_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear
4. `putdown brown_block_1` - brown_block_1 is on the table, not holding anything
5. `unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1` - Now holding orange_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear

At this point, I'm holding orange_block_1 and black_block_1 is on black_block_2, so black_block_2 is not clear. This satisfies constraint 1.

6. `stack orange_block_1 black_block_1` - orange_block_1 is on black_block_1, not holding anything

This satisfies constraint 2: black_block_1 has something on top of it.

7. `unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1` - Now holding grey_block_2, green_block_1 is clear

But we have a problem for constraint 6. Grey_block_2 needs to be on black_block_2 after being on green_block_1, but black_block_2 currently has black_block_1 on it.

I think I need to reorganize the blocks in a way that allows me to satisfy all constraints. Let me try a different approach:

1. `unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1` - Now holding brown_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear
2. `putdown brown_block_1` - brown_block_1 is on the table, not holding anything

This satisfies part of constraint 3: brown_block_1 is on the table.

3. `unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1` - Now holding orange_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear

At this point, I need something on black_block_2 to satisfy constraint 1. But there's nothing there yet.

4. `stack orange_block_1 black_block_2` - orange_block_1 is on black_block_2, not holding anything

Now black_block_2 has something on it, but I've already placed orange_block_1. Let me backtrack and try a different approach.

I think the key observation is that constraint 6 requires grey_block_2 to be on black_block_2 after being on green_block_1, and constraint 7 requires grey_block_2 to never be on the table. This means we need to remove whatever is on black_block_2 to place grey_block_2 there.

Let me approach this differently:

1. `unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2` - Now holding black_block_1, grey_block_2 is clear
2. `stack black_block_1 black_block_2` - black_block_1 is on black_block_2, not holding anything
3. `unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1` - Now holding brown_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear
4. `stack brown_block_1 grey_block_2` - brown_block_1 is on grey_block_2, not holding anything

This satisfies constraint 9: brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2 after grey_block_2 is not on top of orange_block_1.

5. `unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1` - Now holding orange_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear

At this point, I'm holding orange_block_1 and black_block_2 has black_block_1 on it, so constraint 1 is satisfied: holding orange_block_1 while black_block_2 is not clear.

6. `stack orange_block_1 black_block_1` - orange_block_1 is on black_block_1, not holding anything

This satisfies constraint 2: black_block_1 has something on top of it.

7. `unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_2` - Now holding brown_block_1, grey_block_2 is clear
8. `putdown brown_block_1` - brown_block_1 is on the table, not holding anything

9. `unstack orange_block_1 black_block_1` - Now holding orange_block_1, black_block_1 is clear
10. `putdown orange_block_1` - orange_block_1 is on the table, not holding anything

11. `unstack black_block_1 black_block_2` - Now holding black_block_1, black_block_2 is clear

12. `stack black_block_1 grey_block_1` - black_block_1 is on grey_block_1, not holding anything
    (keeping black_block_1 off the table, satisfying constraint 4)

13. `unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1` - Now holding grey_block_2, green_block_1 is clear
14. `stack grey_block_2 black_block_2` - grey_block_2 is on black_block_2, not holding anything

This satisfies constraint 6: grey_block_2 is on black_block_2 after being on green_block_1.

15. `pickup green_block_1` - Now holding green_block_1, goal achieved

Let me verify all constraints one more time:

1. Constraint: At some point, I'm holding orange_block_1 while black_block_2 has something on top of it - Satisfied after step 5
2. Constraint: At some point, black_block_1 has something on top of it - Satisfied after step 6 when orange_block_1 is on black_block_1
3. Constraint: Before black_block_1 has something on top of it, either brown_block_1 must be on the table or grey_block_1 must not be on the table - Satisfied because brown_block_1 is on grey_block_2, not on the table at step 6. But this is a problem! I need to satisfy this constraint.

Let me revise my plan again:

1. `unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2` - Now holding black_block_1, grey_block_2 is clear
2. `stack black_block_1 black_block_2` - black_block_1 is on black_block_2, not holding anything
3. `unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1` - Now holding brown_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear
4. `putdown brown_block_1` - brown_block_1 is on the table, not holding anything

This satisfies part of constraint 3: brown_block_1 is on the table before black_block_1 has something on top of it.

5. `unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1` - Now holding orange_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear

At this point, I'm holding orange_block_1 and black_block_2 has black_block_1 on it, so constraint 1 is satisfied: holding orange_block_1 while black_block_2 is not clear.

6. `stack orange_block_1 black_block_1` - orange_block_1 is on black_block_1, not holding anything

This satisfies constraint 2: black_block_1 has something on top of it.

7. `pickup brown_block_1` - Now holding brown_block_1
8. `stack brown_block_1 grey_block_2` - brown_block_1 is on grey_block_2, not holding anything

This satisfies constraint 9: brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2 after grey_block_2 is not on top of orange_block_1.

9. `unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_2` - Now holding brown_block_1, grey_block_2 is clear
10. `putdown brown_block_1` - brown_block_1 is on the table, not holding anything

11. `unstack orange_block_1 black_block_1` - Now holding orange_block_1, black_block_1 is clear
12. `putdown orange_block_1` - orange_block_1 is on the table, not holding anything

13. `unstack black_block_1 black_block_2` - Now holding black_block_1, black_block_2 is clear
14. `stack black_block_1 grey_block_1` - black_block_1 is on grey_block_1, not holding anything
    (keeping black_block_1 off the table, satisfying constraint 4)

15. `unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1` - Now holding grey_block_2, green_block_1 is clear
16. `stack grey_block_2 black_block_2` - grey_block_2 is on black_block_2, not holding anything

This satisfies constraint 6: grey_block_2 is on black_block_2 after being on green_block_1.

17. `pickup green_block_1` - Now holding green_block_1, goal achieved

Let me check all constraints again:

1. Constraint: At some point, I'm holding orange_block_1 while black_block_2 has something on top of it - Satisfied after step 5
2. Constraint: At some point, black_block_1 has something on top of it - Satisfied after step 6 when orange_block_1 is on black_block_1
3. Constraint: Before black_block_1 has something on top of it, either brown_block_1 must be on the table or grey_block_1 must not be on the table - Satisfied because at step 4, brown_block_1 is on the table before orange_block_1 is stacked on black_block_1 at step 6
4. Constraint: black_block_1 must never be on the table - Satisfied, black_block_1 goes from grey_block_2 to black_block_2 to grey_block_1
5. Constraint: At some point, grey_block_2 must be on top of green_block_1 - Satisfied in the initial state
6. Constraint: If grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1, then sometime after that, grey_block_2 must be on top of black_block_2 - Satisfied after step 16
7. Constraint: grey_block_2 must never be on the table - Satisfied, grey_block_2 goes from green_block_1 to black_block_2
8. Constraint: At some point, grey_block_2 must not be on top of orange_block_1 - Satisfied, grey_block_2 is never on top of orange_block_1
9. Constraint: If grey_block_2 is not on top of orange_block_1, then sometime after that, brown_block_1 must be on top of grey_block_2 - Satisfied after step 8
10. Constraint: At some point, either brown_block_1 is on the table or we are holding grey_block_1 - Satisfied when brown_block_1 is on the table at step 4 and again at step 10

This plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal. Let me provide the final plan:

1. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2
2. stack black_block_1 black_block_2
3. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
4. putdown brown_block_1
5. unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1
6. stack orange_block_1 black_block_1
7. pickup brown_block_1
8. stack brown_block_1 grey_block_2
9. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_2
10. putdown brown_block_1
11. unstack orange_block_1 black_block_1
12. putdown orange_block_1
13. unstack black_block_1 black_block_2
14. stack black_block_1 grey_block_1
15. unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1
16. stack grey_block_2 black_block_2
17. pickup green_block_1

I believe this is the optimal (shortest) valid plan that satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal.
