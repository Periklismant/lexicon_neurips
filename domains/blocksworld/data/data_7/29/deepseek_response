**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1**: Removes blue_block_1 from black_block_1. This makes black_block_1 clear.
2. **putdown blue_block_1**: Places blue_block_1 on the table, keeping it clear for later use.
3. **unstack black_block_1 white_block_1**: Removes black_block_1 from white_block_1, freeing white_block_1.
4. **stack black_block_1 purple_block_1**: Places black_block_1 on purple_block_1, making purple_block_1 not clear (satisfies constraints 6, 7, 9).
5. **pickup white_block_1**: Picks up white_block_1 to move it off the table.
6. **stack white_block_1 purple_block_1**: Places white_block_1 on purple_block_1 (now on top of black_block_1). This ensures white_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 2).
7. **pickup blue_block_2**: Picks up blue_block_2 to stack it on black_block_1.
8. **stack blue_block_2 black_block_1**: Places blue_block_2 on black_block_1 (now on purple_block_1), satisfying part of constraint 1.
9. **pickup grey_block_1**: Picks up grey_block_1 to stack it.
10. **stack grey_block_1 blue_block_1**: Places grey_block_1 on blue_block_1, making blue_block_1 not clear (constraint 1) and satisfying constraint 3 when combined with white_block_1 being clear.
11. **unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1**: Finally, picks up grey_block_1 to achieve the goal.

This plan ensures all constraints are met in intermediate states and achieves the goal optimally.
