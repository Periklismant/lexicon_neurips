Okay, let's try to figure out this planning problem. The goal is to end up holding the grey_block_1. But there are a bunch of constraints I need to satisfy along the way. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the goal, then look at each constraint one by one.

First, the initial state:

- yellow_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_1 on top. Purple is clear.
- white_block_1 is on the table with black_block_1 on top, and blue_block_1 on top of black. So the stack here is white -> black -> blue. Blue is clear.
- grey_block_1 is on the table and clear.
- blue_block_2 is on the table and clear.
- The arm is empty.

The goal is to be holding grey_block_1. So I need to perform a pickup on grey_block_1. But to do that, grey_block_1 must be clear and on the table, which it already is. So the simplest plan would be just "pickup grey_block_1". But wait, the constraints complicate things. So even if the goal is simple, the constraints require certain states to be true during the plan.

Let's list all the constraints:

1. At least one state must have blue_block_2 on top of black_block_1 and blue_block_1 is not clear (has a block on top).
2. At least one state where white_block_1 is not on the table.
3. At least one state where grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1 and white_block_1 is clear.
4. At least one state where either holding blue_block_2 or blue_block_1 is not clear.
5. At least one state where black_block_1 is not on the table.
6. If black_block_1 is not on the table in some state, then in that state or a later one, either holding blue_block_2 or purple_block_1 is not clear.
7. At least one state where either white_block_1 is on blue_block_1 or purple_block_1 is not clear.
8. At least one state where grey_block_1 is not on the table (so it's being held or stacked somewhere).
9. If grey_block_1 is not on the table in a state, there must be a prior state where purple_block_1 has a block on top.

So the plan needs to include actions that make sure all these constraints are met. Let's break them down.

Starting with the goal: the last action should be pickup grey_block_1. But wait, in the initial state, grey is on the table and clear, so I can pick it up immediately. But if I do that, the plan would be just one action, but that doesn't satisfy the constraints. So the constraints require me to perform other actions first.

Let's see constraint 8: grey_block_1 must not be on the table in some state. But if I pick it up, then it's being held, so in that state, it's not on the table. But in the final state, after pickup, the arm is holding it. So the final state satisfies constraint 8. But constraint 9 says that if grey is not on the table (which is true in the final state), there must be a prior state where purple_block_1 is not clear. So I need to make sure that before picking up grey_block_1, there's a state where something is on top of purple_block_1.

But initially, purple is on yellow and is clear. So to make purple not clear, I need to stack something on top of it. Which blocks are available? Maybe blue_block_2, grey_block_1, etc. But the problem is, how to do that while also satisfying other constraints.

Let's think step by step.

First, the constraints that need to be satisfied:

Constraint 5: black_block_1 must not be on the table in some state. Currently, black is on white_block_1. So if we move black_block_1, perhaps stacking it somewhere else. But black is under blue_block_1. So to move black, we need to first unstack blue from black, then unstack black from white.

Wait, initial stack: white_block_1 (table) -> black_block_1 -> blue_block_1. So blue is on black, black is on white. To get black not on the table (constraint 5), which it already isn't. Wait, the initial state has black_block_1 on top of white_block_1, which is on the table. So black is not on the table. Wait, constraint 5 says "black_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in at least one state. But in the initial state, black is not on the table. So maybe that's already satisfied. Wait, but the problem says the original state is as described, and the constraints are on the plan's states. So perhaps the initial state counts as part of the plan's states? Or do the actions create the states? Hmm. The initial state is the starting point, and each action leads to a new state. So the initial state is state 0, then action 1 leads to state 1, etc. So constraint 5 requires that in some state (could be state 0) black is not on the table. Since in state 0, black is on white, not the table, that's already true. So constraint 5 is satisfied by the initial state. Then maybe that's already covered. So that's one constraint down.

But wait, the problem says "the task is to bring about the following situation: you are holding grey_block_1". So the plan's final state must have the arm holding grey_block_1. The constraints are on the states in the plan. So the initial state is included as part of the states. So for constraint 5, the initial state already meets it. So we don't need to do anything for constraint 5. But the sixth constraint says that if in some state black is not on the table (which is always true except if we put it back on the table), then in that state or after, either hold blue_block_2 or purple is not clear. Since in the initial state, black is not on the table, and that's part of the plan's states, we need to check if in the initial state or any subsequent state, either we hold blue_block_2 or purple is not clear. But in the initial state, we are not holding blue_block_2, and purple is clear. So the initial state violates the sixth constraint. Wait, no: the sixth constraint is a conditional. It says: if in some state s, black is not on the table (which is true in state 0), then in s or some state after s, either holding blue_block_2 or purple is not clear. So for the initial state s=0, which satisfies the antecedent (black not on table), we need that either in s=0 or later, blue_block_2 is held or purple is not clear. But in s=0, neither is true. So we need to ensure that in some later state, either we hold blue_block_2 or stack something on purple.

So even though constraint 5 is satisfied by the initial state, the sixth constraint requires that whenever black is not on the table (which is always the case except if we put it on the table), then from that state onward, eventually there's a state where we hold blue_block_2 or purple is not clear. But since black is not on the table in the initial state and remains so unless we move it, which we might not do, the sixth constraint requires that at some point after the initial state, we must have either held blue_block_2 or stacked something on purple.

So that's a key constraint to handle.

Let's look at the other constraints.

Constraint 1: blue_block_2 must be on black_block_1 and blue_block_1 is not clear. So blue_block_2 on black_block_1, and blue_block_1 has something on top. Currently, blue_block_1 is on black_block_1. So if we put something on blue_block_1, that would make it not clear. Also, stacking blue_block_2 on black would require moving blue_block_2 to black. But black is under blue_block_1. So to stack blue_block_2 on black, we need to first remove blue_block_1 from black. So the steps would be: unstack blue_block_1 from black, put it down, then unstack black from white (but wait, black is under blue_block_1, which we just moved. Wait, no: initial state is white has black, which has blue. So to get to black, you have to first unstack blue from black, then unstack black from white. Then you can stack blue_block_2 on black. But then, after that, stack blue_block_1 on top of something else, maybe. But this seems complicated. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_1 to make blue_block_1 not clear. Then stack blue_block_2 on black_block_1. But how?

Wait, blue_block_1 is on black_block_1. To stack something on blue_block_1, we need to have that blue is clear. But in the initial state, blue is clear. So we can stack something on it. For example, if we pick up grey_block_1 and stack it on blue_block_1. That would make blue_block_1 not clear, satisfying part of constraint 1. Then, for the other part, blue_block_2 on black_block_1. But black is under blue_block_1, which now has grey on top. So to stack blue_block_2 on black, we need to first remove blue_block_1 and grey from black. But that might not be necessary if black is still under blue_block_1. Wait, no. If blue_block_1 is on black, then black is under blue_block_1. So to stack blue_block_2 on black, we need to have black clear. But in the initial state, black has blue on top, so it's not clear. So to make black clear, we need to remove blue_block_1 from it. Then stack blue_block_2 on black.

So maybe:

1. unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1. That requires the arm is empty, and blue is clear (which it is). So unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1. Now, the arm is holding blue_block_1. Then, put it down. Then, stack blue_block_2 on black_block_1. But after unstacking blue from black, black becomes clear. So we can stack blue_block_2 on black. Then, stack something else on blue_block_1 to make it not clear.

Wait, but constraint 1 needs both blue_block_2 on black and blue_block_1 not clear. So maybe:

- After moving blue_block_1 off black, stack blue_block_2 on black. Then stack something (like blue_block_1) on top of something else, but also make sure that blue_block_1 is not clear. Alternatively, stack grey on blue_block_1.

But this is getting a bit complicated. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps stack blue_block_2 on black_block_1 after moving blue_block_1. Then stack blue_block_1 on top of something else. But to make blue_block_1 not clear, we need to have something on top of it. But if we just put it down, it's clear. So maybe stack blue_block_1 on another block, then stack something on top. But this could take more steps.

Alternatively, after stacking blue_block_2 on black_block_1, then stack blue_block_1 on top of blue_block_2. Wait, but blue_block_2 is on black. Then blue_block_1 could be stacked on blue_block_2. But then blue_block_1 would be on blue_block_2, which is on black. But this would make blue_block_2 not clear (since blue_block_1 is on it), which is okay. Then, to make blue_block_1 not clear, we need to stack something on it. But that's getting too involved.

Alternatively, maybe stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_1. So steps:

- unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1 (arm holds blue_block_1)
- stack blue_block_1 on grey_block_1 (but grey is on table, so stack blue on grey. Then blue is on grey, and grey is not clear. Then, to make blue_block_1 not clear, something on top. But maybe that's not needed. Wait, the first part of constraint 1 requires blue_block_2 on black_block_1 and blue_block_1 not clear. So if blue_block_1 is on grey, then blue_block_1 is not on anything else. Wait, no. If blue_block_1 is stacked on grey, then blue_block_1 is clear. So that doesn't help. Hmm.

Alternatively, stack something on blue_block_1. Let's say after moving blue_block_1 to the table, then stack blue_block_2 on black (after unstacking blue_block_1). Then stack something else on blue_block_1. For example, if we have blue_block_1 on the table, then stack grey on it. Then blue_block_1 would not be clear. But grey is needed for the goal. So maybe that's possible.

Wait, but the goal is to hold grey_block_1. So if we stack grey on blue_block_1, then we need to unstack it again to pick it up. That adds steps. But maybe necessary.

Let's outline possible steps:

1. unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1. Now holding blue_block_1.
2. putdown blue_block_1. Now blue is on table, clear.
3. pickup blue_block_2. Stack it on black_block_1. Now black has blue_block_2. Now, blue_block_2 is on black, which satisfies part of constraint 1.
4. Then, stack something on blue_block_1 to make it not clear. Let's say stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_1. So:
   a. pickup grey_block_1 (but in step 3, after stacking blue_block_2 on black, the arm is empty. So step 4a: pickup grey_block_1.
   b. stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_1. Now, blue_block_1 is not clear (satisfies the other part of constraint 1). So in this state, constraint 1 is met.

But then, we need to pick up grey_block_1 again for the goal. So after stacking it on blue_block_1, we need to unstack it. So:

5. unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1. Now holding grey_block_1. That achieves the goal. But does this sequence satisfy all constraints?

Let's check other constraints:

Constraint 2: white_block_1 not on the table. Currently, white is under black and blue_block_1. If we unstack blue_block_1 and black_block_1 remains on white, then white is still on the table. To get white not on the table, we need to move it. For example, moving black_block_1 off white would leave white on the table. So unless we stack white on something else, but white is a block that's initially on the table. To get white not on the table, we need to stack it on another block. But white is under black. So to move white, we need to first remove black and blue_block_1. But that's a lot of steps.

Wait, constraint 2 requires that in some state, white is not on the table. So we need to have a state where white is being held or stacked on another block. But in the initial state, white is on the table. So we need to move it. How?

Let's see. If we unstack black_block_1 from white_block_1, then white is clear. Then we can pickup white and stack it somewhere. But to unstack black from white, we need to first remove the blocks above black, which is blue_block_1. So steps:

1. unstack blue_block_1 from black (arm holds blue_block_1)
2. putdown blue_block_1
3. unstack black_block_1 from white (arm holds black)
4. Now, white is clear. We can then pickup white_block_1 and stack it somewhere. For example, stack white on purple_block_1. Then white is not on the table, satisfying constraint 2.

But this would require several steps. Let's see how this integrates with other constraints.

But perhaps we can kill two birds with one stone. For example, stacking white on purple would make purple not clear, which could help with other constraints (like constraint 6 and 7).

Constraint 7 requires that in some state, either white is on blue_block_1 or purple is not clear. If we stack white on purple, that makes purple not clear, which satisfies the second part of constraint 7. So that's good.

Also, constraint 9 says that if grey is not on the table (which it is when we pick it up), there must be a prior state where purple is not clear. So stacking something on purple before picking up grey would satisfy that.

So let's try to integrate these steps.

Let me outline a possible plan:

1. unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1. (Now holding blue_block_1)
2. putdown blue_block_1. (blue_block_1 is on table)
3. unstack black_block_1 from white_block_1. (Now holding black_block_1)
4. stack black_block_1 on purple_block_1. (Now black is on purple, making purple not clear. This satisfies constraint 7's second option (purple not clear) and also helps with constraint 9. Also, since black is now on purple, which is on yellow, black is not on the table. But we already have constraint 5 satisfied in the initial state. But this action also moves black, so perhaps in some other state, but maybe not necessary.)

Wait, but stacking black on purple requires that purple is clear. Initially, purple is clear. So step 4: stack black on purple. Possible.

After step 4, purple is not clear (has black on top). So that satisfies constraint 7 (since purple is not clear). Also, for constraint 9, if later grey is not on the table (when we pick it up), this step 4 is prior, so constraint 9 is satisfied.

Then, step 5: pickup white_block_1 (since it's on the table and clear after step 3). Stack it somewhere. For example, stack white on blue_block_1. That would make white not on the table (satisfies constraint 2), and blue_block_1 is not clear (since white is on it). Also, if we stack white on blue_block_1, then blue_block_1 is not clear. That helps with constraint 1's second part (blue_block_1 not clear). But we also need blue_block_2 on black_block_1 for constraint 1.

Wait, after step 4, black is on purple. So to stack blue_block_2 on black_block_1, we need black to be clear. But after step 4, black is under purple. Wait no, in step 4, we stacked black on purple. So black is now on purple. So black is not clear (unless we remove it). Wait, after step 4, black is on purple. So to stack something on black, we need it to be clear. But since black is on purple, and there's nothing on top of black, it's clear. Wait, no. After step 4, black is on purple. So to stack something on black, it must be clear. Let's see:

After step 4: purple has black on top. Black is clear (since nothing is on top of it). So we can stack blue_block_2 on black. That would make blue_block_2 on black (part of constraint 1), and blue_block_1 is not clear if we stack something on it (like white).

So continuing:

5. pickup blue_block_2 (it's on the table and clear)
6. stack blue_block_2 on black_block_1. Now blue_block_2 is on black, which is on purple. So this satisfies the first part of constraint 1 (blue_block_2 on black). 

Then, to make blue_block_1 not clear, we can stack white on blue_block_1. But white is currently on the table. Wait, after step 3, white is on the table and clear. So step 5: pickup white_block_1.

Wait, after step 4, the arm is holding black_block_1 and stacks it on purple. Then step 5: putdown black_block_1? Wait, no. Let me retrace:

Step 1: unstack blue_block_1 from black (arm holds blue)
Step 2: putdown blue (arm empty)
Step 3: unstack black from white (arm holds black)
Step 4: stack black on purple (arm empty)
Now, step 5: pickup white (which is on table and clear)
Step 6: stack white on blue_block_1 (which is on table and clear)
This makes white not on table (constraint 2) and blue_block_1 not clear (constraint 1's second part). So after step 6, blue_block_1 has white on top, so not clear. And blue_block_2 is on black (step 6 hasn't done that yet). Wait, no. In step 6, blue_block_2 is still on the table. Oh wait, in step 5, after step 4, the arm is empty. So step 5 could be pickup blue_block_2 and stack it on black. Let me re-express:

Alternative steps after step 4:

4. stack black on purple (arm empty)
5. pickup blue_block_2 (arm holds blue_block_2)
6. stack blue_block_2 on black_block_1. Now, blue_block_2 is on black (part of constraint 1)
7. Now, need to make blue_block_1 not clear. So perhaps pickup white_block_1 (which is on table and clear after step 3)
8. stack white_block_1 on blue_block_1 (now blue_block_1 is not clear)
Now, constraint 1 is satisfied in step 6 and 8: blue_block_2 is on black and blue_block_1 has white on top (not clear).

Then, constraint 3 requires grey on blue_block_1 and white clear. Wait, constraint 3 says: grey is on blue_block_1 and white is clear. But after step 8, white is on blue_block_1, so white is not clear. So that's a problem. So maybe need to adjust.

Constraint 3: grey on blue_block_1 and white is clear. So to satisfy this, we need to have a state where grey is on blue_block_1 and white is clear. But if we stack white on blue_block_1, then white is not clear. So perhaps instead of stacking white on blue_block_1, stack grey on blue_block_1. Then, white can remain on the table, but that doesn't satisfy constraint 2. Hmm. This is getting complicated.

Alternatively, after stacking white on blue_block_1 (making white not on table), then later move white again to another place where white is clear. But that would require more steps.

Alternatively, find another way to satisfy constraint 2 and 3.

Let me think again. Constraint 2 requires white not on table in some state. So stacking white anywhere else achieves that. For example, stack white on purple, or on blue_block_2, etc. Then, for constraint 3, we need grey on blue_block_1 and white clear. So white must be clear in that state. So if white is stacked on something else but is clear (i.e., nothing on top of it), then white is clear. For example, stack white on purple, then if nothing is on white, white is clear. So:

Suppose after step 4 (black on purple), then:

5. pickup white (arm holds white)
6. stack white on purple (arm empty). Now, white is on purple, which is on yellow. So white is not on table (constraint 2). Now, white is clear if nothing is on top. So if we leave it there, then in that state, white is clear. Then, later, stack grey on blue_block_1 (which is on the table after step 2). So steps:

7. pickup grey_block_1 (clear and on table)
8. stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_1. Now, grey is on blue_block_1, and blue_block_1 is not clear. Then, to satisfy constraint 3, we need white to be clear. In the state after step 6, white is on purple and clear. So in step 8, after stacking grey on blue_block_1, we have grey on blue_block_1 and white is clear (since it's on purple and nothing on top). So constraint 3 is satisfied here.

But we also need to handle constraint 1: blue_block_2 on black and blue_block_1 not clear. So far, blue_block_2 is still on the table. So need to stack it on black.

So after step 6 (white on purple), step 7: pickup blue_block_2, stack on black (which is on purple). Then:

7. pickup blue_block_2 (arm holds blue_block_2)
8. stack blue_block_2 on black_block_1 (now on purple). Now, blue_block_2 is on black (satisfies part of constraint 1). Then, step 9: stack grey on blue_block_1 (from step 8, blue_block_1 is on table). So:

9. pickup grey_block_1
10. stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_1. Now, blue_block_1 is not clear (satisfies constraint 1's second part). 

Now, in this state, constraint 1 is met (blue_block_2 on black, blue_block_1 has grey on top). Also, constraint 3 is met (grey on blue_block_1 and white is clear, since white is on purple and nothing on top). 

But then, after all this, we need to pick up grey_block_1 to achieve the goal. So steps:

11. unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1 (arm holds grey)
This achieves the goal. But need to check if all constraints are met.

Now, let's check the constraints one by one:

1. blue_block_2 on black and blue_block_1 not clear (step 8 and 10): yes.
2. white not on table (step 6): yes.
3. grey on blue_block_1 and white clear (step 10): yes.
4. At least one state where holding blue_block_2 or blue_block_1 not clear. After step 7, the arm is holding blue_block_2. So yes.
5. black not on table: already satisfied in initial state.
6. If black not on table (which is true), then in that state or after, either hold blue_block_2 or purple not clear. After step 4, black is on purple, so purple is not clear. So from step 4 onward, whenever black is not on table (always), purple is not clear. So this is satisfied.
7. Either white on blue_block_1 or purple not clear. After step 4, purple is not clear. So satisfied in many states.
8. grey not on table: when it's stacked on blue_block_1 (step 10) and when picked up (step 11).
9. If grey not on table (step 10 and 11), there must be a prior state where purple is not clear. Step 4 makes purple not clear (black stacked on it), which is before step 10. So satisfied.

Also, constraint 4: in step 7, holding blue_block_2. So that's covered.

Now, the steps would be:

1. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
2. putdown blue_block_1
3. unstack black_block_1 white_block_1
4. stack black_block_1 purple_block_1
5. pickup white_block_1
6. stack white_block_1 purple_block_1
7. pickup blue_block_2
8. stack blue_block_2 black_block_1
9. pickup grey_block_1
10. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
11. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1

But wait, step 6: stacking white on purple. But purple already has black on top. Can't stack on purple unless it's clear. Wait, after step 4, black is on purple. So purple is not clear. So in step 5, after picking up white, trying to stack it on purple is not possible because purple is not clear. Oh, that's a mistake. So step 6 is invalid because purple is not clear (has black on top). So I can't stack white on purple. I need to stack white on a clear block. So that plan is invalid.

So this is a problem. Let me rethink.

Alternative approach after step 4 (black on purple):

5. pickup white_block_1 (which is on table and clear)
6. Now, to stack white somewhere. Where can I stack it? It needs to be on a clear block. Available clear blocks: blue_block_1 (on table), blue_block_2 (on table), grey_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (has purple on top, not clear), purple_block_1 (has black on top, not clear), black_block_1 (on purple, clear if nothing on top). After step 4, black is on purple and clear. So can stack white on black.

So step 6: stack white_block_1 on black_block_1. Now, white is on black (which is on purple), so white is not on table (constraint 2). Also, black is not clear anymore. Then, blue_block_2 is still on table.

Then, step 7: pickup blue_block_2, stack on black_block_1. But black now has white on top, so it's not clear. So cannot stack blue_block_2 on black. So that's a problem.

Alternative, stack white_block_1 on blue_block_1 (which is on table and clear). Step 6: stack white on blue_block_1. Now, white is not on table (constraint 2), and blue_block_1 is not clear (helps constraint 1). Then, step 7: pickup blue_block_2, stack on black_block_1 (which is on purple and clear). So:

7. pickup blue_block_2
8. stack blue_block_2 on black_block_1 (now, blue_block_2 is on black, constraint 1's first part)
Then, stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_1 (but blue_block_1 has white on top. Wait, no. After step 6, white is on blue_block_1. So to stack grey on blue_block_1, need to unstack white first. Which complicates things.

Alternatively, after step 6, stack grey on white. Then blue_block_1 has white and grey, so blue_block_1 is not clear (white is on it, but grey is on white. Wait, but blue_block_1 is not clear if anything is on top of it. So even if white is on blue_block_1, blue_block_1 is not clear. So constraint 1's second part is satisfied with white on blue_block_1. Then, constraint 3 requires grey on blue_block_1 and white clear. But if grey is on white, then white is not clear. So that's a problem.

Hmm. This is getting quite involved. Let's try to outline a valid sequence that meets all constraints.

Alternative plan:

1. unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1. (arm holds blue_block_1)
2. stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_1. (purple now has blue_block_1, making it not clear. This helps with constraint 7 (purple not clear) and constraint 6. Also, constraint 9 requires that before grey is not on table, purple is not clear. So this step 2 satisfies that.

Now, after step 2, blue_block_1 is on purple. Purple is not clear. Also, black is on white.

3. unstack black_block_1 from white_block_1. (arm holds black)
4. stack black_block_1 on blue_block_2. (Assuming blue_block_2 is clear. Yes, in initial state. So now black is on blue_block_2. This makes black not on table (but that's already covered). Also, white_block_1 is now clear and on table. But we need to have white not on table (constraint 2). So step 5: pickup white_block_1 and stack it somewhere.

5. pickup white_block_1. (arm holds white)
6. stack white_block_1 on grey_block_1. (grey is on table, clear. Now white is on grey, so grey is not clear. white is not on table (constraint 2). 

Now, constraint 1: blue_block_2 on black and blue_block_1 not clear. Currently, blue_block_2 has black on top. So blue_block_2 is under black. So blue_block_2 is on black? No, black is on blue_block_2. So that's the opposite. So this doesn't satisfy constraint 1. Also, blue_block_1 is on purple, clear? No, because blue_block_1 is on purple and nothing is on top. So blue_block_1 is clear. So that's a problem.

Alternative step 4: stack black_block_1 on blue_block_1 (which is on purple). So after step 2: blue_block_1 on purple. Then step 3: unstack black from white. Step 4: stack black on blue_block_1. Now, blue_block_1 is not clear (has black on top). This helps with constraint 1's second part. Then, to get blue_block_2 on black, need to stack blue_block_2 on black. So:

5. pickup blue_block_2. (arm holds blue_block_2)
6. stack blue_block_2 on black_block_1. Now, blue_block_2 is on black (part of constraint 1). Now, blue_block_1 has black on top, which has blue_block_2 on top. So blue_block_1 is not clear (constraint 1's second part).

Now, constraint 1 is satisfied in step 6.

Then, handle constraint 2: white not on table. Step 3 leaves white on table. So step 7: pickup white_block_1, stack it somewhere. Say, stack on grey_block_1.

7. pickup white_block_1
8. stack white_block_1 on grey_block_1. Now, white is not on table (constraint 2). Grey is not clear.

Now, constraint 3: grey on blue_block_1 and white clear. But grey is on table with white on top. So not satisfied. So we need to have grey on blue_block_1 and white clear. So perhaps:

9. unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1. (arm holds white)
10. stack white_block_1 somewhere else, like on blue_block_2 (which is on black). But blue_block_2 is under black. Wait, no. After step 6, blue_block_2 is on black. So to stack white on blue_block_2, it must be clear. But blue_block_2 is under black. So no. Alternatively, put white on table again. But that would make white on table again, violating constraint 2. So perhaps stack white on purple, but purple has blue_block_1 and black. Hmm.

Alternatively, after step 8 (white on grey), find a way to move grey to blue_block_1. But grey has white on top. So first unstack white, then move grey.

So steps:

9. unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1. (arm holds white)
10. putdown white_block_1. Now, white is on table, which violates constraint 2. Not good.

Hmm. This is tricky. Let's try a different approach.

Let me recap the constraints to see which ones are not yet covered and need to be addressed.

Constraints:

1. blue_block_2 on black and blue_block_1 not clear.
2. white not on table.
3. grey on blue_block_1 and white clear.
4. hold blue_block_2 or blue_block_1 not clear in some state.
5. black not on table (already covered).
6. if black not on table (which is true), then in that state or after, hold blue_block_2 or purple not clear. Purple not clear is achieved in step 2 (blue_block_1 on purple). So this is satisfied.
7. white on blue_block_1 or purple not clear. Purple is not clear in step 2 onwards, so satisfied.
8. grey not on table. Achieved when grey is stacked or held.
9. if grey not on table, there's a prior state where purple not clear. Purple is not clear from step 2 onwards, so as long as grey is not on table after that, it's okay.

So the main remaining constraints are 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Let's focus on constraint 3: grey on blue_block_1 and white clear. So need to have a state where grey is on blue_block_1 and white is clear (nothing on top of white). White is initially on the table. To make white clear, it must be on the table with nothing on top, or on another block with nothing on top. But if we move white to be on another block and keep it clear, that's possible.

For example, stack white on blue_block_2. If blue_block_2 is on the table and clear, then stacking white on it would make white clear (as long as nothing is stacked on white). Then, later move grey to blue_block_1.

So let's try:

1. unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1. (arm holds blue)
2. stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_1. (purple not clear)
3. unstack black_block_1 from white_block_1. (arm holds black)
4. stack black_block_1 on blue_block_2. (now, black is on blue_block_2. So blue_block_2 is under black, not on top. So this doesn't help with constraint 1.

Alternatively, stack black on blue_block_1 (which is on purple):

4. stack black_block_1 on blue_block_1. Now, blue_block_1 has black on top (not clear).
5. pickup blue_block_2. (arm holds blue_block_2)
6. stack blue_block_2 on black_block_1. Now, blue_block_2 is on black (satisfies constraint 1's first part). blue_block_1 has black and blue_block_2, so not clear (satisfies second part).

Now, white_block_1 is on the table and clear. We need to get white not on table (constraint 2). So step 7:

7. pickup white_block_1. (arm holds white)
8. stack white_block_1 on grey_block_1. (white is not on table, grey has white on top). Now, white is not on table (constraint 2). But white is not clear (has nothing on top). Wait, no. If white is stacked on grey, then grey is not clear, but white is clear. So white is clear. So in this state, white is clear. Now, to satisfy constraint 3: grey on blue_block_1 and white clear. But grey is on the table with white on top. So grey is not on blue_block_1. So need to move grey to blue_block_1.

9. unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1. (arm holds white)
10. stack white_block_1 on blue_block_2. (which is on black). But blue_block_2 is under black, so can't stack on it. Alternatively, stack white on table, but that would violate constraint 2. Hmm.

Alternatively, after step 8, grey is under white. Then, we need to move grey to blue_block_1. But grey has white on top. So first, unstack white from grey.

9. unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1. (arm holds white)
10. putdown white_block_1. Now, white is on table again (violates constraint 2). So this is not good.

Alternative approach for white:

After step 6 (blue_block_2 on black), step 7: pickup white_block_1 and stack it on blue_block_1 (which has black and blue_block_2). But blue_block_1 is on purple. So stacking white on blue_block_1 would require blue_block_1 to be clear, which it's not. So can't do that.

Alternatively, stack white on purple. But purple has blue_block_1 and black. So it's not clear.

Alternatively, stack white on yellow_block_1, which has purple on top. So can't stack there.

This is really complicated. Let's try to find another way.

Let me think about constraint 3 again. We need grey on blue_block_1 and white clear. So if we can stack grey on blue_block_1 and have white clear (i.e., white is on table and clear, or on a block with nothing on top). But white needs to not be on table (constraint 2). So white must be on a block and clear. So stack white on some block where it's clear. For example, stack white on grey_block_1. Then white is not on table, and white is clear. Then, stack grey on blue_block_1. So:

Steps:

1. unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1.
2. stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_1. (purple not clear)
3. unstack black_block_1 from white_block_1.
4. stack black_block_1 on blue_block_2. (blue_block_2 now has black)
5. pickup white_block_1.
6. stack white_block_1 on grey_block_1. (white not on table, constraint 2. white is clear)
7. pickup grey_block_1. (grey is on table, clear. But to pick up grey, it must be clear and on table, which it is after step 6 (grey is under white). Wait, no. If white is stacked on grey, then grey is not clear. So can't pickup grey. So this step is invalid.

Ah, mistake here. After step 6, white is on grey. So grey is not clear. So can't pick up grey. So this approach doesn't work.

Alternative, stack white on blue_block_2 (which is on the table). So:

5. pickup white_block_1.
6. stack white_block_1 on blue_block_2. (white not on table, constraint 2. white is clear)
7. Then, stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_1 (which is on purple and clear? No, after step 2, blue_block_1 is on purple and has nothing on top. So it's clear. So:

7. pickup grey_block_1.
8. stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_1. Now, constraint 3 is met: grey on blue_block_1 and white is clear (white is on blue_block_2 and clear).

Then, to satisfy constraint 1: blue_block_2 on black and blue_block_1 not clear. Currently, blue_block_2 has white on top. So blue_block_2 is not clear. But constraint 1 requires blue_block_2 to be on black. So need to move blue_block_2 to black.

But blue_block_2 is under white. So first, unstack white from blue_block_2.

9. unstack white_block_1 from blue_block_2. (arm holds white)
10. putdown white_block_1. Now, white is on table again (violates constraint 2). Not good.

Alternatively, after step 6 (white on blue_block_2), we can stack blue_block_2 on black_block_1. But blue_block_2 has white on top, so it's not clear. So can't stack.

This is getting too complicated. Let's try to find a different path that addresses all constraints step by step.

Another approach:

- To satisfy constraint 1: blue_block_2 on black and blue_block_1 not clear.
- To satisfy constraint 3: grey on blue_block_1 and white clear.
- To satisfy constraint 2: white not on table.
- To satisfy constraint 9: before grey is not on table, purple not clear.

Let's try:

1. unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1. (arm holds blue_block_1)
2. stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_1. (purple not clear, helps with constraints 6,7,9)
3. unstack black_block_1 from white_block_1. (arm holds black)
4. stack black_block_1 on blue_block_2. (black on blue_block_2, blue_block_2 not clear)
5. pickup white_block_1. (arm holds white)
6. stack white_block_1 on grey_block_1. (white not on table, constraint 2. grey not clear)
7. unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1. (arm holds white)
8. stack white_block_1 on black_block_1. (black has blue_block_2 and white. But black is on blue_block_2, so stacking white on black makes black not clear. But in step 4, black is on blue_block_2, so after step 8, white is on black which is on blue_block_2. Now, to make blue_block_2 on black, but that's not possible because blue_block_2 is under black.

Hmm, this isn't working. Let's try again.

Alternative steps:

1. unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1. (arm holds blue)
2. stack blue_block_1 on grey_block_1. (grey not on table, satisfies constraint 8. Also, blue_block_1 not clear. But this is temporary.)
3. unstack black_block_1 from white_block_1. (arm holds black)
4. stack black_block_1 on purple_block_1. (purple not clear)
5. pickup blue_block_2. (arm holds blue_block_2)
6. stack blue_block_2 on black_block_1. (blue_block_2 on black, constraint 1 part 1)
7. unstack blue_block_1 from grey_block_1. (arm holds blue_block_1)
8. stack blue_block_1 on blue_block_2. (blue_block_1 now on blue_block_2, making blue_block_1 not clear (has nothing on top, wait no. Stacking blue_block_1 on blue_block_2 makes blue_block_2 not clear. Blue_block_1 is clear. So this doesn't help. But if we stack something else on blue_block_1 later.)

Alternatively, after step 6, blue_block_2 is on black. To make blue_block_1 not clear, stack grey_block_1 on it. But grey is under blue_block_1 from step 2. So need to unstack blue_block_1 first.

This is getting too tangled. Perhaps I need to look for an optimal plan, which is the shortest possible. Let's think about the minimal steps needed to achieve the goal while satisfying all constraints.

The goal is to hold grey_block_1. The shortest plan would be just pickup grey_block_1, but that doesn't satisfy the constraints. So we need to interleave actions that meet the constraints.

Let's consider the constraints that require certain states:

- Constraint 1: blue_block_2 on black and blue_block_1 not clear.
- Constraint 2: white not on table.
- Constraint 3: grey on blue_block_1 and white clear.
- Constraint 4: hold blue_block_2 or blue_block_1 not clear.
- Constraint 6: whenever black is not on table (which it is), then eventually hold blue_block_2 or purple not clear.
- Constraint 7: white on blue_block_1 or purple not clear.
- Constraint 8: grey not on table.
- Constraint 9: if grey not on table, prior state with purple not clear.

Let's try to satisfy as many constraints as possible with a few actions.

First, to satisfy constraint 9: before grey is not on table, we need purple not clear. So, we can stack something on purple_block_1 first. For example, stack black_block_1 on purple.

But black is currently under blue_block_1. So steps:

1. unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1. (arm holds blue_block_1)
2. stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_1. (purple not clear)
3. Now, purple is not clear. Then, we can move grey_block_1.

4. pickup grey_block_1. (grey is on table and clear)
But constraint 8 requires grey not on table in some state, which is satisfied here. But constraint 9 requires that before this, purple is not clear. Step 2 ensures that, so okay.

But this plan has only four steps, but does it satisfy all constraints? Let's check:

Constraint 1: Not satisfied. Need blue_block_2 on black and blue_block_1 not clear. But blue_block_1 is on purple, which is clear (no, blue_block_1 is on purple, so purple is not clear, but blue_block_1 is clear if nothing is on top. So blue_block_1 is clear here. So no.

Constraint 2: white is still on table. Not satisfied.

Constraint 3: grey on blue_block_1 and white clear. Not satisfied.

Constraint 4: In step 4, holding grey, not blue_block_2. So need another action where blue_block_2 is held or blue_block_1 not clear. But blue_block_1 is clear here. So no.

So this plan doesn't work.

Another approach: Stack blue_block_2 on black_block_1 and stack something on blue_block_1.

Steps:

1. unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1. (arm holds blue_block_1)
2. putdown blue_block_1. (on table)
3. pickup blue_block_2. (arm holds blue_block_2)
4. stack blue_block_2 on black_block_1. (black is under blue_block_1 initially, but after step 1, black is clear. So stacking blue_block_2 on black. Now, constraint 1's first part is satisfied.
5. Now, need to make blue_block_1 not clear. So stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_1.
   a. pickup grey_block_1.
   b. stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_1. Now, blue_block_1 not clear (constraint 1's second part).
6. Now, pickup grey_block_1 again (to achieve the goal).

But check other constraints:

Constraint 2: white still on table. Not satisfied.

Constraint 3: grey on blue_block_1 and white clear. If white is still on table and clear, then yes. But constraint 2 requires white not on table. So this plan doesn't satisfy constraint 2.

So need to move white.

After step 5, steps:

6. unstack black_block_1 from white_block_1. (arm holds black)
7. stack black_block_1 somewhere, like on purple_block_1. (purple not clear)
8. pickup white_block_1. (arm holds white)
9. stack white_block_1 on grey_block_1. (white not on table, constraint 2. Grey not clear.)
10. unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1. (arm holds white)
11. stack white_block_1 on purple_block_1. (purple has black and white. White is not clear, but this doesn't help constraint 3.)

This is getting too long. Perhaps a better approach is to accept that this plan will have several steps and methodically check each constraint.

After several attempts, I think the following plan might work:

1. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
2. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1
3. unstack black_block_1 white_block_1
4. stack black_block_1 blue_block_2
5. pickup white_block_1
6. stack white_block_1 grey_block_1
7. pickup blue_block_2
8. stack blue_block_2 black_block_1
9. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1
10. stack white_block_1 blue_block_1
11. pickup grey_block_1
12. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
13. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1

But checking each step for validity and constraints:

Step 1: unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1. Valid, as blue is clear and arm is empty.
Step 2: stack blue_block_1 on purple. Valid, since purple is clear (initial state), arm is holding blue_block_1.
Step 3: unstack black_block_1 from white_block_1. Valid, as black is clear after step 1.
Step 4: stack black_block_1 on blue_block_2. Valid, blue_block_2 is clear.
Step 5: pickup white_block_1. Valid, white is on table and clear.
Step 6: stack white_block_1 on grey_block_1. Valid, grey is clear.
Step 7: pickup blue_block_2. Valid, blue_block_2 is under black_block_1 (stacked in step 4). Wait, no. After step 4, black is on blue_block_2. So blue_block_2 is not clear. So can't pickup blue_block_2. Step 7 is invalid.

Ah, this is a mistake. So after step 4, black is on blue_block_2, making blue_block_2 not clear. So step 7 is invalid. So this plan is incorrect.

Back to the drawing board. Let's try to create a valid sequence:

1. unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1. (arm holds blue_block_1)
2. stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_1. (purple not clear)
3. unstack black_block_1 from white_block_1. (arm holds black)
4. stack black_block_1 on blue_block_2. (blue_block_2 now has black)
5. pickup white_block_1. (arm holds white)
6. stack white_block_1 on grey_block_1. (white not on table)
7. unstack blue_block_2 from black_block_1. (but blue_block_2 is under black. Can't unstack. Invalid.)

Hmm. This approach isn't working.

Alternative plan:

1. unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1.
2. stack blue_block_1 on grey_block_1. (grey not on table)
3. unstack black_block_1 from white_block_1.
4. stack black_block_1 on purple_block_1. (purple not clear)
5. pickup blue_block_2.
6. stack blue_block_2 on black_block_1. (blue_block_2 on black)
7. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_1. (black has blue_block_2. Can't unstack white from black. Wait, white is on table. After step 3, white is clear on table. So step 5: pickup white_block_1.
8. stack white_block_1 on blue_block_1. (blue_block_1 is on grey. So stack white on blue_block_1. Now, blue_block_1 is not clear. White is not on table.

Now, check constraints:

1. blue_block_2 on black (step 6), blue_block_1 not clear (step 8) → constraint 1 satisfied.
2. white not on table (step 8) → constraint 2 satisfied.
3. grey on blue_block_1 and white clear. But grey is under blue_block_1 (step 2). So grey is on blue_block_1? No, blue_block_1 is on grey. So step 2: blue_block_1 is on grey. So grey is under blue_block_1. To have grey on blue_block_1, we need to stack grey on blue_block_1. So steps missing.

This approach isn't working either.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, perhaps the optimal plan is as follows, even if it's longer:

```
Action 1: unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
Action 2: putdown blue_block_1
Action 3: unstack black_block_1 white_block_1
Action 4: stack black_block_1 purple_block_1
Action 5: pickup white_block_1
Action 6: stack white_block_1 purple_block_1
Action 7: pickup blue_block_2
Action 8: stack blue_block_2 black_block_1
Action 9: pickup grey_block_1
Action 10: stack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
Action 11: unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
```

But step 6 is invalid because after step 4, purple has black on top, so not clear. So can't stack white on purple. So this is invalid.

After step 4, black is on purple. So step 5: pickup white_block_1 (valid, white is on table and clear). Step 6: stack white_block_1 on black_block_1 (black is on purple and clear). Valid. So step 6: stack white on black.

Now, white is not on table (constraint 2). Black has white on top. Then, step 7: pickup blue_block_2 (valid), stack on black (step 8: stack blue_block_2 on black. Now, black has white and blue_block_2. But to stack on black, it must be clear. But after step 6, black has white on top, so not clear. So step 8 is invalid.

This is extremely challenging. Given the time I've spent and the complexity of the constraints, I think I need to conclude with a possible valid plan, even if it's lengthy, that meets all constraints.
