Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to have the robotic arm holding the yellow_block_1. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's list all the constraints to make sure I don't miss any. The constraints are:

1. At least once, yellow_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2.
2. If the above is true in a state, then white_block_2 must not be on the table in that state or a later one.
3. At least once, holding blue_block_1.
4. At least once, yellow_block_1 has a block on top (not clear).
5. When yellow_block_1 is not clear, there must have been an earlier state where either grey_block_1 is on blue_block_2 or holding blue_block_2.
6. At least once, holding blue_block_2.
7. At least once, white_block_2 isn't on the table and brown_block_1 has a block on top.
8. At least once, yellow_block_1 isn't on the table.
9. If yellow_block_1 isn't on the table, then either blue_block_2 isn't on the table or we're holding white_block_2 in that state or later.
10. At least once, grey_block_1 isn't on the table.
11. If grey_block_1 isn't on the table, then it must be on brown_block_1 in that state or later.

So, the main goal is to have yellow_block_1 in hand. Let's start by figuring out how to pick it up. But we have to satisfy all these constraints along the way.

First, looking at the initial state. Yellow_block_1 is on the table and clear. So we could just do "pickup yellow_block_1" to achieve the goal. But we need to check constraints. However, this simple plan would fail because:

- Constraint 4: Need a state where yellow_block_1 is not clear (has a block on top). If we just pick it up, it's no longer on the table, but maybe that's covered by another constraint. Wait, constraint 8 says yellow_block_1 must not be on the table in at least one state. If we pick it up, then in that state, it's not on the table, satisfying constraint 8. But we also need to make sure that after that, constraint 9 holds: if yellow isn't on table, then blue_block_2 isn't on table or we're holding white_block_2. So if we pick up yellow and put it down somewhere else, but in the process, we have to satisfy that.

But let's start with the simplest approach. Let's see what the constraints require. Let's list each constraint and plan steps to satisfy them.

Constraint 3: Must hold blue_block_1. So we need to pick it up. But in the initial state, blue_block_1 is under grey_block_1, which is under white_block_1. So blue_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top. To pick up blue_block_1, we need to clear it. That means unstacking grey_block_1 and white_block_1 first. Wait, but blue_block_1 is on the table with grey_block_1 on top, then white_block_1 on grey. So to get to blue_block_1, we need to unstack white_block_1 from grey, then unstack grey from blue_block_1, then pickup blue_block_1. But maybe that's necessary for constraint 3.

But maybe there's a smarter way. Alternatively, maybe during the process of handling other blocks, we can pick up blue_block_1. Let's think.

Constraint 6: Must hold blue_block_2. Since blue_block_2 is on the table and clear, we can just pick it up. So perhaps that's a quick action. Then put it down again if needed.

Constraint 7: white_block_2 not on table and brown_block_1 not clear. So we need to put something on brown_block_1, and move white_block_2 somewhere. For example, stack white_block_2 on another block. Then stack some block on brown_block_1.

Constraint 10 and 11: grey_block_1 must be not on the table (so it's on some block) at some point, and then later it must be on brown_block_1. So we need to move grey_block_1 from blue_block_1 to brown_block_1.

Constraint 5: When yellow_block_1 is not clear (has a block on top), there must have been a prior state where grey_block_1 is on blue_block_2 or holding blue_block_2.

So to satisfy constraint 4 and 5: Suppose we place a block on top of yellow_block_1. Let's say we stack some block on yellow. But before that, we need to have either grey_block_1 on blue_block_2 or hold blue_block_2. So maybe stack blue_block_2 under something else first, or have grey_block_1 on blue_block_2.

Also, constraint 1 and 2: yellow not on blue_block_2 at least once, and if so, then white_block_2 must not be on table at that state or later.

So maybe we need to have yellow_block_1 on a different block, say brown_block_1, then move it. But the main goal is to hold it. Wait, the final goal is to be holding yellow_block_1. So perhaps after stacking and unstacking, we end up holding it.

Let's try to outline a possible plan, considering all constraints.

First, we need to hold blue_block_1 (constraint 3). To do that, we have to unstack the blocks on top. The current stack is blue_block_1 (table) -> grey_block_1 -> white_block_1. So:

1. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1: Now holding white_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear.
2. putdown white_block_1: Now white_block_1 is on the table.
3. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1: Now holding grey_block_1, blue_block_1 is clear.
4. putdown grey_block_1: Now grey_block_1 is on the table. But constraint 10 requires that grey_block_1 is not on the table at some point. Wait, but we just put it on the table. Hmm. But constraint 10 says that in at least one state, grey_block_1 is not on the table. So maybe we need to move it later. Also, constraint 11 says if grey is not on table (which would be true if we put it on another block), then it must be on brown_block_1 in that state or later. So perhaps we need to stack grey_block_1 on brown_block_1 at some point.

But let's continue. Now, blue_block_1 is clear. So we can:

5. pickup blue_block_1: Now holding it (satisfies constraint 3). Then put it down again if needed.

But perhaps we need to hold blue_block_2 as well (constraint 6). Let's handle that.

6. putdown blue_block_1: Now it's on the table again. Then:

7. pickup blue_block_2: Now holding blue_block_2 (satisfies constraint 6). Then put it down or stack it.

Now, constraint 5: When yellow is not clear (has a block on top), there must be a prior state where grey is on blue_block_2 or holding blue_block_2. So if we stack something on yellow_block_1, say after holding blue_block_2, that would satisfy the condition.

But let's think about stacking on yellow_block_1. Let's say we want to place a block on yellow, making it not clear (constraint 4). To do that, we need to have a block to stack. Let's take white_block_2, which is on the table. So:

8. stack white_block_2 yellow_block_1: But to do this, we need to pick up white_block_2 first.

Wait, steps:

After step 7 (holding blue_block_2), maybe stack blue_block_2 on some block. Or perhaps put it down and handle other blocks.

Alternatively, after holding blue_block_2 (step 7), we can put it down:

7. putdown blue_block_2: back to table. Now, to stack on yellow_block_1, we need another block. Let's say we pick up white_block_2:

8. pickup white_block_2: Now holding it.

9. stack white_block_2 yellow_block_1: Now, yellow is not clear (satisfies constraint 4). Before this, in step 7, we held blue_block_2, which satisfies the condition for constraint 5 (since prior to stacking on yellow, we held blue_block_2). So that satisfies constraint 5.

Also, constraint 2: when yellow is not on blue_block_2 (which is true here, since yellow is under white_block_2, which is on yellow), but we need to ensure that white_block_2 is not on the table. Since we stacked it on yellow, white_block_2 is not on the table anymore, which satisfies the requirement for constraint 2.

So steps up to here:

1. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1
2. putdown white_block_1
3. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
4. putdown grey_block_1
5. pickup blue_block_1 (constraint 3)
6. putdown blue_block_1
7. pickup blue_block_2 (constraint 6)
8. putdown blue_block_2
9. pickup white_block_2
10. stack white_block_2 yellow_block_1 (constraint 4 and 2)

But now, the goal is to hold yellow_block_1. But yellow is under white_block_2. So we need to unstack white_block_2 from yellow_block_1 to pick up yellow.

11. unstack white_block_2 yellow_block_1 (now holding white_block_2)
12. putdown white_block_2
13. pickup yellow_block_1 (goal achieved)

But this seems like a lot of steps, but let's check if all constraints are met.

Constraints:

3: Yes, step 5.

6: Step 7.

4: Step 10 (yellow has white_block_2 on top).

5: Prior step 7 (holding blue_block_2) is before step 10.

2: When yellow is not on blue_block_2 (which is always true here, since yellow is on table, then has white_block_2 on it), then white_block_2 is not on table (after step 10, white is on yellow).

7: Need white_block_2 not on table (done in step 10) and brown_block_1 has a block on top. Currently, brown_block_1 is clear. So we need to stack something on brown_block_1. Also, grey_block_1 is on the table (from step 4), which violates constraint 10 (grey must be not on table at least once). So we need to move grey_block_1 onto brown_block_1 to satisfy constraint 10 and 11.

So let's add steps after step 4:

After step 4 (grey_block_1 is on table):

Wait, step 4 is putdown grey_block_1. So grey is on table. But constraint 10 requires that in at least one state, grey is not on table. So we need to pick it up again and put it on brown_block_1.

So inserting steps:

After step 4:

5. pickup grey_block_1 (since it's on table and clear)

But wait, at step 4, after unstacking grey from blue_block_1, we put it down. Then step 5 is pickup blue_block_1. Wait, no:

Original steps up to step 4:

1. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold white
2. putdown white → white on table
3. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1 → hold grey, blue_block_1 clear
4. putdown grey → grey on table

At this point, grey is on table. To satisfy constraint 10 (grey not on table at least once), we need to move it. So after step 4, perhaps:

5. pickup grey_block_1 (needs to be clear, which it is)
6. stack grey_block_1 brown_block_1 → grey on brown, satisfying constraint 10 (grey not on table) and constraint 11 (since after moving grey off table, it's on brown_block_1).

Then proceed to handle blue_block_1.

So revised steps:

1. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1
2. putdown white_block_1
3. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
4. putdown grey_block_1
5. pickup grey_block_1 (now holding grey)
6. stack grey_block_1 brown_block_1 (now grey is on brown, satisfying constraints 10 and 11)
7. pickup blue_block_1 (now holding blue_block_1, satisfies constraint 3)
8. putdown blue_block_1
9. pickup blue_block_2 (constraint 6)
10. putdown blue_block_2
11. pickup white_block_2
12. stack white_block_2 yellow_block_1 (constraint 4 and 2)
13. unstack white_block_2 yellow_block_1 (hold white)
14. putdown white_block_2
15. pickup yellow_block_1 (goal)

But now, constraint 7 requires that in some state, white_block_2 is not on the table and brown_block_1 is not clear. Let's check:

After step 6, grey is on brown_block_1 → brown is not clear. And in step 12, white_block_2 is stacked on yellow, so not on table. So in the state after step 12, both conditions of constraint 7 are met (white not on table, brown has grey on top). So constraint 7 is satisfied.

Constraint 8: yellow_block_1 not on table. After step 12, yellow is under white_block_2, so it's on table? Wait, no. If yellow was on the table, and white is stacked on it, then yellow is still on the table. Wait, stacking a block on yellow doesn't move yellow. So yellow remains on the table. So in step 12, yellow is on table with white on top. Then in step 13, we unstack white, so yellow is clear again. Then in step 15, we pick up yellow, which is on table. Wait, no: when you unstack white from yellow, you put white down (step 14), then pick up yellow. But to pick up yellow, it needs to be clear and on table. So after step 14, yellow is on table and clear, so step 15 is possible.

But constraint 8 says yellow must be not on table at least once. So when does that happen? If we stack yellow on another block. But our plan currently has yellow only on the table. So we need to move yellow off the table.

So to satisfy constraint 8, we need to have yellow not on the table. Which would require stacking it somewhere. For example, stack yellow on blue_block_2. But then we need to unstack it later to hold it.

Wait, the goal is to end up holding yellow_block_1. So perhaps:

After step 12 (white on yellow), we need to move yellow. But how? To move yellow, since it's under white, we can't. So maybe we need to first move white off yellow, then move yellow elsewhere.

But this complicates things. Let's adjust the plan to include moving yellow off the table.

Alternative approach: After step 12 (white on yellow), we can't move yellow because it's under white. So we need to unstack white (step 13), then move yellow.

But then:

13. unstack white_block_2 yellow_block_1 (hold white)
14. putdown white_block_2
15. pickup yellow_block_1 (now holding yellow, but it's picked up from the table. So yellow is no longer on table. So in step 15, after pickup, yellow is not on table. That satisfies constraint 8. Then, we can keep holding it, which is the goal.

But after step 15, yellow is in hand, not on table. So constraint 8 is satisfied in step 15.

Then, constraint 9: if yellow is not on table (step 15), then either blue_block_2 is not on table or we're holding white_block_2. At step 15, blue_block_2 is on table (from step 10), and we're holding yellow, not white_block_2. So that violates constraint 9. Because in state 15, yellow isn't on table, but blue_block_2 is on table and we aren't holding white_block_2.

So this is a problem. So we need to ensure that when yellow is not on table (step 15), either blue_block_2 is not on table or we're holding white_block_2.

So we need to either move blue_block_2 off the table before step 15 or be holding white_block_2 at step 15.

How can we achieve that?

Option 1: Move blue_block_2 off the table. For example, stack it somewhere.

Let's see. After step 10, blue_block_2 is on the table. We can stack it on another block. For instance, after step 10, we have:

10. putdown blue_block_2 (on table)

Then, we could pick it up again and stack it.

So inserting steps:

11. pickup blue_block_2
12. stack blue_block_2 white_block_1 (assuming white_block_1 is on table)

But white_block_1 is on table after step 2.

So after step 10:

11. pickup blue_block_2 (again)
12. stack blue_block_2 white_block_1 → now blue_block_2 is on white_block_1.

Then proceed to step 13: pickup white_block_2, stack on yellow, etc.

But then, when we reach step 15 (holding yellow), blue_block_2 is on white_block_1, so not on table. So constraint 9 is satisfied (blue_block_2 is not on table). So that works.

So revised steps:

1. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1
2. putdown white_block_1
3. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
4. putdown grey_block_1
5. pickup grey_block_1
6. stack grey_block_1 brown_block_1
7. pickup blue_block_1 (constraint 3)
8. putdown blue_block_1
9. pickup blue_block_2 (constraint 6)
10. stack blue_block_2 white_block_1 (now blue_block_2 is not on table)
11. pickup white_block_2
12. stack white_block_2 yellow_block_1 (constraint 4 and 2)
13. unstack white_block_2 yellow_block_1
14. putdown white_block_2
15. pickup yellow_block_1 (goal, constraint 8 satisfied)

Now, in step 15, yellow is not on table. Blue_block_2 is on white_block_1, not on table. So constraint 9 is satisfied (blue_block_2 not on table). So that's okay.

Also, constraint 7: white_block_2 is not on table (in step 12-13, it's on yellow; after step 14, it's on table again. So in step 12, white_block_2 is not on table, and brown_block_1 has grey on top. So constraint 7 is satisfied in step 12.

Now, let's check all constraints:

1. yellow not on blue_block_2: yes, in all steps, yellow is on table, then stacked, then picked up. Never on blue_block_2. So constraint 1 is satisfied.

2. In any state where yellow is not on blue_block_2 (which is always), white_block_2 must not be on table at that state or later. For example, after step 12, white is on yellow (not on table). Then after step 14, it's back on table. So the constraint requires that if in a state s where yellow is not on blue_block_2 (which is all states), then in s or later, white_block_2 is not on table. But in the final state, white_block_2 is on table (step 14), but in some earlier states (steps 12-13), white was not on table. So does that satisfy the constraint? The constraint says that if in some state s, yellow is not on blue_block_2, then in s or after, white_block_2 must not be on table. However, in the final state, s is the state after step 15, yellow is not on blue_block_2 (true), and white_block_2 is on table. So this would violate the constraint. Because the state after step 15: yellow is not on blue_block_2, and white_block_2 is on table, but there's no state after that where white_block_2 is not on table. So this is a problem.

Hmm. So constraint 2 says that if in state s, yellow is not on blue_block_2, then in s or some state after, white_block_2 is not on table. But in the final state, yellow is not on blue_block_2, and white is on table, so we need to ensure that in s (final state) or after, white is not on table. But there are no actions after step 15. So this would fail.

So the problem arises because in the final state, we have white_block_2 on table, and yellow is not on blue_block_2. But according to constraint 2, whenever yellow is not on blue_block_2, white must not be on table in that state or later. But in the final state, white is on table, and there's no later state. So this violates the constraint.

So we need to ensure that after any state where yellow is not on blue_block_2, white_block_2 is not on table in that state or a later one. Since the final state has yellow not on blue_block_2, we need white_block_2 not on table in the final state or a state after. But since the final state is the last action (holding yellow), we can't have any actions after. So white_block_2 must not be on table in the final state.

But in the current plan, after step 14, white is put down on table, then step 15 picks up yellow. So white is on table in the final state. So this violates constraint 2.

So how to fix this? We need to ensure that in the final state, white_block_2 is not on table. So we can't put it down. Alternatively, we can stack it somewhere else before the final pickup.

Let's adjust steps 13-15:

After step 12 (stack white on yellow), we need to unstack white from yellow and put it somewhere else where it's not on table.

For example:

13. unstack white_block_2 yellow_block_1 (hold white)
14. stack white_block_2 blue_block_2 (assuming blue_block_2 is on white_block_1, which is on table)
Wait, blue_block_2 was stacked on white_block_1 in step 10. So blue_block_2 is on white_block_1. To stack white_block_2 on blue_block_2, we need to have blue_block_2 clear. But blue_block_2 is under nothing (since it's on white_block_1, which is on table). Wait, no: step 10 was stack blue_block_2 on white_block_1. So white_block_1 is on table, blue_block_2 is on white_block_1. So blue_block_2 is clear. So stacking white_block_2 on blue_block_2 would require:

13. unstack white_block_2 yellow_block_1 (hold white)
14. stack white_block_2 blue_block_2 (now white is on blue_block_2, which is on white_block_1. So white_block_2 is not on table. Then, proceed to pick up yellow.

So revised steps:

1. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1
2. putdown white_block_1
3. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
4. putdown grey_block_1
5. pickup grey_block_1
6. stack grey_block_1 brown_block_1
7. pickup blue_block_1
8. putdown blue_block_1
9. pickup blue_block_2
10. stack blue_block_2 white_block_1
11. pickup white_block_2
12. stack white_block_2 yellow_block_1
13. unstack white_block_2 yellow_block_1
14. stack white_block_2 blue_block_2
15. pickup yellow_block_1

Now, in the final state (step 15), white_block_2 is on blue_block_2 (not on table), satisfying constraint 2. Also, yellow is picked up (goal), and not on table (constraint 8). Blue_block_2 is not on table (it's on white_block_1), so constraint 9 is satisfied (since yellow not on table, and blue_block_2 is not on table).

This should work. Let's check all constraints again:

1. yellow not on blue_block_2: Yes, in all steps. Satisfied.

2. Whenever yellow isn't on blue_block_2, white_block_2 isn't on table in that state or later. In the final state, white is on blue_block_2, so not on table. So yes.

3. Hold blue_block_1: step 7. Yes.

4. yellow not clear: step 12. Yes.

5. For step 12 (yellow not clear), prior state must have held blue_block_2 or grey on blue_block_2. Step 9-10: held blue_block_2. Yes.

6. Hold blue_block_2: step 9. Yes.

7. white not on table and brown not clear: step 6 (grey on brown) and step 12 (white on yellow). So in step 12, white is not on table and brown has grey. Yes.

8. yellow not on table: step 15. Yes.

9. In step 15 (yellow not on table), blue_block_2 is not on table (it's on white_block_1). So condition met.

10. grey not on table: step 6 (grey on brown). Yes.

11. When grey is not on table (step 6 onwards), it's on brown. Yes.

All constraints satisfied. The plan seems to work.

Now, let's check if it's optimal. Are there fewer steps possible? Let's count the steps:

1. unstack white1 grey1
2. putdown white1
3. unstack grey1 blue1
4. putdown grey1
5. pickup grey1
6. stack grey1 brown1
7. pickup blue1
8. putdown blue1
9. pickup blue2
10. stack blue2 white1
11. pickup white2
12. stack white2 yellow1
13. unstack white2 yellow1
14. stack white2 blue2
15. pickup yellow1

That's 15 steps. Is there a way to shorten this?

For example, after step 3 (unstack grey1 from blue1), instead of putting grey1 down and picking it up again, maybe stack it directly on brown_block_1. That would save two steps (steps 4 and 5).

So steps:

1. unstack white1 grey1
2. putdown white1
3. unstack grey1 blue1 → holding grey1, blue1 clear
4. stack grey1 brown1 → direct, no putdown and pickup.

Then proceed:

5. pickup blue1 → constraint 3
6. putdown blue1
7. pickup blue2 → constraint 6
8. stack blue2 white1
9. pickup white2
10. stack white2 yellow1 → constraint 4 and 2
11. unstack white2 yellow1
12. stack white2 blue2
13. pickup yellow1 → goal

That's 13 steps. Let's see if this works.

Checking the steps:

After step 3, unstack grey1 from blue1 (holding grey1). Then step 4: stack grey1 on brown1. So grey is not on table (satisfies constraint 10). Then step 4 meets constraint 11 (grey is on brown). 

This saves two steps. Then proceed.

So this plan is shorter. Let's verify:

Constraints:

3: step 5 (pickup blue1)
6: step 7 (pickup blue2)
4: step 10 (stack white2 on yellow)
5: prior step 7 (held blue2) before step 10
7: step 10 (white not on table) and step 4 (grey on brown)
8: step 13 (yellow in hand, not on table)
9: step 13, blue2 is on white1 (not on table)
10: step 4 (grey not on table)
11: step 4 (grey on brown)
1: yellow never on blue2
2: after step 10, white2 not on table, and in final state, white2 is on blue2 (not on table)
7: white2 not on table (step 10) and brown has grey (step4)

Yes, all constraints are met.

So this reduces the steps to 13, which is better.

Is there any other optimization? Let's see.

After step 7 (pickup blue2), stack blue2 on white1 (step 8), then pickup white2 (step 9), stack on yellow (step 10), unstack (step11), stack on blue2 (step12), pickup yellow (step13).

Alternatively, after step 10 (stack white2 on yellow), maybe instead of unstacking and stacking again, use another block. But I don't think so. Because we need to pick up yellow, so we have to unstack white2 from yellow.

So the 13-step plan is optimal.

Let me double-check the preconditions for each action:

Step 1: unstack white1 grey1. Preconditions: white1 is on grey1, white1 is clear (yes, initially white1 is clear). Arm empty (yes). So valid.

Step 2: putdown white1. Holding white1. Valid.

Step3: unstack grey1 blue1. grey1 is on blue1 (initially), grey1 is clear (after step1, grey1 is under white1; after step1, white1 is moved, so grey1 is clear). Arm empty (after step2). So valid.

Step4: stack grey1 brown1. Need to hold grey1 (yes, from step3). brown1 must be clear (initially brown1 is clear). Valid.

Step5: pickup blue1. Blue1 is on table, clear (after step3, blue1 is clear). Arm empty (after step4, putdown grey1, then stack grey1, which leaves arm empty. Wait, step4: stack grey1 on brown1. Stack action requires holding grey1. So after step4, arm is empty. So step5: pickup blue1: yes, blue1 is clear and on table. Valid.

Step6: putdown blue1. Holding it. Valid.

Step7: pickup blue2. On table and clear. Valid.

Step8: stack blue2 white1. Need to hold blue2 and white1 is clear. After step2, white1 is on table. After step8, stacking blue2 on white1. white1 is clear (yes). Valid.

Step9: pickup white2. On table and clear. Valid.

Step10: stack white2 yellow1. Need to hold white2 and yellow1 is clear. Yes. Valid.

Step11: unstack white2 yellow1. white2 is on yellow1, clear (yes). Arm empty (after stack, arm is empty). Valid.

Step12: stack white2 blue2. Need to hold white2. After step11, holding white2. blue2 is clear (blue2 is on white1, no block on top). Valid.

Step13: pickup yellow1. On table and clear (after step11, unstacked white2 from yellow1). Arm empty. Valid.

All preconditions are met. So this plan is valid and satisfies all constraints with 13 steps. I think this is optimal.
