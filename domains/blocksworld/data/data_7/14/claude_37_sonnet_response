Let me analyze this planning problem step by step. 

First, I need to understand the initial state:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- white_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- white_block_2 is on the table
- blue_block_2 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1, white_block_2, blue_block_2, yellow_block_1, and brown_block_1 are clear
- I'm not holding any block

The goal state is:
- I am holding yellow_block_1

Now, I'll analyze the constraints to understand what states my plan needs to go through:

1. "yellow_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2" must be true in at least one state.
   - This is trivially satisfied in the initial state, as yellow_block_1 is on the table, not on blue_block_2.

2. If "yellow_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2" holds, then "white_block_2 is not on the table" must hold in that state or a later state.
   - Since the first condition is true in the initial state, I need to ensure that white_block_2 gets off the table at some point.

3. "you are holding blue_block_1" must be true in at least one state.
   - I need to pick up blue_block_1 at some point.

4. "there is a block on top of yellow_block_1" must be true in at least one state.
   - I need to stack some block on yellow_block_1 at some point.

5. If "yellow_block_1 is not clear" holds, then there must be an earlier state where either "grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2" or "you are holding blue_block_2".
   - This means before I stack something on yellow_block_1, I need to either stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2 or hold blue_block_2.

6. "you are holding blue_block_2" must be true in at least one state.
   - I need to pick up blue_block_2 at some point.

7. "white_block_2 is not on the table" AND "brown_block_1 is not clear" must both be true in at least one state.
   - I need to pick up white_block_2 from the table and stack something on brown_block_1.

8. "yellow_block_1 is not on the table" must be true in at least one state.
   - I need to pick up yellow_block_1 at some point (which aligns with the goal).

9. If "yellow_block_1 is not on the table", then "blue_block_2 is not on the table" OR "you are holding white_block_2" must be true in that state or later.
   - When I pick up yellow_block_1, I need to ensure that either blue_block_2 is not on the table or I'm holding white_block_2.

10. "grey_block_1 is not on the table" must be true in at least one state.
    - Grey_block_1 is already not on the table in the initial state (it's on blue_block_1), so this is satisfied.

11. If "grey_block_1 is not on the table", then "grey_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1" must be true in that state or later.
    - Since grey_block_1 is already not on the table in the initial state, I need to ensure that at some point, grey_block_1 gets stacked on brown_block_1.

Now, let me plan a sequence of actions that satisfies all these constraints and leads to the goal.

First, let's consider constraint 5. Before I can stack something on yellow_block_1, I need to either stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2 or hold blue_block_2. Since constraint 6 requires me to hold blue_block_2 anyway, I'll plan to do that.

But to pick up blue_block_2, I need the arm to be empty. Initially, I have a tower with white_block_1 on top of grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_1. I'll need to dismantle this tower first.

Let's start planning:

1. unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1
2. putdown white_block_1
3. unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1

Now, according to constraint 11, if grey_block_1 is not on the table (which it is, after being unstacked), I need to ensure that at some point grey_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1. So, I'll continue:

4. stack grey_block_1 on brown_block_1 (This satisfies constraint 11)

Now, I need to pick up blue_block_1 at some point (constraint 3):

5. pickup blue_block_1
6. putdown blue_block_1 (This satisfies constraint 3)

Now, I need to pick up blue_block_2 (constraint 6):

7. pickup blue_block_2
8. putdown blue_block_2 (This satisfies constraint 6)

According to constraint 5, before I stack something on yellow_block_1, I needed to either stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2 or hold blue_block_2. Since I've held blue_block_2, I can now stack something on yellow_block_1. Let's use white_block_1:

9. pickup white_block_1
10. stack white_block_1 on yellow_block_1 (This satisfies constraint 4)

Now, I need to satisfy constraint 7, which requires white_block_2 to not be on the table and brown_block_1 to have something on top of it. Grey_block_1 is already on brown_block_1, so the first part of constraint 7 is satisfied. For the second part, I need to pick up white_block_2:

11. pickup white_block_2 (This satisfies constraint 2, as yellow_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2 in the initial state, and now white_block_2 is not on the table)

Now, I have white_block_2 in hand and brown_block_1 is not clear (as grey_block_1 is on it). This satisfies constraint 7.

For constraint 9, if yellow_block_1 is not on the table, then either blue_block_2 is not on the table or I'm holding white_block_2. Currently, I'm holding white_block_2, so I can pick up yellow_block_1 (which would satisfy constraint 8).

But there's a problem: I can't pick up yellow_block_1 because it's not clear (it has white_block_1 on it) and I'm currently holding white_block_2. I need to free up my arm first.

Let's continue:

12. putdown white_block_2
13. unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1
14. putdown white_block_1
15. pickup blue_block_2
16. putdown blue_block_2 (Just moving things around to get to a state where I can satisfy all constraints)
17. pickup yellow_block_1 (This satisfies constraints 8 and the goal)

But wait, I need to ensure constraint 9 is satisfied. When I pick up yellow_block_1, I need to ensure that either blue_block_2 is not on the table or I'm holding white_block_2. But I've put blue_block_2 on the table and I'm not holding white_block_2. I need to revise my plan.

Let's try a different approach:

1. unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1
2. putdown white_block_1
3. unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1
4. stack grey_block_1 on brown_block_1 (This satisfies constraint 11)
5. pickup blue_block_1 (This satisfies constraint 3)
6. putdown blue_block_1
7. pickup blue_block_2 (This satisfies constraint 6)
8. stack blue_block_2 on white_block_1 (This ensures blue_block_2 is not on the table, which will help satisfy constraint 9)
9. pickup white_block_2 (This satisfies constraint 2, as yellow_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2 in the initial state, and now white_block_2 is not on the table)

At this point, white_block_2 is not on the table and brown_block_1 is not clear (as grey_block_1 is on it). This satisfies constraint 7.

10. putdown white_block_2
11. pickup yellow_block_1 (This satisfies constraint 8 and the goal)

When I pick up yellow_block_1, blue_block_2 is not on the table (it's on white_block_1), so constraint 9 is satisfied.

Hmm, but I haven't stacked anything on yellow_block_1 yet (constraint 4). Let me revise again.

Let's make a more methodical plan:

1. unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1
2. putdown white_block_1
3. unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1
4. stack grey_block_1 on brown_block_1 (This satisfies constraint 11)
5. pickup blue_block_1 (This satisfies constraint 3)
6. putdown blue_block_1
7. pickup blue_block_2 (This satisfies constraint 6)
8. stack blue_block_2 on white_block_1 (This ensures blue_block_2 is not on the table, which will help satisfy constraint 9)
9. pickup white_block_2 (This satisfies constraint 2, as yellow_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2 in the initial state, and now white_block_2 is not on the table)
10. stack white_block_2 on yellow_block_1 (This satisfies constraint 4)

Now, I've stacked white_block_2 on yellow_block_1, and before doing so, I held blue_block_2, which satisfies constraint 5.

At this point, white_block_2 is not on the table and brown_block_1 is not clear (as grey_block_1 is on it). This satisfies constraint 7.

11. unstack white_block_2 from yellow_block_1
12. putdown white_block_2
13. pickup yellow_block_1 (This satisfies constraint 8 and the goal)

When I pick up yellow_block_1, blue_block_2 is not on the table (it's on white_block_1), so constraint 9 is satisfied.

OK, let's carefully check every constraint to make sure:

1. "yellow_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2" must be true in at least one state.
   - This is satisfied in the initial state and throughout the plan.

2. If "yellow_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2" holds, then "white_block_2 is not on the table" must hold in that state or a later state.
   - This is satisfied after action 9.

3. "you are holding blue_block_1" must be true in at least one state.
   - This is satisfied after action 5.

4. "there is a block on top of yellow_block_1" must be true in at least one state.
   - This is satisfied after action 10.

5. If "yellow_block_1 is not clear" holds, then there must be an earlier state where either "grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2" or "you are holding blue_block_2".
   - Yellow_block_1 is not clear after action 10, and I held blue_block_2 after action 7, which is an earlier state.

6. "you are holding blue_block_2" must be true in at least one state.
   - This is satisfied after action 7.

7. "white_block_2 is not on the table" AND "brown_block_1 is not clear" must both be true in at least one state.
   - This is satisfied after action 9, as white_block_2 is not on the table and brown_block_1 is not clear (grey_block_1 is on it).

8. "yellow_block_1 is not on the table" must be true in at least one state.
   - This is satisfied after action 13.

9. If "yellow_block_1 is not on the table", then "blue_block_2 is not on the table" OR "you are holding white_block_2" must be true in that state or later.
   - Yellow_block_1 is not on the table after action 13, and blue_block_2 is not on the table at that state (it's on white_block_1), so this is satisfied.

10. "grey_block_1 is not on the table" must be true in at least one state.
    - This is satisfied in the initial state and after action 4.

11. If "grey_block_1 is not on the table", then "grey_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1" must be true in that state or later.
    - grey_block_1 is not on the table in the initial state and later gets stacked on brown_block_1 after action 4, so this is satisfied.

All constraints are satisfied, and the goal is achieved after action 13.

So, the final plan is:

1. unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1
2. putdown white_block_1
3. unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1
4. stack grey_block_1 on brown_block_1
5. pickup blue_block_1
6. putdown blue_block_1
7. pickup blue_block_2
8. stack blue_block_2 on white_block_1
9. pickup white_block_2
10. stack white_block_2 on yellow_block_1
11. unstack white_block_2 from yellow_block_1
12. putdown white_block_2
13. pickup yellow_block_1

Let me double-check it one more time, step by step:

Initial state:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- white_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- white_block_2 is on the table
- blue_block_2 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1, white_block_2, blue_block_2, yellow_block_1, and brown_block_1 are clear
- I'm not holding any block

1. unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1
   - Preconditions: white_block_1 is clear, white_block_1 is on grey_block_1, arm is empty.
   - Effects: I'm holding white_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear.

2. putdown white_block_1
   - Preconditions: I'm holding white_block_1.
   - Effects: white_block_1 is on the table, white_block_1 is clear, arm is empty.

3. unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1
   - Preconditions: grey_block_1 is clear, grey_block_1 is on blue_block_1, arm is empty.
   - Effects: I'm holding grey_block_1, blue_block_1 is clear.

4. stack grey_block_1 on brown_block_1
   - Preconditions: I'm holding grey_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear.
   - Effects: grey_block_1 is on brown_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear, brown_block_1 is not clear, arm is empty.

   - Preconditions: blue_block_1 is clear, blue_block_1 is on the table, arm is empty.
   - Effects: I'm holding blue_block_1, blue_block_1 is not on the table.

6. putdown blue_block_1
   - Preconditions: I'm holding blue_block_1.
   - Effects: blue_block_1 is on the table, blue_block_1 is clear, arm is empty.

7. pickup blue_block_2
   - Preconditions: blue_block_2 is clear, blue_block_2 is on the table, arm is empty.
   - Effects: I'm holding blue_block_2, blue_block_2 is not on the table.

8. stack blue_block_2 on white_block_1
   - Preconditions: I'm holding blue_block_2, white_block_1 is clear.
   - Effects: blue_block_2 is on white_block_1, blue_block_2 is clear, white_block_1 is not clear, arm is empty.

9. pickup white_block_2
   - Preconditions: white_block_2 is clear, white_block_2 is on the table, arm is empty.
   - Effects: I'm holding white_block_2, white_block_2 is not on the table.

10. stack white_block_2 on yellow_block_1
    - Preconditions: I'm holding white_block_2, yellow_block_1 is clear.
    - Effects: white_block_2 is on yellow_block_1, white_block_2 is clear, yellow_block_1 is not clear, arm is empty.

11. unstack white_block_2 from yellow_block_1
    - Preconditions: white_block_2 is clear, white_block_2 is on yellow_block_1, arm is empty.
    - Effects: I'm holding white_block_2, yellow_block_1 is clear.

12. putdown white_block_2
    - Preconditions: I'm holding white_block_2.
    - Effects: white_block_2 is on the table, white_block_2 is clear, arm is empty.

13. pickup yellow_block_1
    - Preconditions: yellow_block_1 is clear, yellow_block_1 is on the table, arm is empty.
    - Effects: I'm holding yellow_block_1, yellow_block_1 is not on the table.

Final state:
- I'm holding yellow_block_1 (goal achieved)
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
- white_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_2 is on top of white_block_1
- white_block_2 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is not on the table
- brown_block_1 is on the table

All constraints are satisfied, and the goal is achieved.

Actually, let me revise things a bit further. It's kind of inefficient to move things around without a clear purpose. Let's see if I can refine my plan to be more efficient:

1. unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1
2. putdown white_block_1
3. unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1
4. stack grey_block_1 on brown_block_1 (This satisfies constraint 11)
5. pickup blue_block_1 (This satisfies constraint 3)
6. putdown blue_block_1
7. pickup blue_block_2 (This satisfies constraint 6)
8. stack blue_block_2 on white_block_1 (This ensures blue_block_2 is not on the table, which will help satisfy constraint 9)
9. pickup white_block_2 (This satisfies constraint 2, as yellow_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2 in the initial state, and now white_block_2 is not on the table)

At this point, white_block_2 is not on the table and brown_block_1 is not clear (as grey_block_1 is on it). This satisfies constraint 7.

10. stack white_block_2 on yellow_block_1 (This satisfies constraint 4)

Now, I've stacked white_block_2 on yellow_block_1, and before doing so, I held blue_block_2, which satisfies constraint 5.

11. unstack white_block_2 from yellow_block_1
12. putdown white_block_2
13. pickup yellow_block_1 (This satisfies constraint 8 and the goal)

When I pick up yellow_block_1, blue_block_2 is not on the table (it's on white_block_1), so constraint 9 is satisfied.

To summarize:
1. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1
2. putdown white_block_1
3. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
4. stack grey_block_1 brown_block_1
5. pickup blue_block_1
6. putdown blue_block_1
7. pickup blue_block_2
8. stack blue_block_2 white_block_1
9. pickup white_block_2
10. stack white_block_2 yellow_block_1
11. unstack white_block_2 yellow_block_1
12. putdown white_block_2
13. pickup yellow_block_1
