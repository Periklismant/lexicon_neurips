1. unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1. Now red_block_1 is in the hand and purple_block_1 is clear.
2. stack red_block_1 on grey_block_1. Now red_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 and grey_block_1 is not clear (satisfying part of constraint 4).
3. pickup purple_block_1. Now purple_block_1 is in the hand.
4. stack purple_block_1 on red_block_1. Now purple_block_1 is on top of red_block_1, red_block_1 is not clear (satisfying constraint 2), and grey_block_1 is still not clear.
5. unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2. Now blue_block_2 is in the hand and white_block_2 is clear (completing constraint 4).
6. stack blue_block_2 on purple_block_1. Now blue_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1 and purple_block_1 is not clear.
7. unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1. Now white_block_2 is in the hand and blue_block_1 is clear.
8. putdown white_block_2. Now white_block_2 is on the table (satisfying constraint 1).
9. pickup white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is in the hand (satisfying constraint 8).
10. stack white_block_1 on blue_block_2. Now white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2 and blue_block_2 is not clear (satisfying constraint 6).
11. unstack white_block_1 from blue_block_2. Now white_block_1 is in the hand and blue_block_2 is clear.
12. putdown white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is on the table.
13. unstack blue_block_2 from purple_block_1. Now blue_block_2 is in the hand and purple_block_1 is clear.
14. putdown blue_block_2. Now blue_block_2 is on the table (achieving our goal).
15. unstack purple_block_1 from red_block_1. Now purple_block_1 is in the hand and red_block_1 is clear.
16. unstack red_block_1 from grey_block_1. Now red_block_1 is in the hand and grey_block_1 is clear.
17. putdown red_block_1. Now red_block_1 is on the table.
18. stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1. Now purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 and grey_block_1 is not clear (satisfying constraint 3).
19. pickup grey_block_1. This isn't possible since grey_block_1 has a block on top of it, which is purple_block_1.
