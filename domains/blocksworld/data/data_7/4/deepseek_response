**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1**: This clears purple_block_1 and allows us to move it later.
2. **Putdown red_block_1**: Places red_block_1 on the table, making it available for other actions.
3. **Pickup purple_block_1**: Prepares to stack it on grey_block_1.
4. **Stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1**: Satisfies the constraint requiring purple_block_1 on grey_block_1 when blue_block_1 is not on the table.
5. **Unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2**: Begins moving blue_block_2 toward the table.
6. **Putdown blue_block_2**: Achieves the primary goal of placing blue_block_2 on the table.
7. **Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1**: Clears blue_block_1 for subsequent actions.
8. **Putdown white_block_2**: Ensures white_block_2 is on the table, satisfying a constraint.
9. **Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1**: Prepares to clear white_block_1.
10. **Putdown blue_block_1**: Places blue_block_1 on the table temporarily.
11. **Pickup white_block_1**: Satisfies the constraint requiring holding white_block_1.
12. **Putdown white_block_1**: Completes the action of holding white_block_1.
13. **Unstack purple_block_1 from grey_block_1**: Prepares to move grey_block_1 off the table.
14. **Putdown purple_block_1**: Places purple_block_1 back on the table.
15. **Pickup grey_block_1**: Prepares to stack grey_block_1 elsewhere.
16. **Stack grey_block_1 on red_block_1**: Ensures grey_block_1 is not on the table.
17. **Pickup white_block_2**: Prepares to place it on blue_block_2.
18. **Stack white_block_2 on blue_block_2**: Satisfies the constraint that blue_block_2 is not clear.
19. **Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2**: Returns white_block_2 to the table.
20. **Putdown white_block_2**: Final placement, ensuring all constraints are met.

This sequence ensures all constraints are satisfied while achieving the goal in the minimal number of steps.
