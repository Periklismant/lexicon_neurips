Let me break down this problem:

We have 7 blocks: white_block_1, purple_block_1, blue_block_1, red_block_1, grey_block_1, white_block_2, blue_block_2.

The initial state is:
- white_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
- blue_block_2 is on top of white_block_2
- red_block_1 is clear
- grey_block_1 is clear
- blue_block_2 is clear
- The arm is not holding any block

The goal is simple: blue_block_2 is on the table.

So to achieve this goal, we need to unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2, and then put it down on the table.

But there are a lot of constraints. Let's go through them one by one:

1. red_block_1 must not be on top of white_block_1 at some point, and at that point or after, white_block_2 must be on the table.
   - Currently, red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1, not on white_block_1, so this constraint is already satisfied in the initial state. We just need to make sure white_block_2 is on the table at some point.

2. grey_block_1 must not be on top of white_block_1 at some point, and at that point or after, red_block_1 must not be clear.
   - grey_block_1 is on the table in the initial state, not on white_block_1, so this constraint is already partially satisfied. We need to place something on top of red_block_1 to make it not clear.

3. blue_block_1 must not be on the table at some point, and at that point or after, purple_block_1 must be on top of grey_block_1.
   - blue_block_1 is already not on the table in the initial state (it's on white_block_1), so this constraint is partially satisfied. We need to ensure purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 at some point.

4. white_block_2 must be clear at some point, and before that happens, grey_block_1 must not be clear.
   - white_block_2 is not clear in the initial state (blue_block_2 is on top of it). So we need to remove blue_block_2 from white_block_2 at some point. Before that, we need to place a block on top of grey_block_1.

5. grey_block_1 must not be on the table at some point.
   - grey_block_1 is on the table initially, so we need to pick it up or stack it somewhere.

6. blue_block_2 must not be clear at some point.
   - blue_block_2 is clear initially, so we need to put a block on top of it.

7. If blue_block_2 is not clear, then before that, red_block_1 must not be clear or we are holding white_block_2.
   - We need to make sure that before we stack a block on top of blue_block_2, either red_block_1 is not clear or we are holding white_block_2.

8. white_block_1 must be held at some point.
   - We need to pick up white_block_1 at some point in our plan.

Let's now try to construct a valid plan:

We need to take into account the dependencies between the constraints:
- We need to place a block on top of grey_block_1 before making white_block_2 clear.
- We need to either place a block on top of red_block_1 or be holding white_block_2 before making blue_block_2 not clear.
- We need to place purple_block_1 on top of grey_block_1 at some point.
- We need to hold white_block_1 at some point.

So one possible strategy:
1. Unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1 to free up purple_block_1.
2. Stack red_block_1 on top of grey_block_1, satisfying the requirement that grey_block_1 is not clear before white_block_2 is clear.
3. Unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2, making white_block_2 clear and working towards our goal.
4. Stack blue_block_2 on top of red_block_1, making blue_block_2 not clear and red_block_1 not clear.
5. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1, freeing up blue_block_1.
6. Stack white_block_2 on top of blue_block_2, satisfying the requirement that blue_block_2 is not clear and white_block_2 is on the table.
7. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1, satisfying the requirement that blue_block_1 is not on the table.
8. Stack blue_block_1 on top of white_block_2, satisfying the requirement that white_block_2 is not clear.
9. Pickup purple_block_1 from the table.
10. Stack purple_block_1 on top of grey_block_1, satisfying the requirement that purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1.
11. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_2, freeing up white_block_2.
12. Put blue_block_1 on the table.
13. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2, freeing up blue_block_2.
14. Put white_block_2 on the table, satisfying the requirement that white_block_2 is on the table.
15. Unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2.
16. Put blue_block_2 on the table, achieving our goal.
17. Pickup white_block_1, satisfying the requirement that white_block_1 is held.
18. Put white_block_1 on the table.

Actually, let's refine this. I made an error in my logic above. Let's try a different approach.

First, let's understand our initial state. We have the following blocks stacked:
- white_block_1 (on table) with blue_block_1 on top, which has white_block_2 on top, which has blue_block_2 on top
- purple_block_1 (on table) with red_block_1 on top
- grey_block_1 (on table)

Our goal is to have blue_block_2 on the table.

Let's go through the constraints once more and see how they can be satisfied:

1. "If red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, then white_block_2 is on the table must hold at that or some later state."
   - red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1 in the initial state, not on white_block_1, so we need to ensure white_block_2 is on the table at some point.

2. "If grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, then red_block_1 is not clear must hold at that or some later state."
   - grey_block_1 is on the table in the initial state, not on white_block_1, so we need to place something on top of red_block_1 to make it not clear.

3. "If blue_block_1 is not on the table, then purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 must hold at that or some later state."
   - blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 in the initial state, not on the table, so we need to ensure purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 at some point.

4. "If white_block_2 is clear, then grey_block_1 is not clear must hold at some earlier state."
   - white_block_2 is not clear in the initial state (blue_block_2 is on top of it). If we make white_block_2 clear, we need to ensure that grey_block_1 is not clear at some point before that.

5. "grey_block_1 must not be on the table at some point."
   - grey_block_1 is on the table initially, so we need to pick it up or stack it somewhere.

6. "blue_block_2 must not be clear at some point."
   - blue_block_2 is clear initially, so we need to put a block on top of it.

7. "If blue_block_2 is not clear, then red_block_1 is not clear or you are holding white_block_2 must be true at some earlier state."
   - Before we make blue_block_2 not clear, we must either make red_block_1 not clear or be holding white_block_2.

8. "white_block_1 must be held at some point."
   - We need to pick up white_block_1 at some point in our plan.

Based on these constraints, let's try to come up with a new plan:

1. To satisfy constraint 2, we need to make red_block_1 not clear. We can do this by placing a block on top of it.
2. To satisfy constraint 3, we need to place purple_block_1 on top of grey_block_1.
3. To satisfy constraint 4, we need to make grey_block_1 not clear before making white_block_2 clear.
4. To satisfy constraint 5, we need to move grey_block_1 from the table.
5. To satisfy constraint 6, we need to place a block on top of blue_block_2.
6. To satisfy constraint 7, before making blue_block_2 not clear, we need to either make red_block_1 not clear or be holding white_block_2.
7. To satisfy constraint 8, we need to pick up white_block_1 at some point.

Let's construct a plan:

1. unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2
2. stack blue_block_2 on red_block_1 (making red_block_1 not clear and blue_block_2 not clear, satisfying constraints 2 and 6)
3. unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1
4. stack white_block_2 on blue_block_2 (making white_block_2 on top of blue_block_2, which satisfies constraint 1)
5. unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1
6. stack blue_block_1 on white_block_2 (continue stacking)
7. pickup white_block_1 (satisfying constraint 8)
8. putdown white_block_1 (now we have white_block_1 on the table)
9. pickup grey_block_1 (satisfying constraint 5)
10. putdown grey_block_1
11. unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1 (freeing purple_block_1)
12. stack red_block_1 on grey_block_1 (making grey_block_1 not clear, satisfying constraint 4)
13. pickup purple_block_1
14. stack purple_block_1 on red_block_1 (continuing with our strategy)
15. unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_2 (removing the top block from the tower)
16. putdown blue_block_1
17. unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2 (removing the next block from the tower)
18. putdown white_block_2
19. unstack blue_block_2 from red_block_1 (removing the next block)
20. putdown blue_block_2 (achieving our goal)

Wait, let me double-check the constraints:

1. red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 in the initial state, and we ensure white_block_2 is on the table in step 18.
2. grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 in the initial state, and we ensure red_block_1 is not clear in step 14 (when we stack purple_block_1 on it).
3. blue_block_1 is not on the table in the initial state, and we ensure purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 (indirectly through red_block_1) in step 14.
4. white_block_2 is made clear in step 15, and grey_block_1 is made not clear in step 12, before that.
5. grey_block_1 is picked up in step 9, satisfying the constraint that it must not be on the table at some point.
6. blue_block_2 is made not clear when white_block_2 is stacked on it in step 4.
7. Before blue_block_2 is made not clear in step 4, red_block_1 is not clear in steps 2-3.
8. white_block_1 is held in step 7.

Constraint 3 says "If blue_block_1 is not on the table, then purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 must hold at that or some later state."

In our plan, blue_block_1 is not on the table from the initial state to step 16. So we need to ensure purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 at some point from the initial state to step 16. But in step 14, we stack purple_block_1 on red_block_1, not on grey_block_1 directly. So this constraint is not properly satisfied.

Also, wait, in our plan step 14, if red_block_1 is on grey_block_1, we're stacking purple_block_1 on red_block_1. But the constraint says "If blue_block_1 is not on the table, then purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 must hold at that or some later state." So purple_block_1 needs to be directly on top of grey_block_1.

Let's fix our plan:

1. unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2
2. stack blue_block_2 on red_block_1 (making red_block_1 not clear and blue_block_2 not clear, satisfying constraints 2, 6, and 7)
3. unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1
4. putdown white_block_2 (making white_block_2 on the table, satisfying constraint 1)
5. unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1
6. putdown blue_block_1
7. pickup white_block_1 (satisfying constraint 8)
8. putdown white_block_1
9. unstack blue_block_2 from red_block_1 (freeing red_block_1)
10. putdown blue_block_2 (achieving our goal)
11. unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1 (freeing purple_block_1)
12. stack red_block_1 on grey_block_1 (making grey_block_1 not clear, satisfying constraint 4)
13. pickup purple_block_1
14. stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1 (satisfying constraint 3)
15. pickup red_block_1 (satisfying constraint 5)
16. putdown red_block_1

But then constraint 3 says "If blue_block_1 is not on the table, then purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 must hold at that or some later state." This means that if blue_block_1 is not on the table at some state s, then purple_block_1 must be on top of grey_block_1 at that state s or at a later state. So if blue_block_1 is not on the table for the entire duration of the plan (which is the case in the initial state), purple_block_1 must be on top of grey_block_1 at some point in the plan.

In steps 1-5, blue_block_1 is not on the table (it's on white_block_1), so at some point in the plan (at step 14), purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1. So this constraint is satisfied.

Um actually I think that's a generalization. Let's re-read. It says "If expression 'blue_block_1 is not on the table' holds in some state s, then expression 'purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1' must hold at s or at some state after s"

Actually no, I think I was right. It's good that we stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1 in step 14, because blue_block_1 is not on the table in the initial state. This is like a "if A, then B" statement. A is true in the initial state, so B must be true at some point, and we ensure it is true in step 14.

But wait, in my plan, the goal is achieved in step 10, when blue_block_2 is put on the table. So steps 11-16 are unnecessary, but they are needed to satisfy the constraints. So we should satisfy the constraints first, and then achieve the goal.

Let me re-plan:

Given the initial state:
- white_block_1 (on table) with blue_block_1 on top, which has white_block_2 on top, which has blue_block_2 on top
- purple_block_1 (on table) with red_block_1 on top
- grey_block_1 (on table)

Let's try to satisfy the constraints and then achieve the goal:

1. unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2 (freeing white_block_2)
2. stack blue_block_2 on red_block_1 (making red_block_1 not clear, satisfying constraint 2)
3. unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1 (freeing blue_block_1)
4. putdown white_block_2 (satisfying constraint 1)
5. unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (freeing white_block_1)
6. putdown blue_block_1 (now blue_block_1 is on the table, which is fine because we've already ensured we'll satisfy constraint 3)
7. pickup white_block_1 (satisfying constraint 8)
8. putdown white_block_1
9. unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1 (freeing purple_block_1)
10. pickup purple_block_1
11. pickup grey_block_1 (satisfying constraint 5)
12. putdown grey_block_1
13. stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1 (satisfying constraint 3)
14. stack red_block_1 on purple_block_1 (making grey_block_1 not clear through the stack, satisfying constraint 4)
15. pickup white_block_2
16. stack white_block_2 on blue_block_2 (making blue_block_2 not clear, satisfying constraint 6)
17. unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2 (freeing blue_block_2)
18. putdown white_block_2
19. unstack blue_block_2 from red_block_1 (freeing blue_block_2)
20. putdown blue_block_2 (achieving our goal)

Hmm, there's a problem with step 11-12. I'm trying to pickup grey_block_1, but at this point, I'd be holding purple_block_1. So I need to put purple_block_1 down first, pick up grey_block_1, and then pick up purple_block_1 again.

Also, in step 10, I pickup purple_block_1, but I then pickup grey_block_1 in step 11, which isn't possible since the arm can only hold one block at a time. Let me fix these issues.

And I just realized that I've unnecessarily been holding grey_block_1 at some point in step 11. Constraint 5 says "The following expression must hold in at least one state: grey_block_1 is not on the table". So we need to make sure grey_block_1 is not on the table at some point, which means it's either being held or it's on top of another block.

Here's the fixed plan:

1. unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2 (freeing white_block_2)
2. stack blue_block_2 on red_block_1 (making red_block_1 not clear, satisfying constraint 2)
3. unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1 (freeing blue_block_1)
4. putdown white_block_2 (satisfying constraint 1)
5. unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (freeing white_block_1)
6. putdown blue_block_1 (now blue_block_1 is on the table, which is fine because we've already ensured we'll satisfy constraint 3)
7. pickup white_block_1 (satisfying constraint 8)
8. putdown white_block_1
9. unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1 (freeing purple_block_1)
10. putdown red_block_1
11. pickup purple_block_1
12. stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1 (satisfying constraint 3)
13. pickup red_block_1
14. stack red_block_1 on purple_block_1 (making grey_block_1 not clear through the stack, satisfying constraint 4)
15. pickup grey_block_1 (This would make purple_block_1 and red_block_1 move, which is not possible.)

Hmm, step 15 is problematic. Let's rethink. We need grey_block_1 to not be on the table at some point, which means either it's held by the arm or it's on top of another block. Given the constraints, it seems easier to place grey_block_1 on top of a block rather than to lift the entire stack.

Actually, wait. I think I'm overthinking this. Let's simplify and focus on the constraints.

1. red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 in the initial state, so we just need to ensure white_block_2 is on the table at some point.
2. grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 in the initial state, so we just need to ensure red_block_1 is not clear at some point.
3. blue_block_1 is not on the table in the initial state, so we need to ensure purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 at some point.
4. If we make white_block_2 clear, we need to ensure grey_block_1 is not clear at some point before that.
5. grey_block_1 must not be on the table at some point.
6. blue_block_2 must not be clear at some point.
7. If we make blue_block_2 not clear, we need to ensure that red_block_1 is not clear or we are holding white_block_2 at some point before that.
8. white_block_1 must be held at some point.

Let's construct a simpler plan:

1. unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2 (freeing white_block_2)
2. putdown blue_block_2 (achieving our goal)
3. unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1 (freeing blue_block_1)
4. putdown white_block_2 (satisfying constraint 1)
5. unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (freeing white_block_1)
6. stack blue_block_1 on blue_block_2 (making blue_block_2 not clear, satisfying constraint 6)
7. pickup red_block_1 (freeing red_block_1)
8. putdown red_block_1
9. pickup purple_block_1
10. stack purple_block_1 on red_block_1 (making red_block_1 not clear, satisfying constraint 2)
11. pickup white_block_1 (satisfying constraint 8)
12. stack white_block_1 on purple_block_1 (continuing to build our stack)
13. pickup grey_block_1 (making grey_block_1 not on the table, satisfying constraint 5)
14. stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1 (continuing to build our stack)
15. unstack blue_block_1 from blue_block_2 (making blue_block_2 clear, but that's okay because we're done with constraint 6)
16. stack blue_block_1 on grey_block_1 (making a tower)
17. pickup purple_block_1 (taking apart our previous stack)
18. putdown purple_block_1
19. pickup grey_block_1 (taking apart our previous tower)
20. putdown grey_block_1
21. pickup purple_block_1
22. stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1 (satisfying constraint 3)

Hmm, but in step 17, if I pick up purple_block_1, I'd be also lifting red_block_1 and white_block_1 (and maybe even more blocks on top), which isn't possible. Let me redo this.

I'm overthinking this. Let's simplify. Given the initial state and the goal, here's a straightforward plan that satisfies all the constraints:

1. unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2. Now blue_block_2 is in the hand.
2. putdown blue_block_2. Now blue_block_2 is on the table (this achieves our goal).
3. unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1. Now white_block_2 is in the hand.
4. putdown white_block_2. Now white_block_2 is on the table (satisfying constraint 1).
5. unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1. Now blue_block_1 is in the hand.
6. stack blue_block_1 on blue_block_2. Now blue_block_2 is not clear (satisfying constraint 6) and blue_block_1 is not on the table (which was already satisfied).
7. unstack blue_block_1 from blue_block_2. Now blue_block_1 is in the hand and blue_block_2 is clear again.
8. putdown blue_block_1. Now blue_block_1 is on the table.
9. pickup white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is in the hand (satisfying constraint 8).
10. stack white_block_1 on blue_block_2. Now white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2 and blue_block_2 is not clear (satisfying constraint 6 again).
11. unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1. Now red_block_1 is in the hand and purple_block_1 is clear.
12. stack red_block_1 on white_block_1. Now red_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and white_block_1 is not clear.

Actually, I see a problem. Constraint 7 says "If expression 'there is a block on top of blue_block_2' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which 'red_block_1 is not clear, or we are holding white_block_2' is true."

In step 6, we stack blue_block_1 on blue_block_2, making blue_block_2 not clear. But before that, we need to ensure red_block_1 is not clear or we are holding white_block_2. In our plan, in step 3, we are holding white_block_2, so that satisfies this constraint.

In step 10, we stack white_block_1 on blue_block_2, making blue_block_2 not clear again. Before that, we need to ensure red_block_1 is not clear or we are holding white_block_2. In our plan, step 9 has us holding white_block_1, not white_block_2, so we need to ensure red_block_1 is not clear at some point before step 10. But red_block_1 is clear in the initial state and we don't change that until step 11. So our plan doesn't satisfy constraint 7 for step 10.

So we need to ensure red_block_1 is not clear before step 10. Let's redo our plan:

1. unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1. Now red_block_1 is in the hand and purple_block_1 is clear.
2. stack red_block_1 on grey_block_1. Now red_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 and grey_block_1 is not clear (satisfying constraint 4 for later).
3. pickup purple_block_1. Now purple_block_1 is in the hand.
4. stack purple_block_1 on red_block_1. Now purple_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 and red_block_1 is not clear (satisfying constraint 2 and giving us a state where red_block_1 is not clear, which we need for constraint 7).
5. unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2. Now blue_block_2 is in the hand.
6. stack blue_block_2 on purple_block_1. Now blue_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1 and purple_block_1 is not clear.
7. unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1. Now white_block_2 is in the hand.
8. putdown white_block_2. Now white_block_2 is on the table (satisfying constraint 1).
9. unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1. Now blue_block_1 is in the hand.
10. stack blue_block_1 on white_block_2. Now blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_2 and white_block_2 is not clear.
11. pickup white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is in the hand (satisfying constraint 8).
12. stack white_block_1 on blue_block_1. Now white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1 and blue_block_1 is not clear.
13. unstack blue_block_2 from purple_block_1. Now blue_block_2 is in the hand.
14. stack blue_block_2 on white_block_1. Now blue_block_2 is on top of white_block_1 and white_block_1 is not clear (satisfying constraint 6).
15. pickup grey_block_1. This would require a chain of unstacking first, which isn't allowed.

So there's an issue with step 15 because grey_block_1 has blocks on top of it.

Let's reconsider constraint 3: "If expression 'blue_block_1 is not on the table' holds in some state s, then expression 'purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1' must hold at s or at some state after s."

In the initial state, blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, so it's not on the table. Therefore, at some point in our plan, purple_block_1 must be on top of grey_block_1. But so far, we've been stacking purple_block_1 on red_block_1, not directly on grey_block_1.

And constraint 5 says that grey_block_1 must not be on the table at some point. This means either grey_block_1 is being held by the arm, or grey_block_1 is on top of another block. 

Alright, I think I need to redo my plan with more careful consideration of these constraints:

1. unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2. Now blue_block_2 is in the hand.
2. stack blue_block_2 on grey_block_1. Now blue_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1 and grey_block_1 is not clear (satisfying constraint 4 for later).
3. unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1. Now white_block_2 is in the hand.
4. stack white_block_2 on blue_block_2. Now white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_2, blue_block_2 is not clear (satisfying constraint 6), and white_block_2 is not on the table.
5. unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1. Now blue_block_1 is in the hand.
6. putdown blue_block_1. Now blue_block_1 is on the table.
7. pickup white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is in the hand (satisfying constraint 8).
8. putdown white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is on the table.
9. unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1. Now red_block_1 is in the hand and purple_block_1 is clear.
10. stack red_block_1 on white_block_1. Now red_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and white_block_1 is not clear.
11. pickup purple_block_1. Now purple_block_1 is in the hand.
12. stack purple_block_1 on red_block_1. Now purple_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 and red_block_1 is not clear (satisfying constraint 2).
13. unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2. Now white_block_2 is in the hand and blue_block_2 is clear.
14. putdown white_block_2. Now white_block_2 is on the table (satisfying constraint 1).
15. unstack blue_block_2 from grey_block_1. Now blue_block_2 is in the hand and grey_block_1 is clear.
16. putdown blue_block_2. Now blue_block_2 is on the table (achieving our goal).
17. pickup grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 is in the hand, satisfying constraint 5 that grey_block_1 is not on the table at some point.
18. putdown grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 is on the table.
19. unstack purple_block_1 from red_block_1. Now purple_block_1 is in the hand and red_block_1 is clear.
20. stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1. Now purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 and grey_block_1 is not clear (satisfying constraint 3).

But wait, constraint 3 is a conditional: "If blue_block_1 is not on the table, then purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1." In our plan, blue_block_1 is on the table from step 6 onwards, so we don't need to satisfy the consequent after that. But blue_block_1 is not on the table from the initial state to step 6, and during this time, purple_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1. So we're not satisfying this constraint.

Actually, we mis-read the constraint. Let's re-read: "If expression 'blue_block_1 is not on the table' holds in some state s, then expression 'purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1' must hold at s or at some state after s"

This means that if blue_block_1 is not on the table at state s, then at state s or at a later state, purple_block_1 must be on top of grey_block_1. So if blue_block_1 is not on the table in the initial state (which it is, it's on white_block_1), then at some point in our plan (at or after the initial state), purple_block_1 must be on top of grey_block_1.

In our plan, at step 20, purple_block_1 is stacked on grey_block_1, so this satisfies the constraint.

Similarly, for constraint 1: "If red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 in state s, then white_block_2 is on the table must hold at s or at some later state." In the initial state, red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1, not on white_block_1, so at some point in our plan, white_block_2 must be on the table. In our plan, at step 14, white_block_2 is on the table, so this satisfies the constraint.

And for constraint 2: "If grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 in state s, then red_block_1 is not clear must hold at s or at some later state." In the initial state, grey_block_1 is on the table, not on white_block_1, so at some point in our plan, red_block_1 must not be clear. In our plan, at step 12, red_block_1 is not clear (because purple_block_1 is on top of it), so this satisfies the constraint.

For constraint 4: "If expression 'white_block_2 is clear' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'grey_block_1 is not clear'." In our plan, at step 15, white_block_2 is clear, so grey_block_1 must not be clear at some point before step 15. In our plan, at step 2, grey_block_1 is not clear (because blue_block_2 is on top of it), so this satisfies the constraint.

For constraint 5: "grey_block_1 must not be on the table at some point." In our plan, at step 17, grey_block_1 is in the hand, not on the table, so this satisfies the constraint.

For constraint 6: "blue_block_2 must not be clear at some point." In our plan, at step 4, blue_block_2 is not clear (because white_block_2 is on top of it), so this satisfies the constraint.

For constraint 7: "If expression 'blue_block_2 is not clear' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'red_block_1 is not clear or you are holding white_block_2'." In our plan, at step 4, blue_block_2 is not clear, so red_block_1 must not be clear or we must be holding white_block_2 at some point before step 4. In step 3, we are holding white_block_2, so this satisfies the constraint.

For constraint 8: "white_block_1 must be held at some point." In our plan, at step 7, white_block_1 is in the hand, so this satisfies the constraint.

So, our plan seems to satisfy all the constraints:

1. unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2
2. stack blue_block_2 on grey_block_1
3. unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1
4. stack white_block_2 on blue_block_2
5. unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1
6. putdown blue_block_1
7. pickup white_block_1
8. putdown white_block_1
9. unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1
10. stack red_block_1 on white_block_1
11. pickup purple_block_1
12. stack purple_block_1 on red_block_1
13. unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2
14. putdown white_block_2
15. unstack blue_block_2 from grey_block_1
16. putdown blue_block_2
17. pickup grey_block_1
18. putdown grey_block_1
19. unstack purple_block_1 from red_block_1
20. stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1

This plan is quite long. Let's check if we can optimize it. 

Hmm, actually the goal is just to have blue_block_2 on the table. There's likely a much simpler plan that satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal. Let me reconsider and see if I can come up with a more concise plan.

Let's start with the initial state and focus on the constraints that matter for our goal:

- Constraint 1: If red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, then white_block_2 must be on the table at some point.
  - red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1 in the initial state, not on white_block_1, so we need to have white_block_2 on the table at some point.

- Constraint 3: If blue_block_1 is not on the table, then purple_block_1 must be on top of grey_block_1 at some point.
  - blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 in the initial state, not on the table, so we need to have purple_block_1 on top of grey_block_1 at some point.

- Constraint 5: grey_block_1 must not be on the table at some point.
  - grey_block_1 is on the table in the initial state, so we need to pick it up or stack it somewhere.

- Constraint 8: white_block_1 must be held at some point.
  - white_block_1 is on the table in the initial state, so we need to pick it up at some point.

Alright, let's simplify and try a direct approach:

1. unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2. Now blue_block_2 is in the hand.
2. putdown blue_block_2. Now blue_block_2 is on the table (achieving our goal).
3. unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1. Now white_block_2 is in the hand.
4. putdown white_block_2. Now white_block_2 is on the table (satisfying constraint 1).
5. unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1. Now blue_block_1 is in the hand.
6. putdown blue_block_1. Now blue_block_1 is on the table.
7. pickup white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is in the hand (satisfying constraint 8).
8. putdown white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is on the table.
9. unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1. Now red_block_1 is in the hand and purple_block_1 is clear.
10. putdown red_block_1. Now red_block_1 is on the table.
11. pickup purple_block_1. Now purple_block_1 is in the hand.
12. pickup grey_block_1. This isn't possible since we're already holding purple_block_1.

So we have an issue with step 12. Let's correct our approach:

1. unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2. Now blue_block_2 is in the hand.
2. putdown blue_block_2. Now blue_block_2 is on the table (achieving our goal).
3. unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1. Now white_block_2 is in the hand.
4. putdown white_block_2. Now white_block_2 is on the table (satisfying constraint 1).
5. unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1. Now blue_block_1 is in the hand.
6. putdown blue_block_1. Now blue_block_1 is on the table.
7. pickup white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is in the hand (satisfying constraint 8).
8. putdown white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is on the table.
9. pickup grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 is in the hand (satisfying constraint 5).
10. putdown grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 is on the table.
11. unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1. Now red_block_1 is in the hand and purple_block_1 is clear.
12. putdown red_block_1. Now red_block_1 is on the table.
13. pickup purple_block_1. Now purple_block_1 is in the hand.
14. stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1. Now purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 (satisfying constraint 3).

I think this plan satisfies all the constraints:

- Constraint 1: In step 4, white_block_2 is on the table.
- Constraint 2: red_block_1 is not clear when purple_block_1 is on top of it, which doesn't happen in our plan. But this constraint is a conditional: "If grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 in state s, then red_block_1 is not clear must hold at s or at some later state." grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 in the initial state, so we need to ensure red_block_1 is not clear at some point. In our plan, red_block_1 is always clear from step 12 onwards, so we're not satisfying this constraint.
- Constraint 3: In step 14, purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1.
- Constraint 4: "If expression 'white_block_2 is clear' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which grey_block_1 is not clear." white_block_2 is clear after step 3, so before that, grey_block_1 must not be clear. In our plan, grey_block_1 is clear in the initial state, so we're not satisfying this constraint.
- Constraint 5: In step 9, grey_block_1 is in the hand, not on the table.
- Constraint 6: "blue_block_2 must not be clear at some point." In our plan, blue_block_2 is clear after we put it down in step 2, which doesn't satisfy the constraint.
- Constraint 7: Not applicable since we haven't made blue_block_2 not clear.
- Constraint 8: In step 7, white_block_1 is in the hand.

Hmm, we're still not satisfying constraints 2, 4, and 6. Let's redo our plan:

1. unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2. Now blue_block_2 is in the hand.
2. stack blue_block_2 on grey_block_1. Now blue_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1 and grey_block_1 is not clear (satisfying part of constraint 4).
3. unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1. Now white_block_2 is in the hand.
4. stack white_block_2 on blue_block_2. Now white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_2 and blue_block_2 is not clear (satisfying constraint 6).
5. unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1. Now blue_block_1 is in the hand.
6. stack blue_block_1 on white_block_2. Now blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_2 and white_block_2 is not clear.
7. pickup white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is in the hand (satisfying constraint 8).
8. putdown white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is on the table.
9. unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1. Now red_block_1 is in the hand and purple_block_1 is clear.
10. stack red_block_1 on white_block_1. Now red_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and white_block_1 is not clear.
11. pickup purple_block_1. Now purple_block_1 is in the hand.
12. stack purple_block_1 on red_block_1. Now purple_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 and red_block_1 is not clear (satisfying constraint 2).
13. unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_2. Now blue_block_1 is in the hand and white_block_2 is clear (here, we needed to ensure grey_block_1 is not clear at some point before this, which we did in step 2).
14. putdown blue_block_1. Now blue_block_1 is on the table.
15. unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2. Now white_block_2 is in the hand and blue_block_2 is clear.
16. putdown white_block_2. Now white_block_2 is on the table (satisfying constraint 1).
17. unstack blue_block_2 from grey_block_1. Now blue_block_2 is in the hand and grey_block_1 is clear.
18. putdown blue_block_2. Now blue_block_2 is on the table (achieving our goal).
19. pickup grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 is in the hand (satisfying constraint 5).
20. putdown grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 is on the table.
21. unstack purple_block_1 from red_block_1. Now purple_block_1 is in the hand and red_block_1 is clear.
22. stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1. Now purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 and grey_block_1 is not clear (satisfying constraint 3).

I believe this plan satisfies all the constraints:

- Constraint 1: In step 16, white_block_2 is on the table.
- Constraint 2: In step 12, red_block_1 is not clear.
- Constraint 3: In step 22, purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1.
- Constraint 4: In step 13, white_block_2 is clear. Before this, in step 2, grey_block_1 is not clear.
- Constraint 5: In step 19, grey_block_1 is in the hand.
- Constraint 6: In step 4, blue_block_2 is not clear.
- Constraint 7: In step 4, blue_block_2 is not clear, and in step 3, we're holding white_block_2.
- Constraint 8: In step 7, white_block_1 is in the hand.

But our plan is still quite long. Let's check for optimality, which means a valid plan whose length is equal or less than the length of any other valid plan. But before I redo anything, I realize that there's a constraint 7 which says "If blue_block_2 is not clear, then red_block_1 is not clear or we are holding white_block_2" at some earlier state." 

Actually, no, I re-read the constraint and it says "If blue_block_2 is not clear, then there must be an earlier state in which "red_block_1 is not clear" or "you are holding white_block_2" is true." So before blue_block_2 is not clear, red_block_1 must not be clear or we are holding white_block_2. In our plan, blue_block_2 is not clear at step 4, and at step 3, we are holding white_block_2, so this constraint is satisfied.

We want an optimal plan, so let's try to reduce the length of the plan:

1. unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2. Now blue_block_2 is in the hand.
2. putdown blue_block_2. Now blue_block_2 is on the table (achieving our goal).
3. unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1. Now white_block_2 is in the hand.
4. stack white_block_2 on blue_block_2. Now white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_2 and blue_block_2 is not clear (satisfying constraint 6).
5. unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2. Now white_block_2 is in the hand and blue_block_2 is clear.
6. putdown white_block_2. Now white_block_2 is on the table (satisfying constraint 1).
7. pickup grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 is in the hand (satisfying constraint 5).
8. stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2. Now grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2 and blue_block_2 is not clear (satisfying constraint 6 again).
9. unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_2. Now grey_block_1 is in the hand and blue_block_2 is clear.
10. putdown grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 is on the table.
11. unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1. Now blue_block_1 is in the hand.
12. stack blue_block_1 on grey_block_1. Now blue_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 and grey_block_1 is not clear (satisfying part of constraint 4).
13. unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1. Now red_block_1 is in the hand and purple_block_1 is clear.
14. stack red_block_1 on blue_block_1. Now red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1 and blue_block_1 is not clear.
15. pickup white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is in the hand (satisfying constraint 8).
16. stack white_block_1 on red_block_1. Now white_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 and red_block_1 is not clear (satisfying constraint 2).
17. pickup purple_block_1. Now purple_block_1 is in the hand.
18. stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1. This isn't possible as grey_block_1 already has blocks on top of it.

Actually, I see an issue. We need to make sure purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 at some point, but in my last plan, grey_block_1 always has blocks on top of it after step 12, making it impossible to stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1.

Let's redo our approach:

1. unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2. Now blue_block_2 is in the hand.
2. putdown blue_block_2. Now blue_block_2 is on the table (achieving our goal).
3. unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1. Now white_block_2 is in the hand.
4. stack white_block_2 on blue_block_2. Now white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_2 and blue_block_2 is not clear (satisfying constraint 6).
5. unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2. Now white_block_2 is in the hand and blue_block_2 is clear.
6. putdown white_block_2. Now white_block_2 is on the table (satisfying constraint 1).
7. pickup grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 is in the hand (satisfying constraint 5).
8. putdown grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 is on the table.
9. unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1. Now red_block_1 is in the hand and purple_block_1 is clear.
10. stack red_block_1 on blue_block_2. Now red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2 and blue_block_2 is not clear.
11. pickup purple_block_1. Now purple_block_1 is in the hand.
12. stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1. Now purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 and grey_block_1 is not clear (satisfying constraint 3).
13. pickup white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is in the hand (satisfying constraint 8).
14. stack white_block_1 on purple_block_1. Now white_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1 and purple_block_1 is not clear.
15. unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1. This is not possible as white_block_1 is no longer in its original location. So there's an error in my reasoning.

Let me try one more time. 

I think I've been overthinking this problem. The goal is very simple: blue_block_2 should be on the table. In the initial state, blue_block_2 is on top of a stack, so we just need to unstack it and put it on the table. However, we also need to satisfy all the constraints.

Let's carefully think about the constraints:

1. "If red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, then white_block_2 must be on the table at some point."
  - red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1, not on white_block_1, in the initial state, so white_block_2 must be on the table at some point.
  - This would require us to unstack white_block_2 and put it on the table, but it's initially on top of blue_block_1, not directly on the table.

2. "If grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, then red_block_1 must not be clear at some point."
  - grey_block_1 is on the table, not on top of white_block_1, in the initial state, so red_block_1 must not be clear at some point.
  - This would require us to stack a block on top of red_block_1.

3. "If blue_block_1 is not on the table, then purple_block_1 must be on top of grey_block_1 at some point."
  - blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, not on the table, in the initial state, so purple_block_1 must be on top of grey_block_1 at some point.
  - This would require us to unstack purple_block_1 and stack it on top of grey_block_1.

4. "If white_block_2 is clear, then grey_block_1 must not be clear at some earlier point."
  - white_block_2 is not clear in the initial state (blue_block_2 is on top of it), but if we make it clear by unstacking blue_block_2, then grey_block_1 must not be clear at some point before that.
  - This would require us to stack a block on top of grey_block_1 before unstacking blue_block_2.

5. "grey_block_1 must not be on the table at some point."
  - grey_block_1 is on the table in the initial state, so we need to pick it up at some point.

6. "blue_block_2 must not be clear at some point."
  - blue_block_2 is clear in the initial state, so we need to stack a block on top of it at some point.

7. "If blue_block_2 is not clear, then red_block_1 must not be clear or you must be holding white_block_2 at some earlier point."
  - Before we make blue_block_2 not clear by stacking a block on top of it, red_block_1 must not be clear or we must be holding white_block_2.

8. "white_block_1 must be held at some point."
  - white_block_1 is on the table in the initial state, so we need to pick it up at some point.

These constraints seem like a complex puzzle, but let's try to build a plan step by step:

1. unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2. Now blue_block_2 is in the hand and white_block_2 is clear. But according to constraint 4, grey_block_1 must not be clear at some point before this, which is not the case in the initial state.

So, I need to first make grey_block_1 not clear:

1. unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1. Now red_block_1 is in the hand and purple_block_1 is clear.
2. stack red_block_1 on grey_block_1. Now red_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 and grey_block_1 is not clear (satisfying part of constraint 4).
3. unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2. Now blue_block_2 is in the hand and white_block_2 is clear (completing constraint 4).
4. stack blue_block_2 on red_block_1. Now blue_block_2 is on top of red_block_1, red_block_1 is not clear (satisfying constraint 2), and blue_block_2 is on top of a stack, not on the table.
5. unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1. Now white_block_2 is in the hand (satisfying part of constraint 7 for future steps) and blue_block_1 is clear.
6. stack white_block_2 on blue_block_2. Now white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_2 and blue_block_2 is not clear (satisfying constraint 6). This also satisfies constraint 7 because we were holding white_block_2 in the previous step.
7. unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1. Now blue_block_1 is in the hand and white_block_1 is clear.
8. putdown blue_block_1. Now blue_block_1 is on the table.
9. pickup white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is in the hand (satisfying constraint 8).
10. putdown white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is on the table.
11. pickup purple_block_1. Now purple_block_1 is in the hand.
12. stack purple_block_1 on white_block_1. Now purple_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and white_block_1 is not clear.
13. unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2. Now white_block_2 is in the hand and blue_block_2 is clear.
14. putdown white_block_2. Now white_block_2 is on the table (satisfying constraint 1).
15. unstack blue_block_2 from red_block_1. Now blue_block_2 is in the hand and red_block_1 is clear.
16. putdown blue_block_2. Now blue_block_2 is on the table (achieving our goal).
17. unstack red_block_1 from grey_block_1. Now red_block_1 is in the hand and grey_block_1 is clear.
18. putdown red_block_1. Now red_block_1 is on the table.
19. pickup grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 is in the hand (satisfying constraint 5).
20. putdown grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 is on the table.
21. unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1. Now purple_block_1 is in the hand and white_block_1 is clear.
22. stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1. Now purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 and grey_block_1 is not clear (satisfying constraint 3).

I think this plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves our goal. Let's double-check:

1. "If red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, then white_block_2 must be on the table at some point." In the initial state, red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1, not on white_block_1. In step 14, white_block_2 is on the table. So this constraint is satisfied.

2. "If grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, then red_block_1 must not be clear at some point." In the initial state, grey_block_1 is on the table, not on top of white_block_1. In step 4, red_block_1 is not clear (as blue_block_2 is on top of it). So this constraint is satisfied.

3. "If blue_block_1 is not on the table, then purple_block_1 must be on top of grey_block_1 at some point." In the initial state, blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, not on the table. In step 22, purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1. So this constraint is satisfied.

4. "If white_block_2 is clear, then grey_block_1 must not be clear at some earlier point." In step 3, white_block_2 is clear. In step 2, which is before step 3, grey_block_1 is not clear. So this constraint is satisfied.

5. "grey_block_1 must not be on the table at some point." In step 19, grey_block_1 is in the hand, not on the table. So this constraint is satisfied.

6. "blue_block_2 must not be clear at some point." In step 6, blue_block_2 is not clear (as white_block_2 is on top of it). So this constraint is satisfied.

7. "If blue_block_2 is not clear, then red_block_1 must not be clear or you must be holding white_block_2 at some earlier point." In step 6, blue_block_2 is not clear. In step 5, which is before step 6, we are holding white_block_2. So this constraint is satisfied.

8. "white_block_1 must be held at some point." In step 9, white_block_1 is in the hand. So this constraint is satisfied.

All constraints are satisfied and the goal is achieved. However, this plan has 22 steps, which may not be optimal.

Let's try to optimize it a bit more. I think I did make our plan overly complex by doing actions not necessary for the goal. Since the goal is just to have blue_block_2 on the table, let's focus on a more direct plan while ensuring all constraints are satisfied.

Here's a more concise plan:

1. unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2. Now blue_block_2 is in the hand and white_block_2 is clear. For constraint 4, I need to ensure grey_block_1 is not clear at some point before this.
2. putdown blue_block_2. Now blue_block_2 is on the table (achieving our goal).

This plan has only 2 steps, but it doesn't satisfy all the constraints. The constraints are more complex and require a bunch of distinct events to occur. So, we'll likely need a more involved plan. I think my 22-step plan from earlier is unnecessarily complex. Let me try again with a focus on efficiency:

1. pickup grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 is in the hand (satisfying constraint 5).
2. putdown grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 is on the table.
3. unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1. Now red_block_1 is in the hand and purple_block_1 is clear.
4. stack red_block_1 on grey_block_1. Now red_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 and grey_block_1 is not clear (satisfying part of constraint 4).
5. unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2. Now blue_block_2 is in the hand and white_block_2 is clear (completing constraint 4).
6. stack blue_block_2 on red_block_1. Now blue_block_2 is on top of red_block_1 and red_block_1 is not clear (satisfying constraint 2).
7. pickup purple_block_1. Now purple_block_1 is in the hand.
8. stack purple_block_1 on blue_block_2. Now purple_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2 and blue_block_2 is not clear (satisfying constraint 6).
9. unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1. Now white_block_2 is in the hand (satisfying part of constraint 7 for future steps) and blue_block_1 is clear.
10. putdown white_block_2. Now white_block_2 is on the table (satisfying constraint 1).
11. pickup white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is in the hand (satisfying constraint 8).
12. putdown white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is on the table.
13. unstack purple_block_1 from blue_block_2. Now purple_block_1 is in the hand and blue_block_2 is clear.
14. stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1. Now purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 and grey_block_1 is not clear (satisfying constraint 3).
15. unstack blue_block_2 from red_block_1. Now blue_block_2 is in the hand and red_block_1 is clear.
16. putdown blue_block_2. Now blue_block_2 is on the table (achieving our goal).

OK, this looks pretty good. Let's double-check the constraints:

1. "If red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, then white_block_2 must be on the table at some point." In the initial state, red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1, not on white_block_1. In step 10, white_block_2 is on the table. So this constraint is satisfied.

2. "If grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, then red_block_1 must not be clear at some point." In the initial state, grey_block_1 is on the table, not on top of white_block_1. In step 6, red_block_1 is not clear. So this constraint is satisfied.

3. "If blue_block_1 is not on the table, then purple_block_1 must be on top of grey_block_1 at some point." In the initial state, blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, not on the table. In step 14, purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1. So this constraint is satisfied.

4. "If white_block_2 is clear, then grey_block_1 must not be clear at some earlier point." In step 5, white_block_2 is clear. In step 4, which is before step 5, grey_block_1 is not clear. So this constraint is satisfied.

5. "grey_block_1 must not be on the table at some point." In step 1, grey_block_1 is in the hand, not on the table. So this constraint is satisfied.

6. "blue_block_2 must not be clear at some point." In step 8, blue_block_2 is not clear. So this constraint is satisfied.

7. "If blue_block_2 is not clear, then red_block_1 must not be clear or you must be holding white_block_2 at some earlier point." In step 8, blue_block_2 is not clear. In step 6, which is before step 8, red_block_1 is not clear. So this constraint is satisfied.

8. "white_block_1 must be held at some point." In step 11, white_block_1 is in the hand. So this constraint is satisfied.

All constraints are satisfied and the goal is achieved. Our plan has 16 steps.

I think the plan I've constructed is not yet optimal. Let's see if we can shorten it further.

Let me think carefully about which actions are necessary and which might be redundant. But first I should check if there are any additional optimizations I could make with the existing plan structure.

I realized that step 8 is to stack purple_block_1 on blue_block_2 and then in step 13 we unstack it again. This is done just to make blue_block_2 not clear at some point, which satisfies constraint 6. But another way to achieve the same thing is to use white_block_2. After we pick up white_block_2 in step 9, we could stack it on blue_block_2 instead of putting it on the table, making blue_block_2 not clear. Then we could later unstack white_block_2 when we're ready to move blue_block_2.

Also, the constraint says "blue_block_2 must not be clear at some point." So we just need to make it not clear at any point in the plan, even if it's just temporary.

Actually, we might be able to simplify even further. Let's try to construct a plan from scratch with a focus on efficiency.

1. pickup grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 is in the hand (satisfying constraint 5).
2. putdown grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 is on the table.
3. pickup white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is in the hand (satisfying constraint 8).
4. putdown white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is on the table.
5. unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1. Now red_block_1 is in the hand and purple_block_1 is clear.
6. stack red_block_1 on grey_block_1. Now red_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 and grey_block_1 is not clear (satisfying part of constraint 4).
7. pickup purple_block_1. Now purple_block_1 is in the hand.
8. stack purple_block_1 on red_block_1. Now purple_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 and red_block_1 is not clear (satisfying constraint 2).
9. unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2. Now blue_block_2 is in the hand and white_block_2 is clear (completing constraint 4).
10. stack blue_block_2 on purple_block_1. Now blue_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1 and purple_block_1 is not clear.
11. unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1. Now white_block_2 is in the hand (satisfying part of constraint 7 for future steps) and blue_block_1 is clear.
12. stack white_block_2 on blue_block_2. Now white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_2 and blue_block_2 is not clear (satisfying constraint 6). This also satisfies constraint 7 because we were holding white_block_2 in the previous step.
13. unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2. Now white_block_2 is in the hand and blue_block_2 is clear.
14. putdown white_block_2. Now white_block_2 is on the table (satisfying constraint 1).
15. unstack blue_block_2 from purple_block_1. Now blue_block_2 is in the hand and purple_block_1 is clear.
16. putdown blue_block_2. Now blue_block_2 is on the table (achieving our goal).
17. unstack purple_block_1 from red_block_1. Now purple_block_1 is in the hand and red_block_1 is clear.
18. stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1. Now purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 and grey_block_1 is not clear (satisfying constraint 3).

OK, this plan actually has 18, not 16 steps. I admit that I messed up the counts. But I think this is still a long plan.

Actually, wait, constraint 3 says "If blue_block_1 is not on the table, then purple_block_1 must be on top of grey_block_1 at some point." In the initial state, blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, not on the table. So at some point, purple_block_1 must be on top of grey_block_1. But it doesn't have to be the final state. We could have purple_block_1 on top of grey_block_1 at some intermediate point in the plan.

Let me try once more from scratch with a focus on efficiency:

1. unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1. Now red_block_1 is in the hand and purple_block_1 is clear.
2. stack red_block_1 on grey_block_1. Now red_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 and grey_block_1 is not clear (satisfying part of constraint 4).
3. pickup purple_block_1. Now purple_block_1 is in the hand.
4. stack purple_block_1 on red_block_1. Now purple_block_1 is on top of red_block_1, red_block_1 is not clear (satisfying constraint 2), and grey_block_1 is still not clear.
5. unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2. Now blue_block_2 is in the hand and white_block_2 is clear (completing constraint 4).
6. stack blue_block_2 on purple_block_1. Now blue_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1 and purple_block_1 is not clear.
7. unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1. Now white_block_2 is in the hand and blue_block_1 is clear.
8. putdown white_block_2. Now white_block_2 is on the table (satisfying constraint 1).
9. pickup white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is in the hand (satisfying constraint 8).
10. stack white_block_1 on blue_block_2. Now white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2 and blue_block_2 is not clear (satisfying constraint 6).
11. unstack white_block_1 from blue_block_2. Now white_block_1 is in the hand and blue_block_2 is clear.
12. putdown white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is on the table.
13. unstack blue_block_2 from purple_block_1. Now blue_block_2 is in the hand and purple_block_1 is clear.
14. putdown blue_block_2. Now blue_block_2 is on the table (achieving our goal).
15. unstack purple_block_1 from red_block_1. Now purple_block_1 is in the hand and red_block_1 is clear.
16. unstack red_block_1 from grey_block_1. Now red_block_1 is in the hand and grey_block_1 is clear.
17. putdown red_block_1. Now red_block_1 is on the table.
18. stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1. Now purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 and grey_block_1 is not clear (satisfying constraint 3).
19. pickup grey_block_1. This isn't possible since grey_block_1 has a block on top of it, which is purple_block_1.

Hmm, we have an issue with step 19. We need grey_block_1 to not be on the table at some point (constraint 5), but it has a block on top of it at the end. I think we need to make sure grey_block_1 is not on the table earlier in the plan. Let's redo this:

1. pickup grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 is in the hand (satisfying constraint 5).
2. putdown grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 is on the table.
3. unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1. Now red_block_1 is in the hand and purple_block_1 is clear.
4. stack red_block_1 on grey_block_1. Now re
