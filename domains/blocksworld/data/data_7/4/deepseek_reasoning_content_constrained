Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld planning problem. The goal is to get blue_block_2 on the table, but there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy along the way. First, I need to understand the initial state and all the constraints.

Starting with the initial state:
- white_block_1 is on the table with blue_block_1 on it, then white_block_2 on blue_block_1, and blue_block_2 on top of that. So the tower is white_block_1 (table), blue_block_1, white_block_2, blue_block_2.
- purple_block_1 is on the table with red_block_1 on top.
- grey_block_1 is alone on the table.
- All the top blocks (red_block_1, grey_block_1, blue_block_2) are clear, and the arm is empty.

The goal is to have blue_block_2 on the table. So I need to unstack it from white_block_2 and put it down. But to do that, I must first remove any blocks above it, but blue_block_2 is already clear. Wait, blue_block_2 is the top of its tower. So to get it on the table, the plan would be to unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2 and put it down. But wait, the arm needs to be empty to unstack. Let's see:

Current stack for blue_block_2: white_block_1 (table) -> blue_block_1 -> white_block_2 -> blue_block_2. So blue_block_2 is on white_block_2, which is on blue_block_1, etc. To unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2, the preconditions are that blue_block_2 is clear (which it is), and the arm is empty (which it is). So maybe start with unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2, then put it down. But wait, after unstacking, the arm is holding blue_block_2. Then putdown blue_block_2. That would achieve the goal in two actions. But wait, the constraints might require more steps.

But there are multiple constraints that need to be satisfied in the plan. Let's list them all:

Constraints:
1. At least once, red_block_1 is not on white_block_1. Currently, red_block_1 is on purple_block_1, so this is already true. Wait, initial state: red is on purple. So in the initial state, "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is already true. So that condition is met. But the second part of the constraint says that if that's true in some state s, then white_block_2 must be on the table in s or after. However, in the initial state, white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1, not on the table. So the initial state satisfies the first part, but the second part requires that white_block_2 must be on the table at some point after. So even if the first condition is already met in the initial state, we need to ensure that white_block_2 is on the table at some point. So maybe putting white_block_2 on the table at some point is required.

Constraint 3: At least once, grey_block_1 is not on white_block_1. Currently, grey_block_1 is on the table. So this is true only if grey_block_1 is moved onto some other block, but not white_block_1. Wait, the condition is "grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1". Since it's on the table, that's true. Wait, the initial state has grey_block_1 on the table, so "grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is already true. So the constraint is already satisfied in the initial state. But then the second part of this constraint requires that if in state s, this holds, then in s or after, red_block_1 is not clear. So in the initial state, red_block_1 is clear (since there's nothing on top of it). So we need to have red_block_1 not clear (i.e., something on top of it) at some point after the initial state.

Constraint 5: At least once, blue_block_1 is not on the table. Currently, blue_block_1 is on white_block_1, which is on the table. So blue_block_1 is not on the table. Wait, blue_block_1 is on white_block_1, which is on the table, so blue_block_1 is not on the table. So the initial state already satisfies this. Then the second part says that if blue_block_1 is not on the table (which it is now), then purple_block_1 must be on grey_block_1 at s or after. So in the initial state, purple_block_1 is on the table with red on top. So we need to stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1 at some point.

Constraint 7: At least once, white_block_2 is clear. Currently, blue_block_2 is on white_block_2, so white_block_2 is not clear. So we need to make white_block_2 clear at some point. Then the constraint says that if in some state white_block_2 is clear, there must be an earlier state where grey_block_1 is not clear (i.e., something on top). So we need to put something on grey_block_1 before making white_block_2 clear.

Constraint 8: At least once, grey_block_1 is not on the table. So we need to move grey_block_1 onto another block.

Constraint 9: At least once, blue_block_2 is not clear. Since blue_block_2 is clear initially, we need to stack something on top of it. Then, when that happens, there must be an earlier state where either red_block_1 is not clear or the arm is holding white_block_2.

Constraint 10: At least once, the arm is holding white_block_1. So we need to pick up white_block_1.

So the main goal is to get blue_block_2 on the table, but all these constraints must be met during the plan.

Let me try to outline steps:

First, blue_block_2 is on white_block_2. To move it to the table, unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2, then put it down. But wait, unstack requires that the arm is empty, which it is. Then after unstack, blue_block_2 is held, and then putdown. But doing that would achieve the goal in two steps, but need to check constraints.

But let's see the constraints:

After unstack and putdown, blue_block_2 is on the table, but let's check the constraints.

But the constraints require several other things. For example, constraint 10 requires that we hold white_block_1 at some point. So even if we can achieve the goal quickly, we need to include actions to meet all constraints.

So the minimal plan must include steps to satisfy all the constraints, even if they are not directly related to the goal.

Let's list all constraints again:

1. red_block_1 not on white_block_1: already true in initial state. But requires that white_block_2 is on the table at some point. So in the plan, white_block_2 must be placed on the table.

3. grey_block_1 not on white_block_1: already true. So need to have red_block_1 not clear (i.e., something on top) after that.

5. blue_block_1 not on table: already true. So need purple_block_1 on grey_block_1 at some point.

7. white_block_2 clear: in the initial state, it's not clear (blue_block_2 is on it). To make it clear, we can remove blue_block_2 (which is part of the goal). After unstack blue_block_2, white_block_2 becomes clear. So this condition would be met in that state. But then the constraint requires that before that, grey_block_1 was not clear (i.e., something on top). So before white_block_2 becomes clear (which is when we unstack blue_block_2), we need to have a state where grey_block_1 has a block on top.

8. grey_block_1 not on table: so we need to stack it onto another block.

9. blue_block_2 not clear: need to put something on it. But the goal is to have it on the table. So after putting it down, perhaps stack something on it, but then we have to remove it again? But that might complicate. Alternatively, maybe before moving blue_block_2 to the table, we can stack something on it. But in the initial state, blue_block_2 is clear. So to satisfy this constraint, maybe stack a block on blue_block_2, then unstack it again. But that's extra steps.

10. Hold white_block_1: need to pick it up. But white_block_1 is on the table, with blue_block_1 on top. So to pick up white_block_1, we need to clear it first. So blue_block_1 is on white_block_1, which is on the table. So to pick up white_block_1, we need to first remove blue_block_1. But blue_block_1 has white_block_2 and blue_block_2 on top. So we need to unstack blue_block_2, then unstack white_block_2, then unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1, then pick up white_block_1. But that's a lot of steps. But constraint 10 requires that we hold white_block_1 at least once. So this seems necessary.

So the plan has to include:

- Unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2 and put it down (to achieve the goal).

But to do that, white_block_2 must be clear. Wait, no: unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2 requires that blue_block_2 is on white_block_2 and the arm is empty. Which is true. So the first action can be unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2, then putdown blue_block_2. But then, after that, white_block_2 is clear (since blue_block_2 was removed). But according to constraint 7, when white_block_2 is clear, there must have been a prior state where grey_block_1 was not clear. So before unstacking blue_block_2, we need to put a block on grey_block_1.

So steps:

1. Put a block on grey_block_1. Let's choose purple_block_1, which is on the table with red_block_1 on top. To move purple_block_1, first need to remove red_block_1. So unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1, then put it down. Then stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1. But this would satisfy constraint 5's implication, because purple_block_1 is on grey_block_1. Also, putting red_block_1 down would make red_block_1 clear again, but we need to have something on red_block_1 (due to constraint 3's implication). So maybe after moving purple_block_1 to grey_block_1, we can stack red_block_1 on another block.

But let's proceed step by step.

Constraints:

- Need to have purple_block_1 on grey_block_1 (due to constraint 5's implication).

- Need to have something on red_block_1 (due to constraint 3's implication).

- Need to have something on blue_block_2 (constraint 9), but the goal is blue_block_2 on table, so perhaps before putting it down, we stack something on it and then unstack again.

But that complicates. Alternatively, after putting blue_block_2 on the table, stack something else on it, but then the goal is achieved, but blue_block_2 is on the table. Then maybe stack and unstack again. But that's extra steps. But perhaps necessary.

But maybe there's a smarter way.

Also, need to hold white_block_1 (constraint 10). So at some point, pick up white_block_1, which is under blue_block_1. So need to unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1. But blue_block_1 has white_block_2 and blue_block_2 on top. So first, unstack blue_block_2, then white_block_2, then blue_block_1. Then pickup white_block_1, then put it down again. But this seems necessary.

Putting all together:

Possible steps:

1. Unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2. Now holding blue_block_2. White_block_2 is clear.

But constraint 7 says that when white_block_2 is clear, there must be an earlier state where grey_block_1 is not clear. So before step 1, we need to have something on grey_block_1.

So before step 1, need to stack something on grey_block_1.

How to do that:

Let's first move purple_block_1 to grey_block_1. To do that:

a. Unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1 (since purple is under red). Preconditions: red is clear (it is), arm is empty. So unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1. Now holding red_block_1.

b. Putdown red_block_1. Now red is on the table, clear.

c. Now, purple_block_1 is clear. Pickup purple_block_1. Then stack it on grey_block_1. Now, purple is on grey. This satisfies constraint 5's implication (since blue_block_1 is not on the table, and purple is on grey). Also, now grey_block_1 has a block on top (purple), so it's not clear. This can help with constraint 7, as after this, when we make white_block_2 clear (by unstacking blue_block_2), we have the prior state where grey_block_1 was not clear.

So steps up to here:

1. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1

2. putdown red_block_1

3. pickup purple_block_1

4. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1

Now, purple is on grey, which meets constraint 5's implication. Also, grey_block_1 is not on the table (it's on purple_block_1?), wait no: purple is on grey. So grey_block_1 is on the table, with purple on top. So grey_block_1 is not on the table? No, wait: the constraint 8 requires that grey_block_1 is not on the table at least once. If we stack something on grey_block_1, then grey_block_1 is still on the table. Because the table is the base. So stacking purple on grey doesn't take grey off the table. So grey remains on the table. So that's not satisfying constraint 8. So we need to have grey_block_1 not on the table, meaning it's on top of another block. But how? To do that, we need to pick up grey_block_1 and stack it on another block.

But wait, grey_block_1 is on the table. So to make it not on the table, we need to stack it onto another block. But to do that, we have to pick it up. But in the current state after step 4, purple is on grey, so grey is not clear. So we can't pick up grey_block_1 unless we clear it. So maybe after step 4, we need to move purple_block_1 again.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's think.

Constraint 8: grey_block_1 must be not on the table in some state. So we need to have grey_block_1 stacked on another block. So to do that:

- First, clear grey_block_1 (if it's covered). Initially, grey is clear. But after step 4, purple is on grey, so grey is not clear. So to move grey, we need to first remove whatever is on top of it. Wait, no: to pick up grey_block_1, it needs to be clear. But if something is on top of it (like purple), you can't pick up grey. So to stack grey on another block, we need to first remove the block on top of it. So in this case, after step 4, purple is on grey. To move grey, we'd have to unstack purple from grey, then pickup grey and stack it elsewhere. But that seems like a lot of steps. Alternatively, maybe we can stack grey on another block before anything is stacked on it.

But initially, grey is on the table and clear. So maybe:

After step 4 (purple on grey), we need to move grey. But that's not possible. So perhaps the initial plan to stack purple on grey doesn't help with constraint 8, because grey is still on the table. So maybe we need to stack grey_block_1 onto another block. For example, stack grey_block_1 onto white_block_1. But white_block_1 has blue_block_1, white_block_2, blue_block_2 on top. To stack grey on white_block_1, we need to clear white_block_1. But that would require moving the entire tower. Alternatively, stack grey_block_1 onto red_block_1. But red is on the table. So if we stack grey on red, then grey is not on the table. So steps to do that:

Pickup grey_block_1 (it's clear), then stack it on red_block_1. But red_block_1 is on the table and clear. So stack grey_block_1 red_block_1. Then grey is not on the table, satisfying constraint 8. But also, when we stack grey on red, red is no longer clear, satisfying constraint 3's implication (since after grey is moved, the condition "grey is not on white_block_1" is still true, but we need to have red not clear. By stacking grey on red, red is not clear, which satisfies that.

But this approach may require fewer steps.

Let me rethink:

Alternative approach:

To satisfy constraint 8 (grey not on table), stack grey onto red. Steps:

1. pickup grey_block_1 (since it's clear and on table).

2. stack grey_block_1 red_block_1.

Now, grey is on red, so not on table. This satisfies constraint 8. Also, red is now not clear (since grey is on it), which satisfies constraint 3's implication (since whenever grey is not on white_block_1, which it is not, red must be not clear). And since we just stacked grey on red, red is not clear.

Additionally, we need to satisfy constraint 7: white_block_2 is clear in some state, and before that, grey was not clear. But if we stack grey on red, then grey is not clear (since something is on top of it?), no. Wait, grey is on red. So grey is on top of red. So red has grey on top, so red is not clear. But grey is clear (if nothing is on top). Wait, no: if grey is on red, then grey's status depends on whether something is on top. Initially, after stacking grey on red, grey is clear unless something is stacked on it. So in this case, after step 2, grey is on red and clear. So red is not clear (has grey on it), and grey is clear. So to satisfy constraint 7, which requires that when white_block_2 is clear, there's a prior state where grey was not clear. Hmm. Not sure if this approach helps.

But let's proceed. The main point is that stacking grey on red would satisfy constraint 8 and part of constraint 3.

But let's return to the main goal and other constraints.

The main goal is to get blue_block_2 on the table. Let's think about the steps needed for that.

The initial stack is:

white_block_1 (table) → blue_block_1 → white_block_2 → blue_block_2.

So to get blue_block_2 down, we need to unstack it from white_block_2. But white_block_2 is on blue_block_1. So to unstack blue_block_2, the arm is empty. So:

Action 1: unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2 → holding blue_block_2, white_block_2 is clear.

Action 2: putdown blue_block_2 → blue_block_2 is on table. Goal achieved.

But this plan doesn't address the constraints. So need to integrate the constraints.

Now, let's list all constraints and see which ones are already satisfied and which need action:

1. red_block_1 not on white_block_1: initial state is true. So white_block_2 must be on the table at some point. But in this simple plan, white_block_2 remains on blue_block_1. So we need to move white_block_2 to the table. Hence, after unstacking blue_block_2, we need to putdown white_block_2.

Wait, but white_block_2 is on blue_block_1. So after unstacking blue_block_2, white_block_2 is still on blue_block_1. So to put white_block_2 on the table, we need to unstack it from blue_block_1.

But let's adjust the plan:

1. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2 → holding blue_block_2.

2. putdown blue_block_2 → done. But white_block_2 is still on blue_block_1. To satisfy constraint 1's implication (white_block_2 must be on table at some point), we need to move white_block_2 to the table.

So:

3. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1 → holding white_block_2.

4. putdown white_block_2 → now it's on the table.

But then we've satisfied the implication of constraint 1.

But also, constraint 7: when white_block_2 is clear (after step 1), we need a prior state where grey was not clear. But in the initial state, grey is clear. So if we stack something on grey before step 1, then when white_block_2 becomes clear, there's a prior state where grey was not clear.

So perhaps, before unstacking blue_block_2, we need to stack something on grey_block_1.

But grey_block_1 is on the table. Let's stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1. But purple_block_1 has red_block_1 on top. So steps:

0.1 unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1 → holding red.

0.2 putdown red_block_1 → red is on table.

0.3 pickup purple_block_1 → holding purple.

0.4 stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1 → purple on grey.

Now, grey has purple on top, so not clear. Then, when we later make white_block_2 clear (step 1), the prior state (step 0.4) had grey not clear, satisfying constraint 7.

Then proceed to unstack blue_block_2, etc.

But then, constraint 5's implication requires that when blue_block_1 is not on the table (which it is initially), then purple must be on grey. Which is satisfied in step 0.4.

But also, constraint 8 requires that grey is not on the table. But after stacking purple on grey, grey is still on the table (since the stack is table → grey_block_1 → purple_block_1). So grey is still on the table. So constraint 8 is not satisfied. So we need to move grey_block_1 off the table.

To do that, we need to stack grey_block_1 onto another block. But grey is under purple. So we need to unstack purple from grey first:

0.5 unstack purple_block_1 grey_block_1 → holding purple.

0.6 stack grey_block_1 onto another block. For example, stack grey_block_1 on red_block_1.

But red is on the table. So:

0.6.1 putdown purple_block_1 (assuming we need to free the arm).

0.6.2 pickup grey_block_1 (now clear after unstacking purple).

0.6.3 stack grey_block_1 red_block_1.

Now, grey is on red, so not on the table. Satisfies constraint 8.

But this adds more steps. It's getting quite involved.

Alternative approach: Let's find a plan that satisfies all constraints with minimal steps.

Constraints that need action:

- Constraint 8: grey_block_1 not on table. So stack grey on another block.

- Constraint 9: blue_block_2 not clear. So stack something on it.

- Constraint 10: hold white_block_1.

Also:

- Constraint 1's implication: white_block_2 must be on table.

- Constraint 3's implication: red_block_1 must have something on top.

- Constraint 7: when white_block_2 is clear, prior state with grey not clear.

- Constraint 5's implication: purple on grey.

Let's try to combine these.

Step 1: Stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1 to satisfy constraint 5's implication. To do that, first unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1.

Actions:

1. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1

2. putdown red_block_1

3. pickup purple_block_1

4. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1 → now purple is on grey.

This satisfies constraint 5's implication.

Step 5: Now, need to make grey_block_1 not on table. Since grey is under purple, we can't pick it up unless we unstack purple. So:

5. unstack purple_block_1 grey_block_1

6. putdown purple_block_1

7. pickup grey_block_1

8. stack grey_block_1 red_block_1 → now grey is on red, not on table. Satisfies constraint 8.

Also, this makes red_block_1 not clear (grey is on top), satisfying constraint 3's implication.

Step 9: Now, need to make blue_block_2 not clear (constraint 9). Since blue_block_2 is currently on white_block_2, we can stack something on it. Let's use red_block_1.

But red is on the table (step 2). So:

9. pickup red_block_1

10. stack red_block_1 blue_block_2 → now blue_block_2 is not clear. This satisfies constraint 9. But then we need to unstack it later to move blue_block_2 to the table.

But this requires that before stacking red on blue_block_2, either red is not clear or we're holding white_block_2. Wait, constraint 9's implication says that if in some state, blue_block_2 is not clear (like after step 10), then there must be an earlier state where either red_block_1 is not clear or the arm is holding white_block_2.

In step 10, blue_block_2 is not clear. So we need an earlier state where either red is not clear or holding white_block_2. Let's see:

Before step 10, in step 8, grey is stacked on red, so red is not clear. So the earlier state (step 8) satisfies the condition for constraint 9's implication. So that's okay.

Step 11: Now, to unstack red_block_1 from blue_block_2:

11. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2 → holding red.

12. putdown red_block_1.

Now, blue_block_2 is clear again.

Step 13: Now, need to move blue_block_2 to the table. Unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2 (which is currently on blue_block_1).

But white_block_2 is part of the tower: white_block_1 → blue_block_1 → white_block_2 → blue_block_2. Wait, initially, blue_block_2 was on white_block_2, but after step 10 and 11, blue_block_2 is still on white_block_2. Wait no: step 10 stacked red on blue_block_2, which was on white_block_2. Then step 11 unstacked red from blue_block_2. So blue_block_2 is still on white_block_2. So to unstack blue_block_2:

13. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2 → holding blue_block_2.

14. putdown blue_block_2 → goal achieved.

Now, after step 13, white_block_2 is clear. According to constraint 7, this requires that before step 13, there's a state where grey_block_1 was not clear. Earlier steps: when we had purple on grey (step 4), then grey was not clear. That's before step 13. So constraint 7 is satisfied.

Constraint 10: must hold white_block_1. So after moving blue_block_2, we need to pick up white_block_1. But white_block_1 has blue_block_1 on top. So steps:

15. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1 → holding white_block_2.

16. putdown white_block_2.

17. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1 → holding blue_block_1.

18. putdown blue_block_1.

19. pickup white_block_1 → holding it. Satisfies constraint 10.

20. putdown white_block_1.

But this adds many steps. However, since the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible), this approach may not be optimal. Let's see if there's a way to combine steps.

Alternative plan:

Let's try to find a shorter sequence that satisfies all constraints.

1. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1 → holding red.

2. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1 → red on grey. This makes grey not clear (satisfies constraint 7's requirement for prior state when white_block_2 is clear later). Also, red is not on white_block_1, and now white_block_2 needs to be on table (constraint 1's implication). Also, grey is not on the table? No, grey is on the table with red on top. So constraint 8 is not satisfied yet.

But also, stacking red on grey would satisfy constraint 3's implication: since grey is not on white_block_1 (still true), and red is not clear (because something is on top? Wait, red is on grey, so grey has red on top. So red is clear (nothing on top), and grey is not clear. So red is clear. Hmm, not helpful for constraint 3's implication. Because constraint 3's implication requires that when grey is not on white_block_1 (which it isn't), red must be not clear. But after step 2, red is clear. So this doesn't help.

Alternative: stack grey on red. So:

1. pickup grey_block_1.

2. stack grey_block_1 red_block_1.

Now, grey is not on table (constraint 8). Red is not clear (satisfies constraint 3's implication). Also, we can then proceed to handle other constraints.

Then, to satisfy constraint 5's implication (purple on grey), but purple is on the table. So:

3. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1 (red is on grey, so this is not possible. Wait, red was on purple, but after step 2, grey is on red, which is on purple. Wait, no. Let's re-examine.

Wait, initial state:

purple_block_1 is on table with red_block_1 on top.

grey_block_1 is on table.

After step 1 and 2:

grey is picked up and stacked on red_block_1 (which is on purple_block_1). So grey is on red, which is on purple, which is on table. So purple is still on table. So constraint 5 requires that if blue_block_1 is not on table (which it is), then purple must be on grey. But purple is still on table. So that's not satisfied. So this approach won't work.

Alternative approach: Let's focus on the main goal and integrate the constraints.

Main goal: blue_block_2 on table.

Constraints:

Must hold white_block_1 at some point.

Must stack something on blue_block_2 (then unstack it).

Must stack purple on grey.

Must put white_block_2 on table.

Must put grey not on table.

Must have red not clear.

Must have grey not clear before white_block_2 is clear.

Let's try to do this:

First, unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2 and put it down. But before that, ensure that grey was not clear (stack something on grey).

Steps:

1. unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1 → hold red.

2. putdown red.

3. pickup purple.

4. stack purple on grey_block_1 → now grey has purple on top (not clear). This helps with constraint 7.

5. Now, unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2 → hold blue_block_2.

6. putdown blue_block_2 → goal achieved. Now white_block_2 is clear. This is okay because step 4 made grey not clear before.

Now, need to handle other constraints.

7. unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1 → hold white_block_2.

8. putdown white_block_2 → satisfies constraint 1's implication.

9. Now, need to hold white_block_1. So unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 → but blue_block_1 is under white_block_2. Wait, after step 7, white_block_2 is on blue_block_1. So after step 8, white_block_2 is on the table. So blue_block_1 is still on white_block_1. So:

9. unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 → requires that blue_block_1 is clear. Initially, blue_block_1 has white_block_2 on top. But after step 8, white_block_2 is on the table, so blue_block_1 is clear. So:

9. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1 → hold blue_block_1.

10. putdown blue_block_1.

11. pickup white_block_1 → now holding it, satisfies constraint 10.

12. putdown white_block_1.

Now, constraint 8: grey_block_1 is on table with purple on top. So grey is still on table. So need to move grey_block_1. But purple is on grey, so need to unstack purple first:

13. unstack purple_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold purple.

14. stack grey_block_1 somewhere, say on red_block_1:

14. pickup grey_block_1 → now possible since purple was removed.

15. stack grey_block_1 red_block_1 → grey is not on table. Satisfies constraint 8.

Now, constraint 9: blue_block_2 must have something on top. Currently, blue_block_2 is on table, clear. So stack something on it:

16. pickup red_block_1 (which is on table after step 2).

17. stack red_block_1 blue_block_2 → now blue_block_2 is not clear. Satisfies constraint 9. Then unstack it:

18. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2 → hold red.

19. putdown red_block_1.

But this adds steps. Also, when we stacked red on blue_block_2, the implication of constraint 9 requires that before, either red was not clear or holding white_block_2. At step 17, red was picked up from the table (clear), and white_block_2 was put down earlier. So before step 17, the arm was holding red. So the condition for constraint 9's implication is not satisfied unless during the plan, red was not clear before. For example, when grey was stacked on red (step 15), red was not clear. So step 15 happens before step 17, which satisfies the condition.

This seems to cover all constraints, but the plan is getting very long. However, the problem requires an optimal plan, which may not be possible with this approach. Let's see if there's a shorter way.

Alternative plan:

1. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2 → hold blue_block_2.

But before this, need to ensure grey was not clear. So:

1. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1 → hold red.

2. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1 → now grey has red, not clear.

3. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2 → hold blue_block_2.

4. putdown blue_block_2 → goal.

Now, white_block_2 is clear. Step 2 ensures grey was not clear before.

But this is only 4 steps. However, other constraints are not addressed.

Need to check all constraints:

- Constraint 1: red not on white_block_1 (true). White_block_2 must be on table. In this plan, white_block_2 is still on blue_block_1. So constraint 1's implication is not met.

- Constraint 3: grey not on white_block_1 (true). Need red not clear. After step 2, red is on grey, so red is clear? No, red is on grey. So red is on grey, which is on the table. So red is clear (nothing on top). So red is clear. So constraint 3's implication requires that after grey is not on white_block_1 (which is always true), red must not be clear. But here, red is clear. So this plan fails.

Thus, this approach is invalid.

Another approach:

Let's try to satisfy all constraints with minimal steps.

1. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1 → hold red.

2. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1 → red on grey. Now grey not clear, and red is clear.

But constraint 3's implication requires that when grey is not on white_block_1 (which is true), red must not be clear. But red is clear here. So this doesn't work. Thus, need to stack something on red.

3. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1 → hold white_block_2.

4. stack white_block_2 red_block_1 → white on red, red not clear.

Now, red is not clear. This satisfies constraint 3's implication.

5. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2 → hold blue_block_2.

6. putdown blue_block_2 → goal.

Now, constraint 1's implication requires white_block_2 to be on table. But white_block_2 is on red. So need to move it to table.

7. unstack white_block_2 red_block_1 → hold white_block_2.

8. putdown white_block_2.

Now, constraint 1's implication is satisfied.

Constraint 5's implication: blue_block_1 not on table (true), so purple must be on grey. But purple is on the table. So need to stack purple on grey.

9. unstack purple_block_1 (wait, purple_block_1 is on table with red on top. After step 2, red is on grey. So purple_block_1 is clear now. So:

9. pickup purple_block_1.

10. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1 → purple on grey.

Now, constraint 5's implication is satisfied.

Constraint 8: grey_block_1 must be not on table. But after step 10, grey is on table with purple on top. So need to move grey.

11. unstack purple_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold purple.

12. pickup grey_block_1 → now clear.

13. stack grey_block_1 somewhere, say on blue_block_1.

14. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_1 → now grey is not on table.

Constraint 8 is satisfied.

Constraint 9: blue_block_2 must have something on top. Current blue_block_2 is on table. So stack something on it.

15. pickup white_block_1 (needs to be clear. Blue_block_1 is under grey, white_block_1 is under blue_block_1. So white_block_1 has blue_block_1 and grey on top. Can't pick up. So this approach is stuck.

This is getting too complicated. Let's try to find a way to satisfy all constraints with the minimal steps.

Another possible plan:

1. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2 → hold blue_block_2.

2. stack blue_block_2 grey_block_1 → now blue_block_2 is on grey, not clear. This satisfies constraint 9 (blue_block_2 not clear), but now blue_block_2 is not on the table, so the goal is not achieved. So later, we need to move it to the table.

Also, when we stacked blue_block_2 on grey, we need to satisfy constraint 9's implication: before this, either red is not clear or holding white_block_2. Before step 2, the arm was holding blue_block_2, so not holding white_block_2. So need to have red not clear before step 2.

But initially, red is clear. So need to make red not clear before step 2.

3. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1 → hold red.

4. stack red_block_1 white_block_1 → red on white_block_1. Now, red is not on white_block_1 (no, stack red on white_block_1). Wait, the initial state has white_block_1 on the table with blue_block_1, etc. So stacking red on white_block_1 would require white_block_1 to be clear. But white_block_1 has blue_block_1 on it. So can't do that.

Alternative: stack red on purple_block_1 again. Not helpful.

Alternative: stack red on blue_block_1. But blue_block_1 is on white_block_1 and has white_block_2 on top. So unstack white_block_2 first.

This is getting too involved. Perhaps the optimal plan requires 20+ steps, but I need to find the shortest.

Let me try to outline a plan that covers all constraints step by step.

Steps:

1. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1 → holding red.

2. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1 → red on grey. Now, grey has red on top (not clear), and red is clear.

This addresses constraint 3's implication (red not clear? No, red is clear. So no. Need to stack something on red.

3. pickup white_block_2 (from blue_block_1, which is under white_block_2). Wait, white_block_2 is on blue_block_1. So unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1 → holding white_block_2.

4. stack white_block_2 red_block_1 → white on red. Now, red is not clear.

This satisfies constraint 3's implication.

5. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2 → holding blue_block_2.

6. putdown blue_block_2 → goal achieved.

Now, white_block_2 is clear (step 5). To satisfy constraint 7, we need a prior state where grey is not clear. Step 2 made grey not clear (red on grey), so that's good.

Now, constraint 1's implication requires white_block_2 to be on table. Currently, white_block_2 is on red. So need to move it.

7. unstack white_block_2 red_block_1 → holding white_block_2.

8. putdown white_block_2.

Now, white_block_2 is on table.

Constraint 5's implication: blue_block_1 is not on table (true), so purple must be on grey. Currently, purple is on table. So:

9. pickup purple_block_1.

10. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1 → purple on grey.

Now, purple is on grey, satisfying constraint 5's implication.

Constraint 8: grey must be not on table. Currently, grey is on table with purple on top. So need to move grey.

11. unstack purple_block_1 grey_block_1 → holding purple.

12. pickup grey_block_1.

13. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_1 → grey on blue_block_1, which is on white_block_1.

Now, grey is not on table.

Constraint 9: blue_block_2 must be not clear. Currently, blue_block_2 is on table. So:

14. pickup white_block_2.

15. stack white_block_2 blue_block_2 → white on blue_block_2.

Now, blue_block_2 is not clear. Satisfies constraint 9.

Constraint 9's implication: before step 15, either red is not clear or holding white_block_2. During step 14, we are holding white_block_2, so this condition is satisfied.

Constraint 10: must hold white_block_1. So:

16. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1 → holding grey.

17. putdown grey_block_1.

18. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1 → holding blue_block_1.

19. putdown blue_block_1.

20. pickup white_block_1 → holding it. Satisfies constraint 10.

21. putdown white_block_1.

This plan achieves the goal and satisfies all constraints but has many steps. Is there a shorter way?

Alternative steps that reorder actions to reduce steps:

For example, when stacking purple on grey (step 10), can we then move grey elsewhere in fewer steps.

But this seems challenging.

Another idea: When we stack red on grey (step 2), then later move grey onto another block, taking red with it. But this may not help.

Alternatively, stack purple on grey_block_1 first, then move grey_block_1 with purple on top to another block. But this requires unstacking.

But perhaps the minimal plan is around 20 steps. Given the complexity, perhaps this is the optimal plan. However, given the time constraints, I'll proceed to outline the key steps focusing on the necessary constraints.
