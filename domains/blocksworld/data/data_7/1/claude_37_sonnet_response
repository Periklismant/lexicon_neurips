Let's start by understanding the problem more fully.

We have the following state of the world:
- black_block_1 is on the table and clear
- red_block_1 is on the table with black_block_2 on top of it
- black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1 with green_block_1 on top of it
- green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2 and clear
- orange_block_1 is on the table with brown_block_1 on top of it
- brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 with green_block_2 on top of it
- green_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1 and clear
- The robotic arm is not holding any block

So we have three stacks of blocks:
1. black_block_1 (on the table, clear)
2. red_block_1 (on the table) < black_block_2 < green_block_1 (clear)
3. orange_block_1 (on the table) < brown_block_1 < green_block_2 (clear)

Our goal is:
- red_block_1 is clear

This means we need to remove black_block_2, which requires also removing green_block_1 from the top.

Now, let's consider the constraints which we need to satisfy during our plan:

1. "you are holding black_block_2" must be true in at least one state.
2. If "you are holding black_block_2" is true, then earlier either "green_block_2 is not clear" or "you are holding orange_block_1" must have been true.
3. Either "black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2" or "red_block_1 is not on the table" must be true in at least one state.
4. "green_block_1 is not on the table" must be true in every state.
5. Either "orange_block_1 is not on the table" or "green_block_1 is on top of red_block_1" must be true in at least one state.
6. Both "black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1" and "green_block_2 is on the table" must be true in the same state at least once.
7. "you are holding red_block_1" must be true in at least one state.
8. "orange_block_1 is not clear" must be true in at least one state.
9. If "orange_block_1 is not clear" is true in some state, then later either "black_block_1 is not clear" or "green_block_2 is not clear" must be true.

Let's think about how to achieve our goal while satisfying these constraints.

First, I need to remove green_block_1 from black_block_2. Then, I need to remove black_block_2 from red_block_1. And along the way, I need to satisfy all the constraints.

Let's start planning:

1. First, I need to unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2.
2. Once I'm holding green_block_1, I can't put it on the table (due to constraint 4), so I need to stack it on something else. Maybe on black_block_1, orange_block_1, or green_block_2.
3. After that, I can unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1, which fulfills constraint 1 as I'll be holding black_block_2.
4. But to satisfy constraint 2, I first need either "green_block_2 is not clear" or "you are holding orange_block_1". If I stack green_block_1 on green_block_2, it will make green_block_2 not clear.
5. To satisfy constraint 3, I need to either stack black_block_2 on green_block_2 or move red_block_1 (to make it not on the table).
6. To satisfy constraint 6, I need to have black_block_2 on top of black_block_1, and green_block_2 on the table.
7. To satisfy constraint 7, I need to pick up red_block_1 at some point.
8. To satisfy constraint 8, something needs to be on top of orange_block_1. It already starts with brown_block_1 on top, so this is satisfied initially.
9. Due to constraint 9, once constraint 8 is satisfied, I need to have either black_block_1 not clear or green_block_2 not clear.

Based on the original state:
- "black_block_1 is on the table and clear"
- "red_block_1 is on the table" with black_block_2 on top
- "black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1" with green_block_1 on top
- "green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2 and clear"
- "orange_block_1 is on the table" with brown_block_1 on top
- "brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1" with green_block_2 on top
- "green_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1 and clear"

Actually, constraint 8 is satisfied in the initial state, as there is a block on top of orange_block_1. Now, I need to satisfy constraint 9, which means we need either black_block_1 or green_block_2 to have something on top of them.

Let's take another look at the constraints and think about how to satisfy them. Actually, let's think about what to do with green_block_1 after I unstack it, since I can't put it on the table.

Given constraint 5, either "orange_block_1 is not on the table" or "green_block_1 is on top of red_block_1" must be true in at least one state. If I can satisfy the second part, by placing green_block_1 on top of red_block_1 at some point, that would be good. But to do that, red_block_1 needs to be clear first, which doesn't match the initial state. 

Constraint 6 says: Both "black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1" and "green_block_2 is on the table" must be true in the same state at least once. This means I need to rearrange the blocks to a specific configuration.

I think I'll need to:
1. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2.
2. Stack green_block_1 on either black_block_1 or another clear block to satisfy constraint 9.
3. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1 (satisfying constraint 1).
4. Before doing step 3, to satisfy constraint 2, I need to ensure that either green_block_2 is not clear or I'm holding orange_block_1.
5. Stack black_block_2 on black_block_1 and ensure green_block_2 is on the table to satisfy constraint 6.
6. Somewhere in the plan, I need to pick up red_block_1 to satisfy constraint 7.

Let's draft a plan:

1. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
2. stack green_block_1 black_block_1 (this satisfies constraint 9 by making black_block_1 not clear)
3. unstack green_block_2 brown_block_1
4. putdown green_block_2 (it's on the table now)
5. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
   - Let me check: Is constraint 9 satisfied? Yes, black_block_1 is not clear due to green_block_1 being on it.
6. stack brown_block_1 green_block_2 (this makes green_block_2 not clear, satisfying the requirement for constraint 2)
7. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1 (this satisfies constraint 1 as I'm holding black_block_2, and the precondition for 2 is also met)
8. stack black_block_2 black_block_1 (This satisfies part of constraint 6. green_block_2 is already on the table, so this fully satisfies constraint 6)
9. pickup red_block_1 (this satisfies constraint 7)
10. putdown red_block_1 (since our goal is to have red_block_1 clear)

Let's review this plan against the constraints:

1. Constraint 1: "you are holding black_block_2" must be true in at least one state.
   - Satisfied by step 7.

2. Constraint 2: If "you are holding black_block_2" is true, then earlier either "green_block_2 is not clear" or "you are holding orange_block_1" must have been true.
   - Satisfied by step 6 making green_block_2 not clear before I hold black_block_2 in step 7.

3. Constraint 3: Either "black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2" or "red_block_1 is not on the table" must be true in at least one state.
   - I haven't addressed this. Let me adjust the plan. I could stack black_block_2 on green_block_2 instead of black_block_1, but that would conflict with constraint 6. Alternatively, I could pick up red_block_1 and hold it to make it not on the table.

4. Constraint 4: "green_block_1 is not on the table" must be true in every state.
   - Satisfied as green_block_1 is always on some other block.

5. Constraint 5: Either "orange_block_1 is not on the table" or "green_block_1 is on top of red_block_1" must be true in at least one state.
   - This isn't addressed yet. I need to adjust the plan.

6. Constraint 6: Both "black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1" and "green_block_2 is on the table" must be true in the same state at least once.
   - Satisfied by steps 4 and 8.

7. Constraint 7: "you are holding red_block_1" must be true in at least one state.
   - Satisfied by step 9.

8. Constraint 8: "orange_block_1 is not clear" must be true in at least one state.
   - Satisfied in the initial state, as brown_block_1 is on top of it.

9. Constraint 9: If "orange_block_1 is not clear" is true in some state, then later either "black_block_1 is not clear" or "green_block_2 is not clear" must be true.
   - Satisfied by step 2 making black_block_1 not clear.

Wait, I missed constraint 3 and 5. Let me adjust the plan:

For constraint 3, I need either "black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2" or "red_block_1 is not on the table". For constraint 5, I need either "orange_block_1 is not on the table" or "green_block_1 is on top of red_block_1".

Let's refine the plan:

1. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
2. unstack green_block_2 brown_block_1
3. putdown green_block_2 (it's on the table now)
4. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
5. stack brown_block_1 green_block_2 (this makes green_block_2 not clear, satisfying the requirement for constraint 2)
6. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1 (this satisfies constraint 1 as I'm holding black_block_2, and the precondition for 2 is also met)
7. stack black_block_2 black_block_1 (This, along with green_block_2 being on the table, satisfies constraint 6)
8. stack green_block_1 red_block_1 (this satisfies constraint 5)
9. pickup orange_block_1 (making it not on the table also satisfies constraint 5)
10. putdown orange_block_1
11. pickup red_block_1 (this satisfies constraint 7)
12. stack red_block_1 green_block_2 (this makes red_block_1 not on the table, satisfying constraint 3)
13. unstack red_block_1 green_block_2
14. putdown red_block_1 (goal satisfied, red_block_1 is clear)

Wait, I think I'm missing something here. Let's re-focus on the goal and ensure the plan is coherent.

Goal: "red_block_1 is clear"

Current states of the blocks:
- "black_block_1 is on the table" and clear
- "red_block_1 is on the table" with black_block_2 on top
- "black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1" with green_block_1 on top
- "green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2" and clear
- "orange_block_1 is on the table" with brown_block_1 on top
- "brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1" with green_block_2 on top
- "green_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1" and clear

I notice constraints 8 and 9 have a special relationship. Constraint 8 requires that orange_block_1 is not clear in at least one state, which is satisfied in the initial state. Constraint 9 then says that after orange_block_1 is not clear, either black_block_1 or green_block_2 must not be clear. In the initial state, orange_block_1 is not clear, and both black_block_1 and green_block_2 are clear. So, to satisfy constraint 9, I need to make either black_block_1 or green_block_2 not clear at some point after the initial state.

Let's re-analyze the constraints and refine the plan:

For constraint 3, I need to ensure that at some point, either black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2 or red_block_1 is not on the table.

For constraint 5, I need to ensure that at some point, either orange_block_1 is not on the table or green_block_1 is on top of red_block_1.

For constraint 6, I need to ensure that at some point, both black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 and green_block_2 is on the table.

For constraint 9, I need to ensure that after orange_block_1 is not clear (which is in the initial state), either black_block_1 or green_block_2 is not clear.

Let's review the plan again. Here's the current state:
We have three stacks of blocks:
1. black_block_1 (on the table, clear)
2. red_block_1 (on the table) < black_block_2 < green_block_1 (clear)
3. orange_block_1 (on the table) < brown_block_1 < green_block_2 (clear)

Let's simplify it to be more linear:

Let's think through this step by step:

1. I need to remove green_block_1 from black_block_2 to get to my goal:
   `unstack green_block_1 black_block_2`
   
2. I can't put green_block_1 on the table (constraint 4), so I need to stack it on something. Let's say I stack it on black_block_1:
   `stack green_block_1 black_block_1`
   
   This also satisfies constraint 9 because now black_block_1 is not clear, and this is after the initial state where orange_block_1 is not clear.

3. Now I need to unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1:
   `unstack black_block_2 red_block_1`
   
   This satisfies constraint 1 because now I'm holding black_block_2.

4. But before this, according to constraint 2, I need to ensure that earlier either "green_block_2 is not clear" or "you are holding orange_block_1" is true. Let's handle that by first unstacking green_block_2 and putting something on it:
   `unstack green_block_2 brown_block_1`
   `putdown green_block_2`
   
   At this point, I would need to put something on green_block_2 to make it not clear.

5. Let's unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1:
   `unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1`
   
6. And then stack brown_block_1 on green_block_2:
   `stack brown_block_1 green_block_2`
   
   Now green_block_2 is not clear, satisfying the condition for constraint 2.

7. Now, I can unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1:
   `unstack black_block_2 red_block_1`
   
   As I mentioned, this satisfies constraint 1 because now I'm holding black_block_2, and the precondition for constraint 2 is met.

8. To satisfy constraint 6, I need to ensure that at some point both "black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1" and "green_block_2 is on the table" are true. green_block_2 is already on the table, but black_block_2 is not on top of black_block_1. Let's stack black_block_2 on black_block_1.

   Hmm, but that's not possible because black_block_1 has green_block_1 on it. I need to adjust the plan.

9. Let's continue from step 6. After I stack brown_block_1 on green_block_2:
   I need to unstack green_block_1 from black_block_1 (which is where I had placed it in step 2):
   `unstack green_block_1 black_block_1`
   
10. Now I can unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1:
    `unstack black_block_2 red_block_1`
    
    This satisfies constraint 1 as I'm holding black_block_2, and the precondition for constraint 2 is met.

11. Now I can stack black_block_2 on black_block_1:
    `stack black_block_2 black_block_1`
    
    This, along with green_block_2 being on the table, satisfies constraint 6.

12. Now, I need to ensure that at some point either "black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2" or "red_block_1 is not on the table" (constraint 3). I'll pick up red_block_1:
    `pickup red_block_1`
    
    This satisfies constraint 3 as red_block_1 is not on the table, and also fulfills constraint 7 as I'm holding red_block_1.

13. For constraint 5, I need to ensure that at some point either "orange_block_1 is not on the table" or "green_block_1 is on top of red_block_1". I can satisfy this by stacking green_block_1 on red_block_1, but first, I need to put down red_block_1:
    `putdown red_block_1`
    
14. Then I can stack green_block_1 on red_block_1:
    `stack green_block_1 red_block_1`
    
    This satisfies constraint 5.

15. But this creates a situation where red_block_1 is not clear, which is contrary to my goal. I need to remove green_block_1:
    `unstack green_block_1 red_block_1`
    
16. I need to stack green_block_1 somewhere else, but it can't be on the table (constraint 4). I'll stack it on black_block_2:
    `stack green_block_1 black_block_2`
    
17. Now, red_block_1 is clear, which is my goal.

Wait, let me check through it quickly: 
Constraint 1: satisfied by step 10 when I hold black_block_2.
Constraint 2: satisfied because green_block_2 is not clear before step 10, due to step 6.
Constraint 3: satisfied by step 12 when red_block_1 is not on the table.
Constraint 4: green_block_1 is never on the table, always on a block.
Constraint 5: satisfied by step 14 when green_block_1 is on top of red_block_1.
Constraint 6: satisfied by step 11 and the fact that green_block_2 is on the table.
Constraint 7: satisfied by step 12 when I'm holding red_block_1.
Constraint 8: satisfied in the initial state as orange_block_1 is not clear.
Constraint 9: satisfied by step 2 when black_block_1 becomes not clear, which is after the initial state where orange_block_1 is not clear.

Actually, I'm noticing an error in my plan. I unstack black_block_2 (step 10) before unstacking green_block_1 (step 9) when green_block_1 is on black_block_2 in the initial state. Let me fix the plan.

Let me rethink the whole plan from scratch to ensure it's comprehensive and correct.

Initial state:
- black_block_1 (on the table, clear)
- red_block_1 (on the table) < black_block_2 < green_block_1 (clear)
- orange_block_1 (on the table) < brown_block_1 < green_block_2 (clear)

Goal: red_block_1 is clear

1. `unstack green_block_1 black_block_2` (I need to remove green_block_1 to get to black_block_2)
2. `unstack green_block_2 brown_block_1` (I need to move green_block_2 to prepare for later, and also to satisfy constraint 6 which requires green_block_2 to be on the table)
3. `putdown green_block_2` (Now, green_block_2 is on the table)

Now, let's make sure I have a clear block to place green_block_1 on, since I can't put it on the table (constraint 4).
4. `stack green_block_1 black_block_1` (This satisfies constraint 9 because now black_block_1 is not clear)

5. `unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1` (Preparing to make green_block_2 not clear to satisfy constraint 2)
6. `stack brown_block_1 green_block_2` (Now, green_block_2 is not clear, which is a prerequisite for constraint 2)

7. `unstack black_block_2 red_block_1` (This satisfies constraint 1, and the precondition for constraint 2 is met due to step 6)

Now, I need to satisfy constraint 6, which requires both "black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1" and "green_block_2 is on the table" to be true in the same state.
8. `unstack green_block_1 black_block_1` (I need to clear black_block_1 first)
9. `stack black_block_2 black_block_1` (Now, constraint 6 is satisfied, as black_block_2 is on black_block_1 and green_block_2 is on the table)

10. `pickup red_block_1` (This satisfies constraint 7 and also prepares for constraint 5)
11. `stack red_block_1 brown_block_1` (Placing red_block_1 somewhere to satisfy constraint 3)
12. `stack green_block_1 red_block_1` (This satisfies constraint 5 as green_block_1 is on top of red_block_1)
13. `unstack green_block_1 red_block_1` (Removing it to achieve the goal)
14. `unstack red_block_1 brown_block_1` (Getting red_block_1 back)
15. `putdown red_block_1` (Now, red_block_1 is on the table and clear, fulfilling the goal)

Hmm, in the last three steps I can simplify:
13. `unstack green_block_1 red_block_1` (Removing it to achieve the goal)
14. `stack green_block_1 black_block_2` (Moving it to another block since I can't put it on the table due to constraint 4)

With this, red_block_1 is clear and on the table, which is the goal.

Wait, in my initial state, I had green_block_1 on top of black_block_2, which was on top of red_block_1. I'm not sure if the above plan makes sense. Let me revise again, given the initial state.

Initial state (again, to be sure):
- black_block_1 is on the table and clear
- red_block_1 is on the table with black_block_2 on top
- black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1 with green_block_1 on top
- green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2 and clear
- orange_block_1 is on the table with brown_block_1 on top
- brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 with green_block_2 on top
- green_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1 and clear
- The robotic arm is not holding any block

1. `unstack green_block_1 black_block_2` (Removing green_block_1 to get to black_block_2)
2. `stack green_block_1 black_block_1` (Placing green_block_1 on black_block_1, which fulfills constraint 9 as black_block_1 is now not clear)
3. `unstack green_block_2 brown_block_1` (Preparing to satisfy constraint 6 by getting green_block_2 onto the table)
4. `putdown green_block_2` (Now, green_block_2 is on the table)
5. `unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1` (Preparing to make green_block_2 not clear, which is a prerequisite for constraint 2)
6. `stack brown_block_1 green_block_2` (Now, green_block_2 is not clear, satisfying the requirement for constraint 2)
7. `unstack black_block_2 red_block_1` (This satisfies constraint 1, and the precondition for 2 is met due to step 6)
   - At this point, I have black_block_2 in my hand, and my goal is to have red_block_1 clear, which is already satisfied. But I still need to satisfy all constraints.
8. `stack black_block_2 orange_block_1` (Placing black_block_2 somewhere to continue with the plan)
9. `pickup red_block_1` (This satisfies constraint 7 and also constraint 3 as red_block_1 is not on the table)
10. `putdown red_block_1` (Placing red_block_1 back on the table to satisfy constraint 5 in the next step)
11. `unstack green_block_1 black_block_1` (Preparing to place green_block_1 on red_block_1 to satisfy constraint 5)
12. `stack green_block_1 red_block_1` (This satisfies constraint 5 as green_block_1 is on top of red_block_1)
13. `unstack green_block_1 red_block_1` (Removing it to achieve the goal)
14. `stack green_block_1 black_block_1` (Moving it to another block since I can't put it on the table due to constraint 4)
15. `unstack black_block_2 orange_block_1` (Preparing to satisfy constraint 6)
16. `stack black_block_2 black_block_1` (Now, black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1, satisfying constraint 6 with the fact that green_block_2 is on the table)

Wait, this doesn't work. In step 14, I stack green_block_1 on black_block_1, but then in step 16 I try to stack black_block_2 on black_block_1, which is not possible since black_block_1 is not clear due to green_block_1 being on it.

Let's try one more time from the beginning.

Initial state:
- black_block_1 is on the table and clear
- red_block_1 is on the table with black_block_2 on top
- black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1 with green_block_1 on top
- green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2 and clear
- orange_block_1 is on the table with brown_block_1 on top
- brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 with green_block_2 on top
- green_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1 and clear
- The robotic arm is not holding any block

I need to have red_block_1 clear, which means I need to remove black_block_2 (and consequently green_block_1 on top of it) from red_block_1.

1. `unstack green_block_1 black_block_2` (Remove green_block_1 to get to black_block_2)
2. `stack green_block_1 black_block_1` (Place green_block_1 on black_block_1, satisfying constraint 9)
3. `unstack green_block_2 brown_block_1` (Preparing to satisfy constraint 6 by getting green_block_2 onto the table)
4. `putdown green_block_2` (green_block_2 is now on the table)
5. `unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1` (Preparing to make green_block_2 not clear for constraint 2)
6. `stack brown_block_1 green_block_2` (Now, green_block_2 is not clear, which is a prerequisite for constraint 2)
7. `pickup orange_block_1` (Preparing to satisfy constraint 5)
8. `putdown orange_block_1` (Placed it back. This step wasn't strictly necessary, but I added it for clarity)
9. `unstack black_block_2 red_block_1` (This satisfies constraint 1, and the precondition for 2 is met due to step 6)
   - At this point, I have black_block_2 in my hand, and my goal is to have red_block_1 clear, which is already satisfied.
10. `stack black_block_2 orange_block_1` (Placing black_block_2 somewhere to continue with the plan)
11. `pickup red_block_1` (This satisfies constraint 7 and also constraint 3 as red_block_1 is not on the table)
12. `putdown red_block_1` (Placing red_block_1 back on the table)
13. `unstack green_block_1 black_block_1` (Preparing to place green_block_1 on red_block_1 for constraint 5)
14. `stack green_block_1 red_block_1` (This satisfies constraint 5 as green_block_1 is on top of red_block_1)
15. `unstack green_block_1 red_block_1` (Removing it to achieve the goal)
16. `stack green_block_1 orange_block_1` (Moving it somewhere else, since it can't be on the table due to constraint 4)
17. `unstack black_block_2 orange_block_1` (Preparing to satisfy constraint 6)
18. `stack black_block_2 black_block_1` (Now, black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1, satisfying constraint 6 along with green_block_2 being on the table)

Wait, a potential issue: I placed green_block_1 on orange_block_1 in step 16, then try to unstack black_block_2 from orange_block_1 in step 17. This is incorrect if green_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 because orange_block_1 would not be clear. Let me fix this.

I'm going to revise the plan once more from scratch. Let me think in a more strategic way.

I need to satisfy constraint 6, which requires both "black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1" and "green_block_2 is on the table" to be true in the same state. This seems like a key configuration to aim for. Let's work towards it.

I've been making this too complicated. Let's simplify:

Initial state:
- black_block_1 is on the table and clear
- red_block_1 is on the table with black_block_2 on top
- black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1 with green_block_1 on top
- green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2 and clear
- orange_block_1 is on the table with brown_block_1 on top
- brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 with green_block_2 on top
- green_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1 and clear
- The robotic arm is not holding any block

Plan:
1. `unstack green_block_1 black_block_2` (Removing green_block_1 to get to black_block_2)
2. `stack green_block_1 black_block_1` (Placing green_block_1 on black_block_1, which satisfies constraint 9 by making black_block_1 not clear)
3. `unstack green_block_2 brown_block_1` (Moving green_block_2 to eventually get it on the table for constraint 6)
4. `putdown green_block_2` (green_block_2 is now on the table)
5. `unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1` (Preparing to make green_block_2 not clear for constraint 2)
6. `stack brown_block_1 green_block_2` (Now, green_block_2 is not clear, which satisfies the prerequisite for constraint 2)
7. `unstack black_block_2 red_block_1` (This satisfies constraint 1, and the precondition for 2 is met due to step 6)
8. `unstack green_block_1 black_block_1` (Preparing to place black_block_2 on black_block_1 for constraint 6)
9. `stack black_block_2 black_block_1` (This, along with green_block_2 being on the table, satisfies constraint 6)
10. `pickup red_block_1` (This satisfies constraint 7 and also constraint 3 as red_block_1 is not on the table)
11. `putdown red_block_1` (Placing red_block_1 back on the table)
12. `stack green_block_1 red_block_1` (This satisfies constraint 5 as green_block_1 is on top of red_block_1)
13. `unstack green_block_1 red_block_1` (Removing it to achieve the goal, which is to have red_block_1 clear)
14. `stack green_block_1 orange_block_1` (Ensuring green_block_1 is not on the table, satisfying constraint 4)

Let me check if this covers all constraints:
1. "you are holding black_block_2" must be true in at least one state: Satisfied by step 7.
2. If "you are holding black_block_2" is true, then earlier either "green_block_2 is not clear" or "you are holding orange_block_1" must have been true: Satisfied by step 6.
3. Either "black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2" or "red_block_1 is not on the table" must be true in at least one state: Satisfied by step 10.
4. "green_block_1 is not on the table" must be true in every state: Satisfied throughout the plan.
5. Either "orange_block_1 is not on the table" or "green_block_1 is on top of red_block_1" must be true in at least one state: Satisfied by step 12.
6. Both "black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1" and "green_block_2 is on the table" must be true in the same state at least once: Satisfied by step 9.
7. "you are holding red_block_1" must be true in at least one state: Satisfied by step 10.
8. "orange_block_1 is not clear" must be true in at least one state: Satisfied in the initial state.
9. If "orange_block_1 is not clear" is true in some state, then later either "black_block_1 is not clear" or "green_block_2 is not clear" must be true: Satisfied by step 2 (and also step 6).

This plan seems to satisfy all constraints. Let's double-check the plan from scratch, particularly focusing on the pre-conditions for each action:

1. `unstack green_block_1 black_block_2` 
   - Pre-conditions: green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2, green_block_1 is clear, not holding any block
   - Satisfied in the initial state

2. `stack green_block_1 black_block_1` 
   - Pre-conditions: holding green_block_1, black_block_1 is clear
   - Satisfied after step 1

3. `unstack green_block_2 brown_block_1` 
   - Pre-conditions: green_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1, green_block_2 is clear, not holding any block
   - Satisfied after step 2

4. `putdown green_block_2` 
   - Pre-conditions: holding green_block_2
   - Satisfied after step 3

5. `unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1` 
   - Pre-conditions: brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear, not holding any block
   - Satisfied after step 4

6. `stack brown_block_1 green_block_2` 
   - Pre-conditions: holding brown_block_1, green_block_2 is clear
   - Satisfied after step 5

7. `unstack black_block_2 red_block_1` 
   - Pre-conditions: black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1, black_block_2 is clear, not holding any block
   - Satisfied after step 6

8. `unstack green_block_1 black_block_1` 
   - Pre-conditions: green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, green_block_1 is clear, not holding any block
   - Wait, not satisfied after step 7. I'm holding black_block_2. I need to place it somewhere first.

Okay, I need to adjust the plan:

Updated Plan:
1. `unstack green_block_1 black_block_2` (Removing green_block_1 to get to black_block_2)
2. `stack green_block_1 black_block_1` (Placing green_block_1 on black_block_1, which satisfies constraint 9 by making black_block_1 not clear)
3. `unstack green_block_2 brown_block_1` (Moving green_block_2 to eventually get it on the table for constraint 6)
4. `putdown green_block_2` (green_block_2 is now on the table)
5. `unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1` (Preparing to make green_block_2 not clear for constraint 2)
6. `stack brown_block_1 green_block_2` (Now, green_block_2 is not clear, which satisfies the prerequisite for constraint 2)
7. `unstack black_block_2 red_block_1` (This satisfies constraint 1, and the precondition for 2 is met due to step 6)
8. `putdown black_block_2` (Placing black_block_2 on the table for now)
9. `unstack green_block_1 black_block_1` (Preparing black_block_1 for constraint 6)
10. `stack green_block_1 red_block_1` (This satisfies constraint 5 as green_block_1 is on top of red_block_1)
11. `pickup black_block_2` (Preparing to satisfy constraint 6)
12. `stack black_block_2 black_block_1` (This, along with green_block_2 being on the table, satisfies constraint 6)
13. `unstack green_block_1 red_block_1` (Removing it to achieve the goal, which is to have red_block_1 clear)
14. `stack green_block_1 orange_block_1` (Ensuring green_block_1 is not on the table, satisfying constraint 4)
15. `pickup red_block_1` (This satisfies constraint 7 and also constraint 3 as red_block_1 is not on the table)
16. `putdown red_block_1` (Placing red_block_1 back on the table, completing the plan)

Hmm, stack green_block_1 on orange_block_1 is only possible if orange_block_1 is clear. Let me verify if orange_block_1 is clear after step 13:

- Initially, brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1.
- In step 5, I unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1, making it clear.
- Nothing else has been stacked on orange_block_1 since then, so it should be clear after step 13.

Let me check if this covers all constraints again:
1. "you are holding black_block_2" must be true in at least one state: Satisfied by steps 7 and 11.
2. If "you are holding black_block_2" is true, then earlier either "green_block_2 is not clear" or "you are holding orange_block_1" must have been true: Satisfied by step 6.
3. Either "black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2" or "red_block_1 is not on the table" must be true in at least one state: Satisfied by step 15.
4. "green_block_1 is not on the table" must be true in every state: Satisfied throughout the plan.
5. Either "orange_block_1 is not on the table" or "green_block_1 is on top of red_block_1" must be true in at least one state: Satisfied by step 10.
6. Both "black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1" and "green_block_2 is on the table" must be true in the same state at least once: Satisfied by step 12.
7. "you are holding red_block_1" must be true in at least one state: Satisfied by step 15.
8. "orange_block_1 is not clear" must be true in at least one state: Satisfied in the initial state.
9. If "orange_block_1 is not clear" is true in some state, then later either "black_block_1 is not clear" or "green_block_2 is not clear" must be true: Satisfied by step 2 (and also step 6).

Yep, all constraints are satisfied. And the goal of having red_block_1 clear is achieved by the end of step 13, though red_block_1 would still be clear after step 16 (the last step).

Let's double-check all the action pre-conditions again:

1. `unstack green_block_1 black_block_2`

14. `stack green_block_1 orange_block_1` 
    - Pre-conditions: holding green_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear
    - Satisfied after step 13, orange_block_1 is clear because I unstacked brown_block_1 from it in step 5

15. `pickup red_block_1` 
    - Pre-conditions: red_block_1 is on the table, red_block_1 is clear, not holding any block
    - Satisfied after step 14

16. `putdown red_block_1` 
    - Pre-conditions: holding red_block_1
    - Satisfied after step 15

All the pre-conditions check out! The plan should be valid and satisfy all constraints.
