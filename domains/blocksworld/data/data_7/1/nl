Blocksworld consists of a table and a set of blocks, where each block may be placed directly on the table or on top of another block. All blocks have the same size and there is no limit on the height of a tower of blocks or on the number of blocks on the table. You are a robotic arm that can hold at most one block at a time.

The available actions are the following:
	"pickup x": Pick up block x from the table.
	"putdown x": Place block x on the table.
	"stack x y": Place block x on top of block y.
	"unstack x y": Pick up block x from the top of block y.

An action may only be performed if its preconditions are met.
The actions of this domain have the following preconditions:
	"pickup": You may only perform this action on a block b if: (i) there is no block on top of b, i.e., block b is "clear", (ii) b is placed on the table, and (iii) you are currently not holding any block.
	"putdown": You may only perform this action on a block b if you are currently holding block b.
	"stack": You may only perform this action on some blocks b1 and b2 if (i) you are currently holding block b1, and (ii) block b2 does not have any block on top of it, i.e., b2 is "clear".
	"unstack": You may only perform this action on some blocks b1 and b2 if (i) block b1 is on top of block b2 (ii) block b1 does not have any block on top of it, i.e., b1 is "clear", and (iii) you are not currently holding any block.

The effects of an action are brought about after the action is performed.
An effect may be conditional, in the sense that it manifests only if some conditions hold.
 The actions of this domain have the following effects:
	"pickup": After performing this action on a block b, (i) you are holding b and (ii) b is no longer on the table.
	"putdown": After performing this action on a block b, (i) b is on the table, (ii) there is no block on top of b, i.e., b is "clear", and (iii) you are no longer holding b, or any other block.
	"stack": After performing this action on some blocks b1 and b2, (i) b1 is on top of b2, (ii) b1 is "clear", (iii) b2 is no longer "clear" and (iv) you are no longer holding b1, or any other block.
	"unstack": After performing this action on some blocks b1 and b2, (i) b1 is not longer on top of b2, (ii) b2 is "clear", and (iii) you are holding b1.

The world includes the following objects:
	"Block black_block_1"
	"Block red_block_1"
	"Block black_block_2"
	"Block orange_block_1"
	"Block green_block_1"
	"Block brown_block_1"
	"Block green_block_2"

The original state of the world is the following:
	"black_block_1 is on the table"
	"red_block_1 is on the table"
	"black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1"
	"orange_block_1 is on the table"
	"green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2"
	"brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1"
	"green_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1"
	"there is no block on top of black_block_1, i.e., black_block_1 is clear"
	"there is no block on top of green_block_1, i.e., green_block_1 is clear"
	"there is no block on top of green_block_2, i.e., green_block_2 is clear"
	"you are not holding any block"

The task is to bring about the following situation:
	"there is no block on top of red_block_1, i.e., red_block_1 is clear"

A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:
	"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 
		"you are holding black_block_2""
	"If expression 
		"you are holding black_block_2"
		holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 
		"At least one of the following conditions is true: "there is a block on top of green_block_2, i.e., green_block_2 is not clear", "you are holding orange_block_1"""
	"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 
		"At least one of the following conditions is true: "black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2", "red_block_1 is not on the table"""
	"The following expression must hold in every state: 
		"green_block_1 is not on the table""
	"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 
		"At least one of the following conditions is true: "orange_block_1 is not on the table", "green_block_1 is on top of red_block_1"""
	"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 
		"The following conditions are all true: "black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1", "green_block_2 is on the table"""
	"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 
		"you are holding red_block_1""
	"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 
		"there is a block on top of orange_block_1, i.e., orange_block_1 is not clear""
	"If expression 
		"there is a block on top of orange_block_1, i.e., orange_block_1 is not clear"
		holds in some state s, then expression
		"At least one of the following conditions is true: "there is a block on top of black_block_1, i.e., black_block_1 is not clear", "there is a block on top of green_block_2, i.e., green_block_2 is not clear""
		must hold at s or at some state after s"
