Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to make sure that red_block_1 is clear. Looking at the initial state, red_block_1 has black_block_2 on top of it. So, to clear red_block_1, we need to remove black_block_2 from it. But there are a bunch of constraints we have to satisfy along the way. Let's break them down.

First, the constraints:

1. Must hold black_block_2 at some point. And when we do, there must have been a previous state where either green_block_2 has a block on top or we were holding orange_block_1.
2. At some state, either black_block_2 is on green_block_2 or red_block_1 isn't on the table. But red_block_1 starts on the table; to make it not on the table, we'd have to pick it up. But the goal is to clear red_block_1, not necessarily move it. Hmm, maybe the first part of that condition is easier.
3. Green_block_1 must never be on the table in any state. Since initially, green_block_1 is on black_block_2, we need to ensure that whenever we move it, we don't put it on the table. So any putdown of green_block_1 is forbidden. We can only stack it somewhere else.
4. At some state, either orange_block_1 isn't on the table or green_block_1 is on red_block_1. Orange_block_1 starts with brown_block_1 on top, but brown_block_1 is under green_block_2. So initially, orange_block_1 has brown_block_1, which has green_block_2. So orange_block_1 isn't clear. But if we move those blocks, maybe orange_block_1 could be on the table again. Wait, no, the initial state says brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1, and green_block_2 is on brown_block_1. So orange_block_1 has a tower: orange_block_1, brown_block_1, green_block_2. So initially, orange_block_1 isn't clear. But after unstacking, maybe we can have orange_block_1 clear again? Not sure. But the constraint is that in at least one state, either orange_block_1 is not on the table (but it is on the table initially) or green_block_1 is on red_block_1. Since green_block_1 is on black_block_2, which is on red_block_1. So moving green_block_1 to red_block_1 would require moving it. But that might not be necessary for the main goal. So maybe we need to arrange that at some point.

5. At some state, both black_block_2 is on black_block_1 and green_block_2 is on the table. So we need to stack black_block_2 onto black_block_1 and put green_block_2 on the table. Currently, green_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1, which is on orange_block_1. To get green_block_2 on the table, we'd need to unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1, then put it down. But that requires first unstacking it.

6. Must hold red_block_1 at some point. So we need to pick up red_block_1, but red_block_1 is on the table initially. Wait, but the initial state says red_block_1 is on the table. To pick it up, it needs to be clear. But initially, black_block_2 is on red_block_1. So we can't pick up red_block_1 until we remove black_block_2. But once we remove black_block_2, red_block_1 becomes clear. So after moving black_block_2, we can pickup red_block_1. But why would we need to do that? The goal is just to have red_block_1 clear, so maybe that's a constraint. So the plan must include picking up red_block_1 at some point.

7. At some state, orange_block_1 is not clear (has a block on top). Well, initially, brown_block_1 is on orange_block_1, so orange_block_1 is not clear. But if we remove brown_block_1 and green_block_2, then orange_block_1 becomes clear. But the constraint is that in at least one state, orange_block_1 is not clear. However, in the initial state, that's already true. So maybe the initial state satisfies this, but perhaps during the plan, we have to ensure that after some action, orange_block_1 is not clear again. Wait, the constraint says "must hold in at least one state". The initial state is part of the states. So maybe that's already satisfied. But perhaps the problem requires that during the execution of the plan, there's at least one state (could be the initial) where that's true. So maybe we don't need to do anything for this constraint. But the next part is a conditional: if in some state s, orange_block_1 is not clear, then in s or some state after, either black_block_1 is not clear or green_block_2 is not clear. Since in the initial state, orange_block_1 is not clear, so we need to ensure that either in the initial state or after, black_block_1 is not clear (it is clear initially) or green_block_2 is not clear (it is clear initially). Wait, no. Let me check the initial state again.

Initial state:

- black_block_1 is on the table and clear.

- red_block_1 has black_block_2 on it.

- orange_block_1 has brown_block_1, which has green_block_2 on it.

So in the initial state:

orange_block_1 is not clear (has brown_block_1 on top).

But the conditional is: if at any state s, orange_block_1 is not clear, then in s or after, either black_block_1 is not clear or green_block_2 is not clear.

In the initial state, orange_block_1 is not clear. So we need to check if in the initial state or any subsequent state, either black_block_1 is not clear or green_block_2 is not clear. In the initial state, black_block_1 is clear, and green_block_2 is clear. So the initial state doesn't satisfy the consequent. Therefore, the conditional is violated unless in some state after the initial, the consequent holds. Therefore, we must ensure that after the initial state (which triggers the conditional), there's a state where either black_block_1 is not clear or green_block_2 is not clear.

So, after any state where orange_block_1 is not clear (including the initial), we need to have at some point after that either black_block_1 has a block on it or green_block_2 has a block on it. Since in the plan, we might move blocks around, so perhaps stacking something on black_block_1 or green_block_2 would satisfy this.

But let's start planning the main goal: make red_block_1 clear. That requires removing black_block_2 from red_block_1. But black_block_2 has green_block_1 on top. So first, we need to unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2. Then, we can unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. Let's outline the steps:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2. But to do that, the robotic arm is empty, green_block_1 is clear (it is), and it's on black_block_2. So the action would be unstack green_block_1 black_block_2. Then, the arm is holding green_block_1.

2. Now, we need to put green_block_1 somewhere. But constraint 3 says green_block_1 can't be on the table. So we have to stack it on another block. Let's see. What blocks are available? After unstacking green_block_1, black_block_2 is clear. So perhaps stack green_block_1 on black_block_1. But that would require black_block_1 to be clear, which it is. So:

2. Stack green_block_1 black_block_1. Now, green_block_1 is on black_block_1, which is on the table.

Then, we can unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.

3. Unstack black_block_2 red_block_1. Now, holding black_block_2. This satisfies constraint 1 (must hold black_block_2 at some point). But for that action (unstack black_block_2 red_block_1), the preconditions are that black_block_2 is on red_block_1, black_block_2 is clear (which it is after step 1), and the arm is empty (which it is after step 2's stack action, which leaves the arm empty).

Now, after step 3, we are holding black_block_2. According to constraint 1, when we hold black_block_2, there must be an earlier state where either green_block_2 is not clear or we were holding orange_block_1. Let's check the steps so far. Before step 3 (unstack black_block_2), we need to have a prior state where either green_block_2 is not clear or we were holding orange_block_1.

In the initial state, green_block_2 is clear. So the first option isn't true. Did we hold orange_block_1 before step 3? Let's see. The steps so far are unstack green_block_1, stack it on black_block_1, then unstack black_block_2. So no, we didn't hold orange_block_1. So constraint 1 is not satisfied yet. Therefore, we need to arrange that before holding black_block_2 (step 3), we have a state where either green_block_2 is not clear or we held orange_block_1.

How can we make green_block_2 not clear? Currently, green_block_2 is on brown_block_1, which is on orange_block_1. So green_block_2 is the top of that stack. To make green_block_2 not clear, we need to put something on top of it. But that would require holding a block. Alternatively, if we unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1, then brown_block_1 becomes clear, but green_block_2 is being held. But that action would require unstacking green_block_2 from brown_block_1. Let's see. If we do that before step 3, then we would have held green_block_2, which isn't orange_block_1. So that wouldn't help. Alternatively, if we hold orange_block_1, but orange_block_1 is under brown_block_1. To hold orange_block_1, we need to unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1, but brown_block_1 has green_block_2 on top. So first, we need to unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1, then unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1, then pickup orange_block_1. But this seems like a lot of steps. But perhaps this is necessary to satisfy constraint 1.

Alternatively, maybe during the process of moving green_block_2, we can make green_block_2 not clear. Wait, green_block_2 is on brown_block_1. If we move green_block_2 to another block, then green_block_2's new position would have it on top of another block, so green_block_2 is clear, but the block under it is not. So that doesn't make green_block_2 not clear. The only way to make green_block_2 not clear is to place a block on top of it. But currently, there's nothing on top of green_block_2. So perhaps we need to stack a block on green_block_2. But which block? Maybe after moving some blocks.

Alternatively, if we can get orange_block_1 into the robotic arm's grasp. Let's think. To hold orange_block_1, we need to unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1. But brown_block_1 has green_block_2 on top, so first we need to unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1, then unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1, then we can pickup orange_block_1. But orange_block_1 is on the table. Wait, no: the initial state says orange_block_1 is on the table, and brown_block_1 is on orange_block_1. So to unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1, the preconditions are that brown_block_1 is on orange_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear (but initially, green_block_2 is on brown_block_1, so brown_block_1 isn't clear. So first, we need to unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1.

So steps:

0. Initial state.

Let's interleave these steps into the main plan.

Alternative approach: Let's consider that constraint 1 requires that when we hold black_block_2 (step 3 in the initial plan), there must have been a prior state where either green_block_2 is not clear (i.e., has a block on top) or we held orange_block_1.

In the initial plan, before step 3, we have steps 1 and 2. In step 1, we unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2. Then stack it on black_block_1. So after step 2, the arm is empty, ready to unstack black_block_2.

But in the initial state, green_block_2 is clear. So during steps 1 and 2, green_block_2 remains clear. Therefore, to satisfy constraint 1, we need to have held orange_block_1 before step 3. But how?

So perhaps before unstacking black_block_2, we need to perform actions that involve holding orange_block_1. Let's see.

To hold orange_block_1, we need to unstack brown_block_1 from it. But brown_block_1 has green_block_2 on top. So first, unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1.

So:

Step 0: unstack green_block_2 brown_block_1.

Now, holding green_block_2.

Step 1: putdown green_block_2. But wait, constraint 3 says green_block_1 can't be on the table, but green_block_2 can. So putting green_block_2 on the table is allowed. But doing so would make green_block_2 on the table, which might help with another constraint that requires green_block_2 to be on the table in some state (constraint 6: black_block_2 on black_block_1 and green_block_2 on table). So maybe this is part of the plan.

After putting green_block_2 down, the arm is empty.

Then, unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1. But brown_block_1 is now clear (since green_block_2 was removed). So step 2: unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1. Now holding brown_block_1.

Then putdown brown_block_1. Step 3: putdown brown_block_1. Now, orange_block_1 is clear. Then, we can pickup orange_block_1. Step 4: pickup orange_block_1. Now holding orange_block_1. This satisfies the condition for constraint 1: before holding black_block_2, we held orange_block_1. Then, we can proceed to the earlier steps of moving green_block_1 and black_block_2.

But now, inserting these steps into the plan would make the plan longer. Let's see if this is necessary.

Alternatively, maybe after unstacking green_block_2, we can stack it somewhere else instead of putting it down. But we need to satisfy constraint 6, which requires green_block_2 to be on the table in some state. So putting it down would achieve that. Also, constraint 6 requires black_block_2 to be on black_block_1. So we need to stack black_block_2 on black_block_1 at some point.

So integrating all this:

Plan steps:

1. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1. (Now holding green_block_2)
2. Putdown green_block_2. (Now green_block_2 is on the table; satisfies part of constraint 6)
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1. (Holding brown_block_1)
4. Putdown brown_block_1. (Now brown_block_1 is on the table)
5. Pickup orange_block_1. (Now holding orange_block_1; satisfies the condition for constraint 1's prerequisite)
6. Putdown orange_block_1. (But wait, if we put it down, then orange_block_1 is on the table again. But constraint 4 says orange_block_1 must not be on the table in some state. Wait, no: constraint 4 says that "the following expression must hold in every state: green_block_1 is not on the table". So green_block_1 can't be on the table, but other blocks can be. So putting orange_block_1 down is allowed. But we might need to do something else with it. Alternatively, maybe stack it somewhere. But since we need to satisfy constraint 2 (at some state, either black_block_2 is on green_block_2 or red_block_1 is not on the table). Since red_block_1 is on the table initially, making it not on the table requires picking it up. But the goal is to clear it, which would be achieved by removing black_block_2. So maybe after that, red_block_1 is still on the table. So to satisfy constraint 2, we might need to stack black_block_2 on green_block_2. Let's think: if we stack black_block_2 on green_block_2, then in that state, black_block_2 is on green_block_2, which satisfies the first part of constraint 2. That's good.

But to stack black_block_2 on green_block_2, we need to have black_block_2 in hand and green_block_2 clear. But after step 2, green_block_2 is on the table and clear. So perhaps later in the plan, after moving black_block_2, we can stack it on green_block_2.

But let's proceed. After step 5, we are holding orange_block_1. Now, we can put it down (step 6) but that's not helpful. Alternatively, stack it somewhere. For example, stack orange_block_1 on red_block_1. But red_block_1 currently has black_block_2 on it. So we need to first clear red_block_1. Wait, no: the initial steps are to eventually clear red_block_1. But perhaps stacking orange_block_1 on red_block_1 would block that. Not sure. Alternatively, stack orange_block_1 on another block. But maybe this isn't necessary. Let's proceed.

So after step 5, holding orange_block_1, which satisfies the condition for constraint 1. Now, we can proceed to handle the main goal.

But let's backtrack. The main goal is to clear red_block_1. To do that, we need to move black_block_2, which requires moving green_block_1 first. So after step 5, perhaps proceed to unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2.

Wait, but after step 5, we're holding orange_block_1. We need to put it down before we can do other actions. So step 6: putdown orange_block_1. Now, orange_block_1 is on the table. Then, we can proceed to unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2 (step 7).

But wait, green_block_1 is on black_block_2, which is on red_block_1. So unstacking green_block_1 would require the arm to be empty. So step 7: unstack green_block_1 black_block_2. Now, holding green_block_1.

Then, stack green_block_1 somewhere. Since constraint 3 says green_block_1 can't be on the table. So stack it on black_block_1 (step 8). Now, black_block_1 has green_block_1 on top.

Then, unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1 (step 9). Now, holding black_block_2. This satisfies constraint 1 (holding black_block_2) and the prerequisite is met because earlier, in step 5, we held orange_block_1. So constraint 1 is satisfied.

Now, we need to place black_block_2 somewhere. To satisfy constraint 6, we need to have a state where black_block_2 is on black_block_1 and green_block_2 is on the table. So stacking black_block_2 on black_block_1 would achieve that, but black_block_1 currently has green_block_1 on top. So we can't stack black_block_2 there. Alternatively, stack black_block_2 on green_block_2 (which is on the table after step 2). That would satisfy constraint 2 (black_block_2 on green_block_2) and also help with constraint 6 if we later move it. Let's see.

Step 10: stack black_block_2 green_block_2. Now, black_block_2 is on green_block_2, which is on the table. This satisfies constraint 2 (black_block_2 on green_block_2), and also satisfies part of constraint 6 (black_block_2 on black_block_1 is not achieved here, but green_block_2 is on the table). Wait, constraint 6 requires both: black_block_2 on black_block_1 and green_block_2 on the table. So stacking black_block_2 on green_block_2 would leave green_block_2 on the table (since green_block_2 is under black_block_2). But black_block_2 is on green_block_2, not on black_block_1. So we need to have a state where black_block_2 is on black_block_1. Maybe we need to move it again later.

Alternatively, after step 9 (holding black_block_2), stack it on black_block_1. But black_block_1 has green_block_1 on top. So first, we need to remove green_block_1 from black_block_1. Which would require unstacking green_block_1 from black_block_1 (step 10: unstack green_block_1 black_block_1). Then, stack black_block_2 on black_block_1 (step 11: stack black_block_2 black_block_1). Now, black_block_2 is on black_block_1, and green_block_1 is in hand. Then, we need to put green_block_1 somewhere else. Since it can't be on the table (constraint 3), we can stack it on another block. Maybe on green_block_2 (which is on the table after step 2). So step 12: stack green_block_1 green_block_2.

Now, green_block_1 is on green_block_2, which is on the table. This satisfies constraint 3 (green_block_1 not on table). Also, after step 11, black_block_2 is on black_block_1 and green_block_2 is on the table (from step 2). So constraint 6 is satisfied in the state after step 11.

But this adds several steps. However, this might be necessary to meet all constraints.

Continuing, after step 9 (holding black_block_2), if we stack it on green_block_2 (step 10), then:

Step 10: stack black_block_2 green_block_2. Now, black_block_2 is on green_block_2, which is on the table. This satisfies constraint 2 (black_block_2 on green_block_2). Then, later, we need to move black_block_2 to black_block_1 to satisfy constraint 6. But how?

Alternatively, maybe after stacking black_block_2 on green_block_2, we can then unstack it again and stack on black_block_1. But that would require additional steps. Let's see:

Step 10: stack black_block_2 green_block_2. Now, green_block_2 is under black_block_2.

Step 11: unstack black_block_2 green_block_2. Preconditions: black_block_2 is on green_block_2, clear, arm empty. After stacking, green_block_2 is not clear (since black_block_2 is on it). Wait, after stacking, the effect is that black_block_2 is on green_block_2, black_block_2 is clear, green_block_2 is not clear. So to unstack black_block_2 from green_block_2, we need that black_block_2 is clear (yes), arm empty (yes after step 10). So step 11: unstack black_block_2 green_block_2. Now holding black_block_2 again.

Then, stack it on black_block_1 (step 12). But black_block_1 currently has green_block_1 on top. So need to unstack green_block_1 first.

This is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, after step 9 (holding black_block_2), we can stack it on black_block_1. But black_block_1 has green_block_1 on it. So first, we need to move green_block_1. Let's see:

Step 10: unstack green_block_1 black_block_1. Now, holding green_block_1.

Step 11: stack green_block_1 green_block_2. Now, green_block_1 is on green_block_2 (which is on the table). Satisfies constraint 3.

Step 12: stack black_block_2 black_block_1. Now, black_block_2 is on black_block_1. This satisfies part of constraint 6. Since green_block_2 is on the table (from step 2), this state (after step 12) satisfies constraint 6: black_block_2 on black_block_1 and green_block_2 on table. So that's good.

Now, after step 12, red_block_1 is clear (since black_block_2 was moved). So the main goal is achieved. But we also need to satisfy the constraint that we hold red_block_1 at some point (constraint 7). Since after step 12, red_block_1 is clear, we can now pickup red_block_1 (step 13: pickup red_block_1). Then put it down again (step 14: putdown red_block_1). This would satisfy constraint 7 (holding red_block_1). However, this adds steps. But since the goal is already achieved (red_block_1 is clear), adding these steps would make the plan longer. But we have to include holding red_block_1 in the plan.

Wait, the main goal is to have red_block_1 clear. Once we've moved black_block_2 off red_block_1, red_block_1 is clear. So steps after that to pick up red_block_1 would undo that. Because picking up red_block_1 requires it to be clear and on the table. After step 12, red_block_1 is on the table and clear. So we can perform pickup red_block_1 (step 13), then put it down (step 14), making it clear again. But this is unnecessary for the goal but needed to satisfy constraint 7. However, in step 13, when we pick up red_block_1, red_block_1 is no longer on the table, so during that state, red_block_1 is not on the table. This would satisfy constraint 2 (at some state, either black_block_2 is on green_block_2 or red_block_1 is not on the table). So if in step 13, red_block_1 is not on the table, that satisfies the second condition of constraint 2. But earlier, when we stacked black_block_2 on black_block_1 (step 12), we could have satisfied constraint 2 via the first condition. However, in the state after step 12, black_block_2 is on black_block_1, not on green_block_2. So that doesn't help constraint 2. Therefore, we need to make sure that either during the plan, black_block_2 is stacked on green_block_2 (which we did in step 10 in an alternative path) or red_block_1 is not on the table. Since we have to pick up red_block_1 anyway for constraint 7, that action would satisfy constraint 2 as well.

So let's proceed with the plan where after stacking black_block_2 on black_block_1 (step 12), we then pickup red_block_1 (step 13), then put it down (step 14), which makes it clear again.

Now, checking the constraints:

1. We held black_block_2 (step 9). Before that, in step 5, we held orange_block_1. So constraint 1 is satisfied.

2. At some state, either black_block_2 on green_block_2 or red_block_1 not on table. When we pickup red_block_1 (step 13), red_block_1 is not on the table. So that satisfies the second condition.

3. Green_block_1 is never on the table. In step 11, we stacked green_block_1 on green_block_2 (which is on the table), so green_block_1 is not on the table. Correct.

4. At some state, orange_block_1 is not on the table or green_block_1 is on red_block_1. Orange_block_1 was put down on the table in step 6. But in step 5, we held orange_block_1, then put it down. So in step 6, orange_block_1 is on the table. But we need to have a state where either orange_block_1 is not on the table (which would require moving it) or green_block_1 is on red_block_1. Since green_block_1 is on green_block_2, which is on the table, the second condition isn't met. So we need to have a state where orange_block_1 is not on the table. To achieve this, perhaps we can stack orange_block_1 somewhere after step 5. Let's see. In step 5, we are holding orange_block_1. Instead of putting it down (step 6), we can stack it on another block. For example, stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1 (but black_block_1 has green_block_1 on top after step 8). Wait, after step 8, green_block_1 is on black_block_1. So after step 5 (holding orange_block_1), we could stack it on another block. Maybe on red_block_1. But red_block_1 has black_block_2 on it until step 9. Wait, no: in the initial plan, after step 9, black_block_2 is moved off red_block_1. So after step 9, red_block_1 is clear and on the table. So after step 9, we can stack orange_block_1 on red_block_1. Let's adjust the plan:

After step 5 (holding orange_block_1), instead of putting it down (step 6), we can proceed to stack it on red_block_1 once red_block_1 is clear. But red_block_1 is clear after step 9. So perhaps:

After step 9 (holding black_block_2), we need to stack orange_block_1 on red_block_1. Wait, but after step 5, we were holding orange_block_1. If we don't put it down, but instead keep holding it until red_block_1 is clear, but that would require multiple actions while holding a block, which isn't possible because the arm can only hold one block at a time, and other actions require the arm to be empty.

Alternatively, after step 5 (holding orange_block_1), stack it on a different block that's available. For example, after step 5, stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1 (but black_block_1 has green_block_1 on it after step 8). Wait, let's re-examine the steps:

The steps up to step 5 are:

1. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1.

2. Putdown green_block_2.

3. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1.

4. Putdown brown_block_1.

5. Pickup orange_block_1.

At this point, we are holding orange_block_1. Then, instead of putting it down, we could stack it on black_block_1 (assuming black_block_1 is clear). But in the initial state, black_block_1 is clear. However, after step 1 and 2, black_block_1 is still clear. So before step 6, if we stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1, that would make orange_block_1 not on the table. So step 6: stack orange_block_1 black_block_1.

Now, orange_block_1 is on black_block_1, so it's not on the table. This satisfies constraint 4 (at some state, either orange_block_1 is not on the table or green_block_1 is on red_block_1). Since we have orange_block_1 not on the table, constraint 4 is satisfied.

Then, proceed with unstacking green_block_1 from black_block_2 (step 7), etc.

But after stacking orange_block_1 on black_block_1, black_block_1 is no longer clear, so when we later try to stack green_block_1 on black_block_1 (step 8), it's not possible because black_block_1 has orange_block_1 on it. So this complicates the plan.

Alternatively, after stacking orange_block_1 on black_block_1, we need to move it again. This seems messy. Maybe a better approach is to, after step 5 (holding orange_block_1), stack it on another block that's available and clear. For example, stack it on green_block_2 (which is on the table and clear after step 2). Step 6: stack orange_block_1 green_block_2. Now, orange_block_1 is on green_block_2, which is on the table. This way, orange_block_1 is not on the table, satisfying constraint 4. Then, proceed with the rest of the steps.

So adjusting the plan:

1. Unstack green_block_2 brown_block_1.

2. Putdown green_block_2.

3. Unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1.

4. Putdown brown_block_1.

5. Pickup orange_block_1.

6. Stack orange_block_1 green_block_2. Now, orange_block_1 is on green_block_2. So orange_block_1 is not on the table. Satisfies constraint 4.

7. Now, proceed to unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2 (step 7).

But after step 6, the arm is empty. So step 7: unstack green_block_1 black_block_2.

8. Stack green_block_1 black_block_1. Now, black_block_1 has green_block_1 on top.

9. Unstack black_block_2 red_block_1. Now holding black_block_2. This satisfies constraint 1, and earlier step 5 (holding orange_block_1) satisfies the prerequisite.

10. Stack black_block_2 black_block_1. But black_block_1 has green_block_1 on top. So this isn't possible. Therefore, we need to move green_block_1 again.

Wait, after step 8, green_block_1 is on black_block_1. So to stack black_block_2 on black_block_1, we need to unstack green_block_1 first.

10. Unstack green_block_1 black_block_1. Now holding green_block_1.

11. Stack green_block_1 green_block_2. But green_block_2 has orange_block_1 on it (from step 6). So we can't stack green_block_1 on green_block_2 unless orange_block_1 is moved. Alternatively, stack green_block_1 on orange_block_1. But orange_block_1 is on green_block_2.

So step 11: stack green_block_1 orange_block_1. Now, green_block_1 is on orange_block_1. This satisfies constraint 3 (not on the table), and orange_block_1 is now not clear (has green_block_1 on top). Then, step 12: stack black_block_2 black_block_1. Now, black_block_2 is on black_block_1, and green_block_2 is on the table (from step 2). So constraint 6 is satisfied.

Then, step 13: pickup red_block_1 (since it's clear), step 14: putdown red_block_1. This satisfies constraint 7.

Now, checking all constraints:

1. Held black_block_2 (step 9). Earlier step 5 held orange_block_1. Satisfied.

2. In step 13, red_block_1 is not on the table. Satisfied.

3. Green_block_1 is never on the table. Correct.

4. Step 6: orange_block_1 is not on the table. Satisfied.

5. Constraint 5: at some state, either orange_block_1 is not on the table (done in step 6) or green_block_1 is on red_block_1. So satisfied via the first condition.

6. Step 12: black_block_2 on black_block_1 and green_block_2 on table. Satisfied.

7. Step 13: holding red_block_1. Satisfied.

8. In the initial state, orange_block_1 is not clear. So the initial state satisfies constraint 8. But the conditional requires that if orange_block_1 is not clear in any state, then in that state or after, either black_block_1 is not clear or green_block_2 is not clear. In the initial state, orange_block_1 is not clear. At that time, black_block_1 is clear and green_block_2 is clear. So we need to ensure that after the initial state, in some subsequent state, either black_block_1 or green_block_2 is not clear.

Looking at the plan:

After step 6, orange_block_1 is on green_block_2. So green_block_2 is not clear (has orange_block_1 on top). So after step 6, green_block_2 is not clear. This happens after the initial state. So the conditional for constraint 8 is satisfied because after the initial state, in step 6, green_block_2 is not clear. Thus, whenever orange_block_1 is not clear (initial state and until step 6), after that, green_block_2 becomes not clear, satisfying the conditional.

Additionally, after step 6, orange_block_1 is on green_block_2, so orange_block_1 is clear (since nothing is on top of it). Wait, no: after step 6, orange_block_1 is on green_block_2. So orange_block_1 is clear (since nothing is on top), but green_block_2 is not clear (has orange_block_1 on top). The conditional requires that if at any state s, orange_block_1 is not clear, then in s or after, either black_block_1 or green_block_2 is not clear. The initial state is s where orange_block_1 is not clear. In the initial state, black_block_1 is clear and green_block_2 is clear. So after the initial state, in step 6, green_block_2 becomes not clear, which satisfies the conditional.

Thus, all constraints are satisfied.

The final steps would be:

1. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Putdown green_block_2.
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Putdown brown_block_1.
5. Pickup orange_block_1.
6. Stack orange_block_1 green_block_2.
7. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2.
8. Stack green_block_1 black_block_1.
9. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.
10. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_1.
11. Stack green_block_1 orange_block_1.
12. Stack black_block_2 black_block_1.
13. Pickup red_block_1.
14. Putdown red_block_1.

But let's check if this is the shortest possible. For example, step 10 and 11 could be avoided if we can stack black_block_2 on black_block_1 without moving green_block_1. But in step 8, green_block_1 is on black_block_1, making it not clear. So to stack black_block_2 on black_block_1, we have to unstack green_block_1 first. So steps 10-12 are necessary.

But wait, after step 9, we're holding black_block_2. At that point, black_block_1 has green_block_1 on it. So can we stack black_block_2 on green_block_1? Yes, if green_block_1 is clear. But green_block_1 is on black_block_1, which is on the table. Since green_block_1 is on black_block_1, and after step 8, green_block_1 is clear (because stacking it makes it clear). Wait, the effect of stack is that the top block is clear. So after step 8 (stack green_block_1 black_block_1), green_block_1 is clear. So black_block_1 is not clear (has green_block_1 on top). So when we unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1 (step 9), we are holding black_block_2. Then, we can stack it on green_block_1 (which is clear). Step 10: stack black_block_2 green_block_1. This would make black_block_2 on green_block_1, which is on black_block_1. This way, we don't need to move green_block_1. Then, constraint 6 requires that black_block_2 is on black_block_1 and green_block_2 is on the table. But black_block_2 is on green_block_1, which is on black_block_1. So black_block_2 is not directly on black_block_1. So this doesn't satisfy constraint 6. Therefore, we need to have black_block_2 directly on black_block_1. Hence, steps 10-12 are necessary.

But perhaps there's a shorter way. Let's think again.

Alternative approach:

After step 9 (holding black_block_2), stack it on black_block_1. But black_block_1 has green_block_1 on it. So this isn't allowed unless green_block_1 is clear. Wait, no: the stack action requires that the target block (black_block_1) is clear. Since green_block_1 is on black_block_1, black_block_1 is not clear. So can't stack black_block_2 on black_block_1 directly. Hence, we must first unstack green_block_1 from black_block_1.

This means steps 10 and 11 are necessary. Then, after stacking black_block_2 on black_block_1 (step 12), green_block_1 is in hand. We need to stack it somewhere else. So step 13: stack green_block_1 orange_block_1 (which is on green_block_2).

Then, step 14: pickup red_block_1 and put it down.

This makes the plan 14 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way. Let's see.

Wait, after step 9 (holding black_block_2), if we stack it on green_block_2 (step 10), which is on the table, then constraint 2 is satisfied (black_block_2 on green_block_2). Also, constraint 6 requires black_block_2 on black_block_1 and green_block_2 on the table. But if we stack black_block_2 on green_block_2, then green_block_2 is on the table, but black_block_2 isn't on black_block_1. So constraint 6 isn't satisfied. Therefore, we need to find a way to have both black_block_2 on black_block_1 and green_block_2 on the table. The only way is to stack black_block_2 on black_block_1 after moving green_block_1.

So perhaps the plan has to be as follows.

Final plan steps:

1. Unstack green_block_2 brown_block_1
2. Putdown green_block_2
3. Unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
4. Putdown brown_block_1
5. Pickup orange_block_1
6. Stack orange_block_1 green_block_2
7. Unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
8. Stack green_block_1 black_block_1
9. Unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
10. Unstack green_block_1 black_block_1
11. Stack green_block_1 orange_block_1
12. Stack black_block_2 black_block_1
13. Pickup red_block_1
14. Putdown red_block_1

This plan has 14 steps. Let's verify all constraints:

- Constraint 1: Holding black_block_2 in step 9. Before that, held orange_block_1 in step 5. Satisfied.

- Constraint 2: In step 13, red_block_1 is picked up, so it's not on the table. Satisfied.

- Constraint 3: Green_block_1 is never on the table. Correct.

- Constraint 4: In step 6, orange_block_1 is stacked on green_block_2, so not on the table. Satisfied.

- Constraint 5: Same as constraint 4, satisfied.

- Constraint 6: After step 12, black_block_2 is on black_block_1, and green_block_2 is on the table. Satisfied.

- Constraint 7: Holding red_block_1 in step 13. Satisfied.

- Constraint 8: Initial state has orange_block_1 not clear. Then, in step 6, green_block_2 is not clear (has orange_block_1 on it). So after initial state, green_block_2 becomes not clear. Satisfied.

- Constraint 8's conditional is satisfied because after the initial state, in step 6, green_block_2 is not clear.

Now, checking for optimality. Is there a shorter plan? For example, after step 9, if we can satisfy constraint 6 without steps 10-12, but I don't think so. Also, the constraints require certain states that may necessitate additional steps. It's possible that this is the minimal plan given the constraints.

Another thing to consider: constraint 7 requires holding red_block_1. After step 12, red_block_1 is clear and on the table. So steps 13 and 14 are necessary. However, if we can integrate holding red_block_1 into the plan without adding steps. For example, after step 9, when we have black_block_2 in hand, perhaps use it to unstack red_block_1 from the table. Wait, red_block_1 is on the table. To pick it up, it must be clear. After step 9, red_block_1 is clear. So after step 9, we could put down black_block_2 and pickup red_block_1. But that would require:

After step 9: holding black_block_2.

Step 10: putdown black_block_2. Now, black_block_2 is on the table.

Step 11: pickup red_block_1. Now holding red_block_1. This satisfies constraint 7.

Step 12: putdown red_block_1. Now, red_block_1 is clear again.

But this adds two steps, making the plan longer. So the previous approach of steps 13 and 14 is better.

Alternatively, after step 9 (holding black_block_2), can we stack it somewhere else and then pickup red_block_1? For example:

Step 10: stack black_block_2 green_block_2. Now, black_block_2 is on green_block_2.

Step 11: pickup red_block_1. Then putdown.

This adds two steps but satisfies constraint 7. However, this doesn't satisfy constraint 6, which requires black_block_2 to be on black_block_1 and green_block_2 on the table. So stacking black_block_2 on green_block_2 leaves green_block_2 on the table, but black_block_2 isn't on black_block_1. So we still need to move it again, leading to more steps. Hence, the initial plan with 14 steps might be the minimal one.

But perhaps there's a shorter way. Let me think again.

Alternative plan:

1. Unstack green_block_1 black_block_2 (arm holds green_block_1)
2. Stack green_block_1 black_block_1 (arm empty)
3. Unstack black_block_2 red_block_1 (arm holds black_block_2)
   - Now, need to satisfy constraint 1: holding black_block_2. But before this, no step involved holding orange_block_1 or having green_block_2 not clear. So constraint 1 not satisfied.

Thus, this plan is invalid.

Another approach:

To satisfy constraint 1, when holding black_block_2 (step 3), there must have been a prior state where green_block_2 is not clear or held orange_block_1.

If we can make green_block_2 not clear before step 3. For example, stack something on green_block_2. Let's see:

1. Unstack green_block_2 brown_block_1 (hold green_block_2)
2. Stack green_block_2 black_block_1 (now green_block_2 is on black_block_1, making green_block_2 not clear)
3. Unstack green_block_1 black_block_2 (hold green_block_1)
4. Stack green_block_1 green_block_2 (now green_block_1 is on green_block_2)
5. Unstack black_block_2 red_block_1 (hold black_block_2)

Now, when we hold black_block_2 (step 5), prior state (step 2) had green_block_2 not clear (stacked under green_block_1). Thus, satisfies constraint 1.

But then, need to continue:

6. Stack black_block_2 black_block_1 (but black_block_1 has green_block_2 on it. So not possible. So need to stack black_block_2 elsewhere.

But this approach may not satisfy other constraints. For example, constraint 6 requires black_block_2 on black_block_1 and green_block_2 on table. So after step 2, green_block_2 is on black_block_1, not on the table. So this approach fails constraint 6.

Thus, it's necessary to follow the longer plan to meet all constraints.

In conclusion, the optimal plan must include the steps outlined earlier, totaling 14 actions. However, perhaps there's a way to optimize steps related to moving orange_block_1. For example, after step 5 (holding orange_block_1), instead of stacking it on green_block_2, perhaps we can stack it somewhere else that allows us to satisfy other constraints more efficiently. But given the constraints, it's challenging to find a shorter path.
