I'll first analyze the initial state of the world and the goal to understand what needs to be done.

Initial state:
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- orange_block_2 is on top of white_block_1
- black_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- green_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2
- red_block_2 is on the table
- black_block_1 is clear
- green_block_1 is clear
- red_block_2 is clear
- not holding any block

Goal: orange_block_2 is on top of black_block_1

Now, let's think about the constraints and how they affect the planning.

1. "black_block_1 is not on the table" must be true at some point.
   - Currently, black_block_1 is on top of red_block_1, so this constraint is satisfied.
   
2. If "black_block_1 is not on the table" holds, then "red_block_1 is clear" must hold in that state or after.
   - Currently, black_block_1 is on top of red_block_1, so red_block_1 is not clear. We'll need to make sure red_block_1 becomes clear at some point.
   
3. "white_block_1 is clear" must be true at some point.
   - Currently, orange_block_2 is on top of white_block_1, so white_block_1 is not clear. We'll need to move orange_block_2 at some point.
   
4. If "white_block_1 is clear" is true, then "orange_block_1 is clear" must have been true earlier.
   - Currently, red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1, so orange_block_1 is not clear. We'll need to clear orange_block_1 before clearing white_block_1.
   
5. "holding orange_block_1" must be true at some point.
   - This means we'll need to unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1, then pickup orange_block_1.
   
6. "orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" must be true at some point.
   - We'll need to stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1 at some point.
   
7. "holding orange_block_2" must be true at some point.
   - We'll need to unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2, then unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1.
   
8. If "holding orange_block_2" is true, then "red_block_1 is on top of green_block_1" must have been true earlier.
   - We'll need to arrange red_block_1 on top of green_block_1 before picking up orange_block_2.
   
9. "holding green_block_1" must be true at some point.
   - We'll need to unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2.
   
10. If "holding green_block_1" is true, then "red_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1" or "orange_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" must be true in that state or after.
    - We'll need to ensure one of these conditions is met after picking up green_block_1.
    
11. "black_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" must be true at some point.
    - Since black_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 initially, this constraint is already satisfied.
    
12. If "black_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is true, then "red_block_1 is clear" must be true in that state or after.
    - Similar to constraint 2, we need to make sure red_block_1 becomes clear.

Alright, let's plan a sequence of actions to achieve the goal and satisfy all these constraints. Here's a rough plan:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1 (this satisfies constraint 11)
2. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1 (this satisfies constraints 2 and 12)
3. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2 (this will help us satisfy constraint 9)
4. Stack green_block_1 somewhere (maybe on the table)
5. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1 (this helps with constraint 3)
6. Stack orange_block_2 somewhere (maybe on the table)
7. Pickup orange_block_1 (this satisfies constraint 5)
8. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1 (this satisfies constraint 6)
9. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1 (this helps with constraint 8)
10. Pickup orange_block_2 (this satisfies constraint 7, and constraint 8 is satisfied because red_block_1 is on green_block_1)
11. Stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1 (this achieves the goal)

Let's check if all constraints are satisfied with this rough plan:
1. ✅ black_block_1 is not on the table (initially it's on red_block_1)
2. ✅ If black_block_1 is not on the table, then red_block_1 is clear (we clear red_block_1 in step 2)
3. ✅ white_block_1 is clear (we clear it in step 5)
4. ✅ If white_block_1 is clear, then orange_block_1 was clear earlier (we clear orange_block_1 in step 2, which is before step 5)
5. ✅ holding orange_block_1 (step 7)
6. ✅ orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 (step 8)
7. ✅ holding orange_block_2 (step 10)
8. ✅ If holding orange_block_2, then red_block_1 was on top of green_block_1 earlier (we arrange this in step 9, which is before step 10)
9. ✅ holding green_block_1 (step 3)

Hmm, it seems constraint 10 might not be satisfied: if we're holding green_block_1 (after step 3), we need either red_block_2 on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 on black_block_1. Let me revise the plan:

Before step 4, let's add:
- Stack green_block_1 on the table
- Stack black_block_1 on the table
- Pickup orange_block_1
- Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1 (this satisfies constraint 10)

Let me rewrite the full plan:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1
2. Putdown black_block_1 (on the table)
3. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1
4. Putdown red_block_1 (on the table)
5. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2 (now holding green_block_1, satisfying constraint 9)
6. Putdown green_block_1 (on the table)
7. Pickup orange_block_1 (satisfying constraint 5)
8. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1 (satisfying constraint 10: After holding green_block_1, orange_block_1 is on black_block_1)
9. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1 (satisfying constraint 3: white_block_1 is now clear)
10. Putdown orange_block_2 (on the table)
11. Pickup red_block_1
12. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1
13. Pickup orange_block_2 (satisfying constraint 7, and constraint 8 is satisfied because red_block_1 is on green_block_1)
14. Stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1 (achieving the goal)

Wait, there's a problem here. In step 8, we stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1, but later we want to stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1. This won't work because black_block_1 won't be clear. Let me revise again.

Actually, I think there are other issues too. Let me take it step by step and make sure all the constraints are satisfied.

Given our initial state and the constraints, let's think through this carefully:

Initial State:
```
orange_block_1 (table)
  |
red_block_1
  |
black_block_1 (clear)

white_block_1 (table)
  |
orange_block_2
  |
green_block_1 (clear)

red_block_2 (table, clear)
```

Goal: orange_block_2 is on top of black_block_1.

First, I need to address constraint 4: If white_block_1 is clear, then orange_block_1 was clear earlier. This means I need to clear orange_block_1 before clearing white_block_1.

Next, constraint 8: If I'm holding orange_block_2, then red_block_1 was on top of green_block_1 earlier. So, I need to arrange red_block_1 on green_block_1 before picking up orange_block_2.

Constraint 10: If I'm holding green_block_1, then red_block_2 is on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 is on black_block_1 should be true then or later. So, after I pick up green_block_1, I need to arrange either of these.

Considering all these constraints, let's plan:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1
2. Putdown black_block_1 (on the table)
3. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1 (now orange_block_1 is clear, helping with constraint 4)
4. Putdown red_block_1 (on the table)
5. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2 (now holding green_block_1, satisfying constraint 9)
6. Putdown green_block_1 (on the table)
7. Pickup red_block_2
8. Stack red_block_2 on orange_block_1 (satisfying constraint 10: After holding green_block_1, red_block_2 is on orange_block_1)
9. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1 (satisfying constraint 3: white_block_1 is now clear)
10. Putdown orange_block_2 (on the table)
11. Pickup orange_block_1 (satisfying constraint 5)
12. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1 (satisfying constraint 6)
13. Pickup red_block_1
14. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1
15. Pickup orange_block_2 (satisfying constraint 7, and constraint 8 is satisfied because red_block_1 is on green_block_1)
16. Stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1 (achieving the goal)

Hmm, there's a problem in step 11. I can't pickup orange_block_1 because red_block_2 is on top of it. Let me revise:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1
2. Putdown black_block_1 (on the table)
3. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1 (now orange_block_1 is clear, helping with constraint 4)
4. Putdown red_block_1 (on the table)
5. Pickup orange_block_1 (satisfying constraint 5 early)
6. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1 (satisfying constraint 6)
7. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2 (now holding green_block_1, satisfying constraint 9)
8. Putdown green_block_1 (on the table)
9. Pickup red_block_2
10. Stack red_block_2 on orange_block_1 (satisfying constraint 10: After holding green_block_1, red_block_2 is on orange_block_1)
11. Pickup red_block_1
12. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1
13. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1 (wait, this contradicts step 6, where orange_block_1 is on white_block_1)

I'm making a mistake. Let me reconsider the initial state to avoid contradictions:

Initial State:
```
orange_block_1 (table)
  |
red_block_1
  |
black_block_1 (clear)

white_block_1 (table)
  |
orange_block_2
  |
green_block_1 (clear)

red_block_2 (table, clear)
```

From this, at the start, orange_block_2 is on top of white_block_1. So step 13 doesn't make sense. Let's revise again.

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1
2. Putdown black_block_1 (on the table)
3. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1 (now orange_block_1 is clear, helping with constraint 4)
4. Putdown red_block_1 (on the table)
5. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2 (now holding green_block_1, satisfying constraint 9)
6. Putdown green_block_1 (on the table)
7. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1 (satisfying constraint 3: white_block_1 is now clear)
8. Putdown orange_block_2 (on the table)
9. Pickup orange_block_1 (satisfying constraint 5)
10. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1 (satisfying constraint 6)
11. Pickup red_block_2
12. Stack red_block_2 on orange_block_1 (satisfying constraint 10: After holding green_block_1, red_block_2 is on orange_block_1)
13. Pickup red_block_1
14. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1
15. Pickup orange_block_2 (satisfying constraint 7, and constraint 8 is satisfied because red_block_1 is on green_block_1)
16. Stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1 (achieving the goal)

This should address all constraints:
1. ✅ black_block_1 is not on the table (initially it's on red_block_1)
2. ✅ If black_block_1 is not on the table, then red_block_1 is clear (we clear red_block_1 in step 3)
3. ✅ white_block_1 is clear (we clear it in step 7)
4. ✅ If white_block_1 is clear, then orange_block_1 was clear earlier (we clear orange_block_1 in step 3, which is before step 7)
5. ✅ holding orange_block_1 (step 9)
6. ✅ orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 (step 10)
7. ✅ holding orange_block_2 (step 15)
8. ✅ If holding orange_block_2, then red_block_1 was on top of green_block_1 earlier (we arrange this in step 14, which is before step 15)
9. ✅ holding green_block_1 (step 5)
10. ✅ If holding green_block_1, then red_block_2 is on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 is on black_block_1 must be true later (we arrange red_block_2 on orange_block_1 in step 12, which is after step 5)
11. ✅ black_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 (initially it's on red_block_1)
12. ✅ If black_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, then red_block_1 is clear (we clear red_block_1 in step 3)

The plan seems to satisfy all constraints and achieve the goal. Let's verify it once more:

white_block_1 (table)
  |
orange_block_1
  |
red_block_2 (clear)

  |
red_block_1 (clear)
```

This achieves the goal and satisfies all the constraints. So, the final plan is:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1
2. Putdown black_block_1
3. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1
4. Putdown red_block_1
5. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2
6. Putdown green_block_1
7. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1
8. Putdown orange_block_2
9. Pickup orange_block_1
10. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1
11. Pickup red_block_2
12. Stack red_block_2 on orange_block_1
13. Pickup red_block_1
14. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1
15. Pickup orange_block_2
16. Stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1

Let me check whether this is an optimal plan (i.e, has the minimum number of steps).

Looking at the final state, we need orange_block_2 on top of black_block_1. In the initial state, orange_block_2 is under green_block_1, and black_block_1 is on top of red_block_1, which is on top of orange_block_1.

Minimum steps to achieve the goal:
1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1
2. Putdown black_block_1
3. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2
4. Putdown green_block_1
5. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1
6. Stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1

But we need to satisfy all the constraints, which is why our plan is longer. I've tried to minimize the steps as much as possible.

But have I really checked optimality? Let's think if there's a shorter path:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1
2. Putdown black_block_1
3. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2
4. Putdown green_block_1
5. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1
6. Putdown orange_block_2
7. Pickup orange_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 5)
8. Putdown orange_block_1 (to free the arm)
9. Pickup red_block_1 (to clear orange_block_1)
10. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 8 for when we pick up orange_block_2)
11. Pickup orange_block_2
12. Stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1 (achieves the goal)

This is 12 steps, but it doesn't address constraint 6 (orange_block_1 on white_block_1) and constraint 10 (red_block_2 on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 on black_block_1 after holding green_block_1). So, it's incomplete.

Actually, I just realized that in our original plan, we're missing steps to address constraint 10.  The constraint says if we're holding green_block_1, then red_block_2 must be on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 must be on black_block_1 at that point or later. In our plan, we pick up green_block_1 at step 5 and put it down at step 6. After that, we arrange red_block_2 on orange_block_1 at step 12, so this constraint is satisfied.

Let's double-check if our plan is optimal by trying to derive it from scratch.

Goal: orange_block_2 on black_block_1.

Constraint dependencies:
- To clear orange_block_2, we need to unstack green_block_1.
- If we're holding green_block_1 (constraint 9), then we need to later satisfy constraint 10: red_block_2 on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 on black_block_1.
- To use orange_block_2, we also need to satisfy constraint 8: red_block_1 on green_block_1 before picking up orange_block_2.
- If white_block_1 is clear (constraint 3), then orange_block_1 must have been clear earlier (constraint 4).
- We need to hold orange_block_1 at some point (constraint 5) and stack it on white_block_1 (constraint 6).

From these, it's clear we need to perform the following actions in some order:
1. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2
2. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1
3. Stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1
4. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1
5. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1
6. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1
7. Pickup orange_block_1
8. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1
9. Stack red_block_2 on orange_block_1 or Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1

So, we need to at least perform these 9 actions, plus any additional putdowns or pickups to free the robotic arm. My previous plan has 16 steps, which seems about right considering the additional putdowns and pickups.

OK, I think our original plan is optimal. Here it is:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1
2. Putdown black_block_1
3. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1
4. Putdown red_block_1
5. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2
6. Putdown green_block_1
7. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1
8. Putdown orange_block_2
9. Pickup orange_block_1
10. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1
11. Pickup red_block_2
12. Stack red_block_2 on orange_block_1
13. Pickup red_block_1
14. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1
15. Pickup orange_block_2
16. Stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1

This satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal.
