Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to get orange_block_2 on top of black_block_1. But there are a bunch of constraints we need to satisfy. Let me start by understanding the initial state and then the constraints.

Initial State:

- orange_block_1 is on the table.
- white_block_1 is on the table.
- red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1. So, orange_block_1 has red_block_1, and black_block_1 is on top of red_block_1. So the stack here is orange_block_1 -> red_block_1 -> black_block_1. And black_block_1 is clear.
- orange_block_2 is on top of white_block_1, and green_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2. So white_block_1 has orange_block_2, which has green_block_1. Both green_block_1 and black_block_1 are clear.
- red_block_2 is on the table, clear.
- The arm is empty.

Goal: orange_block_2 is on top of black_block_1.

Constraints to consider:

1. At some state, black_block_1 is not on the table. Since initially, black_block_1 is on red_block_1, which is on orange_block_1, so it's not on the table. But maybe after moving, if we move it to the table, then this constraint might need to be checked. Wait, no. The initial state has black_block_1 not on the table, so maybe that's already satisfied. But the constraint says "must hold in at least one state". So maybe the initial state already covers that? But perhaps the problem is that if during the plan, black_block_1 is put on the table, then we have to ensure that at some point after, red_block_1 is clear. Hmm, but the first constraint is that black_block_1 is not on the table in at least one state. Since in the initial state, it's not on the table, that's already satisfied. But maybe during the plan, if we move it to the table and then move it again, but the first constraint is already met by the initial state. So maybe that's okay. But need to check the other constraints.

But let's list all constraints step by step.

Constraints:

1. "black_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in at least one state. Already true in the initial state, so that's covered. But perhaps the plan must not make it so that all states after have black_block_1 on the table. But since the initial state satisfies this, the constraint is already met. So maybe we don't need to do anything for this.

2. If in some state s, "black_block_1 is not on the table" holds, then "red_block_1 is clear" must hold at s or after. Since in the initial state, black_block_1 is on red_block_1, which means red_block_1 is not clear. But in the initial state, black_block_1 is not on the table (so s is the initial state), so we need to ensure that red_block_1 is clear at s or after. But in the initial state, red_block_1 is not clear (since black_block_1 is on it). Therefore, this constraint requires that at some point after the initial state, red_block_1 becomes clear. So we need to unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1 to make red_block_1 clear. So that's part of the plan.

3. "white_block_1 is clear" must hold in at least one state. Initially, white_block_1 has orange_block_2, which has green_block_1. So white_block_1 is not clear. So we need to clear it. To do that, we need to remove orange_block_2 and green_block_1. But the goal requires orange_block_2 to be on black_block_1. So perhaps we need to unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2, then unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1, making white_block_1 clear. So that would satisfy this constraint.

4. If "white_block_1 is clear" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state where "orange_block_1 is clear". So before making white_block_1 clear, we need to have a state where orange_block_1 is clear. Currently, orange_block_1 has red_block_1 and black_block_1. So orange_block_1 is not clear. So we need to make orange_block_1 clear at some point before making white_block_1 clear. To make orange_block_1 clear, we need to remove all blocks above it. So first, unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1, then unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1. Then orange_block_1 is clear. Then later, when we make white_block_1 clear (by moving orange_block_2), that would satisfy the constraint.

5. Must have a state where holding orange_block_1. So we need to pick up orange_block_1 at some point. But in the initial state, orange_block_1 has red_block_1 on it, so it's not clear. To pick up orange_block_1, we need to clear it. Which would require removing red_block_1 and black_block_1. Wait, but orange_block_1 is on the table. To pickup, the block must be on the table and clear. But in the initial state, red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1, so orange_block_1 is not clear. So to pick up orange_block_1, we need to first remove red_block_1 and black_block_1. Wait, but you can't pick up a block that has another block on it. So the only way to pick up orange_block_1 is if it's clear and on the table. But since it's under red_block_1, we need to first remove red_block_1 and black_block_1. Then put them somewhere else so that orange_block_1 is clear.

But maybe that's part of the plan. Let's see.

6. Must have a state where orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_1. So at some point, we need to stack orange_block_1 onto white_block_1. But to do that, we need to have orange_block_1 in hand, and white_block_1 clear. But white_block_1 initially has orange_block_2 and green_block_1. So to make white_block_1 clear, we need to remove those blocks first. Then stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1. Then maybe move it again later? But this is a required state, so the plan must include stacking orange_block_1 on white_block_1 at some point.

7. Must have a state where holding orange_block_2. So we need to pick up orange_block_2. But orange_block_2 is under green_block_1. So first, unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2, then unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1.

8. If holding orange_block_2 in some state, there must be an earlier state where red_block_1 is on top of green_block_1. Wait, red_block_1 is initially on orange_block_1. So we need to move red_block_1 onto green_block_1 before picking up orange_block_2. But green_block_1 is on orange_block_2, which is on white_block_1. So to stack red_block_1 on green_block_1, we need to have green_block_1 clear. So first, unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2, put it down, then stack red_block_1 onto green_block_1. But this might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe during the process of moving blocks, we can arrange this.

9. Must have a state where holding green_block_1. So need to pick up green_block_1. Which is on top of orange_block_2. So unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2.

10. If holding green_block_1 in some state s, then either "red_block_2 is on orange_block_1" or "orange_block_1 is on black_block_1" must hold at s or after. So after holding green_block_1, we need to ensure that at some point, either red_block_2 is on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 is on black_block_1. 

11. "black_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" must hold in at least one state. Initially, black_block_1 is on red_block_1, which is on orange_block_1. So this is already true. But perhaps during the plan, we might place black_block_1 on white_block_1, but need to ensure that at some point, it's not. But the initial state already satisfies this, so maybe this constraint is already met. But maybe we need to ensure that in the plan, black_block_1 is not placed on white_block_1, or if it is, then later removed. But given the goal is to have orange_block_2 on black_block_1, perhaps we need to move black_block_1 to a position where it's not on white_block_1, which is already the case. So maybe this constraint is already satisfied. But need to check.

12. If "black_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" holds in s, then "red_block_1 is clear" must hold at s or after. Since in the initial state, black_block_1 is not on white_block_1 (it's on red_block_1), this condition holds. So we need red_block_1 to be clear at the initial state or after. In the initial state, red_block_1 is under black_block_1, so not clear. So we need to make red_block_1 clear after the initial state. Which aligns with constraint 2.

So, putting this all together, the plan must do the following:

- Move blocks such that orange_block_2 ends up on black_block_1.

But along the way, we have to satisfy all these constraints.

Let's outline the steps needed.

First, the goal is to stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1. So we need to have orange_block_2 in hand and black_block_1 clear.

But currently, orange_block_2 is under green_block_1 on white_block_1. So to get orange_block_2, we need to first unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2, then unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1.

But before that, we need to satisfy constraint 8: when we hold orange_block_2, there must have been a prior state where red_block_1 is on green_block_1. So before picking up orange_block_2, we need to have red_block_1 stacked on green_block_1.

But red_block_1 is currently on orange_block_1. So we need to move red_block_1 onto green_block_1. But green_block_1 is on orange_block_2. To stack red_block_1 on green_block_1, green_block_1 must be clear. So first, unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2 and put it down. Then stack red_block_1 on green_block_1. Then, after that, unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1 (since white_block_1 needs to be cleared for constraint 3, and to satisfy the precondition for stacking orange_block_1 on white_block_1 for constraint 6).

But wait, let's think step by step.

Step 1: Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2. This requires that green_block_1 is clear (which it is) and the arm is empty. So action: unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2. Then putdown green_block_1. Now, green_block_1 is on the table, clear. Orange_block_2 is on white_block_1 and clear. Then, we need to stack red_block_1 on green_block_1. But red_block_1 is under black_block_1. So to get red_block_1, we need to unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1. Then putdown black_block_1. Then unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1. Then stack red_block_1 on green_block_1.

So steps:

1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2
2. putdown green_block_1
3. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1
4. putdown black_block_1
5. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1
6. stack red_block_1 green_block_1

Now, after step 6, red_block_1 is on green_block_1. This allows us to satisfy constraint 8 when we later pick up orange_block_2.

Then, we can proceed to unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1, which is now clear (since green_block_1 was removed). Action: unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1. Then, we can hold orange_block_2. But according to constraint 8, since we're holding orange_block_2 now, there must have been a prior state where red_block_1 is on green_block_1, which step 6 achieved. So that's good.

But wait, after step 6, red_block_1 is on green_block_1. Then when we unstack orange_block_2, we need to handle the other constraints.

But let's see. After step 6:

- green_block_1 has red_block_1 on it (not clear).
- orange_block_2 is on white_block_1 (clear, since we putdown green_block_1 earlier).
So unstacking orange_block_2 from white_block_1 is possible. Then we can hold orange_block_2. Now, to stack it on black_block_1, which is currently on the table (from step 4). Wait, no: step 4 putdown black_block_1, so it's on the table. But the goal is to have orange_block_2 on black_block_1. So we need to stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1, which is on the table. Wait, no. The goal is to have orange_block_2 on black_block_1, regardless of where black_block_1 is. So if black_block_1 is on the table, then stacking orange_block_2 on it would achieve the goal. But according to the initial plan steps, after step 4, black_block_1 is on the table. So we can stack orange_block_2 on it. But then, what about the constraint that "black_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in at least one state. But initially, black_block_1 was not on the table. So that's already satisfied. But the plan may require moving black_block_1 again. Wait, but in step 4, we put black_block_1 on the table. So during the plan, black_block_1 is on the table. But the initial state already has it not on the table, so the constraint is satisfied. However, constraint 2 says that if in any state s, black_block_1 is not on the table, then red_block_1 must be clear at s or after. In the initial state, black_block_1 is not on the table, so we need to ensure red_block_1 is clear at some point. But in step 5, we unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1, so red_block_1 is clear after that. Then in step 6, we stack red_block_1 on green_block_1. So red_block_1 is not clear anymore. But after step 5, red_block_1 is clear (when it's being held). Wait, no: when you unstack red_block_1, you are holding it. So after step 5, you're holding red_block_1. Then when you stack it on green_block_1, green_block_1 is no longer clear. So after step 6, red_block_1 is on green_block_1. So the red_block_1 is not clear. But the constraint 2 requires that if black_block_1 is not on the table in a state, then red_block_1 must be clear in that state or after. Since black_block_1 was moved to the table in step 4, which makes it on the table. So in the initial state, black_block_1 is not on the table, so s is the initial state, and then red_block_1 becomes clear in step 5 (when unstacked). So that satisfies constraint 2.

Now, back to the steps. After step 6, we can unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1 (step 7: unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1). Now holding orange_block_2. Then stack it on black_block_1 (which is on the table). So step 8: stack orange_block_2 black_block_1. This achieves the goal.

But wait, but we have other constraints to satisfy. Let's check:

Constraint 5: must hold orange_block_1 at some point. So we need to pick up orange_block_1. But currently, after step 5, orange_block_1 is on the table and clear (since red_block_1 was unstacked). So in step 5, after unstacking red_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear. So we could then pickup orange_block_1. But why? Because the constraint requires it. So let's insert that after step 5.

Wait, step 5 is unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1. Then, we are holding red_block_1. To pickup orange_block_1, we need to putdown red_block_1 first. Wait, but after step 5, we need to stack red_block_1 on green_block_1 (step 6). So after step 6, red_block_1 is stacked. Then, perhaps after that, we can unstack red_block_1 again to get orange_block_1. But that's complicating things. Alternatively, after step 5, after unstacking red_block_1, we can putdown red_block_1, then pickup orange_block_1, then put it back? But that would add steps. Hmm.

Wait, constraint 5 says that we must have a state where we are holding orange_block_1. So we need to have an action where we pickup orange_block_1. To do that, orange_block_1 must be on the table and clear. After step 5 (unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1), orange_block_1 is on the table and clear. So at that point, we can pickup orange_block_1. But wait, after step 5, we are holding red_block_1. So to pickup orange_block_1, we need to putdown red_block_1 first.

Let me adjust the steps:

After step 5: unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1 (holding red_block_1)

Then step 6: putdown red_block_1 (now red_block_1 is on the table, clear)

Then step 7: pickup orange_block_1 (now holding orange_block_1)

Then step 8: putdown orange_block_1 (but why? Because we need to stack red_block_1 on green_block_1 as per step 6 in previous plan. Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's re-examine.

The original steps I thought of were:

1. unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2.

2. putdown green_block_1.

3. unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1.

4. putdown black_block_1.

5. unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1.

6. stack red_block_1 on green_block_1.

But after step 5, you are holding red_block_1. Then step 6 is stack red_block_1 on green_block_1. But before that, green_block_1 must be clear. Which it is, because we put it down in step 2. So step 6 is possible.

But after step 5, orange_block_1 is clear and on the table. So to satisfy constraint 5 (holding orange_block_1), we need to have a step where we pickup orange_block_1. But in the current steps, after step 5, we are holding red_block_1, then we stack it on green_block_1 (step 6). So after step 6, the arm is empty. Then, we can pickup orange_block_1 (since it's on the table and clear). Then put it down again, but perhaps stack it on white_block_1 to satisfy constraint 6 (orange_block_1 on white_block_1).

So let's insert steps after step 6:

7. pickup orange_block_1

8. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1

Now, stacking orange_block_1 on white_block_1 requires that white_block_1 is clear. But in the current state, white_block_1 has orange_block_2 (since we only removed green_block_1 in step 1). So white_block_1 is not clear. So we need to unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1 first. Wait, this is getting complex.

Alternatively, after step 6, we have:

- orange_block_1 is on the table, clear.

- white_block_1 has orange_block_2, which is clear (since green_block_1 was moved).

So to stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1, we need to clear white_block_1 first. So unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1.

So steps:

7. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1

8. putdown orange_block_2

9. pickup orange_block_1

10. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1

But this is adding more steps. Then, after that, we need to handle the goal of stacking orange_block_2 on black_block_1. So after step 10, we can pick up orange_block_2 again (since it's on the table), then stack it on black_block_1.

But this is making the plan longer. However, the problem requires an optimal plan, so we need to minimize the number of steps. So perhaps there's a way to combine these steps.

Alternatively, maybe after step 6 (stack red_block_1 on green_block_1), we can proceed to unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1 (since it's clear now). Then, we need to satisfy constraint 8 (when holding orange_block_2, there's a prior state with red_block_1 on green_block_1). That's already done in step 6.

So step 7: unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1 (now holding orange_block_2). Then stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1 (which is on the table from step 4). So step 8: stack orange_block_2 black_block_1. This achieves the goal.

But wait, we still need to satisfy constraint 5 (holding orange_block_1) and constraint 6 (orange_block_1 on white_block_1). So we have to include those steps.

So after step 6, we need to:

7. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1 (hold orange_block_2)

But according to constraint 8, this is allowed because step 6 (red on green) was before.

Then, after stacking orange_block_2 on black_block_1 (step 8), the goal is achieved. But we still need to handle the other constraints.

But we need to have a state where we are holding orange_block_1 (constraint 5). So after step 6, the arm is empty. Orange_block_1 is on the table, clear. So we can pickup orange_block_1 (step 7). Then, to satisfy constraint 6 (orange_block_1 on white_block_1), we need to stack it there. But white_block_1 has orange_block_2? No, in step 7, after unstacking orange_block_2 from white_block_1 (step 7), white_block_1 is clear. Wait, no: step 7 is unstacking orange_block_2 from white_block_1, which would make white_block_1 clear. So after step 7, white_block_1 is clear. Then, if we pickup orange_block_1 (step 8), then stack it on white_block_1 (step 9). That satisfies constraint 6.

But let's outline the steps:

1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2

2. putdown green_block_1

3. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1

4. putdown black_block_1

5. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1

6. stack red_block_1 green_block_1

7. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1

8. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1 (achieves the goal)

But now, we need to also handle constraints 5 and 6.

So between step 6 and 7, we need to handle orange_block_1:

After step 6, the arm is empty. Orange_block_1 is on the table, clear.

7. pickup orange_block_1 (satisfies constraint 5)

8. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1 (satisfies constraint 6; now white_block_1 has orange_block_1, which is clear)

Then, to unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1 (since after step 8, white_block_1 has orange_block_1, but originally, white_block_1 had orange_block_2. Wait, no. Initially, white_block_1 had orange_block_2 and green_block_1. After step 1 and 2, green_block_1 is on the table. Orange_block_2 is still on white_block_1. So after step 8, stacking orange_block_1 on white_block_1, white_block_1 now has orange_block_1, which is on top of orange_block_2? Wait, no. Because when you stack, you put the block on top. Wait, white_block_1 initially has orange_block_2. After step 7 (unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1), we take orange_block_2 off. Then step 8 is stacking orange_block_1 on white_block_1. Wait, no. Let me re-express:

Wait, let's correct the steps:

After step 6 (stack red_block_1 on green_block_1):

- green_block_1 is on the table, red_block_1 is on green_block_1.

- orange_block_2 is on white_block_1, clear (since green_block_1 was unstacked earlier).

- black_block_1 is on the table.

- red_block_1 is on green_block_1.

- orange_block_1 is on the table, clear.

So, after step 6, the arm is empty. Now, to pickup orange_block_1 (step 7).

Step 7: pickup orange_block_1

Then, stack it on white_block_1 (step 8). But white_block_1 currently has orange_block_2. So can't stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1 unless orange_block_2 is cleared. So we need to first remove orange_block_2 from white_block_1.

So, revised steps:

After step 6:

7. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1 (now holding orange_block_2)

8. putdown orange_block_2

9. pickup orange_block_1

10. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1

Now, white_block_1 has orange_block_1, which is clear. Orange_block_2 is on the table.

Then, to achieve the goal, we need to stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1.

11. pickup orange_block_2

12. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1

But this makes the plan longer. However, this satisfies all constraints:

- Holding orange_block_1 at step 9 (constraint 5).

- orange_block_1 on white_block_1 at step 10 (constraint 6).

- Holding orange_block_2 at step 11 (constraint 7).

- When holding orange_block_2 (step 11), there's a prior state (step 6) where red_block_1 is on green_block_1 (constraint 8).

- Holding green_block_1 at step 1 (constraint 9). When holding green_block_1 (step 1), after that, we need to have either red_block_2 on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 on black_block_1. But after step 10, orange_block_1 is on white_block_1. So that's not meeting the condition. So perhaps we need to make sure that after holding green_block_1 (step 1), either of those conditions is met. But in the current plan, after step 1, green_block_1 is putdown. So maybe after step 2, green_block_1 is on the table. Then, later steps do not have red_block_2 on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 on black_block_1. So this violates constraint 10.

Ah, this is a problem. So constraint 10 says that if we are holding green_block_1 in state s, then either red_block_2 is on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 is on black_block_1 must hold at s or after.

In step 1, we unstack green_block_1 (holding it). Then in step 2, put it down. So during step 1, we are holding green_block_1. So in the state after step 1 (before step 2), we need to ensure that either red_block_2 is on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 is on black_block_1 at that state or later.

But after step 1, we have green_block_1 in hand. So during step 1's state, we are holding green_block_1. So we need to ensure that either red_block_2 is on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 is on black_block_1 at some point after.

But in the current plan, after step 1, we putdown green_block_1 (step 2), then proceed to unstack black_block_1, etc. So how can we satisfy this constraint?

We need to ensure that after step 1 (when we are holding green_block_1), either red_block_2 is stacked on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 is stacked on black_block_1 at some point.

So in the plan, after step 1, we need to have one of those two conditions.

Option 1: Stack red_block_2 on orange_block_1.

But red_block_2 is on the table, clear. To stack it on orange_block_1, we need to pick it up and stack it. But during step 1, we are holding green_block_1. So after step 2, we can pick up red_block_2 and stack it on orange_block_1.

But that would add steps. Let's see:

After step 2 (putdown green_block_1), then:

3. pickup red_block_2

4. stack red_block_2 orange_block_1

This would satisfy the condition. Then proceed with the previous steps.

But this adds two more steps. However, the problem requires an optimal plan. So perhaps there's a way to avoid this.

Alternatively, after step 10, when orange_block_1 is stacked on white_block_1, maybe we can move it to black_block_1. But that would require unstacking it again.

Alternatively, after step 10 (stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1), we could then move orange_block_1 to black_block_1. But that would require additional steps.

Alternatively, perhaps during the plan, after holding green_block_1 (step 1), we can stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1. But at that point, orange_block_1 has red_block_1 and black_block_1 on top. So it's not clear. So we can't do that.

Wait, after step 3: unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1. Then, black_block_1 is in hand. Then, can we stack black_block_1 on orange_block_1? But orange_block_1 has red_block_1 on it. So to stack black_block_1 on orange_block_1, orange_block_1 must be clear. Which it isn't until after step 5.

Alternatively, after step 5 (unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1), orange_block_1 is clear. Then, we can stack black_block_1 on orange_block_1. Which would make orange_block_1 on top of black_block_1? No, stacking black_block_1 on orange_block_1 would make orange_block_1 under black_block_1. Wait, no: if you stack black_block_1 on orange_block_1, then orange_block_1 is on the table, and black_block_1 is on top. But the goal is to have orange_block_2 on black_block_1. So this might not interfere. But this would satisfy the condition that orange_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, which is one of the options in constraint 10.

So, after step 5, we have red_block_1 in hand. Then step 6: stack red_block_1 on green_block_1.

But instead, perhaps after step 5, we can putdown red_block_1, then pickup black_block_1 (which is on the table from step 4), then stack it on orange_block_1. Then, after that, proceed to stack red_block_1 on green_block_1.

This would make orange_block_1 have black_block_1 on it. But then, orange_block_1 is not clear, so we can't pick it up for constraint 5. Hmm.

Alternatively, let's think of adjusting the plan to meet constraint 10.

After step 1: unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2 (holding green_block_1)

At this state, we are holding green_block_1. To satisfy constraint 10, we need to have either red_block_2 on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 on black_block_1 at this state or later.

So during or after this state, one of those conditions must be true.

Option: After step 1, we can stack green_block_1 on red_block_2, then stack red_block_2 on orange_block_1. But that's adding steps.

Alternatively, after step 1, we can putdown green_block_1, then pickup red_block_2, stack it on orange_block_1. Then continue with the plan.

So steps:

1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2

2. putdown green_block_1

3. pickup red_block_2

4. stack red_block_2 orange_block_1

Now, red_block_2 is on orange_block_1. So this satisfies the condition for constraint 10 (since after holding green_block_1 in step 1, later we have red_block_2 on orange_block_1).

Then proceed with the previous steps:

5. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1

6. putdown black_block_1

7. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1 (but wait, after step 4, orange_block_1 has red_block_2. So red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1, and red_block_2 is on top of red_block_1? No, wait, initial state has red_block_1 on orange_block_1, with black_block_1 on red_block_1. So after step 4, we've stacked red_block_2 on orange_block_1. But orange_block_1 already has red_block_1 on it. So stacking red_block_2 on orange_block_1 is not possible because red_block_1 is on orange_block_1 and is not clear. So this approach is invalid.

So that's not feasible. So perhaps instead of stacking red_block_2 on orange_block_1, we need to stack it after removing red_block_1.

Alternatively, after step 5 (unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1), orange_block_1 is clear. Then, we can stack red_block_2 on orange_block_1.

But after step 5, we are holding red_block_1. So we need to put it down first.

So steps:

5. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1

6. putdown red_block_1

7. pickup red_block_2

8. stack red_block_2 orange_block_1

This would place red_block_2 on orange_block_1. Then, later steps can proceed.

But then, this would satisfy constraint 10, as after holding green_block_1 (step 1), we have red_block_2 on orange_block_1 in step 8.

But this adds several steps, making the plan longer. However, since the problem requires an optimal plan, we need to find the shortest path.

Alternative approach: Find a way to have orange_block_1 on black_block_1. For example, after unstacking black_block_1 (step 3) and putting it down (step 4), then unstack red_block_1 (step 5), then stack red_block_1 on green_block_1 (step 6). Then, pickup black_block_1 (step 7), stack it on orange_block_1 (step 8). Then, orange_block_1 has black_block_1 on it, which would satisfy the condition for constraint 10 (orange_block_1 on black_block_1).

So steps:

1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2

2. putdown green_block_1

3. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1

4. putdown black_block_1

5. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1

6. stack red_block_1 green_block_1

7. pickup black_block_1

8. stack black_block_1 orange_block_1

Now, after step 8, orange_block_1 has black_block_1 on it. This satisfies the second option in constraint 10. Then, after this, we can proceed to handle the other constraints.

But then, we need to pick up orange_block_1 for constraint 5. But after step 8, orange_block_1 is under black_block_1, so it's not clear. So we can't pick it up. So this is a problem.

Alternatively, stack black_block_1 on orange_block_1 after orange_block_1 is clear. Wait, after step 5, orange_block_1 is clear. So after step 5, we can stack black_block_1 on orange_block_1.

So steps:

1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2

2. putdown green_block_1

3. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1

4. putdown black_block_1

5. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1

6. stack red_block_1 green_block_1

7. pickup black_block_1

8. stack black_block_1 orange_block_1

Now, after step 8, black_block_1 is on orange_block_1. Then, we need to pick up orange_block_1. But it's under black_block_1, which is clear. So we can unstack black_block_1 from orange_block_1 (step 9), then putdown black_block_1, then pickup orange_block_1. But this is adding more steps.

This is getting very complicated. Perhaps there's a more optimal way.

Let me try to outline the steps again, considering all constraints:

Required steps:

- Move green_block_1 off orange_block_2 to clear it.

- Move black_block_1 off red_block_1 to clear red_block_1.

- Move red_block_1 off orange_block_1 to clear orange_block_1.

- Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 8 when picking up orange_block_2 later).

- Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1.

- Stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1.

Additionally, need to:

- Pick up orange_block_1 (constraint 5).

- Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1 (constraint 6).

- Ensure that after holding green_block_1, either red_block_2 is on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 is on black_block_1.

Let's try to integrate these steps optimally.

Step 1: unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2 (holding green_block_1)

Step 2: putdown green_block_1

Now, we have held green_block_1, so constraint 9 is satisfied. Now, need to ensure that after this, either red_block_2 is on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 is on black_block_1.

To do this optimally, perhaps after putting down green_block_1, we can stack red_block_2 on orange_block_1. But red_block_2 is on the table, clear. Orange_block_1 is under red_block_1 and black_block_1. So orange_block_1 is not clear. So can't stack red_block_2 on it yet.

So alternative: after step 2, proceed to unstack black_block_1 and red_block_1 to clear orange_block_1, then stack red_block_2 on it.

Steps:

3. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1

4. putdown black_block_1

5. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1

6. putdown red_block_1

7. pickup red_block_2

8. stack red_block_2 orange_block_1 (now red_block_2 is on orange_block_1)

This satisfies constraint 10 (after holding green_block_1, red_block_2 is on orange_block_1).

Then, proceed to stack red_block_1 on green_block_1:

9. pickup red_block_1

10. stack red_block_1 green_block_1

Now, red_block_1 is on green_block_1, satisfying constraint 8 when we later pick up orange_block_2.

Then, unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1:

11. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1

12. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1 (goal achieved)

Also, need to handle constraints 5 and 6:

After step 8, orange_block_1 has red_block_2 on it, so it's not clear. After step 10, red_block_1 is on green_block_1.

We need to pick up orange_block_1, which is under red_block_2. So we need to unstack red_block_2.

But this adds steps:

13. unstack red_block_2 orange_block_1

14. putdown red_block_2

15. pickup orange_block_1

16. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1

But this makes the plan very long. Not optimal.

Alternative approach: Instead of stacking red_block_2 on orange_block_1, stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1.

After step 4 (putdown black_block_1), we can:

5. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1

6. stack red_block_1 green_block_1

7. pickup black_block_1

8. stack black_block_1 orange_block_1

Now, orange_block_1 has black_block_1 on it. This satisfies constraint 10.

Then, to pick up orange_block_1, we need to unstack black_block_1:

9. unstack black_block_1 orange_block_1

10. putdown black_block_1

11. pickup orange_block_1

12. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1

Now, this adds steps but satisfies constraints 5 and 6.

Then, unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1 (which is now clear after step 12):

13. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1

14. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1

This achieves the goal.

But this plan is quite long. Let's count the steps:

1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2

2. putdown green_block_1

3. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1

4. putdown black_block_1

5. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1

6. stack red_block_1 green_block_1

7. pickup black_block_1

8. stack black_block_1 orange_block_1

9. unstack black_block_1 orange_block_1

10. putdown black_block_1

11. pickup orange_block_1

12. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1

13. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1

14. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1

That's 14 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternative plan:

Perhaps after stacking black_block_1 on orange_block_1 (step 8), we can directly use that to satisfy constraint 10, and then proceed to pickup orange_block_1 by unstacking black_block_1. But this adds steps.

Alternatively, after step 8, leave black_block_1 on orange_block_1 and find another way to satisfy constraint 5 (holding orange_block_1). But since orange_block_1 is under black_block_1, which is clear, we can unstack black_block_1, put it down, then pickup orange_block_1.

But this adds steps.

Alternatively, find a way to pick up orange_block_1 before stacking black_block_1 on it. But that would require clearing orange_block_1 first.

Wait, after step 5: unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear. So before stacking black_block_1 on it, we can pickup orange_block_1.

So:

1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2

2. putdown green_block_1

3. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1

4. putdown black_block_1

5. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1

6. pickup orange_block_1 (constraint 5)

7. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1 (constraint 6)

8. putdown red_block_1 (from step 5)

9. stack red_block_1 green_block_1

10. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1 (now white_block_1 is clear)

11. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1

But after step 7, orange_block_1 is on white_block_1. Then, we need to unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1, but white_block_1 now has orange_block_1. So this approach is incorrect.

This indicates that the steps need to be carefully ordered.

Given the complexity, perhaps the optimal plan involves:

1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2

2. stack green_block_1 red_block_2

This way, after holding green_block_1 (step 1), we stack it on red_block_2. Then, later, we can stack red_block_2 on orange_block_1. But this might not directly help.

Alternatively, after step 1, we can stack green_block_1 on orange_block_1, but that's not possible since orange_block_1 is not clear.

Given the time constraints, I think the initial steps I outlined may need to be adjusted to accommodate constraint 10 by ensuring that after holding green_block_1, we have red_block_2 on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 on black_block_1.

The most straightforward way is to ensure that after step 1 (holding green_block_1), we later stack red_block_2 on orange_block_1. This requires:

After step 1 and 2 (putdown green_block_1), then unstack black_block_1, red_block_1, and then stack red_block_2 on orange_block_1.

But this requires several steps.

Alternatively, during the plan, after stacking orange_block_2 on black_block_1 (achieving the goal), we can stack red_block_2 on orange_block_1. But this would add steps after the goal is achieved, which is unnecessary.

Alternatively, perhaps after achieving the goal, we can do it. But that would add steps, which is not optimal.

This seems very challenging. Given the time I have, I'll proceed to outline a possible plan that meets all constraints, even if it's longer, but then see if there's a shorter way.

Final steps:

1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2 (hold green_block_1; satisfies constraint 9)

2. putdown green_block_1

3. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1

4. putdown black_block_1

5. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1

6. stack red_block_1 green_block_1 (satisfies constraint 8)

7. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1 (hold orange_block_2; constraint 7)

8. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1 (goal achieved)

But need to satisfy constraints 5,6, and 10.

To satisfy constraint 5 (hold orange_block_1), after step 5, we can pickup orange_block_1.

So between step 5 and 6:

5. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1

6. pickup orange_block_1 (constraint 5)

7. putdown orange_block_1

8. stack red_block_1 green_block_1

9. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1

10. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1

But step 7: putdown orange_block_1. Then step 8: stack red_block_1 on green_block_1. Now, after step 8, red_block_1 is on green_block_1.

Then step 9: unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1.

But after step 7, orange_block_1 is on the table, clear. To satisfy constraint 6 (orange_block_1 on white_block_1), we can:

9. pickup orange_block_1

10. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1

Then unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1 (which is now under orange_block_1, but that's not possible. So this approach is incorrect.

Alternative steps:

1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2

2. putdown green_block_1

3. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1

4. putdown black_block_1

5. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1

6. pickup orange_block_1 (constraint 5)

7. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1 (constraint 6)

8. putdown red_block_1 (from step 5)

9. stack red_block_1 green_block_1

10. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1

11. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1

This plan:

Steps 1-11:

1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2

2. putdown green_block_1

3. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1

4. putdown black_block_1

5. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1

6. pickup orange_block_1

7. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1

8. putdown red_block_1

9. stack red_block_1 green_block_1

10. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1

11. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1

Now, check constraints:

- Constraint 10: After holding green_block_1 (step 1), we need red_block_2 on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 on black_block_1. In this plan, orange_block_1 is stacked on white_block_1 (step 7), which doesn't meet either condition. So this violates constraint 10.

Therefore, this plan is invalid.

To satisfy constraint 10, after holding green_block_1 (step 1), we must have one of the two conditions.

So in the current plan, after step 1, we need to make sure that either red_block_2 is on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 is on black_block_1.

Let's adjust the plan to include stacking red_block_2 on orange_block_1 after step 2.

Steps:

1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2

2. putdown green_block_1

3. pickup red_block_2

4. stack red_block_2 orange_block_1

Now, after step 4, red_block_2 is on orange_block_1. This satisfies constraint 10.

Then proceed:

5. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1

6. putdown black_block_1

7. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1 (but orange_block_1 has red_block_2 on it. So red_block_1 is under black_block_1? No, initial state: orange_block_1 has red_block_1, which has black_block_1 on it. So after step 4, red_block_2 is on orange_block_1, which is under red_block_1 and black_block_1. Wait, this is not possible. Because red_block_1 is on orange_block_1, and black_block_1 is on red_block_1. So when we stack red_block_2 on orange_block_1, orange_block_1 has red_block_1 on it. So red_block_2 cannot be stacked on orange_block_1 because it's not clear. Thus, this approach is invalid.

Thus, the only way to satisfy constraint 10 is to stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1.

So steps:

After step 4 (putdown black_block_1), we can:

5. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1

6. stack red_block_1 green_block_1

7. pickup black_block_1

8. stack black_block_1 orange_block_1 (now orange_block_1 is under black_block_1, satisfying constraint 10)

9. unstack black_block_1 orange_block_1 (to clear orange_block_1 for pickup)

10. putdown black_block_1

11. pickup orange_block_1 (constraint 5)

12. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1 (constraint 6)

13. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1

14. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1

This plan includes all necessary steps but is quite long. However, considering all constraints, this seems necessary.

The final steps:

```
1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2
2. putdown green_block_1
3. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1
4. putdown black_block_1
5. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1
6. stack red_block_1 green_block_1
7. pickup black_block_1
8. stack black_block_1 orange_block_1
9. unstack black_block_1 orange_block_1
10. putdown black_block_1
11. pickup orange_block_1
12. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1
13. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1
14. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1
```

Now, let's verify all constraints:

- Constraint 1: black_block_1 not on table in at least one state. Initially, it's on red_block_1. Also, in steps 3-4, it's moved to the table. But after step 8, it's on orange_block_1. So yes.

- Constraint 2: Whenever black_block_1 is not on the table (initial state and steps 8-9), red_block_1 must be clear. After step 5, red_block_1 is cleared (unstacked and stacked on green_block_1). So red_block_1 is clear after step 5, then stacked on green_block_1 (step 6). So in the initial state, red_block_1 is not clear, but after step 5, it is. So constraint 2 is satisfied.

- Constraint 3: white_block_1 clear at least once. After step 13, white_block_1 is clear.

- Constraint 4: When white_block_1 is clear (step 13), there must be a prior state where orange_block_1 is clear. Orange_block_1 is cleared in step 5 (unstacked) and step 11 (picked up). So yes.

- Constraint 5: Holding orange_block_1 (step 11).

- Constraint 6: orange_block_1 on white_block_1 (step 12).

- Constraint 7: Holding orange_block_2 (step 13).

- Constraint 8: When holding orange_block_2 (step 13), prior state with red_block_1 on green_block_1 (step 6).

- Constraint 9: Holding green_block_1 (step 1).

- Constraint 10: When holding green_block_1 (step 1), after that, orange_block_1 is on black_block_1 (step 8).

- Constraint 11: black_block_1 not on white_block_1. True throughout.

- Constraint 12: When black_block_1 is not on white_block_1 (always true), red_block_1 must be clear after. After step 5, red_block_1 is clear.

This plan meets all constraints and the goal. However, it's 14 steps. But perhaps there's a shorter way.

Alternative approach: After step 8 (stack black_block_1 on orange_block_1), leave it there. Then, when needing to pick up orange_block_1, unstack black_block_1.

But steps would be:

1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2

2. putdown green_block_1

3. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1

4. putdown black_block_1

5. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1

6. stack red_block_1 green_block_1

7. pickup black_block_1

8. stack black_block_1 orange_block_1 (satisfies constraint 10)

9. unstack black_block_1 orange_block_1

10. putdown black_block_1

11. pickup orange_block_1 (constraint 5)

12. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1 (constraint 6)

13. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1

14. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1

Same as before. Still 14 steps.

Is there a way to reduce steps?

Perhaps after step 8, instead of putting down black_block_1, use it for the goal.

Wait, the goal is to have orange_block_2 on black_block_1. If black_block_1 is on orange_block_1 (step 8), then stacking orange_block_2 on black_block_1 would require black_block_1 to be clear. But after step 8, black_block_1 has nothing on it (since we just stacked it), so it's clear. So steps:

After step 8:

9. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1 (since white_block_1 is clear after step 1 and 2)

10. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1

But this would require:

Steps 1-8:

1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2

2. putdown green_block_1

3. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1

4. putdown black_block_1

5. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1

6. stack red_block_1 green_block_1

7. pickup black_block_1

8. stack black_block_1 orange_block_1

9. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1

10. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1

Now, we need to handle constraints 5 and 6:

After step 5, orange_block_1 is clear. So after step 5, we can pickup orange_block_1 (step 6.5):

But this would disrupt the flow.

Alternatively, after step 8, we have:

- black_block_1 is on orange_block_1.

- white_block_1 has orange_block_2 (clear).

So to stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1, need to unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1 (step 9), then stack it on black_block_1 (step 10). This achieves the goal.

But we still need to satisfy constraints 5 and 6:

- Holding orange_block_1 (constraint 5): Need to pick it up. But it's under black_block_1. So step 11: unstack black_block_1 orange_block_1, putdown black_block_1, then pickup orange_block_1.

But this adds steps:

11. unstack black_block_1 orange_block_1

12. putdown black_block_1

13. pickup orange_block_1

14. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1

But this makes the plan 14 steps again.

Alternatively, after step 10 (goal achieved), we can proceed to handle constraints 5 and 6. But that would require additional steps after the goal is achieved, which is unnecessary.

Thus, it seems that the minimal plan requires 14 steps. However, perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, after step 5, orange_block_1 is clear. So can we pickup orange_block_1 then stack it on white_block_1 before stacking black_block_1 on it.

Steps:

1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2

2. putdown green_block_1

3. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1

4. putdown black_block_1

5. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1

6. pickup orange_block_1 (constraint 5)

7. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1 (constraint 6)

8. putdown red_block_1 (from step 5)

9. stack red_block_1 green_block_1 (constraint 8)

10. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1

11. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1 (goal)

Now, this plan has 11 steps. But need to check constraint 10.

Constraint 10: After holding green_block_1 (step 1), either red_block_2 is on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 is on black_block_1. In this plan, orange_block_1 is on white_block_1. So neither condition is met. Thus, this plan violates constraint 10.

Therefore, this approach is invalid.

Thus, the minimal plan that satisfies all constraints requires 14 steps. But since the user asks for an optimal plan with minimal steps, perhaps there's a way to combine some steps.

Alternative idea: After step 5 (unstack red_block_1), instead of stacking it on green_block_1, stack it on red_block_2. But this doesn't help.

Alternatively, after step 5, stack red_block_1 on black_block_1, but that doesn't help with constraints.

Alternatively, after step 5, put red_block_1 on the table, then stack red_block_2 on orange_block_1. Then proceed.

Steps:

1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2

2. putdown green_block_1

3. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1

4. putdown black_block_1

5. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1

6. putdown red_block_1

7. pickup red_block_2

8. stack red_block_2 orange_block_1 (satisfies constraint 10)

9. stack red_block_1 green_block_1 (constraint 8)

10. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1

11. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1 (goal)

12. pickup orange_block_1

13. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1 (constraint 6)

But this requires 13 steps and still need to pickup orange_block_1 (step 12). But after step 8, orange_block_1 has red_block_2 on it. So to pickup orange_block_1, need to unstack red_block_2:

12. unstack red_block_2 orange_block_1

13. putdown red_block_2

14. pickup orange_block_1

15. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1

Thus, making it 15 steps. Not better.

Given all these considerations, I think the minimal plan that satisfies all constraints is 14 steps as previously outlined.
