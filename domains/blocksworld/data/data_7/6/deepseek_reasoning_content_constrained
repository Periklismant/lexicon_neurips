Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld planning problem. The goal is to get white_block_1 on the table, but there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy along the way. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the goal, then look at each constraint to make sure the plan meets them all.

First, the initial state:

- green_block_1 is on the table.
- black_block_1 is on the table, clear.
- black_block_2 is on the table.
- yellow_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 and is clear.
- white_block_1 is on top of black_block_2.
- black_block_3 is on top of white_block_1.
- black_block_4 is on top of black_block_3, and black_block_4 is clear.

So the stack on black_block_2 is black_block_2 (table) -> white_block_1 -> black_block_3 -> black_block_4. All clear except the bottom blocks. The robot is holding nothing.

The goal is to have white_block_1 on the table. So we need to move white_block_1 from black_block_2 to the table. But to do that, we have to unstack black_block_4, then black_block_3, then white_block_1. Wait, but the constraints might affect this.

Let's list the constraints one by one:

1. At least one state must have green_block_1 on top of white_block_1 and the robot is holding black_block_1.
2. At least one state must have the robot holding white_block_1.
3. If the robot is holding white_block_1 in state s, then either black_block_1 is not clear or black_block_4 is not clear in s or a later state.
4. At least one state must have black_block_3 not on top of yellow_block_1. (Which is already true, since black_block_3 is on white_block_1 initially. So maybe this is automatically satisfied? But need to check if the problem requires this to be true in some state during the plan. Since the initial state has black_block_3 not on yellow_block_1, this might already be satisfied. But perhaps the plan needs to ensure that this remains true or something. Wait, the constraint says "must hold in at least one state", so the initial state counts. But maybe the problem expects the plan to include some action that changes it, but no—since the initial state already meets it, this constraint is already satisfied. But maybe the plan must not cause it to be false in all states? Hmm. Wait, the initial state is part of the plan's states. So as long as the initial state counts, this constraint is satisfied. So maybe this constraint is automatically met. But I'll have to check if any action in the plan could make black_block_3 on top of yellow_block_1, which would violate the fourth constraint's requirement that in some state it's not. But since the initial state already satisfies it, it's okay. But perhaps the problem requires that in the plan's steps, there's a state (could be initial) where it's true. So maybe this constraint is already met. But I'll need to confirm.

5. If in some state s, black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1 (which is always true except if we stack black_block_3 on yellow_block_1), then either black_block_2 is not on the table or the robot is holding green_block_1 in s or a later state. Since in the initial state, black_block_3 is not on yellow_block_1, the condition triggers, so the implication is that in the initial state or after, either black_block_2 is not on the table (it starts on the table) or the robot is holding green_block_1. So in the plan, after the initial state, we need to ensure that if any step makes black_block_3 not on yellow_block_1 (which it already is), then either black_block_2 is moved from the table or green_block_1 is picked up at some point. But since black_block_2 is part of the stack that we need to disassemble to get white_block_1 down, we will move it. Wait, no—the stack is black_block_2 (table) with white_block_1 on it, etc. To get white_block_1 on the table, we need to unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3, then unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1, then unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2. Wait, but wait—unstacking white_block_1 from black_block_2 requires that white_block_1 is clear. But initially, white_block_1 has black_block_3 on it, so we can't unstack white_block_1 until we remove black_block_3 and black_block_4.

So steps needed to get white_block_1 on table:

1. Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3.
2. Put down black_block_4 somewhere.
3. Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1.
4. Put down black_block_3 somewhere.
5. Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2.
6. Put down white_block_1. (This achieves the goal.)

But each action has preconditions and effects.

Let's go step by step:

Initial state: black_block_4 is on black_block_3, which is on white_block_1, which is on black_block_2. So to unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3, the preconditions are: black_block_4 is clear (yes), the robot is not holding anything (yes). So unstack black_block_4 black_block_3. Then, the robot is holding black_block_4. Then put it down. Then unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1 (after putting down black_block_4). Then put down black_block_3. Then unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2 (since now white_block_1 is clear), put it down.

But the constraints complicate things. Let's check each:

Constraint 1: At some state, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, and robot is holding black_block_1. So we need to stack green_block_1 onto white_block_1 and have the robot hold black_block_1 at the same time. But how? Because to stack green_block_1 on white_block_1, we need to pick up green_block_1 (which is under yellow_block_1 in the initial state). Wait, initial state: yellow_block_1 is on green_block_1 and is clear. So green_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top. So to pick up green_block_1, we need to first remove yellow_block_1. But the problem's goal doesn't require moving yellow_block_1. So if we need to stack green_block_1 onto white_block_1, that would require first moving yellow_block_1 off green_block_1. Then green_block_1 can be picked up. Then stack it onto white_block_1. But how to get white_block_1 clear? Because white_block_1 is under black_block_3 and black_block_4. Wait, but after we remove black_block_4 and black_block_3, white_block_1 would be clear. So maybe after step 5 (after unstacking black_block_3 from white_block_1 and putting it down), white_block_1 is clear, so we can stack green_block_1 onto it. But then we need to have the robot holding black_block_1 in the same state. So perhaps after stacking green_block_1 on white_block_1, we need to pickup black_block_1. But the constraint says that in the same state, both conditions must hold. So the action that causes green_block_1 to be on white_block_1 is 'stack green_block_1 white_block_1', which requires the robot to be holding green_block_1. Then, after stacking, the robot is no longer holding anything. Then, to hold black_block_1, the robot would need to pickup black_block_1. So the state after stacking would have green_block_1 on white_block_1, and the robot is empty. Then, the next action could be pickup black_block_1, so in that state, the robot is holding black_block_1. So in that state (after stack and before putdown or anything else), the conditions for constraint 1 are met: green on white, and holding black_block_1. So this would require inserting these steps into the plan.

But this complicates the plan. Let's see.

Original steps to get white_block_1 on table:

1. unstack black_block_4 black_block_3 → hold black_block_4
2. putdown black_block_4 → on table, clear
3. unstack black_block_3 white_block_1 → hold black_block_3
4. putdown black_block_3 → on table, clear
5. unstack white_block_1 black_block_2 → hold white_block_1
6. putdown white_block_1 → done.

But to meet constraint 1, we need to have green_block_1 on white_block_1 and hold black_block_1. So after step 5, when we have white_block_1 in hand, we can't proceed to put it down yet. Instead, perhaps after step 4, when black_block_3 is on the table, we can work on the green_block_1 and black_block_1.

Wait, but green_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on it. So first, we need to move yellow_block_1. To pickup green_block_1, we need to first unstack yellow_block_1 from it.

So steps:

After step 4 (putdown black_block_3):

7. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1 → hold yellow_block_1
8. putdown yellow_block_1 → now green_block_1 is clear.
9. pickup green_block_1 → now holding green_block_1
10. stack green_block_1 white_block_1 → now green is on white, robot is empty
11. pickup black_block_1 → now holding black_block_1. At this state, constraint 1 is satisfied: green on white, holding black_block_1.

But this is inserting steps 7-11 into the plan. Then, after that, we can proceed to unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2, but wait, after stacking green_block_1 onto white_block_1, white_block_1 is now under green_block_1. So white_block_1 is no longer clear (since green_block_1 is on top). So we can't unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2 unless we first remove green_block_1. But that would complicate things. Because the goal is to have white_block_1 on the table, but if we stack green_block_1 on white_block_1, then white_block_1 is not on the table. So this approach would not work, because the goal requires white_block_1 to be on the table. So stacking green on white would make white not on the table, but the goal is to have white on the table. Therefore, this approach would conflict with the goal.

Hmm, so perhaps the stacking of green on white is temporary and needs to be undone. But that complicates the plan. Alternatively, maybe we can stack green on white after moving white to the table, but that would be after the goal is achieved, but the constraint requires that in some state during the plan, green is on white. So perhaps after achieving the goal, we can stack green on white, then do something else. But then we need to hold black_block_1 at the same time. Let me think.

Wait, the goal is to have white_block_1 on the table. So once we put white_block_1 on the table (step 6 in the original plan), the goal is achieved. But the constraints require that in some state, green is on white. So perhaps after putting white on the table, we can stack green on it. Then pick up black_block_1. But the constraint requires that in the same state, both conditions hold. So during the stacking of green on white, the robot is holding green, then after stacking, the robot is empty. Then, to hold black_block_1, we need to pick it up. So in the state after stacking, green is on white, and the robot is empty. Then, when we pick up black_block_1, the robot is holding it, but green is still on white. So in that state (after pickup black_block_1), both conditions are true: green on white and holding black_block_1. So that could satisfy constraint 1.

But then we have to do this after achieving the goal. But the goal is only about the final state. So the final state can have green on white and the robot holding black_block_1? No, because the goal is white on table. If after putting white on table, we stack green on it, then white is on table with green on top, so the goal is still satisfied. Then we can pick up black_block_1. So the final state would be white on table with green on top, and the robot holding black_block_1, but the goal is just white on table. That's acceptable. But then we need to make sure that all other constraints are met.

But this approach adds steps after achieving the goal, which might not be optimal. But since the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible), maybe there's a way to satisfy the constraints while achieving the goal with minimal steps.

Alternatively, perhaps during the process of moving white_block_1 to the table, we can arrange to have green_block_1 on white_block_1 temporarily. For example:

After moving black_block_4 and black_block_3, white_block_1 is clear. Then, instead of directly unstacking white_block_1, we first stack green_block_1 onto it, then unstack it again. But that would require additional steps. Let's outline:

Original steps up to step 4: black_block_4 and black_block_3 are on the table. White_block_1 is on black_block_2, clear. So:

5. unstack white_block_1 black_block_2 → hold white_block_1
6. putdown white_block_1 → goal achieved.

But to satisfy constraint 1, we need to have green on white and hold black_block_1. So after step 5, when holding white_block_1, we can't do that. So maybe after putting down white_block_1 (step 6), we can then work on moving green_block_1 onto it. But that's after the goal is achieved. So steps:

6. putdown white_block_1
7. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1 → hold yellow
8. putdown yellow
9. pickup green_block_1
10. stack green_block_1 white_block_1 → now green is on white
11. pickup black_block_1 → now holding black_block_1.

In the state after step 10, green is on white, and the robot is empty. Then after step 11, the robot is holding black_block_1. So in the state after step 11, both conditions of constraint 1 are met. So that's two additional steps (7-11) after achieving the goal. But this makes the plan longer. But maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, maybe during the process of moving white_block_1, we can stack green on it and then unstack, but that complicates things. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving black_block_4 and black_block_3, we can:

5. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2 → hold white
6. stack white_block_1 onto green_block_1 → but green_block_1 has yellow on it. So can't stack on green_block_1 unless it's clear. So first, remove yellow_block_1.

So:

After step 4 (black_block_3 on table):

5. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1 → hold yellow
6. putdown yellow
7. pickup green_block_1 → hold green
8. stack green_block_1 white_block_1 → now green is on white (but white is being held by the robot? No, after step 5, white is still on black_block_2. Wait, this is getting confusing.

Wait, let's re-express the steps:

Original steps to get white_block_1 down:

1. unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3 → hold 4
2. putdown 4
3. unstack black_block_3 from white → hold 3
4. putdown 3
5. unstack white from black_block_2 → hold white
6. putdown white → goal achieved.

But to satisfy constraint 1, need green on white and holding black_block_1. So after step 6, white is on table. Then:

7. unstack yellow from green → hold yellow
8. putdown yellow
9. pickup green → hold green
10. stack green on white → now green is on white (which is on table)
11. pickup black_block_1 → hold black_block_1.

At step 11, the state has green on white and robot holding black_block_1. So constraint 1 is satisfied. But this adds 5 steps after the goal is achieved. That's not optimal. But maybe there's a way to combine steps.

Alternatively, maybe during the process, after step 5 (holding white), instead of putting it down immediately, we can stack it on green_block_1. But green_block_1 has yellow on it. So we need to first remove yellow.

Wait, maybe during the plan:

After step 5 (holding white_block_1):

6. unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1 → but can't do that while holding white. Because to unstack, the robot must be empty. So:

After step 5, robot is holding white. Need to put it down first.

So:

6. putdown white_block_1 → now white is on table (goal achieved)
7. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1 → hold yellow
8. putdown yellow
9. pickup green_block_1 → hold green
10. stack green_block_1 white_block_1 → green on white
11. pickup black_block_1 → hold black_block_1.

Again, steps 7-11. But this is after achieving the goal. The problem requires the plan to bring about the goal, so the final state must have white on table. But these additional steps after that are allowed as long as the goal remains true. Stacking green on white doesn't affect the goal, since white is still on the table. So this is acceptable. But the plan length increases, which may not be optimal.

But perhaps there's a way to integrate some of these steps earlier to satisfy constraints without adding steps. Let's look at other constraints.

Constraint 2: At least one state must have the robot holding white_block_1. That's already satisfied in step 5 of the original plan (when we unstack white from black_block_2).

Constraint 3: If in some state s, the robot is holding white_block_1, then in s or a later state, either black_block_1 is not clear or black_block_4 is not clear. So after step 5 (holding white), we need to ensure that in some subsequent step, either black_block_1 has a block on top or black_block_4 is not clear. In the original plan, after step 5, we put down white_block_1 (step 6). Then, in the steps after, we have to make sure that either black_block_1 is not clear or black_block_4 is not clear. How?

In the original plan, after step 6, the only blocks on table are green_block_1 (with yellow on it), black_block_1 (clear), black_block_2 (clear), black_block_4 (on table, clear), black_block_3 (on table, clear), white_block_1 (on table), and yellow_block_1 (on table). So black_block_1 is clear. black_block_4 is on table and clear. So to satisfy constraint 3, after step 5 (holding white), we need to perform an action that makes either black_block_1 not clear or black_block_4 not clear.

For example, after step 5, before putting down white, we could stack white on black_block_1, but that would require black_block_1 to be clear (which it is). But stacking white on black_block_1 would make white on black_block_1, which is not the goal. Then, we'd have to unstack it again. But that's extra steps.

Alternatively, after putting down white (step 6), we can stack another block on black_block_1. For example, pick up black_block_4 (which is on table) and stack it on black_block_1. Then, black_block_1 is not clear. So in step 7: pickup black_block_4, stack on black_block_1. This would satisfy the constraint, because after step 5 (holding white), in a later step (step 7), black_block_1 is not clear. But this adds steps. But perhaps it's necessary.

Alternatively, during the process, after step 5, before putting down white, we can stack white on black_block_1, then unstack it again. But that's two extra steps.

But this is getting complicated. Let's outline the steps again with all constraints in mind.

Let's try to build the plan step by step, ensuring all constraints are met.

First, the main goal is to have white_block_1 on the table. To do that, we need to unstack black_block_4, black_block_3, and white_block_1.

Initial steps:

1. unstack black_block_4 black_block_3 → hold 4
2. putdown 4 → now 4 is on table
3. unstack black_block_3 white_block_1 → hold 3
4. putdown 3 → now 3 is on table
5. unstack white_block_1 black_block_2 → hold white (constraint 2 satisfied here)
6. putdown white → goal achieved (now white is on table)

Now, check constraints:

Constraint 1: Need a state where green_block_1 is on white and holding black_block_1. So after step 6, white is on table. We can then:

7. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1 → requires yellow is clear (it is, as per initial state)
8. putdown yellow
9. pickup green_block_1 → now holding green
10. stack green_block_1 white_block_1 → green on white
11. putdown green_block_1? No, stack already places it. Then, to hold black_block_1:
11. pickup black_block_1 → now holding black_block_1.

At step 11, the state has green on white and robot holding black_block_1. So constraint 1 is satisfied.

But this adds 5 steps (7-11). But maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, during the main steps, after unstacking white_block_1 (step 5), we can stack it on green_block_1. But green_block_1 has yellow on it. So first, remove yellow.

So steps:

1. unstack 4 from 3 → hold 4
2. putdown 4
3. unstack 3 from white → hold 3
4. putdown 3
5. unstack yellow from green → hold yellow (requires robot not holding anything, which is true after step 4)
6. putdown yellow
7. pickup green → hold green
8. stack green on white (but white is still on black_block_2, so we need to unstack it first. Wait, no. At this point, after step 4, white is still on black_block_2, with black_block_3 and 4 removed. So steps 5-8:

After step 4 (putdown 3):

5. unstack yellow from green → hold yellow
6. putdown yellow
7. pickup green → hold green
8. stack green on white_block_1 (which is on black_block_2). But to stack green on white_block_1, white_block_1 must be clear. Which it is, because we removed black_block_3 and 4. So step 8: stack green_block_1 white_block_1 → green is on white, which is on black_block_2. Then, after stacking, white_block_1 is not clear (since green is on top). So we can't unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2 anymore. This is a problem because the goal is to have white on table. So this approach would prevent achieving the goal. Thus, this path is invalid.

Alternative approach: after stacking green on white_block_1 (which is on black_block_2), we need to unstack green to get white_block_1 clear again. But that would require additional steps.

Hmm. This is getting too convoluted. Maybe the optimal plan requires the initial approach plus the additional steps to meet constraint 1, resulting in a longer plan. But perhaps there's a way to satisfy the constraints with fewer steps by combining actions.

Looking at other constraints:

Constraint 4: At least one state where black_block_3 is not on yellow_block_1. Since in initial state, black_block_3 is on white_block_1, this is already satisfied. So no action needed here.

Constraint 5: If black_block_3 is not on yellow (which is always true), then in that state or later, either black_block_2 is not on table or robot is holding green. In the initial state, black_block_3 is not on yellow, so the implication is that either black_block_2 is not on table (it is on table) or robot holds green (not initially). So after the initial state, we need to ensure that at some point, black_block_2 is not on table or robot holds green. In the original plan, step 5 (unstack white from black_block_2) requires that black_block_2 has white on it. After unstacking, black_block_2 is clear. So black_block_2 remains on the table. So in the original plan, after step 5, black_block_2 is still on table. So to satisfy constraint 5, since the initial state triggers the condition (black_block_3 not on yellow), we need to ensure that in some subsequent state, either black_block_2 is not on table or robot holds green. But in the original plan, after step 5, black_block_2 is still on table, and the robot is holding white. Then in step 6, the robot puts down white. So in step 6, black_block_2 is still on table. So the condition isn't met. Therefore, we need to either move black_block_2 off the table or have the robot hold green at some point. Moving black_block_2 off the table would require stacking something on it, but in the original plan, nothing is stacked on black_block_2 after white is removed. So to satisfy constraint 5, we need to either:

- Move black_block_2 off the table (unlikely, since it's on the table initially and nothing is stacked on it except white, which is removed). But you can't move the table, so black_block_2 remains on the table unless it's picked up. But blocks can't be picked up if they are on the table and have something on top. Since after step 5, black_block_2 is clear, we could pick it up. For example:

After step 6 (putdown white):

7. pickup black_block_2 → requires it's clear (yes)
8. putdown black_block_2 → but it's already on the table. No effect. Wait, no. The action 'putdown' places the block on the table. If you pick up a block from the table and put it down again, it's still on the table. So that doesn't help. Alternatively, stack black_block_2 on another block. For example, after step 6, stack black_block_2 on black_block_1. But that would require picking up black_block_2 (step 7), then stacking on black_block_1 (step 8). Then black_block_2 is not on table. This would satisfy constraint 5. But this adds two steps. Alternatively, during the plan, have the robot hold green_block_1. For example, after step 6, the robot could pickup green_block_1. But green_block_1 has yellow on it initially, so we need to first remove yellow.

So steps:

After step 6 (putdown white):

7. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1 → hold yellow
8. putdown yellow
9. pickup green_block_1 → hold green (now satisfies constraint 5 because robot is holding green)

This adds three steps, but also satisfies constraint 9 (which requires holding green in at least one state). So this could kill two birds with one stone: satisfying constraint 5 and 9.

Constraint 9: At least one state where robot is holding green_block_1. So steps 7-9 achieve that.

Constraint 5: After the initial state (which satisfies the antecedent), in some later state, either black_block_2 is not on table or robot holds green. In this case, step 9 has robot holding green, so constraint 5 is satisfied.

Constraint 8: At least one state where black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1. In the initial state, black_block_4 is on black_block_3, not yellow. So this is already satisfied. So no action needed.

Constraint 6: In every state, black_block_3 is not on the table. Wait, wait: the constraint says "black_block_3 is not on the table" must hold in every state. But in the initial state, black_block_3 is on white_block_1, which is on black_block_2. So it's not on the table. But after step 4 of the original plan, we put down black_block_3 on the table. That would violate constraint 6. Oh, this is a problem. The original plan has step 4 as putdown black_block_3, which places it on the table. But constraint 6 requires that in every state, black_block_3 is not on the table. So putting black_block_3 on the table is forbidden.

Oh! This is a critical point. I missed that constraint 6 says "black_block_3 is not on the table" in every state. So any action that results in black_block_3 being on the table is invalid. So the original plan is invalid because step 4 is putdown black_block_3, which places it on the table, violating constraint 6.

This changes everything. So we cannot put black_block_3 on the table at any point. Therefore, after unstacking black_block_3 from white_block_1 (step 3), we can't put it down. So what can we do with it? We have to stack it on another block. But where?

We need to find a place to stack black_block_3. But the blocks available are green_block_1 (has yellow on top), black_block_1 (clear on table), black_block_2 (has white_block_1, which we need to clear), black_block_4 (on table after step 2), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1), white_block_1 (on black_block_2), and others.

Wait, after step 3, we're holding black_block_3. We can't put it down, so must stack it on a clear block. The available clear blocks after step 3 are:

- black_block_1 (clear)
- black_block_4 (on table, clear after step 2)
- yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear)
- green_block_1 has yellow on top, so not clear.
- black_block_2 has white_block_1, which is under black_block_3 (but we've unstacked black_block_3, so white_block_1 is clear now?
Wait, no. After step 3: unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1. Before that, white_block_1 has black_block_3 on top. After unstacking, white_block_1 is clear. So in step 3, after unstacking, white_block_1 is clear. So black_block_2 has white_block_1 on it, which is now clear. So the available clear blocks are:

- black_block_1 (clear on table)
- black_block_4 (clear on table)
- yellow_block_1 (clear on green_block_1)
- white_block_1 (clear on black_block_2)

So possible options to stack black_block_3:

Option 1: stack on black_block_1. Then black_block_1 is no longer clear.

Option 2: stack on black_block_4.

Option 3: stack on yellow_block_1.

Option 4: stack on white_block_1.

Let's consider each:

Option 1: stack black_block_3 on black_block_1.

But after that, black_block_1 is not clear. Then, when we need to pickup black_block_1 for constraint 1, we would have to unstack black_block_3 from it. But that's possible.

Option 2: stack on black_block_4. But black_block_4 is on the table, clear. After stacking, black_block_4 is not clear. Then, if we need to use black_block_4 for anything else, we can.

Option 3: stack on yellow_block_1. But yellow_block_1 is on green_block_1. So stacking black_block_3 on yellow_block_1 would require yellow_block_1 to be clear, which it is. But then, we have black_block_3 on yellow_block_1, which is on green_block_1. This might interfere with other constraints, but let's see.

Option 4: stack on white_block_1. Which is on black_block_2. Then, white_block_1 is no longer clear. But we need to unstack white_block_1 later to put it on the table. So this would require unstacking black_block_3 from white_block_1 again, which is possible if we have to.

So which option is best? Let's pick option 1: stack black_block_3 on black_block_1. Then, we can proceed.

So revised steps:

1. unstack black_block_4 black_block_3 → hold 4
2. putdown 4 → 4 on table
3. unstack black_block_3 white_block_1 → hold 3
4. stack black_block_3 black_block_1 → now 3 is on 1, black_block_1 is not clear
5. unstack white_block_1 black_block_2 → hold white
6. putdown white → goal achieved

But we need to check if step 4 is possible. To stack black_block_3 on black_block_1, the preconditions are: holding black_block_3 (yes) and black_block_1 is clear (yes). So step 4 is valid.

Now, after step 4, black_block_3 is on black_block_1. This satisfies constraint 6 because black_block_3 is not on the table. Also, in step 5, unstacking white_block_1 from black_block_2 is allowed because white_block_1 is clear (after step 3).

Now, let's check constraints with this revised plan.

Constraint 1: Need a state with green on white and holding black_block_1. Let's see:

In the revised plan, after step 6, white is on table. Then:

7. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1 → hold yellow
8. putdown yellow
9. pickup green_block_1 → hold green
10. stack green_block_1 white_block_1 → green on white
11. unstack black_block_3 black_block_1 → requires black_block_3 is clear (yes, since it's on black_block_1 and no one is on top)
12. putdown black_block_3 → but constraint 6 forbids this. So can't putdown. So have to stack it elsewhere. For example:

11. unstack black_block_3 black_block_1 → hold 3
12. stack black_block_3 yellow_block_1 → yellow is clear (after step 7)
13. Now, pickup black_block_1 → but black_block_1 is clear after step 11. So:

13. pickup black_block_1 → now holding black_block_1. At this point, green is on white (step 10), and robot is holding black_block_1 (step 13). So constraint 1 is satisfied.

But this adds many steps. However, the revised plan so far is:

1. unstack 4 from 3 → hold 4
2. putdown 4
3. unstack 3 from white → hold 3
4. stack 3 on 1
5. unstack white from 2 → hold white
6. putdown white → goal
7. unstack yellow from green → hold yellow
8. putdown yellow
9. pickup green → hold green
10. stack green on white → green on white
11. unstack 3 from 1 → hold 3
12. stack 3 on yellow → but yellow is on table now (step 8 putdown)
13. pickup black_block_1 → now holding 1.

But steps 7-13 are after achieving the goal. This makes the plan longer. Is there a way to integrate this into the main plan?

Alternatively, after step 4 (stack 3 on 1), we can proceed to satisfy constraint 1 by manipulating green and black_block_1.

But during the main plan, after step 4:

We have black_block_3 on black_block_1. Now, to get green on white_block_1 and hold black_block_1, perhaps:

After step 4, we can unstack black_block_3 from black_block_1 (but that would require holding it, but we need to hold green and black_block_1.

Alternatively, after step 4, we can work on moving green_block_1 onto white_block_1.

But green_block_1 has yellow on top. So steps:

5. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1 → hold yellow
6. putdown yellow
7. pickup green_block_1 → hold green
8. stack green_block_1 white_block_1 → white is on black_block_2, but after step 3, white is clear. So stacking green on white here would make white on black_block_2 with green on top. Then, to get white on table, we need to unstack green and white.

But this complicates the plan. Let's see:

Revised plan with these steps:

1. unstack 4 from 3 → hold 4
2. putdown 4
3. unstack 3 from white → hold 3
4. stack 3 on 1 → 3 on 1
5. unstack yellow from green → hold yellow
6. putdown yellow
7. pickup green → hold green
8. stack green on white → green on white (which is on black_block_2)
9. unstack white from black_block_2 → can't do, because white has green on top. So need to unstack green first.

9. unstack green from white → hold green
10. putdown green
11. unstack white from black_block_2 → hold white
12. putdown white → goal achieved.

Now, after step 8, green is on white_block_1 (which is on black_block_2). Then, steps 9-12. But this adds more steps. Also, after step 8, to satisfy constraint 1, need to hold black_block_1. So after step 8, robot is empty. Then:

9. pickup black_block_1 → but black_block_1 has black_block_3 on top. So it's not clear. Therefore, can't pickup.

Ah, right, after step 4, black_block_3 is on black_block_1. So black_block_1 is not clear. Therefore, we can't pick it up. So this approach doesn't work for constraint 1.

This is getting really complicated. Let's try to find a plan that meets all constraints without violating any, especially constraint 6.

Alternative approach:

Since we can't put black_block_3 on the table, after unstacking it from white_block_1 (step 3), we must stack it somewhere else. Let's stack it on black_block_4.

Revised steps:

1. unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3 → hold 4
2. stack black_block_4 on black_block_1 → since black_block_1 is clear. Now black_block_4 is on black_block_1.
3. unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1 → hold 3
4. stack black_block_3 on black_block_4 → which is on black_block_1. But black_block_4 is not clear (since we stacked black_block_3 on it later?), wait, no. After step 2, black_block_4 is on black_block_1. Then step 3: unstack 3 from white. Step 4: stack 3 on 4 (which is on 1). So black_block_3 is on 4, which is on 1. This is allowed, and keeps black_block_3 off the table.

Then, after step 4, white_block_1 is clear. Now:

5. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2 → hold white
6. putdown white → goal achieved.

Now, checking constraint 6: black_block_3 is never on the table. Correct.

Now, let's check other constraints.

Constraint 1: Need green on white and holding black_block_1. After step 6, white is on table. So:

7. unstack yellow from green → hold yellow
8. putdown yellow
9. pickup green → hold green
10. stack green on white → green on white (on table)
11. Now, to hold black_block_1: but black_block_1 has blocks on it (black_block_4 and black_block_3). So can't pick it up. So this approach doesn't work.

Alternative idea: After step 2, black_block_4 is on black_block_1. Then, in step 4, stack black_block_3 on black_block_4. So the stack is black_block_1 -> black_block_4 -> black_block_3. Then, later, to get black_block_1, we need to unstack black_block_3 and black_block_4. But that's not possible since the robot can only hold one block at a time.

This seems like a dead end. Another approach: find a different place to stack black_block_3. For example, stack it on yellow_block_1.

Steps:

1. unstack 4 from 3 → hold 4
2. putdown 4 → on table
3. unstack 3 from white → hold 3
4. stack 3 on yellow → yellow is clear (initially yes)
5. Now, black_block_3 is on yellow_block_1, which is on green_block_1.
6. unstack white from black_block_2 → hold white
7. putdown white → goal achieved.

Now, constraint 6 is satisfied because black_block_3 is never on table.

Now, constraint 1: green on white and holding black_block_1. After step 7:

8. unstack yellow from green → can't, because yellow has black_block_3 on top. So need to unstack black_block_3 first.

8. unstack 3 from yellow → hold 3
9. putdown 3 → violates constraint 6. Can't. So must stack 3 elsewhere.

9. stack 3 on black_block_1 → which is clear (initially yes)
10. Now, unstack yellow from green → hold yellow
11. putdown yellow
12. pickup green → hold green
13. stack green on white → green on white
14. pickup black_block_1 → but black_block_1 has 3 on top. Can't pick up.

This approach also fails.

Alternative idea: Stack black_block_3 on black_block_2. But black_block_2 has white_block_1. So after step 3, white_block_1 is clear. Then stack black_block_3 on white_block_1. But then white_block_1 has black_block_3 on top again, which would require unstacking again.

Steps:

1. unstack 4 from 3 → hold 4
2. putdown 4
3. unstack 3 from white → hold 3
4. stack 3 on white → white is clear (yes)
5. Now, white has 3 on top. So to unstack white, need to remove 3 again. But this leads to a loop.

This isn't helpful.

Another approach: Since constraint 6 requires black_block_3 never on the table, we must keep it stacked somewhere. Let's stack it on black_block_4 after step 1.

Steps:

1. unstack 4 from 3 → hold 4
2. stack 4 on black_block_1 → now 4 is on 1
3. unstack 3 from white → hold 3
4. stack 3 on 4 → now 3 is on 4, which is on 1
5. unstack white from 2 → hold white
6. putdown white → goal.

Now, after step 6, white is on table. To satisfy constraint 1:

7. unstack yellow from green → hold yellow
8. putdown yellow
9. pickup green → hold green
10. stack green on white → green on white
11. Now, to hold black_block_1: but black_block_1 has 4 and 3 on top. So need to unstack them.

11. unstack 3 from 4 → hold 3
12. unstack 4 from 1 → hold 4 (requires robot to be empty after step 11: putdown 3 first)
Wait, this is getting too complicated.

At this point, it's clear that satisfying all constraints, especially constraint 1 and 6, requires a longer plan with additional steps after achieving the goal. The optimal plan would have to include these steps, even though they increase the plan length.

But perhaps there's a way to satisfy constraint 1 during the main plan steps. For example, after unstacking white_block_1 and before putting it down, we can stack it on green_block_1. But green_block_1 has yellow on top. So we need to first move yellow.

But let's try:

Revised plan:

1. unstack 4 from 3 → hold 4
2. stack 4 on black_block_1 → 4 on 1
3. unstack 3 from white → hold 3
4. stack 3 on 4 → 3 on 4 (on 1)
5. unstack yellow from green → hold yellow
6. putdown yellow
7. pickup green → hold green
8. unstack white from 2 → hold white (constraint 2 satisfied here)
9. stack white on green → now white is on green, robot is empty
10. Now, to satisfy constraint 1: green is on white? No, white is on green. Wait, no: stack white on green. So green is under white. But constraint 1 requires green on white. So this is the opposite. So we need to stack green on white.

So steps:

8. stack green on white → requires holding green and white is clear.

Wait, after step 7, robot is holding green. white_block_1 is on black_block_2 and is clear (after step 3). So step 8: stack green on white.

But green is in hand, white is on black_block_2. So stacking green on white would make green on white, which is on black_block_2. Then, step 9: unstack white from black_block_2. But white has green on top, so can't be unstuck. So this approach doesn't work.

Alternatively, after stacking green on white (step 8), we need to unstack green again to get white clear. So:

9. unstack green from white → hold green
10. putdown green
11. unstack white from black_block_2 → hold white
12. putdown white → goal achieved.

Then, after step 12, white is on table. To satisfy constraint 1, we need to stack green on white and hold black_block_1. So:

13. stack green on white → requires holding green, which is on table after step 10.
14. pickup green → hold green
15. stack green on white → now green on white (on table)
16. pickup black_block_1 → but black_block_1 has 4 and 3 on top. Can't.

This is still not working.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I think the optimal plan must involve the following steps, ensuring all constraints are met:

- Unstack black_block_4 and black_block_3, stacking them on other blocks to avoid putting them on the table.
- Unstack white_block_1 and put it on the table.
- Manipulate green_block_1 and black_block_1 to satisfy constraint 1.

Here's a possible plan:

```
1. unstack black_block_4 black_block_3
2. stack black_block_4 black_block_1
3. unstack black_block_3 white_block_1
4. stack black_block_3 black_block_4
5. unstack white_block_1 black_block_2
6. putdown white_block_1
7. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1
8. putdown yellow_block_1
9. pickup green_block_1
10. stack green_block_1 white_block_1
11. unstack black_block_3 black_block_4
12. stack black_block_3 yellow_block_1
13. pickup black_block_1
```

Let's validate each step:

1. unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3 → hold 4. Preconditions: 4 is on 3, clear, robot empty. Yes.
2. stack 4 on black_block_1 → 4 on 1. Preconditions: holding 4, 1 is clear. Yes.
3. unstack 3 from white → hold 3. Pre: 3 on white, clear, robot empty. Yes.
4. stack 3 on 4 (which is on 1). Pre: holding 3, 4 is clear (since 4 is on 1 and no other blocks on it). Yes.
5. unstack white from 2 → hold white. Pre: white on 2, clear. Yes.
6. putdown white → white on table. Goal achieved.
7. unstack yellow from green → hold yellow. Pre: yellow on green, clear, robot empty. Yes.
8. putdown yellow → yellow on table.
9. pickup green → Pre: green on table, clear. Yes.
10. stack green on white → Pre: holding green, white clear (yes, on table). Now green on white.
11. unstack 3 from 4 → Pre: 3 on 4 (on 1), clear. Hold 3.
12. stack 3 on yellow → Pre: holding 3, yellow clear. Yes.
13. pickup black_block_1 → Pre: black_block_1 is clear (after step 11, 3 was on 4, which is on 1. After unstacking 3, 4 is on 1 and clear. So black_block_1 has 4 on it, so not clear. Can't pickup. Oh no, this is a mistake.

Wait, after step 4, black_block_3 is stacked on black_block_4, which is on black_block_1. So black_block_1 has 4 on it, which has 3 on it. After step 11, unstacking 3 from 4, robot holds 3. Then black_block_4 is on black_block_1 and is clear (since 3 was removed). So black_block_1 has 4 on it. So black_block_1 is not clear. Therefore, step 13 can't pickup black_block_1. So this plan fails.

This indicates that after step 12, when we stack 3 on yellow, robot is empty. Then, to pickup black_block_1, we need it to be clear. But it's not. So this approach doesn't work.

Alternative step 13:

13. unstack black_block_4 from black_block_1 → Pre: 4 on 1, clear (since 3 was moved to yellow). So unstack 4 from 1 → hold 4.
14. putdown 4 → but constraint 6 allows this, as it's black_block_3 that can't be on table. 4 is allowed.
15. Now, black_block_1 is clear. Pickup black_block_1.

So revised steps after step 12:

13. unstack black_block_4 black_block_1 → hold 4
14. putdown black_block_4 → on table
15. pickup black_block_1 → now holding 1.

Now, in step 15, the state has green on white and robot holding black_block_1. So constraint 1 is satisfied.

But this adds steps 13-15. So the full plan would be:

```
1. unstack black_block_4 black_block_3
2. stack black_block_4 black_block_1
3. unstack black_block_3 white_block_1
4. stack black_block_3 black_block_4
5. unstack white_block_1 black_block_2
6. putdown white_block_1
7. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1
8. putdown yellow_block_1
9. pickup green_block_1
10. stack green_block_1 white_block_1
11. unstack black_block_3 black_block_4
12. stack black_block_3 yellow_block_1
13. unstack black_block_4 black_block_1
14. putdown black_block_4
15. pickup black_block_1
```

Now, checking constraints:

- Constraint 1: State after step 10 (green on white) and step 15 (holding black_block_1). But these are separate states. Wait, no. The state after step 10 has green on white and robot empty. Then steps 11-15:

After step 10: green on white, robot empty.

Step 11: unstack 3 from 4 → hold 3.

Step 12: stack 3 on yellow → robot empty.

Step 13: unstack 4 from 1 → hold 4.

Step 14: putdown 4 → robot empty.

Step 15: pickup black_block_1 → holding 1.

At step 15, green is still on white, and robot holds black_block_1. So constraint 1 is satisfied in this state.

Other constraints:

- Constraint 2: Holding white_block_1 in step 5.

- Constraint 3: When holding white_block_1 (step 5), in later steps, either black_block_1 is not clear (after step 2, black_block_1 has 4 on it) or black_block_4 is not clear (after step 4, black_block_4 has 3 on it). So during step 5, black_block_1 is not clear (due to 4), satisfying the constraint.

- Constraint 4: black_block_3 not on yellow in some state. Initially, black_block_3 is on white. After step 12, it's on yellow. So before step 12, it's not on yellow. So the initial state satisfies this.

- Constraint 5: Whenever black_block_3 not on yellow (which is always true except after step 12), ensure either black_block_2 not on table or holding green. In steps before 12, black_block_3 is not on yellow. For example, in step 5, when unstacking white, black_block_2 is on table. But in step 9, the robot is holding green, which satisfies the condition.

- Constraint 6: black_block_3 never on table. Correct.

- Constraint 7: At least one state where black_block_4 not on yellow. Initially, black_block_4 is on 3. After step 2, on 1. After step 12, on table (step 14). So this is satisfied.

- Constraint 8: If black_block_4 not on yellow (which is always true except never), then there's a block on black_block_2. After step 5, black_block_2 is clear. But after step 5, white is put down, so black_block_2 is clear. However, the constraint requires that if black_block_4 is not on yellow, then black_block_2 is not clear. But this constraint's antecedent is only true when black_block_4 is not on yellow, which is always true. So the consequent must hold: black_block_2 is not clear. However, after step 5, black_block_2 is clear. This violates the constraint. So this plan is invalid.

Ah, this is a problem. Constraint 8 says: If "black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1" holds in some state s, then "there is a block on top of black_block_2" must hold in s or later.

Since black_block_4 is never on yellow_block_1 (except perhaps never), the antecedent is always true. Therefore, the consequent must always hold: in every state, if the antecedent is true (which it is), then there must be a block on top of black_block_2 in that state or later. But after step 5, black_block_2 is clear (white is removed). So this violates the constraint.

So this plan is invalid.

To satisfy constraint 8, we need to ensure that whenever black_block_4 is not on yellow (which is always), then at some point after, black_block_2 has a block on top. But after the goal is achieved, white_block_1 is on the table, so black_block_2 is clear. So unless we stack something on black_block_2 after moving white, this constraint is violated.

So we need to ensure that after moving white, we stack something on black_block_2. For example, after step 6 (putdown white), stack something on black_block_2. Let's use black_block_3.

But black_block_3 is stacked on yellow_block_1 in step 12. So maybe after step 6, stack another block on black_block_2.

Let's adjust the plan:

After step 6:

7. unstack yellow from green → hold yellow
8. stack yellow on black_block_2 → black_block_2 has yellow on top
9. Now, pickup green.

This would satisfy constraint 8, because after step 8, black_block_2 has yellow on top. Then, in later steps, even if yellow is moved, the constraint is satisfied because at some state after black_block_4 is not on yellow, black_block_2 has a block.

But let's revise the plan accordingly:

```
1. unstack black_block_4 black_block_3
2. stack black_block_4 black_block_1
3. unstack black_block_3 white_block_1
4. stack black_block_3 black_block_4
5. unstack white_block_1 black_block_2
6. putdown white_block_1
7. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1
8. stack yellow_block_1 black_block_2
9. pickup green_block_1
10. stack green_block_1 white_block_1
11. unstack black_block_3 black_block_4
12. stack black_block_3 yellow_block_1
13. unstack black_block_4 black_block_1
14. putdown black_block_4
15. pickup black_block_1
```

Now, after step 8, yellow is on black_block_2, so black_block_2 is not clear. This satisfies constraint 8: whenever black_block_4 is not on yellow (which is always), there exists a state (step 8 onwards) where black_block_2 has a block.

Now, checking constraint 8:

- The antecedent (black_block_4 not on yellow) is true in all states. The consequent requires that in each state s where the antecedent is true, there exists a state after or including s where black_block_2 is not clear. Since after step 8, black_block_2 has yellow on it, this holds.

Other constraints:

- Constraint 1: After step 10, green is on white. After step 15, robot holds black_block_1. So in step 15, both conditions are true.

- Constraint 2: Holding white in step 5.

- Constraint 3: When holding white in step 5, in later steps, black_block_1 is not clear (due to step 2: black_block_4 on it), so constraint satisfied.

- Constraint 4: black_block_3 not on yellow in some state. Initially, yes. After step 12, it is on yellow. So the initial state satisfies this.

- Constraint 5: Whenever black_block_3 not on yellow (before step 12), either black_block_2 not on table (step 8: yellow on black_block_2, which is on table, so black_block_2 is still on table, but has something on top. Wait, no. black_block_2 is on the table, and has yellow on top. So black_block_2 is on the table. So the condition is "black_block_2 is not on the table" or "robot holds green". In step 9, the robot picks up green, which satisfies the condition.

- Constraint 6: black_block_3 never on table.

- Constraint 7: At least one state where black_block_4 not on yellow. This is always true, so satisfied.

- Constraint 9: Holding green in step 9.

- Constraint 10: White on black_block_1. Wait, no. The final constraint is that white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1. But in this plan, white is on the table. So this constraint isn't met.

Wait, the constraints include: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1'". Oh right! I missed this constraint.

So we need to have white_block_1 on top of black_block_1 in some state.

In the current plan, white_block_1 is moved to the table in step 6. So we need to stack it on black_block_1 at some point and then move it back. This complicates things further.

To satisfy this new constraint (white on black_block_1 in some state), we need to stack white on black_block_1 and then unstack it to put it on the table.

For example, after step 5 (holding white), instead of putting it down immediately:

6. stack white_block_1 black_block_1 → white on black_block_1
7. unstack white_block_1 black_block_1 → hold white
8. putdown white_block_1 → goal.

This adds two steps. Also, during step 6, white is on black_block_1, satisfying the last constraint.

But then we need to check other constraints.

Let's integrate this:

Revised plan:

```
1. unstack black_block_4 black_block_3
2. stack black_block_4 black_block_1
3. unstack black_block_3 white_block_1
4. stack black_block_3 black_block_4
5. unstack white_block_1 black_block_2
6. stack white_block_1 black_block_1
7. unstack white_block_1 black_block_1
8. putdown white_block_1
9. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1
10. stack yellow_block_1 black_block_2
11. pickup green_block_1
12. stack green_block_1 white_block_1
13. unstack black_block_3 black_block_4
14. stack black_block_3 yellow_block_1
15. unstack black_block_4 black_block_1
16. putdown black_block_4
17. pickup black_block_1
```

Now, check constraints:

- Constraint 10: White on black_block_1 in step 6.

- Constraint 8: After step 10, black_block_2 has yellow.

- Constraint 3: When holding white in steps 5 and 7, after step 6, black_block_1 has white on top, so it's not clear, satisfying the constraint.

But this makes the plan longer. The optimal plan must be the shortest possible. But given the complexity, it's likely that the optimal plan requires these additional steps.

After considering all constraints and ensuring each is met, the final plan would involve the necessary steps to:

- Move black_block_4 and black_block_3 off white_block_1 without putting them on the table.
- Temporarily stack white_block_1 on black_block_1 to meet the last constraint.
- Move white_block_1 to the table.
- Manipulate green_block_1 and black_block_1 to meet the first constraint.

The final plan would look something like the above, but ensuring all constraints are met with the minimal steps. After multiple iterations, the optimal plan is likely:

```
unstack black_block_4 black_block_3
stack black_block_4 black_block_1
unstack black_block_3 white_block_1
stack black_block_3 black_block_4
unstack white_block_1 black_block_2
stack white_block_1 black_block_1
unstack white_block_1 black_block_1
putdown white_block_1
unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1
putdown yellow_block_1
pickup green_block_1
stack green_block_1 white_block_1
unstack black_block_3 black_block_4
stack black_block_3 yellow_block_1
unstack black_block_4 black_block_1
putdown black_block_4
pickup black_block_1
```

Each step is necessary to satisfy the constraints and achieve the goal. This plan has 15 steps, but perhaps there's a shorter version. However, given the constraints, this is likely the optimal solution.
