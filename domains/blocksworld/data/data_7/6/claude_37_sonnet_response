Let's break down this problem step by step. First, I'll analyze the initial state and the goal, then I'll consider the constraints and see how they affect the planning.

Initial state:
1. "green_block_1 is on the table"
2. "black_block_1 is on the table"
3. "black_block_2 is on the table"
4. "yellow_block_1 is on top of green_block_1"
5. "white_block_1 is on top of black_block_2"
6. "black_block_3 is on top of white_block_1"
7. "black_block_4 is on top of black_block_3"
8. "there is no block on top of black_block_1, i.e., black_block_1 is clear"
9. "there is no block on top of yellow_block_1, i.e., yellow_block_1 is clear"
10. "there is no block on top of black_block_4, i.e., black_block_4 is clear"
11. "you are not holding any block"

The current towers are:
- black_block_1 (clear)
- green_block_1 - yellow_block_1 (clear)
- black_block_2 - white_block_1 - black_block_3 - black_block_4 (clear)

Goal state:
"white_block_1 is on the table"

Constraints:
1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "The following conditions are all true: "green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1", "you are holding black_block_1"""
2. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "you are holding white_block_1""
3. "If expression "you are holding white_block_1" holds in some state s, then expression "At least one of the following conditions is true: "there is a block on top of black_block_1, i.e., black_block_1 is not clear", "there is a block on top of black_block_4, i.e., black_block_4 is not clear"" must hold at s or at some state after s"
4. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1""
5. "If expression "black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1" holds in some state s, then expression "At least one of the following conditions is true: "black_block_2 is not on the table", "you are holding green_block_1"" must hold at s or at some state after s"
6. "The following expression must hold in every state: "black_block_3 is not on the table""
7. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1""
8. "If expression "black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1" holds in some state s, then expression "there is a block on top of black_block_2, i.e., black_block_2 is not clear" must hold at s or at some state after s"
9. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "you are holding green_block_1""
10. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1""

Now, let's think about how to satisfy both the goal and the constraints:

The goal is to have white_block_1 on the table.

Constraint 1 requires us to have a state where green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and we are holding black_block_1. 
This means we need to first rearrange the blocks to have green_block_1 on top of white_block_1, and then pick up black_block_1. 

Constraint 2 requires us to hold white_block_1 at some point.

Constraint 3 says that after holding white_block_1, either black_block_1 or black_block_4 should have a block on top of it.

Constraint 4 requires that black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1 at some point. Given the initial state, black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1 anyway, so this is already satisfied.

Constraint 5 says that after black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1, either black_block_2 is not on the table or we are holding green_block_1. Given that black_block_3 is not on yellow_block_1 in the initial state, this constraint is immediately activated. We need to ensure either black_block_2 is not on the table or we are holding green_block_1 at some point.

Constraint 6 requires that black_block_3 is never on the table throughout our plan.

Constraint 7 requires that black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1 at some point. Given the initial state, black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1 anyway, so this is already satisfied.

Constraint 8 says that after black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1, black_block_2 should have a block on top of it. Given that black_block_4 is not on yellow_block_1 in the initial state, this constraint is immediately activated. We need to ensure black_block_2 has a block on top of it, which is already satisfied in the initial state (white_block_1 is on top of black_block_2).

Constraint 9 requires us to hold green_block_1 at some point.

Constraint 10 requires that white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1 at some point.

Given these constraints and the goal, let's craft a plan:

Initial state:
- black_block_1 (clear)
- green_block_1 - yellow_block_1 (clear)
- black_block_2 - white_block_1 - black_block_3 - black_block_4 (clear)

Step 1: Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3.
After step 1: 
- black_block_1 (clear)
- green_block_1 - yellow_block_1 (clear)
- black_block_2 - white_block_1 - black_block_3 (clear)
- You're holding black_block_4.

Step 2: Stack black_block_4 on black_block_1.
After step 2: 
- black_block_1 - black_block_4 (clear)
- green_block_1 - yellow_block_1 (clear)
- black_block_2 - white_block_1 - black_block_3 (clear)
- You're not holding anything.

Now, I notice that after step 2, constraint 3 becomes relevant because once we hold white_block_1 later, we need to ensure either black_block_1 or black_block_4 has a block on top of it. Since we've just put black_block_4 on top of black_block_1, black_block_1 is not clear, so constraint 3 will be satisfied.

Step 3: Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1.
After step 3:
- black_block_1 - black_block_4 (clear)
- green_block_1 - yellow_block_1 (clear)
- black_block_2 - white_block_1 (clear)
- You're holding black_block_3.

Step 4: Stack black_block_3 on black_block_4.
After step 4:
- black_block_1 - black_block_4 - black_block_3 (clear)
- green_block_1 - yellow_block_1 (clear)
- black_block_2 - white_block_1 (clear)
- You're not holding anything.

Step 5: Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2.
After step 5:
- black_block_1 - black_block_4 - black_block_3 (clear)
- green_block_1 - yellow_block_1 (clear)
- black_block_2 (clear)
- You're holding white_block_1.

This satisfies constraint 2: we're holding white_block_1.
Also, constraint 3 is satisfied because black_block_1 has blocks on top of it.

Now, because black_block_2 is clear after removing white_block_1, we need to ensure constraint 8 is satisfied. We need to put a block on top of black_block_2 after black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1 (which is the case in the initial state).

Step 6: Stack white_block_1 on black_block_1.
After step 6:
- black_block_1 - black_block_4 - black_block_3 (clear)
- green_block_1 - yellow_block_1 (clear)
- black_block_2 (clear)
- You're not holding anything.

This satisfies constraint 10: white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1.

Hmm, I think I've made a mistake. Let's rethink this plan because the constraint logic is a bit complex. 

Looking at the constraints, I notice that constraint 1 requires a state where green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and we are holding black_block_1. Let's try to achieve this first.

Given the initial state:
- black_block_1 (clear)
- green_block_1 - yellow_block_1 (clear)
- black_block_2 - white_block_1 - black_block_3 - black_block_4 (clear)

I need to rearrange the blocks to have green_block_1 on top of white_block_1 and then pick up black_block_1.

Step 1: Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3.
After step 1: 
- black_block_1 (clear)
- green_block_1 - yellow_block_1 (clear)
- black_block_2 - white_block_1 - black_block_3 (clear)
- You're holding black_block_4.

Step 2: Stack black_block_4 on black_block_1.
After step 2: 
- black_block_1 - black_block_4 (clear)
- green_block_1 - yellow_block_1 (clear)
- black_block_2 - white_block_1 - black_block_3 (clear)
- You're not holding anything.

Step 3: Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1.
After step 3:
- black_block_1 - black_block_4 (clear)
- green_block_1 - yellow_block_1 (clear)
- black_block_2 - white_block_1 (clear)
- You're holding black_block_3.

Step 4: Stack black_block_3 on black_block_4.
After step 4:
- black_block_1 - black_block_4 - black_block_3 (clear)
- green_block_1 - yellow_block_1 (clear)
- black_block_2 - white_block_1 (clear)
- You're not holding anything.

Step 5: Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2.
After step 5:
- black_block_1 - black_block_4 - black_block_3 (clear)
- green_block_1 - yellow_block_1 (clear)
- black_block_2 (clear)
- You're holding white_block_1.

This satisfies constraint 2: we're holding white_block_1.
And since black_block_1 has blocks on top of it, constraint 3 is also satisfied.

Step 6: Putdown white_block_1.
After step 6:
- black_block_1 - black_block_4 - black_block_3 (clear)
- green_block_1 - yellow_block_1 (clear)
- black_block_2 (clear)
- white_block_1 (clear)
- You're not holding anything.

This achieves the goal: white_block_1 is on the table.

However, I haven't addressed all the constraints yet. Let's continue:

Step 7: Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.
After step 7:
- black_block_1 - black_block_4 - black_block_3 (clear)
- green_block_1 (clear)
- black_block_2 (clear)
- white_block_1 (clear)
- You're holding yellow_block_1.

Step 8: Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_2.
After step 8:
- black_block_1 - black_block_4 - black_block_3 (clear)
- green_block_1 (clear)
- black_block_2 - yellow_block_1 (clear)
- white_block_1 (clear)
- You're not holding anything.

This satisfies constraint 8: black_block_2 has a block on top of it after black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1.

Step 9: Pickup green_block_1.
After step 9:
- black_block_1 - black_block_4 - black_block_3 (clear)
- black_block_2 - yellow_block_1 (clear)
- white_block_1 (clear)
- You're holding green_block_1.

This satisfies constraint 9: I'm holding green_block_1.
And given that black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1 (from the initial state), constraint 5 is satisfied by me holding green_block_1.

Step 10: Stack green_block_1 on white_block_1.
After step 10:
- black_block_1 - black_block_4 - black_block_3 (clear)
- black_block_2 - yellow_block_1 (clear)
- white_block_1 - green_block_1 (clear)
- You're not holding anything.

Step 11: Pickup black_block_1.
But wait, this is not possible because black_block_1 has other blocks on top of it. I need to adjust my plan.

I think I'll need to rearrange some blocks to ensure all constraints are satisfied. Let's try a different approach.

Given the initial state:
- black_block_1 (clear)
- green_block_1 - yellow_block_1 (clear)
- black_block_2 - white_block_1 - black_block_3 - black_block_4 (clear)

First, I need to get white_block_1 to the table (the goal), but I also need to make sure all constraints are satisfied.

Constraint 1 is particularly challenging: I need to have green_block_1 on top of white_block_1 and I need to be holding black_block_1. Let's restructure the plan with this as a central goal:

Step 1: Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3.
Step 2: Putdown black_block_4.
Step 3: Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1.
Step 4: Stack black_block_3 on black_block_4.
Step 5: Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2.

Now I'm holding white_block_1, satisfying constraint 2. Constraint 3 says I need to have a block on top of black_block_1 or black_block_4 after this. black_block_4 already has black_block_3 on top of it, so constraint 3 is satisfied.

Step 6: Putdown white_block_1.

White_block_1 is now on the table, satisfying the goal. However, I still need to satisfy the other constraints.

Step 7: Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.
Step 8: Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_2.

Now black_block_2 has a block on top of it after black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1, satisfying constraint 8.

Step 9: Pickup green_block_1.

Now I'm holding green_block_1, which satisfies constraint 9 and, given that black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1 (from the initial state), it also satisfies constraint 5.

Step 10: Stack green_block_1 on white_block_1.
Step 11: Pickup black_block_1.

Now I have green_block_1 on top of white_block_1 and I'm holding black_block_1, satisfying constraint 1.

Step 12: Putdown black_block_1.
Step 13: Unstack green_block_1 from white_block_1.
Step 14: Stack green_block_1 on black_block_1.

Now green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1.

Step 15: Unstack black_block_3 from black_block_4.
Step 16: Stack black_block_3 on green_block_1.
Step 17: Unstack white_block_1 from the table.

Now I'm holding white_block_1 again (satisfying constraint 2 again). Since black_block_1 has blocks on top of it (green_block_1 and black_block_3), constraint 3 is satisfied.

Step 18: Stack white_block_1 on black_block_1.

Now white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, satisfying constraint 10.

Step 19: Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_1.
Step 20: Putdown white_block_1.

Now white_block_1 is back on the table, achieving the goal.

But wait, I think I've made a logical error. If white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, green_block_1 cannot also be on top of black_block_1. Let me reconsider the plan.

Actually, I think I've been overcomplicated things. Let's revise the plan based on the constraints:

Given the initial state:
- black_block_1 (clear)
- green_block_1 - yellow_block_1 (clear)
- black_block_2 - white_block_1 - black_block_3 - black_block_4 (clear)

Step 1: Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3.
Step 2: Putdown black_block_4.
Step 3: Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1.
Step 4: Putdown black_block_3.

Oops, this violates constraint 6, which says black_block_3 should never be on the table. Let's try again.

Step 1: Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3.
Step 2: Stack black_block_4 on black_block_1.
Step 3: Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1.
Step 4: Stack black_block_3 on black_block_4.
Step 5: Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2.

Now I'm holding white_block_1, which satisfies constraint 2. Since black_block_1 has blocks on top of it (black_block_4 and black_block_3), constraint 3 is also satisfied.

Step 6: Putdown white_block_1.

White_block_1 is now on the table, satisfying the goal. However, I need to continue to address the other constraints.

Step 7: Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.
Step 8: Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_2.

Now black_block_2 has a block on top of it after black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1, which satisfies constraint 8.

Step 9: Pickup green_block_1.

I'm now holding green_block_1, which satisfies constraint 9 and, since black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1 (from the initial state), it also satisfies constraint 5.

Step 10: Stack green_block_1 on white_block_1.
Step 11: Unstack black_block_3 from black_block_4.
Step 12: Putdown black_block_3.

Oops, this again violates constraint 6.

Step 11: Unstack black_block_3 from black_block_4.
Step 12: Stack black_block_3 on green_block_1.
Step 13: Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_1.
Step 14: Stack black_block_4 on black_block_3.
Step 15: Pickup black_block_1.

Now I have green_block_1 on top of white_block_1 and I'm holding black_block_1, which satisfies constraint 1.

Step 16: Putdown black_block_1.
Step 17: Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3.
Step 18: Stack black_block_4 on black_block_1.
Step 19: Unstack black_block_3 from green_block_1.
Step 20: Stack black_block_3 on black_block_4.
Step 21: Unstack green_block_1 from white_block_1.
Step 22: Stack green_block_1 on black_block_3.

Now white_block_1 is on the table, which is the goal. Let's see if we missed any constraints:

Constraint 10 requires white_block_1 to be on top of black_block_1 at some point. We haven't satisfied this yet.

Step 23: Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_3.
Step 24: Stack green_block_1 on yellow_block_1.
Step 25: Unstack black_block_3 from black_block_4.
Step 26: Stack black_block_3 on green_block_1.
Step 27: Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_1.
Step 28: Putdown black_block_4.
Step 29: Pickup white_block_1.

Now I'm holding white_block_1 (satisfying constraint 2 again). Since black_block_1 is now clear, we need to satisfy constraint 3, which requires either black_block_1 or black_block_4 to have a block on top of it. We'll address this in the next step.

Step 30: Stack white_block_1 on black_block_1.

Now white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, which satisfies constraint 10. Also, black_block_1 has a block on top of it, which satisfies constraint 3.

Step 31: Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_1.
Step 32: Putdown white_block_1.

White_block_1 is now back on the table, which is the goal.

Now, let's check all the constraints to ensure they're all satisfied:

1. "green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" and "you are holding black_block_1" -> Satisfied in steps 10-15.
2. "you are holding white_block_1" -> Satisfied in steps 5 and 29.
3. After holding white_block_1, either black_block_1 or black_block_4 should have a block on top of it -> Satisfied in steps 5-6 and 30-32.
4. "black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1" -> Satisfied throughout, as black_block_3 is never on top of yellow_block_1.
5. After black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1, either black_block_2 is not on the table or we are holding green_block_1 -> Satisfied in step 9.
6. "black_block_3 is not on the table" -> Satisfied throughout, as we never put black_block_3 on the table.
7. "black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1" -> Satisfied throughout, as black_block_4 is never on top of yellow_block_1.
8. After black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1, black_block_2 should have a block on top of it -> Satisfied in steps 7-8.
9. "you are holding green_block_1" -> Satisfied in step 9.
10. "white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" -> Satisfied in step 30.

All constraints are satisfied! 

Wait, I just realized I haven't verified if constraint 6 (black_block_3 should never be on the table) is maintained throughout the plan. Let me double-check:

- In the initial state, black_block_3 is on top of white_block_1, not on the table.
- In step 3, we unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1, but in step 4, we stack it on black_block_4, not putting it on the table.
- In steps 11-12, we unstack black_block_3 from black_block_4 and stack it on green_block_1, not putting it on the table.
- In steps 25-26, we unstack black_block_3 from black_block_4 and stack it on green_block_1, not putting it on the table.

So, black_block_3 is never placed on the table, which satisfies constraint 6.

I think our plan is correct. However, the plan is quite long. Let's see if we can optimize it:

We moved blocks multiple times, sometimes unnecessarily. Let's try to craft a more streamlined plan that still meets all constraints.

Simplified plan:

Step 1: Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3.
Step 2: Stack black_block_4 on black_block_1.
Step 3: Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1.
Step 4: Stack black_block_3 on black_block_4.
Step 5: Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2.

At this point, white_block_1 is in our hand (satisfying constraint 2), and both constraints 3, 4, and 7 are satisfied.

Step 6: Stack white_block_1 on black_block_1.

This satisfies constraint 10, and we already had blocks on top of black_block_1 (black_block_4 and black_block_3), so constraint 3 remains satisfied.

Step 7: Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.
Step 8: Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_2.

Now black_block_2 has a block on top of it, which satisfies constraint 8.

Step 9: Pickup green_block_1.

Holding green_block_1 satisfies constraint 9 and, with black_block_3 not on yellow_block_1, it also satisfies constraint 5.

Step 10: Stack green_block_1 on white_block_1.
Step 11: Pickup black_block_1.

Now we have green_block_1 on top of white_block_1 and we're holding black_block_1, which satisfies constraint 1. But this is an issue: if we pick up black_block_1, everything else (white_block_1, green_block_1) would topple because they're on top of it. This doesn't follow the rules of the domain. I need to revise this part of the plan.

Actually I think I'm confused about the constraints, so let me clarify: if green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, and white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, then we can't be holding black_block_1 at the same time.

Maybe what constraint 1 means is to have green_block_1 on top of white_block_1 in one state, and to be holding black_block_1 in that same state, but not necessarily having white_block_1 on top of black_block_1.

Let's revise the plan:

Step 1: Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3.
Step 2: Stack black_block_4 on black_block_1.
Step 3: Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1.
Step 4: Stack black_block_3 on black_block_4.
Step 5: Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2.

At this point, white_block_1 is in our hand (satisfying constraint 2), and both constraints 3, 4, and 7 are satisfied.

Step 6: Putdown white_block_1.

This achieves our goal of having white_block_1 on the table, but we still have other constraints to satisfy.

Step 7: Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.
Step 8: Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_2.

Now black_block_2 has a block on top of it, which satisfies constraint 8.

Step 9: Pickup green_block_1.

Holding green_block_1 satisfies constraint 9 and, with black_block_3 not on yellow_block_1, it also satisfies constraint 5.

Step 10: Stack green_block_1 on white_block_1.
Step 11: Unstack black_block_3 from black_block_4.
Step 12: Stack black_block_3 on green_block_1.
Step 13: Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_1.
Step 14: Stack black_block_4 on black_block_3.
Step 15: Pickup black_block_1.

Now, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and I'm holding black_block_1, which satisfies constraint 1.

Step 16: Stack black_block_1 on black_block_4.
Step 17: Unstack black_block_1 from black_block_4.
Step 18: Putdown black_block_1.
Step 19: Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3.
Step 20: Stack black_block_4 on black_block_1.
Step 21: Unstack black_block_3 from green_block_1.
Step 22: Stack black_block_3 on black_block_4.
Step 23: Unstack green_block_1 from white_block_1.
Step 24: Stack green_block_1 on black_block_3.
Step 25: Pickup white_block_1.

Now I'm holding white_block_1 again (satisfying constraint 2 again), and since black_block_1 has blocks on top of it (black_block_4, black_block_3, green_block_1), constraint 3 is satisfied.

Step 26: Stack white_block_1 on black_block_1.

This satisfies constraint 10. But wait, this doesn't make sense. If black_block_1 has other blocks on top of it, I can't stack white_block_1 on top of it. I need to revise this part.

I think I've been trying to satisfy constraint 10 in a way that's not physically possible in this domain. Let me re-read the constraint: "white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" must hold in at least one state.

To satisfy this, I need to have white_block_1 directly on top of black_block_1 at some point. This means I need to ensure black_block_1 is clear before I try to stack white_block_1 on it.

Given this, let's revise the plan:

Step 1: Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3.
Step 2: Stack black_block_4 on black_block_1.
Step 3: Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1.
Step 4: Stack black_block_3 on black_block_4.
Step 5: Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2.

At this point, white_block_1 is in our hand (satisfying constraint 2). Since black_block_1 now has blocks on top of it (black_block_4 and black_block_3), constraint 3 is also satisfied. Constraints 4 and 7 are also satisfied because black_block_3 and black_block_4 are not on top of yellow_block_1.

Step 6: Putdown white_block_1.

White_block_1 is now on the table, satisfying the goal. But we still have other constraints to address.

Step 7: Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.
Step 8: Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_2.

Now black_block_2 has a block on top of it, which satisfies constraint 8.

Step 9: Pickup green_block_1.

Holding green_block_1 satisfies constraint 9 and, with black_block_3 not on yellow_block_1, it also satisfies constraint 5.

Step 10: Stack green_block_1 on white_block_1.
Step 11: Unstack black_block_3 from black_block_4.
Step 12: Stack black_block_3 on green_block_1.
Step 13: Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_1.
Step 14: Stack black_block_4 on black_block_3.
Step 15: Pickup black_block_1.

Now, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and I'm holding black_block_1, which satisfies constraint 1.

So far, we've satisfied constraints 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The only one left is constraint 10, which requires white_block_1 to be on top of black_block_1 at some point.

Step 16: Putdown black_block_1.
Step 17: Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3.
Step 18: Stack black_block_4 on black_block_1.
Step 19: Unstack black_block_3 from green_block_1.
Step 20: Stack black_block_3 on black_block_4.
Step 21: Unstack green_block_1 from white_block_1.
Step 22: Stack green_block_1 on black_block_3.
Step 23: Pickup white_block_1.

Now I'm holding white_block_1. I need to satisfy constraint 3 again, which says after holding white_block_1, either black_block_1 or black_block_4 should have a block on top of it. black_block_1 already has black_block_4 on top of it, and black_block_4 has black_block_3 on top of it, so constraint 3 is satisfied.

Now, to satisfy constraint 10:

Step 24: Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_3.
Step 25: Stack green_block_1 on yellow_block_1.
Step 26: Unstack black_block_3 from black_block_4.
Step 27: Stack black_block_3 on green_block_1.
Step 28: Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_1.
Step 29: Putdown black_block_4.
Step 30: Stack white_block_1 on black_block_1.

Now white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, which satisfies constraint 10.

Step 31: Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_1.
Step 32: Putdown white_block_1.

Now white_block_1 is back on the table, which is the goal. And we've satisfied all 10 constraints.

Let me verify that all constraints have been met:

1. "green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" and "you are holding black_block_1" -> Satisfied in steps 10-15.
2. "you are holding white_block_1" -> Satisfied in steps 5 and 23-30.
3. After holding white_block_1, either black_block_1 or black_block_4 should have a block on top of it -> Satisfied in steps 5-6 and 23-30.
4. "black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1" -> Satisfied throughout, as black_block_3 is never on top of yellow_block_1.
5. After black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1, either black_block_2 is not on the table or we are holding green_block_1 -> Satisfied in step 9.
6. "black_block_3 is not on the table" -> Satisfied throughout, as we never put black_block_3 on the table.
7. "black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1" -> Satisfied throughout, as black_block_4 is never on top of yellow_block_1.
8. After black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1, black_block_2 should have a block on top of it -> Satisfied in steps 7-8.
9. "you are holding green_block_1" -> Satisfied in step 9.
10. "white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" -> Satisfied in step 30.

Ok, now let me try once more to streamline this plan since I've been making a lot of unnecessary back-and-forth:

Step 1: Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3.
Step 2: Stack black_block_4 on black_block_1.
Step 3: Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1.
Step 4: Stack black_block_3 on black_block_4.
Step 5: Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2.

At this point, white_block_1 is in our hand (satisfying constraint 2), and since black_block_1 has blocks on top of it (black_block_4 and black_block_3), constraint 3 is also satisfied. Constraints 4 and 7 are also satisfied because black_block_3 and black_block_4 are not on top of yellow_block_1.

Step 6: Putdown white_block_1.

This achieves our goal of having white_block_1 on the table. But I need to satisfy more constraints.

Step 7: Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.
Step 8: Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_2.

Now black_block_2 has a block on top of it, which satisfies constraint 8.

Step 9: Pickup green_block_1.

Holding green_block_1 satisfies constraint 9 and, with black_block_3 not on yellow_block_1, it also satisfies constraint 5.

Step 10: Stack green_block_1 on white_block_1.
Step 11: Unstack black_block_3 from black_block_4.
Step 12: Stack black_block_3 on green_block_1.
Step 13: Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_1.
Step 14: Stack black_block_4 on black_block_3.
Step 15: Pickup black_block_1.

Now, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and I'm holding black_block_1, which satisfies constraint 1.

To satisfy constraint 10, I need white_block_1 to be on top of black_block_1 at some point.

Ok I think I need to put white_block_1 on top of black_block_1 earlier.

Let me restart:

Step 1: Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3.
Step 2: Putdown black_block_4.
Step 3: Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1.
Step 4: Stack black_block_3 on black_block_4.
Step 5: Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2.

At this point, white_block_1 is in our hand (satisfying constraint 2). But I need to satisfy constraint 3, which says after holding white_block_1, either black_block_1 or black_block_4 should have a block on top of it. black_block_4 already has black_block_3 on top of it, so constraint 3 is satisfied.

Step 6: Stack white_block_1 on black_block_1.

Now white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, which satisfies constraint 10.

Step 7: Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_1.

Step 8: Putdown white_block_1.

White_block_1 is now on the table, which is the goal.

Step 9: Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.
Step 10: Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_2.

Now black_block_2 has a block on top of it, which satisfies constraint 8.

Step 11: Pickup green_block_1.

Holding green_block_1 satisfies constraint 9 and, with black_block_3 not on yellow_block_1, it also satisfies constraint 5.

Step 12: Stack green_block_1 on white_block_1.
Step 13: Pickup black_block_1.

Now, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and I'm holding black_block_1, which satisfies constraint 1.

So far, we've satisfied constraints 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, and 10. Let's check the remaining constraints:

Constraint 4: "black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1". This is satisfied throughout the plan, as black_block_3 is never on top of yellow_block_1.

Constraint 6: "black_block_3 is not on the table". We've maintained this throughout, as black_block_3 is either on white_block_1 (initially), or on black_block_4 (after step 4).

Constraint 7: "black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1". This is satisfied throughout the plan, as black_block_4 is never on top of yellow_block_1.

All constraints are satisfied, and our goal is achieved! 

Here's the final plan:

Step 1: Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3.
Step 2: Putdown black_block_4.
Step 3: Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1.
Step 4: Stack black_block_3 on black_block_4.
Step 5: Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2.
Step 6: Stack white_block_1 on black_block_1.
Step 7: Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_1.
Step 8: Putdown white_block_1.
Step 9: Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.
Step 10: Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_2.
Step 11: Pickup green_block_1.
Step 12: Stack green_block_1 on white_block_1.
Step 13: Pickup black_block_1.

Wait, I need to ensure my plan is physically consistent, so let me check this carefully. After step 13, I'm holding black_block_1, but I've stacked green_block_1 on white_block_1. This seems consistent.

But I need to also ensure I don't leave black_block_1 in my hand at the end, since the goal state doesn't mention anything about holding a block. So I need one more step:

Step 14: Putdown black_block_1.

Now, let's double check all constraints again:

1. "green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" and "you are holding black_block_1" -> Satisfied in steps 12-13.
2. "you are holding white_block_1" -> Satisfied in steps 5-6.
3. After holding white_block_1, either black_block_1 or black_block_4 should have a block on top of it -> Satisfied in step 6.
4. "black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1" -> Satisfied throughout.
5. After black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1, either black_block_2 is not on the table or we are holding green_block_1 -> Satisfied in step 11.
6. "black_block_3 is not on the table" -> Satisfied throughout.
7. "black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1" -> Satisfied throughout.
8. After black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1, black_block_2 should have a block on top of it -> Satisfied in steps 9-10.
9. "you are holding green_block_1" -> Satisfied in step 11.
10. "white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" -> Satisfied in step 6.

All constraints are satisfied, and our goal is achieved!

Here's the final plan:

```
unstack black_block_4 black_block_3
putdown black_block_4
unstack black_block_3 white_block_1
stack black_block_3 black_block_4
unstack white_block_1 black_block_2
stack white_block_1 black_block_1
unstack white_block_1 black_block_1
putdown white_block_1
unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1
stack yellow_block_1 black_block_2
pickup green_block_1
stack green_block_1 white_block_1
pickup black_block_1
putdown black_block_1
```

This gives us 14 steps, and I believe it's an optimal plan because I don't see any way to satisfy all the constraints in fewer steps.

In summary, this plan:
1. Reorganizes the blocks to have white_block_1 on the table, which is the goal.
2. Satisfies all 10 constraints by:
   - Holding white_block_1 and ensuring black_block_1 or black_block_4 has a block on top of it in the next state.
   - Having white_block_1 on top of black_block_1 at one point.
   - Ensuring black_block_2 has a block on top of it after black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1.
   - Holding green_block_1 at one point.
   - Having green_block_1 on top of white_block_1 while holding black_block_1.
   - Ensuring black_block_3 is never on the table.
   - Making sure black_block_3 and black_block_4 are never on top of yellow_block_1.
   - Ensuring either black_block_2 is not on the table or we are holding green_block_1 after black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1.

I think this plan is correct and optimal!

Actually, let me double check constraint 5 again: If "black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1" in state s, then "black_block_2 is not on the table" or "you are holding green_block_1" in state s or a later state.

Since black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1 in every state (including the initial state), this constraint activates immediately. Hence, at some point, we need to either move black_block_2 off the table or hold green_block_1. In step 11, we pick up green_block_1, which satisfies this constraint.

But wait I think this constraint needs to be satisfied for all states where the if condition is met. Yes, black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1 in all states so we need "black_block_2 is not on the table" or "you are holding green_block_1" to be true in every state. But we're not holding green_block_1 in most states and black_block_2 remains on the table thrughout. Let me reconsider...

Actually, I don't think the constraint should be interpreted this way. If it was meant to be interpreted as "in all states where black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1, either black_block_2 is not on the table or you are holding green_block_1", then it would have been worded differently. The phrase "in some state s" suggests that we're referring to a specific state where the condition is true, not all states. Then, the phrase "at s or at some state after s" suggests that the consequent (black_block_2 not on the table or holding green_block_1) only needs to be true at that specific state s or a later state, not in all states.

So, I believe my original interpretation is correct: since black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1 in the initial state (and all states), we just need to ensure that at some point, we either have black_block_2 not on the table or we're holding green_block_1. This is satisfied in step 11 where we pick up green_block_1.

Similarly for constraint 8: If "black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1" in state s, then "black_block_2 is not clear" in state s or a later state.

Since black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1 in the initial state (and all states), we need to ensure that at some point, black_block_2 is not clear. This is satisfied in steps 9-10 where we stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_2.

And similarly for constraint 3: If "you are holding white_block_1" in state s, then "black_block_1 is not clear" or "black_block_4 is not clear" in state s or a later state. Well, actually constraint 3 can't logically be reading constraint 3 that way, because you can't look into future states to decide if an action is valid. If there's a constraint that blocks picking up white_block_1 unless we're going to put something on black_block_1 or black_block_4 afterwards, then it's not even a valid action in the first place. So I think the constraints should be read as "if A is true is some state s, then B is true in state s or some state after s".

Ok I'm convinced of my interpretation. Let me check the plan one more time to make sure it satisfies all constraints according to this interpretation:

1. "green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" and "you are holding black_block_1" -> Satisfied in steps 12-13.
2. "you are holding white_block_1" -> Satisfied in steps 5-6.
3. After holding white_block_1, either black_block_1 or black_block_4 should have a block on top of it -> Satisfied in step 6 (where white_block_1 is stacked on black_block_1).
4. "black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1" -> Satisfied throughout.
5. After black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1, either black_block_2 is not on the table or we are holding green_block_1 -> Satisfied in step 11.
6. "black_block_3 is not on the table" -> Satisfied throughout.
7. "black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1" -> Satisfied throughout.
8. After black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1, black_block_2 should have a block on top of it -> Satisfied in steps 9-10 (where yellow_block_1 is stacked on black_block_2).
9. "you are holding green_block_1" -> Satisfied in step 11.
10. "white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" -> Satisfied in step 6.

All constraints are satisfied, and our goal is achieved!

So, here's the final plan:

```
unstack black_block_4 black_block_3
putdown black_block_4
unstack black_block_3 white_block_1
stack black_block_3 black_block_4
unstack white_block_1 black_block_2
stack white_block_1 black_block_1
unstack white_block_1 black_block_1
putdown white_block_1
unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1
stack yellow_block_1 black_block_2
pickup green_block_1
stack green_block_1 white_block_1
pickup black_block_1
putdown black_block_1
```
