Let's analyze this complex planning problem step by step.

First, let's understand the initial state:
- red_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1
- brown_block_3 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_3
- red_block_2 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on top of red_block_2
- brown_block_2, purple_block_1, and green_block_1 are clear
- we're not holding any block

Visually, we have:
```
   brown_block_2     purple_block_1     green_block_1
        |                |                  |
   brown_block_1     brown_block_3      red_block_2
        |
   red_block_1
```

Our goal is simple: "brown_block_3 is clear"

But we have numerous constraints to satisfy:

1. At some point, purple_block_1 must not be clear
2. Before purple_block_1 is not clear, red_block_2 must not be on the table
3. At some point, either purple_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 OR brown_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1
4. At some point, brown_block_3 is not on top of red_block_2
5. After brown_block_3 is not on top of red_block_2, we must hold brown_block_1 at some point
6. At some point, brown_block_2 is not on top of brown_block_3
7. After brown_block_2 is not on top of brown_block_3, brown_block_3 must not be on the table at some point
8. At some point, red_block_2 must not be clear
9. After red_block_2 is not clear, brown_block_2 must not be on top of brown_block_1 at some point
10. At some point, brown_block_2 must not be on the table
11. After brown_block_2 is not on the table, green_block_1 must be on top of brown_block_2 at some point
12. At some point, purple_block_1 must not be on top of brown_block_3
13. Before purple_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_3, red_block_2 must be clear

Let's think through this carefully.

Currently, in the initial state, brown_block_3 has purple_block_1 on top of it, so it's not clear. Our goal is to make brown_block_3 clear, which means we need to remove purple_block_1 from it.

Constraint 12 says that at some point, purple_block_1 must not be on top of brown_block_3. This is aligned with our goal. 

Constraint 13 states that before removing purple_block_1 from brown_block_3, red_block_2 must be clear. But in the initial state, green_block_1 is on top of red_block_2. So, we need to remove green_block_1 from red_block_2 first.

So, our first steps seem to be:
1. Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2
2. Then, we can unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_3

Let's keep analyzing the constraints:

Constraint 1 says at some point, purple_block_1 must not be clear (i.e., there must be a block on top of it). 

Constraint 2 implies that before we place a block on top of purple_block_1, red_block_2 must not be on the table.

Constraint 3 says that at some point, either purple_block_1 is on top of red_block_1, or brown_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1.

Given these constraints and our goal, we need to:
1. Make red_block_2 not be on the table.
2. Place a block on top of purple_block_1.
3. Ensure either purple_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 or brown_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1.
4. End with brown_block_3 being clear.

Let's try to sketch a high-level plan:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2.
2. Pickup red_block_2 from the table (satisfying constraint 2).
3. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_3 (satisfying constraint 12).
4. Stack a block (maybe green_block_1) on top of purple_block_1 (satisfying constraint 1).
5. Stack purple_block_1 on top of red_block_1 (satisfying constraint 3).
6. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1 (preparing to satisfy constraint 9).
7. Stack brown_block_3 somewhere else (to ensure it's clear at the end).

But we need to be careful about the sequence because of the temporal constraints. Let's check the other constraints:

Constraint 4 says at some point, brown_block_3 is not on top of red_block_2. This is already true in the initial state.

Constraint 5 says after brown_block_3 is not on top of red_block_2, we must hold brown_block_1 at some point. Given that constraint 4 is already satisfied in the initial state, we need to ensure we hold brown_block_1 at some point.

Constraint 6 says at some point, brown_block_2 is not on top of brown_block_3. This is already true in the initial state.

Constraint 7 says after brown_block_2 is not on top of brown_block_3, brown_block_3 must not be on the table at some point. Given that constraint 6 is already satisfied in the initial state, we need to ensure brown_block_3 is not on the table at some point.

Constraint 8 says at some point, red_block_2 must not be clear. This is already true in the initial state (green_block_1 is on top of it).

Constraint 9 says after red_block_2 is not clear, brown_block_2 must not be on top of brown_block_1 at some point. Given that constraint 8 is already satisfied in the initial state, we need to ensure brown_block_2 is not on top of brown_block_1 at some point.

Constraint 10 says at some point, brown_block_2 must not be on the table. This is already true in the initial state (it's on top of brown_block_1).

Constraint 11 says after brown_block_2 is not on the table, green_block_1 must be on top of brown_block_2 at some point. Given that constraint 10 is already satisfied in the initial state, we need to ensure green_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2 at some point.

Based on these constraints, we need to ensure:
1. We hold brown_block_1 at some point (which means unstacking brown_block_2 from it first).
2. brown_block_3 is not on the table at some point.
3. brown_block_2 is not on top of brown_block_1 at some point.
4. green_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2 at some point.

Let's refine our plan:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2.
2. Stack green_block_1 on top of brown_block_2 (satisfying constraint 11).
3. Pickup red_block_2 from the table (satisfying constraint 2).
4. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_3 (satisfying constraint 12 and working towards our goal).
5. Stack purple_block_1 on top of red_block_1 (satisfying constraint 3).
6. Pickup brown_block_3 from the table (satisfying constraint 7).
7. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1 (satisfying constraint 9).
8. Stack brown_block_3 somewhere (maybe on the table or on another block, ensuring it's clear at the end).
9. Hold brown_block_1 (satisfying constraint 5).

But I'm noticing that some of the steps might be problematic because of the arm's capacity to hold only one block at a time. Let's be more precise:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2.
2. Stack green_block_1 on top of brown_block_2 (satisfying constraint 11).
3. Pickup red_block_2 from the table (satisfying constraint 2).
4. Stack red_block_2 somewhere.
5. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_3 (satisfying constraint 12 and working towards our goal).
6. Stack purple_block_1 on top of red_block_1 (satisfying constraint 3).
7. Unstack green_block_1 from brown_block_2.
8. Stack green_block_1 on top of purple_block_1 (satisfying constraint 1).
9. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1 (satisfying constraint 9).
10. Stack brown_block_2 somewhere.
11. Pickup brown_block_3 from the table (satisfying constraint 7).
12. Stack brown_block_3 on top of brown_block_1 (alternative way to satisfy constraint 3).
13. Hold brown_block_1 at some point (satisfying constraint 5).

Wait, now I'm realizing that some of these steps might break earlier constraints. Let's revisit and be even more meticulous.

Actually, the problem might be more complex than I initially thought. Let me review the constraints once more in terms of what we need to do.

Constraint 1: At some point, purple_block_1 must not be clear (i.e., there must be a block on top of it).
- Action required: Place a block on top of purple_block_1.

Constraint 2: Before we place a block on top of purple_block_1, red_block_2 must not be on the table.
- Action required: Remove red_block_2 from the table before placing a block on top of purple_block_1.

Constraint 3: At some point, either purple_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 or brown_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1.
- Action required: Either place purple_block_1 on top of red_block_1 or place brown_block_3 on top of brown_block_1.

Constraint 4: At some point, brown_block_3 is not on top of red_block_2.
- This is already true in the initial state, but we need to maintain it.

Constraint 5: After we've established that brown_block_3 is not on top of red_block_2, we must hold brown_block_1 at some point.
- Since constraint 4 is already satisfied, we need to hold brown_block_1 at some point in our plan.

Constraint 6: At some point, brown_block_2 is not on top of brown_block_3.
- This is already true in the initial state, but we need to maintain it.

Constraint 7: After we've established that brown_block_2 is not on top of brown_block_3, brown_block_3 must not be on the table at some point.
- Since constraint 6 is already satisfied, we need to ensure brown_block_3 is not on the table at some point.

Constraint 8: At some point, red_block_2 must not be clear.
- This is already true in the initial state (green_block_1 is on top of it).

Constraint 9: After we've established that red_block_2 is not clear, brown_block_2 must not be on top of brown_block_1 at some point.
- Since constraint 8 is already satisfied, we need to ensure brown_block_2 is not on top of brown_block_1 at some point.

Constraint 10: At some point, brown_block_2 must not be on the table.
- This is already true in the initial state (it's on top of brown_block_1).

Constraint 11: After we've established that brown_block_2 is not on the table, green_block_1 must be on top of brown_block_2 at some point.
- Since constraint 10 is already satisfied, we need to ensure green_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2 at some point.

Constraint 12: At some point, purple_block_1 must not be on top of brown_block_3.
- Action required: Remove purple_block_1 from brown_block_3. This is also a step toward our goal.

Constraint 13: Before removing purple_block_1 from brown_block_3, red_block_2 must be clear.
- Action required: Make red_block_2 clear (i.e., remove green_block_1 from it) before removing purple_block_1 from brown_block_3.

Our goal is to have brown_block_3 be clear, which means purple_block_1 (which is currently on top of it) should be moved elsewhere.

Let's summarize the actions we need to take:
1. Make red_block_2 clear (i.e., remove green_block_1 from it).
2. Remove purple_block_1 from brown_block_3.
3. Remove red_block_2 from the table.
4. Place a block on top of purple_block_1.
5. Either place purple_block_1 on top of red_block_1 or place brown_block_3 on top of brown_block_1.
6. Hold brown_block_1 at some point.
7. Ensure brown_block_3 is not on the table at some point.
8. Ensure brown_block_2 is not on top of brown_block_1 at some point.
9. Ensure green_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2 at some point.

Now, let's try to create a step-by-step plan:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2. (Addressing constraint 13)
2. Stack green_block_1 on top of brown_block_2. (Addressing constraint 11)
3. Pickup red_block_2 from the table. (Addressing constraint 2)
4. Putdown red_block_2 on the table. (We can't directly stack it without freeing our arm)
5. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_3. (Addressing constraint 12 and working towards our goal)
6. Stack purple_block_1 on top of red_block_1. (Addressing constraint 3)
7. Unstack green_block_1 from brown_block_2.
8. Stack green_block_1 on top of purple_block_1. (Addressing constraint 1)
9. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1. (Addressing constraint 9)
10. Stack brown_block_2 on the table. (Temporary, to free up our arm)
11. Unstack green_block_1 from purple_block_1. (Temporary, to reposition blocks)
12. Stack green_block_1 on top of brown_block_2. (Re-addressing constraint 11)
13. Pickup brown_block_3 from the table. (Addressing constraint 7)
14. Stack brown_block_3 on top of brown_block_1. (Alternative way to address constraint 3)
15. Unstack brown_block_3 from brown_block_1. (Ensuring brown_block_3 is clear as per our goal)
16. Putdown brown_block_3 on the table. (Our goal is achieved)

Wait, I made an error: at step 9, we're trying to unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1, but at this point, brown_block_2 has green_block_1 on top of it, so it's not clear. Let me think more carefully.

Let's start a new plan:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2. (Addressing constraint 13)
2. Stack green_block_1 on the table. (Temporary)
3. Pickup red_block_2 from the table. (Addressing constraint 2)
4. Stack red_block_2 on the table. (We need to free our arm)
5. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_3. (Addressing constraint 12 and working towards our goal)
6. Stack purple_block_1 on top of red_block_1. (Addressing constraint 3)
7. Pickup green_block_1 from the table.
8. Stack green_block_1 on top of purple_block_1. (Addressing constraint 1)
9. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1. (Addressing constraint 9)
10. Stack brown_block_2 on the table. (Temporary)
11. Pickup brown_block_1 from red_block_1. (Addressing constraint 5)
12. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table. (We need to free our arm)
13. Pickup brown_block_3 from the table. (Addressing constraint 7)
14. Stack brown_block_3 on top of brown_block_1. (Alternative way to address constraint 3)
15. Pickup green_block_1 from purple_block_1. (Temporary)
16. Stack green_block_1 on top of brown_block_2. (Addressing constraint 11)

But now I'm worried whether our goal - "brown_block_3 is clear" - is satisfied in the final state. In the sequence I laid out, brown_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1, so it should be clear. But I want to make sure this plan is consistent.

Let's revisit the plan:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2. (Addressing constraint 13)
- We now hold green_block_1, and red_block_2 is clear.

2. Putdown green_block_1 on the table. (Temporary)
- green_block_1 is on the table and clear. We're not holding anything.

3. Pickup red_block_2 from the table. (Addressing constraint 2)
- We now hold red_block_2, and it's not on the table.

4. Putdown red_block_2 on the table. (We need to free our arm)
- red_block_2 is back on the table and clear. We're not holding anything.

Wait, this doesn't make sense. Step 3 and 4 together are just a no-op. I might have to redo this.

The main issue I'm having is that we need to ensure red_block_2 is not on the table before placing a block on top of purple_block_1 (constraint 2). But this is a bit tricky because we need to also ensure that green_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2 at some point (constraint 11), and this might require us to move green_block_1 to brown_block_2.

Let's take a step back and be more methodical. I'll start the plan again:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2. (Addressing constraint 13)
- We now hold green_block_1, and red_block_2 is clear.

2. Stack green_block_1 on top of brown_block_2. (Addressing constraint 11)
- green_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2. We're not holding anything.

3. Pickup red_block_2 from the table. (Addressing constraint 2)
- We now hold red_block_2, and it's not on the table.

4. Stack red_block_2 on the table. (We need to free our arm)
- red_block_2 is back on the table and clear. We're not holding anything.

Again, steps 3 and 4 are a no-op. This is a bit tricky because the constraint 2 states: "If expression 'there is a block on top of purple_block_1, i.e., purple_block_1 is not clear' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'red_block_2 is not on the table'".

So, we need to ensure red_block_2 is not on the table before we place a block on top of purple_block_1. But once red_block_2 is not on the table, we need to do something with it. We can't just put it back on the table, as that would make the step pointless.

Let me try once more:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2. (Addressing constraint 13)
- We now hold green_block_1, and red_block_2 is clear.

2. Putdown green_block_1 on the table. (Temporary)
- green_block_1 is on the table and clear. We're not holding anything.

3. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1. (Addressing constraint 9)
- We now hold brown_block_2.

4. Stack brown_block_2 on the table. (Temporary)
- brown_block_2 is on the table and clear. We're not holding anything.

5. Pickup green_block_1 from the table.
- We now hold green_block_1.

6. Stack green_block_1 on top of brown_block_2. (Addressing constraint 11)
- green_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2. We're not holding anything.

7. Pickup red_block_2 from the table. (Addressing constraint 2)
- We now hold red_block_2, and it's not on the table.

8. Stack red_block_2 on top of green_block_1. (Temporary)
- red_block_2 is on top of green_block_1. We're not holding anything.

9. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_3. (Addressing constraint 12 and working towards our goal)
- We now hold purple_block_1, and brown_block_3 is clear (our goal).

10. Stack purple_block_1 on top of red_block_1. (Addressing constraint 3)
- purple_block_1 is on top of red_block_1. We're not holding anything.

11. Pickup brown_block_1 from red_block_1. (Addressing constraint 5)
- We now hold brown_block_1.

12. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table. (We need to free our arm)
- brown_block_1 is on the table and clear. We're not holding anything.

13. Pickup brown_block_3 from the table. (Addressing constraint 7)
- We now hold brown_block_3, and it's not on the table.

14. Stack brown_block_3 on top of brown_block_1. (Alternative way to address constraint 3)
- brown_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1 and is clear (our goal).

15. Unstack red_block_2 from green_block_1. (Temporary)
- We now hold red_block_2.

16. Stack red_block_2 on top of purple_block_1. (Addressing constraint 1)
- red_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1. We're not holding anything.

I think this plan covers all the constraints:
- Constraint 1: red_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1 in step 16.
- Constraint 2: red_block_2 is not on the table in step 7, before we eventually place red_block_2 on top of purple_block_1 in step 16.
- Constraint 3: purple_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 in step 10.
- Constraint 4: brown_block_3 is not on top of red_block_2 throughout (it's initially on the table, and later on brown_block_1).
- Constraint 5: We hold brown_block_1 in step 11, after establishing that brown_block_3 is not on top of red_block_2.
- Constraint 6: brown_block_2 is not on top of brown_block_3 throughout (they are in separate stacks).
- Constraint 7: brown_block_3 is not on the table in step 14, after establishing that brown_block_2 is not on top of brown_block_3.
- Constraint 8: red_block_2 is not clear in the initial state (green_block_1 is on top of it).
- Constraint 9: brown_block_2 is not on top of brown_block_1 in step 4, after establishing that red_block_2 is not clear.
- Constraint 10: brown_block_2 is not on the table in the initial state (it's on top of brown_block_1).
- Constraint 11: green_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2 in step 6, after establishing that brown_block_2 is not on the table.
- Constraint 12: purple_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_3 in step 10.
- Constraint 13: red_block_2 is clear in step 3, before removing purple_block_1 from brown_block_3 in step 9.

And our goal: brown_block_3 is clear in step 14 and remains clear until the end.

Actually, I realized we can combine some steps to make the plan more efficient:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2. (Addressing constraint 13)
2. Putdown green_block_1 on the table. (Temporary)
3. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1. (Addressing constraint 9)
4. Stack brown_block_2 on the table. (Temporary)
5. Pickup green_block_1 from the table.
6. Stack green_block_1 on top of brown_block_2. (Addressing constraint 11)
7. Pickup red_block_2 from the table. (Addressing constraint 2)
8. Stack red_block_2 on top of green_block_1. (Temporary)
9. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_3. (Addressing constraint 12 and working towards our goal)
10. Stack purple_block_1 on top of red_block_1. (Addressing constraint 3)
11. Unstack red_block_2 from green_block_1. (Temporary)
12. Stack red_block_2 on top of purple_block_1. (Addressing constraint 1)
13. Pickup brown_block_3 from the table. (Addressing constraint 7)
14. Stack brown_block_3 on top of brown_block_1. (Alternative way to address constraint 3)
15. Pickup brown_block_1 from red_block_1. (Addressing constraint 5)
16. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table. (Temporary)

But, I just noticed, in step 15, we're trying to pickup brown_block_1 from red_block_1, but based on my plan so far, brown_block_1 is not on red_block_1, and it has brown_block_3 on top of it. This is a mistake.

Also, I've not been tracking the state of the blocks carefully. Let me go through the plan step by step and track the state after each action:

Initial state:
- red_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1
- brown_block_3 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_3
- red_block_2 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on top of red_block_2
- brown_block_2, purple_block_1, and green_block_1 are clear
- we're not holding any block

Let's try once more:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2.
After this:
- red_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1
- brown_block_3 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_3
- red_block_2 is on the table and clear
- We're holding green_block_1

2. Stack green_block_1 on top of brown_block_2.
After this:
- red_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1
- green_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2
- brown_block_3 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_3
- red_block_2 is on the table and clear
- We're not holding any block

3. Pickup red_block_2 from the table.
After this:
- red_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1
- green_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2
- brown_block_3 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_3
- We're holding red_block_2

4. Stack red_block_2 on top of green_block_1.
After this:
- red_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1
- green_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2
- red_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
- brown_block_3 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_3
- We're not holding any block

5. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_3.
After this:
- red_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1
- green_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2
- red_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
- brown_block_3 is on the table and clear
- We're holding purple_block_1

6. Stack purple_block_1 on top of red_block_1.
This is problematic because red_block_1 has brown_block_1 on top of it, so it's not clear. We need to adjust our plan.

Actually, I think I made an error in reading the initial state. Let me review it once more...

From the initial state:
```
"red_block_1 is on the table"
"brown_block_1 is on top of red_block_1"
"brown_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1"
"brown_block_3 is on the table"
"purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_3"
"red_block_2 is on the table"
"green_block_1 is on top of red_block_2"
```

So visually:
```
   brown_block_2     purple_block_1     green_block_1
        |                |                  |
   brown_block_1     brown_block_3      red_block_2
        |
   red_block_1
```

So, I can't stack purple_block_1 on top of red_block_1 directly. I need to clear brown_block_1 from red_block_1 first, which means I need to clear brown_block_2 from brown_block_1 first, which means I might need to clear green_block_1 from brown_block_2 if it's already stacked there.

Let me start again:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2.
- We now hold green_block_1, and red_block_2 is clear.

2. Stack green_block_1 on the table.
- green_block_1 is on the table and clear. We're not holding anything.

3. Pickup red_block_2 from the table.
- We now hold red_block_2, and it's not on the table.

4. Stack red_block_2 on top of green_block_1.
- red_block_2 is on top of green_block_1. We're not holding anything.

5. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_3.
- We now hold purple_block_1, and brown_block_3 is clear.

6. Putdown purple_block_1 on the table.
- purple_block_1 is on the table and clear. We're not holding anything.

7. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1.
- We now hold brown_block_2.

8. Stack brown_block_2 on top of brown_block_3.
- brown_block_2 is on top of brown_block_3. We're not holding anything.

9. Unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1.
- We now hold brown_block_1, and red_block_1 is clear.

10. Stack brown_block_1 on the table.
- brown_block_1 is on the table and clear. We're not holding anything.

11. Pickup purple_block_1 from the table.
- We now hold purple_block_1.

12. Stack purple_block_1 on top of red_block_1.
- purple_block_1 is on top of red_block_1. We're not holding anything.

13. Unstack red_block_2 from green_block_1.
- We now hold red_block_2, and green_block_1 is clear.

14. Stack red_block_2 on top of purple_block_1.
- red_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1. We're not holding anything.

15. Pickup green_block_1 from the table.
- We now hold green_block_1.

16. Stack green_block_1 on top of brown_block_2.
- green_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2. We're not holding anything.

17. Pickup brown_block_1 from the table.
- We now hold brown_block_1.

18. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table.
- brown_block_1 is back on the table. We're not holding anything.

But now I realize I'm in a situation where brown_block_3 has brown_block_2 on top of it, which is not the goal. The goal is to have brown_block_3 be clear. I've misunderstood the plan.

Let me think about this problem once more:

Our goal is to have "brown_block_3 is clear".

In the initial state, brown_block_3 has purple_block_1 on top of it, so it's not clear. We need to remove purple_block_1 from brown_block_3 to achieve our goal.

Constraint 13 says that before removing purple_block_1 from brown_block_3, red_block_2 must be clear. In the initial state, green_block_1 is on top of red_block_2, so we need to remove green_block_1 from red_block_2 first.

Let's start with a simple plan to achieve our goal, and then we'll check if it satisfies all the constraints:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2. (to make red_block_2 clear)
2. Stack green_block_1 on the table. (temporary)
3. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_3. (to achieve our goal)
4. Putdown purple_block_1 on the table. (temporary)

At this point, we've achieved our goal: brown_block_3 is clear. But, we need to check if this plan satisfies all the constraints.

Looking at the constraints, I see that we haven't satisfied constraints 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. So, we need to elaborate on the plan.

Let's continue the plan to address these constraints:

5. Pickup green_block_1 from the table.
6. Stack green_block_1 on top of brown_block_2. (Addressing constraint 11)
7. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1. (Addressing constraint 9)
8. Stack brown_block_2 on the table. (Temporary)
9. Pickup purple_block_1 from the table.
10. Stack purple_block_1 on top of red_block_1. (Addressing constraint 3)
11. Pickup red_block_2 from the table. (Addressing constraint 2)
12. Stack red_block_2 on top of purple_block_1. (Addressing constraint 1)
13. Pickup brown_block_3 from the table. (Addressing constraint 7)
14. Stack brown_block_3 on top of brown_block_1. (Alternative way to address constraint 3)
15. Pickup brown_block_1 from red_block_1. (Addressing constraint 5)

But at step 7, when I want to unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1, I can't because green_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2.

This is getting complicated. Let me take a step back and start fresh. I need to think of a plan that doesn't get into these contradictions.

Actually, I think I've been overthinking this problem since constraint 3 can be satisfied in multiple ways. Let's try a simpler approach:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2. (to make red_block_2 clear)
2. Putdown green_block_1 on the table. (temporary)
3. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_3. (to achieve our goal)
4. Stack purple_block_1 on the table. (temporary)

At this point, brown_block_3 is clear (our goal), but we've only satisfied constraint 13. Let's continue:

5. Pickup brown_block_3 from the table.
6. Stack brown_block_3 on top of brown_block_1. (Addressing constraint 3 and 7)
7. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1. (Addressing constraint 9)
8. Putdown brown_block_2 on the table. (Temporary)
9. Pickup brown_block_3 from brown_block_1. (to keep brown_block_3 clear)
10. Putdown brown_block_3 on the table. (to keep brown_block_3 clear)
11. Pickup green_block_1 from the table.
12. Stack green_block_1 on top of brown_block_2. (Addressing constraint 11)
13. Pickup red_block_2 from the table. (Addressing constraint 2)
14. Stack red_block_2 on top of green_block_1. (Temporary)
15. Pickup purple_block_1 from the table.
16. Stack purple_block_1 on top of red_block_1. (Addressing constraint 3 in another way)
17. Unstack red_block_2 from green_block_1. (Temporary)
18. Stack red_block_2 on top of purple_block_1. (Addressing constraint 1)
19. Pickup brown_block_1 from red_block_1. (Addressing constraint 5, but this is problematic because purple_block_1 and then red_block_2 are on top of red_block_1)

Hmm, I'm still running into issues. Let's try a different approach:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2. (to make red_block_2 clear)
2. Stack green_block_1 on top of brown_block_2. (Addressing constraint 11)
3. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_3. (to achieve our goal and addressing constraint 12)
4. Putdown purple_block_1 on the table. (Temporary)
5. Pickup red_block_2 from the table. (Addressing constraint 2)
6. Stack red_block_2 on the table. (Temporary)

Wait, after step 5, I can't stack red_block_2 back on the table or I'd violate constraint 2. I need to stack it somewhere else.

Let's try once more:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2. (to make red_block_2 clear)
2. Stack green_block_1 on top of brown_block_2. (Addressing constraint 11)
3. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_3. (to achieve our goal and addressing constraint 12)
4. Stack purple_block_1 on top of red_block_1. (Addressing constraint 3)
5. Pickup red_block_2 from the table. (Addressing constraint 2)
6. Stack red_block_2 on top of purple_block_1. (Addressing constraint 1)
7. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1. (Addressing constraint 9, but this is problematic because green_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2)

I'm running into a chain of issues. It looks like I need to satisfy constraints in a specific order to avoid contradictions.

After reviewing all the constraints once more, I believe I need to satisfy constraint 5 and 7 at the end, after all the other constraints have been dealt with. Also, constraint 3 offers two alternatives, and I need to be careful which one I choose.

Let's try again, more methodically:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2. (addressing constraint 13)
2. Stack green_block_1 on the table. (temporary)
3. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_3. (addressing constraint 12 and working towards our goal)
4. Stack purple_block_1 on the table. (temporary)
5. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1. (addressing constraint 9)
6. Stack brown_block_2 on the table. (temporary)
7. Pickup green_block_1 from the table.
8. Stack green_block_1 on top of brown_block_2. (addressing constraint 11)
9. Pickup brown_block_3 from the table.
10. Stack brown_block_3 on top of brown_block_1. (addressing constraint 3 and 7)
11. Pickup brown_block_1 from red_block_1. (addressing constraint 5, but this won't work because brown_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1)

I'm still running into issues. Let's take a step back and reevaluate.

Actually, I realized the problem is that constraint 5 says: "After brown_block_3 is not on top of red_block_2, you must hold brown_block_1 at some point." Since brown_block_3 is not on top of red_block_2 in the initial state, we must hold brown_block_1 at some point. But to hold brown_block_1, we need to clear it first.

Let's try a different order:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2. (addressing constraint 13)
2. Stack green_block_1 on the table. (temporary)
3. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1. (addressing constraint 9)
4. Stack brown_block_2 on the table. (temporary)
5. Pickup brown_block_1 from red_block_1. (addressing constraint 5)
6. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table. (temporary)
7. Pickup green_block_1 from the table.
8. Stack green_block_1 on top of brown_block_2. (addressing constraint 11)
9. Pickup purple_block_1 from brown_block_3. (addressing constraint 12 and working towards our goal)
10. Stack purple_block_1 on top of red_block_1. (addressing constraint 3)
11. Pickup red_block_2 from the table. (addressing constraint 2)
12. Stack red_block_2 on top of purple_block_1. (addressing constraint 1)
13. Pickup brown_block_3 from the table.
14. Stack brown_block_3 on the table. (ensuring brown_block_3 is clear, our goal)

This plan seems to work, except that I've used redundant steps at the end. Let me review and refine:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2. (addressing constraint 13)
2. Stack green_block_1 on the table. (temporary)
3. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1. (addressing constraint 9)
4. Stack brown_block_2 on the table. (temporary)
5. Pickup brown_block_1 from red_block_1. (addressing constraint 5)
6. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table. (temporary)
7. Pickup green_block_1 from the table.
8. Stack green_block_1 on top of brown_block_2. (addressing constraint 11)
9. Pickup purple_block_1 from brown_block_3. (addressing constraint 12 and working towards our goal)
10. Stack purple_block_1 on top of red_block_1. (addressing constraint 3)
11. Pickup brown_block_3 from the table. (addressing constraint 7)
12. Stack brown_block_3 on top of brown_block_1. (alternative way to address constraint 3)
13. Pickup red_block_2 from the table. (addressing constraint 2)
14. Stack red_block_2 on top of purple_block_1. (addressing constraint 1)

Now, checking if our goal is satisfied: at the end of step 14, brown_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1 and nothing is on top of brown_block_3, so brown_block_3 is clear. Our goal is satisfied.

Now, let's make sure all constraints are satisfied:

- Constraint 1: red_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1 in step 14.
- Constraint 2: red_block_2 is not on the table in step 13, before placing red_block_2 on top of purple_block_1 in step 14.
- Constraint 3: purple_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 in step 10, and also brown_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1 in step 12 (we've satisfied both alternatives).
- Constraint 4: brown_block_3 is not on top of red_block_2 throughout.
- Constraint 5: We hold brown_block_1 in step 5.
- Constraint 6: brown_block_2 is not on top of brown_block_3 throughout.
- Constraint 7: brown_block_3 is not on the table in step 12.
- Constraint 8: red_block_2 is not clear in the initial state.
- Constraint 9: brown_block_2 is not on top of brown_block_1 in step 3.
- Constraint 10: brown_block_2 is not on the table in the initial state.
- Constraint 11: green_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2 in step 8.
- Constraint 12: purple_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_3 in step 9.
- Constraint 13: red_block_2 is clear in step 2, before removing purple_block_1 from brown_block_3 in step 9.

All constraints are satisfied, and our goal is achieved. However, I think we can improve the efficiency of this plan.

Specifically, there's no need to put brown_block_3 on top of brown_block_1 and then pick red_block_2 from the table. We can do it in the reverse order:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2. (addressing constraint 13)
2. Stack green_block_1 on the table. (temporary)
3. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1. (addressing constraint 9)
4. Stack brown_block_2 on the table. (temporary)
5. Pickup brown_block_1 from red_block_1. (addressing constraint 5)
6. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table. (temporary)
7. Pickup green_block_1 from the table.
8. Stack green_block_1 on top of brown_block_2. (addressing constraint 11)
9. Pickup purple_block_1 from brown_block_3. (addressing constraint 12 and working towards our goal)
10. Stack purple_block_1 on top of red_block_1. (addressing constraint 3)
11. Pickup red_block_2 from the table. (addressing constraint 2)
12. Stack red_block_2 on top of purple_block_1. (addressing constraint 1)
13. Pickup brown_block_3 from the table. (addressing constraint 7)
14. Stack brown_block_3 on top of brown_block_1. (alternative way to address constraint 3)

But wait, I'm overthinking. I'm actually duplicating constraint 3 by trying to satisfy both alternatives. I believe we only need to satisfy at least one of them, not both. But the order of my actions is fine. I'm just being redundant in my reasoning.

This plan looks good:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2. (addressing constraint 13)
2. Stack green_block_1 on the table. (temporary)
3. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1. (addressing constraint 9)
4. Stack brown_block_2 on the table. (temporary)
5. Pickup brown_block_1 from red_block_1. (addressing constraint 5)
6. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table. (temporary)
7. Pickup green_block_1 from the table.
8. Stack green_block_1 on top of brown_block_2. (addressing constraint 11)
9. Pickup purple_block_1 from brown_block_3. (addressing constraint 12 and working towards our goal)
10. Stack purple_block_1 on top of red_block_1. (addressing constraint 3)
11. Pickup red_block_2 from the table. (addressing constraint 2)
12. Stack red_block_2 on top of purple_block_1. (addressing constraint 1)
13. Pickup brown_block_3 from the table. (addressing constraint 7)
14. Stack brown_block_3 on top of brown_block_1. (alternative way to address constraint 3)

This plan satisfies all constraints, and our goal is achieved.

Actually, one optimization I can make is to directly place brown_block_1 on top of red_block_1 back after picking it up in step 5:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2. (addressing constraint 13)
2. Stack green_block_1 on the table. (temporary)
3. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1. (addressing constraint 9)
4. Stack brown_block_2 on the table. (temporary)
5. Pickup brown_block_1 from red_block_1. (addressing constraint 5)
6. Stack brown_block_1 on the table. (temporary)
7. Pickup green_block_1 from the table.
8. Stack green_block_1 on top of brown_block_2. (addressing constraint 11)
9. Pickup purple_block_1 from brown_block_3. (addressing constraint 12 and working towards our goal)
10. Stack purple_block_1 on top of red_block_1. (addressing constraint 3)
11. Pickup red_block_2 from the table. (addressing constraint 2)
12. Stack red_block_2 on top of purple_block_1. (addressing constraint 1)
13. Pickup brown_block_3 from the table. (addressing constraint 7)
14. Stack brown_block_3 on top of brown_block_1. (alternative way to address constraint 3)

Wait, I need to revise the step 6. I said "putdown" earlier, but I'm using Stack here. The correct action should be "putdown", since I'm placing it on the table.

Actually, the optimization I tried to make is wrong.

Let's finalize the plan:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2. (addressing constraint 13)
2. Putdown green_block_1 on the table. (temporary)
3. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1. (addressing constraint 9)
4. Putdown brown_block_2 on the table. (temporary)
5. Pickup brown_block_1 from red_block_1. (addressing constraint 5)
6. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table. (temporary)
7. Pickup green_block_1 from the table.
8. Stack green_block_1 on top of brown_block_2. (addressing constraint 11)
9. Pickup purple_block_1 from brown_block_3. (addressing constraint 12 and working towards our goal)
10. Stack purple_block_1 on top of red_block_1. (addressing constraint 3)
11. Pickup red_block_2 from the table. (addressing constraint 2)
12. Stack red_block_2 on top of purple_block_1. (addressing constraint 1)
13. Pickup brown_block_3 from the table. (addressing constraint 7)
14. Stack brown_block_3 on top of brown_block_1. (additional step to satisfy constraint 3)

At the end of the plan, we have:
- brown_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1, and nothing is on top of brown_block_3. So, brown_block_3 is clear, which is our goal.
- red_block_1 is on the table, with purple_block_1 on top of it and red_block_2 on top of purple_block_1.
- brown_block_2 is on the table with green_block_1 on top of it.

All constraints have been satisfied, and our goal is achieved.

Actually this plan might not be optimal. Let me check if I can reduce the number of steps.

Looking at the constraints again, I'm not sure if we need to place green_block_1 on top of brown_block_2 (constraint 11) after we've removed brown_block_2 from brown_block_1 (constraint 9). I'm going to try to optimize by reordering some steps.

1. Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2. (addressing constraint 13)
2. Putdown green_block_1 on the table. (temporary)
3. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1. (addressing constraint 9)
4. Putdown brown_block_2 on the table. (temporary)
5. Pickup green_block_1 from the table.
6. Stack green_block_1 on top of brown_block_2. (addressing constraint 11)
7. Pickup brown_block_1 from red_block_1. (addressing constraint 5)
8. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table. (temporary)
9. Pickup purple_block_1 from brown_block_3. (addressing constraint 12 and working towards our goal)
10. Stack purple_block_1 on top of red_block_1. (addressing constraint 3)
11. Pickup red_block_2 from the table. (addressing constraint 2)
12. Stack red_block_2 on top of purple_block_1. (addressing constraint 1)
13. Pickup brown_block_3 from the table. (addressing constraint 7)
14. Stack brown_block_3 on top of brown_block_1. (additional step to satisfy constraint 3)

This still looks like 14 steps. I'm not sure if I can optimize further. Let's double-check our reasoning:

Constraint 13 says "before removing purple_block_1 from brown_block_3, red_block_2 must be clear." This is why we're unstacking green_block_1 from red_block_2 in step 1.

Constraint 9 says "after red_block_2 is not clear, brown_block_2 must not be on top of brown_block_1 at some point." This is why we're unstacking brown_block_2 from brown_block_1 in step 3.

Constraint 11 says "after brown_block_2 is not on the table, green_block_1 must be on top of brown_block_2 at some point." This is why we're stacking green_block_1 on top of brown_block_2 in step 6.

Constraint 5 says "after brown_block_3 is not on top of red_block_2, we must hold brown_block_1 at some point." This is why we're picking up brown_block_1 in step 7.

Constraint 12 says "at some point, purple_block_1 must not be on top of brown_block_3." This is why we're unstacking purple_block_1 from brown_block_3 in step 9.

Constraint 3 says "at some point, either purple_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 or brown_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1." This is why we're stacking purple_block_1 on top of red_block_1 in step 10 (and also brown_block_3 on top of brown_block_1 in step 14, but one of them would suffice).

Constraint 2 says "before we place a block on top of purple_block_1, red_block_2 must not be on the table." This is why we're picking up red_block_2 from the table in step 11 before stacking it on top of purple_block_1 in step 12.

Constraint 1 says "at some point, purple_block_1 must not be clear." This is why we're stacking red_block_2 on top of purple_block_1 in step 12.

Constraint 7 says "after brown_block_2 is not on top of brown_block_3, brown_block_3 must not be on the table at some point." This is why we're picking up brown_block_3 from the table in step 13.

It seems like all steps are necessary given the constraints. Thus, our plan with 14 steps is optimal.

Let's rewrite the final plan:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2.
2. Putdown green_block_1.
3. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1.
4. Putdown brown_block_2.
5. Pickup green_block_1.
6. Stack green_block_1 on brown_block_2.
7. Pickup brown_block_1 from red_block_1.
8. Putdown brown_block_1.
9. Pickup purple_block_1 from brown_block_3.
10. Stack purple_block_1 on red_block_1.
11. Pickup red_block_2.
12. Stack red_block_2 on purple_block_1.
13. Pickup brown_block_3.
14. Stack brown_block_3 on brown_block_1.

Upon closer inspection, I'm concerned that I might've mixed up the order of some constraints. Let me check if the state after each step still satisfies the constraints in the right order.

Actually, I think I misinterpreted constraint 9. It says "after red_block_2 is not clear, brown_block_2 must not be on top of brown_block_1 at some point." This means after red_block_2 has something on top of it (which is true in the initial state with green_block_1 on top of it), brown_block_2 should not be on top of brown_block_1 at some point.

But, in the initial state, brown_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1. So, we need to ensure that brown_block_2 is removed from brown_block_1 at some point. This is addressed by step 3 and 4.

Let me check all the constraints one more time.

- Constraint 1: red_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1 in step 12.
- Constraint 2: red_block_2 is not on the table in step 11, before placing red_block_2 on top of purple_block_1 in step 12.
- Constraint 3: purple_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 in step 10, and also brown_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1 in step 14 (we've satisfied both alternatives).
- Constraint 4: brown_block_3 is not on top of red_block_2 throughout.
- Constraint 5: We hold brown_block_1 in step 7, after establishing that brown_block_3 is not on top of red_block_2.
- Constraint 6: brown_block_2 is not on top of brown_block_3 throughout.
- Constraint 7: brown_block_3 is not on the table in step 14, after establishing that brown_block_2 is not on top of brown_block_3.
- Constraint 8: red_block_2 is not clear in the initial state.
- Constraint 9: brown_block_2 is not on top of brown_block_1 in step 3, after establishing that red_block_2 is not clear.
- Constraint 10: brown_block_2 is not on the table in the initial state.
- Constraint 11: green_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2 in step 6, after establishing that brown_block_2 is not on the table.
- Constraint 12: purple_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_3 in step 9.
- Constraint 13: red_block_2 is clear in step and 2, before removing purple_block_1 from brown_block_3 in step 9.

Yes, all constraints are satisfied in the right order. I'm confident that the plan is both valid and optimal.

1. Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2.
2. Putdown green_block_1.
3. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1.
4. Putdown brown_block_2.
5. Pickup green_block_1.
6. Stack green_block_1 on brown_block_2.
7. Pickup brown_block_1 from red_block_1.
8. Putdown brown_block_1.
9. Pickup purple_block_1 from brown_block_3.
10. Stack purple_block_1 on red_block_1.
11. Pickup red_block_2.
12. Stack red_block_2 on purple_block_1.
13. Pickup brown_block_3.
14. Stack brown_block_3 on brown_block_1.
