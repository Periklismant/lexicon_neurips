Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to have the robotic arm holding grey_block_1. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy. Hmm, let's start by understanding the initial state and the goal.

In the initial state, blue_block_1 is on the table with black_block_1 on top, and grey_block_1 on top of black_block_1. Then, grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1. So the stack is blue_block_1, black_block_1, grey_block_1, grey_block_2. Another stack is yellow_block_1 with brown_block_1 on top. Red_block_1 is alone on the table. The constraints are a bit complex, so I need to make sure each is satisfied.

First, the constraints:

1. Always: grey_block_2 is not on the table. Since initially grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1, which is on black_block_1 etc., as long as we don't putdown grey_block_2, this should hold. But we need to ensure that in every state, so we can't putdown grey_block_2 anywhere. So grey_block_2 must stay on top of other blocks or being held. But the goal is to hold grey_block_1. Hmm, but to get to grey_block_1, we might need to unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1. Wait, but unstacking grey_block_2 would require that we are not holding anything. So maybe first unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1, put it somewhere, but since we can't put it on the table (because of constraint 1), we need to put it on another block. Let me think.

Wait, the initial state has grey_block_2 on grey_block_1. So to get to grey_block_1, we need to remove grey_block_2 first. The action would be unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1. Then, since we can't put it on the table (due to constraint 1), we need to stack it somewhere else. Where? Maybe on red_block_1? But red_block_1 is clear initially. So stack grey_block_2 on red_block_1. That way, grey_block_2 is not on the table. Then, after that, we can unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1. Wait, but after removing grey_block_2, grey_block_1 is clear. Then, unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1. But to unstack, the robotic arm must not be holding anything. So after unstacking grey_block_2 and stacking it on red_block_1, the arm is holding grey_block_2. So we need to put it down on red_block_1. So stack grey_block_2 red_block_1. Then, putdown? Wait, no, stack action would place it on red_block_1, which is allowed. Then, after that, the arm is free again. Then we can unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1, which would require that grey_block_1 is clear (which it is now) and that the arm isn't holding anything. So after that unstack, we would be holding grey_block_1, which is the goal. Wait, but that might be too quick. Let me check the steps.

Wait, initial stack: blue_block_1 (table), black_block_1 on blue, grey_block_1 on black, grey_block_2 on grey. So to get grey_block_1, need to unstack grey_block_2 first. Let's start:

1. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1. Preconditions: grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1, grey_block_2 is clear (which it is), and arm is empty. Yes. After unstack, arm holds grey_block_2, and grey_block_1 becomes clear.

Then, need to stack grey_block_2 somewhere. Since we can't put it on the table (constraint 1), must stack it on a clear block. Available clear blocks: red_block_1 is clear. So stack grey_block_2 red_block_1. Now, red_block_1 is not clear. Then, the arm is empty again. Now, grey_block_1 is clear. So next step is to unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1. Preconditions: grey_block_1 is on black_block_1, and clear. Yes. So unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1. Now, the arm is holding grey_block_1, which is the goal. But wait, that's only three actions. But we have to check all constraints.

But wait, the constraints also require that certain conditions hold in some state, and others have implications. Let's check each constraint.

First constraint: grey_block_2 is not on the table in every state. Our plan so far never puts it on the table, so that's okay.

Second constraint: at least one state where yellow_block_1 is not clear. Currently, in initial state, brown_block_1 is on yellow_block_1, so yellow_block_1 is not clear. Wait, initial state: brown_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, and brown_block_1 is clear. So in the initial state, yellow_block_1 is not clear. So that condition is already satisfied. So if we don't remove brown_block_1 from yellow_block_1, then that condition is already met. But in the current plan, we are not touching the yellow_block_1 stack. So that's okay. But the third constraint says that whenever yellow_block_1 is not clear in a state, then either black_block_1 is on brown_block_1 or holding black_block_1 must hold at that state or later. Wait, but in the initial state, yellow_block_1 is not clear, so we need to check if in the initial state or after, either black_block_1 is on brown_block_1 or the arm is holding black_block_1. But initially, black_block_1 is on blue_block_1, so that's not on brown_block_1. And the arm isn't holding anything. So this is a problem. Because the initial state already violates the implication of the third constraint. Wait, no. The third constraint says: if at any state s, yellow_block_1 is not clear, then in s or some state after s, either black_block_1 is on brown_block_1 or holding black_block_1. But the initial state has yellow_block_1 not clear (because brown_block_1 is on it), so we need to ensure that at some point after the initial state, either black_block_1 is on brown_block_1 or the arm holds black_block_1. But our current plan doesn't do that. So this is a problem. Therefore, the initial state already violates the third constraint? Wait no. The constraint says that whenever in some state s, yellow is not clear, then in s or after, the condition must hold. So in the initial state, since s is part of the plan (the starting point), then we need that in the initial state, either black_block_1 is on brown_block_1 or the arm is holding black_block_1. But in the initial state, neither is true. So the initial state violates the constraint. Wait, but the initial state is part of the problem's given state. So does that mean the constraints are only for the states generated by the plan, not the initial state? Hmm, the problem statement says "a valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints". So the constraints apply to all states in the plan's execution, including the initial state. But the initial state has yellow_block_1 not clear, but there's no black_block_1 on brown_block_1 or the arm holding black_block_1. So the initial state itself violates the third constraint, which would make the problem unsolvable. But that's impossible. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the constraints. Let me recheck.

The third constraint: If expression "yellow_block_1 is not clear" holds in some state s, then the condition "black on brown or holding black" must hold at s or after. But in the initial state, s is the start. So the initial state s has yellow not clear, but the condition (black on brown or holding black) is not true. Therefore, the initial state violates this constraint. But that's part of the problem's given initial state. Therefore, this suggests that the problem as stated is impossible? But the user is expecting a solution. So perhaps I made a mistake here. Wait, maybe the constraints apply only to the states generated by the plan, not the initial state. Because the initial state is given, and the constraints are for the plan's execution. Let me recheck the problem statement.

The constraints are: "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints". So the plan must ensure that during its execution (i.e., the sequence of states resulting from applying the plan's actions starting from the initial state), all the constraints are satisfied. So the initial state is part of the plan's execution. Therefore, the initial state must satisfy the constraints. But in the initial state, the third constraint is violated. Therefore, the problem as stated is impossible. But that can't be right. Therefore, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the constraints.

Wait, the third constraint is an implication. The antecedent is "if in some state s, yellow is not clear", then the consequent must hold. So, if during the plan's execution, any state s has yellow not clear, then in s or a subsequent state, black on brown or holding black must be true. So the initial state s0 has yellow not clear, so we need that in s0 or any state after s0, black is on brown or the arm holds black. But in s0, neither is true. Therefore, during the plan's execution, after s0, there must be a state where either black is on brown or the arm holds black. Therefore, the plan must include an action that at some point places black on brown or picks up black_block_1. So the plan must include such an action.

So, in our current plan, we only unstack grey_block_2, stack it on red, then unstack grey_block_1. So during this plan, after the initial state, the next states would be after unstacking grey_block_2 (arm holds grey_2), then after stacking grey_2 on red (arm empty), then after unstacking grey_1 (arm holds grey_1). In none of these steps do we have black_block_1 on brown_block_1 or holding black_block_1. Therefore, the third constraint is violated because the initial state s0 has yellow not clear, but during the plan's execution, there's no state where black is on brown or held. So the plan is invalid.

Therefore, we need to modify the plan to include an action that either moves black_block_1 onto brown_block_1 or picks up black_block_1. But how? Let's think.

Alternatively, maybe during the plan, after moving brown_block_1 off yellow_block_1, we can place black_block_1 there. Wait, but the constraint requires that if yellow is not clear (which in the initial state it is), then at some point, black is on brown or held. But if during the plan, we move brown_block_1 from yellow_block_1, then yellow_block_1 becomes clear. But the constraint is about states where yellow is not clear. So if during the plan, after moving brown_block_1, yellow becomes clear, then the constraint would only apply to the states where yellow is not clear. However, the initial state is such a state, so we still need to address that.

So the plan must include, at some point, either black_block_1 is placed on brown_block_1 or the arm holds black_block_1.

Let's think: how can we do that. Let's say after unstacking grey_block_2 and stacking it on red, then we have the arm empty. Then, perhaps we can unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1. Wait, but black_block_1 is under grey_block_1. So to unstack black_block_1, we need to first remove whatever is on top of it. But in the initial state, black_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top. After unstacking grey_block_2, then grey_block_1 is still on black_block_1. So we can't unstack black_block_1 unless we remove grey_block_1 first. Which is what we need to do to get grey_block_1. So perhaps after unstacking grey_block_2 and stacking it on red, we can unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1. Then, the arm is holding grey_block_1 (goal achieved), but we also need to address the third constraint. Wait, but the third constraint requires that whenever yellow is not clear, then in that state or later, black is on brown or held. Since yellow is not clear in the initial state, and the plan must include at least one state where black is on brown or held. So even if in the initial state, the constraint is triggered, the plan must have an action that satisfies the consequent. So during the plan, after s0, there must be a state where black is on brown or held.

So perhaps after achieving the goal (holding grey_block_1), we can stack grey_block_1 onto brown_block_1, but then we need to pick up black_block_1. But that complicates things.

Alternatively, after unstacking grey_block_2 and stacking it on red, the arm is empty. Then, maybe we can pick up brown_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (since brown_block_1 is clear). Then put it down, but that would make yellow_block_1 clear. But that might affect other constraints. Wait, but the constraint requires that at least one state has yellow not clear. The initial state satisfies that, so even if we later make it clear, it's okay as long as at least one state (the initial state) has it. But the third constraint is a conditional: whenever yellow is not clear in a state, then the consequent must hold. So if during the plan, after some action, yellow becomes clear, then the constraint would not apply to that state. But in the initial state, it's not clear, so the constraint applies there.

So back to the third constraint: the initial state has yellow not clear, so the plan must include that in s0 or after, black is on brown or held. Since s0 is part of the plan's execution, and in s0, it's not true, the plan must have a subsequent state where either black is on brown or held. Therefore, the plan must include an action that achieves one of those.

So perhaps after achieving the goal of holding grey_block_1, we need to do something else. But the problem states that the plan must end when the goal is achieved. Or does the goal require that the final state is holding grey_block_1, and the plan can have other actions after that? No, the problem says the plan must bring about the goal, which is "you are holding grey_block_1". So the plan ends when that is achieved. Therefore, the final action must be to pick up grey_block_1, and after that, the plan ends. But then, in the steps before that, we need to ensure that the third constraint is satisfied.

So in the steps leading up to holding grey_block_1, there must be a state where black is on brown or the arm holds black. Let's think: how can we insert that into the plan.

Alternative approach: after moving grey_block_2 to red, perhaps unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1. But to do that, we need to first remove grey_block_1 from black_block_1. But grey_block_1 is under grey_block_2. Wait, no. After moving grey_block_2, grey_block_1 is clear. So we can unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1. Wait, but if we unstack grey_block_1, then we can hold it, which is the goal. But then, after that, how do we satisfy the third constraint?

Wait, perhaps after unstacking grey_block_2 and stacking it on red, we can then unstack brown_block_1 from yellow_block_1. Then, hold brown_block_1, then stack black_block_1 onto brown_block_1. Then, after that, unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1. Let's see:

1. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 → hold grey_2
2. stack grey_block_2 red_block_1 → grey_2 on red, arm empty
3. unstack brown_block_1 yellow_block_1 → hold brown_1
4. stack brown_block_1 black_block_1 → brown_1 on black, but black is on blue. Wait, but stack requires that the target block is clear. Black_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top. So black_block_1 is not clear. Therefore, can't stack brown_block_1 on black_block_1. So that's impossible.

Alternatively, after step 3 (holding brown_block_1), stack brown_block_1 on some other block. But to stack, the target must be clear. Where can we put it? Maybe on red_block_1, but grey_block_2 is already there. Or on blue_block_1? But blue_block_1 has black_block_1. So no. Or on yellow_block_1 again. But that would make yellow not clear again. But then we could stack brown_block_1 back on yellow, but that doesn't help.

Alternatively, after step 3, putdown brown_block_1 on the table. But the constraint says grey_block_2 is not on the table, but brown_block_1 can be. But putting brown_block_1 on the table would make yellow_block_1 clear, which affects the "at least one state where yellow is not clear" constraint. But since the initial state already satisfies that, it's okay. However, after putting brown_block_1 down, yellow is clear. But then, the third constraint only applies to states where yellow is not clear, which would be the initial state and any other state where brown is on yellow. So after moving brown_block_1 off yellow, the only state where yellow is not clear is the initial state. So the third constraint's antecedent is true in the initial state, and the consequent must be true in the initial state or after. So the plan must have an action that causes black_block_1 to be on brown_block_1 or holding black_block_1 at some point after the initial state.

So, perhaps after moving grey_block_2 to red, then unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1. But to do that, we need to first remove grey_block_1 from black_block_1. Because currently, grey_block_1 is on black_block_1. So we need to unstack grey_block_1 first. But to unstack grey_block_1, we need to unstack it from black_block_1. But grey_block_1 is under grey_block_2. Wait, no. After moving grey_block_2, grey_block_1 is clear. So steps:

1. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 → hold grey_2
2. stack grey_block_2 red_block_1 → arm empty
3. unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1 → hold grey_1 (goal achieved)

But this plan doesn't address the third constraint. So during the plan's execution, after the initial state, there's no state where black_block_1 is on brown_block_1 or held. Therefore, the third constraint is violated.

So to satisfy the third constraint, we need to have a state after the initial state where black_block_1 is on brown_block_1 or held. Let's see.

Alternative approach: After step 2 (stack grey_2 on red), instead of proceeding to unstack grey_1, we can do something else. For example:

3. unstack brown_block_1 yellow_block_1 → hold brown_1
4. stack brown_block_1 black_block_1 → but black_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top, so it's not clear. Therefore, can't stack brown_block_1 on black_block_1.

Alternatively, after step 3 (holding brown_1), putdown brown_block_1 somewhere else, but that doesn't help. Or stack brown_block_1 on blue_block_1? But blue is on the table, but black_block_1 is on blue. So no, stack requires the target to be clear.

Alternatively, after step 3, stack brown_block_1 on grey_block_2 (which is on red). But grey_block_2 is clear (after step 2). So stack brown_1 on grey_2. Then brown_1 is on grey_2, which is on red. But then, in this state, yellow_block_1 is clear. But the constraint about yellow being not clear is already satisfied in the initial state. However, this action would make black_block_1 still on blue, and not on brown_block_1, so it doesn't help with the third constraint.

Alternatively, after step 3 (holding brown_1), stack brown_block_1 on blue_block_1. But blue_block_1 has black_block_1 on top. So blue_block_1 is not clear. So cannot stack.

Alternatively, unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1. But black_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top. So we need to unstack grey_block_1 first. So:

After step 2, we can:

3. unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1 → hold grey_1 (goal)
But then the plan ends here, but we haven't addressed the third constraint.

Alternatively, after step 2, we need to move black_block_1. But how? Since black_block_1 is under grey_block_1. After unstacking grey_block_1 (step 3), then black_block_1 is clear. So step 4: unstack black_block_1 blue_block_1 → hold black_block_1. Now, holding black_block_1 satisfies the third constraint's consequent (holding black_block_1). Then, step 5: stack black_block_1 brown_block_1. But brown_block_1 is on yellow_block_1. So we need to check if brown_block_1 is clear. Initially, brown_block_1 is clear. So stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1. But after step 3, we are holding grey_block_1 (the goal). So maybe after achieving the goal, we can putdown grey_block_1 and do other actions? No, because the plan must end when the goal is achieved. Wait, the goal is to have the arm holding grey_block_1. So the final action must be the one that results in holding grey_block_1. So any actions after that are not part of the plan. So the plan must end when the goal is achieved. Therefore, any steps after achieving the goal are not allowed. Therefore, we need to have the third constraint satisfied before or at the step where we achieve the goal.

So, in the plan, before achieving the goal, we must have a step where black_block_1 is on brown_block_1 or held. Let's see:

Alternative plan:

1. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 → hold grey_2
2. stack grey_block_2 red_block_1 → arm empty
3. unstack brown_block_1 yellow_block_1 → hold brown_1
4. stack brown_block_1 black_block_1 → but black_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top; not clear. So this fails.
So this approach doesn't work.

Alternative idea: After step 2, unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1. But black_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top. So we need to unstack grey_block_1 first. So:

1. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 → hold grey_2
2. stack grey_block_2 red_block_1 → arm empty
3. unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1 → hold grey_1 (goal achieved)
But then, we need to have a state where black is on brown or held. But during the plan, after the initial state, we don't have such a state. So the third constraint is violated.

So perhaps we need to insert a step where we hold black_block_1. Let's see:

After step 2 (arm empty), instead of unstacking grey_block_1, we can:

3. unstack black_block_1 blue_block_1 → but black_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top. So we can't unstack it until grey_block_1 is removed. So step 3 must be unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1, which requires that grey_block_1 is clear (which it is after step 2). Then:

3. unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1 → hold grey_1 (but this is the goal)
But then, we still haven't addressed the third constraint.

Alternatively, after unstacking grey_block_2 and stacking it on red, then:

3. pickup black_block_1 → but black_block_1 is on blue_block_1, not on the table. So pickup can't be done. So we need to unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1, which requires that black_block_1 is clear. But black_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top. So we need to remove grey_block_1 first. Which is what we need to do to achieve the goal. So this seems like a loop.

Wait, perhaps we can do:

1. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 → hold grey_2
2. stack grey_block_2 red_block_1 → arm empty
3. unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1 → hold grey_1 (goal)
4. putdown grey_block_1 → but this would make grey_1 on the table. Then, pickup black_block_1 (since it's on blue_block_1 and clear now). But putting down grey_block_1 would allow us to pickup black_block_1. But the goal is to be holding grey_block_1, so step 3 is the last action. So steps after that are not part of the plan. So this doesn't help.

Alternative approach: Let's try to have the arm hold black_block_1 at some point. To do that, after unstacking grey_block_2 and stacking it on red, we need to unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1. But black_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top, so we need to first unstack grey_block_1. Which is the goal. So it's a catch-22.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Let's list all constraints again to see if there are other constraints we need to satisfy that might influence the plan.

Other constraints:

4. At least one state where black_block_1 is clear. Initially, black_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top, so not clear. After unstacking grey_block_1, black_block_1 becomes clear. So in the step after unstacking grey_block_1, black_block_1 is clear. So that satisfies constraint 4.

5. If black_block_1 is clear in some state, then there must be an earlier state where either yellow_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_1 is clear. Initially, yellow_block_1 is on the table, and blue_block_1 is not clear (black_block_1 is on it). So the earlier state (like the initial state) has yellow on table and blue not clear. But the condition requires that in an earlier state, either yellow is not on the table (which it is on the table) or blue is clear (which it is not). So neither condition holds in the initial state. Therefore, if black_block_1 becomes clear (after unstacking grey_block_1), then there must be an earlier state where either yellow is not on table or blue is clear. But the initial state is the only earlier state, and neither holds. So this would violate constraint 5. Therefore, the plan must ensure that before black_block_1 becomes clear, there's a state where yellow is not on the table or blue is clear.

Wait, but the initial state has yellow on the table. So if we have a state where yellow is not on the table before black_block_1 becomes clear, that would satisfy the antecedent of constraint 5. But how can we make yellow not on the table? Yellow is on the table initially. To have it not on the table, we need to stack it onto another block. For example, move brown_block_1 from yellow to somewhere else, then pickup yellow and stack it. But that seems like a lot of steps.

Alternatively, if we can make blue_block_1 clear before black_block_1 becomes clear. But blue_block_1 has black_block_1 on top, so to make blue clear, need to remove black_block_1. But black_block_1 is under grey_block_1 and grey_block_2. So it's a chicken and egg problem.

This suggests that the plan as initially conceived (unstack grey_2, stack on red, unstack grey_1) violates constraint 5. Because when black_block_1 becomes clear (after unstacking grey_1), there's no earlier state where yellow is not on table or blue is clear. Therefore, the plan is invalid.

Therefore, we need to adjust the plan to satisfy constraint 5.

Constraint 5: If black_block_1 is clear in some state s, then there exists an earlier state where either yellow is not on table or blue is clear.

In the current plan, black_block_1 becomes clear in the state after unstacking grey_block_1. So we need to have an earlier state (before that step) where either yellow is not on table or blue is clear.

But in the initial state, yellow is on table and blue is not clear. So we need to create a state before unstacking grey_1 where either yellow is not on table or blue is clear.

How to make yellow not on table: we need to move it. For example, pick up yellow_block_1 and stack it somewhere. But yellow_block_1 has brown_block_1 on top. So to pickup yellow_block_1, we need to first remove brown_block_1. Which is possible. So steps:

1. unstack brown_block_1 yellow_block_1 → hold brown_1
2. stack brown_block_1 somewhere (e.g., on red_block_1, but grey_block_2 is there. Or on blue_block_1? But blue has black_block_1. So stack brown_block_1 on table. But that would make yellow_block_1 clear. But we need to move yellow. So after step 1, putdown brown_block_1.

But let's think:

1. unstack brown_block_1 yellow_block_1 → hold brown_1
2. putdown brown_block_1 on table → now brown is on table, yellow is clear.
3. pickup yellow_block_1 → now holding yellow.
4. stack yellow_block_1 somewhere (e.g., on brown_block_1). Now yellow is not on table.

But this seems like a lot of steps. Then, after this, we can proceed to unstack grey_block_2, etc. But this would take more steps. Let's see if this helps with constraint 5.

If we have a state where yellow is not on the table (step 4), then when later black_block_1 becomes clear, there's an earlier state (step 4) where yellow is not on table. So that would satisfy constraint 5.

But this adds several steps. Also, need to check other constraints.

But the goal is to hold grey_block_1. So after moving yellow, we need to get back to the original problem of unstacking grey_block_2 and grey_block_1.

This is getting quite complex. Let's try to outline a possible plan that satisfies all constraints.

Alternative plan steps:

1. unstack brown_block_1 yellow_block_1 → hold brown_1
2. stack brown_block_1 red_block_1 → brown on red, red is not clear anymore.
   Now, yellow_block_1 is clear. But the constraint requiring at least one state where yellow is not clear is already satisfied by the initial state. So no problem.
3. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 → hold grey_2
4. stack grey_block_2 red_block_1 → but red has brown_block_1. So can't stack unless brown_block_1 is clear. But after step 2, brown_block_1 is on red and clear. So step 4 would stack grey_2 on brown_1? Wait, no. If we stack grey_2 on red_block_1, but red_block_1 already has brown_block_1. Wait, no. Blocks can only be stacked on blocks that are clear. So after step 2, brown_block_1 is on red_block_1. So red_block_1 is not clear. So we can't stack grey_2 on red_block_1 in step 4. Therefore, step 4 is invalid. So perhaps after step 2, stack brown_block_1 somewhere else. Like on the table.

Alternative steps:

1. unstack brown_block_1 yellow_block_1 → hold brown_1
2. putdown brown_block_1 → brown on table, yellow is clear.
3. pickup yellow_block_1 → now holding yellow.
4. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1 → yellow on brown, which is on table. Now, yellow is not on the table. So in step 4, yellow is not on table, satisfying the condition for constraint 5.
5. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 → hold grey_2
6. stack grey_block_2 red_block_1 → grey_2 on red, arm empty.
7. unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1 → hold grey_1 (goal achieved)

Now, check constraints:

- Constraint 1: grey_block_2 is not on the table in every state. After step 6, grey_2 is on red, which is on table. So satisfies.

- Constraint 2: at least one state where yellow is not clear. Initial state has brown on yellow, so satisfied.

- Constraint 3: whenever yellow is not clear (initial state), then in s or after, black on brown or held. In this plan, after step 4, yellow is on brown_block_1 (which is on the table). So in step 4, yellow is not on table, but yellow is on brown. However, the initial state is a state where yellow is not clear. So we need to check if after initial state, there's a state where black is on brown or held. In this plan, after step 4, yellow is not on the table. But the third constraint is about whenever yellow is not clear. In the initial state, yellow is not clear (brown is on it). So we need to ensure that in the initial state or after, black is on brown or held. In this plan, black_block_1 is never moved, so it's on blue_block_1. The arm never holds black_block_1. So the third constraint is violated. Thus, this plan is invalid.

Hmm. This is really tricky. Maybe we need to involve moving black_block_1 onto brown_block_1. Let's try:

Alternative plan steps:

1. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 → hold grey_2
2. stack grey_block_2 red_block_1 → arm empty
3. unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1 → hold grey_1 (goal)
But this violates constraint 3 and 5.

Alternative idea: After step 2, unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1. But to do that, we need to unstack grey_block_1 first. But grey_block_1 is now clear (after step 2). So:

3. unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1 → hold grey_1 (goal)
4. unstack black_block_1 blue_block_1 → hold black_block_1
5. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1 → black on brown.

But after step 3, the plan has already achieved the goal. So steps 4 and 5 are not part of the plan. Therefore, this doesn't help.

Alternatively, before achieving the goal, insert actions to move black_block_1 onto brown_block_1.

But how? Let's try:

1. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 → hold grey_2
2. stack grey_block_2 red_block_1 → arm empty
3. unstack brown_block_1 yellow_block_1 → hold brown_1
4. stack brown_block_1 black_block_1 → but black_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top, so not clear. So can't stack. So invalid.

Alternatively, after step 2, unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1. But black_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top. So we need to unstack grey_block_1 first. Which is the goal. So this is a catch-22.

Perhaps the only way to satisfy constraint 3 is to have the arm hold black_block_1 during the plan. For example:

1. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 → hold grey_2
2. stack grey_block_2 red_block_1 → arm empty
3. unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1 → hold grey_1 (goal)
4. putdown grey_block_1 → grey on table
5. unstack black_block_1 blue_block_1 → hold black_block_1
6. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1 → black on brown
7. pickup grey_block_1 → back to holding grey_1.

But this plan's goal is achieved at step 3, so steps 4-7 are unnecessary. Therefore, the plan ends at step 3, and the constraints are still violated.

This is really challenging. Let's think about other constraints to see if they can be leveraged.

Other constraints:

6. At least one state where blue_block_1 is not clear. Initially, blue has black_block_1, so blue is not clear. So this is satisfied.

7. If blue is not clear in some state s, then grey_block_1 must be on blue at s or after. In the initial state, blue is not clear, and grey_block_1 is not on blue (grey_block_1 is on black_block_1). So this constraint is violated. Therefore, the plan must ensure that whenever blue is not clear, then grey_block_1 is on blue at that state or after. So in the initial state, blue is not clear, but grey_block_1 is not on blue. Therefore, the initial state violates constraint 7. Which is a problem because the initial state is part of the plan's execution.

Wait, the seventh constraint says: if blue_block_1 is not clear in state s, then in s or after, grey_block_1 is on blue_block_1. In the initial state, blue_block_1 has black_block_1 on top, so blue is not clear. So grey_block_1 must be on blue_block_1 in the initial state or after. But in the initial state, grey_block_1 is on black_block_1, not on blue. So this is a violation. Therefore, the problem as stated is impossible? But that can't be right. Therefore, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the constraint.

Wait, the seventh constraint says: If blue_block_1 is not clear in some state s, then grey_block_1 must be on blue_block_1 at s or after. So in the initial state, since blue is not clear, we need grey_block_1 to be on blue_block_1 either in the initial state or in a subsequent state. But in the initial state, grey_block_1 is on black_block_1. So the plan must include a state where grey_block_1 is on blue_block_1. So the plan must include an action that moves grey_block_1 onto blue_block_1. But our initial plan moves grey_block_1 into the arm, which is the goal, but then grey_block_1 is not on blue_block_1. Therefore, this plan violates constraint 7.

This is getting really complicated. It seems like the problem has conflicting constraints that might make it impossible. But the user expects a solution, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Let's try to outline a plan that satisfies all constraints:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1.
2. Stack grey_block_2 on red_block_1.
3. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1 (now holding grey_block_1; goal achieved).
   
This plan violates constraints 3, 5, and 7. To fix that:

For constraint 7: After moving grey_block_1, we need to place it on blue_block_1. But the goal is to hold it. So perhaps:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1.
2. Stack grey_block_2 on red_block_1.
3. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1.
4. Stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_1.
5. Unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1.

Now, step 5 would allow us to hold grey_block_1 again. But this adds steps. Let's check:

After step 4, grey_block_1 is on blue_block_1. So in the state after step 4, blue_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top, so blue is not clear. Constraint 7 requires that grey_block_1 is on blue_block_1 in that state, which is true. Then, step 5 unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1, which requires that grey_block_1 is clear (which it is). Now, the arm holds grey_block_1 (goal achieved).

This plan now satisfies constraint 7 because after step 4, grey_block_1 is on blue_block_1.

But what about constraint 3? Let's see: in the initial state, yellow is not clear (brown is on it). So the plan must include a state where black is on brown or held. In this plan, after step 4, we could have another step where we move black_block_1. For example:

After step 4, stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_1.

Then, steps:

5. unstack black_block_1 blue_block_1 → hold black_block_1.
6. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1 → black on brown.
7. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1 → hold grey_block_1.

But this adds even more steps. Let's check if this addresses constraint 3:

After step 6, black_block_1 is on brown_block_1. So during the plan, there's a state (after step 6) where black is on brown. So the third constraint is satisfied because after the initial state (which has yellow not clear), there's a state (step 6) where black is on brown.

Additionally, constraint 5: when black_block_1 becomes clear (after step 4, black_block_1 is on blue_block_1, and after step 5, black_block_1 is being held. So when does black_block_1 become clear? After step 5, black_block_1 is held, so not clear. After step 6, black_block_1 is stacked on brown_block_1, so black_block_1 is clear. Wait, no. Stacking black_block_1 on brown_block_1 makes black_block_1 on top of brown_block_1. So black_block_1 is clear, and brown_block_1 is not. The condition for constraint 5 is that if black_block_1 is clear in some state, then there must be an earlier state where yellow is not on table or blue is clear.

In this plan, after step 6, black_block_1 is clear (since nothing is on top of it). So we need to check if there's an earlier state where yellow is not on table or blue is clear. In step 4, grey_block_1 is on blue_block_1, so blue is not clear. In step 6, black is on brown, and yellow is on table (since brown was moved to blue and then black is on brown). Wait, no, yellow_block_1 is on table initially, but after step 1-2, grey_block_2 is on red. After step 3, grey_block_1 is on black_block_1, which is on blue_block_1. After step 4, grey_block_1 is on blue_block_1. So yellow_block_1 remains on the table throughout. So the condition for constraint 5 is not met. Because when black_block_1 is clear (after step 6), we need to have an earlier state where yellow is not on table or blue is clear. But in this plan, yellow is always on table, and blue is not clear in the initial state and until step 4 (when grey_block_1 is stacked on blue). After step 4, blue is not clear. After step 5, when unstack black_block_1, blue becomes clear. So in step 5, when unstacking black_block_1, blue_block_1 is clear. So if black_block_1 becomes clear (step 6), then there is an earlier state (step 5) where blue_block_1 is clear. Therefore, constraint 5 is satisfied.

This is getting quite involved. Let's outline the full plan:

1. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
2. stack grey_block_2 red_block_1
3. unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1
4. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
5. unstack black_block_1 blue_block_1
6. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1
7. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1

Now, step 7 achieves the goal of holding grey_block_1.

Check constraints:

- Constraint 1: grey_block_2 is not on table. It's on red_block_1 throughout. Satisfied.

- Constraint 2: at least one state with yellow_block_1 not clear. Initial state satisfies this.

- Constraint 3: initial state has yellow not clear. During the plan, step 6 places black on brown. So after the initial state, there's a state where black is on brown. Satisfied.

- Constraint 4: at least one state where black_block_1 is clear. In step 6, black_block_1 is on brown_block_1 and clear. Satisfied.

- Constraint 5: when black_block_1 is clear (step 6), there's an earlier state where blue is clear (step 5, after unstacking black_block_1, blue is clear). Satisfied.

- Constraint 6: at least one state where blue is not clear. Initial state and steps 4-5 have blue not clear. Satisfied.

- Constraint 7: when blue is not clear (steps 0-4), grey_block_1 is on blue in step 4. Satisfied.

- Constraint 8: at least one state where blue_block_1 is not on brown_block_1. Initial state satisfies this. Also, blue is never on brown. Satisfied.

- Constraint 9: if blue_block_1 is not on brown_block_1 (which is always true), then in some state after, black is not on blue or red_block_1 is not clear. In the plan, after step 5, black is not on blue (step 6, black is on brown). Also, after step 2, red_block_1 has grey_block_2, so red_block_1 is not clear. So either condition holds. Satisfied.

- Constraint 10: at least one state where yellow is on black or red is not on table. In the plan, red_block_1 is never moved, so it's always on table. But step 6 has black on brown. So this constraint requires at least one state where yellow is on black or red is not on table. Neither is true. So this constraint is violated. Therefore, the plan is invalid.

Hmm. So we need to satisfy constraint 10, which requires at least one state where yellow is on black or red is not on table. In the current plan, red is always on the table. So to satisfy this, we need to have yellow on black_block_1 at some point, or move red_block_1.

To achieve yellow on black_block_1, we need to stack yellow on black. But yellow is initially on the table with brown on top. So steps:

1. unstack brown_block_1 yellow_block_1 → hold brown_1
2. putdown brown_block_1 → on table
3. pickup yellow_block_1 → hold yellow
4. stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1 → now yellow is on black_block_1. Then proceed with other steps.

But this adds more steps. Let's integrate this into the plan.

Full plan outline:

1. unstack brown_block_1 yellow_block_1 → hold brown_1
2. putdown brown_block_1 → on table
3. pickup yellow_block_1 → hold yellow
4. stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1 → yellow on black
5. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 → hold grey_2
6. stack grey_block_2 red_block_1 → grey_2 on red
7. unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1 → hold grey_1
8. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_1 → grey_1 on blue
9. unstack black_block_1 blue_block_1 → hold black_block_1
10. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1 → black on brown
11. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1 → hold grey_1 (goal)

Now, check constraints:

- Constraint 10: at least one state where yellow is on black or red is not on table. In step 4, yellow is on black. Satisfied.

- Other constraints:

Constraint 3: after initial state, step 10 has black on brown. Satisfied.

Constraint 5: when black is clear (step 10), earlier state (step 9) has blue clear. Satisfied.

Constraint 7: when blue is not clear (steps 8-9), grey_block_1 is on blue. Satisfied.

This seems to satisfy all constraints. Now, the goal is achieved in step 11. Let's check each constraint:

1. grey_block_2 is not on table. Steps 5-6: grey_block_2 is on red. Satisfied.

2. at least one state with yellow not clear. Initial state. Satisfied.

3. for initial state (yellow not clear), there's a later state (step 10) with black on brown. Satisfied.

4. at least one state with black clear. Step 10: black is on brown, so clear. Satisfied.

5. for step 10 (black clear), earlier state step 9 has blue clear. Satisfied.

6. at least one state with blue not clear. Initial state. Satisfied.

7. when blue is not clear (steps 8-9), grey is on blue. Satisfied.

8. at least one state where blue not on brown. Always true. Satisfied.

9. if blue not on brown (always true), then in some state after, black not on blue or red not clear. Step 6: red has grey_block_2, so not clear. Satisfied.

10. at least one state where yellow on black or red not on table. Step 4: yellow on black. Satisfied.

11. at least one state with grey_block_1 not clear. Steps 0-5: grey_block_1 has grey_block_2 on top. Satisfied.

12. when grey_block_1 not clear (steps 0-5), in those states or after, either holding red or red not on table. In steps 0-5, red is on table. But step 6 stacks grey_2 on red, making red not clear. So after step 6, red has grey_2 on it. So in step 6 and later, red is not clear. So for states where grey_block_1 is not clear (steps 0-5), there's a later state (step 6) where red is not clear. So the condition holds. Satisfied.

This plan seems to satisfy all constraints. Now, let's count the steps to see if it's optimal. However, the user requested an optimal plan (shortest possible). This plan has 11 steps, but maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternative approach: After step 4 (yellow on black), we can proceed to unstack grey_block_2 and then grey_block_1. But perhaps there's a way to shorten the steps. Let's think.

After step 4 (yellow on black), grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1, which is on black_block_1. So to unstack grey_block_2, we need to unstack it from grey_block_1.

Then:

5. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 → hold grey_2

6. stack grey_block_2 red_block_1 → arm empty

7. unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1 → hold grey_1 (goal)

But in this case, step 7 achieves the goal. Now, check constraints:

- Constraint 3: after initial state, we need black on brown or held. But in this plan, there's no such state. So this plan is invalid. So steps 1-7 don't satisfy constraint 3.

Therefore, the earlier long plan is necessary to satisfy all constraints.

But perhaps there's a shorter way. Let's see:

If after step 4 (yellow on black), we can stack grey_block_2 on red, then unstack grey_block_1 and hold it. But that would require:

Steps:

1. unstack brown_block_1 yellow_block_1 → hold brown_1
2. stack brown_block_1 red_block_1 → brown on red
3. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 → hold grey_2
4. stack grey_block_2 red_block_1 → grey_2 on brown_1 on red. Wait, can't stack on red if it's not clear. After step 2, red has brown_block_1. So step 4 can't stack grey_2 on red. Therefore, invalid.

Alternatively, after step 2, putdown brown_block_1 on table.

Steps:

1. unstack brown_block_1 yellow_block_1 → hold brown_1
2. putdown brown_block_1 → on table
3. pickup yellow_block_1 → hold yellow
4. stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1 → yellow on black
5. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 → hold grey_2
6. stack grey_block_2 red_block_1 → grey_2 on red
7. unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1 → hold grey_1 (goal)

Now, check constraints:

- Constraint 3: initial state yellow not clear. Need black on brown or held. In this plan, black is never moved. So no. Violated.

Thus, the longer plan seems necessary. Therefore, the valid plan is as outlined earlier with 11 steps. But this seems excessively long. Let me check if there's a more optimal path.

Alternative idea: Instead of moving yellow_block_1, maybe move black_block_1 onto brown_block_1 directly.

Steps:

1. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 → hold grey_2
2. stack grey_block_2 red_block_1 → arm empty
3. unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1 → hold grey_1
4. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_1 → arm empty
5. unstack black_block_1 blue_block_1 → hold black_block_1
6. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1 → arm empty
7. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1 → hold grey_1 (goal)

Check constraints:

- Constraint 3: initial state yellow not clear. In this plan, step 6 puts black on brown. So satisfied.

- Constraint 5: when black is clear (step 6), earlier state step 5 has blue clear. Yes.

- Constraint 10: need yellow on black or red not on table. red has grey_2, so not on table (wait, red is on table. grey_2 is stacked on red, which is on table. So red is still on table. So red is on table. Therefore, constraint 10 is not satisfied. So we need to make red not on table or have yellow on black.

Thus, this plan violates constraint 10. Therefore, we need to add steps to move red_block_1.

Alternatively, after step 7, putdown grey_block_1 and move red_block_1. But that's after achieving the goal.

Alternatively, after step 2, unstack red_block_1 from table and stack it somewhere. But red_block_1 is clear initially. So:

3. pickup red_block_1 → hold red
4. stack red_block_1 somewhere, like on grey_block_2 (but grey_block_2 is on red in step 2). Wait, step 2 stack grey_2 on red. So red is under grey_2. Can't stack red on grey_2.

Alternatively, stack red on blue_block_1. But blue has black_block_1. So no.

This is getting too complicated. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the earlier plan that satisfies all constraints, even if it's longer. The steps are as follows:

```
1. unstack brown_block_1 yellow_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. pickup yellow_block_1
4. stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1
5. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
6. stack grey_block_2 red_block_1
7. unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1
8. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
9. unstack black_block_1 blue_block_1
10. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1
11. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
```

Each action is on a separate line. Let's format this properly.
