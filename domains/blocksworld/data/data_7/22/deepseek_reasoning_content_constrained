Okay, let's try to tackle this planning problem. So, the initial state and the goal are given, along with a bunch of constraints. I need to find an optimal plan that achieves the goal while satisfying all those constraints. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the goal is to have white_block_2 on top of purple_block_1. Let's look at the initial state. Currently, purple_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, and red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1, with orange_block_1 on red_block_1. So, the tower there is white_block_1 -> purple_block_1 -> red_block_1 -> orange_block_1. Then, white_block_2 is on the table with orange_block_2 on top. White_block_3 is clear on the table.

To get white_block_2 on purple_block_1, we need to move white_block_2. But right now, it's under orange_block_2. So first, I need to unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_2. Then, pick up white_block_2 and stack it onto purple_block_1. However, purple_block_1 is currently under red_block_1 and orange_block_1. So we need to clear purple_block_1 first. That means moving red_block_1 and orange_block_1 somewhere else.

But let's check the constraints. There are several constraints here. Let me list them out:

1. At least one state must have "white_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1". Since initially, white_block_1 is under purple_block_1, this is already true. But maybe during the plan, if we move blocks, this could change. Wait, the initial state: white_block_1 is on the table, with purple_block_1 on it. So white_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1. So this condition is already satisfied in the initial state. But the constraint says it must hold in at least one state, which it already does. But the second constraint related to this is that if this condition holds in some state s, then in s or a subsequent state, we must be holding purple_block_1. So in the initial state, since the first condition holds (white_block_1 not on orange_block_1), we need to ensure that at some point after that, we hold purple_block_1. So in the plan, we must pick up purple_block_1 at some point after the initial state. That's important.

Another constraint: purple_block_1 must not be on the table in at least one state. Initially, it's on white_block_1, so that's already satisfied. But the next part says if in any state s where purple_block_1 is not on the table, then in s or after, white_block_2 must be on top of red_block_1. Wait, the goal is white_block_2 on purple_block_1, but this constraint requires that whenever purple_block_1 is not on the table (which is always true except when we put it down), white_block_2 must be on red_block_1 at some point. So we need to make sure that in the plan, after moving purple_block_1 (like putting it down), we stack white_block_2 on red_block_1. But maybe that's part of the plan steps.

Wait, the constraint is: If purple_block_1 is not on the table in state s, then white_block_2 must be on red_block_1 in s or after. Since purple_block_1 starts on white_block_1 (not on table), so in the initial state, s0, the condition is true. So in s0 or after, white_block_2 must be on red_block_1. But the initial state doesn't have that. So we need to have at some point in the plan, white_block_2 is on red_block_1. But our goal is to have white_block_2 on purple_block_1. So perhaps we need to stack white_block_2 on red_block_1, then later move it again. But that's adding steps. Hmm. But the plan must be optimal, so we need to find the shortest path. Maybe there's a way to satisfy this constraint without adding steps.

Let me think. So in the initial state, purple_block_1 is not on the table (it's on white_block_1). So the constraint is triggered, and we must have white_block_2 on red_block_1 at some point. So we need to stack white_block_2 onto red_block_1 at some point in the plan. Then later move it to purple_block_1. But how? Because red_block_1 is under orange_block_1. So to stack on red_block_1, we need to clear it first. Which would require unstacking orange_block_1 from red_block_1.

But let's see. The initial tower is white_block_1 -> purple_block_1 -> red_block_1 -> orange_block_1. To get red_block_1 clear, we need to unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_1. Then put it down. Then maybe stack white_block_2 onto red_block_1. But that would take several steps. Then later, we need to move white_block_2 from red_block_1 to purple_block_1. But this seems like adding steps. But the constraints require this.

But wait, the constraint says that if in any state s where purple_block_1 is not on the table, then white_block_2 must be on red_block_1 in s or after. Since in the initial state, purple_block_1 is not on the table, the condition is already true. So the constraint requires that in the initial state or after, white_block_2 must be on red_block_1. But in the initial state, white_block_2 is on the table. So we need to make sure that in the plan, at some point, white_block_2 is on red_block_1. So even if that's not part of the goal, we have to do that.

But the goal is white_block_2 on purple_block_1. So perhaps the plan would involve moving white_block_2 to red_block_1, then moving it again. But that would add steps. However, since the plan must be optimal (shortest possible), maybe there's a way to satisfy the constraints without extra steps. Let's see.

Another constraint: At least one state must have "purple_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1" or "you are holding purple_block_1". So we need to either stack purple_block_1 on orange_block_1 (but orange_block_1 is initially on red_block_1) or hold purple_block_1 at some point. Since we need to move purple_block_1 to have white_block_2 on top of it, we probably have to unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1, which requires moving the blocks above it. So to unstack purple_block_1, we need to first unstack red_block_1 and orange_block_1. Wait, no. Because purple_block_1 is under red_block_1, so to unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1, we need to clear purple_block_1. But red_block_1 is on top of it, which has orange_block_1 on top. So we need to unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_1, then unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1, then unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1. Then, perhaps put purple_block_1 somewhere else, stack white_block_2 on it. But this seems lengthy. Let's outline the steps.

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_1. This requires that orange_block_1 is clear (which it is) and that we're not holding anything. Then we can unstack it and put it down. So:

unstack orange_block_1 red_block_1
putdown orange_block_1

2. Then unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1. But red_block_1 is now clear (since we removed orange_block_1). So:

unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
putdown red_block_1

3. Now, purple_block_1 is clear. So we can unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1:

unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1
putdown purple_block_1 (Wait, but we need to stack white_block_2 on purple_block_1. So maybe after picking up purple_block_1, we can stack it somewhere else, but perhaps we need to keep it on the table to stack white_block_2 on it. Wait, the goal is white_block_2 on top of purple_block_1. So purple_block_1 can be on the table or on another block. But the goal doesn't specify where purple_block_1 is, just that white_block_2 is on top of it. So if we put purple_block_1 on the table, then stack white_block_2 on it, that's acceptable.

But wait, in the initial state, purple_block_1 is on white_block_1. The goal doesn't specify where purple_block_1 is, just that white_block_2 is on top of it. So if we move purple_block_1 to the table, then stack white_block_2 on it, that would achieve the goal. But to do that, we need to first move purple_block_1 to the table. But moving purple_block_1 requires unstacking it from white_block_1, which requires moving the blocks above it (red_block_1 and orange_block_1).

So steps so far:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_1.

Action: unstack orange_block_1 red_block_1
Effect: holding orange_block_1, red_block_1 is clear.

Then putdown orange_block_1.

Action: putdown orange_block_1

2. Unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1.

Action: unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
Now holding red_block_1, purple_block_1 is clear.

Putdown red_block_1.

Action: putdown red_block_1

3. Now, unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1.

Action: unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1
Now holding purple_block_1, white_block_1 is clear.

Then, putdown purple_block_1.

Action: putdown purple_block_1

Now, purple_block_1 is on the table. Then, we need to stack white_block_2 on it. But white_block_2 is currently under orange_block_2. So we need to unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_2 first.

4. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_2.

Action: unstack orange_block_2 white_block_2
Now holding orange_block_2.

Putdown orange_block_2.

Action: putdown orange_block_2

5. Now, pick up white_block_2.

Action: pickup white_block_2

Then stack it on purple_block_1.

Action: stack white_block_2 purple_block_1

This would achieve the goal. Now, let's check the constraints.

First constraint: "white_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1" must hold in at least one state. Initially, it's true. So that's covered. But the associated constraint says that if this holds in some state s, then we must hold purple_block_1 in s or after. Since it's true in the initial state, we must hold purple_block_1 at some point. In the steps above, we do hold purple_block_1 when we unstack it from white_block_1. So that's satisfied.

Next constraint: "purple_block_1 is not on the table" in at least one state. Initially, it's on white_block_1, so that's satisfied. The associated constraint is that if in any state s where purple_block_1 is not on the table, then white_block_2 must be on red_block_1 at s or after. Wait, in the initial state, purple_block_1 is not on the table, so the requirement is that white_block_2 is on red_block_1 at some point. But in our current plan, we never stack white_block_2 on red_block_1. That's a problem. Because according to the constraints, we need to have white_block_2 on red_block_1 at some point. But in our plan, we put purple_block_1 on the table, then stack white_block_2 on it. So this violates the constraint. So we need to adjust the plan to include white_block_2 being on red_block_1.

So how can we satisfy that? Maybe after moving red_block_1 to the table, we can stack white_block_2 on it, then later move it to purple_block_1. Let's adjust the plan.

Let me revise the steps:

After step 2, where we putdown red_block_1 (now on table), perhaps stack white_block_2 onto red_block_1. But white_block_2 is under orange_block_2. So need to first unstack orange_block_2.

So revised steps:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_1, putdown.
2. Unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1, putdown.
3. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_2, putdown.
4. Pickup white_block_2, stack on red_block_1. (This satisfies the constraint that white_block_2 is on red_block_1.)
5. Then, unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1 (but this would require clearing red_block_1, which is on the table, so we can just pick it up? Wait, no. Stacking white_block_2 on red_block_1 would put it on top. So to unstack, we can just do unstack white_block_2 red_block_1, then proceed to stack on purple_block_1.

But then we need to move purple_block_1. Let's see:

After step 4, red_block_1 is on the table with white_block_2 on top. Then, to move white_block_2 to purple_block_1, we need to first unstack it from red_block_1, then stack it on purple_block_1. But where is purple_block_1? We need to have moved it to the table. So let's see:

After step 2, red_block_1 is on the table. Then step 3: unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_2, putdown. Then step 4: pickup white_block_2 and stack on red_block_1. Then step 5: unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1 (since red_block_1 is clear). Then step 6: stack white_block_2 onto purple_block_1. But purple_block_1 is still on white_block_1. Wait, no. Because earlier steps didn't move purple_block_1 yet. So in the original plan, after unstacking red_block_1, we unstack purple_block_1. But in this revised plan, we're not doing that yet. So perhaps after step 2, we need to unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1 and put it down. Let's adjust:

Let me outline the steps again:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_1. (Holding orange_block_1)
2. Putdown orange_block_1. (Now orange_block_1 is on table)
3. Unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1. (Holding red_block_1)
4. Putdown red_block_1. (Red_block_1 on table)
5. Unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1. (Holding purple_block_1)
6. Putdown purple_block_1. (Now purple_block_1 is on table)
7. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_2. (Holding orange_block_2)
8. Putdown orange_block_2.
9. Pickup white_block_2. (Now holding it)
10. Stack white_block_2 on red_block_1. (Now white_block_2 is on red_block_1, satisfying the constraint)
11. Unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. (Holding white_block_2)
12. Stack white_block_2 on purple_block_1. (Achieving the goal)

But this adds more steps. However, the constraints require that white_block_2 is on red_block_1 at some point. Also, other constraints need to be checked.

Let's check the other constraints:

- "At least one state must have 'purple_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1' or 'holding purple_block_1'". In the plan above, step 5 is unstacking purple_block_1, so we hold it. So that's covered.

- "At least one state must have 'white_block_1 is not clear'". Initially, white_block_1 has purple_block_1 on it. So that's already true. But when we unstack purple_block_1 (step 5), white_block_1 becomes clear. So in the initial state, it's not clear. So that constraint is satisfied.

But then, the constraint says if white_block_1 is not clear in some state s, then red_block_1 is not on the table in s or after. Initially, white_block_1 is not clear (has purple_block_1 on it), and red_block_1 is on purple_block_1 (so not on the table). So in the initial state, the condition holds. Then, after step 3, red_block_1 is put on the table. So in that case, if in some state s where white_block_1 is not clear (like initial state), then red_block_1 must not be on the table in s or after. But after step 3, red_block_1 is on the table. So this would violate the constraint. Because in the initial state, s0, white_block_1 is not clear (so the condition is true), and in s0, red_block_1 is not on the table. But after step 3, red_block_1 is on the table. So in state after step 3, red_block_1 is on the table. But the constraint requires that if white_block_1 is not clear in s, then red_block_1 is not on the table in s or after. So after step 3, red_block_1 is on the table. But white_block_1 was not clear in s0 (the initial state). So the constraint requires that in any state after s0, red_block_1 must not be on the table. But in step 3, we put red_block_1 on the table, which would violate this. Therefore, this plan is invalid.

Hmm, this complicates things. So the constraint is: if white_block_1 is not clear in s, then red_block_1 is not on the table in s or after. So whenever white_block_1 is not clear (which it is in the initial state), then from that state onward, red_block_1 must not be on the table. But in our plan, after moving red_block_1 to the table, we have red_block_1 on the table, which violates the constraint because the initial state s0 had white_block_1 not clear, and in a subsequent state, red_block_1 is on the table.

So that's a problem. Therefore, we can't put red_block_1 on the table at any point after the initial state. So how to handle this?

This means that red_block_1 must always be on top of some block, never on the table. Because if we ever put red_block_1 on the table, then since s0 (initial state) had white_block_1 not clear, the constraint requires that red_block_1 is not on the table in s0 or after. But putting red_block_1 on the table would violate this.

So the plan must not put red_block_1 on the table. Therefore, after unstacking red_block_1 from purple_block_1, we can't put it down. We need to stack it somewhere else. But where?

But red_block_1 is in the air. So after unstacking red_block_1 from purple_block_1 (step 3), we can't put it down. So we have to stack it on another block. But which blocks are available? Initially, white_block_3 is clear. Maybe stack red_block_1 on white_block_3. But then, we can do that.

Let me adjust the plan:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_1. Putdown.
2. Unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1. Now holding red_block_1.
3. Stack red_block_1 on white_block_3. Now red_block_1 is on white_block_3, which is clear. So white_block_3 is now not clear.
4. Now, unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1. Putdown purple_block_1.
5. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_2. Putdown.
6. Pickup white_block_2. Stack on red_block_1 (which is on white_block_3). Now white_block_2 is on red_block_1. This satisfies the constraint that white_block_2 must be on red_block_1 after purple_block_1 is not on the table (since purple_block_1 is now on the table after step 4, but wait, no: in step 4, we putdown purple_block_1, so in that state, purple_block_1 is on the table. So when we stack white_block_2 on red_block_1 (which is on white_block_3), that's after purple_block_1 was put on the table. So in the state where purple_block_1 is not on the table (which is when it's on white_block_1 initially), we need to have white_block_2 on red_block_1 at some point. But when purple_block_1 is not on the table (i.e., it's on white_block_1), which is the initial state, the constraint requires that white_block_2 is on red_block_1 in s or after. But in the initial state, white_block_2 is on the table. So we need to have white_block_2 on red_block_1 at some point after the initial state. In this adjusted plan, step 6 stacks white_block_2 on red_block_1 (which is on white_block_3), so that satisfies the constraint.

Then, after that, we need to move white_block_2 from red_block_1 to purple_block_1. So:

7. Unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. Now holding white_block_2.
8. Stack white_block_2 on purple_block_1 (which is on the table). This achieves the goal.

Now, check the constraints again.

Constraint regarding red_block_1 not on the table: in the initial state s0, white_block_1 is not clear. So red_block_1 must not be on the table in s0 or after. In s0, red_block_1 is on purple_block_1 (not on table). After step 3, red_block_1 is stacked on white_block_3 (not on table). So this constraint is satisfied.

Another constraint: "white_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1" must hold in at least one state. In our current plan, white_block_2 is stacked on red_block_1 (step 6), which is on white_block_3. Orange_block_1 is on the table. So this condition is not met. So we need to have a state where white_block_2 is on orange_block_1. But how?

Hmm, this is another constraint. So we need to have at least one state where white_block_2 is on orange_block_1. But our current plan doesn't do that. So we need to adjust the plan to include that.

This is getting complicated. Let's list all the constraints again:

Constraints:
1. "white_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1" must hold in at least one state. (Already true in initial state)
2. If the above holds in s, then hold purple_block_1 in s or after. (We hold it in step 4)
3. "purple_block_1 is not on the table" in at least one state. (Initial state)
4. If purple_block_1 is not on the table in s, then white_block_2 is on red_block_1 in s or after. (We have white_block_2 on red_block_1 in step 6)
5. "purple_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1" or holding purple_block_1 in at least one state. (Holding in step 4)
6. "white_block_1 is not clear" in at least one state. (Initial state)
7. If white_block_1 is not clear in s, then red_block_1 is not on the table in s or after. (Satisfied as red_block_1 is never on table)
8. "white_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1" in at least one state.
9. "orange_block_2 is on top of white_block_1" in at least one state.
10. "white_block_2 is on top of white_block_3" in at least one state.

So constraints 8,9,10 require certain states.

Constraint 8: white_block_2 must be on orange_block_1 at some point.

Constraint 9: orange_block_2 must be on white_block_1 at some point.

Constraint 10: white_block_2 must be on white_block_3 at some point.

These are three additional conditions that must be met in the plan.

So our current plan doesn't address these. So we need to modify the plan to include these steps.

This complicates things because the optimal plan needs to include all these conditions without unnecessary steps.

Let's tackle them one by one.

First, constraint 8: white_block_2 must be on orange_block_1. To do this, we need to stack white_block_2 on orange_block_1 at some point. But orange_block_1 is initially on red_block_1. After step 1, orange_block_1 is putdown on the table. So in the plan, after step 1, orange_block_1 is on the table. So to stack white_block_2 on orange_block_1, we need to pick up white_block_2 and stack it on orange_block_1. But we have to do this while also getting white_block_2 on red_block_1 and on purple_block_1. So how can we arrange this?

Similarly, constraint 9 requires orange_block_2 to be on white_block_1. Currently, orange_block_2 is on white_block_2 initially. To put it on white_block_1, we need to move it there. But white_block_1 is initially under purple_block_1, which we unstack and putdown. So after step 4, white_block_1 is clear. So perhaps after that, stack orange_block_2 on white_block_1.

Constraint 10: white_block_2 must be on white_block_3. Currently, in the plan, white_block_2 is stacked on red_block_1 (on white_block_3) in step 6, but that's red_block_1 on white_block_3, and white_block_2 on red_block_1. So white_block_2 is not directly on white_block_3. So to satisfy constraint 10, we need to have white_block_2 directly on white_block_3 at some point.

So, let's try to adjust the plan to include all these constraints.

This is getting quite complex. Let's think of a way to satisfy all constraints with minimal steps.

Perhaps the optimal plan will involve multiple moves that satisfy multiple constraints in one step. For example, moving orange_block_2 to white_block_1, then moving white_block_2 to orange_block_1, then to red_block_1, then to purple_block_1, and also moving white_block_2 to white_block_3.

But this seems like a lot. Let's try to outline:

After initial steps:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_1. Putdown. (step 1)
2. Unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1. Stack red_block_1 on white_block_3. (step 3)
3. Unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1. Putdown. (step4)
4. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_2. Putdown. (step5)
5. Pickup white_block_2. Stack on orange_block_1 (to satisfy constraint8). But orange_block_1 is on the table. So stack white_block_2 on orange_block_1. Now, white_block_2 is on orange_block_1.
6. Then, unstack white_block_2 from orange_block_1. Putdown? Or stack it elsewhere.
7. Stack white_block_2 on red_block_1 (to satisfy constraint4). But red_block_1 is on white_block_3.
8. Then unstack white_block_2 and stack on purple_block_1.

But then, we also need to have orange_block_2 on white_block_1 (constraint9) and white_block_2 on white_block_3 (constraint10).

Let's see:

After step4, white_block_1 is clear. So maybe after step4, pickup orange_block_2 (which was putdown in step5), and stack it on white_block_1. This would satisfy constraint9.

Then, after that, we need to have white_block_2 on white_block_3. So after step6, white_block_2 is on red_block_1 (on white_block_3), so white_block_2 is indirectly on white_block_3. But constraint10 requires it to be directly on. So we need to have white_block_2 stacked directly on white_block_3 at some point.

Alternatively, maybe after stacking white_block_2 on red_block_1 (which is on white_block_3), then unstack red_block_1 from white_block_3 and put it down, then stack white_block_2 on white_block_3. But that adds steps.

This is getting very lengthy. Let me try to outline a possible plan that covers all constraints:

1. unstack orange_block_1 red_block_1
   putdown orange_block_1
2. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
   stack red_block_1 white_block_3
3. unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1
   putdown purple_block_1
4. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_2
   putdown orange_block_2
5. pickup orange_block_2
   stack orange_block_2 white_block_1 (satisfies constraint9)
6. pickup white_block_2
   stack white_block_2 orange_block_1 (satisfies constraint8)
7. unstack white_block_2 orange_block_1
   stack white_block_2 white_block_3 (satisfies constraint10)
8. unstack white_block_2 white_block_3
   stack white_block_2 red_block_1 (on white_block_3)
9. unstack white_block_2 red_block_1
   stack white_block_2 purple_block_1 (achieves goal)

But this is 9 actions, which may not be optimal. Also, need to check if all constraints are met.

But this seems too long. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps some steps can satisfy multiple constraints. For example, stacking orange_block_2 on white_block_1 (step5) satisfies constraint9. Stacking white_block_2 on orange_block_1 (step6) satisfies constraint8. Stacking white_block_2 on white_block_3 (step7) satisfies constraint10. Then moving white_block_2 to red_block_1 and then to purple_block_1.

But the problem is, the optimal plan should be as short as possible. Maybe there's a way to have fewer steps by combining some actions.

Another approach: After moving orange_block_2 to white_block_1, then perhaps stack white_block_2 on white_block_3 directly (satisfying constraint10), then move it to orange_block_1 (constraint8), then to red_block_1 (constraint4), then to purple_block_1 (goal). But this requires multiple moves.

Alternatively, after moving white_block_2 to red_block_1 (on white_block_3), which is required by constraint4, then moving it to purple_block_1. But we also need to have white_block_2 on white_block_3 (constraint10). So perhaps after stacking on white_block_3, then moving it to red_block_1.

Wait, but stacking white_block_2 on white_block_3 directly would satisfy constraint10. Then moving it to red_block_1 would require unstacking from white_block_3 and stacking on red_block_1 (which is on the table?), but red_block_1 was stacked on white_block_3 earlier. So maybe:

After step2, red_block_1 is on white_block_3.

Then, stack white_block_2 on white_block_3 (satisfies constraint10), but then we need to move it to red_block_1.

But red_block_1 is on white_block_3. So to stack white_block_2 on red_block_1, white_block_2 would need to be on top of red_block_1, which is on white_block_3. So steps:

1. unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_1, putdown.
2. unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1, stack on white_block_3.
3. unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1, putdown.
4. unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_2, putdown.
5. pickup white_block_2, stack on white_block_3. (satisfies constraint10)
6. unstack white_block_2 from white_block_3. Now holding white_block_2.
7. stack white_block_2 on red_block_1 (on white_block_3). (satisfies constraint4)
8. unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1, stack on orange_block_1 (satisfies constraint8)
9. unstack white_block_2 from orange_block_1, stack on purple_block_1. (goal)

But also need to stack orange_block_2 on white_block_1 (constraint9).

So after step4, we have orange_block_2 on the table. Then:

After step4, we can:

5. pickup orange_block_2, stack on white_block_1. (satisfies constraint9)
6. pickup white_block_2, stack on white_block_3. (step5 now becomes step6)

This adds more steps. So the plan would be:

1. unstack orange_block_1 red_block_1
   putdown orange_block_1
2. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
   stack red_block_1 white_block_3
3. unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1
   putdown purple_block_1
4. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_2
   putdown orange_block_2
5. pickup orange_block_2
   stack orange_block_2 white_block_1
6. pickup white_block_2
   stack white_block_2 white_block_3
7. unstack white_block_2 white_block_3
8. stack white_block_2 red_block_1
9. unstack white_block_2 red_block_1
10. stack white_block_2 orange_block_1
11. unstack white_block_2 orange_block_1
12. stack white_block_2 purple_block_1

This is 12 steps, which seems too long. The optimal plan needs to be as short as possible. There must be a way to combine some of these steps.

Alternatively, perhaps we can stack orange_block_2 on white_block_1 after moving purple_block_1, and before moving white_block_2. For example:

After step3 (putdown purple_block_1), step4 is unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_2, putdown. Then step5: pickup orange_block_2 and stack on white_block_1. Now, constraint9 is satisfied.

Then step6: pickup white_block_2 and stack on red_block_1 (on white_block_3). Then step7: unstack white_block_2 and stack on orange_block_1 (step7). Then unstack and stack on purple_block_1. Also, after stacking on white_block_3, that's constraint10. Wait, no. If white_block_2 is stacked on red_block_1 (which is on white_block_3), then white_block_2 is not directly on white_block_3. So that doesn't satisfy constraint10. So we need to have a step where white_block_2 is directly on white_block_3.

So perhaps after step6 (stacking white_block_2 on red_block_1), we need to move red_block_1 from white_block_3 to somewhere else, then stack white_block_2 directly on white_block_3. But that adds steps.

This is getting very complex. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the optimal plan requires moving blocks in a specific order to satisfy multiple constraints with fewer steps.

Let's consider the goal: white_block_2 on purple_block_1. To achieve this, we need to have purple_block_1 clear. Initially, purple_block_1 is under red_block_1 and orange_block_1. So we need to move those blocks.

Let's try to find a plan that moves orange_block_1 and red_block_1 to other blocks, allowing us to move purple_block_1.

Also, considering the constraints:

- white_block_2 must be on orange_block_1, white_block_3, and red_block_1 at some points.

But how to minimize steps.

Another idea: Use the same block for multiple constraints. For example, stack white_block_2 on orange_block_1, which is on white_block_3. This way, white_block_2 is on orange_block_1 and white_block_3 (if orange_block_1 is on white_block_3). But this may not work.

Alternatively, stack white_block_2 on red_block_1, which is on orange_block_1, which is on white_block_3. But this may not satisfy the direct stacking required.

Alternatively, during the process of building the towers, some steps can satisfy multiple constraints.

Wait, constraint10 is "white_block_2 is on top of white_block_3". This requires a direct stacking. Similarly, constraint8 is "white_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1". Both need to be true at some points.

But perhaps we can stack white_block_2 on white_block_3, then move it to orange_block_1, then to red_block_1, then to purple_block_1. This would satisfy constraints 10,8,4.

Similarly, for constraint9: orange_block_2 on white_block_1. So we need to move orange_block_2 to white_block_1.

So here's a possible plan:

1. unstack orange_block_1 red_block_1
   putdown orange_block_1
2. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
   stack red_block_1 orange_block_1 (now red_block_1 is on orange_block_1, which is on table)
3. unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1
   putdown purple_block_1
4. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_2
   stack orange_block_2 white_block_1 (satisfies constraint9)
5. pickup white_block_2
   stack white_block_2 white_block_3 (satisfies constraint10)
6. unstack white_block_2 white_block_3
   stack white_block_2 orange_block_1 (satisfies constraint8)
7. unstack white_block_2 orange_block_1
   stack white_block_2 red_block_1 (satisfies constraint4)
8. unstack white_block_2 red_block_1
   stack white_block_2 purple_block_1 (achieves goal)

But let's check if this works.

Step2: stack red_block_1 on orange_block_1. This puts red_block_1 on orange_block_1. Then step7: stack white_block_2 on red_block_1. So white_block_2 is on red_block_1, which is on orange_block_1. So in step7, the constraint4 (white_block_2 on red_block_1) is satisfied. And since purple_block_1 is not on the table (it's on the table after step3), but wait, after step3, purple_block_1 is put on the table. So in step3, purple_block_1 is on the table, so the state after step3 has purple_block_1 on the table. But the constraint4 says that if purple_block_1 is not on the table in state s, then white_block_2 must be on red_block_1 in s or after. Purple_block_1 is not on the table in the initial state and steps1-2. In step3, it's put on the table, so after that, purple_block_1 is on the table. So the only state where purple_block_1 is not on the table is the initial state and steps1-2. So in those states, white_block_2 needs to be on red_block_1 at some point after. But in step7, white_block_2 is stacked on red_block_1. So if step7 occurs after the initial state, it satisfies the constraint.

Additionally, constraint8 is satisfied in step6, constraint9 in step4, constraint10 in step5.

Now, check other constraints:

- Constraint5: purple_block_1 on orange_block_1 or holding purple_block_1. We hold purple_block_1 in step3, so that's covered.

- Constraint7: if white_block_1 is not clear in s, then red_block_1 is not on table in s or after. Initially, white_block_1 is not clear (has purple_block_1). After step3, white_block_1 is clear. So the only state where white_block_1 is not clear is the initial state and steps1-2. In step2, red_block_1 is stacked on orange_block_1 (not on table), so red_block_1 is never on the table. So constraint7 is satisfied.

This plan has 8 actions, which is better than previous attempts. Let's count the steps:

1. unstack orange_block_1 red_block_1
2. putdown orange_block_1
3. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
4. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_2
8. stack orange_block_2 white_block_1
9. pickup white_block_2
10. stack white_block_2 white_block_3
11. unstack white_block_2 white_block_3
12. stack white_block_2 orange_block_1
13. unstack white_block_2 orange_block_1
14. stack white_block_2 red_block_1
15. unstack white_block_2 red_block_1
16. stack white_block_2 purple_block_1

Wait, each action is a separate line, so the steps above have 16 actions, which is not optimal. Wait, no: steps like unstack and stack are separate actions. For example, step1 is unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_1, which is one action. Then step2 is putdown orange_block_1. So each of those is a separate action.

So the initial steps:

1. unstack orange_block_1 red_block_1
2. putdown orange_block_1
3. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
4. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_2
8. stack orange_block_2 white_block_1
9. pickup white_block_2
10. stack white_block_2 white_block_3
11. unstack white_block_2 white_block_3
12. stack white_block_2 orange_block_1
13. unstack white_block_2 orange_block_1
14. stack white_block_2 red_block_1
15. unstack white_block_2 red_block_1
16. stack white_block_2 purple_block_1

This is 16 actions. That's too long. There must be a shorter way.

Alternative plan:

Let's think about the necessary steps to achieve the goal and satisfy all constraints.

1. To get white_block_2 on purple_block_1, we need to clear purple_block_1 and white_block_2.

Clearing purple_block_1 requires moving red_block_1 and orange_block_1.

Clearing white_block_2 requires moving orange_block_2.

So:

- unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_1, putdown.
- unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1, stack somewhere.
- unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_2, putdown.
- pickup white_block_2 and stack on purple_block_1.

But along the way, need to satisfy all constraints.

Now, the constraints:

- white_block_2 must be on red_block_1, orange_block_1, and white_block_3.

But perhaps we can stack white_block_2 on red_block_1, then move it to orange_block_1, then to white_block_3, then to purple_block_1. But this adds steps.

Alternatively, stack white_block_2 on orange_block_1 (satisfies constraint8), then unstack and stack on red_block_1 (satisfies constraint4), then unstack and stack on white_block_3 (satisfies constraint10), then finally stack on purple_block_1. But this is 4 steps just for white_block_2.

But this would require:

After moving orange_block_1 and red_block_1:

1. unstack orange_block_1 red_block_1, putdown.
2. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1, stack red_block_1 orange_block_1.
3. unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1, putdown.
4. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_2, stack orange_block_2 white_block_1 (satisfy constraint9).
5. pickup white_block_2, stack orange_block_1 (satisfy constraint8).
6. unstack white_block_2 orange_block_1, stack red_block_1 (satisfy constraint4).
7. unstack white_block_2 red_block_1, stack white_block_3 (satisfy constraint10).
8. unstack white_block_2 white_block_3, stack purple_block_1 (achieve goal).

But this would be 8 actions for white_block_2. But each stack and unstack is an action.

This is getting too long. I'm clearly missing a more optimal path.

Perhaps the key is to find a way to satisfy multiple constraints with a single action. For example, stacking white_block_2 on red_block_1 which is on white_block_3 would satisfy constraint4 and indirectly constraint10 if white_block_2 is on white_block_3 through red_block_1. But constraint10 requires white_block_2 to be directly on white_block_3, so that's not sufficient.

Another idea: Since white_block_3 is initially clear, maybe stacking red_block_1 on white_block_3, then stacking white_block_2 on red_block_1, which is on white_block_3. This would satisfy constraint4 (white_block_2 on red_block_1) and also have white_block_2 indirectly on white_block_3, but not directly. So this doesn't satisfy constraint10.

Alternatively, stack white_block_2 directly on white_block_3, then move it to red_block_1, then to purple_block_1. This would satisfy constraint10.

So:

After moving red_block_1 and orange_block_1:

1. unstack orange_block_1 red_block_1, putdown.
2. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1, stack red_block_1 white_block_3.
3. unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1, putdown.
4. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_2, putdown.
5. stack orange_block_2 white_block_1 (constraint9).
6. pickup white_block_2, stack white_block_3 (constraint10).
7. unstack white_block_2 white_block_3, stack red_block_1 (constraint4).
8. unstack white_block_2 red_block_1, stack orange_block_1 (constraint8).
9. unstack white_block_2 orange_block_1, stack purple_block_1 (goal).

This is 9 actions, but each step is separate. For example:

1. unstack orange_block_1 red_block_1
2. putdown orange_block_1
3. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
4. stack red_block_1 white_block_3
5. unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_2
8. putdown orange_block_2
9. pickup orange_block_2
10. stack orange_block_2 white_block_1
11. pickup white_block_2
12. stack white_block_2 white_block_3
13. unstack white_block_2 white_block_3
14. stack white_block_2 red_block_1
15. unstack white_block_2 red_block_1
16. stack white_block_2 orange_block_1
17. unstack white_block_2 orange_block_1
18. stack white_block_2 purple_block_1

This is 18 actions, which is not optimal.

This is really challenging. Let's try to find a way to minimize the steps while satisfying all constraints.

Alternative approach:

The constraints require certain states to exist, but they don't require those states to persist. So we can pass through those states quickly.

For example, constraint8: white_block_2 on orange_block_1. We can stack it there and then immediately unstack it. This satisfies the constraint as long as that state exists.

Similarly for the other constraints.

So perhaps:

1. unstack orange_block_1 red_block_1
2. putdown orange_block_1
3. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
4. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_2
8. stack orange_block_2 white_block_1 (constraint9)
9. pickup white_block_2
10. stack white_block_2 white_block_3 (constraint10)
11. unstack white_block_2 white_block_3
12. stack white_block_2 orange_block_1 (constraint8)
13. unstack white_block_2 orange_block_1
14. stack white_block_2 red_block_1 (constraint4)
15. unstack white_block_2 red_block_1
16. stack white_block_2 purple_block_1 (goal)

This plan has 16 actions. Each action is required to satisfy the constraints. But perhaps there's a shorter path.

Wait, after step14 (stack white_block_2 red_block_1), which satisfies constraint4, and then step15 unstack and step16 stack to achieve the goal. But maybe after step14, we can directly move white_block_2 to purple_block_1. But in that case, the constraint4 is satisfied (white_block_2 on red_block_1 in step14), so that's okay.

But the problem is, this plan is long. However, given the multiple constraints, it might be the shortest possible.

But I'm not sure. Let's count the steps again:

1. unstack orange_block_1 red_block_1
2. putdown orange_block_1
3. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
4. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_2
8. stack orange_block_2 white_block_1
9. pickup white_block_2
10. stack white_block_2 white_block_3
11. unstack white_block_2 white_block_3
12. stack white_block_2 orange_block_1
13. unstack white_block_2 orange_block_1
14. stack white_block_2 red_block_1
15. unstack white_block_2 red_block_1
16. stack white_block_2 purple_block_1

That's 16 actions. Is there any way to shorten this?

Alternatively, after step4 (red_block_1 on orange_block_1), perhaps stack white_block_2 on red_block_1. But white_block_2 is still under orange_block_2. So first need to unstack orange_block_2.

Let's try:

1. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_2
2. putdown orange_block_2
3. pickup white_block_2
4. stack white_block_2 red_block_1 (which is on purple_block_1)
But red_block_1 is not clear yet. So we need to first clear red_block_1.

No, this won't work.

Another idea: After moving orange_block_1 and red_block_1, stack red_block_1 on white_block_3. Then stack white_block_2 on white_block_3 to satisfy constraint10, then move it to red_block_1, then to orange_block_1, then to purple_block_1.

But each of these steps requires unstacking and stacking, adding actions.

At this point, I think the minimal plan would have around 14-16 steps due to the numerous constraints. However, since the problem requires an optimal plan, there must be a way to achieve this with fewer steps.

Let me try to find a different order of actions that reduces steps.

After unstacking orange_block_1 and red_block_1:

1. unstack orange_block_1 red_block_1
2. putdown orange_block_1
3. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
4. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1
6. stack purple_block_1 white_block_2 (no, because white_block_2 has orange_block_2)
7. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_2
8. putdown orange_block_2
9. pickup white_block_2
10. stack white_block_2 purple_block_1 (goal)
But this misses several constraints.

But how to satisfy the constraints?

Alternatively:

After step6, purple_block_1 is on the table. Then:

7. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_2
8. stack orange_block_2 white_block_1 (constraint9)
9. pickup white_block_2
10. stack white_block_2 white_block_3 (constraint10)
11. unstack white_block_2 white_block_3
12. stack white_block_2 orange_block_1 (constraint8)
13. unstack white_block_2 orange_block_1
14. stack white_block_2 red_block_1 (constraint4)
15. unstack white_block_2 red_block_1
16. stack white_block_2 purple_block_1 (goal)

But this is 16 actions. It's possible that this is the minimal number given the constraints.

Alternatively, can we combine some actions? For example, after unstacking orange_block_2 from white_block_2, stack it on white_block_1 in the same step. But we need to put it down first.

No, because unstacking orange_block_2 requires putting it down first before stacking. So unstack orange_block_2, putdown, then pickup and stack on white_block_1. So that's three actions.

This seems unavoidable.

Given all the constraints, I think the optimal plan would have to be around 16 steps. However, I might have missed a more optimal sequence. For example, after stacking white_block_2 on red_block_1 (step14), maybe we can directly move it to purple_block_1 without moving it to orange_block_1 and white_block_3. But then, the constraints for white_block_2 being on orange_block_1 and white_block_3 wouldn't be met.

Alternatively, perhaps some constraints can be satisfied in the initial state. For example, constraint9 requires orange_block_2 on white_block_1. Initially, orange_block_2 is on white_block_2, so that's not the case. So we have to stack it there.

Another idea: After moving orange_block_2 to white_block_1, can we stack white_block_2 on white_block_3 and then directly to purple_block_1, but that would miss some constraints.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity of the problem, I think the plan with 16 steps is necessary to satisfy all constraints. Therefore, the final answer would be a sequence of actions that addresses all the required constraints and the goal.
