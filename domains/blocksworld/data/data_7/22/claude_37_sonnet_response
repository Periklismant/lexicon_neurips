Let's break down the planning problem:

**Initial State:**
- white_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_2 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1
- white_block_3 is on the table
- orange_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- orange_block_2 is on top of white_block_2
- white_block_3 is clear
- orange_block_1 is clear
- orange_block_2 is clear
- you are not holding any block

This can be visualized as:
```
orange_block_1
red_block_1
purple_block_1          orange_block_2
white_block_1           white_block_2          white_block_3
```

**Goal:**
- white_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1

**Constraints:**
1. At some point, white_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1
2. After white_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1, you must be holding purple_block_1 at that point or later
3. At some point, purple_block_1 is not on the table
4. After purple_block_1 is not on the table, white_block_2 must be on top of red_block_1 at that point or later
5. At some point, either purple_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 or you are holding purple_block_1
6. At some point, white_block_1 is not clear
7. After white_block_1 is not clear, red_block_1 is not on the table at that point or later
8. At some point, white_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1
9. At some point, orange_block_2 is on top of white_block_1
10. At some point, white_block_2 is on top of white_block_3

Now, let's think about how to solve this problem:

The goal is to have white_block_2 on top of purple_block_1. Currently, purple_block_1 is under red_block_1 and orange_block_1, and white_block_2 has orange_block_2 on top of it. So, we need to:
1. Clear white_block_2 (remove orange_block_2)
2. Clear purple_block_1 (remove orange_block_1 and red_block_1)
3. Stack white_block_2 on purple_block_1

But we also have to satisfy the constraints. Let's see how to incorporate them:

Constraint 1 is easy because in the initial state, white_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1.

For constraint 2, after white_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1 (which is true in the initial state), we must at some point be holding purple_block_1.

Constraint 3 requires that at some point, purple_block_1 is not on the table. In the initial state, purple_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, not on the table, so this constraint is met.

Constraint 4 requires that after purple_block_1 is not on the table (which is true in the initial state), white_block_2 must be on top of red_block_1 at some point.

Constraint 5 requires that at some point, either purple_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 or we're holding purple_block_1. We can make sure to hold purple_block_1 at some point.

Constraint 6 requires that at some point, white_block_1 is not clear. In the initial state, white_block_1 has purple_block_1 on top of it, so it's not clear. This constraint is met.

Constraint 7 requires that after white_block_1 is not clear (which is true in the initial state), red_block_1 is not on the table at some point. In the initial state, red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1, not on the table, so this constraint is met.

Constraint 8 requires that at some point, white_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1.

Constraint 9 requires that at some point, orange_block_2 is on top of white_block_1.

Constraint 10 requires that at some point, white_block_2 is on top of white_block_3.

Now, let's draft a plan. We start from the initial state and try to fulfill all constraints while reaching the goal.

Initial state:
```
orange_block_1
red_block_1
purple_block_1          orange_block_2
white_block_1           white_block_2          white_block_3
```

Constraints 1, 3, 6, 7 are already met in the initial state. We need to address the others:

1. We need to hold purple_block_1 at some point (to meet constraint 2).
2. We need to place white_block_2 on top of red_block_1 at some point (to meet constraint 4), although constraint 3 is already satisfied.
3. We need to place purple_block_1 on top of orange_block_1 OR hold purple_block_1 at some point (to meet constraint 5). We can just hold purple_block_1 to satisfy this.
4. We need to place white_block_2 on top of orange_block_1 at some point (to meet constraint 8).
5. We need to place orange_block_2 on top of white_block_1 at some point (to meet constraint 9).
6. We need to place white_block_2 on top of white_block_3 at some point (to meet constraint 10).
7. Finally, we need to place white_block_2 on top of purple_block_1 (our goal).

Let's try to design a sequence of actions to meet all these requirements:

Initial state:
```
orange_block_1
red_block_1
purple_block_1          orange_block_2
white_block_1           white_block_2          white_block_3
```

1. First, let's deal with orange_block_2. We need to remove it from white_block_2 to later use white_block_2 to satisfy other constraints.
   ```
   unstack orange_block_2 white_block_2
   ```

2. We can place orange_block_2 on white_block_1 to satisfy constraint 9.
   ```
   putdown orange_block_2
   ```
   
   Wait, that's not right. Let's revise. We need to place orange_block_2 on white_block_1, but white_block_1 already has blocks on top of it.

Let's step back and think more carefully. The initial state again:
```
orange_block_1
red_block_1
purple_block_1          orange_block_2
white_block_1           white_block_2          white_block_3
```

1. First, unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_1.
   ```
   unstack orange_block_1 red_block_1
   ```

2. Place orange_block_1 on the table for now.
   ```
   putdown orange_block_1
   ```

3. Unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1.
   ```
   unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
   ```

4. Place red_block_1 on the table for now.
   ```
   putdown red_block_1
   ```

5. Unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1. This ensures we hold purple_block_1 at some point, satisfying constraint 2 and constraint 5.
   ```
   unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1
   ```

6. Place purple_block_1 on orange_block_1 for now. This satisfies constraint 5 in another way as well.
   ```
   stack purple_block_1 orange_block_1
   ```

7. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_2.
   ```
   unstack orange_block_2 white_block_2
   ```

8. Place orange_block_2 on white_block_1. This satisfies constraint 9.
   ```
   stack orange_block_2 white_block_1
   ```

9. Now, white_block_2 is clear. Let's place it on top of white_block_3. This satisfies constraint 10.
   ```
   pickup white_block_2
   stack white_block_2 white_block_3
   ```

10. Now, let's unstack white_block_2 from white_block_3.
    ```
    unstack white_block_2 white_block_3
    ```

11. Place white_block_2 on top of red_block_1. This satisfies constraint 4.
    ```
    stack white_block_2 red_block_1
    ```

12. Unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1.
    ```
    unstack white_block_2 red_block_1
    ```

13. Place white_block_2 on top of orange_block_1. This satisfies constraint 8.
    ```
    stack white_block_2 orange_block_1
    ```

14. Unstack white_block_2 from orange_block_1.
    ```
    unstack white_block_2 orange_block_1
    ```

15. Unstack purple_block_1 from orange_block_1.
    ```
    putdown white_block_2
    unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1
    ```

16. Now, we can place white_block_2 on top of purple_block_1, which is our goal.
    ```
    putdown purple_block_1
    pickup white_block_2
    stack white_block_2 purple_block_1
    ```

Ok, I realize I made a mistake earlier. Let's revise the plan to be more careful. Let me reconsider the initial state and ensure I'm following the preconditions of the actions.

Initial state:
```
orange_block_1
red_block_1
purple_block_1          orange_block_2
white_block_1           white_block_2          white_block_3
```

1. First, unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_1.
   ```
   unstack orange_block_1 red_block_1
   ```

2. Place orange_block_1 on the table for now.
   ```
   putdown orange_block_1
   ```

3. Unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1.
   ```
   unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
   ```

4. Place red_block_1 on the table for now.
   ```
   putdown red_block_1
   ```

5. Unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1. This ensures we hold purple_block_1 at some point, satisfying constraint 2 and constraint 5.
   ```
   unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1
   ```

6. Place purple_block_1 on orange_block_1 for now. This also satisfies constraint 5.
   ```
   stack purple_block_1 orange_block_1
   ```

7. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_2.
   ```
   unstack orange_block_2 white_block_2
   ```

8. Place orange_block_2 on white_block_1. This satisfies constraint 9.
   ```
   stack orange_block_2 white_block_1
   ```

9. Now, white_block_2 is clear. Let's place it on top of white_block_3. This satisfies constraint 10.
   ```
   pickup white_block_2
   stack white_block_2 white_block_3
   ```

10. Unstack white_block_2 from white_block_3.
    ```
    unstack white_block_2 white_block_3
    ```

11. Place white_block_2 on top of red_block_1. This satisfies constraint 4, since constraint 3 is already satisfied in the initial state.
    ```
    stack white_block_2 red_block_1
    ```

12. Unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1.
    ```
    unstack white_block_2 red_block_1
    ```

13. Place white_block_2 on top of orange_block_1. This satisfies constraint 8.
    ```
    stack white_block_2 orange_block_1
    ```

14. Unstack white_block_2 from orange_block_1.
    ```
    unstack white_block_2 orange_block_1
    ```

15. Unstack purple_block_1 from orange_block_1.
    ```
    putdown white_block_2
    unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1
    ```

16. Now, we can place white_block_2 on top of purple_block_1, which is our goal.
    ```
    putdown purple_block_1
    pickup white_block_2
    stack white_block_2 purple_block_1
    ```

Wait, there's a problem. I don't understand why in the original plan I wrote:
```
    putdown white_block_2
    unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1
```

after I already unstacked white_block_2 from orange_block_1. Let me double check the preconditions of `unstack` again. According to the problem statement, I need to ensure that I am not currently holding any block in order to unstack purple_block_1 from orange_block_1. So, if I've just unstacked white_block_2 from orange_block_1, I am holding white_block_2, and I can't directly unstack purple_block_1 from orange_block_1. I would need to putdown white_block_2 first.

Let's revise the plan more carefully:

Initial state:
```
orange_block_1
red_block_1
purple_block_1          orange_block_2
white_block_1           white_block_2          white_block_3
```

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_1.
   ```
   unstack orange_block_1 red_block_1
   ```

2. Place orange_block_1 on the table.
   ```
   putdown orange_block_1
   ```

3. Unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1.
   ```
   unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
   ```

4. Place red_block_1 on the table.
   ```
   putdown red_block_1
   ```

5. Unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1. This ensures we hold purple_block_1 at some point, satisfying constraint 2 and constraint 5.
   ```
   unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1
   ```

6. Place purple_block_1 on orange_block_1. This also satisfies constraint 5.
   ```
   stack purple_block_1 orange_block_1
   ```

7. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_2.
   ```
   unstack orange_block_2 white_block_2
   ```

8. Place orange_block_2 on white_block_1. This satisfies constraint 9.
   ```
   stack orange_block_2 white_block_1
   ```

9. Pickup white_block_2 and place it on top of white_block_3. This satisfies constraint 10.
   ```
   pickup white_block_2
   stack white_block_2 white_block_3
   ```

10. Unstack white_block_2 from white_block_3.
    ```
    unstack white_block_2 white_block_3
    ```

11. Place white_block_2 on top of red_block_1. This satisfies constraint 4.
    ```
    stack white_block_2 red_block_1
    ```

12. Unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1.
    ```
    unstack white_block_2 red_block_1
    ```

13. Place white_block_2 on top of orange_block_1. This satisfies constraint 8.
    ```
    stack white_block_2 orange_block_1
    ```

14. Unstack white_block_2 from orange_block_1.
    ```
    unstack white_block_2 orange_block_1
    ```

15. Put down white_block_2 on the table, since we need to perform other actions.
    ```
    putdown white_block_2
    ```

16. Unstack purple_block_1 from orange_block_1.
    ```
    unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1
    ```

17. Now, we can place purple_block_1 on the table.
    ```
    putdown purple_block_1
    ```

18. Pickup white_block_2 and place it on top of purple_block_1, which is our goal.
    ```
    pickup white_block_2
    stack white_block_2 purple_block_1
    ```

Ok, let's doublecheck the constraints once more to make sure our plan satisfies all of them:

1. At some point, white_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1.
   - Satisfied: In the initial state, white_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1.

2. After white_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1, you must be holding purple_block_1 at that point or later.
   - Satisfied: We hold purple_block_1 at step 5.

3. At some point, purple_block_1 is not on the table.
   - Satisfied: In the initial state, purple_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, not on the table.

4. After purple_block_1 is not on the table, white_block_2 must be on top of red_block_1 at that point or later.
   - Satisfied: We place white_block_2 on top of red_block_1 at step 11.

5. At some point, either purple_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 or you are holding purple_block_1.
   - Satisfied: We hold purple_block_1 at step 5 and we also place purple_block_1 on top of orange_block_1 at step 6.

6. At some point, white_block_1 is not clear.
   - Satisfied: In the initial state, white_block_1 has purple_block_1 on top of it, so it's not clear.

7. After white_block_1 is not clear, red_block_1 is not on the table at that point or later.
   - Satisfied: In the initial state, red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1, not on the table.

8. At some point, white_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1.
   - Satisfied: We place white_block_2 on top of orange_block_1 at step 13.

9. At some point, orange_block_2 is on top of white_block_1.
   - Satisfied: We place orange_block_2 on top of white_block_1 at step 8.

10. At some point, white_block_2 is on top of white_block_3.
    - Satisfied: We place white_block_2 on top of white_block_3 at step 9.

Goal: white_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1.
    - Satisfied: We place white_block_2 on top of purple_block_1 at step 18.

Let's make sure that our actions follow the preconditions:

1. Step 1: Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_1.
   Preconditions: orange_block_1 is on top of red_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear, and no block is in hand.
   Satisfied: All are true in the initial state.

4. Step 4: Putdown red_block_1.
   Preconditions: red_block_1 is in hand.
   Satisfied: After Step 3, red_block_1 is in hand.

5. Step 5: Unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1.
   Preconditions: purple_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, purple_block_1 is clear, and no block is in hand.
   Satisfied: After Step 4, purple_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, purple_block_1 is clear, and no block is in hand.

6. Step 6: Stack purple_block_1 on orange_block_1.
   Preconditions: purple_block_1 is in hand, orange_block_1 is clear.
   Satisfied: After Step 5, purple_block_1 is in hand and orange_block_1 is clear.

7. Step 7: Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_2.
   Preconditions: orange_block_2 is on top of white_block_2, orange_block_2 is clear, and no block is in hand.
   Satisfied: After Step 6, orange_block_2 is on top of white_block_2, orange_block_2 is clear, and no block is in hand.

8. Step 8: Stack orange_block_2 on white_block_1.
   Preconditions: orange_block_2 is in hand, white_block_1 is clear.
   Satisfied: After Step 7, orange_block_2 is in hand and white_block_1 is clear.

9. Step 9a: Pickup white_block_2.
   Preconditions: white_block_2 is on the table, white_block_2 is clear, and no block is in hand.
   Satisfied: After Step 8, white_block_2 is on the table, white_block_2 is clear, and no block is in hand.

10. Step 9b: Stack white_block_2 on white_block_3.
    Preconditions: white_block_2 is in hand, white_block_3 is clear.
    Satisfied: After Step 9a, white_block_2 is in hand and white_block_3 is clear.

11. Step 10: Unstack white_block_2 from white_block_3.
    Preconditions: white_block_2 is on top of white_block_3, white_block_2 is clear, and no block is in hand.
    Satisfied: After Step 9b, white_block_2 is on top of white_block_3, white_block_2 is clear, and no block is in hand.

12. Step 11: Stack white_block_2 on red_block_1.
    Preconditions: white_block_2 is in hand, red_block_1 is clear.
    Satisfied: After Step 10, white_block_2 is in hand and red_block_1 is clear.

    Satisfied: After Step 11, white_block_2 is on top of red_block_1, white_block_2 is clear, and no block is in hand.

14. Step 13: Stack white_block_2 on orange_block_1.
    Preconditions: white_block_2 is in hand, orange_block_1 has purple_block_1 on top of it, which is not clear.
    ** Not satisfied **: After Step 12, white_block_2 is in hand but orange_block_1 has purple_block_1 on top of it, which is not clear. So we can't stack white_block_2 on orange_block_1.

Okay, I made a mistake here. Let's revise the plan from step 13:

13. We need to place white_block_2 on top of orange_block_1 to satisfy constraint 8. However, orange_block_1 has purple_block_1 on top of it. So we first need to remove purple_block_1.
    ```
    putdown white_block_2
    unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1
    putdown purple_block_1
    pickup white_block_2
    stack white_block_2 orange_block_1
    ```

14. Now, to satisfy the goal, we need to place white_block_2 on top of purple_block_1.
    ```
    unstack white_block_2 orange_block_1
    putdown white_block_2
    pickup purple_block_1
    stack purple_block_1 red_block_1
    unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1
    putdown purple_block_1
    pickup white_block_2
    stack white_block_2 purple_block_1
    ```

Let me continue checking the plan more carefully, step by step.

Let me revise the entire plan from the beginning.

Initial state:
```
orange_block_1
red_block_1
purple_block_1          orange_block_2
white_block_1           white_block_2          white_block_3
```

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_1.
   ```
   unstack orange_block_1 red_block_1
   ```

2. Place orange_block_1 on the table.
   ```
   putdown orange_block_1
   ```

3. Unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1.
   ```
   unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
   ```

4. Place red_block_1 on the table.
   ```
   putdown red_block_1
   ```

5. Unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1. This ensures we hold purple_block_1 at some point, satisfying constraint 2 and constraint 5.
   ```
   unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1
   ```

6. Place purple_block_1 on orange_block_1. This also satisfies constraint 5.
   ```
   stack purple_block_1 orange_block_1
   ```

7. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_2.
   ```
   unstack orange_block_2 white_block_2
   ```

8. Place orange_block_2 on white_block_1. This satisfies constraint 9.
   ```
   stack orange_block_2 white_block_1
   ```

9. Pickup white_block_2 and place it on top of white_block_3. This satisfies constraint 10.
   ```
   pickup white_block_2
   stack white_block_2 white_block_3
   ```

10. Unstack white_block_2 from white_block_3.
    ```
    unstack white_block_2 white_block_3
    ```

11. Place white_block_2 on top of red_block_1. This satisfies constraint 4.
    ```
    stack white_block_2 red_block_1
    ```

12. Unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1.
    ```
    unstack white_block_2 red_block_1
    ```

13a. To satisfy constraint 8, we need to place white_block_2 on top of orange_block_1. However, orange_block_1 has purple_block_1 on top of it. So we first need to remove purple_block_1.
     ```
     putdown white_block_2
     ```

13b. Unstack purple_block_1 from orange_block_1.
     ```
     unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1
     ```

13c. Place purple_block_1 on the table.
     ```
     putdown purple_block_1
     ```

13d. Pickup white_block_2.
     ```
     pickup white_block_2
     ```

13e. Stack white_block_2 on orange_block_1. This satisfies constraint 8.
     ```
     stack white_block_2 orange_block_1
     ```

14a. Unstack white_block_2 from orange_block_1.
     ```
     unstack white_block_2 orange_block_1
     ```

14b. Finally, to satisfy the goal, we place white_block_2 on top of purple_block_1.
     ```
