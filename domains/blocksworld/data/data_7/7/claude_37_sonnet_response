Let me break down this problem. I'm given a blocksworld scenario with various blocks. The initial state is:

- white_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_2 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on top of white_block_2
- orange_block_2 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1, orange_block_1, green_block_1, orange_block_2, and red_block_1 are all clear (nothing on top)
- I am not holding any block

The goal is simple:
- yellow_block_1 is on the table

But there are numerous constraints to be satisfied along the way. Let me go through each constraint:

1. "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
2. If "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is true in state s, then at state s or later, either "white_block_2 is clear" or "white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" must be true.
3. "green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
4. If "green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1" is true in state s, then at state s or later, "orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2" must be true.
5. "red_block_1 is not clear" must hold in at least one state.
6. "orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
7. If "orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1" is true in state s, then at state s or later, either "orange_block_1 is not on the table" or "red_block_1 is not clear" must be true.
8. Both "green_block_1 is not clear" and "orange_block_1 is not clear" must be true in at least one state.
9. "white_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
10. If "white_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1" is true in state s, then at state s or later, either "red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2" or "orange_block_2 is not on the table" must be true.
11. "you are holding yellow_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
12. If "you are holding yellow_block_1" is true in some state, then in an earlier state, either "white_block_1 is clear" or "red_block_1 is not on the table" must be true.

Now, let me analyze the initial state relative to these constraints:

- Constraint 1: "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" - This is not true in the initial state, so I'll need to move yellow_block_1 at some point.
- Constraint 2: Once I move yellow_block_1 off white_block_1, I'll need to ensure either white_block_2 is clear (which it's not, as green_block_1 is on it) or white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1 (which it's not, it's the other way around).
- Constraint 3: "green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1" - This is true in the initial state since green_block_1 is on white_block_2.
- Constraint 4: Due to Constraint 3 being true initially, I need to ensure orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2 at some point.
- Constraint 5: "red_block_1 is not clear" - This is not true in the initial state, as red_block_1 is clear. I'll need to place a block on top of red_block_1 at some point.
- Constraint 6: "orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1" - This is true in the initial state as orange_block_1 is on the table.
- Constraint 7: As per Constraint 6, since "orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1" is true in the initial state, I need to ensure either orange_block_1 is not on the table or red_block_1 is not clear.
- Constraint 8: I need to have blocks on top of both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 at some point.
- Constraint 9: "white_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1" - This is true in the initial state as white_block_1 is on the table.
- Constraint 10: As per Constraint 9, since "white_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1" is true in the initial state, I need to ensure either red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2 or orange_block_2 is not on the table.
- Constraint 11: "you are holding yellow_block_1" - This is not true in the initial state. I'll need to hold yellow_block_1 at some point.
- Constraint 12: Before I hold yellow_block_1, I need to ensure either white_block_1 is clear (which it's not, as yellow_block_1 is on it) or red_block_1 is not on the table.

Based on this, I can see that I need to perform several actions to satisfy all constraints and reach the goal. Let me think about a plan:

First, to satisfy Constraint 12, I need to ensure either white_block_1 is clear or red_block_1 is not on the table before I hold yellow_block_1. Since white_block_1 is not clear (yellow_block_1 is on it), I'll need to make red_block_1 not on the table.

1. "unstack red_block_1 from table" - Wait, this isn't allowed. The only way to pick up a block from the table is "pickup red_block_1". But is that legitimate given the actions and preconditions? Yes, the "pickup" action can be performed on a block if it's clear, on the table, and I'm not holding any block. 

Hmm, no. The issue is I can only use "pickup" to lift a block from the table, not "unstack". "unstack" is for removing a block from the top of another block.

Ok let's think more directly. I need to:
1. Unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1 (this achieves Constraint 1)
2. Put yellow_block_1 on the table (this achieves the goal)

But before I unstack yellow_block_1, I need to satisfy Constraint 12, which requires either white_block_1 to be clear (which it's not, as yellow_block_1 is on it) or red_block_1 not on the table.

Let's pick up red_block_1 to satisfy Constraint 12:

1. pickup red_block_1 (red_block_1 is now not on the table, satisfying the condition for Constraint 12)
2. stack red_block_1 orange_block_2 (this will help with Constraint 10 by making red_block_1 on top of orange_block_2)

Now, I can unstack yellow_block_1:

3. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, satisfying Constraint 1)

But after achieving Constraint 1, I need to satisfy Constraint 2, which requires either white_block_2 is clear (which it's not, as green_block_1 is on it) or white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1 (which it's not, as it's the other way around).

4. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2 (this makes white_block_2 clear, satisfying Constraint 2)
5. putdown yellow_block_1 (this is our goal)

Ok, this is the beginning of a plan, but I still haven't satisfied Constraints 4, 5, 7, 8, and 10.

Specifically, I still need to:
- Meet constraint 4: "orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2"
- Meet constraint 5: "red_block_1 is not clear"
- Meet constraint 7: Either "orange_block_1 is not on the table" or "red_block_1 is not clear"
- Meet constraint 8: Both "green_block_1 is not clear" and "orange_block_1 is not clear"

So to continue our plan:

6. pickup orange_block_1 (orange_block_1 is not on the table, helping with Constraint 7)
7. stack orange_block_1 white_block_2 (orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2, satisfying Constraint 4)
8. pickup green_block_1 (which I previously unstacked)
9. stack green_block_1 orange_block_1 (green_block_1 is not clear and orange_block_1 is not clear, satisfying Constraint 8)

Wait, there's still Constraint 5, which requires red_block_1 to not be clear. red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2, so it's clear. Let's put something on top of it:

10. pickup white_block_1 (white_block_1 is clear since yellow_block_1 is no longer on it)
11. stack white_block_1 red_block_1 (red_block_1 is not clear, satisfying Constraint 5)

It looks like I've satisfied all constraints. Let me double-check:

1. "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" - True due to step 3.
2. After step 3, "white_block_2 is clear" became true due to step 4, satisfying this constraint.
3. "green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1" - True from the initial state.
4. Due to Constraint 3 being true, "orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2" is true after step 7, satisfying this constraint.
5. "red_block_1 is not clear" - True after step 11.
6. "orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1" - True from the initial state.
7. Due to Constraint 6 being true, "orange_block_1 is not on the table" is true after step 6, satisfying this constraint.
8. Both "green_block_1 is not clear" and "orange_block_1 is not clear" are true after step 9, satisfying this constraint.
9. "white_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1" - True from the initial state.
10. Due to Constraint 9 being true, "red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2" is true after step 2, satisfying this constraint.
11. "you are holding yellow_block_1" - True after step 3 before step 5.
12. Before step 3, "red_block_1 is not on the table" is true after step 1, satisfying this constraint.

So the full plan is:

1. pickup red_block_1
2. stack red_block_1 orange_block_2
3. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
4. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
5. putdown yellow_block_1
6. pickup orange_block_1
7. stack orange_block_1 white_block_2
8. pickup green_block_1
9. stack green_block_1 orange_block_1
10. pickup white_block_1
11. stack white_block_1 red_block_1

Wait, let me check a detail. Step 4, we unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2. But at this point we're holding yellow_block_1 from step 3. We can't do step 4 until we've put down yellow_block_1. So the corrected order is:

1. pickup red_block_1
2. stack red_block_1 orange_block_2
3. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1 (achieved goal)
5. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
6. pickup orange_block_1
7. stack orange_block_1 white_block_2
8. stack green_block_1 orange_block_1
9. pickup white_block_1
10. stack white_block_1 red_block_1

This ensures all constraints are still met, and it corrects the issue of not holding multiple blocks at once.

Actually, I still need to check. Steps 8 and 9 might have issues.

5. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2 (holding green_block_1)
6. pickup orange_block_1 (but I'm holding green_block_1, so this isn't allowed)

Let's correct it again:

1. pickup red_block_1
2. stack red_block_1 orange_block_2
3. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1 (achieved goal)
5. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
6. putdown green_block_1
7. pickup orange_block_1
8. stack orange_block_1 white_block_2
9. pickup green_block_1
10. stack green_block_1 orange_block_1
11. pickup white_block_1
12. stack white_block_1 red_block_1

But also, let's see if we can be a bit more efficient. The goal is simply to have yellow_block_1 on the table, and the constraints just require certain states to be true at some point in the plan. Let's see if we can find a more direct route.

One observation: the goal is to have yellow_block_1 on the table, which is currently on top of white_block_1. Simply unstacking and putting it down would achieve the goal, but we need to meet all the constraints.

Looking at the constraints, the only one that might be problematic for this simple approach is Constraint 12, which requires either white_block_1 to be clear or red_block_1 not on the table before we hold yellow_block_1. Since white_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on it, we need to make red_block_1 not on the table first.

So here's a plan:

1. pickup red_block_1 (Now red_block_1 is not on the table, satisfying the condition for Constraint 12)
2. stack red_block_1 orange_block_2 (This satisfies Constraint 10 by making "red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2" true)
3. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1 (This meets Constraint 1, "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1", and Constraint 11, "you are holding yellow_block_1")
4. putdown yellow_block_1 (This is our goal)

But we still need to ensure we satisfy all other constraints:

- Constraint 2: After step 3, "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is true, so we need either "white_block_2 is clear" or "white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1". Currently, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_2, so we need to unstack it.
- Constraint 4: Since "green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1" is true from the initial state, we need to ensure "orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2" at some point.
- Constraint 5: We need "red_block_1 is not clear" to be true at some point. red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2 after step 2, so it's clear.
- Constraint 7: Since "orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1" is true from the initial state, we need to ensure either "orange_block_1 is not on the table" or "red_block_1 is not clear".
- Constraint 8: We need both "green_block_1 is not clear" and "orange_block_1 is not clear" to be true at some point.

Let's continue our plan to satisfy these:

5. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2 (This satisfies Constraint 2, "white_block_2 is clear")
6. putdown green_block_1
7. pickup orange_block_1
8. stack orange_block_1 white_block_2 (This satisfies Constraint 4, "orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2", and partially satisfies Constraint 7 by making "orange_block_1 is not on the table" true)
9. pickup green_block_1
10. stack green_block_1 orange_block_1 (This satisfies Constraint 8, both "green_block_1 is not clear" and "orange_block_1 is not clear")
11. pickup white_block_1
12. stack white_block_1 red_block_1 (This satisfies Constraint 5, "red_block_1 is not clear", and fully satisfies Constraint 7 by making "red_block_1 is not clear" true)

With this plan, we satisfy all constraints and achieve our goal.

Actually, let me go through the plan once more to make sure it's correct and optimal:

1. pickup red_block_1
2. stack red_block_1 orange_block_2
3. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1 (achieved goal)
5. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
6. putdown green_block_1
7. pickup orange_block_1
8. stack orange_block_1 white_block_2
9. pickup green_block_1
10. stack green_block_1 orange_block_1
11. pickup white_block_1
12. stack white_block_1 red_block_1

Wait, let's reason backwards and see if there's a more direct way to do this. The goal is to have yellow_block_1 on the table, and then we need to meet all the constraints.

Let me see. Our current plan has 12 steps. Let me see if a different sequence of the same actions would be more efficient.

Actually, the goal is just "yellow_block_1 is on the table". Our plan meets this after 4 steps. The rest of the steps are just to meet other constraints. If we can achieve those constraints in fewer steps or combine them somehow, we can save steps.

But first, are there any constraints we can meet in the initial state without any action?

- Constraint 3: "green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1" - True from the initial state.
- Constraint 6: "orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1" - True from the initial state.
- Constraint 9: "white_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1" - True from the initial state.

Then for the constraints that are true in the initial state, we need to ensure subsequent constraints:

- Due to Constraint 3 being true, we need to ensure "orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2" at some point (Constraint 4).
- Due to Constraint 6 being true, we need to ensure either "orange_block_1 is not on the table" or "red_block_1 is not clear" (Constraint 7).
- Due to Constraint 9 being true, we need to ensure either "red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2" or "orange_block_2 is not on the table" (Constraint 10).

We also have the constraints:

- Constraint 1: "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
- Constraint 2: If "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is true in state s, then at state s or later, either "white_block_2 is clear" or "white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" must be true.
- Constraint 5: "red_block_1 is not clear" must hold in at least one state.
- Constraint 8: Both "green_block_1 is not clear" and "orange_block_1 is not clear" must be true in at least one state.
- Constraint 11: "you are holding yellow_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
- Constraint 12: If "you are holding yellow_block_1" is true in some state, then in an earlier state, either "white_block_1 is clear" or "red_block_1 is not on the table" must be true.

Hmm, I don't think we can avoid the 12 steps, because we need to make 12 different conditions true at some point in the plan that aren't true in the initial state, and each step can only make one block-related or holding-related change.

Let's confirm our plan again, this time checking that each constraint is indeed met at the appropriate step:

1. pickup red_block_1 (Now red_block_1 is not on the table, meeting the condition for Constraint 12)
2. stack red_block_1 orange_block_2 (This satisfies Constraint 10, "red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2")
3. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1 (This meets Constraint 1, "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1", and Constraint 11, "you are holding yellow_block_1")
4. putdown yellow_block_1 (Goal achieved)
5. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2 (This satisfies Constraint 2, "white_block_2 is clear")
6. putdown green_block_1
7. pickup orange_block_1
8. stack orange_block_1 white_block_2 (This satisfies Constraint 4, "orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2", and partially satisfies Constraint 7 by making "orange_block_1 is not on the table" true)
9. pickup green_block_1
10. stack green_block_1 orange_block_1 (This satisfies Constraint 8, both "green_block_1 is not clear" and "orange_block_1 is not clear")
11. pickup white_block_1
12. stack white_block_1 red_block_1 (This satisfies Constraint 5, "red_block_1 is not clear", and fully satisfies Constraint 7 by making "red_block_1 is not clear" true)

That plan looks optimal and valid to me.

Wait, I realized that I might be misunderstanding some of the constraints. Let me reread and make sure I'm interpreting them correctly.

Constraint 12 states: "If 'you are holding yellow_block_1' is true in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: white_block_1 is clear, red_block_1 is not on the table'."

So before I unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1, I need to ensure either white_block_1 is clear or red_block_1 is not on the table. But the issue is that white_block_1 can't be clear if yellow_block_1 is on it, so I need to ensure red_block_1 is not on the table before I hold yellow_block_1, which is what my plan already does.

Let me recheck the other constraints once more. In particular, Constraint 2 states: "If 'yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1' holds in some state s, then 'At least one of the following conditions is true: white_block_2 is clear, white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1' must hold at s or at some state after s."

Once I unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1 (making "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" true), I need to ensure either white_block_2 is clear or white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1. Since green_block_1 is on top of white_block_2 in the initial state, the only way to fulfill this constraint is to clear white_block_2, which is what step 5 in my plan does.

Checking the other constraints follows a similar logic, and it seems like the 12-step plan I proposed is optimal.

Let me finalize the 12-step plan:

1. pickup red_block_1
2. stack red_block_1 orange_block_2
3. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1
5. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
6. putdown green_block_1
7. pickup orange_block_1
8. stack orange_block_1 white_block_2
9. pickup green_block_1
10. stack green_block_1 orange_block_1
11. pickup white_block_1
12. stack white_block_1 red_block_1

This plan executes the necessary steps to achieve our goal and meet all constraints, and I believe it's optimal.

Yep, I now have the order of actions correct. This plan should work, let me confirm once more:

1. pickup red_block_1
2. stack red_block_1 orange_block_2
3. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1
5. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
6. putdown green_block_1
7. pickup orange_block_1
8. stack orange_block_1 white_block_2
9. pickup green_block_1
10. stack green_block_1 orange_block_1
11. pickup white_block_1
12. stack white_block_1 red_block_1
