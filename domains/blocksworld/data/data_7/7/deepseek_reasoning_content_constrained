Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld problem. The goal is to get yellow_block_1 on the table. The initial state has yellow_block_1 on top of white_block_1. So, the first thought is to unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1 and put it down. But wait, there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy. Let me list them out and see how they affect the plan.

First, the constraints:

1. At least once, yellow_block_1 is not on white_block_1. Well, since our goal is to have it on the table, that condition will be true once we move it, so that's covered.

2. Whenever yellow_block_1 is not on white_block_1 (which will happen after we move it), we need white_block_2 to be clear or white_block_2 on green_block_1. Initially, white_block_2 has green_block_1 on it, so white_block_2 isn't clear. So after moving yellow, we might need to do something with white_block_2 or green_block_1. Hmm.

3. green_block_1 must not be on yellow_block_1 in some state. But initially, green is on white_block_2. So maybe this is already satisfied? Wait, the initial state has green on white_block_2. So green is not on yellow_block_1 ever unless we stack it there. But since we don't need to do that, maybe this constraint is already met. Wait, but the problem says "must hold in at least one state". So maybe we need to ensure that in the plan, there's a state where green is not on yellow. Since in the initial state, green is on white_block_2, that's already true. So this constraint is automatically satisfied. But maybe after some actions, could green be placed on yellow? Let me check. The plan should avoid that. So perhaps this constraint is already met by the initial state, but maybe we have to ensure it remains true. Wait, no: the constraint says "at least one state" must have green not on yellow. Since in the initial state, green is on white_block_2, which is not yellow_block_1, this is true. So this constraint is already satisfied. But maybe I need to confirm that.

4. If green_block_1 is not on yellow_block_1 in some state s, then orange_block_1 must be on white_block_2 in s or later. But in the initial state, green is not on yellow, so s is the initial state. Therefore, we need to ensure that at some point after that, orange_block_1 is on white_block_2. Wait, but the initial state has orange_block_1 on the table. So this constraint requires that at some point, orange_block_1 is stacked on white_block_2. Hmm. So even though the first part of the constraint is already true in the initial state, the implication requires that orange_block_1 is on white_block_2 at some point. So we need to stack orange_block_1 onto white_block_2 at some step.

5. red_block_1 must have a block on top in some state. So we need to stack something on red_block_1 at some point.

6. orange_block_1 is not on red_block_1 in some state. Since initially, orange_block_1 is on the table and red is on the table, they are not on top of each other, so that's true. But the implication here is that if in any state s, orange is not on red, then either orange is not on the table or red has a block on top. But since in the initial state, orange is on the table and red is clear, the implication requires that either orange is not on the table (so we need to move it) or red has a block on top. So if we leave orange on the table, we must stack something on red. But according to constraint 5, we already need to stack something on red. So maybe this is handled by satisfying constraint 5. But we need to make sure that whenever orange is not on red (which is always except if we stack orange on red), the conditions hold. Wait, the constraint is "If expression 'orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1' holds in some state s, then ...". So in any state where orange is not on red, we need either orange not on table or red has a block. So in the initial state, orange is on table and red is clear. So that's a problem because the implication is triggered. So we have to fix that. Therefore, we need to either move orange_block_1 off the table (stack it somewhere) or put a block on red_block_1. Since constraint 5 requires putting a block on red_block_1, maybe that's the way to go. So stack something on red_block_1, which satisfies both constraints 5 and 6's implication.

7. There must be a state where both green_block_1 has a block on top and orange_block_1 has a block on top. Currently, green is clear (has green on white_block_2, nothing on green), and orange_block_1 is clear. So to satisfy this, we need to stack something on both green and orange_block_1.

8. white_block_1 is not on orange_block_1 in some state. Initially, they are both on the table, so white_block_1 is not on orange_block_1. So this is already true. But the implication here is that if in any state s, white_block_1 is not on orange_block_1, then either red_block_1 is on orange_block_2 or orange_block_2 is not on the table. Currently, orange_block_2 is on the table, so the condition requires that if we have a state where white is not on orange, then we need red on orange_2 or orange_2 not on table. But since in the initial state, white is not on orange, we need to either stack red on orange_2 or move orange_2. So maybe stack red on orange_2?

9. Must be holding yellow_block_1 in some state. Well, to move yellow to the table, we have to pick it up, which satisfies this. But perhaps during the process, we do that.

10. If holding yellow_block_1 in some state, then in an earlier state, either white_block_1 is clear or red is not on the table. Initially, white_block_1 has yellow on top, so it's not clear. And red is on the table. So before picking up yellow, we need to make sure that either white_block_1 is clear (which it isn't, since yellow is on it) or red is not on the table. Wait, but yellow is on white_block_1, so to pick up yellow, we need to unstack it, which requires that yellow is clear (which it is, according to initial state). Wait, the preconditions for unstacking yellow from white_block_1 are that yellow is clear (which it is), the arm is empty, and yellow is on white_block_1. So perhaps the action is unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1. Then we can put it down. But according to constraint 10, when we hold yellow_block_1 (which we do after unstack), there must be a prior state where either white_block_1 is clear or red is not on the table. But in the initial state, white_block_1 is not clear (yellow is on it), and red is on the table. So when we perform the unstack action, we have to check if the prior state (initial state) meets the condition. But the initial state doesn't satisfy either. So this is a problem. Therefore, we need to have, before picking up yellow_block_1, a state where either white_block_1 is clear (which it's not) or red is not on the table. So how can we achieve that?

Wait, the constraint says that if we hold yellow in some state s, there must be an earlier state (before s) where either white_block_1 is clear or red is not on the table. But in the initial state, white_block_1 has yellow on it, so not clear, and red is on table. So to satisfy this, before picking up yellow, we need to make red not on the table. How? By picking up red and stacking it somewhere. But that would require moving red, but we need to stack something on red as per constraint 5. Alternatively, perhaps stack another block on red.

Wait, but the constraint is about the prior state before holding yellow. So let's think: the action that leads to holding yellow is unstack yellow from white_block_1. The pre-state for that action is the initial state. So the initial state must have either white_block_1 clear (which it's not) or red not on table. But red is on the table. So this is a problem. So we need to modify the plan to ensure that before unstacking yellow, either white_block_1 is clear (which would require removing yellow from it, but that's what we're trying to do) or red is not on the table. But how can we make red not on the table before unstacking yellow? We have to move red. So perhaps we need to first pick up red and put it somewhere else, then proceed to unstack yellow. But that's adding steps, but maybe necessary.

Wait, let's outline the steps:

If we first move red_block_1, say stack it on orange_block_2 (to satisfy constraint 8, which requires red on orange_2 or orange_2 not on table). So if we stack red on orange_2, then red is not on the table anymore, satisfying the prior condition for holding yellow. Then, when we unstack yellow, the prior state (after moving red) would have red not on the table, which satisfies the condition for the implication in constraint 10.

So steps:

1. pickup red_block_1 (but wait, red is on the table and clear. So can pickup red. Then put it down? But then it's back on the table. Alternatively, stack it on orange_block_2. Let's see:

- pickup red_block_1: possible because it's on table and clear, and arm is empty.

- stack red_block_1 orange_block_2: possible if orange_block_2 is clear (which it is). After stacking, red is on orange_2, which is on table. So now red is not on table. Then, when we unstack yellow, the prior state (after stacking red) has red not on table, so the condition is satisfied. Then, when we unstack yellow, we're holding it, and the prior state (after stacking red) meets the condition.

But this adds steps. Let's check.

So initial plan steps:

1. pickup red_block_1

2. stack red_block_1 orange_block_2

3. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1

4. putdown yellow_block_1

But then the goal is achieved. However, there are other constraints to satisfy.

But let's check if this satisfies all constraints.

Let's go through each constraint:

1. "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" must hold in at least one state. After step 3, yellow is in the arm; then after step 4, it's on the table. So this holds from step 3 onward. Satisfied.

2. When yellow is not on white_1 (from step 3), then white_block_2 must be clear or on green_block_1. Initially, white_block_2 has green on it, so it's not clear. After step 3, white_block_2 still has green. So we need to ensure that either white_block_2 is clear (by removing green) or stack white_block_2 on green. Wait, the condition is "white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1". But white_block_2 is under green_block_1. To make white_block_2 on green, we need to move it, but blocks are stacked from bottom to top. So that's impossible unless we unstack green from white_block_2 and then stack white_block_2 on green, but white_block_2 is on the table. So that's not possible. So perhaps the only way is to make white_block_2 clear. So we need to unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2 and put it somewhere else. But when? Because after step 3, we need to ensure that white_block_2 is clear at some point after step 3.

So after moving yellow, we need to clear white_block_2. So let's add steps after step 4:

5. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2

6. putdown green_block_1

Now, after step 5, white_block_2 is clear. So the condition for constraint 2 is satisfied.

But then, the implication for constraint 4: when green is not on yellow (which is always true, since green is moved to the table), we need orange_block_1 to be on white_block_2. So after step 5, green is not on yellow (still true), so we need to stack orange_block_1 on white_block_2. So step 7: pickup orange_block_1 (it's on table and clear), stack orange_block_1 white_block_2. But after step 6, white_block_2 is clear, so we can stack.

So step 7: stack orange_block_1 white_block_2.

Now, constraint 4 is satisfied because after step 5, green is not on yellow, and in step 7, orange is stacked on white_block_2.

Next, constraint 5: red_block_1 must have a block on top in some state. We stacked red on orange_block_2 in step 2, so red is on orange_2. So red is not clear. Wait, no: red is on top of orange_2. So red is clear, but orange_2 is not. Wait, the constraint is that red has a block on top, i.e., red is not clear. But in step 2, we stacked red on orange_2, so red is on orange_2. So red is not on the table, but is red clear? After stacking, the block that is stacked (red) is clear. Because when you stack x on y, x becomes clear. Wait, the effect of stack x y is: x is on y, x is clear, y is not clear. So after stacking red on orange_2, red is clear, and orange_2 is not. So red_block_1 is clear. So constraint 5 requires that in some state, red is not clear (has a block on top). So we need to stack something on red. But red is on orange_2. So to stack something on red, we need to have another block. Let's see which blocks are available: yellow is on table, green is on table, orange_1 is on white_block_2, white_1 is on table (with nothing on it), white_2 has orange_1, orange_2 has red, and the initial blocks. So perhaps we can stack yellow on red. But after step 4, yellow is on table. So steps could be:

After step 4, before step 5:

But let's reorganize. Maybe after stacking red on orange_2 (step 2), we need to stack something on red. But red is on orange_2. To stack on red, we need to pick up a block and stack it on red. Let's say after step 2, we do:

3. pickup yellow_block_1 (but we can't, because yellow is on white_1 and we need to unstack it first. Wait, initial state: yellow is on white_1. So step 3 should be unstack yellow from white_1, but the problem is that before doing that, we need to ensure that the prior state (after step 2) satisfies constraint 10. Let's see: after step 2, red is on orange_2. So red is not on the table. Therefore, in the state after step 2, red is not on the table. So when we proceed to unstack yellow in step 3, the prior state (step 2) has red not on the table, which satisfies the condition for constraint 10. So that's okay. So step 3: unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1. Then step 4: putdown yellow_block_1. Then we need to stack something on red_block_1 to satisfy constraint 5. So after step 4, yellow is on table. Maybe pick up yellow again and stack it on red. But why? Because red needs to have a block on top. So steps:

5. pickup yellow_block_1 (possible, it's on table and clear)

6. stack yellow_block_1 red_block_1 (possible if red is clear. After step 2, red is on orange_2 and clear. So yes. Stacking yellow on red would make red not clear. Then, after step 6, red has yellow on top, so constraint 5 is satisfied.

But then we have to put yellow back on the table, but the goal is to have yellow on the table. Wait, no. The goal is yellow on the table. So if we stack it on red, that's not the goal. So this would complicate things. So perhaps instead of stacking yellow on red, use another block. Let's see available blocks after step 4:

yellow is on table.

Other blocks: green is on white_block_2, which we need to move to satisfy constraint 2. Also, orange_block_1 is on table, white_block_1 is on table, orange_block_2 has red, white_block_2 has green, red is on orange_2. So maybe stack green on red. But green is on white_block_2. So steps:

5. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2

6. stack green_block_1 red_block_1

This would make red have green on top, satisfying constraint 5.

But then we need to put green somewhere else later, but maybe that's okay. Let's see:

After step 6, green is on red, which is on orange_2. Then, to satisfy constraint 4: after moving green (step 5), green is not on yellow (which it never was), so we need to stack orange_block_1 on white_block_2. So after step 5, we need to stack orange_block_1 on white_block_2. So step 7: pickup orange_block_1 (on table, clear), stack orange_block_1 white_block_2.

Now, white_block_2 has orange_block_1. Then, we can proceed.

But after all this, the goal is yellow on table. But if we stacked yellow on red, that's a problem. So maybe using another block to stack on red. Let's see, perhaps use orange_block_2. But orange_block_2 is under red. Wait, no. After step 2, orange_block_2 has red on it. So to stack something on red, we can pick up any other block and stack it on red. For example, orange_block_1 is on the table. So after step 2:

3. pickup orange_block_1

4. stack orange_block_1 red_block_1

Now, red has orange_block_1 on top, so red is not clear. This satisfies constraint 5.

But then, we need to proceed to unstack yellow. But now, after step 4, red has orange_block_1, which is clear. So to unstack yellow, we need to check constraint 10. Wait, after step 4, red is on orange_2, and orange_1 is on red. So red is not on the table. So when we unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1 (step 5), the prior state (after step 4) has red not on the table. Therefore, constraint 10 is satisfied.

So steps:

1. pickup red_block_1

2. stack red_block_1 orange_block_2

3. pickup orange_block_1

4. stack orange_block_1 red_block_1 (now red has orange_1 on top, so red is not clear, satisfying constraint 5)

5. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1

6. putdown yellow_block_1 (goal achieved)

But then we need to handle constraint 2: after moving yellow, white_block_2 must be clear or on green. Initially, white_block_2 has green, which is not clear. After step 6, green is still on white_block_2. So we need to make white_block_2 clear. So steps after 6:

7. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2

8. putdown green_block_1

Now, white_block_2 is clear, satisfying constraint 2.

But then, constraint 4: when green is not on yellow (which is always true), orange_block_1 must be on white_block_2. After step 8, green is on table. So we need to stack orange_block_1 on white_block_2. But orange_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 (from step 4). So to stack it on white_block_2, we need to unstack it from red.

So steps:

9. unstack orange_block_1 red_block_1

10. stack orange_block_1 white_block_2

Now, constraint 4 is satisfied.

But now, we have to check all constraints:

- constraint 7: there must be a state where green and orange_1 have blocks on top. So when are they not clear? Let's see:

After step 4: orange_1 is on red, so orange_1 is clear (since stack's effect makes the top block clear). So orange_1 is clear. Green is on white_2, clear. So not satisfied.

After step 10: orange_1 is on white_2, so orange_1 is clear. Green is on table, clear. Still not.

When is green not clear? If we stack something on green. Similarly for orange_1.

We need to find a state where both have blocks on them.

So perhaps after step 10, stack something on green and on orange_1.

But available blocks: yellow is on table, green is on table, orange_1 is on white_2, red is on orange_2 with orange_1 stacked and then moved. Wait, after step 9, red_block_1 is clear (since we unstacked orange_1). So perhaps stack green_block_1 on orange_block_1 (which is on white_2), and stack another block on orange_block_1. Wait, but we need two blocks to stack on green and orange_1. Let's see:

Available blocks: yellow, green, orange_1 (on white_2), white_1, white_2 (has orange_1), orange_2 (has red), red (clear after step 9), and orange_1 is on white_2.

So after step 10, orange_1 is on white_2, which is clear. So to stack on orange_1, we can pick up yellow or green.

For example:

11. pickup green_block_1 (from table)

12. stack green_block_1 orange_block_1 (now orange_1 has green on top, so not clear)

13. pickup yellow_block_1 (from table)

14. stack yellow_block_1 green_block_1 (now green has yellow on top, not clear)

But this is adding many steps. However, constraint 7 requires that in some state, both green and orange_1 have blocks on top. So after step 12, orange_1 has green on top. After step 14, green has yellow. So in step 12, green is on orange_1 (so orange_1 is not clear), and green is clear. Then in step 14, green has yellow, so green is not clear. So the state after step 14 would have both green and orange_1 not clear. But do we need to have both at the same time? The constraint says "the following conditions are all true: there is a block on top of green_block_1 and on orange_block_1". So in any state where both are not clear. So perhaps steps 12 and 14 can achieve that. But this is adding many steps. Is there a more efficient way?

Alternatively, after step 10 (orange_1 on white_2), stack green on orange_1 (step 11), and stack something else on green (step 12). But that requires two more steps. But maybe we can use another block, like white_block_1. But white_block_1 is on the table. Let's say after step 10:

11. pickup white_block_1 (it's on table, clear)

12. stack white_block_1 orange_block_1 (now orange_1 has white_1 on top, so not clear)

13. pickup green_block_1 (from table)

14. stack green_block_1 white_block_1 (now white_1 has green, so green is clear, white_1 not clear. Not helpful for constraint 7, which requires both green and orange_1 to have blocks on top. So in this case, orange_1 has white_1, which is not clear, but green is on white_1, which is not clear. So green is not clear, and orange_1 is not clear. Wait, no: when you stack x on y, x becomes clear. So after step 12: white_1 is on orange_1, so white_1 is clear. Then step 14: green is on white_1, so green is clear. So that's not helpful. Hmm.

Alternatively, after step 10, stack green on orange_1 and stack yellow on green:

11. pickup green_block_1

12. stack green_block_1 orange_block_1 (orange_1 not clear, green is clear)

13. pickup yellow_block_1

14. stack yellow_block_1 green_block_1 (green not clear, yellow clear)

Now, in step 14, green is not clear (has yellow), and orange_1 is not clear (has green). So constraint 7 is satisfied.

But this adds steps. But the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). So maybe this is necessary.

Now, moving on to constraint 8: white_block_1 is not on orange_block_1 in some state. Initially, they are both on table, so that's true. The implication is that if white is not on orange, then red is on orange_2 or orange_2 is not on the table. In our plan, after step 2, red is on orange_2, so red is on orange_2. Therefore, the implication is satisfied whenever white is not on orange, which is always the case. So this is handled.

Constraint 9: must hold yellow in some state. Steps 5 (unstack yellow) satisfies that.

Constraint 10: when holding yellow (step 5), prior state (step 4) has red not on table (stacked on orange_2), so condition satisfied.

Now, let's check all constraints:

1. yellow not on white_1: yes, after step 5.

2. after step 5, white_2 must be clear or on green. Initially, white_2 has green. After step 8, white_2 is clear. So by step 8, the condition is satisfied.

3. green not on yellow: always true.

4. when green not on yellow (always), orange_1 must be on white_2. After step 10, orange_1 is on white_2.

5. red has block on top: after step 4, orange_1 is on red. So red is not clear. Then, after step 9, red is clear again (when we unstack orange_1). But the constraint requires that in at least one state, red is not clear. So step 4 to step 8, red has orange_1 on top, so that's satisfied.

6. orange_1 not on red in some state: after step 9, orange_1 is unstacked from red. So that's satisfied. The implication here is that when orange_1 is not on red (after step 9), either orange_1 is not on table or red has a block. After step 9, orange_1 is being held (step 9 is unstack orange_1 from red, so after step 9, arm is holding orange_1. Then step 10 is stack orange_1 on white_2. So after step 10, orange_1 is on white_2 (not on table) and red is clear. So the condition is satisfied because orange_1 is not on table. So the implication is handled.

7. both green and orange_1 have blocks on top: after steps 12 and 14, this is true.

8. white_1 not on orange_1: always true.

9. hold yellow: step 5.

10. when holding yellow, prior state had red not on table.

So all constraints are satisfied.

But this seems like a very long plan. Let's count the steps:

1. pickup red_block_1

2. stack red_block_1 orange_block_2

3. pickup orange_block_1

4. stack orange_block_1 red_block_1

5. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1

6. putdown yellow_block_1

7. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2

8. putdown green_block_1

9. unstack orange_block_1 red_block_1

10. stack orange_block_1 white_block_2

11. pickup green_block_1

12. stack green_block_1 orange_block_1

13. pickup yellow_block_1

14. stack yellow_block_1 green_block_1

But the goal is to have yellow on the table. After step 14, yellow is on green. So we need to put it back. But that adds more steps. So this approach is flawed.

Wait, no. The goal is to have yellow on the table. So in step 6, yellow is put down. But then in step 13, we pick it up again and stack it. Which would move it from the table to on top of green. That would violate the goal. So this plan is invalid because the final state has yellow on green, not on the table.

This is a problem. So we need to ensure that after all steps, yellow is on the table. So steps that involve moving yellow after step 6 must not happen. Therefore, the plan must end with yellow on the table. So the steps after step 6 (putdown yellow) must not involve moving yellow again. Therefore, the stacking of yellow on green (step 14) is invalid. So we need another way to satisfy constraint 7 without moving yellow again.

Alternative approach: After step 10 (orange_1 on white_2), find another way to make both green and orange_1 have blocks on top without using yellow. For example, use white_block_1 and orange_block_2.

After step 10:

11. pickup white_block_1 (on table, clear)

12. stack white_block_1 orange_block_1 (now orange_1 has white_1 on top, not clear)

13. pickup orange_block_2 (which has red on top. To pickup orange_block_2, we need to unstack red first. But orange_block_2 is on the table with red on top. So to unstack red from orange_2:

13. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_2

14. putdown red_block_1

15. pickup orange_block_2

16. stack orange_block_2 green_block_1 (if green is on table. After step 8, green is on table.)

But this is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, after step 10, stack green on orange_1 using another block. Let's say:

11. pickup white_block_1

12. stack white_block_1 orange_block_1 (orange_1 not clear)

13. pickup green_block_1

14. stack green_block_1 white_block_1 (white_block_1 not clear, green is clear)

But this doesn't satisfy constraint 7, which requires both green and orange_1 to have blocks. Here, orange_1 has white_1, which is clear, and green is on white_1, which is clear. So no.

Alternative idea: stack green on orange_1 and stack another block on green. Let's use white_block_1.

After step 10:

11. pickup green_block_1 (from table)

12. stack green_block_1 orange_block_1 (orange_1 not clear)

13. pickup white_block_1

14. stack white_block_1 green_block_1 (green not clear)

Now, in step 14, both green and orange_1 have blocks on them. So constraint 7 is satisfied.

This adds four steps. But yellow is still on the table, so the goal is met.

So the steps would be:

1. pickup red_block_1

2. stack red_block_1 orange_block_2

3. pickup orange_block_1

4. stack orange_block_1 red_block_1

5. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1

6. putdown yellow_block_1

7. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2

8. putdown green_block_1

9. unstack orange_block_1 red_block_1

10. stack orange_block_1 white_block_2

11. pickup green_block_1

12. stack green_block_1 orange_block_1

13. pickup white_block_1

14. stack white_block_1 green_block_1

Now, in step 14, green is not clear (white_block_1 on top), and orange_block_1 is not clear (green on top). So constraint 7 is satisfied. The goal is achieved in step 6, and the remaining steps don't move yellow. So this works.

But the plan is quite long. Is there a shorter way?

Let me think again. Perhaps there's a way to satisfy constraints with fewer steps.

Alternative approach:

To satisfy constraint 5 (red not clear), stack something on red. For example, stack orange_block_1 on red.

Then, to satisfy constraint 4 (when green is not on yellow, which is always true, we need orange_1 on white_2. So stack orange_1 on white_2 after moving green.

But maybe the initial steps can be:

1. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2

2. putdown green_block_1

Now, white_block_2 is clear, satisfying constraint 2's implication when we move yellow.

Then, stack orange_block_1 on white_block_2.

3. pickup orange_block_1

4. stack orange_block_1 white_block_2 (satisfies constraint 4)

Then, stack something on red_block_1 to satisfy constraint 5.

5. pickup green_block_1

6. stack green_block_1 red_block_1 (now red has green, not clear)

Now, proceed to move yellow:

7. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1

8. putdown yellow_block_1 (goal achieved)

But need to check constraints:

Constraint 10: when holding yellow (step 7), prior state (step 6) must have white_block_1 clear or red not on table. In step 6, red has green on top, so red is not on table. So condition satisfied.

Constraint 5: red has green on top. Satisfied.

Constraint 7: need to have both green and orange_1 not clear. In step 4, orange_1 is on white_2, clear. In step 6, green is on red, clear. So both are clear. Not satisfied. So need to stack something on them.

So after step 6:

7. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1

8. putdown yellow_block_1

9. pickup white_block_1

10. stack white_block_1 orange_block_1 (now orange_1 not clear)

11. pickup green_block_1 (from red_block_1)

12. stack green_block_1 white_block_1 (now white_block_1 not clear, green clear)

But this doesn't satisfy constraint 7. Alternatively:

9. pickup green_block_1 (from red_block_1)

10. stack green_block_1 orange_block_1 (orange_1 not clear)

11. pickup white_block_1

12. stack white_block_1 green_block_1 (green not clear)

Now, in step 12, both green and orange_1 are not clear. Satisfies constraint 7.

But this adds steps. So the total steps would be 12.

But this is still longer than the initial approach. Is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, perhaps stack orange_1 on red and then stack something else on orange_1, making both orange_1 and red not clear.

Let me try:

1. pickup orange_block_1

2. stack orange_block_1 red_block_1 (red not clear, orange_1 clear)

3. pickup white_block_1

4. stack white_block_1 orange_block_1 (orange_1 not clear)

Now, red has orange_1, which has white_1. So red is not clear. Constraint 5 satisfied. Also, constraint 7 requires both green and orange_1 to have blocks. But green is still on white_block_2. So we need to stack something on green.

5. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2

6. stack green_block_1 white_block_1 (white_block_1 has green, but green is clear. Doesn't help.)

Alternatively:

5. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2

6. stack green_block_1 orange_block_1 (orange_1 has white_1 and green on top? No, stack green on orange_1 which has white_1. Can't stack unless orange_1 is clear. But after step 4, orange_1 has white_1. So can't stack green on orange_1.

This approach isn't working.

Alternative idea: Use red_block_1 to satisfy multiple constraints.

Original goal is to move yellow to table. Let's see if there's a way to do this while satisfying constraints with minimal steps.

Another approach:

- First, unstack yellow_block_1 and put it down. But this violates constraint 10, as before.

So need to first move red.

Steps:

1. pickup red_block_1

2. stack red_block_1 orange_block_2 (now red not on table)

3. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1

4. putdown yellow_block_1 (goal achieved)

Now, check constraints:

- constraint 2: after moving yellow, white_block_2 must be clear or on green. Initially, white_block_2 has green. So we need to unstack green from white_block_2.

5. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2

6. putdown green_block_1 (now white_block_2 is clear, satisfying constraint 2)

Constraint 4: after moving green, need to stack orange_block_1 on white_block_2.

7. pickup orange_block_1

8. stack orange_block_1 white_block_2

Constraint 5: red must have a block on top. Currently, red is on orange_block_2 and clear. So need to stack something on red.

9. pickup green_block_1

10. stack green_block_1 red_block_1 (red now has green, not clear)

Constraint 7: both green and orange_1 have blocks on top. Currently, green is on red (clear), and orange_1 is on white_block_2 (clear). So need to stack on both.

11. pickup white_block_1

12. stack white_block_1 green_block_1 (green not clear)

13. pickup white_block_2 (but it's under orange_block_1. Can't pickup.)

Alternatively, stack something else on orange_1.

14. pickup yellow_block_1 (on table)

15. stack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1 (orange_1 not clear)

But this moves yellow, which is part of the goal. So after step 15, yellow is not on table. So invalid.

Alternative: Use white_block_1 to stack on orange_1.

11. pickup white_block_1

12. stack white_block_1 orange_block_1 (orange_1 not clear)

Now, constraint 7 is satisfied: green has white_block_1 on top (after step 12?), no. Wait, green is on red. So after step 10, green is on red. Stacking white_block_1 on orange_1 would make orange_1 not clear, and green on red is clear. So not satisfying constraint 7.

Hmm. This is getting too complicated. Perhaps the initial longer plan is necessary.

But the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). So perhaps there's a way to find a shorter plan.

Let me try to outline a possible optimal plan step by step, considering all constraints:

The main goal is to move yellow to the table. To do that, we need to unstack it from white_block_1. But before that, we must satisfy constraint 10: when holding yellow, there must be a prior state where white_block_1 is clear or red is not on table. Since white_block_1 has yellow, it's not clear. So red must not be on table. So first step: move red.

Step 1: pickup red_block_1

Step 2: stack red_block_1 orange_block_2 (red not on table)

Now, unstack yellow:

Step 3: unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1

Step 4: putdown yellow_block_1 (goal achieved)

Now, check constraints:

- constraint 2: after step 3, yellow not on white_1. So white_block_2 must be clear or on green. Currently, white_block_2 has green. So need to make it clear.

Step 5: unstack green_block_1 white_block_2

Step 6: putdown green_block_1 (white_block_2 is clear)

- constraint 4: after moving green, need to stack orange_block_1 on white_block_2.

Step 7: pickup orange_block_1

Step 8: stack orange_block_1 white_block_2

- constraint 5: red must have a block on top. Currently, red is on orange_block_2 and clear. So stack something on red.

Step 9: pickup green_block_1

Step 10: stack green_block_1 red_block_1 (red not clear)

- constraint 7: need both green and orange_1 to have blocks on top. Currently, green is on red (clear), and orange_1 is on white_block_2 (clear). So stack something on each.

Step 11: pickup white_block_1

Step 12: stack white_block_1 green_block_1 (green not clear)

Step 13: pickup white_block_2 (can't, because it's under orange_block_1. So use another block.)

Alternatively, stack something on orange_block_1:

Step 11: pickup white_block_1

Step 12: stack white_block_1 orange_block_1 (orange_block_1 not clear)

Now, in step 12, green is on red (clear?), no. After step 10, green is on red, and after step 12, white_block_1 is on orange_block_1. So green is clear, orange_block_1 not clear. So only orange_block_1 has a block on top. Need to also stack on green.

Step 13: pickup green_block_1 (from red_block_1)

Step 14: stack green_block_1 white_block_1 (white_block_1 not clear)

Now, both green and orange_block_1 have blocks on top. So constraint 7 is satisfied.

But this adds many steps. The total steps are 14. But maybe there's a way to combine some steps.

Wait, after step 8: orange_block_1 is on white_block_2, clear. After step 10: green is on red, clear. So to satisfy constraint 7, we need to stack on both. So steps 11 and 12 can be:

11. pickup white_block_1

12. stack white_block_1 orange_block_1 (orange not clear)

13. pickup green_block_1

14. stack green_block_1 white_block_1 (green not clear)

Now, in step 14, green is on white_block_1 (which is on orange_block_1), so green is clear. So this doesn't work. Wait, when you stack x on y, x is clear. So in step 14, green is on white_block_1, so green is clear. So not helpful.

Alternative: After step 10, stack white_block_1 on green_block_1.

11. pickup white_block_1

12. stack white_block_1 green_block_1 (green not clear)

Now, green is not clear, and orange_block_1 is on white_block_2 (clear). So only green is not clear. Not enough.

So, I think the minimal plan requires at least 14 steps. However, maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternative Idea: Use orange_block_2 for stacking. For example, after step 2, red is on orange_block_2. Then, stack orange_block_2 on red_block_1. Wait, but orange_block_2 is on the table with red on top. To stack orange_block_2 on red, we need to unstack red first.

But this is getting too complicated. Perhaps the initial approach is the way to go.

Final Answer:
The optimal plan must satisfy all constraints with the fewest steps. After careful consideration, the steps are as follows:

1. Unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1 (requires red not on table, achieved by first moving red)
2. Put down yellow_block_1 (goal)
3. Handle constraints by moving green, stacking orange on white_block_2, stacking on red, and ensuring both green and orange have blocks on top.

But to meet all constraints, the steps must be:

```
pickup red_block_1
stack red_block_1 orange_block_2
unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
putdown yellow_block_1
unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
putdown green_block_1
pickup orange_block_1
stack orange_block_1 white_block_2
pickup green_block_1
stack green_block_1 red_block_1
pickup white_block_1
stack white_block_1 orange_block_1
pickup white_block_1
stack white_block_1 green_block_1
```

Wait, no. Let me check again.

The correct sequence that meets all constraints and the goal with the fewest steps is:

```
pickup red_block_1
stack red_block_1 orange_block_2
unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
putdown yellow_block_1
unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
putdown green_block_1
pickup orange_block_1
stack orange_block_1 white_block_2
pickup green_block_1
stack green_block_1 red_block_1
pickup white_block_1
stack white_block_1 orange_block_1
pickup white_block_1
stack white_block_1 green_block_1
```

But this results in yellow being on the table, and all constraints satisfied. However, some steps might be redundant. After careful analysis, the minimal steps are:

```
pickup red_block_1
stack red_block_1 orange_block_2
unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
putdown yellow_block_1
unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
stack green_block_1 red_block_1
pickup orange_block_1
stack orange_block_1 white_block_2
pickup white_block_1
stack white_block_1 orange_block_1
```

This has 10 steps. Checking constraints:

- Constraint 5: red has green on top.
- Constraint 7: orange_block_1 has white_block_1 on top (not clear), green_block_1 has nothing (since stacked on red, so green is clear). Not meeting both. So this plan is invalid.

Therefore, the correct optimal plan with all constraints satisfied is as follows:
