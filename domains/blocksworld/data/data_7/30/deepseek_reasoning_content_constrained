Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld problem. First, I need to understand the initial state and the goal. The goal is to have yellow_block_1 on the table. The initial state has yellow_block_1 under blue_block_1, which is on top of red_block_1. So, to get yellow_block_1 on the table, I need to unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1, then unstack yellow_block_1 from red_block_1 and put it down. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy here. Let me go through each constraint one by one.

First constraint: The robot must be holding yellow_block_1 at least once. That's straightforward since moving yellow_block_1 requires picking it up. But I need to ensure that when I do that, there's an earlier state where blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_2 or purple_block_1. Hmm, blue_block_1 is initially on yellow_block_1. So maybe during the process, I need to move blue_block_1 to one of those blocks. Let me note that.

Second constraint: If holding yellow_block_1, then earlier there must be blue_block_1 on white_block_2 or purple_block_1. So before picking up yellow_block_1, blue_block_1 must have been placed on either of those two. So I need to move blue_block_1 to one of those blocks before handling yellow_block_1.

Third constraint: blue_block_1 must never be on the table in any state. So whenever blue_block_1 is moved, it has to be stacked on another block, not put down. That complicates things because normally, to unstack it, you'd have to put it down. Wait, but the unstack action picks up blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1, which would require holding it. Then, to move it elsewhere, I have to stack it on another block. So after unstacking blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1, I can't put it down; I must stack it on white_block_2 or purple_block_1. Let's see the initial state: white_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1, which is on white_block_1. Both white_block_2 and purple_block_1 have blocks on them. Wait, white_block_2 is clear initially. Wait, the initial state says white_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1, and there's no block on top of white_block_2. So white_block_2 is clear. So maybe stack blue_block_1 on white_block_2. Then, that would satisfy the condition for the second constraint.

Fourth constraint: Must hold white_block_2 at least once. So I need to pick up white_block_2 at some point. But in the initial state, white_block_2 is on purple_block_1. To pick it up, I need to unstack it. But then, unstacking white_block_2 from purple_block_1. But that's part of the tower white_block_2 on purple_block_1 on white_block_1. So maybe moving white_block_2 somewhere else.

Fifth constraint: Must hold blue_block_1 at least once. That's already required since we need to move blue_block_1 off yellow_block_1. So that's covered.

Sixth constraint: If holding blue_block_1, then must hold purple_block_1 at the same state or later. So after picking up blue_block_1, somewhere down the line, I need to pick up purple_block_1. So after moving blue_block_1, perhaps I need to handle purple_block_1, maybe by unstacking it from white_block_1.

Seventh constraint: white_block_2 is not on the table in at least one state. Since initially, white_block_2 is on purple_block_1, which is on the table. If we move white_block_2, putting it on another block would satisfy that. But if we put it on the table, then it would be on the table again. Wait, the constraint says "white_block_2 is not on the table" in at least one state. So maybe when we unstack white_block_2 from purple_block_1 and hold it, then white_block_2 is not on the table. But then we might have to stack it somewhere else. Or put it down again. Wait, but if we put it down, then it's back on the table. So perhaps, after unstacking white_block_2, we need to stack it on another block, so that in that state, white_block_2 is not on the table. Then, when we stack it, it's on top of another block, so it's not on the table. So that's one state where it's not on the table.

Eighth constraint: If white_block_2 is not on the table in some state s, then in s or after, either purple_block_1 is on yellow_block_1 or red_block_1 is not clear. So after moving white_block_2, we need to make sure that either purple_block_1 is on yellow_block_1 (which is on red_block_1) or red_block_1 has a block on top. But red_block_1 initially has yellow_block_1, which has blue_block_1. So maybe after moving blue_block_1, if we put something else on red_block_1, but the goal is to have yellow_block_1 on the table. So maybe after moving blue_block_1 and yellow_block_1, red_block_1 is clear. But the constraint requires that if white_block_2 is not on the table (like when we stack it somewhere), then either purple_block_1 is on yellow_block_1 (but yellow_block_1 is supposed to be on the table eventually) or red_block_1 has a block on top. Hmm, perhaps after moving white_block_2, we need to stack something on red_block_1. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe stack purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1. But yellow_block_1 is on red_block_1, so stacking purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1 would make yellow_block_1 not clear, but once we unstack yellow_block_1, that block would be moved. This is getting complicated.

Ninth constraint: white_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1 in at least one state. Initially, white_block_1 is on the table, with purple_block_1 on it. So white_block_1 is under purple_block_1. So white_block_1 is not on blue_block_1. So the initial state already satisfies "white_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1". But maybe after some moves, if someone stacks white_block_1 on blue_block_1, then later removes it. Wait, but the constraint says that in at least one state, this is true. Since it's already true in the initial state, maybe this constraint is already satisfied. But perhaps the problem wants it to be true in some state during the plan. But the initial state is part of the states, so maybe this is already met. But I need to check if that's allowed. The constraint says "must hold in at least one state", which could include the initial state. So perhaps no action is needed here. But maybe during the plan, some action might cause white_block_1 to be on blue_block_1, but we need to make sure that in at least one state, it's not. Since the initial state already has that, maybe this constraint is already satisfied. But I need to be careful.

Tenth constraint: If in some state s, white_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1, then in s or after, either white_block_1 is not on the table or purple_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1. Since in the initial state, white_block_1 is on the table, and purple_block_1 is on top of it. So in the initial state, the condition holds (white_block_1 not on blue_block_1), so we need that either white_block_1 is not on the table or purple_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1. In the initial state, both are false (white_block_1 is on the table, and purple_block_1 is on it). So this would violate the constraint. Wait, wait: the constraint is an implication. If in state s, "white_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1" holds, then in s or after, either white_block_1 is not on the table or purple_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1. So in the initial state, since "white_block_1 is not on blue_block_1" is true, then either white_block_1 is not on the table or purple_block_1 is not on it must hold in s or after. But in the initial state, both are false. So the initial state would violate this constraint. Therefore, the plan must include steps that, after the initial state, ensure that whenever "white_block_1 is not on blue_block_1" is true, then either white_block_1 is not on the table or purple_block_1 is not on it. But the initial state is a problem here. Wait, the problem states the original state of the world, and the constraints must hold in all states. Wait, no: the constraints are for the plan. Let me check the problem statement again.

Wait, the constraints are part of the problem that the plan must satisfy. So the constraints apply to the sequence of states generated by the plan. The initial state is part of that sequence. So the tenth constraint says: if in any state s in the plan's execution, "white_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1" holds, then in s or a subsequent state, either white_block_1 is not on the table or purple_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1. The initial state s0 has "white_block_1 is not on blue_block_1" true. Therefore, in s0 or later, either white_block_1 is not on the table or purple_block_1 is not on it. But in s0, white_block_1 is on the table, and purple_block_1 is on it. So this violates the constraint. Therefore, the initial state itself is a problem unless we modify it. Wait, but the initial state is given. So this suggests that the plan must include actions that change the state such that whenever "white_block_1 is not on blue_block_1" holds, the required condition is met. So in the initial state, since "white_block_1 is not on blue_block_1" is true, we must have that in s0 or a subsequent state, either white_block_1 is not on the table or purple_block_1 is not on it. But since s0 is the starting point, the plan must include actions that, after s0, make sure that either white_block_1 is moved from the table or purple_block_1 is moved from white_block_1. Therefore, the plan must involve moving either white_block_1 or purple_block_1 to satisfy this constraint. For example, if we move purple_block_1 off white_block_1, then in that state, purple_block_1 is not on white_block_1, which would satisfy the condition. Alternatively, moving white_block_1 off the table. But white_block_1 is on the table, so to move it, we need to pick it up, but there's purple_block_1 on it. So first, we need to unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1. Then, perhaps stack it elsewhere.

This is getting quite involved. Let's try to outline a possible plan step by step, considering all constraints.

The main goal is to get yellow_block_1 on the table. Let's see the initial stack involving yellow_block_1:

red_block_1 (on table) has yellow_block_1, which has blue_block_1. So to get yellow_block_1 on the table, I need to unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1, then unstack yellow_block_1 from red_block_1 and put it down. But blue_block_1 can't be put on the table (third constraint), so after unstacking blue_block_1, I need to stack it on another block. The second constraint requires that before picking up yellow_block_1, blue_block_1 must be on white_block_2 or purple_block_1. So perhaps stack blue_block_1 on white_block_2. Then, after that, unstack yellow_block_1 from red_block_1 and put it down.

But before that, to unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1, the robotic arm needs to be free. Let's start:

1. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1: This action requires that blue_block_1 is clear (which it is), and the arm is not holding anything. After this, the arm is holding blue_block_1, yellow_block_1 is clear.

But then, we need to stack blue_block_1 on either white_block_2 or purple_block_1. Let's choose white_block_2. So:

2. stack blue_block_1 white_block_2: Now, blue_block_1 is on white_block_2. This satisfies the second constraint's condition because when we later hold yellow_block_1, there was an earlier state (this one) where blue_block_1 is on white_block_2.

Now, yellow_block_1 is clear. So we can unstack it from red_block_1:

3. unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_1: Now holding yellow_block_1.

4. putdown yellow_block_1: Now yellow_block_1 is on the table. This achieves the goal.

But wait, we need to check the constraints. Let's check each one:

- Constraint 1: "you are holding yellow_block_1" must be true in at least one state. Step 3 does that. Check.

- Constraint 2: If holding yellow_block_1 (step 3), there must be an earlier state where blue_block_1 is on white_block_2 or purple_block_1. Step 2 does that. Check.

- Constraint 3: blue_block_1 is never on the table. In step 2, it's stacked on white_block_2. So check.

- Constraint 4: Must hold white_block_2 at least once. In the current plan, white_block_2 is only being stacked upon. So we haven't picked it up. So this constraint isn't met. So we need to adjust the plan to include holding white_block_2.

So how can we hold white_block_2? Initially, white_block_2 is on purple_block_1. To pick it up, we need to unstack it. So perhaps:

After step 2 (stack blue_block_1 on white_block_2), white_block_2 now has blue_block_1 on top. So white_block_2 is not clear. Therefore, we can't unstack white_block_2 from purple_block_1 unless we first remove blue_block_1. But that complicates things. Alternatively, maybe we should stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_1 instead. Let's see.

Alternative approach:

1. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1.

2. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1. Now blue_block_1 is on purple_block_1. This satisfies the second constraint's condition (blue_block_1 on purple_block_1). Then, when we hold yellow_block_1 later, this earlier state meets the requirement.

Now, after stacking blue_block_1 on purple_block_1, purple_block_1 is under blue_block_1. Then, to hold white_block_2 (constraint 4), we need to unstack white_block_2 from purple_block_1. But purple_block_1 now has blue_block_1 on it. So white_block_2 is under purple_block_1. Wait, no. Initially, the stack is white_block_2 on purple_block_1 on white_block_1. If I stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_1, then purple_block_1 is under blue_block_1. But white_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1. So after stacking blue_block_1 on purple_block_1, the block purple_block_1 has white_block_2 and blue_block_1 on it? No, that's not possible. Wait, no. Each block can have only one block on top. So initially, purple_block_1 has white_block_2 on it. If we stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_1, that would require that purple_block_1 is clear. But initially, white_block_2 is on purple_block_1. So purple_block_1 is not clear. Therefore, we can't stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_1 unless we first remove white_block_2. So perhaps the initial plan to stack blue_block_1 on white_block_2 was better.

So back to the initial steps:

1. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1.

2. stack blue_block_1 white_block_2.

Now, white_block_2 has blue_block_1 on top, making white_block_2 not clear. To pick up white_block_2 (to satisfy constraint 4), we need to unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_2 first. So:

3. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_2.

Now holding blue_block_1. Then, to hold white_block_2, we need to unstack it from purple_block_1. But white_block_2 was originally on purple_block_1. After step 2, white_block_2 is still under blue_block_1. Wait, no. After step 2, blue_block_1 is stacked on white_block_2, which is on purple_block_1. So white_block_2 has blue_block_1 on it. So to unstack white_block_2 from purple_block_1, we need to have white_block_2 clear. But it's not clear because of blue_block_1. So we need to remove blue_block_1 first. So step 3: unstack blue_block_1 white_block_2 (now holding blue_block_1). Then, stack it somewhere else. But we can't put it on the table (constraint 3). So perhaps stack it on another block. Let's say stack it on grey_block_1, which is on the table and clear.

4. stack blue_block_1 grey_block_1.

Now, blue_block_1 is on grey_block_1. Now, white_block_2 is clear (since we removed blue_block_1). Now, we can unstack white_block_2 from purple_block_1.

5. unstack white_block_2 purple_block_1.

Now holding white_block_2. This satisfies constraint 4. Then, we need to put it somewhere. Maybe stack it on another block. Let's stack it on red_block_1, which currently has yellow_block_1 (after step 1, yellow_block_1 is clear). Wait, after step 1, yellow_block_1 is on red_block_1 and clear. So we could stack white_block_2 on yellow_block_1. But then, when we need to put yellow_block_1 on the table, we'd have to unstack it from under white_block_2. Alternatively, stack white_block_2 somewhere else.

But let's proceed. After step 5, we're holding white_block_2. Let's put it down temporarily (but that would put it on the table, which satisfies constraint 7 (at least one state where it's not on the table, which is when we unstack it in step 5, but then when we put it down, it's back on the table. Hmm, this might not satisfy constraint 7. Constraint 7 says that in at least one state, white_block_2 is not on the table. When we unstack it in step 5, it's not on the table (it's in the air, being held). Then, when we put it down, it's on the table again. So the state during step 5 (after unstacking) satisfies white_block_2 not on the table. So that's one state. But when we put it down, it's back. So that's okay. So constraint 7 is satisfied.

But also, constraint 8: if in some state s, white_block_2 is not on the table, then in s or after, either purple_block_1 is on yellow_block_1 or red_block_1 is not clear. So when we unstack white_block_2 (step 5), white_block_2 is not on the table. In that state s (after step 5), we need that either purple_block_1 is on yellow_block_1 or red_block_1 is not clear. But purple_block_1 is on white_block_1, and red_block_1 has yellow_block_1 (which is clear after step 1). So red_block_1 is not clear (since yellow_block_1 is on it). Wait, red_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on it. So red_block_1 is not clear. Therefore, in state s (after step 5), the condition "red_block_1 is not clear" is true, which satisfies constraint 8. So that's okay.

So after step 5, we can proceed to stack white_block_2 somewhere. Let's say we put it down:

6. putdown white_block_2.

Now, white_block_2 is on the table. But we needed to hold it, which we did in step 5. Now, back to handling yellow_block_1. After step 1, yellow_block_1 is on red_block_1 and clear. So we can unstack it:

7. unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_1.

Now holding yellow_block_1. Then put it down:

8. putdown yellow_block_1.

This achieves the goal. Now, check constraints:

- Constraint 6: If holding blue_block_1 (steps 3 and 4), then in that state or later, hold purple_block_1. In step 3, we are holding blue_block_1. We need to hold purple_block_1 at some point after. So after step 3, we stack blue_block_1 on grey_block_1 (step 4), then unstack white_block_2 (step 5), and then in step 5, we're holding white_block_2, not purple_block_1. So this violates constraint 6. Because when we held blue_block_1 in step 3, we need to hold purple_block_1 at some point after. So the plan needs to include holding purple_block_1 after step 3.

So to fix this, after step 4 (stacking blue_block_1 on grey_block_1), perhaps unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1. But purple_block_1 is under white_block_2. Wait, initial structure: white_block_2 is on purple_block_1, which is on white_block_1. After step 5, we unstacked white_block_2 from purple_block_1, so now purple_block_1 is clear (since white_block_2 was removed). So after step 5, purple_block_1 is on white_block_1 and clear. So we can unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1:

6. unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1.

But after step 5, the arm is holding white_block_2. So need to put that down first. So after step 5:

6. putdown white_block_2.

7. unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1.

Now holding purple_block_1. This satisfies constraint 6, as after holding blue_block_1 (step 3), we hold purple_block_1 in step 7. Now, we need to stack purple_block_1 somewhere. Let's stack it on yellow_block_1, which is on red_block_1 (before step 7, yellow_block_1 is still on red_block_1). Wait, but in step 7, we unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1. Then, after putting down white_block_2, we unstack purple_block_1. Then, we can stack purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1:

8. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1.

Now, purple_block_1 is on yellow_block_1, making yellow_block_1 not clear. So to unstack yellow_block_1 from red_block_1, we need to first unstack purple_block_1. But this complicates things. Alternatively, maybe we can put purple_block_1 somewhere else. Let's see:

After step 7, holding purple_block_1. Let's put it down:

8. putdown purple_block_1.

But that would place it on the table, which is allowed. Then, we can proceed to handle yellow_block_1:

9. unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_1.

10. putdown yellow_block_1.

But this adds steps. However, this way, after holding blue_block_1 (step 3), we later hold purple_block_1 (step 7), satisfying constraint 6.

So updating the plan:

1. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1.

2. stack blue_block_1 white_block_2.

3. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_2.

4. stack blue_block_1 grey_block_1.

5. unstack white_block_2 purple_block_1.

6. putdown white_block_2.

7. unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1.

8. putdown purple_block_1.

9. unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_1.

10. putdown yellow_block_1.

Now, checking constraint 6: When we held blue_block_1 in steps 3 and 4, after that, we held purple_block_1 in step 7. So that's satisfied.

Now, let's check other constraints:

- Constraint 9: white_block_1 is not on blue_block_1 in at least one state. In the initial state, this is true. So that's satisfied.

- Constraint 10: Whenever white_block_1 is not on blue_block_1 (which is always, since they're never stacked that way), then in that state or after, either white_block_1 is not on the table or purple_block_1 is not on it. In step 7, we unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1. So after step 7, purple_block_1 is not on white_block_1. Therefore, in all states after step 7, purple_block_1 is not on white_block_1. So for the initial state, which is before step 7, we have white_block_1 on the table and purple_block_1 on it. But the constraint requires that in s0 (the initial state), either white_block_1 is not on the table or purple_block_1 is not on it. But in s0, both are true. So this violates the constraint. So the plan must ensure that after s0, whenever the condition holds, the required condition is met. Since the initial state violates the implication, the plan must include steps that make sure that either white_block_1 is moved from the table or purple_block_1 is moved off it. In our current plan, step 7 unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1, which makes purple_block_1 not on white_block_1. Therefore, after step 7, in all subsequent states, purple_block_1 is not on white_block_1. So the initial state s0 is a problem because it violates the implication. Therefore, the plan must include an action that, after s0, modifies the state such that the implication holds. Since we can't change the initial state, we must ensure that during the plan execution, the conditions are met.

Wait, the constraint is an implication: if in any state s in the plan's execution, "white_block_1 is not on blue_block_1" is true, then in s or a subsequent state, either white_block_1 is not on the table or purple_block_1 is not on it. The initial state s0 has "white_block_1 is not on blue_block_1" true, so the plan must ensure that in s0 or later, either white_block_1 is not on the table or purple_block_1 is not on it. The plan does this by step 7, where purple_block_1 is moved off white_block_1. Therefore, after step 7, purple_block_1 is not on white_block_1, satisfying the consequent. Therefore, in s0, the antecedent is true, but the consequent becomes true in a later state (step 7). Therefore, the constraint is satisfied because the implication requires that if the antecedent is true in s, then the consequent is true in s or a later state. Since in s0, the antecedent is true, but the consequent becomes true in step 7, which is after s0, the implication holds. So the plan satisfies this constraint.

Now, let's check constraint 10 again. For every state where "white_block_1 is not on blue_block_1" holds (which is every state), the consequent must hold in that state or later. Since in step 7, we remove purple_block_1 from white_block_1, from step 7 onward, the consequent is true (purple_block_1 is not on white_block_1). For states before step 7, like s0 to step 6, the consequent is not true in those states, but the plan ensures that there is a later state (step 7) where it becomes true. Therefore, for each state s from s0 to step 6, the implication is satisfied because even though the consequent is false in s, it becomes true in a later state. Therefore, the constraint is satisfied.

Now, checking all constraints again:

1. Hold yellow_block_1: step 9. Check.

2. Before step 9, blue_block_1 was on white_block_2 in step 2. Check.

3. blue_block_1 never on table: steps 1, 2, 3, 4. Check.

4. Hold white_block_2: step 5. Check.

5. Hold blue_block_1: steps 1,3. Check.

6. After holding blue_block_1 (steps 1,3), hold purple_block_1 in step 7. Check.

7. white_block_2 not on table in step 5. Check.

8. When white_block_2 is not on table (step 5), in that state, red_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on it, so red_block_1 is not clear. Check.

9. white_block_1 not on blue_block_1 in some state (always true). Check.

10. For each state where white_block_1 not on blue_block_1 (all), in s or later, either white_block_1 not on table or purple_block_1 not on it. Achieved by step 7. Check.

Now, let's check the tenth constraint again. For every state in the plan where "white_block_1 is not on blue_block_1" (which is all states), either white_block_1 is not on the table or purple_block_1 is not on it in that state or later. Since step 7 moves purple_block_1 off white_block_1, from step 7 onward, purple_block_1 is not on white_block_1. Therefore, for all states up to step 6, the consequent is not true, but in step 7, it becomes true. So for each state before step 7, the implication is satisfied because there's a later state where the consequent is true.

Finally, let's check constraint 9: "white_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1" must hold in at least one state. As this is always true in the initial state and throughout, it's satisfied.

Now, the plan steps are:

1. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1

2. stack blue_block_1 white_block_2

3. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_2

4. stack blue_block_1 grey_block_1

5. unstack white_block_2 purple_block_1

6. putdown white_block_2

7. unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1

8. putdown purple_block_1

9. unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_1

10. putdown yellow_block_1

This gives us 10 steps, but perhaps there's a shorter way. Let's see if we can optimize.

Wait, after step 2, blue_block_1 is on white_block_2. Then, step 3 unstacks it again. Maybe instead of moving blue_block_1 to white_block_2 and then moving it again, can we stack it directly on grey_block_1 after unstacking? Let me see:

Alternative plan:

1. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1

2. stack blue_block_1 grey_block_1

This satisfies constraint 2, because when we later hold yellow_block_1, there was an earlier state (step 2) where blue_block_1 is on grey_block_1. But wait, constraint 2 requires that blue_block_1 is on white_block_2 or purple_block_1. So stacking on grey_block_1 doesn't satisfy this. Therefore, this alternative plan violates constraint 2. Therefore, we have to stack blue_block_1 on white_block_2 or purple_block_1. So the initial approach of stacking on white_block_2 is necessary.

But then, after step 2, blue_block_1 is on white_block_2. To pick up white_block_2 (to satisfy constraint 4), we need to remove blue_block_1. So steps 3 and 4 are necessary. But perhaps there's a way to stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_1 instead, but that's not possible because purple_block_1 has white_block_2 on it. So the initial plan is necessary.

But maybe there's a shorter path. Let's think again.

Goal: get yellow_block_1 on the table. To do that, need to unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1 and stack it somewhere allowed. Then unstack yellow_block_1 and put it down.

Constraints:

- Must hold white_block_2.

- After holding blue_block_1, must hold purple_block_1.

So perhaps:

1. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1

2. stack blue_block_1 white_block_2 (satisfies constraint 2)

3. unstack white_block_2 purple_block_1 (now holding white_block_2, satisfies constraint 4)

4. putdown white_block_2 (but this puts it on the table, but we needed to hold it, which we did in step 3)

5. unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1 (now holding purple_block_1, satisfying constraint 6 after holding blue_block_1 in step 1)

6. stack purple_block_1 somewhere (like grey_block_1)

7. unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_1

8. putdown yellow_block_1

But this would be shorter. Let's check:

Step 1: unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1.

Step 2: stack blue_block_1 white_block_2.

Now, blue_block_1 is on white_block_2, satisfying constraint 2.

Step 3: unstack white_block_2 purple_block_1. But white_block_2 has blue_block_1 on it, so it's not clear. Can't unstack. So this is invalid. Therefore, we need to first unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_2.

So step 3: unstack blue_block_1 white_block_2.

Step 4: stack blue_block_1 grey_block_1.

Now, white_block_2 is clear.

Step 5: unstack white_block_2 purple_block_1.

Step 6: putdown white_block_2.

Step 7: unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1.

Step 8: stack purple_block_1 somewhere.

Step 9: unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_1.

Step 10: putdown yellow_block_1.

This is the same as before. So it seems we can't avoid those steps.

Another possible optimization: instead of putting down white_block_2 after unstacking, perhaps stack it on another block. For example, after step 5 (holding white_block_2), stack it on red_block_1. But red_block_1 has yellow_block_1, which is clear. So stack white_block_2 on yellow_block_1.

Step 5: unstack white_block_2 purple_block_1.

Step 6: stack white_block_2 yellow_block_1.

This way, white_block_2 is not on the table (satisfies constraint 7), and we don't need to put it down. Then, when we need to unstack yellow_block_1, we first unstack white_block_2 from it.

But this adds steps. Let's see:

1. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1.

2. stack blue_block_1 white_block_2.

3. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_2.

4. stack blue_block_1 grey_block_1.

5. unstack white_block_2 purple_block_1.

6. stack white_block_2 yellow_block_1.

Now, yellow_block_1 has white_block_2 on top. To unstack yellow_block_1 from red_block_1, we need to unstack white_block_2 first.

7. unstack white_block_2 yellow_block_1.

8. putdown white_block_2.

9. unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_1.

10. putdown yellow_block_1.

Additionally, we need to handle purple_block_1:

After step 5, purple_block_1 is clear. So step 7: unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1.

But after step 5, the arm is holding white_block_2. So need to stack it first.

This seems to add more steps. So perhaps the initial plan is still the shortest.

Another approach: After step 2 (stack blue_block_1 on white_block_2), instead of unstacking blue_block_1, can we use another block to satisfy the holding purple_block_1 constraint? For example, after stacking blue_block_1 on white_block_2, unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1. But purple_block_1 has white_block_2 on it, which now has blue_block_1. So to unstack purple_block_1, we need to clear it. Which means we need to unstack white_block_2 and blue_block_1 first. So this would require more steps.

Therefore, the initial plan of 10 steps seems necessary. But perhaps there's a shorter way.

Wait, let's count again:

Original plan steps:

1. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1

2. stack blue_block_1 white_block_2

3. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_2

4. stack blue_block_1 grey_block_1

5. unstack white_block_2 purple_block_1

6. putdown white_block_2

7. unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1

8. putdown purple_block_1

9. unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_1

10. putdown yellow_block_1

This is 10 steps. Is there a way to reduce this?

After step 2, blue_block_1 is on white_block_2. To unstack white_block_2, we need to remove blue_block_1. So steps 3 and 4 are necessary. Then, unstack white_block_2 (step 5). Put it down (step 6). Unstack purple_block_1 (step 7). Put it down (step 8). Then unstack yellow_block_1 and putdown.

But maybe after step 7, instead of putting down purple_block_1, we can stack it on another block. For example, stack purple_block_1 on red_block_1 (which has yellow_block_1). So:

7. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1.

Then, to unstack yellow_block_1, we need to unstack purple_block_1 first. But that adds steps. So steps would be:

1. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1

2. stack blue_block_1 white_block_2

3. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_2

4. stack blue_block_1 grey_block_1

5. unstack white_block_2 purple_block_1

6. putdown white_block_2

7. unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1

8. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1

9. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1

10. unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_1

11. putdown yellow_block_1

This is longer. So not better.

Alternative idea: After step 5 (holding white_block_2), instead of putting it down, stack it on purple_block_1 again. But that would require purple_block_1 to be clear. But after step 5, purple_block_1 is clear. So:

6. stack white_block_2 purple_block_1.

Then, white_block_2 is back where it was, but now the arm is free. Then, unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1 (since it's clear now). So:

7. unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1.

8. stack purple_block_1 somewhere.

But this doesn't help much. 

Another angle: To satisfy constraint 6 (after holding blue_block_1, hold purple_block_1), perhaps after stacking blue_block_1 on white_block_2 (step 2), we can unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1. But purple_block_1 has white_block_2 on it, which has blue_block_1. So need to unstack blue_block_1 and white_block_2 first. So steps:

1. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1

2. stack blue_block_1 white_block_2

3. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_2

4. stack blue_block_1 grey_block_1

5. unstack white_block_2 purple_block_1

6. stack white_block_2 purple_block_1 (but why?)

This isn't helpful.

Alternatively, after step 2, unstack white_block_2 from purple_block_1. But white_block_2 has blue_block_1 on it, so can't. So steps 3 and 4 are necessary.

It seems the initial plan is the shortest possible given the constraints. Therefore, the optimal plan would be the 10 steps outlined.
