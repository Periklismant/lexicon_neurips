Let's break down the problem:

**Initial State:**
1. grey_block_1 is on the table and clear.
2. white_block_1 is on the table.
3. purple_block_1 is on top of white_block_1.
4. white_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1.
5. red_block_1 is on the table.
6. yellow_block_1 is on top of red_block_1.
7. blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1.
8. white_block_2 is clear.
9. blue_block_1 is clear.
10. You're not holding any block.

So we have these configurations initially:
- On the table: grey_block_1, white_block_1, red_block_1
- white_block_1 -> purple_block_1 -> white_block_2
- red_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 -> blue_block_1
(where "A -> B" means "B is on top of A")

**Goal State:**
- yellow_block_1 is on the table.

**Constraints:**
1. "You are holding yellow_block_1" must be true in at least one state.
2. Before holding yellow_block_1, either "blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_2" or "blue_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1" must be true.
3. blue_block_1 is never on the table.
4. "You are holding white_block_2" must be true in at least one state.
5. "You are holding blue_block_1" must be true in at least one state.
6. After holding blue_block_1, "You are holding purple_block_1" must be true.
7. "white_block_2 is not on the table" must be true in at least one state.
8. After "white_block_2 is not on the table" is true, either "purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1" or "There is a block on top of red_block_1" must be true.
9. "white_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1" must be true in at least one state.
10. After "white_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1" is true, either "white_block_1 is not on the table" or "purple_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" must be true.
11. At some point, white_block_1 is clear AND white_block_2 is not clear.

Let's see... first, note that constraint 9 is trivially satisfied in the initial state since white_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1. And from the initial state, "white_block_1 is on the table" and "purple_block_1 is on top of white_block_1", so constraint 10 is not fulfilled yet (although we don't need to fulfill it until state s or afterwards).  However, recall that white_block_1 is on the table, and purple_block_1 is on top of it, and white_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1. So actually the constraint is already satisfied (since "white_block_1 is on the table" is true in the initial state, so "white_block_1 is not on the table" is false, making constraint 10 not satisfied. Actually, wait. The constraint is "If white_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1, then white_block_1 is not on the table OR purple_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1." In this case, "white_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1" is true, because initially white_block_1 is on the table. So either "white_block_1 is not on the table" or "purple_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" must be true, but both of these are false. So we'll need to change one of these.

First, let's think about the "simplest" way to reach the goal. Initially, blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, which is on top of red_block_1. To get yellow_block_1 on the table, we need to first remove blue_block_1, then we can pick up yellow_block_1 and put it on the table.

But there are constraints to consider:
- Before holding yellow_block_1, blue_block_1 needs to be on top of white_block_2 or purple_block_1.
- blue_block_1 should never be on the table.
- After holding blue_block_1, we need to hold purple_block_1.
- white_block_2 should not be on the table, and after this is true, either purple_block_1 should be on top of yellow_block_1, or red_block_1 should have a block on top (not be clear). But at the beginning, white_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1, which is on top of white_block_1. So white_block_2 is not on the table, which means one of the conditions should be met. Is red_block_1 not clear? Initially, red_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on top of it, so it's not clear. This constraint is satisfied.
- white_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1. Initially, white_block_1 is on the table. The condition says if white_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1, then either white_block_1 is not on the table OR purple_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1. But white_block_1 is on the table, and purple_block_1 is on top of white_block_1. So, this constraint requires attention. But after thinking, this constraint doesn't require attention, since the initial state already satisfies "white_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1", so we need the "then" part of the constraint to be satisfied. But the "then" part is: white_block_1 is not on the table or purple_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1. And initially, neither is true, so we need to fulfill one of these.
- At some point, white_block_1 needs to be clear AND white_block_2 should not be clear.

Given all these constraints, let's try to form a plan:

1. We need to make "blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_2 or purple_block_1" true before picking up yellow_block_1.
2. We also need to pick up blue_block_1 and then pick up purple_block_1.
3. blue_block_1 should never be on the table.
4. white_block_1 needs to be clear, and white_block_2 should not be clear.
5. The ultimate goal is to get yellow_block_1 on the table.

Let's start with the current state and work towards the goal step by step.

OK, so here's the plan:

1. Since blue_block_1 is initially on top of yellow_block_1, we need to move it to white_block_2 or purple_block_1 before picking up yellow_block_1.
2. unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1
3. Now we can either stack blue_block_1 on white_block_2 OR on purple_block_1. If we stack it on purple_block_1, we'd need to first unstack white_block_2 from purple_block_1. If we stack it on white_block_2, then white_block_2 would not be clear, which aligns with the constraint "white_block_1 is clear and white_block_2 is not clear". So, let's stack blue_block_1 on white_block_2.
4. stack blue_block_1 on white_block_2
5. Now, the constraint "white_block_1 is clear and white_block_2 is not clear" is still not met because white_block_1 is not clear (purple_block_1 is on top of it). So, we need to unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1.
6. unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1
7. Now we can pick up yellow_block_1.
8. unstack yellow_block_1 from red_block_1
9. Put yellow_block_1 on the table.
10. putdown yellow_block_1

But we missed some constraints:
- We need to hold white_block_2 at some point.
- After holding blue_block_1, we need to hold purple_block_1.
- We need to satisfy the constraint regarding white_block_1 not being on top of blue_block_1, which means we need to make white_block_1 not on the table or purple_block_1 not on top of white_block_1. We're already doing the latter, so that's fine.

Let's revise:

1. unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1
2. We need to put blue_block_1 somewhere temporarily, but it can't be on the table due to the constraint. Let's put it on grey_block_1.
3. stack blue_block_1 on grey_block_1
4. Now we need to pick up white_block_2 at some point, so let's do that.
5. unstack white_block_2 from purple_block_1
6. We also need to pick up purple_block_1 at some point, but only after holding blue_block_1. We'll get to that shortly. For now, let's place white_block_2 down.
7. putdown white_block_2
8. Now, we need to unstack purple_block_1 to fulfill the constraint about white_block_1 being clear.
9. unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1
10. Let's put purple_block_1 on white_block_2 to fulfill the constraint "white_block_1 is clear and white_block_2 is not clear".
11. stack purple_block_1 on white_block_2
12. Now, we need to pick up blue_block_1 again, followed by holding purple_block_1.
13. unstack blue_block_1 from grey_block_1
14. Let's stack blue_block_1 on white_block_1 (it can be anywhere, as long as it's not on the table, and this satisfies "white_block_1 is clear and white_block_2 is not clear").
15. stack blue_block_1 on white_block_1
16. Now, we need to unstack purple_block_1 after having held blue_block_1.
17. unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_2
18. Let's place purple_block_1 down.
19. putdown purple_block_1
20. Now we need to make "blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_2 or purple_block_1" true before picking up yellow_block_1. Let's pick up blue_block_1 and place it on top of purple_block_1.
21. unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1
22. stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_1
23. Now we can pick up yellow_block_1.
24. unstack yellow_block_1 from red_block_1
25. Put yellow_block_1 on the table.
26. putdown yellow_block_1

But this plan seems convoluted. Let's see if there's a way to optimize and make it more direct.

Let's revisit the constraints and see which ones we need to actively focus on:

1. "you are holding yellow_block_1" - Yes, we need to pick up yellow_block_1 at some point.
2. Before holding yellow_block_1, blue_block_1 should be on top of white_block_2 or purple_block_1 - Yes, we need to ensure this.
3. blue_block_1 is never on the table - Yes, we need to ensure this.
4. "you are holding white_block_2" - Yes, we need to pick up white_block_2 at some point.
5. "you are holding blue_block_1" - Yes, we need to pick up blue_block_1 at some point.
6. After holding blue_block_1, "you are holding purple_block_1" - Yes, we need to ensure this order.
7. "white_block_2 is not on the table" - This is already true in the initial state (white_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1).
8. After "white_block_2 is not on the table", either purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1 or red_block_1 is not clear - In the initial state, red_block_1 is not clear (because yellow_block_1 is on top of it), so this is fulfilled.
9. "white_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1" - This is already true in the initial state.
10. After "white_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1", either white_block_1 is not on the table or purple_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 - We need to fulfill one of these. Currently, white_block_1 is on the table, and purple_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, so we need to change one of these during the plan.
11. white_block_1 is clear AND white_block_2 is not clear - We need to ensure this at some point.

Let's redraft the plan:

1. unstack white_block_2 from purple_block_1
2. putdown white_block_2 (Constraint 4: "you are holding white_block_2" is satisfied)
3. unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1 (Constraint 10: Now purple_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1)
4. putdown purple_block_1
5. unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (Constraint 5: "you are holding blue_block_1" is satisfied)
6. stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_1 (Constraint 3: blue_block_1 is not on the table; Also, blue_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1, which is a prerequisite for picking up yellow_block_1)
7. unstack purple_block_1 from the table (Constraint 6: After holding blue_block_1, hold purple_block_1)
8. stack purple_block_1 on white_block_1 (resetting to original configuration, but without white_block_2 on top)
9. Now, white_block_1 is not clear, but there's no constraint saying we need to keep it clear. The constraint says at some point, white_block_1 is clear and white_block_2 is not clear. We fulfilled this when white_block_1 was clear after step 4 and white_block_2 was not clear in step 6 (because blue_block_1 was on top).
10. unstack blue_block_1 from purple_block_1
11. stack blue_block_1 on white_block_2 (Constraint 2: blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_2, which is a prerequisite for picking up yellow_block_1)
12. unstack yellow_block_1 from red_block_1 (Constraint 1: "you are holding yellow_block_1" is satisfied)
13. putdown yellow_block_1 (Goal: yellow_block_1 is on the table)

Wait, I think there's an error in my previous analysis for constraint 10. Let's revisit:
Constraint 10: "If white_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1 holds in some state s, then white_block_1 is not on the table OR purple_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 must hold at s or at some state after s"

In the initial state, white_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1, but white_block_1 is on the table, and purple_block_1 is on top of white_block_1. So, the "if" part holds, but the "then" part doesn't. The "then" part requires that either white_block_1 is not on the table OR purple_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, but both of these are not true. So we need to fulfill this constraint at some point. OK, we already made that happen by unstacking purple_block_1 from white_block_1.

But I think I misunderstood constraint 11. Let's revisit:
Constraint 11: "At some point, white_block_1 is clear AND white_block_2 is not clear"

After step 4, white_block_1 is clear. But white_block_2 is also clear, so this constraint isn't fulfilled yet. We need to have a state where white_block_1 is clear and white_block_2 is not clear. I think we got there, but let me again re-examine our plan:

1. unstack white_block_2 from purple_block_1
2. putdown white_block_2 (Constraint 4: "you are holding white_block_2" is satisfied)
3. unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1 (Constraint 10: Now purple_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1)
4. putdown purple_block_1
At this point, white_block_1 is clear (there's no block on top of it), and white_block_2 is also clear (there's no block on top of it), so constraint 11 is not yet fulfilled.

Let's continue:
5. unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (Constraint 5: "you are holding blue_block_1" is satisfied)
6. stack blue_block_1 on white_block_2 (Constraint 3: blue_block_1 is not on the table; Constraint 11: white_block_1 is clear and white_block_2 is not clear)
7. pickup purple_block_1 (Constraint 6: After holding blue_block_1, hold purple_block_1)
8. stack purple_block_1 on white_block_1 (resetting to original configuration, but without white_block_2 on top)
9. unstack yellow_block_1 from red_block_1 (Constraint 1: "you are holding yellow_block_1" is satisfied)
10. putdown yellow_block_1 (Goal: yellow_block_1 is on the table)

But wait, I'm not sure this plan satisfies constraint 2: Before holding yellow_block_1, blue_block_1 should be on top of white_block_2 or purple_block_1. In step 6, we indeed have blue_block_1 on top of white_block_2, but in step 8, we move purple_block_1 to be on top of white_block_1, so blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_2. In step 9, we pick up yellow_block_1, so the constraint is satisfied.

Let's check again:
Constraint 2: If "you are holding yellow_block_1" holds in some state, there must be an earlier state where "blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_2" or "blue_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1" is true.

In the plan, we do have "blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_2" in step the state after step 6, and we hold yellow_block_1 in step 9, so this constraint is indeed satisfied.

I believe the plan satisfies all the constraints. Let's double-check:

1. "you are holding yellow_block_1" - Satisfied in step 9.
2. Before holding yellow_block_1, blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_2 or purple_block_1 - Satisfied in step 6.
3. blue_block_1 is never on the table - Satisfied throughout.
4. "you are holding white_block_2" - Satisfied in step 1-2.
5. "you are holding blue_block_1" - Satisfied in step 5.
6. After holding blue_block_1, "you are holding purple_block_1" - Satisfied in step 5-7.
7. "white_block_2 is not on the table" - Satisfied in the initial state.
8. After "white_block_2 is not on the table", either purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1 or red_block_1 is not clear - Satisfied in the initial state (red_block_1 is not clear).
9. "white_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1" - Satisfied in the initial state.
10. After "white_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1", either white_block_1 is not on the table or purple_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 - Satisfied in step 3.
11. white_block_1 is clear AND white_block_2 is not clear - Satisfied after step 6.

I think our plan satisfies all the constraints. Let's recap it for clarity:

1. unstack white_block_2 from purple_block_1
2. putdown white_block_2
3. unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1
4. putdown purple_block_1
5. unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1
6. stack blue_block_1 on white_block_2
7. pickup purple_block_1
8. stack purple_block_1 on white_block_1
9. unstack yellow_block_1 from red_block_1
10. putdown yellow_block_1

Wait, I just realized a potential issue. In step 8, we stack purple_block_1 on white_block_1. However, doing this means white_block_1 is no longer clear, which seems to clash with the state after step 6 where white_block_1 is clear and white_block_2 is not. But the constraint only says that at some point white_block_1 is clear AND white_block_2 is not clear, which happens after step 6. So, I believe the plan is correct.

Let's revise the plan one more time, step by step:

1. Initial state:
   - white_block_1 is on the table, with purple_block_1 on top of it, with white_block_2 on top.
   - red_block_1 is on the table, with yellow_block_1 on top of it, with blue_block_1, on top.
   - grey_block_1 is on the table.

2. Step 1: unstack white_block_2 from purple_block_1
   - Now white_block_2 is in hand, and purple_block_1 is clear.

3. Step 2: putdown white_block_2
   - Now white_block_2 is on the table and clear, and we're not holding any block.

4. Step 3: unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1
   - Now purple_block_1 is in hand, and white_block_1 is clear.

5. Step 4: putdown purple_block_1
   - Now purple_block_1 is on the table and clear, and we're not holding any block.

6. Step 5: unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1
   - Now blue_block_1 is in hand, and yellow_block_1 is clear.

7. Step 6: stack blue_block_1 on white_block_2
   - Now blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_2, and we're not holding any block.
   - Note: At this point, white_block_1 is clear AND white_block_2 is not clear (because blue_block_1 is on top of it). This satisfies constraint 11.

8. Step 7: pickup purple_block_1
   - Now purple_block_1 is in hand. We've satisfied constraint 6, which says after holding blue_block_1, we need to hold purple_block_1.

9. Step 8: stack purple_block_1 on white_block_1
   - Now purple_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, and we're not holding any block.

10. Step 9: unstack yellow_block_1 from red_block_1
    - Now yellow_block_1 is in hand. We've satisfied constraint 1, and constraint 2 is also satisfied because blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_2 at step 6, which is before we held yellow_block_1.

11. Step 10: putdown yellow_block_1
    - Now yellow_block_1 is on the table. Our goal is achieved.

I believe this plan is correct and optimal (10 steps).

Actually, let me check the initial position again. I know white_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_1 on top of it and white_block_2 on top of that. And red_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top of it and blue_block_1 on top of that.

After step 5, yellow_block_1 is still on top of red_block_1. In step 9, we pick up yellow_block_1. Constraint 2 says "If 'you are holding yellow_block_1' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which: 'blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_2' or 'blue_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1'". At step 6, we've put blue_block_1 on top of white_block_2, and that happens before step 9. So, constraint 2 is indeed satisfied.

So our final 10-step plan:
1. unstack white_block_2 from purple_block_1
2. putdown white_block_2
3. unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1
4. putdown purple_block_1
5. unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1
6. stack blue_block_1 on white_block_2
7. pickup purple_block_1
8. stack purple_block_1 on white_block_1
9. unstack yellow_block_1 from red_block_1
10. putdown yellow_block_1
