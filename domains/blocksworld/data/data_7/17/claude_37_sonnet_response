Let me carefully analyze this planning problem to come up with a valid and optimal plan.

**Initial State:**
- red_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- black_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- black_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- brown_block_1, black_block_2, and green_block_1 are clear
- The arm is not holding any block

Visually, we have these stacks:
1. red_block_1 -- brown_block_1
2. black_block_1 -- blue_block_1 -- black_block_2
3. yellow_block_1 -- green_block_1

**Goal:**
- brown_block_1 is on the table

**Constraints:**
1. At some point, black_block_2 should not be clear (something on top of it)
2. At some point, black_block_1 should not be on top of brown_block_1 (this seems already satisfied in the initial state)
3. If black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1 (which is true in the initial state), then at least one of these must hold at that or a later state:
   - red_block_1 is not on the table
   - brown_block_1 is not clear
4. At some point, you must be holding blue_block_1
5. At some point, yellow_block_1 must be on top of black_block_1 and yellow_block_1 is clear
6. At some point, green_block_1 is not on the table
7. If green_block_1 is not on the table, then at least one of these must hold at that or a later state:
   - yellow_block_1 is clear
   - green_block_1 is not clear
8. At some point, black_block_1 is not on the table and green_block_1 is on the table
9. At some point, yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1 (this overlaps with constraint 5)

The goal is simple: we need to move brown_block_1 to the table. However, there are many constraints we need to satisfy during our plan.

Let's start by thinking about what we need to do to achieve the goal directly:
1. unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1

But that's too simple and wouldn't satisfy all the constraints. Let's look at each constraint and think about how to satisfy it:

Constraint 1: At some point, black_block_2 should not be clear. 
This means we need to put something on top of black_block_2.

Constraint 2: black_block_1 should not be on top of brown_block_1.
This is already satisfied in the initial state, so we don't need to do anything here.

Constraint 3: Since black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1 in the initial state, we need to ensure that either red_block_1 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear at some point.
Since we'll be removing brown_block_1 from red_block_1, brown_block_1 will become clear. So, we'd need to either move red_block_1 off the table or put something on brown_block_1.

Constraint 4: At some point, we need to hold blue_block_1.
This means we need to unstack it from black_block_1.

Constraint 5: At some point, yellow_block_1 must be on top of black_block_1 and yellow_block_1 is clear.
This means we need to move yellow_block_1 from its initial position to on top of black_block_1.

Constraint 6: At some point, green_block_1 is not on the table.
Given the initial state, green_block_1 is already not on the table (it's on yellow_block_1), so this constraint is already satisfied.

Constraint 7: Since green_block_1 is not on the table in the initial state, we need to ensure that either yellow_block_1 is clear or green_block_1 is not clear.
Given that green_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1 and green_block_1 is clear in the initial state, yellow_block_1 is not clear. If we want to satisfy this constraint using the "yellow_block_1 is clear" option, we'd need to move green_block_1 from yellow_block_1. Alternatively, we could satisfy it by putting something on top of green_block_1 to make it not clear.

Constraint 8: At some point, black_block_1 is not on the table and green_block_1 is on the table.
This means we need to move black_block_1 off the table and green_block_1 onto the table.

Constraint 9: At some point, yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1.
This overlaps with constraint 5.

Now, let's try to come up with a plan:

1. To satisfy constraints 5 and 9, we need to move yellow_block_1 on top of black_block_1. But before that, we need to:
   a. unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (this will also help with constraint 7)
   b. putdown green_block_1 (this will help with constraint 8)
   c. pickup yellow_block_1
   d. unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1
   e. unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1 (this will help with constraint 4)
   f. stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1

2. To satisfy constraint 8, we need to move black_block_1 off the table and ensure green_block_1 is on the table (which we've already achieved in 1b):
   a. pickup black_block_1 (with yellow_block_1 on it)
   b. stack black_block_1 (with yellow_block_1 on it) on some other block

3. To satisfy constraint 1, we need to put something on top of black_block_2:
   a. pickup a block (maybe blue_block_1 which we've already unstacked)
   b. stack that block on top of black_block_2

4. For the main goal, we want to move brown_block_1 to the table:
   a. unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1
   b. putdown brown_block_1

5. To satisfy constraint 3, we need to either move red_block_1 off the table or put something on brown_block_1. Let's go with the latter:
   a. Pickup a block (maybe blue_block_1)
   b. Stack it on brown_block_1

Let me try to integrate all these steps into a cohesive plan:

1. unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1
2. putdown green_block_1 on the table
3. pickup yellow_block_1
4. stack yellow_block_1 on some block (not black_block_1 yet, we need to unstack blocks from it)
5. unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1
6. putdown black_block_2 on the table
7. unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1 (this also satisfies constraint 4)
8. stack blue_block_1 on black_block_2 (this satisfies constraint 1)
9. pickup yellow_block_1 (from wherever we put it in step 4)
10. stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1 (this satisfies constraints 5 and 9)
11. unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1
12. pickup black_block_1 (with yellow_block_1 on top)
13. stack black_block_1 (with yellow_block_1 on top) on some block (this satisfies constraint 8)
14. putdown brown_block_1 on the table (this is our main goal)
15. pickup some block
16. stack that block on brown_block_1 (this satisfies constraint 3)

Wait, I just realized that I have a logical issue. If black_block_1 is on the table and yellow_block_1 is on top of it (as per constraint 5/9), then I can't just pick up black_block_1 because there's a block on top of it. I need to revise my plan.

Also, there's a problem with step 4 above. I don't know which block to stack yellow_block_1 onto, because all clear blocks might be needed elsewhere.

Let me reconsider the constraints and redo the plan:

1. At some point, black_block_2 should not be clear. -> Something on top of black_block_2.
2. At some point, black_block_1 should not be on top of brown_block_1. -> Already satisfied in initial state.
3. If black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1, then red_block_1 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear. -> We might need to put something on top of brown_block_1.
4. At some point, you must be holding blue_block_1. -> Need to unstack blue_block_1.
5. At some point, yellow_block_1 must be on top of black_block_1 and yellow_block_1 is clear. -> Need to move yellow_block_1 to black_block_1.
6. At some point, green_block_1 is not on the table. -> Satisfied in initial state.
7. If green_block_1 is not on the table, then yellow_block_1 is clear or green_block_1 is not clear. -> Need to ensure this.
8. At some point, black_block_1 is not on the table and green_block_1 is on the table. -> Need to move black_block_1 off the table and green_block_1 onto the table.
9. At some point, yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1. -> Same as 5.

Let's try another approach. Instead of a step-by-step plan, let me visualize the world's state at each step and ensure all constraints are met.

Initial State:
1. red_block_1 -- brown_block_1
2. black_block_1 -- blue_block_1 -- black_block_2
3. yellow_block_1 -- green_block_1

Let's think about each constraint and ensure we address it in our plan:

1. For constraint 1, we need to put something on top of black_block_2. Let's use green_block_1 for this.
2. Constraint 2 is already satisfied.
3. For constraint 3, since Constraint 2 is already satisfied, we need to ensure that either red_block_1 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear. Let's ensure brown_block_1 is not clear by putting something on it.
4. For constraint 4, we need to hold blue_block_1 at some point, which means unstacking it.
5. For constraint 5, we need to have yellow_block_1 on top of black_block_1 and yellow_block_1 should be clear.
6. Constraint 6 is already satisfied.
7. For constraint 7, since green_block_1 is not on the table in the initial state, we need to ensure that either yellow_block_1 is clear or green_block_1 is not clear. Let's make yellow_block_1 clear by removing green_block_1.
8. For constraint 8, we need to move black_block_1 off the table and green_block_1 onto the table. Let's put black_block_1 on top of green_block_1.
9. Constraint 9 is the same as 5.

Let's see if we can come up with a plan that satisfies all these constraints. As an intermediate and some final states, I'm thinking:

Intermediate State 1:
1. red_block_1 -- brown_block_1 -- black_block_2
2. black_block_1 -- blue_block_1
3. yellow_block_1
4. green_block_1

Intermediate State 2:
1. red_block_1 -- brown_block_1 -- black_block_2
2. green_block_1 -- black_block_1 -- yellow_block_1
3. blue_block_1

Final State:
1. brown_block_1 -- blue_block_1
2. red_block_1
3. green_block_1 -- black_block_1 -- yellow_block_1
4. black_block_2

Now, let me craft a plan to transition from the initial state to these intermediate states and finally to the goal state:

From Initial to Intermediate State 1:
1. unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (makes yellow_block_1 clear, helping with constraint 7)
2. stack green_block_1 on the table (helps with constraint 8)
3. unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1
4. unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1 (this also satisfies constraint 4)
5. stack black_block_2 on brown_block_1 (helps with constraint 3)

From Intermediate State 1 to Intermediate State 2:
6. pickup black_block_1
7. stack black_block_1 on green_block_1 (helps with constraint 8)
8. pickup yellow_block_1
9. stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1 (satisfies constraint 5 and 9)

From Intermediate State 2 to Final State:
10. unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1
11. putdown brown_block_1 on the table (achieves the goal)
12. pickup blue_block_1
13. stack blue_block_1 on brown_block_1 (ensures constraint 3)

Wait, constraint 1 is still not satisfied in this plan. We need to have something on top of black_block_2 at some point. Let me revise:

From Initial to Intermediate State 1:
1. unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (makes yellow_block_1 clear, helping with constraint 7)
2. stack green_block_1 on black_block_2 (satisfies constraint 1)
3. unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2
4. putdown green_block_1 on the table (helps with constraint 8)
5. unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1
6. unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1 (this also satisfies constraint 4)
7. stack black_block_2 on brown_block_1 (helps with constraint 3)

The rest of the plan remains the same.

Actually, let me revise the entire plan to make it clearer:

1. unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1
2. stack green_block_1 on black_block_2 (satisfies constraint 1)
3. unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2
4. putdown green_block_1 on the table (helps with constraint 8)
5. unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1
6. unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1 (this also satisfies constraint 4)
7. putdown blue_block_1 on the table
8. pickup black_block_1
9. stack black_block_1 on green_block_1 (satisfies constraint 8)
10. pickup yellow_block_1
11. stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1 (satisfies constraint 5 and 9)
12. unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1
13. putdown brown_block_1 on the table (achieves the goal)
14. pickup black_block_2
15. stack black_block_2 on brown_block_1 (ensures constraint 3)

But I think some more refinement might be necessary. Let me trace through this step-by-step to see if all constraints are indeed satisfied:

Initial State:
1. red_block_1 -- brown_block_1
2. black_block_1 -- blue_block_1 -- black_block_2
3. yellow_block_1 -- green_block_1

Step 1: unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1
Result:
1. red_block_1 -- brown_block_1
2. black_block_1 -- blue_block_1 -- black_block_2
3. yellow_block_1
4. Holding green_block_1

Step 2: stack green_block_1 on black_block_2
Result:
1. red_block_1 -- brown_block_1
2. black_block_1 -- blue_block_1 -- black_block_2 -- green_block_1
3. yellow_block_1
4. Not holding any block

This satisfies constraint 1: At some point, black_block_2 should not be clear. It also satisfies constraint 6 (green_block_1 is not on the table), and for constraint 7, the condition "green_block_1 is not clear" doesn't need to be satisfied since green_block_1 is not on the table.

Step 3: unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2
Result:
1. red_block_1 -- brown_block_1
2. black_block_1 -- blue_block_1 -- black_block_2
3. yellow_block_1
4. Holding green_block_1

Step 4: putdown green_block_1 on the table
Result:
1. red_block_1 -- brown_block_1
2. black_block_1 -- blue_block_1 -- black_block_2
3. yellow_block_1
4. green_block_1
5. Not holding any block

Step 5: unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1
Result:
1. red_block_1 -- brown_block_1
2. black_block_1 -- blue_block_1
3. yellow_block_1
4. green_block_1
5. Holding black_block_2

Step 6: putdown black_block_2 on the table (modified from the previous plan)
Result:
1. red_block_1 -- brown_block_1
2. black_block_1 -- blue_block_1
3. yellow_block_1
4. green_block_1
5. black_block_2
6. Not holding any block

Step 7: unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1
Result:
1. red_block_1 -- brown_block_1
2. black_block_1
3. yellow_block_1
4. green_block_1
5. black_block_2
6. Holding blue_block_1

This satisfies constraint 4: At some point, you must be holding blue_block_1.

Step 8: putdown blue_block_1 on the table
Result:
1. red_block_1 -- brown_block_1
2. black_block_1
3. yellow_block_1
4. green_block_1
5. black_block_2
6. blue_block_1
7. Not holding any block

Step 9: pickup black_block_1
Result:
1. red_block_1 -- brown_block_1
2. yellow_block_1
3. green_block_1
4. black_block_2
5. blue_block_1
6. Holding black_block_1

Step 10: stack black_block_1 on green_block_1
Result:
1. red_block_1 -- brown_block_1
2. yellow_block_1
3. green_block_1 -- black_block_1
4. black_block_2
5. blue_block_1
6. Not holding any block

This helps satisfy constraint 8: At some point, black_block_1 is not on the table and green_block_1 is on the table.

Step 11: pickup yellow_block_1
Result:
1. red_block_1 -- brown_block_1
2. green_block_1 -- black_block_1
3. black_block_2
4. blue_block_1
5. Holding yellow_block_1

Step 12: stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1
Result:
1. red_block_1 -- brown_block_1
2. green_block_1 -- black_block_1 -- yellow_block_1
3. black_block_2
4. blue_block_1
5. Not holding any block

This satisfies constraint 5/9: At some point, yellow_block_1 must be on top of black_block_1 and yellow_block_1 is clear.

Also, at this point, given that green_block_1 is on the table and black_block_1 is on top of it, constraint 8 is satisfied.

Step 13: unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1
Result:
1. red_block_1
2. green_block_1 -- black_block_1 -- yellow_block_1
3. black_block_2
4. blue_block_1
5. Holding brown_block_1

Step 14: putdown brown_block_1 on the table
Result:
1. red_block_1
2. green_block_1 -- black_block_1 -- yellow_block_1
3. black_block_2
4. blue_block_1
5. brown_block_1
6. Not holding any block

This achieves the main goal: brown_block_1 is on the table.

However, we still need to satisfy constraint 3. Since black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1 in the initial state, we need to ensure that either red_block_1 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear. Brown_block_1 is currently clear, so we'd need to put something on it.

Step 15: pickup black_block_2
Result:
1. red_block_1
2. green_block_1 -- black_block_1 -- yellow_block_1
3. blue_block_1
4. brown_block_1
5. Holding black_block_2

Step 16: stack black_block_2 on brown_block_1
Result:
1. red_block_1
2. green_block_1 -- black_block_1 -- yellow_block_1
3. blue_block_1
4. brown_block_1 -- black_block_2
5. Not holding any block

This ensures constraint 3: If black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1 (which is true from the initial state), then at least one of these must hold: red_block_1 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear. In this case, brown_block_1 is not clear as it has black_block_2 on top of it.

Actually, let me double-check why constraint 2 (black_block_1 should not be on top of brown_block_1) is already satisfied in the initial state. The initial state had:
- red_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- black_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- black_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1

Yes, in the initial state, black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1, so constraint 2 is satisfied.

Let's double-check constraint 7 as well. It states that if green_block_1 is not on the table, then at least one of these must hold: yellow_block_1 is clear or green_block_1 is not clear. In the initial state, green_block_1 is not on the table (it's on yellow_block_1), yellow_block_1 is not clear (it has green_block_1 on it), and green_block_1 is clear. So, both conditions of constraint 7 are not met in the initial state. 

However, constraint 7 only applies if the antecedent is true. In the final state of our plan, green_block_1 is on the table, so constraint 7 doesn't need to be checked.

Let me make sure we satisfy constraint 7 during our plan. In step 1, we unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1, so at this point:
- green_block_1 is not on the table (it's being held)
- yellow_block_1 is clear

So, constraint 7 is satisfied at this step.

Throughout the plan, we also ensure:
- constraint 1: At step 2, black_block_2 has green_block_1 on top of it, so it's not clear.
- constraint 2: This is already satisfied in the initial state.
- constraint 3: At step 16, we made sure brown_block_1 is not clear by putting black_block_2 on top of it.
- constraint 4: At step 7, you are holding blue_block_1.
- constraint 5 & 9: At step 12, yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1 and yellow_block_1 is clear.
- constraint 6: This is already satisfied in the initial state.
- constraint 7: At step 1, when green_block_1 is not on the table (after unstacking it), yellow_block_1 is clear.
- constraint 8: At step 10 and onwards, black_block_1 is not on the table (it's on top of green_block_1) and green_block_1 is on the table.

All constraints seem to be satisfied. Let's recap our final plan:

1. unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1
2. stack green_block_1 on black_block_2
3. unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2
4. putdown green_block_1 on the table
5. unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1
6. putdown black_block_2 on the table
7. unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1
8. putdown blue_block_1 on the table
9. pickup black_block_1
10. stack black_block_1 on green_block_1
11. pickup yellow_block_1
12. stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1
13. unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1
14. putdown brown_block_1 on the table
15. pickup black_block_2
16. stack black_block_2 on brown_block_1

I believe this is an optimal plan given the constraints and the goal. The goal is achieved (brown_block_1 is on the table) and all the constraints are satisfied at some point in the plan.

Actually, let me double-check that this is the optimal plan for this problem by the criteria given. We want the shortest plan (fewest number of steps) that achieves the goal and satisfies all the constraints. 

Our goal is to get brown_block_1 on the table. Without any constraints, we could just unstack it from red_block_1 and put it on the table (2 steps). But we have many constraints to satisfy.

Each constraint adds additional actions to our plan:
- Constraint 1: We added steps to put green_block_1 on top of black_block_2.
- Constraint 2: Already satisfied in the initial state.
- Constraint 3: We added steps to ensure brown_block_1 is not clear after putting it on the table.
- Constraint 4: We added an action to unstack blue_block_1.
- Constraint 5 & 9: We added steps to move yellow_block_1 on top of black_block_1.
- Constraint 6: Already satisfied in the initial state.
- Constraint 7: We added a step to unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1.
- Constraint 8: We added steps to ensure black_block_1 is not on the table and green_block_1 is on the table.

It seems we've tried to minimize the number of actions while ensuring all constraints are met. The plan has 16 steps, which includes actions to unstacking and stacking blocks to achieve specific states required by the constraints.

Actually, let me see if I can simplify step 2 and 3. Instead of stacking green_block_1 on black_block_2 and then unstacking it, I can directly put it on the table. However, we would then miss out on satisfying constraint 1.

I think I'm overthinking a bit. Let me revisit the condition for constraint 1: "At some point, black_block_2. i.e., black_block_2 is not clear". If I look at the initial state:
black_block_1 -- blue_block_1 -- black_block_2

There's black_block_2 at the top, which is clear. So, constraint 1 wants us to have something on top of black_block_2 at some point to make it not clear. Hence, the stacking of green_block_1 on black_block_2 is necessary.

So, the plan with 16 steps is likely optimal for the given constraints. I could potentially reorder some steps for efficiency, but the general flow and number of steps would remain the same.

Let's finalize the plan:

1. unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1
2. stack green_block_1 on black_block_2
3. unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2
4. putdown green_block_1 on the table
5. unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1
6. putdown black_block_2 on the table
7. unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1
8. putdown blue_block_1 on the table
9. pickup black_block_1
10. stack black_block_1 on green_block_1
11. pickup yellow_block_1
12. stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1
13. unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1
14. putdown brown_block_1 on the table
15. pickup black_block_2
16. stack black_block_2 on brown_block_1

Actually, one other thing I can check is if there are any shorter plans by reordering the steps. Let me just double-check the reasoning on why we need 16 steps:

- 2 steps for the core goal (unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1, putdown brown_block_1 on the table)
- 2 steps to satisfy Constraint 1 (stack green_block_1 on black_block_2, then unstack)
- 2 steps to satisfy Constraint 3 (pickup black_block_2, stack on brown_block_1)
- 2 steps to satisfy Constraint 4 (unstack blue_block_1, putdown blue_block_1)
- 4 steps to satisfy Constraint 5/9 (unstack green_block_1, putdown, pickup yellow_block_1, stack on black_block_1)
- 4 steps to satisfy Constraint 8 (pickup black_block_1, stack on green_block_1, which is already on the table from satisfying 5/9)

That's a total of 16 steps. I'm not sure if any of these steps are redundant or can be done more efficiently, but it seems like this is a tight plan.

Actually, I realized we could optimize this a bit. After we unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1, we could put it directly on the table instead of first placing it on black_block_2. That would save 2 steps (stacking and then unstacking). Then, later on, we'd need to find another way to satisfy constraint 1.

But constraint 1 is that black_block_2 should not be clear at some point. In our plan, there's a step where black_block_2 is stacked on brown_block_1. At that point, black_block_2 is clear. We need to put something on top of it.

Maybe after step 16, we could add:
17. pickup blue_block_1
18. stack blue_block_1 on black_block_2

But then, the final step count would be 18, which is more than the original plan. So, the original plan seems to be more efficient.

Another thought: maybe instead of stacking green_block_1 on black_block_2 (steps 2-3), we can stack it on another block like blue_block_1 or some other block, and free up black_block_2 for stacking onto brown_block_1 directly? This might reduce the number of steps.

Actually, let me see if we can rearrange the steps:

1. unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (green_block_1 in hand, yellow_block_1 clear)
2. putdown green_block_1 on the table
3. pickup yellow_block_1
4. stack yellow_block_1 on green_block_1
5. unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1
6. stack black_block_2 on yellow_block_1
7. unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1
8. putdown blue_block_1 on the table
9. pickup black_block_1
10. stack black_block_1 on black_block_2
11. unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1
12. putdown brown_block_1 on the table
13. pickup blue_block_1
14. stack blue_block_1 on brown_block_1

This would be 14 steps. Let's check if all constraints are satisfied:
- Constraint 1: At step 10, black_block_2 has black_block_1 on top, so it's not clear.
- Constraint 2: Satisfied in the initial state.
- Constraint 3: At step 14, brown_block_1 is not clear as it has blue_block_1 on top.
- Constraint 4: At step 7, you're holding blue_block_1.
- Constraint 5 & 9: Yellow_block_1 is not on top of black_block_1 in this plan. This is not satisfied!
- Constraint 6: Satisfied in the initial state.
- Constraint 7: At step 1, green_block_1 is not on the table (in your hand) and yellow_block_1 is clear.
- Constraint 8: Hmm, I'm not sure about this one. black_block_1 is on top of black_block_2, which is on top of yellow_block_1, which is on top of green_block_1, which is on the table. So, black_block_1 is not on the table and green_block_1 is on the table. This is satisfied.

Ah, I forgot about constraint 5 & 9, which is that yellow_block_1 must be on top of black_block_1 at some point. Let's modify our plan to accommodate this:

1. unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1
2. putdown green_block_1 on the table
3. unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1
4. putdown black_block_2 on the table
5. unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1
6. putdown blue_block_1 on the table
7. pickup yellow_block_1
8. stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1
9. unstack yellow_block_1 from black_block_1
10. stack yellow_block_1 on green_block_1
11. pickup black_block_1
12. stack black_block_1 on black_block_2
13. unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1
14. putdown brown_block_1 on the table
15. pickup blue_block_1
16. stack blue_block_1 on brown_block_1

But now we're back to 16 steps...

Actually, after stacking yellow_block_1 on black_block_1, do we need to unstack it immediately? Maybe we can postpone this:

1. unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1
2. putdown green_block_1 on the table
3. unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1
4. putdown black_block_2 on the table
5. unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1
6. putdown blue_block_1 on the table
7. pickup yellow_block_1
8. stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1
9. pickup black_block_2
10. stack black_block_2 on yellow_block_1
11. unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1
12. putdown brown_block_1 on the table
13. pickup blue_block_1
14. stack blue_block_1 on brown_block_1
15. pickup black_block_1
16. stack black_block_1 on green_block_1

That's still 16 steps, and I'm not even sure if all constraints are satisfied.

Let me think even more...

Actually what if the optimal plan just directly satisfies the goal, brown_block_1 is on the table? For that, we just need:

1. unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1 on the table

But then we would miss out on satisfied many of the required constraints. So, the bare minimum goal requires 2 steps, but with all the constraints, we need more actions.

I keep coming back to plans around 16 actions. Let me see if there's any other way to optimize while ensuring all constraints are met.

I think a plan with 16 actions is probably the optimal plan for this problem, given the goal and constraints. But let me do a final check with respect to the 16-step plan I provided earlier:

1. unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1
2. stack green_block_1 on black_block_2
3. unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2
4. putdown green_block_1 on the table
5. unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1
6. putdown black_block_2 on the table
7. unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1
8. putdown blue_block_1 on the table
9. pickup black_block_1
10. stack black_block_1 on green_block_1
11. pickup yellow_block_1
12. stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1
13. unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1
14. putdown brown_block_1 on the table
15. pickup black_block_2
16. stack black_block_2 on brown_block_1

Let's check one more time if all constraints are met:
- Constraint 1: At step 2, black_block_2 has green_block_1 on top, so it's not clear.
- Constraint 2: Satisfied in the initial state.
- Constraint 3: At step 16, brown_block_1 is not clear as it has black_block_2 on top.
- Constraint 4: At step 7, you're holding blue_block_1.
- Constraint 5 & 9: At step 12, yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1 and yellow_block_1 is clear.
- Constraint 6: Satisfied in the initial state.
- Constraint 7: At step 1, green_block_1 is not on the table (in your hand) and yellow_block_1 is clear.
- Constraint 8: After step 10, black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1, which is on the table. So, black_block_1 is not on the table and green_block_1 is on the table.

Indeed, all constraints are met with this plan, and we achieve the goal of having brown_block_1 on the table. I guess this plan is optimal.

Given the complexity of the constraints and the goal, it's possible that there's a more optimal plan with fewer steps, but I've explored multiple avenues and consistently came back to a plan around 16 steps. It's a non-trivial planning problem, and I believe the 16-step plan is the optimal for this problem.

1. unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1
2. stack green_block_1 on black_block_2
3. unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2
4. putdown green_block_1 on the table
5. unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1
6. putdown black_block_2 on the table
7. unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1
8. putdown blue_block_1 on the table
9. pickup black_block_1
10. stack black_block_1 on green_block_1
11. pickup yellow_block_1
12. stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1
13. unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1
14. putdown brown_block_1 on the table
15. pickup black_block_2
16. stack black_block_2 on brown_block_1
