Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld planning problem. The goal is to get brown_block_1 onto the table. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy too. Let's start by understanding the initial state and the goal, then figure out the steps needed while making sure all the constraints are met.

First, the initial state:

- purple_block_1 is on the table, with red_block_1 on top of it, and then purple_block_2 on top of red_block_1. So the tower here is purple_block_1 -> red_block_1 -> purple_block_2. Purple_block_2 is clear.
- grey_block_1 is on the table with white_block_1 on top of it. White_block_1 is clear.
- purple_block_3 is on the table with brown_block_1 on top. Brown_block_1 is clear.

The goal is to have brown_block_1 on the table. So we need to move brown_block_1 from purple_block_3 to the table. But that's straightforward: unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_3 and put it down. But we can't just do that right away because of the constraints.

Let's look at the constraints one by one.

1. At least one state must have brown_block_1 not clear (something on top). But since the goal is to have it on the table, which is clear, we need to temporarily put something on it before moving it. However, since we need to move brown_block_1 to the table, maybe after putting it down, we can't stack anything on it. Wait, but the goal is just that brown_block_1 is on the table. So maybe before moving brown_block_1, we have to stack something on it first. But that's impossible because brown_block_1 is on top of purple_block_3, which is clear. So to stack something on brown_block_1, we need to have another block available. Wait, but the initial state has other blocks. For example, purple_block_2 is on top of red_block_1. So maybe we can move that.

But let's list the constraints properly.

Constraints:

1. At some point, brown_block_1 must be not clear (i.e., something is on top). And if that's the case, then before that state, either purple_block_3 is not on the table or grey_block_1 is not on the table.

But purple_block_3 is initially on the table. So to satisfy the antecedent, if we have brown_block_1 not clear, then in an earlier state, either purple_block_3 is not on the table (which would mean we moved it) or grey_block_1 is not on the table (which is on the table initially, so perhaps moved).

But how can we get something on top of brown_block_1? Since brown_block_1 is on purple_block_3, we could stack another block on it. But first, we need to unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_3, but wait, no. Wait, initially, brown_block_1 is on purple_block_3. To stack something on brown_block_1, we need to have brown_block_1 clear. It is clear initially. So perhaps we can stack another block on it. But the problem is that the goal is to have brown_block_1 on the table. So if we stack something on brown_block_1, then we can't put it down unless we first unstack that block. But this might complicate things, but perhaps necessary for the constraint.

Wait, the constraint says that in at least one state, brown_block_1 is not clear. So maybe we need to stack something on it, then later unstack it and put brown_block_1 down. But how?

Alternatively, maybe after moving brown_block_1 to the table, we can stack something on it. But the goal is just to have brown_block_1 on the table; it doesn't say anything about it being clear. So perhaps after putting it down, we stack something else on it. But that would require picking up another block. Let's see.

But let's proceed step by step.

First, the main goal: get brown_block_1 on the table. The direct way is to unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_3 and put it down. But the constraints complicate things.

Constraint 1: brown_block_1 must be not clear in some state. So we need to have a block on top of it at some point. But currently, brown_block_1 is on purple_block_3, and it's clear. So to make it not clear, we need to stack another block on it. But to stack, we need to hold that block and have brown_block_1 clear. Let's see.

Possible approach: unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_3, put it down, then pick up another block (like purple_block_2) and stack it on brown_block_1. But then brown_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_2 on top. Then, to satisfy the goal, we would need to unstack purple_block_2 from brown_block_1 and put it somewhere else. But this adds steps. However, the plan needs to be optimal (shortest possible). So maybe this is not optimal. Alternatively, can we have a different sequence where brown_block_1 is stacked upon before moving it?

Wait, but brown_block_1 is initially on purple_block_3. If we stack something on it, then brown_block_1 is still on purple_block_3, but now has a block on top. Then, when we unstack that block, brown_block_1 remains on purple_block_3. Then, we can unstack brown_block_1 and put it down. But this adds steps. Let's think.

Wait, the initial state is that brown_block_1 is on purple_block_3, and purple_block_3 is on the table. So brown_block_1 is clear. To stack something on brown_block_1, we can do:

1. pickup another block (say, white_block_1 from grey_block_1)
2. stack white_block_1 on brown_block_1.

But after stacking, brown_block_1 is not clear. This satisfies constraint 1. Then, we can unstack white_block_1 from brown_block_1, put it down, then unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_3 and put it down. But this would require more steps. However, the first constraint requires that when brown_block_1 is not clear (i.e., when white_block_1 is on it), there must have been a prior state where purple_block_3 is not on the table or grey_block_1 is not on the table. Let's check.

In this scenario, when we stack white_block_1 on brown_block_1, the state where brown_block_1 is not clear is after the stack. The prior state would be when we picked up white_block_1 from grey_block_1. So after unstacking white_block_1 from grey_block_1, grey_block_1 is still on the table. Wait, no: unstacking white_block_1 from grey_block_1 leaves grey_block_1 on the table but clear. So grey_block_1 is still on the table. So the condition for the first constraint is that before brown_block_1 is not clear, either purple_block_3 is not on the table or grey_block_1 is not on the table. But in this case, neither is true. Purple_block_3 is still on the table, and grey_block_1 is on the table. So this violates the second part of constraint 1. So this approach won't work.

So, to satisfy constraint 1, when brown_block_1 is not clear, we need to have had a prior state where either purple_block_3 is not on the table or grey_block_1 is not on the table. So perhaps we need to move either purple_block_3 or grey_block_1 off the table before stacking something on brown_block_1.

But moving purple_block_3 is tricky because it's under brown_block_1. To move purple_block_3, we need to first remove brown_block_1. But that's the main goal. So maybe moving grey_block_1 instead.

Grey_block_1 is on the table with white_block_1 on top. If we unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1 and put it somewhere else, then grey_block_1 remains on the table. To make grey_block_1 not on the table, we need to pick it up. But since it's on the table and clear (after removing white_block_1), we can pick it up. So perhaps:

1. unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1 (now white_block_1 is held, grey_block_1 is clear on table)
2. putdown white_block_1 (now white_block_1 is on table, clear)
3. pickup grey_block_1 (since it's clear and on table)
4. stack grey_block_1 somewhere else, maybe on purple_block_3 (but purple_block_3 has brown_block_1 on it, which is clear. Wait, no. Purple_block_3 is under brown_block_1. So to stack grey_block_1 on purple_block_3, we need to have purple_block_3 clear, but it's not. So perhaps stack grey_block_1 on another block.

Alternatively, after picking up grey_block_1, we can put it down again. Wait, but that would just move it from table to table, which is not useful. Alternatively, stack it on another block that's clear. For example, after moving white_block_1, maybe stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1. But white_block_1 is on the table, clear after putdown. So stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1. Then grey_block_1 is not on the table. That would satisfy the condition that in an earlier state, grey_block_1 is not on the table. Then, after that, we can stack something on brown_block_1.

So let's outline this:

- Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1 (now holding white_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear)
- Putdown white_block_1 (white_block_1 on table)
- Pickup grey_block_1 (now holding grey_block_1)
- Stack grey_block_1 onto white_block_1 (grey_block_1 is on white_block_1, so grey_block_1 is not on the table)
- Now, since grey_block_1 is not on the table, we can proceed to stack something on brown_block_1. But brown_block_1 is on purple_block_3. So maybe pickup another block, like purple_block_2 (which is on top of red_block_1, which is on purple_block_1). To get to purple_block_2, need to unstack purple_block_2 from red_block_1.

So steps:

- Unstack purple_block_2 from red_block_1 (requires that purple_block_2 is clear, which it is)
- Putdown purple_block_2 (now it's on the table)
- Pickup purple_block_2
- Stack purple_block_2 on brown_block_1 (now brown_block_1 is not clear, satisfying constraint 1)
- Now, since we've stacked on brown_block_1, we need to unstack it to move brown_block_1.

But wait, after stacking purple_block_2 on brown_block_1, brown_block_1 is under purple_block_2. To move brown_block_1, we need to first unstack purple_block_2 from brown_block_1, then unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_3.

But this is adding many steps. Let's see if there's a better way.

Alternatively, after moving grey_block_1 off the table (as above), then stack something on brown_block_1. Let's say we stack purple_block_2 on brown_block_1. Then, brown_block_1 is not clear. This satisfies constraint 1. Then, we can unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_3 by first unstacking purple_block_2 from it.

Wait, but to unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_3, brown_block_1 must be clear. So if there's something on it (purple_block_2), we can't unstack brown_block_1. So we need to unstack purple_block_2 first.

So steps after stacking purple_block_2 on brown_block_1:

- Unstack purple_block_2 from brown_block_1 (now holding purple_block_2)
- Putdown purple_block_2
- Unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_3 (now holding brown_block_1)
- Putdown brown_block_1 (goal achieved)

But this adds steps. However, the constraints require this. So perhaps this is necessary.

But let's check the constraints again. Let's go through each constraint step by step.

Constraint 1: At some state, brown_block_1 is not clear. In this plan, when purple_block_2 is stacked on it, that's true. Also, the earlier state where grey_block_1 was moved off the table (stacked on white_block_1) satisfies the requirement that in a prior state, grey_block_1 is not on the table. So that part is satisfied.

Constraint 2: Whenever brown_block_1 is not clear, there must have been a prior state where purple_block_3 is not on table or grey_block_1 is not. Since we moved grey_block_1 off the table, that's satisfied.

Next constraint: At some state, purple_block_1 is not clear. Currently, purple_block_1 has red_block_1 on it, which in turn has purple_block_2. So purple_block_1 is not clear (since red_block_1 is on it). Wait, but in the initial state, purple_block_1 has red_block_1 on top, so purple_block_1 is not clear. So this constraint is already satisfied in the initial state. Wait, no. The initial state says "there is no block on top of purple_block_2", but purple_block_1 has red_block_1 on it. So purple_block_1 is not clear. So the constraint that "there is a block on top of purple_block_1" is already true in the initial state. So that constraint is satisfied. However, the next part: if purple_block_1 is not clear in some state s, then you must be holding white_block_1 in s or later.

Wait, the constraint says: if purple_block_1 is not clear in state s, then in s or some state after s, you are holding white_block_1. In the initial state, purple_block_1 is not clear. So we need to ensure that in the initial state or some state after, we hold white_block_1. But in the initial state, we are not holding anything. So we need to hold white_block_1 at some point after the initial state. Which we do when we unstack it from grey_block_1. So that's covered.

Next constraint: white_block_1 must not be on the table in some state. Initially, it's on grey_block_1, which is on the table. So when we unstack it, we are holding it, and then when we put it down, it's on the table again. So to have white_block_1 not on the table, we need to stack it somewhere. For example, after putting it down, pick it up again and stack it. But that's more steps. Alternatively, when we unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1, we could stack it somewhere else instead of putting it down. Let's see.

In the earlier steps, we unstacked white_block_1 from grey_block_1 and put it down. Then picked up grey_block_1 and stacked it on white_block_1. So in that case, white_block_1 is on the table with grey_block_1 on top. So white_block_1 is not on the table? No, it's on the table. Because stacking grey_block_1 on white_block_1 would mean white_block_1 is on the table with grey_block_1 on top. So white_block_1 is still on the table, but not clear. So the constraint requires that in some state, white_block_1 is not on the table. So we need to have white_block_1 somewhere else. For example, stacked on another block.

Wait, no. If white_block_1 is on the table, even if there's a block on top of it, it's still on the table. Wait, no. In Blocksworld, a block is on the table only if it's directly on the table. If a block is on top of another block, then it's not on the table. So if we have white_block_1 on the table, and then stack grey_block_1 on it, white_block_1 remains on the table. But grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, so grey_block_1 is not on the table. So to have white_block_1 not on the table, we need to have it on top of another block. But initially, it's on grey_block_1, which is on the table. So white_block_1 is not on the table in the initial state. Wait, no. Wait, the initial state says "white_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1", which is on the table. So white_block_1 is on grey_block_1, not on the table. Therefore, white_block_1 is not on the table initially. So the constraint that "white_block_1 is not on the table" is already true in the initial state. Wait, but the constraint says that this must hold in at least one state. So if it's already true in the initial state, that's satisfied. However, the next part of the constraint says that if white_block_1 is not on the table in some state s, then in s or later, either holding purple_block_1 or brown_block_1 is not on the table.

In the initial state, white_block_1 is not on the table. So in the initial state s, we need to have either holding purple_block_1 (which we are not) or brown_block_1 is not on the table (which it is, since brown_block_1 is on purple_block_3). So brown_block_1 is not on the table (it's on purple_block_3), so the second condition is true. Therefore, in the initial state, the constraint is satisfied. So no problem here.

Next constraint: red_block_1 is not on top of itself in some state. Well, that's always true because a block can't be on top of itself. So this constraint is automatically satisfied. But the next part says that if red_block_1 is not on top of itself (which is always true), then grey_block_1 must be on top of white_block_1 in some state after. But in the initial state, grey_block_1 is on the table with white_block_1 on top. So in the initial state, white_block_1 is on grey_block_1. To satisfy the requirement, we need grey_block_1 on top of white_block_1. So we need to swap their positions. So we need to stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1. Which we did earlier when we unstacked white_block_1, put it down, picked up grey_block_1, and stacked it on white_block_1. So that satisfies this constraint.

Next constraint: purple_block_3 must be clear in some state. Initially, purple_block_3 has brown_block_1 on top, so it's not clear. After moving brown_block_1, purple_block_3 becomes clear. So when we unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_3, purple_block_3 becomes clear. So that's the state where it's clear. The next part says that if purple_block_3 is clear in some state, then in an earlier state, we were holding grey_block_1. So in our plan, after we stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1, we then proceed to move brown_block_1. When we unstack brown_block_1, purple_block_3 becomes clear. So the state where purple_block_3 is clear comes after holding grey_block_1 (when we stacked it on white_block_1). So that's satisfied.

Next constraint: purple_block_3 is not on top of red_block_1 in some state. Initially, purple_block_3 is on the table, so it's not on red_block_1. So this is already true. But the next part says that if purple_block_3 is not on red_block_1 (which is always true), then in that state or later, we must be holding white_block_1 or purple_block_3. Since in the initial state, we are not holding either, but later when we unstack white_block_1, we are holding it. So that's satisfied.

Final constraint: there's a state where white_block_1 is not clear (something on top) and purple_block_1 is clear. Wait, the constraint says "The following conditions are all true: there's a block on top of white_block_1 (white_block_1 not clear), and purple_block_1 is clear." In the initial state, purple_block_1 is not clear (red_block_1 is on it). So to satisfy this, we need to make purple_block_1 clear and white_block_1 not clear. How?

We can make purple_block_1 clear by removing red_block_1. But red_block_1 is under purple_block_2. So to remove red_block_1 from purple_block_1, we need to first unstack purple_block_2 from red_block_1, then unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1. Then, put red_block_1 somewhere else. Then purple_block_1 is clear. For white_block_1, we can stack something on it. For example, grey_block_1. But we already stacked grey_block_1 on white_block_1 in earlier steps, which makes white_block_1 not clear. So if we can arrange to have purple_block_1 clear and white_block_1 not clear in the same state, that would satisfy this constraint.

So let's see: after moving red_block_1 from purple_block_1, we can have purple_block_1 clear. Then, if white_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top, that's not clear. So if these two are true in the same state, that's good.

But this requires additional steps. Let's think about the steps.

First, to clear purple_block_1:

1. Unstack purple_block_2 from red_block_1 (holding purple_block_2)
2. Putdown purple_block_2
3. Unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1 (holding red_block_1)
4. Putdown red_block_1

Now, purple_block_1 is clear. But we also need white_block_1 to have a block on top. Earlier, we stacked grey_block_1 on white_block_1, so white_block_1 is not clear. So if we do these steps, then in the state after step 4, purple_block_1 is clear, and white_block_1 is not clear (since grey_block_1 is on it). That satisfies the final constraint.

But this adds several steps. However, the problem requires an optimal plan, so we need to minimize steps. So perhaps there's a way to achieve this without adding too many steps.

But let's recap all the steps we might need:

1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1 (now holding white_block_1)
2. Stack white_block_1 on grey_block_1? No, that's where it was. Wait, no. To stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1, we need to have white_block_1 on the table. So:

1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1 (hold white)
2. Putdown white_block_1 (now on table)
3. Pickup grey_block_1 (now hold grey)
4. Stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1 (now grey is on white, white is on table)

This makes white_block_1 not clear, and grey_block_1 not on the table. This satisfies the constraint for grey_block_1 not on the table earlier when needed for constraint 1.

Then, to satisfy the final constraint (white_block_1 not clear and purple_block_1 clear):

We need to clear purple_block_1. So:

5. Unstack purple_block_2 from red_block_1 (hold purple_block_2)
6. Putdown purple_block_2
7. Unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1 (hold red_block_1)
8. Putdown red_block_1 (now purple_block_1 is clear)

At this point, white_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top (not clear), and purple_block_1 is clear. So the final constraint is satisfied.

But all of this is before dealing with the main goal of moving brown_block_1 to the table. So now, after step 8, we have:

- purple_block_1 is clear (on table)
- red_block_1 is on table
- purple_block_2 is on table
- grey_block_1 is on white_block_1 (which is on table)
- purple_block_3 is on table with brown_block_1 on top (still)
- brown_block_1 is clear (since we haven't touched it yet)

So now, to move brown_block_1:

9. Unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_3 (hold brown_block_1)
10. Putdown brown_block_1 (goal achieved)

But wait, in step 9, when we unstack brown_block_1, purple_block_3 becomes clear. This satisfies the constraint that purple_block_3 is clear in some state (step 9's result), and earlier we held grey_block_1 in step 3, which is before step 9. So that's okay.

But also, when we unstack brown_block_1 (step 9), we are holding it. Then putting it down (step 10) achieves the goal.

Now, let's check all constraints again:

1. Brown_block_1 must be not clear in some state. In our plan, when did that happen? Actually, in this plan, brown_block_1 is only moved once, from purple_block_3 to table. So it's never had anything stacked on it. So constraint 1 is not satisfied. Oops, that's a problem. We need to have a state where brown_block_1 is not clear. So we need to stack something on it.

So perhaps after moving grey_block_1 to white_block_1, we need to stack something on brown_block_1. Let's adjust the plan.

After step 4 (stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1):

5. Pickup purple_block_2 (which is on table)
6. Stack purple_block_2 on brown_block_1 (now brown_block_1 is not clear)
7. Now, to unstack brown_block_1, we need to unstack purple_block_2 first.

So steps 7-10:

7. Unstack purple_block_2 from brown_block_1 (hold purple_block_2)
8. Putdown purple_block_2
9. Unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_3 (hold brown_block_1)
10. Putdown brown_block_1 (goal)

Now, in step 6, brown_block_1 is not clear. This satisfies constraint 1. And prior to that, in step 3, we picked up grey_block_1, which was moved off the table (stacked on white_block_1), satisfying the requirement that before brown_block_1 is not clear, either purple_block_3 is not on the table or grey_block_1 is not. Since grey_block_1 is not on the table after step 4, that's satisfied.

Now, let's check the other constraints again.

The final constraint (white_block_1 not clear and purple_block_1 clear) is achieved after step 8 (putdown purple_block_2) and after steps to clear purple_block_1.

Wait, in the current plan, steps to clear purple_block_1 (unstacking red_block_1) haven't been done yet. So we need to insert those steps.

So revised plan:

1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1 (hold white)
2. Putdown white_block_1
3. Pickup grey_block_1 (now hold grey)
4. Stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1 (grey on white)
5. Unstack purple_block_2 from red_block_1 (hold purple_block_2)
6. Putdown purple_block_2
7. Unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1 (hold red_block_1)
8. Putdown red_block_1 (now purple_block_1 is clear)
9. Pickup purple_block_2 (from step 6)
10. Stack purple_block_2 on brown_block_1 (now brown_block_1 is not clear)
11. Unstack purple_block_2 from brown_block_1 (hold purple_block_2)
12. Putdown purple_block_2
13. Unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_3 (hold brown_block_1)
14. Putdown brown_block_1 (goal)

Now, check constraints:

- Constraint 1: Step 10, brown_block_1 has purple_block_2 on it (not clear). Before that, step 3-4 moved grey_block_1 off the table. So satisfied.

- Constraint 2: If brown_block_1 is not clear (step 10), prior state had grey_block_1 not on table (step 4 onwards). Yes.

- Constraint 3: purple_block_1 not clear in initial state. But after step 8, purple_block_1 is clear. Wait, the constraint is that there must be at least one state where purple_block_1 is not clear. The initial state satisfies that. So no problem.

- Constraint 4: When purple_block_1 is not clear (initially and until step 8), we need to hold white_block_1 at some point after. We held white_block_1 in step 1, which is after the initial state. So satisfies.

- Constraint 5: white_block_1 not on table. In the initial state, white_block_1 is on grey_block_1 (not on table). So constraint is satisfied.

- Constraint 6: When white_block_1 is not on table (always true in initial state), then either holding purple_block_1 or brown_block_1 not on table. In initial state, brown_block_1 is on purple_block_3 (not on table), so condition satisfied.

- Constraint 7: red_block_1 not on itself. Always true. Then, grey_block_1 must be on white_block_1 in some state after. Step 4 achieves this.

- Constraint 8: purple_block_3 must be clear in some state. After step 13, when brown_block_1 is unstacked, purple_block_3 is clear. And earlier, step 3, we held grey_block_1. So satisfies.

- Constraint 9: purple_block_3 not on red_block_1 (always true), so must hold white_block_1 or purple_block_3 at some point. We held white_block_1 in step 1.

- Constraint 10: There's a state where white_block_1 is not clear (step 4 onwards) and purple_block_1 is clear (step 8 onwards). So after step 8, both conditions are true. So step 8's state satisfies this.

This seems to satisfy all constraints. Now, let's count the steps. The plan has 14 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, perhaps some steps can be optimized. For example, after step 5 (unstack purple_block_2 from red_block_1), can we stack it on brown_block_1 immediately instead of putting it down and picking it up again?

Let me see:

Alternative approach:

1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1
2. Stack white_block_1 on grey_block_1? No, because that would just put it back. Instead, put it down.

Wait, let me think of a different order.

Alternative plan:

1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1 (hold white)
2. Putdown white_block_1
3. Pickup grey_block_1 (hold grey)
4. Stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1 (now white is not clear, grey is not on table)
5. Unstack purple_block_2 from red_block_1 (hold purple_block_2)
6. Stack purple_block_2 on brown_block_1 (now brown_block_1 not clear)
7. Unstack purple_block_2 from brown_block_1 (hold purple_block_2)
8. Putdown purple_block_2
9. Unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_3 (hold brown_block_1)
10. Putdown brown_block_1 (goal)
11. Unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1 (hold red_block_1)
12. Putdown red_block_1 (now purple_block_1 is clear)

But this way, the step where purple_block_1 is cleared is after the goal. But the final constraint requires that there's a state where white_block_1 is not clear and purple_block_1 is clear. In this plan, step 12 makes purple_block_1 clear, and white_block_1 is not clear from step 4 onwards. So step 12's state satisfies this. But this plan has 12 steps. Is that better?

But also, we need to ensure that when purple_block_3 becomes clear (step 9), we held grey_block_1 earlier (step 3). Which we did.

But let's check all constraints again:

- Constraint 1: Step 6, brown_block_1 not clear. Prior state had grey_block_1 not on table (step 4 onwards). Yes.

- Constraint 3: purple_block_1 not clear in initial state. Then in step 11, we unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1, making it clear. So the state after step 12 has purple_block_1 clear. But the constraint is that there's at least one state where purple_block_1 is not clear (which is true initially). So no problem.

- Final constraint: white_block_1 not clear (from step 4) and purple_block_1 clear (after step 12). So in step 12's state, both conditions are met.

But this plan may still require 12 steps. However, the original plan had 14 steps, which is longer. So perhaps this is better.

But wait, in this alternative plan, do we need to unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1? Because the final constraint requires purple_block_1 to be clear. So yes, we need to do that. But in the initial state, purple_block_1 is not clear, and we need to have a state where it is clear. So steps 11 and 12 are necessary.

Alternatively, can we avoid moving red_block_1 and purple_block_2? Let's think.

The final constraint requires purple_block_1 to be clear. So we have to unstack red_block_1 from it. Which requires unstacking purple_block_2 first.

So the steps to clear purple_block_1 are necessary.

Alternatively, can we stack red_block_1 somewhere else instead of putting it down, but that would require more steps.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline the optimal plan step by step, ensuring all constraints are met with minimal steps.

Final plan steps:

1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1. (Pre: white is clear, we are not holding anything. Effects: hold white, grey_block_1 is clear.)
2. Putdown white_block_1. (Now white is on table, clear.)
3. Pickup grey_block_1. (Pre: grey is clear and on table. Effects: hold grey.)
4. Stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1. (Pre: hold grey, white is clear. Effects: grey on white, grey not held, white not clear.)
5. Unstack purple_block_2 from red_block_1. (Pre: purple_block_2 is clear. Effects: hold purple_block_2, red_block_1 becomes clear.)
6. Stack purple_block_2 on brown_block_1. (Pre: hold purple_block_2, brown_block_1 is clear. Effects: purple_block_2 on brown_block_1, brown_block_1 not clear.)
7. Unstack purple_block_2 from brown_block_1. (Pre: purple_block_2 is clear, holding nothing. Effects: hold purple_block_2, brown_block_1 becomes clear.)
8. Putdown purple_block_2. (Purple_block_2 on table.)
9. Unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1. (Pre: red_block_1 is clear. Effects: hold red_block_1, purple_block_1 becomes clear.)
10. Putdown red_block_1. (Red_block_1 on table.)
11. Unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_3. (Pre: brown_block_1 is clear. Effects: hold brown_block_1, purple_block_3 becomes clear.)
12. Putdown brown_block_1. (Goal achieved.)

Now, let's count the steps: 12 actions.

Check all constraints:

1. brown_block_1 not clear in step 6. Prior state: step 4 where grey_block_1 is not on table. Satisfied.

2. When brown_block_1 is not clear (step 6), prior state has grey_block_1 not on table (step 4 onwards). Yes.

3. purple_block_1 not clear in initial state. Satisfied.

4. When purple_block_1 is not clear (initially), after step 1, we held white_block_1. So satisfied.

5. white_block_1 not on table in initial state. Yes, since it's on grey_block_1. Satisfied.

6. When white_block_1 is not on table (always true), in initial state, brown_block_1 is not on table (it's on purple_block_3). So satisfied.

7. red_block_1 not on itself, so need grey_block_1 on white_block_1. Step 4 achieves this.

8. purple_block_3 clear in step 11. Prior state held grey_block_1 in step 3. Yes.

9. purple_block_3 not on red_block_1 (always true), and we held white_block_1 in step 1. Yes.

10. In step 10, after putting down red_block_1, purple_block_1 is clear. And white_block_1 is not clear (grey_block_1 is on it). So step 10's state satisfies the final constraint.

This seems to meet all constraints with 12 steps. Is there a shorter plan?

Alternatively, can we combine some steps?

For example, after step 6 (stack purple_block_2 on brown_block_1), we can unstack purple_block_2 and put it down, then unstack brown_block_1. But that's what we have.

Alternatively, after step 5 (unstack purple_block_2), can we stack it directly on brown_block_1 without putting it down? Yes, steps 5 and 6.

But then step 7 is unstacking purple_block_2 from brown_block_1.

Hmm, perhaps there's no way to make it shorter than 12 steps. But maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, what if after stacking grey_block_1 on white_block_1 (step 4), we then unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_3 and put it down. But brown_block_1 is on purple_block_3, which is clear. So we can unstack it immediately. But that would achieve the goal in fewer steps. But then we wouldn't satisfy the first constraint (brown_block_1 must be not clear at some state).

So we have to stack something on brown_block_1 and then unstack it, which adds steps. So the minimal steps required would be 12.

But let's think again. If we can find a way to make brown_block_1 not clear without moving purple_block_2, that could save steps. For example, using grey_block_1.

But grey_block_1 is stacked on white_block_1. So after step 4, grey_block_1 is on white_block_1. To stack it on brown_block_1, we'd need to unstack grey_block_1 from white_block_1, then stack it on brown_block_1. But that would add steps.

Alternatively, use purple_block_3. Wait, purple_block_3 is under brown_block_1. Can't stack on it.

Alternatively, use red_block_1. After moving red_block_1 from purple_block_1, we can stack it on brown_block_1. So:

Alternative steps:

1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1
2. Putdown white_block_1
3. Pickup grey_block_1
4. Stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1
5. Unstack purple_block_2 from red_block_1
6. Putdown purple_block_2
7. Unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1
8. Stack red_block_1 on brown_block_1 (now brown_block_1 not clear)
9. Unstack red_block_1 from brown_block_1
10. Putdown red_block_1
11. Unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_3
12. Putdown brown_block_1

This also has 12 steps. Not better.

Hmm. It seems that 12 steps is the minimum required to satisfy all constraints.

But let's check if any steps can be omitted. For example, after unstacking red_block_1 from purple_block_1 (step 9 in the original plan), can we use it somewhere else instead of putting it down, but that might not help.

Alternatively, after stacking grey_block_1 on white_block_1, perhaps we can use grey_block_1 to stack on brown_block_1. But that would require unstacking grey_block_1 from white_block_1, which adds steps.

Overall, I think the 12-step plan is the optimal one satisfying all constraints.
