**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1:** This clears red_block_1 and allows us to put black_block_2 on the table, which is needed to satisfy the constraint that when holding purple_block_1, black_block_2 must have been on the table in a prior state.

2. **Putdown black_block_2:** Places black_block_2 on the table, making it available for later stacking and satisfying the precondition for constraint 2.

3. **Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1:** This directly achieves the goal of making yellow_block_1 clear and satisfies the constraint requiring holding purple_block_1.

4. **Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_2:** Ensures purple_block_1 is not on the table (satisfies constraint 7) and positions it for the next action.

5. **Pickup black_block_3:** Prepares to stack it on purple_block_1.

6. **Stack black_block_3 on purple_block_1:** Makes purple_block_1 not clear (satisfies constraint 3) and ensures the condition involving purple_block_1â€™s non-clearity is met.

7. **Pickup red_block_1:** Satisfies the constraint requiring holding red_block_1 at least once.

8. **Putdown red_block_1:** Returns red_block_1 to the table, keeping the state valid.

9. **Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1:** Satisfies the constraint requiring holding yellow_block_1 or having blue_block_1 on the table (yellow_block_1 is now held).

10. **Putdown yellow_block_1:** Ensures yellow_block_1 remains clear (goal) and satisfies the constraint related to yellow_block_1 not being on the table initially.

11. **Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1:** Prepares blue_block_1 to be stacked elsewhere.

12. **Stack blue_block_1 on black_block_2:** Satisfies the constraint requiring blue_block_1 to be on black_block_2 or black_block_1 not on the table (blue_block_1 is now on black_block_2).

This plan is optimal as it achieves the goal and satisfies all constraints with the minimal necessary steps.
