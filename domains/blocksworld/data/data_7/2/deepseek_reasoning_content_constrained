Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to make sure that white_block_1 is clear in the final state. But there are a bunch of constraints we need to satisfy along the way. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the required conditions.

So, initially, we have:

- red_block_1 is on the table with grey_block_1 on top of it, and brown_block_1 on top of grey. So, the stack is red_block_1 ← grey_block_1 ← brown_block_1. Both brown and grey are clear? Wait, no. The initial state says brown_block_1 is clear (no block on top), and blue_block_1 is on white_block_1 and is clear. Also, orange_block_1 and orange_block_2 are on the table and clear. The arm is empty.

The goal is to have white_block_1 clear. Currently, blue_block_1 is on white_block_1. So to make white_block_1 clear, we need to remove blue_block_1 from on top of it. So the first thought is to unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 and put it somewhere else. But let's check the constraints.

Constraints:

1. At least one state must have orange_block_2 not clear (something on top).
2. Orange_block_1 must not be on the table in some state.
3. A state where the arm is holding red_block_1 and orange_block_2 is not clear.
4. Brown_block_1 not on the table in some state.
5. If brown_block_1 is not on the table in state s, then in s or later, the arm must hold orange_block_1.
6. A state where grey_block_1 is on white_block_1 and red_block_1 is clear.
7. Brown_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2 in some state.
8. If brown_block_1 is not on orange_block_2 in s, then orange_block_2 is not on the table in s or later.
9. Orange_block_2 is not on the table in some state.

So the plan must satisfy all these. Let's see how to integrate these constraints.

First, the main goal is to remove blue_block_1 from white_block_1. Let's start with that. So unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 and put it down. But wait, unstack requires that the arm is empty and that blue_block_1 is clear (which it is). So unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1. Then put it down. But putting it down would make white_block_1 clear. But wait, the goal is to have white_block_1 clear, so after that, we're done. But we need to satisfy all constraints. So let's see:

But maybe putting blue_block_1 on another block instead of the table could help satisfy some constraints. But let's think.

First, the main steps would be unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1, then put it down. But let's check the constraints.

Looking at constraint 6: need a state where grey_block_1 is on white_block_1 and red_block_1 is clear. Currently, grey_block_1 is on red_block_1. So to get grey_block_1 onto white_block_1, we need to move it. That would require first unstacking brown_block_1 from grey_block_1, then unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1, then stack grey on white. Then red_block_1 would be clear, which satisfies part of constraint 6.

But doing that would require handling the brown_block_1. Let's see. The brown_block_1 is on grey_block_1. To move grey_block_1, we need to first remove brown_block_1. So unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1, then put it down or stack it somewhere else.

But let's also consider constraint 4: brown_block_1 must not be on the table in some state. Wait, no: the constraint says "brown_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in at least one state. So brown_block_1 is currently on top of grey_block_1 (so not on the table). So in the initial state, brown_block_1 is not on the table. So constraint 4 is already satisfied? Wait, initial state: brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1. So yes, brown_block_1 is not on the table. So constraint 4 is already met. Wait, but the problem says the original state is as described, so the initial state already has brown_block_1 not on the table. Therefore, constraint 4 is already satisfied. So we don't need to do anything for that. But wait, the problem says "must hold in at least one state" — which could be the initial state. So perhaps that's already taken care of. But the problem says "the original state" is given, and the constraints are about the states in the plan. So the initial state is part of the plan's states. Therefore, constraint 4 is already satisfied because in the initial state, brown_block_1 is not on the table.

But let's confirm. The initial state has brown_block_1 on grey_block_1, so it's not on the table. So constraint 4 is already met. So we don't need to do anything for that. But constraint 5: if in some state s, brown_block_1 is not on the table, then in s or later, the arm must hold orange_block_1. Since in the initial state s0, brown_block_1 is not on the table, then in s0 or later, the arm must hold orange_block_1. But in s0, the arm is not holding anything. So in the plan, at some point after s0, the arm must hold orange_block_1. So we need to ensure that after the initial state, there's a step where we hold orange_block_1. Because the initial state already satisfies the "brown_block_1 not on table", which triggers constraint 5.

So we have to make sure that at some point, the arm is holding orange_block_1. So we need to pick up orange_block_1 at some point.

Similarly, constraint 2 requires that orange_block_1 is not on the table in some state. Since initially it's on the table, we need to move it. So perhaps pick it up and stack it somewhere, or put it down again. But since the final state doesn't require orange_block_1 to be anywhere specific, but we just need to have it not on the table in some state.

So let's think: moving orange_block_1 off the table (i.e., stacking it on another block) and then maybe moving it back. But maybe we can do that as part of other operations.

Now, constraint 3 requires a state where the arm is holding red_block_1 and orange_block_2 is not clear (i.e., has a block on top). So we need to pick up red_block_1, and have orange_block_2 have a block on top. So perhaps stack something on orange_block_2.

Constraint 1: orange_block_2 must have a block on top in some state. So we need to stack a block on orange_block_2. Let's say we stack something on it, then maybe unstack it later.

Constraint 7: brown_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2 in some state. Currently, brown_block_1 is on grey_block_1, so it's not on orange_block_2. So the initial state already satisfies constraint 7. But the problem says "must hold in at least one state". So the initial state counts. Therefore, constraint 7 is already met. But then, constraint 8 says that if in state s, brown_block_1 is not on orange_block_2, then in s or later, orange_block_2 is not on the table. Since the initial state s0 has brown_block_1 not on orange_block_2, then in s0 or later, orange_block_2 must not be on the table. Initially, orange_block_2 is on the table. So we need to have a state after s0 where orange_block_2 is not on the table. But constraint 9 also requires that in some state, orange_block_2 is not on the table. So combining constraints 8 and 9: we need to move orange_block_2 from the table to a block. So stack something on it, or stack it on another block. Wait, no. To make orange_block_2 not on the table, it needs to be on top of another block. So someone needs to pick it up and stack it on another block. But orange_block_2 is initially clear. So we can pick it up and stack it on some other block.

But orange_block_2 is on the table. To pick it up, we need to have it clear (which it is) and the arm empty. So we can do that.

But let's plan step by step, integrating all constraints.

First, the main goal is to clear white_block_1. So remove blue_block_1 from it. Let's start with that.

1. unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1. Then, the arm is holding blue_block_1. Then put it down on the table. That would make white_block_1 clear. But wait, that's two steps: unstack and putdown. But after that, the goal is achieved, but the constraints may not be. Let's check.

But this would not satisfy the constraints. Let's see:

After unstacking blue_block_1 from white_block_1 and putting it down, the constraints:

- Constraint 1: need a state where orange_block_2 is not clear. So we need to stack something on orange_block_2. So perhaps stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2. Then later unstack it if needed.

But let's see:

Suppose after unstacking blue_block_1, instead of putting it down, stack it on orange_block_2. That way, orange_block_2 is not clear (satisfies constraint 1), and orange_block_2 is not on the table (since it has a block on top, but orange_block_2 is on the table. Wait, no: if orange_block_2 is on the table and we stack blue_block_1 on it, then orange_block_2 is still on the table, but now has a block on top. So orange_block_2 is on the table but not clear. So that's allowed. But constraint 9 requires that orange_block_2 is not on the table in some state. So just stacking something on it doesn't take it off the table. So we need to have orange_block_2 not on the table, which would require moving it on top of another block.

Wait, no. If a block is on the table, you can't have another block under it. So to make orange_block_2 not on the table, you have to stack it on another block. But since orange_block_2 is on the table initially, to move it, you need to pick it up and stack it on another block. But in the initial state, orange_block_2 is clear, so it's possible.

So let's plan to pick up orange_block_2 and stack it on some block. For example, stack it on orange_block_1. Then, orange_block_2 is not on the table (it's on orange_block_1), satisfying constraint 9 and 8. But when we stack orange_block_2 on another block, that block must be clear. So, say, stack orange_block_2 on orange_block_1. But orange_block_1 is on the table and clear. So we can stack orange_block_2 on orange_block_1. Then, orange_block_2 is not on the table (satisfies constraint 9), and in that state, orange_block_1 is not clear (since orange_block_2 is on it), which may not matter. But this would require:

pickup orange_block_2, stack orange_block_2 orange_block_1.

But also, we need to satisfy constraint 3: a state where the arm is holding red_block_1 and orange_block_2 is not clear. So if we stack something on orange_block_2, then in some state, orange_block_2 is not clear. Alternatively, if we stack orange_block_2 on another block, then in that state, orange_block_2 is not clear (since something is on top of it). Wait, no. If we stack something on top of orange_block_2, then orange_block_2 is not clear. If we stack orange_block_2 on top of another block, then orange_block_2 is clear (since nothing is on top of it), but the block below is not clear.

Wait, the definition of "clear": a block is clear if there's nothing on top of it. So if we stack block A on block B, then B is not clear, and A is clear (assuming nothing is on A). So, stacking orange_block_2 on orange_block_1 would make orange_block_1 not clear, and orange_block_2 clear. To make orange_block_2 not clear, we need to put a block on top of it. So, perhaps stack another block on orange_block_2. For example, stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2. Then, orange_block_2 is not clear (constraint 1 satisfied). Also, to have orange_block_2 not on the table (constraint 9), we need to move it from the table to another block. So perhaps stack orange_block_2 on some block, then stack another block on it. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe stack orange_block_2 on another block, and then stack something else on orange_block_2. But that would take more steps.

Alternatively, to satisfy constraint 9 (orange_block_2 not on table), we can stack orange_block_2 on some block. Let's say we stack orange_block_2 on red_block_1. But red_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top. Wait, in the initial state, red_block_1 has grey_block_1, which has brown_block_1. So red_block_1 is under grey and brown. So to stack orange_block_2 on red_block_1, we need to clear red_block_1 first. Which would require unstacking brown and grey. Hmm, that could be part of the plan to get grey onto white_block_1 as per constraint 6.

Wait, constraint 6 requires a state where grey_block_1 is on white_block_1 and red_block_1 is clear. So to do that, we need to move grey_block_1 from red_block_1 to white_block_1. To do that, first unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1, then unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1, then stack grey on white. Then, red_block_1 is clear (satisfies part of constraint 6). So after that, red_block_1 is clear. Then, perhaps stack orange_block_2 on red_block_1. But then orange_block_2 is not on the table (satisfies constraint 9). Also, when we stack orange_block_2 on red_block_1, red_block_1 is clear, so that's allowed. Then, maybe stack something else on orange_block_2 to make it not clear (for constraint 1). But this could get complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps use orange_block_2 in another way. Let's try to outline the steps needed to satisfy all constraints and then the main goal.

Let's list all constraints and the steps needed:

1. At least one state where orange_block_2 is not clear. So stack something on orange_block_2, or stack orange_block_2 under another block.

Wait, no. If we stack something on orange_block_2, then orange_block_2 is not clear. If we stack orange_block_2 under another block (like stacking X on orange_block_2), then orange_block_2 is not clear. So to satisfy constraint 1, we need to have a block on orange_block_2 at some point.

2. Orange_block_1 not on the table in some state. So need to pick it up and stack it somewhere.

3. State where holding red_block_1 and orange_block_2 is not clear. So we need to have red_block_1 in hand while orange_block_2 has a block on top.

4. Brown_block_1 not on table (already satisfied in initial state).

5. If brown_block_1 is not on table (which is always true except if we put it on table), then in that state or later, hold orange_block_1. Since brown_block_1 starts off not on the table, we need to hold orange_block_1 at least once in the plan.

6. State with grey on white and red clear.

7. Brown_block_1 not on orange_block_2 (already true in initial state, so constraint 7 satisfied).

8. If brown_block_1 is not on orange_block_2 (which is always true), then in that state or later, orange_block_2 is not on table. So need to move orange_block_2 off the table.

9. Orange_block_2 not on table in some state.

So constraints 8 and 9 are linked. Since in all states after the initial, brown_block_1 is not on orange_block_2 (unless we move it there), but constraint 7 requires that in some state, brown_block_1 is not on orange_block_2, which is already met. So regardless, we need to have orange_block_2 not on the table in some state (constraint 9). So moving orange_block_2 off the table is required.

So, steps required:

- Move orange_block_2 off the table (stack on another block).

- Ensure that orange_block_1 is moved off the table at some point.

- Ensure that the arm holds orange_block_1 (due to constraint 5).

- Ensure that there's a state where the arm holds red_block_1 and orange_block_2 is not clear.

- Ensure that grey_block_1 is moved to white_block_1, making red_block_1 clear.

Now, let's try to construct the plan step by step.

First, the main goal is to clear white_block_1. So we need to remove blue_block_1 from it. Let's do that first:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1. Now holding blue_block_1.

But then, we can stack it somewhere. Let's stack it on orange_block_2 to satisfy constraint 1 (orange_block_2 not clear). But first, we need to make sure orange_block_2 is clear. Initially, it is. So:

2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_2. Now, orange_block_2 has blue_block_1 on top (not clear). This satisfies constraint 1. Also, blue_block_1 is now on orange_block_2, so white_block_1 is clear. But wait, the main goal is to have white_block_1 clear. So after step 2, white_block_1 is clear. So the main goal is achieved. But we need to check if all constraints are satisfied.

But let's check the constraints:

- Constraint 1: yes, blue_block_1 is on orange_block_2, so orange_block_2 not clear.

- Constraint 2: orange_block_1 is still on the table. Need to move it.

- Constraint 3: need a state where holding red_block_1 and orange_block_2 is not clear. In step 2, orange_block_2 is not clear, but the arm is not holding red_block_1. So we need to have a step where we pick up red_block_1 while orange_block_2 is not clear.

- Constraint 5: since brown_block_1 is not on the table (initial state), we need to hold orange_block_1 at some point.

- Constraint 6: need grey on white_block_1 and red clear. Not yet.

- Constraint 9: orange_block_2 is still on the table (since we stacked blue on it). Because orange_block_2 is on the table with blue on top. So orange_block_2 is on the table, so constraint 9 is not met. Oh, right! Because constraint 9 requires orange_block_2 not on the table. So stacking blue on orange_block_2 doesn't move orange_block_2 off the table; it's still on the table. So we need to move orange_block_2 itself off the table.

So, to satisfy constraints 8 and 9, we must move orange_block_2 off the table. That requires picking up orange_block_2 and stacking it on another block. So let's do that:

But first, we need to clear orange_block_2. But after step 2, blue_block_1 is on orange_block_2, so orange_block_2 is not clear. So to unstack blue_block_1 from orange_block_2, but that's possible if we are holding nothing. So:

3. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_2. Now holding blue_block_1, orange_block_2 is clear again.

4. putdown blue_block_1. Now blue is on table, arm is empty.

5. pickup orange_block_2. Now holding orange_block_2.

6. stack orange_block_2 some_block. Let's choose orange_block_1. So stack orange_block_2 orange_block_1. Now, orange_block_2 is on orange_block_1, so not on the table (satisfies constraint 9). Also, after stacking, orange_block_1 is not clear (has orange_block_2 on top), which satisfies constraint 2 (orange_block_1 is not on the table? No, orange_block_1 is still on the table. Wait, no. If a block is on the table, even if something is stacked on it, it's still on the table. Wait no: when you stack a block on another block, the lower block is on the table only if it's directly on the table. So if we stack orange_block_2 on orange_block_1, then orange_block_1 is on the table, and orange_block_2 is on orange_block_1. So orange_block_1 is still on the table. Therefore, constraint 2 (orange_block_1 not on table) is not satisfied. So we need to move orange_block_1 off the table. To do that, we need to pick it up and stack it somewhere else. But orange_block_1 is under orange_block_2 now. Wait, no. After step 6, orange_block_2 is on orange_block_1. So orange_block_1 is on the table, with orange_block_2 on top. So to pick up orange_block_1, we need to first remove orange_block_2. But we can't, because orange_block_2 is on top. So we need to unstack orange_block_2 from orange_block_1 first. So:

But this complicates things. Alternatively, stack orange_block_2 on a different block. Let's say instead of stacking on orange_block_1, stack orange_block_2 on red_block_1. But red_block_1 is under grey and brown. To stack on red_block_1, we need to clear it. Which requires unstacking brown and grey. But that could be part of moving grey to white_block_1 as per constraint 6.

So, let's adjust the plan to move orange_block_2 onto a block that's not on the table. But that's not possible unless the block is on the table. Wait, no. To stack orange_block_2 on a block that's not on the table, that block must be clear. For example, if we have a tower like A on B on table, then B is on the table. So stacking orange_block_2 on B would make B not on the table anymore? No. If B is on the table and we stack A on B, then B is still on the table. So the only way to get a block off the table is to pick it up and put it on another block. So to get orange_block_2 off the table, we need to stack it on another block that's on the table. Wait, no. Wait, when you stack block X on block Y which is on the table, X is on Y, and Y is on the table. So X is not on the table, but Y is. So stacking X on Y takes X off the table. So to get orange_block_2 off the table, stack it on any other block. For example, stack orange_block_2 on red_block_1. But red_block_1 is under grey and brown. So we need to clear red_block_1.

Alternatively, stack orange_block_2 on white_block_1. But white_block_1 needs to be clear for the goal. So after stacking, we would have to remove it again.

Alternatively, stack orange_block_2 on orange_block_1. Then orange_block_2 is not on the table (it's on orange_block_1, which is on the table). Wait, no. If orange_block_1 is on the table, then stacking orange_block_2 on it makes orange_block_2 not on the table. Wait, no. The block is on the table if it's placed directly on the table. If it's on another block, even if that block is on the table, the upper block is not on the table. So stacking orange_block_2 on orange_block_1 (which is on the table) would make orange_block_2 not on the table. So that satisfies constraint 9. So step 6: stack orange_block_2 orange_block_1. Then, orange_block_2 is not on the table. Also, orange_block_1 is now under orange_block_2. So orange_block_1 is still on the table. So to satisfy constraint 2 (orange_block_1 not on the table), we need to move orange_block_1. But since orange_block_2 is on top of it, we can't pick up orange_block_1 until we move orange_block_2. So perhaps we need to first stack orange_block_2 on another block, then pick up orange_block_1.

Alternatively, find another way to get orange_block_1 off the table. Maybe stack orange_block_1 on another block. Let's say after moving grey_block_1 to white_block_1, we can stack orange_block_1 on red_block_1 (which is then clear). But this requires steps.

Let me try to outline the steps again, integrating all constraints.

First, handle the main goal: clear white_block_1 by removing blue_block_1.

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1. Now holding blue_block_1.

But we need to satisfy constraint 3 (holding red_block_1 and orange_block_2 not clear). So perhaps after this, stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2 to make orange_block_2 not clear (satisfy constraint 1), then later pick up red_block_1.

But also need to move orange_block_2 off the table for constraint 9.

Alternative approach:

- unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1, put it down. Then white_block_1 is clear. But we still need to handle constraints.

But perhaps it's better to handle the constraints first, then the goal.

Wait, the final state must have white_block_1 clear. So the last action must leave white_block_1 clear. So the steps that affect white_block_1 must be done in such a way that in the final state, nothing is on it. So the main action could be unstacking blue_block_1 and putting it somewhere else.

But let's see. If we unstack blue_block_1 and stack it on orange_block_2, then white_block_1 is clear, but orange_block_2 has a block on top (satisfies constraint 1). Then, later, we can move blue_block_1 again if needed.

But for constraint 9, we need to have orange_block_2 not on the table. So after stacking blue on orange_block_2, orange_block_2 is still on the table. So that doesn't help. So we need to move orange_block_2 itself off the table.

So steps:

After unstacking blue_block_1:

2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_2. Now, orange_block_2 has blue on top (constraint 1 satisfied). But orange_block_2 is still on the table. So to satisfy constraint 9, we need to move orange_block_2.

But how? To move orange_block_2, which has blue on top, we need to first remove blue_block_1.

3. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_2. Now holding blue_block_1.

4. putdown blue_block_1. Now blue is on table.

5. pickup orange_block_2. Now holding orange_block_2.

6. stack orange_block_2 some_block. Let's choose orange_block_1. Then, orange_block_2 is on orange_block_1 (not on table, satisfies constraint 9). Now, orange_block_1 has orange_block_2 on top. But orange_block_1 is still on the table. So to satisfy constraint 2 (orange_block_1 not on table), we need to move orange_block_1. But since orange_block_2 is on top of it, we have to first unstack orange_block_2.

7. unstack orange_block_2 orange_block_1. Now holding orange_block_2.

8. stack orange_block_2 somewhere else. Maybe on red_block_1. But red_block_1 has grey and brown on top. So we need to clear red_block_1 first.

This is getting complicated. Let's think differently.

Perhaps it's better to first handle the grey_block_1 moving to white_block_1, which is needed for constraint 6. To do that:

- Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1.

- Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1.

- Stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1.

This would make red_block_1 clear (satisfies part of constraint 6) and grey on white.

So steps:

1. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1. Now holding brown_block_1.

2. putdown brown_block_1. Now brown is on table. Wait, but constraint 5 says that if brown_block_1 is not on table (which it was initially), but after putting it down, it's on the table. So in the state after step 2, brown_block_1 is on the table. So in that state, the constraint 5 applies? Because constraint 5 says if in a state s, brown_block_1 is not on table, then in s or later, hold orange_block_1. But in step 2, brown_block_1 is on the table, so the condition of constraint 5 is not triggered. Only in states where brown_block_1 is not on the table. Since the initial state satisfies that, we need to ensure that in the plan, we hold orange_block_1 after the initial state.

But back to the steps:

3. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1. Now holding grey_block_1.

4. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1. Now grey is on white, red_block_1 is clear. Satisfies constraint 6.

Now, red_block_1 is clear, so we can pick it up. Which is needed for constraint 3 (holding red_block_1 while orange_block_2 is not clear).

But we need to handle the blue_block_1 on white_block_1. Wait, no. Initially, blue_block_1 is on white_block_1. But in step 4, we stacked grey_block_1 on white_block_1. So now white_block_1 has grey_block_1, which has brown_block_1 (if we had moved brown_block_1 back?), wait no. Let me retrace:

In step 1, unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1. Then step 2, putdown brown_block_1. So brown is on table. Step 3, unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1. Now grey is in hand. Step 4, stack grey on white_block_1. So now, white_block_1 has grey_block_1, and grey has nothing on top. Then, blue_block_1 is still on white_block_1. Wait, no. Wait, initially, blue_block_1 is on white_block_1. When we stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1, we can't do that because white_block_1 already has blue_block_1. Oh, right! Because in the initial state, white_block_1 has blue_block_1 on top. So in step 4, trying to stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1 is impossible because white_block_1 is not clear (blue_block_1 is on it). So I forgot about the blue_block_1 on white_block_1. So this approach won't work. So to stack grey on white_block_1, we need to first remove blue_block_1. So the correct order is:

First, unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1, then stack grey on white.

So revised steps:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1. Arm holds blue_block_1.

2. putdown blue_block_1. Now blue is on table.

3. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1. Arm holds brown_block_1.

4. putdown brown_block_1. Brown on table.

5. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1. Arm holds grey_block_1.

6. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1. Now white_block_1 has grey_block_1, which is clear. Red_block_1 is clear. Satisfies constraint 6.

Now, the main goal is achieved: white_block_1 has grey_block_1, which is clear. So white_block_1 is not clear? Wait, no. The goal is to have white_block_1 clear. Wait, no: the goal is that "there is no block on top of white_block_1". But after step 6, grey_block_1 is on white_block_1. So the goal is not achieved. Oh! The goal is to make white_block_1 clear, i.e., nothing on top. But currently, after step 6, grey_block_1 is on white_block_1, so white_block_1 is not clear. So the main goal is not achieved. So this approach is wrong.

Ah, I see the confusion. The main goal is to have white_block_1 clear. So we need to remove any block from on top of white_block_1. In the initial state, blue_block_1 is on white_block_1. So the main goal is to remove blue_block_1 from white_block_1 and not have anything else placed on it. So steps 1 and 2 achieve that. But then, stacking grey_block_1 on white_block_1 would negate the goal. So the steps must not stack anything on white_block_1 after removing blue_block_1.

So the correct approach is:

Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 and put it down. Then, white_block_1 is clear. But we still need to handle the constraints.

But then, how do we handle constraint 6, which requires a state where grey_block_1 is on white_block_1 and red_block_1 is clear. So even though the final state doesn't need grey on white, we need at least one state where grey is on white. So perhaps we can stack grey on white and then unstack it, returning it to red_block_1. But that would take extra steps.

But let's proceed.

Main goal steps:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1. Holding blue.

2. putdown blue_block_1. Now white_block_1 is clear. Main goal achieved. But need to handle constraints.

But now, we need to ensure all constraints are met.

Constraint 6 requires a state where grey is on white and red is clear. So we need to have grey on white at some point.

So, perhaps after step 2, we can move grey to white, then move it back.

Let's try:

3. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1. Now holding brown.

4. putdown brown_block_1.

5. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1. Now holding grey.

6. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1. Now grey is on white. Red is clear. This satisfies constraint 6.

7. unstack grey_block_1 white_block_1. Now holding grey.

8. stack grey_block_1 red_block_1. Now grey is back on red. But this adds steps. But maybe necessary.

Now, after step 6, we have the state required by constraint 6. Then, we can proceed to other steps.

But this makes the plan longer. But since we need an optimal plan (shortest possible), perhaps there's a way to integrate these steps without redundant actions.

Alternatively, find a way to have grey on white without needing to move it back, but that would leave grey on white, which isn't required by the final goal. But the final goal only requires white_block_1 clear. So if grey is on white_block_1, the goal is not achieved. So we have to move grey away again. So steps 6 and 7 are necessary.

But this is getting too long. Let's think of another way.

Alternatively, after moving grey to white_block_1 (step 6), then move it somewhere else. But that's extra steps.

Alternatively, after step 6 (grey on white), leave it there and move blue_block_1 to another location. But that would require unstacking grey_block_1 from white_block_1, which isn't needed unless we need to clear white_block_1. But the final goal requires white_block_1 to be clear, so after step 6, we need to remove grey_block_1 from white_block_1. Hence, steps 7 and 8.

But this adds four steps (3-8) just to satisfy constraint 6. Is there a way to avoid that?

Alternatively, perhaps stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1 temporarily and then move it back. But this would require several steps.

Alternatively, find a different approach to satisfy constraint 6 without affecting the final goal.

But perhaps it's unavoidable. Let's proceed.

So steps so far:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1.

2. putdown blue_block_1.

3. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1.

4. putdown brown_block_1.

5. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1.

6. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1.

7. unstack grey_block_1 white_block_1.

8. stack grey_block_1 red_block_1.

9. pickup brown_block_1.

10. stack brown_block_1 grey_block_1.

Now, after step 10, the original stack is restored (red ← grey ← brown), and white_block_1 is clear. But this is too many steps, and the plan may not be optimal.

But this approach handles constraint 6 but is lengthy. Let's check if all constraints are met.

Constraint 6: step 6 has grey on white and red clear.

Constraint 3: need to hold red_block_1 while orange_block_2 is not clear. How?

At some point, we need to pick up red_block_1. But red_block_1 is under grey and brown. So to pick up red_block_1, we need to unstack grey and brown. Which would require steps similar to 3-5. But this would be redundant.

Alternatively, after step 5 (holding grey_block_1), we can stack it somewhere else, perhaps on orange_block_2. Then, orange_block_2 is not clear (constraint 1). Then, we can pickup red_block_1 (since it's clear after step 5). But after step 5, red_block_1 is clear. So step 6: stack grey_block_1 orange_block_2. Now orange_block_2 has grey on top (constraint 1 satisfied). Then, we can pickup red_block_1 (since it's clear). Step 7: pickup red_block_1. Now holding red_block_1. At this point, orange_block_2 has grey on top (not clear). So this satisfies constraint 3.

Then, we need to put red_block_1 somewhere. Maybe stack it on another block. But this adds steps.

But let's outline:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1.

2. putdown blue_block_1.

3. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1.

4. putdown brown_block_1.

5. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1.

6. stack grey_block_1 orange_block_2. Now, orange_block_2 has grey on top (constraint 1). Also, orange_block_2 is on the table, so constraint 9 is not met yet. Need to move orange_block_2 off the table.

7. pickup red_block_1. Now holding red_block_1. At this step, constraint 3 is satisfied: holding red_block_1 and orange_block_2 is not clear (grey is on it).

8. stack red_block_1 somewhere. Let's say on table.

9. putdown red_block_1. Now red is on table.

But this step seems unnecessary. Alternatively, stack red_block_1 on another block.

But regardless, we need to satisfy constraint 9: orange_block_2 not on table. So we need to move orange_block_2.

Since grey is on orange_block_2, we need to unstack grey_block_1 from orange_block_2.

10. unstack grey_block_1 orange_block_2. Now holding grey_block_1.

11. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1. Now grey is on white, satisfying constraint 6.

12. unstack grey_block_1 white_block_1. To clear white_block_1.

13. stack grey_block_1 red_block_1. Now grey is back on red.

14. pickup brown_block_1 and stack it back on grey.

But this is getting too long. Also, we need to handle moving orange_block_2 off the table.

This is very complex. Perhaps there's a smarter way.

Let's try to integrate multiple constraints into single steps.

Constraint 3 requires holding red_block_1 and orange_block_2 not clear. So during this step, orange_block_2 has a block on top. Let's plan to stack something on orange_block_2 and then pick up red_block_1 while that block is still there.

For example:

- Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2 (satisfies constraint 1).

- Then, unstack brown and grey to pick up red_block_1.

But how?

Alternatively, after moving grey to white_block_1, red_block_1 is clear. So we can pick up red_block_1.

But let's outline:

Steps:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1.

2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_2. Now, orange_block_2 has blue (constraint 1), and blue is not on white (goal achieved).

3. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1.

4. putdown brown_block_1.

5. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1.

6. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1. Now, grey is on white and red is clear (constraint 6).

7. pickup red_block_1. Now holding red_block_1. At this step, orange_block_2 has blue on top (not clear). So constraint 3 is satisfied.

8. stack red_block_1 somewhere. Maybe on brown_block_1.

But brown_block_1 is on the table. So:

8. stack red_block_1 brown_block_1. Now red is on brown. But brown is on the table. So red is not on the table.

But this is allowed. After stacking, the arm is empty.

Now, we need to handle constraint 9: orange_block_2 not on table. Currently, orange_block_2 is on the table with blue on top. So to make orange_block_2 not on the table, we need to move it. But how? It has blue on top. So first unstack blue_block_1 from orange_block_2.

9. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_2. Now holding blue_block_1.

10. putdown blue_block_1.

11. pickup orange_block_2. Now holding orange_block_2.

12. stack orange_block_2 some_block. Let's choose orange_block_1. Now, orange_block_2 is not on the table (constraint 9 satisfied). Also, orange_block_1 has orange_block_2 on top, so it's not clear. But orange_block_1 is still on the table. So to satisfy constraint 2 (orange_block_1 not on table), we need to move it.

13. unstack orange_block_2 orange_block_1. Now holding orange_block_2.

14. stack orange_block_2 somewhere else. Maybe on red_block_1.

But red_block_1 is on brown_block_1. So stack orange_block_2 red_block_1.

15. stack orange_block_2 red_block_1. Now, orange_block_2 is on red_block_1, which is on brown_block_1. But we need to ensure that the blocks are clear for stacking. red_block_1 is clear (since we stacked red_block_1 on brown_block_1 in step 8). So step 15 is possible.

Now, orange_block_2 is not on the table (satisfies constraint 9).

But this is getting very long. Also, we need to ensure that constraint 5 is satisfied: whenever brown_block_1 is not on the table, we must hold orange_block_1 at some point. Since brown_block_1 is on the table (step 4), except in the initial state. So constraint 5 applies to the initial state. Therefore, we need to hold orange_block_1 at some point after the initial state.

But in the current steps, we haven't held orange_block_1 yet. So we need to pick up orange_block_1.

Let's see. After step 12, orange_block_2 is stacked on orange_block_1. To pick up orange_block_1, we need to first unstack orange_block_2.

But in step 13, we unstack orange_block_2 and stack it on red_block_1. So after step 15, orange_block_1 is on the table and clear. So we can pick it up.

16. pickup orange_block_1. Now holding orange_block_1. This satisfies constraint 5 (since we held orange_block_1 after the initial state).

17. stack orange_block_1 somewhere. Maybe on table again. But that would put it back, which doesn't help constraint 2. Alternatively, stack it on another block.

But constraint 2 requires that orange_block_1 is not on the table in some state. So stacking it on another block would satisfy that. Let's stack it on blue_block_1.

17. stack orange_block_1 blue_block_1. Now, orange_block_1 is on blue_block_1, which is on the table. So orange_block_1 is not on the table (satisfies constraint 2).

Now, all constraints are satisfied:

- Constraint 1: blue on orange_block_2 in steps 2-9.

- Constraint 2: orange_block_1 not on table in step 17.

- Constraint 3: step 7 holds red_block_1 while orange_block_2 has blue on it (step 2-9).

- Constraint 4: satisfied initially.

- Constraint 5: step 16 holds orange_block_1.

- Constraint 6: step 6.

- Constraint 7: satisfied initially.

- Constraint 8 and 9: after step 15, orange_block_2 is not on table.

This is a very long plan, but let's count the steps:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1

2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_2

3. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1

4. putdown brown_block_1

5. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1

6. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1

7. pickup red_block_1

8. stack red_block_1 brown_block_1

9. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_2

10. putdown blue_block_1

11. pickup orange_block_2

12. stack orange_block_2 orange_block_1

13. unstack orange_block_2 orange_block_1

14. stack orange_block_2 red_block_1

15. pickup orange_block_1

16. stack orange_block_1 blue_block_1

That's 16 steps. But the problem requires an optimal plan, which is the shortest possible. This seems too long. Perhaps there's a shorter way.

Let me think of a more optimal path.

Alternative approach:

- Use orange_block_2 to satisfy multiple constraints.

Let's try to stack orange_block_2 on red_block_1, which requires clearing red_block_1 first. But red_block_1 is under grey and brown. So steps to clear red_block_1:

1. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1.

2. putdown brown_block_1.

3. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1.

4. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is not clear, but we need to clear it later.

But the goal is to have white_block_1 clear. So we need to unstack grey_block_1 later.

But this is getting complicated. Let's think of another way.

Let's focus on the main goal first: clear white_block_1 by unstacking blue_block_1. Then, use blue_block_1 to satisfy other constraints.

Steps:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1.

2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_2. Now, orange_block_2 not clear (constraint 1). Also, white_block_1 is clear (goal achieved).

Now, to satisfy constraint 3: need to hold red_block_1 while orange_block_2 is not clear (currently the case). So, pick up red_block_1. But red_block_1 is under grey and brown. So we need to unstack brown and grey.

3. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1.

4. putdown brown_block_1.

5. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1.

6. pickup red_block_1. Now holding red_block_1. At this step, orange_block_2 has blue on top (constraint 3 satisfied).

7. stack red_block_1 somewhere. Let's put it down.

8. putdown red_block_1.

Now, we need to move orange_block_2 off the table (constraint 9). So:

9. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_2.

10. putdown blue_block_1.

11. pickup orange_block_2.

12. stack orange_block_2 orange_block_1. Now, orange_block_2 is not on the table (constraint 9). Also, orange_block_1 is under orange_block_2, so orange_block_1 is still on the table. So to satisfy constraint 2, we need to move orange_block_1.

13. unstack orange_block_2 orange_block_1.

14. stack orange_block_2 somewhere else, like red_block_1.

15. pickup orange_block_1.

16. stack orange_block_1 somewhere, like brown_block_1.

Now, let's count the steps:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1

2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_2

3. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1

4. putdown brown_block_1

5. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1

6. pickup red_block_1

7. putdown red_block_1

8. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_2

9. putdown blue_block_1

10. pickup orange_block_2

11. stack orange_block_2 orange_block_1

12. unstack orange_block_2 orange_block_1

13. stack orange_block_2 red_block_1

14. pickup orange_block_1

15. stack orange_block_1 brown_block_1

This is 15 steps. Still too long.

But maybe there's a way to combine steps. For example, after step 6 (holding red_block_1), instead of putting it down, stack it somewhere else immediately.

But I'm not sure. Perhaps another approach.

Alternative plan:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1. (Holding blue.)

2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_2. (Orange_block_2 not clear, constraint 1.)

3. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1. (Holding brown.)

4. stack brown_block_1 orange_block_1. (Orange_block_1 now has brown_block_1 on top. So orange_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 2), but wait, orange_block_1 is on the table with brown on top. So orange_block_1 is still on the table. No, because a block is considered on the table if it's placed directly on it. If brown_block_1 is on orange_block_1, then orange_block_1 is still on the table. So this doesn't help constraint 2.

So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_2. But orange_block_2 already has blue_block_1. No.

Alternatively, put down brown_block_1 and then pick up orange_block_1.

But this is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to find the optimal plan.

Final attempt:

The optimal plan must be as short as possible. Let's try to find the minimal steps that satisfy all constraints.

Main goal: unstack blue from white.

Constraints:

1. orange_block_2 not clear.

2. orange_block_1 not on table.

3. hold red_block_1 while orange_block_2 not clear.

4. brown_block_1 not on table (initial state).

5. hold orange_block_1 after initial.

6. grey on white and red clear.

7. brown not on orange_block_2 (initial).

8. If brown not on orange_block_2, orange_block_2 not on table.

9. orange_block_2 not on table.

So steps:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1. (Now holding blue.)

2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_2. (Orange_block_2 not clear, constraint 1. Also, white is clear, main goal done.)

3. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1. (Holding brown.)

4. stack brown_block_1 orange_block_1. (Orange_block_1 has brown, so not on table? No, orange_block_1 is on the table. So this doesn't satisfy constraint 2. So need to stack orange_block_1 elsewhere.)

Alternatively, put brown_block_1 on table and pick up orange_block_1.

4. putdown brown_block_1. (Brown on table.)

5. pickup orange_block_1. (Holding orange_block_1. Satisfies constraint 5 and 2 (since orange_block_1 is not on table now).

6. stack orange_block_1 somewhere. For example, on orange_block_2.

But orange_block_2 has blue_block_1. So can't stack on it.

Alternatively, stack orange_block_1 on red_block_1. But red_block_1 has grey_block_1.

So steps:

5. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1. (Holding grey.)

6. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 6.)

7. pickup red_block_1. (Now holding red_block_1. At this point, orange_block_2 has blue, so not clear. Satisfies constraint 3.)

8. stack red_block_1 orange_block_2. (But orange_block_2 already has blue_block_1. Can't stack on it. So invalid.)

Alternatively, stack red_block_1 elsewhere. Like on table.

8. putdown red_block_1.

Now, steps so far:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1

2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_2

3. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1

4. putdown brown_block_1

5. pickup orange_block_1

6. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1

7. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1

8. pickup red_block_1

9. putdown red_block_1

Now, need to satisfy constraint 9: orange_block_2 not on table. Currently, orange_block_2 is on table with blue on top. So move orange_block_2:

10. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_2

11. putdown blue_block_1

12. pickup orange_block_2

13. stack orange_block_2 some_block. For example, on red_block_1.

14. Now, orange_block_2 is not on table (satisfies constraints 8 and 9).

But this plan has 14 steps. Still too long. Perhaps there's a shorter way.

Wait, after step 5, we are holding orange_block_1. We can stack it on red_block_1 after moving grey_block_1.

Let's adjust:

After step 7 (stack grey on white), step 8: pickup orange_block_1 (already done in step 5? No. Let me re-express:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1.

2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_2. (orange_block_2 not clear, constraint 1.)

3. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1.

4. putdown brown_block_1.

5. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1. (holding grey.)

6. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1. (constraint 6.)

7. pickup red_block_1. (constraint 3.)

8. stack red_block_1 some_block. Let's say on brown_block_1.

9. pickup orange_block_1. (constraint 5 and 2.)

10. stack orange_block_1 somewhere. On red_block_1.

But red_block_1 is on brown_block_1. So:

10. stack orange_block_1 red_block_1.

Now, orange_block_1 is not on the table (satisfies constraint 2).

11. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_2.

12. putdown blue_block_1.

13. pickup orange_block_2.

14. stack orange_block_2 some_block. Like grey_block_1.

But grey_block_1 is on white_block_1. So:

14. stack orange_block_2 grey_block_1. Now, orange_block_2 is not on table (constraint 9).

So this plan has 14 steps. Still long.

But perhaps there's a shorter way. Let's think:

After step 2, orange_block_2 has blue_block_1. So constraint 1 is satisfied.

In step 7, holding red_block_1 while orange_block_2 is not clear (constraint 3).

In step 9, holding orange_block_1 (constraint 5 and 2).

In step 14, orange_block_2 is not on table (constraint 9).

All other constraints are satisfied.

But this plan is 14 steps. Is there a way to reduce?

For example, after step 7 (holding red_block_1), stack it on orange_block_2 (which has blue_block_1). Can't stack on a block that's not clear. So invalid.

Alternatively, stack red_block_1 on brown_block_1 (which is on table).

Step 8: stack red_block_1 brown_block_1. Now red is on brown.

Then, step 9: pickup orange_block_1.

Step 10: stack orange_block_1 red_block_1. Now orange_block_1 is not on table.

This reduces steps.

So the revised steps:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1.

2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_2.

3. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1.

4. putdown brown_block_1.

5. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1.

6. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1.

7. pickup red_block_1.

8. stack red_block_1 brown_block_1.

9. pickup orange_block_1.

10. stack orange_block_1 red_block_1.

11. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_2.

12. putdown blue_block_1.

13. pickup orange_block_2.

14. stack orange_block_2 grey_block_1.

This is 14 steps. Still the same.

Alternatively, after step 8, can we move orange_block_2 without unstacking blue?

For example, since orange_block_2 has blue on top, we can unstack blue and then move orange_block_2.

But that's what steps 11-14 do.

Perhaps there's a way to combine steps.

But I'm running out of time. Let's proceed with this plan and check if all constraints are met:

- Constraint 1: step 2.

- Constraint 2: step 10.

- Constraint 3: step 7.

- Constraint 4: initial state.

- Constraint 5: step 9.

- Constraint 6: step 6.

- Constraint 7: initial state.

- Constraint 8 and 9: step 14.

This plan meets all constraints. But it's 14 steps. Is there a shorter way?

Alternative approach:

After unstacking blue and stacking on orange_block_2 (steps 1-2), then:

3. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1.

4. stack brown_block_1 orange_block_1. Now, orange_block_1 is not on table (constraint 2). Also, after this, brown is on orange_block_1.

But in step 4, stacking brown on orange_block_1 requires orange_block_1 to be clear, which it is initially. So this is possible. Then:

5. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1.

6. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1. (constraint 6).

7. pickup red_block_1. (constraint 3, since orange_block_2 has blue).

8. stack red_block_1 some_block. Let's say brown_block_1.

9. Now, need to satisfy constraint 9: move orange_block_2 off table.

But orange_block_2 has blue on top. So:

9. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_2.

10. putdown blue_block_1.

11. pickup orange_block_2.

12. stack orange_block_2 red_block_1.

This plan has 12 steps.

Check constraints:

1. step 2: orange_block_2 not clear.

2. step 4: orange_block_1 has brown_block_1, so it's on the table but not clear? Wait, no. If orange_block_1 has brown on top, it's still on the table. So orange_block_1 is on the table. So constraint 2 is not satisfied. So this approach doesn't work.

Ah, right. Stacking brown on orange_block_1 doesn't take orange_block_1 off the table. So constraint 2 requires orange_block_1 not on the table. So we need to move orange_block_1 itself. So we need to pick up orange_block_1 and stack it elsewhere.

So steps:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1.

2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_2.

3. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1.

4. putdown brown_block_1.

5. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1.

6. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1.

7. pickup red_block_1.

8. stack red_block_1 brown_block_1.

9. pickup orange_block_1.

10. stack orange_block_1 red_block_1.

11. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_2.

12. putdown blue_block_1.

13. pickup orange_block_2.

14. stack orange_block_2 grey_block_1.

But this still takes 14 steps. I think this is the minimal given all constraints, but I might be missing a shorter path.

Alternative Idea: Use orange_block_2 as part of the main goal steps.

For example:

After unstacking blue_block_1, stack it on orange_block_2. Then, move orange_block_2 (with blue on top) to another block, thereby taking orange_block_2 off the table.

But how? To move orange_block_2, which has blue on top, you need to first unstack blue_block_1.

But this would require:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1.

2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_2.

3. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_2.

4. putdown blue_block_1.

5. pickup orange_block_2.

6. stack orange_block_2 some_block.

But this adds steps. However, after step 6, orange_block_2 is not on the table.

But during step 2, orange_block_2 has blue on top (constraint 1). Step 3-6 handle moving orange_block_2.

But this would take 6 steps just for this part, not counting other constraints.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I think the optimal plan is around 10-14 steps. However, I might be missing a smarter way.
