Let's analyze the problem:

We have 7 blocks: red_block_1, white_block_1, grey_block_1, brown_block_1, blue_block_1, orange_block_1, and orange_block_2.

Initially:
- red_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- orange_block_2 is on the table
- brown_block_1, blue_block_1, orange_block_1, and orange_block_2 are clear
- the robotic arm is not holding any block

The goal is to make white_block_1 clear.

There are several constraints:
1. At some point, orange_block_2 should have a block on top of it.
2. At some point, orange_block_1 should not be on the table.
3. At some point, you must hold red_block_1 while there is a block on top of orange_block_2.
4. At some point, brown_block_1 should not be on the table.
5. If brown_block_1 is not on the table, then at that point or later, you must hold orange_block_1.
6. At some point, grey_block_1 should be on top of white_block_1 and red_block_1 should be clear.
7. At some point, brown_block_1 should not be on top of orange_block_2.
8. If brown_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2, then at that point or later, orange_block_2 should not be on the table.
9. At some point, orange_block_2 should not be on the table.

To achieve the goal, we need to remove blue_block_1 from white_block_1. But we also need to ensure that all the constraints are satisfied along the way.

Let's think step by step to satisfy the constraints while achieving the goal:

1. To make orange_block_2 have a block on top, we can place a block on it. 
2. To make orange_block_1 not be on the table, we need to either hold it or place it on another block.
3. To hold red_block_1 while there's a block on orange_block_2, we need to first place a block on orange_block_2, then make sure red_block_1 is accessible (not under other blocks), and then pick it up.
4. To make brown_block_1 not on the table, we need to either hold it or place it on another block.
5. To satisfy the constraint that if brown_block_1 is not on the table, we must hold orange_block_1 at that point or later, we need to ensure that after moving brown_block_1, we later hold orange_block_1.
6. To make grey_block_1 on top of white_block_1 and red_block_1 clear, we need to move grey_block_1 from red_block_1 to white_block_1. But first, we need to move brown_block_1 from grey_block_1.
7. To ensure brown_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2, we need to make sure we don't place brown_block_1 on orange_block_2, or if we do, we later move it.
8. To ensure that after brown_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2, orange_block_2 is not on the table, we need to pick up orange_block_2 or place it on another block once brown_block_1 is not on top of it.
9. To make orange_block_2 not on the table, we need to either hold it or place it on another block.

Now, given the goal and constraints, I'll try to formulate a plan:

Initial state:
- red_block_1 is on the table with grey_block_1 on top and brown_block_1 on top of grey_block_1.
- white_block_1 is on the table with blue_block_1 on top.
- orange_block_1 and orange_block_2 are clear and on the table.

Let's plan to satisfy the constraints while achieving the goal:

1. First, unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1.
2. Stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_2. This satisfies the constraint that orange_block_2 should have a block on top.
3. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1. This ensures that red_block_1 is clear.
4. Stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1. But wait, white_block_1 has blue_block_1 on top. We need to move blue_block_1 first.
   4.1. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1.
   4.2. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_1. This satisfies the constraint that orange_block_1 should not be on the table (since it now has blue_block_1 on top).
   4.3. Stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1. This satisfies the constraint that grey_block_1 should be on top of white_block_1 and red_block_1 should be clear.
5. Pick up red_block_1. At this point, brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2, satisfying the constraint that you should hold red_block_1 while there's a block on top of orange_block_2.
6. Put down red_block_1. Now red_block_1 is clear and on the table.
7. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_2. This satisfies the constraint that brown_block_1 should not be on top of orange_block_2.
8. To ensure that after brown_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2, orange_block_2 is not on the table, we need to pick up orange_block_2 or place it on another block.
   8.1. Pick up orange_block_2. This satisfies the constraint that orange_block_2 should not be on the table.
   8.2. Stack orange_block_2 on red_block_1.
9. To address the constraint that brown_block_1 should not be on the table, we need to either hold it or place it on another block.
   9.1. We're already holding brown_block_1 (from step 7).
   9.2. Stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_2 (which is now on red_block_1).
10. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_2. This also maintains the constraint that brown_block_1 should not be on top of orange_block_2.
11. Stack brown_block_1 on red_block_1.
12. Pick up orange_block_1. This satisfies the constraint that if brown_block_1 is not on the table, then at that point or later, you must hold orange_block_1.
13. Put down orange_block_1.

But wait, I'm missing a step. At this point, we haven't achieved the goal yet because we placed grey_block_1 on white_block_1. Let me rethink the plan:

Actually, if we follow the plan above, at step 4.3, we've satisfied the constraint that grey_block_1 should be on top of white_block_1 and red_block_1 should be clear. But now white_block_1 is not clear, which is the goal.

So, we need to make sure white_block_1 is clear at the end of the plan. After achieving all the constraints, we need to ensure that grey_block_1 is not on white_block_1.

Let's update the latter part of the plan:
11. Stack brown_block_1 on any available clear block (other than white_block_1 or grey_block_1).
12. Unstack grey_block_1 from white_block_1. This achieves the goal of making white_block_1 clear.
13. Pick up orange_block_1. This satisfies the constraint that if brown_block_1 is not on the table, then at that point or later, you must hold orange_block_1.
14. Put down orange_block_1.

However, I'm not sure of the exact state at step 11. Let me clarify that. 

After step 10, we have:
- white_block_1 is on the table with grey_block_1 on top.
- red_block_1 is on the table with orange_block_2 on top.
- orange_block_1 is on the table.
- blue_block_1 is on the table (we placed it on orange_block_1, but I made a mistake; we'd actually need to move it).
- brown_block_1 is in hand.

So, at step 11, we could stack brown_block_1 on blue_block_1. But I'm trying to remember where blue_block_1 was after our operations. Let me trace it step by step:

Initial state:
- red_block_1 is on the table with grey_block_1 on top and brown_block_1 on top of grey_block_1.
- white_block_1 is on the table with blue_block_1 on top.
- orange_block_1 and orange_block_2 are clear and on the table.

Let's trace the blockworld state step by step:

   - brown_block_1 is in hand.
   - grey_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 and is clear.

   - orange_block_1 is clear and on the table.

4. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1.
   - But I can't do this because I'm currently holding grey_block_1.
   - I need to put down grey_block_1 first, then unstack blue_block_1.

Let me rethink my plan:

   - grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1.
   - red_block_1 is on the table and is clear.

   - red_block_1 is on the table and is clear.
   - grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and is clear.
   - blue_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1.

10. Pickup orange_block_2.
    - But I can't do this because I'm currently holding brown_block_1.
    - I need to put down brown_block_1 first, then pickup orange_block_2.

Let's check the constraints:

1. At some point, orange_block_2 should have a block on top of it.
   - This is satisfied in steps 2-9 (brown_block_1 on orange_block_2) and steps 18-20 (orange_block_1 on orange_block_2).

2. At some point, orange_block_1 should not be on the table.
   - This is satisfied in steps 18-20 (orange_block_1 on orange_block_2).

3. At some point, you must hold red_block_1 while there is a block on top of orange_block_2.
   - This is satisfied in step 7, where we hold red_block_1 while brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2.

4. At some point, brown_block_1 should not be on the table.
   - This is satisfied in steps 2-9 (brown_block_1 on orange_block_2) and steps 10-20 (brown_block_1 on red_block_1).

5. If brown_block_1 is not on the table, then at that point or later, you must hold orange_block_1.
   - This is satisfied in step 17, where we hold orange_block_1 after brown_block_1 is not on the table.

6. At some point, grey_block_1 should be on top of white_block_1 and red_block_1 should be clear.
   - This is satisfied in steps 6-7, where grey_block_1 is on white_block_1 and red_block_1 is clear.

7. At some point, brown_block_1 should not be on top of orange_block_2.
   - This is satisfied from step 10 onwards, as brown_block_1 is moved from orange_block_2 to red_block_1.

8. If brown_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2, then at that point or later, orange_block_2 should not be on the table.
   - This is satisfied in steps 11-16, where orange_block_2 is not on the table (it's on brown_block_1) after brown_block_1 is not on top of it.

9. At some point, orange_block_2 should not be on the table.
   - This is satisfied in steps 11-16 (orange_block_2 on brown_block_1) and steps 16-20 (orange_block_2 on blue_block_1).

Great, all constraints are satisfied, and the goal of making white_block_1 clear is achieved in steps 19-20.

Let me now give a summary of the plan:

1. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1.
2. Stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_2.

10. Stack brown_block_1 on blue_block_1.
    - brown_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1.
    - blue_block_1 is on top of red_block_1.
    - red_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1.
    - grey_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1.
    - orange_block_2 is on the table and is clear.
    - white_block_1 is on the table and is clear.
    - arm is empty.

11. Pickup orange_block_2.
    - orange_block_2 is in hand.
    - brown_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1 and is clear.
    - blue_block_1 is on top of red_block_1.
    - red_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1.
    - grey_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1.
    - white_block_1 is on the table and is clear.

This plan satisfies most of the constraints:
1. At some point, orange_block_2 should have a block on top of it. ✓ (steps 2-9)
2. At some point, orange_block_1 should not be on the table. ✓ (steps 4-11)
3. At some point, you must hold red_block_1 while there is a block on top of orange_block_2. ✓ (step 5)
4. At some point, brown_block_1 should not be on the table. ✓ (steps 2-9 and 10-11)
5. If brown_block_1 is not on the table, then at that point or later, you must hold orange_block_1. ✗ This is not satisfied yet!
6. At some point, grey_block_1 should be on top of white_block_1 and red_block_1 should be clear. ✗ This is not satisfied yet!
7. At some point, brown_block_1 should not be on top of orange_block_2. ✓ (steps 10-11)
8. If brown_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2, then at that point or later, orange_block_2 should not be on the table. ✓ (step 11)
9. At some point, orange_block_2 should not be on the table. ✓ (step 11)

We still need to satisfy constraint 5 (we need to hold orange_block_1 at some point after brown_block_1 is not on the table) and constraint 6 (we need to have grey_block_1 on top of white_block_1 and red_block_1 clear).

Ok, I think my approach is getting too complex to handle all the constraints concurrently. Let me simplify and write the full step-by-step plan:

Initial state:
- red_block_1 is on the table with grey_block_1 on top and brown_block_1 on top of grey_block_1.
- white_block_1 is on the table with blue_block_1 on top.
- orange_block_1 and orange_block_2 are clear and on the table.

1. unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1.
2. stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_2.
3. unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1.
4. stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_1.
5. unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1.
6. stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1.
7. pickup red_block_1.
8. putdown red_block_1.
9. unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_2.
10. stack brown_block_1 on red_block_1.
11. pickup orange_block_2.
12. stack orange_block_2 on brown_block_1.
13. unstack blue_block_1 from orange_block_1.
14. putdown blue_block_1.
15. pickup orange_block_1.
16. stack orange_block_1 on orange_block_2.
17. unstack grey_block_1 from white_block_1.
18. stack grey_block_1 on orange_block_1.

This plan seems to satisfy all the constraints and achieve the goal:

1. At some point, orange_block_2 should have a block on top of it. ✓ (steps 2-9 and 16-18)
2. At some point, orange_block_1 should not be on the table. ✓ (steps 16-18)
3. At some point, you must hold red_block_1 while there is a block on top of orange_block_2. ✓ (step 7)
4. At some point, brown_block_1 should not be on the table. ✓ (steps 2-9 and 10-18)
5. If brown_block_1 is not on the table, then at that point or later, you must hold orange_block_1. ✓ (step 15)
6. At some point, grey_block_1 should be on top of white_block_1 and red_block_1 should be clear. ✓ (steps 6-7)
7. At some point, brown_block_1 should not be on top of orange_block_2. ✓ (steps 10-18)
8. If brown_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2, then at that point or later, orange_block_2 should not be on the table. ✓ (steps 11-18)
9. At some point, orange_block_2 should not be on the table. ✓ (steps 11-18)

And the goal is achieved: white_block_1 is clear after step 17.

Actually, wait, I believe I can simplify the plan further:

1. unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1.
2. stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_2.
3. unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1.
4. stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1.
5. pickup red_block_1.
6. putdown red_block_1.
7. unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1.

But this doesn't work because white_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top, not blue_block_1. I've made a mistake. Let me reconsider.

I'll just stick with the plan I outlined earlier:

1. unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1.
2. stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_2.
3. unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1.
4. stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_1.
5. unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1.
6. stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1.
7. pickup red_block_1.
8. putdown red_block_1.
9. unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_2.
10. stack brown_block_1 on red_block_1.
11. pickup orange_block_2.
12. stack orange_block_2 on brown_block_1.
13. unstack blue_block_1 from orange_block_1.
14. putdown blue_block_1.
15. pickup orange_block_1.
16. stack orange_block_1 on orange_block_2.
17. unstack grey_block_1 from white_block_1.
18. stack grey_block_1 on orange_block_1.

Let me double-check that this satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal.

Constraint 1: At some point, orange_block_2 should have a block on top of it.
Status: Satisfied in steps 2-9 (brown_block_1 on orange_block_2) and 16-18 (orange_block_1 on orange_block_2).

Constraint 2: At some point, orange_block_1 should not be on the table.
Status: Satisfied in steps 16-18 (orange_block_1 on orange_block_2).

Constraint 3: At some point, you must hold red_block_1 while there is a block on top of orange_block_2.
Status: Satisfied in step 7 (holding red_block_1 while brown_block_1 is on orange_block_2).

Constraint 4: At some point, brown_block_1 should not be on the table.
Status: Satisfied in steps 2-9 (on orange_block_2) and 10-18 (on red_block_1).

Constraint 5: If brown_block_1 is not on the table, then at that point or later, you must hold orange_block_1.
Status: Satisfied in step 15 (holding orange_block_1 after brown_block_1 is not on the table).

Constraint 6: At some point, grey_block_1 should be on top of white_block_1 and red_block_1 should be clear.
Status: Satisfied in steps 6-7 (grey_block_1 is on white_block_1 and red_block_1 is clear).

Constraint 7: At some point, brown_block_1 should not be on top of orange_block_2.
Status: Satisfied in steps 10-18 (brown_block_1 is on red_block_1, not on orange_block_2).

Constraint 8: If brown_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2, then at that point or later, orange_block_2 should not be on the table.
Status: Satisfied in steps 11-18 (orange_block_2 is not on the table after brown_block_1 is not on top of it).

Constraint 9: At some point, orange_block_2 should not be on the table.
Status: Satisfied in steps 11-18 (orange_block_2 is on brown_block_1, not on the table).

Goal: white_block_1 is clear.
Status: Achieved in steps 17-18 (grey_block_1 is removed from white_block_1).

All constraints are satisfied and the goal is achieved!

Now, let's see if we can optimize the plan (make it shorter):

1. unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1. (necessary to access grey_block_1)
2. stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_2. (to satisfy constraint 1: orange_block_2 should have a block on top)
3. unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1. (necessary to remove blue_block_1 from white_block_1)
4. stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_1. (to safely store blue_block_1)
5. unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1. (necessary to access red_block_1 and move grey_block_1)
6. stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1. (to satisfy constraint 6: grey_block_1 on white_block_1 and red_block_1 clear)
7. pickup red_block_1. (to satisfy constraint 3: hold red_block_1 while a block is on orange_block_2)
8. putdown red_block_1. (to free the arm)
9. unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_2. (to satisfy constraint 7: brown_block_1 not on orange_block_2)
10. stack brown_block_1 on red_block_1. (to safely store brown_block_1)
11. pickup orange_block_2. (to satisfy constraint 8: orange_block_2 not on the table after brown_block_1 is not on it)
12. stack orange_block_2 on brown_block_1. (to safely store orange_block_2)
13. unstack blue_block_1 from orange_block_1. (necessary to access orange_block_1)
14. putdown blue_block_1. (to free the arm)
15. pickup orange_block_1. (to satisfy constraint 5: hold orange_block_1 after brown_block_1 is not on the table)
16. stack orange_block_1 on orange_block_2. (to satisfy constraint 2: orange_block_1 not on the table)
17. unstack grey_block_1 from white_block_1. (to achieve the goal: white_block_1 clear)
18. stack grey_block_1 on orange_block_1. (to safely store grey_block_1)

Yeah, I think this plan cannot be optimized any further. All actions are necessary to satisfy the constraints and achieve the goal.

1. unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1
2. stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_2
3. unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1
4. stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_1
5. unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1
6. stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1
7. pickup red_block_1
8. putdown red_block_1
9. unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_2
10. stack brown_block_1 on red_block_1
11. pickup orange_block_2
12. stack orange_block_2 on brown_block_1
13. unstack blue_block_1 from orange_block_1
14. putdown blue_block_1
15. pickup orange_block_1
16. stack orange_block_1 on orange_block_2
17. unstack grey_block_1 from white_block_1
