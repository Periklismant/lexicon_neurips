**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1**: Clear green_block_1 to access brown_block_2 later. Satisfies constraint 11's precondition.
2. **putdown grey_block_1**: Free the gripper for subsequent actions.
3. **unstack black_block_2 black_block_1**: Clear black_block_1 to stack green_block_1 later.
4. **putdown black_block_2**: Free the gripper again.
5. **unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2**: Access brown_block_2 for pickup. At this point, green_block_1 is clear (constraint 5).
6. **stack green_block_1 black_block_1**: Satisfies constraint 3's postcondition and keeps green_block_1 off the table (constraint 11 handled via subsequent steps).
7. **pickup brown_block_2**: Required by constraint 1 before moving black_block_3.
8. **putdown brown_block_2**: Free the gripper to finally pick up black_block_3.
9. **unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1**: Achieves the goal while satisfying all constraints (brown_block_2 was held earlier, black_block_3 is no longer on brown_block_1, etc.).

This plan efficiently satisfies all constraints with minimal steps.
