Alright, let's break down this planning problem.

First, let's understand the initial state:
- brown_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_2 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2
- black_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
- black_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
- black_block_2 is clear
- black_block_3 is clear
- grey_block_1 is clear
- The arm is not holding any block

The goal is to have the arm holding black_block_3.

Let's analyze the constraints to understand what needs to happen:

1. "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1" must hold in at least one state. This means we need to unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1 at some point.

2. If "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1" holds in some state, then we must have held brown_block_2 in an earlier state. So before we can unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1, we need to pick up brown_block_2 at some point.

3. "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" must hold in at least one state. This is always true since a block can't be on top of itself.

4. If "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1", then either "you are holding black_block_1" or "green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" must hold at some state. Given that the first condition is always true, we need to either hold black_block_1 or place green_block_1 on top of black_block_1 at some point.

5. "Either green_block_1 is clear OR brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" must hold in at least one state. Currently, green_block_1 is not clear (it has grey_block_1 on it), so we need to either make green_block_1 clear or stack brown_block_1 on black_block_1.

6. "black_block_3 is not on top of black_block_1" must hold in at least one state. This is already true in the initial state, since black_block_3 is on brown_block_1, not black_block_1.

7. If "black_block_3 is not on top of black_block_1", then either "brown_block_2 is not on the table" or "brown_block_1 is not clear" must hold. In the initial state, brown_block_2 is on the table and brown_block_1 is not clear (it has black_block_3 on it). So this is already satisfied.

8. "brown_block_1 is clear" must hold in at least one state. This means we need to unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1 at some point.

9. If "brown_block_1 is clear" holds, then there must have been an earlier state where "black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1". So before we can make brown_block_1 clear, we need to have black_block_2 on green_block_1 at some point.

10. "black_block_3 is not clear" must hold in at least one state. Currently, black_block_3 is clear, so we need to place a block on top of black_block_3 at some point.

11. If "black_block_3 is not clear", then there must have been an earlier state where "green_block_1 is clear". So before we can place a block on black_block_3, we need to make green_block_1 clear.

12. "grey_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1" must hold in at least one state. This is already true in the initial state, since grey_block_1 is on green_block_1, not brown_block_1.

13. If "grey_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1", then "green_block_1 is on the table" must hold at some state. So we need to place green_block_1 on the table at some point.

Given these constraints, let's come up with a plan:

1. First, unstack grey_block_1 from green_block_1 to make green_block_1 clear (for constraint 11).
2. Unstack green_block_1 from brown_block_2 and place it on the table (for constraint 13).
3. Pick up brown_block_2 (for constraint 2).
4. Unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1.
5. Stack black_block_2 on green_block_1 (for constraint 9).
6. Pick up black_block_1 (for constraint 4).
7. Put down black_block_1.
8. Unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1 (for constraints 1 and 8).
9. Place black_block_3 on black_block_1 or another clear block.
10. Stack some clear block on black_block_3 (for constraint 10).
11. Finally, unstack black_block_3 to achieve the goal of holding black_block_3.

But there are some complexities due to the ordering of actions and constraints. Let me try to form a more concrete plan:

Actually, let's double check which blocks are initially clear.
- black_block_2 is clear
- black_block_3 is clear
- grey_block_1 is clear

Ok, let's approach this problem step by step while checking our constraints.

1. First, we need to make brown_block_1 clear (constraint 8) which means we need to unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1. But before that, we need to ensure "black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" (constraint 9). And before that, we need to make green_block_1 clear.

2. So, we start by unstacking grey_block_1 from green_block_1.

3. Now, green_block_1 is clear. We need to unstack green_block_1 from brown_block_2 and put it on the table (for constraint 13).

4. Now, we need to pick up brown_block_2 (for constraint 2) and put it somewhere.

5. Next, we need to make sure "black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" (constraint 9). So, we unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1 and stack it on green_block_1.

6. Now, we can unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1, making brown_block_1 clear. This also ensures "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1" (constraint 1).

7. We need to make sure "black_block_3 is not clear" (constraint 10). Let's stack a clear block on top of black_block_3.

8. Finally, we need to make the arm hold black_block_3. If there's a block on top of black_block_3, we'll need to unstack it, and then unstack black_block_3 to achieve our goal.

Let me try to form a plan:

```
unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2
pickup brown_block_2
putdown brown_block_2
unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
stack black_block_2 green_block_1
unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1
putdown black_block_3
pickup grey_block_1
stack grey_block_1 black_block_3
unstack grey_block_1 black_block_3
unstack black_block_3 table
```

Wait, that's not quite right. We can't "unstack black_block_3 table" because unstack is for a block that's on top of another block, not on the table. Let me revise the plan:

```
unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2
putdown green_block_1
pickup brown_block_2
putdown brown_block_2
unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
stack black_block_2 green_block_1
unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1
putdown black_block_3
pickup grey_block_1
stack grey_block_1 black_block_3
unstack grey_block_1 black_block_3
pickup black_block_3
```

Let's check the constraints:

1. "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1" must hold in at least one state. This is satisfied after we unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1.

2. If "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1" holds in some state, then we must have held brown_block_2 in an earlier state. This is satisfied since we pick up brown_block_2 before unstacking black_block_3 from brown_block_1.

3. "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" must hold in at least one state. This is always true.

4. If "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1", then either "you are holding black_block_1" or "green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" must hold at some state. I don't see where we satisfy this in our plan.

Hmm, I'm forgetting about constraint 4. Let's adjust our plan.

I also don't think we pickup black_block_1 in our plan, but we should.

Let me revise the plan:

```
unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2
putdown green_block_1
pickup brown_block_2
putdown brown_block_2
unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
stack black_block_2 green_block_1
pickup black_block_1
putdown black_block_1
unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1
putdown black_block_3
pickup grey_block_1
stack grey_block_1 black_block_3
unstack grey_block_1 black_block_3
pickup black_block_3
```

Now, we also pick up black_block_1, satisfying constraint 4.

Let's check all the constraints again:

1. "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1" must hold in at least one state. Satisfied after we unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1.

2. If "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1" holds in some state, then we must have held brown_block_2 in an earlier state. Satisfied since we pick up brown_block_2 before unstacking black_block_3 from brown_block_1.

3. "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" must hold in at least one state. Always true.

4. If "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1", then either "you are holding black_block_1" or "green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" must hold at some state. Satisfied since we pick up black_block_1 at some point.

5. "Either green_block_1 is clear OR brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" must hold in at least one state. Satisfied as green_block_1 becomes clear after we unstack grey_block_1 from it.

6. "black_block_3 is not on top of black_block_1" must hold in at least one state. Satisfied in the initial state.

7. If "black_block_3 is not on top of black_block_1", then either "brown_block_2 is not on the table" or "brown_block_1 is not clear" must hold. Initially satisfied since brown_block_1 is not clear.

8. "brown_block_1 is clear" must hold in at least one state. Satisfied after we unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1.

9. If "brown_block_1 is clear" holds, then there must have been an earlier state where "black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1". Satisfied since we stack black_block_2 on green_block_1 before making brown_block_1 clear.

10. "black_block_3 is not clear" must hold in at least one state. Satisfied after we stack grey_block_1 on black_block_3.

11. If "black_block_3 is not clear", then there must have been an earlier state where "green_block_1 is clear". Satisfied since we make green_block_1 clear before stacking grey_block_1 on black_block_3.

12. "grey_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1" must hold in at least one state. Satisfied in the initial state.

13. If "grey_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1", then "green_block_1 is on the table" must hold at some state. Satisfied as we put green_block_1 on the table.

Great, all constraints are satisfied! Let's refine the plan one more time for optimality:

Actually, I realized we're doing an extra step with grey_block_1. We could also stack black_block_3 on some other clear block after unstacking it from brown_block_1, and then stack grey_block_1 on top. This would be more efficient.

Let's try to get a more optimal plan:

Actually, I'd like to get a clear picture of the initial state to ensure that my plan works:

- brown_block_1 is on the table with black_block_3 on top of it. black_block_3 is clear.
- brown_block_2 is on the table with green_block_1 on top of it. grey_block_1 is on top of green_block_1. grey_block_1 is clear.
- black_block_1 is on the table with black_block_2 on top of it. black_block_2 is clear.

Here's a more optimal plan:

```
unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2
putdown green_block_1
pickup brown_block_2
putdown brown_block_2
unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
stack black_block_2 green_block_1
pickup black_block_1
putdown black_block_1
unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1
putdown black_block_3
pickup grey_block_1
stack grey_block_1 black_block_3
unstack grey_block_1 black_block_3
pickup black_block_3
```

I think it's already optimal given the constraints. Let's double-check:

1. We need to unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1 (for constraints 1 and 8).
2. Before that, we need to have black_block_2 on green_block_1 (constraint 9).
3. Before that, we need to have green_block_1 clear (to satisfy constraint 11).
4. We also need to pick up brown_block_2 (constraint 2) before making black_block_3 not on top of brown_block_1.
5. We need to have black_block_3 not clear at some point (constraint 10).
6. We need to pick up black_block_1 (constraint 4) at some point.
7. We need to put green_block_1 on the table (constraint 13).

All of these steps are in our plan and they seem to be in the correct order.

But wait, when considering optimality, I need to ensure that each step is necessary and there's no shorter way to satisfy all constraints.

Let me double check again:
- black_block_3 is on brown_block_1, so we need to unstack it to make brown_block_1 clear.
- green_block_1 is on brown_block_2, and grey_block_1 is on green_block_1.
- We need to make green_block_1 clear before we can stack black_block_2 on it.
- We also need to pick up brown_block_2 before unstacking black_block_3 from brown_block_1.

So, we need to:
1. Unstack grey_block_1 from green_block_1.
2. Unstack green_block_1 from brown_block_2.
3. Pick up brown_block_2.
4. Unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1.
5. Stack black_block_2 on green_block_1.
6. Make black_block_3 not clear.
7. Pick up black_block_1.

Actually, I've been over-complicating this problem. Let's revise the plan:

```
unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2
putdown green_block_1
pickup brown_block_2
putdown brown_block_2
unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
stack black_block_2 green_block_1
pickup black_block_1
putdown black_block_1
unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1
stack black_block_3 black_block_1
pickup grey_block_1
stack grey_block_1 black_block_3
unstack grey_block_1 black_block_3
pickup black_block_3
```

I'm trying to think of a way to optimize even more, but I don't see one given the constraints. Actually, can we merge the steps of picking up and putting down black_block_1 and unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1 and stack it on black_block_1? Let's see:

```
unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2
putdown green_block_1
pickup brown_block_2
putdown brown_block_2
unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
stack black_block_2 green_block_1
pickup black_block_1
putdown black_block_1
unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1
pickup grey_block_1
stack grey_block_1 black_block_3
unstack grey_block_1 black_block_3
pickup black_block_3
```

Hmm, that doesn't seem to be making much of a difference. I think the main problem is that we're required to satisfy multiple constraints, and each of them adds steps to our plan.

Let's try to refine further:

```
unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2
putdown green_block_1
pickup brown_block_2
putdown brown_block_2
unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
stack black_block_2 green_block_1
pickup black_block_1
putdown black_block_1
unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1
pickup grey_block_1
stack grey_block_1 black_block_3
unstack grey_block_1 black_block_3
pickup black_block_3
```

I'm trying to find a way to further optimize but each constraint requires specific steps in a specific order, so I don't think we can reduce the length.

Re-checking our constraints:

1. "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1" must hold in at least one state. Satisfied when we unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1.

2. If "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1" holds in some state, then we must have held brown_block_2 in an earlier state. Satisfied as we pick up brown_block_2 before unstacking black_block_3.

3. "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" must hold in at least one state. Always true.

4. If "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1", then either "you are holding black_block_1" or "green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" must hold at some state. Satisfied as we pick up black_block_1 at some point.

5. "Either green_block_1 is clear OR brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" must hold in at least one state. Satisfied as green_block_1 becomes clear after we unstack grey_block_1 from it.

6. "black_block_3 is not on top of black_block_1" must hold in at least one state. Satisfied in the initial state.

7. If "black_block_3 is not on top of black_block_1", then either "brown_block_2 is not on the table" or "brown_block_1 is not clear" must hold. Satisfied in the initial state.

8. "brown_block_1 is clear" must hold in at least one state. Satisfied after we unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1.

9. If "brown_block_1 is clear" holds, then there must have been an earlier state where "black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1". Satisfied as we stack black_block_2 on green_block_1 before unstacking black_block_3.

10. "black_block_3 is not clear" must hold in at least one state. Satisfied after we stack grey_block_1 on black_block_3.

11. If "black_block_3 is not clear", then there must have been an earlier state where "green_block_1 is clear". Satisfied as green_block_1 becomes clear before we stack grey_block_1 on black_block_3.

12. "grey_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1" must hold in at least one state. Satisfied in the initial state.

13. If "grey_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1", then "green_block_1 is on the table" must hold at some state. Satisfied as we put green_block_1 on the table.

All constraints are still satisfied, which is good. I realize there's something I missed:

Constraint 1 is satisfied in our plan when we "unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1"
Constraint 2 says that if constraint 1 is satisfied, we must have held brown_block_2 earlier, which we did by "pickup brown_block_2".
Constraints 3 and 4 is about green_block_1 not being on top of itself, which is always true, and the implication is that we need to either hold black_block_1 or have green_block_1 on top of black_block_1, which we satisfy by picking up black_block_1.
Constraint 5 asks for green_block_1 to be clear or brown_block_1 to be on top of black_block_1, and we satisfy this by making green_block_1 clear.
Constraint 6 is about black_block_3 not being on top of black_block_1, which is true initially.
Constraint 7 says that if constraint 6 is satisfied, then brown_block_2 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear, which is initially satisfied because brown_block_1 is not clear (black_block_3 is on it).
Constraint 8 asks for brown_block_1 to be clear at some point, which we satisfy by unstacking black_block_3 from it.
Constraint 9 says that if constraint 8 is satisfied, then there must have been an earlier state where black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1, which we satisfy by stacking black_block_2 on green_block_1 before unstacking black_block_3.
Constraint 10 asks for black_block_3 to not be clear at some point, which we satisfy by stacking grey_block_1 on it.
Constraint 11 says that if constraint 10 is satisfied, then there must have been an earlier state where green_block_1 is clear, which is satisfied as we make green_block_1 clear before stacking grey_block_1 on black_block_3.
Constraint 12 is about grey_block_1 not being on top of brown_block_1, which is satisfied initially.
Constraint 13 says that if constraint 12 is satisfied, then green_block_1 must be on the table at some point, which we satisfy by putting green_block_1 on the table.

I'm running out of ideas to further optimize the plan, so let's go with this:

```
unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2
putdown green_block_1
pickup brown_block_2
putdown brown_block_2
unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
stack black_block_2 green_block_1
pickup black_block_1
putdown black_block_1
unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1
pickup grey_block_1
stack grey_block_1 black_block_3
unstack grey_block_1 black_block_3
pickup black_block_3
```

Hmm, I see that after we unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1, we can simply put it on the table, pick up grey_block_1, stack it on black_block_3, then unstack grey_block_1, and finally pick up black_block_3. Let's replace the tail of our existing plan.

Wait, something we're missing here: constraint 5 says we need to have either green_block_1 clear OR brown_block_1 on top of black_block_1. We satisfy the "green_block_1 is clear" by unstacking grey_block_1 from it. But if we choose to satisfy "brown_block_1 on top of black_block_1" instead, we might save some steps.

Let me try a different approach:

First, we need to satisfy constraint 9: have black_block_2 on top of green_block_1 at some point. For this, we need to make green_block_1 clear and then stack black_block_2 on it.

After this, we need to pick up brown_block_2 (for constraint 2) and black_block_1 (for constraint 4) at some point.

Then, we need to unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1 to satisfy constraint 1 and make brown_block_1 clear (constraint 8).

Next, we need to make black_block_3 not clear at some point (constraint 10). For this, we can stack a clear block on top of it.

In between, we also need to place green_block_1 on the table (constraint 13).

Let's plan with this in mind:

1. Unstack grey_block_1 from green_block_1 (to make green_block_1 clear).
2. Unstack green_block_1 from brown_block_2 and put it on the table (for constraint 13).
3. Pick up brown_block_2 (for constraint 2) and put it back down.
4. Unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1.
5. Stack black_block_2 on green_block_1 (for constraint 9).
6. Pick up black_block_1 (for constraint 4) and put it back down.
7. Unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1 (for constraints 1 and 8).
8. Put down black_block_3.
9. Pick up grey_block_1.
10. Stack grey_block_1 on black_block_3 (for constraint 10).
11. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_3.
12. Pick up black_block_3 (to achieve the goal).

```
unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2
putdown green_block_1
pickup brown_block_2
putdown brown_block_2
unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
stack black_block_2 green_block_1
pickup black_block_1
putdown black_block_1
unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1
putdown black_block_3
pickup grey_block_1
stack grey_block_1 black_block_3
unstack grey_block_1 black_block_3
pickup black_block_3
```

I think this is the most optimal plan we can have given the constraints.

Hmm, let me check if I'm missing anything:
If we revisit constraints 6 and 7, they say:
Constraint 6: "black_block_3 is not on top of black_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
Constraint 7: If constraint 6 is satisfied, then either "brown_block_2 is not on the table" or "brown_block_1 is not clear" must hold.

Because "black_block_3 is not on top of black_block_1" holds in the initial state, either "brown_block_2 is not on the table" or "brown_block_1 is not clear" must hold.
"brown_block_1 is not clear" holds in the initial state because black_block_3 is on top of it.
If we're doing this optimization for the constraint to be satisfied, we already satisfied the "brown_block_1 is not clear" part in the initial state. But I'm keeping the "pick up brown_block_2" step to satisfy constraint 2.

For constraint 5 which says "Either green_block_1 is clear OR brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" must hold, we satisfy this by making green_block_1 clear, not by stacking brown_block_1 on black_block_1. But having "green_block_1 is clear" is necessary for us to satisfy constraint 9, which says before making brown_block_1 clear, there must have been an earlier state where "black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1". So, we're choosing this approach to satisfy constraint 5 to also help with constraint 9.

I think the current plan is optimal:

```
unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2
putdown green_block_1
pickup brown_block_2
putdown brown_block_2
unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
stack black_block_2 green_block_1
pickup black_block_1
putdown black_block_1
unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1
putdown black_block_3
pickup grey_block_1
stack grey_block_1 black_block_3
unstack grey_block_1 black_block_3
pickup black_block_3
```

Alternatively, to make our plan faster, I wonder if we can optimize parts of it. After we unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1, we just put it on the table to prepare for the next steps. But what if we directly unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1 and then pick it up? No, wait, that's not possible because we'd be violating the rule. After unstacking, we'd be holding black_block_3, so we'd have to put it down, then we'd need to pick up grey_block_1 and stack it on black_block_3, and then unstack it again, and then pick up black_block_3.

I think the current plan is optimal.

Briefly summarizing my approach to ensure I've not missed anything:

I designed a plan that meets all constraints. The key insights were:
1. Before making brown_block_1 clear, we needed to have black_block_2 on green_block_1.
2. Before placing black_block_2 on green_block_1, we needed to make green_block_1 clear.
3. Before satisfying the constraint of "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1", we needed to have held brown_block_2 at some point.
4. We needed to pick up black_block_1 at some point to satisfy a specific constraint.
5. We had to make sure black_block_3 was not clear at some point by stacking a block on top of it.
6. We had to place green_block_1 on the table at some point.

Given all of these requirements, the plan I've come up with seems to be the most efficient way to meet all constraints and achieve the goal.

So, the final plan is:

```
unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2
putdown green_block_1
pickup brown_block_2
putdown brown_block_2
unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
stack black_block_2 green_block_1
pickup black_block_1
putdown black_block_1
unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1
putdown black_block_3
pickup grey_block_1
stack grey_block_1 black_block_3
unstack grey_block_1 black_block_3
pickup black_block_3
```

Wait, I made a mistake. Step 8 in our plan is "unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1", but this is not right. I should be calling it "unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1".

Actually, I just double checked the action definitions and the format is:
 "unstack x y": Pick up block x from the top of block y.

So, we're good with "unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1".

With that, our final plan is:

```
unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2
putdown green_block_1
pickup brown_block_2
putdown brown_block_2
unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
stack black_block_2 green_block_1
pickup black_block_1
putdown black_block_1
unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1
putdown black_block_3
pickup grey_block_1
stack grey_block_1 black_block_3
unstack grey_block_1 black_block_3
pickup black_block_3
```

I've double checked that all the constraints are satisfied, and this plan should be optimal.

Let's check again the optimality, maybe there are more optimizations we can make:
Optimality is subjective based on the criteria used. If the shortest possible plan is the most optimal, then we'd want to minimize the number of steps. But we need to ensure all constraints are satisfied.

Let's check if any steps are redundant:

1. Unstack grey_block_1 from green_block_1 (to make green_block_1 clear).
2. Put down grey_block_1.
3. Unstack green_block_1 from brown_block_2 and put it on the table (for constraint 13).
4. Put down green_block_1.
5. Pick up brown_block_2 (for constraint 2).
6. Put down brown_block_2.
7. Unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1.
8. Stack black_block_2 on green_block_1 (for constraint 9).
9. Pick up black_block_1 (for constraint 4).
10. Put down black_block_1.
11. Unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1 (for constraints 1 and 8).
12. Put down black_block_3.
13. Pick up grey_block_1.
14. Stack grey_block_1 on black_block_3 (for constraint 10).
15. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_3.
16. Pick up black_block_3 (to achieve the goal).

I don't see any redundant steps here. Honestly, the only thing I can think of is maybe we don't need to pick black_block_1 up and put it back down; maybe we can stack something on it directly after unstacking block_block_2 from it. But that's not necessarilty true, depends on the rest of the plan.

I'll check once more:

"pickup black_block_1" -> "putdown black_block_1" are necessary to satisfy constraint 4, which says either we need to hold black_block_1 or have green_block_1 on top of black_block_1 at some point. Since we're not stacking green_block_1 on black_block_1 in our plan, we need to hold black_block_1 at some point.
This is the constraint:
"If expression "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" holds in some state, then expression "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding black_block_1", "green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1"" must hold at s or at some state after s"

Hm, actually, it says that once "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" which is always true, either we need to be holding black_block_1 or have green_block_1 on top of black_block_1 at some state (this state or after).

Let's rethink our plan:

1. Unstack grey_block_1 from green_block_1.
2. Unstack green_block_1 from brown_block_2.
3. Stack green_block_1 on black_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 4).
4. Pick up brown_block_2 (for constraint 2).
5. Put down brown_block_2.
6. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_1.
7. Put down green_block_1 (for constraint 13).
8. Unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1.
9. Stack black_block_2 on green_block_1 (for constraint 9).
10. Unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1 (for constraints 1 and 8).
11. Put down black_block_3.
12. Pick up grey_block_1.
13. Stack grey_block_1 on black_block_3 (for constraint 10).
14. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_3.
15. Pick up black_block_3 (to achieve the goal).

Ok, this plan seems to be one step less, so let's go with this:

```
unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2
stack green_block_1 black_block_1
pickup brown_block_2
putdown brown_block_2
unstack green_block_1 black_block_1
putdown green_block_1
unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
stack black_block_2 green_block_1
unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1
putdown black_block_3
pickup grey_block_1
stack grey_block_1 black_block_3
unstack grey_block_1 black_block_3
pickup black_block_3
```

Actually, I think this plan is slightly less optimal than the previous one given our objective. We need to "pickup black_block_1" and "putdown black_block_1" in the first plan.

But in this new one, we need to "unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2" -> "stack green_block_1 black_block_1" and later "unstack green_block_1 black_block_1" -> "putdown green_block_1". That's 4 steps instead of 2.

So, I think our original plan is actually more optimal:

```
unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2
putdown green_block_1
pickup brown_block_2
putdown brown_block_2
unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
stack black_block_2 green_block_1
pickup black_block_1
putdown black_block_1
unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1
putdown black_block_3
pickup grey_block_1
stack grey_block_1 black_block_3
unstack grey_block_1 black_block_3
pickup black_block_3
```

You know what, I think I got confused earlier. Let me double check both plans.

Plan 1:
```
unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2
putdown green_block_1
pickup brown_block_2
putdown brown_block_2
unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
stack black_block_2 green_block_1
pickup black_block_1
putdown black_block_1
unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1
putdown black_block_3
pickup grey_block_1
stack grey_block_1 black_block_3
unstack grey_block_1 black_block_3
pickup black_block_3
```
This has 16 steps.

Plan 2:
```
unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2
stack green_block_1 black_block_1
pickup brown_block_2
putdown brown_block_2
unstack green_block_1 black_block_1
putdown green_block_1
unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
stack black_block_2 green_block_1
unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1
putdown black_block_3
pickup grey_block_1
stack grey_block_1 black_block_3
unstack grey_block_1 black_block_3
pickup black_block_3
```
This also has 16 steps.

But actually now that I look at it, I'm concerned about the feasibility of Plan 2. Let me reconsider:

Initial state:
- brown_block_1 is on the table with black_block_3 on top of it. black_block_3 is clear.
- brown_block_2 is on the table with green_block_1 on top of it. grey_block_1 is on top of green_block_1. grey_block_1 is clear.
- black_block_1 is on the table with black_block_2 on top of it. black_block_2 is clear.

After we unstack grey_block_1 from green_block_1, green_block_1 becomes clear. After we unstack green_block_1 from brown_block_2, we want to stack green_block_1 on black_block_1.

But wait, black_block_1 has black_block_2 on top of it, so it's not clear. We can't stack green_block_1 on black_block_1 directly. We would first need to unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1, stack green_block_1 on black_block_1, and then... this gets complicated if we want to have both green_block_1 and black_block_2 on the table at some point, which we do because we need to stack black_block_2 on green_block_1 later.

I think Plan 1 is more straightforward and probably is closer to the optimal solution. Let's go with it:

```
unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2
putdown green_block_1
pickup brown_block_2
putdown brown_block_2
unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
stack black_block_2 green_block_1
pickup black_block_1
putdown black_block_1
unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1
putdown black_block_3
pickup grey_block_1
stack grey_block_1 black_block_3
unstack grey_block_1 black_block_3
pickup black_block_3
```

I don't think I can refine it further with the constraints we have. This plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal of holding black_block_3.

Now, let's check my understanding of the constraints once more to make sure I haven't misunderstood any of them.

(Actually, we can try another plan involving stacking brown_block_1 on black_block_1 for constraint 5, but I think this would end up being more complex and not lead to a more optimal plan.)

Ok, the final plan:

```
unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2
putdown green_block_1
pickup brown_block_2
putdown brown_block_2
unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
stack black_block_2 green_block_1
pickup black_block_1
putdown black_block_1
unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1
putdown black_block_3
pickup grey_block_1
stack grey_block_1 black_block_3
unstack grey_block_1 black_block_3
pickup black_block_3
```
