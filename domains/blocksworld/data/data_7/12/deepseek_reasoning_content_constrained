Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to make sure that black_block_1 is clear. Right now, black_block_1 has green_block_2 on top, which in turn has yellow_block_3. So to clear black_block_1, we need to remove green_block_2 and yellow_block_3 from it. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy as well. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the initial state. Let's list out the blocks and their positions:

- green_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top, which has yellow_block_2 on top. So the stack is green_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 -> yellow_block_2. Yellow_block_2 is clear.
- black_block_1 is on the table with green_block_2 on top, which has yellow_block_3 on top. So black_block_1 -> green_block_2 -> yellow_block_3. Yellow_block_3 is clear.
- grey_block_1 is on the table and clear.

The goal is to have black_block_1 clear. So we need to remove green_block_2 from black_block_1. But to do that, we need to first remove yellow_block_3 from green_block_2. Let's start by dealing with yellow_block_3 and green_block_2.

Constraints to consider:

1. At least one state must have either holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3.
2. In every state, yellow_block_3 is not on the table. So yellow_block_3 must always be on a block, never on the table.
3. At some point, black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1. But if that's true, then black_block_1 must not be on the table either in that state or later.
4. At some point, yellow_block_1 is on grey_block_1.
5. At some point, green_block_2 is clear. When that happens, there must be an earlier state where either holding yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 is not on yellow_block_1.
6. At some state, grey_block_1 is not clear (has a block on top) and yellow_block_2 is on the table.
7. At some state, green_block_1 is not clear. When this happens, we must hold yellow_block_2 in that state or later.

Hmm. Let's start with the main goal. To clear black_block_1, we need to unstack green_block_2 from it. But green_block_2 has yellow_block_3 on top. So first, we need to unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2. Let's do that.

But wait, unstacking yellow_block_3 from green_block_2 requires that yellow_block_3 is clear (which it is) and that the arm is empty. So:

1. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2. Now the arm holds yellow_block_3. Then we need to put it somewhere. But constraint 2 says yellow_block_3 can't be on the table. So we have to stack it on another block. Where? Maybe on grey_block_1. Because if we stack it on grey_block_1, that satisfies constraint 1 (grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3? Wait, no. The first constraint requires that in at least one state, either we are holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3. Wait, the wording is "grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3"? Or is it the other way around? Wait, the constraint says "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'you are holding grey_block_1', 'grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3'". So either we hold grey_block_1, or grey_block_1 is under yellow_block_3. Wait, no, "on top of". So grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3 would mean yellow_block_3 is below grey_block_1. But that's possible. Alternatively, we could hold grey_block_1 at some point.

But let's see. If we stack yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1, then grey_block_1 is clear (since it's under yellow_block_3). Wait, no. If you stack a block on another, the lower block becomes not clear. So stacking yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1 would make grey_block_1 not clear. But in that case, yellow_block_3 is on grey_block_1. Then, in that state, the second part of the first constraint is not satisfied (grey_block_1 is under yellow_block_3, not on top). Wait, no, the constraint is "grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3" which would mean grey_block_1 is above yellow_block_3. So that would require putting grey_block_1 on top of yellow_block_3, which is not possible unless we move grey_block_1. But grey_block_1 is on the table initially. So to put grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3, we need to pick up grey_block_1 and stack it on yellow_block_3. But yellow_block_3 is on green_block_2 in the initial state. Wait, no: initial state has yellow_block_3 on green_block_2. So we could unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2, then stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3. But that would require first moving yellow_block_3 somewhere else. Wait, but stacking grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3 would require that yellow_block_3 is clear. But if we unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2, then we can put it somewhere else. Maybe stack it on grey_block_1. Then later, we can pick up grey_block_1 (after putting down yellow_block_3) and stack it on yellow_block_3. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe during the plan, we can have a state where we are holding grey_block_1. For example, after putting down yellow_block_3, we could pick up grey_block_1. That would satisfy the first constraint. Let's consider that approach.

But let's step back. To get green_block_2 off black_block_1, we need to first remove yellow_block_3 from it. So:

Action 1: unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2. Now holding yellow_block_3. Then, we need to put it somewhere. Since it can't be on the table (constraint 2), we need to stack it on another block. Possible options: stack it on grey_block_1. So:

Action 2: stack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1. Now, yellow_block_3 is on grey_block_1. This makes grey_block_1 not clear, and yellow_block_3 clear. Now, grey_block_1 is under yellow_block_3, so in this state, the condition "grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3" is not true. So this doesn't satisfy the first constraint. So maybe this isn't the right move. Alternatively, stack yellow_block_3 on another block. But what other blocks are available? Let's see. green_block_1 has yellow_block_1 and yellow_block_2. So maybe stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2? But yellow_block_2 is clear. So:

Action 2: stack yellow_block_3 yellow_block_2. Now yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_2, which is on yellow_block_1. But wait, yellow_block_2 is on yellow_block_1. So stacking yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2 would require that yellow_block_2 is clear, which it is. But after stacking, yellow_block_2 is not clear. Then, when we need to unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1, we might need to first remove yellow_block_3. But maybe that's okay. However, the first constraint requires that either we hold grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3. If we stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2, then grey_block_1 is still on the table. So we don't satisfy the first constraint yet. So perhaps we need to involve grey_block_1 in some way.

Alternatively, after unstacking yellow_block_3 from green_block_2, we could stack it on grey_block_1. Then, later in the plan, we need to pick up grey_block_1 (which is under yellow_block_3) which is not possible unless we first unstack yellow_block_3. So that might complicate things. But maybe during the process of moving grey_block_1, we can hold it. Let's think: Suppose after stacking yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1, then to satisfy constraint 1, we need to either hold grey_block_1 or have grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3. Since grey_block_1 is under yellow_block_3, the second part is not true. So the only way is to hold grey_block_1 at some point. But to hold grey_block_1, we need to unstack yellow_block_3 from grey_block_1 first. So:

Action 1: unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2
Action 2: stack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1
Now, to get grey_block_1, we need to unstack yellow_block_3 from grey_block_1:

Action 3: unstack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1
Action 4: putdown yellow_block_3 (but constraint 2 says yellow_block_3 cannot be on the table. So we can't put it down. So this is invalid. So we have to stack it somewhere else. Maybe stack it on another block. But where? The only other possible blocks are green_block_1, yellow_block_1, yellow_block_2, black_block_1 (which has green_block_2), but green_block_2 is still on black_block_1. Wait, after action 2, green_block_2 is clear, right? Because we unstacked yellow_block_3 from green_block_2. So green_block_2 is on black_block_1 and clear. So maybe stack yellow_block_3 on green_block_2 again. But that would just bring us back. Hmm. Alternatively, stack it on another block. But all other blocks are part of stacks. Maybe we need to rearrange other blocks.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of stacking yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1, we can hold it and then stack it somewhere else. Wait, but after unstacking yellow_block_3 from green_block_2, we have to put it somewhere that's not the table. Let's see:

After unstacking yellow_block_3, we have to stack it. Let's say we stack it on grey_block_1. Then, in that state, we are not holding grey_block_1, so the first constraint isn't met. So maybe we need to have a step where we pick up grey_block_1. But how? Since grey_block_1 is under yellow_block_3, we can't pick it up unless we first remove yellow_block_3. So perhaps we need to first stack yellow_block_3 elsewhere, then pick up grey_block_1. But that would take more steps.

Alternatively, maybe we can satisfy the first constraint by holding grey_block_1 at some other point. For example, after handling other blocks. Let's think: after dealing with green_block_2 and black_block_1, maybe we need to move grey_block_1. Let's see.

Continuing with the main goal. After removing yellow_block_3 from green_block_2, we need to unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. So:

Action 1: unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2
Action 2: stack yellow_block_3 [somewhere]
Action 3: unstack green_block_2 black_block_1 (since green_block_2 is now clear)
But to unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1, we need to be holding nothing. After action 2, we might be holding nothing. Let's say after action 2, we have stacked yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1. Then, action 3: unstack green_block_2 black_block_1. Now holding green_block_2. Then, we need to put it somewhere. Since the goal is to have black_block_1 clear, we can put green_block_2 on the table. But wait, the constraint says that yellow_block_3 must never be on the table. But green_block_2 can be put on the table. So:

Action 4: putdown green_block_2. Now black_block_1 is clear. That achieves the goal. But we need to check the constraints.

But let's check the constraints:

First constraint: At least one state where we hold grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3. In the current plan, after action 2, grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3 on top. So "grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3" is false because yellow_block_3 is on grey_block_1. So the condition is "grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3" which would require that grey_block_1 is above yellow_block_3, which isn't the case. So this doesn't satisfy the first constraint. Therefore, in the current plan, we haven't satisfied the first constraint yet.

So we need to ensure that either we hold grey_block_1 at some point or place grey_block_1 on top of yellow_block_3. Let's think: If we can stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3, that would satisfy the second part of the first constraint. But to do that, we need to have yellow_block_3 somewhere clear. So maybe after stacking yellow_block_3 on another block, we can pick up grey_block_1 and stack it on yellow_block_3. But where is yellow_block_3? Let's say after action 1, we unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2 and stack it on, say, yellow_block_2. Then yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_2. Then, we can pick up grey_block_1 (since it's on the table and clear) and stack it on yellow_block_3. But wait, yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_2. So stacking grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3 would require that yellow_block_3 is clear. But after stacking yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2, yellow_block_3 is clear (since we just placed it there). So:

Action 1: unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2
Action 2: stack yellow_block_3 yellow_block_2 (now yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_2)
Action 3: pickup grey_block_1 (since it's on the table and clear, and the arm is empty)
Action 4: stack grey_block_1 yellow_block_3 (now grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3, satisfying the first constraint)
Now, after action 4, grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3, which is on yellow_block_2. This satisfies the first constraint's second condition. So that's good. Also, action 3 satisfies the first condition (holding grey_block_1) in state after action 3. So either way, the first constraint is satisfied.

But then, we have to continue with the main plan. Now, after action 4, we need to unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. But green_block_2 is still on black_block_1. To unstack green_block_2, since it's clear (since we removed yellow_block_3 earlier), we can do:

Action 5: unstack green_block_2 black_block_1 (preconditions: green_block_2 is on black_block_1, green_block_2 is clear, arm is empty. After action 4, the arm is empty. So yes.)

Now holding green_block_2. Then, we need to put it down:

Action 6: putdown green_block_2. Now black_block_1 is clear. Goal achieved. But we need to check other constraints.

But let's check all constraints step by step.

Constraints:

1. Must hold in at least one state: holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3. Action 3 (holding) and action 4 (grey on yellow) both satisfy this. So covered.

2. Every state: yellow_block_3 not on table. In initial state, yellow_block_3 is on green_block_2 (not table). After action 2, on yellow_block_2. After action 4, on yellow_block_2 with grey on it. So never on table. Good.

3. At least one state: black_block_1 not on grey_block_1. Initially, black_block_1 is on table. So "black_block_1 not on grey_block_1" is true in initial state. So this is already satisfied. But the fourth constraint says that if in some state s, black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1, then in s or later, black_block_1 is not on the table. Wait, initial state: black_block_1 is on the table. So according to the fourth constraint, if in any state, black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1 (which is true in the initial state), then black_block_1 must not be on the table in that state or later. But in the initial state, black_block_1 is on the table, and the constraint requires that either in that state or later, black_block_1 is not on the table. But in our plan, after action 5 and 6, green_block_2 is put on the table, but black_block_1 remains on the table. Wait, no: black_block_1 is on the table throughout. So in the initial state, we have the condition that black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1 (since it's on the table), but the constraint requires that in that case, black_block_1 must not be on the table in that state or later. However, the initial state has black_block_1 on the table, and the constraint says that if in state s (like initial state), black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1, then in s or later, black_block_1 must not be on the table. But in our plan, black_block_1 remains on the table, so this violates the constraint. So this is a problem.

Ah, this is a critical point. So the fourth constraint says that if at any state, black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1 (which is true in the initial state), then in that state or a later one, black_block_1 must not be on the table. But in our current plan, black_block_1 is on the table in all states. Therefore, this violates the fourth constraint. So we need to ensure that black_block_1 is not on the table at some point after the state where it's not on grey_block_1.

But how? Because the initial state already violates this unless we change the position of black_block_1. Wait, but in the initial state, black_block_1 is on the table, and the constraint says that whenever black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1 (which is always true in the initial state and in our plan), then in that state or later, black_block_1 must not be on the table. So we have to move black_block_1 off the table. But black_block_1 is a block; can we stack it on another block? But in the initial state, black_block_1 is on the table with green_block_2 on top. So to move black_block_1, we need to first clear it by removing green_block_2. But our goal is to make black_block_1 clear, which would require green_block_2 to be removed. So after removing green_block_2, black_block_1 is clear and on the table. To satisfy the fourth constraint, we need to move black_block_1 off the table. But the goal is just to have black_block_1 clear, regardless of its position. So perhaps, after removing green_block_2 from black_block_1, we need to stack black_block_1 on another block to get it off the table.

But wait, the goal is only that black_block_1 is clear. If black_block_1 is on the table and clear, that's acceptable. But according to the fourth constraint, if in any state, black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1, then in that state or later, black_block_1 must not be on the table. So in the initial state, black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1 and is on the table. Therefore, to satisfy the constraint, we must have a state where black_block_1 is not on the table. So we need to move black_block_1 onto another block. But how?

Let's revise the plan. After removing green_block_2 from black_block_1, we have black_block_1 on the table and clear. To satisfy the fourth constraint, we need to move black_block_1 onto another block. Let's say we stack black_block_1 on grey_block_1. But in that case, we need to pick up black_block_1, which is on the table and clear. So:

After action 6: putdown green_block_2, black_block_1 is clear on the table.

Then:

Action 7: pickup black_block_1 (possible since it's clear and on table, arm is empty)
Action 8: stack black_block_1 grey_block_1 (assuming grey_block_1 is clear. But after action 4, grey_block_1 is under yellow_block_3 and grey_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top of yellow_block_3? Wait, no: action 4 was stack grey_block_1 yellow_block_3. Wait, no. Let me check the previous steps.

Wait, after action 4: stack grey_block_1 yellow_block_3. So grey_block_1 is now on top of yellow_block_3. Wait, no: stack's syntax is stack x y, which places x on y. So in action 4, stack grey_block_1 yellow_block_3 would place grey_block_1 on top of yellow_block_3. But yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_2, which is on yellow_block_1, which is on green_block_1. So after stacking grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3, grey_block_1 is now the top of that stack. So yellow_block_3 is under grey_block_1. So grey_block_1 is clear, and yellow_block_3 is not clear. So in action 7, when we pick up black_block_1, which is on the table and clear, then stack it on grey_block_1 (which is clear), that's possible.

Wait, but after action 4, grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3. So grey_block_1 is clear (since nothing is on it), and yellow_block_3 is under grey_block_1. So when we stack black_block_1 on grey_block_1, that's allowed.

So:

Action 7: pickup black_block_1
Action 8: stack black_block_1 grey_block_1

Now, black_block_1 is on grey_block_1. So black_block_1 is not on the table. This satisfies the fourth constraint: in the initial state, black_block_1 was not on grey_block_1 and was on the table. Now, after action 8, black_block_1 is not on the table. So the constraint is satisfied because in the initial state (s), black_block_1 was not on grey_block_1, and in a later state (after action 8), black_block_1 is not on the table.

But wait, the fourth constraint says that if in some state s, black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1, then in s or a later state, black_block_1 is not on the table. So in the initial state, s0, black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1, so by the constraint, in s0 or later, black_block_1 must not be on the table. But in s0, it is on the table, so we need to have a later state where it's not on the table. Our action 8 achieves that.

So this part is okay now.

But now, the goal is to have black_block_1 clear. After action 8, black_block_1 is on grey_block_1. Is black_block_1 clear? Yes, because nothing is on top of it. Wait, no: black_block_1 is on grey_block_1, and if nothing is on top of black_block_1, then it's clear. But our goal is to have black_block_1 clear. So if we stack black_block_1 on grey_block_1, then black_block_1 is clear, which satisfies the goal. But wait, the goal is "there is no block on top of black_block_1". So yes, that's satisfied. But the original goal was to clear black_block_1, which in the initial state, it wasn't because green_block_2 was on it. Now, after action 8, black_block_1 is on grey_block_1 and has nothing on top. So the goal is achieved. But wait, the problem's goal is to have "black_block_1 is clear", regardless of where it is. So whether it's on the table or on another block, as long as nothing is on top, it's clear. So in this case, after action 8, black_block_1 is clear (no blocks on top), so the goal is satisfied. But we need to check if the fourth constraint is satisfied.

But the fourth constraint requires that if in any state s, black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1, then in s or later, black_block_1 is not on the table. In our current plan, after action 8, black_block_1 is on grey_block_1, so in that state, it's on grey_block_1. But in earlier states (before action 8), black_block_1 is on the table. So the initial state and states up to action 7 have black_block_1 on the table. The fourth constraint says that whenever black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1 (which is true in all states before action 8), then in those states or later, black_block_1 must not be on the table. So in those states (s0 to s7), black_block_1 is on the table, which violates the constraint unless in some later state (after s7) it's not on the table. Which it is after action 8. So for each state s where black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1 (which is all states up to action 8), in s or later, there must be a state where black_block_1 is not on the table. So for s0 (initial state), the later state s8 satisfies that black_block_1 is not on the table. For s1 (after action 1), in s8 it's not on the table. So the constraint is satisfied.

Okay, that's handled.

Next constraint: At least one state where yellow_block_1 is on grey_block_1. So we need to have a step where yellow_block_1 is stacked on grey_block_1.

Currently, in the plan up to action 8, yellow_block_1 is under yellow_block_2 and green_block_1. So we need to move yellow_block_1 to grey_block_1.

Let's think. To stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1, we need to unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1. But yellow_block_1 has yellow_block_2 on top. So first, we need to remove yellow_block_2.

So:

Action 9: unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1. Preconditions: yellow_block_2 is clear (which it is after action 2?), wait, after action 2, we stacked yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2, but then in action 4, we stacked grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3. So the stack is green_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 -> yellow_block_2 -> yellow_block_3 -> grey_block_1. Wait, no: let's clarify the stack after each action.

Initial stack on green_block_1: green_block_1 (table), yellow_block_1 on it, yellow_block_2 on yellow_block_1. After action 2: stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2. So green_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 -> yellow_block_2 -> yellow_block_3. Then action 4: stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3. So now, green_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 -> yellow_block_2 -> yellow_block_3 -> grey_block_1. So yellow_block_2 has yellow_block_3 on top, which has grey_block_1. So to unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1, we need to first remove yellow_block_3 and grey_block_1. But that's a long chain.

Alternatively, perhaps we need to restructure the plan to allow moving yellow_block_1.

But this is getting complicated. Let's try to see where in the current plan we can insert this.

After action 8, the current state is:

- black_block_1 is on grey_block_1 (clear)
- green_block_2 is on the table (clear)
- grey_block_1 has black_block_1 on top and is under yellow_block_3, which is under grey_block_1? Wait, no. Let me retrace:

Action 1: unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2 (arm holds yellow_block_3)
Action 2: stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2 (now yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_2)
Action 3: pickup grey_block_1
Action 4: stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3 (now grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3, which is on yellow_block_2)
Action 5: unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1 (arm holds green_block_2)
Action 6: putdown green_block_2 (on table)
Action 7: pickup black_block_1
Action 8: stack black_block_1 on grey_block_1

So the stack on green_block_1 is: green_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 -> yellow_block_2 -> yellow_block_3 -> grey_block_1 -> black_block_1.

So to get yellow_block_1 off green_block_1 and onto grey_block_1, we need to unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1. But yellow_block_1 has yellow_block_2 on top. So we need to remove yellow_block_2, yellow_block_3, grey_block_1, and black_block_1 first. That's a lot.

Alternatively, perhaps after action 8, we can start moving the blocks from the top down. Let's see:

After action 8, the stack on green_block_1 is:

green_block_1 (table) -> yellow_block_1 -> yellow_block_2 -> yellow_block_3 -> grey_block_1 -> black_block_1.

To unstack yellow_block_1, we need to remove all blocks above it. So:

First, unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_1:

Action 9: unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1 (preconditions: black_block_1 is on grey_block_1, clear, arm empty. After action 8, arm is empty. Yes.)

Action 9: unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1. Now holding black_block_1.

Action 10: putdown black_block_1. But this would put it on the table. But the fourth constraint requires that after s0, black_block_1 is not on the table. So this would violate the constraint. So we can't put it down. Instead, stack it somewhere else. But where? Let's stack it on green_block_2, which is on the table.

Action 10: stack black_block_1 green_block_2. Now black_block_1 is on green_block_2. Green_block_2 is clear (since it's on the table and nothing is on top before this action). Now, after stacking, green_block_2 is not clear. But that's okay.

Then, we need to unstack grey_block_1 from yellow_block_3:

Action 11: unstack grey_block_1 yellow_block_3. Preconditions: grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3, clear, arm empty. Yes, after action 10, arm is empty.

Action 11: unstack grey_block_1 yellow_block_3. Now holding grey_block_1.

Action 12: stack grey_block_1 yellow_block_1. Wait, yellow_block_1 is under yellow_block_2. So yellow_block_1 is not clear. Can't stack on it. Alternatively, stack on green_block_2, which has black_block_1. But green_block_2 is not clear. Alternatively, put grey_block_1 on the table. But constraint 1 may already be satisfied, but putting it on the table is allowed except for yellow_block_3. So:

Action 12: putdown grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 is on the table and clear. Then, we can unstack yellow_block_3 from yellow_block_2:

Action 13: unstack yellow_block_3 yellow_block_2. Holding yellow_block_3.

Action 14: stack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1. Now yellow_block_3 is on grey_block_1.

Then, unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1:

Action 15: unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1. Now holding yellow_block_2.

Action 16: stack yellow_block_2 grey_block_1. Now yellow_block_2 is on yellow_block_3.

Then, unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1:

Action 17: unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1. Holding yellow_block_1.

Action 18: stack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1. Now yellow_block_1 is on yellow_block_2.

Wait, this is getting too long. But we need to get yellow_block_1 onto grey_block_1. Let's see if there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, after action 8, perhaps we can find a different path. For example, after stacking black_block_1 on grey_block_1, we can then move grey_block_1 with black_block_1 on top to some other place, but that's complicated.

Alternatively, maybe we can rearrange the order of actions to satisfy the yellow_block_1 constraint earlier.

Let me think differently. Maybe after removing green_block_2 from black_block_1 and putting it down, then moving black_block_1 to grey_block_1, we can focus on moving yellow_block_1.

But this is getting very complex. Let's see if there's a better approach.

Alternative plan:

1. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2. Hold yellow_block_3.
2. Stack yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3 on top. This satisfies constraint 1's second condition (grey_block_1 is under yellow_block_3, so the condition isn't met). So need to hold grey_block_1 at some point.

3. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. Now hold green_block_2.
4. Putdown green_block_2. Now black_block_1 is clear. Goal achieved, but need to handle constraints.

But constraint 3 requires that black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1 at least once. In the initial state, it's not, so that's covered. But the fourth constraint requires that if black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1 (as in initial state), then in that state or later, it's not on the table. So we need to move black_block_1 off the table.

So after step 4, pick up black_block_1 and stack it on another block. For example:

5. Pickup black_block_1.
6. Stack black_block_1 on grey_block_1. Now, black_block_1 is on grey_block_1, which has yellow_block_3. So the stack is grey_block_1 -> yellow_block_3 -> black_block_1. Wait, no: step 2 stacked yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1. So grey_block_1 is under yellow_block_3. To stack black_block_1 on grey_block_1, we need to unstack yellow_block_3 first. So this approach isn't possible.

Alternative: after step 4, stack black_block_1 on green_block_2 (which is on the table).

5. Pickup black_block_1.
6. Stack black_block_1 green_block_2. Now, green_block_2 has black_block_1 on top. This gets black_block_1 off the table, satisfying the fourth constraint.

Now, to satisfy the fifth constraint: at least one state where yellow_block_1 is on grey_block_1. So we need to move yellow_block_1 to grey_block_1.

But yellow_block_1 is under yellow_block_2 and yellow_block_3. So we need to remove those first.

7. Unstack yellow_block_3 from grey_block_1. Hold yellow_block_3.
8. Stack yellow_block_3 somewhere else. Since it can't be on the table, perhaps stack it on green_block_2 (which has black_block_1, but black_block_1 is clear).

But stack requires that the target block is clear. So black_block_1 is clear (after step 6), so:

8. Stack yellow_block_3 black_block_1. Now yellow_block_3 is on black_block_1.

Then, unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1:

9. Unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1. Hold yellow_block_2.
10. Stack yellow_block_2 grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 is clear (after step 7), so this is possible.

Now, unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1:

11. Unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1. Hold yellow_block_1.
12. Stack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1. Now, yellow_block_1 is on grey_block_1, satisfying the fifth constraint.

But this is getting very long. Are there any other constraints we're missing?

Constraint 6: At least one state where green_block_2 is clear. In step 4, after putting down green_block_2, it's clear. So that's covered. Then, when we stack black_block_1 on it (step 6), green_block_2 is not clear anymore. So the state after step 4 has green_block_2 clear. So that's good. Then, the seventh constraint says that if green_block_2 is clear in some state, then there must be an earlier state where either holding yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 is not on yellow_block_1. In our current plan, the state after step 4 has green_block_2 clear. The earlier states are steps 1-4. In step 3, we unstack green_block_2, which requires that yellow_block_3 was moved in step 1. But to unstack green_block_2, we need it to be clear. Which it becomes after step 1. But the seventh constraint says that when green_block_2 is clear (state after step 4), there must be an earlier state where either holding yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 is not on yellow_block_1. Before step 4, we have steps 1-3. In step 1, we moved yellow_block_3. In step 2, stacked it on grey_block_1. Then unstack green_block_2. So before step 4, yellow_block_2 is still on yellow_block_1. So the condition "yellow_block_2 is not on yellow_block_1" is not true. Also, we haven't held yellow_block_1 yet. So this violates the seventh constraint.

Ah, right. The seventh constraint requires that if green_block_2 is clear (state after step 4), then there must be an earlier state where either we are holding yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 is not on yellow_block_1. But in the current plan, before step 4, yellow_block_2 is still on yellow_block_1. And we haven't held yellow_block_1. So this constraint is violated. Therefore, we need to ensure that before green_block_2 becomes clear, either we hold yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 is not on yellow_block_1.

How can we achieve that? We need to either remove yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1 before step 3 (unstacking green_block_2) or hold yellow_block_1 before step 3.

But in the initial state, yellow_block_2 is on yellow_block_1. To unstack green_block_2, we first have to unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2 (step 1), then unstack green_block_2. But yellow_block_2 is still on yellow_block_1. So to satisfy the seventh constraint, before step 4 (where green_block_2 is clear), we need to have a state where either we are holding yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 is not on yellow_block_1.

So perhaps we need to move yellow_block_2 off yellow_block_1 before unstacking green_block_2. But how?

Let's revise the plan:

Action 1: unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1. Preconditions: yellow_block_2 is clear (which it is initially). So this is possible.

Action 2: putdown yellow_block_2. But constraint 2 requires that yellow_block_3 is never on the table, but yellow_block_2 can be. So this is allowed.

Now, yellow_block_2 is on the table. Then, unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2.

Action 3: unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2.

Action 4: stack yellow_block_3 yellow_block_1. Since yellow_block_1 is clear now (after action 1). So yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_1.

Action 5: unstack green_block_2 black_block_1.

Action 6: putdown green_block_2. Now, in state after action 6, green_block_2 is clear. The seventh constraint requires that before this state, there was a state where either holding yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 not on yellow_block_1. Action 1 moved yellow_block_2 to the table, satisfying the second condition (yellow_block_2 not on yellow_block_1). So this satisfies the seventh constraint.

But this approach changes the order of actions. Let's see if this works.

But this is getting very complicated. Given the time constraints, I think I need to craft a plan that satisfies all the constraints step by step.

Let me try to outline a possible plan:

1. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2. (Holding yellow_block_3)
2. Stack yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1. (Now grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3, satisfying constraint 1's second option if needed, but not yet. However, we need to hold grey_block_1 or have it on top of yellow_block_3.)
3. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. (Holding green_block_2)
4. Putdown green_block_2. (Now black_block_1 is clear. Now, green_block_2 is clear, triggering constraint 6. The seventh constraint requires that before this state, either holding yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 not on yellow_block_1. Currently, yellow_block_2 is still on yellow_block_1. So this is a problem. So we need to move yellow_block_2 first.)

Revised steps:

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. (Holding yellow_block_2)
2. Putdown yellow_block_2. (Now yellow_block_2 is on table, satisfying the seventh constraint's second option when green_block_2 becomes clear later.)
3. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2. (Holding yellow_block_3)
4. Stack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1. (Now grey_block_1 is under yellow_block_3. Need to hold grey_block_1 later.)
5. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. (Holding green_block_2)
6. Putdown green_block_2. (Now black_block_1 is clear. Seventh constraint satisfied because step 2 moved yellow_block_2.)
7. Pickup black_block_1. (To move it off table per constraint 4)
8. Stack black_block_1 grey_block_1. (Now black_block_1 is on grey_block_1, which is under yellow_block_3. Now, black_block_1 is clear.)
9. Unstack grey_block_1 from yellow_block_3. (Need to unstack yellow_block_3 first?) Wait, grey_block_1 is under yellow_block_3. To unstack grey_block_1, we have to unstack everything above it. So this isn't possible. Instead, we need to move yellow_block_3 first.

Alternative step 8: stack black_block_1 yellow_block_2. (Yellow_block_2 is on the table, clear.)

8. Stack black_block_1 yellow_block_2. (Now black_block_1 is on yellow_block_2, off the table. Satisfies constraint 4.)

Now, to satisfy constraint 5: yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1.

9. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1. (Holding yellow_block_1)
10. Stack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1. (Grey_block_1 is on the table (after step 4?), no. Wait, after step 4, grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3. So grey_block_1 is under yellow_block_3. To stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1, we need grey_block_1 to be clear. But it's under yellow_block_3. So we need to move yellow_block_3 first.

Hmm. This is getting too tangled. Given the time, I'll try to write a plan that meets all constraints, even if it's longer.

Final Plan Steps:

1. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2
2. stack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1
3. pickup grey_block_1 (Can't, because yellow_block_3 is on it. So this is invalid.)
Wait, after step 2, grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3 on top. So to pickup grey_block_1, we need to first unstack yellow_block_3. So:

3. unstack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_3 (Invalid, can't be on table)
So stack elsewhere.

4. stack yellow_block_3 yellow_block_2
5. pickup grey_block_1
6. stack grey_block_1 yellow_block_3 (Now grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3, satisfying constraint 1)
7. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1
8. putdown green_block_2
9. pickup black_block_1
10. stack black_block_1 grey_block_1
11. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
12. putdown yellow_block_2
13. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1
14. stack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1

This plan should satisfy:

- Goal: black_block_1 clear (after step 10)
- Constraint 1: step 6 (grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3)
- Constraint 2: yellow_block_3 never on table
- Constraint 3: black_block_1 not on grey_block_1 initially, but after step 10, it is. So need another state where it's not. Hmm, no. Wait, the third constraint requires that in at least one state, black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1. Initially, it's not. So satisfied.
- Constraint 4: black_block_1 not on grey_block_1 in initial state, so must have later state where it's not on table. After step 10, it's on grey_block_1, so not on table. Satisfied.
- Constraint 5: step 14, yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1
- Constraint 6: green_block_2 clear after step 8
- Constraint 7: when green_block_2 is clear (step 8), earlier state step 11 where yellow_block_2 is moved from yellow_block_1
- Constraint 8: at least one state where grey_block_1 is not clear (step 6, grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3 and grey_block_1 on top) and yellow_block_2 on table (step 12)
- Constraint 9: green_block_1 not clear initially (has yellow_block_1). So satisfied.
- Constraint 10: when green_block_1 is not clear (which it is in many states), must hold yellow_block_2 in that state or later. In step 11, we unstack yellow_block_2, so we hold it in step 11. So when green_block_1 is not clear (like in initial state), there is a later state (step 11) where we hold yellow_block_2. Satisfied.

This seems to meet all constraints. Now, let's write the actions in order.
