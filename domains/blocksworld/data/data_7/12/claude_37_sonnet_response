Let's go through this planning problem step-by-step.

First, I'll formalize the initial state of the world:
- green_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
- black_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1
- yellow_block_3 is on top of green_block_2
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_2 is clear
- yellow_block_3 is clear
- grey_block_1 is clear
- The robotic arm is not holding any block

The goal is:
- black_block_1 is clear

Additionally, there are several constraints that I need to satisfy. Let me go through them one by one and understand what they mean.

1. Constraint: "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'you are holding grey_block_1', 'grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3'" must hold in at least one state.
   - This means at some point during execution of the plan, I need to either hold grey_block_1 or place grey_block_1 on top of yellow_block_3.

2. Constraint: "yellow_block_3 is not on the table" must hold in every state.
   - This means I can never put yellow_block_3 on the table.

3. Constraint: "black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - This means at some point, black_block_1 should not be on top of grey_block_1. From the initial state, black_block_1 is on the table, not on grey_block_1, so this constraint is satisfied initially.

4. Constraint: If "black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1" holds in some state s, then "black_block_1 is not on the table" must hold at s or at some state after s.
   - This means once black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1, I need to ensure that black_block_1 is not on the table at that state or in a future state.

5. Constraint: "yellow_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - This means at some point, I need to place yellow_block_1 on top of grey_block_1.

6. Constraint: "there is no block on top of green_block_2, i.e., green_block_2 is clear" must hold in at least one state.
   - This means at some point, green_block_2 must be clear.

7. Constraint: If "there is no block on top of green_block_2, i.e., green_block_2 is clear" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'you are holding yellow_block_1', 'yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1'" is true.
   - This means before green_block_2 becomes clear, I must have held yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 must not be on top of yellow_block_1.

8. Constraint: "The following conditions are all true: 'there is a block on top of grey_block_1, i.e., grey_block_1 is not clear', 'yellow_block_2 is on the table'" must hold in at least one state.
   - This means at some point, grey_block_1 must not be clear (i.e., have a block on top of it) and yellow_block_2 must be on the table.

9. Constraint: "there is a block on top of green_block_1, i.e., green_block_1 is not clear" must hold in at least one state.
   - This means at some point, green_block_1 must not be clear (i.e., have a block on top of it).

10. Constraint: If "there is a block on top of green_block_1, i.e., green_block_1 is not clear" holds in some state s, then "you are holding yellow_block_2" must hold at s or at some state after s.
    - This means once green_block_1 is not clear, I must hold yellow_block_2 at that state or in a future state.

Let's think about a plan to achieve the goal while satisfying all constraints.

The initial state looks like this:
- green_block_1 (on table)
  - yellow_block_1
    - yellow_block_2 (clear)
- black_block_1 (on table)
  - green_block_2
    - yellow_block_3 (clear)
- grey_block_1 (clear, on table)

The goal is to make black_block_1 clear. Currently, it has green_block_2 on top of it, and green_block_2 has yellow_block_3 on top of it. So we need to remove those blocks.

Let's start by creating a plan:

1. First, let's ensure constraint 2 (yellow_block_3 is not on the table) is not violated. I should never put yellow_block_3 on the table.

2. To make black_block_1 clear, I need to remove green_block_2 and yellow_block_3 from it.
   - To remove yellow_block_3, I need to unstack it. But where do I put it? According to constraint 2, I can't put it on the table. One option is to stack it on top of grey_block_1, yellow_block_2, or keep holding it.
   - After removing yellow_block_3, I can remove green_block_2 from black_block_1.

3. For constraint 1 (either hold grey_block_1 or stack it on yellow_block_3), I can pick up grey_block_1 at some point or stack it on yellow_block_3.

4. For constraint 5, I need to place yellow_block_1 on top of grey_block_1 at some point.

5. For constraint 6, I need to make green_block_2 clear at some point.

6. For constraint 7, before making green_block_2 clear, I need to ensure either I'm holding yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1.

7. For constraint 8, at some point grey_block_1 should have a block on top of it and yellow_block_2 should be on the table.

8. For constraint 9, green_block_1 should have a block on top of it at some point (initially, it has yellow_block_1 on top, so this is already satisfied).

9. For constraint 10, after green_block_1 has a block on top of it, I need to hold yellow_block_2 at that state or in a future state.

Let's try to create a plan that satisfies these constraints:

1. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2 (Now I'm holding yellow_block_3)
2. stack yellow_block_3 yellow_block_2 (Now yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_2, not on the table)
3. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1 (Now I'm holding green_block_2 and black_block_1 is clear, which is our goal)
4. stack green_block_2 green_block_1 (Now green_block_2 is on green_block_1)
5. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1 (Now I'm holding yellow_block_2)
6. putdown yellow_block_2 (Now yellow_block_2 is on the table)
7. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1 (Now I'm holding yellow_block_1)
8. stack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1 (Now yellow_block_1 is on grey_block_1, satisfying constraint 5)
9. unstack yellow_block_3 yellow_block_2 (Now I'm holding yellow_block_3)
10. stack yellow_block_3 yellow_block_1 (Now yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_1, not on the table)
11. pickup grey_block_1 (Now I'm holding grey_block_1, satisfying constraint 1)
12. putdown grey_block_1 (Now grey_block_1 is on the table)

Wait, I realize that this plan doesn't fully satisfy all the constraints. Let me re-evaluate.

Specifically, constraint 8 requires that at some point grey_block_1 must not be clear (i.e., have a block on top of it) and yellow_block_2 must be on the table. This constraint is met at step 8 of our plan.

Constraint 7 says that before green_block_2 becomes clear, I must have held yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 must not be on top of yellow_block_1. In our plan, green_block_2 becomes clear when we unstack yellow_block_3 from it in step 1. But at this point, I haven't held yellow_block_1 yet and yellow_block_2 is still on top of yellow_block_1.

Let's revise the plan:

1. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1 (Now I'm holding yellow_block_2, and yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1, satisfying part of constraint 7)
2. putdown yellow_block_2 (Now yellow_block_2 is on the table)
3. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2 (Now I'm holding yellow_block_3 and green_block_2 is clear, satisfying constraint 6, and since yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1, constraint 7 is also satisfied)
4. stack yellow_block_3 yellow_block_2 (Now yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_2, not on the table)
5. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1 (Now I'm holding green_block_2 and black_block_1 is clear, which is our goal)
6. stack green_block_2 green_block_1 (Now green_block_2 is on green_block_1)
7. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1 (Now I'm holding yellow_block_1)
8. stack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1 (Now yellow_block_1 is on grey_block_1, satisfying constraint 5 and part of constraint 8)
9. unstack yellow_block_3 yellow_block_2 (Now I'm holding yellow_block_3)
10. stack yellow_block_3 yellow_block_1 (Now yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_1, not on the table)
11. pickup yellow_block_2 (Now I'm holding yellow_block_2, satisfying constraint 10)
12. putdown yellow_block_2 (Now yellow_block_2 is on the table, completing constraint 8)
13. pickup grey_block_1 (Now I'm holding grey_block_1, satisfying constraint 1)
14. putdown grey_block_1 (Now grey_block_1 is on the table)

Wait, there's an issue with constraint 10. It says if green_block_1 is not clear (has a block on top), then I must hold yellow_block_2 at that state or in a future state. In our plan, green_block_1 has blocks on top (yellow_block_1, and then green_block_2), but I don't hold yellow_block_2 immediately after.

Let's revise further:

1. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1 (Now I'm holding yellow_block_2, yellow_block_1 is clear, and yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1, satisfying part of constraint 7)
2. putdown yellow_block_2 (Now yellow_block_2 is on the table)
3. pickup yellow_block_2 (Now I'm holding yellow_block_2, addressing constraint 10 since green_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on top)
4. putdown yellow_block_2 (Now yellow_block_2 is on the table)
5. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2 (Now I'm holding yellow_block_3 and green_block_2 is clear, satisfying constraint 6, and since yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1, constraint 7 is also satisfied)
6. stack yellow_block_3 yellow_block_2 (Now yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_2, not on the table)
7. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1 (Now I'm holding green_block_2 and black_block_1 is clear, which is our goal)
8. stack green_block_2 green_block_1 (Now green_block_2 is on green_block_1)
9. pickup yellow_block_2 (Now I'm holding yellow_block_2, addressing constraint 10 since green_block_1 has green_block_2 on top)
10. putdown yellow_block_2 (Now yellow_block_2 is on the table)
11. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1 (Now I'm holding yellow_block_1)
12. stack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1 (Now yellow_block_1 is on grey_block_1, satisfying constraint 5 and part of constraint 8 because grey_block_1 is not clear)
13. unstack yellow_block_3 yellow_block_2 (Now I'm holding yellow_block_3)
14. stack yellow_block_3 yellow_block_1 (Now yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_1, not on the table, and yellow_block_2 is on the table, satisfying constraint 8)
15. pickup grey_block_1 (Now I'm holding grey_block_1, satisfying constraint 1 because I'm holding grey_block_1)
16. putdown grey_block_1 (Now grey_block_1 is on the table)

Wait, there's an issue with constraints 3 and 4. Constraint 3 requires that at some point, black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1. In our initial state, black_block_1 is on the table, not on grey_block_1, so this constraint is already satisfied. But constraint 4 says that once black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1, I need to ensure that black_block_1 is not on the table at that state or in a future state.

This means at some point, I need to move black_block_1 off the table. Let's revise again:

1. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1 (Now I'm holding yellow_block_2, and yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1, satisfying part of constraint 7)
2. putdown yellow_block_2 (Now yellow_block_2 is on the table)
3. pickup yellow_block_2 (Now I'm holding yellow_block_2, addressing constraint 10 since green_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on top)
4. putdown yellow_block_2 (Now yellow_block_2 is on the table)
5. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2 (Now I'm holding yellow_block_3 and green_block_2 is clear, satisfying constraint 6, and since yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1, constraint 7 is also satisfied)
6. stack yellow_block_3 yellow_block_2 (Now yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_2, not on the table)
7. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1 (Now I'm holding green_block_2 and black_block_1 is clear, which is our goal)
8. stack green_block_2 green_block_1 (Now green_block_2 is on green_block_1)
9. pickup yellow_block_2 (Now I'm holding yellow_block_2, addressing constraint 10 since green_block_1 has green_block_2 on top)
10. putdown yellow_block_2 (Now yellow_block_2 is on the table)
11. pickup black_block_1 (Now I'm holding black_block_1, satisfying constraint 4 because black_block_1 is not on the table)
12. stack black_block_1 yellow_block_2 (Now black_block_1 is on yellow_block_2, not on the table, continuing to satisfy constraint 4)
13. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1 (Now I'm holding yellow_block_1)
14. stack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1 (Now yellow_block_1 is on grey_block_1, satisfying constraint 5 and part of constraint 8 because grey_block_1 is not clear)
15. unstack yellow_block_3 yellow_block_1 (Now I'm holding yellow_block_3 and yellow_block_2 is on the table, so constraint 8 is satisfied because grey_block_1 is not clear and yellow_block_2 is on the table)
16. stack yellow_block_3 black_block_1 (Now yellow_block_3 is on black_block_1, not on the table)
17. pickup grey_block_1 (Now I'm holding grey_block_1, satisfying constraint 1 because I'm holding grey_block_1)
18. stack grey_block_1 yellow_block_3 (Now grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3, satisfying constraint 1 because grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3)

Wait, this doesn't work. In step 15, I meant to unstack yellow_block_3 from yellow_block_2, not from yellow_block_1. Let me fix:

1. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1 (Now I'm holding yellow_block_2, and yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1, satisfying part of constraint 7)
2. putdown yellow_block_2 (Now yellow_block_2 is on the table)
3. pickup yellow_block_2 (Now I'm holding yellow_block_2, addressing constraint 10 since green_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on top)
4. putdown yellow_block_2 (Now yellow_block_2 is on the table)
5. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2 (Now I'm holding yellow_block_3 and green_block_2 is clear, satisfying constraint 6, and since yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1, constraint 7 is also satisfied)
6. stack yellow_block_3 yellow_block_2 (Now yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_2, not on the table)
7. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1 (Now I'm holding green_block_2 and black_block_1 is clear, which is our goal)
8. stack green_block_2 green_block_1 (Now green_block_2 is on green_block_1)
9. pickup yellow_block_2 (Now I'm holding yellow_block_2, addressing constraint 10 since green_block_1 has green_block_2 on top)
10. putdown yellow_block_2 (Now yellow_block_2 is on the table)
11. pickup black_block_1 (Now I'm holding black_block_1, satisfying constraint 4 because black_block_1 is not on the table)
12. stack black_block_1 yellow_block_2 (Now black_block_1 is on yellow_block_2, not on the table, continuing to satisfy constraint 4)
13. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1 (Now I'm holding yellow_block_1)
14. stack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1 (Now yellow_block_1 is on grey_block_1, satisfying constraint 5 and part of constraint 8 because grey_block_1 is not clear)
15. unstack yellow_block_3 black_block_1 (Now I'm holding yellow_block_3 and black_block_1 is clear)
16. stack yellow_block_3 yellow_block_1 (Now yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_1, not on the table, and yellow_block_2 is on the table, satisfying constraint 8)
17. pickup grey_block_1 (Now I'm holding grey_block_1, satisfying constraint 1 because I'm holding grey_block_1)
18. stack grey_block_1 yellow_block_3 (Now grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3, satisfying constraint 1 because grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3)

Wait, there's an issue here again. In step 15, I'm trying to unstack yellow_block_3 from black_block_1, but yellow_block_3 is not on black_block_1 at that point; it's on yellow_block_2.

Let me try once more to get the plan right:

1. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1 (Now I'm holding yellow_block_2, and yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1, satisfying part of constraint 7)
2. putdown yellow_block_2 (Now yellow_block_2 is on the table)
3. pickup yellow_block_2 (Now I'm holding yellow_block_2, addressing constraint 10 since green_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on top)
4. putdown yellow_block_2 (Now yellow_block_2 is on the table)
5. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2 (Now I'm holding yellow_block_3 and green_block_2 is clear, satisfying constraint 6, and since yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1, constraint 7 is also satisfied)
6. stack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1 (Now yellow_block_3 is on grey_block_1, not on the table)
7. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1 (Now I'm holding green_block_2 and black_block_1 is clear, which is our goal)
8. stack green_block_2 green_block_1 (Now green_block_2 is on green_block_1)
9. pickup yellow_block_2 (Now I'm holding yellow_block_2, addressing constraint 10 since green_block_1 has green_block_2 on top)
10. putdown yellow_block_2 (Now yellow_block_2 is on the table)
11. pickup black_block_1 (Now I'm holding black_block_1, satisfying constraint 4 because black_block_1 is not on the table)
12. stack black_block_1 yellow_block_2 (Now black_block_1 is on yellow_block_2, not on the table, continuing to satisfy constraint 4)
13. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1 (Now I'm holding yellow_block_1)
14. stack yellow_block_1 yellow_block_3 (Now yellow_block_1 is on yellow_block_3, which is on grey_block_1)
15. pickup grey_block_1 (Now I'm holding grey_block_1, satisfying constraint 1 because I'm holding grey_block_1)
16. putdown grey_block_1 (Now grey_block_1 is on the table)
17. unstack yellow_block_1 yellow_block_3 (Now I'm holding yellow_block_1)
18. stack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1 (Now yellow_block_1 is on grey_block_1, satisfying constraint 5 and part of constraint 8 because grey_block_1 is not clear and yellow_block_2 is on the table, so constraint 8 is satisfied)
19. unstack yellow_block_3 black_block_1 (Now I'm holding yellow_block_3 and black_block_1 is clear)
20. stack yellow_block_3 yellow_block_1 (Now yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_1, not on the table)
21. pickup grey_block_1 (Now I'm holding grey_block_1, satisfying constraint 1 because I'm holding grey_block_1)
22. stack grey_block_1 yellow_block_3 (Now grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3, satisfying constraint 1 because grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3)

Wait, I made another mistake. In step 19, I'm trying to unstack yellow_block_3 from black_block_1, but yellow_block_3 is on grey_block_1 at that point, not on black_block_1.

I need to be more careful. Let me restart and trace the state after each action:

Initial state:
- green_block_1 (on table)
  - yellow_block_1
    - yellow_block_2 (clear)
- black_block_1 (on table)
  - green_block_2
    - yellow_block_3 (clear)
- grey_block_1 (clear, on table)

1. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), black_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on black_block_1), yellow_block_3 (on green_block_2, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), holding yellow_block_2

2. putdown yellow_block_2
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), black_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on black_block_1), yellow_block_3 (on green_block_2, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), yellow_block_2 (on table, clear), not holding anything

3. pickup yellow_block_2
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), black_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on black_block_1), yellow_block_3 (on green_block_2, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), holding yellow_block_2

4. putdown yellow_block_2
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), black_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on black_block_1), yellow_block_3 (on green_block_2, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), yellow_block_2 (on table, clear), not holding anything

5. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), black_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on black_block_1, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), yellow_block_2 (on table, clear), holding yellow_block_3

6. stack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), black_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on black_block_1, clear), grey_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_3 (on grey_block_1, clear), yellow_block_2 (on table, clear), not holding anything

7. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), black_block_1 (on table, clear), grey_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_3 (on grey_block_1, clear), yellow_block_2 (on table, clear), holding green_block_2

8. stack green_block_2 green_block_1
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1), green_block_2 (on yellow_block_1, clear), black_block_1 (on table, clear), grey_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_3 (on grey_block_1, clear), yellow_block_2 (on table, clear), not holding anything

Wait, that's wrong. In step 8, I tried to stack green_block_2 on green_block_1, but green_block_1 is not clear; it has yellow_block_1 on top of it. Let me restart and be more careful:

Initial state:
- green_block_1 (on table)
  - yellow_block_1
    - yellow_block_2 (clear)
- black_block_1 (on table)
  - green_block_2
    - yellow_block_3 (clear)
- grey_block_1 (clear, on table)

1. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), black_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on black_block_1), yellow_block_3 (on green_block_2, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), holding yellow_block_2

2. putdown yellow_block_2
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), black_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on black_block_1), yellow_block_3 (on green_block_2, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), yellow_block_2 (on table, clear), not holding anything

3. pickup yellow_block_2
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), black_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on black_block_1), yellow_block_3 (on green_block_2, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), holding yellow_block_2

4. putdown yellow_block_2
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), black_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on black_block_1), yellow_block_3 (on green_block_2, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), yellow_block_2 (on table, clear), not holding anything

Now, let's take steps to satisfy constraint 5 (yellow_block_1 on top of grey_block_1):

5. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), black_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on black_block_1, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), yellow_block_2 (on table, clear), holding yellow_block_3

6. stack yellow_block_3 yellow_block_2
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), black_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on black_block_1, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), yellow_block_2 (on table), yellow_block_3 (on yellow_block_2, clear), not holding anything

7. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1
   - State: green_block_1 (on table, clear), black_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on black_block_1, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), yellow_block_2 (on table), yellow_block_3 (on yellow_block_2, clear), holding yellow_block_1

8. stack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1
   - State: green_block_1 (on table, clear), black_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on black_block_1, clear), grey_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on grey_block_1, clear), yellow_block_2 (on table), yellow_block_3 (on yellow_block_2, clear), not holding anything

Now, let's unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1 to make black_block_1 clear (our goal):

9. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1
   - State: green_block_1 (on table, clear), black_block_1 (on table, clear), grey_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on grey_block_1, clear), yellow_block_2 (on table), yellow_block_3 (on yellow_block_2, clear), holding green_block_2

10. stack green_block_2 green_block_1
    - State: green_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on green_block_1, clear), black_block_1 (on table, clear), grey_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on grey_block_1, clear), yellow_block_2 (on table), yellow_block_3 (on yellow_block_2, clear), not holding anything

Now, for constraint 4, I need to move black_block_1 off the table since it's not on top of grey_block_1:

11. pickup black_block_1
    - State: green_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on green_block_1, clear), grey_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on grey_block_1, clear), yellow_block_2 (on table), yellow_block_3 (on yellow_block_2, clear), holding black_block_1

12. stack black_block_1 green_block_2
    - State: green_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on green_block_1), black_block_1 (on green_block_2, clear), grey_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on grey_block_1, clear), yellow_block_2 (on table), yellow_block_3 (on yellow_block_2, clear), not holding anything

Wait, now black_block_1 is not clear, which contradicts our goal. Let me rethink this.

Actually, I misunderstood constraint 4. It says once black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1, black_block_1 should not be on the table. Black_block_1 is initially not on top of grey_block_1, and constraint 4 requires that at some point, black_block_1 is not on the table. This doesn't mean black_block_1 can't be on the table at the end.

Let me restart once more:

Initial state:
- green_block_1 (on table)
  - yellow_block_1
    - yellow_block_2 (clear)
- black_block_1 (on table)
  - green_block_2
    - yellow_block_3 (clear)
- grey_block_1 (clear, on table)

1. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), black_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on black_block_1), yellow_block_3 (on green_block_2, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), holding yellow_block_2

2. putdown yellow_block_2
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), black_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on black_block_1), yellow_block_3 (on green_block_2, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), yellow_block_2 (on table, clear), not holding anything

This satisfies constraint 7 (yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1), which is needed before making green_block_2 clear.

3. pickup yellow_block_2
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), black_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on black_block_1), yellow_block_3 (on green_block_2, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), holding yellow_block_2

4. putdown yellow_block_2
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), black_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on black_block_1), yellow_block_3 (on green_block_2, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), yellow_block_2 (on table, clear), not holding anything

5. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), black_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on black_block_1, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), yellow_block_2 (on table, clear), holding yellow_block_3

This satisfies constraint 6 (green_block_2 is clear).

6. stack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), black_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on black_block_1, clear), grey_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_3 (on grey_block_1, clear), yellow_block_2 (on table, clear), not holding anything

7. pickup black_block_1
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), green_block_2 (on table, clear), grey_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_3 (on grey_block_1, clear), yellow_block_2 (on table, clear), holding black_block_1

This satisfies constraint 4 (black_block_1 is not on the table).

8. stack black_block_1 yellow_block_2
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), green_block_2 (on table, clear), grey_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_3 (on grey_block_1, clear), yellow_block_2 (on table), black_block_1 (on yellow_block_2, clear), not holding anything

9. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1
   - State: green_block_1 (on table, clear), green_block_2 (on table, clear), grey_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_3 (on grey_block_1, clear), yellow_block_2 (on table), black_block_1 (on yellow_block_2, clear), holding yellow_block_1

10. stack yellow_block_1 yellow_block_3
    - State: green_block_1 (on table, clear), green_block_2 (on table, clear), grey_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_3 (on grey_block_1), yellow_block_1 (on yellow_block_3, clear), yellow_block_2 (on table), black_block_1 (on yellow_block_2, clear), not holding anything

11. pickup green_block_2
    - State: green_block_1 (on table, clear), grey_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_3 (on grey_block_1), yellow_block_1 (on yellow_block_3, clear), yellow_block_2 (on table), black_block_1 (on yellow_block_2, clear), holding green_block_2

12. stack green_block_2 green_block_1
    - State: green_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on green_block_1, clear), grey_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_3 (on grey_block_1), yellow_block_1 (on yellow_block_3, clear), yellow_block_2 (on table), black_block_1 (on yellow_block_2, clear), not holding anything

13. pickup yellow_block_2
    - State: green_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on green_block_1, clear), grey_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_3 (on grey_block_1), yellow_block_1 (on yellow_block_3, clear), black_block_1 (on table, clear), holding yellow_block_2

This satisfies constraint 10 (I'm holding yellow_block_2 after green_block_1 is not clear).

14. putdown yellow_block_2
    - State: green_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on green_block_1, clear), grey_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_3 (on grey_block_1), yellow_block_1 (on yellow_block_3, clear), black_block_1 (on table, clear), yellow_block_2 (on table, clear), not holding anything

15. pickup grey_block_1
    - State: green_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on green_block_1, clear), yellow_block_3 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on yellow_block_3, clear), black_block_1 (on table, clear), yellow_block_2 (on table, clear), holding grey_block_1

This satisfies constraint 1 (I'm holding grey_block_1).

16. stack grey_block_1 black_block_1
    - State: green_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on green_block_1, clear), yellow_block_3 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on yellow_block_3, clear), black_block_1 (on table), grey_block_1 (on black_block_1, clear), yellow_block_2 (on table, clear), not holding anything

Our goal was to make black_block_1 clear, but now it's not clear because grey_block_1 is on top of it. This is a mistake.

Let me rethink the plan:

Initial state:
- green_block_1 (on table)
  - yellow_block_1
    - yellow_block_2 (clear)
- black_block_1 (on table)
  - green_block_2
    - yellow_block_3 (clear)
- grey_block_1 (clear, on table)

Goal: black_block_1 is clear.

Let's go constraint by constraint:

1. Constraint 1: At some point, either hold grey_block_1 or stack it on yellow_block_3.
2. Constraint 2: yellow_block_3 is never on the table.
3. Constraint 3: At some point, black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1 (already satisfied in the initial state).
4. Constraint 4: At some point after constraint 3 is satisfied, black_block_1 is not on the table.
5. Constraint 5: At some point, yellow_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1.
6. Constraint 6: At some point, green_block_2 is clear.
7. Constraint 7: Before green_block_2 becomes clear, either hold yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1.
8. Constraint 8: At some point, grey_block_1 is not clear and yellow_block_2 is on the table.
9. Constraint 9: At some point, green_block_1 is not clear (already satisfied in the initial state).
10. Constraint 10: At some point after constraint 9 is satisfied, hold yellow_block_2.

Let's start by making yellow_block_2 not on top of yellow_block_1 (part of constraint 7):

1. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), black_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on black_block_1), yellow_block_3 (on green_block_2, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), holding yellow_block_2

2. putdown yellow_block_2
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), black_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on black_block_1), yellow_block_3 (on green_block_2, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), yellow_block_2 (on table, clear), not holding anything

Now, let's make green_block_2 clear (constraint 6), which is allowed because yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1 (constraint 7):

3. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), black_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on black_block_1, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), yellow_block_2 (on table, clear), holding yellow_block_3

4. stack yellow_block_3 yellow_block_2
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), black_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on black_block_1, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), yellow_block_2 (on table), yellow_block_3 (on yellow_block_2, clear), not holding anything

5. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), black_block_1 (on table, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), yellow_block_2 (on table), yellow_block_3 (on yellow_block_2, clear), holding green_block_2

Black_block_1 is now clear, which satisfies our goal! However, we still need to satisfy the remaining constraints.

6. stack green_block_2 green_block_1
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on green_block_1), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_2, clear), black_block_1 (on table, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), yellow_block_2 (on table), yellow_block_3 (on yellow_block_2, clear), not holding anything

7. pickup yellow_block_2
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on green_block_1), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_2, clear), black_block_1 (on table, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), yellow_block_3 (on table, clear), holding yellow_block_2

This satisfies constraint 10 (holding yellow_block_2 after green_block_1 is not clear).

Wait, this doesn't work. In step 6, I'm trying to stack green_block_2 on green_block_1, but green_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on top of it, so it's not clear. Let me reconsider.

Let me restart the plan:

1. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), black_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on black_block_1), yellow_block_3 (on green_block_2, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), holding yellow_block_2

2. putdown yellow_block_2
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), black_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on black_block_1), yellow_block_3 (on green_block_2, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), yellow_block_2 (on table, clear), not holding anything

3. pickup yellow_block_2
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), black_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on black_block_1), yellow_block_3 (on green_block_2, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), holding yellow_block_2

This satisfies constraint 10 (holding yellow_block_2 after green_block_1 is not clear, since green_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on top).

4. putdown yellow_block_2
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), black_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on black_block_1), yellow_block_3 (on green_block_2, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), yellow_block_2 (on table, clear), not holding anything

5. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), black_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on black_block_1, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), yellow_block_2 (on table, clear), holding yellow_block_3

6. stack yellow_block_3 yellow_block_2
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), black_block_1 (on table), green_block_2 (on black_block_1, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), yellow_block_2 (on table), yellow_block_3 (on yellow_block_2, clear), not holding anything

7. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), black_block_1 (on table, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), yellow_block_2 (on table), yellow_block_3 (on yellow_block_2, clear), holding green_block_2

Black_block_1 is now clear, which satisfies our goal!

8. pickup black_block_1
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), yellow_block_2 (on table), yellow_block_3 (on yellow_block_2, clear), holding black_block_1, holding green_block_2

Wait, I can't hold two blocks at once. I need to put green_block_2 down first:

8. putdown green_block_2
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), black_block_1 (on table, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), yellow_block_2 (on table), yellow_block_3 (on yellow_block_2, clear), green_block_2 (on table, clear), not holding anything

9. pickup black_block_1
   - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), yellow_block_2 (on table), yellow_block_3 (on yellow_block_2, clear), green_block_2 (on table, clear), holding black_block_1

This satisfies constraint 4 (black_block_1 is not on the table).

10. putdown black_block_1
    - State: green_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on green_block_1, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), yellow_block_2 (on table), yellow_block_3 (on yellow_block_2, clear), green_block_2 (on table, clear), black_block_1 (on table, clear), not holding anything

11. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1
    - State: green_block_1 (on table, clear), grey_block_1 (clear, on table), yellow_block_2 (on table), yellow_block_3 (on yellow_block_2, clear), green_block_2 (on table, clear), black_block_1 (on table, clear), holding yellow_block_1

12. stack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1
    - State: green_block_1 (on table, clear), grey_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (on grey_block_1, clear), yellow_block_2 (on table), yellow_block_3 (on yellow_block_2, clear), green_block_2 (on table, clear), black_block_1 (on table, clear), not holding anything

This satisfies constraint 5 (yellow_block_1 on top of grey_block_1) and constraint 8 (grey_block_1 is not clear and yellow_block_2 is on the table).

13. pickup grey_block_1
    - State: green_block_1 (on table, clear), yellow_block_1 (on table, clear), yellow_block_2 (on table), yellow_block_3 (on yellow_block_2, clear), green_block_2 (on table, clear), black_block_1 (on table, clear), holding grey_block_1

This satisfies constraint 1 (holding grey_block_1).

14. putdown grey_block_1
    - State: green_block_1 (on table, clear), yellow_block_1 (on table, clear), yellow_block_2 (on table), yellow_block_3 (on yellow_block_2, clear), green_block_2 (on table, clear), black_block_1 (on table, clear), grey_block_1 (on table, clear), not holding anything

Let's check all constraints now:

1. ✓ Constraint 1: At some point, either hold grey_block_1 or stack it on yellow_block_3.
2. ✓ Constraint 2: yellow_block_3 is never on the table.
3. ✓ Constraint 3: At some point, black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1.
4. ✓ Constraint 4: At some point after constraint 3 is satisfied, black_block_1 is not on the table.
5. ✓ Constraint 5: At some point, yellow_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1.
6. ✓ Constraint 6: At some point, green_block_2 is clear.
7. ✓ Constraint 7: Before green_block_2 becomes clear, either hold yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1.
8. ✓ Constraint 8: At some point, grey_block_1 is not clear and yellow_block_2 is on the table.
9. ✓ Constraint 9: At some point, green_block_1 is not clear.
10. ✓ Constraint 10: At some point after constraint 9 is satisfied, hold yellow_block_2.

Our final plan is:

1. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_2
3. pickup yellow_block_2
4. putdown yellow_block_2
5. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2
6. stack yellow_block_3 yellow_block_2
7. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1
8. putdown green_block_2
9. pickup black_block_1
10. putdown black_block_1
11. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1
12. stack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1
13. pickup grey_block_1
14. putdown grey_block_1

I think this plan satisfied all constraints and achieves the goal. I double checked all the constraints and they should be met.
