Let me first understand the current state of the world and the constraints I need to satisfy.

In the current state:
- blue_block_1 is on the table and clear
- black_block_1 is on the table with blue_block_3 on top of it
- blue_block_2 is on the table with white_block_2 on top of it
- blue_block_3 is on top of black_block_1 and clear
- white_block_1 is on the table and clear
- white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_2 and clear
- brown_block_1 is on the table and clear
- I'm not holding any block

The goal is to be holding white_block_1.

Let me analyze the constraints:

1. "white_block_1 is not on the table" must be true at some point.
2. If "white_block_1 is not on the table", then "blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2" OR "blue_block_3 is on the table" must be true at that point or later.
3. "there is a block on top of white_block_1" must be true at some point.
4. If "there is a block on top of white_block_1", then "you are holding white_block_2" must be true at some earlier point.
5. "blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2" must be true at some point.
6. "white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_3" OR "blue_block_2 is clear" must be true at some point.
7. "brown_block_1 is not on the table" OR "blue_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1" must be true at some point.
8. "brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2" must be true at some point.
9. If "brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2", then "there is a block on top of brown_block_1" must be true at that point or later.
10. "there is a block on top of brown_block_1" OR "brown_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" must be true at some point.

Let me plan a sequence of actions to satisfy all constraints and reach the goal state.

Constraint 8 is trivially satisfied since brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2 initially. However, constraint 9 requires that there is a block on top of brown_block_1 at some point. So I'll need to place a block on top of brown_block_1.

Constraint 5 requires that blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2 at some point. This will also satisfy constraint 2 if white_block_1 is not on the table at that time.

Constraint 3 requires a block on top of white_block_1 at some point. Constraint 4 requires that I'm holding white_block_2 at some earlier point.

Constraint 7 requires either brown_block_1 is not on the table OR blue_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1. If I place blue_block_3 on top of brown_block_1, I satisfy this constraint.

Constraint 10 requires either a block on top of brown_block_1 OR brown_block_1 is on top of white_block_1. If I place a block on top of brown_block_1, I satisfy this constraint.

Constraint 6 requires either white_block_1 on top of blue_block_3 OR blue_block_2 is clear. If I move white_block_2 off blue_block_2, then blue_block_2 will be clear.

Let me try to craft a plan:

1. First, let's satisfy constraint 4 by picking up white_block_2:
   - unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
   This also satisfies the part of constraint 6 about blue_block_2 being clear.

2. Then let's satisfy constraint 3 by stacking white_block_2 on white_block_1:
   - stack white_block_2 white_block_1

3. Let's move blue_block_3 to satisfy constraint 5:
   - unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
   - stack blue_block_3 white_block_2
   This also helps with constraint 2.

4. Now let's move white_block_1 to satisfy constraint 1:
   - unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
   - stack white_block_2 blue_block_2
   - pickup white_block_1
   This also moves towards the goal state.

However, this plan doesn't satisfy all the constraints yet. Let me try a different approach.

Actually, let me trace through this plan more carefully and see if it satisfies all constraints:

1. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
   State: white_block_2 is held, blue_block_2 is clear, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: part of constraint 6 (blue_block_2 is clear) and constraint 4 (holding white_block_2).

2. stack white_block_2 white_block_1
   State: white_block_2 is on white_block_1, white_block_1 is on the table, white_block_1 is not clear, white_block_2 is clear.
   Satisfied: constraint 3 (there is a block on top of white_block_1).

3. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
   State: blue_block_3 is held, black_block_1 is clear, white_block_2 on white_block_1.
   No additional constraints satisfied yet.

4. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2
   State: blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on white_block_1, white_block_1 on table.
   Satisfied: constraint 5 (blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2).

5. unstack blue_block_3 white_block_2
   State: blue_block_3 is held, white_block_2 on white_block_1 is clear.
   No additional constraints satisfied yet.

6. stack blue_block_3 brown_block_1
   State: blue_block_3 on brown_block_1, brown_block_1 on table, white_block_2 on white_block_1.
   Satisfied: constraint 7 (blue_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1) and constraint 10 (there is a block on top of brown_block_1).

7. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
   State: white_block_2 is held, white_block_1 on table is clear, blue_block_3 on brown_block_1.
   No additional constraints satisfied yet.

8. stack white_block_2 blue_block_1
   State: white_block_2 on blue_block_1, white_block_1 on table is clear, blue_block_3 on brown_block_1.
   No additional constraints satisfied yet.

9. unstack blue_block_3 brown_block_1
   State: blue_block_3 is held, brown_block_1 on table is clear, white_block_2 on blue_block_1.
   No additional constraints satisfied yet.

10. stack blue_block_3 white_block_1
    State: blue_block_3 on white_block_1, white_block_1 on table, white_block_2 on blue_block_1.
    Satisfied: constraint 3 (there is a block on top of white_block_1).

11. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1
    State: white_block_2 is held, blue_block_1 on table is clear, blue_block_3 on white_block_1.
    No additional constraints satisfied yet.

12. stack white_block_2 black_block_1
    State: white_block_2 on black_block_1, blue_block_3 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.
    No additional constraints satisfied yet.

13. unstack blue_block_3 white_block_1
    State: blue_block_3 is held, white_block_1 on table is clear, white_block_2 on black_block_1.
    No additional constraints satisfied yet.

14. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2
    State: blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on black_block_1, white_block_1 on table is clear.
    Satisfied: constraint 5 (blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2).

15. pickup white_block_1
    State: white_block_1 is held, blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on black_block_1.
    Satisfied: goal (you are holding white_block_1).

But we haven't satisfied all constraints with this plan. Specifically:
- We haven't satisfied constraint 1: "white_block_1 is not on the table" at any point.
- In relation to constraint 2, we don't have "white_block_1 is not on the table" and "blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2" or "blue_block_3 is on the table" at the same time or in sequence.
- We haven't satisfied the part of constraint 6 about "white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_3".
- We haven't satisfied constraint 9 in relation to constraint 8.

Let me modify the plan to satisfy all constraints. Actually, let me start planning from scratch, ensuring all constraints are met.

To satisfy constraint 1, I need to move white_block_1 off the table. To satisfy constraint 3, I need to place a block on top of white_block_1. For constraint 4, I need to first hold white_block_2 before placing a block on white_block_1. For constraint 5, I need to place blue_block_3 on top of white_block_2.

Let's try this plan:

1. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
   This satisfies part of constraint 6 (blue_block_2 is clear) and provides the prerequisite for constraint 4 (holding white_block_2).

2. stack white_block_2 white_block_1
   This satisfies constraint 3 (there is a block on top of white_block_1) and the prerequisite for constraint 4 is already met.

3. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
   This prepares to satisfy constraint 5.

4. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2
   This satisfies constraint 5 (blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2).

5. pickup brown_block_1
   This prepares to satisfy constraint 1.

6. stack brown_block_1 blue_block_1
   This is to rearrange blocks for upcoming moves.

7. unstack blue_block_3 white_block_2
   This prepares to satisfy constraints 7 and 10.

8. stack blue_block_3 brown_block_1
   This satisfies constraint 7 (blue_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1) and constraint 10 (there is a block on top of brown_block_1).

9. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
   This prepares to satisfy constraint 1.

10. pickup white_block_1
    This satisfies constraint 1 (white_block_1 is not on the table).

But wait, I'm not checking if this plan satisfies all constraints. Let me go through the constraints again with this plan:

1. "white_block_1 is not on the table" must be true at some point.
   Satisfied in step 10.

2. If "white_block_1 is not on the table", then "blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2" OR "blue_block_3 is on the table" must be true at that point or later.
   After step 10, neither is true. blue_block_3 is on brown_block_1.

3. "there is a block on top of white_block_1" must be true at some point.
   Satisfied in steps 2-9.

4. If "there is a block on top of white_block_1", then "you are holding white_block_2" must be true at some earlier point.
   Satisfied, as white_block_2 is held in step 1 before being stacked on white_block_1 in step 2.

5. "blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2" must be true at some point.
   Satisfied in steps 4-6.

6. "white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_3" OR "blue_block_2 is clear" must be true at some point.
   blue_block_2 is clear after step 1, so this is satisfied.

7. "brown_block_1 is not on the table" OR "blue_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1" must be true at some point.
   Satisfied in steps 5-10 (brown_block_1 is not on the table) and steps 8-10 (blue_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1).

8. "brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2" must be true at some point.
   Trivially satisfied as brown_block_1 is never on top of blue_block_2 in the plan.

9. If "brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2", then "there is a block on top of brown_block_1" must be true at that point or later.
   Satisfied in steps 8-10 when blue_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1.

10. "there is a block on top of brown_block_1" OR "brown_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" must be true at some point.
    Satisfied in steps 8-10 when blue_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1.

I still have an issue with constraint 2. Let me refine the plan:

1. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
   State: holding white_block_2, blue_block_2 clear, all else unchanged.

2. stack white_block_2 white_block_1
   State: white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: constraint 3 and constraint 4.

3. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
   State: holding blue_block_3, black_block_1 clear, all else unchanged.

4. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2
   State: blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: constraint 5.

5. unstack blue_block_3 white_block_2
   State: holding blue_block_3, white_block_2 on white_block_1 and clear, all else unchanged.

6. putdown blue_block_3
   State: blue_block_3 on table and clear, white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.

7. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
   State: holding white_block_2, white_block_1 on table and clear, blue_block_3 on table, all else unchanged.

8. stack white_block_2 blue_block_1
   State: white_block_2 on blue_block_1, white_block_1 on table and clear, blue_block_3 on table, all else unchanged.

9. pickup white_block_1
   State: holding white_block_1, white_block_2 on blue_block_1, blue_block_3 on table, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: constraint 1.

Note that at step 9, white_block_1 is not on the table (satisfying constraint 1) and blue_block_3 is on the table (satisfying constraint 2).

However, I still haven't satisfied constraints 7, 9, and 10. Let me refine the plan more:

1. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
   State: holding white_block_2, blue_block_2 clear, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: part of constraint 6 (blue_block_2 is clear).

2. stack white_block_2 white_block_1
   State: white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: constraint 3 and constraint 4.

3. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
   State: holding blue_block_3, black_block_1 clear, all else unchanged.

4. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2
   State: blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: constraint 5.

5. pickup brown_block_1
   State: holding brown_block_1, blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: part of constraint 7 (brown_block_1 is not on the table).

6. putdown brown_block_1
   State: brown_block_1 on table and clear, blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.

7. unstack blue_block_3 white_block_2
   State: holding blue_block_3, white_block_2 on white_block_1 and clear, brown_block_1 on table, all else unchanged.

8. stack blue_block_3 brown_block_1
   State: blue_block_3 on brown_block_1, white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: part of constraint 7 (blue_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1), constraint 9, and constraint 10.

9. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
   State: holding white_block_2, white_block_1 on table and clear, blue_block_3 on brown_block_1, all else unchanged.

10. putdown white_block_2
    State: white_block_2 on table and clear, white_block_1 on table and clear, blue_block_3 on brown_block_1, all else unchanged.

11. pickup white_block_1
    State: holding white_block_1, white_block_2 on table, blue_block_3 on brown_block_1, all else unchanged.
    Satisfied: constraint 1.

Now, let's check all constraints with this plan:

1. "white_block_1 is not on the table" must be true at some point.
   Satisfied in step 11.

2. If "white_block_1 is not on the table", then "blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2" OR "blue_block_3 is on the table" must be true at that point or later.
   Not satisfied. At step 11, white_block_1 is not on the table, but blue_block_3 is on brown_block_1, not on white_block_2 or the table.

Let me refine the plan to ensure all constraints are met:

1. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
   State: holding white_block_2, blue_block_2 clear, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: part of constraint 6 (blue_block_2 is clear).

2. stack white_block_2 white_block_1
   State: white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: constraint 3 and constraint 4.

3. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
   State: holding blue_block_3, black_block_1 clear, all else unchanged.

4. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2
   State: blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: constraint 5.

5. unstack blue_block_3 white_block_2
   State: holding blue_block_3, white_block_2 on white_block_1 and clear, all else unchanged.

6. putdown blue_block_3
   State: blue_block_3 on table and clear, white_block_2 on white_block_1 and clear, all else unchanged.

7. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
   State: holding white_block_2, white_block_1 on table and clear, blue_block_3 on table and clear, all else unchanged.

8. stack white_block_2 blue_block_3
   State: white_block_2 on blue_block_3, white_block_1 on table and clear, all else unchanged.

9. pickup brown_block_1
   State: holding brown_block_1, white_block_2 on blue_block_3, white_block_1 on table and clear, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: part of constraint 7 (brown_block_1 is not on the table).

10. stack brown_block_1 white_block_2
    State: brown_block_1 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on blue_block_3, white_block_1 on table and clear, all else unchanged.
    Satisfied: constraint 10 (brown_block_1 on white_block_1 or there is a block on top of brown_block_1), as brown_block_1 will have a block on top of it later.

11. pickup white_block_1
    State: holding white_block_1, brown_block_1 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on blue_block_3, all else unchanged.
    Satisfied: constraint 1 (white_block_1 is not on the table) and constraint 2 (if white_block_1 is not on the table, then blue_block_3 is on the table), as blue_block_3 is on the table in this state.

12. putdown white_block_1
    State: white_block_1 on table and clear, brown_block_1 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on blue_block_3, all else unchanged.

13. pickup blue_block_1
    State: holding blue_block_1, white_block_1 on table and clear, brown_block_1 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on blue_block_3, all else unchanged.

14. stack blue_block_1 brown_block_1
    State: blue_block_1 on brown_block_1, brown_block_1 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on blue_block_3, white_block_1 on table and clear, all else unchanged.
    Satisfied: constraint 9 (if brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2, there is a block on top of brown_block_1) as blue_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1.

15. pickup white_block_1
    State: holding white_block_1, blue_block_1 on brown_block_1, brown_block_1 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on blue_block_3, all else unchanged.
    Satisfied: goal (you are holding white_block_1).

Let me check all constraints again with this plan:

1. "white_block_1 is not on the table" must be true at some point.
   Satisfied in steps 11 and 15.

2. If "white_block_1 is not on the table", then "blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2" OR "blue_block_3 is on the table" must be true at that point or later.
   Satisfied as blue_block_3 is on the table when white_block_1 is picked up in steps 11 and 15.

3. "there is a block on top of white_block_1" must be true at some point.
   Satisfied in steps 2-7 as white_block_2 is on top of white_block_1.

4. If "there is a block on top of white_block_1", then "you are holding white_block_2" must be true at some earlier point.
   Satisfied as white_block_2 is held in step 1 before being stacked on white_block_1 in step 2.

5. "blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2" must be true at some point.
   Satisfied in steps 4-5.

6. "white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_3" OR "blue_block_2 is clear" must be true at some point.
   Satisfied as blue_block_2 is clear after step 1.

7. "brown_block_1 is not on the table" OR "blue_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1" must be true at some point.
   Satisfied in steps 9-15 as brown_block_1 is not on the table.

8. "brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2" must be true at some point.
   Trivially satisfied as brown_block_1 is never on top of blue_block_2 in the plan.

9. If "brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2", then "there is a block on top of brown_block_1" must be true at that point or later.
   Satisfied in steps 14-15 when blue_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1.

10. "there is a block on top of brown_block_1" OR "brown_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" must be true at some point.
    Satisfied in steps 14-15 when blue_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1.

It looks like all constraints are now satisfied with this plan. However, I'm not satisfied with it because the plan is longer than necessary. Let me simplify it.

I realize that the plan should be shorter if I focus on satisfying only the necessary constraints to reach the goal of holding white_block_1. Since white_block_1 is already on the table and clear, I can simply pick it up. The only reason for complexity is the need to satisfy all the constraints. 

Let's try a more streamlined approach:

1. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
   State: holding white_block_2, blue_block_2 clear, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: part of constraint 6 (blue_block_2 is clear) and prerequisite for constraint 4 (holding white_block_2).

2. stack white_block_2 white_block_1
   State: white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: constraint 3 (there is a block on top of white_block_1) and constraint 4 (white_block_2 was held before).

3. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
   State: holding blue_block_3, black_block_1 clear, all else unchanged.

4. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2
   State: blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: constraint 5 (blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2).

5. pickup brown_block_1
   State: holding brown_block_1, blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: part of constraint 7 (brown_block_1 is not on the table).

6. stack brown_block_1 blue_block_3
   State: brown_block_1 on blue_block_3, blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.

7. pickup blue_block_1
   State: holding blue_block_1, brown_block_1 on blue_block_3, blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.

8. stack blue_block_1 brown_block_1
   State: blue_block_1 on brown_block_1, brown_block_1 on blue_block_3, blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: constraint 9 (if brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2, there is a block on top of brown_block_1) and constraint 10 (there is a block on top of brown_block_1).

9. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
   This step is illegal because white_block_2 has blue_block_3 on top of it.

So I need to rethink my plan. I'm missing some constraints or trying to do illegal moves.

Let's try a different approach:

1. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
   State: holding white_block_2, blue_block_2 clear, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: part of constraint 6 (blue_block_2 is clear) and prerequisite for constraint 4 (holding white_block_2).

2. stack white_block_2 white_block_1
   State: white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: constraint 3 (there is a block on top of white_block_1) and constraint 4 (white_block_2 was held before).

3. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
   State: holding blue_block_3, black_block_1 clear, all else unchanged.

4. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2
   State: blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: constraint 5 (blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2).

5. unstack blue_block_3 white_block_2
   State: holding blue_block_3, white_block_2 on white_block_1 and clear, all else unchanged.

6. putdown blue_block_3
   State: blue_block_3 on table and clear, white_block_2 on white_block_1 and clear, all else unchanged.

7. pickup brown_block_1
   State: holding brown_block_1, blue_block_3 on table and clear, white_block_2 on white_block_1 and clear, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: part of constraint 7 (brown_block_1 is not on the table).

8. stack brown_block_1 blue_block_3
   State: brown_block_1 on blue_block_3, white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.

9. pickup blue_block_1
   State: holding blue_block_1, brown_block_1 on blue_block_3, white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.

10. stack blue_block_1 brown_block_1
    State: blue_block_1 on brown_block_1, brown_block_1 on blue_block_3, white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.
    Satisfied: constraint 9 (if brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2, there is a block on top of brown_block_1) and constraint 10 (there is a block on top of brown_block_1).

11. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
    State: holding white_block_2, white_block_1 on table and clear, blue_block_1 on brown_block_1, brown_block_1 on blue_block_3, all else unchanged.

12. putdown white_block_2
    State: white_block_2 on table and clear, white_block_1 on table and clear, blue_block_1 on brown_block_1, brown_block_1 on blue_block_3, all else unchanged.

13. pickup white_block_1
    State: holding white_block_1, white_block_2 on table and clear, blue_block_1 on brown_block_1, brown_block_1 on blue_block_3, all else unchanged.
    Satisfied: constraint 1 (white_block_1 is not on the table) and goal (you are holding white_block_1).

Let me check if this plan satisfies all constraints:

1. "white_block_1 is not on the table" must be true at some point.
   Satisfied in step 13.

2. If "white_block_1 is not on the table", then "blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2" OR "blue_block_3 is on the table" must be true at that point or later.
   Not satisfied at step 13. When white_block_1 is not on the table, blue_block_3 is neither on top of white_block_2 nor on the table. It's under brown_block_1.

I'm going to try one more approach, focusing on satisfying constraint 2:

1. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
   State: holding white_block_2, blue_block_2 clear, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: part of constraint 6 (blue_block_2 is clear) and prerequisite for constraint 4 (holding white_block_2).

2. stack white_block_2 white_block_1
   State: white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: constraint 3 (there is a block on top of white_block_1) and constraint 4 (white_block_2 was held before).

3. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
   State: holding blue_block_3, black_block_1 clear, all else unchanged.

   Satisfied: part of constraint 7 (brown_block_1 is not on the table).

8. stack brown_block_1 blue_block_1
   State: brown_block_1 on blue_block_1, blue_block_1 on blue_block_3, blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: constraint 9 (if brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2, there is a block on top of brown_block_1 later) and constraint 10 (there is a block on top of brown_block_1 or brown_block_1 is on top of white_block_1) because there will be a block on brown_block_1 later.

9. unstack brown_block_1 blue_block_1
   State: holding brown_block_1, blue_block_1 on blue_block_3, blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.

10. putdown brown_block_1
    State: brown_block_1 on table and clear, blue_block_1 on blue_block_3, blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.

11. unstack blue_block_1 blue_block_3
    State: holding blue_block_1, blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on white_block_1, brown_block_1 on table and clear, all else unchanged.

12. stack blue_block_1 brown_block_1
    State: blue_block_1 on brown_block_1, blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.
    Satisfied: constraint 9 and constraint 10 again.

13. unstack blue_block_3 white_block_2

15. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
    State: holding white_block_2, white_block_1 on table and clear, blue_block_3 on table and clear, blue_block_1 on brown_block_1, all else unchanged.

16. putdown white_block_2
    State: white_block_2 on table and clear, white_block_1 on table and clear, blue_block_3 on table and clear, blue_block_1 on brown_block_1, all else unchanged.

17. pickup white_block_1
    State: holding white_block_1, white_block_2 on table and clear, blue_block_3 on table and clear, blue_block_1 on brown_block_1, all else unchanged.
    Satisfied: constraint 1 (white_block_1 is not on the table) and goal (you are holding white_block_1).

Let me check if this plan satisfies all constraints:

1. "white_block_1 is not on the table" must be true at some point.
   Satisfied in step 17.

2. If "white_block_1 is not on the table", then "blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2" OR "blue_block_3 is on the table" must be true at that point or later.
   Satisfied in step 17, as blue_block_3 is on the table when white_block_1 is not on the table.

3. "there is a block on top of white_block_1" must be true at some point.
   Satisfied in steps 2-15 when white_block_2 is on top of white_block_1.

4. If "there is a block on top of white_block_1", then "you are holding white_block_2" must be true at some earlier point.
   Satisfied as white_block_2 is held in step 1 before being stacked on white_block_1 in step 2.

5. "blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2" must be true at some point.
   Satisfied in steps 4-13.

6. "white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_3" OR "blue_block_2 is clear" must be true at some point.
   Satisfied as blue_block_2 is clear after step 1.

8. "brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2" must be true at some point.
   Trivially satisfied as brown_block_1 is never on top of blue_block_2 in the plan.

   Satisfied in steps 8-9 and 12-17 when there is a block on top of brown_block_1.

10. "there is a block on top of brown_block_1" OR "brown_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" must be true at some point.
    Satisfied in steps 8-9 and 12-17 when there is a block on top of brown_block_1.

All constraints are finally satisfied with this plan. However, the plan is quite long. Let me see if I can find a more optimal solution.

Actually, I'm making this too complicated. Since white_block_1 is initially on the table and clear, I can simply pick it up to achieve the goal. But I need to satisfy all the constraints. Let me try a simpler approach:

1. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
   State: holding white_block_2, blue_block_2 clear, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: part of constraint 6 (blue_block_2 is clear) and prerequisite for constraint 4 (holding white_block_2).

2. stack white_block_2 white_block_1
   State: white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: constraint 3 (there is a block on top of white_block_1) and constraint 4 (white_block_2 was held before).

   Satisfied: part of constraint 7 (brown_block_1 is not on the table).

6. stack brown_block_1 blue_block_3
   State: brown_block_1 on blue_block_3, blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.

7. pickup blue_block_1
   State: holding blue_block_1, brown_block_1 on blue_block_3, blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.

8. stack blue_block_1 brown_block_1
   State: blue_block_1 on brown_block_1, brown_block_1 on blue_block_3, blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: constraint 9 (if brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2, there is a block on top of brown_block_1) and constraint 10 (there is a block on top of brown_block_1).

9. unstack blue_block_1 brown_block_1
   State: holding blue_block_1, brown_block_1 on blue_block_3, blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.

10. putdown blue_block_1
    State: blue_block_1 on table and clear, brown_block_1 on blue_block_3, blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.

11. unstack brown_block_1 blue_block_3
    State: holding brown_block_1, blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on white_block_1, blue_block_1 on table and clear, all else unchanged.

12. putdown brown_block_1
    State: brown_block_1 on table and clear, blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on white_block_1, blue_block_1 on table and clear, all else unchanged.

13. unstack blue_block_3 white_block_2
    State: holding blue_block_3, white_block_2 on white_block_1 and clear, brown_block_1 on table and clear, blue_block_1 on table and clear, all else unchanged.

14. putdown blue_block_3
    State: blue_block_3 on table and clear, white_block_2 on white_block_1 and clear, brown_block_1 on table and clear, blue_block_1 on table and clear, all else unchanged.

15. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
    State: holding white_block_2, white_block_1 on table and clear, blue_block_3 on table and clear, brown_block_1 on table and clear, blue_block_1 on table and clear, all else unchanged.

16. putdown white_block_2
    State: white_block_2 on table and clear, white_block_1 on table and clear, blue_block_3 on table and clear, brown_block_1 on table and clear, blue_block_1 on table and clear, all else unchanged.

17. pickup white_block_1
    State: holding white_block_1, white_block_2 on table and clear, blue_block_3 on table and clear, brown_block_1 on table and clear, blue_block_1 on table and clear, all else unchanged.
    Satisfied: constraint 1 (white_block_1 is not on the table) and goal (you are holding white_block_1).

All constraints are satisfied with this plan, but it's quite long. Let me see if there's a shorter valid plan.

Actually, let me check which actions are really necessary to satisfy all the constraints:
- Constraint a: white_block_1 must be off the table at some point -> This is satisfied by the goal.
- Constraint b: If white_block_1 is off the table, then blue_block_3 must be on white_block_2 or on the table -> We can ensure blue_block_3 is on the table when white_block_1 is picked up.
- Constraint c: A block must be on top of white_block_1 at some point -> We need to stack something on white_block_1.
- Constraint d: If a block is on top of white_block_1, then white_block_2 must have been held earlier -> We need to pick up white_block_2 before stacking something on white_block_1.
- Constraint e: blue_block_3 must be on top of white_block_2 at some point -> We need to stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2.
- Constraint f: white_block_1 must be on top of blue_block_3 or blue_block_2 must be clear at some point -> We can ensure blue_block_2 is clear.
- Constraint g: brown_block_1 must be off the table or blue_block_3 must be on top of brown_block_1 at some point -> We need to pick up brown_block_1 or stack blue_block_3 on brown_block_1.
- Constraint h: brown_block_1 must not be on top of blue_block_2 at some point -> This is trivially satisfied.
- Constraint i: If brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2, then there must be a block on top of brown_block_1 at that point or later -> We need to stack something on brown_block_1.
- Constraint j: There must be a block on top of brown_block_1 or brown_block_1 must be on top of white_block_1 at some point -> We need to stack something on brown_block_1 or stack brown_block_1 on white_block_1.

So, the shortest plan would involve:
1. Picking up white_block_2 (for constraint d).
2. Stacking white_block_2 on white_block_1 (for constraint c).
3. Moving blue_block_3 on top of white_block_2 (for constraint e).
4. Picking up brown_block_1 (for constraint g).
5. Putting a block on top of brown_block_1 (for constraints i and j).
6. Ensuring blue_block_3 is on the table when white_block_1 is picked up (for constraint b).
7. Picking up white_block_1 (for constraint a and the goal).

Let me try a simplified plan:

1. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
   State: holding white_block_2, blue_block_2 clear, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: part of constraint f (blue_block_2 is clear).

2. stack white_block_2 white_block_1
   State: white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: constraint c (there is a block on top of white_block_1) and constraint d (white_block_2 was held before).

3. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
   State: holding blue_block_3, black_block_1 clear, all else unchanged.

4. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2
   State: blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: constraint e (blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2).

5. pickup blue_block_1
   State: holding blue_block_1, blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.

6. stack blue_block_1 brown_block_1
   State: blue_block_1 on brown_block_1, blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: constraint i (if brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2, there is a block on top of brown_block_1) and constraint j (there is a block on top of brown_block_1).

7. unstack blue_block_3 white_block_2
   State: holding blue_block_3, white_block_2 on white_block_1 and clear, blue_block_1 on brown_block_1, all else unchanged.

8. putdown blue_block_3
   State: blue_block_3 on table and clear, white_block_2 on white_block_1 and clear, blue_block_1 on brown_block_1, all else unchanged.

9. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
   State: holding white_block_2, white_block_1 on table and clear, blue_block_3 on table and clear, blue_block_1 on brown_block_1, all else unchanged.

10. putdown white_block_2
    State: white_block_2 on table and clear, white_block_1 on table and clear, blue_block_3 on table and clear, blue_block_1 on brown_block_1, all else unchanged.

11. pickup white_block_1
    State: holding white_block_1, white_block_2 on table and clear, blue_block_3 on table and clear, blue_block_1 on brown_block_1, all else unchanged.
    Satisfied: constraint a (white_block_1 is not on the table), constraint b (if white_block_1 is not on the table, then blue_block_3 is on the table), and the goal (you are holding white_block_1).

Let me check if this plan satisfies all constraints:

1. "white_block_1 is not on the table" must be true at some point.
   Satisfied in step 11.

2. If "white_block_1 is not on the table", then "blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2" OR "blue_block_3 is on the table" must be true at that point or later.
   Satisfied in step 11, as blue_block_3 is on the table when white_block_1 is not on the table.

3. "there is a block on top of white_block_1" must be true at some point.
   Satisfied in steps 2-9 when white_block_2 is on top of white_block_1.

4. If "there is a block on top of white_block_1", then "you are holding white_block_2" must be true at some earlier point.
   Satisfied as white_block_2 is held in step 1 before being stacked on white_block_1 in step 2.

5. "blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2" must be true at some point.
   Satisfied in steps 4-7.

6. "white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_3" OR "blue_block_2 is clear" must be true at some point.
   Satisfied as blue_block_2 is clear after step 1.

7. "brown_block_1 is not on the table" OR "blue_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1" must be true at some point.
   Not satisfied. brown_block_1 remains on the table throughout the plan, and blue_block_3 is never placed on brown_block_1.

So I missed constraint 7. Let me modify the plan:

1. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
   State: holding white_block_2, blue_block_2 clear, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: part of constraint f (blue_block_2 is clear).

2. stack white_block_2 white_block_1
   State: white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: constraint c (there is a block on top of white_block_1) and constraint d (white_block_2 was held before).

3. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
   State: holding blue_block_3, black_block_1 clear, all else unchanged.

4. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2

   State: blue_block_1 on brown_block_1, blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 on white_block_1, all else unchanged.
   Satisfied: constraint i (if brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2, there is a block on top of brown_block_1) and constraint j (there is a block on top of brown_block_1).

9. unstack blue_block_3 white_block_2
   State: holding blue_block_3, white_block_2 on white_block_1 and clear, blue_block_1 on brown_block_1, all else unchanged.

10. putdown blue_block_3
    State: blue_block_3 on table and clear, white_block_2 on white_block_1 and clear, blue_block_1 on brown_block_1, all else unchanged.

11. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
    State: holding white_block_2, white_block_1 on table and clear, blue_block_3 on table and clear, blue_block_1 on brown_block_1, all else unchanged.

12. putdown white_block_2
    State: white_block_2 on table and clear, white_block_1 on table and clear, blue_block_3 on table and clear, blue_block_1 on brown_block_1, all else unchanged.

13. pickup white_block_1
    State: holding white_block_1, white_block_2 on table and clear, blue_block_3 on table and clear, blue_block_1 on brown_block_1, all else unchanged.
    Satisfied: constraint a (white_block_1 is not on the table), constraint b (if white_block_1 is not on the table, then blue_block_3 is on the table), and the goal (you are holding white_block_1).

Let me check if this plan satisfies all constraints:

1. "white_block_1 is not on the table" must be true at some point.
   Satisfied in step 13.

2. If "white_block_1 is not on the table", then "blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2" OR "blue_block_3 is on the table" must be true at that point or later.
   Satisfied in step 13, as blue_block_3 is on the table when white_block_1 is not on the table.

3. "there is a block on top of white_block_1" must be true at some point.
   Satisfied in steps 2-11 when white_block_2 is on top of white_block_1.

4. If "there is a block on top of white_block_1", then "you are holding white_block_2" must be true at some earlier point.
   Satisfied as white_block_2 is held in step 1 before being stacked on white_block_1 in step 2.

   Satisfied in steps 4-9.

   Satisfied in step 5 as brown_block_1 is not on the table.

8. "brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2" must be true at some point.
   Trivially satisfied as brown_block_1 is never on top of blue_block_2 in the plan.

9. If "brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2", then "there is a block on top of brown_block_1" must be true at that point or later.
   Satisfied in steps 8-13 when blue_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1.

10. "there is a block on top of brown_block_1" OR "brown_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" must be true at some point.
    Satisfied in steps 8-13 when blue_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1.

This plan satisfies all constraints. Let me verify it once more to be sure:

I have to hold white_block_1 at the end, so I pick it up in step 13.
Before that, I need to ensure constraint 2 is satisfied, which means blue_block_3 must be on the table or on white_block_2 when white_block_1 is picked up. I ensure it's on the table in step 10.
I need to satisfy constraint 3, which means there must be a block on top of white_block_1 at some point. I satisfy this in step 2 by putting white_block_2 on white_block_1.
For constraint 4, I need to hold white_block_2 before putting any block on white_block_1. I satisfy this in step 1.
For constraint 5, I need to place blue_block_3 on white_block_2 at some point. I do this in step 4.
For constraint 6, I need to have white_block_1 on blue_block_3 or blue_block_2 clear at some point. I satisfy this by having blue_block_2 clear after step 1.
For constraint 7, I need brown_block_1 to be off the table or have blue_block_3 on top of it at some point. I satisfy this in step 5 by picking up brown_block_1.
For constraint 9, since brown_block_1 is never on top of blue_block_2, I need to have a block on top of brown_block_1 at some point. I satisfy this in step 8 by putting blue_block_1 on brown_block_1.
For constraint 10, I need a block on top of brown_block_1 or brown_block_1 on top of white_block_1 at some point. I satisfy this in step 8 with blue_block_1 on brown_block_1.

So all constraints are satisfied, and this is a valid plan. I believe it's also optimal given the constraints, but let me think if there's any shorter plan.

Given that I need to satisfy all constraints, this plan seems to be the shortest possible. The required rearrangements cannot be done in fewer steps.

So my final plan is:

1. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
2. stack white_block_2 white_block_1
3. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
4. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2
5. pickup brown_block_1
6. putdown brown_block_1
7. pickup blue_block_1
8. stack blue_block_1 brown_block_1
9. unstack blue_block_3 white_block_2
10. putdown blue_block_3
11. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
12. putdown white_block_2
13. pickup white_block_1
