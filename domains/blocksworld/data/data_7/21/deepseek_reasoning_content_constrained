Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to have the robotic arm holding white_block_1. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy along the way. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

First, the initial state. Blocks on the table: blue_block_1, black_block_1, blue_block_2, white_block_1, brown_block_1. blue_block_3 is on top of black_block_1. white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_2. All these blocks except the ones under others are clear. The arm is empty.

The goal is to be holding white_block_1. So, to achieve that, we need to perform a pickup or unstack action on white_block_1. But white_block_1 is on the table and clear initially, so we could just pickup white_block_1 directly. Wait, but there are constraints that might require us to do more steps.

Let's look at the constraints one by one.

1. "white_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in at least one state. So, at some point, we have to move white_block_1 off the table. But the final goal is holding it, which means after we pick it up, we haven't put it down again. So maybe after pickup, it's not on the table anymore, but we need to ensure that in some state, which would be after pickup and before putdown (if any). But since the goal is to hold it, the final action might be just pickup. But let's check.

Wait, if the goal is to have the arm holding white_block_1, the plan would end with picking it up. But if we just do that, then during the plan, white_block_1 is picked up (so not on the table), which satisfies the first constraint. But there are more constraints to consider.

Constraint 2: If in some state s, white_block_1 is not on the table, then either blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2 or blue_block_3 is on the table must hold in s or after. So after moving white_block_1, we need to ensure blue_block_3 is either on white_block_2 or on the table. Currently, blue_block_3 is on black_block_1. So maybe we need to move blue_block_3 to white_block_2 or to the table at some point.

Constraint 3: There must be a state where white_block_1 is not clear (has a block on top). So we need to place something on white_block_1. But since the goal is to hold it, maybe after putting something on it, we have to unstack it again. But that might complicate things.

Constraint 4: If white_block_1 is not clear in some state, then in an earlier state, the arm was holding white_block_2. So before putting a block on white_block_1, we must have held white_block_2. So perhaps we need to stack something on white_block_1 using white_block_2, but white_block_2 is initially on top of blue_block_2. So we need to unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2, then maybe stack it on white_block_1.

Constraint 5: At least one state must have blue_block_3 on top of white_block_2. So we need to stack blue_block_3 onto white_block_2.

Constraint 6: At least one state where either white_block_1 is on blue_block_3 or blue_block_2 is clear. Initially, blue_block_2 has white_block_2 on it, so not clear. If we remove white_block_2, then blue_block_2 becomes clear. Alternatively, stacking white_block_1 on blue_block_3.

Constraint 7: At least one state where either brown_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_3 is on brown_block_1. Since brown_block_1 starts on the table, to satisfy this, we could either move it off the table or stack blue_block_3 on it.

Constraint 8: At least one state where brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2. But initially, brown_block_1 is on the table, so this is already true. Wait, but the constraint says "must hold in at least one state". Since in the initial state, brown_block_1 is not on blue_block_2, this is already satisfied. So no action needed for this constraint. However, constraint 9 says that if in some state s, brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2 (which is always true except if we put it there), then in s or after, there's a block on brown_block_1. But since initially, brown_block_1 is clear and on the table, and the constraint 9 is triggered by the state where brown_block_1 is not on blue_block_2 (which is always true unless we stack brown on blue_block_2), then we need to ensure that after any such state (which includes all states unless we stack brown on blue_block_2), brown_block_1 must have a block on top at some point. Wait, but if we never stack brown_block_1 on blue_block_2, then constraint 8 is always true, so constraint 9 applies to all states. So in every state s where brown_block_1 is not on blue_block_2 (which is all states unless we stack it there), then in s or later, brown_block_1 must have a block on top. But brown_block_1 starts on the table and clear. So we need to stack something on brown_block_1 at some point to satisfy this. Otherwise, all states would violate constraint 9. So this is important. So we need to put a block on top of brown_block_1 at some point.

Constraint 10: At least one state where either brown_block_1 is not clear or it's on top of white_block_1. So either stack something on brown_block_1 or put brown_block_1 on white_block_1.

Now, putting all these constraints together.

Let me list all constraints and their implications:

1. white_block_1 must be off the table at some point. Since the goal is to hold it, this is achieved when we pick it up, which is the last action. So during the plan, after pickup, it's not on the table. So this constraint is satisfied.

But we need to check if the constraint requires it to be off the table at some state, which would be after the pickup. So that's covered.

2. Whenever white_block_1 is not on the table (which is after pickup), then in that state or later, blue_block_3 must be on white_block_2 or on the table. But blue_block_3 starts on black_block_1. So to satisfy this, after white_block_1 is picked up (which is the last action), we need to have blue_block_3 either on white_block_2 or on the table. So perhaps before picking up white_block_1, we need to move blue_block_3 to either the table or white_block_2.

3. At some state, white_block_1 has a block on top. So we need to stack something on it. But since the goal is to hold white_block_1, after stacking something on it, we need to unstack it again. So perhaps:

- stack some block on white_block_1, then unstack it to hold white_block_1.

But this would require:

- pick up a block (say X), stack it on white_block_1, then unstack X from white_block_1, then put X down, then pickup white_block_1. But that's more steps. Alternatively, stack X on white_block_1, then unstack X to hold X, then put X down, then pickup white_block_1. But maybe there's a smarter way.

But constraint 4 says that if white_block_1 is not clear (i.e., has a block on top) in some state, then in an earlier state, the arm was holding white_block_2. So the block on top of white_block_1 must have been placed there by stacking using white_block_2. Wait, no. The constraint says that if white_block_1 is not clear in a state, then in an earlier state, the arm was holding white_block_2. So the action that caused a block to be placed on white_block_1 must have been preceded by holding white_block_2. So perhaps we need to use white_block_2 as the block that is placed on white_block_1. But white_block_2 is initially on blue_block_2. So we need to unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2, then stack it on white_block_1. Then, later, unstack it to get white_block_1.

But let's see. If we stack white_block_2 onto white_block_1, then white_block_1 is not clear. But to do that, we need to unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2 first. Then stack it on white_block_1. Then, to get white_block_1, we need to unstack white_block_2 from it. So the steps would be:

1. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2 (arm holds white_block_2)
2. stack white_block_2 white_block_1 (now white_block_1 has white_block_2 on top, satisfying constraint 3)
3. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1 (arm holds white_block_2 again)
4. putdown white_block_2 (so it's back on the table)
5. pickup white_block_1 (achieve goal)

But this would satisfy constraint 4 because when white_block_1 is not clear (step 2-3), the earlier state (step 1) had the arm holding white_block_2.

But also, this would require that blue_block_2 is clear after step 1, which it is, since white_block_2 was removed. So constraint 6 requires that in some state, either white_block_1 is on blue_block_3 or blue_block_2 is clear. After step 1, blue_block_2 is clear, so that satisfies the condition in constraint 6.

Now, constraint 5 requires that blue_block_3 is on white_block_2 in some state. So we need to stack blue_block_3 onto white_block_2. But currently, blue_block_3 is on black_block_1. So steps to do that:

- unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
- stack blue_block_3 white_block_2

But when would we do that? Let's see.

Also, constraint 2: after white_block_1 is not on the table (which is after step 5's pickup), we need blue_block_3 to be on white_block_2 or on the table. So if in step 5, after pickup white_block_1, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2 or on the table. So if we stack blue_block_3 onto white_block_2 earlier, that would satisfy it.

So let's insert those steps:

After step 2 (stack white_block_2 on white_block_1), but then we need to handle blue_block_3.

Wait, but maybe before step 5 (pickup white_block_1), we need to have blue_block_3 on white_block_2 or on the table. Let's see.

Alternatively, after we unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1 (step 3), we can put it down (step 4), then work on moving blue_block_3.

So perhaps:

1. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
2. stack white_block_2 white_block_1 (now white_block_1 has a block on top)
3. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1 (arm holds white_block_2)
4. putdown white_block_2
5. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
6. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2 (now blue_block_3 is on white_block_2, satisfying constraint 5)
7. pickup white_block_1 (goal achieved)

But after step 7, white_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 1 is satisfied). Then, constraint 2 requires that in this state (after step 7) or later, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2 or on the table. In step 6, we stacked blue_block_3 on white_block_2, so in step 7, it's still there. So constraint 2 is satisfied.

Now, constraint 7: at least one state where brown_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_3 is on brown_block_1. Since brown_block_1 is initially on the table. To satisfy this, we need to either move brown_block_1 off the table (stack it somewhere) or stack blue_block_3 on brown_block_1. But in the current steps, we stacked blue_block_3 on white_block_2. So that doesn't help. So perhaps we need to stack blue_block_3 on brown_block_1 instead of white_block_2. But that would conflict with constraint 5 which requires blue_block_3 on white_block_2. So we need to do both? But that's impossible unless we move blue_block_3 multiple times.

Wait, constraint 5 requires that blue_block_3 is on white_block_2 in at least one state. So as long as that happens once, it's okay. So maybe stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2, then move it somewhere else. But then we need to have at least one state where it's on white_block_2. So in the plan above, step 6 does that. So constraint 5 is satisfied.

But constraint 7 requires that in some state, either brown_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_3 is on brown_block_1. If we leave brown_block_1 on the table, then blue_block_3 needs to be on brown_block_1 in some state. But in the current plan, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2. So to satisfy constraint 7, we need to either move brown_block_1 off the table (e.g., stack it somewhere) or stack blue_block_3 on brown_block_1.

But how? Let's see. Maybe after stacking blue_block_3 on white_block_2 (step 6), we can unstack it and stack it on brown_block_1. But that would take extra steps. Alternatively, perhaps stack blue_block_3 on brown_block_1 instead of white_block_2. But then constraint 5 (blue_block_3 on white_block_2) is not satisfied. So perhaps we need to do both? Let me think.

Alternatively, we can stack brown_block_1 on some other block to get it off the table. For example, stack brown_block_1 on blue_block_1. But then we need to pick up brown_block_1. But initially, it's clear. So:

pickup brown_block_1, stack it on some block. But that would require additional steps.

Alternatively, during the plan, stack something on brown_block_1. For example, stack white_block_2 on brown_block_1. But that would require picking up white_block_2 again.

Wait, let's see. Let's consider constraint 9: if brown_block_1 is not on blue_block_2 (which is always true unless we stack it there), then in that state or after, there's a block on top of brown_block_1. Since we never stack brown_block_1 on blue_block_2, this constraint requires that in every state s (since s always satisfies brown not on blue_block_2), there must be a state after s where brown_block_1 has a block on top. But that's impossible unless we stack something on brown_block_1 at some point. So we need to stack a block on brown_block_1 in the plan. So let's add that.

So, steps after step 6 (stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2):

7. pickup brown_block_1 (since it's on the table and clear)
8. stack brown_block_1 some_block. But which block? Maybe stack it on blue_block_3. Wait, no, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2. Or stack it on another block. But to minimize steps, maybe stack it on blue_block_3. But blue_block_3 is on white_block_2. So stack brown_block_1 on blue_block_3. But blue_block_3 is clear after step 6 (since we stacked it on white_block_2). Wait, no. When you stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 is no longer clear. Blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2, so white_block_2 is not clear, but blue_block_3 is clear. So to stack brown_block_1 on blue_block_3, we need blue_block_3 to be clear. Which it is. So:

7. unstack blue_block_3 white_block_2 (but we need to hold it)
Wait, no. After step 6 (stack blue_block_3 white_block_2), blue_block_3 is on white_block_2, and blue_block_3 is clear. So to stack brown_block_1 on blue_block_3:

7. pickup brown_block_1
8. stack brown_block_1 blue_block_3

This would make brown_block_1 on top of blue_block_3, which is on white_block_2. Then, blue_block_3 is not clear anymore. But this would satisfy constraint 7: in step 8, brown_block_1 is not on the table (since it's stacked on blue_block_3). Also, constraint 9: after any state where brown_block_1 is not on blue_block_2 (all states), we have to have a state where brown_block_1 has a block on top. But in step 8, we stack brown_block_1 on blue_block_3, which means brown_block_1 is clear (since nothing is on top of it). Wait, no. Stacking brown_block_1 on blue_block_3 would mean brown_block_1 is on blue_block_3, and brown_block_1 is clear. So brown_block_1 is not on the table (satisfies constraint 7's first condition), but there's no block on top of it. So constraint 9 requires that after step 8, there must be a state where brown_block_1 has a block on top. Hmm, this complicates things. Because stacking brown_block_1 on blue_block_3 doesn't put anything on top of brown_block_1. So we need another step to stack something on brown_block_1.

Alternatively, maybe stack something else on brown_block_1. Let's see. Maybe after stacking brown_block_1 on blue_block_3, we need to stack another block on top of brown_block_1. But that would take more steps. Alternatively, maybe stack blue_block_3 on brown_block_1 instead. Let's see.

Alternative approach: instead of stacking blue_block_3 on white_block_2 (step 6), stack it on brown_block_1. Then, constraint 5 (blue_block_3 on white_block_2) isn't satisfied. So we need to do both? That's complicated.

Alternatively, let's find another way to satisfy constraint 7. If we stack brown_block_1 on some block, then it's not on the table. So for constraint 7, that's sufficient. So for example, after step 6 (stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2), we can stack brown_block_1 on another block, like blue_block_1. But that requires:

7. pickup brown_block_1
8. stack brown_block_1 blue_block_1

Now, brown_block_1 is not on the table, satisfying constraint 7. Also, constraint 10: at least one state where brown_block_1 is not clear or on white_block_1. If we stack it on blue_block_1, then it's not clear (since it's on blue_block_1, which is on the table). Wait, no. Stacking brown_block_1 on blue_block_1 would make blue_block_1 have brown_block_1 on top, so blue_block_1 is not clear. Brown_block_1 is clear. So constraint 10 is not satisfied here. So we need to have either brown_block_1 not clear (something on top) or on white_block_1.

Alternatively, stack something on brown_block_1. For example, after stacking brown_block_1 on blue_block_1, we could stack another block on brown_block_1. But that requires more steps.

Alternatively, stack brown_block_1 on white_block_1. But that would require white_block_1 to be clear. Initially, white_block_1 is clear, but after step 2 (stack white_block_2 on white_block_1), it's not. Then after step 3 (unstack white_block_2), white_block_1 is clear again. So maybe after step 4 (putdown white_block_2), we can stack brown_block_1 on white_block_1. But then:

After step 4 (putdown white_block_2):

5. pickup brown_block_1
6. stack brown_block_1 white_block_1

But then white_block_1 is not clear, satisfying constraint 3. Then, to get white_block_1, we need to unstack brown_block_1 from it. But that would require:

7. unstack brown_block_1 white_block_1
8. putdown brown_block_1
9. pickup white_block_1

This would add steps. Also, this way, constraint 10 is satisfied because brown_block_1 is on white_block_1 in step 6. Also, constraint 7 is satisfied because brown_block_1 is not on the table (stacked on white_block_1). But then, we need to handle blue_block_3 to satisfy constraint 2 and 5.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's try to outline a possible plan that satisfies all constraints:

1. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2. Now holding white_block_2.
2. Stack white_block_2 on white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is not clear (constraint 3 satisfied). Also, constraint 4 is satisfied because we held white_block_2 before.
3. Unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1. Now holding white_block_2.
4. Putdown white_block_2. Now it's on the table.
5. Unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1. Now holding blue_block_3.
6. Stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2. Now blue_block_3 is on white_block_2 (constraint 5 satisfied).
7. Pickup brown_block_1. Now holding brown_block_1.
8. Stack brown_block_1 on blue_block_3. Now brown_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 7 satisfied). Also, blue_block_3 is under brown_block_1, so it's not clear. Brown_block_1 is clear. But constraint 9 requires that after any state where brown_block_1 is not on blue_block_2 (all states), there must be a block on top of brown_block_1. So after step 8, brown_block_1 is clear, which violates constraint 9. So we need to stack something on brown_block_1.

9. Unstack blue_block_3 from white_block_2. Wait, no, blue_block_3 is under brown_block_1. Wait, in step 6, blue_block_3 is stacked on white_block_2. Then in step 8, brown_block_1 is stacked on blue_block_3. So blue_block_3 is now under brown_block_1 and on white_block_2. To stack something on brown_block_1, we need to pick up a block and stack it. Let's use blue_block_1.

10. Pickup blue_block_1. Now holding blue_block_1.
11. Stack blue_block_1 on brown_block_1. Now brown_block_1 has a block on top (satisfies constraint 9). Also, constraint 10 is satisfied because brown_block_1 is not clear (has blue_block_1 on top).

Then, finally, we need to pickup white_block_1. But white_block_1 is clear again after step 3 (unstacked white_block_2). So:

12. Pickup white_block_1. Goal achieved.

But now, let's check all constraints:

- Constraint 1: white_block_1 is not on the table in step 12. Satisfied.

- Constraint 2: after step 12, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2 (from step 6) but in step 8, we stacked brown_block_1 on blue_block_3, so blue_block_3 is still on white_block_2. So in step 12, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2. Satisfied.

- Constraint 3: step 2 has white_block_1 not clear. Satisfied.

- Constraint 4: step 2's state requires that earlier (step 1) the arm held white_block_2. Satisfied.

- Constraint 5: step 6 has blue_block_3 on white_block_2. Satisfied.

- Constraint 6: need at least one state where white_block_1 is on blue_block_3 or blue_block_2 is clear. Blue_block_2 is clear after step 1. So step 1 onwards, blue_block_2 is clear. Satisfied.

- Constraint 7: step 8 has brown_block_1 not on the table. Satisfied.

- Constraint 8: always true, since brown_block_1 is never on blue_block_2.

- Constraint 9: after step 8 (brown_block_1 not on blue_block_2), in step 11, brown_block_1 has a block on top. Satisfied.

- Constraint 10: step 8 has brown_block_1 on blue_block_3 (so not clear), but step 11 has brown_block_1 with blue_block_1 on top (so not clear). Also, step 8 and 11 both satisfy the condition. So satisfied.

But this plan has 12 steps. Is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, can we find a shorter path by combining some steps?

Let me think. Maybe instead of stacking brown_block_1 on blue_block_3 and then stacking blue_block_1 on brown_block_1, we can stack another block on brown_block_1 earlier. For example, after step 6 (stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2), then pickup blue_block_1 and stack it on brown_block_1. But then:

7. Pickup blue_block_1 (since it's on the table and clear)
8. Stack blue_block_1 on brown_block_1 (now brown_block_1 has blue_block_1 on top, so not clear. This satisfies constraint 9 and 10. Also, brown_block_1 is not on the table (no, because brown_block_1 is still on the table with blue_block_1 on top. Wait, no. Stacking blue_block_1 on brown_block_1 would require that brown_block_1 is clear and on the table. So after stacking, brown_block_1 is on the table with blue_block_1 on top. So brown_block_1 is still on the table. So constraint 7 isn't satisfied. So this approach doesn't work.

Hmm, so stacking blue_block_1 on brown_block_1 would not take brown_block_1 off the table, so constraint 7 (brown_block_1 not on table) isn't satisfied. So we need to move brown_block_1 off the table. So step 7 and 8: pickup brown_block_1 and stack it somewhere. For example, stack it on blue_block_1.

7. Pickup brown_block_1
8. Stack brown_block_1 blue_block_1 (now brown_block_1 is on blue_block_1, which is on the table. So brown_block_1 is not on the table. Satisfies constraint 7. Then, to satisfy constraint 9, we need to stack something on brown_block_1. So:

9. Pickup some block, say black_block_1 (which is on the table and clear)
10. Stack black_block_1 brown_block_1 (now brown_block_1 has black_block_1 on top, satisfying constraint 9)

But this adds more steps. But this way, constraint 10 is also satisfied because brown_block_1 is not clear (has black_block_1 on top). So constraint 10 is satisfied.

But this is getting very long. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, can we stack blue_block_3 on brown_block_1 to satisfy both constraint 5 and 7?

Wait, constraint 5 requires blue_block_3 on white_block_2. So we can't avoid that. So we have to stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2. Then, to satisfy constraint 7, we need to stack brown_block_1 off the table or stack blue_block_3 on brown_block_1. But blue_block_3 is already on white_block_2. So we need to move brown_block_1 off the table. So steps:

After step 6 (blue_block_3 on white_block_2):

7. Pickup brown_block_1
8. Stack brown_block_1 on some block. Let's say blue_block_1. Now brown_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 7 satisfied). But then we need to stack something on brown_block_1 to satisfy constraint 9.

9. Pickup black_block_1 (since it's on the table and clear)
10. Stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1. Now brown_block_1 is not clear (satisfies constraint 9). Also, constraint 10: brown_block_1 is not clear (satisfies the first condition).

Then, finally:

11. Pickup white_block_1. 

But this plan has 11 steps, which is still long. Is there a way to minimize steps?

Alternatively, maybe stack brown_block_1 on white_block_1. Let's see:

After step 4 (putdown white_block_2):

5. Unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1
6. Stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2 (constraint 5)
7. Pickup brown_block_1
8. Stack brown_block_1 on white_block_1 (now white_block_1 has brown_block_1 on top, so not clear (constraint 3). Also, brown_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 7). Then, to get white_block_1, we need to unstack brown_block_1:

9. Unstack brown_block_1 white_block_1
10. Putdown brown_block_1
11. Pickup white_block_1 (goal)

Now, constraint 9 requires that after any state where brown_block_1 is not on blue_block_2 (which is all states), there must be a state where brown_block_1 has a block on top. But in this plan, after step 8, brown_block_1 is on white_block_1 and clear. Then, step 9 unstacking it. So in step 8, brown_block_1 is clear. So we need to stack something on brown_block_1 after that. For example, after step 8:

9. Pickup some block (like black_block_1)
10. Stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1
11. Unstack black_block_1 brown_block_1
12. Putdown black_block_1
13. Unstack brown_block_1 white_block_1
14. Putdown brown_block_1
15. Pickup white_block_1

This is getting too long. Maybe this approach isn't optimal.

Alternative idea: Use the same block to satisfy multiple constraints. For example, stacking blue_block_3 on white_block_2 satisfies constraint 5. Also, moving blue_block_3 from black_block_1 to white_block_2 makes blue_block_3 on white_block_2, which helps with constraint 2. Then, moving brown_block_1 off the table by stacking it on blue_block_3. This way:

After step 6 (stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2):

7. Pickup brown_block_1
8. Stack brown_block_1 on blue_block_3 (now brown_block_1 is not on the table, satisfying constraint 7. Also, blue_block_3 is under brown_block_1. Now, brown_block_1 is clear. To satisfy constraint 9, we need to stack something on brown_block_1.

9. Pickup black_block_1
10. Stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1 (now brown_block_1 has a block on top)
11. Unstack black_block_1 brown_block_1
12. Putdown black_block_1
13. Unstack brown_block_1 blue_block_3
14. Putdown brown_block_1
15. Pickup white_block_1

But this is even longer. 

Maybe there's a way to optimize by not having to move blocks back and forth. Let's try to see if there's a shorter path.

Alternative plan:

1. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2.
2. Stack white_block_2 on white_block_1. (satisfies constraint 3 and 4)
3. Unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1.
4. Stack white_block_2 on brown_block_1. (Now brown_block_1 is not clear, satisfying constraint 9. Also, white_block_2 is not on the table, but not sure.)
5. Unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1.
6. Stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2. (satisfies constraint 5. Now, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2, which is on brown_block_1. So white_block_2 is on brown_block_1, which is on the table. Then, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2, which is not clear. Also, brown_block_1 has white_block_2 on top, so not clear. Satisfies constraint 9.
7. Pickup white_block_1. (Goal)

But let's check constraints:

Constraint 1: white_block_1 is not on the table after step 7. Yes.

Constraint 2: after step 7, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2. Yes.

Constraint 3: step 2 has white_block_1 not clear. Yes.

Constraint 4: step 2 required holding white_block_2 earlier (step 1). Yes.

Constraint 5: step 6 has blue_block_3 on white_block_2. Yes.

Constraint 6: blue_block_2 is clear after step 1. Yes.

Constraint 7: brown_block_1 is on the table, but white_block_2 is on it. Wait, in step 4, white_block_2 is stacked on brown_block_1. So brown_block_1 is on the table with white_block_2 on top. So brown_block_1 is still on the table. So constraint 7 is not satisfied. Because brown_block_1 is still on the table. So we need to have either brown_block_1 not on the table or blue_block_3 on brown_block_1. So this approach doesn't work for constraint 7.

So step 4 must move brown_block_1 off the table. But stacking white_block_2 on brown_block_1 leaves brown_block_1 on the table. So we need to stack brown_block_1 somewhere else. For example:

After step 3 (holding white_block_2), stack it on blue_block_3 (but blue_block_3 is on black_block_1 initially). So:

1. Unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2.
2. Stack white_block_2 white_block_1.
3. Unstack white_block_2 white_block_1.
4. Unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1.
5. Stack blue_block_3 white_block_2. (now blue_block_3 is on white_block_2)
6. Stack white_block_2 blue_block_3. (now white_block_2 is on blue_block_3, which is on white_block_2? No, this is impossible. Can't stack white_block_2 on blue_block_3 if blue_block_3 is on white_block_2. This creates a loop.

This is getting too complicated. Let's try to outline a plan that covers all constraints with the minimal steps.

Alternative approach:

- Satisfy constraint 3 by stacking white_block_2 on white_block_1.
- Satisfy constraint 5 by stacking blue_block_3 on white_block_2.
- Satisfy constraint 7 by moving brown_block_1 off the table, perhaps stacking it on blue_block_3.
- Satisfy constraint 9 by stacking something on brown_block_1 after moving it.

Steps:

1. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2. (arm holds white_block_2)
2. Stack white_block_2 on white_block_1. (white_block_1 not clear)
3. Unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1. (arm holds white_block_2)
4. Putdown white_block_2. (back on table)
5. Unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1. (arm holds blue_block_3)
6. Stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2. (satisfies constraint 5)
7. Pickup brown_block_1. (arm holds brown_block_1)
8. Stack brown_block_1 on blue_block_3. (brown_block_1 not on table, satisfies constraint 7)
9. Pickup black_block_1. (arm holds black_block_1)
10. Stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1. (satisfies constraint 9 and 10)
11. Pickup white_block_1. (goal)

But let's check:

Constraint 1: step 11, white_block_1 is picked up, so not on table. Yes.

Constraint 2: after step 11, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2 (step 6). Yes.

Constraint 3: step 2. Yes.

Constraint 4: step 2 required step 1. Yes.

Constraint 5: step 6. Yes.

Constraint 6: blue_block_2 is clear after step 1. Yes.

Constraint 7: step 8. Yes.

Constraint 8: always true. Yes.

Constraint 9: after step 8, in step 10, brown_block_1 has black_block_1 on top. Yes.

Constraint 10: step 10, brown_block_1 not clear. Yes.

This plan has 11 steps. Can we shorten it?

For example, after step 8 (stack brown_block_1 on blue_block_3), can we stack something on brown_block_1 without picking up another block? But to stack something on brown_block_1, we need to hold a block. We are holding nothing after step 8. So we need to pick up another block. Like black_block_1.

Alternatively, after step 8, pickup blue_block_1 and stack it on brown_block_1.

But this would be steps 9 and 10:

9. Pickup blue_block_1
10. Stack blue_block_1 on brown_block_1

Then step 11: pickup white_block_1.

But this also requires 11 steps.

Is there a way to combine steps? For example, after stacking blue_block_3 on white_block_2 (step 6), can we use brown_block_1 to satisfy multiple constraints?

Alternatively, after step 6 (blue_block_3 on white_block_2), pick up brown_block_1 and stack it on blue_block_3 (step 7-8), then pickup black_block_1 and stack it on brown_block_1 (steps 9-10). Then pickup white_block_1 (step 11). Total 11 steps.

Is this the minimal possible? Maybe.

Alternatively, find a way to have brown_block_1 stacked on a block that's already being moved. For example, stack brown_block_1 on white_block_1 after step 3.

But let's see:

1. Unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
2. Stack white_block_2 white_block_1 (constraint 3)
3. Unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
4. Putdown white_block_2
5. Unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
6. Stack blue_block_3 white_block_2 (constraint 5)
7. Pickup brown_block_1
8. Stack brown_block_1 white_block_1 (now white_block_1 has brown_block_1 on top, which is not clear. But to pickup white_block_1 later, we need to unstack brown_block_1 first.
9. Unstack brown_block_1 white_block_1
10. Putdown brown_block_1
11. Pickup white_block_1 (goal)

But this plan has 11 steps again and doesn't satisfy constraint 7 (brown_block_1 is on the table again after step 10). Also, constraint 9 requires that after any state where brown_block_1 is not on blue_block_2 (all states), there must be a state where brown_block_1 has a block on top. In step 8, brown_block_1 is stacked on white_block_1, so it's not on the table (satisfies constraint 7). But in step 9, we unstack it, making it on the table again. So during step 8, brown_block_1 is not on the table, satisfying constraint 7. But constraint 9 requires that after step 8 (when brown_block_1 is not on blue_block_2), there must be a state where brown_block_1 has a block on top. However, after step 8, brown_block_1 is on white_block_1 and is clear. Then in step 9, we unstack it and put it down. So there's no state after step 8 where brown_block_1 has a block on top. So constraint 9 is violated.

Thus, this approach doesn't work.

After going through various possibilities, the shortest valid plan seems to have 11 steps. However, perhaps I'm missing a more optimal path.

Wait, let's think again. What's the minimal number of steps required to satisfy all constraints?

The goal is to hold white_block_1. To do that, we need to pick it up. The constraints require that:

- white_block_1 must be stacked at some point (to satisfy constraint 3), then unstacked to pick it up.

- During the stacking of white_block_1, we must have held white_block_2 before (constraint 4).

- blue_block_3 must be stacked on white_block_2 (constraint 5).

- brown_block_1 must be moved off the table (constraint 7) and have a block stacked on it (constraint 9 and 10).

So steps required:

1. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2.
2. Stack white_block_2 on white_block_1.
3. Unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1.
4. Putdown white_block_2.
5. Unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1.
6. Stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2.
7. Pickup brown_block_1.
8. Stack brown_block_1 on some block (e.g., blue_block_3).
9. Pickup another block (e.g., black_block_1).
10. Stack that block on brown_block_1.
11. Pickup white_block_1.

But this is 11 steps. Is there a way to combine steps 7-10 into fewer actions?

For example, after step 6 (blue_block_3 on white_block_2), can we pickup brown_block_1 and stack it directly on another block that already has a block on top, so that we don't need to stack another block on it?

Wait, constraint 9 requires that after any state where brown_block_1 is not on blue_block_2 (which is all states), there must be a state where brown_block_1 has a block on top. So even if we stack brown_block_1 on blue_block_3 (step 8), which is on white_block_2, then brown_block_1 is clear. So we need to stack something on it. So steps 9 and 10 are necessary.

Alternatively, if we stack brown_block_1 on blue_block_1 and then stack blue_block_1 on something else, but that doesn't help.

Alternatively, stack brown_block_1 on white_block_2 (after step 6):

7. Pickup brown_block_1.
8. Stack brown_block_1 on white_block_2 (which already has blue_block_3). Wait, but white_block_2 is clear after step 6 (blue_block_3 is on it). To stack brown_block_1 on white_block_2, we need white_block_2 to be clear. But after step 6, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2, so white_block_2 is not clear. So can't stack brown_block_1 on white_block_2.

Hmm. This seems unavoidable. Thus, the minimal plan likely has 11 steps. However, let's check if any steps can be optimized.

Wait, perhaps after step 6 (stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2), we can stack brown_block_1 on blue_block_3, and then stack another block on brown_block_1 using a different block.

But that would require:

7. Pickup brown_block_1.
8. Stack brown_block_1 on blue_block_3.
9. Pickup black_block_1.
10. Stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1.
11. Pickup white_block_1.

This is 11 steps. Alternatively, is there a way to use a block already in hand?

No, because after step 8, the arm is empty.

Alternatively, can we stack brown_block_1 on blue_block_3 and then use another block already in hand to stack on it? But after step 8, we're not holding anything.

So this seems unavoidable.

Thus, the plan is:

```
1. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
2. stack white_block_2 white_block_1
3. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
4. putdown white_block_2
5. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
6. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2
7. pickup brown_block_1
8. stack brown_block_1 blue_block_3
9. pickup black_block_1
10. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1
11. pickup white_block_1
```

But wait, step 8 is stacking brown_block_1 on blue_block_3, which is on white_block_2. So blue_block_3 is not clear after step 6. Wait, after step 6, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2 and clear. Then step 7: pickup brown_block_1, which is on the table. Step 8: stack brown_block_1 on blue_block_3, which is possible because blue_block_3 is clear. After stacking, brown_block_1 is clear, and blue_block_3 is not. Then step 9: pickup black_block_1, which is on the table and clear. Stack it on brown_block_1. Now, brown_block_1 has black_block_1 on top, satisfying constraint 9.

This plan has 11 steps. However, the user requests an optimal plan with minimal length. Is there a way to reduce this?

Let me think. What if instead of using black_block_1, we use blue_block_1 to stack on brown_block_1. So after step 8:

9. pickup blue_block_1
10. stack blue_block_1 brown_block_1
11. pickup white_block_1

Same number of steps.

Alternatively, can we stack brown_block_1 on white_block_1 after step 3?

Let's try:

1. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
2. stack white_block_2 white_block_1
3. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
4. stack white_block_2 brown_block_1 (now brown_block_1 has white_block_2 on top, so not on the table. Wait, no. Stacking white_block_2 on brown_block_1 requires that brown_block_1 is clear and on the table. So after step 4, brown_block_1 is on the table with white_block_2 on top. So brown_block_1 is still on the table. Doesn't satisfy constraint 7. So this doesn't help.

Alternative idea: Instead of moving brown_block_1, can we stack blue_block_3 on brown_block_1 to satisfy constraint 7 (blue_block_3 on brown_block_1), which satisfies constraint 7's second option. So:

Steps:

1. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
2. stack white_block_2 white_block_1
3. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
4. putdown white_block_2
5. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
6. stack blue_block_3 brown_block_1 (now blue_block_3 is on brown_block_1, which is on the table. This satisfies constraint 7 because blue_block_3 is on brown_block_1, and brown_block_1 is on the table. So "blue_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1" holds, satisfying the second condition of constraint 7.

Then, constraint 5 requires blue_block_3 on white_block_2. So this approach doesn't satisfy constraint 5. Thus, we need to find a way to have blue_block_3 on white_block_2 and also on brown_block_1, which is impossible unless we move it twice. But that would increase steps.

Thus, this approach won't work.

After exploring various possibilities, it seems that the minimal plan requires 11 steps. However, maybe there's a different order of steps that can save steps. For example, after stacking white_block_2 on white_block_1 (step 2), then unstacking it (step 3), then using white_block_2 to stack on brown_block_1 to move it off the table. But again, this would require additional steps.

Alternatively, after step 6 (stacking blue_block_3 on white_block_2), stack brown_block_1 on blue_block_3 (step 7-8), then stack blue_block_1 on brown_block_1 (steps 9-10), then pickup white_block_1 (step 11). This is 11 steps.

Another idea: Can we use the same block to satisfy multiple constraints? For example, stacking blue_block_3 on white_block_2 satisfies constraint 5 and helps with constraint 2.

After step 6, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2. Then, constraint 2 is satisfied because after white_block_1 is picked up (step 11), blue_block_3 is on white_block_2. Also, constraint 5 is satisfied.

For constraint 7, we can stack brown_block_1 on blue_block_3 (step 7-8), making brown_block_1 not on the table. Then stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1 (steps 9-10) to satisfy constraint 9 and 10.

Thus, the plan is as outlined before.

Given that all constraints are satisfied in this 11-step plan, and I can't find a shorter one, this must be the optimal plan.
