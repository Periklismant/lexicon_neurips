**Explanation:**  
1. **unstack green_block_1 yellow_block_1**: Clear yellow_block_1 to later meet the constraint requiring it to be clear when stacking on purple_block_2.
2. **stack green_block_1 black_block_2**: Prepare for stacking purple_block_1 on green_block_1 (constraint 4).
3. **pickup purple_block_1**: To satisfy the constraint of holding purple_block_1 (constraint 9).
4. **stack purple_block_1 green_block_1**: Fulfills constraint 4 (purple on green, green on black_block_2).
5. **unstack purple_block_2 red_block_1**: Remove purple_block_2 from red_block_1 (constraint 10).
6. **putdown purple_block_2**: Place it on the table (constraint 2). Earlier, red_block_1 is moved to green_block_1 in step 7, satisfying constraint 3.
7. **unstack red_block_1 black_block_1**: Prepare to move red_block_1 to green_block_1.
8. **stack red_block_1 green_block_1**: Ensures red is on green before purple_block_2 is put down (constraint 3).
9. **pickup purple_block_2**: To stack it on purple_block_1 (constraint 7).
10. **stack purple_block_2 purple_block_1**: Makes purple_block_2 not clear (constraint 7) and satisfies dependency on yellow_block_1 being clear earlier (step 1).
11. **unstack red_block_1 green_block_1**: Retrieve red_block_1 to place on yellow_block_1.
12. **stack red_block_1 yellow_block_1**: Achieves the goal. Yellow_block_1 was moved off the table temporarily (step 1), satisfying constraint 1.
