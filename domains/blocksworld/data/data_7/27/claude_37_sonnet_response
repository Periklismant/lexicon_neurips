Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, I need to understand the initial state of the world:
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- purple_block_1 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- purple_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- black_block_2 is on the table
- green_block_1, purple_block_1, purple_block_2, and black_block_2 are clear
- I am not holding any block

The goal is to have red_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1.

Now, let's look at the constraints:

1. yellow_block_1 must not be on the table at some point.
2. purple_block_2 must be on the table at some point.
3. If purple_block_2 is on the table, then there must have been an earlier state where red_block_1 was on top of green_block_1.
4. At some point, purple_block_1 must be on top of green_block_1, which is on top of black_block_2.
5. At some point, black_block_1 must not be on top of black_block_2.
6. If black_block_1 is not on top of black_block_2, then at that state or some state after, either black_block_1 is not on the table or red_block_1 is on the table.
7. At some point, purple_block_2 must not be clear (some block on top of it).
8. If purple_block_2 is not clear, then there must have been an earlier state where yellow_block_1 was clear.
9. At some point, we must be holding purple_block_1.
10. At some point, purple_block_2 must not be on top of red_block_1.
11. If purple_block_2 is not on top of red_block_1, then there must have been an earlier state where either purple_block_1 was not clear or I was holding green_block_1.

Let's think about this:

- To achieve the goal, I need to move red_block_1 from black_block_1 to yellow_block_1. But before I can do that, I need to make both red_block_1 and yellow_block_1 clear.
- Currently, purple_block_2 is on top of red_block_1, so I need to remove it. But according to constraint 11, before I can do that, either purple_block_1 has to be not clear or I have to be holding green_block_1.
- green_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, so I need to remove it to make yellow_block_1 clear. But according to constraint 8, yellow_block_1 has to be clear before purple_block_2 can be not clear. This suggests I might need to put something on top of purple_block_2 (making it not clear) after making yellow_block_1 clear.
- According to constraint 3, before putting purple_block_2 on the table, red_block_1 has to be on top of green_block_1 at some earlier state.
- Constraint 4 says we need a state where purple_block_1 is on top of green_block_1, which is on top of black_block_2. This suggests a possible tower: purple_block_1 on green_block_1 on black_block_2.
- Constraint 9 says we need to be holding purple_block_1 at some point.

Given these constraints, here's a rough plan:

1. First, I'll need to satisfy constraint 11: Either make purple_block_1 not clear or hold green_block_1. I'll choose to make purple_block_1 not clear by stacking a block on it.
2. Then, I'll remove purple_block_2 from red_block_1 to make red_block_1 clear.
3. I'll also need to make yellow_block_1 clear by removing green_block_1.
4. According to constraint 3, before putting purple_block_2 on the table, I need to place red_block_1 on top of green_block_1.
5. At some point, I need to create a tower with purple_block_1 on top of green_block_1 on top of black_block_2 (constraint 4).
6. At some point, I need to hold purple_block_1 (constraint 9).
7. And finally, I need to place red_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1 (the goal).

Let's try to put together a plan that satisfies all these constraints. I'll need to be careful about the order of operations to ensure all constraints are met.

Actually, this is quite challenging, given the number of constraints. Let me start with a simple plan to achieve the goal and then adjust to meet the constraints.

The basic plan to achieve the goal would be:
1. Unstack purple_block_2 from red_block_1
2. Unstack red_block_1 from black_block_1
3. Unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1
4. Stack red_block_1 on yellow_block_1

But this doesn't satisfy any of our constraints. Let's adjust:

To satisfy constraint 11 (before removing purple_block_2 from red_block_1, either purple_block_1 should not be clear or we should be holding green_block_1), let's first put something on purple_block_1.

1. Unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1
2. Stack green_block_1 on purple_block_1 (Now purple_block_1 is not clear)
3. Unstack purple_block_2 from red_block_1 (Satisfying constraint 11 because purple_block_1 is not clear)
4. Putdown purple_block_2 (Satisfying constraint 2: purple_block_2 is on the table)

But this doesn't satisfy constraint 3, which says that before purple_block_2 is on the table, red_block_1 should have been on top of green_block_1 at some earlier state.

Let's adjust again:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1
2. Putdown green_block_1
3. Unstack purple_block_2 from red_block_1
4. Putdown purple_block_2
5. Unstack red_block_1 from black_block_1
6. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1 (Satisfying constraint for 3)
7. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1
8. Stack red_block_1 on yellow_block_1 (Achieving the goal)

But this still doesn't satisfy all constraints. For instance, we need to satisfy constraint 4, which requires a state where purple_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 on top of black_block_2.

Let's try a different approach, focusing on satisfying the constraints one by one.

Constraint 11 says that before purple_block_2 is not on top of red_block_1, there must be an earlier state where either purple_block_1 was not clear or I was holding green_block_1. Given the initial state, where purple_block_1 is clear, it seems like I'll need to hold green_block_1 first.

Initial state:
```
  green_block_1    red_block_1   purple_block_1  black_block_2
yellow_block_1  -  black_block_1 - table        - table
                  \
                   purple_block_2
```

1. Unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (Now holding green_block_1, satisfying the "holding green_block_1" part of constraint 11)
2. Stack green_block_1 on black_block_2 (Building towards satisfying constraint 4)
3. Pickup purple_block_1 (Satisfying constraint 9, which requires holding purple_block_1)
4. Stack purple_block_1 on green_block_1 (Satisfying constraint 4, creating the tower purple_block_1 on green_block_1 on black_block_2)
5. Unstack purple_block_2 from red_block_1 (Satisfying constraint 10, where purple_block_2 is not on top of red_block_1)
6. Putdown purple_block_2 (Satisfying constraint 2, where purple_block_2 is on the table)
7. Unstack red_block_1 from black_block_1 (Preparing to satisfy constraint 3 and move towards the goal)
8. Stack red_block_1 on purple_block_2 (This makes purple_block_2 not clear, satisfying constraint 7)
9. Unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_2
10. Pickup yellow_block_1 (Satisfying constraint 1, where yellow_block_1 is not on the table)
11. Putdown yellow_block_1
12. Stack red_block_1 on yellow_block_1 (Achieving the goal)

Wait, there's something wrong with this plan. I'm trying to satisfy constraint 3 which states that before purple_block_2 is on the table, red_block_1 should have been on top of green_block_1. But in our plan, we're placing purple_block_2 on the table before having red_block_1 on top of green_block_1.

Let me revise the plan:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (Now holding green_block_1, satisfying the "holding green_block_1" part of constraint 11)
2. Stack green_block_1 on black_block_2 (Building towards satisfying constraint 4)
3. Pickup purple_block_1 (Satisfying constraint 9, which requires holding purple_block_1)
4. Stack purple_block_1 on green_block_1 (Satisfying constraint 4, creating the tower purple_block_1 on green_block_1 on black_block_2)
5. Unstack purple_block_2 from red_block_1 (Satisfying constraint 10, where purple_block_2 is not on top of red_block_1)
6. Stack purple_block_2 on purple_block_1 (This moves purple_block_2 from its initial position, but not to the table yet)
7. Unstack red_block_1 from black_block_1 (Preparing to satisfy constraint 3 before moving purple_block_2 to the table)
8. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1 (Ensuring that red_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 before purple_block_2 is on the table, as required by constraint 3)
9. Unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1
10. Putdown purple_block_2 (Now purple_block_2 is on the table, satisfying constraint 2, and because red_block_1 was on top of green_block_1 earlier, constraint 3 is satisfied)
11. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1
12. Pickup yellow_block_1 (Satisfying constraint 1, where yellow_block_1 is not on the table)
13. Putdown yellow_block_1
14. Stack red_block_1 on yellow_block_1 (Achieving the goal)

Hmm, there's still a problem. In this revised plan, when we want to stack red_block_1 on green_block_1 (step 8), green_block_1 is not clear because purple_block_1 is on top of it. And when we want to put purple_block_2 on the table (step 10), we've already moved it to purple_block_1 (step 6), so we'd need to unstack it from there.

Let's fix the plan:

Wait, there's another issue I missed. Constraint 8 says that before purple_block_2 is not clear (i.e., has a block on top of it), yellow_block_1 must have been clear in an earlier state. In our plan, we're trying to place red_block_1 on purple_block_2 (step 8 of the earlier plan), but we need to ensure that yellow_block_1 is clear before that.

Let me revise the plan again, paying more attention to all the constraints:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (Now holding green_block_1 and yellow_block_1 is clear, satisfying the condition for constraint 8, and also satisfying the "holding green_block_1" part of constraint 11)
2. Stack green_block_1 on black_block_2 (Building towards satisfying constraint 4)
3. Pickup purple_block_1 (Satisfying constraint 9, which requires holding purple_block_1)
4. Stack purple_block_1 on green_block_1 (Satisfying constraint 4, creating the tower purple_block_1 on green_block_1 on black_block_2)
5. Unstack purple_block_2 from red_block_1 (Satisfying constraint 10, where purple_block_2 is not on top of red_block_1. This is valid because we previously satisfied the condition in constraint 11 by holding green_block_1)
6. Stack purple_block_2 on black_block_1 (Repositioning purple_block_2 to free up red_block_1. This doesn't contradict any constraints)
7. Unstack red_block_1 from black_block_1 (Freeing up red_block_1)
8. Stack red_block_1 on purple_block_2 (Making purple_block_2 not clear, satisfying constraint 7. This is valid because yellow_block_1 was clear earlier, as required by constraint 8)
9. Unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_2 (Preparing to move red_block_1 to green_block_1, as required by constraint 3)
10. Stack red_block_1 on purple_block_1 (Repositioning red_block_1)
11. Unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1
12. Unstack purple_block_1 from green_block_1 (Making green_block_1 clear)
13. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1 (Ensuring that red_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 before purple_block_2 is on the table, as required by constraint 3)
14. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1
15. Putdown purple_block_2 (Now purple_block_2 is on the table, satisfying constraint 2, and because red_block_1 was on top of green_block_1 earlier, constraint 3 is satisfied)
16. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1
17. Pickup yellow_block_1 (Satisfying constraint 1, where yellow_block_1 is not on the table)
18. Putdown yellow_block_1
19. Stack red_block_1 on yellow_block_1 (Achieving the goal)

Wait, there's another constraint I missed. Constraint 5 requires that at some point, black_block_1 must not be on top of black_block_2. But in our initial state, black_block_1 is already on the table, not on top of black_block_2, so this constraint is already satisfied.

Constraint 6 says that if black_block_1 is not on top of black_block_2 (which is the case in the initial state), then at that state or a later state, either black_block_1 should not be on the table or red_block_1 should be on the table. In our plan, we do move red_block_1 at some point, but we also need to ensure that either black_block_1 is not on the table or red_block_1 is on the table in a state after the initial state.

Let's adjust the plan again:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (Now holding green_block_1 and yellow_block_1 is clear, satisfying the condition for constraint 8, and also satisfying the "holding green_block_1" part of constraint 11)
2. Stack green_block_1 on black_block_2 (Building towards satisfying constraint 4)
3. Pickup purple_block_1 (Satisfying constraint 9, which requires holding purple_block_1)
4. Stack purple_block_1 on green_block_1 (Satisfying constraint 4, creating the tower purple_block_1 on green_block_1 on black_block_2)
5. Unstack purple_block_2 from red_block_1 (Satisfying constraint 10, where purple_block_2 is not on top of red_block_1. This is valid because we previously satisfied the condition in constraint 11 by holding green_block_1)
6. Stack purple_block_2 on black_block_1 (Repositioning purple_block_2 to free up red_block_1. This doesn't contradict any constraints)
7. Unstack red_block_1 from black_block_1 (Freeing up red_block_1)
8. Putdown red_block_1 (Now red_block_1 is on the table, satisfying the second part of constraint 6)
9. Pickup black_block_1 (Freeing up black_block_1 to potentially place it elsewhere)
10. Stack black_block_1 on purple_block_1 (Repositioning black_block_1. Note that black_block_1 is now not on the table, satisfying the first part of constraint 6)
11. Unstack black_block_1 from purple_block_1
12. Putdown black_block_1 (Returning black_block_1 to the table)
13. Pickup red_block_1 (Preparing to position red_block_1 on green_block_1, as required by constraint 3)
14. Stack red_block_1 on purple_block_2 (Making purple_block_2 not clear, satisfying constraint 7. This is valid because yellow_block_1 was clear earlier, as required by constraint 8)
15. Unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_2 (Preparing to move red_block_1 to green_block_1, as required by constraint 3)
16. Stack red_block_1 on purple_block_1 (Repositioning red_block_1)
17. Unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1
18. Unstack purple_block_1 from green_block_1 (Making green_block_1 clear)
19. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1 (Ensuring that red_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 before purple_block_2 is on the table, as required by constraint 3)
20. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1
21. Putdown purple_block_2 (Now purple_block_2 is on the table, satisfying constraint 2, and because red_block_1 was on top of green_block_1 earlier, constraint 3 is satisfied)
22. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1
23. Pickup yellow_block_1 (Satisfying constraint 1, where yellow_block_1 is not on the table)
24. Putdown yellow_block_1
25. Stack red_block_1 on yellow_block_1 (Achieving the goal)

Let me double-check this plan against the constraints:

1. yellow_block_1 must not be on the table at some point. (Satisfied in step 23-24)
2. purple_block_2 must be on the table at some point. (Satisfied in step 21)
3. If purple_block_2 is on the table, then there must have been an earlier state where red_block_1 was on top of green_block_1. (Satisfied in step 19-21)
4. At some point, purple_block_1 must be on top of green_block_1, which is on top of black_block_2. (Satisfied in step 4)
5. At some point, black_block_1 must not be on top of black_block_2. (Satisfied in the initial state and throughout)
6. If black_block_1 is not on top of black_block_2, then at that state or some state after, either black_block_1 is not on the table or red_block_1 is on the table. (Satisfied in steps 8-13)
7. At some point, purple_block_2 must not be clear (some block on top of it). (Satisfied in step 14)
8. If purple_block_2 is not clear, then there must have been an earlier state where yellow_block_1 was clear. (Satisfied in step 1 and 14)
9. At some point, we must be holding purple_block_1. (Satisfied in step 3)
10. At some point, purple_block_2 must not be on top of red_block_1. (Satisfied in step 5 onwards)
11. If purple_block_2 is not on top of red_block_1, then there must have been an earlier state where either purple_block_1 was not clear or I was holding green_block_1. (Satisfied in step 1 and 5)

I think this plan satisfies all the constraints. Let's also check the preconditions of each action to ensure the plan is valid:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1: green_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, green_block_1 is clear, and I'm not holding any block. (Valid)
2. Stack green_block_1 on black_block_2: I'm holding green_block_1, and black_block_2 is clear. (Valid)
3. Pickup purple_block_1: purple_block_1 is on the table, purple_block_1 is clear, and I'm not holding any block. (Valid)
4. Stack purple_block_1 on green_block_1: I'm holding purple_block_1, and green_block_1 is clear. (Valid)
5. Unstack purple_block_2 from red_block_1: purple_block_2 is on top of red_block_1, purple_block_2 is clear, and I'm not holding any block. (Valid)
6. Stack purple_block_2 on black_block_1: I'm holding purple_block_2, and black_block_1 is clear. (Valid)
7. Unstack red_block_1 from black_block_1: red_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, red_block_1 is clear, and I'm not holding any block. (Valid)
8. Putdown red_block_1: I'm holding red_block_1. (Valid)
9. Pickup black_block_1: black_block_1 is on the table, black_block_1 is clear, and I'm not holding any block. (Valid)
10. Stack black_block_1 on purple_block_1: I'm holding black_block_1, and purple_block_1 is clear. (Valid)
11. Unstack black_block_1 from purple_block_1: black_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1, black_block_1 is clear, and I'm not holding any block. (Valid)
12. Putdown black_block_1: I'm holding black_block_1. (Valid)
13. Pickup red_block_1: red_block_1 is on the table, red_block_1 is clear, and I'm not holding any block. (Valid)
14. Stack red_block_1 on purple_block_2: I'm holding red_block_1, and purple_block_2 is clear. (Valid)
15. Unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_2: red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2, red_block_1 is clear, and I'm not holding any block. (Valid)
16. Stack red_block_1 on purple_block_1: I'm holding red_block_1, and purple_block_1 is clear. (Valid)
17. Unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1: red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1, red_block_1 is clear, and I'm not holding any block. (Valid)
18. Unstack purple_block_1 from green_block_1: purple_block_1 is on top of green_block_1, purple_block_1 is clear, and I'm not holding any block. (Valid)
19. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1: I'm holding red_block_1, and green_block_1 is clear. (Valid)
20. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1: purple_block_2 is on top of black_block_1, purple_block_2 is clear, and I'm not holding any block. (Valid)
21. Putdown purple_block_2: I'm holding purple_block_2. (Valid)
22. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1: red_block_1 is on top of green_block_1, red_block_1 is clear, and I'm not holding any block. (Valid)
23. Pickup yellow_block_1: yellow_block_1 is on the table, yellow_block_1 is clear, and I'm not holding any block. (Valid)
24. Putdown yellow_block_1: I'm holding yellow_block_1. (Valid)
25. Stack red_block_1 on yellow_block_1: I'm holding red_block_1, and yellow_block_1 is clear. (Valid)

Wait, there's a sequencing issue. I need to make sure red_block_1 is on green_block_1 before purple_block_2 is on the table, but I'm also trying to make sure purple_block_2 is not clear before that. These constraints seem to be in conflict.

Actually, I think I was being overly cautious. Let's re-examine constraint 7 and 8:

7. At some point, purple_block_2 must not be clear (some block on top of it).
8. If purple_block_2 is not clear, then there must have been an earlier state where yellow_block_1 was clear.

This doesn't mean that we need to make purple_block_2 not clear before placing it on the table or before having red_block_1 on green_block_1. It just means that at some point in our plan, purple_block_2 should have a block on top of it, and before that, yellow_block_1 should have been clear.

Let's revise the plan:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (Now holding green_block_1 and yellow_block_1 is clear, satisfying the condition for constraint 8, and also satisfying the "holding green_block_1" part of constraint 11)
2. Stack green_block_1 on black_block_2 (Building towards satisfying constraint 4)
3. Pickup purple_block_1 (Satisfying constraint 9, which requires holding purple_block_1)
4. Stack purple_block_1 on green_block_1 (Satisfying constraint 4, creating the tower purple_block_1 on green_block_1 on black_block_2)
5. Unstack purple_block_2 from red_block_1 (Satisfying constraint 10, where purple_block_2 is not on top of red_block_1. This is valid because we previously satisfied the condition in constraint 11 by holding green_block_1)
6. Putdown purple_block_2 (Now purple_block_2 is on the table, satisfying constraint 2)
7. Unstack red_block_1 from black_block_1 (Preparing to satisfy constraint 3)
8. Pickup black_block_1 (This is to satisfy constraint 6)
9. Putdown black_block_1 (Ensuring black_block_1 is not on the table at some point, which, combined with the initial state, satisfies constraint 5 and 6)
10. Pickup red_block_1 (Freeing up red_block_1)
11. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1 (Ensuring red_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 before purple_block_2 is on the table. Wait, this doesn't seem right as I've already put purple_block_2 on the table in step 6. Let's reconsider this.)

Okay, I'm still not following the constraint correctly. Constraint 3 says: "If expression 'purple_block_2 is on the table' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'red_block_1 is on top of green_block_1'."

So I need to ensure red_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 before putting purple_block_2 on the table.

Let's revise the plan again:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (Now holding green_block_1 and yellow_block_1 is clear, satisfying the condition for constraint 8, and also satisfying the "holding green_block_1" part of constraint 11)
2. Stack green_block_1 on black_block_2 (Building towards satisfying constraint 4)
3. Pickup purple_block_1 (Satisfying constraint 9, which requires holding purple_block_1)
4. Stack purple_block_1 on green_block_1 (Satisfying constraint 4, creating the tower purple_block_1 on green_block_1 on black_block_2)
5. Unstack purple_block_2 from red_block_1 (Satisfying constraint 10, where purple_block_2 is not on top of red_block_1. This is valid because we previously satisfied the condition in constraint 11 by holding green_block_1)
6. Stack purple_block_2 on black_block_1 (Repositioning purple_block_2, but not on the table yet)
7. Unstack red_block_1 from black_block_1 (Freeing up red_block_1)
8. Pickup yellow_block_1 (Satisfying constraint 1, where yellow_block_1 is not on the table)
9. Putdown yellow_block_1 (Returning yellow_block_1 to the table)
10. Unstack purple_block_1 from green_block_1 (Preparing to put red_block_1 on green_block_1)
11. Putdown purple_block_1 (Temporarily placing purple_block_1 on the table)
12. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1 (Ensuring red_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 before purple_block_2 is on the table, as required by constraint 3)
13. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1 (Preparing to use red_block_1 for other constraints)
14. Pickup black_block_1 (Freeing up black_block_1 to satisfy constraint 6)
15. Stack black_block_1 on purple_block_1 (Placing black_block_1 on purple_block_1, ensuring it's not on the table, which, combined with the initial state, satisfies constraint 5 and 6)
16. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1 (Preparing to place purple_block_2 on the table)
17. Putdown purple_block_2 (Now purple_block_2 is on the table, satisfying constraint 2, and because red_block_1 was on top of green_block_1 earlier, constraint 3 is also satisfied)
18. Stack red_block_1 on purple_block_2 (Making purple_block_2 not clear, satisfying constraint 7. This is valid because yellow_block_1 was clear earlier, as required by constraint 8)
19. Unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_2 (Preparing to achieve the goal)
20. Stack red_block_1 on yellow_block_1 (Achieving the goal)

I think this plan satisfies all the constraints. Let's do a final check:

1. yellow_block_1 must not be on the table at some point. (Satisfied in step 8)
2. purple_block_2 must be on the table at some point. (Satisfied in step 17)
3. If purple_block_2 is on the table, then there must have been an earlier state where red_block_1 was on top of green_block_1. (Satisfied in steps 12-17)
4. At some point, purple_block_1 must be on top of green_block_1, which is on top of black_block_2. (Satisfied in step 4)
5. At some point, black_block_1 must not be on top of black_block_2. (Satisfied in the initial state and throughout)
6. If black_block_1 is not on top of black_block_2, then at that state or some state after, either black_block_1 is not on the table or red_block_1 is on the table. (Satisfied in step 15)
7. At some point, purple_block_2 must not be clear (some block on top of it). (Satisfied in step 18)
8. If purple_block_2 is not clear, then there must have been an earlier state where yellow_block_1 was clear. (Satisfied in step 1 and 18)
9. At some point, we must be holding purple_block_1. (Satisfied in step 3)
10. At some point, purple_block_2 must not be on top of red_block_1. (Satisfied in step 5 onwards)
11. If purple_block_2 is not on top of red_block_1, then there must have been an earlier state where either purple_block_1 was not clear or I was holding green_block_1. (Satisfied in step 1 and 5)

This plan seems to satisfy all the constraints.

Before we finalize, I need to make sure purple_block_1 is clear before I can pickup black_block_1 in step 14. In the previous step, I unstacked red_block_1 from green_block_1, so I should be holding red_block_1. I need to putdown red_block_1 first.

Revising the plan:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (Now holding green_block_1 and yellow_block_1 is clear, satisfying the condition for constraint 8, and also satisfying the "holding green_block_1" part of constraint 11)
2. Stack green_block_1 on black_block_2 (Building towards satisfying constraint 4)
3. Pickup purple_block_1 (Satisfying constraint 9, which requires holding purple_block_1)
4. Stack purple_block_1 on green_block_1 (Satisfying constraint 4, creating the tower purple_block_1 on green_block_1 on black_block_2)
5. Unstack purple_block_2 from red_block_1 (Satisfying constraint 10, where purple_block_2 is not on top of red_block_1. This is valid because we previously satisfied the condition in constraint 11 by holding green_block_1)
6. Stack purple_block_2 on black_block_1 (Repositioning purple_block_2, but not on the table yet)
7. Unstack red_block_1 from black_block_1 (Freeing up red_block_1)
8. Pickup yellow_block_1 (Satisfying constraint 1, where yellow_block_1 is not on the table)
9. Putdown yellow_block_1 (Returning yellow_block_1 to the table)
10. Unstack purple_block_1 from green_block_1 (Preparing to put red_block_1 on green_block_1)
11. Putdown purple_block_1 (Temporarily placing purple_block_1 on the table)
12. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1 (Ensuring red_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 before purple_block_2 is on the table, as required by constraint 3)
13. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1 (Preparing to use red_block_1 for other constraints)
14. Putdown red_block_1 (Ensuring I'm not holding any block)
15. Pickup black_block_1 (Freeing up black_block_1 to satisfy constraint 6)
16. Stack black_block_1 on purple_block_1 (Placing black_block_1 on purple_block_1, ensuring it's not on the table, which, combined with the initial state, satisfies constraint 5 and 6)
17. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1 (Preparing to place purple_block_2 on the table)
18. Putdown purple_block_2 (Now purple_block_2 is on the table, satisfying constraint 2, and because red_block_1 was on top of green_block_1 earlier, constraint 3 is also satisfied)
19. Pickup red_block_1 (Preparing to make purple_block_2 not clear)
20. Stack red_block_1 on purple_block_2 (Making purple_block_2 not clear, satisfying constraint 7. This is valid because yellow_block_1 was clear earlier, as required by constraint 8)
21. Unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_2 (Preparing to achieve the goal)
22. Stack red_block_1 on yellow_block_1 (Achieving the goal)

I think the final plan is now ready:

```
1. Unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1
2. Stack green_block_1 on black_block_2
3. Pickup purple_block_1
4. Stack purple_block_1 on green_block_1
5. Unstack purple_block_2 from red_block_1
6. Stack purple_block_2 on black_block_1
7. Unstack red_block_1 from black_block_1
8. Pickup yellow_block_1
9. Putdown yellow_block_1
10. Unstack purple_block_1 from green_block_1
11. Putdown purple_block_1
12. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1
13. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1
14. Putdown red_block_1
15. Pickup black_block_1
16. Stack black_block_1 on purple_block_1
17. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1
18. Putdown purple_block_2
19. Pickup red_block_1
20. Stack red_block_1 on purple_block_2
21. Unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_2
22. Stack red_block_1 on yellow_block_1
```

This plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal of having red_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1.

Wait, let me actually test if red_block_1 is clear at step 7 because it's not in the initial state condition. In the initial state, purple_block_2 is on top of red_block_1. In step 5, I unstack purple_block_2 from red_block_1, which means red_block_1 is now clear. So step 7 is valid.

Similarly, yellow_block_1 is initially not clear because green_block_1 is on top of it. But in step 1, I unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1, which makes yellow_block_1 clear. So step 8 is valid.

In step 10, I unstack purple_block_1 from green_block_1, so green_block_1 is now clear. In step 12, I stack red_block_1 on green_block_1, which makes green_block_1 not clear. In step 13, I unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1, which makes green_block_1 clear again.

In step 15, I pickup black_block_1, and in step 16, I stack black_block_1 on purple_block_1, which makes purple_block_1 not clear.

In step 17, I unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1, which makes black_block_1 clear again.

And so on. I think the plan is valid and the preconditions of each action are satisfied.
