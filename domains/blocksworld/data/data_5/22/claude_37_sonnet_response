Let's break down the problem:

1. Initial state:
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1
- white_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1, grey_block_2, white_block_1, yellow_block_2, and blue_block_1 are clear
- You are not holding any block

2. Goal:
- blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2

3. Constraints:
a. The following expression must hold in at least one state: "The following conditions are all true: "you are holding grey_block_1", "blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1""
b. The following expression must hold in at least one state: "there is no block on top of grey_block_1, i.e., grey_block_1 is clear"
c. The following expression must hold in at least one state: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1", "there is no block on top of yellow_block_1, i.e., yellow_block_1 is clear""
d. The following expression must hold in at least one state: "The following conditions are all true: "yellow_block_1 is not on the table", "there is a block on top of black_block_1, i.e., black_block_1 is not clear""
e. The following expression must hold in at least one state: "blue_block_1 is not on the table"
f. If expression "blue_block_1 is not on the table" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "there is a block on top of yellow_block_2, i.e., yellow_block_2 is not clear"

Let me think about a strategy to solve this problem. I'll need to satisfy all the constraints and reach the goal state.

Let's start by analyzing the initial state:
- grey_block_1 has grey_block_2 on top of it, so it's not clear.
- yellow_block_1 has white_block_1 on top of it, so it's not clear.

Let's think about how to satisfy the constraints:

a. "You are holding grey_block_1" and "blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1": 
   - First, we need to have blue_block_1 on black_block_1
   - Then, we need to unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1
   - After that, we can pick up grey_block_1

b. "grey_block_1 is clear":
   - We need to remove grey_block_2 from grey_block_1

c. At least one of "grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" or "yellow_block_1 is clear":
   - Grey_block_1 is currently on the table and yellow_block_1 has white_block_1 on top, so neither is true.
   - Either we need to move grey_block_1 on top of white_block_1, or we need to remove white_block_1 from yellow_block_1.

d. "yellow_block_1 is not on the table" and "black_block_1 is not clear":
   - We need to move yellow_block_1 from the table to somewhere else.
   - We need to place a block on top of black_block_1.

e. "blue_block_1 is not on the table":
   - We need to move blue_block_1 from the table.

f. Before blue_block_1 is moved from the table, yellow_block_2 should have a block on top of it:
   - We need to place a block on yellow_block_2 before moving blue_block_1.

Looking at these constraints, I think we can come up with a plan. Let's execute it step by step:

1. First, I need to place a block on yellow_block_2 to satisfy constraint f. Then I can move blue_block_1.
2. I need to unstack grey_block_2 to make grey_block_1 clear (constraint b).
3. I need to unstack white_block_1 to make yellow_block_1 clear (part of constraint c).
4. I need to pick up grey_block_1 (part of constraint a).
5. I need to pick up blue_block_1 and place it on black_block_1 (constraint a).
6. I need to move yellow_block_1 from the table somewhere else (part of constraint d).
7. I need to place a block on top of black_block_1 (part of constraint d).
8. Finally, I need to place blue_block_1 on top of yellow_block_2 to achieve the goal.

Let me put together a plan:

1. unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1 (this makes grey_block_1 clear, satisfying constraint b)
2. put grey_block_2 on yellow_block_2 (this ensures yellow_block_2 has a block on it, which is required before blue_block_1 is moved from the table according to constraint f)
3. pickup blue_block_1 (blue_block_1 is now not on the table, satisfying constraint e)
4. stack blue_block_1 on black_block_1
5. unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (makes yellow_block_1 clear, satisfying part of constraint c)
6. stack white_block_1 on grey_block_1 (this wouldn't be necessary but it allows us to do the next step)
7. pickup yellow_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is now not on the table, part of constraint d)
8. stack yellow_block_1 on blue_block_1 (now black_block_1 is not clear, satisfying constraint d)
9. pickup grey_block_1 (now we are holding grey_block_1, and blue_block_1 is on black_block_1, satisfying constraint a)
10. putdown grey_block_1
11. unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1
12. putdown yellow_block_1
13. unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1
14. unstack grey_block_2 from yellow_block_2
15. putdown grey_block_2
16. stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_2 (goal achieved)

Let me check this plan for validity:

Step 1: unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1
Grey_block_2 is clear, and grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1, and I am not holding any block. This is valid.
After this, I am holding grey_block_2, grey_block_1 is clear.

Step 2: stack grey_block_2 on yellow_block_2
I am holding grey_block_2, and yellow_block_2 is clear. This is valid.
After this, I am not holding any block, grey_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_2, grey_block_2 is clear, and yellow_block_2 is not clear.

Step 3: pickup blue_block_1
Blue_block_1 is clear, blue_block_1 is on the table, and I am not holding any block. This is valid.
After this, I am holding blue_block_1, blue_block_1 is not on the table.

Step 4: stack blue_block_1 on black_block_1
I am holding blue_block_1, and black_block_1 is clear. This is valid.
After this, I am not holding any block, blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, blue_block_1 is clear, black_block_1 is not clear.

Step 5: unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1
White_block_1 is clear, white_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, and I am not holding any block. This is valid.
After this, I am holding white_block_1, yellow_block_1 is clear, white_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1.

Step 6: stack white_block_1 on grey_block_1
I am holding white_block_1, and grey_block_1 is clear. This is valid.
After this, I am not holding any block, white_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1, white_block_1 is clear, grey_block_1 is not clear.

Step 7: pickup yellow_block_1
Yellow_block_1 is clear, yellow_block_1 is on the table, and I am not holding any block. This is valid.
After this, I am holding yellow_block_1, yellow_block_1 is not on the table.

Step 8: stack yellow_block_1 on blue_block_1
I am holding yellow_block_1, and blue_block_1 is clear. This is valid.
After this, I am not holding any block, yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1, yellow_block_1 is clear, blue_block_1 is not clear.

Step 9: pickup grey_block_1
Wait, I can't do this. Grey_block_1 is not clear because white_block_1 is on it. I need to revise my plan.

Let me revise the plan:

1. unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1 (this makes grey_block_1 clear, satisfying constraint b)
2. put grey_block_2 on yellow_block_2 (this ensures yellow_block_2 has a block on it, which is required before blue_block_1 is moved from the table according to constraint f)
3. unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (makes yellow_block_1 clear, satisfying part of constraint c)
4. stack white_block_1 on black_block_1 (this makes black_block_1 not clear, part of constraint d)
5. pickup yellow_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is now not on the table, part of constraint d)
6. stack yellow_block_1 on white_block_1 (this still keeps black_block_1 not clear)
7. pickup blue_block_1 (blue_block_1 is now not on the table, satisfying constraint e)
8. stack blue_block_1 on black_block_1 (this doesn't satisfy constraint a yet, as I am not holding grey_block_1)
9. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
10. putdown yellow_block_1
11. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_1
12. putdown white_block_1
13. unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1
14. stack blue_block_1 on black_block_1 (now blue_block_1 is on black_block_1)
15. pickup grey_block_1 (now I am holding grey_block_1 and blue_block_1 is on black_block_1, satisfying constraint a)
16. putdown grey_block_1
17. unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1
18. unstack grey_block_2 from yellow_block_2
19. putdown grey_block_2
20. stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_2 (goal achieved)

Hmm, Step 14 doesn't seem right. Let me redo this plan.

Let's think about the constraints more carefully:

a. I need to hold grey_block_1 while blue_block_1 is on black_block_1.
b. Grey_block_1 must be clear at some point. (This is already true after we remove grey_block_2 from it.)
c. Either grey_block_1 must be on white_block_1, or yellow_block_1 must be clear.
d. Yellow_block_1 must not be on the table, and black_block_1 must not be clear.
e. Blue_block_1 must not be on the table.
f. Before blue_block_1 is moved from the table, yellow_block_2 must have a block on it.

Let me try a different approach:

1. unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1 (this makes grey_block_1 clear, satisfying constraint b)
2. stack grey_block_2 on yellow_block_2 (this ensures yellow_block_2 has a block on it, which is required before blue_block_1 is moved from the table according to constraint f)
3. pickup blue_block_1 (blue_block_1 is now not on the table, satisfying constraint e)
4. stack blue_block_1 on black_block_1 (this doesn't satisfy constraint a yet, as I am not holding grey_block_1)
5. unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (this makes yellow_block_1 clear, part of constraint c)
6. stack white_block_1 on blue_block_1 (this makes black_block_1 not clear, part of constraint d)
7. pickup yellow_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is now not on the table, part of constraint d)
8. stack yellow_block_1 on white_block_1 (at this point, black_block_1 is not clear and yellow_block_1 is not on the table, satisfying constraint d)
9. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
10. putdown yellow_block_1
11. unstack white_block_1 from blue_block_1
12. putdown white_block_1
13. pickup grey_block_1 (now I am holding grey_block_1 and blue_block_1 is on black_block_1, satisfying constraint a)
14. putdown grey_block_1
15. unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1
16. unstack grey_block_2 from yellow_block_2
17. putdown grey_block_2
18. stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_2 (goal achieved)

Let me check this plan for validity:

Step 1: unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1
Grey_block_2 is clear, and grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1, and I am not holding any block. This is valid.
After this, I am holding grey_block_2, grey_block_1 is clear.

Step 2: stack grey_block_2 on yellow_block_2
I am holding grey_block_2, and yellow_block_2 is clear. This is valid.
After this, I am not holding any block, grey_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_2, grey_block_2 is clear, and yellow_block_2 is not clear.

Step 3: pickup blue_block_1
Blue_block_1 is clear, blue_block_1 is on the table, and I am not holding any block. This is valid.
After this, I am holding blue_block_1, blue_block_1 is not on the table.

Step 4: stack blue_block_1 on black_block_1
I am holding blue_block_1, and black_block_1 is clear. This is valid.
After this, I am not holding any block, blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, blue_block_1 is clear, black_block_1 is not clear.

Step 5: unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1
White_block_1 is clear, white_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, and I am not holding any block. This is valid.
After this, I am holding white_block_1, yellow_block_1 is clear, white_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1.

Step 6: stack white_block_1 on blue_block_1
I am holding white_block_1, and blue_block_1 is clear. This is valid.
After this, I am not holding any block, white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1, white_block_1 is clear, blue_block_1 is not clear.

Step 7: pickup yellow_block_1
Yellow_block_1 is clear, yellow_block_1 is on the table, and I am not holding any block. This is valid.
After this, I am holding yellow_block_1, yellow_block_1 is not on the table.

Step 8: stack yellow_block_1 on white_block_1
I am holding yellow_block_1, and white_block_1 is clear. This is valid.
After this, I am not holding any block, yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, yellow_block_1 is clear, white_block_1 is not clear.

So far, our plan is valid and we have satisfied constraints b, c, d, e, and f. Now we need to satisfy constraint a (holding grey_block_1 while blue_block_1 is on black_block_1).

Step 9: unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
Yellow_block_1 is clear, and yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, and I am not holding any block. This is valid.
After this, I am holding yellow_block_1, yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, white_block_1 is clear.

Step 10: putdown yellow_block_1
I am holding yellow_block_1. This is valid.
After this, yellow_block_1, yellow_block_1 is on the table, yellow_block_1 is clear, I am not holding any block.

Step 11: unstack white_block_1 from blue_block_1
White_block_1 is clear, and white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1, and I am not holding any block. This is valid.
After this, I am holding white_block_1, white_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1, blue_block_1 is clear.

Step 12: putdown white_block_1
I am holding white_block_1. This is valid.
After this, white_block_1 is on the table, white_block_1 is clear, I am not holding any block.

Step 13: pickup grey_block_1
Grey_block_1 is on the table, grey_block_1 is clear, and I am not holding any block. This is valid.
After this, I am holding grey_block_1, grey_block_1 is not on the table.

At this point, I am holding grey_block_1 and blue_block_1 is on black_block_1. This satisfies constraint a.

Step 14: putdown grey_block_1
I am holding grey_block_1. This is valid.
After this, grey_block_1 is on the table, grey_block_1 is clear, I am not holding any block.

Step 15: unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1
Blue_block_1 is clear, and blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, and I am not holding any block. This is valid.
After this, I am holding blue_block_1, blue_block_1 is not on top of black_block_1, black_block_1 is clear.

Step 16: unstack grey_block_2 from yellow_block_2
Grey_block_2 is clear, and grey_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_2, and I am not holding any block. Wait, I'm holding blue_block_1. This step is not valid.

Let me revise the plan:

1. unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1 (this makes grey_block_1 clear, satisfying constraint b)
2. stack grey_block_2 on yellow_block_2 (this ensures yellow_block_2 has a block on it, which is required before blue_block_1 is moved from the table according to constraint f)
3. pickup blue_block_1 (blue_block_1 is now not on the table, satisfying constraint e)
4. stack blue_block_1 on black_block_1
5. unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (this makes yellow_block_1 clear, part of constraint c)
6. stack white_block_1 on blue_block_1 (this makes black_block_1 not clear, part of constraint d)
7. pickup yellow_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is now not on the table, part of constraint d)
8. stack yellow_block_1 on white_block_1 (black_block_1 is not clear and yellow_block_1 is not on the table, satisfying constraint d)
9. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
10. putdown yellow_block_1
11. unstack white_block_1 from blue_block_1
12. putdown white_block_1
13. pickup grey_block_1 (now I am holding grey_block_1 and blue_block_1 is on black_block_1, satisfying constraint a)
14. putdown grey_block_1
15. unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1
16. stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_2 (goal achieved)

Let me check the validity of the last steps:

Step 15: unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1
Blue_block_1 is clear (because white_block_1 has been removed), and blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, and I am not holding any block. This is valid.
After this, I am holding blue_block_1, blue_block_1 is not on top of black_block_1, black_block_1 is clear.

Step 16: stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_2
I am holding blue_block_1, and ... wait, yellow_block_2 is not clear. Grey_block_2 is on top of it. This step is not valid.

I need to revise again:

1. unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1 (this makes grey_block_1 clear, satisfying constraint b)
2. stack grey_block_2 on yellow_block_2 (this ensures yellow_block_2 has a block on it, which is required before blue_block_1 is moved from the table according to constraint f)
3. pickup blue_block_1 (blue_block_1 is now not on the table, satisfying constraint e)
4. stack blue_block_1 on black_block_1
5. unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (this makes yellow_block_1 clear, part of constraint c)
6. stack white_block_1 on blue_block_1 (this makes black_block_1 not clear, part of constraint d)
7. pickup yellow_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is now not on the table, part of constraint d)
8. stack yellow_block_1 on white_block_1 (black_block_1 is not clear and yellow_block_1 is not on the table, satisfying constraint d)
9. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
10. putdown yellow_block_1
11. unstack white_block_1 from blue_block_1
12. putdown white_block_1
13. pickup grey_block_1 (now I am holding grey_block_1 and blue_block_1 is on black_block_1, satisfying constraint a)
14. putdown grey_block_1
15. unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1
16. unstack grey_block_2 from yellow_block_2
17. putdown grey_block_2
18. stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_2 (goal achieved)

Wait, I still have the issue with Step 16. After Step 15, I'm holding blue_block_1. I can't do "unstack grey_block_2" if I'm already holding a block.

Let me revise once more:

1. unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1 (this makes grey_block_1 clear, satisfying constraint b)
2. stack grey_block_2 on yellow_block_2 (this ensures yellow_block_2 has a block on it, which is required before blue_block_1 is moved from the table according to constraint f)
3. pickup blue_block_1 (blue_block_1 is now not on the table, satisfying constraint e)
4. stack blue_block_1 on black_block_1
5. unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (this makes yellow_block_1 clear, part of constraint c)
6. stack white_block_1 on blue_block_1 (this makes black_block_1 not clear, part of constraint d)
7. pickup yellow_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is now not on the table, part of constraint d)
8. stack yellow_block_1 on white_block_1 (black_block_1 is not clear and yellow_block_1 is not on the table, satisfying constraint d)
9. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
10. putdown yellow_block_1
11. unstack white_block_1 from blue_block_1
12. putdown white_block_1
13. pickup grey_block_1 (now I am holding grey_block_1 and blue_block_1 is on black_block_1, satisfying constraint a)
14. putdown grey_block_1
15. unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1
16. putdown blue_block_1
17. unstack grey_block_2 from yellow_block_2
18. putdown grey_block_2
19. pickup blue_block_1
20. stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_2 (goal achieved)

Let me check if this plan is valid:

Step 16: putdown blue_block_1
I am holding blue_block_1. This is valid.
After this, blue_block_1 is on the table, blue_block_1 is clear, I am not holding any block.

Step 17: unstack grey_block_2 from yellow_block_2
Grey_block_2 is clear, and grey_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_2, and I am not holding any block. This is valid.
After this, I am holding grey_block_2, grey_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_2, yellow_block_2 is clear.

Step 18: putdown grey_block_2
I am holding grey_block_2. This is valid.
After this, grey_block_2 is on the table, grey_block_2 is clear, I am not holding any block.

Step 19: pickup blue_block_1
Blue_block_1 is clear, blue_block_1 is on the table, and I am not holding any block. This is valid.
After this, I am holding blue_block_1, blue_block_1 is not on the table.

Step 20: stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_2
I am holding blue_block_1, and yellow_block_2 is clear. This is valid.
After this, I am not holding any block, blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2, blue_block_1 is clear, yellow_block_2 is not clear.

The goal is achieved: blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2.

Let me check if all constraints are satisfied:

a. "You are holding grey_block_1" and "blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1": This is satisfied in step 13.
b. "Grey_block_1 is clear": This is satisfied in step 1 and remains so for several steps.
c. "Grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" or "yellow_block_1 is clear": The second part is satisfied in step 5 and remains so for several steps.
d. "Yellow_block_1 is not on the table" and "black_block_1 is not clear": Both are satisfied in step 8.
e. "Blue_block_1 is not on the table": This is satisfied in step A and remains so for several steps.
f. Before blue_block_1 is moved from the table, yellow_block_2 must have a block on it: This is ensured by steps 2 and 3.

All constraints are satisfied, and the goal is achieved. The plan is valid.

Let's review the plan once more to check for optimizations:

1. unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1 (this makes grey_block_1 clear, satisfying constraint b)
2. stack grey_block_2 on yellow_block_2 (this ensures yellow_block_2 has a block on it, which is required before blue_block_1 is moved from the table according to constraint f)
3. pickup blue_block_1 (blue_block_1 is now not on the table, satisfying constraint e)
4. stack blue_block_1 on black_block_1
5. unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (this makes yellow_block_1 clear, part of constraint c)
6. stack white_block_1 on blue_block_1 (this makes black_block_1 not clear, part of constraint d)
7. pickup yellow_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is now not on the table, part of constraint d)
8. stack yellow_block_1 on white_block_1 (black_block_1 is not clear and yellow_block_1 is not on the table, satisfying constraint d)
9. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
10. putdown yellow_block_1
11. unstack white_block_1 from blue_block_1
12. putdown white_block_1
13. pickup grey_block_1 (now I am holding grey_block_1 and blue_block_1 is on black_block_1, satisfying constraint a)
14. putdown grey_block_1
15. unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1
16. putdown blue_block_1
17. unstack grey_block_2 from yellow_block_2
18. putdown grey_block_2
19. pickup blue_block_1
20. stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_2 (goal achieved)

Let me see if I can optimize this plan further. In particular, do I really need to put blue_block_1 down and then pick it up again? Maybe I can directly place it on yellow_block_2 after I unstacked it from black_block_1. But first I need to unstack grey_block_2 from yellow_block_2 to make it clear.

But I can't do that while holding blue_block_1. So the plan as it is seems optimal.

Hmm, let's see if there are any other optimizations we can make:

1. We need to make grey_block_1 clear, which means unstacking grey_block_2 from it.
2. We need to put a block on yellow_block_2 before moving blue_block_1.
3. We need to have blue_block_1 on black_block_1 and hold grey_block_1 at the same time.
4. We need to remove white_block_1 from yellow_block_1 to make it clear.
5. We need to have yellow_block_1 not on the table and black_block_1 not clear.
6. We need to place blue_block_1 on yellow_block_2.

I think the plan is already optimal given these constraints. Let's finalize it:

1. unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1
2. stack grey_block_2 on yellow_block_2
3. pickup blue_block_1
4. stack blue_block_1 on black_block_1
5. unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1
6. stack white_block_1 on blue_block_1
7. pickup yellow_block_1
8. stack yellow_block_1 on white_block_1
9. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
10. putdown yellow_block_1
11. unstack white_block_1 from blue_block_1
12. putdown white_block_1

15. unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1
16. putdown blue_block_1
17. unstack grey_block_2 from yellow_block_2
18. putdown grey_block_2

20. stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_2

This plan seems valid and optimal given the constraints.

One final thing: I might not actually need steps 13 and 14 (picking up grey_block_1 and then putting it down), let me check.

Wait, I need to satisfy constraint a which requires that "you are holding grey_block_1" and "blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" in at least one state. Steps 13 and 14 ensure this.

I think the plan is now valid and optimal.

Final plan:
1. unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1
2. stack grey_block_2 on yellow_block_2
3. pickup blue_block_1
4. stack blue_block_1 on black_block_1
5. unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1
6. stack white_block_1 on blue_block_1
7. pickup yellow_block_1
8. stack yellow_block_1 on white_block_1
9. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
10. putdown yellow_block_1
11. unstack white_block_1 from blue_block_1
