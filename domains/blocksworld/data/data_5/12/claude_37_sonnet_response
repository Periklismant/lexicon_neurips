I'll solve this blocksworld planning problem step-by-step.

First, let me summarize the initial state:
- red_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- orange_block_2 is on the table
- brown_block_1, blue_block_1, orange_block_1, and orange_block_2 are clear
- The arm is not holding any block

The goal is:
- white_block_1 is clear

The constraints are:
1. At some point, orange_block_2 should not be clear (i.e., have a block on top of it)
2. At some point, orange_block_1 should not be on the table
3. At some point, we need to hold red_block_1 while orange_block_2 has a block on top of it
4. At some point, brown_block_1 should not be on the table
5. If brown_block_1 is not on the table, then at that state or a later state, we need to hold orange_block_1
6. At some point, grey_block_1 should be on top of white_block_1 and red_block_1 should be clear

Let's think about the goal first: white_block_1 is clear.

Currently, white_block_1 has blue_block_1 on top of it, so we need to remove blue_block_1 from white_block_1.

Now, let's think about the constraints:

1. We need to have a block on top of orange_block_2 at some point.
2. We need to move orange_block_1 off the table at some point.
3. We need to hold red_block_1 while orange_block_2 has a block on top of it.
4. brown_block_1 should not be on the table at some point.
5. After brown_block_1 is off the table, we need to hold orange_block_1.
6. We need grey_block_1 on top of white_block_1 and red_block_1 clear.

Let's try to formulate a plan:

1. First, we need to move brown_block_1 from the top of grey_block_1.
2. Then, we can move grey_block_1 from the top of red_block_1.
3. Now, red_block_1 is clear, but we need grey_block_1 on top of white_block_1, which has blue_block_1 on top.
4. So, we need to move blue_block_1 first.
5. Then, we can place grey_block_1 on top of white_block_1.
6. To satisfy constraint 3, we need to hold red_block_1 while orange_block_2 has a block on top of it.
7. To satisfy constraint 2, we need to move orange_block_1 off the table.
8. To satisfy constraint 4, we need to move brown_block_1 off the table.
9. To satisfy constraint 5, after brown_block_1 is off the table, we need to hold orange_block_1.

Let's design a plan:

We start with:
- red_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- orange_block_2 is on the table
- brown_block_1, blue_block_1, orange_block_1, and orange_block_2 are clear
- The arm is not holding any block

1. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
   - Now we're holding brown_block_1, and grey_block_1 is clear.
   - This also satisfies part of constraint 4 (brown_block_1 is not on the table).

2. stack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
   - This satisfies constraint 1 (orange_block_2 is not clear).
   - Now brown_block_1 is on orange_block_2, and we're not holding any block.

3. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1
   - Now we're holding grey_block_1, and red_block_1 is clear.

4. stack grey_block_1 orange_block_1
   - This satisfies constraint 2 (orange_block_1 is not on the table).
   - Now grey_block_1 is on orange_block_1, and we're not holding any block.

5. pickup red_block_1
   - Now we're holding red_block_1, and there's a block on top of orange_block_2 (brown_block_1).
   - This satisfies constraint 3 (we're holding red_block_1 while orange_block_2 is not clear).

6. putdown red_block_1
   - red_block_1 is back on the table, and we're not holding any block.

7. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
   - Now we're holding blue_block_1, and white_block_1 is clear.

8. stack blue_block_1 red_block_1
   - Now blue_block_1 is on top of red_block_1, and we're not holding any block.

9. unstack grey_block_1 orange_block_1
   - Now we're holding grey_block_1, and orange_block_1 is clear.

10. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1
    - This satisfies part of constraint 6 (grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1).
    - Now grey_block_1 is on white_block_1, and we're not holding any block.

11. unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1
    - Now we're holding blue_block_1, and red_block_1 is clear.
    - This satisfies the remaining part of constraint 6 (red_block_1 is clear).

12. stack blue_block_1 grey_block_1
    - Now blue_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1, and we're not holding any block.

13. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
    - Now we're holding brown_block_1, and orange_block_2 is clear.
    - This satisfies part of constraint 4 again (brown_block_1 is not on the table).

14. putdown brown_block_1
    - brown_block_1 is back on the table, and we're not holding any block.

15. pickup orange_block_1
    - Now we're holding orange_block_1.
    - This satisfies constraint 5 (we're holding orange_block_1 after brown_block_1 was off the table).

16. putdown orange_block_1
    - orange_block_1 is back on the table, and we're not holding any block.

17. unstack blue_block_1 grey_block_1
    - Now we're holding blue_block_1, and grey_block_1 is clear.

18. putdown blue_block_1
    - blue_block_1 is on the table, and we're not holding any block.

Wait, I made a mistake. At the end, we need white_block_1 to be clear, but in step 12, I placed grey_block_1 on white_block_1, and in step 14, I placed blue_block_1 on grey_block_1. So, white_block_1 is not clear at the end.

Let me revise the plan:

We start with:
- red_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- orange_block_2 is on the table
- brown_block_1, blue_block_1, orange_block_1, and orange_block_2 are clear
- The arm is not holding any block

1. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
   - Now brown_block_1 is not on the table (satisfying part of constraint 4).

2. stack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
   - Now orange_block_2 is not clear (satisfying constraint 1).

3. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1
   - Now red_block_1 is clear (satisfying part of constraint 6).

4. putdown grey_block_1
   - Now grey_block_1 is on the table.

5. pickup red_block_1
   - Now we're holding red_block_1 while orange_block_2 is not clear (satisfying constraint 3).

6. putdown red_block_1
   - Red_block_1 is back on the table.

7. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
   - Now white_block_1 is clear (our goal).

8. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1
   - Now orange_block_1 is not on the table (satisfying constraint 2).

9. pickup grey_block_1
   - Now we're holding grey_block_1.

10. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1
    - Now grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 (satisfying part of constraint 6).

11. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
    - Now brown_block_1 is not on the table again (satisfying constraint 4 again).

12. putdown brown_block_1
    - brown_block_1 is back on the table.

13. pickup orange_block_1
    - Now we're holding orange_block_1 after brown_block_1 was off the table (satisfying constraint 5).
    - But this doesn't work because orange_block_1 has blue_block_1 on top of it.

Oh, this is getting a bit tricky. Let me think again.

Let's reconsider constraint 5: If brown_block_1 is not on the table, then at that state or a later state, we need to hold orange_block_1.

We can first make brown_block_1 not on the table (by unstacking it), and then immediately hold orange_block_1, but that means orange_block_1 should be clear.

Actually, let's just revise the plan from the beginning, considering all constraints together:

We start with:
- red_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- orange_block_2 is on the table
- brown_block_1, blue_block_1, orange_block_1, and orange_block_2 are clear
- The arm is not holding any block

1. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
   - Now we're holding brown_block_1, and grey_block_1 is clear.
   - This satisfies part of constraint 4 (brown_block_1 is not on the table).

2. putdown brown_block_1
   - brown_block_1 is back on the table, and we're not holding any block.

3. pickup orange_block_1
   - Now we're holding orange_block_1.
   - This satisfies constraint 5 (we're holding orange_block_1 after brown_block_1 was off the table).

4. stack orange_block_1 orange_block_2
   - This satisfies constraint 1 (orange_block_2 is not clear) and constraint 2 (orange_block_1 is not on the table).
   - Now orange_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2, and we're not holding any block.

5. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1
   - Now we're holding grey_block_1, and red_block_1 is clear.

6. putdown grey_block_1
   - grey_block_1 is on the table, and we're not holding any block.

7. pickup red_block_1
   - Now we're holding red_block_1 while orange_block_2 is not clear (satisfying constraint 3).

8. putdown red_block_1
   - red_block_1 is back on the table, and we're not holding any block.

9. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
   - Now we're holding blue_block_1, and white_block_1 is clear (our goal).

10. stack blue_block_1 red_block_1
    - Now blue_block_1 is on top of red_block_1, and we're not holding any block.

11. pickup grey_block_1
    - Now we're holding grey_block_1.

12. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1
    - This satisfies part of constraint 6 (grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1).
    - Now grey_block_1 is on white_block_1, and we're not holding any block.

13. unstack grey_block_1 white_block_1
    - Now we're holding grey_block_1, and white_block_1 is clear (our goal).

Actually, I think I overcomplicated again. We just need to make sure white_block_1 is clear at the end of our plan and that we've satisfied all constraints at some point during the plan.

Let's revise our plan again:

We start with:
- red_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- orange_block_2 is on the table
- brown_block_1, blue_block_1, orange_block_1, and orange_block_2 are clear
- The arm is not holding any block

1. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
   - Now we're holding brown_block_1, and grey_block_1 is clear.
   - This satisfies part of constraint 4 (brown_block_1 is not on the table).

2. stack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
   - This satisfies constraint 1 (orange_block_2 is not clear).
   - Now brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2, and we're not holding any block.

3. pickup orange_block_1
   - Now we're holding orange_block_1.
   - This satisfies constraint 5 (we're holding orange_block_1 after brown_block_1 was off the table).

4. putdown orange_block_1
   - orange_block_1 is back on the table, and we're not holding any block.

5. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1
   - Now we're holding grey_block_1, and red_block_1 is clear.

6. stack grey_block_1 orange_block_1
   - This satisfies constraint 2 (orange_block_1 is not on the table).
   - Now grey_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1, and we're not holding any block.

7. pickup red_block_1
   - Now we're holding red_block_1 while orange_block_2 is not clear (satisfying constraint 3).

8. putdown red_block_1
   - red_block_1 is back on the table, and we're not holding any block.

9. unstack grey_block_1 orange_block_1
   - Now we're holding grey_block_1, and orange_block_1 is clear.

10. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
    - But we can't do this because we're already holding grey_block_1.

Ok, I missed something again. Let's be more careful about the constraints and the sequence of actions:

We start with:
- red_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- orange_block_2 is on the table
- brown_block_1, blue_block_1, orange_block_1, and orange_block_2 are clear
- The arm is not holding any block

1. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
   - Now we're holding brown_block_1, and grey_block_1 is clear.
   - This satisfies part of constraint 4 (brown_block_1 is not on the table).

2. stack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
   - This satisfies constraint 1 (orange_block_2 is not clear).
   - Now brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2, and we're not holding any block.

3. pickup orange_block_1
   - Now we're holding orange_block_1.
   - This satisfies constraint 5 (we're holding orange_block_1 after brown_block_1 was off the table).

4. stack orange_block_1 brown_block_1
   - This satisfies constraint 2 (orange_block_1 is not on the table).
   - Now orange_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1, and we're not holding any block.

5. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1
   - Now we're holding grey_block_1, and red_block_1 is clear.

6. putdown grey_block_1
   - grey_block_1 is on the table, and we're not holding any block.

7. pickup red_block_1
   - Now we're holding red_block_1 while orange_block_2 is not clear (satisfying constraint 3).

8. putdown red_block_1
   - red_block_1 is back on the table, and we're not holding any block.

9. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
   - Now we're holding blue_block_1, and white_block_1 is clear (our goal).

10. stack blue_block_1 red_block_1
    - Now blue_block_1 is on top of red_block_1, and we're not holding any block.

11. pickup grey_block_1
    - Now we're holding grey_block_1.

12. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1
    - This satisfies part of constraint 6 (grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and red_block_1 is clear).
    - Now grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, and we're not holding any block.

13. unstack grey_block_1 white_block_1
    - Now we're holding grey_block_1, and white_block_1 is clear.

14. putdown grey_block_1
    - grey_block_1 is on the table, and we're not holding any block.

This satisfies all the constraints and leaves white_block_1 clear at the end. But it feels like I'm missing something.

Let me review the constraints one more time:

1. At some point, orange_block_2 should not be clear - Satisfied in steps 2-13.
2. At some point, orange_block_1 should not be on the table - Satisfied in steps 4-9+ (orange_block_1 is on brown_block_1)
3. At some point, we need to hold red_block_1 while orange_block_2 has a block on top of it - Satisfied in step 7.
4. At some point, brown_block_1 should not be on the table - Satisfied in steps 1, 2-9+ (brown_block_1 is on orange_block_2)
5. If brown_block_1 is not on the table, then at that state or a later state, we need to hold orange_block_1 - Satisfied in step 3.
6. At some point, grey_block_1 should be on top of white_block_1 and red_block_1 should be clear - Satisfied in step 12.

So, this plan satisfies all constraints and leaves white_block_1 clear at the end. But let's check if it's the optimal (shortest) plan.

Actually, I think we can remove steps 13 and 14, since the goal is just to have white_block_1 clear at the end, and after step 12, white_block_1 is not clear. So we need to unstack grey_block_1 from white_block_1.

Here's the revised plan:

1. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
2. stack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
3. pickup orange_block_1
4. stack orange_block_1 brown_block_1
5. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1
6. putdown grey_block_1
7. pickup red_block_1
8. putdown red_block_1
9. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
10. stack blue_block_1 red_block_1
11. pickup grey_block_1
12. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1
13. unstack grey_block_1 white_block_1
14. putdown grey_block_1

Wait, I continue to make a mistake here. In this plan, after step 12, our goal (white_block_1 is clear) is not satisfied, since grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1. So, we need steps 13 and 14 to clear white_block_1. The goal is to leave white_block_1 clear at the end, not at some point during the plan.

Hmm, let me think about constraint 6 again. It says: "At some point, grey_block_1 should be on top of white_block_1 and red_block_1 should be clear".

Actually after rereading constraint 6, I see that it's asking for a state where both grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 AND red_block_1 is clear. In my previous plan, red_block_1 is not clear after step 10, since blue_block_1 is on top of it. So, let me revise the plan again:

We start with:
- red_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- orange_block_2 is on the table
- brown_block_1, blue_block_1, orange_block_1, and orange_block_2 are clear
- The arm is not holding any block

1. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
   - Now we're holding brown_block_1, and grey_block_1 is clear.
   - This satisfies part of constraint 4 (brown_block_1 is not on the table).

2. stack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
   - This satisfies constraint 1 (orange_block_2 is not clear).
   - Now brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2, and we're not holding any block.

3. pickup orange_block_1
   - Now we're holding orange_block_1.
   - This satisfies constraint 5 (we're holding orange_block_1 after brown_block_1 was off the table).

4. stack orange_block_1 brown_block_1
   - This satisfies constraint 2 (orange_block_1 is not on the table).
   - Now orange_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1, and we're not holding any block.

5. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1
   - Now we're holding grey_block_1, and red_block_1 is clear.

6. putdown grey_block_1
   - grey_block_1 is on the table, and we're not holding any block.

7. pickup red_block_1
   - Now we're holding red_block_1 while orange_block_2 is not clear (satisfying constraint 3).

8. putdown red_block_1
   - red_block_1 is back on the table, and we're not holding any block.

9. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
   - Now we're holding blue_block_1, and white_block_1 is clear.

10. putdown blue_block_1
    - blue_block_1 is on the table, and we're not holding any block.

11. pickup grey_block_1
    - Now we're holding grey_block_1.

12. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1
    - Now grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, and red_block_1 is clear.
    - This satisfies constraint 6 (grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and red_block_1 is clear).

13. unstack grey_block_1 white_block_1
    - Now we're holding grey_block_1, and white_block_1 is clear (our goal).

14. putdown grey_block_1
    - grey_block_1 is on the table, and we're not holding any block.

Actually, let me think again. The goal is to have white_block_1 clear at the end of the plan. But in constraint 6, it asks for a state where both grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and red_block_1 is clear. If grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, then white_block_1 is not clear.

So, we need a state where grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and red_block_1 is clear, but the final state should have white_block_1 clear. That means we need to remove grey_block_1 from white_block_1 after satisfying constraint 6.

Let me revise the plan once more:

1. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
2. stack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
3. pickup orange_block_1
4. stack orange_block_1 brown_block_1
5. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1
6. putdown grey_block_1
7. pickup red_block_1
8. putdown red_block_1
9. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
10. putdown blue_block_1
11. pickup grey_block_1
12. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1
13. unstack grey_block_1 white_block_1
14. putdown grey_block_1

I can further optimize this plan by removing step 6, since after step 5, we're holding grey_block_1, and we can directly move on to step 9 without putting grey_block_1 down. Similarly, we can remove steps 11-14 since after step 9, white_block_1 is already clear, and we already have a state where both grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 (step 12) and red_block_1 is clear.

Let's optimize the plan:

1. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
2. stack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
3. pickup orange_block_1
4. stack orange_block_1 brown_block_1
5. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1
6. pickup red_block_1
   - But this doesn't work because we're already holding grey_block_1 after step 5.

Ok, we really do need steps 6-8. Let's try optimizing the plan another way:

1. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
2. stack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
3. pickup orange_block_1
4. stack orange_block_1 brown_block_1
5. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1
6. putdown grey_block_1
7. pickup red_block_1
8. putdown red_block_1
9. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1

We can stop here because after step 9, white_block_1 is clear, which is our goal.

But wait, we haven't satisfied constraint 6 yet, which requires a state where both grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and red_block_1 is clear.

So, we need to add a few more steps:

10. putdown blue_block_1
11. pickup grey_block_1
12. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1

Now, both grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and red_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint 6. But our goal is to have white_block_1 clear at the end, so we need to continue:

13. unstack grey_block_1 white_block_1
14. putdown grey_block_1

After these steps, white_block_1 is clear, and all constraints have been satisfied at some point during the plan.

Wait, I just realized I missed something important. We're trying to find an OPTIMAL plan, i.e., a valid plan whose length is equal or less than the length of any other valid plan. So, we're looking for the shortest plan that satisfies all constraints and leaves white_block_1 clear at the end.

Let's really think deeply about this. We need to:
1. Make orange_block_2 not clear at some point (satisfied by putting a block on top of it).
2. Make orange_block_1 not on the table at some point (satisfied by stacking it on another block).
3. Hold red_block_1 while orange_block_2 is not clear (satisfied by holding red_block_1 when a block is on top of orange_block_2).
4. Make brown_block_1 not on the table at some point (satisfied by unstacking it or stacking it on another block).
5. Hold orange_block_1 after brown_block_1 is not on the table (satisfied by holding orange_block_1 after unstacking or stacking brown_block_1).
6. Have a state where grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and red_block_1 is clear (satisfied by stacking grey_block_1 on white_block_1 and ensuring red_block_1 has no block on top).
7. Leave white_block_1 clear at the end.

Ok, let's think about the initial state again:
- red_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- orange_block_2 is on the table
- brown_block_1, blue_block_1, orange_block_1, and orange_block_2 are clear
- The arm is not holding any block

I'm thinking about the simplest way to satisfy all the constraints. Let me start by unstacking brown_block_1, which is at the top of the first tower:

1. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
   - Now we're holding brown_block_1, and both grey_block_1 and brown_block_1 are not on the table.
   - This satisfies part of constraint 4 (brown_block_1 is not on the table).

2. stack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
   - This satisfies constraint 1 (orange_block_2 is not clear).
   - Now brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2, and we're not holding any block.

3. pickup orange_block_1
   - Now we're holding orange_block_1.
   - This satisfies constraint 5 (we're holding orange_block_1 after brown_block_1 is not on the table).

4. stack orange_block_1 brown_block_1
   - This satisfies constraint 2 (orange_block_1 is not on the table).
   - Now orange_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1, and we're not holding any block.

5. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1
   - Now we're holding grey_block_1, and red_block_1 is clear.

6. putdown grey_block_1
   - grey_block_1 is on the table, and we're not holding any block.

7. pickup red_block_1
   - Now we're holding red_block_1 while orange_block_2 is not clear (satisfying constraint 3).

8. putdown red_block_1
   - red_block_1 is back on the table, and we're not holding any block.

9. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
   - Now we're holding blue_block_1, and white_block_1 is clear (our goal).

10. putdown blue_block_1
    - blue_block_1 is on the table, and we're not holding any block.

11. pickup grey_block_1
    - Now we're holding grey_block_1.

12. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1
    - This satisfies constraint 6 (grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and red_block_1 is clear).
    - Now grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, and we're not holding any block.

13. unstack grey_block_1 white_block_1
    - Now we're holding grey_block_1, and white_block_1 is clear.

14. putdown grey_block_1
    - grey_block_1 is on the table, and we're not holding any block.

This plan satisfies all the constraints and leaves white_block_1 clear at the end. But is it optimal (shortest)? Let's think if we can reduce the number of steps.

Constraints 1-5 seem to naturally sequence like this: unstack brown_block_1, stack it on orange_block_2, pickup orange_block_1, and stack it on brown_block_1. This sequence efficiently satisfies these constraints.

For constraint 6 and the goal, we need to clear white_block_1 (by unstacking blue_block_1), and at some point, have grey_block_1 on top of white_block_1 and red_block_1 clear. We can satisfy this by: unstacking blue_block_1, stacking grey_block_1 on white_block_1, and then unstacking grey_block_1.

red_block_1 is initially under grey_block_1 and brown_block_1, so we need to unstack these blocks to access it. The simplest way to satisfy constraint 3 is to hold red_block_1 after we've already ensured orange_block_2 is not clear.

Given this reasoning, I believe the plan I provided is optimal or very close to it.

Ok, I'm convinced that this is an optimal plan:

1. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
2. stack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
3. pickup orange_block_1
4. stack orange_block_1 brown_block_1
5. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1
6. putdown grey_block_1
7. pickup red_block_1
8. putdown red_block_1
9. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
10. putdown blue_block_1
11. pickup grey_block_1
12. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1
13. unstack grey_block_1 white_block_1
14. putdown grey_block_1

This plan satisfies all the constraints and leaves white_block_1 clear at the end. It seems to be the shortest way to satisfy all the given constraints and the goal.

Actually, I think I was mistaken above. The tasks asks us to make "white_block_1 is clear" be true by the end of the plan, not to hold throughout the plan. So, in fact steps 13 and 14 are necessary for making the goal true. Let me double-check that this plan indeed satisfies all the constraints and the goal:

1. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
2. stack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
3. pickup orange_block_1
4. stack orange_block_1 brown_block_1
5. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1
6. putdown grey_block_1
7. pickup red_block_1
8. putdown red_block_1
9. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
10. putdown blue_block_1
11. pickup grey_block_1
12. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1
13. unstack grey_block_1 white_block_1
14. putdown grey_block_1

- Goal: white_block_1 is clear. Satisfied after step 14.
- Constraint 1: orange_block_2 is not clear. Satisfied in steps 2-12.
- Constraint 2: orange_block_1 is not on the table. Satisfied in steps 4-12.
- Constraint 3: holding red_block_1 while orange_block_2 is not clear. Satisfied in step 7.
- Constraint 4: brown_block_1 is not on the table. Satisfied in steps 1-12.
- Constraint 5: holding orange_block_1 after brown_block_1 is not on the table. Satisfied in step 3.
- Constraint 6: grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and red_block_1 is clear. Satisfied in step 12.

All constraints and the goal are satisfied with this plan, and it seems to be the shortest way to do so. The most critical constraint is 6, which requires a state where grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and red_block_1 is clear. This directly conflicts with the goal (white_block_1 is clear), so we need to ensure that grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 at some point, but not at the end.

I think this plan works well:

```
unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
stack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
pickup orange_block_1
stack orange_block_1 brown_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
pickup red_block_1
putdown red_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
pickup grey_block_1
stack grey_block_1 white_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 white_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
```

Actually, let me double-check if we actually need to pick up and put down red_block_1 in steps 7 and 8. Constraint 3 says we need to be holding red_block_1 while orange_block_2 is not clear, which is satisfied by step 7. And it's essential to pickup red_block_1, as it's the only block that has constraint 3 associated with it.

Similarly, constraints 1, 2, and 4 are specific to orange_block_2, orange_block_1, and brown_block_1, respectively. And constraint 5 requires holding orange_block_1 after brown_block_1 is not on the table.

Constraint 6 requires a state where grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and red_block_1 is clear, which is satisfied in step 12.

So, it seems all constraints are necessary and satisfied in our plan.

Wait, I think I may have been overthinking this. Let me rethink our solution:

1. The goal is to have white_block_1 clear at the end.
2. Initially, blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1.
3. So, the simplest way to achieve the goal would be to unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 and possibly place it somewhere else (or leave it on the table).
4. But the plan also needs to satisfy the given constraints at some point during execution.

So, a straightforward approach would be:
1. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1.
2. Satisfy all other constraints.

Given that some constraints might interfere with the goal (like constraint 6, which requires grey_block_1 on top of white_block_1), we need to be careful.

But I think our previously devised plan is indeed optimal:

1. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
2. stack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
3. pickup orange_block_1
4. stack orange_block_1 brown_block_1
5. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1
6. putdown grey_block_1
7. pickup red_block_1
8. putdown red_block_1
9. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
10. putdown blue_block_1
11. pickup grey_block_1
12. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1
13. unstack grey_block_1 white_block_1
14. putdown grey_block_1

This satisfies all constraints and the goal, and it seems to be the most efficient way to do so.

Wait, one moment. What are the constraints of "Blocksworld"? I think we should reread the problem to make sure I didn't miss any constraints:

"pickup": You may only perform this action on a block b if: (i) there is no block on top of b, i.e., block b is "clear", (ii) b is placed on the table, and (iii) you are currently not holding any block.

"putdown": You may only perform this action on a block b if you are currently holding block b.

"stack": You may only perform this action on some blocks b1 and b2 if (i) you are currently holding block b1, and (ii) block b2 does not have any block on top of it, i.e., b2 is "clear".

"unstack": You may only perform this action on some blocks b1 and b2 if (i) block b1 is on top of block b2 (ii) block b1 does not have any block on top of it, i.e., b1 is "clear", and (iii) you are not currently holding any block.

Ok, I think we're done. Our plan is:

1. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
2. stack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
3. pickup orange_block_1
4. stack orange_block_1 brown_block_1
5. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1
6. putdown grey_block_1
7. pickup red_block_1
8. putdown red_block_1
9. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
10. putdown blue_block_1
11. pickup grey_block_1
12. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1
13. unstack grey_block_1 white_block_1
14. putdown grey_block_1

It's hard for me to be sure that we have the absolute minimal plan length given the interdependencies between the constraints, but I'm confident that this plan efficiently satisfies all constraints and the goal with minimal redundancy.

Actually, let me double-check our plan once more, analyzing each step:

1. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1: This satisfies part of constraint 4 (brown_block_1 is not on the table).
2. stack brown_block_1 orange_block_2: This satisfies constraint 1 (orange_block_2 is not clear).
3. pickup orange_block_1: This satisfies constraint 5 (holding orange_block_1 after brown_block_1 is not on the table).
4. stack orange_block_1 brown_block_1: This satisfies constraint 2 (orange_block_1 is not on the table).
5. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1: This is necessary to make red_block_1 clear for steps 7-8.
6. putdown grey_block_1: This is necessary to free the arm for step 7.
7. pickup red_block_1: This satisfies constraint 3 (holding red_block_1 while orange_block_2 is not clear).
8. putdown red_block_1: This is necessary to free the arm for step 9.
9. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1: This is necessary to make white_block_1 clear for step 12.
10. putdown blue_block_1: This is necessary to free the arm for step 11.
11. pickup grey_block_1: This is necessary for step 12.
12. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1: This satisfies constraint 6 (grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and red_block_1 is clear).
13. unstack grey_block_1 white_block_1: This is necessary to make white_block_1 clear (the goal).
14. putdown grey_block_1: This completes the goal by ensuring white_block_1 is clear and the arm is free.

Actually let me make one optimiztion: in our plan, after step 10, we can skip directly to step 13, because after step 9, white_block_1 is already clear, satisfying the goal. But we skip constraint 6 then, which requires a state where grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and red_block_1 is clear.

Actually, I don't think we need this optmization. If we want the goal to be satisfied and all constraints to be met, then we need all 14 steps.

Let's simplify the argument:
1. Steps 1-8 are necessary to satisfy constraints 1-5, which involve brown_block_1, orange_block_1, orange_block_2, and red_block_1.
2. Steps 9-10 are necessary to clear white_block_1 for step 12.
3. Steps 11-12 are necessary to satisfy constraint 6 (grey_block_1 on top of white_block_1 and red_block_1 clear).
4. Steps 13-14 are necessary to satisfy the goal (white_block_1 clear) after constraint 6 has been satisfied.

So, all 14 steps are essential for satisfying the constraints and the goal.

```
unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
stack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
pickup orange_block_1
stack orange_block_1 brown_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
pickup red_block_1
putdown red_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
pickup grey_block_1
stack grey_block_1 white_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 white_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
```

Yeah, I think this is our optimal plan.
