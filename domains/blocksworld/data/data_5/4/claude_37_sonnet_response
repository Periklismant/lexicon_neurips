Let's take a step back and understand the problem and the constraints we have.

First, we need to understand the current state.
- green_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on the table
- orange_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
- purple_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- blue_block_2 is on the table
- orange_block_1 is clear
- purple_block_2 is clear
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- blue_block_2 is clear
- the arm is empty

Our goal is to have purple_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1.

Now, let me analyze the constraints:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "blue_block_1 is not on the table", "blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1""
   This means that in at least one state of our plan, either blue_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1. 

2. "The following expression must hold in every state: "purple_block_2 is not on the table""
   This means we must never place purple_block_2 on the table.

3. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "The following conditions are all true: "there is no block on top of green_block_1, i.e., green_block_1 is clear", "you are holding blue_block_2"""
   This means that in at least one state, green_block_1 should be clear (no block on top of it) and at the same time, the arm is holding blue_block_2.

4. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "you are holding purple_block_2""
   This means that in at least one state, the arm is holding purple_block_2.

5. "If expression "you are holding purple_block_2" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "The following conditions are all true: "blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1", "blue_block_1 is not on the table"""
   This means that before we reach a state where the arm is holding purple_block_2, we must first reach a state where blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1 and blue_block_1 is not on the table.

6. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "there is a block on top of purple_block_2, i.e., purple_block_2 is not clear""
   This means that in at least one state, purple_block_2 should have a block on top of it.

7. "If expression "there is a block on top of purple_block_2, i.e., purple_block_2 is not clear" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1", "purple_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1"""
   This means that before we reach a state where purple_block_2 has a block on top of it, we must first reach a state where either yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 or purple_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1.

Let's consider the movement of blocks to reach our goal state. 

Our goal is to have purple_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1.

In the initial state, yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1, and purple_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_2 on top of it. 

So to achieve our goal, we need to:
1. Move purple_block_2 off of purple_block_1.
2. Move yellow_block_1 off of blue_block_1.
3. Place purple_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1.

While doing so, we need to satisfy all the constraints.

Let's start thinking of a plan. 

First, let's see if we can satisfy the constraint "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "blue_block_1 is not on the table", "blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1""".

We can satisfy this by either moving blue_block_1 off the table or by placing blue_block_2 on top of orange_block_1. Let's try to do the latter since we'll eventually need to move yellow_block_1 off blue_block_1 anyway.

But first, we need to clear green_block_1 (i.e., move orange_block_1 off of green_block_1) and also hold blue_block_2 at the same time to satisfy constraint 3. So, we might want to first move orange_block_1 off green_block_1 to make it clear, and then pick up blue_block_2.

Looking at constraint 7, we need to first create a state where either yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 or purple_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1. We'll try to do the latter.

Constraint 5 says that before holding purple_block_2, we need a state where blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1 and blue_block_1 is not on the table.

Ok, so roughly the plan looks like:
1. Move orange_block_1 off green_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 3 partially).
2. Put orange_block_1 on the table.
3. Pick up blue_block_2 (to satisfy constraint 3 fully).
4. Stack blue_block_2 on orange_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 1 and part of constraint 5).
5. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1.
6. Stack yellow_block_1 on another block or the table.
7. Pick up blue_block_1 and put it on another block (to satisfy the other part of constraint 5).
8. Unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 4).
9. Put purple_block_2 on some block (to satisfy constraint 2, which says purple_block_2 should never be on the table).
10. Pick up purple_block_1.
11. Stack purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1 (to achieve the goal).

Now, let's refine this further. Remember, we also need to satisfy constraint 6, which says that purple_block_2 should have a block on top of it at some point.

OK, let's try to create a more detailed plan that satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal.

First, let's understand the initial state more visually:

Table: green_block_1, blue_block_1, purple_block_1, blue_block_2
on green_block_1: orange_block_1
on blue_block_1: yellow_block_1
on purple_block_1: purple_block_2
Clear blocks: orange_block_1, yellow_block_1, purple_block_2, blue_block_2

And our goal is to have purple_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1.

Alright, let's make a more detailed plan, step by step, considering the constraints:

1. unstack orange_block_1 from green_block_1
   - Now, orange_block_1 is in hand and green_block_1 is clear.

2. putdown orange_block_1
   - Now, orange_block_1 is on the table and clear, and the hand is empty.

3. pickup blue_block_2
   - Now, blue_block_2 is in hand.
   - This, combined with green_block_1 being clear, satisfies constraint 3.

4. stack blue_block_2 on orange_block_1
   - Now, blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1, which satisfies part of constraint 5 and constraint 1.

5. unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1
   - Now, yellow_block_1 is in hand and blue_block_1 is clear.

6. stack yellow_block_1 on orange_block_1 (or on blue_block_2)
   - actually, let's go with stacking it on blue_block_2 for now,
   - so yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2, and the hand is empty.

7. pickup blue_block_1
   - Now, blue_block_1 is in hand and not on the table, which satisfies the other part of constraint 5.

8. stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_1
   - Now, blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, and the hand is empty.

9. unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1
   - Now, purple_block_2 is in hand and purple_block_1 is clear.
   - This satisfies constraint 4.

10. stack purple_block_2 on blue_block_1
    - Now, purple_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1, and the hand is empty.
    - This satisfies constraint 2 (which says purple_block_2 should never be on the table).

11. pickup blue_block_2
    - Now, blue_block_2, and orange_block_1 is clear.

12. stack blue_block_2 on purple_block_2
    - Now, blue_block_2 is on top of purple_block_2, and the hand is empty.
    - This ensures that purple_block_2 is not clear, satisfying constraint 6.
    - But wait, according to constraint 7, before having a block on top of purple_block_2, we need to have a state where either yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 or purple_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1. 
    - Actually, based on our steps, we've had purple_block_2 on top of blue_block_1, so we've satisfied constraint 7.

13. pickup purple_block_1
    - Now, purple_block_1 is in hand.

14. stack purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1 (to achieve the goal)
    - Oh wait, yellow_block_1 is not clear based on our steps. We need to fix our plan.

Actually, let me rethink our approach to make sure we have purple_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1 in the end.

In our initial state, yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1, and purple_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_2 on top of it.

Let's revisit the constraints and see if we can adjust our plan.

Alright, I've reconsidered the constraints and the goal. Let's try a different plan.

Rough outline:
1. First, let's satisfy the constraint "The following conditions are all true: 'there is no block on top of green_block_1, i.e., green_block_1 is clear', 'you are holding blue_block_2'".
2. Then, let's set up a scenario where blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1 and blue_block_1 is not on the table.
3. After that, we can get to a state where we are holding purple_block_2.
4. We'll also need to ensure that purple_block_2 is not clear at some point.
5. Finally, we'll work towards the goal of having purple_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1.

Detailed plan:

Initial state:
- green_block_1 is on the table with orange_block_1 on top of it.
- blue_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top of it.
- purple_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_2 on top of it.
- blue_block_2 is on the table and clear.
- orange_block_1, yellow_block_1, purple_block_2, and blue_block_2 are clear.

Step 1: unstack orange_block_1 from green_block_1
Now:
- green_block_1 is on the table and clear.
- blue_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top of it.
- purple_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_2 on top of it.
- blue_block_2 is on the table and clear.
- orange_block_1 is being held by the arm.

Step 2: putdown orange_block_1
Now:
- green_block_1 is on the table and clear.
- blue_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top of it.
- purple_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_2 on top of it.
- blue_block_2 is on the table and clear.
- orange_block_1 is on the table and clear.
- The arm is empty.

Step 3: pickup blue_block_2
Now:
- green_block_1 is on the table and clear.
- blue_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top of it.
- purple_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_2 on top of it.
- blue_block_2 is being held by the arm.
- orange_block_1 is on the table and clear.
- Constraint 3 is satisfied: green_block_1 is clear and the arm is holding blue_block_2.

Step 4: stack blue_block_2 on orange_block_1
Now:
- green_block_1 is on the table and clear.
- blue_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top of it.
- purple_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_2 on top of it.
- blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1 and clear.
- orange_block_1 is on the table.
- The arm is empty.
- Constraint 1 is satisfied: blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1.

Step 5: unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1
Now:
- green_block_1 is on the table and clear.
- blue_block_1 is on the table and clear.
- purple_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_2 on top of it.
- blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1 and clear.
- orange_block_1 is on the table.
- yellow_block_1 is being held by the arm.

Step 6: stack yellow_block_1 on orange_block_1
Now:
- green_block_1 is on the table and clear.
- blue_block_1 is on the table and clear.
- purple_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_2 on top of it.
- blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1 and clear.
- orange_block_1 is on the table.
- yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1.
- The arm is empty.
- Constraint 7 is partially satisfied: in this state, yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1.

Step 7: pickup blue_block_1
Now:
- green_block_1 is on the table and clear.
- blue_block_1 is being held by the arm.
- purple_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_2 on top of it.
- blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1 and clear.
- orange_block_1 is on the table.
- yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1.
- Constraint 5 is partially satisfied: in this state, blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1 and blue_block_1 is not on the table.

Step 8: stack blue_block_1 on blue_block_2
Now:
- green_block_1 is on the table and clear.
- blue_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2 and clear.
- purple_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_2 on top of it.
- blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1.
- orange_block_1 is on the table.
- yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1.
- The arm is empty.

Wait, there's a mistake here. I said "yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1", but that's not possible given the steps I've laid out. Let's fix that.

Step 6 (corrected): stack yellow_block_1 on green_block_1
Now:
- green_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top of it.
- blue_block_1 is on the table and clear.
- purple_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_2 on top of it.
- blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1 and clear.
- orange_block_1 is on the table.
- The arm is empty.

Step 7 (same as before): pickup blue_block_1
Now:
- green_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top of it.
- blue_block_1 is being held by the arm.
- purple_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_2 on top of it.
- blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1 and clear.
- orange_block_1 is on the table.
- Constraint 5 is partially satisfied: in this state, blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1 and blue_block_1 is not on the table.

Wait, yellow_block_1 is on green_block_1 in this state, but we eventually want to put purple_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1. Let me rethink the sequence.

Let's try a slightly different approach...

Original state:
- green_block_1 is on the table with orange_block_1 on top of it.
- blue_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top of it.
- purple_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_2 on top of it.
- blue_block_2 is on the table and clear.
- orange_block_1, yellow_block_1, purple_block_2, and blue_block_2 are clear.
- The arm is empty.

Step 1: unstack orange_block_1 from green_block_1
- Now, green_block_1 is clear and orange_block_1 is in hand.

Step 2: putdown orange_block_1
- Now, orange_block_1 is on the table and clear, and the arm is empty.

Step 3: pickup blue_block_2
- Now, blue_block_2 is in hand.
- This, combined with green_block_1 being clear, satisfies constraint 3.

Step 4: stack blue_block_2 on orange_block_1
- Now, blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1 and clear, and the arm is empty.
- This partially satisfies constraint 5.

Step 5: unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1
- Now, blue_block_1 is clear, and yellow_block_1 is in hand.

Step 6: putdown yellow_block_1
- Now, yellow_block_1 is on the table and clear, and the arm is empty.

Step 7: pickup blue_block_1
- Now, blue_block_1 is in hand and not on the table.
- This completes the satisfaction of constraint 5.

Step 8: stack blue_block_1 on blue_block_2
- Now, blue_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2 and clear, and the arm is empty.

Step 9: unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1
- Now, purple_block_1 is clear, and purple_block_2 is in hand.
- This satisfies constraint 4.

Step 10: stack purple_block_2 on blue_block_1
- Now, purple_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1 and clear, and the arm is empty.
- This satisfies constraint 2.
- This also ensures that purple_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1, which, along with the state in Step 5 where blue_block_1 is not on the table, satisfies constraint 7.

Step 11: pickup purple_block_1
- Now, purple_block_1 is in hand.

Step 12: stack purple_block_1 on purple_block_2
- Now, purple_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2 and clear, and the arm is empty.
- This ensures that there's a block on top of purple_block_2, which satisfies constraint 6.

But now we're drifting away from our goal of having purple_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1.

Let me redo the plan, focusing on the goal:

Original state:
- green_block_1 is on the table with orange_block_1 on top of it.
- blue_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top of it.
- purple_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_2 on top of it.
- blue_block_2 is on the table and clear.
- orange_block_1, yellow_block_1, purple_block_2, and blue_block_2 are clear.
- The arm is empty.

Step 1: unstack orange_block_1 from green_block_1
- Now, green_block_1 is clear and orange_block_1 is in hand.

Step 2: putdown orange_block_1
- Now, orange_block_1 is on the table and clear, and the arm is empty.

Step 3: pickup blue_block_2
- Now, blue_block_2 is in hand.
- This, combined with green_block_1 being clear, satisfies constraint 3.

Step 4: stack blue_block_2 on orange_block_1
- Now, blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1 and clear, and the arm is empty.
- This satisfies constraint 1 and partially satisfies constraint 5.

Step 5: unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1
- Now, blue_block_1 is clear, and yellow_block_1 is in hand.

I realize for constraint 7, I need either yellow_block_1 on top of orange_block_1 or purple_block_2 on top of blue_block_1 before constraint 6 is satisfied.

Step 6: stack yellow_block_1 on orange_block_1
- Now, yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1, and the arm is empty.
- This partially satisfies constraint 7.

Step 7: pickup blue_block_1
- Now, blue_block_1 is in hand and not on the table.
- This completes the satisfaction of constraint 5.

Step 8: stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_1
- Now, blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1 and clear, and the arm is empty.

Step 9: unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1
- Now, purple_block_1 is clear, and purple_block_2 is in hand.
- This satisfies constraint 4.

Step 10: stack purple_block_2 on blue_block_1
- Now, purple_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1 and clear, and the arm is empty.
- This satisfies constraint 2.

Step 11: unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (actually, this isn't possible with the current setup since purple_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1)
- Let's back up and refactor.

OK, I realize I'm making a mistake as I'm thinking through this. Let's reorganize our approach.

Actually, I think the mistake was in step 10. Let's refactor from step 8.

Step 8: stack blue_block_1 on green_block_1
- Now, blue_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 and clear, and the arm is empty.

This setup means yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1, which will satisfy part of constraint 7.

Step 9: unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1
- Now, purple_block_1 is clear, and purple_block_2 is in hand.
- This satisfies constraint 4.

Step 10: stack purple_block_2 on yellow_block_1
- Now, purple_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1 and clear, and the arm is empty.
- This satisfies constraint 2.

Now we want to pick up purple_block_1 and place it on top of yellow_block_1, but yellow_block_1 already has purple_block_2 on top of it.

Actually, let's rethink it again. Our goal is to have purple_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1. 

In our given state:
- yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- purple_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_2 on top of it

So, to achieve the goal, we need to:
1. Free purple_block_1 by moving purple_block_2.
2. Free yellow_block_1 from any blocks on top of it (right now, it's clear).
3. Pick up purple_block_1 and place it on top of yellow_block_1.

While doing so, we also need to satisfy all the constraints.

Let's try to integrate these steps.

Given the constraints, here's a potential plan:

Step 1: unstack orange_block_1 from green_block_1
- Now, green_block_1 is clear and orange_block_1 is in hand.

Step 2: putdown orange_block_1
- Now, orange_block_1 is on the table and clear, and the arm is empty.

Step 3: pickup blue_block_2
- Now, blue_block_2 is in hand.
- This, combined with green_block_1 being clear, satisfies constraint 3.

Step 4: stack blue_block_2 on orange_block_1
- Now, blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1 and clear, and the arm is empty.
- This satisfies constraint 1 and partially satisfies constraint 5.

Step 5: unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1
- Now, purple_block_1 is clear, and purple_block_2 is in hand.
- This satisfies constraint 4.

But hang on. Constraint 5 says, "If expression "you are holding purple_block_2" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "The following conditions are all true: "blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1", "blue_block_1 is not on the table"""

We've satisfied the first condition (blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1), but not the second (blue_block_1 is not on the table). So, before step 5, we need to pick up blue_block_1.

Let's refactor.

Step 1: unstack orange_block_1 from green_block_1
- Now, green_block_1 is clear and orange_block_1 is in hand.

Step 2: putdown orange_block_1
- Now, orange_block_1 is on the table and clear, and the arm is empty.

Step 3: pickup blue_block_2
- Now, blue_block_2 is in hand.
- This, combined with green_block_1 being clear, satisfies constraint 3.

Step 4: stack blue_block_2 on orange_block_1
- Now, blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1 and clear, and the arm is empty.
- This satisfies constraint 1 and partially satisfies constraint 5.

Step 5: unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1
- Now, blue_block_1 is clear, and yellow_block_1 is in hand.

step 6: stack yellow_block_1 on orange_block_1
- Now, yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2 (which is on top of orange_block_1), and the arm is empty.

Step 7: pickup blue_block_1
- Now, blue_block_1 is in hand and not on the table.
- This completes the satisfaction of constraint 5.

Now, since blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1 and blue_block_1 is not on the table, we can safely proceed with picking up purple_block_2.

Step 8: stack blue_block_1 on green_block_1
- Now, blue_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 and clear, and the arm is empty.

Step 9: unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1
- Now, purple_block_1 is clear, and purple_block_2 is in hand.
- This satisfies constraint 4.

But wait, this won't make sense. If I stack yellow_block_1 on top of orange_block_1 in step 6, I need to re-visualize the state.

Actually, let's try a different structure. 
 
Original state:
- green_block_1 is on the table with orange_block_1 on top of it.
- blue_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top of it.
- purple_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_2 on top of it.
- blue_block_2 is on the table and clear.
- orange_block_1, yellow_block_1, purple_block_2, and blue_block_2 are clear.
- The arm is empty.
 
Step 1: unstack orange_block_1 from green_block_1
- Now, green_block_1 is clear, and orange_block_1 is in hand.
 
Step 2: stack orange_block_1 on blue_block_2
- Now, orange_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2 and clear, and the arm is empty.
 
Step 3: unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1
- Now, blue_block_1 is clear, and yellow_block_1 is in hand.
 
Step 4: stack yellow_block_1 on orange_block_1
- Now, yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 (which is on top of blue_block_2) and clear, and the arm is empty.
- The state "yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1" is established, which partially satisfies constraint 7.

Step 5: pickup blue_block_1
- Now, blue_block_1 is in hand and not on the table.
 
Step 6: pickup green_block_1
- Wait actually, that doesn't work. We can't pickup anything if the arm is already holding something.

Scratch most of that.

Let's refactor.

Original state:
- green_block_1 is on the table with orange_block_1 on top of it.
- blue_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top of it.
- purple_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_2 on top of it.
- blue_block_2 is on the table and clear.
- orange_block_1, yellow_block_1, purple_block_2, and blue_block_2 are clear.
- The arm is empty.
 
Step 1: unstack orange_block_1 from green_block_1
- Now, green_block_1 is clear, and orange_block_1 is in hand.
 
Step 2: putdown orange_block_1
- Now, orange_block_1 is on the table and clear, and the arm is empty.
 
Step 3: pickup blue_block_2
- Now, blue_block_2 is in hand.
- This, combined with green_block_1 being clear, satisfies constraint 3.
 
Step 4: stack blue_block_2 on orange_block_1
- Now, blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1 and clear, and the arm is empty.
- This satisfies constraint 1 and partially satisfies constraint 5.

Step 5: unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1
- Now, blue_block_1 is clear, and yellow_block_1 is in hand.

Step 6: stack yellow_block_1 on orange_block_1
- This doesn't make sense because there's already blue_block_2 on top of orange_block_1. This block placement is inconsistent.

Let's really make sure our block placements make sense.

Original state:
- green_block_1 is on the table with orange_block_1 on top of it.
- blue_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top of it.
- purple_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_2 on top of it.
- blue_block_2 is on the table and clear.
- orange_block_1, yellow_block_1, purple_block_2, and blue_block_2 are clear.
- The arm is empty.
 
Step 1: unstack orange_block_1 from green_block_1
- Now, green_block_1 is clear, and orange_block_1 is in hand.
 
Step 2: putdown orange_block_1
- Now, orange_block_1 is on the table and clear, and the arm is empty.
 
Step 3: pickup blue_block_2
- Now, blue_block_2 is in hand.
- This, combined with green_block_1 being clear, satisfies constraint 3.
 
Step 4: stack blue_block_2 on orange_block_1
- Now, blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1 and clear, and the arm is empty.
- This satisfies constraint 1 and partially satisfies constraint 5.

Step 5: unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1
- Now, blue_block_1 is clear, and yellow_block_1 is in hand.

Step 6: stack yellow_block_1 on blue_block_2
- Now, yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2 (which is on top of orange_block_1) and clear, and the arm is empty.

Constraint 7 is "If expression "there is a block on top of purple_block_2, i.e., purple_block_2 is not clear" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1", "purple_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1"""

So, at this point, neither of the conditions in constraint 7 is satisfied. "yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1" is false because yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2. And "purple_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1" is false because purple_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1.

So we need to establish one of these states before we make purple_block_2 not clear. 

For the sake of this example, let's say we want to establish the state where purple_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1. So, we need to:

Step 7: pickup blue_block_1
- Now, blue_block_1 is in hand and not on the table.
- This satisfies the second condition in constraint 5 (blue_block_1 is not on the table). Combined with the fact that blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1 (from Step 4), this constraint is fully satisfied.

Step 8: stack blue_block_1 on green_block_1
- Now, blue_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 and clear, and the arm is empty.

Step 9: unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1
- Now, purple_block_1 is clear, and purple_block_2 is in hand.
- This satisfies constraint 4.

Step 10: stack purple_block_2 on blue_block_1
- Now, purple_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1 and clear, and the arm is empty.
- This establishes the state "purple_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1", which satisfies one of the conditions in constraint 7.
- This also satisfies constraint 2 since purple_block_2 is not on the table.

Now, we can pick up any other block and place it on top of purple_block_2 to satisfy constraint 6.

Step 11: pickup purple_block_1
- Now, purple_block_1 is in hand.

Step 12: stack purple_block_1 on purple_block_2
- Now, purple_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2 and clear, and the arm is empty.
- This satisfies constraint 6.

But that would mean purple_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2 at the end, which doesn't align with our goal of having purple_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1.

OK, I need to carefully track all of the block positions and check the constraints at each step.

I'll simplify the narrative to just the block positions.

Initial state:
table: g(o), b1(y), p1(p2), b2
where g is green_block_1, o is orange_block_1, and so on.

1. unstack o from g:
   arm: o
   table: g, b1(y), p1(p2), b2

2. putdown o:
   arm: empty
   table: g, b1(y), p1(p2), b2, o

3. pickup b2:
   arm: b2
   table: g, b1(y), p1(p2), o
   - Constraint 3 is satisfied: g is clear and the arm is holding b2.

4. stack b2 on o:
   arm: empty
   table: g, b1(y), p1(p2), o(b2)
   - Constraint 1 is satisfied: b2 is on top of o.

5. unstack y from b1:
   arm: y
   table: g, b1, p1(p2), o(b2)

OK, I need to establish either "y is on top of o" or "p2 is on top of b1" before I make p2 not clear.

But I also need to ensure b1 is not on the table and b2 is on top of o before I hold p2.

6. stack y on b2:
   arm: empty
   table: g, b1, p1(p2), o(b2(y))

7. pickup b1:
   arm: b1
   table: g, p1(p2), o(b2(y))
   - This, combined with the fact that b2 is on top of o (from step 4), satisfies constraint 5.

8. stack b1 on g:
   arm: empty
   table: g(b1), p1(p2), o(b2(y))

9. unstack p2 from p1:
   arm: p2
   table: g(b1), p1, o(b2(y))
   - Constraint 4 is satisfied: the arm is holding p2.

10. stack p2 on b1:
    arm: empty
    table: g(b1(p2)), p1, o(b2(y))
    - This establishes the state "p2 is on top of b1", which satisfies one of the conditions in constraint 7.
    - Constraint 2 is satisfied: p2 is not on the table.

Now I need to get p1 on top of y. 

11. unstack p2 from b1:
    arm: p2
    table: g(b1), p1, o(b2(y))

12. stack p2 on p1:
    arm: empty
    table: g(b1), p1(p2), o(b2(y))

13. unstack y from b2:
    arm: y
    table: g(b1), p1(p2), o(b2)

14. putdown y:
    arm: empty
    table: g(b1), p1(p2), o(b2), y

15. pickup p1:
    This won't work because p2 is on top of p1. So I need to move p2 again.

So the way I see it now. I do need to make the constraint to satisfy "there is a block on top of p2" (constraint 6), but I need to make sure I've visited one of the states in constraint 7 before that. I've achieved that in step 10. After that, I can reconfigure the positions to achieve the goal.

11. pickup g:
    This won't work because b1 is on top of g.

I need to make a small correction. Let's instead:

11. unstack y from b2:
    arm: y
    table: g(b1(p2)), p1, o(b2)

12. putdown y:
    arm: empty
    table: g(b1(p2)), p1, o(b2), y

13. unstack p2 from b1:
    arm: p2
    table: g(b1), p1, o(b2), y

14. stack p2 on p1:
    arm: empty
    table: g(b1), p1(p2), o(b2), y
    - This p2 is now back on p1, but we've already achieved the state to satisfy constraint 7 (p2 is on top of b1) in step 10.

15. pickup b1:
    arm: b1
    table: g, p1(p2), o(b2), y

16. stack b1 on p2:
    arm: empty
    table: g, p1(p2(b1)), o(b2), y
    - Constraint 6 is satisfied: p2 has a block (b1) on top of it.

17. pickup p1:
    This won't work because p2 (which has b1 on top of it) is on top of p1.

So, what I can't do is pick up p1 immediately, because p2 (and b1 on top of it) is on top of p1.

I need to rethink the placement of b1. Let me try something else.

11. unstack p2 from b1:
    arm: p2
    table: g(b1), p1, o(b2(y))

12. stack p2 on g:
    arm: empty
    table: g(p2), b1, p1, o(b2(y))

13. pickup b1:
    arm: b1
    table: g(p2), p1, o(b2(y))

14. stack b1 on p2:
    arm: empty
    table: g(p2(b1)), p1, o(b2(y))
    - Constraint 6 is satisfied: p2 has a block (b1) on top of it.

15. unstack y from b2:
    arm: y
    table: g(p2(b1)), p1, o(b2)

16. putdown y:
    arm: empty
    table: g(p2(b1)), p1, o(b2), y

17. pickup p1:
    arm: p1
    table: g(p2(b1)), o(b2), y

18. stack p1 on y:
    arm: empty
    table: g(p2(b1)), o(b2), y(p1)
    - Goal achieved: p1 is on top of y.

OK, I think this should work. Let me carefully check the constraints one more time:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "blue_block_1 is not on the table", "blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1"""
   - In many of the states (like step 4), b2 is on top of o, so this constraint is satisfied.

2. "The following expression must hold in every state: "purple_block_2 is not on the table""
   - In the initial state, p2 is on top of p1, so it's not on the table.
   - After that, when we move p2, we always place it on top of another block, never on the table, so this constraint is still satisfied.

3. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "The following conditions are all true: "there is no block on top of green_block_1, i.e., green_block_1 is clear", "you are holding blue_block_2"""
   - In step 3, g is clear and the arm is holding b2, so this constraint is satisfied.

4. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "you are holding purple_block_2""
   - In steps 9 and 11, the arm is holding p2, so this constraint is satisfied.

5. "If expression "you are holding purple_block_2" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "The following conditions are all true: "blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1", "blue_block_1 is not on the table"""
   - In step 7, b2 is on top of o and b1 is not on the table. This precedes step 9, where the arm holds p2, so this constraint is satisfied.

6. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "there is a block on top of purple_block_2, i.e., purple_block_2 is not clear""
   - In step 14, b1 is on top of p2, so this constraint is satisfied.

7. "If expression "there is a block on top of purple_block_2, i.e., purple_block_2 is not clear" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1", "purple_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1"""
   - Constraint 6 is satisfied in step 14, and in the earlier step 10, p2 is on top of b1, so one of the conditions is true. This constraint is satisfied.

I think I'm good. Let me finalize the plan:

1. unstack orange_block_1 from green_block_1
2. putdown orange_block_1
3. pickup blue_block_2
4. stack blue_block_2 on orange_block_1
5. unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1
6. stack yellow_block_1 on blue_block_2
7. pickup blue_block_1
8. stack blue_block_1 on green_block_1
9. unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1
10. stack purple_block_2 on blue_block_1
11. unstack purple_block_2 from blue_block_1
12. stack purple_block_2 on green_block_1
13. pickup blue_block_1
14. stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_2
15. unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_2
16. putdown yellow_block_1
17. pickup purple_block_1
18. stack purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1

I think I made a small error in the plan. Let's double check.

Initial:
table: g(o), b1(y), p1(p2), b2
where g is green_block_1, o is orange_block_1, and so on.

1. unstack o from g:
   arm: o
   table: g, b1(y), p1(p2), b2

2. putdown o:
   arm: empty
   table: g, b1(y), p1(p2), b2, o

3. pickup b2:
   arm: b2
   table: g, b1(y), p1(p2), o
   - Constraint 3 is satisfied: g is clear and the arm is holding b2.

4. stack b2 on o:
   arm: empty
   table: g, b1(y), p1(p2), o(b2)
   - Constraint 1 is satisfied: b2 is on top of o.

5. unstack y from b1:
   arm: y
   table: g, b1, p1(p2), o(b2)

6. stack y on b2:
   arm: empty
   table: g, b1, p1(p2), o(b2(y))

7. pickup b1:
   arm: b1
   table: g, p1(p2), o(b2(y))
   - This, combined with the fact that b2 is on top of o (from step 4), satisfies constraint 5.

8. stack b1 on g:
   arm: empty
   table: g(b1), p1(p2), o(b2(y))

9. unstack p2 from p1:
   arm: p2
   table: g(b1), p1, o(b2(y))
   - Constraint 4 is satisfied: the arm is holding p2.

10. stack p2 on b1:
    arm: empty
    table: g(b1(p2)), p1, o(b2(y))
    - This establishes the state "p2 is on top of b1", which satisfies one of the conditions in constraint 7.
    - Constraint 2 is satisfied: p2 is not on the table.

11. unstack p2 from b1:
    arm: p2
    table: g(b1), p1, o(b2(y))

Hmm, wait. I realized I pushed off p2 just to stack it somewhere else. Let me take a slightly different track from step 10.

10. stack p2 on b1:
    arm: empty
    table: g(b1(p2)), p1, o(b2(y))
    - This establishes the state "p2 is on top of b1", which satisfies one of the conditions in constraint 7.
    - Constraint 2 is satisfied: p2 is not on the table.

11. unstack y from b2:
    arm: y
    table: g(b1(p2)), p1, o(b2)

12. putdown y:
    arm: empty
    table: g(b1(p2)), p1, o(b2), y

13. pickup b2:
    arm: b2
    table: g(b1(p2)), p1, o, y

14. stack b2 on p2:
    arm: empty
    table: g(b1(p2(b2))), p1, o, y
    - Constraint 6 is satisfied: p2 has a block (b2) on top of it.

15. pickup p1:
    arm: p1
    table: g(b1(p2(b2))), o, y

16. stack p1 on y:
    arm: empty
    table: g(b1(p2(b2))), o, y(p1)
    - Goal achieved: p1 is on top of y.

OK, this looks right. Let me do one more check, focusing on the flow of blocks:

Constraint 7 states: "If expression "there is a block on top of purple_block_2, i.e., purple_block_2 is not clear" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1", "purple_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1"""

In step 14, b2 is on top of p2, so p2 is not clear. According to constraint 7, before this, we need to have had a state where either y is on top of o or p2 is on top of b1. We did have p2 on top of b1 in step 10, so this constraint is satisfied.

Let me check the other constraints again:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "blue_block_1 is not on the table", "blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1"""
   - In step 4, b2 is on top of o, so this constraint is satisfied.

2. "The following expression must hold in every state: "purple_block_2 is not on the table""
   - In the initial state, p2 is on top of p1, so it's not on the table.
   - After that, when we move p2, we always place it on top of another block, never on the table, so this constraint is satisfied.

3. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "The following conditions are all true: "there is no block on top of green_block_1, i.e., green_block_1 is clear", "you are holding blue_block_2"""
   - In step 3, g is clear and the arm is holding b2, so this constraint is satisfied.

4. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "you are holding purple_block_2""
   - In steps 9 and 11, the arm is holding p2, so this constraint is satisfied.

5. "If expression "you are holding purple_block_2" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "The following conditions are all true: "blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1", "blue_block_1 is not on the table"""
   - In step 7, b2 is on top of o and b1 is not on the table. This precedes step 9, where the arm holds p2, so this constraint is satisfied.

6. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "there is a block on top of purple_block_2, i.e., purple_block_2 is not clear""
   - In step 14, b2 is on top of p2, so this constraint is satisfied.

7. "If expression "there is a block on top of purple_block_2, i.e., purple_block_2 is not clear" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1", "purple_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1"""
   - Constraint 6 is satisfied in step 14, and in the earlier step 10, p2 is on top of b1, so one of the conditions is true. This constraint is satisfied.

Alright, I think the plan is valid. Let me finalize it:

1. unstack orange_block_1 from green_block_1
2. putdown orange_block_1
3. pickup blue_block_2
4. stack blue_block_2 on orange_block_1
5. unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1
6. stack yellow_block_1 on blue_block_2
7. pickup blue_block_1
8. stack blue_block_1 on green_block_1
9. unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1
10. stack purple_block_2 on blue_block_1
11. unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_2
12. putdown yellow_block_1
13. pickup blue_block_2
14. stack blue_block_2 on purple_block_2
15. pickup purple_block_1
16. stack purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1
