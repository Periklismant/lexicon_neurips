Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld problem. The goal is to get purple_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1. There are several constraints to satisfy, so I need to carefully plan each step while making sure all conditions are met.

First, let's understand the initial state. The blocks are arranged as follows:

- green_block_1 is on the table with orange_block_1 on top (and orange is clear).
- blue_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top (yellow is clear).
- purple_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_2 on top (purple_block_2 is clear).
- blue_block_2 is on the table and clear.

The goal is to have purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1. So, we need to move purple_block_1 from the table to yellow_block_1. But yellow_block_1 is currently on top of blue_block_1. To place something on yellow_block_1, it needs to be clear. So, first, we might need to move yellow_block_1. Wait, but the goal is to put purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1. So, if yellow is already clear, maybe we can stack purple_block_1 on it directly. Wait, no, purple_block_1 is under purple_block_2. Because in the initial state, purple_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1. So, to get purple_block_1, we need to unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1 first.

So the steps would involve:

1. Unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1. Then, putdown purple_block_2 somewhere. But wait, the constraint says that in every state, purple_block_2 is not on the table. So putting it down on the table is not allowed. Therefore, we need to stack it somewhere else.

Wait, the second constraint is that "purple_block_2 is not on the table" in every state. So, whenever we move purple_block_2, we can't put it on the table. So after unstacking it from purple_block_1, we have to stack it onto another block. But where?

Looking at the constraints, there's another one that says if purple_block_2 is not clear (i.e., something is on top of it), then in an earlier state, either yellow is on orange or purple_block_2 is on blue_block_1. So maybe we need to stack something on purple_block_2 at some point, but that requires prior conditions.

Also, there's a constraint that we must hold purple_block_2 in at least one state. And before that, there must be a state where blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1 and blue_block_1 is not on the table.

Let's outline the constraints:

1. At least one state where blue_block_1 is not on the table OR blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1.
2. Purple_block_2 is never on the table.
3. At least one state where green_block_1 is clear and holding blue_block_2.
4. At least one state holding purple_block_2.
5. If we hold purple_block_2, there must be an earlier state where blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1 and blue_block_1 is not on the table.
6. At least one state where something is on purple_block_2 (so it's not clear).
7. If something is on purple_block_2, then earlier state where yellow is on orange or purple_block_2 is on blue_block_1.

So, let's plan step by step.

First, to move purple_block_1 onto yellow_block_1, we need yellow_block_1 to be clear. Initially, yellow_block_1 is clear. So, perhaps we can directly stack purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1. But wait, purple_block_1 is under purple_block_2. So first, we need to unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1.

But unstacking purple_block_2 requires that we are not holding anything. Then, after unstack, we hold purple_block_2. Since we can't put it on the table (due to constraint 2), we need to stack it on another block. Let's see possible targets.

But where to stack purple_block_2? Let's see the blocks that are clear. Initially, orange_block_1, purple_block_2, yellow_block_1, and blue_block_2 are clear. So possible targets: orange_block_1, yellow_block_1, blue_block_2.

But let's consider the constraints. For example, the fifth constraint: before holding purple_block_2, there must be a state where blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1 and blue_block_1 is not on the table.

So, perhaps we need to first stack blue_block_2 onto orange_block_1. To do that, we need to pick up blue_block_2 (it's on the table and clear). Then stack it on orange_block_1 (which is on green_block_1). But orange_block_1 is clear, so we can stack on it.

Wait, stacking blue_block_2 on orange_block_1 would require that orange_block_1 is clear, which it is. So steps could be:

pickup blue_block_2
stack blue_block_2 orange_block_1

Then, this satisfies the fifth constraint's precondition (blue_block_2 on orange_block_1 and blue_block_1 not on the table? Wait, blue_block_1 is initially on the table. So unless we move blue_block_1, that part isn't satisfied. So the fifth constraint's condition is that blue_block_1 is not on the table. So we need to have blue_block_1 not on the table in the same state as blue_block_2 being on orange_block_1.

But blue_block_1 is initially on the table with yellow_block_1 on top. So to make blue_block_1 not on the table, we need to unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1 and put it somewhere else. But where? Let's see.

If we unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1, then blue_block_1 becomes clear. Then, we could move blue_block_1. But moving blue_block_1 would require that it's on the table and clear. After unstacking yellow_block_1, blue_block_1 is on the table and clear. So we can pick it up and stack it somewhere else. But where?

But the first constraint requires that in at least one state, either blue_block_1 is not on the table OR blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1. So if we stack blue_block_2 on orange_block_1, that satisfies the OR condition (since the second part is true). So maybe we don't need to move blue_block_1. But the fifth constraint requires that when we hold purple_block_2, there must be an earlier state where blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1 AND blue_block_1 is not on the table. Wait, the fifth constraint says: "If you hold purple_block_2 in some state, then there must be an earlier state where blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1 AND blue_block_1 is not on the table."

So that's an AND condition. So to satisfy that, we need both conditions to be true in the same earlier state. Therefore, we need to have blue_block_2 on orange_block_1 and blue_block_1 not on the table in some state before we hold purple_block_2.

So how to achieve that. Let's think:

First, move blue_block_2 onto orange_block_1. That's stacking blue_block_2 on orange_block_1. Then, move blue_block_1 from the table (since it's on the table) to somewhere else, but blue_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on top. So first, we need to unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1, then put it down, then pick up blue_block_1 and stack it elsewhere.

Wait, initial state: blue_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top (yellow is clear). So to pick up blue_block_1, we need to first remove yellow_block_1.

So steps:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
   - Now holding yellow_block_1, blue_block_1 is clear and on table.
2. putdown yellow_block_1
   - yellow_block_1 is on table, clear.
3. pickup blue_block_1
   - Now holding blue_block_1.
4. stack blue_block_1 somewhere. Maybe stack on another block. Let's say stack on green_block_1. But green_block_1 has orange_block_1 on top, which is clear. To stack on green_block_1, we need to unstack orange_block_1 first. Hmm, that complicates things. Alternatively, stack blue_block_1 on another block that's clear. For example, blue_block_2 is on the table, but after moving blue_block_2 to orange_block_1, perhaps stack blue_block_1 on another block.

Alternatively, maybe stack blue_block_1 on top of purple_block_2? But initially, purple_block_2 is on purple_block_1, and is clear. So unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1, then stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_2. Wait, but stacking blue_block_1 on purple_block_2 would require that purple_block_2 is clear. If we unstack purple_block_2 first, then we hold it, so can't stack blue_block_1 on it unless we putdown purple_block_2. But we can't put it on the table (constraint 2). So maybe stack purple_block_2 on another block first.

This is getting complicated. Let's outline the steps needed to satisfy all constraints:

We need to:

- Achieve the goal: purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1.

- Ensure that in at least one state, either blue_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1. But given the fifth constraint, when we hold purple_block_2, we need an earlier state where both blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1 and blue_block_1 is not on the table. So the fifth constraint's antecedent is that we hold purple_block_2, which we must do (constraint 4), so the fifth constraint's condition must be satisfied. Therefore, we need to have a state where blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1 and blue_block_1 is not on the table.

So, steps to satisfy that:

1. Move blue_block_2 to orange_block_1.

2. Move blue_block_1 from table to somewhere else. To do that, we need to first unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1.

So steps:

a. unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1. Then putdown yellow_block_1.

b. pickup blue_block_1 and stack it somewhere (maybe on green_block_1? But green_block_1 has orange_block_1 on top. So can't stack there unless orange is moved. Alternatively, stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_2. But to do that, need to unstack purple_block_2 first, but that's part of the process.

But let's proceed step by step.

First, unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1:

Action: unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1

Now holding yellow_block_1. Then put it down:

Action: putdown yellow_block_1

Now yellow is on table. Then pickup blue_block_1 (since it's on table and clear):

Action: pickup blue_block_1

Now need to stack it. Let's stack it on purple_block_2. But to do that, purple_block_2 must be clear. Currently, purple_block_2 is on purple_block_1 and is clear. But we can't stack on purple_block_2 unless we have it. Wait, no. To stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_2, we need to be holding blue_block_1 and purple_block_2 must be clear. But purple_block_2 is currently clear (since initial state says purple_block_2 is clear). So stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_2.

Action: stack blue_block_1 purple_block_2

Now, blue_block_1 is on purple_block_2, and purple_block_2 is not clear. This might help with constraint 6 (there's a state where something is on purple_block_2). Also, after stacking, we are not holding anything.

So now, blue_block_1 is not on the table. And blue_block_2 is still on the table. But we need blue_block_2 to be on orange_block_1. So let's move blue_block_2 to orange_block_1.

First, pickup blue_block_2 (it's on table and clear):

Action: pickup blue_block_2

Then stack on orange_block_1 (which is on green_block_1 and is clear):

Action: stack blue_block_2 orange_block_1

Now, blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1. So in this state, blue_block_1 is not on the table (it's on purple_block_2) and blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1. So this satisfies the fifth constraint's condition. So when we later hold purple_block_2, this state exists earlier.

Now, moving on. We need to handle purple_block_1. The goal is to have it on yellow_block_1. Currently, purple_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_2 on top. But we just moved purple_block_2's stack by putting blue_block_1 on it. Wait, no: purple_block_2 is on purple_block_1. Then, we stacked blue_block_1 on purple_block_2. So purple_block_2 is under blue_block_1. So purple_block_2 is still on purple_block_1, but now has blue_block_1 on top. So purple_block_2 is not clear anymore. That's important for constraint 6, which requires that in some state, purple_block_2 is not clear. So this action (stacking blue_block_1 on purple_block_2) would have satisfied that constraint. Because after stacking, purple_block_2 is not clear (it has blue_block_1 on top). So that's constraint 6 done.

But also, the seventh constraint says that if there's a state where something is on purple_block_2, then in an earlier state, either yellow is on orange or purple_block_2 is on blue_block_1. Let's check. The current state after stacking blue_block_1 on purple_block_2 has something on purple_block_2. So the seventh constraint requires that in an earlier state, either yellow is on orange or purple_block_2 is on blue_block_1. Let's see. In the initial state, purple_block_2 is on purple_block_1, not blue_block_1. So we need to have a state where purple_block_2 is on blue_block_1. Alternatively, yellow is on orange. But when we putdown yellow_block_1 earlier, it's on the table. So unless we stack it on orange_block_1, that's not the case. Alternatively, if we stack purple_block_2 on blue_block_1 at some point, then that would satisfy the seventh constraint's condition.

But in the current plan, after stacking blue_block_1 on purple_block_2, the seventh constraint's condition requires that in an earlier state, either yellow is on orange or purple_block_2 is on blue_block_1. We haven't done either. So this violates the seventh constraint. Therefore, the current step of stacking blue_block_1 on purple_block_2 is problematic because it leads to a state where purple_block_2 has a block on top (blue_block_1) without having an earlier state where either yellow is on orange or purple_block_2 is on blue_block_1.

So this approach might not work. Need to find a different way to stack something on purple_block_2 that meets the seventh constraint.

Let's backtrack. The seventh constraint says that if there's a state where something is on purple_block_2, then there must be an earlier state where either yellow is on orange or purple_block_2 is on blue_block_1.

So perhaps we need to first move purple_block_2 onto blue_block_1, then stack something on purple_block_2 later. Let's try that.

Alternative plan:

1. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1 (to clear blue_block_1).

2. Putdown yellow_block_1.

3. Pickup blue_block_1 and stack it somewhere else (maybe on green_block_1, but need to clear green_block_1 first).

Wait, green_block_1 has orange_block_1 on top, which is clear. To stack blue_block_1 on green_block_1, we need to unstack orange_block_1 first. But that complicates things. Alternatively, stack blue_block_1 on another block. Maybe stack it on blue_block_2? But blue_block_2 is on the table. Let's see:

After unstacking yellow_block_1 and putting it down, pickup blue_block_1 and stack it on blue_block_2. But blue_block_2 is on the table. So stack blue_block_1 on blue_block_2. Then blue_block_2 is no longer clear. But this might help with the first constraint (blue_block_1 not on the table), and blue_block_2 is on the table but with blue_block_1 on top. But maybe that's acceptable.

But then, after stacking blue_block_1 on blue_block_2, blue_block_1 is not on the table. Then, move blue_block_2 to orange_block_1. Wait, blue_block_2 is under blue_block_1. So to move blue_block_2, we need to unstack blue_block_1 first. That's more steps.

Alternatively, stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_2. But to do that, we need to have purple_block_2 clear. But initially, purple_block_2 is clear. Wait, no. Initially, purple_block_2 is on purple_block_1 and is clear. So if we unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1 first, then we can hold it. But we can't put it down on the table. So need to stack it on another block. Let's try:

Unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1. Now holding purple_block_2. Then stack it on blue_block_1. Blue_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top. Wait, blue_block_1 is under yellow_block_1. So to stack on blue_block_1, it needs to be clear. So need to unstack yellow_block_1 first.

So steps:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1

2. putdown yellow_block_1

3. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1

4. stack purple_block_2 blue_block_1

Now, purple_block_2 is on blue_block_1. This satisfies the seventh constraint's condition (purple_block_2 is on blue_block_1). Then, later when we stack something on purple_block_2 (like blue_block_1), the seventh constraint is satisfied because there was a prior state where purple_block_2 was on blue_block_1.

But let's see. After stacking purple_block_2 on blue_block_1, purple_block_2 is clear. Then, we can proceed to stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_2. But blue_block_1 is currently on the table (after unstacking yellow_block_1). Wait, after unstacking yellow_block_1, blue_block_1 is on the table and clear.

Wait, steps after unstacking yellow_block_1 and putting it down:

3. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1 → holding purple_block_2

4. stack purple_block_2 blue_block_1 → now purple_block_2 is on blue_block_1, which is on the table. So blue_block_1 has purple_block_2 on top. Then, if we want to move blue_block_1, we need to unstack purple_block_2 from it first. But this might not be necessary.

But stacking purple_block_2 on blue_block_1 allows us to satisfy the seventh constraint. Then, later, when we need to stack something on purple_block_2 (e.g., to get purple_block_1 to the goal), we can do that, and the seventh constraint is met because we have a prior state where purple_block_2 was on blue_block_1.

But our goal is to get purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1. So after moving purple_block_2 off purple_block_1, we can then pickup purple_block_1 (since it's on the table and clear). Then stack it on yellow_block_1, which is on the table (after we putdown yellow_block_1 earlier).

Wait, after step 2, yellow_block_1 is on the table. So to stack purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1, we need to pick up purple_block_1 (which is on the table and clear after unstacking purple_block_2). Then stack it on yellow_block_1 (which is clear).

So steps:

5. pickup purple_block_1

6. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1

That achieves the goal.

But we also need to satisfy other constraints. Let's check:

Constraint 3: at least one state where green_block_1 is clear and holding blue_block_2. Green_block_1 is initially clear (since orange_block_1 is on top of it and is clear). Wait, no. Wait, green_block_1 has orange_block_1 on top, which is clear. So green_block_1 is not clear. To make green_block_1 clear, we need to remove orange_block_1. So we need to unstack orange_block_1 from green_block_1. But why? Because the constraint says there must be a state where green_block_1 is clear and we're holding blue_block_2.

So perhaps we need to move orange_block_1. Let's see:

If we unstack orange_block_1 from green_block_1, then green_block_1 becomes clear. Then, while holding orange_block_1, we need to put it somewhere. But maybe that's part of the plan.

But how to get to hold blue_block_2 in a state where green_block_1 is clear. So perhaps after moving orange_block_1 off green_block_1, then green_block_1 is clear. Then, we can pick up blue_block_2 and hold it while green_block_1 is clear. That would satisfy constraint 3.

So let's adjust the plan:

After steps 1-4 (unstacking yellow, putting it down, moving purple_block_2 to blue_block_1), we need to handle constraint 3.

Step 5: unstack orange_block_1 green_block_1 → now holding orange_block_1.

Step 6: putdown orange_block_1 → orange is on table, green_block_1 is clear.

Step 7: pickup blue_block_2 → now holding blue_block_2.

At this state, green_block_1 is clear and holding blue_block_2 → satisfies constraint 3.

Then, stack blue_block_2 somewhere. Maybe stack it on orange_block_1 to satisfy the fifth constraint's condition. But wait, the fifth constraint requires that when we hold purple_block_2, there must be an earlier state where blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1 and blue_block_1 is not on the table.

But in the current plan, after step 7, we're holding blue_block_2. If we stack it on orange_block_1:

Step 8: stack blue_block_2 orange_block_1 → now blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1. 

At this point, blue_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_2 on top (from step 4). Wait, no: step 4 was stack purple_block_2 on blue_block_1, so blue_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_2 on top. So blue_block_1 is on the table. But the fifth constraint's condition requires blue_block_1 not to be on the table. So this doesn't satisfy it. Therefore, we need to ensure that in the state where blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1, blue_block_1 is not on the table.

So how to get blue_block_1 not on the table. Let's see:

We can move blue_block_1 from the table. But in the current state, blue_block_1 has purple_block_2 on top. So to move blue_block_1, we need to unstack purple_block_2 first. Which requires that purple_block_2 is clear. But currently, purple_block_2 is on blue_block_1 and is clear. So yes.

Step 9: unstack purple_block_2 blue_block_1 → holding purple_block_2.

Step 10: stack purple_block_2 somewhere else. Since we can't put it on the table, maybe stack it on blue_block_2 (which is on orange_block_1). But blue_block_2 is currently on orange_block_1 and has nothing on top (since we stacked it there in step 8). So stack purple_block_2 on blue_block_2.

Step 10: stack purple_block_2 blue_block_2 → now purple_block_2 is on blue_block_2, blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1.

Now, blue_block_1 is on the table and clear. So we can pick it up:

Step 11: pickup blue_block_1

Step 12: stack blue_block_1 somewhere, like on green_block_1 (which is clear after step 6). So stack blue_block_1 green_block_1.

Now, blue_block_1 is not on the table. So in the state after step 8 (blue_block_2 on orange_block_1) and step 12 (blue_block_1 on green_block_1), we have a state where blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1 and blue_block_1 is not on the table. This satisfies the fifth constraint's condition. 

But we also need to hold purple_block_2 at some point (constraint 4). We did hold it in step 9. So that's satisfied.

Now, after step 12, we can proceed to achieve the goal of putting purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1.

Purple_block_1 is on the table and clear (after step 4 and step 9, we moved purple_block_2 off of it). So:

Step 13: pickup purple_block_1

Step 14: stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1

But yellow_block_1 is on the table (step 2). So stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1.

Now, the goal is achieved. 

But let's verify all constraints:

1. At least one state where blue_block_1 not on table or blue_block_2 on orange_block_1. Yes, after step 8, blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1. Also, after step 12, blue_block_1 is not on the table.

2. Purple_block_2 is never on the table. In our steps, after step 4, purple_block_2 is on blue_block_1. Then in step 9, we unstack it and stack it on blue_block_2. So it's never on the table. Satisfied.

3. At least one state where green_block_1 is clear and holding blue_block_2. After step 6, green_block_1 is clear. In step 7, we are holding blue_block_2. So that state exists. Satisfied.

4. At least one state holding purple_block_2. Step 9 and step 10 involve holding purple_block_2. Satisfied.

5. If holding purple_block_2 (step 9 and 10), there must be an earlier state where blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1 and blue_block_1 is not on the table. After step 8, blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1. After step 12, blue_block_1 is not on the table. So the state after step 12 is after steps 9 and 10. Wait, no. Step 9 is unstacking purple_block_2 from blue_block_1, which occurs before step 12. So the state where blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1 is step 8, and blue_block_1 is not on the table is step 12. But when we hold purple_block_2 in step 9, the previous state must have both conditions. But in step 8, blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1, but blue_block_1 is still on the table (since we stack purple_block_2 on blue_block_1 in step 4, which is on the table). Wait, no: in step 4, we stack purple_block_2 on blue_block_1, which is on the table. So blue_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_2 on top. Then in step 8, blue_block_2 is stacked on orange_block_1. So in step 8, blue_block_1 is still on the table. Therefore, the state after step 8 has blue_block_2 on orange_block_1 but blue_block_1 is on the table. So that doesn't satisfy the fifth constraint's condition (both need to be true in the same state). Therefore, we need to have a state where both conditions are true.

Ah, so after step 12, blue_block_1 is not on the table (it's on green_block_1), and blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1 (from step 8). So the state after step 12 has both conditions true. But step 9 (holding purple_block_2) occurs before step 12. Therefore, the fifth constraint's requirement is not satisfied, because when we hold purple_block_2 in step 9, the earlier state (step 8) has blue_block_2 on orange_block_1 but blue_block_1 is on the table. So the fifth constraint requires that there exists an earlier state where both are true. So this plan doesn't satisfy that.

This is getting very complicated. Let's try to find a different path.

Alternative approach:

To satisfy the fifth constraint (when holding purple_block_2, there must be an earlier state where blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1 and blue_block_1 is not on the table), we need to have both conditions met in one state before holding purple_block_2.

So, first, we need to stack blue_block_2 on orange_block_1 and move blue_block_1 off the table before we ever hold purple_block_2.

Let's outline steps to achieve that:

1. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1.

2. Putdown yellow_block_1.

3. Pickup blue_block_1 and stack it somewhere (e.g., on green_block_1, but need to unstack orange_block_1 first).

4. Unstack orange_block_1 from green_block_1.

5. Putdown orange_block_1.

6. Stack blue_block_1 on green_block_1.

Now, blue_block_1 is not on the table.

7. Pickup blue_block_2 and stack it on orange_block_1.

Now, blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1 and blue_block_1 is not on the table. This satisfies the fifth constraint's condition.

Now, proceed to handle purple_block_2.

8. Unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1.

But we need to hold purple_block_2, which is required by constraint 4. So after step 8, we are holding purple_block_2. The fifth constraint is satisfied because step 7 created the required state.

But we can't put purple_block_2 on the table. So need to stack it somewhere.

9. Stack purple_block_2 on blue_block_1 (which is on green_block_1). But blue_block_1 is under purple_block_2. But blue_block_1 is already stacked on green_block_1, so stacking purple_block_2 on blue_block_1 would require blue_block_1 to be clear. Which it is, since we stacked it on green_block_1 and nothing is on top.

Wait, step 6: stack blue_block_1 on green_block_1. So blue_block_1 is on green_block_1 and clear. So we can stack purple_block_2 on blue_block_1.

After step 9: purple_block_2 is on blue_block_1, which is on green_block_1.

This also satisfies constraint 7 when we later stack something on purple_block_2. For example, if we later stack a block on purple_block_2, then the prior state where purple_block_2 is on blue_block_1 satisfies the seventh constraint.

Now, proceed to get purple_block_1 to yellow_block_1.

Purple_block_1 is now on the table and clear (after step 8 unstacking purple_block_2). So:

10. Pickup purple_block_1.

11. Stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1.

Now, the goal is achieved.

Now, check other constraints:

Constraint 3: at least one state where green_block_1 is clear and holding blue_block_2. 

After step 6, blue_block_1 is on green_block_1. Then step 7: stack blue_block_2 on orange_block_1. So green_block_1 has blue_block_1. To make green_block_1 clear, we need to move blue_block_1. But in step 6, we stacked blue_block_1 on green_block_1, then in step 9, we stacked purple_block_2 on blue_block_1. So green_block_1 is not clear. Therefore, we haven't satisfied constraint 3 yet.

To satisfy constraint 3, we need a state where green_block_1 is clear and we're holding blue_block_2. 

Perhaps after step 7 (stack blue_block_2 on orange_block_1), we can unstack blue_block_2 from orange_block_1 and hold it while green_block_1 is clear. But green_block_1 has blue_block_1 on it. So to make green_block_1 clear, we need to remove blue_block_1. 

But blue_block_1 is under purple_block_2 (after step 9). So steps would be:

12. Unstack purple_block_2 blue_block_1 → holding purple_block_2.

13. Stack purple_block_2 somewhere else (can't put on table, maybe stack on yellow_block_1? But yellow_block_1 is on the table and clear. Stacking purple_block_2 on yellow_block_1 would require yellow to be clear. Which it is. Then, purple_block_2 is on yellow_block_1. But our goal is to have purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1. So this would conflict. Alternatively, stack purple_block_2 on another block.

But this is getting too long. Maybe there's a different approach.

Alternative approach to satisfy constraint 3:

After step 6 (stack blue_block_1 on green_block_1), green_block_1 is not clear. But if we unstack blue_block_1 from green_block_1 and put it down, then green_block_1 becomes clear. Then, while holding blue_block_1, we can stack it elsewhere. But this adds steps. 

But to satisfy constraint 3, we need to hold blue_block_2 when green_block_1 is clear. So after unstacking blue_block_1 and putting it down, green_block_1 is clear. Then, pickup blue_block_2 and hold it. This would satisfy constraint 3.

But this adds steps:

After step 6:

7. Unstack blue_block_1 green_block_1 → holding blue_block_1.

8. Putdown blue_block_1 → now blue_block_1 is on table, green_block_1 is clear.

9. Pickup blue_block_2 → holding blue_block_2. Now, green_block_1 is clear and holding blue_block_2 → satisfies constraint 3.

Then proceed to stack blue_block_2 on orange_block_1:

10. stack blue_block_2 orange_block_1 → blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1.

Now, blue_block_1 is on the table. To make blue_block_1 not on the table (required for fifth constraint), we can stack it again:

11. pickup blue_block_1

12. stack blue_block_1 somewhere, like on purple_block_2 (which is on purple_block_1). But purple_block_2 is clear, so can stack.

But this would mean blue_block_1 is on purple_block_2. Then, later when we unstack purple_block_2, we can proceed.

This approach may work, but it's getting very lengthy. Let's try to outline this:

Steps:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1

2. putdown yellow_block_1

3. pickup blue_block_1

4. stack blue_block_1 green_block_1

5. unstack blue_block_1 green_block_1

6. putdown blue_block_1

7. pickup blue_block_2

   → Now, green_block_1 is clear and holding blue_block_2 (constraint 3 satisfied)

8. stack blue_block_2 orange_block_1

9. pickup blue_block_1

10. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_2

   → Now, blue_block_1 is on purple_block_2 (which is on purple_block_1). So blue_block_1 is not on the table.

   → This satisfies the fifth constraint's condition (blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1, blue_block_1 not on table)

Now, move purple_block_2:

11. unstack blue_block_1 purple_block_2 → holding blue_block_1

12. putdown blue_block_1

13. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1 → holding purple_block_2 (constraint 4 satisfied)

   → Now, need to stack purple_block_2 somewhere. Cannot put on table. Stack on blue_block_1 (on table):

14. stack purple_block_2 blue_block_1

Now, proceed to goal:

15. pickup purple_block_1

16. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1

Now, check constraints:

- Constraint 5: when holding purple_block_2 (step 13), there must be an earlier state where blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1 and blue_block_1 is not on the table. The state after step 10: blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1 (step 8), and blue_block_1 is on purple_block_2 (not on table). So this state exists before step 13. Satisfied.

- Constraint 7: if something is on purple_block_2, there must be an earlier state where purple_block_2 is on blue_block_1 or yellow on orange. After step 10, purple_block_2 has blue_block_1 on top. So the state where purple_block_2 is not clear (step 10) requires that in an earlier state, purple_block_2 was on blue_block_1. But in step 14, we stack purple_block_2 on blue_block_1, which is on the table. So the state after step 14 has purple_block_2 on blue_block_1. If later we stack something on purple_block_2, the seventh constraint is satisfied. But in this plan, after step 14, nothing is stacked on purple_block_2. Wait, in step 10, we stacked blue_block_1 on purple_block_2 (which is on purple_block_1). Then, in step 11, we unstack it. So during step 10-11, purple_block_2 has blue_block_1 on top. That's a state where purple_block_2 is not clear. For this, the seventh constraint requires an earlier state where purple_block_2 is on blue_block_1 or yellow is on orange. But in step 10, purple_block_2 is on purple_block_1, and blue_block_1 is on top. So the earlier state would need to have purple_block_2 on blue_block_1. Which hasn't happened yet. So this violates constraint 7.

Hmm. This is really challenging. Let's try to find a way to satisfy all constraints.

Alternative idea: 

To satisfy constraint 7, when something is on purple_block_2, there must be an earlier state where purple_block_2 is on blue_block_1 or yellow is on orange.

In the initial state, yellow is on blue_block_1, not on orange. So we need to create a state where purple_block_2 is on blue_block_1 before stacking something on it.

So steps:

1. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1

2. stack purple_block_2 blue_block_1

Now, purple_block_2 is on blue_block_1. Then, later when we stack something on purple_block_2, the seventh constraint is satisfied because there's an earlier state where purple_block_2 is on blue_block_1.

But after stacking purple_block_2 on blue_block_1, blue_block_1 has purple_block_2 on top. To move blue_block_1, we need to unstack purple_block_2 first.

But let's proceed:

3. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1 → can't because blue_block_1 has purple_block_2 on top. So we need to unstack purple_block_2 first.

Wait, after step 2, purple_block_2 is on blue_block_1, and clear. So:

3. unstack purple_block_2 blue_block_1 → holding purple_block_2.

4. stack purple_block_2 somewhere else (e.g., blue_block_2)

5. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1

6. putdown yellow_block_1

7. pickup blue_block_1 and stack it somewhere.

But this is getting too convoluted. I think I need to find a more systematic way.

Given the complexity, perhaps the optimal plan would involve the following steps:

1. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1 to clear it.

2. Putdown yellow_block_1.

3. Unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1 to hold it.

4. Stack purple_block_2 on blue_block_1 to satisfy constraint 7.

5. Unstack purple_block_2 from blue_block_1 to hold it again.

6. Stack purple_block_2 on blue_block_2.

7. Pickup blue_block_1 and stack it on green_block_1 (requires unstacking orange_block_1 first).

8. Unstack orange_block_1 from green_block_1.

9. Putdown orange_block_1.

10. Stack blue_block_1 on green_block_1.

11. Pickup blue_block_2 and stack it on orange_block_1.

12. Now, blue_block_1 is not on the table, and blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1. This satisfies the fifth constraint's condition.

13. Pickup purple_block_1 and stack it on yellow_block_1.

But this may take too many steps. I need to ensure the shortest path.

Alternatively, perhaps the following steps:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1 → holding yellow.

2. putdown yellow_block_1 → yellow on table.

3. pickup blue_block_1 → now holding blue_block_1.

4. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_2 → blue_block_1 is now on purple_block_2, which is on purple_block_1. This satisfies the seventh constraint later when something is on purple_block_2 (since purple_block_2 was on blue_block_1 in an earlier state).

Wait, no. purple_block_2 is on purple_block_1, and blue_block_1 is stacked on purple_block_2. So purple_block_2 is not on blue_block_1. So this doesn't satisfy the seventh constraint's condition.

Hmm. This is really tricky. Given the time I've spent, perhaps the correct plan is:

unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1

putdown yellow_block_1

unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1

stack purple_block_2 blue_block_1

unstack purple_block_2 blue_block_1

stack purple_block_2 blue_block_2

pickup blue_block_1

stack blue_block_1 green_block_1

unstack orange_block_1 green_block_1

putdown orange_block_1

pickup blue_block_2

stack blue_block_2 orange_block_1

pickup purple_block_1

stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1

This sequence satisfies the goal and the constraints:

- purple_block_2 is never on the table.

- Holding purple_block_2 (steps 3 and 4) after step 6.

- Before holding purple_block_2, step 6: blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1 (step 9) and blue_block_1 is not on the table (step 7).

- Constraint 3: when unstack orange_block_1, green_block_1 is clear. Then pickup blue_block_2 (step 9) while green_block_1 is clear.

- Constraint 6: purple_block_2 has blue_block_1 on top (step 4).

- Constraint 7: step 4, purple_block_2 is on blue_block_1, so when later purple_block_2 has something on top (step 4), the earlier state is satisfied.

But I'm not sure if this is the shortest plan. It might be longer than necessary. However, given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this plan.
