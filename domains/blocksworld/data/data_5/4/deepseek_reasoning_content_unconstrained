Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to get purple_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1. The initial state has purple_block_1 on the table with purple_block_2 on top of it. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the original state says "purple_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1" so purple_block_1 is under purple_block_2. So purple_block_1 is on the table, and purple_block_2 is on top of it, right? Because the initial state says purple_block_1 is on the table. So purple_block_1 has purple_block_2 on it, making purple_block_1 not clear. But the problem states that "there is no block on top of purple_block_2", so purple_block_2 is clear. So the current setup is purple_block_1 (on table) with purple_block_2 on top, and purple_block_2 is clear.

The goal is to have purple_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1. So purple_block_1 needs to be moved. But right now, purple_block_1 is under purple_block_2. To move purple_block_1, I first need to clear it by moving purple_block_2 somewhere else.

So first, I need to unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1. Wait, but to unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1, the preconditions are that purple_block_2 is on purple_block_1, which it is, and that purple_block_2 is clear, which it is. Also, the robotic arm isn't holding anything. So that's possible. So unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1. That would make the robotic arm hold purple_block_2, and purple_block_1 becomes clear.

Then, after that, I can pick up purple_block_1. Because once purple_block_2 is removed, purple_block_1 is on the table and clear. So then, I can do pickup purple_block_1. But wait, the initial state says purple_block_1 is on the table. So after unstacking purple_block_2, purple_block_1 is still on the table and clear. So yes, then pickup purple_block_1. Then I need to stack it on yellow_block_1. But where is yellow_block_1 now? The initial state says yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1. So blue_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top. So yellow_block_1 is clear. So to stack purple_block_1 onto yellow_block_1, I need to have the arm holding purple_block_1, and yellow_block_1 must be clear. Which it is. So after picking up purple_block_1, stack it on yellow_block_1. That would achieve the goal.

But wait, after unstacking purple_block_2, the arm is holding it. So after unstack, I need to put down purple_block_2 somewhere so that I can then pick up purple_block_1. Because the arm can only hold one block at a time. So the steps would be:

1. Unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1. Now the arm is holding purple_block_2.
2. Putdown purple_block_2 on the table. Now purple_block_2 is on the table, clear, and the arm is empty.
3. Pickup purple_block_1. Since it's now clear and on the table.
4. Stack purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1. Which is clear.

That seems straightforward. But let's check the preconditions each step.

Step 1: unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1. Preconditions: purple_block_2 is on purple_block_1 (yes), purple_block_2 is clear (yes, initial state says it's clear), arm is empty (yes). So this is allowed. After this, the arm holds purple_block_2, and purple_block_1 is clear.

Step 2: putdown purple_block_2. Precondition: holding purple_block_2. Yes. So put it on the table. Now purple_block_2 is on table, clear, arm is empty.

Step 3: pickup purple_block_1. Preconditions: it's on table (yes), clear (yes, after step 1), arm is empty (yes). So this works.

Step 4: stack purple_block_1 onto yellow_block_1. Preconditions: holding purple_block_1 (yes), yellow_block_1 is clear (yes, initial state says yellow_block_1 is clear and nothing has changed that, since we moved purple_block_2 but that doesn't affect yellow_block_1). So stacking here is allowed. After stacking, purple_block_1 is on yellow_block_1, which is the goal.

So the plan is four steps. Is there a way to do it in fewer steps? Let's think. Maybe after unstacking purple_block_2, instead of putting it down, can we stack it somewhere else? But where? The goal is to get purple_block_1 onto yellow_block_1. Maybe if after unstacking purple_block_2, we put it on the table (putdown), then proceed. But that's the same as before. Alternatively, perhaps stack purple_block_2 onto another block. But that might complicate things. For example, if there's a block that is clear. Let's see. The other blocks: green_block_1 has orange_block_1 on top. blue_block_1 has yellow_block_1. purple_block_1 is now clear (after unstack), orange_block_1 is clear, yellow_block_1 is clear, blue_block_2 is clear. So if after unstacking purple_block_2, we can stack it on blue_block_2. But blue_block_2 is clear. So stack purple_block_2 on blue_block_2. Then, purple_block_2 would be on blue_block_2, and the arm is free. Then we can proceed to pick up purple_block_1. But the problem is that stacking purple_block_2 on blue_block_2 would take an extra step (stack instead of putdown). Then the steps would be:

1. Unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1. (arm holds it)
2. Stack purple_block_2 on blue_block_2. (requires blue_block_2 is clear, which it is)
3. Pickup purple_block_1.
4. Stack purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1.

That's four steps as well. Same length. But maybe that's another valid plan. But does that affect anything else? Not necessarily. The problem doesn't require other blocks to stay in place, as long as the goal is achieved. So both plans are four steps. So the optimal plan is four steps. So the plan I outlined first is acceptable. But let's check again.

Wait, in the initial state, blue_block_2 is on the table and clear. So in the alternative plan, after step 2, blue_block_2 has purple_block_2 on top. But that's allowed. Then steps 3 and 4 proceed. But since the goal is only about purple_block_1 and yellow_block_1, that's acceptable.

But since the problem says "an optimal plan, i.e., a valid plan whose length is equal or less than the length of any other valid plan", and both options are four steps, both are optimal. So either plan is acceptable.

But the original plan with putdown is perhaps simpler, but same length. So either way, the answer is four steps.

But let's make sure there's no shorter way. For example, can we avoid putting down purple_block_2? Let's see. Suppose after unstacking purple_block_2 (step 1), then we need to pick up purple_block_1. But at that point, the arm is holding purple_block_2. So we can't pick up purple_block_1 unless we putdown or stack purple_block_2 first. So steps 1 and 2 are necessary. Then steps 3 and 4. So four steps in total. No way to do it in fewer steps. Because each action moves one block, and the problem requires moving two blocks (purple_block_2 and purple_block_1). Each move is a separate action. So four steps is the minimum.

Therefore, the plan is:

unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1

putdown purple_block_2

pickup purple_block_1

stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1

Alternatively, using stack instead of putdown:

unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1

stack purple_block_2 blue_block_2

pickup purple_block_1

stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1

Either is correct. But the first option might be better if putting on the table is quicker, but since the problem doesn't specify any preference, both are acceptable. Let's go with the first one for simplicity.
