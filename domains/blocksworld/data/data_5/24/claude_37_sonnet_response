Let's analyze the problem.

Initial State:
- brown_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_2 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2
- black_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
- black_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
- black_block_2 is clear
- black_block_3 is clear
- grey_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Goal State:
- you are holding black_block_3

Constraints:
1. black_block_3 must not be on top of brown_block_1 in at least one state, and before this happens, brown_block_2 must be held at least once.
2. green_block_1 must not be on top of green_block_1 in at least one state, and after this happens, either you are holding black_block_1 or green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1.
3. In at least one state, either green_block_1 is clear or brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_1.
4. black_block_3 must not be on top of black_block_1 in at least one state, and after this happens, either brown_block_2 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear.
5. brown_block_1 must be clear in at least one state, and before this happens, black_block_2 must be on top of green_block_1.

To achieve the goal, we need to perform "unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1". But we need to satisfy the constraints.

Let's think about the constraints one by one:

1. This is satisfied when we unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1, but before that we need to hold brown_block_2 at least once.

2. This constraint actually doesn't apply in the initial state, as green_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2, not on top of itself. So "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" holds trivially in every state.

3. We need to make either green_block_1 clear or brown_block_1 on top of black_block_1. In the initial state, grey_block_1 is on top of green_block_1, so green_block_1 is not clear. And brown_block_1 is on the table, not on top of black_block_1.

4. black_block_3 is not on top of black_block_1 in the initial state, so this constraint is satisfied. We just need to ensure that at some point, either brown_block_2 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear.

5. brown_block_1 is not clear in the initial state, so for it to become clear, we need to unstack black_block_3 from it. But before we can do that, we need to ensure that black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1 at some point.

Now, let's try to satisfy all these constraints and reach the goal:

First, we need to make black_block_2 on top of green_block_1 (Constraint 5). To do this:
- We need to unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1.
- We need to unstack grey_block_1 from green_block_1.
- Then stack black_block_2 on green_block_1.

After that, we can unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1, satisfying Constraint 5 (brown_block_1 is clear) and moving towards our goal.

But we also need to ensure that we hold brown_block_2 at some point (Constraint 1). To do this, we'll need to:
- Unstack grey_block_1 from green_block_1.
- Unstack green_block_1 from brown_block_2.
- Pickup brown_block_2 from the table.

Let's try to integrate all these steps and check if they can satisfy all the constraints.

Actually, I realize that we need to be more careful about the ordering. Let's think step by step:

1. First, we need to hold brown_block_2 (for Constraint 1):
   - But to do that, we need to remove green_block_1 and grey_block_1 first.
   - "unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1"
   - "putdown grey_block_1"
   - "unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2"
   - "putdown green_block_1"
   - "pickup brown_block_2"
   - "putdown brown_block_2"

2. Then, we need to make black_block_2 on top of green_block_1 (for Constraint 5):
   - "unstack black_block_2 black_block_1"
   - "stack black_block_2 green_block_1"

3. Now, we can unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1:
   - "unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1"

And we're done! Let's validate this:

- Constraint 1: After we unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1, it's no longer on top of brown_block_1. And before this, we held brown_block_2.
- Constraint 2: green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1 throughout.
- Constraint 3: After we remove grey_block_1 from green_block_1, green_block_1 is clear.
- Constraint 4: black_block_3 is not on top of black_block_1 throughout. And after removing black_block_3 from brown_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear, which doesn't satisfy the condition that "brown_block_2 is not on the table" or "brown_block_1 is not clear". This is a problem.
- Constraint 5: After we unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear. And before this, black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1.

The issue is with Constraint 4. After we unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1, we need to ensure that either brown_block_2 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear. But at that point, brown_block_2 would be on the table and brown_block_1 would be clear.

Let's adjust our plan:

1. First, we need to hold brown_block_2 (for Constraint 1):
   - "unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1"
   - "putdown grey_block_1"
   - "unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2"
   - "putdown green_block_1"
   - "pickup brown_block_2"
   - "putdown brown_block_2"

2. Then, we need to make black_block_2 on top of green_block_1 (for Constraint 5):
   - "unstack black_block_2 black_block_1"
   - "stack black_block_2 green_block_1"

3. Now, we can unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1:
   - "unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1"

4. Stack brown_block_2 on top of black_block_1 so it's no longer on the table (for Constraint 4):
   - "pickup brown_block_2"
   - "stack brown_block_2 black_block_1"

Now let's check:

- Constraint 1: After we unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1, it's no longer on top of brown_block_1. And before this, we held brown_block_2.
- Constraint 2: green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1 throughout.
- Constraint 3: After we remove grey_block_1 from green_block_1, green_block_1 is clear.
- Constraint 4: black_block_3 is not on top of black_block_1 throughout. After we unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1, we put brown_block_2 on top of black_block_1, so brown_block_2 is no longer on the table.
- Constraint 5: After we unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear. And before this, black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1.

This looks good, but I realized a mistake: After we unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1, we're holding black_block_3 and can't immediately pickup brown_block_2. 

Let's try a slightly different plan:

1. First, we need to hold brown_block_2 (for Constraint 1):
   - "unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1"
   - "putdown grey_block_1"
   - "unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2"
   - "putdown green_block_1"
   - "pickup brown_block_2"
   - "putdown brown_block_2"

2. Then, we need to make black_block_2 on top of green_block_1 (for Constraint 5):
   - "unstack black_block_2 black_block_1"
   - "stack black_block_2 green_block_1"

3. Now, we need to ensure that brown_block_2 is not on the table (for Constraint 4):
   - "pickup brown_block_2"
   - "stack brown_block_2 black_block_1"

4. Finally, we can unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1:
   - "unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1"

Now let's validate:

- Constraint 1: After we unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1, it's no longer on top of brown_block_1. And before this, we held brown_block_2.
- Constraint 2: green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1 throughout. The constraint says if this holds, we need to ensure "you are holding black_block_1 or green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" at the same or a later state. We don't satisfy this currently.
- Constraint 3: After we remove grey_block_1 from green_block_1, green_block_1 is clear.
- Constraint 4: black_block_3 is not on top of black_block_1 throughout. And after we make this true, brown_block_2 is not on the table.
- Constraint 5: After we unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear. And before this, black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1.

We have an issue with Constraint 2. Let's go back to the initial state, and pay special attention to the constraint.

Constraint 2: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1". If expression "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" holds in some state s, then expression "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding black_block_1", "green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1"" must hold at s or at some state after s."

I misunderstood this constraint. It's a tautology to say "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" as it can't be on top of itself in any valid state. So this constraint simplifies to ensuring that at some point, either we're holding black_block_1 or green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1.

Let's adjust our plan once more to account for this:

1. First, we need to hold brown_block_2 (for Constraint 1):
   - "unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1"
   - "putdown grey_block_1"
   - "unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2"
   - "putdown green_block_1"
   - "pickup brown_block_2"
   - "putdown brown_block_2"

2. We need to ensure either we hold black_block_1 or green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1 (for Constraint 2):
   - "unstack black_block_2 black_block_1"
   - "putdown black_block_2"
   - "pickup green_block_1"
   - "stack green_block_1 black_block_1"

3. Then, we need to make black_block_2 on top of green_block_1 (for Constraint 5):
   - "pickup black_block_2"
   - "stack black_block_2 green_block_1"

4. Now, we need to ensure that brown_block_2 is not on the table (for Constraint 4):
   - "pickup brown_block_2"
   - "stack brown_block_2 grey_block_1"  # Let's put it on grey_block_1 to avoid creating towers too high

5. Finally, we can unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1:
   - "unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1"

And we're done!

Actually, let's double-check if brown_block_1 being clear after we unstack black_block_3 goes against Constraint 4. The constraint says if "black_block_3 is not on top of black_block_1" holds in some state s, then at s or a later state, either "brown_block_2 is not on the table" or "brown_block_1 is not clear" must hold.

In our plan, after we unstack black_block_3, brown_block_1 is clear and black_block_3 is not on top of black_block_1. But we also ensure that brown_block_2 is not on the table, so the constraint is satisfied.

Let's trace through the final plan step by step and ensure all constraints are met:

1. Initial state:
   - brown_block_1 on the table with black_block_3 on top
   - brown_block_2 on the table with green_block_1 on top and grey_block_1 on top of that
   - black_block_1 on the table with black_block_2 on top

2. unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1:
   - grey_block_1 is held by the robot
   - green_block_1 is clear
   - Constraint 3 is satisfied: green_block_1 is clear

3. putdown grey_block_1:
   - grey_block_1 is on the table and clear

4. unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2:
   - green_block_1 is held by the robot
   - brown_block_2 is clear

5. putdown green_block_1:
   - green_block_1 is on the table and clear

6. pickup brown_block_2:
   - brown_block_2 is held by the robot
   - Note: This is needed for Constraint 1

7. putdown brown_block_2:
   - brown_block_2 is on the table and clear

8. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1:
   - black_block_2 is held by the robot
   - black_block_1 is clear

9. putdown black_block_2:
   - black_block_2 is on the table and clear

10. pickup green_block_1:
    - green_block_1 is held by the robot

11. stack green_block_1 black_block_1:
    - green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
    - Constraint 2 is satisfied: green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1

12. pickup black_block_2:
    - black_block_2 is held by the robot

13. stack black_block_2 green_block_1:
    - black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
    - This is needed for Constraint 5

14. pickup brown_block_2:
    - brown_block_2 is held by the robot

15. stack brown_block_2 grey_block_1:
    - brown_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1 (no longer on the table)
    - This is to satisfy Constraint 4

16. unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1:
    - black_block_3 is held by the robot
    - brown_block_1 is clear
    - Constraint 1 is satisfied: black_block_3 is no longer on top of brown_block_1, and previously, we've held brown_block_2.
    - Constraint 4 is satisfied: black_block_3 is not on top of black_block_1 and brown_block_2 is not on the table.
    - Constraint 5 is satisfied: brown_block_1 is clear, and previously, black_block_2 was on top of green_block_1.

All constraints are met and we've reached the goal state of holding black_block_3.

Actually, I just realized we're doing redundant steps. Let's simplify our plan:

1. "unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1"
2. "putdown grey_block_1"
3. "unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2"
4. "putdown green_block_1"
5. "pickup brown_block_2"  # This is needed for Constraint 1
6. "stack brown_block_2 grey_block_1"  # This is to satisfy Constraint 4, ensuring brown_block_2 is not on the table
7. "unstack black_block_2 black_block_1"
8. "stack black_block_2 green_block_1"  # This is needed for Constraint 5
9. "pickup black_block_1"  # This is to satisfy Constraint 2, ensuring we're holding black_block_1
10. "putdown black_block_1"
11. "unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1"  # Goal state: holding black_block_3

Actually, I just noticed there's another subtle issue. To satisfy Constraint 5, before brown_block_1 is clear, black_block_2 should be on top of green_block_1. In our plan, we first satisfy Constraint 4 by stacking brown_block_2 on grey_block_1, and then we put black_block_2 on green_block_1, and finally, we unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1 which makes brown_block_1 clear.

So at this point, Constraint 5 would be: "brown_block_1 is clear and before this, black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1." This is satisfied in our plan.

And we need to pickup black_block_1 (for Constraint 2) before unstacking black_block_3 from brown_block_1.

Let's double-check this one more time:

- Constraint 1: black_block_3 must not be on top of brown_block_1 in at least one state, and before this happens, brown_block_2 must be held at least once.
  - We satisfy this by first holding brown_block_2 (step 5) and then unstacking black_block_3 from brown_block_1 (step 11).

- Constraint 2: green_block_1 must not be on top of green_block_1 in at least one state, and after this happens, either you are holding black_block_1 or green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1.
  - We satisfy this by ensuring we hold black_block_1 (step 9).

- Constraint 3: In at least one state, either green_block_1 is clear or brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_1.
  - We satisfy this by making green_block_1 clear (after step 2).

- Constraint 4: black_block_3 must not be on top of black_block_1 in at least one state, and after this happens, either brown_block_2 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear.
  - We satisfy this by ensuring brown_block_2 is not on the table (it's on grey_block_1 after step 6).

- Constraint 5: brown_block_1 must be clear in at least one state, and before this happens, black_block_2 must be on top of green_block_1.
  - We satisfy this by first putting black_block_2 on green_block_1 (step 8) and then making brown_block_1 clear (step 11).

And the goal is to hold black_block_3, which we achieve in step 11.

So the plan seems solid now. Let's review it once more:

1. "unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1"
2. "putdown grey_block_1"
3. "unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2"
4. "putdown green_block_1"
5. "pickup brown_block_2"  # This is needed for Constraint 1
6. "stack brown_block_2 grey_block_1"  # This is to satisfy Constraint 4, ensuring brown_block_2 is not on the table
7. "unstack black_block_2 black_block_1"
8. "stack black_block_2 green_block_1"  # This is needed for Constraint 5
9. "pickup black_block_1"  # This is to satisfy Constraint 2, ensuring we're holding black_block_1
10. "putdown black_block_1"
11. "unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1"  # Goal state: holding black_block_3

I think I overcomplicated the solution. Once more, let me redo the thought process to make sure this is the most straightforward solution:

Initial setup:
```
   grey_block_1
   green_block_1     black_block_3    black_block_2
   brown_block_2     brown_block_1    black_block_1
   ------------------------------------------
                    TABLE
```

I want to unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1, but I need to satisfy all the constraints:

1. Before I unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1, I must have held brown_block_2.
   - I need to remove grey_block_1 and green_block_1 first.
   - "unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1", "putdown grey_block_1"
   - "unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2", "putdown green_block_1"
   - "pickup brown_block_2"

2. After I unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1, either brown_block_2 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear.
   - I need to put brown_block_2 somewhere other than the table.
   - "stack brown_block_2 grey_block_1"

3. Before brown_block_1 is clear, black_block_2 must be on top of green_block_1.
   - I need to move black_block_2 from black_block_1 to green_block_1.
   - "unstack black_block_2 black_block_1"
   - "stack black_block_2 green_block_1"

4. At some point, I need to hold black_block_1 or put green_block_1 on top of black_block_1.
   - "pickup black_block_1", "putdown black_block_1"

5. At some point, I need to make green_block_1 clear or put brown_block_1 on top of black_block_1.
   - The first step of unstacking grey_block_1 from green_block_1 makes green_block_1 clear.

Now I can unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1:
"unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1"

So my plan is:
```
unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2
putdown green_block_1
pickup brown_block_2
stack brown_block_2 grey_block_1
unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
stack black_block_2 green_block_1
pickup black_block_1
putdown black_block_1
unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1
```

This should satisfy all constraints and achieve the goal.

Let me verify once more:

1. Before unstacking black_block_3 from brown_block_1, I've held brown_block_2.
2. When I unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1, brown_block_2 is not on the table.
3. Before brown_block_1 is clear, black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1.
4. I've held black_block_1 at some point.
5. green_block_1 is clear after I unstack grey_block_1.

And the goal is to hold black_block_3, which I achieve in the last step.

The plan is correct and satisfies all constraints.

Wait, let me think again. For Constraint 5, it says "before brown_block_1 is clear, black_block_2 must be on top of green_block_1". brown_block_1 becomes clear after I unstack black_block_3, so indeed, black_block_2 must be on top of green_block_1 before I unstack black_block_3. In my plan, I stack black_block_2 on green_block_1 before I unstack black_block_3, so this is correct.

I'm starting to overly verify, but the plan should be correct.

1. "unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1"
2. "putdown grey_block_1"
3. "unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2"
4. "putdown green_block_1"
5. "pickup brown_block_2"
6. "stack brown_block_2 grey_block_1"
7. "unstack black_block_2 black_block_1"
8. "stack black_block_2 green_block_1"
9. "pickup black_block_1"
10. "putdown black_block_1"
11. "unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1"

Let's double-check if this is indeed the optimal plan. The goal is to unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1. But to do this optimally while satisfying all constraints, we need to:

1. Remove blocks from on top of brown_block_2 so we can pick it up (Constraint 1).
2. Pick up brown_block_2 and place it somewhere other than the table (Constraint 4).
3. Move black_block_2 onto green_block_1 (Constraint 5).
4. Pick up black_block_1 (Constraint 2).
5. Unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1.

The steps in our plan are doing exactly these things, and I don't see a way to further optimize or reduce the number of steps. So I believe our plan is optimal.

Let me check if each step is valid according to the problem's action preconditions and effects:

1. "unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1"
   - grey_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 (true in initial state)
   - grey_block_1 is clear (true in initial state)
   - not holding any block (true in initial state)
   Result: holding grey_block_1, green_block_1 is clear

2. "putdown grey_block_1"
   - holding grey_block_1 (true after step 1)
   Result: grey_block_1 is on table, grey_block_1 is clear, not holding any block

3. "unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2"
   - green_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2 (true in initial state)
   - green_block_1 is clear (true after step 1)
   - not holding any block (true after step 2)
   Result: holding green_block_1, brown_block_2 is clear

4. "putdown green_block_1"
   - holding green_block_1 (true after step 3)
   Result: green_block_1 is on table, green_block_1 is clear, not holding any block

5. "pickup brown_block_2"
   - brown_block_2 is clear (true after step 3)
   - brown_block_2 is on table (true in initial state)
   - not holding any block (true after step 4)
   Result: holding brown_block_2, brown_block_2 is not on table

6. "stack brown_block_2 grey_block_1"
   - holding brown_block_2 (true after step 5)
   - grey_block_1 is clear (true after step 2)
   Result: brown_block_2 on top of grey_block_1, brown_block_2 is clear, not holding any block

7. "unstack black_block_2 black_block_1"
   - black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 (true in initial state)
   - black_block_2 is clear (true in initial state)
   - not holding any block (true after step 6)
   Result: holding black_block_2, black_block_1 is clear

8. "stack black_block_2 green_block_1"
   - holding black_block_2 (true after step 7)
   - green_block_1 is clear (true after step 4)
   Result: black_block_2 on top of green_block_1, black_block_2 is clear, not holding any block

9. "pickup black_block_1"
   - black_block_1 is clear (true after step 7)
   - black_block_1 is on table (true in initial state)
   - not holding any block (true after step 8)
   Result: holding black_block_1, black_block_1 is not on table

10. "putdown black_block_1"
   - holding black_block_1 (true after step 9)
   Result: black_block_1 is on table, black_block_1 is clear, not holding any block

11. "unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1"
   - black_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1 (true in initial state)
   - black_block_3 is clear (true in initial state)
   - not holding any block (true after step 10)
   Result: holding black_block_3, brown_block_1 is clear

All actions are valid according to the preconditions and effects.

Let's double-check that the constraints are satisfied:

1. "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1" must hold at some point, and before this, "you are holding brown_block_2" must be true.
   - I hold brown_block_2 in step 5.
   - black_block_3 is removed from brown_block_1 in step 11.

2. "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" must hold at some point, and after this, either "you are holding black_block_1" or "green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" must be true.
   - green_block_1 is never on top of itself.
   - I hold black_block_1 in step 9.

3. Either "green_block_1 is clear" or "brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" must hold at some point.
   - green_block_1 is clear after step 1.

4. "black_block_3 is not on top of black_block_1" must hold at some point, and after this, either "brown_block_2 is not on the table" or "brown_block_1 is not clear" must be true.
   - black_block_3 is not on top of black_block_1 in the initial state.
   - brown_block_2 is not on the table after step 5.

5. "brown_block_1 is clear" must hold at some point, and before this, "black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" must be true.
   - black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1 after step 8.
   - brown_block_1 is clear after step 11.

All constraints are satisfied.

Lastly, to minimize the plan length (optimization goal), I don't see any steps that can be avoided or combined. Every step is necessary to satisfy the constraints and achieve the goal.

So, the optimal plan is:

1. unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
2. putdown grey_block_1
3. unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2
4. putdown green_block_1
5. pickup brown_block_2
6. stack brown_block_2 grey_block_1
7. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
8. stack black_block_2 green_block_1
9. pickup black_block_1
10. putdown black_block_1
11. unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1
