Let's break down this planning problem in Blocksworld. 

First, let's understand the current state of the world.

Initial state:
- `black_block_1` is on the table
- `black_block_2` is on top of `black_block_1`
- `green_block_1` is on top of `black_block_2`
- `green_block_2` is on top of `green_block_1`
- `purple_block_1` is on top of `green_block_2`
- `white_block_1` is on top of `purple_block_1`
- `white_block_2` is on top of `white_block_1`
- `white_block_2` is clear
- The arm is not holding any block.

Visually, the initial state looks like this:
```
       white_block_2
       white_block_1
       purple_block_1
       green_block_2
       green_block_1
       black_block_2
       black_block_1
--------------------------
         table
```

Goal state:
- `black_block_2` is on top of `green_block_1`

Constraints:
1. At some point, `green_block_1` must be on the table.
2. If `green_block_1` is on the table, then at some earlier point, `black_block_1` must have been on top of `green_block_1`.
3. At some point, either the arm is holding `black_block_1` or `black_block_2` is on top of `white_block_2`.
4. At some point, both the arm is holding `black_block_1` and `purple_block_1` is on top of `green_block_1`.
5. At some point, the arm is holding `black_block_2`.
6. If the arm is holding `black_block_2` at some state s, then at state s or some state after s, either the arm is holding `black_block_1` or `purple_block_1` is not clear.
7. At some point, `white_block_1` is not on top of `white_block_2`.
8. If `white_block_1` is not on top of `white_block_2` at some state s, then at state s or some state after s, either `green_block_2` is on top of `green_block_1` or `white_block_1` is on top of `black_block_1`.

Let's first think about the goal and how to achieve it. 

The goal is to get `black_block_2` on top of `green_block_1`. To do this, we need to make sure both blocks are clear and `black_block_2` is not on top of `green_block_1`. Then, we can unstack the blocks on top, pick up `black_block_2`, and stack it on `green_block_1`.

Let's consider the constraints:

1. We need to get `green_block_1` on the table at some point. This means we'll have to dismantle the tower to get `green_block_1` free and place it on the table.
2. Before we put `green_block_1` on the table, we need to ensure that, at some point, `black_block_1` is on top of `green_block_1`. This means that during our dismantling process, we need to place `black_block_1` on top of `green_block_1` before placing `green_block_1` on the table.
3. At some point, we need to either hold `black_block_1` or place `black_block_2` on top of `white_block_2`. We'll be holding `black_block_1` at some point due to (2), so this constraint is satisfied.
4. At some point, we need to hold `black_block_1` and simultaneously have `purple_block_1` on top of `green_block_1`. This might require specific stacking.
5. At some point, we need to hold `black_block_2`. We'll definitely be doing this to achieve the goal, so this constraint is satisfied.
6. If we're holding `black_block_2`, then at that point or later, we need to either hold `black_block_1` or have `purple_block_1` not be clear.
7. At some point, `white_block_1` should not be on top of `white_block_2`. This means we need to dismantle the tower at least to that level.
8. If `white_block_1` is not on top of `white_block_2`, then at that point or later, either `green_block_2` should be on top of `green_block_1` or `white_block_1` should be on top of `black_block_1`.

Let's first try to find a sequence of actions to achieve the goal and ensure all the constraints are met.

First of all, we need to dismantle the tower and restructure it to meet the constraints:

1. Unstack `white_block_2` from `white_block_1`
2. Put `white_block_2` on the table
3. Unstack `white_block_1` from `purple_block_1`
4. Stack `white_block_1` on `black_block_1` (satisfying (8))
5. Unstack `purple_block_1` from `green_block_2`
6. Stack `purple_block_1` on `green_block_1` (satisfying (4) once we pick up `black_block_1`)
7. Unstack `green_block_2` from `green_block_1`
8. Put `green_block_2` on the table
9. Unstack `green_block_1` from `black_block_2`
10. Unstack `black_block_2` from `black_block_1`
11. Put `black_block_2` on the table
12. Unstack `white_block_1` from `black_block_1`
13. Put `white_block_1` on the table
14. Pick up `black_block_1`
15. Stack `black_block_1` on `green_block_1` (satisfying (2))
16. Unstack `black_block_1` from `green_block_1`
17. Put `black_block_1` on the table
18. Unstack `purple_block_1` from `green_block_1`
19. Put `purple_block_1` on the table
20. Put `green_block_1` on the table (satisfying (1))
21. Pick up `black_block_2` (satisfying (5))
22. Stack `black_block_2` on `green_block_1` (satisfying the goal)

However, there's a timing issue in the above plan. At step 21, we pick up `black_block_2` and constraint (6) says that we then need to either hold `black_block_1` or have `purple_block_1` not be clear. But after step 21, we don't hold `black_block_1` and `purple_block_1` is clear (it's on the table).

Let's adjust the plan:
First, I think I missed constraint (4) a bit. It states that at some point we need to both hold `black_block_1` and have `purple_block_1` on top of `green_block_1`. This means we need to have a state where both are true at the same time.

Let's rework the plan:

1. Unstack `white_block_2` from `white_block_1`
2. Put `white_block_2` on the table
3. Unstack `white_block_1` from `purple_block_1`
4. Stack `white_block_1` on `black_block_1` (satisfying (8))
5. Unstack `purple_block_1` from `green_block_2`
6. Stack `purple_block_1` on `green_block_1`
7. Unstack `green_block_2` from `green_block_1`
8. Put `green_block_2` on the table
9. Unstack `white_block_1` from `black_block_1`
10. Put `white_block_1` on the table
11. Pick up `black_block_1` (now we're holding `black_block_1` and `purple_block_1` is on top of `green_block_1`, satisfying (4))
12. Unstack `green_block_1` from `black_block_2`
13. Stack `black_block_1` on `green_block_1` (satisfying (2))
14. Unstack `black_block_1` from `green_block_1`
15. Put `black_block_1` on the table
16. Unstack `purple_block_1` from `green_block_1`
17. Stack `purple_block_1` on `black_block_1` (making `purple_block_1` not clear for later)
18. Put `green_block_1` on the table (satisfying (1))
19. Pick up `black_block_2` (satisfying (5)) (also, since `purple_block_1` is not clear because we put it on top of `black_block_1`, constraint (6) is satisfied)
20. Stack `black_block_2` on `green_block_1` (satisfying the goal)

Actually, thinking about constraint (3) and (6) again:

(3) At some point, either we're holding `black_block_1` or `black_block_2` is on top of `white_block_2`.
(6) If we're holding `black_block_2`, then at that point or later, we need to either hold `black_block_1` or have `purple_block_1` not be clear.

Let's modify our plan again:

1. Unstack `white_block_2` from `white_block_1`
2. Put `white_block_2` on the table
3. Unstack `white_block_1` from `purple_block_1`
4. Stack `white_block_1` on `black_block_1` (satisfying (8))
5. Unstack `purple_block_1` from `green_block_2`
6. Stack `purple_block_1` on `green_block_1`
7. Unstack `green_block_2` from `green_block_1`
8. Put `green_block_2` on the table
9. Unstack `white_block_1` from `black_block_1`
10. Stack `white_block_1` on `purple_block_1` (making `purple_block_1` not clear for later)
11. Unstack `green_block_1` from `black_block_2`
12. Put `green_block_1` on the table (satisfying (1), possibly a bit early but we'll address (2) separately)
13. Unstack `black_block_2` from `black_block_1`
14. Stack `black_block_2` on `white_block_2` (satisfying (3))
15. Pick up `black_block_1`
16. Stack `black_block_1` on `green_block_1` (satisfying (2))
17. Unstack `black_block_1` from `green_block_1`
18. Stack `black_block_1` on top of another block or put it on the table, it doesn't matter
19. Unstack `black_block_2` from `white_block_2`
20. Stack `black_block_2` on `green_block_1` (satisfying the goal)

Hmm, OK. Looking back at constraint (4) and (3), I'm missing some key points. Let me rethink the plan.

I think I'm overcomplicating. Let's just ensure we're meeting each constraint with a few key steps, and then devise a plan around them.

Let's denote the states as S0, S1, S2, ..., where S0 is the initial state.
We want to satisfy:
- (1) In some state S_i, `green_block_1` is on the table.
- (2) In some state S_j where j < i, `black_block_1` is on top of `green_block_1`.
- (3) In some state, either we're holding `black_block_1` or `black_block_2` is on top of `white_block_2`.
- (4) In some state, we're both holding `black_block_1` and `purple_block_1` is on top of `green_block_1`.
- (5) In some state, we're holding `black_block_2`.
- (6) If we're holding `black_block_2` in state S_k, then in some state S_l where l >= k, either we're holding `black_block_1` or `purple_block_1` is not clear.
- (7) In some state, `white_block_1` is not on top of `white_block_2`.
- (8) If `white_block_1` is not on top of `white_block_2` in state S_m, then in some state S_n where n >= m, either `green_block_2` is on top of `green_block_1` or `white_block_1` is on top of `black_block_1`.

Given the initial state:
```
       white_block_2
       white_block_1
       purple_block_1
       green_block_2
       green_block_1
       black_block_2
       black_block_1
--------------------------
         table
```

Here's a new high-level plan:

1. Unstack all the blocks and put them on the table, except for `green_block_1` and `black_block_2`. This ensures `white_block_1` is not on top of `white_block_2` (7) since all blocks are on the table. As for (8), we need to ensure either `green_block_2` is on top of `green_block_1` or `white_block_1` is on top of `black_block_1` at this point or later. Given that we've already dismantled the tower, we'll need to satisfy this later.
2. Unstack `green_block_1` from `black_block_2`.
3. Put `green_block_1` on the table (satisfying (1)).
4. Unstack `black_block_2` from `black_block_1`.
5. Place `black_block_2` on top of `white_block_2` (satisfying (3)).
6. Pick up `black_block_1` (to later satisfy (4)).
7. Stack `black_block_1` on `green_block_1` (satisfying (2)).
8. Unstack `black_block_1` from `green_block_1`.
9. Stack `white_block_1` on `black_block_1` (satisfying (8)).
10. Stack `purple_block_1` on `green_block_1`.
11. Pick up `black_block_1` (satisfying (4) since `purple_block_1` is on top of `green_block_1` and we're holding `black_block_1`). Since `white_block_1` was on top of `black_block_1`, we had to remove it first.
12. Put `black_block_1` on the table.
13. Unstack `black_block_2` from `white_block_2`.
14. (We're now holding `black_block_2`, which satisfies (5). For (6), either we need to later hold `black_block_1` or ensure `purple_block_1` is not clear.)
15. Stack `black_block_2` on `green_block_1` (satisfying the goal). Note that this satisfies (6) because `purple_block_1` is no longer clear, as `black_block_2` is now on top of it.

Oh wait, I think I'm adding complexity. Let's be more straightforward:

```
Assuming the initial state:
       white_block_2
       white_block_1
       purple_block_1
       green_block_2
       green_block_1
       black_block_2
       black_block_1
--------------------------
         table
```

1. Unstack `white_block_2` from `white_block_1`. (Holding `white_block_2`). This satisfies (7) because `white_block_1` is no longer on top of `white_block_2`.
2. Place `white_block_2` on the table. (Not holding any block). Since (7) is now true, we need to satisfy (8), meaning we need either `green_block_2` on top of `green_block_1` (which is already the case) or `white_block_1` on top of `black_block_1` (not the case, but let's continue).
3. Unstack `white_block_1` from `purple_block_1`. (Holding `white_block_1`).
4. Stack `white_block_1` on `black_block_1`. (Not holding any block). Now (8) is also satisfied because `white_block_1` is on top of `black_block_1`.
5. Unstack `purple_block_1` from `green_block_2`. (Holding `purple_block_1`).
6. Stack `purple_block_1` on `green_block_1`. (Not holding any block).
7. Unstack `white_block_1` from `black_block_1`. (Holding `white_block_1`).
8. Place `white_block_1` on the table. (Not holding any block).
9. Pick up `black_block_1`. (Holding `black_block_1`). This satisfies (3). Also, this satisfies (4) because we're holding `black_block_1` and `purple_block_1` is on top of `green_block_1`.
10. Stack `black_block_1` on `green_block_1`. (Not holding any block). `black_block_1` is now on top of `green_block_1`. We're setting up for (2).
11. Unstack `green_block_2` from `green_block_1`. (Holding `green_block_2`).
12. Place `green_block_2` on the table. (Not holding any block).
13. Unstack `black_block_1` from `green_block_1`. (Holding `black_block_1`).
14. Place `black_block_1` on the table. (Not holding any block).
15. Unstack `purple_block_1` from `green_block_1`. (Holding `purple_block_1`).
16. Place `purple_block_1` on the table. (Not holding any block).
17. Unstack `green_block_1` from `black_block_2`. (Holding `green_block_1`).
18. Place `green_block_1` on the table. (Not holding any block). This satisfies (1), and (2) is already satisfied because `black_block_1` was previously on top of `green_block_1`.
19. Unstack `black_block_2` from `black_block_1`. (Holding `black_block_2`). This satisfies (5).
20. Stack `black_block_2` on `green_block_1`. (Not holding any block). This satisfied the goal. For (6), since we were holding `black_block_2` in step 19, we need to ensure that at some point afterwards (or at that point), either we're holding `black_block_1` or `purple_block_1` is not clear. Let's modify our plan slightly:

...

Actually, let me rethink the plan a bit more carefully. I think I'm overcomplicating. Let's just ensure we're meeting each constraint.

```
Initial state:
       white_block_2
       white_block_1
       purple_block_1
       green_block_2
       green_block_1
       black_block_2
       black_block_1
--------------------------
         table
```

Let's trace through the plan step by step and verify each constraint:

1. Unstack `white_block_2` from `white_block_1`. (Holding `white_block_2`). This satisfies (7) because `white_block_1` is no longer on top of `white_block_2`.
2. Stack `white_block_2` on the table. (Not holding any block). Since (7) is now true, we need to satisfy (8), meaning we need either `green_block_2` on top of `green_block_1` (which is already the case) or `white_block_1` on top of `black_block_1` (not the case, but let's continue).
3. Unstack `white_block_1` from `purple_block_1`. (Holding `white_block_1`).
4. Stack `white_block_1` on `black_block_1`. (Not holding any block). Now (8) is also satisfied because `white_block_1` is on top of `black_block_1`.
5. Unstack `purple_block_1` from `green_block_2`. (Holding `purple_block_1`).
6. Stack `purple_block_1` on `green_block_1`. (Not holding any block).
7. Unstack `green_block_2` from `green_block_1`. (Holding `green_block_2`).
8. Place `green_block_2` on the table. (Not holding any block).
9. Unstack `white_block_1` from `black_block_1`. (Holding `white_block_1`).
10. Place `white_block_1` on the table. (Not holding any block).
11. Pick up `black_block_1`. (Holding `black_block_1`). This satisfies (3) (holding `black_block_1`). Also, this satisfies (4) because we're holding `black_block_1` and `purple_block_1` is on top of `green_block_1`.
12. Stack `black_block_1` on `green_block_1`. (Not holding any block). `black_block_1` is now on top of `green_block_1` and `purple_block_1` is under it. We're setting up for (2).
13. Unstack `black_block_1` from `green_block_1`. (Holding `black_block_1`).
14. Place `black_block_1` on the table. (Not holding any block).
15. Unstack `purple_block_1` from `green_block_1`. (Holding `purple_block_1`).
16. Stack `purple_block_1` on `black_block_1`. (Not holding any block). We're making sure `purple_block_1` is not clear for later.
17. Unstack `green_block_1` from `black_block_2`. (Holding `green_block_1`).
18. Place `green_block_1` on the table. (Not holding any block). This satisfies (1), and (2) is already satisfied because `black_block_1` was previously on top of `green_block_1`.
19. Unstack `black_block_2` from `black_block_1`. (Holding `black_block_2`). This satisfies (5). For (6), since we're holding `black_block_2` in this step, we need to ensure that at some point afterwards (or at this point), either we're holding `black_block_1` or `purple_block_1` is not clear. Since `purple_block_1` is already not clear (we put it underneath `black_block_1`), (6) is satisfied.
20. Stack `black_block_2` on `green_block_1`. (Not holding any block). This satisfies the goal.

I think this plan ensures all constraints are met. Let's convert it into a detailed action list:

1. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
2. putdown white_block_2
3. unstack white_block_1 purple_block_1
4. stack white_block_1 black_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2
6. stack purple_block_1 green_block_1
7. unstack green_block_2 green_block_1
8. putdown green_block_2
9. unstack white_block_1 black_block_1
10. putdown white_block_1
11. pickup black_block_1
12. stack black_block_1 green_block_1
13. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1
14. putdown black_block_1
15. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_1
16. stack purple_block_1 black_block_1
17. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
18. putdown green_block_1
19. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
20. stack black_block_2 green_block_1

Actually, let's rethink the initial state more carefully:

```
       white_block_2
       white_block_1
       purple_block_1
       green_block_2
       green_block_1
       black_block_2
       black_block_1
--------------------------
         table
```

We have:
- `black_block_1` is on the table
- `black_block_2` is on top of `black_block_1`
- `green_block_1` is on top of `black_block_2`
- `green_block_2` is on top of `green_block_1`
- `purple_block_1` is on top of `green_block_2`
- `white_block_1` is on top of `purple_block_1`
- `white_block_2` is on top of `white_block_1`
- `white_block_2` is clear
- The arm is not holding any block.

The goal is to have `black_block_2` on top of `green_block_1`.

Actually, looking at this more, I realize I made a misconception, and the plan I proposed doesn't work. Let's reason the initial state correctly now:

Our starting configuration is a single tower with `black_block_1` at the bottom (on the table) and `white_block_2` at the top.

Let's re-trace the plan with the correct initial state:

1. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1 (Now holding white_block_2. white_block_1 is clear.)
2. putdown white_block_2 (white_block_2 is now on the table and clear. white_block_1 is still clear.)
3. unstack white_block_1 purple_block_1 (Now holding white_block_1. purple_block_1 is clear.)
4. stack white_block_1 black_block_1 (This is not possible! black_block_1 is not clear since black_block_2 is on top of it.)

So my plan isn't valid. Let's rethink.

Given the correct initial state, let's devise a new plan:

1. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1 (Now holding white_block_2. white_block_1 is clear.)
2. putdown white_block_2 (white_block_2 is now on the table and clear. white_block_1 is still clear.)
3. unstack white_block_1 purple_block_1 (Now holding white_block_1. purple_block_1 is clear.)
4. putdown white_block_1 (white_block_1 is now on the table and clear. purple_block_1 is still clear.)
5. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2 (Now holding purple_block_1. green_block_2 is clear.)
6. putdown purple_block_1 (purple_block_1 is now on the table and clear. green_block_2 is still clear.)
7. unstack green_block_2 green_block_1 (Now holding green_block_2. green_block_1 is clear.)
8. putdown green_block_2 (green_block_2 is now on the table and clear. green_block_1 is still clear.)
9. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2 (Now holding green_block_1. black_block_2 is clear.)
10. putdown green_block_1 (green_block_1 is now on the table and clear. black_block_2 is still clear. This satisfies constraint (1).)

At this point, we still need to satisfy constraint (2): Before we put green_block_1 on the table, black_block_1 must have been on top of green_block_1. But in our dismantling process, that didn't happen. Let's revisit.

Actually, let's just take a more strategical approach. Let's satisfy the constraints one by one:

1. Initially, `green_block_1` is on top of `black_block_2` and `white_block_2` is on top of `white_block_1`. This means (7) is already satisfied because `white_block_2` is on top of `white_block_1`, not the other way around. Constraint (8) is automatically satisfied because (7) is not triggered.

2. To satisfy (2), at some point, `black_block_1` must be on top of `green_block_1` before `green_block_1` is placed on the table. Let's restructure the tower to achieve this.

First, let's dismantle the tower to the point where we want to restructure:

1. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
2. putdown white_block_2
3. unstack white_block_1 purple_block_1
4. putdown white_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack green_block_2 green_block_1
8. putdown green_block_2
9. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
10. putdown green_block_1

Now, let's restructure:

11. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
12. putdown black_block_2
13. pickup black_block_1
14. stack black_block_1 green_block_1 (This satisfies (2) for constraint 2.)
15. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1
16. putdown black_block_1

Now `green_block_1` is already on the table, satisfying (1).

To satisfy (4), we need to hold `black_block_1` and also have `purple_block_1` on top of `green_block_1` at the same time:

17. pickup purple_block_1
18. stack purple_block_1 green_block_1
19. pickup black_block_1 (Now satisfying (4), also satisfying (3).)
20. putdown black_block_1

To satisfy (5) and (6):

21. pickup black_block_2 (Satisfying (5).)
22. stack black_block_2 green_block_1 (This achieves the goal, but also we need to satisfy (6), meaning either we later hold black_block_1 or purple_block_1 is not clear. Since purple_block_1 is under black_block_2, it's not clear, so (6) is satisfied.)

Let's double-check:
- (1) `green_block_1` is on the table from step 10.
- (2) `black_block_1` is on top of `green_block_1` in step 14 before `green_block_1` is placed on the table (which already happened in step 10).
- (3) We're holding `black_block_1` in step 19.
- (4) We're holding `black_block_1` in step 19 and `purple_block_1` is on top of `green_block_1` from step 18.
- (5) We're holding `black_block_2` in step 21.
- (6) When holding `black_block_2` in step 21, in a later step (22), `purple_block_1` is not clear because `black_block_2` is on top of it.
- (7) `white_block_1` is not on top of `white_block_2` throughout the plan, and instead they're both just on the table.
- (8) Constraint not triggered because (7) is not the trigger.

Hmm, there seems to be a contradiction in the satisfied constraints. Let's re-read constraint (2):

"If expression `green_block_1 is on the table` holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: `black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1`."

So, if `green_block_1` is on the table at some point, then, before that, `black_block_1` must have been on top of `green_block_1`. This means we can't have `green_block_1` on the table in step 10 and then have `black_block_1` on top of `green_block_1` in step 14. That's out of order.

Let's revision our plan. The initial order of stacking is:

```
       white_block_2
       white_block_1
       purple_block_1
       green_block_2
       green_block_1
       black_block_2
       black_block_1
--------------------------
         table
```

Revised plan:

1. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
2. putdown white_block_2
3. unstack white_block_1 purple_block_1
4. putdown white_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack green_block_2 green_block_1
8. putdown green_block_2
9. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
10. stack green_block_1 black_block_1 (This makes green_block_1 be on top of black_block_1, which doesn't satisfy the constraint but is a step toward it.)
11. unstack green_block_1 black_block_1
12. putdown green_block_1
13. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
14. putdown black_block_2
15. pickup black_block_1
16. stack black_block_1 green_block_1 (This satisfies (2): black_block_1 is now on top of green_block_1.)
17. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1
18. putdown black_block_1 (green_block_1 is still on the table, satisfying (1).)

To satisfy (4), we need to hold `black_block_1` and also have `purple_block_1` on top of `green_block_1` at the same time:

19. pickup purple_block_1
20. stack purple_block_1 green_block_1
21. pickup black_block_1 (Now satisfying (4), also satisfying (3).)
22. putdown black_block_1

To satisfy (5) and (6):

23. pickup black_block_2 (Satisfying (5).)
24. stack black_block_2 green_block_1 (This achieves the goal, but also we need to satisfy (6), meaning either we later hold black_block_1 or purple_block_1 is not clear. Since purple_block_1 is under black_block_2, it's not clear, so (6) is satisfied.)

Let's double-check again:
- (1) `green_block_1` is on the table from step 12.
- (2) `black_block_1` is on top of `green_block_1` in step 16 before step 12. Wait, that's not right.

I think I'm misunderstanding something. Let's read constraint (2) again:

"If expression `green_block_1 is on the table` holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: `black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1`."

Upon rereading, the constraint doesn't necessarily require a strict "before-then-after" sequence for these conditions. It just states that if `green_block_1 is on the table` at some state, then there must be an earlier state where `black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1`.

Actually, looks like I'm still making the same mistake. If `green_block_1` is on the table at a state S_i, then there must be a state S_j where j < i such that `black_block_1` is on top of `green_block_1`. That is, before `green_block_1` is on the table, `black_block_1` must have been on top of it, not the other way around.

Let's replan:

1. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
2. putdown white_block_2
3. unstack white_block_1 purple_block_1
4. putdown white_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack green_block_2 green_block_1
8. putdown green_block_2
9. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
10. putdown green_block_1 (This puts green_block_1 on the table, violating constraint (2) because black_block_1 has not been on top of green_block_1 yet.)

OK, let's be even more careful. We need to satisfy (2) before (1).

1. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
2. putdown white_block_2
3. unstack white_block_1 purple_block_1
4. putdown white_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack green_block_2 green_block_1
8. putdown green_block_2
9. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
10. stack green_block_1 white_block_2 (We're just keeping green_block_1 off the table for now.)
11. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
12. putdown black_block_2
13. pickup black_block_1
14. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
15. stack black_block_1 green_block_1 (This satisfies (2): black_block_1 is now on top of green_block_1.)
16. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1
17. putdown black_block_1
18. putdown green_block_1 (Now green_block_1 is on the table, satisfying (1). And (2) is already satisfied in a previous step.)

To satisfy (4), we need to hold `black_block_1` and also have `purple_block_1` on top of `green_block_1` at the same time:

19. pickup purple_block_1
20. stack purple_block_1 green_block_1
21. pickup black_block_1 (Now satisfying (4), also satisfying (3).)
22. putdown black_block_1

To satisfy (5) and (6):

23. pickup black_block_2 (Satisfying (5).)
24. stack black_block_2 purple_block_1 (Getting ready for the goal. This also satisfies (6) because we're not holding black_block_2 anymore.)
25. unstack black_block_2 purple_block_1 (Holding black_block_2 again, but (6) is not a problem since purple_block_1 is not clear.)
26. stack black_block_2 green_block_1 (This achieves the goal).

Actually, there's still a problem: in Step 14, I have the arm holding `black_block_1`, but then in Step 14, I try to unstack `green_block_1 white_block_2`. We can't have the arm holding more than one block at a time, which I forgot. Let's make another revision.

The initial configuration is:
```
       white_block_2
       white_block_1
       purple_block_1
       green_block_2
       green_block_1
       black_block_2
       black_block_1
--------------------------
         table
```

Final plan:

1. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
2. putdown white_block_2
3. unstack white_block_1 purple_block_1
4. putdown white_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack green_block_2 green_block_1
8. putdown green_block_2
9. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
10. putdown green_block_1 (Violating (2), but we'll fix it later. green_block_1 is now on the table, satisfying (1).)
11. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
12. putdown black_block_2
13. pickup black_block_1
14. stack black_block_1 green_block_1 (This satisfies (2) if we reset the plan. Let's do that.)

Actually, let me be very clear about the constraints:

1. At some point, `green_block_1` must be on the table.
2. If `green_block_1` is on the table, then at some earlier point, `black_block_1` must have been on top of `green_block_1`.
3. At some point, either we're holding `black_block_1` or `black_block_2` is on top of `white_block_2`.
4. At some point, we're both holding `black_block_1` and `purple_block_1` is on top of `green_block_1`.
5. At some point, we're holding `black_block_2`.
6. If we're holding `black_block_2` in a state, then at that state or a later state, either we're holding `black_block_1` or `purple_block_1` is not clear.
7. At some point, `white_block_1` is not on top of `white_block_2`.
8. If `white_block_1` is not on top of `white_block_2` in a state, then at that state or a later state, either `green_block_2` is on top of `green_block_1` or `white_block_1` is on top of `black_block_1`.

Given the initial state:
```
       white_block_2
       white_block_1
       purple_block_1
       green_block_2
       green_block_1
       black_block_2
       black_block_1
--------------------------
         table
```

Actually, there's some misunderstanding. Let me re-read the constraints.

"If expression `green_block_1 is on the table` holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: `black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1`."

This means if at any point, `green_block_1` is on the table, then at an earlier point, `black_block_1` must have been on top of `green_block_1`.

It doesn't say that `green_block_1` can't be on the table now. It just says that if it is, there must have been an earlier state where `black_block_1` was on top of it.

Actually, wait. Let me start fresh, and think about it constraint by constraint.

Let's consider constraint (2): "If expression `green_block_1 is on the table` holds in some state S_i, then there must be an earlier state S_j (where j < i) in which the following expression is true: `black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1`." If we ever place `green_block_1` on the table in our plan, we must ensure that, previously, `black_block_1` was on top of `green_block_1` in our plan.

Now, let's consider the initial state:
```
       white_block_2
       white_block_1
       purple_block_1
       green_block_2
       green_block_1
       black_block_2
       black_block_1
--------------------------
         table
```

In this initial state, `green_block_1` is not on the table (it's on top of `black_block_2`), so constraint (2) isn't immediately violated. But if we ever place `green_block_1` on the table in our plan, we must ensure that, previously, `black_block_1` was on top of `green_block_1` in our plan.

Given this understanding, let's formulate a plan:

1. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
2. putdown white_block_2
3. unstack white_block_1 purple_block_1
4. putdown white_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack green_block_2 green_block_1
8. putdown green_block_2
9. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
10. stack green_block_1 white_block_2 (We're avoiding putting green_block_1 on the table for now, since constraint (2) hasn't been satisfied yet.)
11. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
12. putdown black_block_2
13. pickup black_block_1
14. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2 (Oops, we can't unstack green_block_1 since we're already holding black_block_1.)

Let's revise.

1. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
2. putdown white_block_2
3. unstack white_block_1 purple_block_1
4. putdown white_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack green_block_2 green_block_1
8. putdown green_block_2
9. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
10. stack green_block_1 white_block_2 (We're avoiding putting green_block_1 on the table for now, since constraint (2) hasn't been satisfied yet.)
11. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
12. putdown black_block_2
13. pickup black_block_1
14. putdown black_block_1 (On second thought, we can't use black_block_1 for now since green_block_1 is not available.)
15. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
16. stack green_block_1 black_block_1 (Now we can put black_block_1 on top of green_block_1.)
17. pickup black_block_1
18. stack black_block_1 green_block_1 (This satisfies constraint (2).)
19. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1
20. putdown black_block_1
21. putdown green_block_1 (Now green_block_1 is on the table, satisfying (1).)

To satisfy (4), we need to hold `black_block_1` and also have `purple_block_1` on top of `green_block_1` at the same time:

22. pickup purple_block_1
23. stack purple_block_1 green_block_1
24. pickup black_block_1 (Now satisfying (4), also satisfying (3).)
25. putdown black_block_1

To satisfy (5) and (6):

26. pickup black_block_2 (Satisfying (5).)
27. stack black_block_2 purple_block_1 (This accomplishes several things: First, we've satisfied (6) because purple_block_1 is not clear. Second, we've satisfied the goal of having black_block_2 on top of green_block_1 because black_block_2 is now on top of purple_block_1, which is on top of green_block_1.)

Wait, the goal is specifically for `black_block_2` to be on top of `green_block_1`, not indirectly on top of it. Let me revise the last steps:

26. pickup black_block_2 (Satisfying (5).)
27. stack black_block_2 green_block_1 (This achieves the goal, but it violates (6) because we're holding black_block_2, and after we stack it, we're not holding black_block_1, and purple_block_1 is still clear.)

Let's retrack:

26. pickup purple_block_1
27. stack purple_block_1 black_block_1 (This ensures purple_block_1 is not clear for later.)
28. pickup black_block_2 (Satisfying (5).)
29. stack black_block_2 green_block_1 (Achieving the goal. (6) is now also satisfied because after holding black_block_2, purple_block_1 is not clear.)

Let's double-check:
- (1) `green_block_1` is on the table from step 21.
- (2) `black_block_1` is on top of `green_block_1` in step 18, prior to `green_block_1` being on the table.
- (3) We're holding `black_block_1` in step 24.
- (4) We're holding `black_block_1` in step 24 and `purple_block_1` is on top of `green_block_1` from step 23.
- (5) We're holding `black_block_2` in step 28.
- (6) After holding `black_block_2` in step 28, `purple_block_1` is not clear because it's under `black_block_1`.
- (7) `white_block_1` is not on top of `white_block_2` from step 1.
- (8) Since (7) is satisfied in step 1, (8) requires that either `green_block_2` is on top of `green_block_1` or `white_block_1` is on top of `black_block_1` at step 1 or later. At step 1, `green_block_2` is on top of `green_block_1` (from the initial state), so (8) is satisfied.

Actually, I think I'm making a mistake in interpretation of constraint (6):

"If expression `you are holding black_block_2` holds in some state s, then expression `At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding black_block_1", "there is a block on top of purple_block_1, i.e., purple_block_1 is not clear"` must hold at s or at some state after s"

This says that if we're holding `black_block_2` in a state, then at that state or some state after, we need to either be holding `black_block_1` or have `purple_block_1` not be clear. 

Actually, the way I'm establishing (6) doesn't satisfy it as described: at Step 28, we're holding `black_block_2`. At this step or a later step, we need to either be holding `black_block_1` or have `purple_block_1` not be clear. We're not holding `black_block_1` at step 28 or any later step. And `purple_block_1` is clear at step 28 (because it's on top of `black_block_1`), and it remains clear for the rest of the plan. So (6) is not satisfied.

OK, still need to satisfy (6). Let's adjust the plan:

26. pickup black_block_1
27. stack black_block_1 purple_block_1 (Making `purple_block_1` not clear.)
28. pickup black_block_2 (Satisfying (5).)
29. stack black_block_2 green_block_1 (Achieving the goal. (6) is now also satisfied because after holding black_block_2, purple_block_1 is not clear.)

Actually, I realize my reasoning here is wrong. The way I'm trying to establish (6) doesn't work.

(6) requires that if we're holding `black_block_2` at some point, then at that point or later, we need to either be holding `black_block_1` or have `purple_block_1` not be clear.

At Step 28, we're holding `black_block_2`. At this point, we're not holding `black_block_1` and `purple_block_1` is clear (it now has `black_block_1` on top of it, making it not clear).

Actually, my earlier plan does satisfy (6).

But I'm getting confused in my reasoning. Let me be super explicit about the state at each step, and verify if the constraints are met:

(6) says: "If we're holding `black_block_2` at some point, then at that point or later, we need to either be holding `black_block_1` or have `purple_block_1` not clear."

At Step 28, we're holding `black_block_2`, so this constraint activates.
At this point, we're not holding `black_block_1`. But `purple_block_1` is not clear because, from step 27, `black_block_1` is now on top of `purple_block_1`. So constraint (6) is satisfied.

OK, with that cleared up, I think the plan from steps 1-29 should be correct. Let me double-check that plan as a whole:

1. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
2. putdown white_block_2
3. unstack white_block_1 purple_block_1
4. putdown white_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack green_block_2 green_block_1
8. putdown green_block_2
9. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
10. stack green_block_1 white_block_2 
11. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
12. putdown black_block_2
13. pickup black_block_1
14. putdown black_block_1
15. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
16. stack green_block_1 black_block_1 
17. pickup black_block_1
18. stack black_block_1 green_block_1 (This satisfies constraint (2).)
19. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1
20. putdown black_block_1
21. putdown green_block_1 (Now green_block_1 is on the table, satisfying (1).)
22. pickup purple_block_1
23. stack purple_block_1 green_block_1
24. pickup black_block_1 (Now satisfying (4), also satisfying (3).)
25. putdown black_block_1
26. pickup black_block_1
27. stack black_block_1 purple_block_1 (Making `purple_block_1` not clear for (6).)
28. pickup black_block_2 (Satisfying (5).)
29. stack black_block_2 green_block_1 (Achieving the goal. (6) is satisfied because after holding black_block_2, purple_block_1 is not clear.)

One correction: There's a problem in step 10: "stack green_block_1 white_block_2". This stacks green_block_1 on top of white_block_2, not white_block_2 on top of green_block_1. I'll fix that in the finalized plan.

Actually, thinking about this again, I think there's a problem in my understanding of the state at step 16 (which is also wrong, since it stacks green_block_1 on top of black_block_1, which is not what I intended). 

Oof, I've been really confusing myself. Let me be very deliberate.

The initial state of the blocks is:
```
       white_block_2
       white_block_1
       purple_block_1
       green_block_2
       green_block_1
       black_block_2
       black_block_1
--------------------------
         table
```

I need to be careful about the ordering of my "stack" and "unstack" operations, ensuring they align with the correct ordering of blocks in the Blocksworld domain.

"unstack block1 block2" means that block1 is currently on top of block2, and this action removes block1 from block2.
"stack block1 block2" means that block1 is placed on top of block2.

Let me trace through a more careful plan:

1. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
2. putdown white_block_2
3. unstack white_block_1 purple_block_1
4. putdown white_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack green_block_2 green_block_1
8. putdown green_block_2
9. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
10. stack green_block_1 white_block_2
11. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
12. putdown black_block_2
13. pickup black_block_1
14. putdown black_block_1
15. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
16. putdown green_block_1 (Placing green_block_1 on the table, but violating (2).)

Actually, I think I need to make a more precise plan, double-checking each constraint as I go.

Step 16 (as it stands now) violates constraint (2) because we're putting green_block_1 on the table without having black_block_1 on top of green_block_1 at an earlier step.

Let's reconsider:

1. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
2. putdown white_block_2
3. unstack white_block_1 purple_block_1
4. putdown white_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack green_block_2 green_block_1
8. putdown green_block_2
9. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
10. putdown green_block_1 (This violates (2), so I'll need to reset the strategy here.)

I am overthinking the sequence. The key is to look at the constraints in the order given, and make sure that if we put green_block_1 on the table, we've satisfied the condition that black_block_1 was earlier on top of green_block_1.

Let's be deliberate and strategic.

1. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1 (Satisfying (7) immediately.)
2. putdown white_block_2
3. unstack white_block_1 purple_block_1
4. putdown white_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack green_block_2 green_block_1
8. putdown green_block_2
9. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
10. putdown green_block_1 (We've now satisfied (1) by putting green_block_1 on the table. But WAIT! This violates (2), because black_block_1 hasn't been on top of green_block_1 before this. I'll need to reset the plan.)

Let's reset. The key is to get black_block_1 on top of green_block_1 before green_block_1 goes on the table.

1. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1 (Satisfying (7) immediately. Also, since green_block_2 is on top of green_block_1 in the initial state, (8) is also satisfied.)
2. putdown white_block_2
3. unstack white_block_1 purple_block_1
4. putdown white_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack green_block_2 green_block_1
