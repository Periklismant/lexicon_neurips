Okay, let's see. I need to find a plan to get orange_block_3 on top of orange_block_2. The initial state has some towers. Let me visualize the initial setup.

First, the initial state:

- green_block_1 is on the table with grey_block_1 on top, then orange_block_2, then red_block_1. So the tower is green_block_1 -> grey_block_1 -> orange_block_2 -> red_block_1. And red_block_1 is clear.

- orange_block_1 is on the table with blue_block_1 on top, then orange_block_3. So the tower here is orange_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> orange_block_3. Orange_block_3 is clear.

Other blocks like orange_block_2 and red_block_1 are part of the first tower.

The goal is to have orange_block_3 on orange_block_2. So orange_block_2 must be clear to stack on it. But currently, orange_block_2 is under red_block_1. So I need to move red_block_1 off first.

Also, orange_block_3 is currently on blue_block_1. To move it, I need to unstack it. But blue_block_1 is under orange_block_3, which is clear. So I can unstack orange_block_3 from blue_block_1.

So steps I think:

1. Unstack orange_block_3 from blue_block_1. That would require the arm to be free, which it is. So perform unstack orange_block_3 blue_block_1. After this, the arm is holding orange_block_3, and blue_block_1 becomes clear.

But then, we need to place orange_block_3 on orange_block_2. But orange_block_2 is currently under red_block_1. So we need to clear orange_block_2 first. So we need to move red_block_1 somewhere.

So, steps:

- Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_2. Wait, but red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2. To unstack red_block_1, we need to have it clear, which it is. So unstack red_block_1 orange_block_2. Then put it down on the table. Then, orange_block_2 becomes clear. Then stack orange_block_3 onto orange_block_2.

But let's check the current state:

First, the initial state has red_block_1 on orange_block_2. So to unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_2, the preconditions are: red_block_1 is on orange_block_2, red_block_1 is clear (which it is), and the arm is empty. So yes, we can do that.

So possible steps:

1. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_2. Then the arm is holding red_block_1, orange_block_2 becomes clear.

2. putdown red_block_1. Now red_block_1 is on the table, clear.

3. Now, need to unstack orange_block_3 from blue_block_1. Because orange_block_3 is on blue_block_1. So unstack orange_block_3 blue_block_1. Now holding orange_block_3.

4. Then stack orange_block_3 orange_block_2. Since orange_block_2 is clear now. That achieves the goal.

Wait, but let's check the preconditions for each action.

First step: unstack red_block_1 orange_block_2. Preconditions: red_block_1 is on orange_block_2, red_block_1 is clear (yes), and arm is empty (yes). So valid.

After unstack, arm is holding red_block_1. Then putdown red_block_1. Precondition: holding red_block_1. Yes. So that's valid. Putdown makes red_block_1 on table, clear.

Then, unstack orange_block_3 blue_block_1. Preconditions: orange_block_3 is on blue_block_1, orange_block_3 is clear (yes), arm is empty (yes after putdown). So unstack. Now holding orange_block_3.

Then stack orange_block_3 onto orange_block_2. Preconditions: holding orange_block_3 and orange_block_2 is clear. Yes, since after step 2, orange_block_2 is clear. So stack. Now orange_block_3 is on orange_block_2. Goal achieved.

So the plan would be:

unstack red_block_1 orange_block_2

putdown red_block_1

unstack orange_block_3 blue_block_1

stack orange_block_3 orange_block_2

But wait, after unstacking orange_block_3 from blue_block_1, blue_block_1 becomes clear. Then stacking orange_block_3 onto orange_block_2. That should work. So that's four steps. Is there a shorter plan?

Alternative approach: Maybe instead of moving red_block_1, can we move orange_block_3 directly? Let's see.

In the initial state, orange_block_3 is on blue_block_1, which is on orange_block_1. To get orange_block_3 to orange_block_2, which is under red_block_1. So need to clear orange_block_2 first. So moving red_block_1 is necessary.

Alternatively, could we move the entire tower under orange_block_3? Not sure. Let me think.

Another idea: Maybe instead of putting red_block_1 on the table, can we stack it somewhere else, but that might take more steps. Putting it on the table is the quickest.

So the initial plan I thought of is four steps. Let me check again.

Another possible issue: When we unstack red_block_1, then put it down. Then, the arm is empty again. Then unstack orange_block_3 from blue_block_1, then stack it on orange_block_2. So yes, that's four actions. Is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, can we do something else? Let's see. Suppose after unstacking red_block_1, instead of putting it down, can we stack it somewhere else? But where? The goal only involves orange_block_3 and orange_block_2. But stacking red_block_1 on another block would require that block to be clear. For example, stack red_block_1 on green_block_1. But green_block_1 is under grey_block_1, which is under orange_block_2 (wait, no: initial state says green_block_1 is on table, with grey_block_1 on top, then orange_block_2, then red_block_1. So in initial state, green_block_1 -> grey_block_1 -> orange_block_2 -> red_block_1. So green_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top. So grey_block_1 is not clear. So can't stack red_block_1 on grey_block_1. So putting red_block_1 on the table is necessary.

Alternatively, can we stack red_block_1 on another block that's clear? Like blue_block_1. After unstacking orange_block_3, blue_block_1 becomes clear. But that's after. Hmm. Let's see.

So steps:

1. unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_2. Now holding red_block_1.

2. stack red_block_1 on blue_block_1. But blue_block_1 has orange_block_3 on top. Wait, in initial state, blue_block_1 is under orange_block_3. So to stack red_block_1 on blue_block_1, blue_block_1 must be clear. Which it isn't until we unstack orange_block_3. So no, can't stack red_block_1 on blue_block_1 before moving orange_block_3. So that's not possible. So putting red_block_1 on the table is the only option here.

So the initial plan of four steps is valid. Let's check again each step's preconditions and effects.

Step 1: unstack red_block_1 orange_block_2.

Preconditions: red_block_1 is on orange_block_2, red_block_1 is clear (yes), arm is empty (yes).

After this, red_block_1 is no longer on orange_block_2, orange_block_2 is clear. Arm is holding red_block_1.

Step 2: putdown red_block_1.

Preconditions: holding red_block_1. Yes.

After this, red_block_1 is on table, clear. Arm is empty.

Step 3: unstack orange_block_3 blue_block_1.

Preconditions: orange_block_3 is on blue_block_1, orange_block_3 is clear (yes), arm is empty (yes).

After this, orange_block_3 is held, blue_block_1 becomes clear.

Step 4: stack orange_block_3 orange_block_2.

Preconditions: holding orange_block_3, orange_block_2 is clear (yes, from step 1 and 2). So stack.

After this, orange_block_3 is on orange_block_2, orange_block_2 is not clear, arm is empty. Which achieves the goal.

Yes, this works. Are there any shorter plans? Let's think.

What if we can avoid moving red_block_1? But orange_block_2 is under red_block_1, so until red_block_1 is moved, orange_block_2 is not clear. So we have to move red_block_1. So the steps are necessary.

Another alternative: Could we move orange_block_3 first? Let's see.

Initial state: orange_block_3 is on blue_block_1. So we can unstack orange_block_3 from blue_block_1. Then, we need to stack it on orange_block_2, but orange_block_2 is under red_block_1. So even if we unstack orange_block_3, we can't stack it on orange_block_2 until red_block_1 is moved. So the steps would be:

1. unstack orange_block_3 blue_block_1.

2. Then need to unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_2.

3. putdown red_block_1.

4. stack orange_block_3 orange_block_2.

Same four steps, just different order. The number of steps is the same. So either order would be four steps. But does the order matter for preconditions?

Wait, if we first unstack orange_block_3, then the arm is holding it. Then we need to put it down somewhere before unstacking red_block_1. Because to unstack red_block_1, the arm must be empty.

So that approach would require:

1. unstack orange_block_3 blue_block_1.

2. putdown orange_block_3.

3. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_2.

4. putdown red_block_1.

5. pickup orange_block_3.

6. stack orange_block_3 orange_block_2.

That's six steps, which is longer. So that's worse. So the initial plan is better.

Thus, the optimal plan is four steps: unstack red, putdown red, unstack orange3, stack orange3 on orange2.

Yes, that's the minimal steps. So the answer is this four-step plan.
