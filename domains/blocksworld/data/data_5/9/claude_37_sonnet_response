Let's understand the problem:

1. We have 7 blocks:
   - green_block_1
   - orange_block_1
   - blue_block_1
   - grey_block_1
   - orange_block_2
   - red_block_1
   - orange_block_3

2. The initial state of the world:
   - green_block_1 is on the table
   - orange_block_1 is on the table
   - blue_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
   - grey_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
   - orange_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1
   - red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2
   - orange_block_3 is on top of blue_block_1
   - red_block_1 is clear
   - orange_block_3 is clear
   - no block is being held

3. The goal state:
   - orange_block_3 is on top of orange_block_2

4. And the constraints are:
   - orange_block_3 must be on the table at least once during the plan.
   - red_block_1 must never be on the table.
   - We must hold red_block_1 at least once.
   - If we hold red_block_1, we must have held orange_block_3 at an earlier point.
   - At least once, either green_block_1 is not on the table or grey_block_1 is clear.
   - At least once, either blue_block_1 is on the table or grey_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1.

Now, let's visualize the initial state:

```
    red_block_1     orange_block_3
         |                |
    orange_block_2    blue_block_1
         |                |
    grey_block_1    orange_block_1
         |
    green_block_1
     (table)          (table)
```

And we want to achieve the goal state:

```
     orange_block_3
          |
     orange_block_2
          |
     ?
      ?
```

Given the constraints, we need to plan a sequence of actions that will take us from the initial state to the goal state while ensuring all constraints are satisfied.

Let's think through this:

1. To satisfy the constraint that we must hold red_block_1 at least once, we'll need to unstack it from orange_block_2.

2. To satisfy the constraint that if we hold red_block_1, we must have held orange_block_3 earlier, we'll need to unstack orange_block_3 from blue_block_1 first.

3. To place orange_block_3 on top of orange_block_2, we need orange_block_2 to be clear and we need to be holding orange_block_3.

4. To satisfy the constraint that orange_block_3 must be on the table at least once, we'll need to put it down at some point after unstacking it.

5. The constraints about green_block_1, grey_block_1, blue_block_1, and orange_block_1 will guide some of our intermediate actions.

Let's start planning:

1. Unstack orange_block_3 from blue_block_1.
2. Put orange_block_3 on the table (to satisfy the constraint).
3. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_2 (now we've held red_block_1 after orange_block_3, satisfying the constraint).
4. Stack red_block_1 on some other block (to ensure it's never on the table).
5. Pick up orange_block_3 from the table.
6. Stack orange_block_3 on top of orange_block_2 (the goal state).

But this plan doesn't account for all the constraints. Let's revisit the constraint: "At least once, either green_block_1 is not on the table or grey_block_1 is clear."

In the initial state, green_block_1 is on the table, and grey_block_1 is not clear (it has orange_block_2 on top of it). We need to either move green_block_1 off the table or make grey_block_1 clear.

Looking at the constraint: "At least once, either blue_block_1 is on the table or grey_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1."

Initially, blue_block_1 is not on the table (it's on top of orange_block_1), and grey_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1. We need to achieve one of these conditions.

So, the plan needs to be more detailed. Let's reconsider.

Let's identify the clearest path to the goal:

1. To place orange_block_3 on top of orange_block_2, we need to unstack red_block_1, which is currently on top of orange_block_2.
2. But to unstack red_block_1, we need to first hold orange_block_3 (due to the constraint).

So, the beginning of our plan is clear:

1. Unstack orange_block_3 from blue_block_1.

Now, we need to ensure that the constraints about green_block_1, grey_block_1, blue_block_1, and orange_block_1 are met.

Let's check the constraint: "At least once, either green_block_1 is not on the table or grey_block_1 is clear."

To satisfy this, after unstacking orange_block_3, we can:
2. Put orange_block_3 on the table (to satisfy the constraint that orange_block_3 is on the table).
3. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_2. This makes orange_block_2 clear.
4. Unstack orange_block_2 from grey_block_1. This makes grey_block_1 clear, satisfying the constraint.

Now, for the constraint: "At least once, either blue_block_1 is on the table or grey_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1."

We can place blue_block_1 on the table or move grey_block_1 to be on top of orange_block_1. Let's go with the first option:

5. Unstack blue_block_1 from orange_block_1 (at this point, blue_block_1 is in the gripper).
6. Putdown blue_block_1 (now blue_block_1 is on the table, satisfying the constraint).

Now, let's complete the goal:

7. Pickup orange_block_3 from the table.
8. Stack orange_block_3 on top of orange_block_2 (goal achieved).

But wait, we need to ensure that red_block_1 is never on the table. Currently, after unstacking red_block_1 from orange_block_2, we're holding it. We need to place it elsewhere.

Let's see what's available. At that point, orange_block_1 is clear (since we moved blue_block_1), green_block_1 is on the table with grey_block_1 on top of it (and grey_block_1 is clear after we moved orange_block_2).

Let's adjust the plan:

1. Unstack orange_block_3 from blue_block_1.
2. Put orange_block_3 on the table.
3. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_2.
4. Stack red_block_1 on grey_block_1 (to ensure it's never on the table).
5. Unstack blue_block_1 from orange_block_1.
6. Putdown blue_block_1 (now blue_block_1 is on the table, satisfying the constraint).
7. Pickup orange_block_3 from the table.
8. Stack orange_block_3 on top of orange_block_2 (goal achieved).

Wait, there's a constraint that says: "If you are holding red_block_1, then there must be an earlier state in which you are holding orange_block_3." But in our plan, we pick up red_block_1 right after putting down orange_block_3. We need to ensure we hold orange_block_3 again before unstacking red_block_1.

Let's refine the plan:

1. Unstack orange_block_3 from blue_block_1.
2. Put orange_block_3 on the table.
3. Pickup orange_block_3 from the table.
4. Putdown orange_block_3 (we've now held orange_block_3 twice).
5. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_2.
6. Stack red_block_1 on grey_block_1 (to ensure it's never on the table).
7. Unstack blue_block_1 from orange_block_1.
8. Putdown blue_block_1 (now blue_block_1 is on the table, satisfying the constraint).
9. Pickup orange_block_3 from the table.
10. Stack orange_block_3 on top of orange_block_2 (goal achieved).

On second thought, steps 3 and 4 seem unnecessary. We just need to ensure that we hold orange_block_3 at some point before holding red_block_1, and this is satisfied by steps 1 and 5.

Let's check if this plan satisfies all the constraints:
- orange_block_3 must be on the table at least once during the plan. (Satisfied by step 2)
- red_block_1 must never be on the table. (Satisfied, since we stack it on grey_block_1 in step 6)
- We must hold red_block_1 at least once. (Satisfied by step 5)
- If we hold red_block_1, we must have held orange_block_3 at an earlier point. (Satisfied by the sequence of steps 1 and 5)
- At least once, either green_block_1 is not on the table or grey_block_1 is clear. (Satisfied by the state after step 5, where grey_block_1 is clear)
- At least once, either blue_block_1 is on the table or grey_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1. (Satisfied by step 8, where blue_block_1 is on the table)

But there's still a flaw in our plan. In step 5, we're unstacking red_block_1 from orange_block_2, but then in step 6, we're trying to stack it on grey_block_1. However, after step 5, we're holding red_block_1, and grey_block_1 has orange_block_2 on top of it, so it's not clear. We can't stack red_block_1 on grey_block_1 as described.

I made a mistake in my reasoningâ€”the initial stack of blocks on green_block_1 is:
green_block_1 -> grey_block_1 -> orange_block_2 -> red_block_1

So, let's clarify the plan:

1. Unstack orange_block_3 from blue_block_1.
2. Put orange_block_3 on the table.
3. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_2.
4. Stack red_block_1 on orange_block_1 (to ensure it's never on the table).
5. Unstack orange_block_2 from grey_block_1 (this makes grey_block_1 clear, satisfying one constraint).
6. Unstack blue_block_1 from orange_block_1 (now we're holding blue_block_1, and red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1).
7. Putdown blue_block_1 (now blue_block_1 is on the table, satisfying the constraint).
8. Pickup orange_block_3 from the table.
9. Stack orange_block_3 on top of orange_block_2 (goal achieved).

Now, wait, this plan doesn't work either. After step 3, we're holding red_block_1, and we can't unstack blue_block_1 while we're holding red_block_1. Let's try again.

I am making a mistake in tracing the state consistently. Let me restart and trace the state at each step:

Initial state:
- green_block_1 is on the table with grey_block_1 on top of it.
- orange_block_1 is on the table with blue_block_1 on top of it.
- grey_block_1 has orange_block_2 on top of it.
- orange_block_2 has red_block_1 on top of it.
- blue_block_1 has orange_block_3 on top of it.
- Both red_block_1 and orange_block_3 are clear.
- You are not holding any block.

So, here's the plan:

1. Unstack orange_block_3 from blue_block_1.
   After this: You are holding orange_block_3. blue_block_1 is clear.

2. Putdown orange_block_3.
   After this: orange_block_3 is on the table and clear. You are not holding any block.

3. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_2.
   After this: You are holding red_block_1. orange_block_2 is clear.

4. Stack red_block_1 on blue_block_1.
   After this: red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1. blue_block_1 is no longer clear. You are not holding any block.

5. Unstack orange_block_2 from grey_block_1.
   After this: You are holding orange_block_2. grey_block_1 is clear. (This satisfies the constraint: At least once, either green_block_1 is not on the table or grey_block_1 is clear.)

6. Unstack red_block_1 from blue_block_1.
   After this: You are holding red_block_1. blue_block_1 is clear.

7. Stack red_block_1 on grey_block_1.
   After this: red_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1. grey_block_1 is no longer clear. You are not holding any block.

8. Pickup orange_block_3 from the table.
   After this: You are holding orange_block_3. orange_block_3 is not on the table.

9. Stack orange_block_3 on orange_block_2.
   After this: orange_block_3 is on top of orange_block_2. orange_block_2 is not clear. You are not holding any block.

Let's check the constraints:
- orange_block_3 must be on the table at least once during the plan. (Satisfied by step 2)
- red_block_1 must never be on the table. (Satisfied, since we always stack it on another block)
- We must hold red_block_1 at least once. (Satisfied by steps 3 and 6)
- If we hold red_block_1, we must have held orange_block_3 at an earlier point. (Satisfied by the sequence of steps 1 and 3 for the first holding of red_block_1, and the sequence 1, 6 for the second holding)
- At least once, either green_block_1 is not on the table or grey_block_1 is clear. (Satisfied by the state after step 5, where grey_block_1 is clear)
- At least once, either blue_block_1 is on the table or grey_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1. (This one is not satisfied by our plan)

Ah, I see the issue with the last constraint. Let's adjust the plan to ensure that at least once, either blue_block_1 is on the table or grey_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1.

Okay, let's think about how to satisfy the last constraint. We have two options:
1. Put blue_block_1 on the table.
2. Put grey_block_1 on top of orange_block_1.

Given our current plan, option 1 seems simpler. After we take red_block_1 off blue_block_1 in step 6, we can unstack blue_block_1 from orange_block_1 and put it on the table. But, the issue is, are we ever in a position where blue_block_1 is clear and we're not holding a block? Let's check.

After step A4, red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1, so blue_block_1 is not clear. We'd need to unstack red_block_1 first...

Actually, I'm overcomplicating this. Let's just check the initial state again to see if the constraint is already satisfied. If not, we'll adjust our plan.

Initial state:
blue_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1, so blue_block_1 is not on the table.
grey_block_1 is on top of green_block_1, not orange_block_1.

So, indeed, we need to modify our plan. Here's the adjusted plan:

1. Unstack orange_block_3 from blue_block_1.
   After this: You are holding orange_block_3. blue_block_1 is clear.

2. Putdown orange_block_3.
   After this: orange_block_3 is on the table and clear. You are not holding any block.

3. Unstack blue_block_1 from orange_block_1.
   After this: You are holding blue_block_1. orange_block_1 is clear.

4. Putdown blue_block_1.
   After this: blue_block_1 is on the table and clear. You are not holding any block. (This satisfies the constraint: At least once, either blue_block_1 is on the table or grey_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1.)

5. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_2.
   After this: You are holding red_block_1. orange_block_2 is clear.

6. Stack red_block_1 on blue_block_1.
   After this: red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1. blue_block_1 is no longer clear. You are not holding any block.

7. Unstack orange_block_2 from grey_block_1.
   After this: You are holding orange_block_2. grey_block_1 is clear. (This satisfies the constraint: At least once, either green_block_1 is not on the table or grey_block_1 is clear.)

8. Pickup orange_block_3 from the table.
   After this: You are holding orange_block_3. orange_block_3 is not on the table.

9. Stack orange_block_3 on orange_block_2.
   After this: orange_block_3 is on top of orange_block_2. orange_block_2 is not clear. You are not holding any block. (Goal achieved)

Now, let's check all the constraints again:
- orange_block_3 must be on the table at least once during the plan. (Satisfied by step 2)
- red_block_1 must never be on the table. (Satisfied, since we always stack it on blue_block_1)
- We must hold red_block_1 at least once. (Satisfied by step 5)
- If we hold red_block_1, we must have held orange_block_3 at an earlier point. (Satisfied by the sequence of steps 1 and 5)
- At least once, either green_block_1 is not on the table or grey_block_1 is clear. (Satisfied by the state after step 7, where grey_block_1 is clear)
- At least once, either blue_block_1 is on the table or grey_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1. (Satisfied by step 4, where blue_block_1 is on the table)

Actually, there's a problem: in step 8, after we're already holding orange_block_2, we try to pickup orange_block_3. This isn't possible because we can only hold one block at a time. Let's correct the plan:

1. Unstack orange_block_3 from blue_block_1.
   After this: You are holding orange_block_3. blue_block_1 is clear.

2. Putdown orange_block_3.
   After this: orange_block_3 is on the table and clear. You are not holding any block.

3. Unstack blue_block_1 from orange_block_1.
   After this: You are holding blue_block_1. orange_block_1 is clear.

4. Putdown blue_block_1.
   After this: blue_block_1 is on the table and clear. You are not holding any block. (This satisfies the constraint: At least once, either blue_block_1 is on the table or grey_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1.)

5. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_2.
   After this: You are holding red_block_1. orange_block_2 is clear.

6. Stack red_block_1 on blue_block_1.
   After this: red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1. blue_block_1 is no longer clear. You are not holding any block.

7. Unstack orange_block_2 from grey_block_1.
   After this: You are holding orange_block_2. grey_block_1 is clear. (This satisfies the constraint: At least once, either green_block_1 is not on the table or grey_block_1 is clear.)

8. Putdown orange_block_2.
   After this: orange_block_2 is on the table and clear. You are not holding any block.

9. Pickup orange_block_3 from the table.
   After this: You are holding orange_block_3. orange_block_3 is not on the table.

10. Stack orange_block_3 on orange_block_2.
    After this: orange_block_3 is on top of orange_block_2. orange_block_2 is not clear. You are not holding any block. (Goal achieved)

I think this plan is correct now. But let me recheck the constraints to ensure:
- orange_block_3 must be on the table at least once during the plan. (Satisfied by step 2)
- red_block_1 must never be on the table. (Satisfied, since we always stack it on blue_block_1)
- We must hold red_block_1 at least once. (Satisfied by step 5)
- If we hold red_block_1, we must have held orange_block_3 at an earlier point. (Satisfied by the sequence of steps 1 and 5)
- At least once, either green_block_1 is not on the table or grey_block_1 is clear. (Satisfied by the state after step 7, where grey_block_1 is clear)
- At least once, either blue_block_1 is on the table or grey_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1. (Satisfied by step 4, where blue_block_1 is on the table)

Alright, I believe this plan correctly achieves the goal while satisfying all the constraints. Here's the final plan (in command form):

1. unstack orange_block_3 blue_block_1
2. putdown orange_block_3
3. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_1
4. putdown blue_block_1
5. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_2
6. stack red_block_1 blue_block_1
7. unstack orange_block_2 grey_block_1
8. putdown orange_block_2
9. pickup orange_block_3
10. stack orange_block_3 orange_block_2

Now, let's check if this is optimal. Can we achieve the goal with fewer steps?

Our goal is to place orange_block_3 on top of orange_block_2, and to do this, we need to satisfy the constraints. Let's see if we can optimize the plan.

First, consider the constraint: "If expression 'you are holding red_block_1' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which 'you are holding orange_block_3' is true." This suggests that we need to hold orange_block_3 before we ever hold red_block_1, which is what our plan does. This constraint seems to force a specific ordering.

Given the constraints, it seems difficult to further optimize the plan significantly. For example, the constraint that orange_block_3 must be on the table at some point requires at least a putdown action for orange_block_3. Similarly, the constraint about blue_block_1 being on the table means we need to unstack and putdown blue_block_1.

The steps directly related to the goal (unstacking orange_block_3 and orange_block_2, and then stacking orange_block_3 onto orange_block_2) are necessary, and the rest of the steps are there to satisfy the constraints.

However, I'm not entirely convinced that the constraint about blue_block_1 being on the table or grey_block_1 being on top of orange_block_1 can't be satisfied in a more efficient way. Let's re-examine.

If we want grey_block_1 to be on top of orange_block_1, we'd need to unstack grey_block_1 from green_block_1 and then stack it on orange_block_1. However, to do this, we'd first need to remove all the blocks on top of grey_block_1, which means unstacking red_block_1 from orange_block_2 and orange_block_2 from grey_block_1. This doesn't seem more efficient than our approach of putting blue_block_1 on the table.

I think our plan is already pretty efficient, but let's review it once more to ensure there are no redundant steps.

Our goal is: orange_block_3 is on top of orange_block_2.

From the initial state, we have orange_block_3 on top of blue_block_1 and orange_block_2 beneath red_block_1. To place orange_block_3 on top of orange_block_2, we need:
1. Unstack orange_block_3 from blue_block_1.
2. Ensure that red_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2 (thus, we need to unstack red_block_1).
3. Stack orange_block_3 on orange_block_2.

To satisfy the constraint that orange_block_3 must be on the table at least once, we place it on the table after unstacking it. Then, to satisfy the constraint that blue_block_1 must be on the table at least once (or grey_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1), we unstack blue_block_1 and put it on the table.

When we're holding red_block_1 (after unstacking it from orange_block_2), we have to put it somewhere, and we chose blue_block_1 because it's a valid location (it's clear after we put it on the table). This respects the constraint that red_block_1 is never on the table. Then, we unstack orange_block_2 from grey_block_1 (satisfying the constraint that grey_block_1 is clear at least once), and proceed to place orange_block_3 on top of orange_block_2.

I think our plan is indeed optimal. Here's the final list of actions:

1. unstack orange_block_3 blue_block_1
2. putdown orange_block_3
3. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_1
4. putdown blue_block_1
5. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_2
6. stack red_block_1 blue_block_1
7. unstack orange_block_2 grey_block_1
8. putdown orange_block_2
9. pickup orange_block_3
10. stack orange_block_3 orange_block_2
