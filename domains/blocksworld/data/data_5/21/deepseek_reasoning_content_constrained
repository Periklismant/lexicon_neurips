Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. First, I need to understand the initial state and the goal. The initial state has several blocks arranged in specific ways. The goal is to have yellow_block_1 on top of brown_block_1. Plus, there are several constraints that the plan must satisfy. Let's break this down.

Starting with the initial setup:
- grey_block_1 is on the table, with brown_block_1 on top of it, and then grey_block_2 on top of brown_block_1. So the tower is grey_block_1 (table) → brown_block_1 → grey_block_2. Both grey_block_2 and brown_block_1 are clear? Wait, the initial state says grey_block_2 is clear. So yes, nothing is on grey_block_2. But brown_block_1 has grey_block_2 on top, so brown_block_1 is not clear. Wait, no. Wait, the original state says "brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1", and "grey_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1". So the stack is grey_block_1 (table) → brown_block_1 → grey_block_2. Since grey_block_2 is on top, brown_block_1 is not clear. But the initial state also mentions that grey_block_2 is clear. So that's correct. Then, in another stack: purple_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top, and yellow_block_2 on top of yellow_block_1. So the stack is purple_block_1 → yellow_block_1 → yellow_block_2. Also, purple_block_2 is on the table and clear. The arm is empty.

The goal is to have yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1. So we need to move yellow_block_1 from its current position (on purple_block_1, under yellow_block_2) to brown_block_1.

But there's a catch: yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1. So to move yellow_block_1, we first need to remove yellow_block_2. However, one of the constraints is that "yellow_block_2 is not on the table" in every state. Wait, the second constraint says that in every state, yellow_block_2 must not be on the table. So putting yellow_block_2 on the table is not allowed. Therefore, we can't just unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1 and put it down on the table. So how do we handle that? Since the only other option is to stack it on another block. But where?

Let's think. The initial state has purple_block_2 on the table, clear. So perhaps we can stack yellow_block_2 onto purple_block_2. But let's check constraints. Also, there's a constraint that in at least one state, purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1. Wait, the first constraint requires that in some state, purple_block_1 is on brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1. But in the initial state, grey_block_2 is on brown_block_1. So maybe during the plan, we need to move grey_block_2 back to grey_block_1. But that might conflict with other constraints.

Let's outline the steps needed to achieve the goal:

1. Move yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1 to somewhere. Since we can't put it on the table, we need to stack it on another block. The available clear blocks are purple_block_2 (initially clear). So maybe stack yellow_block_2 onto purple_block_2.

But to do that, we need to unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. The preconditions for unstack are that yellow_block_2 is on yellow_block_1, yellow_block_2 is clear (which it is, since nothing is on top of it in the initial state), and the arm is empty. So first action could be unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1. Then stack it onto purple_block_2.

But after unstacking yellow_block_2, we're holding it. Then stack it on purple_block_2 (which is clear). That would work. So:

unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1

stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2

After this, yellow_block_1 is clear, so we can pick it up. But wait, yellow_block_1 is on purple_block_1. To pick it up, we need to pick it up from the table. Wait, no. Wait, yellow_block_1 is on purple_block_1, which is on the table. So to pick up yellow_block_1, since it's on purple_block_1, which is on the table, we can't use the pickup action. Because pickup requires the block to be on the table. So instead, we need to unstack yellow_block_1 from purple_block_1. But wait, yellow_block_1 is under yellow_block_2. Wait, in the initial state, the stack is purple_block_1 (table) → yellow_block_1 → yellow_block_2. So to get to yellow_block_1, we first have to unstack yellow_block_2. Which we did in the previous step.

Wait, after unstacking yellow_block_2 and stacking it on purple_block_2, yellow_block_1 is now clear. So we can unstack yellow_block_1 from purple_block_1. Wait, no. The unstack action is for when a block is on top of another. So since yellow_block_1 is on purple_block_1, to unstack yellow_block_1 from purple_block_1, the preconditions are that yellow_block_1 is clear (which it is after moving yellow_block_2), and that the arm is empty. But after stacking yellow_block_2, the arm is empty. So next step would be:

unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1

Then, we need to stack yellow_block_1 onto brown_block_1. But brown_block_1 is currently under grey_block_2. So brown_block_1 is not clear. So to stack something onto brown_block_1, we need to first make it clear. That means moving grey_block_2 off of brown_block_1.

So the stack is grey_block_1 → brown_block_1 → grey_block_2. To get grey_block_2 off, we can unstack it. Since grey_block_2 is clear, and the arm is empty (after stacking yellow_block_2), we can unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1.

So steps so far:

1. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1

2. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2

3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1

But where to put grey_block_2? Since the first constraint requires that at some point, grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1. So maybe we can stack grey_block_2 onto grey_block_1. But grey_block_1 is currently under brown_block_1. Wait, grey_block_1 is on the table. So in the initial state, grey_block_1 has brown_block_1 on top. So grey_block_1 is not clear. So to stack grey_block_2 onto grey_block_1, we need grey_block_1 to be clear. Which would require moving brown_block_1 off of grey_block_1. But brown_block_1 is under grey_block_2. So this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can put grey_block_2 on the table. But let's check the constraints. The seventh constraint says that in at least one state, brown_block_1 is not on the table. Currently, brown_block_1 is on grey_block_1, which is on the table, so brown_block_1 is not on the table. So that constraint is already satisfied in the initial state. Wait, but the initial state has brown_block_1 on grey_block_1, so brown_block_1 is not on the table. So the seventh constraint is already met. Wait, but the seventh constraint says that "brown_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in at least one state. Since it's true in the initial state, that's okay. But we need to make sure that if in some state s, brown_block_1 is not on the table, then in s or a later state, there's a block on top of purple_block_1. So in the initial state, purple_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on top. So purple_block_1 is not clear. Wait, no. The initial state says purple_block_1 is on the table, yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1. So purple_block_1 is not clear. So in the initial state, the condition "there is a block on top of purple_block_1" is already true. So if we have a state where brown_block_1 is not on the table (like the initial state), then the eighth constraint is satisfied because purple_block_1 has a block on top. So that's okay.

But let's get back to moving grey_block_2. After step 3, unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1, the arm is holding grey_block_2. We need to place it somewhere. The options are to stack it on another block or put it on the table. Putting it on the table would require a putdown action. But when we putdown a block, it becomes clear. But the first constraint requires that in some state, grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1. So maybe we need to stack grey_block_2 onto grey_block_1. But to stack it on grey_block_1, grey_block_1 must be clear. But initially, grey_block_1 has brown_block_1 on top. So we need to first move brown_block_1 off of grey_block_1. But brown_block_1 is under grey_block_2. Wait, in the initial state, brown_block_1 is on grey_block_1, and grey_block_2 is on brown_block_1. So after unstacking grey_block_2, brown_block_1 is now clear. So if we unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1, but wait, brown_block_1 is on the table? No, brown_block_1 is on grey_block_1, which is on the table. So to pick up brown_block_1, we need to unstack it from grey_block_1. But brown_block_1 has grey_block_2 on top in the initial state. Wait, after step 3, we unstacked grey_block_2 from brown_block_1, so brown_block_1 is now clear. So then we can unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1.

But why would we need to do that? Our goal is to place yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1. So brown_block_1 is currently on grey_block_1. We need to have yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1. So maybe we can stack yellow_block_1 onto brown_block_1 directly if brown_block_1 is clear. But after moving grey_block_2 off, brown_block_1 is clear.

Wait, let me retrace:

Original stack: grey_block_1 (table) → brown_block_1 → grey_block_2.

After step 3: unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1, we have grey_block_2 in the arm. Then, we can put it down or stack it somewhere. If we put it on the table, then the first constraint (grey_block_2 on grey_block_1) is not met. So perhaps we need to stack it on grey_block_1. But grey_block_1 is under brown_block_1. Wait, grey_block_1 is on the table, with brown_block_1 on top. So to stack grey_block_2 onto grey_block_1, we need grey_block_1 to be clear. But it's not; brown_block_1 is on it. So that's a problem.

Alternative approach: maybe after moving grey_block_2, we need to place it on another block so that later we can move brown_block_1 to achieve the first constraint. Let's think. The first constraint requires that in some state, purple_block_1 is on brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1. So we need to have purple_block_1 on brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 on grey_block_1. Let's see:

To get purple_block_1 onto brown_block_1, we need to move it from its current position (on the table with yellow_block_1 on top) to brown_block_1. But wait, purple_block_1 is on the table. To stack purple_block_1 onto brown_block_1, we need to pick it up (since it's on the table), but purple_block_1 is under yellow_block_1. Wait, initial state: purple_block_1 is on the table, yellow_block_1 is on top of it, and yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1. So to get purple_block_1, we need to first remove yellow_block_1 and yellow_block_2. But we already moved yellow_block_2 to purple_block_2. Then we moved yellow_block_1 to... Well, we need to move yellow_block_1 to brown_block_1. But to do that, we need brown_block_1 to be clear. So let's proceed.

After step 3 (unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1), the arm is holding grey_block_2. Let's say we put it on the table. But that would violate the first constraint's requirement for grey_block_2 being on grey_block_1. So instead, maybe we need to stack grey_block_2 onto grey_block_1. But grey_block_1 is not clear (has brown_block_1 on it). So to do that, we need to first remove brown_block_1 from grey_block_1. So steps would be:

4. putdown grey_block_2 (temporarily, but we can't because the first constraint requires grey_block_2 to be on grey_block_1. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe we can stack grey_block_2 onto purple_block_1? But purple_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on it, which we need to move. Let's think.

Alternatively, after step 3, maybe we can stack grey_block_2 onto grey_block_1. But as mentioned, grey_block_1 is under brown_block_1. So that's not possible. So perhaps we need to first move brown_block_1 off of grey_block_1. To do that, we need to unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1. But brown_block_1 is currently clear (since we removed grey_block_2). So we can unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1. Then put it somewhere. But where? Maybe on the table? Wait, but if we put brown_block_1 on the table, then the first constraint's condition of purple_block_1 being on brown_block_1 would require moving purple_block_1 onto it. But purple_block_1 is on the table, so to stack it onto brown_block_1, we need to pick up purple_block_1, which is under yellow_block_1. So perhaps we need to first move yellow_block_1, then purple_block_1.

This is getting complex. Let's outline the steps again:

Goal: yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1.

Constraints:

1. At least once: purple_block_1 on brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 on grey_block_1.

2. Always: yellow_block_2 not on the table.

3. At least once: holding yellow_block_1.

4. If holding yellow_block_1 in some state, then in an earlier state, either purple_block_2 is not on the table or holding purple_block_2.

5. At least once: brown_block_1 has a block on top (not clear).

6. If brown_block_1 is not clear in state s, then in s or after, either brown_block_1 is clear or holding grey_block_2.

7. At least once: brown_block_1 not on table (already true initially).

8. If brown_block_1 is not on table in s, then in s or after, purple_block_1 is not clear.

So the plan must satisfy all these.

Let's start by handling constraint 3 and 4. We need to hold yellow_block_1 at least once, and before that, either have purple_block_2 not on the table (i.e., on a block) or hold purple_block_2. Currently, purple_block_2 is on the table. So to satisfy this, before holding yellow_block_1, we need to either pick up purple_block_2 (making it not on the table) or stack it on something.

But how does that connect to moving yellow_block_1? Let's see.

So to hold yellow_block_1, we need to unstack it from purple_block_1. But before that, we need to unstack yellow_block_2 from it. So steps:

1. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1 → holding yellow_block_2.

But constraint 2 says yellow_block_2 can't be on the table in any state. So we need to stack it somewhere. The possible target is purple_block_2, which is clear.

2. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2 → now, purple_block_2 has yellow_block_2 on top. Now, yellow_block_1 is clear.

3. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1 → holding yellow_block_1. But before this step, we need to have either purple_block_2 not on the table or holding purple_block_2. At step 3, when we unstack yellow_block_1, we are holding it. The precondition for unstack is that the arm is empty. Wait, no. The unstack action is for when you pick up a block that's on top of another. So the preconditions for unstack x y are that x is on y, x is clear, and arm is empty. So step 3 would be unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1. But before that, we have to ensure that step 4's constraint is met.

Wait, constraint 4 says that if in some state we are holding yellow_block_1, there must be an earlier state where either purple_block_2 is not on the table or we are holding purple_block_2. So before step 3 (where we hold yellow_block_1), we need to have either moved purple_block_2 (so it's not on the table) or held it. So maybe before step 3, we need to move purple_block_2. But purple_block_2 is on the table initially. So we need to pick it up or stack something on it. Since we can't put yellow_block_2 on the table, but we did stack it on purple_block_2 in step 2. So after step 2, purple_block_2 is not on the table anymore? Wait, no. Stacking a block on another doesn't move the base block. Purple_block_2 is on the table, and after stacking yellow_block_2 on it, purple_block_2 is still on the table. So purple_block_2 remains on the table. So in step 2, when we stack yellow_block_2 on purple_block_2, purple_block_2 is still on the table, but now has yellow_block_2 on top. So in step 3, when we unstack yellow_block_1, we need to have in an earlier state (before step 3) that either purple_block_2 is not on the table (which it's still on the table, so that's not true) or we were holding purple_block_2. So we need to have an action where we pick up purple_block_2 before step 3.

Alternatively, if we stack something onto purple_block_2, then purple_block_2 is not on the table? No, stacking on it doesn't change its position. So the only way to make purple_block_2 not on the table is to pick it up. But that's not possible because it's on the table and clear. Wait, but purple_block_2 is clear in the initial state, so we can pick it up. So maybe before step 3, we need to pick up purple_block_2 and then put it down again. But that might complicate the plan. Let's see:

Alternative approach:

Step 1: pickup purple_block_2 (since it's on the table and clear). Then putdown purple_block_2. This would satisfy the condition that in an earlier state, we held purple_block_2, which would satisfy constraint 4 when we later hold yellow_block_1. But this adds extra steps. Let's see.

But after step 1: pickup purple_block_2. Now, the arm holds it. Then step 2: putdown purple_block_2. Now, purple_block_2 is back on the table. Then proceed to move yellow_block_2. But this might not be optimal. However, the plan needs to be optimal in steps. But perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think.

Alternatively, when we stack yellow_block_2 onto purple_block_2 in step 2, then purple_block_2 is still on the table. So to satisfy constraint 4, before unstacking yellow_block_1 (step 3), we need to have an action where purple_block_2 is not on the table or we held it. Since stacking yellow_block_2 on purple_block_2 doesn't take purple_block_2 off the table, maybe we need to hold purple_block_2 before step 3. So:

Step 0: pickup purple_block_2 (preconditions: it's on the table, clear, arm empty). Then put it down again. But that's two steps. Then proceed with moving yellow_block_2 and yellow_block_1. But this would add steps, making the plan longer. However, maybe it's necessary.

Alternatively, after stacking yellow_block_2 on purple_block_2 (step 2), can we then pick up purple_block_2? Because purple_block_2 has yellow_block_2 on top. To pick up purple_block_2, we need it to be clear, which it's not (yellow_block_2 is on it). So we can't pick it up. Therefore, the only way to satisfy constraint 4 is to hold purple_block_2 before step 3. So steps would be:

1. pickup purple_block_2

2. putdown purple_block_2

3. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1

4. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2

5. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1 → now, we are holding yellow_block_1, and before that, in step 1, we held purple_block_2. So constraint 4 is satisfied.

But this adds steps 1 and 2. Is there a way to avoid that? Maybe not. Because otherwise, after step 3 (unstack yellow_block_1), we are holding it, but before that, we need to have had purple_block_2 not on the table or held it. Since in step 3's previous steps, we only stacked yellow_block_2 on purple_block_2, which doesn't move purple_block_2 from the table. So unless we can find another way.

Alternatively, if we can stack purple_block_2 onto another block, but that would require moving it. But initially, it's on the table. So to stack it, we need to pick it up. So:

1. pickup purple_block_2

2. stack purple_block_2 onto some block, say grey_block_1. But grey_block_1 has brown_block_1 on it. So we can't stack purple_block_2 on grey_block_1 unless grey_block_1 is clear. Which requires moving brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 first. Which complicates things.

Alternatively, stack purple_block_2 onto itself? No. So maybe steps 1 and 2 are necessary to satisfy constraint 4.

But this is adding steps, which might not be optimal. But perhaps it's necessary.

Alternatively, maybe after stacking yellow_block_2 onto purple_block_2, purple_block_2 is not on the table. Wait, no. Stacking a block on top of purple_block_2 doesn't move purple_block_2; it's still on the table. So purple_block_2 remains on the table. Therefore, the only way to make it not on the table is to pick it up. So we need to pick it up and then put it somewhere else. But that takes steps. So perhaps steps 1 and 2 are unavoidable.

Alternatively, is there a way to satisfy constraint 4 without explicitly picking up purple_block_2? Let's see. The constraint says that if we hold yellow_block_1 in some state, then there must be an earlier state where either purple_block_2 is not on the table or we held purple_block_2. So if in some state before holding yellow_block_1, purple_block_2 was not on the table, then that's sufficient. But how? Since initially, purple_block_2 is on the table. The only way it's not on the table is if it's picked up. So unless we stack something on it, but stacking on it doesn't move it. So it's still on the table. Therefore, the only way is to pick it up. So steps 1 and 2 are necessary.

But maybe there's a smarter way. Let's see. After stacking yellow_block_2 on purple_block_2 (step 2), purple_block_2 has yellow_block_2 on top. So purple_block_2 is not clear. If we then unstack yellow_block_2 from purple_block_2, we can hold yellow_block_2 again. But we need to find a place to put it. But we can't put it on the table. So we need to stack it somewhere else. But this seems to complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps during the plan, after stacking yellow_block_2 on purple_block_2, we can then pick up purple_block_2. But since purple_block_2 has yellow_block_2 on top, we can't pick it up. So this approach won't work.

Therefore, the only way to satisfy constraint 4 is to pick up purple_block_2 before unstacking yellow_block_1. So steps:

1. pickup purple_block_2 → now holding it.

2. putdown purple_block_2 → back on the table. Now, we've held purple_block_2 in step 1, which satisfies the requirement that before holding yellow_block_1 (step 5), we have held purple_block_2.

Then proceed:

3. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1 → hold yellow_block_2.

4. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2 → yellow_block_2 is on purple_block_2, arm empty.

5. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1 → hold yellow_block_1. Now, constraint 3 is satisfied (holding yellow_block_1), and constraint 4 is satisfied because we held purple_block_2 in step 1.

Next, we need to stack yellow_block_1 onto brown_block_1. But brown_block_1 is currently under grey_block_2. Wait, no. Wait, initial state: brown_block_1 is on grey_block_1, grey_block_2 is on brown_block_1. After step 3: unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1? No. Wait, step 3 here is unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. Wait, I think I'm mixing up steps.

Wait, let's retrace the steps again with the new steps:

Steps:

1. pickup purple_block_2 → holding purple_block_2.

2. putdown purple_block_2 → purple_block_2 is back on the table. Now, arm is empty.

3. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1 → holding yellow_block_2.

4. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2 → yellow_block_2 is on purple_block_2. Arm is empty.

5. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1 → holding yellow_block_1.

Now, to stack yellow_block_1 onto brown_block_1, we need to make sure that brown_block_1 is clear. In the initial state, brown_block_1 is under grey_block_2. But in step 3, we only moved yellow_block_2. So grey_block_2 is still on brown_block_1. So brown_block_1 is not clear. Therefore, we need to unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1.

But how?

After step 5, the arm is holding yellow_block_1. We need to put that down first to free the arm to unstack grey_block_2.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Let's outline:

After step 5, we're holding yellow_block_1. To stack it onto brown_block_1, we need brown_block_1 to be clear. But currently, brown_block_1 has grey_block_2 on top. So we need to move grey_block_2. So:

6. putdown yellow_block_1 → places it on the table. Now, yellow_block_1 is on the table, clear. Arm is empty.

7. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1 → holding grey_block_2.

8. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 → now, grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1. This satisfies part of the first constraint (grey_block_2 on grey_block_1).

Now, brown_block_1 is clear. So we can pick up yellow_block_1 again (if needed) or proceed.

Wait, but after step 6, yellow_block_1 is on the table. To stack it onto brown_block_1, we need to pick it up again. So:

9. pickup yellow_block_1 → arm is holding it.

10. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1 → which is now clear. This achieves the goal.

But now, we need to check if all constraints are met.

Let's check constraint 1: in some state, purple_block_1 is on brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1. In step 8, grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1. But purple_block_1 is on the table. So we need to have purple_block_1 on brown_block_1. How to do that? 

To do that, we need to move purple_block_1 onto brown_block_1. But purple_block_1 is currently on the table, and yellow_block_1 was on it. After step 5, we unstacked yellow_block_1 from purple_block_1, so purple_block_1 is now clear. So we can pickup purple_block_1.

But in our current plan steps, after step 8, purple_block_1 is still on the table. So perhaps we need to stack it onto brown_block_1.

So after step 8:

9. pickup purple_block_1 → holding it.

10. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1 → now, purple_block_1 is on brown_block_1. This satisfies the other part of constraint 1.

Then, we need to proceed to stack yellow_block_1 onto brown_block_1, but now brown_block_1 has purple_block_1 on top. So we need to move purple_block_1 again. This complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 8, we can stack purple_block_1 onto brown_block_1, then proceed to stack yellow_block_1 on top of purple_block_1. But the goal is to have yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1. So that wouldn't work.

This is getting too long. Let's try to adjust the plan to include moving purple_block_1 onto brown_block_1 to satisfy constraint 1.

Alternatively, after step 8, we can:

9. pickup purple_block_1.

10. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1.

Now, constraint 1 is satisfied in step 10: purple_block_1 is on brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1 (from step 8). Then, we need to move purple_block_1 again to allow yellow_block_1 to be on brown_block_1. But that's more steps. However, the plan must be optimal. This seems like a lot of steps.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a more efficient way. Let's consider integrating the necessary steps.

Let's outline the entire plan with all constraints in mind:

Steps:

1. pickup purple_block_2 → to satisfy constraint 4.

2. putdown purple_block_2 → now, purple_block_2 is on the table. Arm empty.

3. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1 → hold yellow_block_2.

4. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2 → arm empty.

5. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1 → hold yellow_block_1. Constraint 3 met here.

6. putdown yellow_block_1 → arm empty.

7. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1 → hold grey_block_2.

8. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 → grey_block_2 on grey_block_1. Part of constraint 1.

9. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold brown_block_1.

10. stack brown_block_1 purple_block_1 → now, brown_block_1 is on purple_block_1. But this may not help.

Wait, but the goal is to have yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1. So perhaps after moving brown_block_1 to purple_block_1, we can stack yellow_block_1 on top.

But this is getting too convoluted. Let's try a different approach.

Alternative plan:

We need to achieve the goal and satisfy all constraints. Let's focus on the first constraint: at least once, purple_block_1 on brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 on grey_block_1. So we need to have both these conditions in some state.

Currently, grey_block_2 is on brown_block_1 (initial state). To get it on grey_block_1, we need to move it there. So:

- Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1.

- Stack grey_block_2 on grey_block_1.

But grey_block_1 has brown_block_1 on it. So first, we need to unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1.

But brown_block_1 has grey_block_2 on it. So:

1. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1 → hold grey_block_2.

2. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 → but grey_block_1 has brown_block_1 on it, which is not clear. So this is not possible. So we need to unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1 first.

But brown_block_1 is under grey_block_2. So:

1. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1 → hold grey_block_2.

2. putdown grey_block_2 → now, grey_block_2 is on the table. But this violates the first constraint's requirement for grey_block_2 on grey_block_1. So we need to find another way.

Alternative:

1. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1 → hold grey_block_2.

2. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold brown_block_1.

3. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 → grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1. Now, constraint 1's grey_block_2 part is met.

4. stack brown_block_1 purple_block_1 → now, brown_block_1 is on purple_block_1. This would allow purple_block_1 to be on brown_block_1 if we later move it. But no. Wait, purple_block_1 is under brown_block_1. To have purple_block_1 on brown_block_1, we need to move purple_block_1 on top of brown_block_1. But purple_block_1 is currently on the table. So after step 4, brown_block_1 is on purple_block_1. So to move purple_block_1 onto brown_block_1, we need to first move brown_block_1 elsewhere. This is getting complicated.

Alternatively, after step 3, grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1, and we have brown_block_1 in hand. We can stack brown_block_1 on grey_block_2. Then, purple_block_1 can be stacked on brown_block_1.

But this seems to deviate from the goal. The goal is to have yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1. So perhaps after setting up the first constraint, we can proceed to move yellow_block_1.

This is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to outline a possible valid plan that meets all constraints, even if it's not the shortest.

Plan steps:

1. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1 → hold yellow_block_2.

2. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2 → arm empty. Now, yellow_block_1 is clear.

3. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1 → hold yellow_block_1. (Constraint 3 met here.)

But before step 3, we need to satisfy constraint 4. So steps 0-2 would need to include holding purple_block_2 or moving it.

So inserting:

0. pickup purple_block_2 → hold.

1. putdown purple_block_2 → arm empty.

Then proceed with original steps 1-3 as:

2. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1 → hold.

3. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2 → arm empty.

4. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1 → hold.

Now, constraint 4 is satisfied because step 0 involved holding purple_block_2.

Then, to stack yellow_block_1 onto brown_block_1, we need to make brown_block_1 clear. So:

5. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1 → hold grey_block_2.

6. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 → requires grey_block_1 to be clear. But grey_block_1 has brown_block_1 on it. So need to first unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1.

But brown_block_1 is under grey_block_2. After step 5, grey_block_2 is removed, so brown_block_1 is clear.

Wait, after step 5: unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1 → brown_block_1 is clear. So:

5. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1 → hold grey_block_2.

6. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 → but grey_block_1 has brown_block_1 on it. So can't stack grey_block_2 on grey_block_1 unless brown_block_1 is moved.

So need to first move brown_block_1.

7. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold brown_block_1.

8. putdown brown_block_1 → on the table. But constraint 7 requires that brown_block_1 is not on the table in at least one state. But initially, it wasn't. Putting it on the table would make it on the table, which doesn't violate the constraint since the constraint is "at least one state". However, the eighth constraint says that if in some state s, brown_block_1 is not on the table, then in s or after, purple_block_1 is not clear. Initially, purple_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on top. After step 4, yellow_block_1 is unstacked, so purple_block_1 is clear. So if we move brown_block_1 back to grey_block_1 after putting it down, we might trigger the eighth constraint. This is getting too complicated.

Alternative plan after step 5 (hold grey_block_2):

6. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 → but grey_block_1 has brown_block_1 on it. So not possible. So instead, put grey_block_2 on the table. But this would violate the first constraint's need for grey_block_2 to be on grey_block_1. So this is not acceptable.

Hmm. Maybe we need to first move brown_block_1 off grey_block_1.

But to do that, we need to unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1. Which requires that brown_block_1 is clear. But initially, it has grey_block_2 on top. So first, unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1.

So:

0. pickup purple_block_2 → hold.

1. putdown purple_block_2 → arm empty.

2. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1 → hold.

3. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2 → arm empty.

4. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1 → hold.

5. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1 → hold.

6. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 → no, can't, because grey_block_1 has brown_block_1. So instead:

6. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold.

7. stack brown_block_1 grey_block_1 → but why? This doesn't help.

Alternative:

6. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 → impossible. So putdown grey_block_2.

7. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold.

8. stack brown_block_1 grey_block_2 → stack brown_block_1 onto grey_block_2 (which is on the table now).

9. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 → now, grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1.

But this is getting too long. This approach might not be optimal.

At this point, I'm realizing that this problem requires a carefully crafted sequence that meets all constraints while achieving the goal. Let's try to outline the steps again, focusing on the key points:

- To get yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1, we need to clear brown_block_1 and then stack yellow_block_1 on it.

- To clear brown_block_1, we need to unstack grey_block_2 from it.

- After moving grey_block_2, we need to place it on grey_block_1 to satisfy the first constraint.

- To place grey_block_2 on grey_block_1, we need to clear grey_block_1, which involves moving brown_block_1.

- Moving brown_block_1 requires unstacking it from grey_block_1, which can only be done after removing grey_block_2.

So the steps would be:

1. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1 → hold grey_block_2.

2. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold brown_block_1.

3. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 → now grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1.

4. stack brown_block_1 grey_block_2 → brown_block_1 is on grey_block_2. Now, the tower is grey_block_1 → grey_block_2 → brown_block_1.

But now, we need to stack yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1. So we need to make brown_block_1 clear again. But brown_block_1 is now under nothing. Wait, no: brown_block_1 is on grey_block_2, which is on grey_block_1. So brown_block_1 is clear. So we can stack yellow_block_1 on it.

But to stack yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1, we need to have it in hand. So steps:

5. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1 → hold yellow_block_2.

6. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2 → arm empty.

7. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1 → hold yellow_block_1.

8. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1 → goal achieved.

But we need to check constraints.

Constraint 1: in some state, purple_block_1 on brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 on grey_block_1. So far, grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1 (step 3), but purple_block_1 is not on brown_block_1. So we need to also move purple_block_1 onto brown_block_1 at some point.

But this adds steps. To satisfy constraint 1:

After step 4, brown_block_1 is on grey_block_2. We need to move purple_block_1 onto brown_block_1. So:

9. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_2 → hold brown_block_1.

10. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1 → now, purple_block_1 is on brown_block_1.

But this would mean purple_block_1 is on brown_block_1, and grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1 (step 3). So constraint 1 is met in step 10.

But then, we need to put brown_block_1 somewhere else to stack yellow_block_1 on it. This complicates the plan further.

This seems too long. However, given the constraints, it's necessary. But the problem requires an optimal plan, which is as short as possible.

Alternative approach: perhaps stack purple_block_1 onto brown_block_1 while brown_block_1 is still on grey_block_1.

Wait, after step 2 (unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1), brown_block_1 is in hand. Then, we can stack purple_block_1 onto brown_block_1:

3. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1 → but purple_block_1 is on the table. To stack it, we need to pick it up. So:

3. unstack purple_block_1 ... wait, purple_block_1 is on the table, but has yellow_block_1 on top. So we need to first move yellow_block_1.

But this is getting too tangled.

I think the optimal plan would involve moving grey_block_2 to grey_block_1 and purple_block_1 to brown_block_1 at some point, but integrating this into the steps needed for the goal.

After several iterations, here's a possible plan:

```
```
unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2
unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1
```
```

But let's check the constraints:

Constraint 1: purple_block_1 on brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 on grey_block_1. This plan doesn't move purple_block_1, so it's not satisfied. So this plan is invalid.

Alternative plan:

```
```
pickup purple_block_2
putdown purple_block_2
unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2
unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1
```
```

This plan includes holding purple_block_2 first (steps 1-2), which satisfies constraint 4. Then proceeds to move yellow_block_2 and yellow_block_1. Steps 6-7 move grey_block_2 to grey_block_1, satisfying part of constraint 1. But purple_block_1 is not on brown_block_1, so constraint 1 isn't fully satisfied. So we need an additional step to move purple_block_1 onto brown_block_1.

But how?

After step 7, grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1. Then:

8. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold brown_block_1.

9. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1 → hold purple_block_1.

But purple_block_1 is on the table. To stack it onto brown_block_1, we need to pick it up. So:

8. pickup purple_block_1.

9. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1.

Now, constraint 1 is satisfied in step 9. Then, we need to stack yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1, but now brown_block_1 has purple_block_1 on top. So we need to unstack purple_block_1 first, which adds steps.

This is getting very long. The optimal plan must have the minimal steps. Perhaps there's a way to merge some steps.

Final approach:

To satisfy all constraints and achieve the goal, the plan must include:

- Moving grey_block_2 to grey_block_1.

- Moving purple_block_1 to brown_block_1.

- Moving yellow_block_1 to brown_block_1.

But how to interleave these steps.

Here's a possible plan:

1. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1 → hold yellow_block_2.

2. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2 → arm empty. (Satisfies constraint 2.)

3. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1 → hold yellow_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 3.)

4. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1 → hold grey_block_2.

5. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 → now, grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1. (Part of constraint 1.)

6. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold brown_block_1.

7. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1 → purple_block_1 is on brown_block_1. (Completes constraint 1.)

8. stack brown_block_1 grey_block_2 → brown_block_1 is on grey_block_2. Now, brown_block_1 is clear again.

9. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1 → goal achieved.

But this has multiple steps. Let's check constraints:

- Constraint 1: steps 5 and 7 achieve the required conditions.

- Constraint 2: yellow_block_2 is never on the table.

- Constraint 3: step 3 holds yellow_block_1.

- Constraint 4: before step 3, we need to have held purple_block_2 or have it not on the table. But in this plan, we have not held purple_block_2. So this plan would violate constraint 4. Therefore, steps 0 and 1 need to include picking up purple_block_2.

Revised plan:

0. pickup purple_block_2 → hold.

1. putdown purple_block_2 → arm empty.

2. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1 → hold yellow_block_2.

3. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2 → arm empty.

4. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1 → hold yellow_block_1.

5. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1 → hold grey_block_2.

6. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 → arm empty.

7. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold brown_block_1.

8. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1 → arm empty.

9. stack brown_block_1 grey_block_2 → arm empty.

10. pickup yellow_block_1 → hold.

11. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1 → goal achieved.

This plan includes steps 0-1 to handle constraint 4. But this plan is 12 steps, which may not be optimal. However, given the constraints, it's necessary.

But perhaps there's a shorter way. For example, after step 3 (stack yellow_block_2 on purple_block_2), purple_block_2 is still on the table. So to satisfy constraint 4, we need to have held purple_block_2 before step 4. Therefore, steps 0 and 1 are necessary.

Another possible optimization: after step 5 (hold grey_block_2), instead of stacking it on grey_block_1 immediately, first move brown_block_1.

But time is limited. I think this is the best possible plan given the constraints.
