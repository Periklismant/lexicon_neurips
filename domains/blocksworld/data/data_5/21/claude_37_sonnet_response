Let's analyze this blocksworld planning problem. I need to find an optimal (shortest) valid plan that achieves the goal while satisfying all the constraints.

First, let's understand the initial state:
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- purple_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1
- grey_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1
- purple_block_2 is on the table
- grey_block_2, yellow_block_2, and purple_block_2 are clear
- I'm not holding any block

The goal is:
- yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1

Now, let's understand the constraints:
1. At some point: "purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1" AND "grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1"
2. In every state: "yellow_block_2 is not on the table"
3. At some point: "you are holding yellow_block_1"
4. If constraint 3 holds, then earlier: "purple_block_2 is not on the table" OR "you are holding purple_block_2"
5. At some point: "brown_block_1 is not clear"
6. If constraint 5 holds, then at the same time or later: "brown_block_1 is clear" OR "you are holding grey_block_2"
7. At some point: "brown_block_1 is not on the table"
8. If constraint 7 holds, then at the same time or later: "purple_block_1 is not clear"

To visualize the initial state:
```
   grey_block_2      yellow_block_2
        |                  |
   brown_block_1      yellow_block_1
        |                  |
   grey_block_1       purple_block_1    purple_block_2
   -------------------------------------------------
                       table
```

And the goal state requires:
```
   yellow_block_1
        |
   brown_block_1
        ?
```

Let's start planning:

1. I need to eventually have yellow_block_1 on top of brown_block_1.
2. From the initial state, I can see that yellow_block_1 is underneath yellow_block_2, and brown_block_1 has grey_block_2 on top.
3. I need to make sure all constraints are satisfied.

Let's first think about how to satisfy constraint 1: At some point, "purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1" AND "grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1". 

In the initial state, brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1, so I'd need to move brown_block_1 off before I can place grey_block_2 on grey_block_1. But then I'd also need to place purple_block_1 on brown_block_1.

For constraint 2: "yellow_block_2 is not on the table" must hold in every state. This means I can never put yellow_block_2 on the table. I need to ensure it's always on top of another block or held by me.

For constraint 3: I need to hold yellow_block_1 at some point.

For constraint 4: Before holding yellow_block_1, I need to ensure that either purple_block_2 is not on the table or I'm holding purple_block_2.

For constraint 5: brown_block_1 needs to have a block on top of it at some point.

For constraint 6: If brown_block_1 has a block on top, then at the same time or later, brown_block_1 should be clear or I should be holding grey_block_2.

For constraint 7: brown_block_1 should not be on the table at some point.

For constraint 8: If brown_block_1 is not on the table, then at the same time or later, purple_block_1 should have a block on top.

Now, let's try to devise a plan:

1. Initially, brown_block_1 already has grey_block_2 on top, so constraint 5 is already satisfied.
2. In the initial state, brown_block_1 is not on the table, so constraint 7 is already satisfied.
3. According to constraint 8, after or at the time when brown_block_1 is not on the table, purple_block_1 should not be clear. In the initial state, yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1, so this constraint is already satisfied.
4. According to constraint 6, after or at the time when brown_block_1 is not clear, brown_block_1 should be clear or I should be holding grey_block_2. So, I need to unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1 at some point.
5. To achieve constraint 1, I need to put purple_block_1 on top of brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 on top of grey_block_1 at the same state.
6. To achieve the goal, I need to put yellow_block_1 on top of brown_block_1.

Let's construct a plan step by step:

From the initial state, I want to satisfy constraint 4, which means I need to have purple_block_2 off the table or hold purple_block_2 before holding yellow_block_1. I'll first pick up purple_block_2 (which is clear and on the table).

1. pickup purple_block_2

Now, I need a place to put purple_block_2. I can't put it on the table (as that would violate constraint 4), so I'll put it on one of the clear blocks: grey_block_2, yellow_block_2, or itself (if I put it down first). Let's choose yellow_block_2.

2. stack purple_block_2 yellow_block_2

Now, to satisfy constraint 1, I need to have purple_block_1 on top of brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 on top of grey_block_1. First, I need to clear both brown_block_1 and grey_block_1. grey_block_1 is already clear, and to clear brown_block_1, I need to unstack grey_block_2.

3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1

Now, I need to place grey_block_2 on grey_block_1 to partially satisfy constraint 1.

4. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1

Next, to satisfy the other part of constraint 1, I need to place purple_block_1 on brown_block_1. But purple_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on top, which has yellow_block_2 on top, which now has purple_block_2 on top. So, I need to first unstack these.

5. unstack purple_block_2 yellow_block_2
6. stack purple_block_2 grey_block_2 (to ensure it's not on the table)
7. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
8. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2 (to ensure it's not on the table)
9. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1

Now, I can satisfy constraint 3 by holding yellow_block_1, and I've already held purple_block_2 earlier, so constraint 4 is satisfied.

10. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1 (this will achieve the goal)

But wait, I also need to satisfy constraint 1 by having purple_block_1 on top of brown_block_1. However, if I put purple_block_1 on brown_block_1, I won't be able to put yellow_block_1 there. So, I need to adjust the plan.

Let's think again. The constraints don't specify the order in which they must be satisfied, so I can choose the order that makes sense.

I'll first satisfy constraint 1, then remove purple_block_1 from brown_block_1 to place yellow_block_1 there for the goal.

1. pickup purple_block_2
2. stack purple_block_2 yellow_block_2
3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
4. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 (now grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1, partial satisfaction of constraint 1)
5. unstack purple_block_2 yellow_block_2
6. stack purple_block_2 grey_block_2 (to ensure it's not on the table)
7. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
8. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2 (to ensure it's not on the table)
9. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
10. stack yellow_block_1 grey_block_2 (to temporarily store it)
11. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1 (now purple_block_1 is on brown_block_1, completing the satisfaction of constraint 1)

At this point, I've satisfied constraint 1. Now, I need to satisfy the goal by placing yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1. But I need to remove purple_block_1 first.

12. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
13. stack purple_block_1 purple_block_2 (to ensure it's not on the table)
14. unstack yellow_block_1 grey_block_2
15. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1 (this achieves the goal)

But I need to check if all constraints are satisfied:

Constraint 1: At some point, purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1. This is satisfied at step 11.
Constraint 2: yellow_block_2 is never on the table. This is satisfied throughout.
Constraint 3: At some point, I am holding yellow_block_1. This is satisfied at step 14.
Constraint 4: Before holding yellow_block_1, either purple_block_2 is not on the table or I am holding purple_block_2. This is satisfied at step 1 when I hold purple_block_2.
Constraint 5: At some point, brown_block_1 is not clear. This is satisfied in the initial state and again at step 11.
Constraint 6: If brown_block_1 is not clear, then at the same time or later, either brown_block_1 is clear or I am holding grey_block_2. This is satisfied in the initial state when I unstack grey_block_2 and later when I remove purple_block_1.
Constraint 7: At some point, brown_block_1 is not on the table. This is satisfied in the initial state.
Constraint 8: If brown_block_1 is not on the table, then at the same time or later, purple_block_1 is not clear. This is satisfied in the initial state when yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1.

It looks like all constraints are satisfied. But I need to double-check the plan for feasibility:

1. pickup purple_block_2 (valid)
2. stack purple_block_2 yellow_block_2 (valid)
3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1 (valid)
4. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 (valid)
5. unstack purple_block_2 yellow_block_2 (valid)
6. stack purple_block_2 grey_block_2 (valid)
7. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1 (valid)
8. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2 (valid)
9. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1 (valid)
10. stack yellow_block_1 grey_block_2 (there's a problem here. yellow_block_2 is on purple_block_2, which is on grey_block_2, so grey_block_2 is not clear. I can't stack yellow_block_1 on it.)

There's a flaw in the plan. Let me rethink.

I need to ensure all blocks I want to stack on are clear. Let me revise the plan:

1. pickup purple_block_2 (valid)
2. stack purple_block_2 yellow_block_2 (valid)
3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1 (valid)
4. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 (valid)
5. unstack purple_block_2 yellow_block_2 (valid)
6. putdown purple_block_2 (violates constraint 4 if this happens before holding yellow_block_1)

Actually, let's try a different approach. 

1. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1 (this makes brown_block_1 clear)
2. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 (this partially satisfies constraint 1)

Now I need to get purple_block_1 on top of brown_block_1 to fully satisfy constraint 1. But first, I need to unstack yellow_block_1 and yellow_block_2.

3. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
4. stack yellow_block_2 grey_block_2 (to ensure yellow_block_2 is not on the table)
5. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
6. stack yellow_block_1 yellow_block_2 (temporary storage, ensuring yellow_block_2 is not on the table)
7. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1 (this fully satisfies constraint 1)

Now, to achieve the goal, I need to move purple_block_1 off brown_block_1 and place yellow_block_1 there.

8. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
9. pickup purple_block_2 (to satisfy constraint 4)
10. stack purple_block_2 purple_block_1 (temporary storage, ensuring yellow_block_2 is not on the table)
11. unstack yellow_block_1 yellow_block_2
12. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1 (this achieves the goal)

Let's verify all constraints again:

Constraint 1: At some point, purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1. This is satisfied at step 7.
Constraint 2: yellow_block_2 is never on the table. This is satisfied throughout.
Constraint 3: At some point, I am holding yellow_block_1. This is satisfied at step 11.
Constraint 4: Before holding yellow_block_1, either purple_block_2 is not on the table or I am holding purple_block_2. This is satisfied at step 9.
Constraint 5: At some point, brown_block_1 is not clear. This is satisfied in the initial state and again at step 7.
Constraint 6: If brown_block_1 is not clear, then at the same time or later, either brown_block_1 is clear or I am holding grey_block_2. This is satisfied in the initial state when I unstack grey_block_2 and later when I remove purple_block_1.
Constraint 7: At some point, brown_block_1 is not on the table. This is satisfied in the initial state.
Constraint 8: If brown_block_1 is not on the table, then at the same time or later, purple_block_1 is not clear. This is satisfied in the initial state when yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1.

It seems all constraints are satisfied.

Let's check the step-by-step feasibility of the plan:

1. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1 (valid)
2. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 (valid)
3. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1 (valid)
4. stack yellow_block_2 grey_block_2 (valid)
5. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1 (valid)
6. stack yellow_block_1 yellow_block_2 (valid)
7. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1 (valid)
8. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1 (valid)
9. pickup purple_block_2 (valid)
10. stack purple_block_2 purple_block_1 (valid)
11. unstack yellow_block_1 yellow_block_2 (valid)
12. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1 (valid)

Hmm, but I just realized that steps 9 and 10 are unnecessary, since constraint 4 is satisfied by having purple_block_2 not on the table before holding yellow_block_1. But wait, in this plan, purple_block_2 is always on the table until step 9, and I'm holding yellow_block_1 at step 11. So, it is necessary.

Actually, on second thought, I think I misunderstood constraint 4. It says "Before holding yellow_block_1, either purple_block_2 is not on the table or I am holding purple_block_2." It doesn't specify that this has to be true immediately before holding yellow_block_1, just at some point earlier. So, as long as I ensure purple_block_2 is off the table or held by me at some point before step 11, the constraint should be satisfied.

Let's refine the plan:

1. pickup purple_block_2 (to satisfy constraint 4)
2. putdown purple_block_2 (now I've satisfied constraint 4 because I held purple_block_2, and I'm keeping it simple)
3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
4. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
5. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
6. stack yellow_block_2 grey_block_2
7. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
8. stack yellow_block_1 yellow_block_2
9. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
10. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
11. stack purple_block_1 purple_block_2
12. unstack yellow_block_1 yellow_block_2
13. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1

Actually, this plan still satisfies all constraints, but it's a bit inefficient. Let's try to optimize it.

1. pickup purple_block_2 (to satisfy constraint 4)
2. stack purple_block_2 purple_block_1 (to ensure it's not on the table and to partially prepare for later steps)
3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
4. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 (partially satisfying constraint 1)
5. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
6. stack yellow_block_2 grey_block_2 (to ensure yellow_block_2 is not on the table)
7. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
8. stack yellow_block_1 yellow_block_2 (temporary storage, ensuring yellow_block_2 is not on the table)
9. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
10. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1 (fully satisfying constraint 1)
11. stack purple_block_2 purple_block_1 (to ensure purple_block_2 is not on the table)
12. unstack yellow_block_1 yellow_block_2
13. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1 (achieving the goal)

Actually, I made a mistake. In step 9, I'm unstacking purple_block_2 from purple_block_1, but I can't place purple_block_1 on brown_block_1 in step 10 because I'm still holding purple_block_2. Let me correct this:

1. pickup purple_block_2 (to satisfy constraint 4)
2. stack purple_block_2 purple_block_1 (to ensure it's not on the table and to partially prepare for later steps)
3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
4. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 (partially satisfying constraint 1)
5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
6. putdown purple_block_2 (we need to put it down for now)
7. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
8. stack yellow_block_2 grey_block_2 (to ensure yellow_block_2 is not on the table)
9. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
10. stack yellow_block_1 yellow_block_2 (temporary storage, ensuring yellow_block_2 is not on the table)
11. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1 (fully satisfying constraint 1)
12. pickup purple_block_2 (pick it up to ensure it's not on the table)
13. stack purple_block_2 purple_block_1 (to ensure purple_block_2 is not on the table)
14. unstack yellow_block_1 yellow_block_2
15. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1 (achieving the goal)

Hmm, but this plan is getting longer. Let me try once more to optimize:

1. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
2. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 (partially satisfying constraint 1)
3. pickup purple_block_2 (to satisfy constraint 4)
4. stack purple_block_2 grey_block_2 (to ensure it's not on the table)
5. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
6. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2 (to ensure yellow_block_2 is not on the table)
7. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
8. stack yellow_block_1 yellow_block_2 (temporary storage, ensuring yellow_block_2 is not on the table)
9. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1 (fully satisfying constraint 1)
10. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
11. putdown purple_block_1 (we can put it on the table since we've already satisfied constraints)
12. unstack yellow_block_1 yellow_block_2
13. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1 (achieving the goal)

Actually, I think I'm overthinking this. Let's go back to the initial plan:

1. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
2. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 (partially satisfying constraint 1)
3. pickup purple_block_2 (to satisfy constraint 4)
4. putdown purple_block_2 (just to release it, since we've already held it)
5. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
6. stack yellow_block_2 grey_block_2 (to ensure yellow_block_2 is not on the table)
7. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
8. stack yellow_block_1 yellow_block_2 (temporary storage, ensuring yellow_block_2 is not on the table)
9. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1 (fully satisfying constraint 1)
10. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
11. putdown purple_block_1 (we can put it on the table since we've already satisfied constraints)
12. unstack yellow_block_1 yellow_block_2
13. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1 (achieving the goal)

Let's double-check all constraints once more:

Constraint 1: At some point, purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1. This is satisfied at step 9.
Constraint 2: yellow_block_2 is never on the table. This is satisfied throughout.
Constraint 3: At some point, I am holding yellow_block_1. This is satisfied at steps 7 and 12.
Constraint 4: Before holding yellow_block_1, either purple_block_2 is not on the table or I am holding purple_block_2. This is satisfied at step 3.
Constraint 5: At some point, brown_block_1 is not clear. This is satisfied in the initial state and again at step 9.
Constraint 6: If brown_block_1 is not clear, then at the same time or later, either brown_block_1 is clear or I am holding grey_block_2. This is satisfied in the initial state when I unstack grey_block_2 and later when I remove purple_block_1.
Constraint 7: At some point, brown_block_1 is not on the table. This is satisfied in the initial state.
Constraint 8: If brown_block_1 is not on the table, then at the same time or later, purple_block_1 is not clear. This is satisfied in the initial state when yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1.

All constraints are satisfied.

Actually, wait, I'm not sure if the constraint 8 is truly satisfied in my plan. In the initial state, brown_block_1 is not on the table (it's on grey_block_1). According to constraint 8, at this point or later, purple_block_1 should not be clear. In the initial state, purple_block_1 is not clear because yellow_block_1 is on it. But after step 7, purple_block_1 becomes clear. Hmm, I need to ensure that whenever brown_block_1 is not on the table, at that time or later, purple_block_1 is not clear.

Let's check when brown_block_1 is not on the table in my plan:
- From the initial state till the end (it's always on top of grey_block_1 or with a block on top of it)

So, at the time or after brown_block_1 is not on the table, purple_block_1 should not be clear. But after step 7, purple_block_1 becomes clear, and it only becomes not clear again at step 9 when I stack purple_block_1 on brown_block_1.

Wait, that's backward. Constraint 8 says: "If brown_block_1 is not on the table, then at the same time or later, purple_block_1 is not clear." So, if brown_block_1 is not on the table at any point (which it is throughout my plan), then at that point or later, purple_block_1 should not be clear. 

In the initial state, brown_block_1 is not on the table, and purple_block_1 is not clear (yellow_block_1 is on it). So, the constraint is satisfied at the beginning. But after step 7, purple_block_1 becomes clear. However, the constraint doesn't say purple_block_1 should be not clear for the entire duration after brown_block_1 is not on the table, just at some point. And at step 9, purple_block_1 becomes not clear again (it's placed on brown_block_1). So, I think the constraint is still satisfied.

Alright, I believe my plan is optimal and satisfies all constraints:

1. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
2. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
3. pickup purple_block_2
4. putdown purple_block_2
5. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
6. stack yellow_block_2 grey_block_2
7. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
8. stack yellow_block_1 yellow_block_2
9. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
10. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
11. putdown purple_block_1
12. unstack yellow_block_1 yellow_block_2
13. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1


One moment, I just thought about the first constraint again. At some point, purple_block_1 should be on top of brown_block_1 and simultaneously grey_block_2 should be on top of grey_block_1. With my current plan, this happens at step 9, and at that point, grey_block_2 is already on grey_block_1, so the constraint is satisfied.

But to make sure the plan is optimal (i.e., of minimal length), let me check if we can eliminate or combine any steps.

Here's a revised plan, trying to be even more efficient:

1. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
2. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
3. pickup purple_block_2 (to satisfy constraint 4)
4. stack purple_block_2 grey_block_2
5. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
6. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2
7. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
8. stack yellow_block_1 yellow_block_2
9. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1 (fully satisfying constraint 1)
10. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
11. putdown purple_block_1
12. unstack yellow_block_1 yellow_block_2
13. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1

So the final plan is:

1. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
2. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
3. pickup purple_block_2
4. stack purple_block_2 grey_block_2
5. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
6. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2
7. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
8. stack yellow_block_1 yellow_block_2
9. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
10. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
11. putdown purple_block_1
12. unstack yellow_block_1 yellow_block_2
13. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1

Let's verify all constraints one last time:

Constraint 1: At some point, purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1. This is satisfied at step 9.
Constraint 2: yellow_block_2 is never on the table. This is satisfied throughout the plan.
Constraint 3: At some point, I am holding yellow_block_1. This is satisfied at steps 7 and 12.
Constraint 4: Before holding yellow_block_1, either purple_block_2 is not on the table or I am holding purple_block_2. This is satisfied at step 3, where I'm holding purple_block_2 before step 7, which is when I first hold yellow_block_1.
Constraint 5: At some point, brown_block_1 is not clear. This is satisfied in the initial state and again at step 9.
Constraint 6: If brown_block_1 is not clear, then at the same time or later, either brown_block_1 is clear or I am holding grey_block_2. This is satisfied in the initial state when I unstack grey_block_2 (satisfying the "I am holding grey_block_2" part) and later when I remove purple_block_1 from brown_block_1 at step 10 (satisfying the "brown_block_1 is clear" part).
Constraint 7: At some point, brown_block_1 is not on the table. This is satisfied in the initial state.
Constraint 8: If brown_block_1 is not on the table, then at the same time or later, purple_block_1 is not clear. This is satisfied in the initial state when yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1.

All constraints are satisfied.
