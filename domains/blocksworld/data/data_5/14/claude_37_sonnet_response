Let's start by understanding the initial state and goal:

Initial state:
- `black_block_1` is on the table
- `red_block_1` is on the table
- `blue_block_1` is on top of `black_block_1`
- `black_block_2` is on top of `red_block_1`
- `yellow_block_1` is on top of `blue_block_1`
- `black_block_3` is on the table
- `purple_block_1` is on top of `yellow_block_1`
- `black_block_2` is clear
- `black_block_3` is clear
- `purple_block_1` is clear
- The robot arm is not holding any block

So, the initial state is:
```
   purple_block_1         black_block_2    black_block_3
         |                      |
   yellow_block_1          red_block_1
         |
    blue_block_1
         |
   black_block_1
         |
        table
```

Goal:
- `yellow_block_1` is clear

Given that `purple_block_1` is on top of `yellow_block_1` in the initial state, to make `yellow_block_1` clear, we need to remove `purple_block_1` from it.

Let's work with the constraints:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are holding purple_block_1'"
   - We need to pick up `purple_block_1` at some point.

2. "If expression 'you are holding purple_block_1' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which 'black_block_2 is on the table'"
   - Before we can pick up `purple_block_1`, we need to ensure `black_block_2` is on the table.

3. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'there is a block on top of purple_block_1, i.e., purple_block_1 is not clear'"
   - We need to place a block on top of `purple_block_1` at some point.

4. "If expression 'there is a block on top of purple_block_1, i.e., purple_block_1 is not clear' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which 'At least one of the following conditions is true: 'you are holding purple_block_1', 'there is a block on top of black_block_2, i.e., black_block_2 is not clear''"
   - Before we can place a block on top of `purple_block_1`, we need to either be holding `purple_block_1` or have a block on top of `black_block_2`.

5. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: 'you are holding yellow_block_1', 'blue_block_1 is on the table''"
   - At some point, we need to either be holding `yellow_block_1` or have `blue_block_1` on the table.

6. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: 'black_block_1 is not on the table', 'blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2''"
   - At some point, we need to either have `black_block_1` not on the table or have `blue_block_1` on top of `black_block_2`.

7. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'purple_block_1 is not on the table'"
   - At some point, `purple_block_1` should not be on the table.

8. "If expression 'purple_block_1 is not on the table' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: 'you are holding black_block_2', 'there is no block on top of red_block_1, i.e., red_block_1 is clear'' must hold at s or at some state after s"
   - If `purple_block_1` is not on the table, then we need to either be holding `black_block_2` or have `red_block_1` clear at that state or afterwards.

Let's now start planning:

Given constraint 2, we need to have `black_block_2` on the table before holding `purple_block_1`. Since `black_block_2` is on top of `red_block_1` in the initial state, we need to unstack it and place it on the table.

1. "unstack black_block_2 red_block_1"
2. "putdown black_block_2"

Now, `black_block_2` is on the table, and `red_block_1` is clear. We can now safely pick up `purple_block_1` as required by constraint 1.

3. "unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1"

At this point, we're holding `purple_block_1`, and `yellow_block_1` is clear, which is our goal. But we still have other constraints to satisfy.

According to constraint 7, `purple_block_1` should not be on the table at some point. But since we're currently holding `purple_block_1` and it's not on the table, this constraint is satisfied.

According to constraint 8, if `purple_block_1` is not on the table (which it currently isn't), we need to either be holding `black_block_2` or have `red_block_1` clear. Since we've already placed `black_block_2` on the table, `red_block_1` is clear, and we're holding `purple_block_1`, this constraint is satisfied.

Constraint 3 says we need to have a block on top of `purple_block_1` at some point. Let's place `purple_block_1` somewhere and then stack a block on top of it. We'll place `purple_block_1` on the table for now.

4. "putdown purple_block_1"

Now, we need to pick up a block to stack on top of `purple_block_1`. Given constraint 4, before we can place a block on top of `purple_block_1`, we need to either be holding `purple_block_1` (which we were before) or have a block on top of `black_block_2`. Since we were holding `purple_block_1` before, this constraint is satisfied.

We'll pick up `black_block_3` to stack on `purple_block_1`.

5. "pickup black_block_3"
6. "stack black_block_3 purple_block_1"

So now we have a block on top of `purple_block_1`, satisfying constraint 3.

Constraint 5 says we need to either be holding `yellow_block_1` or have `blue_block_1` on the table at some point. Since `yellow_block_1` is clear now, we can pick it up.

7. "unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1"

Now, we're holding `yellow_block_1`, which satisfies constraint 5.

Constraint 6 says we need to either have `black_block_1` not on the table or have `blue_block_1` on top of `black_block_2` at some point. Let's go with the latter.

8. "putdown yellow_block_1"
9. "unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1"
10. "stack blue_block_1 black_block_2"

Now, `blue_block_1` is on top of `black_block_2`, satisfying constraint 6.

Let's ensure our goal is achieved:

The goal is for `yellow_block_1` to be clear. We placed it on the table in step 8 and haven't put anything on top of it, so it's clear.

Actually I think I've made a mismatch. Let me check again. The goal is "yellow_block_1 is clear". Let's check the state:

- `black_block_1` is on the table
- `red_block_1` is on the table
- `black_block_2` is on the table
- `blue_block_1` is on top of `black_block_2`
- `yellow_block_1` is on the table
- `purple_block_1` is on the table
- `black_block_3` is on top of `purple_block_1`

Yes, `yellow_block_1` is clear, so our goal is achieved.

Let's review our actions:
1. "unstack black_block_2 red_block_1"
2. "putdown black_block_2"
3. "unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1"
4. "putdown purple_block_1"
5. "pickup black_block_3"
6. "stack black_block_3 purple_block_1"
7. "unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1"
8. "putdown yellow_block_1"
9. "unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1"
10. "stack blue_block_1 black_block_2"

Actually, let me ensure all the constraints are satisfied. I think we've implicitly satisfied them:

- Constraint 1: "at least one state: 'you are holding purple_block_1'" - Satisfied in step 3.
- Constraint 2: "if 'you are holding purple_block_1', then earlier 'black_block_2 is on the table'" - Satisfied because we place `black_block_2` on the table in step 2 before holding `purple_block_1` in step 3.
- Constraint 3: "at least one state: 'there is a block on top of purple_block_1'" - Satisfied in step 6.
- Constraint 4: "if 'there is a block on top of purple_block_1', then earlier 'you are holding purple_block_1' or 'there is a block on top of black_block_2'" - Satisfied because we were holding `purple_block_1` in step 3 before placing a block on top of it in step 6.
- Constraint 5: "at least one state: 'you are holding yellow_block_1' or 'blue_block_1 is on the table'" - Satisfied in step 7 when we're holding `yellow_block_1`.
- Constraint 6: "at least one state: 'black_block_1 is not on the table' or 'blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2'" - Satisfied in step 10 when we place `blue_block_1` on top of `black_block_2`.
- Constraint 7: "at least one state: 'purple_block_1 is not on the table'" - Satisfied in step 3 when we're holding `purple_block_1`.
- Constraint 8: "if 'purple_block_1 is not on the table', then at or after that state, 'you are holding black_block_2' or 'red_block_1 is clear'" - Satisfied because when we're holding `purple_block_1` in step 3, `red_block_1` is already clear.

Our plan seems to be valid, but let's check if it's optimal.

Wait, actually in constraint 4, I misunderstood the constraint:
"If expression 'there is a block on top of purple_block_1, i.e., purple_block_1 is not clear' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding purple_block_1", "there is a block on top of black_block_2, i.e., black_block_2 is not clear''"

This specifies "there must be an earlier state", not necessarily a state strictly before placing a block on top of `purple_block_1`. But let's double check: we put a block on top of `purple_block_1` in step 6, and we hold `purple_block_1` in step 3. So, there is indeed an earlier state in which we hold `purple_block_1`. This constraint is still satisfied.

Actually, I think we might have a small issue with constraint 7 and 8. Constraint 7 says `purple_block_1` should not be on the table at some point. And constraint 8 says if `purple_block_1` is not on the table (in state s), then either we're holding `black_block_2` or `red_block_1` is clear in state s or after.

When we're holding `purple_block_1` in step 3, `purple_block_1` is not on the table. But the second part of constraint 8 doesn't seem to apply correctly. We're not holding `black_block_2` at that point. However, `red_block_1` is clear because we've removed `black_block_2` from it in step 1, so this constraint should still be satisfied.

I think our plan is valid, and we've achieved our goal. However, let's double-check if there's a more optimal way (using fewer actions) to achieve the goal.

Actually, I think our current plan using 10 actions is already fairly optimal given the constraints:

1. "unstack black_block_2 red_block_1"
2. "putdown black_block_2"
3. "unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1"
4. "putdown purple_block_1"
5. "pickup black_block_3"
6. "stack black_block_3 purple_block_1"
7. "unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1"
8. "putdown yellow_block_1"
9. "unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1"
10. "stack blue_block_1 black_block_2"

If our sole goal was to make `yellow_block_1` clear, we could achieve it in just 1 action:
1. "unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1"

But we need to satisfy all the constraints, which requires several more actions.

However, I think there's a shorter plan:

1. "unstack black_block_2 red_block_1"
2. "putdown black_block_2"
3. "unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1"
4. "stack purple_block_1 black_block_3"
5. "pickup black_block_2"
6. "stack black_block_2 purple_block_1"
7. "unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1"
8. "stack blue_block_1 black_block_2"

This achieves the goal in 8 actions instead of 10. 

Let's review to make sure all the constraints are satisfied:

- Constraint 1: "at least one state: 'you are holding purple_block_1'" - Satisfied in step 3.
- Constraint 2: "if 'you are holding purple_block_1', then earlier 'black_block_2 is on the table'" - Satisfied because we place `black_block_2` on the table in step 2 before holding `purple_block_1` in step 3.
- Constraint 3: "at least one state: 'there is a block on top of purple_block_1'" - Satisfied in step 6 when we place `black_block_2` on top of `purple_block_1`.
- Constraint 4: "if 'there is a block on top of purple_block_1', then earlier 'you are holding purple_block_1' or 'there is a block on top of black_block_2'" - Satisfied because we hold `purple_block_1` in step 3 before placing a block on top of it in step 6.
- Constraint 5: "at least one state: 'you are holding yellow_block_1' or 'blue_block_1 is on the table'" - Wait, this constraint is not satisfied. We don't hold `yellow_block_1` at any point in this plan, and `blue_block_1` is not on the table either. Let's adjust the plan.

It seems like we need to either pick up `yellow_block_1` or place `blue_block_1` on the table at some point. Let's adjust our plan.

Actually let's try to build the most efficient plan possible. Let's first list out all the constraints and check which are satisfying in the initial state and which need to be satisfied by our plan.

Looking at the initial state:
- `black_block_1` is on the table
- `red_block_1` is on the table
- `blue_block_1` is on top of `black_block_1`
- `black_block_2` is on top of `red_block_1`
- `yellow_block_1` is on top of `blue_block_1`
- `black_block_3` is on the table
- `purple_block_1` is on top of `yellow_block_1`
- `black_block_2` is clear
- `black_block_3` is clear
- `purple_block_1` is clear
- The robot arm is not holding any block

Let's review the goal and constraints:

Goal: "yellow_block_1 is clear"
- In the initial state, yellow_block_1 is not clear (purple_block_1 is on top of it). We need to remove purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1.

Constraint 1: "at least one state: 'you are holding purple_block_1'"
- Not satisfied in the initial state. We need to pick up purple_block_1 at some point.

Constraint 2: "if 'you are holding purple_block_1', then earlier 'black_block_2 is on the table'"
- In the initial state, black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1, not on the table. Before we can pick up purple_block_1, we need to ensure black_block_2 is on the table.

Constraint 3: "at least one state: 'there is a block on top of purple_block_1'"
- Not satisfied in the initial state (purple_block_1 is clear). We need to place a block on top of purple_block_1 at some point.

Constraint 4: "if 'there is a block on top of purple_block_1', then earlier 'you are holding purple_block_1' or 'there is a block on top of black_block_2'"
- Not satisfied in the initial state. If we place a block on top of purple_block_1, we need to ensure that we either held purple_block_1 earlier or had a block on top of black_block_2.

Constraint 5: "at least one state: 'you are holding yellow_block_1' or 'blue_block_1 is on the table'"
- Not satisfied in the initial state. We need to either pick up yellow_block_1 or place blue_block_1 on the table at some point.

Constraint 6: "at least one state: 'black_block_1 is not on the table' or 'blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2'"
- Not satisfied in the initial state. We need to either pick up black_block_1 from the table or place blue_block_1 on top of black_block_2 at some point.

Constraint 7: "at least one state: 'purple_block_1 is not on the table'"
- Satisfied in the initial state, as purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, not on the table.

Constraint 8: "if 'purple_block_1 is not on the table', then at or after that state, 'you are holding black_block_2' or 'red_block_1 is clear'"
- Not fully satisfied in the initial state. purple_block_1 is not on the table, but neither are we holding black_block_2 nor is red_block_1 clear. We need to ensure one of these conditions is met.

Now, let's build an optimal plan:

1. "unstack black_block_2 red_block_1" - This satisfies constraint 8 because purple_block_1 is not on the table, and now red_block_1 is clear.
2. "putdown black_block_2" - This satisfies constraint 2, so we can pick up purple_block_1 later.

Now, red_block_1 is clear and black_block_2 is on the table, satisfying constraint 8 and preparing for constraint 2. 

3. "unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1" - This satisfies our goal (yellow_block_1 is clear) and constraint 1 (holding purple_block_1). It also satisfies constraint 4 for the future.

We now have yellow_block_1 clear, which is our goal. However, we still have a few more constraints to satisfy.

Constraint 3 requires a block on top of purple_block_1. Constraint 5 requires either holding yellow_block_1 or having blue_block_1 on the table. Constraint 6 requires either black_block_1 not on the table or blue_block_1 on top of black_block_2.

4. "putdown purple_block_1" - This places purple_block_1 on the table, preparing for constraint 3.

5. "unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1" - This satisfies constraint 5 (holding yellow_block_1).

6. "putdown yellow_block_1" - This keeps yellow_block_1 clear, maintaining our goal.

7. "unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1" - This prepares for constraint 6.

8. "stack blue_block_1 black_block_2" - This satisfies constraint 6 (blue_block_1 on top of black_block_2).

9. "pickup black_block_3" - Prepare for constraint 3.

10. "stack black_block_3 purple_block_1" - This satisfies constraint 3 (a block on top of purple_block_1).

So, our plan is:
1. "unstack black_block_2 red_block_1"
2. "putdown black_block_2"
3. "unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1"
4. "putdown purple_block_1"
5. "unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1"
6. "putdown yellow_block_1"
7. "unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1"
8. "stack blue_block_1 black_block_2"
9. "pickup black_block_3"
10. "stack black_block_3 purple_block_1"

This plan should satisfy all the constraints and achieve the goal. Let's check:

- Goal: "yellow_block_1 is clear" - Satisfied after step 3.
- Constraint 1: "at least one state: 'you are holding purple_block_1'" - Satisfied in step 3.
- Constraint 2: "if 'you are holding purple_block_1', then earlier 'black_block_2 is on the table'" - Satisfied because we place black_block_2 on the table in step 2 before holding purple_block_1 in step 3.
- Constraint 3: "at least one state: 'there is a block on top of purple_block_1'" - Satisfied in step 10.
- Constraint 4: "if 'there is a block on top of purple_block_1', then earlier 'you are holding purple_block_1' or 'there is a block on top of black_block_2'" - Satisfied because we hold purple_block_1 in step 3 before placing a block on top of it in step 10. Additionally, blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2 in step 8, which is also before step 10.
- Constraint 5: "at least one state: 'you are holding yellow_block_1' or 'blue_block_1 is on the table'" - Satisfied in step 5 when we're holding yellow_block_1.
- Constraint 6: "at least one state: 'black_block_1 is not on the table' or 'blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2'" - Satisfied in step 8 when we place blue_block_1 on top of black_block_2.
- Constraint 7: "at least one state: 'purple_block_1 is not on the table'" - Satisfied from the initial state through step 3.
- Constraint 8: "if 'purple_block_1 is not on the table', then at or after that state, 'you are holding black_block_2' or 'red_block_1 is clear'" - Satisfied because when purple_block_1 is not on the table in the initial state and step 3, red_block_1 is clear after step 1.

It looks like our plan is valid and satisfies all the constraints. However, I wonder if we can make it more efficient.

Let's also check the state after each step to ensure I haven't made any mistakes:

Initial state:
- `black_block_1` is on the table
- `red_block_1` is on the table
- `blue_block_1` is on top of `black_block_1`
- `black_block_2` is on top of `red_block_1`
- `yellow_block_1` is on top of `blue_block_1`
- `black_block_3` is on the table
- `purple_block_1` is on top of `yellow_block_1`
- `black_block_2`, `black_block_3`, and `purple_block_1` are clear
- The robot arm is not holding any block

After step 1 ("unstack black_block_2 red_block_1"):
- The robot arm is holding `black_block_2`
- `red_block_1` is clear
- The rest remains the same

After step 2 ("putdown black_block_2"):
- `black_block_2` is on the table and clear
- The robot arm is not holding any block
- The rest remains the same

After step 3 ("unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1"):
- The robot arm is holding `purple_block_1`
- `yellow_block_1` is clear
- The rest remains the same

After step 4 ("putdown purple_block_1"):
- `purple_block_1` is on the table and clear
- The robot arm is not holding any block
- The rest remains the same

After step 5 ("unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1"):
- The robot arm is holding `yellow_block_1`
- `blue_block_1` is clear
- The rest remains the same

After step 6 ("putdown yellow_block_1"):
- `yellow_block_1` is on the table and clear
- The robot arm is not holding any block
- The rest remains the same

After step 7 ("unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1"):
- The robot arm is holding `blue_block_1`
- `black_block_1` is clear
- The rest remains the same

After step 8 ("stack blue_block_1 black_block_2"):
- `blue_block_1` is on top of `black_block_2` and clear
- The robot arm is not holding any block
- The rest remains the same

After step 9 ("pickup black_block_3"):
- The robot arm is holding `black_block_3`
- The rest remains the same

After step 10 ("stack black_block_3 purple_block_1"):
- `black_block_3` is on top of `purple_block_1` and clear
- The robot arm is not holding any block
- The rest remains the same

At this point, `yellow_block_1` is clear, so we've achieved our goal. And as we've verified, all the constraints are satisfied. This plan seems optimal given the constraints.

Actually, let me see if there's a shorter plan:

What if we try this?
1. "unstack black_block_2 red_block_1"
2. "stack black_block_2 black_block_3" - This puts a block on top of black_block_3, which isn't necessary for our constraints. Let's not do this.

Ok, let's try rethinking this:

1. "unstack black_block_2 red_block_1" - This satisfies constraint 8, and red_block_1 is now clear.
2. "putdown black_block_2" - This satisfies constraint 2, so we can pick up purple_block_1 later.
3. "unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1" - This satisfies our goal (yellow_block_1 is clear) and constraint 1 (holding purple_block_1).

Now, we need to satisfy constraints 3, 5, and 6.

4. "stack purple_block_1 black_block_3" - This keeps purple_block_1 not on the table, which is good for constraint 7. It also preps for constraint 3.
5. "pickup blue_block_1" (from black_block_1) - This will help with constraint 6.
6. "stack blue_block_1 black_block_2" - This satisfies constraint 6.
7. "pickup yellow_block_1" - This satisfies constraint 5.
8. "stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1" - This satisfies constraint 3.

So, our new plan is:
1. "unstack black_block_2 red_block_1"
2. "putdown black_block_2"
3. "unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1"
4. "stack purple_block_1 black_block_3"
5. "unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1"
6. "stack blue_block_1 black_block_2"
7. "pickup yellow_block_1"
8. "stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1"

Let's check:

- Goal: "yellow_block_1 is clear" - Not satisfied! We just placed yellow_block_1 on top of purple_block_1, so yellow_block_1 is clear, but it's not our goal. Our goal is that yellow_block_1 should be clear, but we just placed it on top of another block. 

It seems like I misunderstood. Let me clarify: the goal is that `yellow_block_1` should be clear, which means no block should be on top of it. In the initial state, `purple_block_1` is on top of `yellow_block_1`, so `yellow_block_1` is not clear.

I'll try again:

1. "unstack black_block_2 red_block_1" - This satisfies constraint 8, and red_block_1 is now clear.
2. "putdown black_block_2" - This satisfies constraint 2, so we can pick up purple_block_1 later.
3. "unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1" - This satisfies our goal (yellow_block_1 is clear) and constraint 1 (holding purple_block_1).

At this point, we've achieved our goal. But we still need to satisfy several constraints:

Constraint 3: "at least one state: 'there is a block on top of purple_block_1'"
Constraint 5: "at least one state: 'you are holding yellow_block_1' or 'blue_block_1 is on the table'"
Constraint 6: "at least one state: 'black_block_1 is not on the table' or 'blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2'"

4. "stack purple_block_1 black_block_2" - This keeps purple_block_1 not on the table for constraint 7. It also preps for subsequent actions.
5. "pickup yellow_block_1" - This satisfies constraint 5.
6. "stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1" - This satisfies constraint 3. But now yellow_block_1 is not clear, violating our goal.
7. "unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1" - This restores our goal.
8. "putdown yellow_block_1" - This keeps yellow_block_1 clear, maintaining our goal.
9. "unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1" - This preps for constraint 6.
10. "stack blue_block_1 black_block_2" - This satisfies constraint 6.

OK that still 10 actions.

I think we might be able to save one action by being more careful to not violate the goal after it has been achieved. Let's try to restructure the plan to not place a block on top of yellow_block_1 once we've cleared it. Here's a slightly different approach:

1. "unstack black_block_2 red_block_1" - This satisfies constraint 8, and red_block_1 is now clear.
2. "putdown black_block_2" - This satisfies constraint 2, so we can pick up purple_block_1 later.
3. "unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1" - This satisfies our goal (yellow_block_1 is clear) and constraint 1 (holding purple_block_1). It also satisfies constraint 7 because purple_block_1 is not on the table (it's in the robot arm).

Now, we need to ensure purple_block_1 doesn't go back on yellow_block_1 to maintain our goal.

4. "stack purple_block_1 black_block_2" - This keeps purple_block_1 not on the table for constraint 7.
5. "unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1" - This preps for constraint 6.
6. "stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1" - This satisfies constraint 3 and preps for constraint 6.
7. "pickup black_block_3" - Preps for constraint 6.
8. "stack black_block_3 blue_block_1" - This prepares black_block_3.
9. "unstack black_block_3 blue_block_1" - This gets black_block_3 back.
10. "putdown black_block_3" - This place black_block_3 on the table.
11. "unstack blue_block_1 purple_block_1" - This gets blue_block_1.
12. "stack blue_block_1 black_block_2" - This satisfies constraint 6.
13. "pickup yellow_block_1" - This satisfies constraint 5.
14. "putdown yellow_block_1" - This keeps yellow_block_1 clear, maintaining our goal.

Actually, this plan is much longer, and doesn't seem to be the most efficient. Let me reconsider.

Actually, let's check if we can satisfy all the constraints without placing a block on top of yellow_block_1.

1. "unstack black_block_2 red_block_1" - This satisfies constraint 8, and red_block_1 is now clear.
2. "putdown black_block_2" - This satisfies constraint 2, so we can pick up purple_block_1 later.
3. "unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1" - This satisfies our goal (yellow_block_1 is clear) and constraint 1 (holding purple_block_1).
4. "stack purple_block_1 black_block_3" - This keeps purple_block_1 not on the table for constraint 7. It also prepares for constraint 3.
5. "pickup black_block_2" - Prepares for constraint 3.
6. "stack black_block_2 purple_block_1" - This satisfies constraint 3.
7. "pickup yellow_block_1" - This satisfies constraint 5.
8. "putdown yellow_block_1" - This keeps yellow_block_1 clear, maintaining our goal.
9. "unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1" - This preps for constraint 6.
10. "stack blue_block_1 black_block_2" - This satisfies constraint 6.

Actually, that's still 10 actions! I think 10 actions might be the optimal solution given all the constraints.

Let me try a slightly different approach:

1. "unstack black_block_2 red_block_1" - Satisfies constraint 8, red_block_1 is now clear.
2. "putdown black_block_2" - Satisfies constraint 2, now we can pick up purple_block_1.
3. "unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1" - Satisfies goal (yellow_block_1 is clear) and constraint 1 (holding purple_block_1).
4. "stack purple_block_1 black_block_3" - Keeps constraint 7 satisfied (purple_block_1 not on table).
5. "unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1" - Prepares for constraint 6.
6. "stack blue_block_1 black_block_2" - Satisfies constraint 6.
7. "pickup black_block_1" - Prepares for constraint 3.
8. "stack black_block_1 purple_block_1" - Satisfies constraint 3.
9. "pickup yellow_block_1" - Satisfies constraint 5.
10. "putdown yellow_block_1" - Keeps goal satisfied.

Let me reconsider and see if there's a more efficient approach:

1. "unstack black_block_2 red_block_1" - Satisfies constraint 8.
2. "putdown black_block_2" - Satisfies constraint 2.
3. "unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1" - Satisfies goal and constraint 1.
4. "stack purple_block_1 red_block_1" - Keeps constraint 7 satisfied.
5. "unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1" - Prepares for constraint 6.
6. "stack blue_block_1 black_block_2" - Satisfies constraint 6.
7. "pickup black_block_1" - Prepares for constraint 3.
8. "stack black_block_1 purple_block_1" - Satisfies constraint 3.
9. "pickup yellow_block_1" - Satisfies constraint 5.
10. "putdown yellow_block_1" - Keeps goal satisfied.

Actually, this is still 10 actions. Let me try a different approach to see if we can reduce the number of actions.

Let me just question whether we ever need to pick up yellow_block_1. 

1. "unstack black_block_2 red_block_1" - Satisfies constraint 8.
2. "putdown black_block_2" - Satisfies constraint 2.
3. "unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1" - Satisfies goal and constraint 1.
4. "stack purple_block_1 black_block_2" - Keeps constraint 7 satisfied.
5. "unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1" - Prepares for constraint 5 (by making blue_block_1 eligible to be placed on the table) and constraint 6.
6. "putdown blue_block_1" - Satisfies constraint 5.
7. "pickup blue_block_1" - Prepares for constraint 6.
8. "stack blue_block_1 black_block_2" - Satisfies constraint 6.
9. "pickup black_block_3" - Prepares for constraint 3.
10. "stack black_block_3 purple_block_1" - Satisfies constraint 3.

Actually, I realized that I might be able to save one action. Let me try another approach:

1. "unstack black_block_2 red_block_1" - Satisfies constraint 8.
2. "putdown black_block_2" - Satisfies constraint 2.
3. "unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1" - Satisfies goal and constraint 1.
4. "stack purple_block_1 black_block_2" - Keeps constraint 7 satisfied.
5. "unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1" - Prepares for constraint 5 and constraint 6.
6. "putdown blue_block_1" - Satisfies constraint 5.
7. "pickup blue_block_1" - Prepares for constraint 6.
8. "stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1" - Satisfies constraint 3 and constraint 6.

Actually, in step 8, I'm not sure if stacking blue_block_1 on purple_block_1 satisfies constraint 6, because constraint 6 specifically asks for blue_block_1 to be on top of black_block_2, not purple_block_1. Let's review the constraints again.

Constraint 6: "at least one state: 'black_block_1 is not on the table' or 'blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2'"

Stacking blue_block_1 on purple_block_1 does not satisfy this constraint. We need to either have black_block_1 not on the table, or have blue_block_1 on top of black_block_2.

Let me try a different approach focusing on making as few actions as possible:

1. "unstack black_block_2 red_block_1" - Satisfies constraint 8.
2. "putdown black_block_2" - Satisfies constraint 2.
3. "unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1" - Satisfies goal and constraint 1.
4. "putdown purple_block_1" - Prepares for subsequent actions.
5. "pickup blue_block_1" (from black_block_1) - Prepares for constraint 6.
6. "stack blue_block_1 black_block_2" - Satisfies constraint 6.
7. "pickup black_block_1" - Prepares for constraint 3 and potentially constraint 6.
8. "stack black_block_1 purple_block_1" - Satisfies constraint 3. Also, now black_block_1 is not on the table, which satisfies the first part of constraint 6 (though we've already satisfied it with the second part).

Both constraint 5 stipulates that we either hold yellow_block_1 or place blue_block_1 on the table. So far, neither of these conditions has been met. We should either pickup yellow_block_1 or place blue_block_1 on the table at some point.

9. "pickup yellow_block_1" - Satisfies constraint 5.
10. "putdown yellow_block_1" - Keeps goal satisfied.

In all my attempts, I have 10 actions. I'm starting to think that's the minimal number. I'll review just one more time to make sure.

Taking a closer look at constraint 5 and 6:

Constraint 5: "at least one state: 'you are holding yellow_block_1' or 'blue_block_1 is on the table'"
Constraint 6: "at least one state: 'black_block_1 is not on the table' or 'blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2'"

Focus on the OR conditions. For constraint 5, we need to either hold yellow_block_1 OR place blue_block_1 on the table. For constraint 6, we need to either have black_block_1 not on the table OR place blue_block_1 on top of black_block_2.

Given the initial state and the other constraints, it seems like we can satisfy constraint 5 more efficiently by placing blue_block_1 on the table at some point. And we can satisfy constraint 6 by placing blue_block_1 on top of black_block_2 or by picking up black_block_1.

Let me reapproach:

1. "unstack black_block_2 red_block_1" - Satisfies constraint 8.
2. "putdown black_block_2" - Satisfies constraint 2.
3. "unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1" - Satisfies goal and constraint 1.
4. "putdown purple_block_1" - Sets up for subsequent actions.
5. "unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1" - Prepares for constraint 5 and constraint 6.
6. "putdown blue_block_1" - Satisfies constraint 5.
7. "pickup blue_block_1" - Prepares for constraint 6.
8. "stack blue_block_1 black_block_2" - Satisfies constraint 6.
9. "pickup black_block_3" - Prepares for constraint 3.
10. "stack black_block_3 purple_block_1" - Satisfies constraint 3.

Actually, this is still 10 actions. Let me just double-check the 4th action: "putdown purple_block_1". This places purple_block_1 on the table, which might conflict with constraint 7 requiring purple_block_1 to not be on the table in at least one state. But constraint 7 was already satisfied before, when purple_block_1 was on top of yellow_block_1 in the initial state and when we were holding purple_block_1 in action 3. So, this doesn't create a conflict.

Just to double check this again:

1. "unstack black_block_2 red_block_1"
2. "putdown black_block_2"
3. "unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1"
4. "putdown purple_block_1"
5. "unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1"
6. "putdown blue_block_1"
7. "pickup blue_block_1"
8. "stack blue_block_1 black_block_2"
9. "pickup black_block_3"
10. "stack black_block_3 purple_block_1"

I believe this is a minimal valid plan. Let's check it once more:

- Goal: "yellow_block_1 is clear" - Satisfied from step 3 onwards.
- Constraint 1: "at least one state: 'you are holding purple_block_1'" - Satisfied in step 3.
- Constraint 2: "if 'you are holding purple_block_1', then earlier 'black_block_2 is on the table'" - Satisfied as black_block_2 is on the table from step 2 before we hold purple_block_1 in step 3.
- Constraint 3: "at least one state: 'there is a block on top of purple_block_1'" - Satisfied in step 10.
- Constraint 4: "if 'there is a block on top of purple_block_1', then earlier 'you are holding purple_block_1' or 'there is a block on top of black_block_2'" - Satisfied as we hold purple_block_1 in step 3 and there's a block on top of purple_block_1 in step 10. Additionally, blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2 in step 8, which is also before step 10.
- Constraint 5: "at least one state: 'you are holding yellow_block_1' or 'blue_block_1 is on the table'" - Satisfied in step 6 when blue_block_1 is on the table.
- Constraint 6: "at least one state: 'black_block_1 is not on the table' or 'blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2'" - Satisfied in step 8 when blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2.
- Constraint 7: "at least one state: 'purple_block_1 is not on the table'" - Satisfied in the initial state and step 3.
- Constraint 8: "if 'purple_block_1 is not on the table', then at or after that state, 'you are holding black_block_2' or 'red_block_1 is clear'" - Satisfied as red_block_1 is clear from step 1 onwards, and in the initial state (and step 3), purple_block_1 is not on the table.

This plan seems optimal at 10 steps.

I wonder if we can cut steps 6 and 7 and directly stack blue_block_1 on black_block_2. Let's see:

1. "unstack black_block_2 red_block_1"
2. "putdown black_block_2"
3. "unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1"
4. "putdown purple_block_1"
5. "unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1"
6. "stack blue_block_1 black_block_2"
7. "pickup black_block_3"
8. "stack black_block_3 purple_block_1"

This is 8 actions. Let's check if it satisfies all the constraints:

- Goal: "yellow_block_1 is clear" - Satisfied from step 3 onwards.
- Constraint 1: "at least one state: 'you are holding purple_block_1'" - Satisfied in step 3.
- Constraint 2: "if 'you are holding purple_block_1', then earlier 'black_block_2 is on the table'" - Satisfied as black_block_2 is on the table from step 2 before we hold purple_block_1 in step 3.
- Constraint 3: "at least one state: 'there is a block on top of purple_block_1'" - Satisfied in step 8.
- Constraint 4: "if 'there is a block on top of purple_block_1', then earlier 'you are holding purple_block_1' or 'there is a block on top of black_block_2'" - Satisfied as we hold purple_block_1 in step 3 and there's a block on top of purple_block_1 in step 8. Additionally, blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2 in step 6, which is also before step 8.
- Constraint 5: "at least one state: 'you are holding yellow_block_1' or 'blue_block_1 is on the table'" - Not satisfied. We don't hold yellow_block_1 at any point, and blue_block_1 is not placed on the table.
- Constraint 6: "at least one state: 'black_block_1 is not on the table' or 'blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2'" - Satisfied in step 6 when blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2.
- Constraint 7: "at least one state: 'purple_block_1 is not on the table'" - Satisfied in the initial state and step 3.
- Constraint 8: "if 'purple_block_1 is not on the table', then at or after that state, 'you are holding black_block_2' or 'red_block_1 is clear'" - Satisfied as red_block_1 is clear from step 1 onwards, and in the initial state (and step 3), purple_block_1 is not on the table.

Constraint 5 seems to be the issue. We need to either hold yellow_block_1 or have blue_block_1 on the table at some point. This will likely require two additional steps.

So our 10-step plan seems optimal:

1. "unstack black_block_2 red_block_1"
2. "putdown black_block_2"
3. "unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1"
4. "putdown purple_block_1"
5. "unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1"
6. "putdown blue_block_1"
7. "pickup blue_block_1"
8. "stack blue_block_1 black_block_2"
9. "pickup black_block_3"
10. "stack black_block_3 purple_block_1"

This is the plan I'll go with.
