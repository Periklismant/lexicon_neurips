Alright, I'm working on a Blocksworld planning problem. My goal is to find an optimal plan that gets the world from the initial state to the goal state while respecting some constraints. Let me analyze the problem step by step.

**Initial State:**
- red_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- black_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- black_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- brown_block_1 is clear
- black_block_2 is clear
- green_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

**Goal State:**
- brown_block_1 is on the table

**Constraints:**
1. At some point, black_block_2 should not be clear
2. At some point, black_block_1 should not be on top of brown_block_1
3. If black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1, then at the same time or later, either red_block_1 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear
4. At some point, you should be holding blue_block_1
5. At some point, yellow_block_1 should be on top of black_block_1 and yellow_block_1 should be clear
6. At some point, green_block_1 should not be on the table
7. If green_block_1 is not on the table, then at the same time or later, either yellow_block_1 is clear or green_block_1 is not clear

Let me first note that the goal is very simple: we need to place brown_block_1 on the table. Since brown_block_1 is currently on top of red_block_1, we can achieve this goal with a simple plan:

```
unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
```

However, this doesn't satisfy the constraints. Let me analyze each constraint and see how we need to modify our plan.

**Constraint 1:** At some point, black_block_2 should not be clear.
This means we need to place some block on top of black_block_2. In the initial state, black_block_2 is clear and on top of blue_block_1.

**Constraint 2 & 3:** These are about black_block_1 not being on top of brown_block_1, and if that happens, then either red_block_1 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear. Since in the initial state, black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1 (it's on the table and brown_block_1 is on top of red_block_1), we need to make sure that at the same time or later, either red_block_1 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear. In the initial state, brown_block_1 is clear, so these constraints are not satisfied. We need to make sure either red_block_1 is off the table or something is on top of brown_block_1 at some point.

**Constraint 4:** At some point, we need to be holding blue_block_1. In the initial state, blue_block_1 is under black_block_2, so we need to unstack black_block_2 before we can pick up blue_block_1.

**Constraint 5:** At some point, yellow_block_1 should be on top of black_block_1 and yellow_block_1 should be clear. In the initial state, yellow_block_1 is on the table with green_block_1 on top of it, and black_block_1 is on the table with blue_block_1 on top of it. We need to move yellow_block_1 to be on top of black_block_1.

**Constraint 6 & 7:** At some point, green_block_1 should not be on the table, and if that's the case, then either yellow_block_1 is clear or green_block_1 is not clear. In the initial state, green_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, so it's already off the table. We need to ensure that either yellow_block_1 is clear or green_block_1 is not clear. Given that green_block_1 is clear in the initial state, constraint 7 would be satisfied if we can make yellow_block_1 clear at some point.

Alright, with these constraints in mind, let me try to develop a plan:

1. First, let's unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1 and put it on the table to achieve our goal.
2. We need to make black_block_2 not clear at some point, so we need to stack something on top of it.
3. We need to hold blue_block_1 at some point, which means we need to unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1 first.
4. We need to place yellow_block_1 on top of black_block_1 at some point, which means we need to pickup yellow_block_1 (after removing green_block_1).
5. We need to ensure that if green_block_1 is not on the table, then either yellow_block_1 is clear or green_block_1 is not clear. Since green_block_1 is not on the table in the initial state and is clear, we need to make yellow_block_1 clear at some point.

Let's start building the plan:

First, let's unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1 to make yellow_block_1 clear:

```
unstack green_block_1 yellow_block_1
```

Now green_block_1 is in our hand. We can place it on top of black_block_2 to make black_block_2 not clear:

```
stack green_block_1 black_block_2
```

Now, let's unstack green_block_1 again to pickup blue_block_1 later:

```
unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
```

Let's put green_block_1 on the table:

```
putdown green_block_1
```

Now, let's unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1:

```
unstack black_block_2 blue_block_1
```

Let's put black_block_2 on the table:

```
putdown black_block_2
```

Now, let's unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1 to hold blue_block_1:

```
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
```

Now, let's put blue_block_1 on the table:

```
putdown blue_block_1
```

Now, let's pickup yellow_block_1 to place it on top of black_block_1:

```
pickup yellow_block_1
```

Let's stack yellow_block_1 on top of black_block_1:

```
stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1
```

Now, let's unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1 to place it on the table:

```
unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1
```

Finally, let's put brown_block_1 on the table:

```
putdown brown_block_1
```

Let's check if this plan satisfies all the constraints:

1. black_block_2 should not be clear: We stacked green_block_1 on top of black_block_2, so this constraint is satisfied.
2. black_block_1 should not be on top of brown_block_1: In the initial state, black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1, so this constraint is relevant. We need to ensure that at the same time or later, either red_block_1 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear. In our plan, once we unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1, brown_block_1 becomes clear and red_block_1 remains on the table, which doesn't satisfy the constraint.
3. You should hold blue_block_1: We unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1, so this constraint is satisfied.
4. yellow_block_1 should be on top of black_block_1 and clear: We stack yellow_block_1 on top of black_block_1, and there's no block on top of yellow_block_1, so this constraint is satisfied.
5. green_block_1 should not be on the table: In our plan, green_block_1 is off the table at some point, so this constraint is satisfied.
6. If green_block_1 is not on the table, then at the same time or later, either yellow_block_1 is clear or green_block_1 is not clear: In our plan, when green_block_1 is off the table, yellow_block_1 is clear, so this constraint is satisfied.

Hmm, we're still not satisfying constraint 2&3. Let's modify our plan to ensure that when black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1, either red_block_1 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear.

Before we unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1, let's place a block on top of brown_block_1 to make it not clear. Let's use blue_block_1:

```
unstack green_block_1 yellow_block_1
stack green_block_1 black_block_2
unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
putdown green_block_1
unstack black_block_2 blue_block_1
putdown black_block_2
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
stack blue_block_1 brown_block_1  # This makes brown_block_1 not clear
```

Now, brown_block_1 is not clear, which satisfies constraint 3. But we still need to place yellow_block_1 on top of black_block_1 and make sure we're holding blue_block_1 at some point.

Let's continue with the plan:
```
unstack blue_block_1 brown_block_1  # We're now holding blue_block_1, which satisfies constraint 4
putdown blue_block_1
pickup yellow_block_1
stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1  # This satisfies constraint 5
unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1
putdown brown_block_1  # This achieves our goal
```

Hmm, the problem is that we can't pick up yellow_block_1 directly if green_block_1 is on top of it. We need to unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1 first. Let's revise the plan.

Actually, let's start from scratch and be more methodical. Here's a revised plan:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1 to make yellow_block_1 clear.
2. Stack green_block_1 on black_block_2 to make black_block_2 not clear.
3. Unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1.
4. Stack black_block_2 on brown_block_1 to make brown_block_1 not clear.
5. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1 (this way we're holding blue_block_1).
6. Stack blue_block_1 on green_block_1.
7. Pickup yellow_block_1.
8. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1.
9. Unstack black_block_2 from brown_block_1.
10. Put black_block_2 on the table.
11. Unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1.
12. Put brown_block_1 on the table.

Let's format this as a proper plan:

```
unstack green_block_1 yellow_block_1
stack green_block_1 black_block_2
unstack black_block_2 blue_block_1
stack black_block_2 brown_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
stack blue_block_1 green_block_1
pickup yellow_block_1
stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1
unstack black_block_2 brown_block_1
putdown black_block_2
unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
```

Let's check if this plan satisfies all the constraints:

1. black_block_2 should not be clear: We stack green_block_1 on top of black_block_2, so this constraint is satisfied.
2. black_block_1 should not be on top of brown_block_1: In the initial state, black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1, so this constraint is relevant. We need to ensure that at the same time or later, either red_block_1 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear. In our plan, we stack black_block_2 on brown_block_1, making brown_block_1 not clear, so this constraint is satisfied.
3. You should hold blue_block_1: We unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1, so this constraint is satisfied.
4. yellow_block_1 should be on top of black_block_1 and clear: We stack yellow_block_1 on top of black_block_1, and there's no block on top of yellow_block_1, so this constraint is satisfied.
5. green_block_1 should not be on the table: In our plan, green_block_1 is off the table at multiple points, so this constraint is satisfied.
6. If green_block_1 is not on the table, then at the same time or later, either yellow_block_1 is clear or green_block_1 is not clear: In our plan, when green_block_1 is off the table, yellow_block_1 is clear at some point, and green_block_1 is not clear when blue_block_1 is on top of it, so this constraint is satisfied.

I believe this plan satisfies all the constraints! Let's double-check it.

Actually, I realized I made an error. After stacking blue_block_1 on green_block_1, both green_block_1 and yellow_block_1 would not be clear. We can't pick up yellow_block_1 because it's on the table, and we can't unstack it because it's not on top of any block. Ah, the issue is that constraint 5 requires yellow_block_1 to be on top of black_block_1, but in the initial state, yellow_block_1 is on the table. So, maybe I misunderstood?

Let me revisit the constraints and the initial state to make sure I understand them correctly. Here are the revised plan actions and their effects:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1:
   - green_block_1 is in hand
   - yellow_block_1 is clear
   - green_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 6)
   - yellow_block_1 is clear (constraint 7)

2. Stack green_block_1 on black_block_2:
   - green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2
   - black_block_2 is not clear (constraint 1)
   - green_block_1 is clear
   - green_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 6)
   - green_block_1 is clear (but constraint 7 is not satisfied here)

3. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2:
   - green_block_1 is in hand
   - black_block_2 is clear
   - green_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 6)

4. Stack green_block_1 on yellow_block_1:
   - green_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1 (back to the initial configuration for these blocks)
   - yellow_block_1 is not clear
   - green_block_1 is clear
   - green_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 6)
   - green_block_1 is clear (but constraint 7 is not satisfied here)

5. Unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1:
   - black_block_2 is in hand
   - blue_block_1 is clear

6. Stack black_block_2 on brown_block_1:
   - black_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1
   - brown_block_1 is not clear (constraint 3)
   - black_block_2 is clear

7. Unstack black_block_2 from brown_block_1:
   - black_block_2 is in hand
   - brown_block_1 is clear

8. Put black_block_2 on the table:
   - black_block_2 is on the table
   - black_block_2 is clear

9. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1:
   - blue_block_1 is in hand (constraint 4)
   - black_block_1 is clear

10. Stack blue_block_1 on green_block_1:
    - blue_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
    - green_block_1 is not clear (constraint 7)
    - blue_block_1 is clear
    - green_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 6)

11. Unstack blue_block_1 from green_block_1:
    - blue_block_1 is in hand
    - green_block_1 is clear

12. Put blue_block_1 on the table:
    - blue_block_1 is on the table
    - blue_block_1 is clear

13. Unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1:
    - green_block_1 is in hand
    - yellow_block_1 is clear
    - green_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 6)
    - yellow_block_1 is clear (constraint 7)

14. Put green_block_1 on the table:
    - green_block_1 is on the table
    - green_block_1 is clear

15. Pickup yellow_block_1:
    - yellow_block_1 is in hand

16. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1:
    - yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
    - yellow_block_1 is clear
    - black_block_1 is not clear (constraint 5 satisfied)

17. Unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1:
    - brown_block_1 is in hand
    - red_block_1 is clear

18. Put brown_block_1 on the table:
    - brown_block_1 is on the table (goal achieved)
    - brown_block_1 is clear

Let me revise the plan and make sure it's correct:

```
unstack green_block_1 yellow_block_1
stack green_block_1 black_block_2
unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
stack green_block_1 yellow_block_1
unstack black_block_2 blue_block_1
stack black_block_2 brown_block_1
unstack black_block_2 brown_block_1
putdown black_block_2
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
stack blue_block_1 green_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 green_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
unstack green_block_1 yellow_block_1
putdown green_block_1
pickup yellow_block_1
stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1
unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
```

However, this plan seems unnecessarily long. Let's try to optimize it:

```
unstack green_block_1 yellow_block_1
stack green_block_1 black_block_2
unstack black_block_2 blue_block_1
stack black_block_2 brown_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
pickup yellow_block_1
stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1
unstack black_block_2 brown_block_1
putdown black_block_2
unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
```

Hmm, after going through it, I realize that this plan still won't satisfy constraint 7. The constraint states that if green_block_1 is not on the table, then at the same time or later, either yellow_block_1 is clear or green_block_1 is not clear. 

In the initial state, green_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, so it's not on the table. Given this, either yellow_block_1 should be clear or green_block_1 should not be clear. In the initial state, yellow_block_1 is not clear (as green_block_1 is on top of it) and green_block_1 is clear. So, constraint 7 is not satisfied in the initial state.

We need to be to be sure that constraint 7 holds.

Just to be sure I understand constraint 7 properly: "If at any point green_block_1 is NOT on the table, then at the same time or later, either yellow_block_1 is clear OR green_block_1 is not clear". Is that right? It feels like I'm misunderstanding something here, because green_block_1 is not on the table in the initial state, but neither yellow_block_1 is clear nor is green_block_1 not clear. Let's double-check the initial state:

- green_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is not clear (because green_block_1 is on top of it)
- green_block_1 is clear 

If this is the case, then the initial state doesn't satisfy constraint 7. But maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Let me reconsider.

Actually, when I'm carefully reading the constraint again, it says: "If green_block_1 is not on the table, then at the same time or later, either yellow_block_1 is clear or green_block_1 is not clear."

So, if at any point green_block_1 is not on the table, then either yellow_block_1 is clear or green_block_1 is not clear should hold either at the same point or at a later point. It doesn't have to be satisfied immediately. 

In our plan, after we unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1, yellow_block_1 becomes clear. At this point, green_block_1 is not on the table (it's in our hand), and yellow_block_1 is clear. So, constraint 7 is satisfied.

I believe the modified plan should satisfy all the constraints now:

```
unstack green_block_1 yellow_block_1
stack green_block_1 black_block_2
unstack black_block_2 blue_block_1
stack black_block_2 brown_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
pickup yellow_block_1
stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1
unstack black_block_2 brown_block_1
putdown black_block_2
unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
```

Let's check if all the constraints are satisfied:

1. black_block_2 should not be clear: We stack green_block_1 on top of black_block_2, so this constraint is satisfied.
2. black_block_1 should not be on top of brown_block_1: In the initial state, black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1, so constraint 2 is satisfied. Constraint 3 says that if black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1, then at the same time or later, either red_block_1 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear. In our plan, we stack black_block_2 on brown_block_1, making brown_block_1 not clear, so this constraint is satisfied.
3. You should hold blue_block_1: We unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1, so this constraint is satisfied.
4. yellow_block_1 should be on top of black_block_1 and clear: We stack yellow_block_1 on top of black_block_1, and there's no block on top of yellow_block_1, so this constraint is satisfied.
5. green_block_1 should not be on the table: In our plan, green_block_1 is off the table at multiple points, so this constraint is satisfied.
6. If green_block_1 is not on the table, then at the same time or later, either yellow_block_1 is clear or green_block_1 is not clear: In our plan, after we unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1, yellow_block_1 becomes clear. At this point, green_block_1 is not on the table (it's in our hand), and yellow_block_1 is clear. So, this constraint is satisfied.

I believe this plan satisfies all the constraints! Let's recheck:

- Constraint 1: Is green_block_1 on top of black_block_2 at some point in our plan? Yes, after line 2: "stack green_block_1 black_block_2".
- Constraint 2: Is black_block_1 not on top of brown_block_1 at any point in our plan? Yes, in the initial state, black_block_1 is on the table, not on top of brown_block_1.
- Constraint 3: If black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1, then do we ensure that at the same time or later, either red_block_1 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear? Since black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1 in the initial state, we need to check if at some point in our plan, either red_block_1 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear. After stacking black_block_2 on brown_block_1, brown_block_1 is not clear, which satisfies this constraint.
- Constraint 4: Do we ever hold blue_block_1 in our plan? Yes, after line 5: "unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1".
- Constraint 5: Is yellow_block_1 ever on top of black_block_1 and clear in our plan? Yes, after line 8: "stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1". At this point, yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1 and there's no block on top of yellow_block_1, so it's clear.
- Constraint 6: Is green_block_1 ever not on the table in our plan? Yes, after line 1: "unstack green_block_1 yellow_block_1", green_block_1 is in our hand and not on the table.
- Constraint 7: If green_block_1 is not on the table, do we ensure that at the same time or later, either yellow_block_1 is clear or green_block_1 is not clear? After line 1, green_block_1 is not on the table and yellow_block_1 is clear, which satisfies this constraint.

It seems like all constraints are satisfied. However, I notice that I'm not using all the blocks in the most optimal way. Let's try to simplify the plan further, while still satisfying all constraints.

Actually, I think this is a quite optimal plan already. I can't think of a more efficient way to satisfy all the constraints. Let's double check each step to see if any can be removed:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1: This is necessary to make yellow_block_1 clear (required for constraint 7) and because we need to stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1 later.
2. Stack green_block_1 on black_block_2: This is necessary to make black_block_2 not clear (constraint 1).
3. Unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1: This is necessary to access blue_block_1 (for constraint 4) and to stack something on brown_block_1 (for constraint 3).
4. Stack black_block_2 on brown_block_1: This is necessary to make brown_block_1 not clear (constraint 3).
5. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1: This is necessary to hold blue_block_1 (constraint 4) and to stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1 later.
6. Putdown blue_block_1: This is necessary to free our hand for the next action.
7. Pickup yellow_block_1: This is necessary to stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1.
8. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1: This is necessary to satisfy constraint 5.
9. Unstack black_block_2 from brown_block_1: This is necessary to unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1 later.
10. Putdown black_block_2: This is necessary to free our hand for the next action.
11. Unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1: This is necessary to move brown_block_1 to the table (the goal).
12. Putdown brown_block_1: This is the goal.

It seems like all steps are necessary. I don't think we can simplify the plan further. 

In fact, since constraint 3 requires that if black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1 (which is true in the initial state), then at the same time or later, either red_block_1 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear, and constraint 5 requires that at some point yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1 and clear, we need to unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1 before we can stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1. And to unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1, we need to unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1 first. 

Let's try one final approach.

Alright, I want to make sure we're interpreting constraint 3 correctly. It says: "If black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1, then at the same time or later, either red_block_1 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear."

In our plan, we ensure that brown_block_1 is not clear by stacking black_block_2 on it. But we could potentially optimize our plan by simply placing a block on brown_block_1, and then continuing with the rest of the constraints.

Actually, looking back at the constraints, I think I'm overthinking things. The constraints are more like "at some point in the plan, this must be true", rather than "the plan must end with this being true". 

Given that, I think the plan I've constructed is already optimal. We take care of all constraints in sequence and then achieve the goal. I don't believe we can do better than that.

So, the final optimal plan is:

```
unstack green_block_1 yellow_block_1
stack green_block_1 black_block_2
unstack black_block_2 blue_block_1
stack black_block_2 brown_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
pickup yellow_block_1
stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1
unstack black_block_2 brown_block_1
putdown black_block_2
unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
```

This plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal.

Hmm, are we sure we've constructed the most optimal plan? Let me try to see if there's a shorter plan. Maybe instead of unstacking green_block_1 from yellow_block_1 and then stacking it on black_block_2, we could directly stack black_block_2 on brown_block_1 to satisfy constraint 3. Then, we could unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1 to satisfy constraint 4, and unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1 to make yellow_block_1 clear. Then, we can stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1 to satisfy constraint 5. Finally, we can unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1 and put it on the table to achieve the goal.

Let's construct this alternative plan:

```
unstack black_block_2 blue_block_1
stack black_block_2 brown_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
unstack green_block_1 yellow_block_1
putdown green_block_1
pickup yellow_block_1
stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1
unstack black_block_2 brown_block_1
putdown black_block_2
unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
```

Wait, this doesn't satisfy constraint 1. We need to ensure that black_block_2 is not clear at some point, and in this plan, black_block_2 is clear throughout. 

So, let's revert to our original plan, which I believe is the most optimal:

```
unstack green_block_1 yellow_block_1
stack green_block_1 black_block_2
unstack black_block_2 blue_block_1
stack black_block_2 brown_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
pickup yellow_block_1
stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1
unstack black_block_2 brown_block_1
putdown black_block_2
unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
```

This plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal.

Actually, I think constraint 1 is just asking for us to have a block on top of black_block_2 at some point, and this can be satisfied with either green_block_1 or blue_block_1 on top. If we put green_block_1 on top, we need to unstack it from yellow_block_1 first; if we put blue_block_1 on top, we need to unstack it from black_block_1 first. 

Let's double-check all the constraints one more time:

1. black_block_2 should not be clear: We need to stack something on top of black_block_2 at some point.
2. black_block_1 should not be on top of brown_block_1: This is true in the initial state, so constraint 2 is automatically satisfied.
3. If black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1, then at the same time or later, either red_block_1 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear: Since black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1 in the initial state, we need to make either red_block_1 not on the table or brown_block_1 not clear at some point.
4. You should hold blue_block_1: We need to unstack blue_block_1 at some point.
5. yellow_block_1 should be on top of black_block_1 and clear: We need to stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1 at some point.
6. green_block_1 should not be on the table: This is true in the initial state, so constraint 6 is automatically satisfied.
7. If green_block_1 is not on the table, then at the same time or later, either yellow_block_1 is clear or green_block_1 is not clear: Since green_block_1 is not on the table in the initial state, we need to make either yellow_block_1 clear or green_block_1 not clear at some point.

I think now I'm ready to provide an optimal plan. Based on a systematic analysis of the constraints, here's what we need to do:

Wait, but I still think my previous plan is optimal. Let's check it again.

Ok, so my previous plan is optimal (ignoring any symmetries that might lead to a plan of the same length, e.g., we could swap the roles of green_block_1 and blue_block_1 in some parts of the plan):

```
unstack green_block_1 yellow_block_1
stack green_block_1 black_block_2
unstack black_block_2 blue_block_1
stack black_block_2 brown_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
pickup yellow_block_1
stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1
unstack black_block_2 brown_block_1
putdown black_block_2
unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
```

I'm convinced this is the most optimal plan given the constraints and the goal.
