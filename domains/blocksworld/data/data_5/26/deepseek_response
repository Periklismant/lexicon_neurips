unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1

unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1

**Explanation:**

1. **Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1** to access the lower blocks.
2. **Put down white_block_1** to free the gripper.
3. **Unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1** to make blue_block_1 accessible.
4. **Pick up blue_block_1** (satisfies constraint requiring holding blue_block_1).
5. **Put down blue_block_1** to free the gripper for other actions.
6. **Pick up blue_block_2** (satisfies constraint requiring holding blue_block_2).
7. **Stack blue_block_2 onto yellow_block_1** (satisfies constraint: yellow_block_1 is not clear).
8. **Unstack blue_block_2 from yellow_block_1** to prepare to pick up yellow_block_1.
9. **Put down blue_block_2** to free the gripper.
10. **Pick up white_block_2** to move it off the table (satisfies constraint related to white_block_2).
11. **Stack white_block_2 onto brown_block_1** (satisfies constraints: white_block_2 not on table and brown_block_1 has a block on top).
12. **Pick up yellow_block_1** to achieve the goal.

This plan ensures all constraints are met with minimal steps.
