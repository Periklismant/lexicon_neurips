Okay, let's see. The goal is to have the robotic arm holding yellow_block_1. But there are several constraints to satisfy. Hmm, where to start?

First, the initial state. Let me recap. The blocks are arranged as follows:

- blue_block_1 is on the table, with grey_block_1 on top of it, and white_block_1 on top of grey_block_1. So that's a tower of three blocks: blue, grey, white. All others (white_block_2, blue_block_2, yellow_block_1, brown_block_1) are on the table and clear.

The robot isn't holding anything initially. So to get yellow_block_1 into the hand, maybe just pick it up. But wait, the constraints complicate things.

Looking at the constraints:

1. At some state, yellow_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2.
2. If that's true in a state, then white_block_2 must not be on the table at that state or later.
3. Must hold blue_block_1 at some point.
4. Must have a block on top of yellow_block_1 (so it's not clear) in some state.
5. If yellow_block_1 is not clear, then earlier there must be either grey_block_1 on blue_block_2 or holding blue_block_2.
6. Must hold blue_block_2 at some point.
7. In some state, white_block_2 is not on the table and brown_block_1 has a block on top.

Wow, that's a lot. Let's tackle them one by one.

First, the goal is to hold yellow_block_1. So the plan must end with either picking it up or unstacking it from something. But since yellow_block_1 is on the table and clear initially, we can just do pickup yellow_block_1. But the constraints may require other actions.

Constraints:

Constraint 3: Must hold blue_block_1. So somewhere in the plan, we have to pick up blue_block_1. But blue_block_1 is under grey_block_1 and white_block_1. So to get blue_block_1, we need to unstack the blocks above it. Let's see: white_block_1 is on grey_block_1. So first, unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1. Then unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1. Then pickup blue_block_1. So that's three actions. Then we can put it down or stack it somewhere else. But maybe we need to do this to satisfy constraint 3.

Constraint 6: Must hold blue_block_2. Since blue_block_2 is on the table and clear, we can just pick it up, then put it down again. But maybe stacking it somewhere.

Constraint 4: Need a block on top of yellow_block_1. So we have to stack some block on it. But yellow is on the table. So perhaps stack another block on it. But to do that, we need to have a block in hand. So maybe after picking up some block, stack it on yellow_block_1. But then constraint 5: If yellow is not clear, then earlier state must have grey_block_1 on blue_block_2 or holding blue_block_2. So perhaps we need to either stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2 or hold blue_block_2 before stacking something on yellow.

Constraint 7: white_block_2 is not on the table (so it's on some block) and brown_block_1 has a block on top. So we need to stack something on brown_block_1 and move white_block_2 somewhere.

Constraint 2: If yellow is not on blue_block_2 in some state, then white_block_2 must not be on the table in that state or later. So if we have a state where yellow is not on blue_block_2, we must ensure that white_block_2 is moved off the table after that. Since initially, white_block_2 is on the table. So if we have a state where yellow isn't on blue_block_2, then we need to move white_block_2 off the table either then or later. But maybe the easiest way is to stack white_block_2 onto some block. For example, stack white_block_2 on brown_block_1, which would satisfy constraint 7 (since brown_block_1 then has a block on top, and white_block_2 is not on the table). So that's a way to handle constraints 2 and 7.

Putting this all together.

Let's outline possible steps:

1. Unstack the tower on blue_block_1 to be able to hold it (for constraint 3). So unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1, then unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1. Then pickup blue_block_1. Then put it down again, perhaps.

But that's several steps. Maybe after that, stack blue_block_1 on something else. But maybe that's not necessary. Just holding it once is enough for constraint 3.

But holding blue_block_1 requires first unstacking the blocks above. So:

Action 1: unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1
Effect: white_block_1 is in hand, grey_block_1 is clear.

Action 2: putdown white_block_1
Now white_block_1 is on table, clear. Then:

Action 3: unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
Effect: grey_block_1 in hand, blue_block_1 clear.

Action 4: putdown grey_block_1
Now grey_block_1 on table.

Action 5: pickup blue_block_1
Now holding blue_block_1. That satisfies constraint 3. Then putdown blue_block_1 again? Or use it somewhere else.

But maybe there's a shorter way. Wait, the problem requires an optimal plan with minimal steps. So maybe there's a way to hold blue_block_1 without putting down the other blocks. Let me think.

Alternatively, unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1, then unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1, then pickup blue_block_1. Then we have to put it down somewhere. So three actions to get blue_block_1. Then we have to hold blue_block_2 (constraint 6). So perhaps after putting down blue_block_1, pick up blue_block_2. Then maybe stack it somewhere.

But let's see. Let's also handle constraint 7. We need to have white_block_2 not on the table and brown_block_1 has a block on top. So stack white_block_2 on brown_block_1. That would take: pickup white_block_2, stack white_block_2 brown_block_1. That's two actions. Then white_block_2 is not on the table, and brown_block_1 is not clear. So that satisfies constraint 7.

But when do we do that? Also, the constraint 2 says that if at any state, yellow is not on blue_block_2, then white_block_2 must not be on the table in that state or after. So, if we have a state where yellow isn't on blue_block_2 (which is true in the initial state), then we need to move white_block_2 off the table at some point. But if we stack white_block_2 on brown_block_1, that's sufficient. So perhaps that needs to happen after that state where yellow isn't on blue_block_2. But the initial state has yellow not on blue_block_2, so we must ensure that white_block_2 is moved off the table in some state after the initial state. So moving white_block_2 to brown_block_1 would satisfy that.

Now, for constraint 4: need to have a block on top of yellow_block_1. So we need to stack something on it. Let's say we stack blue_block_2 on yellow_block_1. But before that, we have to pick up blue_block_2. But we need to hold blue_block_2 at some point (constraint 6), so that's good. So steps: pickup blue_block_2, stack blue_block_2 yellow_block_1. Then yellow_block_1 is not clear. But according to constraint 5, when we do that, there must be an earlier state where either grey_block_1 is on blue_block_2 or we are holding blue_block_2. Well, if we are holding blue_block_2 to stack it on yellow, then during that action, we are holding blue_block_2. So that satisfies the condition for constraint 5. Because the earlier state is when we are holding blue_block_2. So that's okay.

But then, when we stack blue_block_2 onto yellow_block_1, that would make yellow not clear. Then to get yellow_block_1 into hand, we need to unstack blue_block_2 from it. But wait, the goal is to have the arm holding yellow_block_1. So after stacking blue_block_2 on yellow, we would need to unstack blue_block_2 from yellow to then pick up yellow. But that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps stack another block on yellow_block_1. Wait, but how do we get to hold yellow_block_1 in the end?

Alternatively, stack a different block on yellow, then unstack it. Let's see.

But maybe the optimal path is to first handle the constraints, then pick up yellow.

Let me try to outline the steps step by step, considering all constraints.

1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1. Now holding white_block_1. Then put it down.

2. Unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1. Now holding grey_block_1. Then put it down.

3. Pickup blue_block_1. Now holding blue_block_1 (satisfies constraint 3). Then put it down again.

But that's a lot of steps. Maybe there's a smarter way. For example, after unstacking white and grey, just pickup blue_block_1. Then maybe stack it somewhere else. But perhaps necessary steps.

Alternatively, after unstacking white and grey, then pickup blue_block_1 and stack it on another block. But that might not be necessary. Let's see.

But let's proceed. Then, after putting down blue_block_1, we need to handle blue_block_2 (constraint 6). So:

4. Pickup blue_block_2. Now holding blue_block_2 (satisfies constraint 6). Then stack it on yellow_block_1. Now yellow_block_1 is not clear (satisfies constraint 4). But before stacking, when holding blue_block_2, that satisfies the precondition for constraint 5 (the earlier state is holding blue_block_2 when stacking it on yellow). So constraint 5 is satisfied.

5. Then, we need to unstack blue_block_2 from yellow_block_1 to pick up yellow_block_1. But wait, to unstack blue_block_2 from yellow, we need to have blue_block_2 clear. But after stacking, blue_block_2 is on yellow, and it's clear. So we can unstack blue_block_2 from yellow_block_1. Then put it down. Then pickup yellow_block_1.

But that's more steps. Alternatively, after stacking blue_block_2 on yellow, we need to unstack it. But perhaps that's necessary.

Alternatively, instead of stacking blue_block_2 on yellow, stack another block. Let's think. But we need to have a block on top of yellow (constraint 4), so it can be any block. Suppose we use white_block_2. Then stack white_block_2 on yellow. But to do that, need to pick up white_block_2. Then stack it on yellow. But then white_block_2 is not on the table, which helps with constraint 7. Wait, constraint 7 requires that in some state, white_block_2 is not on the table and brown_block_1 has a block on top. So if we stack white_block_2 on brown_block_1, that would satisfy both parts of constraint 7. Because white_block_2 is not on the table, and brown_block_1 has a block on top. So that's better.

So steps for constraint 7: pickup white_block_2, stack white_block_2 brown_block_1. Now white_block_2 is not on the table and brown_block_1 is not clear. So that satisfies constraint 7. Also, since we have to move white_block_2 off the table at some point (due to constraint 2, since in the initial state, yellow is not on blue_block_2, so we need to move white_block_2 off the table at some point). By stacking it on brown_block_1, that's done. So that handles both constraints 2 and 7.

So let's plan that.

But let's outline all steps step by step.

First, handle constraint 3: hold blue_block_1.

Initial state: blue_block_1 is under grey and white. So:

1. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1. Now holding white_block_1. Then put it down.

2. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1. Now holding grey_block_1. Then put it down.

3. pickup blue_block_1. Now holding blue_block_1. (satisfies constraint 3). Then putdown blue_block_1. Now it's back on the table.

But maybe we can hold blue_block_1 and then use it elsewhere. But perhaps not necessary. So after step 3, we put it down again.

Then, handle constraint 6: hold blue_block_2. So:

4. pickup blue_block_2. Now holding blue_block_2 (satisfies constraint 6). Then stack blue_block_2 on some block. But which one? If we stack it on yellow_block_1, then that would satisfy constraint 4 (yellow has a block on top). Also, when we stack blue_block_2 on yellow, then the state after stacking would have yellow not clear. Then, according to constraint 5, we need to have an earlier state where either grey_block_1 is on blue_block_2 or holding blue_block_2. Since we are holding blue_block_2 in step 4, that satisfies the condition for constraint 5. So stacking blue_block_2 on yellow satisfies constraint 4 and 5.

So:

5. stack blue_block_2 yellow_block_1. Now, blue_block_2 is on yellow, yellow is not clear (constraint 4 done). Also, during step 4, we were holding blue_block_2, which satisfies the earlier state needed for constraint 5.

Now, to get yellow_block_1 into the hand, we need to unstack blue_block_2 from it. Because yellow is on the table, but blue_block_2 is on top. So:

6. unstack blue_block_2 yellow_block_1. Now holding blue_block_2. Then put it down.

7. pickup yellow_block_1. Now holding yellow_block_1, which is the goal.

But also, during the plan, we need to handle constraint 7: stack white_block_2 on brown_block_1. Let's insert that somewhere.

But when? Let's see.

If we do that before moving white_block_2, but the initial state has white_block_2 on the table. We need to ensure that after a state where yellow is not on blue_block_2 (which is the case in initial state and after step 6 when we unstack blue_block_2 from yellow), we have to move white_block_2 off the table. So after step 6, when blue_block_2 is put down, yellow is clear again. So perhaps after step 6, we need to ensure that white_block_2 is not on the table. So maybe we need to stack white_block_2 on brown_block_1 after that.

But how to fit that into the plan.

Alternatively, after step 3 (when we have put down blue_block_1), maybe do the steps to move white_block_2.

But let's try to plan all steps:

1. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1
2. putdown white_block_1
3. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
4. putdown grey_block_1
5. pickup blue_block_1 (constraint 3)
6. putdown blue_block_1
7. pickup blue_block_2 (constraint 6)
8. stack blue_block_2 yellow_block_1 (constraint 4)
9. unstack blue_block_2 yellow_block_1
10. putdown blue_block_2
11. pickup white_block_2
12. stack white_block_2 brown_block_1 (satisfies constraint 7)
13. pickup yellow_block_1 (goal)

But let's check constraints.

Constraint 2: If in any state, yellow is not on blue_block_2, then white_block_2 must not be on the table in that state or later. 

In the initial state, yellow is not on blue_block_2. So white_block_2 must be moved off the table at some point. We move it in step 12. So after the initial state, we do move white_block_2 off. So that's okay.

But what about after step 9, when we unstack blue_block_2 from yellow_block_1. At that point, yellow is not on blue_block_2 (since blue_block_2 is being held). So in that state, we need to ensure that white_block_2 is moved off the table. But step 12 is after that, so as long as step 12 is after step 9, then white_block_2 is moved off. So step 11 and 12 are after step 9. That's correct.

But in the plan above, step 12 is after step 9, so after that, white_block_2 is not on the table. So constraint 2 is satisfied.

Also, constraint 7 is satisfied in step 12.

Now, checking the other constraints:

Constraint 3: pickup blue_block_1 in step 5.

Constraint 6: pickup blue_block_2 in step 7.

Constraint 4: stack blue_block_2 yellow_block_1 in step 8.

Constraint 5: when we stack blue_block_2 on yellow (step8), the previous step (step7) is holding blue_block_2, so the earlier state is holding blue_block_2, satisfying constraint5.

Constraint 1: yellow_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2 in some state. Initially, that's true. Also, after step 9 when we unstack blue_block_2 from yellow, yellow is not on blue_block_2. So constraint1 is satisfied.

So all constraints are met.

But the plan has 13 steps. But maybe we can optimize.

Wait, perhaps we can avoid putting down blue_block_1. For example, after step 5 (holding blue_block_1), instead of putting it down, can we stack it somewhere else, which might save steps.

But since the goal is to hold yellow_block_1, maybe stacking blue_block_1 on another block isn't necessary, unless it helps. Let's see.

Alternatively, after step 5 (holding blue_block_1), can we use it for something else. For example, stack it on blue_block_2. Then, when we need to hold blue_block_2, we can unstack blue_block_1 from blue_block_2. But that might add steps. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps we can do the following:

After step 5 (holding blue_block_1), stack it on some block. Then, when we need to pick up blue_block_2, it's still on the table. So that might not help.

Alternatively, after step 5, instead of putting down blue_block_1, just proceed. Let me think.

Wait, after step 5: holding blue_block_1. Then, to pick up blue_block_2, we need to put down blue_block_1. So step6 is necessary. So maybe no way around that.

Another optimization: after unstacking white and grey, instead of putting them down, maybe stack them somewhere else. But that might not save steps.

Alternatively, after unstacking white_block_1 from grey_block_1 (step1), instead of putting it down (step2), use it to stack on brown_block_1. Let's see:

1. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1 (holding white_block_1)
2. stack white_block_1 brown_block_1 (now white_block_1 is on brown_block_1; brown_block_1 is not clear. Also, white_block_1 is not on the table. So this satisfies constraint7 (white_block_2 is not on the table? Wait, no. White_block_1 is on brown_block_1, but white_block_2 is still on the table. So this doesn't handle constraint7. Wait, constraint7 requires white_block_2 not on the table and brown_block_1 has a block. So that would require moving white_block_2. So my previous plan is better, where step12 stacks white_block_2 on brown_block_1.

Alternatively, if after step1, we stack white_block_1 on brown_block_1, then white_block_1 is not on the table, but that's not relevant for constraint7 which involves white_block_2.

So back to original plan.

Another thought: when we stack blue_block_2 on yellow_block_1 (step8), we can then unstack it (step9) and then put it down (step10). Then, to get yellow, we pick it up (step13). But perhaps after step10, instead of putting down blue_block_2, can we stack it on brown_block_1, but then white_block_2 is still on the table.

Wait, no. Because we still need to move white_block_2 off the table. So maybe after step9, when we are holding blue_block_2, we can stack it on brown_block_1. Then white_block_2 is still on the table, but we have to move it. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, after step9 (holding blue_block_2), stack it on white_block_2. Then white_block_2 is no longer on the table. But then brown_block_1 would still need a block on top. So perhaps stack blue_block_2 on white_block_2, then stack white_block_2 on brown_block_1. But that would require more steps.

Alternatively, after step9, put down blue_block_2 (step10), then pickup white_block_2 (step11), stack it on brown_block_1 (step12), then pickup yellow_block_1 (step13). That's the same as the previous plan.

So I think the previous plan works, but it's quite long. Let me count the steps again:

1. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1
2. putdown white_block_1
3. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
4. putdown grey_block_1
5. pickup blue_block_1
6. putdown blue_block_1
7. pickup blue_block_2
8. stack blue_block_2 yellow_block_1
9. unstack blue_block_2 yellow_block_1
10. putdown blue_block_2
11. pickup white_block_2
12. stack white_block_2 brown_block_1
13. pickup yellow_block_1

That's 13 steps. Is there a shorter way?

Wait, maybe after step5 (holding blue_block_1), instead of putting it down (step6), can we use it for something else. For example, stack it on blue_block_2. Then, when we need to pick up blue_block_2, we can unstack blue_block_1 from blue_block_2. But this would add steps. Let's see:

Alternative plan:

1. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1
2. putdown white_block_1
3. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
4. putdown grey_block_1
5. pickup blue_block_1 (hold it)
6. stack blue_block_1 blue_block_2 (now blue_block_2 has blue_block_1 on top)
7. unstack blue_block_1 blue_block_2 (now holding blue_block_1 again)
8. putdown blue_block_1
9. pickup blue_block_2 (now holding blue_block_2)
10. stack blue_block_2 yellow_block_1 (satisfy constraint4)
11. unstack blue_block_2 yellow_block_1
12. putdown blue_block_2
13. pickup white_block_2
14. stack white_block_2 brown_block_1
15. pickup yellow_block_1

This is longer. So no improvement.

Alternative approach: try to minimize steps by combining objectives.

For example, when moving white_block_2 to brown_block_1 (for constraint7), maybe do that earlier. Let's say:

After step3 (holding grey_block_1), instead of putting it down, stack it on blue_block_2. Then, that satisfies the condition for constraint5 (grey_block_1 on blue_block_2). Then, later when stacking something on yellow, the earlier state has grey_block_1 on blue_block_2.

Wait, but then when we need to stack a block on yellow_block_1 (to satisfy constraint4), the earlier state would have grey_block_1 on blue_block_2, which satisfies constraint5's condition.

So here's an alternative plan:

1. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1
2. putdown white_block_1
3. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1 (holding grey_block_1)
4. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2 (now grey_block_1 is on blue_block_2. This satisfies the earlier condition for constraint5 when we later stack something on yellow_block_1.)

Then, proceed:

5. pickup blue_block_1 (now holding blue_block_1, satisfies constraint3)
6. putdown blue_block_1
7. pickup blue_block_2 (now holding blue_block_2, satisfies constraint6)
8. stack blue_block_2 yellow_block_1 (satisfies constraint4. Also, since grey_block_1 is on blue_block_2 (from step4), which is an earlier state where grey_block_1 is on blue_block_2, so satisfies constraint5.)

Then:

9. unstack blue_block_2 yellow_block_1 (holding blue_block_2)
10. putdown blue_block_2
11. pickup white_block_2
12. stack white_block_2 brown_block_1 (satisfies constraint7)
13. pickup yellow_block_1 (goal)

This plan has 13 steps as well, but maybe some steps can be saved. Let's see:

Steps:

1. unstack W1 G1
2. putdown W1
3. unstack G1 B1
4. stack G1 B2
5. pickup B1
6. putdown B1
7. pickup B2
8. stack B2 Y1
9. unstack B2 Y1
10. putdown B2
11. pickup W2
12. stack W2 Br1
13. pickup Y1

But this way, when we stack B2 on Y1 (step8), the earlier state (step4) has G1 on B2, which satisfies constraint5.

But we also need to check constraint2: when in any state where Y1 is not on B2, then W2 is not on the table in that state or after.

After step9, Y1 is not on B2 (since we unstack B2 from Y1). So after step9, we need to ensure W2 is not on the table. Step12 does that. So step12 is after step9, which is correct.

This plan also satisfies all constraints. But it's still 13 steps. Is there a way to make it shorter?

Wait, let's count steps again. The steps are:

1. unstack W1 G1
2. putdown W1
3. unstack G1 B1
4. stack G1 B2
5. pickup B1
6. putdown B1
7. pickup B2
8. stack B2 Y1
9. unstack B2 Y1
10. putdown B2
11. pickup W2
12. stack W2 Br1
13. pickup Y1

But in this plan, after step4, G1 is on B2. So in step4, we've stacked G1 on B2. But then in step7, we pick up B2. Wait, no. B2 is on the table initially. If we stack G1 on B2, then B2 is under G1. So when we try to pickup B2 in step7, it's not clear, because G1 is on top. So that's a problem.

Ah, here's a mistake. If in step4, we stack grey_block_1 (G1) on blue_block_2 (B2), then B2 now has G1 on top. So B2 is not clear. Therefore, in step7, we can't pickup B2 because B2 has a block on top (G1). Therefore, this plan is invalid.

So this approach is incorrect. Therefore, we need to avoid that.

So the previous approach where we stack blue_block_2 on yellow is better, but requires unstacking it later. So perhaps the initial plan is correct, but with a mistake in stacking grey on B2.

So back to original plan:

1. unstack W1 G1
2. putdown W1
3. unstack G1 B1
4. putdown G1
5. pickup B1
6. putdown B1
7. pickup B2
8. stack B2 Y1
9. unstack B2 Y1
10. putdown B2
11. pickup W2
12. stack W2 Br1
13. pickup Y1

This is valid, but step6 and step10 are putdowns that may be unnecessary. Is there a way to avoid putting down B1 and B2?

For example, after step5 (holding B1), instead of putting it down, can we stack it somewhere else, but we need to hold B2 later. Since we can't hold B2 while holding B1, we need to put down B1 first.

Alternatively, after step5, stack B1 on some block, but that would require that block to be clear. For example, stack B1 on Y1. Then, B1 is on Y1. Then, when we need to stack B2 on Y1, we have to unstack B1 first. Which adds steps.

Not helpful.

So perhaps the initial plan is the shortest possible given the constraints. Each constraint requires additional steps.

Another thought: can we combine moving white_block_2 to brown_block_1 with another action?

For example, after step7 (holding B2), stack B2 on brown_block_1, then stack W2 on B2. But that would satisfy constraint7 (W2 not on table, brown_block_1 has B2 on top). But then B2 is on brown_block_1, so stacking B2 on Y1 later isn't possible. Hmm.

Alternatively, stack W2 on brown_block_1 first. So:

After step5 (holding B1), putdown B1 (step6), then:

7. pickup W2

8. stack W2 Br1 (now W2 is not on table, Br1 has W2 on top, satisfies constraint7)

9. pickup B2 (constraint6)

10. stack B2 Y1 (constraint4)

11. unstack B2 Y1

12. putdown B2

13. pickup Y1

But this way, the steps would be:

1. unstack W1 G1

2. putdown W1

3. unstack G1 B1

4. putdown G1

5. pickup B1 (constraint3)

6. putdown B1

7. pickup W2

8. stack W2 Br1 (constraint7)

9. pickup B2 (constraint6)

10. stack B2 Y1 (constraint4)

11. unstack B2 Y1

12. putdown B2

13. pickup Y1

This is 13 steps as well. But the order of stacking W2 and B2 is swapped. But this might be valid. Let's check constraints:

- Constraint2: whenever Y1 is not on B2, W2 must not be on the table. In the initial state, Y1 is not on B2, so W2 must be moved. This is done in step8. So after step8, W2 is on Br1. So constraint2 is satisfied.

- Constraint5: when stacking B2 on Y1 (step10), we need an earlier state where either G1 is on B2 or holding B2. Here, step9 is holding B2, which is earlier than step10. So constraint5 is satisfied.

- All other constraints are met.

But is this plan shorter? No, same steps. But perhaps the order of steps can be adjusted to save steps.

Wait, perhaps after stacking W2 on Br1 (step8), then pickup B2 and stack on Y1. Then unstack B2 and pickup Y1. But steps are same.

Alternatively, after stacking W2 on Br1, then pickup B2, stack on Y1, unstack, putdown, then pickup Y1. Same steps.

So no difference in steps.

Is there any way to reduce steps?

What if after step3 (unstack G1 B1), instead of putting down G1, we stack it on B2. Then:

1. unstack W1 G1

2. putdown W1

3. unstack G1 B1

4. stack G1 B2 (now G1 is on B2)

5. pickup B1 (constraint3)

6. putdown B1

7. pickup B2 (but B2 has G1 on top, so can't pickup. So invalid.)

Thus, invalid.

Alternative idea: after step3 (unstack G1 B1), putdown G1 on B2. But B2 must be clear. Initially, B2 is clear. So:

4. stack G1 B2. Now B2 has G1 on top.

Then step5: pickup B1 (constraint3), putdown.

Step6: pickup B2 (can't, because G1 is on B2. So invalid.)

So no good.

Another angle: constraint3 requires holding B1. To do that, we need to unstack G1 and W1. So the three steps (unstack W1, unstack G1, pickup B1) are unavoidable. Plus putdown steps if needed. So steps1-5 are necessary.

Similarly, constraint6 requires holding B2, which is on the table, so one step to pickup.

Constraint4 requires stacking something on Y1. So two steps (pickup, stack).

Constraint7 requires stacking W2 on Br1. Two steps (pickup, stack).

Then to pickup Y1, we need to unstack whatever is on top. If we stacked B2 on Y1, then unstack B2 (two steps), then pickup Y1.

But that's four steps for B2.

So total steps:

Unstack W1 (1), putdown (2), unstack G1 (3), putdown (4), pickup B1 (5), putdown (6) => 6 steps for constraint3.

Pickup B2 (7), stack on Y1 (8) => 2 steps for constraints4 and6.

Unstack B2 (9), putdown (10) => 2 steps to clear Y1.

Pickup W2 (11), stack on Br1 (12) => 2 steps for constraint7.

Pickup Y1 (13) => goal.

Total 13 steps.

Is there any way to reduce this?

Wait, after step8 (stack B2 on Y1), can we leave B2 there and somehow still pick up Y1? No, because Y1 is under B2, and to pickup Y1, it must be clear. So unless we unstack B2 from Y1, we can't pick up Y1. So unstack is necessary.

Alternative idea: instead of stacking B2 on Y1, stack another block. For example, stack W2 on Y1. Then, when we unstack W2 from Y1, we can then pickup Y1. Let's try this approach.

So steps:

1. unstack W1 G1

2. putdown W1

3. unstack G1 B1

4. putdown G1

5. pickup B1 (constraint3)

6. putdown B1

7. pickup W2

8. stack W2 Br1 (constraint7)

9. pickup B2 (constraint6)

10. stack B2 Y1 (constraint4)

11. unstack B2 Y1

12. putdown B2

13. pickup Y1

But this is also 13 steps. Not better.

Another thought: can we use the blocks that are already in the initial state to satisfy some constraints. For example, grey_block_1 is on blue_block_1. If we can stack grey on blue_block_2, that would satisfy the condition for constraint5 (grey on blue2). But to do that, we need to unstack grey from blue1 and stack it on blue2. Which would take steps.

But then when we stack something on yellow, that satisfies constraint5.

Alternatively, after unstacking grey from blue1, stack it on blue2. Then when we stack something on yellow, the earlier state has grey on blue2. So that's good.

So let's try:

1. unstack W1 G1

2. putdown W1

3. unstack G1 B1

4. stack G1 B2 (now G1 is on B2)

5. pickup B1 (constraint3)

6. putdown B1

7. pickup B2 (can't, because G1 is on B2. So invalid.)

Thus, invalid.

So no good.

Hmm. It seems that regardless of the approach, the steps required to satisfy all constraints and reach the goal will be around 13 steps. But maybe I'm missing a smarter way.

Wait, what if we stack white_block_1 on brown_block_1 instead of white_block_2. But constraint7 requires white_block_2 not on the table and brown_block_1 has a block. So moving white_block_2 is necessary.

Another approach: use the blocks in the initial tower.

The initial tower is B1 (blue), G1 (grey), W1 (white). 

If we unstack W1 and G1, and use G1 to stack on B2. Then, when stacking on Y1, the earlier state has G1 on B2, satisfying constraint5.

But after that, how to get B2.

Wait, after stacking G1 on B2, B2 is not clear. So we can't pick it up. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, after stacking G1 on B2, then unstack G1 from B2 to pickup B2. But that would add steps.

Alternatively, after stacking G1 on B2, then unstack G1 and put it down, then pickup B2. But again, more steps.

So perhaps it's better to not stack G1 on B2 and instead use the fact that we held B2.

Another thought: the initial state has yellow_block_1 on the table. To have a block on top of it (constraint4), we need to stack something. The easiest is to stack blue_block_2 on it, which requires holding B2 (satisfies constraint6) and then stacking.

But then unstack B2 to pick up Y1.

But the steps are necessary.

So perhaps the initial plan is correct, but I'm missing a shorter path.

Wait, what if we don't put down B1 after picking it up (step5). Let's say after step5, we hold B1. Then, can we stack B1 on some block, but that requires the block to be clear. For example, stack B1 on B2. Then B2 has B1 on top. Then, to pick up B2, we need to unstack B1 first.

But this would add steps. So:

1. unstack W1 G1

2. putdown W1

3. unstack G1 B1

4. putdown G1

5. pickup B1

6. stack B1 B2

7. unstack B1 B2

8. putdown B1

9. pickup B2

10. stack B2 Y1

11. unstack B2 Y1

12. putdown B2

13. pickup W2

14. stack W2 Br1

15. pickup Y1

This is longer, 15 steps. Not better.

So no.

Alternative idea: combine the move of white_block_2 to brown_block_1 with another action. For example, after step7 (holding B2), use it to stack on Br1. But then constraint4 is not met.

Alternatively, after stacking B2 on Y1 (step8), then stack W2 on Br1.

But that's the same as before.

I think the initial plan is the optimal one, given the constraints.

So the final plan is:

```
unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1
putdown white_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
pickup blue_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
pickup blue_block_2
stack blue_block_2 yellow_block_1
unstack blue_block_2 yellow_block_1
putdown blue_block_2
pickup white_block_2
stack white_block_2 brown_block_1
pickup yellow_block_1
```
