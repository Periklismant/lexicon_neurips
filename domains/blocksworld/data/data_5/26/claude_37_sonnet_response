Let's analyze the planning problem:

Initial State:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- white_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- white_block_2 is on the table
- blue_block_2 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is clear
- white_block_2 is clear
- blue_block_2 is clear
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- brown_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Goal:
- you are holding yellow_block_1

Constraints:
1. In at least one state, yellow_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2
2. If yellow_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2 in some state s, then white_block_2 is not on the table in state s or some state after s
3. In at least one state, you are holding blue_block_1
4. In at least one state, there is a block on top of yellow_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is not clear)
5. If yellow_block_1 is not clear in some state, then there must be an earlier state where either grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2 or you are holding blue_block_2
6. In at least one state, you are holding blue_block_2
7. In at least one state, both white_block_2 is not on the table and brown_block_1 is not clear (there's a block on top of brown_block_1)

Let's think through this step by step:

1. Initially, yellow_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2, so constraint 1 is satisfied.
2. Constraint 2 means we need to eventually pick up white_block_2 from the table.
3. Constraint 3 requires us to hold blue_block_1 at some point.
4. Constraint 4 requires us to stack some block on top of yellow_block_1 at some point.
5. Constraint 5 implies that before stacking a block on yellow_block_1, we either need to have grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2 or be holding blue_block_2.
6. Constraint 6 requires us to hold blue_block_2 at some point.
7. Constraint 7 requires white_block_2 to be off the table and some block to be on top of brown_block_1 simultaneously.

Let's start planning:

1. We need to stack a block on yellow_block_1 (constraint 4).
2. Before doing that, we need to satisfy constraint 5, which means either stacking grey_block_1 on blue_block_2 or holding blue_block_2.
3. Let's choose to stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2.
4. To do this, we need to first unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1, then unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1, then stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2.
5. After satisfying constraint 5, we can stack a block on yellow_block_1. Let's stack white_block_1 on yellow_block_1.
6. To satisfy constraint 3, we need to hold blue_block_1, which we can do after unstacking grey_block_1 from it.
7. To satisfy constraint 6, we need to hold blue_block_2. We can unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_2 to do this.
8. To satisfy constraint 7, we need white_block_2 off the table and a block on top of brown_block_1. We can achieve this by stacking white_block_2 on brown_block_1.
9. Finally, we need to pick up yellow_block_1 to achieve the goal state.

However, we need to make sure that we can satisfy all constraints while ensuring that we eventually hold yellow_block_1. Let's refine the plan:

1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1.
2. Unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1.
3. Stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2 (satisfying the condition for constraint 5).
4. Stack white_block_1 on yellow_block_1 (satisfying constraint 4).
5. Pickup blue_block_1 (satisfying constraint 3).
6. Putdown blue_block_1.
7. Unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_2.
8. Pickup blue_block_2 (satisfying constraint 6).
9. Putdown blue_block_2.
10. Pickup white_block_2.
11. Stack white_block_2 on brown_block_1 (this and the previous step satisfy constraint 7 because white_block_2 is not on the table and brown_block_1 is not clear).
12. Unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1.
13. Pickup yellow_block_1 (achieving the goal).

Let's verify this plan:

Constraint 1: yellow_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2 in the initial state. Satisfied.
Constraint 2: Initially, yellow_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2, so white_block_2 must not be on the table in that state or a later state. In step 10-11, white_block_2 is picked up and stacked on brown_block_1. Satisfied.
Constraint 3: In step 5, blue_block_1 is being held. Satisfied.
Constraint 4: In step 4, white_block_1 is stacked on yellow_block_1, making it not clear. Satisfied.
Constraint 5: Before yellow_block_1 becomes not clear in step 4, grey_block_1 is stacked on blue_block_2 in step 3. Satisfied.
Constraint 6: In step 8, blue_block_2 is being held. Satisfied.
Constraint 7: In steps 10-11, white_block_2 is picked up and stacked on brown_block_1, making white_block_2 not on the table and brown_block_1 not clear. Satisfied.

Let's double-check our plan for validity by walking through each step and making sure the preconditions for each action are met:

1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1.
   Precondition: white_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1, white_block_1 is clear, and you're not holding any block. All satisfied.

    Effect: You're holding yellow_block_1, yellow_block_1 is not on the table. (Goal achieved)

The plan is valid and satisfies all constraints. Let's clean it up and provide the final solution:

Actually, let me first make sure I'm providing the optimal plan (minimum number of actions):

1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1
2. Unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1
3. Stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2 (for constraint 5)
4. Pickup white_block_1
5. Stack white_block_1 on yellow_block_1 (for constraint 4)
6. Pickup blue_block_1 (for constraint 3)
7. Putdown blue_block_1
8. Unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_2
9. Pickup blue_block_2 (for constraint 6)
10. Putdown blue_block_2
11. Pickup white_block_2
12. Stack white_block_2 on brown_block_1 (for constraint 7)
13. Unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1
14. Putdown white_block_1
15. Pickup yellow_block_1 (goal achieved)

This plan has 15 steps. Let me check if there's a more efficient way to achieve all constraints and the goal.

Actually, I notice an issue with steps 1 and 2 where I unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1 but then don't place it anywhere. Let me correct the plan:

1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1
2. Putdown white_block_1
3. Unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1
4. Stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2 (for constraint 5)
5. Pickup white_block_1
6. Stack white_block_1 on yellow_block_1 (for constraint 4)
7. Pickup blue_block_1 (for constraint 3)
8. Putdown blue_block_1
9. Unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_2
10. Putdown grey_block_1
11. Pickup blue_block_2 (for constraint 6)
12. Putdown blue_block_2
13. Pickup white_block_2
14. Stack white_block_2 on brown_block_1 (for constraint 7)
15. Unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1
16. Putdown white_block_1
17. Pickup yellow_block_1 (goal achieved)

This plan has 17 steps. I don't think we can optimize it further while still satisfying all constraints.

Let me double check the constraints:

1. In at least one state, yellow_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2 - Satisfied (in the initial state and throughout the plan)
2. If yellow_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2 in some state s, then white_block_2 is not on the table in state s or some state after s - Satisfied (white_block_2 is taken off the table in step 13)
3. In at least one state, you are holding blue_block_1 - Satisfied (step 7)
4. In at least one state, there is a block on top of yellow_block_1 - Satisfied (after step 6, white_block_1 is on yellow_block_1)
5. If yellow_block_1 is not clear in some state, then there must be an earlier state where either grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2 or you are holding blue_block_2 - Satisfied (grey_block_1 is stacked on blue_block_2 in step 4, before yellow_block_1 becomes not clear in step 6)
6. In at least one state, you are holding blue_block_2 - Satisfied (step 11)
7. In at least one state, both white_block_2 is not on the table and brown_block_1 is not clear - Satisfied (after step 14, white_block_2 is on brown_block_1, so neither is white_block_2 on the table nor is brown_block_1 clear)

The plan satisfies all constraints. Here's the final solution:

```
unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1
putdown white_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2
pickup white_block_1
stack white_block_1 yellow_block_1
pickup blue_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_2
putdown grey_block_1
pickup blue_block_2
putdown blue_block_2
pickup white_block_2
stack white_block_2 brown_block_1
unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1
putdown white_block_1
pickup yellow_block_1
```

Actually, let me go through the plan again to make sure it's valid and optimal:

Initial State:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- white_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- white_block_2 is on the table
- blue_block_2 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is clear
- white_block_2 is clear
- blue_block_2 is clear
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- brown_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1
   - Now you're holding white_block_1 and grey_block_1 is clear

2. Putdown white_block_1
   - white_block_1 is on the table, clear, and you're not holding anything

3. Unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1
   - Now you're holding grey_block_1 and blue_block_1 is clear

4. Stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2
   - grey_block_1 is on blue_block_2, grey_block_1 is clear, blue_block_2 is not clear, and you're not holding anything
   - This satisfies the condition for constraint 5

5. Pickup blue_block_1
   - Now you're holding blue_block_1
   - This satisfies constraint 3

6. Putdown blue_block_1
   - blue_block_1 is on the table, clear, and you're not holding anything

7. Pickup white_block_1
   - Now you're holding white_block_1

8. Stack white_block_1 on yellow_block_1
   - white_block_1 is on yellow_block_1, white_block_1 is clear, yellow_block_1 is not clear, and you're not holding anything
   - This satisfies constraint 4 and satisfies constraint 5 (since grey_block_1 was on blue_block_2 earlier)

9. Unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_2
   - Now you're holding grey_block_1 and blue_block_2 is clear

10. Putdown grey_block_1
    - grey_block_1 is on the table, clear, and you're not holding anything

11. Pickup blue_block_2
    - Now you're holding blue_block_2
    - This satisfies constraint 6

12. Putdown blue_block_2
    - blue_block_2 is on the table, clear, and you're not holding anything

13. Pickup white_block_2
    - Now you're holding white_block_2 and it's not on the table

14. Stack white_block_2 on brown_block_1
    - white_block_2 is on brown_block_1, white_block_2 is clear, brown_block_1 is not clear, and you're not holding anything
    - This satisfies constraint 7 (white_block_2 not on table and brown_block_1 not clear)

15. Unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1
    - Now you're holding white_block_1 and yellow_block_1 is clear

16. Putdown white_block_1
    - white_block_1 is on the table, clear, and you're not holding anything

17. Pickup yellow_block_1
    - Now you're holding yellow_block_1
    - This achieves the goal

This plan seems valid. Let me check if there's a way to optimize it.

When I think about it, we need to satisfy all constraints and achieve the goal, which is to hold yellow_block_1. The constraints require us to:
1. Have yellow_block_1 not on top of blue_block_2 at some point (satisfied in the initial state)
2. Have white_block_2 not on the table at some point after constraint 1 is satisfied
3. Hold blue_block_1 at some point
4. Have yellow_block_1 not clear at some point
5. Before constraint 4 is satisfied, have grey_block_1 on blue_block_2 or hold blue_block_2
6. Hold blue_block_2 at some point
7. Have white_block_2 not on the table and brown_block_1 not clear simultaneously

The goal is to hold yellow_block_1.

I think we can optimize the plan by eliminating some redundant steps. Here's an optimized plan:

1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1
2. Putdown white_block_1
3. Unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1
4. Stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2 (for constraint 5)
5. Pickup blue_block_1 (for constraint 3)
6. Putdown blue_block_1
7. Pickup white_block_1
8. Stack white_block_1 on yellow_block_1 (for constraint 4)
9. Unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_2
10. Putdown grey_block_1
11. Pickup blue_block_2 (for constraint 6)
12. Putdown blue_block_2
13. Pickup white_block_2
14. Stack white_block_2 on brown_block_1 (for constraint 7)
15. Unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1
16. Putdown white_block_1
17. Pickup yellow_block_1 (goal achieved)

This still has 17 steps. Let me analyze more carefully.

Actually, I notice that the plan doesn't require us to place something on every block we pick up. For example, after we pickup blue_block_1, we can immediately put it down. Similarly for blue_block_2. This makes me think the plan is already optimal.

Let me confirm the plan is valid one more time:

Initial State:
- Stack: white_block_1 on grey_block_1 on blue_block_1
- On table: white_block_2, blue_block_2, yellow_block_1, brown_block_1
- All blocks except grey_block_1 and blue_block_1 are clear
- Hand is empty

1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1
2. Putdown white_block_1
3. Unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1
4. Stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2
5. Pickup blue_block_1
6. Putdown blue_block_1
7. Pickup white_block_1
8. Stack white_block_1 on yellow_block_1
9. Unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_2
10. Putdown grey_block_1
11. Pickup blue_block_2
12. Putdown blue_block_2
13. Pickup white_block_2
14. Stack white_block_2 on brown_block_1
15. Unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1
16. Putdown white_block_1
17. Pickup yellow_block_1

The plan is valid and I believe it's optimal given the constraints we need to satisfy.

Here's the final plan:

unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1
putdown white_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2
pickup blue_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
pickup white_block_1
stack white_block_1 yellow_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_2
putdown grey_block_1
pickup blue_block_2
putdown blue_block_2
pickup white_block_2
stack white_block_2 brown_block_1
unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1
putdown white_block_1
pickup yellow_block_1
