Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get the robotic arm holding red_block_2. But there are several constraints that must be satisfied along the way. Let's break down each constraint and figure out how to incorporate them into the plan.

First, let's look at the initial state. We have several blocks arranged in different stacks:

- red_block_1 has white_block_1 on top, and white_block_1 is clear.
- orange_block_1 has black_block_1, then grey_block_1, then yellow_block_1. So the stack is orange_block_1 -> black_block_1 -> grey_block_1 -> yellow_block_1. Both yellow_block_1 and red_block_2 are clear.
- red_block_2 is on the table and clear.
  
The goal is to have the arm holding red_block_2. So the final action must be either picking up red_block_2 or unstacking it from somewhere. But since red_block_2 is on the table and clear initially, we can just pick it up. However, we need to make sure that all constraints are met during the process.

Now, let's list all the constraints:

1. Must hold black_block_1 at some state.
2. red_block_2 must not be clear (i.e., has a block on top) at some state.
3. If red_block_2 is not clear in a state, then in an earlier state, the arm was holding white_block_1 and black_block_1 was on the table.
4. At some state, yellow_block_1 is on red_block_1 and orange_block_1 is clear.
5. At some state, grey_block_1 is clear.
6. At some state, orange_block_1 is not on the table (so it's on another block) and is clear.

So the plan needs to satisfy all these while ending with holding red_block_2. Let's start by considering the constraints and how they can be met.

Starting with constraint 6: orange_block_1 is not on the table and is clear. Since initially orange_block_1 is on the table with black_block_1 on top, we need to move orange_block_1 somewhere else. But how? The arm can only pick up blocks that are clear. So orange_block_1 is under black_block_1. To move orange_block_1, we need to first unstack black_block_1, then grey_block_1, then yellow_block_1. Then, perhaps, we can move orange_block_1 onto another block. But orange_block_1 is clear once black_block_1 is removed. Wait, the initial state says that black_block_1 is on orange_block_1, and grey_block_1 is on black_block_1, yellow on grey. So to get orange_block_1 clear, we need to remove black_block_1. But black_block_1 has grey and yellow on top. So we need to unstack yellow, then grey, then black. Then black can be moved, making orange_block_1 clear. But constraint 6 says orange_block_1 is not on the table. So we need to move orange_block_1 onto another block. But to pick up orange_block_1, it has to be clear and on the table. Wait, but initially, orange_block_1 is on the table with black_block_1 on it. If we unstack black_block_1 from orange_block_1, then orange_block_1 becomes clear. But then to move orange_block_1, since it's on the table, we can pick it up. But if we do that, then after putting it somewhere else, it's not on the table. So maybe after unstacking black_block_1 (after dealing with the stack above it), we can pick up orange_block_1 and put it on another block. But that would require that block to be clear. However, we need to satisfy constraint 6: orange_block_1 is not on table and clear. Wait, but if orange_block_1 is on another block and there's nothing on top, then it's clear. So maybe we can stack orange_block_1 onto, say, red_block_1, but red_block_1 has white_block_1 on it. So first, we need to clear red_block_1. Let's think.

Another constraint is constraint 4: yellow_block_1 on red_block_1 and orange_block_1 clear. So we need to move yellow_block_1 to red_block_1. But yellow is currently on grey_block_1, which is on black_block_1, which is on orange_block_1. So to get yellow, we need to unstack yellow, then grey, then black. Then maybe stack yellow on red_block_1. But red_block_1 has white_block_1 on it. So first, we need to move white_block_1. Let's see.

Also, constraint 5 requires grey_block_1 to be clear at some point. Grey_block_1 is initially under yellow_block_1. So if we unstack yellow from grey, then grey becomes clear. That would satisfy constraint 5.

Constraint 3: If red_block_2 is not clear (i.e., something is on it), then earlier the arm was holding white_block_1 and black_block_1 was on the table. So we need to have a step where red_block_2 has a block on top, and before that, there was a state where the arm held white_block_1 and black_block_1 was on the table.

Constraint 1: Must hold black_block_1. So we need to pick up black_block_1 at some point.

Putting this all together:

Let me outline possible steps:

1. To get yellow on red_block_1 (constraint 4), we need to unstack yellow from grey. But first, we need to clear yellow. Since yellow is clear initially, we can unstack yellow_block_1 from grey_block_1. But to do that, the arm must be empty. So:

Action: unstack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1

This gives us holding yellow. Then we can stack it on red_block_1. But red_block_1 has white_block_1 on it. So we need to first move white_block_1. Let's unstack white_block_1 from red_block_1. But white_block_1 is clear. So:

Action: unstack white_block_1 red_block_1

Now holding white. Then stack white somewhere else. Maybe on the table (putdown). But that would make red_block_1 clear. Then stack yellow on red_block_1. Then we have yellow on red_block_1. But after stacking, yellow is clear. Then, we need to make sure that orange_block_1 is clear. So after moving yellow, the stack on orange_block_1 would have black, grey. But if we have already unstacked yellow and grey (since after unstacking yellow, grey is clear). Wait, after unstacking yellow, grey becomes clear. Then we can unstack grey from black. Then unstack black from orange. Then orange is clear and on the table. Then if we move orange to another block, we can satisfy constraint 6.

But let's step through this:

Original stack: orange -> black -> grey -> yellow (all on orange_block_1). Yellow is clear.

First, unstack yellow from grey. Now holding yellow. Then putdown yellow? Or stack it on red_block_1. But red_block_1 has white on it. So first, unstack white from red_block_1. Let's see:

Action plan so far:

1. unstack white_block_1 red_block_1 (now holding white)
2. putdown white_block_1 (now white is on table, clear)
3. unstack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1 (holding yellow)
4. stack yellow_block_1 red_block_1 (now yellow is on red_block_1, which satisfies part of constraint 4. Now, red_block_1 has yellow, which is clear. Then, we need orange_block_1 to be clear. At this point, the stack on orange_block_1 is orange -> black -> grey. Grey is clear (since we unstacked yellow). So to get orange_block_1 clear, we need to remove black. But black has grey on it. So unstack grey from black. Then unstack black from orange. Then orange is clear. But constraint 6 requires orange not on table and clear. So after unstacking black from orange, orange is on table. So we need to move orange off the table. So after unstacking black, we can pick up orange (since it's clear and on table) and stack it somewhere. Let's see:

Continuing:

5. unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1 (holding grey)
6. putdown grey_block_1 (now grey is on table)
7. unstack black_block_1 orange_block_1 (holding black)
8. putdown black_block_1 (now black is on table) → Now, constraint 1 (holding black_block_1) is satisfied here (step 7). But step 7 is unstacking, so we are holding black. So that satisfies constraint 1.

Now, orange_block_1 is on table and clear. But constraint 6 requires orange_block_1 not on table and clear. So we need to move orange_block_1. So:

9. pickup orange_block_1 (since it's on table and clear)
10. stack orange_block_1 some_block. Which block? Let's stack it on red_block_2. Because we need to have a block on top of red_block_2 (constraint 2). Wait, but red_block_2 is initially clear, and our goal is to hold it. So maybe stacking something on red_block_2 would require us to then unstack it later. Hmm. Let's see.

Alternatively, stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1 (which is on the table). But then orange is on black, which is on table. But then orange is not on table, and if it's clear, that satisfies constraint 6. So:

10. stack orange_block_1 black_block_1 → Now, orange is on black, which is on table. Orange is clear. So constraint 6 is satisfied here (orange not on table and clear).

Now, constraint 4: yellow on red_block_1 and orange clear. Wait, after step 10, orange is on black and clear. So that's not on the table. So that satisfies the orange part of constraint 4. But the yellow part is already done (yellow is on red_block_1 from step 4). So constraint 4 is satisfied in the state after step 4 and after step 10.

Now, constraint 2: red_block_2 must have a block on top. But red_block_2 is still clear. So we need to put something on red_block_2. Let's say we stack white_block_1 on red_block_2. But white is on the table. So:

11. pickup white_block_1 (clear, on table)
12. stack white_block_1 red_block_2 → Now red_block_2 has white on top, so not clear. This satisfies constraint 2. But according to constraint 3, whenever red_block_2 is not clear, there must be an earlier state where the arm was holding white_block_1 and black_block_1 was on table. Let's check: in this case, step 11-12: we pick up white and stack on red_block_2. The earlier state where the arm held white was step 1 (unstacked white, held it, then put it down in step 2). But during step 1, black_block_1 was on orange_block_1, not on the table. So that doesn't satisfy the condition. So we need to have a state where the arm is holding white and black is on the table. 

Wait, when is black on the table? After step 8, black is put on the table. So after step 8, black is on table. Then, if we pick up white again (after step 8) and hold it while black is on table, that would satisfy the condition. So perhaps after step 8, we need to pick up white again. Let's adjust the plan.

Let's backtrack. After step 8, black is on table. So:

9. pickup white_block_1 (from table, clear)
10. (now holding white, black is on table) → this satisfies the condition for constraint 3. Then we need to put white somewhere. Maybe stack it on red_block_2. Then, after stacking, red_block_2 has white on top (satisfies constraint 2), and the earlier state (step 9) has holding white and black on table. So that would satisfy constraint 3.

So let's revise the steps:

After step 8 (black is on table):

9. pickup white_block_1 → now holding white, black is on table. This meets the condition for constraint 3.

10. stack white_block_1 red_block_2 → now red_block_2 has white, not clear. So constraint 2 is satisfied here. Also, constraint 3 is satisfied because step 9 is the earlier state where the arm held white and black was on table.

Then proceed to handle orange_block_1:

11. pickup orange_block_1 (now clear and on table)
12. stack orange_block_1 black_block_1 → now orange is not on table and clear. So constraint 6 is satisfied here.

Now, we have to also satisfy constraint 4: yellow on red_block_1 and orange clear. Let's check:

After step 4, yellow is on red_block_1. After step 12, orange is on black and clear. So the state after step 12 has yellow on red_block_1 and orange clear. So constraint 4 is satisfied here.

Constraint 5: grey_block_1 must be clear at some point. After step 6, we putdown grey_block_1, making it on table and clear. So that satisfies constraint 5.

Now, the final goal is to hold red_block_2. Currently, red_block_2 has white_block_1 on top. So we need to unstack white from red_block_2. But to do that, the arm must be empty. Let's see where we are after step 12. The arm is empty after stacking orange_block_1. Then, we need to unstack white_block_1 from red_block_2. But white is on red_block_2. So:

13. unstack white_block_1 red_block_2 → now holding white.
14. putdown white_block_1 → back to table.
15. pickup red_block_2 → now holding red_block_2, which is the goal.

But wait, after step 12, the next steps would be:

13. unstack white_block_1 red_block_2 (preconditions: white is on red_block_2, white is clear, arm is empty. Yes, after step 12, arm is empty. White is on red_block_2 and clear. So unstack is possible.

14. putdown white_block_1 → now white is on table.

15. pickup red_block_2 → since red_block_2 is on table and clear (after step 14), so pickup is possible. Now holding red_block_2. Goal achieved.

So the full plan would be:

1. unstack white_block_1 red_block_1
2. putdown white_block_1
3. unstack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1
4. stack yellow_block_1 red_block_1
5. unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1
6. putdown grey_block_1
7. unstack black_block_1 orange_block_1
8. putdown black_block_1
9. pickup white_block_1
10. stack white_block_1 red_block_2
11. pickup orange_block_1
12. stack orange_block_1 black_block_1
13. unstack white_block_1 red_block_2
14. putdown white_block_1
15. pickup red_block_2

But wait, let's check if all constraints are met:

- Constraint 1: holding black_block_1. That happens in step 7 (unstack black_block_1 from orange_block_1). So yes.

- Constraint 2: red_block_2 has white on top (step 10). Yes.

- Constraint 3: When red_block_2 is not clear (step 10 onwards), there must be an earlier state where holding white and black on table. In step 9, we pick up white, and black was put down in step 8. So step 9 is the earlier state. Correct.

- Constraint 4: yellow on red_block_1 (step 4) and orange clear (after step 12, orange is on black and clear). So after step 12, both conditions are true. But wait, in step 4, yellow is on red_block_1, but orange_block_1 is still under black_block_1 until step 7. So maybe after step 12, both conditions hold: yellow is on red_block_1 (from step 4) and orange is on black (not on table) and clear (from step 12). So yes, that state satisfies constraint 4.

- Constraint 5: grey_block_1 is clear. After step 6, grey is put down on table, so clear. Yes.

- Constraint 6: orange_block_1 is not on table and clear. After step 12, orange is stacked on black (which is on table), so not on table, and since it's the top of the stack (black is under orange), orange is clear. Yes.

All constraints are met. Now, check if the plan is optimal. The steps are 15 actions. Let's see if we can shorten it.

Wait, maybe after stacking white on red_block_2 (step 10), then to get red_block_2, we have to unstack white and put it down, then pick up red. But maybe there's a way to avoid some steps. For example, instead of putting white down and then picking up red, perhaps we can directly pick up red after unstacking white. But in step 13, after unstacking white, we are holding it, so we have to put it down first. So steps 13-15 are necessary.

Alternatively, can we avoid moving white twice? Let's see. The first time we move white is to clear red_block_1 for yellow. Then we put it down. Then later we pick it up again to stack on red_block_2. Then unstack again. But maybe there's a better way.

Alternative approach: After unstacking white from red_block_1 (step 1), instead of putting it down, can we stack it directly on red_block_2? But red_block_2 is clear. So:

1. unstack white_block_1 red_block_1
2. stack white_block_1 red_block_2 → Now red_block_2 has white, which satisfies constraint 2. Then, proceed to handle other constraints.

But then, constraint 3 requires that when red_block_2 is not clear (after step 2), there's an earlier state where arm held white and black was on table. But in this case, when we stack white on red_block_2 (step 2), the earlier state is step 1 (holding white), but black was not on the table yet. So that doesn't satisfy constraint 3. Therefore, we need to stack white on red_block_2 only after black is on the table. Hence, the initial plan's approach is necessary.

So the initial plan is necessary, and it's 15 steps. Let's check for any redundancies.

Wait, after step 7 (unstack black_block_1), we put it down in step 8. Then in step 9, we pick up white again. Could we instead, after step 7, stack black somewhere else instead of putting it down, thus saving steps? For example:

7. unstack black_block_1 orange_block_1 → holding black.
8. stack black_block_1 some_block. But where? If we stack black on red_block_2, then that would put something on red_block_2, but then we need to satisfy constraint 3. But stacking black on red_block_2 would require that block to be clear. red_block_2 is clear. So:

8. stack black_block_1 red_block_2 → Now red_block_2 has black on top. Then, to satisfy constraint 3: when red_block_2 is not clear (now), we need to have an earlier state where the arm held white and black on table. But in this case, the arm is holding black (step 7) and stacking it. So the earlier state (step 7) does not involve holding white. So this approach would not satisfy constraint 3. Hence, this is not valid.

Alternatively, after step 7, put black on table (step 8 as before). Then proceed to pick up white (step 9). So the initial plan is necessary.

Another possibility: after stacking yellow on red_block_1 (step 4), can we use grey_block_1 for something else? But I think the steps are necessary.

Alternatively, can we avoid putting grey down and then not using it? But constraint 5 requires grey to be clear, which is achieved by putting it down (step 6). So that step is necessary.

Thus, the initial plan seems to be the optimal one, with 15 steps. But let's recount the steps:

1. unstack white_block_1 red_block_1
2. putdown white_block_1
3. unstack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1
4. stack yellow_block_1 red_block_1
5. unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1
6. putdown grey_block_1
7. unstack black_block_1 orange_block_1
8. putdown black_block_1
9. pickup white_block_1
10. stack white_block_1 red_block_2
11. pickup orange_block_1
12. stack orange_block_1 black_block_1
13. unstack white_block_1 red_block_2
14. putdown white_block_1
15. pickup red_block_2

Yes, 15 actions. But is there a shorter path? Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps after step 10 (stack white on red_block_2), instead of unstacking it, we can directly pick up red_block_2. But red_block_2 has white on top. So we can't pick it up unless we unstack white first. So steps 13-15 are necessary.

Alternatively, after step 12 (orange stacked on black), maybe there's a way to move black again. But I don't think so. Let's confirm.

Another angle: The final goal is to hold red_block_2. The minimal steps would be to pick it up directly. But since it's on the table and clear, the action would be 'pickup red_block_2'. But the constraints require other steps. So the constraints force additional actions.

Hence, the plan provided is necessary. Now, let's check each action's preconditions.

Check step 1: unstack white_block_1 from red_block_1. Preconditions: white is on red, white is clear (yes, initial state has white clear), arm is empty (yes). So valid.

Step 2: putdown white. Precondition: holding white. Yes.

Step3: unstack yellow from grey. Yellow is on grey, yellow is clear, arm empty. Yes.

Step4: stack yellow on red_block_1. Pre: holding yellow, red_block_1 is clear. After step 2, red_block_1 is clear (since white was removed). So yes.

Step5: unstack grey from black. Grey is on black. After step3, grey is on black and clear (since yellow was unstacked). Arm is empty (after step4, stack yellow, so arm is empty). Yes.

Step6: putdown grey. Pre: holding grey. Yes.

Step7: unstack black from orange. Black is on orange, black is clear (after step5, grey was unstacked, so black is clear). Arm is empty. Yes.

Step8: putdown black. Pre: holding black. Yes.

Step9: pickup white. Pre: white is on table, clear (from step2), arm empty. Yes.

Step10: stack white on red_block_2. Pre: holding white, red_block_2 is clear. After step9, red_block_2 is clear. Yes.

Step11: pickup orange. Pre: orange is on table and clear. After step7, black was removed from orange, so orange is on table and clear. Yes.

Step12: stack orange on black. Pre: holding orange, black is clear (from step8, black is on table, and nothing on it after step8). Wait, after step8, black is on table. So black is clear. Yes. So stack possible.

Step13: unstack white from red_block_2. Pre: white is on red_block_2, white is clear (yes, after step10, white is on top), arm empty (after step12, stack orange, so arm is empty). Yes.

Step14: putdown white. Pre: holding white. Yes.

Step15: pickup red_block_2. Pre: red is on table, clear (after step14, white was put down, so red_block_2 is clear). Yes.

All steps are valid. All constraints are met. The plan is optimal as per the required steps. I don't see a way to shorten it further.
