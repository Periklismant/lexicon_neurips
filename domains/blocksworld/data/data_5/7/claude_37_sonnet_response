Let me understand the problem:

1. We're in a blocksworld setting with 7 blocks: red_block_1, orange_block_1, red_block_2, black_block_1, white_block_1, grey_block_1, and yellow_block_1.

2. The initial state is:
   - red_block_1 is on the table
   - orange_block_1 is on the table
   - red_block_2 is on the table
   - black_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
   - white_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
   - grey_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
   - yellow_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
   - red_block_2 is clear
   - white_block_1 is clear
   - yellow_block_1 is clear
   - you are not holding any block

3. The goal is to "you are holding red_block_2".

4. The constraints are:
   - At some point, you must be holding black_block_1.
   - At some point, there must be a block on top of red_block_2 (i.e., red_block_2 is not clear).
   - If red_block_2 is not clear at some point, then earlier you must have been holding white_block_1 and black_block_1 must have been on the table.
   - At some point, yellow_block_1 must be on top of red_block_1 and orange_block_1 must be clear.
   - At some point, grey_block_1 must be clear.
   - At some point, orange_block_1 must not be on the table and must be clear.

Let's visualize the initial state:

```
   yellow_block_1
         |
   grey_block_1        white_block_1
         |                  |
   black_block_1      red_block_1      red_block_2
         |
   orange_block_1
   
   Table
```

and the goal state is simply to hold red_block_2. 

Let's think through a plan that satisfies all the constraints. We need to:

1. At some point, hold black_block_1. This means we need to first clear it by removing yellow_block_1 and grey_block_1.
2. At some point, have a block on red_block_2. Before doing that, we also need to satisfy the constraint that we're holding white_block_1 and black_block_1 is on the table.
3. At some point, have yellow_block_1 on top of red_block_1 and orange_block_1 clear.
4. At some point, have grey_block_1 clear.
5. At some point, have orange_block_1 not on the table and clear.

Let's start by clearing the towers:

1. `unstack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1` - Now we're holding yellow_block_1, and grey_block_1 is clear. This satisfies constraint 4.
2. `putdown yellow_block_1` - Now we're not holding anything, yellow_block_1 is on the table, and grey_block_1 is still clear.
3. `unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1` - Now we're holding grey_block_1, and black_block_1 is clear.
4. `putdown grey_block_1` - Now we're not holding anything, grey_block_1 is on the table, and black_block_1 is still clear.
5. `unstack black_block_1 orange_block_1` - Now we're holding black_block_1 (satisfying constraint 1), and orange_block_1 is clear.

Now, we need to satisfy constraint 2, which is to have a block on top of red_block_2. But we should first satisfy the condition for constraint 2, which is to be holding white_block_1 and have black_block_1 on the table.

6. `putdown black_block_1` - Now black_block_1 is on the table, and we're not holding anything.
7. `unstack white_block_1 red_block_1` - Now we're holding white_block_1, and black_block_1 is on the table. This satisfies the condition for constraint 2.

Now we can satisfy constraint 2 by placing white_block_1 on red_block_2:

8. `stack white_block_1 red_block_2` - Now white_block_1 is on red_block_2, red_block_2 is not clear, and we're not holding anything. This satisfies constraint 2.

Next, let's satisfy constraint 3, which is to have yellow_block_1 on top of red_block_1 and orange_block_1 clear.

9. `pickup yellow_block_1` - Now we're holding yellow_block_1, and orange_block_1 is still clear.
10. `stack yellow_block_1 red_block_1` - Now yellow_block_1 is on red_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear, and we're not holding anything. This satisfies constraint 3.

Now, let's satisfy constraint 5, which is to have orange_block_1 not on the table and clear.

11. `pickup orange_block_1` - Now we're holding orange_block_1, and it's not on the table.
12. `stack orange_block_1 grey_block_1` - Now orange_block_1 is on grey_block_1, it's not on the table, it's clear, and we're not holding anything. This satisfies constraint 5.

Now, let's achieve the goal by picking up red_block_2. But first, we need to remove white_block_1 from it.

13. `unstack white_block_1 red_block_2` - Now we're holding white_block_1, and red_block_2 is clear.
14. `putdown white_block_1` - Now white_block_1 is on the table, and we're not holding anything.
15. `pickup red_block_2` - Now we're holding red_block_2, and the goal is achieved.

Let's verify that our plan satisfies all constraints:

1. "you are holding black_block_1" - Satisfied in step 5.
2. "there is a block on top of red_block_2, i.e., red_block_2 is not clear" - Satisfied in step 8.
3. If red_block_2 is not clear, then earlier we must have been holding white_block_1 and black_block_1 must have been on the table - Satisfied by having steps 6 and 7 before step 8.
4. "yellow_block_1 is on top of red_block_1" and "orange_block_1 is clear" - Satisfied in step 10.
5. "grey_block_1 is clear" - Satisfied in step 2.
6. "orange_block_1 is not on the table" and "orange_block_1 is clear" - Satisfied in step 12.

So our final plan is:

1. `unstack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1`
2. `putdown yellow_block_1`
3. `unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1`
4. `putdown grey_block_1`
5. `unstack black_block_1 orange_block_1`
6. `putdown black_block_1`
7. `unstack white_block_1 red_block_1`
8. `stack white_block_1 red_block_2`
9. `pickup yellow_block_1`
10. `stack yellow_block_1 red_block_1`
11. `pickup orange_block_1`
12. `stack orange_block_1 grey_block_1`
13. `unstack white_block_1 red_block_2`
14. `putdown white_block_1`
15. `pickup red_block_2`

But wait, I think we can optimize this plan by reordering some steps to make it shorter. Let's try to revise our plan.

I'm going to redo my plan from the beginning:

1. `unstack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1` - Now we're holding yellow_block_1, and grey_block_1 is clear. This satisfies constraint 4.
2. `putdown yellow_block_1` - Now we're not holding anything, yellow_block_1 is on the table, and grey_block_1 is still clear.
3. `unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1` - Now we're holding grey_block_1, and black_block_1 is clear.
4. `putdown grey_block_1` - Now we're not holding anything, grey_block_1 is on the table, and black_block_1 is still clear.
5. `unstack black_block_1 orange_block_1` - Now we're holding black_block_1 (satisfying constraint 1), and orange_block_1 is clear.
6. `putdown black_block_1` - Now black_block_1 is on the table, we're not holding anything, and orange_block_1 is still clear.
7. `unstack white_block_1 red_block_1` - Now we're holding white_block_1, and black_block_1 is on the table.
8. `stack white_block_1 red_block_2` - Now white_block_1 is on red_block_2, red_block_2 is not clear, and we're not holding anything. This satisfies constraint 2, and constraint 3 (the condition) is also satisfied as we were just holding white_block_1 and black_block_1 is on the table.
9. `pickup yellow_block_1` - Now we're holding yellow_block_1, and orange_block_1 is still clear.
10. `stack yellow_block_1 red_block_1` - Now yellow_block_1 is on red_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear, and we're not holding anything. This satisfies constraint 3.
11. `pickup orange_block_1` - Now we're holding orange_block_1, and it's not on the table.
12. `stack orange_block_1 grey_block_1` - Now orange_block_1 is on grey_block_1, it's not on the table, it's clear, and we're not holding anything. This satisfies constraint 5.
13. `unstack white_block_1 red_block_2` - Now we're holding white_block_1, and red_block_2 is clear.
14. `putdown white_block_1` - Now white_block_1 is on the table, and we're not holding anything.
15. `pickup red_block_2` - Now we're holding red_block_2, and the goal is achieved.

This plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal. It's also optimal in the sense that it doesn't waste steps.

Actually, I notice that constraint 3 says "If red_block_2 is not clear, then there must be an earlier state in which you are holding white_block_1 and black_block_1 is on the table." It doesn't say that black_block_1 must be on the table specifically when you're holding white_block_1, but it works out that way in my plan.

Let me double-check that all constraints are satisfied:

Constraint 1: "you are holding black_block_1" - Satisfied in step 5.
Constraint 2: "red_block_2 is not clear" - Satisfied in step 8.
Constraint 3: "If red_block_2 is not clear, then earlier you are holding white_block_1 and black_block_1 is on the table" - Both conditions are true in step 7, before red_block_2 becomes not clear in step 8.
Constraint 4: "yellow_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 and orange_block_1 is clear" - Both conditions are true in step 10.
Constraint 5: "grey_block_1 is clear" - Satisfied in step 2.
Constraint 6: "orange_block_1 is not on the table and orange_block_1 is clear" - Both conditions are true in step 11-12.

OK, I'm satisfied this plan works. 

Actually, let me clarify the statement of Constraint 3, because the causal relationship is important and I should make sure I understand it properly. The constraint says "If expression 'there is a block on top of red_block_2, i.e., red_block_2 is not clear' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'The following conditions are all true: "you are holding white_block_1", "black_block_1 is on the table"'"

So the constraint is saying that if red_block_2 is ever not clear, then at some point before that, you must have been holding white_block_1 while black_block_1 was on the table.

In our plan, red_block_2 becomes not clear in step 8, and just before that, in step 7, we are holding white_block_1 and black_block_1 is on the table. So the constraint is satisfied.

Great, I think the plan is solid:

1. `unstack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1`
2. `putdown yellow_block_1`
3. `unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1`
4. `putdown grey_block_1`
5. `unstack black_block_1 orange_block_1`
6. `putdown black_block_1`
7. `unstack white_block_1 red_block_1`
8. `stack white_block_1 red_block_2`
9. `pickup yellow_block_1`
10. `stack yellow_block_1 red_block_1`
11. `pickup orange_block_1`
12. `stack orange_block_1 grey_block_1`
13. `unstack white_block_1 red_block_2`
14. `putdown white_block_1`
15. `pickup red_block_2`

Actually, wait. There's one more issue I need to check. I need to make sure the actions we take are valid given the preconditions.

Looking back at the preconditions, each action can only be performed if its preconditions are met. For example, to "unstack" a block, the block must be clear and you must not be holding any block.

Let's double-check our plan:

1. `unstack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1` - yellow_block_1 is clear, it's on top of grey_block_1, and we're not holding any block.
2. `putdown yellow_block_1` - We're holding yellow_block_1.
3. `unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1` - grey_block_1 is clear, it's on top of black_block_1, and we're not holding any block.
4. `putdown grey_block_1` - We're holding grey_block_1.
5. `unstack black_block_1 orange_block_1` - black_block_1 is clear, it's on top of orange_block_1, and we're not holding any block.
6. `putdown black_block_1` - We're holding black_block_1.
7. `unstack white_block_1 red_block_1` - white_block_1 is clear, it's on top of red_block_1, and we're not holding any block.
8. `stack white_block_1 red_block_2` - We're holding white_block_1, and red_block_2 is clear.
9. `pickup yellow_block_1` - yellow_block_1 is clear, it's on the table, and we're not holding any block.
10. `stack yellow_block_1 red_block_1` - We're holding yellow_block_1, and red_block_1 is clear.
11. `pickup orange_block_1` - orange_block_1 is clear, it's on the table, and we're not holding any block.
12. `stack orange_block_1 grey_block_1` - We're holding orange_block_1, and grey_block_1 is clear.
13. `unstack white_block_1 red_block_2` - white_block_1 is clear, it's on top of red_block_2, and we're not holding any block.
14. `putdown white_block_1` - We're holding white_block_1.
15. `pickup red_block_2` - red_block_2 is clear, it's on the table, and we're not holding any block.

Yep, the plan is logically sound, it satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal.
