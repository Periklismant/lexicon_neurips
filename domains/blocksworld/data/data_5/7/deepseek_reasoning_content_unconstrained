Okay, let's see. The goal is to have the robotic arm holding red_block_2. So I need to figure out the sequence of actions to achieve that. Let's start by looking at the initial state.

In the initial state, red_block_2 is on the table and clear. Since the arm isn't holding anything, maybe the first step is to just pick it up. Wait, the pickup action requires that the block is on the table, clear, and the arm isn't holding anything. All those conditions are met for red_block_2. So can we just do "pickup red_block_2" directly? That would make the arm hold it, which is exactly the goal. So the plan would be just that one action. But wait, are there any constraints or other blocks that might interfere?

Looking at the initial setup again: other blocks are in towers. For example, orange_block_1 has black_block_1, grey_block_1, and yellow_block_1 on top. But red_block_2 is alone on the table and clear. So there's nothing stopping us from picking it up immediately. The preconditions for pickup are all satisfied. So the optimal plan should be a single action. But maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check the preconditions for pickup:

1. The block must be clear (red_block_2 is clear).
2. The block must be on the table (yes).
3. The arm is not holding anything (initial state says so).

All conditions are met. So the action "pickup red_block_2" should achieve the goal in one step. There's no need for any other actions because that directly accomplishes the desired state. The problem doesn't have any hidden constraints mentioned. Therefore, the optimal plan is just that single action.
