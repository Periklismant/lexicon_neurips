Let's start by understanding the problem. I need to come up with an optimal plan that satisfies the constraints.

The initial state is:
- green_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
- black_block_2 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- black_block_1 is clear
- black_block_2 is clear
- brown_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

The goal is to end up with:
- You are holding green_block_1

There are also additional constraints:
1. At some point, the robot must be holding orange_block_1 and black_block_2 is not clear.
2. At some point, black_block_1 is not clear.
3. If black_block_1 is not clear, then earlier, either brown_block_1 is on the table or grey_block_1 is not on the table.
4. black_block_1 must always not be on the table.
5. At some point, grey_block_2 must be on top of green_block_1.
6. If grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1, then it must later be on top of black_block_2.
7. grey_block_2 is never allowed to be on the table.

Let's first determine what we need to do to achieve the goal. In the initial state, grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1, black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2. We need to clear green_block_1 and then pick it up.

To clear green_block_1, we need to:
1. unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_2
2. unstack grey_block_2 from green_block_1

But this would involve putting grey_block_2 on the table, which violates constraint 7. So we need to stack grey_block_2 on another block. 

Looking at constraint 6, if grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1, then at some later point, it must be on top of black_block_2. So we can plan to move grey_block_2 from green_block_1 to black_block_2.

Now, let's look at constraint 1: at some point, we need to be holding orange_block_1 and black_block_2 should not be clear. This means we need to put something on top of black_block_2. 

Constraint 2 requires that at some point, black_block_1 is not clear. This means we need to put something on top of black_block_1. But constraint 3 requires that before this happens, either brown_block_1 is on the table or grey_block_1 is not on the table.

Let's construct a plan step by step:

1. We can't directly unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_2 because we need to satisfy constraint 2. So we need to put something on top of black_block_1 first. But before we do that, we need to satisfy constraint 3 by either putting brown_block_1 on the table or ensuring grey_block_1 is not on the table.

2. In the initial state, brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1, which is on top of grey_block_1. We can unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1 and then put it on the table, satisfying the first part of constraint 3.

3. Then, we can put something on top of black_block_1 to satisfy constraint 2. We can use brown_block_1 for this.

4. Now we can unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_2 and stack it on something else (not the table, due to constraint 4). 

5. Then, we can unstack grey_block_2 from green_block_1 and stack it on black_block_2 to satisfy constraint 6.

6. For constraint 1, we need to be holding orange_block_1 and black_block_2 should not be clear. Since we've just put grey_block_2 on top of black_block_2, black_block_2 is not clear. So, at some point, we need to hold orange_block_1.

7. Finally, we can pick up green_block_1, satisfying the goal.

Now, let's try to formulate a concrete plan:

1. unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack orange_block_1 from grey_block_1
4. stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1 (this makes black_block_1 not clear, satisfying constraint 2, and we've satisfied constraint 3 by having brown_block_1 on the table)
5. unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_1 (now we've satisfied constraint 1 by holding orange_block_1 and having grey_block_2 on top of green_block_1, ensuring that black_block_2 is not clear)
6. putdown orange_block_1
7. unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_2
8. stack black_block_1 on orange_block_1 (to keep it off the table, satisfying constraint 4)
9. unstack grey_block_2 from green_block_1
10. stack grey_block_2 on black_block_2 (satisfying constraint 6)
11. pickup green_block_1 (satisfying the goal)

But wait, this plan has a flaw. In steps 4-6, I'm assuming that black_block_2 is not clear, but that's not the case because in the initial state, black_block_2 is clear. So I need to adjust.

Wait, I think I misunderstood. I need to have a state where I'm holding orange_block_1 AND black_block_2 is not clear, not either of them. 

Let's adjust the plan:

1. unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1
2. stack brown_block_1 on black_block_2 (setting up to satisfy constraint 1 later)
3. unstack orange_block_1 from grey_block_1
4. Hold onto orange_block_1 for now (at this point, I'm holding orange_block_1 and black_block_2 is not clear, satisfying constraint 1)
5. stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1 (this makes black_block_1 not clear, satisfying constraint 2, and we've satisfied constraint 3 by ensuring grey_block_1 is not on the table, since we just removed orange_block_1 from it)

Wait, that's an issue. In step 5, grey_block_1 is still on the table. So I need to ensure that either brown_block_1 is on the table or grey_block_1 is not on the table before making black_block_1 not clear.

Let's adjust again:

1. unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1 (now brown_block_1 is on the table, which will satisfy part of constraint 3)
3. unstack orange_block_1 from grey_block_1
4. stack orange_block_1 on black_block_2 (setting up to satisfy constraint 1 later)
5. pickup grey_block_1 (taking it off the table, preparing to satisfy the other part of constraint 3)
6. putdown grey_block_1 (it's off the table for a moment, and now back on the table)
7. unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_2
8. stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1 (this makes black_block_1 not clear, satisfying constraint 2, and we've satisfied constraint 3 because brown_block_1 is on the table)
9. unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_2
10. stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1 (to keep it off the table, satisfying constraint 4)
11. unstack grey_block_2 from green_block_1
12. stack grey_block_2 on black_block_2 (satisfying constraint 6)
13. pickup green_block_1 (satisfying the goal)

Hmm, wait, I've again violated constraint 1, which states that we need a state where the robot is holding orange_block_1 AND black_block_2 is not clear. 

Let me re-read the constraints:

1. At some point, the robot must be holding orange_block_1 AND black_block_2 is not clear.
2. At some point, black_block_1 is not clear.
3. If black_block_1 is not clear, then earlier, either brown_block_1 is on the table OR grey_block_1 is not on the table.
4. black_block_1 must always not be on the table.
5. At some point, grey_block_2 must be on top of green_block_1. This is already true in the initial state.
6. If grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1, then it must later be on top of black_block_2.
7. grey_block_2 is never allowed to be on the table.

Let's think through this plan more carefully again. In the initial state:
- green_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
- black_block_2 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- black_block_1 is clear
- black_block_2 is clear
- brown_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

One of the challenges is that we need to be holding orange_block_1 at some point while black_block_2 is not clear, but we also need to keep grey_block_2 off the table.

Let's construct a plan step by step:

1. First, we need to prepare for constraint 3. I'll put brown_block_1 on the table:
   - unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1
   - putdown brown_block_1 (now brown_block_1 is on the table)

2. Now, to satisfy constraint 2, I need to make black_block_1 not clear by putting something on top of it. I can use orange_block_1:
   - unstack orange_block_1 from grey_block_1
   - stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1 (now black_block_1 is not clear, and we've satisfied constraint 3 because brown_block_1 is on the table)

3. Now, to satisfy constraint 1, I need to hold orange_block_1 while black_block_2 is not clear. I'll first make black_block_2 not clear by stacking something on it, and then hold orange_block_1:
   - unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_1
   - putdown orange_block_1
   - unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_2
   - stack black_block_1 on black_block_2 (now black_block_2 is not clear)
   - pickup orange_block_1 (at this point, we're holding orange_block_1 and black_block_2 is not clear, which satisfies constraint 1)

4. Now, I need to handle the constraints related to grey_block_2. Grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1 in the initial state, so constraint 5 is already satisfied. But I need to take grey_block_2 off green_block_1 to pick up green_block_1, and I also need to move it to black_block_2 to satisfy constraint 6. However, I can't put grey_block_2 on the table (constraint 7). 
   - stack orange_block_1 on brown_block_1
   - unstack grey_block_2 from green_block_1
   - stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1 (now grey_block_2 is off green_block_1 but not on the table)

5. Now, to ensure constraint 6 is satisfied, I need to move grey_block_2 to black_block_2 at some point. But first, I need to clear black_block_2:
   - unstack black_block_1 from black_block_2 (now black_block_2 is clear)
   - stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1 (keeping black_block_1 off the table to satisfy constraint 4)
   - unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1
   - stack grey_block_2 on black_block_2 (now constraint 6 is satisfied)

6. Finally, I can pick up green_block_1 to achieve the goal:
   - pickup green_block_1 (goal achieved)

Let me verify the constraints:
1. At some point, the robot must be holding orange_block_1 AND black_block_2 is not clear. ✓ This is satisfied in step 3.
2. At some point, black_block_1 is not clear. ✓ This is satisfied in step 2 when we put orange_block_1 on top of it.
3. If black_block_1 is not clear, then earlier, either brown_block_1 is on the table OR grey_block_1 is not on the table. ✓ We've satisfied this by having brown_block_1 on the table in step 1 before making black_block_1 not clear in step 2.
4. black_block_1 must always not be on the table. ✓ We never put black_block_1 on the table throughout the plan.
5. At some point, grey_block_2 must be on top of green_block_1. ✓ This is already true in the initial state.
6. If grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1, then it must later be on top of black_block_2. ✓ We satisfy this in step 5 when we move grey_block_2 to black_block_2.
7. grey_block_2 is never allowed to be on the table. ✓ We never put grey_block_2 on the table throughout the plan.

But there's an issue with this plan. In step 4, I'm assuming we can stack orange_block_1 on brown_block_1 while we're holding orange_block_1. But after we've picked up orange_block_1 in step 3, we can't use it to clear black_block_2 since we're holding it. We need a different approach. 

Actually, we run into larger problem. I needed to move grey_block_2 to satisfy the goal, and I misunderstood constraints 5 and 6 since grey_block_2 starts on top of green_block_1. So we need to make sure that grey_block_2 is on top of black_block_2 at some point.

Let me redevelop the plan:

1. First, we need to prepare for constraint 3. I'll put brown_block_1 on the table:
   - unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1
   - putdown brown_block_1 (now brown_block_1 is on the table)

2. Now, we want to keep constraint 5 satisfied, but we will have to move grey_block_2 off green_block_1 to pick up green_block_1. To avoid putting grey_block_2 on the table (constraint 7), I'll stack it on something else. But given constraint 6, eventually grey_block_2 should be on top of black_block_2. Let's see:
   - unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_2
   - stack black_block_1 on orange_block_1 (this satisfies constraint 2 by making black_block_1 not clear and it satisfies constraint 3 because brown_block_1 is already on the table)
   - unstack grey_block_2 from green_block_1
   - stack grey_block_2 on black_block_2 (this satisfies constraint 6)

3. Now, to satisfy constraint 1, I need to hold orange_block_1 while black_block_2 is not clear:
   - unstack black_block_1 from orange_block_1 (now black_block_1 is clear)
   - putdown black_block_1 (this violates constraint 4, which says black_block_1 should never be on the table. Let's reconsider)

Ah, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's simplify and try a different approach:

1. First, let's free up orange_block_1 and prepare for constraint 3:
   - unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1
   - putdown brown_block_1 (now brown_block_1 is on the table, which satisfies part of constraint 3)

2. Now, to satisfy constraint 1, I need to hold orange_block_1 while black_block_2 is not clear. I'll make black_block_2 not clear by stacking something on it, and then hold orange_block_1:
   - stack brown_block_1 on black_block_2 (now black_block_2 is not clear)
   - unstack orange_block_1 from grey_block_1
   - At this point, I'm holding orange_block_1 and black_block_2 is not clear, which satisfies constraint 1.

3. To satisfy constraint 2, I need to make black_block_1 not clear. I can use orange_block_1 for this:
   - stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1 (now black_block_1 is not clear, and constraint 3 is satisfied because brown_block_1 is on the table)

4. Now, I need to unstack everything to get to green_block_1. But I also need to ensure constraint 6 is satisfied by moving grey_block_2 to black_block_2:
   - unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_1
   - putdown orange_block_1
   - unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_2
   - stack black_block_1 on orange_block_1 (to keep it off the table as per constraint 4)
   - unstack grey_block_2 from green_block_1
   - unstack brown_block_1 from black_block_2 (clearing the way for grey_block_2)
   - stack brown_block_1 on black_block_1 (just to keep it somewhere)
   - stack grey_block_2 on black_block_2 (this satisfies constraint 6)
   - pickup green_block_1 (goal achieved)

Let me verify the constraints:
1. At some point, the robot must be holding orange_block_1 AND black_block_2 is not clear. ✓ This is satisfied in step 2.
2. At some point, black_block_1 is not clear. ✓ This is satisfied in step 3 when we put orange_block_1 on top of it.
3. If black_block_1 is not clear, then earlier, either brown_block_1 is on the table OR grey_block_1 is not on the table. ✓ We've satisfied this by having brown_block_1 on the table in step 1 before making black_block_1 not clear in step 3.
4. black_block_1 must always not be on the table. ✓ We never put black_block_1 on the table throughout the plan.
5. At some point, grey_block_2 must be on top of green_block_1. ✓ This is true in the initial state.
6. If grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1, then it must later be on top of black_block_2. ✓ We satisfy this in step 4 when we move grey_block_2 to black_block_2.
7. grey_block_2 is never allowed to be on the table. ✓ We never put grey_block_2 on the table throughout the plan.

So the plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal. Let's make sure it's a valid plan by checking the preconditions for each action:

1. unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1: Valid because brown_block_1 is clear and on top of orange_block_1 in the initial state, and we're not holding any block.
2. putdown brown_block_1: Valid because we just unstacked brown_block_1, so we're holding it.
3. stack brown_block_1 on black_block_2: Wait, after step 2, we put down brown_block_1. So we need to pick it up again:
   - pickup brown_block_1
   - stack brown_block_1 on black_block_2

4. unstack orange_block_1 from grey_block_1: Valid because orange_block_1 is clear (since brown_block_1 is no longer on it) and we're not holding any block.
5. stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1: Valid because we're holding orange_block_1 and black_block_1 is clear.
6. unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_1: Valid because orange_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear, and we're not holding any block.
7. putdown orange_block_1: Valid because we're holding orange_block_1.
8. unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_2: Valid because black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2, black_block_1 is clear, and we're not holding any block.
9. stack black_block_1 on orange_block_1: Valid because we're holding black_block_1 and orange_block_1 is clear.
10. unstack grey_block_2 from green_block_1: Valid because grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1, grey_block_2 is clear, and we're not holding any block.
11. unstack brown_block_1 from black_block_2: Valid because brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_2, brown_block_1 is clear, and we're not holding any block.
12. stack brown_block_1 on black_block_1: Valid because we're holding brown_block_1 and black_block_1 is clear.
13. stack grey_block_2 on black_block_2: Valid because we're holding grey_block_2 and black_block_2 is clear.
14. pickup green_block_1: Valid because green_block_1 is on the table, green_block_1 is clear, and we're not holding any block.

So, the complete valid plan is:
1. unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. pickup brown_block_1
4. stack brown_block_1 on black_block_2
5. unstack orange_block_1 from grey_block_1
6. stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1
7. unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_1
8. putdown orange_block_1
9. unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_2
10. stack black_block_1 on orange_block_1
11. unstack grey_block_2 from green_block_1
12. unstack brown_block_1 from black_block_2
13. stack brown_block_1 on black_block_1
14. stack grey_block_2 on black_block_2
15. pickup green_block_1

But I think there's an issue with step 13. After step 12, we unstack brown_block_1 from black_block_2. At this point, we're holding brown_block_1. In step 13, we try to stack brown_block_1 on black_block_1. But black_block_1 is not clear because we stacked it on orange_block_1 in step 10. So we can't stack brown_block_1 on black_block_1. 

Let me redo the last part of the plan:

10. stack black_block_1 on orange_block_1
11. unstack grey_block_2 from green_block_1
12. unstack brown_block_1 from black_block_2
13. putdown brown_block_1
14. stack grey_block_2 on black_block_2
15. pickup green_block_1

But this also has a problem. At step 11, after stacking black_block_1 on orange_block_1, we still have grey_block_2 on green_block_1. But grey_block_2 is not clear because black_block_1 was initially on it. So we can't unstack grey_block_2 from green_block_1 at this point.

Let me redo the entire plan from scratch:

In the initial state:
- green_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
- black_block_2 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- black_block_1 is clear
- black_block_2 is clear
- brown_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

1. Start by freeing up orange_block_1 and preparing for constraint 3:
   - unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1
   - putdown brown_block_1 (now brown_block_1 is on the table, which satisfies part of constraint 3)

2. To satisfy constraint 1, I need to hold orange_block_1 while black_block_2 is not clear:
   - pickup brown_block_1
   - stack brown_block_1 on black_block_2 (now black_block_2 is not clear)
   - unstack orange_block_1 from grey_block_1
   At this point, I'm holding orange_block_1 and black_block_2 is not clear, which satisfies constraint 1.

3. To satisfy constraint 2, I need to make black_block_1 not clear. I can use orange_block_1 for this:
   - stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1 (now black_block_1 is not clear, and constraint 3 is satisfied because brown_block_1 is on the table)

4. Now, I need to unstack everything to get to green_block_1. I'll start by freeing up grey_block_2 from green_block_1 and then satisfy constraint 6 by moving grey_block_2 to black_block_2:
   - unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_1
   - putdown orange_block_1
   - unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_2
   - stack black_block_1 on orange_block_1 (to keep it off the table as per constraint 4)
   - unstack grey_block_2 from green_block_1
   - unstack brown_block_1 from black_block_2
   - putdown brown_block_1
   - stack grey_block_2 on black_block_2 (this satisfies constraint 6)
   - pickup green_block_1 (goal achieved)

Let me check the validity of the plan:

1. unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1: Valid because brown_block_1 is clear and on top of orange_block_1 in the initial state, and we're not holding any block.
2. putdown brown_block_1: Valid because we just unstacked brown_block_1, so we're holding it.
3. pickup brown_block_1: Valid because brown_block_1 is on the table, clear, and we're not holding any block.
4. stack brown_block_1 on black_block_2: Valid because we're holding brown_block_1 and black_block_2 is clear.
5. unstack orange_block_1 from grey_block_1: Valid because orange_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear, and we're not holding any block.
6. stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1: Valid because we're holding orange_block_1 and black_block_1 is clear.
7. unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_1: Valid because orange_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear, and we're not holding any block.
8. putdown orange_block_1: Valid because we're holding orange_block_1.
9. unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_2: Valid because black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2, black_block_1 is clear, and we're not holding any block.
10. stack black_block_1 on orange_block_1: Valid because we're holding black_block_1 and orange_block_1 is clear.
11. unstack grey_block_2 from green_block_1: Valid because grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1, grey_block_2 is clear, and we're not holding any block.
12. unstack brown_block_1 from black_block_2: Valid because brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_2, brown_block_1 is clear, and we're not holding any block.
13. putdown brown_block_1: Valid because we're holding brown_block_1.
14. stack grey_block_2 on black_block_2: Valid because we're holding grey_block_2 and black_block_2 is clear.
15. pickup green_block_1: Valid because green_block_1 is on the table, green_block_1 is clear, and we're not holding any block.

Let me verify the constraints again:
1. At some point, the robot must be holding orange_block_1 AND black_block_2 is not clear. ✓ This is satisfied after step 5, when we're holding orange_block_1 and brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_2.
2. At some point, black_block_1 is not clear. ✓ This is satisfied in step 6 when we put orange_block_1 on top of it.
3. If black_block_1 is not clear, then earlier, either brown_block_1 is on the table OR grey_block_1 is not on the table. ✓ We've satisfied this by having brown_block_1 on the table in step 2 before making black_block_1 not clear in step 6.
4. black_block_1 must always not be on the table. ✓ We never put black_block_1 on the table throughout the plan.
5. At some point, grey_block_2 must be on top of green_block_1. ✓ This is true in the initial state.
6. If grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1, then it must later be on top of black_block_2. ✓ We satisfy this in step 14 when we move grey_block_2 to black_block_2.
7. grey_block_2 is never allowed to be on the table. ✓ We never put grey_block_2 on the table throughout the plan.

So, the complete valid plan is:
1. unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. pickup brown_block_1
4. stack brown_block_1 on black_block_2
5. unstack orange_block_1 from grey_block_1
6. stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1
7. unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_1
8. putdown orange_block_1
9. unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_2
10. stack black_block_1 on orange_block_1
11. unstack grey_block_2 from green_block_1
12. unstack brown_block_1 from black_block_2
13. putdown brown_block_1
14. stack grey_block_2 on black_block_2
15. pickup green_block_1

This plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal. Let's double-check to make sure it's an optimal plan by trying to identify any unnecessary steps:

- Steps 1-2: We need to put brown_block_1 on the table to satisfy constraint 3 before making black_block_1 not clear. These steps are necessary.
- Steps 3-4: We need to stack something on black_block_2 to make it not clear for constraint 1. These steps are necessary.
- Step 5: We need to unstack orange_block_1 to satisfy constraint 1. This step is necessary.
- Step 6: We need to make black_block_1 not clear to satisfy constraint 2. This step is necessary.
- Steps 7-8: We need to unstack orange_block_1 to free up black_block_1. These steps are necessary.
- Steps 9-10: We need to unstack black_block_1 and keep it off the table to satisfy constraint 4. These steps are necessary.
- Step 11: We need to unstack grey_block_2 to get to green_block_1. This step is necessary.
- Steps 12-13: We need to unstack brown_block_1 to make black_block_2 clear for grey_block_2. These steps are necessary.
- Step 14: We need to stack grey_block_2 on black_block_2 to satisfy constraint 6. This step is necessary.
- Step 15: We need to pick up green_block_1 to achieve the goal. This step is necessary.

So, it seems like all steps in the plan are necessary. The plan is as follows:

1. unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. pickup brown_block_1
4. stack brown_block_1 on black_block_2
5. unstack orange_block_1 from grey_block_1
6. stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1
7. unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_1
8. putdown orange_block_1
9. unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_2
10. stack black_block_1 on orange_block_1
11. unstack grey_block_2 from green_block_1
12. unstack brown_block_1 from black_block_2
13. putdown brown_block_1
14. stack grey_block_2 on black_block_2
15. pickup green_block_1
