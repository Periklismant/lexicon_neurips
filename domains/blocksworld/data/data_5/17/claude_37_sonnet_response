Let's analyze the planning problem.

We have 7 blocks: green_block_1, black_block_1, black_block_2, yellow_block_1, white_block_1, black_block_3, black_block_4.

The initial state looks like this:
  - green_block_1 is on the table, with yellow_block_1 on top.
  - black_block_1 is on the table and clear.
  - black_block_2 is on the table, with white_block_1, black_block_3, and black_block_4 stacked on top in that order (black_block_4 on top).

Our goal is to have white_block_1 on the table.

We need to consider the constraints:

1. At some point, we need to have green_block_1 on top of white_block_1 and be holding black_block_1.
2. At some point, we need to be holding white_block_1.
3. After we're holding white_block_1, we need to ensure either black_block_1 is not clear or black_block_4 is not clear.
4. At some point, black_block_3 cannot be on top of yellow_block_1 (this seems like it's not a constraint on our initial state, so we'll check if this is true initially).
5. After black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1, we need to ensure either black_block_2 is not on the table or we're holding green_block_1.
6. black_block_3 can never be on the table.
7. At some point, black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1 (again, doesn't seem to be a constraint on the initial state).
8. After black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1, we need to ensure there's a block on top of black_block_2.

First, I'll check if the initial state satisfies constraints 4 and 7.

In the initial state:
- black_block_3 is on top of white_block_1, not on top of yellow_block_1. So constraint 4 is immediately satisfied. This means we need to ensure that either black_block_2 is not on the table or we're holding green_block_1.
- black_block_4 is on top of black_block_3, not on top of yellow_block_1. So constraint 7 is immediately satisfied. This means we need to ensure there's a block on top of black_block_2.

Let's think about the constraint that black_block_3 should never be on the table. This is a strict constraint throughout the plan.

Now, let's think about how to achieve the goal of having white_block_1 on the table. Currently, white_block_1 is on top of black_block_2, with black_block_3 on top of white_block_1, and black_block_4 on top of black_block_3.

To get white_block_1 on the table, I first need to remove everything on top of it. Let's outline a plan step by step:

1. Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3.
2. Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1 (but I can't put black_block_3 on the table due to constraint 6).
3. Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2 (which satisfies constraint 2).
4. Put white_block_1 on the table (achieving the goal).

But we need to satisfy the constraints as well. Let's revise the plan considering the constraints:

1. Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3.
2. Stack black_block_4 on some other block (to keep constraint 3 in mind).
3. Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1 (but I can't put black_block_3 on the table due to constraint 6).
4. Stack black_block_3 somewhere.
5. Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2 (which satisfies constraint 2).
6. Before putting white_block_1 on the table, we need to ensure constraints 1, 3, and 5 are met.

Let's consider the constraints in detail:

For constraint 1, we need green_block_1 to be on top of white_block_1 at some point, while also holding black_block_1. This requires several steps:
- Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
- Pickup green_block_1
- Stack green_block_1 on white_block_1
- Pickup black_block_1 (but this conflicts, since we can't hold two blocks at once)

This indicates that we need to rearrange the plan.

Let's consider constraint 3. After holding white_block_1, either black_block_1 or black_block_4 should not be clear. 

For constraint 5, after black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1 (which is already true in the initial state), either black_block_2 is not on the table or we're holding green_block_1.

For constraint 8, after black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1 (which is also true in the initial state), there should be a block on top of black_block_2.

It seems we need a more intricate plan.

Let's reorganize our approach to make sure all constraints are met.

First, we need to take black_block_4 and black_block_3 off white_block_1. We need to be careful about where to place black_block_3, as it can't be on the table and shouldn't be on top of yellow_block_1.

Then, we need to figure out a way to have green_block_1 on top of white_block_1 while also holding black_block_1. This is a bit tricky, as we can't hold two blocks at once.

Let me revise the plan:

1. Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3.
2. We can stack black_block_4 on black_block_1 to ensure black_block_1 isn't clear after we're holding white_block_1.
3. Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1 (but I can't put black_block_3 on the table due to constraint 6 and I shouldn't put it on yellow_block_1 due to constraint 4).
4. We can stack black_block_3 on black_block_4, which is on black_block_1.
5. At this point, white_block_1 is clear and we can unstack it from black_block_2.
6. But we need to ensure constraint 1 is satisfied before placing white_block_1 on the table. We need to have green_block_1 on top of white_block_1 while also holding black_block_1.

Let's reconsider how to satisfy constraint 1.

After unstacking white_block_1 from black_block_2, we could:
1. Stack white_block_1 somewhere temporarily.
2. Pickup black_block_1.
3. But now we need green_block_1 on top of white_block_1...

Actually, we should first get green_block_1 ready.

Let's revise the plan:

1. Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3.
2. Stack black_block_4 on yellow_block_1 to free up space.
3. Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1.
4. Stack black_block_3 on black_block_4 to free up space.
5. Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2.
6. Stack white_block_1 somewhere temporarily, maybe on black_block_3.
7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.
8. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_2 to satisfy constraint 8 (there should be a block on top of black_block_2 after black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1).
9. Pickup green_block_1.
10. Stack green_block_1 on white_block_1.
11. Pickup black_block_1.
12. This satisfies constraint 1.
13. Putdown black_block_1.
14. Unstack green_block_1 from white_block_1.
15. Stack green_block_1 somewhere, maybe back on the table.
16. Unstack white_block_1 from whatever is under it.
17. Putdown white_block_1.

But there's an issue with this plan. We can't have green_block_1 on top of white_block_1 while also holding black_block_1, because we can't hold two blocks at once and we'd need to have white_block_1 somewhere stable with green_block_1 on top of it.

Let's revise carefully step by step:

1. Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3.
2. Stack black_block_4 on black_block_1 to ensure black_block_1 isn't clear later (for constraint 3).
3. Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1.
4. Stack black_block_3 on yellow_block_1. This is not violating constraint 4 because the constraint is that at some point, black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1, which was true initially. If we put black_block_3 on top of yellow_block_1 now, we've already satisfied the "at least once" part of the constraint.
5. Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2.
6. Now we satisfy constraint 2 (you are holding white_block_1).
7. After this, we need to satisfy constraint 3. Either black_block_1 or black_block_4 should not be clear. We've already ensured this by stacking black_block_4 on black_block_1, making black_block_1 not clear.

So far so good. Now, we need to ensure constraint 5 is met. We need to make sure either black_block_2 is not on the table or we're holding green_block_1. Since black_block_2 is on the table, we should ensure we're holding green_block_1 at some point. Let's continue the plan:

8. Stack white_block_1 on the table. This satisfies our goal.
9. Unstack black_block_3 from yellow_block_1.
10. Stack black_block_3 on black_block_2. This ensures there's a block on top of black_block_2 for constraint 8.
11. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.
12. Putdown yellow_block_1.
13. Pickup green_block_1. This satisfies constraint 5.
14. Stack green_block_1 on white_block_1.
15. Pickup black_block_1 (which is under black_block_4, so we need to unstack black_block_4 first).
16. Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_1.
17. Stack black_block_4 on yellow_block_1.
18. Pickup black_block_1. Now we satisfy constraint 1 (green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and we're holding black_block_1).

Let's take a step back and ensure all our constraints are met.

1. Constraint 1: We need to have green_block_1 on top of white_block_1 while holding black_block_1. This is met in our revised plan.
2. Constraint 2: We need to be holding white_block_1 at some point. This is met in step 5-6.
3. Constraint 3: After holding white_block_1, either black_block_1 or black_block_4 should not be clear. This is met because we've ensured black_block_1 isn't clear by putting black_block_4 on it.
4. Constraint 4: black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1 at some point. This was true in the initial state.
5. Constraint 5: After black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1, either black_block_2 is not on the table or we're holding green_block_1. We're holding green_block_1 in step 13, which is after the initial state (where black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1).
6. Constraint 6: black_block_3 is never on the table. We ensure this by always putting black_block_3 on top of another block.
7. Constraint 7: black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1 at some point. This was true in the initial state.
8. Constraint 8: After black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1, there should be a block on top of black_block_2. We ensure this by putting black_block_3 on top of black_block_2 in step 10.

But wait, I think I've misunderstood some of the constraints. Let's clarify:

7. Constraint 7: At some point, black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1. I think the point is that initially, black_block_4 is on top of black_block_3, which is not on top of yellow_block_1. But the constraint is that at some point, black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1. So, if black_block_4 was never on top of yellow_block_1, this constraint is already satisfied.

8. Constraint 8: After black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1, there should be a block on top of black_block_2. Since the condition was already satisfied in the initial state, we need to ensure there's a block on top of black_block_2. We do this by putting black_block_3 on top of black_block_2.

I think there might be a subtlety in the way these constraints are worded. Let me re-read them:

7. Constraint 7: The condition is ""black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1" must hold in at least one state. If black_block_4 is never on top of yellow_block_1, the condition is satisfied.

8. Constraint 8: After the condition "black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1" is satisfied, we must ensure that there's a block on top of black_block_2. Since the condition was already satisfied in the initial state (black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1), we need to ensure there's a block on top of black_block_2 at some point after the initial state.

With this understanding, let's revise our plan:

1. Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3.
2. Stack black_block_4 on black_block_1 to ensure black_block_1 isn't clear later (for constraint 3).
3. Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1.
4. Stack black_block_3 on yellow_block_1.
5. Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2.
6. Now we satisfy constraint 2 (you are holding white_block_1).
7. Putdown white_block_1 on the table. This satisfies our goal and also satisfies constraint 3 (after holding white_block_1, black_block_1 isn't clear).

Now, for the rest of the constraints:

8. Unstack black_block_3 from yellow_block_1.
9. Stack black_block_3 on black_block_2. This ensures there's a block on top of black_block_2 for constraint 8.
10. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.
11. Putdown yellow_block_1.
12. Pickup green_block_1. This satisfies constraint 5 (after black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1, we're holding green_block_1).
13. Stack green_block_1 on white_block_1.
14. Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_1.
15. Stack black_block_4 on green_block_1. This ensures we can pickup black_block_1.
16. Pickup black_block_1. Now we satisfy constraint 1 (green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and we're holding black_block_1).

Wait, I think I'm still confused about the constraints. Let me step back and think through them more carefully.

1. At some point, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and we're holding black_block_1.
2. At some point, we are holding white_block_1.
3. After we're holding white_block_1, either black_block_1 or black_block_4 is not clear.
4. At some point, black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1. This is already true in the initial state.
5. After black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1, either black_block_2 is not on the table or we're holding green_block_1. Since black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1 in the initial state, this constraint applies from the start. We need to either have black_block_2 not on the table or hold green_block_1 at some point.
6. black_block_3 is never on the table.
7. At some point, black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1. This is already true in the initial state.
8. After black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1, there should be a block on top of black_block_2. Again, this constraint applies from the start. We need to have a block on top of black_block_2 at some point. In the initial state, white_block_1 is on top of black_block_2, so this constraint is already satisfied.

Given these clarifications, our constraints are simpler than I initially thought. Let's revise our plan:

1. Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3.
2. Stack black_block_4 on black_block_1 to ensure black_block_1 isn't clear later (for constraint 3).
3. Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1.
4. Stack black_block_3 on black_block_4 to keep it off the table (for constraint 6).
5. Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2.
6. This satisfies constraint 2 (you are holding white_block_1).
7. Putdown white_block_1 on the table. This satisfies our goal and also satisfies constraint 3 (after holding white_block_1, black_block_1 isn't clear).
8. Unstack black_block_3 from black_block_4.
9. Stack black_block_3 on black_block_2. This gives us another way to satisfy constraint 8.
10. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.
11. Putdown yellow_block_1.
12. Pickup green_block_1. This satisfies constraint 5 (after black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1, we're holding green_block_1).
13. Stack green_block_1 on white_block_1.
14. Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_1.
15. Stack black_block_4 on yellow_block_1.
16. Pickup black_block_1. Now we satisfy constraint 1 (green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and we're holding black_block_1).

This plan should satisfy all our constraints. Let's double-check:

Constraint 1: Satisfied in steps 13-16. We have green_block_1 on top of white_block_1 and we're holding black_block_1.
Constraint 2: Satisfied in steps 5-6. We are holding white_block_1.
Constraint 3: Satisfied after steps 5-7. After holding white_block_1, black_block_1 isn't clear because black_block_4 is on top of it.
Constraint 4: Satisfied in the initial state. black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1.
Constraint 5: Satisfied in steps 12 and beyond. After black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1 (which is true from the initial state), we hold green_block_1.
Constraint 6: Satisfied throughout. black_block_3 is never on the table. It starts on white_block_1, then goes to black_block_4, and finally to black_block_2.
Constraint 7: Satisfied in the initial state. black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1.
Constraint 8: Satisfied in the initial state and after step 9. After black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1 (which is true from the initial state), there is a block on top of black_block_2 (initially white_block_1, and later black_block_3).

I was still a bit unclear on constraints 4, 5, 7, and, 8, so let me read the problem statement once more to make sure:

4. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1""
   Yes, this is satisfied in the initial state and throughout our plan, since black_block_3 is never on top of yellow_block_1.

5. "If expression "black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1" holds in some state s, then expression "At least one of the following conditions is true: "black_block_2 is not on the table", "you are holding green_block_1"" must hold at s or at some state after s"
   This means that once black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1 (which is true from the initial state), we need to ensure that at some point, either black_block_2 is not on the table or we're holding green_block_1. We satisfy this by holding green_block_1 in step 12.

7. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1""
   This is satisfied in the initial state and for much of our plan, since black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1 until step 15. So, it's true from the initial state until step 15.

8. "If expression "black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1" holds in some state s, then expression "there is a block on top of black_block_2, i.e., black_block_2 is not clear" must hold at s or at some state after s"
   This means that once black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1 (which is true from the initial state), we need to ensure that at some point, there's a block on top of black_block_2. This is satisfied in the initial state, where white_block_1 is on top of black_block_2. It's also satisfied later when we put black_block_3 on top of black_block_2.

I see now. Based on this, our plan is indeed satisfying all constraints. Let's summarize it:

1. Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3.
2. Stack black_block_4 on black_block_1 (ensuring black_block_1 isn't clear for constraint 3).
3. Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1.
4. Stack black_block_3 on black_block_4 (keeping it off the table for constraint 6).
5. Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2 (satisfying constraint 2).
6. Putdown white_block_1 on the table (achieving our goal).
7. Unstack black_block_3 from black_block_4.
8. Stack black_block_3 on black_block_2 (providing another way to satisfy constraint 8).
9. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.
10. Putdown yellow_block_1.
11. Pickup green_block_1 (satisfying constraint 5).
12. Stack green_block_1 on white_block_1.
13. Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_1.
14. Stack black_block_4 on yellow_block_1.
15. Pickup black_block_1 (satisfying constraint 1).

This plan satisfies all our constraints, and also achieves our goal of having white_block_1 on the table.

But wait, I realized I might have overlooked a subtle detail. Constraint 3 says "After holding white_block_1, either black_block_1 or black_block_4 is not clear." I had originally ensured that black_block_1 isn't clear by stacking black_block_4 on it. But in step 14, we unstack black_block_4 from black_block_1, making black_block_1 clear before picking it up. This might violate constraint 3.

Let me revise. After holding white_block_1 in step 5, we need to ensure that either black_block_1 or black_block_4 is not clear. We had arranged for black_block_1 to not be clear by stacking black_block_4 on it. But later, in step 14, we unstack black_block_4 from black_block_1. At this point, both black_block_1 and black_block_4 might be clear, violating the constraint.

Let's revise the plan to address this. Since we want to eventually pickup black_block_1, we should ensure black_block_4 is not clear.

Revised Plan:
1. Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3.
2. Stack black_block_4 on black_block_1 (ensuring black_block_1 isn't clear for constraint 3).
3. Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1.
4. Stack black_block_3 on black_block_4 (keeping it off the table for constraint 6 and ensuring black_block_4 isn't clear for constraint 3 (after we unstack black_block_4 from black_block_1)).
5. Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2 (satisfying constraint 2).
6. Putdown white_block_1 on the table (achieving our goal).
7. Unstack black_block_3 from black_block_4.
8. Stack black_block_3 on black_block_2 (providing another way to satisfy constraint 8).
9. Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_1.
10. Stack black_block_4 on yellow_block_1.
11. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.
12. But wait, this doesn't work because yellow_block_1 has black_block_4 on it. Let's revise.

Revised Plan (Again):
1. Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3.
2. Stack black_block_4 on black_block_1 (ensuring black_block_1 isn't clear for constraint 3).
3. Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1.
4. Stack black_block_3 on yellow_block_1 (keeping it off the table for constraint 6).
5. Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2 (satisfying constraint 2).
6. Putdown white_block_1 on the table (achieving our goal).
7. Unstack black_block_3 from yellow_block_1.
8. Stack black_block_3 on black_block_2 (providing another way to satisfy constraint 8).
9. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.
10. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_4 (ensuring black_block_4 isn't clear for constraint 3 (after we unstack black_block_4 from black_block_1)).
11. Pickup green_block_1 (satisfying constraint 5).
12. Stack green_block_1 on white_block_1.
13. Unstack yellow_block_1 from black_block_4.
14. Putdown yellow_block_1.
15. Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_1.
16. Stack black_block_4 on yellow_block_1.
17. Pickup black_block_1 (satisfying constraint 1).

Wait, there's still an issue. If we unstack black_block_4 from black_block_1, both black_block_1 and black_block_4 might be clear, which would violate constraint 3. 

To ensure at least one of them isn't clear after holding white_block_1, we need to make sure there's a block on top of one of them throughout the plan after step 5. Let's reorganize our approach.

Revised Plan (Third Attempt):
1. Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3.
2. Stack black_block_4 on black_block_1 (ensuring black_block_1 isn't clear for constraint 3).
3. Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1.
4. Stack black_block_3 on black_block_4 (keeping it off the table for constraint 6 and ensuring black_block_4 isn't clear for constraint 3).
5. Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2 (satisfying constraint 2).
6. Putdown white_block_1 on the table (achieving our goal).
7. Unstack black_block_3 from black_block_4.
8. Stack black_block_3 on black_block_2 (providing another way to satisfy constraint 8).
9. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.
10. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_4 (ensuring black_block_4 isn't clear for constraint 3).
11. Pickup green_block_1 (satisfying constraint 5).
12. Stack green_block_1 on white_block_1.
13. Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_1. (At this point, black_block_4 still has yellow_block_1 on top, so it's not clear, satisfying constraint 3).
14. Stack black_block_4 on green_block_1.
15. Pickup black_block_1 (satisfying constraint 1).

Let's double-check this plan.

Constraint 1: Satisfied in steps 12-15. We have green_block_1 on top of white_block_1 and we're holding black_block_1.
Constraint 2: Satisfied in steps 5. We are holding white_block_1.
Constraint 3: Satisfied throughout after step 5. After holding white_block_1, either black_block_1 or black_block_4 is always not clear. Initially, both aren't clear. After unstack black_block_3 from black_block_4, we stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_4 to keep it not clear.
Constraint 4: Satisfied in the initial state. black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1.
Constraint 5: Satisfied in step 11 and beyond. After black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1 (which is true from the initial state), we hold green_block_1.
Constraint 6: Satisfied throughout. black_block_3 is never on the table.
Constraint 7: Satisfied in the initial state. black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1.
Constraint 8: Satisfied in the initial state and after step 8. After black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1 (which is true from the initial state), there is a block on top of black_block_2 (initially white_block_1, and later black_block_3).

This plan seems to satisfy all our constraints.

Actually, I had written the wrong constraint earlier. Constraint 3 says "If you are holding white_block_1 in some state s, then the expression "At least one of the following conditions is true: "there is a block on top of black_block_1, i.e., black_block_1 is not clear", "there is a block on top of black_block_4, i.e., black_block_4 is not clear" must hold at s or at some state after s.

This means that after holding white_block_1, at some point, either black_block_1 or black_block_4 should not be clear. It doesn't have to be true for the entire time after holding white_block_1, just at some point.

So, the plan is correct if, at some point after holding white_block_1, either black_block_1 or black_block_4 isn't clear. In our plan, right after holding white_block_1, black_block_1 isn't clear because black_block_4 is on top of it, and black_block_4 isn't clear because black_block_3 is on top of it. So, we've satisfied this constraint.

Let me review once more to ensure the plan is optimal (has the minimal number of steps).

Current Plan:
1. Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3.
2. Stack black_block_4 on black_block_1.
3. Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1.
4. Stack black_block_3 on black_block_4.
5. Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2.
6. Putdown white_block_1 on the table.
7. Unstack black_block_3 from black_block_4.
8. Stack black_block_3 on black_block_2.
9. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.
10. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_4.
11. Pickup green_block_1.
12. Stack green_block_1 on white_block_1.
13. Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_1.
14. Stack black_block_4 on green_block_1.
15. Pickup black_block_1.

There are 15 steps, and I don't see a way to shorten this and still satisfy all the constraints. The goal is achieved in step 6, but we need the additional steps to satisfy the various constraints.

Let's fix the plan then. Let me output the final plan:
unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3
stack black_block_4 on black_block_1
unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1
stack black_block_3 on black_block_4
unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2
putdown white_block_1
unstack black_block_3 from black_block_4
stack black_block_3 on black_block_2
unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_4
pickup green_block_1
stack green_block_1 on white_block_1
unstack black_block_4 from black_block_1
stack black_block_4 on green_block_1
pickup black_block_1
