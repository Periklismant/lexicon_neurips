Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld problem. The initial state has several blocks arranged in specific ways, and the goal is to make sure that brown_block_2 is clear. That means nothing is on top of it. Let me first visualize the initial setup.

So, starting from the initial state:

- red_block_1 is on the table.
- brown_block_1 is on the table and clear.
- brown_block_2 is on top of red_block_1.
- On top of brown_block_2 is blue_block_1, which is clear.
- brown_block_3 is on the table, and on top of it is red_block_2, then red_block_3 is on top of red_block_2. Both red_block_3 and blue_block_1 are clear.

The goal is to have brown_block_2 clear. Right now, blue_block_1 is on brown_block_2. So, the main task is to remove blue_block_1 from brown_block_2.

To do that, I need to move blue_block_1 somewhere else. Since the arm can only hold one block at a time, I have to unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_2. But to unstack, the preconditions are: blue_block_1 is on brown_block_2, blue_block_1 is clear (which it is), and the arm is empty. Since the arm starts empty, maybe the first action is to unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_2.

Wait, let me check the preconditions for unstack. The unstack action requires that the block to be unstacked (blue_block_1) is on top of another block (brown_block_2), that it's clear (which it is), and the arm is empty. So yes, we can perform unstack blue_block_1 brown_block_2. After that, the arm is holding blue_block_1. Then, we need to put it down somewhere. So maybe putdown blue_block_1 on the table. That would make brown_block_2 clear, which is the goal. But wait, is that all?

Wait, after unstacking, brown_block_2 becomes clear. Because when you unstack a block (blue_block_1) from another (brown_block_2), the effect is that brown_block_2 is clear. Wait, let's check the effects of unstack. The effects are: b1 (blue_block_1) is no longer on b2 (brown_block_2), b2 becomes clear, and the arm is holding b1. So yes, after unstacking, brown_block_2 is clear. So the goal is achieved immediately after unstacking. But wait, the problem states the final goal is "there is no block on top of brown_block_2", which is exactly what happens after unstack. So maybe the plan is just unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_2, then put it down. But wait, the goal is only about brown_block_2 being clear. So if we unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_2, the effect is that brown_block_2 is clear. So once that action is done, the goal is achieved. So the plan could be just that one action. But wait, no, because after unstack, the arm is holding blue_block_1. The problem doesn't care where blue_block_1 ends up, as long as brown_block_2 is clear. So technically, after the unstack action, the goal is already satisfied. However, the problem might require that all actions are such that after the plan is executed, the world is in a state where the goal holds. But in the Blocksworld, if you perform an action that achieves the goal, even if other blocks are in the air, the goal is satisfied. Wait, but the problem says "bring about the goal of the problem". The goal is that brown_block_2 is clear. So if after unstack, brown_block_2 is clear, even though blue_block_1 is being held, does that count? Let me check the effects again.

The unstack action's effects: after unstacking, b1 is no longer on b2, so b2 is clear. So yes, the goal is achieved. But the arm is holding blue_block_1. However, the problem's goal doesn't specify anything about the arm's state. The goal is only about the block's positions. So maybe the plan is just the unstack action. But wait, in Blocksworld, the arm can't stay holding a block; the plan should end with the arm not holding anything? Or is that not required? The problem states that the goal is only about the blocks' arrangement. So if the goal is already achieved after unstack, even if the arm is holding a block, is that acceptable? But in the initial state, the arm is not holding anything. However, the problem doesn't specify that the arm must be empty at the end. The goal is only about brown_block_2 being clear.

So the optimal plan would be just one action: unstack blue_block_1 brown_block_2. Because that action makes brown_block_2 clear, which is the goal. But wait, let's confirm the preconditions of unstack. The block to unstack (blue_block_1) must be clear. The initial state says blue_block_1 is clear. Yes. The arm is empty. So yes, unstack is possible. Then, after that action, brown_block_2 is clear, and the arm is holding blue_block_1. The problem doesn't require the arm to put it down. So the shortest possible plan is one action. But perhaps the problem expects that the arm is not holding anything at the end? The original problem statement says nothing about that. The initial state mentions that the arm is not holding anything, but the goal doesn't. So perhaps the optimal plan is just the unstack action. However, in some planning systems, the arm holding a block might not be considered a valid terminal state if the problem doesn't specify. But according to the problem description here, the only requirement is that brown_block_2 is clear. So the plan could be:

unstack blue_block_1 brown_block_2

But maybe the system requires that the arm is not holding any block at the end. Because otherwise, if you have the arm holding a block, it's possible that another action is needed to put it down. However, the problem's goal doesn't mention that. So according to the problem as given, the optimal plan is just that one action. Wait, but let me recheck the problem's initial state and the goal.

Original problem's goal: "there is no block on top of brown_block_2". So as long as that's true, regardless of where blue_block_1 is. So after unstack, blue_block_1 is in the arm, so it's not on any block, so brown_block_2 is clear. So the goal is achieved. So the plan is one step. But maybe the problem expects that blocks must be on the table or on other blocks, not in the arm. But according to the problem's description, the arm can hold a block, and the state is defined by where blocks are. If a block is in the arm, it's not on the table or another block. So the goal is satisfied. Therefore, the optimal plan is just the unstack action.

But I'm a bit unsure. Let me think again. If the arm is holding blue_block_1, then blue_block_1 is not on brown_block_2 anymore, so brown_block_2 is clear. So the goal is achieved. So the plan is indeed just one action. But maybe there's a catch. For example, perhaps after unstacking, the arm must put down the block, but the problem's goal doesn't require it. So the optimal plan is one action. That's the shortest possible. So the answer is:

```
unstack blue_block_1 brown_block_2
```

But wait, maybe the problem expects that all blocks must be placed somewhere. But the goal doesn't state that. Therefore, the optimal plan is just the unstack action. However, perhaps in the problem's constraints, there's an implicit assumption that the arm must be empty at the end. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says: "a valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints". Then, under that, it's empty. So the user might have intended to list constraints but forgot. But in the given problem, there are no additional constraints. So according to the given information, the plan is just the unstack action. Therefore, the optimal plan is that single action.
