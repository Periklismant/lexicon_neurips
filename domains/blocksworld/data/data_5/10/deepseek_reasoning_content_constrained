Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to make brown_block_2 clear. In the initial state, brown_block_2 has blue_block_1 on top of it, so we need to remove that. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy along the way.

First, let's list the initial state:

- red_block_1 is on the table, with brown_block_2 on top of it, and blue_block_1 on top of brown_block_2.
- brown_block_1 is on the table and clear.
- brown_block_3 is on the table, with red_block_2 on top, then red_block_3 on top of red_block_2. So the stack is brown_block_3 -> red_block_2 -> red_block_3. But wait, the initial state says red_block_2 is on brown_block_3, and red_block_3 is on red_block_2. So brown_block_3 is under red_block_2, which is under red_block_3. All three are in a tower.

The goal is to have brown_block_2 clear. So we need to remove blue_block_1 from brown_block_2. That means moving blue_block_1 somewhere else.

But the constraints are tricky. Let's look at each constraint:

1. Must hold blue_block_1 in at least one state. So somewhere in the plan, we have to pick up blue_block_1. That's part of the solution anyway since we need to move it.

2. If holding blue_block_1, there must be an earlier state where brown_block_3 is on top of red_block_3. Wait, in the initial state, brown_block_3 is on the table, with red_block_2 on it, then red_block_3 on red_block_2. So brown_block_3 is under red_block_2. So brown_block_3 is not on top of red_block_3. To make brown_block_3 on top of red_block_3, we need to somehow move brown_block_3 onto red_block_3. But how? Because currently, red_block_3 is on top of red_block_2, which is on brown_block_3. So maybe we need to unstack red_block_3 from red_block_2, then put it somewhere, then move brown_block_3 onto red_block_3. But this seems complicated. But this constraint says that before we hold blue_block_1, we must have had a state where brown_block_3 is on red_block_3. Hmm.

3. At least one state where red_block_2 is not on top of red_block_3. In the initial state, red_block_2 is under red_block_3. So red_block_2 is on top of brown_block_3, and red_block_3 is on top of red_block_2. So initially, red_block_2 is not on top of red_block_3. Wait, no: red_block_3 is on top of red_block_2, so red_block_2 is under red_block_3. So red_block_2 is not on top of red_block_3. Wait, but in the initial state, is red_block_2 on top of red_block_3? No. Because red_block_3 is on top of red_block_2. So in the initial state, red_block_2 is not on top of red_block_3. So this condition is already true in the initial state. But the constraint says that at least one state must have this. So maybe the initial state already satisfies this. But perhaps in the process, if we move red_block_3, then red_block_2 could be placed on red_block_3 later, but the constraint just needs at least one state where it's true. So maybe the initial state already satisfies that. Wait, but the problem says the constraints must hold in the plan. So the plan must include at least one state where red_block_2 is not on top of red_block_3. Since the initial state is part of the plan's states, maybe this constraint is already satisfied. But wait, the plan starts with the initial state. So maybe this constraint is already met. But the problem might require that the plan includes actions that cause this condition, but maybe not. Let me check the exact wording: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: red_block_2 is not on top of red_block_3". The initial state has red_block_2 under red_block_3, so red_block_2 is not on top of red_block_3. So this is true initially. Therefore, this constraint is automatically satisfied. However, the next constraint says that if in some state s, red_block_2 is not on top of red_block_3, then in s or a later state, red_block_2 is clear. Since the initial state has red_block_2 not on top of red_block_3 (because it's under), we must ensure that red_block_2 is clear at some point from the initial state onwards. Wait, but in the initial state, red_block_2 has red_block_3 on top of it. So red_block_2 is not clear. The constraint says that if in state s, red_block_2 is not on top of red_block_3, then in s or later, red_block_2 is clear. So in the initial state, s is the initial state where red_block_2 is not on top of red_block_3 (since it's under). Therefore, the constraint requires that red_block_2 must be clear in the initial state or in some state after. But in the initial state, red_block_2 is not clear (has red_block_3 on top). So we need to make sure that in some state after the initial state, red_block_2 becomes clear. So we need to unstack red_block_3 from red_block_2. That would make red_block_2 clear. So maybe we need to do that. So that's part of the plan.

Next constraint: At least one state where either holding red_block_2 or red_block_1 is not on the table. Initially, red_block_1 is on the table. So to satisfy this, either we pick up red_block_2 at some point, or move red_block_1 off the table. Since moving blue_block_1 from brown_block_2 (which is on red_block_1) might require unstacking brown_block_2, but red_block_1 is on the table. Wait, brown_block_2 is on red_block_1. So to unstack brown_block_2 from red_block_1, we need to pick it up. But brown_block_2 is under blue_block_1. So to get to brown_block_2, we need to first unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_2. So the first step would be to unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_2. But to do that, the preconditions are that blue_block_1 is clear (which it is) and that the arm is empty. Since the arm is initially empty, we can perform unstack blue_block_1 brown_block_2. Then we can put it down or stack it somewhere else. But let's think about the constraints.

Another constraint: At least one state where blue_block_1 is on the table or holding brown_block_3. So maybe putting blue_block_1 on the table would satisfy the first part. But how does that fit into the plan?

Another constraint: At least one state where red_block_3 is on the table or holding red_block_1. Since red_block_3 is initially on red_block_2, to satisfy this, we might need to move red_block_3 to the table or pick up red_block_1. But red_block_1 is under brown_block_2. So to get red_block_1, we need to first remove brown_block_2 and blue_block_1. But our goal is to make brown_block_2 clear, which is achieved by removing blue_block_1. Wait, no: the goal is that brown_block_2 is clear. So once we remove blue_block_1 from brown_block_2, brown_block_2 becomes clear, which is the goal. So maybe the plan is simply to unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_2 and put it down. But then we have to check all constraints.

Wait, but let's outline the steps:

1. Unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_2. This requires that blue_block_1 is clear (which it is) and the arm is empty (which it is). After this, the arm is holding blue_block_1, brown_block_2 is clear (satisfying the goal), and blue_block_1 is no longer on brown_block_2.

But the constraints:

- The first constraint is satisfied because we are holding blue_block_1 in this step.

- The second constraint says that if we hold blue_block_1, there must be a prior state where brown_block_3 is on top of red_block_3. But in the initial state, brown_block_3 is under red_block_2. So we need to create a state where brown_block_3 is on red_block_3. How?

Wait, the second constraint is a conditional: if in any state we are holding blue_block_1, there must be an earlier state where brown_block_3 is on red_block_3. So in our current plan step, after unstacking blue_block_1, we are holding it, so we need to have had a prior state where brown_block_3 was on red_block_3. But initially, that's not the case. So we need to somehow arrange for brown_block_3 to be on red_block_3 before we pick up blue_block_1.

This complicates things. So we can't just unstack blue_block_1 first. We need to first create a state where brown_block_3 is on red_block_3, then hold blue_block_1. So how can we do that?

Let's look at the stack involving brown_block_3, red_block_2, and red_block_3. To get brown_block_3 onto red_block_3, we need to move brown_block_3. But brown_block_3 is on the table with red_block_2 on it, then red_block_3 on red_block_2. So to move brown_block_3, we need to first remove red_block_2 and red_block_3. Let's see:

First, unstack red_block_3 from red_block_2. This requires that red_block_3 is clear (which it is), and the arm is empty. After unstacking, we are holding red_block_3. Then put it down (putdown red_block_3). Now red_block_2 is clear. Then we can unstack red_block_2 from brown_block_3. Then putdown red_block_2. Now brown_block_3 is clear on the table. Then we can pick up brown_block_3 and stack it on red_block_3 (which is on the table). So stack brown_block_3 red_block_3. Now brown_block_3 is on red_block_3. This would satisfy the condition for constraint 2. Then, after that, we can proceed to handle blue_block_1.

But how does this fit into the plan? Let's outline the steps:

1. Unstack red_block_3 from red_block_2. Now holding red_block_3.

2. Putdown red_block_3. Now red_block_3 is on the table, clear.

3. Unstack red_block_2 from brown_block_3. Now holding red_block_2.

4. Putdown red_block_2. Now red_block_2 is on the table.

5. Pickup brown_block_3. Preconditions: brown_block_3 is on table and clear. It is, since we putdown red_block_2 and brown_block_3 was on table, and after step 3, brown_block_3 is clear.

6. Stack brown_block_3 onto red_block_3. Now brown_block_3 is on red_block_3. This satisfies the condition for constraint 2.

Now, after this, we can proceed to unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_2. Because now, when we hold blue_block_1, there was a prior state (step 6) where brown_block_3 was on red_block_3.

So steps 1-6 are necessary to satisfy constraint 2.

Then, proceed to handle blue_block_1:

7. Unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_2. Now holding blue_block_1. This satisfies constraint 1.

8. Putdown blue_block_1. Now blue_block_1 is on the table. This satisfies the constraint that in at least one state, blue_block_1 is on the table or holding brown_block_3. Since blue_block_1 is on the table here, that's satisfied (constraint 5).

Now, the goal is achieved: brown_block_2 is clear (since blue_block_1 is removed).

But wait, what about the other constraints?

Constraint 3 is already satisfied by the initial state (red_block_2 not on top of red_block_3). But after step 1, red_block_2 is on brown_block_3, and red_block_3 is on the table, so red_block_2 is not on top of red_block_3. So that's still true. The constraint requires that in any state where red_block_2 is not on top of red_block_3, then in that state or later, red_block_2 is clear. In the initial state, red_block_2 is not on top of red_block_3 but is not clear (has red_block_3 on top). So we need to make red_block_2 clear at some point. Which happens after step 1: when we unstack red_block_3 from red_block_2, then red_block_2 becomes clear. So in step 3, when we unstack red_block_2 from brown_block_3, we have to check if red_block_2 is clear. Wait, after step 1, red_block_2 is clear (since red_block_3 was removed). So step 3 is unstacking red_block_2 from brown_block_3. Preconditions for unstacking red_block_2 from brown_block_3: red_block_2 is on brown_block_3, red_block_2 is clear (which it is after step 1), and arm is empty (which it is after step 2). So yes. So after step 3, we are holding red_block_2, and brown_block_3 is clear. Then step 4 is putdown red_block_2. So red_block_2 is on the table and clear. So in the state after step 4, red_block_2 is clear, which satisfies the constraint that if red_block_2 is not on top of red_block_3 in any state (which is true from initial state onwards except when maybe stacked again), then in that state or later, red_block_2 is clear. So the earliest state where red_block_2 is not on top of red_block_3 is the initial state, and the constraint requires that in that state or later, red_block_2 is clear. In the initial state, red_block_2 is not clear. But after step 1, red_block_2 becomes clear. So after step 1, the constraint is satisfied because red_block_2 is clear. So from step 1 onwards, whenever red_block_2 is not on top of red_block_3 (which it never is again, since red_block_3 is on the table and red_block_2 is on the table), then red_block_2 is clear. So this constraint is satisfied.

Now, the constraint 4: If red_block_2 is not on top of red_block_3 in state s, then in s or later, red_block_2 is clear. As discussed, after step 1, red_block_2 is clear, so that's okay.

Constraint 5: At least one state where either holding red_block_2 or red_block_1 is not on the table. In step 3, we are holding red_block_2. So that satisfies this constraint.

Constraint 6: At least one state where blue_block_1 is on the table or holding brown_block_3. In step 8, blue_block_1 is on the table. So that's satisfied.

Constraint 7: At least one state where red_block_3 is on the table or holding red_block_1. After step 2, red_block_3 is on the table. So that's satisfied.

So all constraints are satisfied with this plan.

Let me check the steps again:

1. Unstack red_block_3 from red_block_2. Arm holds red_block_3.

2. Putdown red_block_3. Now red_block_3 is on table.

3. Unstack red_block_2 from brown_block_3. Arm holds red_block_2.

4. Putdown red_block_2. Now red_block_2 is on table.

5. Pickup brown_block_3. Arm holds brown_block_3.

6. Stack brown_block_3 on red_block_3. Now brown_block_3 is on red_block_3.

7. Unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_2. Arm holds blue_block_1.

8. Putdown blue_block_1.

But wait, step 7 is unstacking blue_block_1 from brown_block_2. Let's check preconditions for that. At this point, brown_block_2 is under blue_block_1. To unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_2, brown_block_2 must be clear (which it is, since blue_block_1 is the only block on it, and we're removing it). The arm must be empty. After step 6, we stacked brown_block_3, so the arm is empty. So yes, we can do step 7.

After step 7, brown_block_2 is clear, which is the goal. Then putdown blue_block_1.

So the total steps are 8. But is this the shortest possible? Let's see if there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, after stacking brown_block_3 on red_block_3, could we do something else? Let's see.

Wait, the goal is to make brown_block_2 clear. Once we unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_2, the goal is achieved. So the minimal steps would be to unstack blue_block_1 and put it down. But due to the constraints, we need to do the steps involving red_block_3, red_block_2, and brown_block_3.

Alternatively, maybe we can combine some steps. Let's see.

But according to the constraints, we have to make sure that before holding blue_block_1, there was a state where brown_block_3 is on red_block_3. So steps 1-6 are necessary. Then steps 7-8. So total 8 steps. But perhaps there's a shorter path.

Wait, after step 6, brown_block_3 is on red_block_3. Then step 7: unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_2. Then putdown. So that's 8 steps. Is there a way to avoid some steps?

Alternatively, after step 6, instead of putting down blue_block_1, could we stack it somewhere else? But that would require more steps. The minimal steps would be to unstack and putdown.

Another thought: after step 6, brown_block_3 is on red_block_3. Then, perhaps we can use the arm to pick up brown_block_3 again and move it, but that's not necessary for the goal.

Alternatively, let's see:

After step 6, we have brown_block_3 on red_block_3. Then, proceed to unstack blue_block_1. So steps 1-6 are necessary. Then 7-8. So 8 steps. Is there a way to have fewer steps?

Wait, what if after step 6, instead of putting down blue_block_1, we stack it on brown_block_1, but that's not necessary. The minimal steps are to move blue_block_1 off brown_block_2. So yes, unstack and putdown.

So the plan as outlined meets all constraints and is 8 steps. But perhaps there's a shorter way. Let me think again.

Is there a way to create the condition where brown_block_3 is on red_block_3 with fewer steps?

Original stack: brown_block_3 (table) -> red_block_2 -> red_block_3.

To get brown_block_3 on red_block_3:

We need to move red_block_3 to the table (unstack and putdown), then move red_block_2 to the table, then move brown_block_3 onto red_block_3. That's 5 steps (unstack red_block_3, putdown, unstack red_block_2, putdown, pickup brown_block_3, stack on red_block_3). Wait, that's 5 steps. Then unstack blue_block_1 and putdown: 2 more steps. Total 7 steps.

Wait, let's recount:

1. Unstack red_block_3 from red_block_2. (arm holds red_block_3)

2. Putdown red_block_3. (arm empty)

3. Unstack red_block_2 from brown_block_3. (arm holds red_block_2)

4. Putdown red_block_2. (arm empty)

5. Pickup brown_block_3. (arm holds brown_block_3)

6. Stack brown_block_3 on red_block_3. (arm empty)

7. Unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_2. (arm holds blue_block_1)

8. Putdown blue_block_1. (arm empty)

That's 8 steps.

But perhaps after step 6, when we stack brown_block_3 on red_block_3, we can use that block to satisfy another constraint. For example, when we stack brown_block_3 on red_block_3, the brown_block_3 is clear. Then, could we unstack it again? But that's not necessary.

Alternatively, after step 5, when we pick up brown_block_3, instead of stacking on red_block_3, could we stack it somewhere else? No, because we need to have brown_block_3 on red_block_3 to satisfy constraint 2.

Hmm. I think the 8-step plan is necessary given the constraints. Let me check each constraint again:

- Constraint 1: Holding blue_block_1 in step 7. Check.

- Constraint 2: Before step 7, step 6 has brown_block_3 on red_block_3. Check.

- Constraint 3: Initial state has red_block_2 not on red_block_3. Check.

- Constraint 4: In the initial state, red_block_2 is not on red_block_3 but not clear. Then in step 3, after unstacking red_block_3, red_block_2 becomes clear. So after step 1, red_block_2 is clear. So the constraint is satisfied.

- Constraint 5: In step 3, holding red_block_2. Check.

- Constraint 6: Step 8 puts blue_block_1 on table. Check.

- Constraint 7: Step 2 puts red_block_3 on table. Check.

So all constraints are satisfied. Now, is there a shorter plan?

What if after unstacking red_block_3 and putting it down, we unstack red_block_2 and put it down, then stack brown_block_3 on red_block_3. Then unstack blue_block_1 and put it down. That's 7 steps. Wait:

1. Unstack red_block_3 from red_block_2.

2. Putdown red_block_3.

3. Unstack red_block_2 from brown_block_3.

4. Putdown red_block_2.

5. Pickup brown_block_3.

6. Stack brown_block_3 on red_block_3.

7. Unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_2.

8. Putdown blue_block_1.

No, that's still 8 steps. Unless there's a way to avoid one of the putdowns.

Alternatively, after unstacking red_block_3 (step 1), can we stack it somewhere else instead of putting it down? For example, stack red_block_3 on brown_block_1. But that would require brown_block_1 to be clear, which it is. Then step 2 would be stack red_block_3 brown_block_1. Then step 3, unstack red_block_2 from brown_block_3. Then putdown. Then pickup brown_block_3, stack on red_block_3. But this may not save steps. Also, red_block_3 would then be on brown_block_1, but it's not necessary.

Alternatively, after step 1 (unstack red_block_3), can we directly stack it on brown_block_3? But brown_block_3 is under red_block_2. So red_block_2 is on brown_block_3. So we can't stack red_block_3 on brown_block_3 until red_block_2 is moved. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, after step 3, when holding red_block_2, instead of putting it down, stack it somewhere else. But that's extra steps. Not helpful.

So I think the minimal plan is 8 steps. Let's confirm each action's preconditions:

1. Unstack red_block_3 from red_block_2: red_block_3 is on red_block_2, clear, arm empty. Yes.

2. Putdown red_block_3: holding red_block_3. Yes.

3. Unstack red_block_2 from brown_block_3: red_block_2 is on brown_block_3, clear (after step 1), arm empty (after putdown). Yes.

4. Putdown red_block_2: holding red_block_2. Yes.

5. Pickup brown_block_3: on table, clear (after step 3 unstacked red_block_2 from brown_block_3). Yes.

6. Stack brown_block_3 on red_block_3: holding brown_block_3, red_block_3 is clear (after step 2 putdown). Yes.

7. Unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_2: blue_block_1 is on brown_block_2, clear, arm empty. Yes.

8. Putdown blue_block_1: holding blue_block_1. Yes.

All steps are valid. All constraints are satisfied. This seems to be the optimal plan.
