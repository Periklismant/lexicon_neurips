Let's analyze the problem step by step. 

First, I need to understand the initial state:
- red_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_3 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2
- red_block_2 is on top of brown_block_3
- red_block_3 is on top of red_block_2
- brown_block_1, blue_block_1, and red_block_3 are clear
- I'm not holding any block

The goal is:
- brown_block_2 is clear

Currently, blue_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2, so we need to remove it to make brown_block_2 clear.

Now, let's analyze the constraints:

1. At some point, I must be holding blue_block_1.
2. Before I can hold blue_block_1, brown_block_3 must be on top of red_block_3.
3. At some point, red_block_2 must not be on top of red_block_3.
4. If red_block_2 is not on top of red_block_3, then red_block_2 must be clear either at that state or later.
5. At some point, either I must be holding red_block_2 or red_block_1 must not be on the table.
6. At some point, either blue_block_1 must be on the table or I must be holding brown_block_3.
7. At some point, either red_block_3 must be on the table or I must be holding red_block_1.

Let me think about a plan. Currently, we have:
red_block_1 on the table with brown_block_2 on it, and blue_block_1 on top of brown_block_2.
brown_block_1 on the table.
brown_block_3 on the table with red_block_2 on it, and red_block_3 on top of red_block_2.

To achieve the goal, I need to remove blue_block_1 from brown_block_2.

For constraint 2, I need to place brown_block_3 on top of red_block_3 before I can pick up blue_block_1. However, brown_block_3 has red_block_2 and red_block_3 on top of it. So I need to remove those first.

Let's start planning:

1. Unstack red_block_3 from red_block_2 (satisfies constraint 3)
2. Now red_block_2 is clear, satisfying constraint 4.
3. Unstack red_block_2 from brown_block_3 (satisfies constraint 5 by holding red_block_2)
4. Put red_block_2 on the table.
5. Pick up brown_block_3 (satisfies constraint 6 by holding brown_block_3)
6. Stack brown_block_3 on top of red_block_3 (satisfying constraint 2)
7. Now I can pick up blue_block_1 (satisfying constraint 1)
8. Put blue_block_1 on the table (satisfying constraint 6 by having blue_block_1 on the table)

At this point, brown_block_2 is clear, so I've achieved the goal.

But wait, I haven't addressed constraint 7. Let me check if I've already satisfied it. Constraint 7 requires either red_block_3 to be on the table or me holding red_block_1. After step 3, red_block_3 is on the table, so constraint 7 is satisfied.

Let's check if this plan satisfies all constraints:
1. At some point, I must be holding blue_block_1. Satisfied in step 7.
2. Before I can hold blue_block_1, brown_block_3 must be on top of red_block_3. Satisfied in step 6, before step 7.
3. At some point, red_block_2 must not be on top of red_block_3. Satisfied from the beginning since red_block_2 is on top of brown_block_3, not red_block_3.
4. If red_block_2 is not on top of red_block_3, then red_block_2 must be clear either at that state or later. red_block_2 is already clear in the initial state, so this is satisfied.

Actually, let me check constraint 3 again. It says red_block_2 must not be on top of red_block_3. In the initial state, red_block_3 is on top of red_block_2, not the other way around. So constraint 3 is not about the initial state, it's about causing a change where red_block_2 is not on top of red_block_3. So I need to make sure there's a state where red_block_2 is explicitly not on top of red_block_3.

But wait, the initial state doesn't have red_block_2 on top of red_block_3, it has red_block_3 on top of red_block_2. So red_block_2 is not on top of red_block_3 in the initial state, which means constraint 3 is satisfied.

Actually, I need to re-read the initial state:
"red_block_1 is on the table"
"brown_block_1 is on the table"
"brown_block_2 is on top of red_block_1"
"brown_block_3 is on the table"
"blue_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2"
"red_block_2 is on top of brown_block_3"
"red_block_3 is on top of red_block_2"

So initially, red_block_3 is on top of red_block_2, which means red_block_2 is not on top of red_block_3.

Let's continue checking the constraints:
3. At some point, red_block_2 must not be on top of red_block_3. This is true in the initial state.
4. If red_block_2 is not on top of red_block_3, then red_block_2 must be clear either at that state or later. In the initial state, red_block_2 is not clear (red_block_3 is on top of it), but it becomes clear after step 1.
5. At some point, either I must be holding red_block_2 or red_block_1 must not be on the table. This is satisfied in step 3 when I'm holding red_block_2.
6. At some point, either blue_block_1 must be on the table or I must be holding brown_block_3. This is satisfied in step 5 when I'm holding brown_block_3.
7. At some point, either red_block_3 must be on the table or I must be holding red_block_1. This is satisfied in steps 1 and 2 when red_block_3 is put on the table.

So, all constraints are satisfied by this plan.

Let me double-check the preconditions of each action in the plan:

1. Unstack red_block_3 from red_block_2
   - red_block_3 is on top of red_block_2: true
   - red_block_3 is clear: true
   - Not holding any block: true

2. Putdown red_block_3
   - Holding red_block_3: true (after step 1)

3. Unstack red_block_2 from brown_block_3
   - red_block_2 is on top of brown_block_3: true
   - red_block_2 is clear: true (after step 1)
   - Not holding any block: true (after step 2)

4. Putdown red_block_2
   - Holding red_block_2: true (after step 3)

5. Pickup brown_block_3
   - brown_block_3 is clear: true (after step 3)
   - brown_block_3 is on the table: true
   - Not holding any block: true (after step 4)

6. Stack brown_block_3 on top of red_block_3
   - Holding brown_block_3: true (after step 5)
   - red_block_3 is clear: true (after step 1)

7. Unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_2
   - blue_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2: true
   - blue_block_1 is clear: true
   - Not holding any block: true (after step 6)

8. Putdown blue_block_1
   - Holding blue_block_1: true (after step 7)

All preconditions are satisfied, so this is a valid plan.

However, there's one thing I'm not sure about. Constraint 7 asks for red_block_3 to be on the table OR holding red_block_1. In my plan, red_block_3 is on the table, so it satisfies the constraint. But I'm wondering if I've interpreted the constraint correctly, especially because other constraints require specific actions rather than just states. Let me reread it carefully.

Constraint 7: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "red_block_3 is on the table", "you are holding red_block_1"'"

Yes, this constraint just requires either of the two conditions to be true at some point. In my plan, red_block_3 is on the table after step 2, satisfying the constraint.

Actually, we need to consider optimality. Our goal is just to make brown_block_2 clear. In the initial state, blue_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2, so we just need to remove it. But the constraints require more steps.

Let's revise our plan to make it as optimal as possible while still satisfying all constraints:

1. Unstack red_block_3 from red_block_2 (satisfies constraint 3 and towards 4)
2. Putdown red_block_3 (satisfies constraint 7)
3. Unstack red_block_2 from brown_block_3 (satisfies constraint 4 and 5)
4. Putdown red_block_2
5. Pickup brown_block_3 (satisfies constraint 6)
6. Stack brown_block_3 on top of red_block_3 (towards constraint 2)
7. Unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_2 (satisfies constraint 1)
8. Putdown blue_block_1 (satisfies goal: brown_block_2 is clear)

This is an 8-step plan that satisfies all constraints. Let's see if we can optimize it further.

Actually, I think there's a way to optimize this plan by reordering some steps. The goal is to make brown_block_2 clear, but I need to satisfy all constraints. Let's try to optimize:

1. Unstack red_block_3 from red_block_2 (satisfies constraint 3 and towards 4)
2. Putdown red_block_3 (satisfies constraint 7)
3. Unstack red_block_2 from brown_block_3 (satisfies constraint 4 and 5)
4. Putdown red_block_2
5. Pickup brown_block_3 (satisfies constraint 6)
6. Stack brown_block_3 on top of red_block_3 (towards constraint 2)
7. Unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_2 (satisfies constraint 1 and goal)

Wait, I don't need to put blue_block_1 down, I just need to remove it from brown_block_2 to make brown_block_2 clear. So I can end with step 7, as the goal is just that brown_block_2 is clear.

However, I just realized that I'm not satisfying constraint 6 correctly. Constraint 6 requires either blue_block_1 to be on the table or me holding brown_block_3. In step 5, I'm holding brown_block_3, but I can't simultaneously hold brown_block_3 and blue_block_1, so if I end with holding blue_block_1, I won't be satisfying constraint 6 at the end.

So I do need to put blue_block_1 down:

1. Unstack red_block_3 from red_block_2 (satisfies constraint 3 and towards 4)
2. Putdown red_block_3 (satisfies constraint 7)
3. Unstack red_block_2 from brown_block_3 (satisfies constraint 4 and 5)
4. Putdown red_block_2
5. Pickup brown_block_3 (satisfies constraint 6)
6. Stack brown_block_3 on top of red_block_3 (towards constraint 2)
7. Unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_2 (satisfies constraint 1 and goal)
8. Putdown blue_block_1 (satisfies constraint 6)

This plan requires 8 steps. Let's see if there's a shorter valid plan that satisfies all constraints.

Actually, I think we can optimize by not putting red_block_2 on the table but stacking it on, say, brown_block_1. This would satisfy constraint 5 (holding red_block_2) and not require the putdown action:

1. Unstack red_block_3 from red_block_2 (satisfies constraint 3 and towards 4)
2. Putdown red_block_3 (satisfies constraint 7)
3. Unstack red_block_2 from brown_block_3 (satisfies constraint 4 and 5)
4. Stack red_block_2 on top of brown_block_1
5. Pickup brown_block_3 (satisfies constraint 6)
6. Stack brown_block_3 on top of red_block_3 (towards constraint 2)
7. Unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_2 (satisfies constraint 1 and goal)
8. Putdown blue_block_1 (satisfies constraint 6)

This is still 8 steps. Let me try again.

Let's consider another approach. The goal is to make brown_block_2 clear, which means removing blue_block_1 from it. But to satisfy constraint 1, I need to be holding blue_block_1 at some point. Because of constraint 2, before I can pick up blue_block_1, brown_block_3 must be on top of red_block_3. Let's see if we can rearrange this.

Wait, I think I misunderstood constraint 2. It doesn't say I can't pick up blue_block_1 unless brown_block_3 is on top of red_block_3. It says that IF I'm holding blue_block_1, THEN there must have been an earlier state where brown_block_3 was on top of red_block_3. So I can pick up blue_block_1 directly, but I need to ensure that at some point before that, brown_block_3 was on top of red_block_3.

This changes things. Let's reconsider.

Actually, reading constraint 2 again, it says "If expression 'you are holding blue_block_1' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'brown_block_3 is on top of red_block_3'". This means I can't pick up blue_block_1 unless brown_block_3 has been on top of red_block_3 at some earlier point. So my original understanding was correct.

Given this, I need to first set up brown_block_3 on top of red_block_3, and only then can I pick up blue_block_1.

Now, let's consider a different approach. 

Let's visualize the initial state:
- red_block_1 on the table, with brown_block_2 and blue_block_1 stacked on it.
- brown_block_1 on the table.
- brown_block_3 on the table, with red_block_2 and red_block_3 stacked on it.

To achieve the goal of making brown_block_2 clear, I need to remove blue_block_1 from brown_block_2.

To satisfy constraint 2, before I can hold blue_block_1, brown_block_3 must be on top of red_block_3. This means I first need to rearrange the blocks on brown_block_3.

Let's try a different approach:

1. Unstack red_block_3 from red_block_2
2. Stack red_block_3 on top of brown_block_1 (this frees up red_block_2 and puts red_block_3 somewhere)
3. Unstack red_block_2 from brown_block_3
4. Putdown red_block_2 (satisfies constraint 5 by holding red_block_2 in step 3)
5. Pickup red_block_3 (from brown_block_1)
6. Putdown red_block_3 (putting red_block_3 on the table satisfies constraint 7)
7. Pickup brown_block_3
8. Stack brown_block_3 on top of red_block_3 (satisfies constraint 2)
9. Unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_2 (satisfies constraint 1 and goal)
10. Putdown blue_block_1 (satisfies constraint 6)

This is a 10-step plan, which is longer than the 8-step plan I had earlier. Let's revert to the 8-step plan.

Actually, I think we can optimize this by directly stacking brown_block_3 on red_block_3 after removing red_block_2, instead of putting red_block_2 down first:

1. Unstack red_block_3 from red_block_2 (satisfies constraint 3 and towards 4)
2. Putdown red_block_3 (satisfies constraint 7)
3. Unstack red_block_2 from brown_block_3 (satisfies constraint 4 and 5)
4. Stack red_block_2 on top of brown_block_1 (I don't need to put it on the table)
5. Pickup brown_block_3 (satisfies constraint 6)
6. Stack brown_block_3 on top of red_block_3 (towards constraint 2)
7. Unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_2 (satisfies constraint 1 and goal)
8. Putdown blue_block_1 (satisfies constraint 6)

This is still 8 steps. Let's see if there's a more efficient way.

Actually, constraint 6 says "At some point, either blue_block_1 must be on the table or I must be holding brown_block_3." In step 5, I'm holding brown_block_3, which satisfies constraint 6. So if I end the plan after unstacking blue_block_1, I wouldn't be satisfying constraint 6 at the final state. But I don't need to; I just need to satisfy it at some point during the execution of the plan, and that happens in step 5.

So, let's revise:

1. Unstack red_block_3 from red_block_2 (satisfies constraint 3 and towards 4)
2. Putdown red_block_3 (satisfies constraint 7)
3. Unstack red_block_2 from brown_block_3 (satisfies constraint 4 and 5)
4. Stack red_block_2 on top of brown_block_1 (I don't need to put it on the table)
5. Pickup brown_block_3 (satisfies constraint 6)
6. Stack brown_block_3 on top of red_block_3 (towards constraint 2)
7. Unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_2 (satisfies constraint 1 and goal)

This is 7 steps. I'm not sure if we can do better, given all the constraints.

Hold on, I need to double-check our understanding of constraint 6 again. It states: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "blue_block_1 is on the table", "you are holding brown_block_3"'". This means that at some point during the plan, either blue_block_1 is on the table OR I am holding brown_block_3. In the final state of my 7-step plan, neither of these is true; I'm holding blue_block_1.

I need to either:
1. Put blue_block_1 on the table, or
2. Ensure that during the execution, I'm holding brown_block_3.

Actually, in my 7-step plan, I am holding brown_block_3 in step 5, which does satisfy constraint 6. So the 7-step plan should be valid.

Let's recap the plan:

1. Unstack red_block_3 from red_block_2
2. Putdown red_block_3
3. Unstack red_block_2 from brown_block_3
4. Stack red_block_2 on top of brown_block_1
5. Pickup brown_block_3
6. Stack brown_block_3 on top of red_block_3
7. Unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_2

And let's check if all constraints are satisfied:

1. At some point, I must be holding blue_block_1. Satisfied in step 7.
2. Before I can hold blue_block_1, brown_block_3 must be on top of red_block_3. Satisfied in step 6, before step 7.
3. At some point, red_block_2 must not be on top of red_block_3. This is true after step 1.
4. If red_block_2 is not on top of red_block_3, then red_block_2 must be clear either at that state or later. red_block_2 is clear after step 1.
5. At some point, either I must be holding red_block_2 or red_block_1 must not be on the table. I'm holding red_block_2 in step 3.
6. At some point, either blue_block_1 must be on the table or I must be holding brown_block_3. I'm holding brown_block_3 in step 5.
7. At some point, either red_block_3 must be on the table or I must be holding red_block_1. red_block_3 is on the table after step 2.

All constraints are satisfied by this 7-step plan.

Let's check the preconditions of each action in the plan to ensure it's valid:

1. Unstack red_block_3 from red_block_2
   - red_block_3 is on top of red_block_2: true
   - red_block_3 is clear: true
   - Not holding any block: true

2. Putdown red_block_3
   - Holding red_block_3: true (after step 1)

3. Unstack red_block_2 from brown_block_3
   - red_block_2 is on top of brown_block_3: true
   - red_block_2 is clear: true (after step 1)
   - Not holding any block: true (after step 2)

4. Stack red_block_2 on top of brown_block_1
   - Holding red_block_2: true (after step 3)
   - brown_block_1 is clear: true

5. Pickup brown_block_3
   - brown_block_3 is clear: true (after step 3)
   - brown_block_3 is on the table: true
   - Not holding any block: true (after step 4)

6. Stack brown_block_3 on top of red_block_3
   - Holding brown_block_3: true (after step 5)
   - red_block_3 is clear: true (after step 2)

7. Unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_2
   - blue_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2: true
   - blue_block_1 is clear: true
   - Not holding any block: true (after step 6)

All preconditions are satisfied, confirming the validity of the plan.

Actually, wait, I need to double-check again. Constraint 6 requires blue_block_1 to be on the table OR holding brown_block_3. In step 5 of my plan, I'm holding brown_block_3, which satisfies this constraint.

OK, I'm confident that this 7-step plan satisfies all constraints and is valid:
1. Unstack red_block_3 from red_block_2
2. Putdown red_block_3
3. Unstack red_block_2 from brown_block_3
4. Stack red_block_2 on top of brown_block_1
5. Pickup brown_block_3
6. Stack brown_block_3 on top of red_block_3
7. Unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_2

Now, if I want to ensure the plan is optimal, I would need to argue that there isn't a shorter plan that satisfies all constraints. Let's consider:

- The goal requires me to make brown_block_2 clear, which means removing blue_block_1 from it.
- Constraint 1 requires me to hold blue_block_1 at some point.
- Constraint 2 requires brown_block_3 to be on top of red_block_3 before I can hold blue_block_1. This means I need to handle the tower on brown_block_3 before addressing the goal directly.
- The steps to put brown_block_3 on top of red_block_3 involve unstacking red_block_3 and red_block_2 from their initial positions and repositioning them.

Given these requirements, I don't see a way to achieve the goal in fewer than 7 steps. Each step in the plan is necessary, and I've optimized by stacking red_block_2 on brown_block_1 instead of putting it on the table.

So, I believe this 7-step plan is optimal for the given constraints:

1. Unstack red_block_3 from red_block_2
2. Putdown red_block_3
3. Unstack red_block_2 from brown_block_3
4. Stack red_block_2 on top of brown_block_1
5. Pickup brown_block_3
6. Stack brown_block_3 on top of red_block_3
7. Unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_2

Actually, let's double-check our constraint 6 one more time, and think of all the combinations where it's satisfied. Constraint 6 requires: (blue_block_1 is on the table OR holding brown_block_3). In step 5, we're holding brown_block_3, which satisfies the constraint.

Constraint 7 requires: (red_block_3 on the table OR holding red_block_1). In step 2, we put red_block_3 on the table, which satisfies the constraint.

So, we're satisfying all constraints with this plan. Let's check once more if there's a way to optimize:

- We need to remove red_block_3 and red_block_2 from their initial positions to put brown_block_3 on top of red_block_3.
- Once we remove red_block_3, we can put it on the table.
- We also need to remove red_block_2 from brown_block_3. We can put it somewhere, and I chose to stack it on brown_block_1 because it saves a putdown operation.
- I then need to pick up brown_block_3 and stack it on red_block_3, satisfying constraint 2.
- Finally, I can unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_2, satisfying the goal and constraint 1.

This sequence of operations seems minimal, so I'll stick with the 7-step plan.

unstack red_block_3 red_block_2
putdown red_block_3
unstack red_block_2 brown_block_3
stack red_block_2 brown_block_1
pickup brown_block_3
stack brown_block_3 red_block_3
unstack blue_block_1 brown_block_2
