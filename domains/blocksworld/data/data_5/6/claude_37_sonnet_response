Alright, let's understand the planning problem:

We have a blocksworld scenario with the following initial state:
- `purple_block_1` is on the table
- `brown_block_1` is on top of `purple_block_1`
- `yellow_block_1` is on top of `brown_block_1`
- `purple_block_2` is on the table
- `black_block_1` is on the table
- `orange_block_1` is on the table
- `white_block_1` is on top of `yellow_block_1`
- `purple_block_2`, `black_block_1`, `orange_block_1`, and `white_block_1` are all clear
- The robot is not holding any block

Our goal is to:
- The robot must be holding `orange_block_1`

However, the valid plan must also abide by the following constraints:

1. At some point, `orange_block_1` must not be on the table.
2. Before `orange_block_1` is lifted from the table, either `yellow_block_1` should be on top of `white_block_1` or `black_block_1` should not be on the table.
3. At some point, either `purple_block_1` should be on top of `black_block_1` or `yellow_block_1` should be on top of `purple_block_2`.
4. At some point, `orange_block_1` must not be clear (i.e., there's a block on top of it).
5. Before `orange_block_1` is not clear, both `purple_block_2` should be on top of `black_block_1` and `brown_block_1` should be on the table.
6. At some point, the robot must hold `purple_block_1`.
7. At some point, `purple_block_2` must not be clear (i.e., there's a block on top of it).

Alright, let's try to devise a plan:

1. First, I need to ensure constraint #3 is met. I can place either `purple_block_1` on top of `black_block_1` or `yellow_block_1` on top of `purple_block_2`. I will choose to place `yellow_block_1` on top of `purple_block_2`.

2. For constraint #5, before `orange_block_1` is not clear, I need to make sure that `purple_block_2` is on top of `black_block_1` and `brown_block_1` is on the table. This might be challenging because I initially want to put `yellow_block_1` on top of `purple_block_2`.

Given all these constraints, let's think about the sequencing:

1. For constraint #6, I need to hold `purple_block_1` at some point. To do that, I first need to clear it by removing `brown_block_1` and `yellow_block_1` from above it.

2. For constraint #7, I need to have a block on top of `purple_block_2`. This aligns with my decision to place `yellow_block_1` on top of `purple_block_2` for constraint #3.

3. For constraint #4, I need to place a block on top of `orange_block_1`. I might use one of the blocks from the tower.

4. For constraint #2, before lifting `orange_block_1` from the table, I need to ensure that either `yellow_block_1` is on top of `white_block_1` or `black_block_1` is not on the table. Since I'm planning to use `black_block_1` for other constraints, I'll try to place `yellow_block_1` on top of `white_block_1`.

Let's sketch a rough plan:

1. `unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1` (to start dismantling the tower)
2. `putdown white_block_1`
3. `unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1`
4. `stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2` (satisfying constraint #3 and #7)
5. `unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1` (to access `purple_block_1` for constraint #6)
6. `putdown brown_block_1` (contributing to constraint #5)
7. `unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2` (to enable future moves)
8. `stack yellow_block_1 white_block_1` (satisfying constraint #2)
9. `unstack purple_block_2 black_block_1` (if needed, but wait, `purple_block_2` isn't on `black_block_1` yet)

This isn't quite working. Let's step back and be a bit more methodical. Let's check the constraints again and see which ones we need to satisfy before picking up `orange_block_1`:

Before picking up `orange_block_1`, we need to ensure:
- Constraint #2: Either `yellow_block_1` is on top of `white_block_1` or `black_block_1` is not on the table.
- Constraint #5: Before `orange_block_1` is not clear, both `purple_block_2` should be on top of `black_block_1` and `brown_block_1` should be on the table.

Alright, let's try to trace a possible sequence of states:

I think to satisfy constraint #6, we need to first unstack the tower to get to `purple_block_1`:

1. `unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1`
2. `putdown white_block_1`
3. `unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1`
4. `putdown yellow_block_1`
5. `unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1`
6. `putdown brown_block_1` (now `brown_block_1` is on the table, satisfying part of constraint #5)
7. `pickup purple_block_1` (satisfying constraint #6)

Now, we can use `purple_block_1` to satisfy constraint #3:

8. `stack purple_block_1 black_block_1` (satisfying constraint #3)

Next, we need to move `purple_block_2` on top of `black_block_1` for constraint #5:

9. `unstack purple_block_1 black_block_1`
10. `putdown purple_block_1`
11. `pickup purple_block_2`
12. `stack purple_block_2 black_block_1` (satisfying another part of constraint #5)

Now we need to place a block on top of `orange_block_1` for constraint #4. But before that, we need to ensure constraint #2 is satisfied:

13. `pickup yellow_block_1`
14. `stack yellow_block_1 white_block_1` (satisfying constraint #2)

15. `pickup purple_block_1`
16. `stack purple_block_1 orange_block_1` (satisfying constraint #4)

Now, to achieve our goal, we need to pick up `orange_block_1`. But before that, we need to clear it by removing `purple_block_1`:

17. `unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1`
18. `putdown purple_block_1`

Finally, we can pick up `orange_block_1` to achieve our goal:

19. `pickup orange_block_1` (goal achieved)

But wait, this doesn't satisfy constraint #1, which requires that `orange_block_1` not be on the table at some point. But in our goal, we're holding `orange_block_1`, which inherently means it's not on the table. So, constraint #1 is satisfied.

Actually, upon review, I noticed a few inconsistencies in my reasoning. Let's ensure constraints #4 and #5 are met correctly.

From constraint #5: Before `orange_block_1` is not clear, both `purple_block_2` should be on top of `black_block_1` and `brown_block_1` should be on the table.

From constraint #4: At some point, `orange_block_1` must not be clear (i.e., there's a block on top of it).

So, we need to place a block on top of `orange_block_1` (constraint #4), but before doing that, we need to ensure `purple_block_2` is on top of `black_block_1` and `brown_block_1` is on the table (constraint #5).

Let's revise the plan:

1. `unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1`
2. `putdown white_block_1`
3. `unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1`
4. `putdown yellow_block_1`
5. `unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1`
6. `putdown brown_block_1` (now `brown_block_1` is on the table, satisfying part of constraint #5)
7. `pickup purple_block_1` (satisfying constraint #6)
8. `putdown purple_block_1`
9. `pickup purple_block_2`
10. `stack purple_block_2 black_block_1` (satisfying another part of constraint #5)

Now that both conditions of constraint #5, we can place a block on top of `orange_block_1` for constraint #4:

11. `pickup yellow_block_1`
12. `stack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1` (satisfying constraint #4)

Next, we need to ensure constraint #3 is satisfied (either `purple_block_1` on top of `black_block_1` or `yellow_block_1` on top of `purple_block_2`). Since `yellow_block_1` is now on top of `orange_block_1`, and before we pick up `orange_block_1`, we'd need to remove `yellow_block_1` from it, we should satisfy constraint #3 by putting `purple_block_1` on top of `black_block_1`:

13. `pickup purple_block_1`
14. `stack purple_block_1 black_block_1` (satisfying constraint #3, although there's an issue here because `purple_block_2` is already on top of `black_block_1`)

Actually, it seems I'm getting a bit inconsistent. Let's try a different approach. Let's start by clarifying the constraints again:

1. At some point, `orange_block_1` must not be on the table.
2. Before `orange_block_1` is lifted from the table, either `yellow_block_1` should be on top of `white_block_1` or `black_block_1` should not be on the table.
3. At some point, either `purple_block_1` should be on top of `black_block_1` or `yellow_block_1` should be on top of `purple_block_2`.
4. At some point, `orange_block_1` must not be clear (i.e., there's a block on top of it).
5. Before `orange_block_1` is not clear, both `purple_block_2` should be on top of `black_block_1` and `brown_block_1` should be on the table.
6. At some point, the robot must hold `purple_block_1`.
7. At some point, `purple_block_2` must not be clear (i.e., there's a block on top of it).

I think I'm overthinking. Let's create a simpler but effective plan:

1. First, we need to dismantle the tower to access `purple_block_1` for constraint #6:
   - `unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1`
   - `putdown white_block_1`
   - `unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1`
   - `putdown yellow_block_1`
   - `unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1`
   - `putdown brown_block_1` (now `brown_block_1` is on the table, satisfying part of constraint #5)
   - `pickup purple_block_1` (satisfying constraint #6)

2. For constraint #5, we need `purple_block_2` on top of `black_block_1` and `brown_block_1` on the table before `orange_block_1` is not clear:
   - `putdown purple_block_1`
   - `pickup purple_block_2`
   - `stack purple_block_2 black_block_1` (satisfying part of constraint #5)
   - (Note: `brown_block_1` is already on the table, so constraint #5 is now fully satisfied)

3. For constraint #4, `orange_block_1` must not be clear at some point:
   - `pickup yellow_block_1`
   - `stack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1` (satisfying constraint #4)

4. For constraint #3, either `purple_block_1` should be on top of `black_block_1` or `yellow_block_1` should be on top of `purple_block_2`:
   - `unstack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1`
   - `stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2` (satisfying constraints #3 and #7)

5. For constraint #2, before lifting `orange_block_1`, either `yellow_block_1` should be on top of `white_block_1` or `black_block_1` should not be on the table:
   - `unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2`
   - `stack yellow_block_1 white_block_1` (satisfying constraint #2)

6. Finally, pick up `orange_block_1` to achieve the goal:
   - `pickup orange_block_1` (satisfying constraint #1 and the goal)

Let me double-check this plan:

- Constraint #1: `orange_block_1` must not be on the table at some point. This is satisfied at the end when the robot is holding `orange_block_1`.
- Constraint #2: Before `orange_block_1` is lifted from the table, either `yellow_block_1` should be on top of `white_block_1` or `black_block_1` should not be on the table. We ensure `yellow_block_1` is on top of `white_block_1` just before picking up `orange_block_1`.
- Constraint #3: At some point, either `purple_block_1` should be on top of `black_block_1` or `yellow_block_1` should be on top of `purple_block_2`. We ensure `yellow_block_1` is on top of `purple_block_2`.
- Constraint #4: At some point, `orange_block_1` must not be clear. We put `yellow_block_1` on top of `orange_block_1`.
- Constraint #5: Before `orange_block_1` is not clear, both `purple_block_2` should be on top of `black_block_1` and `brown_block_1` should be on the table. We ensure both conditions are met before placing `yellow_block_1` on `orange_block_1`.
- Constraint #6: The robot must hold `purple_block_1` at some point. We ensure this.
- Constraint #7: At some point, `purple_block_2` must not be clear. We put `yellow_block_1` on top of `purple_block_2`.

The plan seems consistent. Let's ensure it's also optimal.

1. `unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1`
2. `putdown white_block_1`
3. `unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1`
4. `putdown yellow_block_1`
5. `unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1`
6. `putdown brown_block_1`
7. `pickup purple_block_1` (constraint #6)
8. `putdown purple_block_1`
9. `pickup purple_block_2`
10. `stack purple_block_2 black_block_1` (part of constraint #5)
11. `pickup yellow_block_1`
12. `stack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1` (constraint #4)
13. `unstack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1`
14. `stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2` (constraints #3 and #7)
15. `unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2`
16. `stack yellow_block_1 white_block_1` (constraint #2)
17. `pickup orange_block_1` (goal and constraint #1)

Actually, I think we can be more efficient. We don't need to put down `purple_block_1` after picking it up; we can directly stack it somewhere. And we also need to reconsider the exact sequencing.

Let's try once more:

1. `unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1`
2. `putdown white_block_1`
3. `unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1`
4. `putdown yellow_block_1`
5. `unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1` (now `brown_block_1` is being held, which is not on the table yet)
6. `putdown brown_block_1` (now `brown_block_1` is on the table for constraint #5)
7. `pickup purple_block_1` (constraint #6)
8. `putdown purple_block_1` (needed as we can only hold one block at a time)
9. `pickup purple_block_2`
10. `stack purple_block_2 black_block_1` (part of constraint #5, and also fulfilling constraint #2 as `black_block_1` is now not on the table)

Given we've fulfilled constraint #2 by ensuring `black_block_1` is not on the table, we can now pick up `orange_block_1`. However, we still need to satisfy constraints #3, #4, and #7. Let's see if we can be more efficient:

11. `pickup yellow_block_1`
12. `stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2` (constraints #3 and #7)
13. `unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2`
14. `stack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1` (constraint #4)
15. `unstack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1`
16. `putdown yellow_block_1`
17. `pickup orange_block_1` (goal and constraint #1)

Wait, I said we fulfilled constraint #2, but I'm mistaken. Constraint #2 states: "If `orange_block_1 is not on the table` holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which either `yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1` or `black_block_1 is not on the table`". 

When we pick up `orange_block_1` at step 17, it's no longer on the table. So, before step 17, either `yellow_block_1` should be on top of `white_block_1` or `black_block_1` should not be on the table. In our case, at step 10, we've ensured that `black_block_1` is not on the table (since `purple_block_2` is on top of it). So constraint #2 is indeed satisfied.

Let's check the plan once more:

1. `unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1`
2. `putdown white_block_1`
3. `unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1`
4. `putdown yellow_block_1`
5. `unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1`
6. `putdown brown_block_1` (now `brown_block_1` is on the table for constraint #5)
7. `pickup purple_block_1` (constraint #6)
8. `putdown purple_block_1`
9. `pickup purple_block_2`
10. `stack purple_block_2 black_block_1` (part of constraint #5, and also ensuring `black_block_1` is not on the table for constraint #2)
11. `pickup yellow_block_1`
12. `stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2` (constraints #3 and #7)
13. `unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2`
14. `stack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1` (constraint #4)
15. `unstack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1`
16. `putdown yellow_block_1`
17. `pickup orange_block_1` (goal and constraint #1)

I just realized we are missing something. Constraint #5 states: "If `there is a block on top of orange_block_1` holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which both `purple_block_2 is on top of black_block_1` and `brown_block_1 is on the table`". 

At step 14, we put `yellow_block_1` on top of `orange_block_1`, so there's a block on top of `orange_block_1`. Before this, we need to ensure both `purple_block_2 is on top of black_block_1` and `brown_block_1 is on the table`. At step 10, we've ensured `purple_block_2 is on top of black_block_1`, and at step 6, we've ensured `brown_block_1 is on the table`. So, constraint #5 is indeed satisfied.

I think the plan is valid. Let me review it once more:

1. `unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1`
2. `putdown white_block_1`
3. `unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1`
4. `putdown yellow_block_1`
5. `unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1`
6. `putdown brown_block_1` (satisfying part of constraint #5)
7. `pickup purple_block_1` (satisfying constraint #6)
8. `putdown purple_block_1`
9. `pickup purple_block_2`
10. `stack purple_block_2 black_block_1` (satisfying the rest of constraint #5 and also ensuring `black_block_1` is not on the table for constraint #2)
11. `pickup yellow_block_1`
12. `stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2` (satisfying constraints #3 and #7)
13. `unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2`
14. `stack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1` (satisfying constraint #4)
15. `unstack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1`
16. `putdown yellow_block_1`
17. `pickup orange_block_1` (satisfying the goal and constraint #1)

I think this plan is valid and optimal, given all the constraints.

However, I just noticed that we can make the plan more efficient:

After step 13, `unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2`, we can directly place `yellow_block_1` on `white_block_1` (which is still on the table from step 2), and then pick up `orange_block_1`. This would skip the unnecessary stacking and unstacking on `orange_block_1`.

Let's revise the plan:

1. `unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1`
2. `putdown white_block_1`
3. `unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1`
4. `putdown yellow_block_1`
5. `unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1`
6. `putdown brown_block_1` (satisfying part of constraint #5)
7. `pickup purple_block_1` (satisfying constraint #6)
8. `putdown purple_block_1`
9. `pickup purple_block_2`
10. `stack purple_block_2 black_block_1` (satisfying the rest of constraint #5 and also ensuring `black_block_1` is not on the table for constraint #2)
11. `pickup yellow_block_1`
12. `stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2` (satisfying constraints #3 and #7)
13. `unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2`
14. `stack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1` (satisfying constraint #4)
15. `unstack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1`
16. `stack yellow_block_1 white_block_1` (satisfying constraint #2)
17. `pickup orange_block_1` (satisfying the goal and constraint #1)

Actually, I think there's still a more efficient way. Let's reconsider:

Constraint #2 states: "If `orange_block_1 is not on the table` holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which either `yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1` or `black_block_1 is not on the table`". 

This means before we pick up `orange_block_1`, either `yellow_block_1` should be on top of `white_block_1` or `black_block_1` should not be on the table. Since at step 10, `black_block_1` is not on the table (as `purple_block_2` is on top of it), we've already satisfied constraint #2. We don't need to have `yellow_block_1` on top of `white_block_1`.

So, after step 14, we can directly pickup `orange_block_1` without needing to stack `yellow_block_1` on `white_block_1`. This would make the plan even shorter.

Let's revise the plan once more:

1. `unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1`
2. `putdown white_block_1`
3. `unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1`
4. `putdown yellow_block_1`
5. `unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1`
6. `putdown brown_block_1` (satisfying part of constraint #5)
7. `pickup purple_block_1` (satisfying constraint #6)
8. `putdown purple_block_1`
9. `pickup purple_block_2`
10. `stack purple_block_2 black_block_1` (satisfying the rest of constraint #5 and also ensuring `black_block_1` is not on the table for constraint #2)
11. `pickup yellow_block_1`
12. `stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2` (satisfying constraints #3 and #7)
13. `unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2`
14. `stack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1` (satisfying constraint #4)
15. `unstack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1`
16. `putdown yellow_block_1`
17. `pickup orange_block_1` (satisfying the goal and constraint #1)

I think this plan is more efficient and satisfies all the constraints. Let's just check the constraints once more:

Constraint #1: `orange_block_1` must not be on the table at some point. This is satisfied at step 17 when the robot is holding `orange_block_1`.

Constraint #2: Before `orange_block_1` is lifted from the table, either `yellow_block_1` should be on top of `white_block_1` or `black_block_1` should not be on the table. At step 10, we've ensured `black_block_1` is not on the table, which satisfies this constraint.

Constraint #3: At some point, either `purple_block_1` should be on top of `black_block_1` or `yellow_block_1` should be on top of `purple_block_2`. At step 12, we've ensured `yellow_block_1` is on top of `purple_block_2`.

Constraint #4: At some point, `orange_block_1` must not be clear. At step 14, we put `yellow_block_1` on top of `orange_block_1`.

Constraint #5: Before `orange_block_1` is not clear, both `purple_block_2` should be on top of `black_block_1` and `brown_block_1` should be on the table. At steps 6 and 10, we've ensured these conditions are met.

Constraint #6: The robot must hold `purple_block_1` at some point. At step 7, we pick up `purple_block_1`.

Constraint #7: At some point, `purple_block_2` must not be clear. At step 12, we put `yellow_block_1` on top of `purple_block_2`.

All constraints are satisfied. I think the 17-step plan is valid and optimal.

Actually, let me see if I can make the plan even more efficient:

We need to satisfy constraints #3 and #7 by placing `yellow_block_1` on top of `purple_block_2` at some point. We also need to satisfy constraint #4 by placing a block on top of `orange_block_1` at some point. The block we choose to place on top of `orange_block_1` doesn't have to be `yellow_block_1`; it could be any block.

Let's see if we can optimize the path:

1. `unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1`
2. `stack white_block_1 orange_block_1` (satisfying constraint #4, skipping the step of putting it down on the table)
3. `unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1`
4. `stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2` (satisfying constraints #3 and #7)
5. `unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1`
6. `putdown brown_block_1` (satisfying part of constraint #5)
7. `pickup purple_block_1` (satisfying constraint #6)
8. `putdown purple_block_1`
9. `pickup purple_block_2` (but this isn't valid as `yellow_block_1` is on top of it from step 4)

This approach doesn't work. Let's try again:

1. `unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1`
2. `putdown white_block_1`
3. `unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1`
4. `putdown yellow_block_1`
5. `unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1`
6. `putdown brown_block_1` (satisfying part of constraint #5)
7. `pickup purple_block_1` (satisfying constraint #6)
8. `stack purple_block_1 orange_block_1` (satisfying constraint #4)
9. `pickup purple_block_2`
10. `stack purple_block_2 black_block_1` (satisfying the rest of constraint #5 and also ensuring `black_block_1` is not on the table for constraint #2)
11. `pickup yellow_block_1`
12. `stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2` (satisfying constraints #3 and #7)
13. `unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1`
14. `putdown purple_block_1`
15. `pickup orange_block_1` (satisfying the goal and constraint #1)

This is a 15-step plan, which is more efficient than the 17-step plan I provided earlier. Let me double-check all constraints:

Constraint #1: `orange_block_1` must not be on the table at some point. This is satisfied at step 15 when the robot is holding `orange_block_1`.

Constraint #2: Before `orange_block_1` is lifted from the table, either `yellow_block_1` should be on top of `white_block_1` or `black_block_1` should not be on the table. At step 10, we've ensured `black_block_1` is not on the table, which satisfies this constraint.

Constraint #3: At some point, either `purple_block_1` should be on top of `black_block_1` or `yellow_block_1` should be on top of `purple_block_2`. At step 12, we've ensured `yellow_block_1` is on top of `purple_block_2`.

Constraint #4: At some point, `orange_block_1` must not be clear. At step 8, we put `purple_block_1` on top of `orange_block_1`.

Constraint #5: Before `orange_block_1` is not clear, both `purple_block_2` should be on top of `black_block_1` and `brown_block_1` should be on the table. At steps 6 and 10, we've ensured these conditions are met.

Constraint #6: The robot must hold `purple_block_1` at some point. At step 7, we pick up `purple_block_1`.

Constraint #7: At some point, `purple_block_2` must not be clear. At step 12, we put `yellow_block_1` on top of `purple_block_2`.

All constraints are satisfied.

But wait, I just realized there's an issue: in constraint #5, the sequence matters. If we stack `purple_block_1` on `orange_block_1` at step 8, then `orange_block_1` is not clear. But at this point, we haven't yet stack `purple_block_2` on `black_block_1` (which happens at step 10). This violates the constraint.

Let's adjust the plan:

1. `unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1`
2. `putdown white_block_1`
3. `unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1`
4. `putdown yellow_block_1`
5. `unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1`
6. `putdown brown_block_1` (satisfying part of constraint #5)
7. `pickup purple_block_1` (satisfying constraint #6)
8. `putdown purple_block_1`
9. `pickup purple_block_2`
10. `stack purple_block_2 black_block_1` (satisfying the rest of constraint #5)
11. `pickup purple_block_1`
12. `stack purple_block_1 orange_block_1` (satisfying constraint #4)
13. `pickup yellow_block_1`
14. `stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2` (satisfying constraints #3 and #7)
15. `unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1`
16. `putdown purple_block_1`
17. `pickup orange_block_1` (satisfying the goal and constraint #1)

This is a 17-step plan, the same as the one I provided earlier. Let me try once more to see if I can optimize it:

I notice that in the plan, we put down `purple_block_1` at step 8 and then pick it up again at step 11. We could potentially eliminate these steps. Let's try:

1. `unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1`
2. `putdown white_block_1`
3. `unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1`
4. `putdown yellow_block_1`
5. `unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1`
6. `putdown brown_block_1` (satisfying part of constraint #5)
7. `pickup purple_block_2`
8. `stack purple_block_2 black_block_1` (satisfying the rest of constraint #5)
9. `pickup purple_block_1` (satisfying constraint #6)
10. `stack purple_block_1 orange_block_1` (satisfying constraint #4)
11. `pickup yellow_block_1`
12. `stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2` (satisfying constraints #3 and #7)
13. `unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1`
14. `putdown purple_block_1`
15. `pickup orange_block_1` (satisfying the goal and constraint #1)

This is a 15-step plan. Let me double-check all constraints:

Constraint #1: `orange_block_1` must not be on the table at some point. This is satisfied at step 15 when the robot is holding `orange_block_1`.

Constraint #2: Before `orange_block_1` is lifted from the table, either `yellow_block_1` should be on top of `white_block_1` or `black_block_1` should not be on the table. At step 8, we've ensured `black_block_1` is not on the table, which satisfies this constraint.

Constraint #3: At some point, either `purple_block_1` should be on top of `black_block_1` or `yellow_block_1` should be on top of `purple_block_2`. At step 12, we've ensured `yellow_block_1` is on top of `purple_block_2`.

Constraint #4: At some point, `orange_block_1` must not be clear. At step 10, we put `purple_block_1` on top of `orange_block_1`.

Constraint #5: Before `orange_block_1` is not clear, both `purple_block_2` should be on top of `black_block_1` and `brown_block_1` should be on the table. At steps 6 and 8, we've ensured these conditions are met before step 10, where we make `orange_block_1` not clear.

Constraint #6: The robot must hold `purple_block_1` at some point. At step 9, we pick up `purple_block_1`.

Constraint #7: At some point, `purple_block_2` must not be clear. At step 12, we put `yellow_block_1` on top of `purple_block_2`.

All constraints are satisfied. I think this 15-step plan is valid and optimal.

Actually, I realized we can eliminiate another step. After unstacking `brown_block_1` from `purple_block_1`, we can stack it somewhere (instead of just putting it down), which would save a step. Let's see:

1. `unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1`
2. `putdown white_block_1`
3. `unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1`
4. `putdown yellow_block_1`
5. `unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1`
6. `stack brown_block_1 white_block_1` (satisfying part of constraint #5)
7. `pickup purple_block_2`
8. `stack purple_block_2 black_block_1` (satisfying the rest of constraint #5)
9. `pickup purple_block_1` (satisfying constraint #6)
10. `stack purple_block_1 orange_block_1` (satisfying constraint #4)
11. `pickup yellow_block_1`
12. `stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2` (satisfying constraints #3 and #7)
13. `unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1`
14. `putdown purple_block_1`
15. `pickup orange_block_1` (satisfying the goal and constraint #1)

But this doesn't actually save a step as we still need the same number of actions.

One more attempt: let's see if we can use `white_block_1` to satisfy constraint #4 by placing it on top of `orange_block_1`:

1. `unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1`
2. `stack white_block_1 orange_block_1` (satisfying constraint #4)
3. `unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1`
4. `putdown yellow_block_1`
5. `unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1`
6. `putdown brown_block_1` (satisfying part of constraint #5)
7. `pickup purple_block_2`
8. `stack purple_block_2 black_block_1` (satisfying the rest of constraint #5 and also ensuring `black_block_1` is not on the table for constraint #2. But wait, constraint #5 says that before `orange_block_1` is not clear, `purple_block_2` should be on top of `black_block_1` and `brown_block_1` should be on the table. But at step 2, we make `orange_block_1` not clear, and we haven't yet satisfied these conditions. So this approach doesn't work.)

Let's stick with the 15-step plan:

1. `unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1`
2. `putdown white_block_1`
3. `unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1`
4. `putdown yellow_block_1`
5. `unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1`
6. `putdown brown_block_1` (satisfying part of constraint #5)
7. `pickup purple_block_2`
8. `stack purple_block_2 black_block_1` (satisfying the rest of constraint #5)
9. `pickup purple_block_1` (satisfying constraint #6)
10. `stack purple_block_1 orange_block_1` (satisfying constraint #4)
11. `pickup yellow_block_1`
12. `stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2` (satisfying constraints #3 and #7)
13. `unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1`
14. `putdown purple_block_1`
15. `pickup orange_block_1` (satisfying the goal and constraint #1)

I think this is the optimal plan.

Just to double check once more on the constraints:

Constraint #1: `orange_block_1` must not be on the table at some point. This is satisfied at step 15 when the robot is holding `orange_block_1`.

Constraint #2: Before `orange_block_1` is lifted from the table (which happens at step 15), either `yellow_block_1` should be on top of `white_block_1` or `black_block_1` should not be on the table. At step 8, we've ensured `black_block_1` is not on the table, which satisfies this constraint.

Constraint #3: At some point, either `purple_block_1` should be on top of `black_block_1` or `yellow_block_1` should be on top of `purple_block_2`. At step 12, we've ensured `yellow_block_1` is on top of `purple_block_2`.

Constraint #4: At some point, `orange_block_1` must not be clear. At step 10, we put `purple_block_1` on top of `orange_block_1`.

Constraint #5: Before `orange_block_1` is not clear (which happens at step 10), both `purple_block_2` should be on top of `black_block_1` and `brown_block_1` should be on the table. At steps 6 and 8, we've ensured these conditions are met.

Constraint #6: The robot must hold `purple_block_1` at some point. At step 9, we pick up `purple_block_1`.

Constraint #7: At some point, `purple_block_2` must not be clear. At step 12, we put `yellow_block_1` on top of `purple_block_2`.

All constraints are satisfied. I believe the 15-step plan is valid and optimal.

Hmm, I think there's a faster way to accomplish the goal while meeting all the constraints. Let's consider this:

Constraint #4 requires that `orange_block_1` must not be clear at some point. This means we need to place a block on top of it.
Constraint #5 requires that before `orange_block_1` is not clear, both `purple_block_2` should be on top of `black_block_1` and `brown_block_1` should be on the table.

In the initial state, `brown_block_1` is on top of `purple_block_1`. If we unstack `white_block_1` from `yellow_block_1` and place it on `orange_block_1`, we violate constraint #5 because `brown_block_1` is not on the table.

If we first unstack everything from the tower and place `brown_block_1` on the table, then move `purple_block_2` onto `black_block_1`, then at that point, we can safely place a block on top of `orange_block_1`.

I think our 15-step plan is optimal. But let's check if there are any alternative ways to meet constraints #3 and #7 (which require either `purple_block_1` on top of `black_block_1` or `yellow_block_1` on top of `purple_block_2` and, at some point, `purple_block_2` must not be clear.

In our current plan, we meet these by placing `yellow_block_1` on top of `purple_block_2`. But if we place `purple_block_1` on top of `black_block_1`, we might save steps. Let's see:

1. `unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1`
2. `putdown white_block_1`
3. `unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1`
4. `putdown yellow_block_1`
5. `unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1`
6. `putdown brown_block_1` (satisfying part of constraint #5)
7. `pickup purple_block_2`
8. `stack purple_block_2 black_block_1` (satisfying the rest of constraint #5)
9. `pickup purple_block_1` (satisfying constraint #6)
10. `stack purple_block_1 black_block_1` (satisfying constraint #3, but wait, we already stacked `purple_block_2` on `black_block_1` at step 8, so this is not valid.)

Hmm, that doesn't work. Let's stick with the 15-step plan.

Actually, I realized we could potentially place `purple_block_1` on top of `purple_block_2` to satisfy constraint #7.  Let's try:

1. `unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1`
2. `putdown white_block_1`
3. `unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1`
4. `putdown yellow_block_1`
5. `unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1`
6. `putdown brown_block_1` (satisfying part of constraint #5)
7. `pickup purple_block_2`
8. `stack purple_block_2 black_block_1` (satisfying the rest of constraint #5)
9. `pickup purple_block_1` (satisfying constraint #6)
10. `stack purple_block_1 purple_block_2` (satisfying constraints #7)
11. `pickup white_block_1`
12. `stack white_block_1 orange_block_1` (satisfying constraint #4)
13. `unstack white_block_1 orange_block_1`
14. `putdown white_block_1`
15. `pickup orange_block_1` (satisfying the goal and constraint #1)

But wait, this still doesn't satisfy constraint #3, which requires either `purple_block_1` on top of `black_block_1` or `yellow_block_1` on top of `purple_block_2`.

I think our original 15-step plan is the best. Let me reiterate it here:

1. `unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1`
2. `putdown white_block_1`
3. `unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1`
4. `putdown yellow_block_1`
5. `unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1`
6. `putdown brown_block_1` (satisfying part of constraint #5)
7. `pickup purple_block_2`
8. `stack purple_block_2 black_block_1` (satisfying the rest of constraint #5)
9. `pickup purple_block_1` (satisfying constraint #6)
10. `stack purple_block_1 orange_block_1` (satisfying constraint #4)
11. `pickup yellow_block_1`
12. `stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2` (satisfying constraints #3 and #7)
13. `unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1`
14. `putdown purple_block_1`
15. `pickup orange_block_1` (satisfying the goal and constraint #1)

This 15-step plan is valid and I believe it's the optimal solution.

1. unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1
2. putdown white_block_1
3. unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1
5. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1
6. putdown brown_block_1
7. pickup purple_block_2
8. stack purple_block_2 black_block_1
9. pickup purple_block_1
10. stack purple_block_1 orange_block_1
11. pickup yellow_block_1
12. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2
13. unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1
14. putdown purple_block_1
15. pickup orange_block_1
