Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld problem. The goal is to have the robotic arm holding the orange_block_1. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the required actions.

First, looking at the initial setup:

- There's a stack starting with purple_block_1 on the table. On top of that is brown_block_1, then yellow_block_1, and finally white_block_1. So the stack is purple_block_1 -> brown_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 -> white_block_1. All these blocks except purple_block_1 have blocks on top except white_block_1, which is clear.

- Then there's purple_block_2, black_block_1, and orange_block_1 on the table, all clear. So orange_block_1 is on the table and clear, which is good because to pick it up, it needs to be clear and on the table.

The goal is to have the arm holding orange_block_1. Since the orange_block_1 is already on the table and clear, the simplest action should be to perform 'pickup orange_block_1'. But wait, let's check the preconditions for pickup. The block must be on the table, clear, and the arm must be empty. In the initial state, orange_block_1 is on the table and clear, and the arm is not holding anything. So why isn't the plan just one action: pickup orange_block_1? That seems too easy. Let me double-check.

Wait, the initial state says "white_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1" and "there is no block on top of white_block_1". So white_block_1 is clear. The other blocks in the stack (purple_block_1, brown_block_1, yellow_block_1) are not clear. But orange_block_1 is on the table and clear. So yes, the arm is empty. So according to the initial state, the arm can directly pick up orange_block_1. So the optimal plan is just one action: pickup orange_block_1. Is there any reason that's not possible?

Wait, let me check the problem again. The original state says "you are not holding any block". So the arm is empty. The orange_block_1 is on the table and clear. So the preconditions for pickup are met. Therefore, the optimal plan is to simply pick up the orange block. But maybe I'm missing something. Let me read the problem again to ensure there's no hidden constraint or mistake in the setup.

The problem's initial state lists all the blocks. For orange_block_1: "orange_block_1 is on the table" and "there is no block on top of orange_block_1". So it's clear. The arm is not holding anything. Therefore, the action 'pickup orange_block_1' is valid. So the plan should be just that one action. But maybe the user expects more steps? Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I misread the initial state. Let me list all the initial positions again:

- purple_block_1 is on the table. On top of it is brown_block_1. Then yellow_block_1 is on brown_block_1. Then white_block_1 is on yellow_block_1. So the stack is purple_block_1 (table) -> brown -> yellow -> white. So white is on top and clear.

Other blocks: purple_block_2, black_block_1, orange_block_1 are all on the table and clear. So yes, orange_block_1 is clear and on the table. Therefore, the arm can pick it up directly. So the optimal plan is just one action. But why would the user provide such a simple problem? Maybe to test if I can recognize that. Let me check again all the preconditions for the 'pickup' action. The block must be on the table (yes), clear (yes), and the arm is empty (yes). So yes, the action is possible. Therefore, the optimal plan is indeed just one step. No other steps needed. So the answer should be:

```
pickup orange_block_1
```

But wait, maybe there's a mistake. For example, maybe the orange_block_1 is under another block. Wait, no. The initial state explicitly states that orange_block_1 is on the table and there's nothing on top of it. So all conditions are met. Therefore, the correct plan is to pick it up directly. That's the optimal plan, as it's the shortest possible.
