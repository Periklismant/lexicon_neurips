Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to have blue_block_1 on top of purple_block_1. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy. Let me first look at the initial state and then the constraints step by step.

Initial State:
- blue_block_1 is on the table.
- black_block_1 is on the table, clear.
- blue_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1.
- red_block_1 is on blue_block_2.
- purple_block_1 is on red_block_1, and it's clear.
- grey_block_1 is on the table.
- green_block_1 is on grey_block_1, clear.
- The arm is empty.

Goal:
- blue_block_1 must be on purple_block_1.

Constraints:
1. Purple_block_1 is never on the table. So we can't put it down once it's picked up. But in the initial state, it's on red_block_1, so as long as we don't move it to the table, we're good. But maybe we need to move it? Wait, the goal is to have blue_block_1 on purple_block_1. So purple_block_1 must be under blue_block_1. But in the initial state, purple_block_1 is on red_block_1, which is on blue_block_2, on blue_block_1. So purple is in a stack. To put blue_block_1 on purple, we need to move purple to a position where it's under blue_block_1. Wait, but blue_block_1 is currently under blue_block_2. So maybe we have to unstack all the blocks above blue_block_1 first.

Wait, let's see. The initial stack is blue_block_1 (on table) with blue_block_2 on top, then red_block_1, then purple_block_1. So the tower is blue_block_1 -> blue_block_2 -> red_block_1 -> purple_block_1. And purple is clear. Then, grey_block_1 is on the table with green_block_1 on top. Black_block_1 is alone on the table.

So the goal is to get blue_block_1 onto purple_block_1. That means purple_block_1 must be somewhere so blue_block_1 can be placed on it. But purple is currently on red_block_1. So maybe we need to move purple_block_1 to a position where it's on a block that's on the table, but the constraint says purple_block_1 can't be on the table. So purple must be on another block. But the goal is blue_block_1 on purple, so purple must be under blue_block_1. Wait, no—wait, the goal is blue_block_1 on purple. So purple is under blue_block_1. So purple needs to be on some block, and then blue_block_1 is stacked on top of it.

But in the initial state, purple is on red. So maybe we can move purple to a different block. But we can't put it on the table because of constraint 1. So purple must be on another block. Let's think.

First, let's look at all the constraints:

Constraints:
1. Purple_block_1 is not on the table in any state. So it must always be on top of another block. So any action that would put it on the table is forbidden.

2. At least one state where the arm is holding purple_block_1.

3. If the arm is holding purple_block_1 in some state, then black_block_1 must not be on the table either in that state or a later one.

4. At least one state where blue_block_1 is on green_block_1. But this is temporary, as the goal doesn't require that.

5. Blue_block_2 is never on the table. So blue_block_2 must always be on another block.

6. At least one state where blue_block_1 is clear (no blocks on top of it).

7. If blue_block_1 is clear in some state, there must be an earlier state where grey_block_1 is on blue_block_2.

So, let's break down the constraints.

First, we need to have blue_block_1 on purple_block_1. To do that, we need to have purple_block_1 somewhere, not on the table. Since purple is currently on red_block_1, perhaps we can move purple to another block. But the goal requires blue_block_1 on purple, so purple must be in a position where we can stack blue_block_1 on it. But blue_block_1 is currently on the table with a stack on top. So first, we need to clear blue_block_1 by removing all blocks above it (blue_block_2, red_block_1, purple_block_1).

But wait, the initial stack is blue_block_1 (table) -> blue_block_2 -> red_block_1 -> purple_block_1. So to clear blue_block_1, we need to unstack blue_block_2 from it. But blue_block_2 is under red and purple. So perhaps we need to unstack purple, then red, then blue_block_2, but that's a long process.

Alternatively, maybe we can move the entire stack. But since the goal is to have blue_block_1 on purple, perhaps we need to move purple to a position where we can stack blue_block_1 on it.

Let me think about the steps needed.

First, to get blue_block_1 on purple_block_1, the arm must pick up blue_block_1 and stack it on purple. But blue_block_1 is currently on the table with blue_block_2 on top. So to pick up blue_block_1, it must be clear. Therefore, we need to remove blue_block_2 from blue_block_1. But blue_block_2 is under red and purple. So first, we need to unstack purple from red, then red from blue_block_2, then blue_block_2 from blue_block_1. Then we can pick up blue_block_1 and stack it on purple.

But where would we put purple? Because the constraint says that purple can't be on the table. So after unstacking purple from red, we need to place it on another block. Let's see:

Current blocks on the table: blue_block_1 (with stack), black_block_1, grey_block_1 (with green on top). So maybe we can stack purple on black_block_1 or grey_block_1 or green_block_1. But let's see:

If we unstack purple from red, we can then put purple on another block. But we can't put it on the table. So during the process, we need to have a place to put purple.

But also, constraint 2 says we must hold purple at least once. So when we unstack purple from red, that counts as holding it. But after that, we need to stack it somewhere. But let's see:

Unstack purple from red. Then stack purple onto another block. Let's say stack purple on black_block_1. Then black_block_1 would no longer be clear. But constraint 3 says that if we hold purple, then black_block_1 must not be on the table in that state or after. So when we hold purple, which happens when we unstack it, then in that state or later, black_block_1 must not be on the table. But black_block_1 is on the table initially. So after we stack purple on black_block_1, then black_block_1 is no longer on the table? Wait, no. Stacking on black_block_1 would make black_block_1 have a block on top, but it's still on the table. So the constraint 3 says that after holding purple, black_block_1 must not be on the table at some point. But black_block_1 is on the table in the initial state, so to satisfy this, we must have black_block_1 moved off the table either during the holding of purple or after. So maybe we need to pick up black_block_1 and put it somewhere else. But that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps stack purple on grey_block_1. But grey_block_1 has green_block_1 on top. So green is on grey. To stack purple on grey_block_1, we need to unstack green first, put it down, then stack purple on grey. But then we have to manage green again. Hmm.

Alternatively, stack purple on green_block_1. But green is on grey. So we could stack purple on green. But then, green is under purple. But then, when we need to place blue_block_1 on purple, that's possible.

Wait, but the goal is blue_block_1 on purple. So if we have purple on green, then blue_block_1 can be stacked on purple. That would satisfy the goal. But let's check if that's possible.

But first, the steps:

1. Unstack purple from red. So unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1. Since purple is clear, we can do that. Then, the arm holds purple.

This satisfies constraint 2 (holding purple). Now, constraint 3 says that in the state where we hold purple, or after, black_block_1 must not be on the table. So we need to ensure that after this action, at some point, black_block_1 is not on the table. So perhaps after stacking purple, we need to move black_block_1. But how?

But let's proceed. After unstacking purple, we need to stack it somewhere. Let's choose to stack it on black_block_1. So stack purple black_block_1. Now, black_block_1 is under purple. But black_block_1 is still on the table. Wait, no—stacking purple on black_block_1 leaves black_block_1 on the table, but now with purple on top. So black_block_1 is still on the table. Therefore, constraint 3 is not satisfied because after holding purple, black_block_1 is still on the table. So this is a problem.

Therefore, stacking purple on black_block_1 won't satisfy constraint 3. Because in the state where we hold purple (during unstack), black_block_1 is on the table. Then, after stacking, black_block_1 is still on the table. So we need to have black_block_1 not on the table at some point after holding purple. Therefore, after stacking purple on black_block_1, we need to move black_block_1. But how? Because black_block_1 is under purple. To move black_block_1, we need to first remove purple. But purple can't be put on the table. So this is a dead end.

Alternatively, stack purple on another block that's not on the table. Wait, but all blocks start on the table except those in stacks. So perhaps we need to stack purple on green_block_1. Let's see:

Green_block_1 is on grey_block_1. So to stack purple on green, first, we need to unstack green from grey. Because green is clear. So unstack green from grey, then putdown green. Then stack purple on green. But putting green on the table is allowed, but then we have to manage it again. Alternatively, stack purple on green without moving green. Wait, can we stack purple on green while green is on grey? The stack action requires that the target block (green) is clear. But green has nothing on top (it's clear), so yes. So stack purple on green. Then, green is under purple. So then, purple is on green, which is on grey.

But then, when we need to place blue_block_1 on purple, we can do that. But let's check the constraints:

After stacking purple on green, purple is not on the table, which is good. Then, when we unstack purple from red, we are holding purple, satisfying constraint 2. Then, constraint 3 requires that black_block_1 is not on the table in that state or later. So after holding purple, we need to move black_block_1. How?

We need to have black_block_1 not on the table at some point after holding purple. So perhaps, after stacking purple on green, we can pick up black_block_1 (since it's on the table and clear) and stack it somewhere. But where? For example, stack it on blue_block_1. But blue_block_1 is on the table, but in the initial state, blue_block_1 has blue_block_2 on top. Wait, no, blue_block_1 is under blue_block_2. So to stack black_block_1 on blue_block_1, we need blue_block_1 to be clear. But blue_block_1 has blue_block_2 on it. So first, we need to clear blue_block_1. Which is part of the process to get blue_block_1 free to be picked up.

Wait, but let's proceed step by step.

Let me outline possible steps:

1. Unstack purple_block_1 from red_block_1. Now holding purple. (This satisfies constraint 2.)

Now, need to stack purple somewhere. Let's choose to stack it on green_block_1 (since green is on grey and is clear).

2. Stack purple_block_1 green_block_1. Now, purple is on green. Green is on grey.

But after this, the arm is empty.

Now, we need to handle constraint 3: after holding purple, black_block_1 must not be on the table at some point. So we need to move black_block_1. But black_block_1 is on the table and clear. So we can pick it up and stack it somewhere.

3. Pickup black_block_1. Since it's on the table and clear.

4. Stack black_block_1 somewhere. Where? Maybe on grey_block_1. But grey has green and purple on top. Wait, no. Grey_block_1 has green_block_1, which has purple_block_1. So if we stack black_block_1 on grey, but grey already has a stack. Wait, no, stacking is on top of a clear block. So to stack on grey, we need to unstack green from grey first. But green is under purple. So we can't unstack green because purple is on top of it. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, stack black_block_1 on another block. Maybe on blue_block_2. Because blue_block_2 is part of the initial stack: blue_block_1 -> blue_block_2 -> red_block_1. But red_block_1 is now under purple, which we've moved. Wait, after unstacking purple from red, red_block_1 is still on blue_block_2. So the stack is blue_block_1 -> blue_block_2 -> red_block_1. So red_block_1 is clear now? Wait, after unstacking purple from red, red_block_1 would be clear. Because purple was on top. So red_block_1 is now clear. So we can stack black_block_1 on red_block_1.

So step 4: stack black_block_1 red_block_1. But red_block_1 is clear. So that's possible. Then, black_block_1 is on red_block_1, which is on blue_block_2, etc. But then, black_block_1 is not on the table anymore, satisfying constraint 3.

But this requires that after holding purple (step 1), we move black_block_1 (steps 3 and 4) so that it's no longer on the table. So constraint 3 is satisfied.

Now, after that, we need to proceed to clear blue_block_1. Because the goal is to have blue_block_1 on purple. So blue_block_1 is currently on the table, with blue_block_2 on top. To pick up blue_block_1, we need to remove blue_block_2. But blue_block_2 is under red_block_1. So first, we need to remove red_block_1.

But red_block_1 is currently under black_block_1 (if we stacked black on red). Wait, no. In step 4, we stacked black_block_1 on red_block_1. So the stack is blue_block_1 -> blue_block_2 -> red_block_1 -> black_block_1. So to unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1, but that's possible only if black is clear. But after step 4, black is on red, and nothing is on top. So we can unstack black, but that's not necessary unless we need to access red_block_1.

Alternatively, perhaps we can unstack red_block_1 from blue_block_2. But red_block_1 has black_block_1 on top. So we can't unstack red_block_1 unless black is moved first.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's see.

Alternative approach: Maybe after moving purple to green, and moving black to red, we can then proceed to disassemble the original stack.

But the original stack is blue_block_1 (table) -> blue_block_2 -> red_block_1 -> black_block_1 (from step 4). Wait, no: original stack was blue_block_1 -> blue_block_2 -> red_block_1. Then, we unstack purple from red, stack purple on green. Then, stack black on red. So red now has black on top. So the stack is blue_block_1 -> blue_block_2 -> red_block_1 -> black_block_1.

But blue_block_2 is part of this stack. Constraint 5 says blue_block_2 is never on the table. So blue_block_2 is on blue_block_1 (on table) in initial state. If we move blue_block_2, we need to keep it on another block. But since the constraint is that blue_block_2 is never on the table, any movement must keep it stacked.

But in our current steps, blue_block_2 is still under red_block_1 and black_block_1. So it's safe.

Now, to clear blue_block_1, we need to remove blue_block_2 from it. But blue_block_2 is under red and black. So we need to unstack black from red, then red from blue_block_2, then blue_block_2 from blue_block_1.

But let's see:

After step 4, black is on red. To unstack black, we can do that since black is clear.

5. Unstack black_block_1 red_block_1. Now holding black.

6. Putdown black_block_1. But wait, constraint 5 says blue_block_2 cannot be on the table, but putting down black is allowed. So putdown black. Now, black is on the table. But constraint 3 says that after holding purple (step 1), black must not be on the table at some point. But in step 4, we stacked black on red (so it's not on the table). Then in step 5, we unstacked it and put it back on the table. So now, black is on the table again, which violates constraint 3, because after holding purple (step 1), there must be a state where black is not on the table. But if we put it back, then constraint 3 is not satisfied. So this approach is wrong.

Alternative: Instead of putting black on the table, stack it somewhere else. But where?

After step 5, we are holding black. We need to stack it on another block. For example, stack it on grey_block_1. But grey has green and purple on top. So can't stack on grey. Stack on green? No, green has purple. Stack on purple? No, purple is on green. Alternatively, stack on blue_block_2. But blue_block_2 is under red. So maybe stack on red_block_1 again? But that would just put black back where it was. Not helpful.

Alternatively, stack black on blue_block_1. But blue_block_1 has blue_block_2 on top. So need to unstack blue_block_2 first. But blue_block_2 is under red and black. Hmm. This is getting too tangled.

Maybe a different approach is needed. Let's think again about the constraints and the goal.

Goal: blue_block_1 on purple_block_1.

Constraints:

- Purple is never on the table. So purple must stay on blocks.

- Must hold purple at least once (done by unstacking from red).

- If held purple, then black must be not on the table at some point after.

- At least one state with blue_block_1 on green_block_1.

- Blue_block_2 never on table.

- At least one state where blue_block_1 is clear.

- If blue_block_1 is clear, then there was an earlier state where grey_block_1 is on blue_block_2.

Also, in the initial state, blue_block_1 has blue_block_2 on top. So to make blue_block_1 clear, we need to remove blue_block_2. But blue_block_2 is under red and purple. So first, unstack purple from red, then unstack red from blue_block_2, then unstack blue_block_2 from blue_block_1. Then blue_block_1 is clear. But when we do that, we need to satisfy constraint 7: that when blue_block_1 is clear, there was an earlier state where grey is on blue_block_2.

But grey is currently on the table with green on top. So how can grey be on blue_block_2? We need to stack grey on blue_block_2 at some point before blue_block_1 is clear.

So, steps to satisfy constraint 7:

At some point before blue_block_1 becomes clear, stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2.

But grey is on the table with green on top. To stack grey on blue_block_2, we need to first clear blue_block_2 (which is under red and purple), but that's not possible unless we remove the blocks above.

Alternatively, perhaps unstack green from grey, then stack grey on blue_block_2, but blue_block_2 is under red and purple. Wait, but blue_block_2 is in the stack: blue_block_1 -> blue_block_2 -> red_block_1 -> purple_block_1. So to stack grey on blue_block_2, we need to clear blue_block_2. But blue_block_2 has red and purple on top. So we need to first remove those. So this seems complicated.

Alternative plan:

Perhaps after moving purple to green, then moving red and blue_block_2 to other places, then stack grey on blue_block_2.

But this requires a lot of steps.

Alternatively, maybe stack grey on blue_block_2 before clearing blue_block_1. But how?

Let me outline a possible sequence of actions:

1. Unstack purple_block_1 from red_block_1. Now holding purple. (Satisfies constraint 2.)

2. Stack purple_block_1 on green_block_1. Now, purple is on green, which is on grey.

3. Pickup black_block_1 (since it's on table and clear). (Now holding black.)

4. Stack black_block_1 on purple_block_1. (But purple is on green, so stacking black on purple would require that purple is clear. But after step 2, purple is on green and is clear (since we stacked it there). Wait, no: after stacking purple on green, the stack is green_block_1 (on grey) -> purple_block_1. So purple is on green. So purple is clear? No, after stacking, the effect is that purple is on green, and purple is clear. Because stacking x on y makes x clear. So yes, after step 2, purple is clear. So stacking black on purple is allowed.

So step 4: stack black_block_1 purple_block_1. Now, black is on purple, which is on green. This way, black is not on the table anymore, satisfying constraint 3 (after holding purple, black is not on the table in some state after).

Now, we've satisfied constraint 3.

Next, we need to clear blue_block_1. To do that, we need to remove blue_block_2 from it. But blue_block_2 is under red_block_1. So we need to unstack red from blue_block_2. But red is currently under purple (no, wait: after step 1, we unstacked purple from red, so red is now on blue_block_2, clear. So red_block_1 is clear. So we can unstack red from blue_block_2.

5. Unstack red_block_1 from blue_block_2. Now holding red.

6. Stack red_block_1 somewhere. Since we need to keep blue_block_2 not on the table, perhaps stack red on another block. For example, stack red on grey_block_1. But grey has green -> purple -> black. So grey is under green. To stack red on grey, we need to unstack green from grey first. Which would require unstacking purple and black. That's complicated.

Alternatively, stack red on black_block_1. But black is on purple, so we can stack red on black. But black is clear? After step 4, black is on purple, which is clear. So yes, black is clear. So:

6. Stack red_block_1 black_block_1. Now, red is on black, which is on purple, etc.

Now, blue_block_2 is clear, so we can unstack it from blue_block_1.

7. Unstack blue_block_2 from blue_block_1. Now holding blue_block_2.

Constraint 5 says blue_block_2 can't be on the table. So we must stack it somewhere.

8. Stack blue_block_2 on another block. Let's choose grey_block_1. But grey has green, purple, black, red. So to stack on grey, need to unstack green. Hmm. Alternatively, stack blue_block_2 on red_block_1. Red is on black, which is on purple. So:

8. Stack blue_block_2 red_block_1. But red is on black. So blue_block_2 would be on top of red. Now, blue_block_2 is stacked, which is okay.

Now, blue_block_1 is clear. This satisfies constraint 6 (at least one state where blue_block_1 is clear). But according to constraint 7, before this, there must be a state where grey is on blue_block_2. But we haven't done that yet. So we need to arrange for grey to be on blue_block_2 before blue_block_1 becomes clear.

But in the current steps, after step 8, blue_block_1 is clear. So we need to have grey on blue_block_2 before step 7 (unstacking blue_block_2 from blue_block_1).

So let's adjust the plan.

Before step 7 (unstack blue_block_2), we need to have grey on blue_block_2.

Wait, but blue_block_2 is currently under red. So after step 5, we unstack red from blue_block_2. Then, blue_block_2 is clear. Then, in step 8, we stacked blue_block_2 on red. But perhaps instead, after unstacking red from blue_block_2, stack grey on blue_block_2.

But how?

After step 5: unstack red from blue_block_2. Now holding red. Then, instead of stacking red on black (step 6), maybe put red down. But blue_block_2 is clear. Then, we can stack grey on blue_block_2.

But grey is on the table with green on top. So to stack grey on blue_block_2, we need to unstack green from grey first.

Let's adjust steps:

5. Unstack red_block_1 from blue_block_2. Now holding red.

6. Putdown red_block_1. Now red is on the table. But this is allowed.

But then blue_block_2 is clear. Now, need to stack grey on blue_block_2.

But grey is on the table with green on top. So:

7. Unstack green_block_1 from grey_block_1. Now holding green.

8. Putdown green_block_1. Now green is on the table.

9. Pickup grey_block_1. Now holding grey.

10. Stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2. Now grey is on blue_block_2. This satisfies constraint 7's requirement for an earlier state where grey is on blue_block_2 before blue_block_1 is clear.

Then proceed:

11. Unstack blue_block_2 from blue_block_1. But wait, after step 10, blue_block_2 has grey on top. So we can't unstack blue_block_2 unless it's clear. So this approach doesn't work.

Ah, right. So if we stack grey on blue_block_2, then blue_block_2 is no longer clear. So we can't unstack it. Therefore, this approach won't work.

Alternative idea: To stack grey on blue_block_2 before unstacking blue_block_2 from blue_block_1. But blue_block_2 is under red and purple. So to stack grey on blue_block_2, we need to clear blue_block_2 first. Which requires removing red and purple.

But that's the original problem. This seems like a loop.

Alternative approach: Perhaps we can stack grey on blue_block_2 after removing purple and red.

Let me try to outline steps again, keeping in mind all constraints.

1. Unstack purple_block_1 from red_block_1. (Hold purple; satisfies constraint 2.)

2. Stack purple_block_1 on green_block_1. (Purple on green, which is on grey.)

3. Pickup black_block_1. (To satisfy constraint 3, move black off table.)

4. Stack black_block_1 on purple_block_1. (Black is not on table anymore.)

Now, need to handle red_block_1 and blue_block_2.

5. Unstack red_block_1 from blue_block_2. (Now holding red.)

6. Stack red_block_1 on black_block_1. (Red on black, which is on purple.)

Now, blue_block_2 is clear. 

7. Now, to satisfy constraint 7: before blue_block_1 becomes clear, grey must be on blue_block_2. So we need to stack grey on blue_block_2.

But grey is on the table with green and purple and black and red on top. Wait, no: grey is on the table with green, and purple is on green. So to stack grey on blue_block_2, we need to unstack green from grey. But green has purple on top. So we need to unstack purple first.

But purple is on green, and we can't put it on the table. So:

8. Unstack black_block_1 from purple_block_1. (Now holding black.)

9. Stack black_block_1 somewhere else, like on red_block_1. But red is on black. Wait, this is getting too complex.

Alternatively, after step 7 (blue_block_2 is clear), unstack green from grey, but green has purple on top. So to unstack green, need to unstack purple first.

But purple is on green, so unstack purple from green.

But step 2 stacked purple on green. So:

8. Unstack purple_block_1 from green_block_1. (Now holding purple.)

But we need to stack purple somewhere else. Can't put it on table. So stack on another block, say, black_block_1.

But black is on purple (from step 4). Wait, no: after step 4, black is stacked on purple, which is on green. So after unstacking purple from green (step 8?), we can stack purple on black.

Wait, perhaps after step 4:

- green is on grey.

- purple is on green.

- black is on purple.

- red is on blue_block_2.

Wait, no. Let's retrace:

After step 4:

- purple is on green (grey -> green -> purple).

- black is on purple (stacked in step 4).

- red is on blue_block_2 (stacked in step 6? No, step 6 was stacking red on black. Wait, after step 5: unstack red from blue_block_2 (holding red). Step 6: stack red on black_block_1. So red is on black, which is on purple, which is on green, which is on grey. So the stack is grey -> green -> purple -> black -> red.

So after step 6, blue_block_2 is clear (since red was unstacked from it). So blue_block_2 is on blue_block_1, clear.

Now, step 7: we need to stack grey on blue_block_2. But grey is under green. So first, we need to unstack green from grey. But green is under purple. So we need to unstack purple, black, red, etc. This is getting too complicated.

Alternative idea: Perhaps stack grey on blue_block_2 before moving purple.

But initially, grey is on the table with green on top. So to stack grey on blue_block_2, we need to unstack green from grey first.

1. Unstack green_block_1 from grey_block_1. Now holding green.

2. Putdown green_block_1. Now green is on the table.

3. Pickup grey_block_1. Now holding grey.

4. Stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2. Now grey is on blue_block_2. This satisfies constraint 7's requirement.

But now, blue_block_2 is under grey. Then, the original stack is blue_block_1 -> blue_block_2 -> grey. Then, blue_block_2 has grey on top, but in the initial state, blue_block_2 has red and purple on top. So this changes the initial stack, which is not possible unless we adjust all steps.

But this approach may help satisfy constraint 7. But then, the initial stack is modified early on, which may complicate other steps.

But let's proceed.

After stacking grey on blue_block_2:

Now, blue_block_2 is under grey. So to clear blue_block_1, we need to remove grey and blue_block_2. But this complicates the process.

Alternatively, perhaps after stacking grey on blue_block_2, we can then proceed to unstack the rest.

But this is getting too involved. Perhaps there's a better way.

Let me try to consider the minimal steps needed to achieve the goal while satisfying all constraints.

The goal is blue_block_1 on purple_block_1.

To achieve this:

1. Clear blue_block_1 by removing blue_block_2, red, purple.

2. Move purple to a position where it's under blue_block_1.

But purple can't be on the table. So purple must be on another block. Let's stack purple on green_block_1.

Then, stack blue_block_1 on purple.

But before that, need to clear blue_block_1.

Steps:

- Unstack purple from red (hold purple).

- Stack purple on green.

- Unstack red from blue_block_2.

- Unstack blue_block_2 from blue_block_1.

- Pickup blue_block_1 and stack on purple.

But need to handle all constraints.

Also, during this, we need to:

- Hold purple once (done).

- Ensure black is not on the table after holding purple. So after unstacking purple, we need to move black.

But black is initially on the table. So perhaps after unstacking purple, we can stack it on green, then move black.

Wait, let's try:

1. Unstack purple_block_1 from red_block_1. (Holding purple; constraint 2 satisfied.)

2. Stack purple_block_1 on green_block_1. (Purple is on green.)

3. Pickup black_block_1. (Now holding black.)

4. Stack black_block_1 on purple_block_1. (Black is not on the table; constraint 3 satisfied.)

Now, black is on purple, green, grey.

5. Unstack red_block_1 from blue_block_2. (Holding red.)

6. Stack red_block_1 on black_block_1. (Red is on black.)

7. Unstack blue_block_2 from blue_block_1. (Holding blue_block_2; blue_block_1 is clear. This satisfies constraint 6. But constraint 7 requires that before this, grey was on blue_block_2. Which hasn't happened yet. So we need to adjust.)

Ah, here's the problem. At step 7, blue_block_1 becomes clear, but there's no earlier state where grey is on blue_block_2. So this violates constraint 7.

Therefore, we need to ensure that before step 7, we stack grey on blue_block_2.

But how? At this point, blue_block_2 is under red and black.

Wait, after step 6, red is on black, which is on purple, which is on green, which is on grey. So the stack for blue_block_2 is blue_block_1 -> blue_block_2. But after step 6, blue_block_2 is clear (since red was moved to black). So perhaps we can stack grey on blue_block_2.

But grey is currently under green. So:

7. Unstack green_block_1 from grey_block_1. (Need to unstack purple first, since green has purple on top.)

But purple is on green, so:

7. Unstack black_block_1 from purple_block_1. (Holding black.)

8. Unstack purple_block_1 from green_block_1. (Holding purple.)

9. Putdown purple_block_1. Can't, because constraint 1 says purple can't be on the table. So stack purple somewhere else.

9. Stack purple_block_1 on blue_block_2. But blue_block_2 is clear now.

Then:

10. Stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2. Now grey is on blue_block_2. This satisfies constraint 7.

But then, we need to unstack blue_block_2 from blue_block_1. But blue_block_2 has grey on top. So we can't unstack unless grey is removed.

This is getting too long and complicated. I think I need to find a different strategy.

Alternative approach: Use the fact that the goal requires blue_block_1 on purple. So purple must be on a block, and blue_block_1 must be on top of it. To get blue_block_1 there, we need to pick it up from the table (once clear) and stack it on purple.

But first, clear blue_block_1 by removing the stack above it. Then, move purple to a position where it's on a block, then stack blue_block_1 on it.

But during this process, satisfy all constraints.

Let's try:

1. Unstack purple from red. Now holding purple. (constraint 2)

2. Stack purple on green. (constraint 1: purple not on table)

3. Pickup black_block_1. (to move it off table)

4. Stack black_block_1 on purple. (constraint 3: black not on table after holding purple)

Now, black is on purple, which is on green, which is on grey.

5. Unstack red from blue_block_2. Now holding red.

6. Stack red on black. Now, blue_block_2 is clear.

7. Now, need to stack grey on blue_block_2 to satisfy constraint 7.

But grey is under green, which has purple and black and red. So to stack grey on blue_block_2:

7. Unstack green_block_1 from grey_block_1. But green has purple on top. So need to unstack purple first.

8. Unstack black_block_1 from purple_block_1. Holding black.

9. Unstack purple_block_1 from green_block_1. Holding purple.

10. Stack purple_block_1 on blue_block_2. Now purple is on blue_block_2.

11. Stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2. Now grey is on blue_block_2, satisfying constraint 7.

12. Now, unstack blue_block_2 from blue_block_1. But blue_block_2 has grey on top. So can't unstack. So need to unstack grey first.

13. Unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_2. Holding grey.

14. Putdown grey_block_1. Now grey is on table.

15. Unstack blue_block_2 from blue_block_1. Now holding blue_block_2. Can't putdown due to constraint 5.

16. Stack blue_block_2 on grey_block_1. Now blue_block_2 is on grey.

Now, blue_block_1 is clear. (constraint 6) And earlier, step 11 stacked grey on blue_block_2, satisfying constraint 7.

Then:

17. Pickup blue_block_1. Now holding it.

18. Stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_1. Which is on blue_block_2. But purple is on blue_block_2 from step 10. So stacking blue_block_1 on purple achieves the goal.

But wait, the goal is blue_block_1 on purple_block_1. In step 10, purple is on blue_block_2. So stacking blue_block_1 on purple would result in blue_block_1 on purple, which is on blue_block_2. But the goal doesn't specify where purple should be, as long as blue_block_1 is on top of it. So this satisfies the goal.

But also, we need to satisfy constraint 4: at least one state where blue_block_1 is on green_block_1. So during the process, we need to have blue_block_1 on green at some point.

Ah, right. So the current plan doesn't include that. So we need to adjust.

Perhaps after step 17, before stacking blue_block_1 on purple, we can stack it on green_block_1 first, then move it to purple.

But that adds steps. Let's see:

After step 17, holding blue_block_1.

17. Stack blue_block_1 on green_block_1. Now blue_block_1 is on green, satisfying constraint 4.

18. Unstack blue_block_1 from green_block_1. Now holding it again.

19. Stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_1. Now goal achieved.

But this adds two more steps. But the plan needs to be optimal (shortest possible). So maybe there's a way to combine.

Alternatively, during the process of moving purple, we can have blue_block_1 on green_block_1.

But how?

Alternatively, after step 2 (purple on green), perhaps stack blue_block_1 on green, then move it to purple. But blue_block_1 is under blue_block_2 in the initial state. So need to clear it first.

But this seems impossible without a lot of steps.

Alternatively, after clearing blue_block_1 (step 15), before stacking it on purple, stack it on green_block_1, then unstack and stack on purple.

So steps:

17. Pickup blue_block_1.

18. Stack blue_block_1 on green_block_1. (satisfies constraint 4)

19. Unstack blue_block_1 from green_block_1.

20. Stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_1.

This adds three steps. But the optimal plan needs to be as short as possible.

Is there a way to satisfy constraint 4 without extra steps?

Wait, constraint 4 requires that in at least one state, blue_block_1 is on green_block_1. This can be temporary. So perhaps during the process of moving blue_block_1 to purple, we can pass through green_block_1.

For example, after unstacking blue_block_1, stack it on green, then stack it on purple.

But that's two additional steps. But maybe there's a way to have blue_block_1 on green_block_1 as part of the main plan.

Alternatively, if we stack blue_block_1 on green_block_1 first, then move it to purple. But the initial position of blue_block_1 has a stack on top. So we need to clear it first.

This is getting very complex. I think the optimal plan would require at least 12 steps, but I'm not sure. Let's try to outline the plan step by step, ensuring all constraints are met.

Final Plan Outline:

1. Unstack purple_block_1 from red_block_1. (Hold purple; satisfies constraint 2.)

2. Stack purple_block_1 on green_block_1. (Purple not on table.)

3. Pickup black_block_1. (To move it off table.)

4. Stack black_block_1 on purple_block_1. (Black not on table; satisfies constraint 3.)

5. Unstack red_block_1 from blue_block_2. (Holding red.)

6. Stack red_block_1 on black_block_1. (Red on black.)

7. Unstack green_block_1 from grey_block_1. (Holding green; needed to stack grey on blue_block_2.)

8. Putdown green_block_1. (Green on table.)

9. Pickup grey_block_1. (Holding grey.)

10. Stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2. (Satisfies constraint 7's prerequisite.)

11. Unstack blue_block_2 from blue_block_1. (Holding blue_block_2; blue_block_1 is clear; satisfies constraint 6.)

12. Stack blue_block_2 on grey_block_1. (To keep blue_block_2 off table.)

13. Pickup blue_block_1. (Holding it.)

14. Stack blue_block_1 on green_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 4.)

15. Unstack blue_block_1 from green_block_1. (Holding it again.)

16. Stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_1. (Goal achieved.)

But this is 16 steps. However, some steps might be redundant. For example, steps 7-10 could be optimized.

Alternative Plan:

After step 6 (red stacked on black), blue_block_2 is clear.

7. Unstack green_block_1 from grey_block_1. (Holding green.)

8. Stack green_block_1 on blue_block_2. (Now green is on blue_block_2. This allows grey to be picked up.)

9. Pickup grey_block_1. (Holding grey.)

10. Stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2. (Now blue_block_2 has green and grey. Wait, no, you can't stack on blue_block_2 unless it's clear. Because when you stack, the target block must be clear. So after step 8, blue_block_2 has green on top. So step 10 can't stack grey on blue_block_2. So this approach is wrong.

Alternative Idea:

After step 6, blue_block_2 is clear. So we can stack grey on blue_block_2.

7. Unstack green_block_1 from grey_block_1. (Holding green.)

8. Stack green_block_1 on blue_block_2. (Now blue_block_2 has green.)

9. Pickup grey_block_1. (Holding grey.)

10. Stack grey_block_1 on green_block_1. (Now grey is on green, which is on blue_block_2.)

This allows grey to be on blue_block_2 (via green). But this might satisfy constraint 7, which requires grey to be on blue_block_2. But technically, grey is on green, which is on blue_block_2. So does that count as grey being on blue_block_2? The problem says "grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2". So no, it's not directly on top. So this doesn't satisfy constraint 7.

Therefore, the correct approach is to stack grey directly on blue_block_2.

But blue_block_2 must be clear to stack grey on it. So after step 6, blue_block_2 is clear (red is moved). So steps:

7. Unstack green_block_1 from grey_block_1. (Holding green.)

8. Putdown green_block_1. (On table.)

9. Pickup grey_block_1. (Holding grey.)

10. Stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2. (Now grey is on blue_block_2; satisfies constraint 7.)

11. Unstack blue_block_2 from blue_block_1. (Holding blue_block_2; blue_block_1 is clear.)

12. Stack blue_block_2 on grey_block_1. (Now blue_block_2 is on grey, which is on blue_block_2. Wait, no. Blue_block_2 is being stacked on grey, which is on blue_block_2. This creates a loop. Not allowed.)

Wait, after step 10: blue_block_2 is on blue_block_1, with grey on top. So blue_block_2 has grey. To unstack blue_block_2 from blue_block_1, we need to remove grey first.

13. Unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_2. (Holding grey.)

14. Putdown grey_block_1. (On table.)

15. Unstack blue_block_2 from blue_block_1. (Holding blue_block_2.)

16. Stack blue_block_2 on grey_block_1. (Now blue_block_2 is on grey.)

Now, blue_block_1 is clear. Then:

17. Pickup blue_block_1. (Holding it.)

18. Stack blue_block_1 on green_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 4.)

19. Unstack blue_block_1 from green_block_1. (Holding it.)

20. Stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_1. (Goal.)

This is way too long. I think there's a more optimal path.

Perhaps after step 10 (grey on blue_block_2), we can unstack blue_block_2 from blue_block_1, but since grey is on blue_block_2, we can't. So need to first unstack grey.

So steps 11-14:

11. Unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_2. (Holding grey.)

12. Putdown grey_block_1. (On table.)

13. Unstack blue_block_2 from blue_block_1. (Holding blue_block_2.)

14. Stack blue_block_2 on grey_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 5.)

Now, blue_block_1 is clear.

15. Pickup blue_block_1. (Holding it.)

16. Stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_1. (Goal.)

But this skips constraint 4 (blue_block_1 on green). So need to insert steps to satisfy that.

After step 15:

15. Pickup blue_block_1.

16. Stack blue_block_1 on green_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 4.)

17. Unstack blue_block_1 from green_block_1.

18. Stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_1.

Now, the plan has 18 steps, which is probably not optimal.

But perhaps there's a way to stack blue_block_1 on green during the process. For example, after step 2 (purple on green), we can stack blue_block_1 on green, but blue_block_1 is under a stack. So no.

This is really challenging. Perhaps the optimal plan requires moving blue_block_1 to green and then to purple, but I'm not sure. Given the time constraints, I'll try to draft a plan that covers all the constraints, even if it's longer than possible.

Final Plan:

```
```
unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1
stack purple_block_1 green_block_1
pickup black_block_1
stack black_block_1 purple_block_1
unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2
stack red_block_1 black_block_1
unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1
putdown green_block_1
pickup grey_block_1
stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2
unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_2
putdown grey_block_1
unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1
stack blue_block_2 grey_block_1
pickup blue_block_1
stack blue_block_1 green_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 green_block_1
stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1
```
```

But I'm not confident this satisfies all constraints. For example, constraint 4 requires blue_block_1 on green_block_1, which is done in step 15. Constraint 7: when blue_block_1 is cleared (step 13), there was an earlier state where grey was on blue_block_2 (step 10). Constraint 3: after holding purple (step 1), black is stacked on purple (step 4), so black is not on the table. Constraint 1: purple is never on the table. Constraint 5: blue_block_2 is always stacked. Constraint 6: blue_block_1 is cleared in step 13. 

This plan has 18 steps, but perhaps it's possible to shorten it. For instance, combining some steps or finding a more optimal order. However, given the complexity, this might be the best possible. But I'm not sure. Another approach could be to stack blue_block_1 on green_block_1 temporarily while moving purple, but I'm not sure. I'll proceed with this plan.
