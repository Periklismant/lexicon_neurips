Let me think through this problem step by step by figuring out the initial state, the goal, the constraints, and then figuring out a plan.

Initial state:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
- red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- green_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- black_block_1 is clear
- purple_block_1 is clear
- green_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

So the initial configuration looks like this:
```
    purple_block_1     green_block_1     black_block_1
          |                 |
      red_block_1      grey_block_1
          |
      blue_block_2
          |
      blue_block_1
```

Goal:
- blue_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1

Constraints:
1. purple_block_1 is never on the table
2. You must hold purple_block_1 at least once
3. If you hold purple_block_1, then black_block_1 must not be on the table at that point or afterwards
4. blue_block_1 must be on top of green_block_1 at least once
5. blue_block_2 is never on the table
6. blue_block_1 must be clear at least once
7. If blue_block_1 is clear, there must be an earlier state where grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2

Let's think about how to approach this. Given the goal and constraints, we need to:
1. Ensure purple_block_1 is never on the table, which means we need to place it somewhere else after holding it
2. Hold purple_block_1 at some point
3. When we hold purple_block_1, ensure black_block_1 is not on the table (which means we need to pick it up first)
4. Place blue_block_1 on top of green_block_1 at some point
5. Keep blue_block_2 off the table throughout
6. Make blue_block_1 clear at some point
7. Before making blue_block_1 clear, ensure grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2

Let's build a plan:

First, to satisfy constraint 6, we need to make blue_block_1 clear, which means removing blue_block_2 from it. But we also need to satisfy constraint 7, which means we need to have grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2 before blue_block_1 becomes clear.

So, to start with, we need to rearrange the blocks to get grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2.

Currently, the stack on blue_block_1 is:
blue_block_1 -> blue_block_2 -> red_block_1 -> purple_block_1

And grey_block_1 has green_block_1 on top of it.

To get grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2, we first need to:
1. Remove purple_block_1 from the top of red_block_1
2. Remove red_block_1 from the top of blue_block_2
3. Remove green_block_1 from the top of grey_block_1
4. Place grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2

Let's plan that out with actual actions:

1. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1
2. (now we're holding purple_block_1, but we can't put it on the table due to constraint 1)
   - We also need to satisfy constraint 3: "If you are holding purple_block_1, then black_block_1 is not on the table at that point or afterwards."
   - So before this step, we need to pick up black_block_1 and place it somewhere.

Let's revise the plan:

1. pickup black_block_1 (since it's clear and on the table)
2. stack black_block_1 green_block_1 (green_block_1 is clear)
3. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1 (now we're holding purple_block_1, and black_block_1 is not on the table)
   - Now we need to place purple_block_1 somewhere, but not on the table.
4. stack purple_block_1 black_block_1 (black_block_1 is now clear)
5. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2
6. stack red_block_1 purple_block_1
7. unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1
8. stack green_block_1 red_block_1
9. pickup grey_block_1
10. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2 (now grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2, satisfying requirement for constraint 7)

Now we can start working on making blue_block_1 clear:

11. unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1 (now blue_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint 6, and we have grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2 earlier, satisfying constraint 7)

Now we need to place blue_block_1 on top of green_block_1 at some point (constraint 4):

12. pickup blue_block_1
13. stack blue_block_1 green_block_1 (now blue_block_1 is on top of green_block_1, satisfying constraint 4)

Oh wait, I think I made a mistake. We can't just "unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1" directly since blue_block_2 has grey_block_1 on top of it. Let me revise the plan:

1. pickup black_block_1 (since it's clear and on the table)
2. stack black_block_1 green_block_1 (green_block_1 is clear)
3. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1 (now we're holding purple_block_1, and black_block_1 is not on the table)
4. stack purple_block_1 black_block_1 (black_block_1 is now clear)
5. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2
6. stack red_block_1 purple_block_1
7. unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1
8. stack green_block_1 red_block_1
9. pickup grey_block_1
10. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2 (now grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2, satisfying requirement for constraint 7)

Let's reconsider how we're going to clear blue_block_1. We need to remove the stack on top of it, which now has grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2.

11. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_2
12. stack grey_block_1 green_block_1
13. unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1 (now blue_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint 6, and we had grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2 earlier, satisfying constraint 7)

Now we need to place blue_block_1 on top of green_block_1 at some point (constraint 4):

14. pickup blue_block_1
15. stack blue_block_1 grey_block_1 (now blue_block_1 is able to be stacked somewhere, but not green_block_1 yet)

Actually, I think a more direct path to the goal is to place blue_block_1 on top of purple_block_1, but we also need to satisfy constraint 4 (blue_block_1 on top of green_block_1 at some point).

Let's try a different approach. Let's figure out a chain of actions that satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal.

Constraints to consider:
1. purple_block_1 is never on the table
2. You must hold purple_block_1 at least once
3. If you hold purple_block_1, then black_block_1 must not be on the table at that point or afterwards
4. blue_block_1 must be on top of green_block_1 at least once
5. blue_block_2 is never on the table
6. blue_block_1 must be clear at least once
7. If blue_block_1 is clear, there must be an earlier state where grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2

Initial configuration:
```
    purple_block_1     green_block_1     black_block_1
          |                 |
      red_block_1      grey_block_1
          |
      blue_block_2
          |
      blue_block_1
```

Let's first try to set up the prerequisite for constraint 7: we need grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2.

To start, we need to:
1. Pick up black_block_1 to satisfy constraint 3 (before we hold purple_block_1)
2. Place black_block_1 somewhere
3. Remove purple_block_1 from red_block_1
4. Place purple_block_1 somewhere (not on the table)
5. Remove red_block_1 from blue_block_2
6. Place red_block_1 somewhere
7. Remove green_block_1 from grey_block_1
8. Place green_block_1 somewhere
9. Pick up grey_block_1
10. Place grey_block_1 on blue_block_2

After these steps, we satisfy the prerequisite for constraint 7. Then we need to:
11. Remove grey_block_1 from blue_block_2
12. Place grey_block_1 somewhere
13. Remove blue_block_2 from blue_block_1 (now blue_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint 6)
14. Place blue_block_2 somewhere (not on the table, to satisfy constraint 5)
15. Pick up blue_block_1
16. Place blue_block_1 on green_block_1 (satisfying constraint 4)
17. Remove blue_block_1 from green_block_1
18. Place blue_block_1 on purple_block_1 (achieving the goal)

Let's implement this plan with specific actions:

1. pickup black_block_1
2. stack black_block_1 green_block_1
3. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1 (now holding purple_block_1, and black_block_1 is not on the table, satisfying constraint 3)
4. stack purple_block_1 black_block_1
5. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2
6. stack red_block_1 purple_block_1
7. unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1
8. stack green_block_1 red_block_1
9. pickup grey_block_1
10. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2 (satisfying prerequisite for constraint 7)
11. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_2
12. stack grey_block_1 green_block_1
13. unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1 (now blue_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint 6)
14. stack blue_block_2 grey_block_1
15. pickup blue_block_1
16. stack blue_block_1 green_block_1 (satisfying constraint 4)
17. unstack blue_block_1 green_block_1
18. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1 (achieving the goal)

Actually, let's check if our plan violates the constraint about blue_block_1 being clear (constraint 6 and 7). The constraint says that if blue_block_1 is clear, there must have been an earlier state where grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2. We've satisfied that by placing grey_block_1 on blue_block_2 in step 10, before blue_block_1 becomes clear in step 13.

Let's actually recheck this plan from scratch to make sure it's all correct and optimal.

OK let me redo all of this to make sure I'm not making any mistakes. Let me list out all the actions I need to take, and then check the constraints to make sure they're all satisfied. 

Let's start by organizing this in terms of what we want to accomplish. We want to:
1. Move black_block_1 off the table (to satisfy constraint 3 before we hold purple_block_1)
2. Hold purple_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 2)
3. Put grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2 (to satisfy the requirement for constraint 7)
4. Make blue_block_1 clear (to satisfy constraint 6)
5. Place blue_block_1 on top of green_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 4)
6. Place blue_block_1 on top of purple_block_1 (to achieve the goal)
7. Ensure that throughout the plan, purple_block_1 is never on the table (constraint 1) and blue_block_2 is never on the table (constraint 5)

So the initial state is:
```
    purple_block_1     green_block_1     black_block_1
          |                 |
      red_block_1      grey_block_1
          |
      blue_block_2
          |
      blue_block_1
```

1. First, let's pick up black_block_1 to satisfy constraint 3:
   - pickup black_block_1

2. We need to place black_block_1 somewhere. Green_block_1 is clear, so:
   - stack black_block_1 green_block_1

3. Now we need to hold purple_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 2):
   - unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1 (now we're holding purple_block_1, and black_block_1 is off the table, satisfying constraint 3)

4. We need to place purple_block_1 somewhere (not on the table, to satisfy constraint 1):
   - stack purple_block_1 black_block_1

5. Now we need to get grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2 (to satisfy the requirement for constraint 7), but first we need to remove red_block_1 from blue_block_2:
   - unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2
   - stack red_block_1 purple_block_1

6. Now we need to get green_block_1 clear so we can move grey_block_1:
   - unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1
   - stack green_block_1 red_block_1

7. Now we can move grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2:
   - pickup grey_block_1
   - stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2 (satisfying the requirement for constraint 7)

8. Now we need to make blue_block_1 clear, but first we need to remove grey_block_1 from blue_block_2:
   - unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_2
   - stack grey_block_1 green_block_1

9. Now we can remove blue_block_2 from blue_block_1:
   - unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1 (now blue_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint 6)

10. We need to place blue_block_2 somewhere (not on the table, to satisfy constraint 5):
    - stack blue_block_2 grey_block_1

11. Now we can pick up blue_block_1:
    - pickup blue_block_1

12. We need to place blue_block_1 on top of green_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 4), but green_block_1 isn't clear. Let's make it clear:
    - actually, green_block_1 is under grey_block_1, which has blue_block_2 on top of it. So we need to move blue_block_2:
      - unstack blue_block_2 grey_block_1
      - stack blue_block_2 blue_block_1 (now blue_block_1 has blue_block_2 on top of it, but blue_block_1 is not clear anymore!)

Actually, I think I made an error. We're holding blue_block_1 at this point, so we can't stack blue_block_2 on it.

Let me rethink this. We have:
1. Move black_block_1 off the table (to satisfy constraint 3 before we hold purple_block_1)
2. Hold purple_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 2)
3. Put grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2 (to satisfy the requirement for constraint 7)
4. Make blue_block_1 clear (to satisfy constraint 6)
5. Place blue_block_1 on top of green_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 4)
6. Place blue_block_1 on top of purple_block_1 (to achieve the goal)
7. Ensure that throughout the plan, purple_block_1 is never on the table (constraint 1) and blue_block_2 is never on the table (constraint 5)

I've gotten stuck in a loop. Let me try to think about in terms of the order of operations.

I've already decided I should first pick up black_block_1 and place it somewhere, then hold purple_block_1 and place it somewhere (not on the table).

After that, I need to:
- Put grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2 (to satisfy the prerequisite for constraint 7)
- Make blue_block_1 clear (to satisfy constraint 6)
- Place blue_block_1 on top of green_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 4)
- Place blue_block_1 on top of purple_block_1 (to achieve the goal)

The constraints also tell me that:
- purple_block_1 is never on the table (constraint 1)
- blue_block_2 is never on the table (constraint 5)

Let's think about how to arrange things. To achieve the goal of placing blue_block_1 on top of purple_block_1, purple_block_1 needs to be clear. Currently, it's not clear in the initial state, and I'm planning to place it under other blocks, so I'll need to make it clear at some point.

Let's revisit where we left off:

1. pickup black_block_1
2. stack black_block_1 green_block_1
3. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1 (now holding purple_block_1, and black_block_1 is off the table, satisfying constraint 3)
4. stack purple_block_1 black_block_1
5. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2
6. stack red_block_1 purple_block_1
7. unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1
8. stack green_block_1 red_block_1
9. pickup grey_block_1
10. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2 (satisfying the prerequisite for constraint 7)
11. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_2
12. stack grey_block_1 green_block_1
13. unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1 (now blue_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint 6)

At this point, blue_block_1 is clear, and I've satisfied the prerequisite for constraint 7. Now I need to place blue_block_2 somewhere (not on the table, to satisfy constraint 5), make blue_block_1 be on top of green_block_1 at some point, and finally place blue_block_1 on top of purple_block_1.

14. stack blue_block_2 grey_block_1 (ensuring blue_block_2 is not on the table, satisfying constraint 5)
15. pickup blue_block_1
16. stack blue_block_1 green_block_1 (satisfying constraint 4)

Actually, green_block_1 isn't clear at this point. Let me trace through the state of the world again to be sure:

Initial state:
```
    purple_block_1     green_block_1     black_block_1
          |                 |
      red_block_1      grey_block_1
          |
      blue_block_2
          |
      blue_block_1
```

After step 13, the state is:
```
                   blue_block_2     black_block_1
                                       |
    green_block_1                 purple_block_1
          |                            |
      grey_block_1                red_block_1
                         
      blue_block_1
```

And after step 14, the state is:
```
                                 black_block_1
                                      |
    green_block_1                purple_block_1
          |                           |
      grey_block_1               red_block_1
          |                  
      blue_block_2
                         
      blue_block_1
```

So at this point, green_block_1 is clear. So we can continue:

15. pickup blue_block_1
16. stack blue_block_1 green_block_1 (satisfying constraint 4)

Now to achieve the goal, we need to place blue_block_1 on top of purple_block_1, but first, we need to clear purple_block_1, which currently has red_block_1 on it. But to remove red_block_1, we first need to clear blue_block_1 again.

17. unstack blue_block_1 green_block_1
18. putdown blue_block_1 (now blue_block_1 is on the table and clear)
19. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
20. stack red_block_1 blue_block_1
21. pickup blue_block_1
22. putdown blue_block_1 (blue_block_1 is on the table, with red_block_1 on top of it)

Wait, that's not optimal. Let me think again. 

15. pickup blue_block_1
16. stack blue_block_1 green_block_1 (satisfying constraint 4)
17. unstack blue_block_1 green_block_1
18. stack blue_block_1 blue_block_2 (ensuring blue_block_2 is not on the table, satisfying constraint 5)
19. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1 (now purple_block_1 is clear)
20. stack red_block_1 green_block_1
21. unstack blue_block_1 blue_block_2
22. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1 (achieving the goal)

Let's check if this plan satisfies all constraints:

1. purple_block_1 is never on the table (satisfied, as we always place it on another block)
2. You must hold purple_block_1 at least once (satisfied in step 3)
3. If you hold purple_block_1, then black_block_1 must not be on the table at that point or afterwards (satisfied, as we pick up black_block_1 before holding purple_block_1)
4. blue_block_1 must be on top of green_block_1 at least once (satisfied in step 16)
5. blue_block_2 is never on the table (satisfied, as we always place it on another block)
6. blue_block_1 must be clear at least once (satisfied in step 13)
7. If blue_block_1 is clear, there must be an earlier state where grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2 (satisfied, as we place grey_block_1 on blue_block_2 in step 10, before blue_block_1 becomes clear in step 13)

Great! I think this plan should work. Let me list the final plan:

1. pickup black_block_1
2. stack black_block_1 green_block_1
3. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1
4. stack purple_block_1 black_block_1
5. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2
6. stack red_block_1 purple_block_1
7. unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1
8. stack green_block_1 red_block_1
9. pickup grey_block_1
10. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2
11. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_2
12. stack grey_block_1 green_block_1
13. unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1
14. stack blue_block_2 grey_block_1
15. pickup blue_block_1
16. stack blue_block_1 green_block_1
17. unstack blue_block_1 green_block_1
18. stack blue_block_1 blue_block_2
19. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
20. stack red_block_1 green_block_1
21. unstack blue_block_1 blue_block_2
22. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1

Hmm, but I feel like this is not optimal. Let me see if I can find a shorter plan.

Initial state:
```
    purple_block_1     green_block_1     black_block_1
          |                 |
      red_block_1      grey_block_1
          |
      blue_block_2
          |
      blue_block_1
```

We need to:
1. Remove black_block_1 from the table (to satisfy constraint 3 before holding purple_block_1)
2. Hold purple_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 2)
3. Keep purple_block_1 off the table (constraint 1)
4. Keep blue_block_2 off the table (constraint 5)
5. Have grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2 at some point (prerequisite for constraint 7)
6. Make blue_block_1 clear at some point (constraint 6)
7. Have blue_block_1 on top of green_block_1 at some point (constraint 4)
8. End with blue_block_1 on top of purple_block_1 (goal)

Let's think step by step to create a more optimal plan.

1. First, we need to remove black_block_1 from the table:
   - pickup black_block_1

2. We need to place black_block_1 somewhere. Green_block_1 is clear:
   - stack black_block_1 green_block_1

3. Now we can hold purple_block_1:
   - unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1

4. We need to place purple_block_1 somewhere (not on the table):
   - stack purple_block_1 black_block_1

5. Now we need to re-enable the tower to get grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2 (for constraint 7). First, remove red_block_1:
   - unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2

6. We need to place red_block_1 somewhere:
   - stack red_block_1 purple_block_1

7. Now, to get grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2, we first need to clear grey_block_1:
   - unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1

8. We need to place green_block_1 somewhere:
   - stack green_block_1 red_block_1

9. Now we can pick up grey_block_1:
   - pickup grey_block_1

10. And place it on blue_block_2 (satisfying the prerequisite for constraint 7):
    - stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2

11. Now, we need to make blue_block_1 clear. First, remove grey_block_1 from blue_block_2:
    - unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_2

12. We need to place grey_block_1 somewhere:
    - stack grey_block_1 green_block_1

13. Now we can remove blue_block_2 from blue_block_1:
    - unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1 (now blue_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint 6)

14. We need to place blue_block_2 somewhere (not on the table):
    - stack blue_block_2 grey_block_1

15. Now we can pick up blue_block_1:
    - pickup blue_block_1

Now we need to place blue_block_1 on top of green_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 4), but green_block_1 is not clear. I THINK THIS IS WHERE I'M GETTING STUCK.

Ok, let me try to be more careful by explicitly labeling the states we go through.

Initial state:
```
    purple_block_1     green_block_1     black_block_1
          |                 |
      red_block_1      grey_block_1
          |
      blue_block_2
          |
      blue_block_1
```

Actually I need to look in more detail at exactly what the constraint says:

4. blue_block_1 must be on top of green_block_1 at least once

We need to ensure that at SOME point in the plan, blue_block_1 is on top of green_block_1. So let's just make sure we get them in that arrangement at some point.

Let's approach this differently. Let's work backwards from the goal.

Goal: "blue_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1"

To achieve this, we need:
1. purple_block_1 to be clear
2. blue_block_1 to be clear or held
3. Place blue_block_1 on top of purple_block_1

Currently in the initial state, neither of these blocks is clear. So we need to clear both of them.

Let's work forward again, focusing on the key steps:

1. Remove black_block_1 from the table (for constraint 3)
2. Clear blue_block_1 (for constraint 6), and ensure that grey_block_1 has been on top of blue_block_2 before this (for constraint 7)
3. Have blue_block_1 on top of green_block_1 at some point (for constraint 4)
4. Clear purple_block_1
5. Place blue_block_1 on top of purple_block_1 (goal)

Let's implement this plan:

1. First, remove black_block_1 from the table:
   - pickup black_block_1

2. Place black_block_1 somewhere:
   - stack black_block_1 green_block_1

3. To clear blue_block_1, we need to remove the stack on top of it. First, hold purple_block_1 (for constraint 2):
   - unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1

4. Place purple_block_1 somewhere (not on the table, for constraint 1):
   - stack purple_block_1 black_block_1

5. Continue clearing the path to blue_block_1:
   - unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2
   - stack red_block_1 purple_block_1

6. We need to have grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2 before making blue_block_1 clear (for constraint 7):
   - unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1
   - stack green_block_1 red_block_1
   - pickup grey_block_1
   - stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2

7. Now we can make blue_block_1 clear (for constraint 6):
   - unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_2
   - stack grey_block_1 green_block_1
   - unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1

8. Place blue_block_2 somewhere (not on the table, for constraint 5):
   - stack blue_block_2 grey_block_1

9. Now we need to place blue_block_1 on top of green_block_1 (for constraint 4), but green_block_1 is not clear. First, we need to clear it:
   - unstack blue_block_2 grey_block_1
   - stack blue_block_2 blue_block_1
   - unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
   - stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2

I realize I'm getting into a loop here. Let's try another approach. 

1. First, remove black_block_1 from the table:
   - pickup black_block_1

2. Place black_block_1 somewhere:
   - stack black_block_1 green_block_1

3. Hold purple_block_1 (for constraint 2):
   - unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1

4. Place purple_block_1 somewhere (not on the table, for constraint 1):
   - stack purple_block_1 black_block_1

5. Continue working towards having grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2:
   - unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2
   - stack red_block_1 purple_block_1

6. Now we need to get grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2 (for the prerequisite of constraint 7):
   - unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1
   - stack green_block_1 red_block_1
   - pickup grey_block_1
   - stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2

7. Now we need to make blue_block_1 clear (for constraint 6):
   - unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_2
   - stack grey_block_1 green_block_1
   - unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1

8. Place blue_block_2 somewhere (not on the table, for constraint 5):
   - stack blue_block_2 grey_block_1

Alright, so at this point we have:
- black_block_1 removed from the table (for constraint 3)
- held purple_block_1 (for constraint 2)
- purple_block_1 not on the table (for constraint 1)
- grey_block_1 has been on top of blue_block_2 (for the prerequisite of constraint 7)
- blue_block_1 is clear (for constraint 6)
- blue_block_2 is not on the table (for constraint 5)

Now we need to:
- place blue_block_1 on top of green_block_1 (for constraint 4)
- clear purple_block_1
- place blue_block_1 on top of purple_block_1 (goal)

Let's continue:

9. Pick up blue_block_1:
   - pickup blue_block_1

10. We need to place blue_block_1 on top of green_block_1 (for constraint 4), but it's not clear. We need to clear it:
    - We need to move grey_block_1 and blue_block_2 off of green_block_1.

This is getting complex again. Let's take a step back.

Actually I think my entire approach to planning this is getting too complicated. Let me try to reason more carefully through all of this.

We have these constraints:
1. purple_block_1 is never on the table
2. You must hold purple_block_1 at least once
3. If you hold purple_block_1, then black_block_1 must not be on the table at that point or afterwards
4. blue_block_1 must be on top of green_block_1 at least once
5. blue_block_2 is never on the table
6. blue_block_1 must be clear at least once
7. If blue_block_1 is clear, there must be an earlier state where grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2

From the initial state, we know:

```
    purple_block_1     green_block_1     black_block_1
          |                 |
      red_block_1      grey_block_1
          |
      blue_block_2
          |
      blue_block_1
```

Only black_block_1, purple_block_1, and green_block_1 are clear. We can't immediately clear blue_block_1 because we need to remove blue_block_2, red_block_1, and purple_block_1 from on top of it. And we can't remove purple_block_1 until we've removed black_block_1 from the table (due to constraint 3).

So, a general approach might be:
1. Remove black_block_1 from the table (for constraint 3)
2. Hold purple_block_1 (for constraint 2)
3. Rearrange blocks to have grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2 (for the prerequisite of constraint 7)
4. Make blue_block_1 clear (for constraint 6)
5. Place blue_block_1 on top of green_block_1 (for constraint 4)
6. Clear purple_block_1
7. Place blue_block_1 on top of purple_block_1 (goal)

Starting with the initial state:

1. Remove black_block_1 from the table (for constraint 3):
   - pickup black_block_1
   - stack black_block_1 green_block_1

2. Hold purple_block_1 (for constraint 2):
   - unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1

3. Place purple_block_1 somewhere (not on the table, for constraint 1):
   - stack purple_block_1 black_block_1

4. Continue working towards having grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2:
   - unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2
   - stack red_block_1 purple_block_1

5. Now we need to get grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2 (for the prerequisite of constraint 7):
   - unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1
   - stack green_block_1 red_block_1
   - pickup grey_block_1
   - stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2

So I've satisfied the requirement for constraint 7 (grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2). Let's check the state of the world:

```
      grey_block_1
          |
      blue_block_2
          |
      blue_block_1
```

```
      green_block_1
          |
       red_block_1
          |
    purple_block_1
          |
     black_block_1
          |
      (table)
```

6. Now I need to make blue_block_1 clear (for constraint 6):
   - unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_2
   - putdown grey_block_1 (grey_block_1 is now on the table)
   - unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1

7. Place blue_block_2 somewhere (not on the table, for constraint 5):
   - stack blue_block_2 grey_block_1

8. Now I need to place blue_block_1 on top of green_block_1 (for constraint 4):
   - pickup blue_block_1
   - unstack green_block_1 red_block_1
   - putdown green_block_1 (green_block_1 is now on the table)
   - stack blue_block_1 green_block_1

9. Now I need to place blue_block_1 on top of purple_block_1 (for the goal):
   - unstack blue_block_1 green_block_1
   - unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
   - putdown red_block_1 (red_block_1 is now on the table)
   - stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1

But wait, I've been a bit sloppy: I've placed grey_block_1 on the table, which I don't think violates any constraint. But to be safe, let's revise the plan:

6. Now I need to make blue_block_1 clear (for constraint 6):
   - unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_2
   - stack grey_block_1 green_block_1 (instead of putting it on the table)
   - unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1

7. Place blue_block_2 somewhere (not on the table, for constraint 5):
   - stack blue_block_2 grey_block_1

State after step 7:

```
      blue_block_2
          |
      grey_block_1
          |
      green_block_1
          |
       red_block_1
          |
    purple_block_1
          |
     black_block_1
          |
      (table)
```

```
      blue_block_1
          |
      (table)
```

8. Now I need to place blue_block_1 on top of green_block_1 (for constraint 4):
   - pickup blue_block_1
   - unstack blue_block_2 grey_block_1
   - stack blue_block_2 blue_block_1 (ensuring blue_block_2 is not on the table, for constraint 5)
   - unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
   - stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2 (building up the tower)
   - unstack blue_block_1 (with blue_block_2 and grey_block_1 on top) blue_block_1 (this is incorrect, we can't unstack a block from itself)

Hmm I think I'm getting confused with the state tracking. Let me try yet again, but I'll be more careful with tracking the state.

Initial state:
```
    purple_block_1     green_block_1     black_block_1
          |                 |
      red_block_1      grey_block_1
          |
      blue_block_2
          |
      blue_block_1
```

1. Remove black_block_1 from the table (for constraint 3):
   - pickup black_block_1
   - stack black_block_1 green_block_1

State after step 1:
```
    purple_block_1       black_block_1
          |                  |
      red_block_1       green_block_1
          |                  |
      blue_block_2      grey_block_1
          |
      blue_block_1
```

2. Hold purple_block_1 (for constraint 2) and place it somewhere (not on the table, for constraint 1):
   - unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1
   - stack purple_block_1 black_block_1

State after step 2:
```
                     purple_block_1
                          |
                      black_block_1
                          |
        red_block_1   green_block_1
          |               |
      blue_block_2    grey_block_1
          |
      blue_block_1
```

3. Continue working towards having grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2:
   - unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2
   - stack red_block_1 purple_block_1

State after step 3:
```
                      red_block_1
                          |
                     purple_block_1
                          |
                      black_block_1
                          |
        blue_block_2   green_block_1
          |               |
      blue_block_1    grey_block_1
```

4. Now we need to get grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2 (for the prerequisite of constraint 7):
   - unstack grey_block_1 (table) (this is wrong, it's not on the table, it's on green_block_1)
   - unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
   - stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2

State after step 4:
```
                      red_block_1
                          |
                     purple_block_1
                          |
                      black_block_1
                          |
       grey_block_1    green_block_1
          |               
      blue_block_2     
          |
      blue_block_1    
```

Alright, so at this point we've:
- Removed black_block_1 from the table (for constraint 3)
- Held purple_block_1 (for constraint 2)
- Kept purple_block_1 off the table (for constraint 1)
- Placed grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2 (for the prerequisite of constraint 7)

5. Now we need to make blue_block_1 clear (for constraint 6):
   - unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_2
   - stack grey_block_1 green_block_1
   - unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1

State after step 5:
```
                      red_block_1
                          |
                     purple_block_1
                          |
                      black_block_1
                          |
       blue_block_2    green_block_1
                          |
      blue_block_1     grey_block_1
```
Hmm this looks weird, let's check again. After "unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1", blue_block_2 is in the air, so it can't be above blue_block_1. Let me redo this step:

5. Now we need to make blue_block_1 clear (for constraint 6):
   - unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_2
   - stack grey_block_1 green_block_1
   - unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1
   - stack blue_block_2 grey_block_1

State after step 5:
```
                      red_block_1
                          |
                     purple_block_1
                          |
                      black_block_1
                          |
                       green_block_1
                          |
                      grey_block_1
                          |
                      blue_block_2

      blue_block_1
```

Alright, so at this point we've:
- Removed black_block_1 from the table (for constraint 3)
- Held purple_block_1 (for constraint 2)
- Kept purple_block_1 off the table (for constraint 1)
- Placed grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2 (for the prerequisite of constraint 7)
- Made blue_block_1 clear (for constraint 6)
- Kept blue_block_2 off the table (for constraint 5)

6. Now I need to place blue_block_1 on top of green_block_1 (for constraint 4):
   - pickup blue_block_1

Hmm, I can't directly place blue_block_1 on top of green_block_1 because it's not clear. I need to rearrange things.

   - pickup blue_block_1
   - unstack blue_block_2 grey_block_1
   - stack blue_block_2 blue_block_1 (this is wrong, we can't stack blue_block_2 on blue_block_1 because we're holding blue_block_1)

Let me rethink this. After picking up blue_block_1, we have:

```
                      red_block_1
                          |
                     purple_block_1
                          |
                      black_block_1
                          |
                       green_block_1
                          |
                      grey_block_1
                          |
                      blue_block_2
```

And we're holding blue_block_1.

We need to place blue_block_1 on top of green_block_1, but green_block_1 is not clear. We need to clear it. But to clear green_block_1, we need to remove everything on top of it, which is a lot of blocks. 

Let me try a different approach. Maybe we could avoid building such a tall tower.

Let's revisit where we left off at the end of step 3:

```
                      red_block_1
                          |
                     purple_block_1
                          |
                      black_block_1
                          |
        blue_block_2   green_block_1
          |               |
      blue_block_1    grey_block_1
```

From here, let's try:

4. Now we need to get grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2 (for the prerequisite of constraint 7):
   - unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
   - stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2

State after step 4:
```
                      red_block_1
                          |
                     purple_block_1
                          |
                      black_block_1
                          |
       grey_block_1    green_block_1
          |               
      blue_block_2     
          |
      blue_block_1    
```

5. I need green_block_1 to be clear so I can place blue_block_1 on it:
   - unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_2
   - stack grey_block_1 green_block_1 (grey_block_1 is now on top of green_block_1, so green_block_1 is not clear)

Hmm, I'm having a hard time figuring out how to organize this to satisfy all the constraints. Let's try one more approach. Let's simplify the tower structure.

Let's create a more specific action sequence from the initial state:

Initial state:
```
    purple_block_1     green_block_1     black_block_1
          |                 |
      red_block_1      grey_block_1
          |
      blue_block_2
          |
      blue_block_1
```

1. Remove black_block_1 from the table (for constraint 3):
   - pickup black_block_1

2. Place black_block_1 on top of green_block_1:
   - stack black_block_1 green_block_1

State after step 2:
```
    purple_block_1      black_block_1
          |                  |
      red_block_1      green_block_1
          |                  |
      blue_block_2      grey_block_1
          |
      blue_block_1
```

3. Hold purple_block_1 (for constraint 2):
   - unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1

4. Place purple_block_1 on top of black_block_1 (not on the table, for constraint 1):
   - stack purple_block_1 black_block_1

State after step 4:
```
                    purple_block_1
                          |
                      black_block_1
                          |
      red_block_1     green_block_1
        |                   |
    blue_block_2        grey_block_1
        |
    blue_block_1
```

5. Continue working towards having grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2:
   - unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
   - putdown grey_block_1 (grey_block_1 is now on the table)

State after step 5:
```
                    purple_block_1
                          |
                      black_block_1
                          |
      red_block_1     green_block_1
        |                   
    blue_block_2        grey_block_1
        |
    blue_block_1
```

6. Remove red_block_1 from blue_block_2:
   - unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2
   - stack red_block_1 green_block_1 (red_block_1 is now on top of green_block_1)

State after step 6:
```
                    purple_block_1
                          |
                      black_block_1
                          |
      blue_block_2     green_block_1
        |                   |
    blue_block_1       red_block_1
    
                      grey_block_1
```

7. Place grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2 (for the prerequisite of constraint 7):
   - pickup grey_block_1
   - stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2

State after step 7:
```
                    purple_block_1
                          |
                      black_block_1
                          |
      grey_block_1     green_block_1
        |                   |
    blue_block_2       red_block_1
        |
    blue_block_1
```

8. Now we need to make blue_block_1 clear (for constraint 6):
   - unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_2
   - stack grey_block_1 red_block_1 (grey_block_1 is now on top of red_block_1)
   - unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1 (blue_block_1 is now clear, satisfying constraint 6)
   - stack blue_block_2 grey_block_1 (blue_block_2 is now on top of grey_block_1, ensuring it's not on the table, for constraint 5)

State after step 8:
```
                    purple_block_1
                          |
                      black_block_1
                          |
                       green_block_1
                           |
                       red_block_1
                           |
                      grey_block_1
                           |
                      blue_block_2

    blue_block_1
```

9. Now we need to place blue_block_1 on top of green_block_1 (for constraint 4):
   - pickup blue_block_1
   - unstack blue_block_2 grey_block_1
   - stack blue_block_2 blue_block_1 (this is wrong, we can't do this because we're holding blue_block_1)

Hmm, it's still challenging. Let's rethink the whole problem.

Actually, let me verify my plan up to step 8, to make sure I've satisfied the constraints correctly.

By step 8, I've:
- Removed black_block_1 from the table (for constraint 3)
- Held purple_block_1 (for constraint 2)
- Kept purple_block_1 off the table (for constraint 1)
- Had grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2 (for the prerequisite of constraint 7)
- Made blue_block_1 clear (for constraint 6)
- Kept blue_block_2 off the table (for constraint 5)

I'm now holding blue_block_1, and I need to:
- Place blue_block_1 on top of green_block_1 (for constraint 4)
- Clear purple_block_1
- Place blue_block_1 on top of purple_block_1 (goal)

Oh I understand the issue now. When blue_block_1 is clear, I need to get green_block_1 clear too so that I can place blue_block_1 on top of green_block_1.

Instead of the actions in step 8, let's do:

8. Create a cleaner state:
   - unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_2
   - stack grey_block_1 black_block_1 (grey_block_1 is now on top of black_block_1)
   - unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1 (blue_block_1 is now clear, satisfying constraint 6)
   - stack blue_block_2 grey_block_1 (blue_block_2 is now on top of grey_block_1, ensuring it's not on the table, for constraint 5)

State after step 8:
```
                      blue_block_2
                           |
                      grey_block_1
                           |
                      black_block_1
                           |
                     purple_block_1
                           

     blue_block_1     green_block_1
                          |
                      red_block_1
```

9. Now we need to place blue_block_1 on top of green_block_1 (for constraint 4):
   - pickup blue_block_1
   - unstack red_block_1 green_block_1
   - putdown red_block_1 (red_block_1 is now on the table)
   - stack blue_block_1 green_block_1 (blue_block_1 is now on top of green_block_1, satisfying constraint 4)

State after step 9:
```
                      blue_block_2
                           |
                      grey_block_1
                           |
                      black_block_1
                           |
                     purple_block_1
                           

     red_block_1     blue_block_1
                          |
                     green_block_1
```

10. Now we need to place blue_block_1 on top of purple_block_1 (for the goal):
    - unstack blue_block_1 green_block_1
    - unstack blue_block_2 grey_block_1
    - stack blue_block_2 green_block_1 (blue_block_2 is now on top of green_block_1, ensuring it's not on the table, for constraint 5)
    - stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1 (blue_block_1 is now on top of purple_block_1, achieving the goal)

Let's check if this plan satisfies all constraints:

1. purple_block_1 is never on the table (satisfied, as we always place it on another block)
2. You must hold purple_block_1 at least once (satisfied in step 3)
3. If you hold purple_block_1, then black_block_1 must not be on the table at that point or afterwards (satisfied, as we pick up black_block_1 in step 1, before holding purple_block_1 in step 3)
4. blue_block_1 must be on top of green_block_1 at least once (satisfied in step 9)
5. blue_block_2 is never on the table (satisfied, as we always place it on another block)
6. blue_block_1 must be clear at least once (satisfied in step 8)
7. If blue_block_1 is clear, there must be an earlier state where grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2 (satisfied, as we place grey_block_1 on blue_block_2 in step 7, before blue_block_1 becomes clear in step 8)

Great! I think this plan satisfies all constraints. Let me list out the final plan:

1. pickup black_block_1
2. stack black_block_1 green_block_1
3. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1
4. stack purple_block_1 black_block_1
5. unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
6. putdown grey_block_1
7. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2
8. stack red_block_1 green_block_1
9. pickup grey_block_1
10. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2
11. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_2
12. stack grey_block_1 black_block_1
13. unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1
14. stack blue_block_2 grey_block_1
15. pickup blue_block_1
16. unstack red_block_1 green_block_1
17. putdown red_block_1
18. stack blue_block_1 green_block_1
19. unstack blue_block_1 green_block_1
20. unstack blue_block_2 grey_block_1
21. stack blue_block_2 green_block_1
22. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1
