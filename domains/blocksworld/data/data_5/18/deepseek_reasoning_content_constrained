Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get yellow_block_1 onto the table. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy along the way. Hmm, let's start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

First, the initial state:
- white_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top of it. Yellow_block_1 is clear.
- white_block_2 is on the table with green_block_1 on top. Green_block_1 is clear.
- orange_block_1, orange_block_2, and red_block_1 are on the table and clear.
- The arm is empty.

The goal is to have yellow_block_1 on the table. So, we need to move it from white_block_1 to the table. But the constraints complicate things.

Let's look at the constraints one by one:

1. **Constraint 1**: At some state, yellow_block_1 is not on white_block_1. That's already going to happen when we move it, so that's covered by the goal.

2. **Constraint 2**: If yellow_block_1 is not on white_block_1 (which will be true after moving it), then either white_block_2 is clear or white_block_2 is on green_block_1. Wait, white_block_2 is on the table with green_block_1 on top. So white_block_2 is under green_block_1. So "white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" is impossible because green_block_1 is on white_block_2. So maybe we need to make white_block_2 clear. But initially, green_block_1 is on it, so to make white_block_2 clear, we need to move green_block_1 somewhere else. Alternatively, maybe stack white_block_2 on green_block_1, but that's not possible since green_block_1 is on white_block_2. So perhaps the first option: make white_block_2 clear. So after moving yellow_block_1, we need to ensure that either white_block_2 is clear or... wait, the condition is that if in state s, yellow isn't on white1, then in s or after, either white2 is clear or white2 is on green1. But white2 can't be on green1 because green1 is on white2. So maybe we need to make white_block_2 clear. That would require moving green_block_1 off of it.

But moving green_block_1 might be part of the plan. Let's keep this in mind.

3. **Constraint 3**: At some state, green_block_1 is not on yellow_block_1. Currently, green is on white2, so this is already true. But wait, maybe during the plan, someone stacks green on yellow. But the initial state has green on white2. So unless we move green to yellow, this condition is already satisfied. So perhaps this constraint is already met, but maybe we need to ensure that it's true at least once. Wait, the initial state has green_block_1 on white_block_2, so green is not on yellow. So this condition is already true in the initial state. But the constraint says it must hold in at least one state, which it does. So maybe this constraint is already satisfied. Wait, but the problem says "must hold in at least one state", so maybe the initial state counts. But the user might want us to make sure that during the plan, this is true. But since it's already true, maybe this constraint is automatically satisfied. So maybe no action needed here.

4. **Constraint 4**: If green_block_1 is not on yellow_block_1 (which is always true except if we stack green on yellow), then in that state or later, orange_block_1 must be on white_block_2. So since the initial state already has green not on yellow, then we need to have orange_block_1 on white_block_2 at some point after. So we need to stack orange_block_1 onto white_block_2. But white_block_2 currently has green_block_1 on it. So to stack orange_block_1 on white_block_2, we need to first move green_block_1 somewhere else.

5. **Constraint 5**: At some state, red_block_1 is not clear (i.e., has a block on top). So we need to stack something on red_block_1.

6. **Constraint 6**: At some state, orange_block_1 is not on red_block_1. Since initially, orange_block_1 is on the table, not on red, this is already true. But perhaps during the plan, we might stack orange1 on red1, so we need to ensure that at some point, it's not. Since the initial state already satisfies this, maybe this constraint is met. But wait, the constraint requires it to hold in at least one state. So the initial state counts. But perhaps the user wants it to be true in the plan's states, but if it's already true in the initial state, that's okay. However, the constraint says "must hold in at least one state", which includes the initial state. So maybe no action needed here.

7. **Constraint 7**: If orange_block_1 is not on red_block_1 (which is true in the initial state and unless we stack it there), then in that state or later, either orange1 is not on the table or red1 has a block on top. So, since in the initial state, orange1 is on the table and red1 is clear, we need to either move orange1 off the table or put something on red1. Since constraint 5 requires putting something on red1, that would satisfy this. So if we put a block on red1 (to satisfy constraint5), then in that state, red1 is not clear, so the second part of the condition is met. So if we handle constraint5, then constraint7 is satisfied.

8. **Constraint 8**: At some state, both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 are not clear (i.e., have blocks on top). So we need to stack something on green1 and something on orange1.

Putting all together:

The main goal is to get yellow1 on the table. Let's outline steps:

1. Unstack yellow1 from white1. But to do that, yellow1 is clear (yes), and the arm is empty (yes). So unstack yellow1 white1. That would pick up yellow1, making white1 clear. Then putdown yellow1. But wait, the goal is to have yellow1 on the table. So unstack yellow1 from white1, then putdown. But wait, after unstack, we're holding yellow1, then putdown. That's two steps. But that would achieve the goal.

But we need to satisfy all constraints. Let's see.

But the constraints require:

- After moving yellow1 (so when it's not on white1), we need to make sure that white2 is clear or white2 is on green1. But white2 has green1 on it, so white2 is not clear. To make white2 clear, we need to move green1. Or stack white2 on green1, which is impossible. So perhaps we need to move green1 from white2. Then white2 becomes clear. So maybe after moving yellow1, we need to move green1.

But let's see. Let's first move yellow1 to the table. That would satisfy the goal. Then, to handle constraint2, after moving yellow1, we need to ensure that white2 is clear or white2 is on green1. Since white2 is under green1, so white2 is not clear. So we need to make white2 clear. That requires moving green1. So after putting down yellow1, we need to pickup green1 and put it somewhere else.

But then, constraint4 says that if green1 is not on yellow1 (which it isn't, because we moved it from white2 to, say, orange1), then we need to have orange1 on white2. Wait, constraint4 says that if green1 is not on yellow1 (which is always true unless we stack green1 on yellow1), then in that state or after, orange1 must be on white2. So after moving green1, we have to stack orange1 on white2.

So steps could be:

- Unstack yellow1 from white1. Now holding yellow1.
- Putdown yellow1. Now yellow1 is on table. Goal achieved. But need to handle other constraints.

But after that, we need to handle constraint2: since yellow1 is not on white1, we need to make white2 clear or white2 on green1. White2 is not clear (green1 is on it), so we need to make white2 clear. So we need to move green1.

So:

- Unstack green1 from white2. Wait, green1 is on white2. To unstack green1 from white2, we need green1 to be clear (which it is), and the arm is empty (after putting down yellow1, the arm is empty). So:

After putting down yellow1:

- Pickup green1 (from white2). Wait, pickup requires that the block is on the table. But green1 is on white2, not on the table. So we can't pickup green1. Instead, we need to unstack green1 from white2. So the correct action is unstack green1 white2. But unstack has preconditions: green1 is on white2, green1 is clear (yes), arm is empty (yes). So:

After putting down yellow1:

- Unstack green1 white2. Now holding green1.
- Then, putdown green1. Now green1 is on the table. White2 is clear. This satisfies constraint2's condition (white2 is clear) in the state after unstacking green1. So constraint2 is satisfied.

But then, constraint4: when green1 is not on yellow1 (which is true even after moving green1 to table), we need orange1 to be on white2. So we need to stack orange1 on white2. So after moving green1, stack orange1 on white2.

But stacking orange1 on white2 requires that white2 is clear. After moving green1, white2 is clear. So:

- After unstacking green1 and putting it down, we can pickup orange1 (since it's on the table and clear), then stack it on white2.

So steps:

1. Unstack yellow1 white1. (now holding yellow1)
2. Putdown yellow1. (yellow on table, goal met)
3. Unstack green1 white2. (holding green1)
4. Putdown green1. (green on table, white2 clear)
5. Pickup orange1. (orange1 is on table, clear)
6. Stack orange1 white2. (now orange1 on white2, white2 not clear, orange1 clear)

This would satisfy constraint4, because after moving green1 (which is not on yellow1), we stack orange1 on white2.

Now, constraint5: red_block_1 must have a block on top at some point. So we need to stack something on red1. Let's pick a block. Maybe orange_block_2. But orange2 is on the table and clear. So:

- After step6, stack orange2 on red1.

So:

7. Pickup orange2. (it's on table, clear)
8. Stack orange2 red1. (orange2 on red1, red1 not clear)

This satisfies constraint5.

Constraint8: need green1 and orange1 to have blocks on top. Currently, green1 is on table, orange1 is on white2. So we need to stack something on green1 and something on orange1.

But in the current plan, after step6, orange1 is on white2 and clear. So we need to stack something on orange1. Let's use, say, red_block_1. But red1 is under orange2 now. Wait, after step8, red1 has orange2 on it. So red1 is not clear. But to stack something on orange1, which is on white2, we need to have a block to put there. Maybe green1 is on the table. So:

Let's stack green1 on orange1. But orange1 is on white2 and clear. So:

9. Pickup green1 (on table, clear)
10. Stack green1 orange1. (green1 on orange1, orange1 not clear)

Now, green1 is on top of orange1, making orange1 not clear. But green1 is now on top of orange1, which is on white2. Also, green1 is not clear. So in this state, green1 has a block on top (none, since we just stacked it, so green1 is clear? Wait, no. When you stack green1 on orange1, green1 becomes clear (from the stack effect). Wait, the stack action's effects: after stacking b1 on b2, b1 is on b2, b1 is clear, b2 is not clear. So stacking green1 on orange1 would make green1 clear and orange1 not clear. So after step10, green1 is clear. So we need to stack something on green1. Maybe orange_block_2 is on red1. So maybe use another block, like red_block_1. Wait, red1 has orange2 on it. So to stack something on green1, we need a block. Let's use white_block_1, which is on the table and clear (since yellow1 was moved). So:

11. Pickup white_block_1. (it's on table, clear)
12. Stack white_block_1 green1. (white1 on green1, green1 not clear)

Now, green1 has white1 on top. So in this state, green1 is not clear. And orange1 is not clear (from step10). So constraint8 is satisfied.

But wait, let's check the steps again. After step10, orange1 is not clear (since green1 is on it). So green1 is clear, but orange1 is not. Then in step12, we stack white1 on green1, making green1 not clear. So in the final state, both green1 and orange1 are not clear. So constraint8 is satisfied.

But this is adding a lot of steps. However, the problem says to provide an optimal plan, which is the shortest possible. So maybe there's a way to combine some of these steps to minimize the total actions.

Wait, but maybe we can find a shorter path. Let's re-examine the constraints.

Constraints that need to be satisfied:

- Constraint5: red1 must have a block on top at some point. So stack any block on red1.

- Constraint8: both green1 and orange1 must have blocks on top at some state. So stack something on each.

But maybe we can do this with fewer steps. Let's see.

Alternative approach:

The main goal is to get yellow1 on the table. Let's do that first.

1. Unstack yellow1 white1 → holding yellow1.
2. Putdown yellow1 → done. Goal achieved.

Now, handle other constraints.

Constraint2: after moving yellow1 (so state after step2), we need white2 to be clear or on green1. White2 has green1 on it, so we need to move green1 to make white2 clear.

3. Unstack green1 white2 → holding green1.
4. Putdown green1 → white2 clear. Now constraint2 is satisfied.

Constraint4: since green1 is not on yellow1 (from step4), we need orange1 on white2. So:

5. Pickup orange1 → holding orange1.
6. Stack orange1 white2 → orange1 on white2. Now constraint4 is satisfied.

Constraint5: stack something on red1.

7. Pickup orange2 → holding orange2.
8. Stack orange2 red1 → done. Constraint5 satisfied.

Constraint8: need green1 and orange1 to have blocks on top. Currently, green1 is on table (clear), orange1 is on white2 (clear). So need to stack on both.

So stack something on green1 and something on orange1.

Let's stack green1 on orange1:

9. Pickup green1 → holding green1.
10. Stack green1 orange1 → green1 on orange1. Now orange1 is not clear.

Then stack something on green1. Let's use white1:

11. Pickup white1 → holding white1.
12. Stack white1 green1 → white1 on green1. Now green1 is not clear.

Now, in step10 and 12, both green1 and orange1 are not clear. So constraint8 is satisfied.

But this is 12 steps. Is there a shorter way?

Wait, maybe after stacking orange1 on white2 (step6), we can stack green1 on orange1, which would make both orange1 and green1 not clear. Then stack something else on green1. But that's still steps.

Alternatively, after step6 (orange1 on white2), if we stack something on orange1, that would make orange1 not clear. Then stack something on green1. But green1 is on the table. So maybe:

After step4 (green1 on table), step5: pickup green1, stack on orange1. Then stack something on green1.

But maybe that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps when moving green1, instead of putting it down, stack it on orange1.

Wait, after step3 (unstack green1 from white2), we can stack green1 on orange1 directly, if possible.

Let's see:

After step3, holding green1. To stack green1 on orange1, need orange1 to be clear. Initially, orange1 is on table and clear. So yes.

So:

3. Unstack green1 white2 → holding green1.
4. Stack green1 orange1 → green1 on orange1. Now orange1 is not clear. Also, green1 is clear.

This would satisfy constraint4, because green1 is not on yellow1, so we need orange1 on white2. Wait, no. Because constraint4 says that if green1 is not on yellow1, then orange1 must be on white2. But stacking green1 on orange1 (which is on the table) doesn't put orange1 on white2. So we still need to move orange1 to white2.

So perhaps that approach doesn't work.

So back to the previous plan.

Another approach: when moving green1 from white2, instead of putting it down, stack it on red1. That way, we satisfy constraint5 (red1 has a block) and handle green1's movement.

So steps:

1. Unstack yellow1 white1 → hold yellow1.
2. Putdown yellow1.
3. Unstack green1 white2 → hold green1.
4. Stack green1 red1 → green1 on red1. Now red1 is not clear (constraint5). Also, white2 is clear (constraint2). Then, for constraint4, since green1 is not on yellow1 (it's on red1), we need orange1 on white2. So:

5. Pickup orange1 → hold orange1.
6. Stack orange1 white2 → orange1 on white2. Now constraint4 satisfied.

Now, constraint8: need green1 and orange1 to have blocks on top. Currently, green1 is on red1 (so green1 is clear?), and orange1 is on white2 (clear). So need to stack something on both.

But green1 is on red1. To make green1 not clear, stack something on it. Let's use orange2:

7. Pickup orange2 → hold orange2.
8. Stack orange2 green1 → orange2 on green1. Now green1 not clear.

Orange1 is on white2. Stack something on it, say white_block_1.

9. Pickup white1 → hold white1.
10. Stack white1 orange1 → white1 on orange1. Now orange1 not clear.

Now, in step8 and 10, both green1 and orange1 are not clear. So constraint8 satisfied.

This plan is 10 steps. Let's count:

1. Unstack yellow1 white1
2. Putdown yellow1
3. Unstack green1 white2
4. Stack green1 red1
5. Pickup orange1
6. Stack orange1 white2
7. Pickup orange2
8. Stack orange2 green1
9. Pickup white1
10. Stack white1 orange1

That's 10 steps. But maybe there's a way to combine steps.

Wait, after step4 (green1 on red1), can we stack orange2 on green1 immediately?

But in step4, after stacking green1 on red1, the arm is empty. So step5 could be pickup orange2 and stack on green1.

But then:

5. Pickup orange2 → hold orange2.
6. Stack orange2 green1 → now green1 is not clear. This handles part of constraint8.

Then, need to handle orange1 on white2. So:

7. Pickup orange1 → hold orange1.
8. Stack orange1 white2 → orange1 on white2. Now constraint4 satisfied.

But now, need to make orange1 not clear. So stack something on it:

9. Pickup white1 → hold white1.
10. Stack white1 orange1 → done.

This is still 10 steps. Maybe there's a way to use fewer steps.

Alternatively, after step6 (stack orange1 on white2), can we stack something on orange1 immediately?

Yes. After step6, the arm is empty. So:

7. Pickup white1 → hold white1.
8. Stack white1 orange1 → now orange1 not clear.

Then, handle green1:

But green1 is already on red1. To make it not clear, stack orange2 on green1.

9. Pickup orange2 → hold orange2.
10. Stack orange2 green1 → done.

So that's 10 steps again.

Alternatively, when stacking orange1 on white2, can we do something else. Wait, perhaps after stacking orange1 on white2, we can stack white1 on orange1 in the same step.

No, each action is one step.

Hmm. Let's see if there's a shorter path.

Wait, constraint8 requires that in some state, both green1 and orange1 are not clear. So maybe during the process of stacking, we can have a state where both are covered. For example, if we stack something on green1 and something on orange1 in separate steps, but maybe overlapping.

But each step can only do one action. So no way around that.

Another idea: use the block we moved earlier. For example, after putting down yellow1, we have to move green1. Maybe instead of putting green1 on red1, we put it on orange1. Then, stack orange1 on white2, which would have green1 on top.

Wait:

1. Unstack yellow1 white1 → hold yellow1.
2. Putdown yellow1 → done.
3. Unstack green1 white2 → hold green1.
4. Stack green1 orange1 → green1 on orange1 (orange1 is on table). Now orange1 is not clear.
5. Pickup orange1 → can't, because orange1 has green1 on top. Wait, no. After stacking green1 on orange1, orange1 is under green1. So to pickup orange1, it's on the table? No, orange1 is on the table with green1 on top. So orange1 is not clear. So you can't pickup orange1 because it's not clear. So this approach doesn't work.

Alternatively, stack green1 on red1 (to satisfy constraint5), then stack orange1 on white2, then stack something on orange1 and green1.

But that's back to the previous plan.

Alternatively, after moving green1 to red1, then stack orange1 on white2, then stack orange2 on green1, and white1 on orange1. That's 8 steps:

1. Unstack yellow1 white1
2. Putdown
3. Unstack green1 white2
4. Stack green1 red1
5. Pickup orange1
6. Stack orange1 white2
7. Pickup orange2
8. Stack orange2 green1
9. Pickup white1
10. Stack white1 orange1

Still 10 steps. Is there a way to reduce this?

Wait, maybe after stacking orange1 on white2, we can stack orange1 with another block. But no, we need to stack something on orange1.

Alternatively, use a different block for stacking on red1. For example, instead of green1, use orange2. Then steps would be:

1. Unstack yellow1 → putdown.
2. Unstack green1 → putdown.
3. Pickup orange2 → stack on red1. That's 5 steps so far.
But then, need to handle orange1 on white2.

But this might not save steps.

Alternatively, maybe stack orange1 on red1, satisfying constraint5 and moving orange1 off the table (to satisfy constraint7). Wait, constraint7 says if orange1 is not on red1 (which it is initially), then either orange1 is not on table or red1 has a block. If we stack orange1 on red1, then orange1 is not on the table. So that would satisfy constraint7. But constraint6 requires that orange1 is not on red1 in some state. Wait, constraint6 is that "orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1" must hold in at least one state. But if we stack orange1 on red1, then in that state, it is on red1, which violates constraint6? No, constraint6 requires that in at least one state, orange1 is not on red1. The initial state already satisfies this, so it's okay. Even if we stack orange1 on red1 later, as long as in some state (like the initial) it's not, it's fine. So stacking orange1 on red1 would satisfy constraint5 (red1 has a block) and constraint7 (because after stacking, orange1 is not on the table, so the condition is met). 

So, alternative steps:

1. Unstack yellow1 → putdown.
2. Unstack green1 → stack on red1. (green1 on red1: constraint5 satisfied)
3. Pickup orange1 → stack on white2. (constraint4 satisfied)
4. Now, need to stack something on green1 (to make it not clear) and on orange1.

Stack orange2 on green1:

5. Pickup orange2 → stack on green1.
6. Pickup white1 → stack on orange1.

This is 6 steps after the initial two, totaling 8 steps. Let's count:

1. Unstack yellow1 white1
2. Putdown yellow1
3. Unstack green1 white2
4. Stack green1 red1
5. Pickup orange1
6. Stack orange1 white2
7. Pickup orange2
8. Stack orange2 green1
9. Pickup white1
10. Stack white1 orange1

Still 10 steps. Hmm.

Wait, maybe after stacking green1 on red1 (step4), we can stack orange2 on green1 (step5), then pickup orange1 and stack on white2 (steps6-7). Then stack white1 on orange1 (steps8-9). But that's still 9 steps.

Alternatively, after step4, stack orange2 on green1 (step5), which makes green1 not clear. Then stack orange1 on white2 (steps6-7), making orange1 on white2. Then stack white1 on orange1 (steps8-9). Then, we need to stack something on orange1 to make it not clear. Wait, after step7, orange1 is on white2 and clear. So stacking white1 on it (step9) makes it not clear. So steps:

1. Unstack yellow1
2. Putdown
3. Unstack green1
4. Stack green1 red1
5. Pickup orange2
6. Stack orange2 green1
7. Pickup orange1
8. Stack orange1 white2
9. Pickup white1
10. Stack white1 orange1

Still 10 steps.

Hmm. It seems like 10 steps is the minimum. But maybe there's a way to combine some steps.

Wait, what if after stacking green1 on red1 (step4), we then stack orange1 on white2 (steps5-6), then stack orange2 on green1 (steps7-8), and white1 on orange1 (steps9-10). Same count.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to use a different block for stacking on red1. For example, use orange2 instead of green1. Then:

1. Unstack yellow1 → putdown.
2. Unstack green1 → putdown.
3. Pickup orange2 → stack on red1 (constraint5).
4. Pickup orange1 → stack on white2 (constraint4).
5. Stack green1 on orange1 (making orange1 not clear).
6. Stack white1 on green1 (making green1 not clear).

This would be:

1. Unstack yellow1 white1
2. Putdown yellow1
3. Unstack green1 white2
4. Putdown green1
5. Pickup orange2
6. Stack orange2 red1
7. Pickup orange1
8. Stack orange1 white2
9. Pickup green1
10. Stack green1 orange1
11. Pickup white1
12. Stack white1 green1

Now, this is 12 steps, which is longer. So not better.

Hmm. It seems like the optimal plan is 10 steps. Let's check if all constraints are satisfied:

- Constraint1: yellow1 not on white1 after step1. Satisfied.

- Constraint2: after step3 (unstack green1), white2 is clear. So in that state, white2 is clear, which satisfies constraint2.

- Constraint3: green1 is not on yellow1 in all states. Satisfied.

- Constraint4: after moving green1 (step3), orange1 is stacked on white2 (step6). Satisfied.

- Constraint5: red1 has orange2 stacked (step8). Satisfied.

- Constraint6: orange1 is not on red1 in initial state. Satisfied.

- Constraint7: after step6, orange1 is on white2 (not on table), so the condition is satisfied.

- Constraint8: in steps10 and 12, green1 and orange1 are not clear. Satisfied.

But wait, in the first plan, after step4 (stack green1 on red1), step5-6 stack orange1 on white2, then steps7-8 stack orange2 on green1, steps9-10 stack white1 on orange1. So in step8, green1 has orange2 on it (not clear). In step10, orange1 has white1 on it (not clear). So constraint8 is satisfied.

Yes, all constraints are met.

Now, the plan steps are:

1. Unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
2. Putdown yellow_block_1
3. Unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
4. Stack green_block_1 red_block_1
5. Pickup orange_block_1
6. Stack orange_block_1 white_block_2
7. Pickup orange_block_2
8. Stack orange_block_2 green_block_1
9. Pickup white_block_1
10. Stack white_block_1 orange_block_1

Let me count again:

- Steps 1-2: achieve the goal.
- Steps3-4: handle constraint2 and constraint5.
- Steps5-6: handle constraint4.
- Steps7-8: handle constraint8 for green_block_1.
- Steps9-10: handle constraint8 for orange_block_1.

This plan has 10 steps.

But wait, after step4, green_block_1 is on red_block_1. Then step8 stacks orange_block_2 on green_block_1. So green_block_1 is not clear. And step10 stacks white_block_1 on orange_block_1, making orange_block_1 not clear. So in the final state, both are not clear. But also, during the plan, when step8 is executed, green_block_1 becomes not clear. And step10 makes orange_block_1 not clear. So the constraint8 is satisfied.

Yes. All constraints are met.

Therefore, this should be the optimal plan with 10 steps. Let me verify once more that there's no shorter way.

Alternative idea: Can we stack orange_block_2 on red_block_1 earlier, thus combining steps?

For example:

After step2 (yellow on table), step3: pickup orange_block_2 and stack on red_block_1 (satisfy constraint5). Then proceed to move green_block_1. But moving green_block_1 would require unstacking it, which is possible as long as it's clear.

But this might not save steps. Let's see:

1. Unstack yellow1 white1 → hold.
2. Putdown yellow1.
3. Pickup orange2 → hold.
4. Stack orange2 red1 → satisfies constraint5.
5. Unstack green1 white2 → hold.
6. Stack green1 orange1 → but orange1 is on table. So after stacking green1 on orange1, then orange1 is not clear. Then, need to stack orange1 on white2.

But this might not help. Let's see:

After step6, green1 is on orange1 (on table). To stack orange1 on white2, we need to unstack green1 from orange1:

7. Unstack green1 orange1 → hold green1.
8. Putdown green1.
