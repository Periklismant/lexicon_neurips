Alright, let's break down this problem. I need to come up with a valid plan to move blocks around that satisfies a goal and a set of constraints.

The original state of the world is:
- white_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_2 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on top of white_block_2
- orange_block_2 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1, orange_block_1, green_block_1, orange_block_2, red_block_1 are all clear
- You're not holding any block

The goal is to have:
- yellow_block_1 is on the table

The constraints are quite complex:

1. At some point, "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" must be true.
2. If "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" holds in a state s, then at s or after it, at least one of these must be true: "white_block_2 is clear" or "white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1".
3. At some point, "green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1" must be true.
4. If "green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1" holds in a state s, then at s or after it, "orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2" must be true.
5. At some point, "red_block_1 is not clear" must be true.
6. At some point, "orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1" must be true.
7. If "orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1" holds in a state s, then at s or after it, at least one of these must be true: "orange_block_1 is not on the table" or "red_block_1 is not clear".
8. At some point, both "green_block_1 is not clear" and "orange_block_1 is not clear" must be true.

Let's check the initial state against these constraints:

1. Initially, yellow_block_1 IS on top of white_block_1, so this constraint is not satisfied.
2. This is a conditional constraint, and the condition "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is not true in the initial state, so we don't need to check the consequence yet.
3. Initially, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_2, not on top of yellow_block_1, so this constraint is satisfied.
4. This is a conditional constraint, and the condition "green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1" is true in the initial state. So we need to ensure that "orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2" holds in the initial state or some state after it. Initially, orange_block_1 is on the table, not on top of white_block_2, so we'll need to make this happen at some point.
5. Initially, red_block_1 is clear, so this constraint is not satisfied.
6. Initially, orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1 (it's on the table), so this constraint is satisfied.
7. This is a conditional constraint, and the condition "orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1" is true in the initial state. So we need to ensure that either "orange_block_1 is not on the table" or "red_block_1 is not clear" holds in the initial state or some state after it. Initially, orange_block_1 IS on the table, and red_block_1 IS clear, so neither of these is true. We'll need to make one of them happen at some point.
8. Initially, both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 are clear, so this constraint is not satisfied.

Now, let's think about how to achieve the goal while satisfying these constraints.

The goal is for yellow_block_1 to be on the table. Currently, it's on top of white_block_1, so we'll need to remove it from there. This will automatically satisfy constraint 1.

Looking at constraint 2, we need to ensure that after removing yellow_block_1 from white_block_1, either white_block_2 is clear or white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1. Currently, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_2, so white_block_2 is not clear. We could either remove green_block_1 from white_block_2, making white_block_2 clear, or we could stack white_block_2 on top of green_block_1, which would require moving green_block_1 somewhere else first.

Constraint 3 is already satisfied, as mentioned.

For constraint 4, we need to put orange_block_1 on top of white_block_2 at some point.

For constraint 5, we need to put something on top of red_block_1 at some point.

For constraint 6, orange_block_1 is already not on top of red_block_1, so this constraint is satisfied.

For constraint 7, since orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1, we need to ensure that either orange_block_1 is not on the table or red_block_1 is not clear at some point. We've already established for constraint 5 that we need to put something on top of red_block_1, so if we do that, this constraint will be satisfied.

For constraint 8, we need to put something on top of both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 at some point.

Let's try to come up with a plan that satisfies all these constraints:

1. First, let's unstick yellow_block_1 from white_block_1, which will satisfy constraint 1:
   `unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1`

2. After unstacking, we need to ensure either white_block_2 is clear or white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1 to satisfy constraint 2. Let's clear white_block_2 by moving green_block_1:
   `putdown yellow_block_1` (since we're holding yellow_block_1 now)
   `pickup orange_block_1` (we'll need this for later)
   `stack orange_block_1 white_block_2` (satisfying constraint 4)

3. Now, for constraint 5 and part of constraint 7, we need to put something on top of red_block_1:
   `pickup orange_block_2`
   `stack orange_block_2 red_block_1`

4. For constraint 8, we need to put something on top of both green_block_1 and orange_block_1:
   `pickup white_block_1`
   `stack white_block_1 green_block_1`
   `pickup red_block_1` (with orange_block_2 on it)
   `stack red_block_1 orange_block_1`

But wait, that doesn't work because red_block_1 has orange_block_2 on it, so we can't pick it up. Let's rethink.

Let's see if we can come up with a different plan:

1. `unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1` (satisfying constraint 1)
2. `putdown yellow_block_1` (meeting the goal)
3. `unstack green_block_1 white_block_2` (now white_block_2 is clear, satisfying constraint 2)
4. `stack green_block_1 yellow_block_1` (needed for constraint 8)
5. `pickup orange_block_1`
6. `stack orange_block_1 white_block_2` (satisfying constraint 4)
7. `pickup orange_block_2`
8. `stack orange_block_2 green_block_1` (now green_block_1 is not clear, part of constraint 8)
9. `pickup red_block_1`
10. `stack red_block_1 orange_block_1` (now orange_block_1 is not clear, completing constraint 8, and also satisfying constraint 5)

But wait, there's a problem with step 4. We're stacking green_block_1 on yellow_block_1, which wasn't a constraint. In fact, there's a point where the condition "green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1" must hold.

Actually, I think I'm getting confused. Let's reread constraint 3:

3. At some point, "green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1" must be true.

In the initial state, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_2, not on top of yellow_block_1. So the statement "green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1" is true in the initial state, which satisfies constraint 3.

So, let's rethink our plan:

1. `unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1` (satisfying constraint 1)
2. `putdown yellow_block_1` (meeting the goal)
3. `unstack green_block_1 white_block_2` (now white_block_2 is clear, satisfying constraint 2)
4. `pickup orange_block_1`
5. `stack orange_block_1 white_block_2` (satisfying constraint 4)
6. `stack green_block_1 orange_block_1` (now orange_block_1 is not clear, part of constraint 8)
7. `pickup red_block_1`
8. `stack red_block_1 green_block_1` (now green_block_1 is not clear, completing constraint 8, and also satisfying constraint 5)

But I don't think this is right either. After step 5, we're still holding orange_block_1, so we can't immediately pickup green_block_1. I'm getting myself a bit confused. Let me redo this more carefully.

Let's trace through the plan step by step:

Initial state:
- white_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_2 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on top of white_block_2
- orange_block_2 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1, orange_block_1, green_block_1, orange_block_2, red_block_1 are all clear
- You're not holding any block

1. `unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1`:
   - This satisfies constraint 1, as yellow_block_1 is no longer on top of white_block_1.
   - For constraint 2, we need to ensure that either white_block_2 is clear or white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1. Currently, neither is true.
   - After this action, we're holding yellow_block_1.

2. `putdown yellow_block_1`:
   - This achieves the goal.
   - After this action, we're not holding any block.

3. `unstack green_block_1 white_block_2`:
   - Now, white_block_2 is clear, satisfying constraint 2.
   - After this action, we're holding green_block_1.

4. `stack green_block_1 orange_block_1`:
   - This puts green_block_1 on top of orange_block_1, making orange_block_1 not clear, which is part of constraint 8.
   - After this action, we're not holding any block.

5. `pickup white_block_2`:
   - This is just a step to help us get to the next action.
   - After this action, we're holding white_block_2.

6. `stack white_block_2 green_block_1`:
   - This puts something on top of green_block_1, making it not clear, which completes constraint 8.
   - After this action, we're not holding any block.

7. `pickup orange_block_2`:
   - Another intermediate step.
   - After this action, we're holding orange_block_2.

8. `stack orange_block_2 red_block_1`:
   - This puts something on top of red_block_1, making it not clear, which satisfies constraint 5.
   - For constraint 7, we need to ensure that either orange_block_1 is not on the table or red_block_1 is not clear. Now, red_block_1 is not clear, so this constraint is satisfied.
   - After this action, we're not holding any block.

Now, let's check constraint 4, which I missed: If "green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1" holds in a state s, then at s or after it, "orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2" must be true.

The condition "green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1" is true in the initial state. But in our plan, orange_block_1 never gets put on top of white_block_2. So, we're not satisfying constraint 4. We need to adjust our plan.

Let's revise:

1. `unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1`:
   - Satisfies constraint 1.
   - After this action, we're holding yellow_block_1.

2. `putdown yellow_block_1`:
   - Achieves the goal.
   - After this action, we're not holding any block.

3. `unstack green_block_1 white_block_2`:
   - Now, white_block_2 is clear, satisfying constraint 2.
   - After this action, we're holding green_block_1.

4. `putdown green_block_1`:
   - Just an intermediate step.
   - After this action, we're not holding any block.

5. `pickup orange_block_1`:
   - Intermediate step.
   - After this action, we're holding orange_block_1.

6. `stack orange_block_1 white_block_2`:
   - This satisfies constraint 4.
   - After this action, we're not holding any block.

7. `pickup orange_block_2`:
   - Intermediate step.
   - After this action, we're holding orange_block_2.

8. `stack orange_block_2 green_block_1`:
   - This makes green_block_1 not clear, part of constraint 8.
   - After this action, we're not holding any block.

9. `pickup red_block_1`:
   - Intermediate step.
   - After this action, we're holding red_block_1.

10. `stack red_block_1 orange_block_1`:
    - This makes orange_block_1 not clear, completing constraint 8.
    - It also makes red_block_1 off the table, which is relevant for constraint 7.
    - After this action, we're not holding any block.

11. `pickup white_block_1`:
    - Intermediate step.
    - After this action, we're holding white_block_1.

12. `stack white_block_1 red_block_1`:
    - This makes red_block_1 not clear, which satisfies constraint 5.
    - After this action, we're not holding any block.

But wait, I'm getting confused again. In step 10, red_block_1 is not on the table, but it is not stacked on anything. I can't do this. Let me revise again.

I think I'm overcomplicating. Let's simplify and try once more.

Initial state (simplified):
- white_block_1 on table, yellow_block_1 on it.
- white_block_2 on table, green_block_1 on it.
- orange_block_1, orange_block_2, red_block_1 all on table.
- All blocks clear except white_block_1 and white_block_2.

Goal:
- yellow_block_1 on table.

Constraints (simplified):
1. yellow_block_1 must not be on white_block_1 at some point.
2. After satisfying 1, either white_block_2 must be clear or white_block_2 must be on green_block_1.
3. green_block_1 must not be on yellow_block_1 at some point (already true in initial state).
4. After satisfying 3, orange_block_1 must be on white_block_2.
5. red_block_1 must not be clear at some point.
6. orange_block_1 must not be on red_block_1 at some point (already true in initial state).
7. After satisfying 6, either orange_block_1 must not be on table or red_block_1 must not be clear.
8. At some point, both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 must not be clear.

Now, let's trace a new plan:

1. `unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1`:
   - Satisfies constraint 1.
   - After this action, we're holding yellow_block_1.

2. `putdown yellow_block_1`:
   - Achieves the goal.
   - After this action, we're not holding any block.

3. `unstack green_block_1 white_block_2`:
   - white_block_2 is now clear, which satisfies constraint 2.
   - Constraint 3 is already satisfied in the initial state.
   - After this action, we're holding green_block_1.

4. `putdown green_block_1`:
   - Just an intermediate step.
   - After this action, we're not holding any block.

5. `pickup orange_block_1`:
   - Intermediate step.
   - After this action, we're holding orange_block_1.

6. `stack orange_block_1 white_block_2`:
   - This satisfies constraint 4.
   - After this action, we're not holding any block.

7. `pickup orange_block_2`:
   - Intermediate step.
   - After this action, we're holding orange_block_2.

8. `stack orange_block_2 green_block_1`:
   - This makes green_block_1 not clear, which is part of constraint 8.
   - After this action, we're not holding any block.

9. `pickup white_block_1`:
   - Intermediate step.
   - After this action, we're holding white_block_1.

10. `stack white_block_1 orange_block_1`:
    - This makes orange_block_1 not clear, which completes constraint 8.
    - After this action, we're not holding any block.

Constraint 5 requires that red_block_1 must not be clear at some point. Constraint 7 requires that either orange_block_1 must not be on the table or red_block_1 must not be clear. Orange_block_1 is now on white_block_2, so it's not on the table, which satisfies constraint 7. But we still need to satisfy constraint 5. Let's add a step:

11. `pickup yellow_block_1`:
    - Intermediate step.
    - After this action, we're holding yellow_block_1.

12. `stack yellow_block_1 red_block_1`:
    - This makes red_block_1 not clear, which satisfies constraint 5.
    - After this action, we're not holding any block.

Now, let me trace through the plan once more to ensure all constraints are satisfied:

1. Initial state: yellow_block_1 on white_block_1, green_block_1 on white_block_2, rest on table. All clear except white_block_1 and white_block_2.
2. After `unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1`: Holding yellow_block_1. This satisfies constraint 1.
3. After `putdown yellow_block_1`: yellow_block_1 on table, which is the goal.
4. After `unstack green_block_1 white_block_2`: Holding green_block_1. white_block_2 is now clear, satisfying constraint 2.
5. After `putdown green_block_1`: green_block_1 on table.
6. After `pickup orange_block_1`: Holding orange_block_1.
7. After `stack orange_block_1 white_block_2`: orange_block_1 on white_block_2, satisfying constraint 4.
8. After `pickup orange_block_2`: Holding orange_block_2.
9. After `stack orange_block_2 green_block_1`: orange_block_2 on green_block_1, making green_block_1 not clear (part of constraint 8).
10. After `pickup white_block_1`: Holding white_block_1.
11. After `stack white_block_1 orange_block_1`: white_block_1 on orange_block_1, making orange_block_1 not clear (completing constraint 8).
12. After `pickup yellow_block_1`: Holding yellow_block_1.
13. After `stack yellow_block_1 red_block_1`: yellow_block_1 on red_block_1, making red_block_1 not clear, satisfying constraint 5.

Now, let's double-check to ensure all constraints are satisfied:

1. ✅ yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 (satisfied in step 2).
2. ✅ After yellow_block_1 is not on white_block_1, white_block_2 is clear (satisfied in step 4).
3. ✅ green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1 (satisfied in the initial state).
4. ✅ After green_block_1 is not on yellow_block_1, orange_block_1 is on white_block_2 (satisfied in step 7).
5. ✅ red_block_1 is not clear (satisfied in step 13).
6. ✅ orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1 (satisfied in the initial state).
7. ✅ After orange_block_1 is not on red_block_1, orange_block_1 is not on the table (satisfied in step 7).
8. ✅ Both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 are not clear (satisfied in steps 9 and 11).

Alright, this plan seems to satisfy all constraints and achieve the goal. Let me finalize it.

Optimal Plan:
1. `unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1`
2. `putdown yellow_block_1`
3. `unstack green_block_1 white_block_2`
4. `putdown green_block_1`
5. `pickup orange_block_1`
6. `stack orange_block_1 white_block_2`
7. `pickup orange_block_2`
8. `stack orange_block_2 green_block_1`
9. `pickup white_block_1`
10. `stack white_block_1 orange_block_1`
11. `pickup yellow_block_1`
12. `stack yellow_block_1 red_block_1`

But wait, this is not optimal yet. Let me refine it. In steps 11-12, we actually don't need to move yellow_block_1 from the table to red_block_1 if our goal is to have yellow_block_1 on the table. Let's optimize further.

We could move any other block to red_block_1 to satisfy constraint 5. For instance, we could move white_block_1 or orange_block_2 to red_block_1 instead of yellow_block_1. Let's revise:

Optimal Plan (revised):
1. `unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1`
2. `putdown yellow_block_1`
3. `unstack green_block_1 white_block_2`
4. `putdown green_block_1`
5. `pickup orange_block_1`
6. `stack orange_block_1 white_block_2`
7. `pickup orange_block_2`
8. `stack orange_block_2 green_block_1`
9. `pickup white_block_1`
10. `stack white_block_1 red_block_1`
11. `pickup yellow_block_1`
12. `stack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1`

But this doesn't make sense either, because why would we pick up yellow_block_1 from the table if our goal is to have it on the table?

Let's try once more:

1. `unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1`
2. `putdown yellow_block_1`
3. `unstack green_block_1 white_block_2`
4. `putdown green_block_1`
5. `pickup orange_block_1`
6. `stack orange_block_1 white_block_2`
7. `pickup orange_block_2`
8. `stack orange_block_2 red_block_1`
9. `pickup white_block_1`
10. `stack white_block_1 orange_block_1`
11. `pickup green_block_1`
12. `stack green_block_1 orange_block_2`

This seems to achieve the goal and satisfy all constraints:

1. ✅ yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 (satisfied in step 2).
2. ✅ After yellow_block_1 is not on white_block_1, white_block_2 is clear (satisfied in step 4).
3. ✅ green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1 (satisfied in the initial state).
4. ✅ After green_block_1 is not on yellow_block_1, orange_block_1 is on white_block_2 (satisfied in step 6).
5. ✅ red_block_1 is not clear (satisfied in step 8).
6. ✅ orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1 (satisfied in the initial state).
7. ✅ After orange_block_1 is not on red_block_1, orange_block_1 is not on the table (satisfied in step 6).
8. ✅ Both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 are not clear (satisfied in steps 12 and 10).

But I see that I didn't check if this plan is optimal. Let's see if we can simplify it further.

I think I can optimize step 12. Instead of stacking green_block_1 on orange_block_2, we could stack it directly on orange_block_1, making orange_block_1 not clear and eliminating the need for step 10. But then, what would I do with white_block_1?

Let's revise once more:

1. `unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1`
2. `putdown yellow_block_1`
3. `unstack green_block_1 white_block_2`
4. `stack green_block_1 white_block_1`
5. `pickup orange_block_1`
6. `stack orange_block_1 white_block_2`
7. `pickup orange_block_2`
8. `stack orange_block_2 red_block_1`
9. `pickup white_block_1`
10. `stack white_block_1 orange_block_1`

This seems to achieve the goal and satisfy all constraints while also being more efficient.

Actually, let's check our optimization once more. Are there any redundant steps in our plan?

1. `unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1` - Necessary to satisfy constraint 1 and achieve the goal.
2. `putdown yellow_block_1` - Necessary to achieve the goal.
3. `unstack green_block_1 white_block_2` - Necessary to satisfy constraint 2.
4. `stack green_block_1 white_block_1` - Intermediate step.
5. `pickup orange_block_1` - Necessary for constraint 4.
6. `stack orange_block_1 white_block_2` - Necessary for constraint 4.
7. `pickup orange_block_2` - Necessary for constraint 5.
8. `stack orange_block_2 red_block_1` - Necessary for constraint 5.
9. `pickup white_block_1` - Intermediate step.
10. `stack white_block_1 orange_block_1` - Necessary for constraint 8.

Wait, after step 4, green_block_1 is on white_block_1, and orange_block_1 is now not clear. But constraint 8 requires both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 to be not clear. After step 4, green_block_1 is clear. So, we need another block on top of green_block_1.

I'm realizing that the constraints are a bit more interconnected than I initially thought. Let's redo this once more, very carefully.

Let me label the constraints:

A. yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 at some point.
B. After A, either white_block_2 is clear or white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1.
C. green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1 at some point.
D. After C, orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2.
E. red_block_1 is not clear at some point.
F. orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1 at some point.
G. After F, either orange_block_1 is not on the table or red_block_1 is not clear.
H. Both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 are not clear at some point.

Initial state:
- white_block_1 on table, yellow_block_1 on it. (white_block_1 not clear, yellow_block_1 clear)
- white_block_2 on table, green_block_1 on it. (white_block_2 not clear, green_block_1 clear)
- orange_block_1, orange_block_2, red_block_1 all on table, all clear.

Step 1: `unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1`
   - After this: yellow_block_1 is not on white_block_1, satisfying constraint A.
   - We're holding yellow_block_1.

Step 2: `putdown yellow_block_1`
   - After this: yellow_block_1 is on the table, which is our goal.
   - We're not holding anything.

Step 3: `unstack green_block_1 white_block_2`
   - After this: white_block_2 is clear, satisfying constraint B.
   - We're holding green_block_1.

Now, constraint C is already satisfied in the initial state, so we need to ensure orange_block_1 is on white_block_2 at some point (constraint D):

Step 4: `putdown green_block_1`
   - After this: green_block_1 is on the table.
   - We're not holding anything.

Step 5: `pickup orange_block_1`
   - After this: We're holding orange_block_1.

Step 6: `stack orange_block_1 white_block_2`
   - After this: orange_block_1 is on white_block_2, satisfying constraint D.
   - We're not holding anything.

Now, constraint F is already satisfied, but we need to ensure that either orange_block_1 is not on the table or red_block_1 is not clear (constraint G). Orange_block_1 is now on white_block_2, so it's not on the table, satisfying constraint G.

Next, we need to satisfy constraint E, ensuring red_block_1 is not clear at some point:

Step 7: `pickup orange_block_2`
   - After this: We're holding orange_block_2.

Step 8: `stack orange_block_2 red_block_1`
   - After this: red_block_1 is not clear, satisfying constraint E.
   - We're not holding anything.

Finally, we need to satisfy constraint H, ensuring both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 are not clear at some point. Orange_block_1 is on white_block_2, and green_block_1 is on the table, both clear. We need to put something on both:

Step 9: `pickup white_block_1`
   - After this: We're holding white_block_1.

Step 10: `stack white_block_1 orange_block_1`
   - After this: orange_block_1 is not clear.
   - We're not holding anything.

Step 11: `pickup yellow_block_1`
   - After this: We're holding yellow_block_1.

Step 12: `stack yellow_block_1 green_block_1`
   - After this: green_block_1 is not clear.
   - We're not holding anything.

At this point, we have achieved the goal, we've satisfied all constraints, and both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 are not clear. But, yellow_block_1 is no longer on the table, which contradicts our goal.

This is quite complex. Let's think about it differently. Maybe we don't need to have yellow_block_1 on top of green_block_1. We could use any other block for that.

1. `unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1`
2. `putdown yellow_block_1`
3. `unstack green_block_1 white_block_2`
4. `putdown green_block_1`
5. `pickup orange_block_1`
6. `stack orange_block_1 white_block_2`
7. `pickup orange_block_2`
8. `stack orange_block_2 red_block_1`
9. `pickup white_block_1`
10. `stack white_block_1 orange_block_1`
11. `stack green_block_1 white_block_1`

Oops, I can't do step 11 because we're not holding green_block_1. Let me restart.

1. `unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1`
2. `putdown yellow_block_1`
3. `unstack green_block_1 white_block_2`
4. `putdown green_block_1`
5. `pickup orange_block_1`
6. `stack orange_block_1 white_block_2`
7. `pickup orange_block_2`
8. `stack orange_block_2 red_block_1`
9. `pickup white_block_1`
10. `stack white_block_1 orange_block_1`
11. `pickup green_block_1`
12. `stack green_block_1 white_block_1`

Now, both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 are not clear, satisfying constraint H. And, yellow_block_1 is on the table, which is our goal. Let's verify all constraints:

A. ✅ yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 (satisfied in step 2).
B. ✅ After A, white_block_2 is clear (satisfied in step 3).
C. ✅ green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1 (satisfied in the initial state).
D. ✅ After C, orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2 (satisfied in step 6).
E. ✅ red_block_1 is not clear (satisfied in step 8).
F. ✅ orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1 (satisfied in the initial state).
G. ✅ After F, orange_block_1 is not on the table (satisfied in step 6).
H. ✅ Both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 are not clear (satisfied in steps 10 and 12).

I think this is a valid and optimal plan. But let me double check one more time if all the constraints are satisfied:

For constraint A, we need "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" to be true at some point. This is satisfied in step 2 after we putdown yellow_block_1.

For constraint B, after step 2, we need to ensure that "white_block_2 is clear" or "white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" is true. After step 3, white_block_2 is indeed clear, so this constraint is satisfied.

For constraint C, we need "green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1" to be true at some point. This is true in the initial state and throughout the plan, so this constraint is satisfied.

For constraint D, since the condition for C is true, we need to ensure "orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2" at some point. After step 6, orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2, so this constraint is satisfied.

For constraint E, we need "red_block_1 is not clear" to be true at some point. After step 8, red_block_1 has orange_block_2 on top of it, so it's not clear. This constraint is satisfied.

For constraint F, we need "orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1" to be true at some point. This is true in the initial state and throughout the plan, so this constraint is satisfied.

For constraint G, since the condition for F is true, we need to ensure "orange_block_1 is not on the table" or "red_block_1 is not clear" at some point. After step 6, orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2, so it's not on the table. After step 8, red_block_1 is not clear. Both of these individual conditions are true, so this constraint is satisfied.

For constraint H, we need "green_block_1 is not clear" and "orange_block_1 is not clear" to be true at the same time. After step 12, green_block_1 has white_block_1 on top of it, and orange_block_1 has white_block_1 on top of it. Both are not clear at the same... wait, this doesn't sound right. Let me double-check.

After step 10, orange_block_1 has white_block_1 on top of it, so it's not clear. But we can't have white_block_1 on top of both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 at the same time. So, the constraint H is not satisfied with this plan. Let me re-think.

Constraint H requires "the following conditions are all true: there is a block on top of green_block_1, i.e., green_block_1 is not clear, there is a block on top of orange_block_1, i.e., orange_block_1 is not clear".

Let me revise the plan to satisfy this:

1. `unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1`
2. `putdown yellow_block_1`
3. `unstack green_block_1 white_block_2`
4. `putdown green_block_1`
5. `pickup orange_block_1`
6. `stack orange_block_1 white_block_2`
7. `pickup orange_block_2`
8. `stack orange_block_2 red_block_1`
9. `pickup white_block_1`
10. `stack white_block_1 orange_block_1`
11. `pickup red_block_1`
12. `stack red_block_1 green_block_1`

But wait, step 11 is impossible because red_block_1 has orange_block_2 on top of it, making it not clear.

Let's try a different approach:

1. `unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1`
2. `putdown yellow_block_1`
3. `unstack green_block_1 white_block_2`
4. `putdown green_block_1`
5. `pickup orange_block_1`
6. `stack orange_block_1 white_block_2`
7. `pickup white_block_1`
8. `stack white_block_1 red_block_1`
9. `pickup orange_block_2`
10. `stack orange_block_2 orange_block_1`
11. `pickup yellow_block_1`
12. `stack yellow_block_1 green_block_1`

Now, both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 are not clear, with yellow_block_1 on top of green_block_1 and orange_block_2 on top of orange_block_1. But this contradicts our goal, as yellow_block_1 is not on the table at the end.

This is tricky! The constraints are quite interconnected. Let's rethink:

1. `unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1`
2. `putdown yellow_block_1`
3. `unstack green_block_1 white_block_2`
4. `stack green_block_1 yellow_block_1`
5. `pickup orange_block_1`
6. `stack orange_block_1 white_block_2`
7. `pickup orange_block_2`
8. `stack orange_block_2 green_block_1`
9. `pickup white_block_1`
10. `stack white_block_1 orange_block_1`

After this, green_block_1 is not clear (it has orange_block_2 on it) and orange_block_1 is not clear (it has white_block_1 on it). All constraints are satisfied. But, yellow_block_1 is not on the table at the end; it's under green_block_1. This contradicts our goal.

Let's try to think from scratch again:

1. `unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1`
2. `stack yellow_block_1 orange_block_2`
3. `unstack green_block_1 white_block_2`
4. `stack green_block_1 orange_block_1`
5. `pickup white_block_1`
6. `stack white_block_1 red_block_1`
7. `pickup yellow_block_1`
8. `putdown yellow_block_1`
9. `pickup orange_block_2`
10. `stack orange_block_2 green_block_1`

After this, both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 are not clear. And, yellow_block_1 is on the table, which is our goal. But constraint D is not satisfied because orange_block_1 is never on top of white_block_2.

Let me think more carefully about the constraints:

A. yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 at some point.
B. After A, either white_block_2 is clear or white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1.
C. green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1 at some point.
D. After C, orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2.
E. red_block_1 is not clear at some point.
F. orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1 at some point.
G. After F, either orange_block_1 is not on the table or red_block_1 is not clear.
H. Both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 are not clear at some point.

I'm starting to think that constraints D and H might be in conflict. Constraint D requires orange_block_1 to be on white_block_2, while constraint H requires both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 to have something on top of them. If orange_block_1 is on white_block_2, then who can be on top of orange_block_1? It can't be green_block_1, because green_block_1 must have something on top of it, too.

Let's see if I can resolve this:

1. `unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1` (Satisfies A)
2. `stack yellow_block_1 green_block_1` (Now green_block_1 has something on top)
3. `unstack green_block_1 white_block_2` (Satisfies B)
4. `pickup orange_block_1` (Preparing for D)
5. `stack orange_block_1 white_block_2` (Satisfies D)
6. `pickup white_block_1` (Preparing for H)
7. `stack white_block_1 orange_block_1` (Now orange_block_1 has something on top)
8. `unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1` (Preparing for the goal)
9. `putdown yellow_block_1` (Achieves the goal)
10. `pickup red_block_1` (Preparing for E)
11. `stack red_block_1 green_block_1` (Satisfies E)

At states after step 7 and before step 8, both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 are not clear, satisfying constraint H.

Let's verify all constraints in this plan:

A. ✅ yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 (satisfied in step 1).
B. ✅ After A, white_block_2 becomes clear (satisfied in step 3).
C. ✅ green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1 (satisfied in the initial state).
D. ✅ After C, orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2 (satisfied in step 5).
E. ✅ red_block_1 is not clear (satisfied in step 11).
F. ✅ orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1 (satisfied in the initial state).
G. ✅ After F, orange_block_1 is not on the table (satisfied in step 5).
H. ✅ Both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 are not clear (satisfied at the state after step 7 and before step 8).

This plan seems to satisfy all constraints and achieve the goal. However, I'm not convinced it's optimal. Do we need all 11 steps?

Let me try to optimize:

1. `unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1` (Satisfies A)
2. `stack yellow_block_1 green_block_1` (Now green_block_1 has something on top)
3. `unstack green_block_1 white_block_2` (Satisfies B)
4. `pickup orange_block_1` (Preparing for D)
5. `stack orange_block_1 white_block_2` (Satisfies D)
6. `pickup orange_block_2` (Preparing for G)
7. `stack orange_block_2 red_block_1` (Satisfies E and G)
8. `pickup white_block_1` (Preparing for H)
9. `stack white_block_1 orange_block_1` (Now orange_block_1 has something on top, satisfying H)
10. `unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1` (Preparing for the goal)
11. `putdown yellow_block_1` (Achieves the goal)

This has the same number of steps but seems to satisfy the constraints more elegantly. 

Actually, I can simplify further. Instead of steps 6-7, I could directly:

1. `unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1` (Satisfies A)
2. `stack yellow_block_1 green_block_1` (Now green_block_1 has something on top)
3. `unstack green_block_1 white_block_2` (Satisfies B)
4. `pickup orange_block_1` (Preparing for D)
5. `stack orange_block_1 white_block_2` (Satisfies D)
6. `pickup white_block_1` (Preparing for E and G)
7. `stack white_block_1 red_block_1` (Satisfies E and G)
8. `pickup orange_block_2` (Preparing for H)
9. `stack orange_block_2 orange_block_1` (Now orange_block_1 has something on top, satisfying H)
10. `unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1` (Preparing for the goal)
11. `putdown yellow_block_1` (Achieves the goal)

But wait, steps 6-7 use white_block_1, which would now be unavailable for step 9. Let me make sure it's coherent:

1. `unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1` (Satisfies A)
2. `stack yellow_block_1 green_block_1` (Now green_block_1 has something on top)
3. `unstack green_block_1 white_block_2` (Satisfies B)
4. `pickup orange_block_1` (Preparing for D)
5. `stack orange_block_1 white_block_2` (Satisfies D)
6. `pickup white_block_1` (Preparing for E and G)
7. `stack white_block_1 red_block_1` (Satisfies E and G)
8. `pickup orange_block_2` (Preparing for H)
9. `stack orange_block_2 orange_block_1` (Now orange_block_1 has something on top, satisfying H)
10. `unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1` (Preparing for the goal)
11. `putdown yellow_block_1` (Achieves the goal)

This seems coherent to me. Now, let's verify all constraints in this revised plan:

A. ✅ yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 (satisfied in step 1).
B. ✅ After A, white_block_2 becomes clear (satisfied in step 3).
C. ✅ green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1 (satisfied in the initial state).
D. ✅ After C, orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2 (satisfied in step 5).
E. ✅ red_block_1 is not clear (satisfied in step 7).
F. ✅ orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1 (satisfied in the initial state).
G. ✅ After F, red_block_1 is not clear (satisfied in step 7).
H. ✅ Both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 are not clear (satisfied at the state after step 9 and before step 10).

Verify one more time:

A. ✅ yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 at some point.
B. ✅ After A, either white_block_2 is clear or white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1.
C. ✅ green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1 at some point.
D. ✅ After C, orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2.
E. ✅ red_block_1 is not clear at some point.
F. ✅ orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1 at some point.
G. ✅ After F, either orange_block_1 is not on the table or red_block_1 is not clear.
H. ✅ Both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 are not clear at some point.

This plan seems to satisfy all constraints and achieve the goal. I think this is the optimal plan.

Let me try to optimize it a bit more. Maybe we don't need to unstack and putdown yellow_block_1 separately. We could instead use a different block to achieve the goal. But the goal is specifically for yellow_block_1 to be on the table, so I think these steps are necessary.

Final optimal plan:
1. `unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1`
2. `stack yellow_block_1 green_block_1`
3. `unstack green_block_1 white_block_2`
4. `pickup orange_block_1`
5. `stack orange_block_1 white_block_2`
6. `pickup white_block_1`
7. `stack white_block_1 red_block_1`
8. `pickup orange_block_2`
9. `stack orange_block_2 orange_block_1`
10. `unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1`
11. `putdown yellow_block_1`
