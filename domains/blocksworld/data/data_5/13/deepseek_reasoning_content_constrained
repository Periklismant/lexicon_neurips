Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to have the robotic arm holding the red_block_1. But there are several constraints to satisfy along the way. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the required conditions.

First, the initial setup:

- white_block_1 is on the table with red_block_1 on top of it. Since red_block_1 is clear, I can pick it up directly if needed.
- brown_block_1 is on the table and clear.
- yellow_block_1 has blue_block_1 on it, which in turn has brown_block_2 on top. So blue_block_1 is not clear, but brown_block_2 is clear.
- grey_block_1 is on the table and clear.

The goal is to be holding red_block_1. So, the straightforward action would be to unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1. But wait, let's check the preconditions for unstack. To unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1, red must be clear (which it is), the arm isn't holding anything (which it isn't), and red is on white (which it is). So unstack red_block_1 white_block_1 should work. That would make the arm hold red_block_1, achieving the goal. But wait, maybe the constraints complicate things.

Let's look at the constraints:

1. At least once, grey_block_1 isn't on blue_block_1. Initially, grey is on the table, so this is true. But maybe the constraint requires that this condition is true in some state, which it already is. However, the second part says if this condition holds in some state s, then yellow_block_1 must be on blue_block_1 in s or later. Since grey isn't on blue in the initial state, we need to ensure that yellow is on blue at some point. Wait, in the initial state, blue is on yellow, so yellow is under blue. So to have yellow on blue, we need to move blue off yellow first, then put yellow on blue. But this might complicate things. But the initial state already satisfies "grey not on blue", so we need to make sure that yellow is on blue at some point after that. But blue is on yellow, so maybe we need to reverse that. Hmm.

2. There must be a state where grey_block_1 is not clear (something is on top of it). So we need to place a block on grey at some point.

3. There must be a state where red_block_1 is not clear. So something must be placed on red_block_1.

4. If red_block_1 is not clear (condition holds), then there must be an earlier state where either white is on blue or yellow is clear. So before putting something on red, we need to have either white on blue or yellow clear. Initially, yellow is under blue, so yellow is not clear. So maybe we need to clear yellow first.

5. At least once, either yellow is not on the table or brown_block_2 is on the table. Currently, brown_block_2 is on blue, which is on yellow. So brown_block_2 is not on the table. Yellow is on the table. So to satisfy this, either move yellow off the table (stack it somewhere) or put brown_block_2 on the table.

6. At least once, white_block_1 is clear. Initially, white has red on it, so white is not clear. So we need to remove red from white, which is part of the goal. Wait, the goal is to hold red_block_1. So once we unstack red from white, white becomes clear. So that action would satisfy constraint 6. But then constraint 7 says, if white is clear at any state, there must be an earlier state where either red is not clear or yellow is on grey. So, after unstacking red from white (making white clear), we need to have had a prior state where either red had something on it or yellow was on grey.

So, putting this all together, the plan must include actions that satisfy all these constraints.

Let me outline the possible steps:

1. To achieve the goal: unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1. This gives us holding red_block_1, which is the goal. But we need to check if this action alone satisfies the constraints.

Wait, when we unstack red from white, the effect is that white becomes clear. So constraint 6 (white is clear) is satisfied in the resulting state. But according to constraint 7, this requires that in an earlier state (before white becomes clear), either red was not clear (which it wasn't initially; red was clear) or yellow was on grey. But initially, yellow is under blue, so yellow is not on grey. So this would violate constraint 7 unless we first make either red not clear or put yellow on grey.

So, if we unstack red first, then white becomes clear, but the prior state (initial) doesn't have red not clear or yellow on grey. So this would fail constraint 7. Therefore, we need to first create a state where either red is not clear (by putting something on it) or yellow is on grey, and then unstack red.

But the goal is to hold red, which would require that red is clear again when we unstack it. So putting something on red would block that unless we remove it again. So this complicates things.

Alternative approach:

- First, stack something on red_block_1 (making red not clear), then later unstack it. But to stack on red, we need to have another block. Let's see available blocks. Maybe use brown_block_1 or grey_block_1. For example, pick up brown_block_1 and stack it on red_block_1. But to do that, we need to have the arm empty. So:

Action: pickup brown_block_1 (since it's on table and clear). Then stack brown_block_1 red_block_1. Now red has brown on top, making red not clear. This satisfies constraint 3 (there's a block on red). Then, to unstack brown from red, we need to unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1, which would require that brown is clear. But after stacking, brown is on red, and if nothing else is on brown, then unstacking is possible. Then, after unstacking brown, we can then unstack red from white.

But this adds steps. Let's see how this affects other constraints.

By stacking brown on red, red is not clear. Now, constraint 4 requires that before this state (where red is not clear), there was a state where either white is on blue or yellow is clear. Let's check the initial state: yellow is under blue, so not clear. So we need to make yellow clear. To do that, we have to unstack blue from yellow. Because blue is under brown_block_2. So first, we need to unstack brown_block_2 from blue_block_1, then unstack blue from yellow, making yellow clear. Then, stack brown_block_1 on red_block_1. That way, when we stack brown on red (making red not clear), the prior state had yellow clear (from unstacking blue), satisfying constraint 4.

This is getting complex. Let's outline possible steps:

1. Unstack brown_block_2 from blue_block_1. Preconditions: brown_block_2 is clear (it is), arm is empty. So unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1. Now holding brown_block_2, blue_block_1 becomes clear.

2. Putdown brown_block_2 on table. Now brown_block_2 is on table, clear.

3. Unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1. Now blue is clear (since brown_block_2 was removed). So unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1. Now holding blue_block_1.

4. Putdown blue_block_1. Now blue is on table, clear.

5. Now, yellow_block_1 is clear. So constraint 4's condition (yellow is clear) is satisfied. Now, stack brown_block_1 on red_block_1. But first, need to pickup brown_block_1 (on table, clear).

6. Pickup brown_block_1.

7. Stack brown_block_1 red_block_1. Now red_block_1 is not clear (satisfies constraint 3), and brown_block_1 is on red. Also, after stacking, brown_block_1 is clear, red is not.

But we need to ensure that when we stack brown on red, the prior state had yellow clear. Which step 5 achieved. So that satisfies constraint 4.

Then, to get red into hand, we need to unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1. So:

8. Unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1. Now holding brown_block_1, red_block_1 becomes clear.

9. Putdown brown_block_1.

10. Now, unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1. Now holding red_block_1, achieving the goal.

But this plan has 10 steps. Let's check if all constraints are met:

- Constraint 1: grey not on blue. Initially true. Then after any step, unless we stack grey on blue, which we don't. So this remains true. But we need to ensure that yellow is on blue at some point. Currently, after step 4, blue is on table. To get yellow on blue, need to stack yellow on blue. But blue is on table, so possible. However, the constraint says that if grey is not on blue (which it is in the initial state and throughout unless we stack grey on blue), then yellow must be on blue at some point. So we need to stack yellow on blue. Let's see when.

After step 4, blue is on table. If we stack yellow on blue, but yellow is on the table (after step 4, when we unstacked blue from yellow, yellow is on table and clear). Wait, no. Wait, initial state: yellow is on table, blue is on yellow. Then, step 3: unstack blue from yellow. So after step 3, yellow is on table, clear. So step 3 makes yellow clear. Then step 4 puts blue on table. So to stack yellow on blue, we can:

After step 4, pickup yellow (since it's on table and clear), then stack it on blue. But the arm is holding blue after step 3. Wait, no: step 3 is unstack blue from yellow, so after that, the arm is holding blue. Then step 4 is putdown blue. So after step 4, blue is on table, and yellow is on table. So to stack yellow on blue, need to pickup yellow and stack on blue.

So insert steps:

After step 4 (putdown blue):

5. Pickup yellow_block_1.

6. Stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1.

Then, proceed to handle brown_block_1.

This would satisfy the constraint that yellow is on blue after grey not on blue. But this adds steps. But this is necessary to meet constraint 1's implication.

So now, the plan would be:

1. unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1

2. putdown brown_block_2

3. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1

4. putdown blue_block_1

5. pickup yellow_block_1

6. stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1

Now, after step 6, yellow is on blue. So the constraint that when grey is not on blue (which is true), yellow must be on blue in some state after. This is satisfied.

Then continue with:

7. pickup brown_block_1

8. stack brown_block_1 red_block_1 (now red is not clear, satisfying constraint 3)

Now, before this step (step 8), in step 6, yellow was on blue, which satisfies the implication for constraint 1.

Then:

9. unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1

10. putdown brown_block_1

11. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1 (achieve goal)

Now, check other constraints:

- Constraint 2: grey must have a block on top at some state. Currently, grey is on table, clear. We need to put something on grey. Let's see when. Maybe after step 10, put brown_block_1 on grey_block_1. So between step 10 and 11:

After step 10, brown_block_1 is on table. So:

10. putdown brown_block_1

11. pickup brown_block_1

12. stack brown_block_1 grey_block_1 (now grey has brown on top, satisfying constraint 2)

But then step 13 would be unstack red_block_1 white_block_1.

But this adds more steps. Alternatively, perhaps after step 8 (stack brown on red), we can use another block to stack on grey.

Alternatively, use brown_block_2. After step 2, brown_block_2 is on table. So after step 2, we could pick up brown_block_2 and stack on grey. Let's see:

After step 2 (putdown brown_block_2), step 3 is unstack blue from yellow. Then step 4 putdown blue. Step 5 pickup yellow, step 6 stack yellow on blue. Then, step 7 could be pickup brown_block_2 and stack on grey. Let's adjust:

After step 6 (stack yellow on blue):

7. pickup brown_block_2 (which is on table and clear)

8. stack brown_block_2 grey_block_1 (now grey has brown_block_2 on top, satisfying constraint 2)

Then proceed with:

9. pickup brown_block_1 (needs to be clear; initially, brown_block_1 is clear, but after step 8, is brown_block_1 still clear? Wait, brown_block_1 was on table, clear. Stacking brown_block_2 on grey doesn't affect brown_block_1. So yes, step 9: pickup brown_block_1.

10. stack brown_block_1 red_block_1.

Then steps to unstack brown_block_1 from red, etc.

This way, we satisfy constraint 2 by having brown_block_2 on grey.

Additionally, we need to check constraint 5: at least once, yellow is not on table or brown_block_2 is on table. After step 6, yellow is on blue (not on table), so that satisfies the first part of the OR. So that's covered.

Constraint 6: white_block_1 must be clear at some state. That happens when we unstack red from white in step 11 (or whatever step it is now). But we need to ensure that before that, we had either red not clear (which we did in step 10, after stacking brown on red) or yellow on grey. Wait, in step 8, we stacked brown_block_2 on grey. So yellow is on blue, not on grey. So the prior state for white becoming clear (step 11) must have had either red not clear (which it was in step 10) or yellow on grey. Since red was not clear in step 10, that satisfies the antecedent. So constraint 7 is satisfied.

Putting it all together:

1. unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1

2. putdown brown_block_2

3. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1

4. putdown blue_block_1

5. pickup yellow_block_1

6. stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1

7. pickup brown_block_2

8. stack brown_block_2 grey_block_1

9. pickup brown_block_1

10. stack brown_block_1 red_block_1

11. unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1

12. putdown brown_block_1

13. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1

Now, let's check if all constraints are met:

- Constraint 1: grey not on blue. Initially true. Then, after step 6, yellow is on blue, so grey still not on blue. So the condition is met, and we have yellow on blue in step 6, which satisfies the implication.

- Constraint 2: grey has a block on top (step 8).

- Constraint 3: red has a block on top (step 10).

- Constraint 4: when red is not clear (step 10), earlier state (step 6) had yellow on blue (which is not part of the required conditions, but earlier steps had yellow clear (step 5, after unstacking blue from yellow). Wait, the required condition for constraint 4 is that before red is not clear (step 10), there's an earlier state where white is on blue or yellow is clear. 

Looking back at constraint 4: 

"If expression "there is a block on top of red_block_1..." holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state where either "white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1" or "yellow is clear".

In our plan:

- The state after step 10 has red not clear.

- Prior states: step 6 (yellow on blue), step 5 (yellow picked up, so yellow was clear in step 5 after pickup. Wait, when you pickup yellow, you need to unstack it if it's under something. Wait, no. Initially, yellow is on table with blue on it. Step 3 is unstack blue from yellow, so after step 3, yellow is on table and clear. Then step 5 is pickup yellow (which is possible because yellow is clear and on table). So after step 3, yellow is clear. Then step 5 picks it up. So step 3's effect makes yellow clear, which is before step 10. So the condition for constraint 4 is satisfied because in step 3, yellow becomes clear, which is before step 10.

So constraint 4 is met because before red is not clear (step 10), there was a state (step 3) where yellow is clear.

- Constraint 5: At least once, yellow is not on table or brown_block_2 is on table. After step 6, yellow is on blue, so not on table. So satisfied.

- Constraint 6: white_block_1 must be clear. This happens in step 13 when red is unstacked, making white clear. 

- Constraint 7: If white is clear (step 13), there must be an earlier state where either red is not clear (step 10) or yellow is on grey. In the plan, step 10 has red not clear, which is before step 13. So this is satisfied.

So all constraints are met. Now, checking the plan's steps:

1. unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1

2. putdown brown_block_2

3. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1

4. putdown blue_block_1

5. pickup yellow_block_1

6. stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1

7. pickup brown_block_2

8. stack brown_block_2 grey_block_1

9. pickup brown_block_1

10. stack brown_block_1 red_block_1

11. unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1

12. putdown brown_block_1

13. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1

Is this the minimal steps? Let's see if any steps can be eliminated.

For example, after step 8 (stack brown_block_2 on grey), could we use brown_block_2 again? But in step 7, we pick up brown_block_2 and stack it on grey. Then step 9 picks up brown_block_1. So that seems necessary.

Alternatively, maybe after step 10, when we unstack brown_block_1 from red, can we stack it somewhere else instead of putting it down, but that might not help.

Alternatively, after step 6 (stack yellow on blue), can we proceed differently? Maybe not. Because we need yellow on blue to satisfy the implication from constraint 1.

Another possibility: Could we avoid stacking yellow on blue? Because initially, grey is not on blue, and the constraint requires that if grey is not on blue, then yellow must be on blue at some point. So we have to do that step.

Alternatively, after putting down blue_block_1 (step 4), stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_1 again? No, that wouldn't help. The key is to have yellow on blue.

Alternatively, stack another block on blue, but the constraint requires yellow on blue. So it's mandatory.

So the steps are necessary. Therefore, the plan is as above. But let me count the steps: 13 actions. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, what if after step 3 (unstack blue from yellow), instead of putting blue down (step 4), stack blue on grey_block_1. Then, grey has blue on top, which satisfies constraint 2 (grey not clear). Then, yellow is clear (from step 3), which could help with constraint 4.

Let's try:

Alternative plan:

1. unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1

2. putdown brown_block_2

3. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1 (holding blue)

4. stack blue_block_1 grey_block_1 (now grey has blue, satisfying constraint 2)

This step requires that blue is held and grey is clear. Initially, grey is clear. So yes.

After step 4, blue is on grey. Then, yellow is clear (from step 3). Now, need to stack yellow on blue (which is on grey) to satisfy constraint 1's implication.

But blue is on grey, so stacking yellow on blue would require picking up yellow (step 5: pickup yellow), stack yellow on blue (step 6: stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1). But blue is on grey, so after stacking, yellow is on blue, which is on grey. This would make yellow not on table, satisfying constraint 5.

But then, after that, proceed to handle brown_block_1 and red_block_1.

But let's see:

After step 4:

- blue is on grey.

- yellow is on table and clear.

Step 5: pickup yellow.

Step 6: stack yellow on blue (now on grey). So yellow is on blue, which is on grey.

Now, constraint 1's implication is satisfied: since grey is not on blue (grey has blue on it), but wait, grey has blue on it. So grey is not on blue, but blue is on grey. The constraint is "grey not on blue", which is true, and we have yellow on blue (which is on grey) in step 6. So that's okay.

Then proceed:

7. pickup brown_block_1 (on table and clear)

8. stack brown_block_1 red_block_1 (now red not clear)

But before stacking on red, we need to ensure that the prior state satisfies constraint 4 (either white on blue or yellow clear). At step 6, yellow is stacked on blue, which is on grey. So yellow is not clear. So we need to have white on blue or yellow clear. But in step 3, after unstacking blue from yellow, yellow was clear (step 3's effect). So before step 8 (stacking brown on red), the prior state where yellow was clear is step 3. So that satisfies constraint 4.

Then:

9. unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1

10. putdown brown_block_1

11. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1 (achieve goal)

Now, this plan has 11 steps. Let's check constraints:

- Constraint 2: grey has blue on it (step 4), so satisfied.

- Constraint 5: yellow is not on table (step 6 onwards), so satisfied.

- Constraint 1: after step 4, grey is not on blue (since grey has blue on it, but blue is on grey, which is a different thing. The constraint is "grey_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1". So initially, grey is on table, blue is on yellow. After step 4, blue is on grey, so grey is not on blue. So the condition holds, and in step 6, yellow is on blue (which is on grey). So the implication is satisfied.

This alternative plan seems shorter, with 11 steps. Let's count:

1. unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1

2. putdown brown_block_2

3. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1

4. stack blue_block_1 grey_block_1

5. pickup yellow_block_1

6. stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1

7. pickup brown_block_1

8. stack brown_block_1 red_block_1

9. unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1

10. putdown brown_block_1

11. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1

This is 11 steps, which is better. Let's check all constraints again:

- Constraint 1: grey is not on blue (true in initial and all steps). The implication requires that yellow is on blue at some point, which happens in step 6.

- Constraint 2: grey has blue on it (step 4).

- Constraint 3: red has brown_block_1 on it (step 8).

- Constraint 4: when red is not clear (step 8), earlier state (step 3) had yellow clear.

- Constraint 5: yellow is not on table (step 6 onwards).

- Constraint 6: white becomes clear in step 11.

- Constraint 7: before white becomes clear (step 11), in step 8, red was not clear.

So all constraints are satisfied. And this plan is shorter. So this is more optimal.

But wait, step 4: stack blue_block_1 grey_block_1. To do that, we need to have blue in hand (which we do after step 3), and grey is clear (which it is initially). So yes.

This plan seems valid and shorter. Let's make sure there are no errors in the action sequence.

Another check: when we stack blue on grey (step 4), then in step 6, stack yellow on blue. That's allowed because after step 4, blue is on grey and clear. So stacking yellow on blue is possible.

Yes. Then, after step 6, yellow is on blue, blue is on grey.

Then, step 7: pickup brown_block_1 (on table, clear). Stack on red (step 8). Then unstack brown (step 9), putdown (step 10), and finally unstack red (step 11).

This seems correct.

Therefore, this 11-step plan is optimal.
