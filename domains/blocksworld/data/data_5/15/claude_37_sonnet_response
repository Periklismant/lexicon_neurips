Let me break down this problem:

1. We are in a Blocksworld domain with blocks that can be placed on the table or on top of one another. We're a robotic arm that can hold at most one block.
2. We have actions: pickup, putdown, stack, and unstack, each with its own preconditions and effects.
3. We have blocks: white_block_1, purple_block_1, blue_block_1, red_block_1, grey_block_1, white_block_2, and blue_block_2.
4. The initial state is:
   - white_block_1, purple_block_1, and grey_block_1 are on the table.
   - blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1.
   - red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1.
   - white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1.
   - blue_block_2 is on top of white_block_2.
   - red_block_1, grey_block_1, and blue_block_2 are clear.
   - We are not holding any block.
5. The goal is to have blue_block_2 on the table.

Alright, that's the basic setting. There are also a bunch of constraints:

1. "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" must be true at some point. If this becomes true, then "white_block_2 is on the table" must be true at that point or after.
2. "grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" must be true at some point. If this becomes true, then "there is a block on top of red_block_1" must be true at that point or after.
3. "blue_block_1 is not on the table" must be true at some point. If this becomes true, then "purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1" must be true at that point or after.
4. "white_block_2 is clear" must be true at some point. Before this becomes true, "grey_block_1 is not clear" must be true at some point.
5. "grey_block_1 is not on the table" must be true at some point.

Now, let's think about how to approach this. 

From the initial state, to reach the goal, we need to have blue_block_2 on the table. Currently, blue_block_2 is on top of white_block_2, which is on top of blue_block_1, which is on top of white_block_1. So, we need to unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2 and then put it down on the table.

But we also need to satisfy the constraints. Let's check the initial state against these constraints:

1. "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1": In the initial state, red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1, not white_block_1. So this constraint is initially satisfied.
2. "grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1": In the initial state, grey_block_1 is on the table, not on top of white_block_1. So this constraint is initially satisfied.
3. "blue_block_1 is not on the table": In the initial state, blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, not on the table. So this constraint is initially satisfied.
4. "white_block_2 is clear": In the initial state, white_block_2 is not clear because blue_block_2 is on top of it.
5. "grey_block_1 is not on the table": In the initial state, grey_block_1 is on the table, so this constraint is not initially satisfied.

Let's go through the constraints again, one by one, to see what actions we need to take:

1. Since "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is initially true, we need to ensure "white_block_2 is on the table" at some point. Currently, white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1, not on the table.
2. Since "grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is initially true, we need to ensure "there is a block on top of red_block_1" at some point. Currently, red_block_1 is clear, so no block is on top of it.
3. Since "blue_block_1 is not on the table" is initially true, we need to ensure "purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1" at some point. Currently, purple_block_1 is on the table, not on top of grey_block_1.
4. Before "white_block_2 is clear" becomes true, "grey_block_1 is not clear" must be true at some point. Currently, grey_block_1 is clear, and white_block_2 is not clear.
5. We need to ensure "grey_block_1 is not on the table" at some point. Currently, grey_block_1 is on the table.

So, from the initial state, we need to:
1. Put white_block_2 on the table.
2. Put a block on top of red_block_1.
3. Put purple_block_1 on top of grey_block_1.
4. Make grey_block_1 not clear (which will happen once we put purple_block_1 on it).
5. Move grey_block_1 off the table.

Let's try to devise a plan that achieves the goal (blue_block_2 on the table) while satisfying all these constraints.

Let's start by examining the initial state more closely.

Our goal is to have blue_block_2 on the table. Currently, blue_block_2 is on top of white_block_2. So, we need to unstack blue_block_2 and put it down.

But before we do that, we need to satisfy the constraints. Let's think step by step:

1. We need to ensure white_block_2 is on the table at some point.
2. We need to ensure there's a block on top of red_block_1 at some point.
3. We need to ensure purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 at some point.
4. Before white_block_2 becomes clear, grey_block_1 must not be clear at some point.
5. We need to ensure grey_block_1 is not on the table at some point.

Let's plan out a sequence of actions:

Alright, so from the initial state where blue_block_2 is on top of white_block_2, which is on top of blue_block_1, which is on top of white_block_1, let's plan a sequence of actions to reach the goal:

1. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2
2. putdown blue_block_2

This would satisfy the goal of having blue_block_2 on the table. But we still need to satisfy the constraints:

Let's think about constraint #5. We need to make grey_block_1 not on the table at some point. The only way to do this is to unstack it from the table. But to unstack it, grey_block_1 should remain clear. But constraint #4 requires grey_block_1 to be not clear at some point before white_block_2 becomes clear. 

So, the sequence could be:
1. First, put a block on top of grey_block_1 to make it not clear.
2. Then, remove the block from grey_block_1, making it clear again.
3. Then, pickup grey_block_1 from the table to satisfy constraint #5.
4. As we proceed, ensure white_block_2 is on the table at some point, and there's a block on top of red_block_1 at some point.

Let's try to map this out:

Initial state:
- white_block_1, purple_block_1, and grey_block_1 are on the table.
- blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1.
- red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1.
- white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1.
- blue_block_2 is on top of white_block_2.
- red_block_1, grey_block_1, and blue_block_2 are clear.
- We are not holding any block.

Let's first stack a block on top of grey_block_1 to make it not clear. From the clear blocks (red_block_1, grey_block_1, blue_block_2), we choose to unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2 and then stack it on grey_block_1:

1. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2
2. stack blue_block_2 grey_block_1

Now, grey_block_1 is not clear, satisfying part of constraint #4. White_block_2 is also now clear, but according to constraint #4, grey_block_1 must be not clear at some point before white_block_2 becomes clear. Since we've just satisfied this, we're good.

Now, we need to put purple_block_1 on top of grey_block_1. But purple_block_1 has red_block_1 on top of it. So we need to unstack red_block_1 first:

3. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
4. stack red_block_1 white_block_2

Now, white_block_2 is not clear because red_block_1 is on top of it. We've also satisfied constraint #2, which requires a block on top of red_block_1 at some point.

Next, let's pickup purple_block_1 from the table and stack it on blue_block_2 (which is on top of grey_block_1):

5. pickup purple_block_1
6. stack purple_block_1 blue_block_2

Now, let's unstack the tower from grey_block_1 and put it down:

7. unstack purple_block_1 blue_block_2
8. putdown purple_block_1

Wait, we can't do this. I need to ensure constraint #3 is satisfied, which states that blue_block_1 is not on the table and at that point purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1. But currently, purple_block_1 is on the table.

Let's reconsider. We need to ensure:
1. purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 when blue_block_1 is not on the table (constraint #3).
2. grey_block_1 is not on the table at some point (constraint #5).

Let's think again. 

From the initial state, let's:

1. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2
2. stack blue_block_2 grey_block_1

Now, grey_block_1 is not clear, satisfying part of constraint #4. White_block_2 is also now clear, but that's okay because grey_block_1 was not clear at some point before. But as we progress, we want to make sure grey_block_1 is off the table (constraint #5).

3. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
4. putdown red_block_1

Hmm, this doesn't immediately satisfy any constraint, but it gives us more freedom to move the blocks around.

5. pickup purple_block_1
6. stack purple_block_1 white_block_2

Now, white_block_2 is not clear.

7. unstack blue_block_2 grey_block_1

Now, grey_block_1 is clear again. At this point, we are in a state where:
- white_block_1 is on the table.
- blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1.
- white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1.
- purple_block_1 is on top of white_block_2.
- red_block_1 and grey_block_1 are on the table.
- red_block_1, blue_block_2, and grey_block_1, and purple_block_1 are clear.
- We are holding blue_block_2.

8. putdown blue_block_2

This satisfies the goal of having blue_block_2 on the table.

However, I see we're still missing a few constraints:
- Constraint #3 requires "purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1" when "blue_block_1 is not on the table".
- Constraint #5 requires "grey_block_1 is not on the table" at some point.

Let's adjust our plan. From the state after step 7, where:
- white_block_1 is on the table.
- blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1.
- white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1.
- purple_block_1 is on top of white_block_2.
- red_block_1 and grey_block_1 are on the table.
- red_block_1, grey_block_1, and purple_block_1 are clear.
- We are holding blue_block_2.

8. stack blue_block_2 red_block_1

Now, red_block_1 is not clear, satisfying constraint #2.

9. pickup grey_block_1

This satisfies constraint #5, requiring grey_block_1 to be off the table.

10. putdown grey_block_1

We really want to place purple_block_1 on top of grey_block_1 while blue_block_1 is not on the table (constraint #3). But blue_block_1in is currently on top of white_block_1 and has white_block_2 and purple_block_1 on top of it. We need to get to those blocks first.

11. unstack purple_block_1 white_block_2

Now:
- white_block_1 is on the table.
- blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1.
- white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1.
- red_block_1 and grey_block_1 are on the table.
- blue_block_2 is on top of red_block_1.
- white_block_2 and grey_block_1 are clear.
- We are holding purple_block_1.

12. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1

Now, grey_block_1 is not clear, and we've placed purple_block_1 on top of grey_block_1, which is relevant for constraint #3. But we still need to ensure blue_block_1 is not on the table at the same time.

13. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1

Now:
- white_block_1 is on the table.
- blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1.
- red_block_1 and grey_block_1 are on the table.
- blue_block_2 is on top of red_block_1.
- purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1.
- blue_block_1 is clear.
- We are holding white_block_2.

14. putdown white_block_2

This satisfies constraint #1, requiring white_block_2 to be on the table at some point.

15. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
16. putdown blue_block_1

Now, blue_block_1 is on the table, which means "blue_block_1 is not on the table" is false. But that's okay, because we've already satisfied constraint #3 with purple_block_1 on top of grey_block_1 when blue_block_1 was not on the table.

17. unstack blue_block_2 red_block_1
18. putdown blue_block_2

This achieves the goal of having blue_block_2 on the table.

Let's review our plan to ensure it satisfies all the constraints:

1. constraint #1: "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is initially true, and we've ensured "white_block_2 is on the table" after step 14. So this is satisfied.
2. constraint #2: "grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is initially true, and we've ensured "there is a block on top of red_block_1" after step 8 with blue_block_2 on top of red_block_1. So this is satisfied.
3. constraint #3: "blue_block_1 is not on the table" is initially true, and we've ensured "purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1" after step 12. So this is satisfied.
4. constraint #4: "white_block_2 is clear" becomes true after step 11, and before that "grey_block_1 is not clear" was true after step 12. But that's a circular reference. I made a mistake here. Let's adjust...

Wait, the ordering of events is important to get right. Let's re-read constraint #4 again: "If 'white_block_2 is clear' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which 'grey_block_1 is not clear' is true."

So, before white_block_2 gets cleared, we need to ensure grey_block_1 is not clear at some point. Let's adjust our plan.

From the initial state, let's:
1. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2
2. stack blue_block_2 grey_block_1

Now, grey_block_1 is not clear. This is the "earlier state" in which "grey_block_1 is not clear" is true.

3. unstack blue_block_2 grey_block_1

Now, white_block_2 is clear, and grey_block_1 is clear.

In the above steps, we've satisfied constraint #4, because before white_block_2 became clear, grey_block_1 was not clear.

Now, let's continue from step 3:
4. putdown blue_block_2

This achieves the goal of having blue_block_2 on the table.

Actually, I'm going to start from scratch, make sure I get all the constraints right, and provide a correct plan. 

Initial state:
- white_block_1, purple_block_1, and grey_block_1 are on the table.
- blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1.
- red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1.
- white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1.
- blue_block_2 is on top of white_block_2.
- red_block_1, grey_block_1, and blue_block_2 are clear.
- We are not holding any block.

Goal:
- blue_block_2 is on the table.

Constraints to satisfy at some point:
1. "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" and then "white_block_2 is on the table".
2. "grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" and then "red_block_1 is not clear".
3. "blue_block_1 is not on the table" and then "purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1".
4. Before "white_block_2 is clear", "grey_block_1 is not clear" must be true.
5. "grey_block_1 is not on the table" must be true at some point.

Let's make sure our plan satisfies all these constraints:

From the initial state, we observe:
- Constraint #1: "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is initially true because red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1, not white_block_1. So, we need to ensure "white_block_2 is on the table" at some point.
- Constraint #2: "grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is initially true because grey_block_1 is on the table, not on top of white_block_1. So, we need to ensure "red_block_1 is not clear" at some point.
- Constraint #3: "blue_block_1 is not on the table" is initially true because blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, not on the table. So, we need to ensure "purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1" at some point.
- Constraint #4: "Before white_block_2 is clear, grey_block_1 is not clear must be true" is a timing constraint. In the initial state, white_block_2 is not clear, but grey_block_1 is clear. We need to make grey_block_1 not clear before white_block_2 becomes clear.
- Constraint #5: "grey_block_1 is not on the table" must be true at some point. In the initial state, grey_block_1 is on the table, so we need to pick it up.

Now, let's plan our actions:

1. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2
2. stack blue_block_2 grey_block_1

Now, grey_block_1 is not clear, which is necessary for constraint #4.

3. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
4. stack red_block_1 white_block_2

White_block_2 is now not clear, satisfying constraint #2 (red_block_1 is not clear).

5. pickup purple_block_1
6. stack purple_block_1 blue_block_2

Both grey_block_1 and white_block_2 are not clear.

7. unstack red_block_1 white_block_2

Now, white_block_2 is clear. But that's okay, because grey_block_1 was not clear before, which satisfies constraint #4.

8. putdown red_block_1

9. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1
10. putdown white_block_2

This satisfies constraint #1 (white_block_2 is on the table).

11. unstack purple_block_1 blue_block_2
12. unstack blue_block_2 grey_block_1
13. pickup grey_block_1

This satisfies constraint #5 (grey_block_1 is not on the table).

14. putdown grey_block_1
15. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1

This satisfies constraint #3 (purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1).

16. putdown blue_block_2

This achieves the goal of having blue_block_2 on the table.

Let's just make sure all the constraints are satisfied. Right now:
- Constraint #1: "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" was initially true, and "white_block_2 is on the table" is true after step 10.
- Constraint #2: "grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" was initially true, and "red_block_1 is not clear" is true after step 4.
- Constraint #3: "blue_block_1 is not on the table" was initially true, and "purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1" is true after step 15.
- Constraint #4: "Before white_block_2 is clear, grey_block_1 is not clear must be true." White_block_2 becomes clear after step 7, and grey_block_1 is not clear after step 2 and before step 12. So the timing works out; grey_block_1 is not clear before white_block_2 becomes clear.
- Constraint #5: "grey_block_1 is not on the table" is true after step 13.

So all the constraints are satisfied! But wait. I realize I've been neglecting to check if we can even do some of these actions. Let me re-examine the plan to ensure all the actions are valid according to the preconditions.

I'm going to trace through the plan step by step and make sure each action is valid given the state after the previous action.

Initial state:
- white_block_1, purple_block_1, and grey_block_1 are on the table.

- purple_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2.
- white_block_2, red_block_1, and purple_block_1 are clear.
- We are not holding any block.

9. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1: This is valid. white_block_2 is clear, is on top of blue_block_1, and we are not holding any block.

State after 9:
- white_block_1, grey_block_1, and red_block_1 are on the table.
- blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1.
- blue_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1.

- We are holding white_block_2.

10. putdown white_block_2: This is valid. We are holding white_block_2.

- We are not holding any block.

11. unstack purple_block_1 blue_block_2: This is valid. purple_block_1 is clear, is on top of blue_block_2, and we are not holding any block.

- blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1.
- blue_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1.
- blue_block_1, red_block_1, white_block_2, and blue_block_2 are clear.
- We are holding purple_block_1.

12. unstack blue_block_2 grey_block_1: This is not valid because we are already holding purple_block_1, and we can only hold one block at a time.

So there's a flaw in our plan. Let's revise it:

Actually, I'm going to construct the plan once more from scratch to make sure everything is correct. I'll also check the preconditions for each action.

Starting from the initial state:

1. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2: We can do this because blue_block_2 is clear, is on top of white_block_2, and we are not holding any block.

2. stack blue_block_2 grey_block_1: We can do this because we are holding blue_block_2 and grey_block_1 is clear. After this, grey_block_1 is not clear.

3. unstack blue_block_2 grey_block_1: We can do this because blue_block_2 is clear, is on top of grey_block_1, and we are not holding any block. After this, grey_block_1 is clear again. Now we need to ensure the other constraints are satisfied.

4. putdown blue_block_2: We can do this because we are holding blue_block_2. This achieves the goal of having blue_block_2 on the table. But we still need to satisfy the other constraints.

5. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1: We can do this because white_block_2 is clear, is on top of blue_block_1, and we are not holding any block.

6. putdown white_block_2: We can do this because we are holding white_block_2. This satisfies constraint #1 (white_block_2 is on the table).

7. pickup grey_block_1: We can do this because grey_block_1 is clear, is on the table, and we are not holding any block. This satisfies constraint #5 (grey_block_1 is not on the table).

8. putdown grey_block_1: We can do this because we are holding grey_block_1.

9. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1: We can do this because red_block_1 is clear, is on top of purple_block_1, and we are not holding any block.

10. stack red_block_1 white_block_2: We can do this because we are holding red_block_1 and white_block_2 is clear. This satisfies constraint #2 (red_block_1 is not clear).

11. pickup purple_block_1: We can do this because purple_block_1 is clear, is on the table, and we are not holding any block.

12. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1: We can do this because we are holding purple_block_1 and grey_block_1 is clear. This satisfies constraint #3 (purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1).

Let's check all the constraints again:

1. Constraint #1: "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" was initially true, and "white_block_2 is on the table" is true after step 6.
2. Constraint #2: "grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" was initially true, and "red_block_1 is not clear" is true after step 10.
3. Constraint #3: "blue_block_1 is not on the table" was initially true, and "purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1" is true after step 12.
4. Constraint #4: "Before white_block_2 is clear, grey_block_1 is not clear must be true." White_block_2 becomes clear after we unstack blue_block_2 from it in step 1. But before that, grey_block_1 is clear, which doesn't satisfy the constraint. We need to revise the plan.

Let's try to adjust for constraint #4. We need to ensure grey_block_1 is not clear before white_block_2 is clear.

Starting from the initial state:

1. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1: We can do this because red_block_1 is clear, is on top of purple_block_1, and we are not holding any block.

2. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1: We can do this because we are holding red_block_1 and grey_block_1 is clear. Now grey_block_1 is not clear, as required by constraint #4.

3. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2: We can do this because blue_block_2 is clear, is on top of white_block_2, and we are not holding any block. After this step, white_block_2 is clear. But that's okay, because grey_block_1 was not clear before this (after step 2), which satisfies constraint #4.

4. putdown blue_block_2: We can do this because we are holding blue_block_2. This achieves the goal of having blue_block_2 on the table.

5. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1: We can do this because white_block_2 is clear, is on top of blue_block_1, and we are not holding any block.

6. putdown white_block_2: We can do this because we are holding white_block_2. This satisfies constraint #1 (white_block_2 is on the table).

7. unstack red_block_1 grey_block_1: We can do this because red_block_1 is clear, is on top of grey_block_1, and we are not holding any block.

8. stack red_block_1 white_block_2: We can do this because we are holding red_block_1 and white_block_2 is clear. This satisfies constraint #2 (red_block_1 is not clear).

9. pickup purple_block_1: We can do this because purple_block_1 is clear, is on the table, and we are not holding any block.

10. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1: We can do this because we are holding purple_block_1 and grey_block_1 is clear. This satisfies constraint #3 (purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1).

11. pickup grey_block_1: But wait, we can't do this because purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1, making grey_block_1 not clear. We need to revise the plan.

Let's adjust the plan again for constraint #5 (grey_block_1 is not on the table). We need to pick up grey_block_1 and hence it needs to be clear. But we also need to ensure constraint #3 (purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1).

Starting from the initial state:

1. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1: We can do this because red_block_1 is clear, is on top of purple_block_1, and we are not holding any block.

2. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1: We can do this because we are holding red_block_1 and grey_block_1 is clear. Now, grey_block_1 is not clear, as required by constraint #4.

3. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2: We can do this because blue_block_2 is clear, is on top of white_block_2, and we are not holding any block. After this step, white_block_2 is clear, but that's okay for constraint #4 because grey_block_1 is already not clear.

4. putdown blue_block_2: We can do this because we are holding blue_block_2. This achieves the goal of having blue_block_2 on the table.

5. pickup purple_block_1: We can do this because purple_block_1 is clear, is on the table, and we are not holding any block.

6. stack purple_block_1 red_block_1: We can do this because we are holding purple_block_1 and red_block_1 is clear. Now, both purple_block_1 and grey_block_1 are part of the same tower, with purple_block_1 above red_block_1 and red_block_1 on top of grey_block_1.

7. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1: We can do this because white_block_2 is clear, is on top of blue_block_1, and we are not holding any block.

8. putdown white_block_2: We can do this because we are holding white_block_2. This satisfies constraint #1 (white_block_2 is on the table).

9. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1: We can do this because purple_block_1 is clear, is on top of red_block_1, and we are not holding any block.

10. putdown purple_block_1: We can do this because we are holding purple_block_1.

11. unstack red_block_1 grey_block_1: We can do this because red_block_1 is clear, is on top of grey_block_1, and we are not holding any block.

12. stack red_block_1 white_block_2: We can do this because we are holding red_block_1 and white_block_2 is clear. This satisfies constraint #2 (red_block_1 is not clear).

13. pickup grey_block_1: We can do this because grey_block_1 is clear, is on the table, and we are not holding any block. This satisfies constraint #5 (grey_block_1 is not on the table).

14. putdown grey_block_1: We can do this because we are holding grey_block_1.

15. pickup purple_block_1: We can do this because purple_block_1 is clear, is on the table, and we are not holding any block.

16. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1: We can do this because we are holding purple_block_1 and grey_block_1 is clear. This satisfies constraint #3 (purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1).

Let's check all the constraints again:

1. Constraint #1: "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" was initially true, and "white_block_2 is on the table" is true after step 8.
2. Constraint #2: "grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" was initially true, and "red_block_1 is not clear" is true after step 12.
3. Constraint #3: "blue_block_1 is not on the table" was initially true, and "purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1" is true after step 16.
4. Constraint #4: "Before white_block_2 is clear, grey_block_1 is not clear must be true." White_block_2 becomes clear after step 3, and grey_block_1 is not clear after step 2 and before step 3. So this is satisfied.
5. Constraint #5: "grey_block_1 is not on the table" is true after step 13.

I think the final plan satisfies all the constraints. Let me reread it one more time to ensure everything's correct.

My final plan (with every action's preconditions and the state of the world at each step to ensure the validness of the actions):

From the initial state, I'm going to:

1. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1: red_block_1 is clear, is on top of purple_block_1, and we're not holding any block.
2. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1: We're holding red_block_1 and grey_block_1 is clear.
3. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2: blue_block_2 is clear, is on top of white_block_2, and we're not holding any block.
4. putdown blue_block_2: We're holding blue_block_2.
5. pickup purple_block_1: purple_block_1 is clear, is on the table, and we're not holding any block.
6. stack purple_block_1 red_block_1: We're holding purple_block_1 and red_block_1 is clear.
7. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1: white_block_2 is clear, is on top of blue_block_1, and we're not holding any block.
8. putdown white_block_2: We're holding white_block_2.
9. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1: purple_block_1 is clear, is on top of red_block_1, and we're not holding any block.
10. putdown purple_block_1: We're holding purple_block_1.
11. unstack red_block_1 grey_block_1: red_block_1 is clear, is on top of grey_block_1, and we're not holding any block.
12. stack red_block_1 white_block_2: We're holding red_block_1 and white_block_2 is clear.
13. pickup grey_block_1: grey_block_1 is clear, is on the table, and we're not holding any block.
14. putdown grey_block_1: We're holding grey_block_1.
15. pickup purple_block_1: purple_block_1 is clear, is on the table, and we're not holding any block.
16. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1: We're holding purple_block_1 and grey_block_1 is clear.

This gives us:
- white_block_1, blue_block_1, white_block_2, grey_block_1, and blue_block_2 are on the table.
- red_block_1 is on top of white_block_2.
- purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1.
- red_block_1, purple_block_1, blue_block_1, and blue_block_2 are clear.
- We're not holding any block.

All constraints are satisfied, and blue_block_2 is on the table (our goal).

Looking back at my plan, I see that it's a valid plan, but it's not necessarily an optimal plan. According to the problem statement, we need to provide an optimal plan whose length is equal or less than any other valid plan.

Let's try to reduce the plan. We take some unnecessary actions here. We don't need to place purple_block_1 on red_block_1 and then unstack it just after. Let's simplify:

From the initial state, I'm going to:

1. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1: red_block_1 is clear, is on top of purple_block_1, and we're not holding any block.
2. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1: We're holding red_block_1 and grey_block_1 is clear.
3. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2: blue_block_2 is clear, is on top of white_block_2, and we're not holding any block.
4. putdown blue_block_2: We're holding blue_block_2.
5. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1: white_block_2 is clear, is on top of blue_block_1, and we're not holding any block.
6. putdown white_block_2: We're holding white_block_2.
7. unstack red_block_1 grey_block_1: red_block_1 is clear, is on top of grey_block_1, and we're not holding any block.
8. stack red_block_1 white_block_2: We're holding red_block_1 and white_block_2 is clear.
9. pickup grey_block_1: grey_block_1 is clear, is on the table, and we're not holding any block.
10. putdown grey_block_1: We're holding grey_block_1.
11. pickup purple_block_1: purple_block_1 is clear, is on the table, and we're not holding any block.
12. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1: We're holding purple_block_1 and grey_block_1 is clear.

That's 12 steps. Let's check if all constraints are still satisfied:

1. Constraint #1: "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" was initially true, and "white_block_2 is on the table" is true after step 6.
2. Constraint #2: "grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" was initially true, and "red_block_1 is not clear" is true after step 8.
3. Constraint #3: "blue_block_1 is not on the table" was initially true, and "purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1" is true after step 12.
4. Constraint #4: "Before white_block_2 is clear, grey_block_1 is not clear must be true." White_block_2 becomes clear after step 3, and grey_block_1 is not clear after step 2 and before step 3. So this is satisfied.
5. Constraint #5: "grey_block_1 is not on the table" is true after step 9.

So the reduced plan with 12 steps still satisfies all constraints. But can we reduce it further?

Actually, I don't think we can reduce it further while satisfying all constraints. Let's be sure:

1. We need to have blue_block_2 on the table (our goal).
2. We need to have white_block_2 on the table for constraint #1.
3. We need to have red_block_1 not clear for constraint #2.
4. We need to have purple_block_1 on top of grey_block_1 for constraint #3.
5. We need to make grey_block_1 not clear before white_block_2 is clear for constraint #4.
6. We need to have grey_block_1 not on the table for constraint #5.

Our 12-step plan satisfies all of these, and it seems minimal for doing so. But let's double-check.

Actually, I've realized we don't need to hold grey_block_1 and then put it down. We only need it to be off the table at some point. We can just skip those two steps. And similarly, can we be more efficient? I'm going to revisit the constraints.

Constraint #5 requires grey_block_1 to be picked up at some point (to be off the table). We can just pick it up, and then immediately place purple_block_1 on it. We don't need to put it down on the table in between.

So, our revised plan, which is shorter:

1. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1: red_block_1 is clear, is on top of purple_block_1, and we're not holding any block.
2. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1: We're holding red_block_1 and grey_block_1 is clear.
3. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2: blue_block_2 is clear, is on top of white_block_2, and we're not holding any block.
4. putdown blue_block_2: We're holding blue_block_2.
5. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1: white_block_2 is clear, is on top of blue_block_1, and we're not holding any block.
6. putdown white_block_2: We're holding white_block_2.
7. unstack red_block_1 grey_block_1: red_block_1 is clear, is on top of grey_block_1, and we're not holding any block.
8. stack red_block_1 white_block_2: We're holding red_block_1 and white_block_2 is clear.
9. pickup grey_block_1: grey_block_1 is clear, is on the table, and we're not holding any block.
10. putdown grey_block_1: We're holding grey_block_1.
11. pickup purple_block_1: purple_block_1 is clear, is on the table, and we're not holding any block.
12. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1: We're holding purple_block_1 and grey_block_1 is clear.

I'm confident this is an optimal plan, satisfying all constraints.
