Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld problem. So, the initial state is a bit complex, and there are several constraints to satisfy. The goal is to have the robotic arm holding blue_block_1. Let me first visualize the initial setup.

From the initial state:

- orange_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top, and then black_block_1 on top of yellow. So, orange -> yellow -> black_block_1 (all clear except orange has yellow, yellow has black, and black_block_1 is clear).
- black_block_2 is on the table with blue_block_1 on top (blue is clear).
- white_block_1 is on the table with red_block_1 on top (red is clear).

The goal is to hold blue_block_1. But there are constraints to meet along the way.

Let's list the constraints:

1. At least once, blue_block_1 must have a block on top (so it's not clear). But before that state, red_block_1 must be on the table.
2. At least once, yellow_block_1 must be clear.
3. At least once, red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1.
4. At least once, yellow_block_1 is on the table.
5. At least once, blue_block_1 is not on white_block_1. And whenever this is true, yellow_block_1 must be clear either at that state or after.

Hmm. So, the plan must include actions that satisfy all these constraints while achieving the goal of holding blue_block_1.

First, the main goal: to hold blue_block_1. Initially, blue_block_1 is on black_block_2. To pick it up, the arm needs to unstack it. But blue_block_1 is clear, so we can unstack it from black_block_2. Wait, but the unstack action requires that blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2, which it is, and that blue_block_1 is clear (which it is), and the arm isn't holding anything. So, the first step could be unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2. Then, the arm is holding blue_block_1, which is the goal. But wait, the problem is to bring about the goal situation, so if we just unstack blue_block_1, that's the first action and the plan is done? But no, because there are constraints that must be satisfied in the plan. So even if the goal is achieved immediately, the constraints need to be met in some state(s) along the way.

Wait, the constraints must hold in at least one state in the plan. So even if the plan is just unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2, but that plan doesn't satisfy the other constraints. So the constraints require that during the plan execution, certain conditions are met. Therefore, even though the main goal is achieved quickly, the constraints force us to perform additional actions.

Let me list all constraints again:

Constraint 1: At some state, blue_block_1 is not clear (has a block on top). But before that state, red_block_1 must be on the table.

Constraint 2: At some state, yellow_block_1 is clear.

Constraint 3: At some state, red_block_1 is on orange_block_1.

Constraint 4: At some state, yellow_block_1 is on the table.

Constraint 5: At some state, blue_block_1 is not on white_block_1. And whenever that's true, yellow must be clear at that state or after.

So, the plan needs to include steps that make these conditions true.

Let's think about how to satisfy each constraint.

Starting with constraint 3: red_block_1 must be on orange_block_1 at some point. Currently, red is on white_block_1. So, to put red on orange, we need to move red from white to orange. But to do that, we need to pick up red, which is on white. So first, unstack red from white (since red is clear). Then stack red onto orange_block_1. But orange_block_1 currently has yellow on it. So we need to clear orange_block_1 first. Wait, no. Because stacking red onto orange would require that orange is clear. Because to stack, the target block (orange) must be clear. So orange is currently under yellow, so it's not clear. So we can't stack red on orange unless we remove the blocks above orange.

So, to stack red on orange_block_1, we need to first remove yellow_block_1 and black_block_1 from orange. Let's see: orange has yellow, which has black. So the stack is orange -> yellow -> black. All of these need to be moved.

So, to clear orange, we need to unstack yellow from orange, but yellow has black on top. So we can't unstack yellow unless black is moved first. So first, unstack black_block_1 from yellow. Then, unstack yellow from orange. Then, put yellow on the table (to satisfy constraint 4: yellow is on the table at some point). Then, red can be stacked on orange.

But this seems like a lot of steps. But maybe necessary to meet constraint 3 (red on orange) and constraint 4 (yellow on table).

Additionally, constraint 1 requires that blue_block_1 is not clear (has a block on top) at some point, but before that, red must be on the table. Currently, red is on white, so to have red on the table, we can put it down after picking it up.

Wait, the initial state has red on white. So if we unstack red from white, then put it down, then in that state, red is on the table. Then, later, maybe stack something on blue_block_1, which is initially on black_block_2.

But blue_block_1 is part of the main goal (to hold it). So perhaps after stacking something on blue_block_1, we then unstack it again. But that would require more steps.

Alternatively, perhaps during the process of moving blocks around, we can satisfy these constraints.

Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1 (since it's clear). Then putdown red_block_1. This satisfies the requirement for constraint 1's precondition (red on table) if later we stack something on blue_block_1.

But first, let's see the order of actions.

But blue_block_1 is on black_block_2. To have something on top of blue_block_1, we need to stack a block on it. But to stack on blue_block_1, we need to have that block in hand and blue_block_1 must be clear. So perhaps, after moving blue_block_1, but the main goal is to hold it. So maybe:

- First, stack something on blue_block_1 (making it not clear, satisfying constraint 1), then unstack it again to hold it.

But how can we stack something on blue_block_1? Let's see. Let's say we want to stack red_block_1 on blue_block_1. To do that, red must be picked up. But red is initially on white. So steps could be:

- Unstack red from white (since it's clear).
- Stack red on blue_block_1. Now, blue has red on top (so blue is not clear). This satisfies constraint 1. But before this, red must have been on the table. Wait, no: the constraint says that if blue is not clear in some state, then there must be an earlier state where red is on the table. But in this case, red was on white, then unstacked (so in the process, the arm holds it, then stacks it on blue. So the state where red is on the table would have to be before stacking on blue. But in this scenario, red is moved directly from white to blue, never being on the table. So that violates the constraint. Therefore, we need to have red on the table at some point before stacking it on blue.

So the steps would need to be:

- Unstack red from white.
- Putdown red on table. Now, red is on the table. This satisfies the precondition for constraint 1.
- Then, pick up red again (if needed) to stack on blue. But wait, after putting red down, it's clear. So to stack red on blue, we need to pick it up again.

But this adds steps. Let's see:

1. Unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1.
2. Putdown red_block_1. Now, red is on the table. This is the state required for constraint 1's precondition.
3. Pickup red_block_1 again (if possible).
4. Stack red_block_1 on blue_block_1 (which is currently on black_block_2). But blue_block_1 is clear, so this is allowed. Now, blue_block_1 has red on top, satisfying constraint 1.

Then, to get blue_block_1, we need to unstack red from blue, then unstack blue from black_block_2. Wait, but blue is under red. So first, unstack red from blue (since red is clear), then unstack blue from black_block_2. Then, we are holding blue, which is the goal.

But this would require:

5. Unstack red_block_1 from blue_block_1.
6. Putdown red_block_1. (Or stack it elsewhere)
7. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2. Now, holding blue_block_1.

But this seems like a longer plan, but it might be necessary to meet the constraints.

Additionally, we need to satisfy other constraints:

Constraint 3: red is on orange at some state. So during the plan, we need to have red on orange. So after step 2, red is on the table. Then, perhaps stack red on orange. But orange currently has yellow and black on top. So we need to clear orange first.

So maybe:

After step 2 (red is on the table), we need to clear orange_block_1. To clear orange, we need to remove yellow and black from it.

Let's proceed:

8. Unstack black_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (since black is clear).
9. Putdown black_block_1.
10. Unstack yellow_block_1 from orange_block_1 (now yellow is clear after step 8).
11. Putdown yellow_block_1. Now, yellow is on the table (satisfying constraint 4).
12. Now, orange_block_1 is clear. So we can stack red_block_1 on orange_block_1. But red is on the table from step 2. So we need to pick it up again.

Wait, after step 2, red is on the table. Then, steps 8-11: moving black and yellow to the table. Then, step 12: pickup red_block_1 (if possible, since it's on the table and clear). Then stack red_block_1 on orange_block_1. This satisfies constraint 3.

But then, after that, we might need to stack red on blue_block_1 as part of constraint 1.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to outline the steps in order, considering all constraints:

1. Unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1. (Now holding red)
2. Putdown red_block_1. (Red is on table; satisfies precondition for constraint 1)
3. Unstack black_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (Now holding black_block_1)
4. Putdown black_block_1. (Black_block_1 is on table)
5. Unstack yellow_block_1 from orange_block_1. (Holding yellow)
6. Putdown yellow_block_1. (Yellow is on table; satisfies constraint 4)
7. Pickup red_block_1. (Now holding red)
8. Stack red_block_1 on orange_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 3)
9. Now, orange has red, but we need to stack something on blue_block_1 to make it not clear. Let's use black_block_1.

10. Pickup black_block_1. (It's on the table and clear)
11. Stack black_block_1 on blue_block_1. (Now blue_block_1 has black_block_1 on top; satisfies constraint 1)
12. Now, to get blue_block_1, we need to unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1.
13. Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1. (Now holding black_block_1)
14. Putdown black_block_1.
15. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2. (Now holding blue_block_1; goal achieved)

But let's check the constraints:

- Constraint 1: blue_block_1 is not clear (step 11). Before that, red was on the table (step 2). Satisfied.
- Constraint 2: yellow_block_1 is clear. After step 6, yellow is on table (clear). So yes, in step 6, when yellow is put down, it's clear. Satisfied.
- Constraint 3: red is on orange (step 8). Yes.
- Constraint 4: yellow is on table (step 6). Yes.
- Constraint 5: blue_block_1 is not on white_block_1. Initially, blue is on black_block_2. In the plan, blue is moved from black_block_2 to being held (step 15). So during the plan, blue is never on white. So the initial state has blue on black_block_2, and the final state has it held. So "blue_block_1 is not on white_block_1" is true in all states except if it's ever placed there, which it isn't. So this constraint is automatically satisfied. But the second part: whenever blue is not on white_block_1 (which is always true), then yellow must be clear at that state or after. Since in step 6, yellow is put on table (clear), and after that, it remains on the table unless moved. Since we don't move yellow again, yellow remains clear. So whenever blue is not on white (all the time), yellow is clear from step 6 onwards. So this is satisfied.

Wait, but the constraint says "if blue is not on white holds in some state s, then yellow must be clear at s or after". Since blue is never on white, every state s in the plan has blue not on white. So we need that in every state s where blue is not on white (all states), yellow is clear at s or after. But after step 6, yellow is on the table (clear), so from step 6 onwards, yellow is clear. Before step 6, in the initial state, yellow is under black_block_1, so not clear. But in those early states (steps 1-5), blue is not on white, so according to the constraint, in those states s (steps 1-5), we need that yellow is clear either in s or after. But in those steps, yellow is not clear until step 6. So for steps 1-5, the constraint requires that in those states, either yellow is clear (which it's not) or in some state after s, yellow is clear. Since in step 6, yellow is put down and clear, then for all s from 1-5, there exists a state after s where yellow is clear. So the constraint is satisfied.

So this plan seems to satisfy all constraints.

Now, let's check if the plan is optimal. The steps are 15 actions. But maybe there's a shorter way. Let me see.

Alternative approach: Can we stack red on orange without moving yellow and black?

No, because orange has yellow on it, which has black. So to stack red on orange, we need to clear orange first.

Alternatively, could we stack red on top of black_block_1? Then, that would require moving red to black_block_1. But that doesn't help with the constraint of red on orange.

Hmm. Let me see if there's a way to shorten the plan.

What if instead of moving black_block_1 and yellow to the table, we stack them elsewhere. For example, stack black_block_1 on white_block_1. But white_block_1 initially has red, which we unstack. So after unstacking red, white is clear. So, after step 1 (unstack red from white), white is clear. Then, in step 3, unstack black_block_1 from yellow, and perhaps stack it on white_block_1. That would save a putdown and pickup step.

Let me try:

1. Unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1. (Hold red)
2. Putdown red_block_1. (Red on table)
3. Unstack black_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (Hold black_block_1)
4. Stack black_block_1 on white_block_1. (Now, white has black_block_1; but is that allowed? Stacking requires that white is clear. After step 1, white is clear. So yes. Stack black_block_1 on white. Now, white has black_block_1, which is clear. Then, proceed.

But does this help? Let's see:

Then, step 5: unstack yellow_block_1 from orange_block_1. (Holding yellow)
6. Putdown yellow_block_1. (Yellow on table)
7. Pickup red_block_1. (Holding red)
8. Stack red on orange. (Satisfies constraint 3)
9. Now, need to stack something on blue_block_1. Let's use black_block_1 from white.

But black_block_1 is on white. So steps:

9. Unstack black_block_1 from white_block_1. (Holding black_block_1)
10. Stack black_block_1 on blue_block_1. (Blue not clear, satisfies constraint 1)
11. Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1. (Holding black_block_1)
12. Putdown black_block_1.
13. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2. (Holding blue; goal achieved)

This reduces some steps. Let's count:

Steps 1-13: 13 actions. Original plan was 15. So maybe shorter.

But need to check all constraints:

- Constraint 5: blue is not on white. In this plan, black_block_1 is stacked on white in step4. Then, unstacked in step9. So blue is never on white. So constraint 5 is satisfied.

But during step4, black is on white. Blue is on black_block_2. So blue is not on white. So constraint 5's first part is always true. The second part requires that whenever blue is not on white, yellow is clear either then or after. From step6 onwards, yellow is on table (clear). So steps 1-5: in those steps, blue is not on white, but yellow is not clear until step6. So for steps 1-5, the constraint requires that in those states, there's a subsequent state where yellow is clear (step6). Which is true.

Other constraints:

- Constraint 1: blue is not clear in step10. Before that, red was on table in step2. Satisfied.
- Constraint 2: yellow is clear in step6. Yes.
- Constraint3: red on orange in step8. Yes.
- Constraint4: yellow on table in step6. Yes.

This plan seems valid and shorter. But let's count the steps again.

Alternative plan steps:

1. Unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1.
2. Putdown red_block_1.
3. Unstack black_block_1 from yellow_block_1.
4. Stack black_block_1 on white_block_1.
5. Unstack yellow_block_1 from orange_block_1.
6. Putdown yellow_block_1.
7. Pickup red_block_1.
8. Stack red_block_1 on orange_block_1.
9. Unstack black_block_1 from white_block_1.
10. Stack black_block_1 on blue_block_1.
11. Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1.
12. Putdown black_block_1.
13. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2.

That's 13 steps. But in step4, stacking black_block_1 on white_block_1. Then in step9, unstacking it. That's two steps. But is there a way to avoid that?

Alternatively, after step3 (holding black_block_1), can we stack it directly on blue_block_1 instead of white? Let's see:

But blue_block_1 is on black_block_2 and is clear. So:

3. Unstack black_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (Hold black_block_1)
4. Stack black_block_1 on blue_block_1. (Now blue is not clear, satisfying constraint 1. But before this, red must be on table. Step2 is putdown red, which is before step4. So this satisfies constraint 1's precondition.

Then, after stacking black on blue, we need to unstack it to get blue. But then:

5. Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1. (Hold black_block_1)
6. Putdown black_block_1.
7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from orange_block_1. (But yellow is under black_block_1 in the original setup. Wait, after step3, we removed black_block_1 from yellow, so yellow is clear. So yes, unstack yellow from orange.

Continuing:

8. Putdown yellow_block_1. (Satisfies constraint4)
9. Pickup red_block_1. (From step2)
10. Stack red_block_1 on orange_block_1. (Satisfies constraint3)
11. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2. (Now holding blue; goal achieved)

Wait, this would be steps 1-11. Let's check:

1. Unstack red from white.
2. Putdown red.
3. Unstack black1 from yellow.
4. Stack black1 on blue.
5. Unstack black1 from blue.
6. Putdown black1.
7. Unstack yellow from orange.
8. Putdown yellow.
9. Pickup red.
10. Stack red on orange.
11. Unstack blue from black2.

This is 11 steps. Let's see constraints:

- Constraint1: step4 has blue not clear. Before that, step2 puts red on table. Satisfied.
- Constraint2: yellow clear in step7 (after unstacking black1, yellow is clear) but wait, after step3, black1 is removed from yellow, so yellow is clear. Then step7 is unstacking yellow from orange, which requires yellow is clear. Wait, no: after step3, yellow is clear. Then step7 is unstacking yellow from orange. So when unstacking yellow from orange, yellow must be clear (which it is). So during step7, yellow is clear. So constraint2 is satisfied in step7.

Wait, no. Constraint2 requires that in at least one state, yellow is clear. After step3, yellow is clear. Because when we unstack black1 from yellow, yellow becomes clear. So after step3, yellow is clear. Then, in step7, unstacking yellow from orange. So yellow must be clear to do that, which it is. So the state after step3 (after unstacking black1) has yellow clear. So constraint2 is already satisfied here. So we don't need to wait until step8.

So in this plan, constraint2 is satisfied at step3. So no need to have yellow on the table for that. But constraint4 requires that yellow is on the table at least once. So in this plan, step8 puts yellow on the table. So that's okay.

Other constraints:

- Constraint3: step10: red on orange.
- Constraint4: step8: yellow on table.
- Constraint5: blue not on white. Always true. And whenever that's the case, yellow must be clear in that state or after. After step3, yellow is clear. So from step3 onwards, yellow is clear. But in steps 1-2, blue is not on white, but yellow is not clear (since initial state has yellow under black1). So during steps 1-2, the constraint requires that yellow is clear in some state after. Which it is, from step3 onwards. So this is satisfied.

This plan is shorter (11 steps), but does it meet all constraints?

Let me check:

1. Unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1.
2. Putdown red_block_1. (red on table)
3. Unstack black_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (yellow is clear now)
4. Stack black_block_1 on blue_block_1. (blue not clear)
5. Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1.
6. Putdown black_block_1.
7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from orange_block_1. (yellow is clear)
8. Putdown yellow_block_1. (yellow on table)
9. Pickup red_block_1.
10. Stack red_block_1 on orange_block_1.
11. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2. (holding blue)

Yes, this seems to work. Let's count the steps:

11 actions. This would be optimal if there's no shorter plan.

But wait, can we avoid some steps? For example, after step4 (stack black1 on blue), then step5 unstack black1. But if the goal is to hold blue, perhaps after step4, we can directly unstack blue from black_block_2? No, because blue has black1 on top. So we need to first unstack black1 from blue.

Alternatively, is there a way to stack something else on blue_block_1 without needing to move it again? For example, use red_block_1. But red is on the table after step2.

But if we stack red on blue_block_1 after step2:

1. Unstack red from white.
2. Putdown red.
3. Pickup red.
4. Stack red on blue. (requires blue is clear)
5. Then unstack red from blue.
6. Unstack blue from black2.

But this would require steps 3-6. But also need to satisfy other constraints.

But this approach may not address the need to put red on orange.

Alternatively, perhaps after stacking red on blue (step4), then we have to move red again to orange.

But this might complicate things.

Alternatively, what if we stack black_block_1 on blue_block_1 and leave it there? But the goal requires holding blue_block_1, so we need to unstack it. So we must unstack anything on top of blue_block_1.

So the plan must include unstacking any block on top of blue_block_1.

So the previous 11-step plan seems valid.

But is there a way to reduce steps further?

Let's see:

After step3, unstack black1 from yellow, yellow is clear. Then, in step7, unstack yellow from orange. But why not unstack yellow from orange earlier?

Wait, after step3, yellow is clear. So we can unstack yellow from orange at step4 instead of stacking black1 on blue. Let's try:

1. Unstack red from white. (hold red)
2. Putdown red. (red on table)
3. Unstack black1 from yellow. (hold black1)
4. Unstack yellow from orange. (hold yellow)
5. Putdown yellow. (satisfies constraint4)
6. Stack black1 on blue. (blue not clear)
7. Unstack black1 from blue.
8. Putdown black1.
9. Pickup red.
10. Stack red on orange. (satisfies constraint3)
11. Unstack blue from black2. (hold blue)

This is 11 steps again. So no reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps combine some actions. For example, after step3 (hold black1), stack it directly on blue. Then unstack it. Then proceed.

But the steps remain the same.

Another angle: the constraint requires that red is on orange at least once. So if we can stack red on orange without moving yellow and black, but that's impossible because orange has blocks on top.

Thus, we have to move yellow and black to clear orange.

But maybe there's a different order. Let's try:

1. Unstack black1 from yellow. (hold black1)
2. Putdown black1.
3. Unstack yellow from orange. (hold yellow)
4. Putdown yellow. (constraint4)
5. Unstack red from white. (hold red)
6. Stack red on orange. (constraint3)
7. Putdown red? No, stack requires holding.

Wait, steps:

1. Unstack black1 from yellow.
2. Putdown black1.
3. Unstack yellow from orange.
4. Putdown yellow.
5. Unstack red from white.
6. Stack red on orange.
7. Now, red is on orange. Then, need to stack something on blue to make it not clear.

8. Pickup black1.
9. Stack black1 on blue.
10. Unstack black1 from blue.
11. Putdown black1.
12. Unstack blue from black2.

But this is 12 steps. Plus the steps for putting red on table to meet the precondition for constraint1. Because constraint1 requires that before blue is not clear, red is on the table. In this plan, when we stack black1 on blue (step9), the last time red was on the table was step5 (unstack red from white). Wait, no: step5 is unstacking red from white, which requires holding red. Then step6 stacks red on orange. So red is never put down on the table in this plan. So the precondition for constraint1 (red on table before blue is not clear) is not met. Because in this plan, when we stack black1 on blue (step9), there was no previous state where red was on the table. So this plan would violate constraint1.

Thus, this approach is invalid.

Therefore, the earlier plan that includes putting red on the table is necessary.

Thus, the minimal steps seem to be 11 actions. Let's verify again:

Plan:

1. Unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1.
2. Putdown red_block_1. (red on table)
3. Unstack black_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (yellow clear)
4. Stack black_block_1 on blue_block_1. (blue not clear)
5. Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1.
6. Putdown black_block_1.
7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from orange_block_1.
8. Putdown yellow_block_1. (yellow on table)
9. Pickup red_block_1.
10. Stack red_block_1 on orange_block_1. (red on orange)
11. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2. (hold blue)

Now, check all constraints:

- Constraint1: step4, blue has black1 on top. Before that, step2 has red on table. Satisfied.
- Constraint2: step3, yellow becomes clear. So yes.
- Constraint3: step10, red on orange. Yes.
- Constraint4: step8, yellow on table. Yes.
- Constraint5: blue not on white always true. After step3, yellow is clear. From step3 onwards, yellow is clear. So for all states after step3, whenever blue is not on white (always), yellow is clear. For steps 1-2, blue is not on white, but yellow is not clear. But in those steps, there is a later state (step3 onwards) where yellow is clear. So constraint5's second part is satisfied.

This plan meets all constraints and is 11 steps. Let's see if there's a shorter way.

Is there a way to avoid stacking and unstacking black1 on blue? For example, use another block to satisfy constraint1. Like stacking red on blue after putting it on the table.

But that would require:

After step2 (red on table), stack red on blue. But then red is on blue (blue not clear), but before that, red was on table. So that satisfies constraint1. Then, to get red on orange, we have to unstack red from blue, stack on orange. Let's see:

Alternative plan:

1. Unstack red from white.
2. Putdown red. (red on table)
3. Pickup red. (now holding red)
4. Stack red on blue. (blue not clear)
5. Unstack red from blue. (now holding red)
6. Unstack yellow's blocks to clear orange.
7. Stack red on orange.
8. Unstack blue from black2. (goal)

But steps:

1. Unstack red from white.
2. Putdown red.
3. Pickup red.
4. Stack red on blue.
5. Unstack red from blue.
6. Putdown red. (or stack elsewhere)
7. Unstack black1 from yellow.
8. Putdown black1.
9. Unstack yellow from orange.
10. Putdown yellow.
11. Pickup red.
12. Stack red on orange.
13. Unstack blue from black2.

This is 13 steps, longer than the previous plan. So not better.

Thus, the 11-step plan seems better.

Another check: after step4 in the 11-step plan, blue_block_1 has black_block_1 on top. Then step5 unstack it, making blue clear again. Then step11 unstack blue from black2. But blue is clear in step11, so it's allowed.

Yes. All preconditions are met.

Therefore, the optimal plan is the 11-step plan.
