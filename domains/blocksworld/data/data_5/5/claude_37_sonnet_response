Alright, let's break down the problem:

We have a blocksworld scenario with 7 blocks: orange_block_1, yellow_block_1, black_block_1, black_block_2, white_block_1, red_block_1, and blue_block_1.

Initial state:
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- black_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- black_block_2 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2
- black_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is clear
- blue_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Goal:
- you are holding blue_block_1

Constraints:
1. At some point, blue_block_1 should not be clear (i.e., there should be a block on top of it).
2. If blue_block_1 is not clear, then before that, red_block_1 should be on the table.
3. At some point, yellow_block_1 should be clear.
4. At some point, red_block_1 should be on top of orange_block_1.
5. At some point, yellow_block_1 should be on the table.
6. At some point, blue_block_1 should not be on top of white_block_1.
7. If blue_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, then yellow_block_1 should be or become clear.

Let's first draw a picture of the initial state:

```
  B1   R1   B3  
  Y1   W1   B2  
  O1     
```

Where:
- B1 = black_block_1
- Y1 = yellow_block_1
- O1 = orange_block_1
- R1 = red_block_1
- W1 = white_block_1
- B2 = black_block_2
- B3 = blue_block_1

And the goal is to hold blue_block_1 (B3).

Now, the naive solution would be to just unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2, but we have a bunch of constraints to satisfy.

Constraint 1 says at some point, a block should be on top of blue_block_1. Let's say "we'll place some block X on top of blue_block_1."

Constraint 2 says that before we do that, red_block_1 should be on the table.

Constraint 3 says at some point, yellow_block_1 should be clear. In the initial state, yellow_block_1 has black_block_1 on top of it, so we'll need to unstack black_block_1 at some point.

Constraint 4 says at some point, red_block_1 should be on top of orange_block_1. In the initial state, red_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, and orange_block_1 has yellow_block_1 and black_block_1 on top of it. So, we'll need to do some moving.

Constraint 5 says at some point, yellow_block_1 should be on the table. In the initial state, yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1, so we'll need to unstack it.

Constraint 6 says at some point, blue_block_1 should not be on top of white_block_1. In the initial state, blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2, not white_block_1. But this constraint might indicate that we'll need to move blue_block_1 at some point.

Constraint 7 says that if blue_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, then yellow_block_1 should be or become clear. Initially, blue_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 (as I just mentioned), but yellow_block_1 is not clear (it has black_block_1 on top of it). So this constraint indicates we'll need to clear yellow_block_1 at some point.

To satisfy all these constraints and achieve the goal, I need to come up with a plan. Let's think through a sequence of actions:

1. First, let's unstack black_block_1 from yellow_block_1 to make yellow_block_1 clear, satisfying Constraint 3.
2. Then, let's unstack yellow_block_1 from orange_block_1 and put it on the table, satisfying Constraint 5.
3. Now, let's unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1 and put it on orange_block_1, satisfying Constraint 4.
4. At this point, red_block_1 is on the table, satisfying Constraint 2.
5. Now, I could place a block (let's say black_block_1) on top of blue_block_1, satisfying Constraint 1.
6. Then, I could unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1.
7. Finally, I can unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2, achieving the goal.

But wait, there's a small oversight in the above reasoning. After unstacking black_block_1 in step 1, I need to put it somewhere. I'll putdown black_block_1 on the table. Also, in step 3, I didn't precisely say where I'd put red_block_1. I'll say I putdown red_block_1 on the table and then stack it on orange_block_1.

As for Constraint 6, blue_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 in the initial state, so this constraint is already satisfied. But combined with Constraint 7, this means yellow_block_1 should be or become clear, which we're ensuring.

Let's revisit the plan:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from yellow_block_1.
2. Putdown black_block_1 on the table.
3. Unstack yellow_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Putdown yellow_block_1 on the table.
5. Unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1.
6. Putdown red_block_1 on the table.
7. Stack red_block_1 on orange_block_1.
8. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2.

But wait, we're not yet satisfying Constraint 1, which states that at some point, a block should be on top of blue_block_1. Let's add a couple of steps:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from yellow_block_1.
2. Putdown black_block_1 on the table.
3. Unstack yellow_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Putdown yellow_block_1 on the table.
5. Unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1.
6. Putdown red_block_1 on the table.
7. Stack red_block_1 on orange_block_1.
8. Stack black_block_1 on blue_block_1. (This satisfies Constraint 1).
9. Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1.
10. Putdown black_block_1 on the table.
11. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2.

But I actually need to end the sequence with "you are holding blue_block_1", so I think the end should just be "Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2".

Let's double-check the constraints:

1. "At some point, blue_block_1 should not be clear." Satisfied in step 8.
2. "If blue_block_1 is not clear, then before that, red_block_1 should be on the table." Satisfied; red_block_1 is on the table in step 6, before blue_block_1 becomes not clear in step 8.
3. "At some point, yellow_block_1 should be clear." Satisfied in step 1 and onwards after unstacking black_block_1.
4. "At some point, red_block_1 should be on top of orange_block_1." Satisfied in step 7.
5. "At some point, yellow_block_1 should be on the table." Satisfied in step 4.
6. "At some point, blue_block_1 should not be on top of white_block_1." Satisfied; blue_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 at any point in the sequence.
7. "If blue_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, then yellow_block_1 should be or become clear." Satisfied; blue_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 throughout the sequence, and yellow_block_1 becomes clear in step 1. Yellow remains clear for all remaining steps, as we never put a block on top of it again.

Actualy, let me revisit Constraint 6 and 7 to see if I'm interpretting them right:
- Constraint 6 says "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'blue_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1'". In the initial state, blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2, not on top of white_block_1. So, this constraint is already satisfied from the beginning.
- Constraint 7 says "If expression 'blue_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'there is no block on top of yellow_block_1, i.e., yellow_block_1 is clear' must hold at s or at some state after s." Since blue_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 from the beginning, this constraint requires that yellow_block_1 be cleared at some point, which we're ensuring in step 1.

I think I'm correct and the plan satisfies all constraints. Let's finalize the plan:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from yellow_block_1.
2. Putdown black_block_1 on the table.
3. Unstack yellow_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Putdown yellow_block_1 on the table.
5. Unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1.
6. Putdown red_block_1 on the table.
7. Stack red_block_1 on orange_block_1.
8. Stack black_block_1 on blue_block_1.
9. Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1.
10. Putdown black_block_1 on the table.
11. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2.

If I trace through this plan, I achieve all the constraints and the goal. 

Wait, let me double-check the final state:
- orange_block_1 has red_block_1 on top of it.
- yellow_block_1 is on the table and clear.
- black_block_1 is on the table and clear.
- black_block_2 is on the table and clear.
- white_block_1 is on the table and clear.
- red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 and clear.
- You are holding blue_block_1.

That looks good. This plan achieves the goal and satisfies all the constraints.

But I also need to ask whether there's a shorter plan. Let's simplify:

I know I need to:
- Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2 (goal).
- Stack a block on blue_block_1 and then remove it (Constraint 1).
- Before I do that, ensure red_block_1 is on the table (Constraint 2).
- Clear yellow_block_1 (Constraint 3 and 7).
- Place red_block_1 on orange_block_1 (Constraint 4).
- Move yellow_block_1 to the table (Constraint 5).

Could I maybe optimize the plan a bit more? I'm going to sketch it again:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (Satisfies Constraint 3)
2. Putdown black_block_1 on the table.
3. Unstack yellow_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Putdown yellow_block_1 on the table. (Satisfies Constraint 5)
5. Unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1.
6. Putdown red_block_1 on the table. (Satisfies Constraint 2)
7. Stack red_block_1 on orange_block_1. (Satisfies Constraint 4)
8. Stack black_block_1 on blue_block_1. (Satisfies Constraint 1)
9. Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1.
10. Putdown black_block_1 on the table.
11. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2. (Achieves the goal)

I think this is the most efficient plan. It's not a very short sequence, but each step serves a specific purpose, either in achieving the goal or satisfying a constraint. I can't think of a shorter sequence that achieves all of those objectives, and I think this plan is optimal in the sense that each action has a purpose.

Let me format the solution for the final answer:
