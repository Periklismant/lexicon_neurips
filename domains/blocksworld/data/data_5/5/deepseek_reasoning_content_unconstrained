Okay, let's see. The goal is to have the robotic arm holding blue_block_1. So I need to figure out the steps to get there from the initial state.

First, let me recall the initial state. Blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2, which is on the table. And blue_block_1 is clear, so nothing is on top of it. Also, the arm isn't holding anything.

To hold blue_block_1, the arm needs to pick it up. But wait, blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2. So to pick it up, can I do a pickup action? No, because pickup is only for blocks on the table. Since blue_block_1 is on another block, I need to unstack it from black_block_2. Right, the unstack action requires that the block (blue_block_1) is on top of another block (black_block_2), is clear, and the arm is empty.

So the first step would be to unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2. That would make the arm hold blue_block_1, which is exactly the goal. Wait, is that all? Let me check the preconditions for unstack. Yes, blue_block_1 is on black_block_2, it's clear, and the arm is not holding anything. So performing unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2 should work. Then, after that, the arm is holding blue_block_1, which is the goal. So the plan would just be that one action.

But wait, are there any blocks on top of blue_block_1? The initial state says blue_block_1 is clear, so no. So yes, unstacking is possible. Then the plan is just one action: unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2. That's the optimal plan because it's the shortest possible.
