Let's break down this planning problem and understand what we need to achieve:

Initial State:
- black_block_1 is on the table and clear
- red_block_1 is on the table with black_block_2 on top of it
- black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1 with green_block_1 on top of it
- orange_block_1 is on the table with brown_block_1 on top of it
- brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 with green_block_2 on top of it
- green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2 and clear
- green_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1 and clear
- You are not holding any block

Goal State:
- red_block_1 is clear (there is no block on top of it)

Constraints:
1. At some point, you must be holding black_block_2.
2. Before you hold black_block_2, you must ensure either green_block_2 is not clear or you're holding orange_block_1.
3. At some point, either black_block_2 must be on top of green_block_2 or red_block_1 must not be on the table.
4. In every state, green_block_1 must not be on the table.
5. At some point, either orange_block_1 must not be on the table or green_block_1 must be on top of red_block_1.
6. At some point, black_block_2 must be on top of black_block_1 AND green_block_2 must be on the table.

So the first step is to find a plan that gets from the initial state to the goal state (red_block_1 is clear) while satisfying all the constraints.

Starting from the initial state:
black_block_1: on table, clear
red_block_1: on table, not clear (has black_block_2 on it)
black_block_2: on red_block_1, not clear (has green_block_1 on it)
orange_block_1: on table, not clear (has brown_block_1 on it)
brown_block_1: on orange_block_1, not clear (has green_block_2 on it)
green_block_1: on black_block_2, clear
green_block_2: on brown_block_1, clear

And we want to end up with red_block_1 clear, which means removing black_block_2 from the top of red_block_1.

Given the constraints, it seems like we might need:
1. At some point, black_block_2 should be on top of black_block_1 (constraint 6).
2. We need to hold black_block_2 at some point (constraint 1).
3. We need to ensure green_block_1 is never on the table (constraint 4).

Let's think about a plan:

1. First, we need to remove the blocks on top of black_block_2 so we can eventually unstacked it. Since green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2, we'll need to remove it first.
2. At the same time, we also need to ensure constraint 2: before holding black_block_2, either green_block_2 is not clear or we're holding orange_block_1.
3. We also need to satisfy constraint 3, which requires either black_block_2 to be on top of green_block_2 or red_block_1 to not be on the table at some point.
4. Constraint 5 requires either orange_block_1 to not be on the table or green_block_1 to be on top of red_block_1.
5. Constraint 6 requires black_block_2 to be on top of black_block_1 and green_block_2 to be on the table at some point.

So let's start by working on these constraints:

1. To satisfy constraint 2, let's start by making sure green_block_2 is not clear (which means placing a block on top of it).
2. But first, we need to access green_block_2, which is on top of brown_block_1.

Let's start the plan:

1. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1. This makes green_block_2 in hand and brown_block_1 clear.
2. Place green_block_2 on the table to partially satisfy constraint 6.
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1. This makes brown_block_1 in hand and orange_block_1 clear.
4. Stack brown_block_1 on green_block_2, making green_block_2 not clear, which partially satisfies constraint 2.
5. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2. Now green_block_1 is in hand and black_block_2 is clear.
6. Stack green_block_1 on red_block_1. Now green_block_1 is on top of red_block_1, which partially satisfies constraint 5.
7. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. Now black_block_2 is in hand and red_block_1 is clear (our goal).
8. At this point, we're holding black_block_2, which satisfies constraint 1. We've also made sure that before holding black_block_2, green_block_2 is not clear (it has brown_block_1 on top of it), which satisfies constraint 2.
9. Now, we can stack black_block_2 on black_block_1 to partially satisfy constraint 6.

Wait, constraint 6 actually requires that both black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 AND green_block_2 is on the table in the same state. 

So let's revise the plan:

1. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Place green_block_2 on the table.
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Stack brown_block_1 on green_block_2, making green_block_2 not clear, which partially satisfies constraint 2.
5. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2.
6. Stack green_block_1 on orange_block_1. This gives us constraint 4 (green_block_1 is never on the table).
7. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. Now black_block_2 is in hand and red_block_1 is clear (our goal).
8. Stack black_block_2 on black_block_1. This, along with step 2, satisfies constraint 6 (black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 AND green_block_2 is on the table).

Let's check this plan with all the constraints:

1. Constraint 1: At some point, we're holding black_block_2 (step 7).
2. Constraint 2: Before holding black_block_2, green_block_2 is not clear (due to step 4).
3. Constraint 3: At some point, black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2 or red_block_1 is not on the table. This constraint is not satisfied in the plan so far.
4. Constraint 4: Green_block_1 is never on the table.
5. Constraint 5: At some point, orange_block_1 is not on the table or green_block_1 is on top of red_block_1. In the plan, we stack green_block_1 on orange_block_1, not on red_block_1. This constraint is not satisfied.
6. Constraint 6: At some point, black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 AND green_block_2 is on the table. This is satisfied in step 8 and step 2.

We need to revise the plan to satisfy constraints 3 and 5. Let's consider stacking green_block_1 on red_block_1 instead of orange_block_1 to satisfy constraint 5. For constraint 3, we can try to stack black_block_2 on green_block_2 at some point.

Let's revise the plan:

1. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Place green_block_2 on the table.
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Stack brown_block_1 on green_block_2, making green_block_2 not clear, which partially satisfies constraint 2.
5. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2.
6. Stack green_block_1 on red_block_1. This partially satisfies constraint 5.
7. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. Now black_block_2 is in hand and red_block_1 has green_block_1 on top of it.
8. Stack black_block_2 on green_block_2. This satisfies constraint 3 (black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2).
9. Unstack black_block_2 from green_block_2.
10. Stack black_block_2 on black_block_1. This, along with step 2, satisfies constraint 6 (black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 AND green_block_2 is on the table).
11. Now, to get red_block_1 clear (our goal), we need to unstack green_block_1 from red_block_1.
12. Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_1.
13. Stack green_block_1 on black_block_2.

Hmm but this doesn't seem right. Let's rethink the problem more carefully.

The goal is simple: we need red_block_1 to be clear. In the initial state, black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1 with green_block_1 on top of black_block_2. So, we need to remove black_block_2 from red_block_1.

Let's go through the constraints one by one and figure out a plan:

1. Constraint 1: At some point, we must be holding black_block_2. This is straightforward. We'll unstack black_block_2 at some point to achieve the goal.
2. Constraint 2: Before holding black_block_2, either green_block_2 is not clear or we're holding orange_block_1. We can satisfy this by making green_block_2 not clear before unstacking black_block_2.
3. Constraint 3: At some point, either black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2 or red_block_1 is not on the table. We can achieve this by placing black_block_2 on top of green_block_2 at some point.
4. Constraint 4: Green_block_1 must never be on the table. This means we can never perform a putdown action on green_block_1.
5. Constraint 5: At some point, either orange_block_1 is not on the table or green_block_1 is on top of red_block_1. We can achieve this by placing green_block_1 on top of red_block_1.
6. Constraint 6: At some point, black_block_2 must be on top of black_block_1 AND green_block_2 must be on the table. This requires careful coordination in the states.

Let's plan step by step:

1. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Move green_block_2 to the table (this will partly help with constraint 6).
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Stack brown_block_1 on green_block_2 (this makes green_block_2 not clear, helping with constraint 2).
5. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2.
6. Stack green_block_1 on red_block_1 (helping with constraint 5).
7. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1 (making us hold black_block_2, satisfying constraint 1, and the state now includes green_block_1 on top of red_block_1, satisfying constraint 5).
8. Stack black_block_2 on green_block_2 (satisfying constraint 3).
9. Unstack black_block_2 from green_block_2.
10. Stack black_block_2 on black_block_1 (at this point, we have black_block_2 on top of black_block_1 and green_block_2 on the table, though it's not clear, satisfying constraint 6).

But this plan isn't right for the goal. The goal is to make red_block_1 clear, but in step 6, we've stacked green_block_1 on red_block_1.

Ok,I think I see the problem. Let's re-think the plan:

1. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Place green_block_2 on the table (this will partly help with constraint 6).
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Stack brown_block_1 on green_block_2 (this makes green_block_2 not clear, helping with constraint 2).
5. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2.
6. Stack green_block_1 on black_block_1 (to keep it off the table, satisfying constraint 4).
7. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1 (achieving our goal of making red_block_1 clear, and also satisfying constraint 1).
8. Stack black_block_2 on green_block_2 (satisfying constraint 3).
9. Unstack black_block_2 from green_block_2.
10. Unstack brown_block_1 from green_block_2 (to make green_block_2 clear again).
11. Stack black_block_2 on black_block_1 (at this point, green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, so this isn't possible).

Let me rethink once more.

Constraint 5 says we need (at some point) either orange_block_1 to not be on the table or green_block_1 to be on top of red_block_1. If we opt for the second option, then we'd have to place green_block_1 on red_block_1, which would contradict our goal of making red_block_1 clear. So, it seems we should make orange_block_1 not on the table at some point to satisfy constraint 5.

So let's update the plan:

1. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Place green_block_2 on the table (this will partly help with constraint 6).
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Stack brown_block_1 on green_block_2 (this makes green_block_2 not clear, helping with constraint 2).
5. Pickup orange_block_1 (satisfying constraint 5).
6. Place orange_block_1 on the table.
7. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2.
8. Stack green_block_1 on orange_block_1 (to keep it off the table, satisfying constraint 4).
9. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1 (achieving our goal of making red_block_1 clear, and also satisfying constraint 1).
10. Stack black_block_2 on brown_block_1 (temporarily).
11. Unstack black_block_2 from brown_block_1.
12. Stack black_block_2 on black_block_1 (at this point, together with step 2, we satisfy constraint 6).

But I realized I still haven't addressed constraint 3: At some point, either black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2 or red_block_1 is not on the table.

Let's adjust the plan:

1. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Place green_block_2 on the table (this will partly help with constraint 6).
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Stack brown_block_1 on green_block_2 (this makes green_block_2 not clear, helping with constraint 2).
5. Pickup orange_block_1 (satisfying constraint 5).
6. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1.
7. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2.
8. Stack green_block_1 on orange_block_1 (to keep it off the table, satisfying constraint 4).
9. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1 (achieving our goal of making red_block_1 clear, and also satisfying constraint 1).
10. Stack black_block_2 on black_block_1. This, along with step 2, will satisfy constraint 6, but black_block_1 already has orange_block_1 and green_block_1 stacked on it.

Hmm, I see the challenge here. Let's carefully think step by step again. Here's the initial state:

black_block_1: on table, clear
red_block_1: on table, not clear (has black_block_2 on it)
black_block_2: on red_block_1, not clear (has green_block_1 on it)
orange_block_1: on table, not clear (has brown_block_1 on it)
brown_block_1: on orange_block_1, not clear (has green_block_2 on it)
green_block_1: on black_block_2, clear
green_block_2: on brown_block_1, clear

First, let's draw the plan to achieve just the goal: making red_block_1 clear. Then, we'll refine it to ensure all constraints are met.

1. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2 (green_block_1 in hand, black_block_2 clear).
2. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1 (red_block_1 clear - goal achieved).

Now, let's think about satisfying all the constraints:

- Constraint 1: At some point, hold black_block_2. This is already satisfied in the above plan.
- Constraint 2: Before holding black_block_2, ensure green_block_2 is not clear or hold orange_block_1. We can remove green_block_2 from brown_block_1 and then stack another block on it, or we can pickup orange_block_1.
- Constraint 3: At some point, black_block_2 on green_block_2 or red_block_1 not on table. After unstacking black_block_2, we can stack it on green_block_2.
- Constraint 4: Green_block_1 never on the table. We have to be careful when unstacking green_block_1 and make sure it's always on another block.
- Constraint 5: At some point, orange_block_1 not on table or green_block_1 on red_block_1. We can satisfy this by picking up orange_block_1 or by placing green_block_1 on red_block_1 (though this would contradict our goal).
- Constraint 6: At some point, black_block_2 on black_block_1 and green_block_2 on the table. This requires careful coordination.

Alright, let's go step by step:

1. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1 (green_block_2 in hand, brown_block_1 clear).
2. Place green_block_2 on the table (partly satisfying constraint 6).
3. Stack brown_block_1 on black_block_1 (making brown_block_1 on top of black_block_1, and black_block_1 not clear).
4. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2 (green_block_1 in hand, black_block_2 clear).
5. Stack green_block_1 on brown_block_1 (green_block_1 on top of brown_block_1, which is on top of black_block_1).
6. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1 (black_block_2 in hand, red_block_1 clear, satisfying constraint 1, and partly achieving the goal).
7. Stack black_block_2 on green_block_2 (satisfying constraint 3).
8. Unstack black_block_2 from green_block_2.
9. Pickup orange_block_1 (satisfying constraint 5).
10. Place orange_block_1 on the table.
11. Stack black_block_2 on black_block_1. Wait, this can't be done because black_block_1 has brown_block_1 on top of it.

Ok the problem with constraint 6 is that it requires three conditions to be true at the same time: (1) black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1, (2) green_block_2 is on the table, (3) black_block_1 is clear enough for black_block_2 to stack on it. 

So before stacking black_block_2 on black_block_1, I need to make sure black_block_1 is clear. Let me think again...

I need a plan where:
- red_block_1 is clear (the goal)
- black_block_2 is held at some point (constraint 1)
- Before holding black_block_2, green_block_2 is not clear or I'm holding orange_block_1 (constraint 2)
- At some point, black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2 or red_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 3)
- green_block_1 is never on the table (constraint 4)
- At some point, orange_block_1 is not on the table or green_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 (constraint 5)
- At some point, black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 AND green_block_2 is on the table (constraint 6)

Rethinking the problem again, a valid plan could be:

1. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1 (green_block_2 in hand, brown_block_1 clear).
2. Place green_block_2 on the table (partly satisfying constraint 6).
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1 (brown_block_1 in hand, orange_block_1 clear).
4. Stack brown_block_1 on green_block_2 (brown_block_1 on green_block_2, green_block_2 no longer clear, helping with constraint 2).
5. Pickup orange_block_1 (orange_block_1 in hand, satisfying constraint 5).
6. Place orange_block_1 on the table.
7. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2 (green_block_1 in hand, black_block_2 clear).
8. Stack green_block_1 on orange_block_1 (green_block_1 on orange_block_1, helping with constraint 4).
9. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1 (black_block_2 in hand, red_block_1 clear, satisfying constraint 1).
10. Stack black_block_2 on brown_block_1 (temporarily, to move it around without violating constraint 2).
11. Unstack black_block_2 from brown_block_1.
12. Stack black_block_2 on black_block_1 (at this point, both black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 AND green_block_2 is on the table, satisfying constraint 6).
13. Unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1.
14. Stack black_block_2 on green_block_2. This can't be done since green_block_2 has brown_block_1 on it.

I missed something. Constraint 3 requires that at some point, black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2 or red_block_1 is not on the table. 

Let's adjust the plan:

1. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1 (green_block_2 in hand, brown_block_1 clear).
2. Place green_block_2 on the table (partly satisfying constraint 6).
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1 (brown_block_1 in hand, orange_block_1 clear).
4. Stack brown_block_1 on green_block_2 (brown_block_1 on green_block_2, green_block_2 no longer clear, helping with constraint 2).
5. Pickup orange_block_1 (orange_block_1 in hand, satisfying constraint 5).
6. Place orange_block_1 on the table.
7. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2 (green_block_1 in hand, black_block_2 clear).
8. Stack green_block_1 on orange_block_1 (green_block_1 on orange_block_1, helping with constraint 4).
9. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1 (black_block_2 in hand, red_block_1 clear, satisfying constraint 1).
10. Stack black_block_2 on black_block_1 (black_block_2 on black_block_1, along with green_block_2 being on the table, satisfying constraint 6).
11. Unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1.
12. Unstack brown_block_1 from green_block_2 (brown_block_1 in hand, green_block_2 clear).
13. Stack black_block_2 on green_block_2 (satisfying constraint 3).

Let's review this plan:

The goal is red_block_1 is clear. After step 9, red_block_1 is clear, so we've achieved the goal.

Constraint 1 is that we're holding black_block_2 at some point. After step 9, we're holding black_block_2, so constraint 1 is satisfied.

Constraint 2 is that before holding black_block_2, green_block_2 is not clear or we're holding orange_block_1. In steps 3-4, we place brown_block_1 on top of green_block_2, making it not clear. So constraint 2 is satisfied.

Constraint 3 is that at some point, black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2 or red_block_1 is not on the table. In step 13, black_block_2 is stacked on green_block_2, so constraint 3 is satisfied.

Constraint 4 is that green_block_1 is never on the table. In our plan, green_block_1 goes from being on black_block_2 to being on orange_block_1. It's never placed on the table, so constraint 4 is satisfied.

Constraint 5 is that at some point, orange_block_1 is not on the table or green_block_1 is on top of red_block_1. In step 5, we pick up orange_block_1, making it not on the table, so constraint 5 is satisfied.

Constraint 6 is that at some point, black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 AND green_block_2 is on the table. In step 10, black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1, and from step 2, green_block_2 is on the table. So constraint 6 is satisfied.

Oh wait, but step 4 places brown_block_1 on green_block_2, so green_block_2 is no longer just on the table - it has a block on top of it. For constraint 6 to be strictly satisfied, we would need a state where green_block_2 is directly on the table without any block on top of it, AND black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1. Let me rethink this:

When I stack black_block_2 on black_block_1 in step 10, green_block_2 is on the table but has brown_block_1 on top of it. In step 12, I unstack brown_block_1 from green_block_2, so at that point, green_block_2 is clear and on the table. But black_block_2 is not on top of black_block_1 at this point (it's in the hand).

To satisfy constraint 6, I need to make sure that in at least one state, black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 AND green_block_2 is on the table (even if green_block_2 has something on top of it). Here, state means the state of the world.

Wait, constraint 6 specifically says: "The following conditions are all true: "black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1", "green_block_2 is on the table"". It seems the constraint is about green_block_2 being on the table, not necessarily being clear on the table. 

Let me review step 10 again: After stacking black_block_2 on black_block_1, at this point green_block_2 is on the table (albeit with brown_block_1 on top of it). So, both black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 AND green_block_2 is on the table, which satisfies constraint 6.

I think the plan works, let's go through it one more time to make sure:

1. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Place green_block_2 on the table.
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Stack brown_block_1 on green_block_2.
5. Pickup orange_block_1.
6. Place orange_block_1 on the table.
7. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2.
8. Stack green_block_1 on orange_block_1.
9. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.
10. Stack black_block_2 on black_block_1.
11. Unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1.
12. Unstack brown_block_1 from green_block_2.
13. Stack black_block_2 on green_block_2.

After step 9, red_block_1 is clear, so the goal is achieved. And all the constraints are satisfied as explained above.

Actually, in the goal statement, it says: "The task is to bring about the following situation: red_block_1 is clear". This means at the end of all the actions, red_block_1 should be clear. 

Since red_block_1 is clear after step 9, everything after that is just to satisfy constraints 3, 6. But the final state should still have red_block_1 clear. And indeed, in the final state of the above plan, red_block_1 is clear.

Let's check our plan against each of the constraints for one final verification:

1. Constraint 1: "you are holding black_block_2" must hold in at least one state. After step 9, we're holding black_block_2. Satisfied.
2. Constraint 2: Before we hold black_block_2, green_block_2 is not clear or we're holding orange_block_1. From steps 4-9, green_block_2 has brown_block_1 on top of it, making it not clear before we hold black_block_2 in step 9. Satisfied.
3. Constraint 3: "black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2" or "red_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in at least one state. In step 13, black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2. Satisfied.
4. Constraint 4: "green_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in every state. Green_block_1 is always on top of another block, never on the table. Satisfied.
5. Constraint 5: "orange_block_1 is not on the table" or "green_block_1 is on top of red_block_1" must hold in at least one state. In step 5, orange_block_1 is held (not on the table). Satisfied.
6. Constraint 6: "black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1" and "green_block_2 is on the table" must hold in at least one state. In step 10, black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1, and green_block_2 is on the table (with brown_block_1 on top of it). Satisfied.

All constraints are met, and the goal is achieved. The plan works!

Let me summarize the valid plan again:

```
unstack green_block_2 brown_block_1
putdown green_block_2
unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
stack brown_block_1 green_block_2
pickup orange_block_1
putdown orange_block_1
unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
stack green_block_1 orange_block_1

```

Let me make sure I'm using the exact naming format required by the prompt and double-check the entire plan once more:

```
unstack green_block_2 brown_block_1
putdown green_block_2
unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
stack brown_block_1 green_block_2
pickup orange_block_1
putdown orange_block_1
unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
stack green_block_1 orange_block_1
unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
stack black_block_2 black_block_1
unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
unstack brown_block_1 green_block_2
stack black_block_2 green_block_2
```

The goal: red_block_1 is clear. After step 9, red_block_1 is clear.

Constraint 1: "you are holding black_block_2" must hold in at least one state. After step 9, we're holding black_block_2.

Constraint 2: Before holding black_block_2, green_block_2 is not clear OR you're holding orange_block_1. From steps 4-9, green_block_2 has brown_block_1 on top of it, making it not clear before we hold black_block_2 in step 9.

Constraint 3: "black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2" OR "red_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in at least one state. In step 13, black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2.

Constraint 4: "green_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in every state. Green_block_1 is always on top of another block, never on the table.

Constraint 5: "orange_block_1 is not on the table" OR "green_block_1 is on top of red_block_1" must hold in at least one state. In step 5, orange_block_1 is held (not on the table).

Constraint 6: "black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1" AND "green_block_2 is on the table" must hold in at least one state. In step 10, black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1, and green_block_2 is on the table (with brown_block_1 on top of it).

All constraints are met, and the goal (red_block_1 is clear) is achieved. The plan is valid.
