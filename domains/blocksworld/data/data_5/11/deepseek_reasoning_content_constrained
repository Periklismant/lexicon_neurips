Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. First, I need to understand the initial state and the goal. The initial state has several blocks arranged in specific ways. The main goal is to make sure that red_block_1 is clear, meaning nothing is on top of it. Right now, black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1, and green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2. So, to clear red_block_1, I need to remove black_block_2 from it. But there's green_block_1 on top of black_block_2, so that has to be moved first. Then, after moving black_block_2, red_block_1 will be clear.

But wait, there are also several constraints that the plan must satisfy. Let's list them out to make sure I don't miss any:

1. The plan must include a state where the robotic arm is holding black_block_2.
2. Whenever the arm is holding black_block_2, there must have been an earlier state where either green_block_2 has a block on top (so it's not clear) or the arm was holding orange_block_1.
3. At some point, either black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2 or red_block_1 is not on the table.
4. In every state, green_block_1 must not be on the table. So green_block_1 must always be on top of another block.
5. At some state, either orange_block_1 is not on the table or green_block_1 is on top of red_block_1.
6. At some state, both black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 and green_block_2 is on the table.

Hmm, these constraints complicate things. Let me think about each one and how they affect the plan.

Starting with the main goal: clear red_block_1. The initial setup is red_block_1 has black_block_2, which has green_block_1. So to clear red_block_1, we need to move black_block_2. But to move black_block_2, we need to first move green_block_1. Since green_block_1 is clear (nothing on top), we can unstack it. Wait, green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2. So the action would be unstack green_block_1 black_block_2. But for that, the preconditions are that green_block_1 is clear (which it is), and the arm isn't holding anything. Then, after unstacking, the arm is holding green_block_1, and black_block_2 becomes clear.

Once green_block_1 is moved, we can then unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. But wait, after moving green_block_1, black_block_2 is clear. So we can unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. Then, put it somewhere else. That would leave red_block_1 clear, achieving the goal.

But let's check the constraints. Let's start mapping out possible steps and see where the constraints fit in.

First, let's outline the steps to achieve the main goal:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2. Now, the arm is holding green_block_1, and black_block_2 is clear.
2. Put down green_block_1 somewhere. But wait, constraint 4 says green_block_1 cannot be on the table in any state. So putting it on the table is not allowed. Therefore, we need to stack green_block_1 onto another block. But which block? Let's see the current blocks. The blocks on the table initially are black_block_1, red_block_1 (with black_block_2 on it), orange_block_1 (with brown_block_1 and green_block_2 on top). Wait, the initial state says brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1, and green_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1. So orange_block_1 has a tower: orange_block_1, brown_block_1, green_block_2. So those are all occupied. The other blocks on the table are black_block_1, red_block_1 (with black_block_2), and orange_block_1.

So after unstacking green_block_1, we can't put it on the table. So the only option is to stack it onto another clear block. Let's see which blocks are clear initially. The initial clear blocks are black_block_1, green_block_1, green_block_2. Wait, green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2, but initially, it's stated that green_block_1 is clear. Wait, no: the initial state says "there is no block on top of green_block_1", so green_block_1 is clear. So green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2, which is on red_block_1. So, after unstacking green_block_1, black_block_2 becomes clear. So we need to stack green_block_1 onto another block. Let's look for a clear block. The other clear blocks are black_block_1 (on table, clear), orange_block_1 is under brown_block_1, so not clear. red_block_1 is under black_block_2, which is under green_block_1. Wait, initial state: red_block_1 has black_block_2 on it, which has green_block_1. So red_block_1 is not clear. So the clear blocks are black_block_1, green_block_1, green_block_2. But after unstacking green_block_1, black_block_2 becomes clear. So possible targets to stack green_block_1 could be black_block_1 (since it's on the table and clear) or green_block_2 (which is on top of brown_block_1 and is clear). But stacking on green_block_2 would require that green_block_2 is clear, which it is. So after unstacking green_block_1, we can stack it onto either black_block_1 or green_block_2.

But let's consider constraint 6: at some state, black_block_2 must be on top of black_block_1 and green_block_2 must be on the table. So perhaps we need to stack black_block_2 onto black_block_1 at some point. Also, constraint 3 requires that at some state, either black_block_2 is on green_block_2 or red_block_1 is not on the table. Since the goal is to have red_block_1 clear, but it's on the table in the initial state. To make red_block_1 not on the table, it would need to be stacked under something, but that's not possible unless we move it. However, moving red_block_1 would require picking it up, which can't be done if there's a block on it. Since the initial state has black_block_2 on red_block_1, we can't pick up red_block_1 until we remove black_block_2. So maybe the other option for constraint 3 is to have black_block_2 on green_block_2. So maybe during the process, we can stack black_block_2 onto green_block_2.

But let's proceed step by step.

First, unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2. Now, arm holds green_block_1. Then, need to place it somewhere. Since green_block_1 can't be on the table (constraint 4), we must stack it. Let's stack it onto black_block_1. So stack green_block_1 black_block_1. Now, black_block_1 has green_block_1 on top, which is okay. Now, black_block_2 is clear. Then, we can unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. Now, arm holds black_block_2. Here, constraint 1 requires that at some state, the arm is holding black_block_2. This is satisfied here. Then, we need to put it somewhere. The options are to stack it on another clear block. Let's think about the constraints.

Constraint 6 requires that at some state, black_block_2 is on black_block_1 and green_block_2 is on the table. So if we stack black_block_2 onto black_block_1, that satisfies part of constraint 6. However, green_block_2 is initially on top of brown_block_1, which is on orange_block_1. To have green_block_2 on the table, we need to move it. But moving green_block_2 would require unstacking it from brown_block_1. Let's see: the initial tower is orange_block_1 (table), brown_block_1 (on orange), green_block_2 (on brown). So green_block_2 is clear. So to move green_block_2, we can unstack it from brown_block_1. Then, put it down on the table. That would satisfy green_block_2 being on the table. But that's an extra step, but necessary for constraint 6. So perhaps during the plan, after moving black_block_2 to black_block_1, we also need to move green_block_2 to the table.

But let's check if that's necessary. The plan's main goal is to clear red_block_1. Once we move black_block_2 off red_block_1, the goal is achieved. So the minimal steps would be unstack green_block_1, stack it somewhere, unstack black_block_2, put it somewhere. But with the constraints, we might need to do additional steps.

Let's outline the possible steps:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2. Now holding green_block_1. This action is allowed since green_block_1 is clear and the arm is empty. Preconditions met.

After this, black_block_2 becomes clear.

2. Stack green_block_1 onto black_block_1. Now, green_block_1 is on black_block_1, which is on the table. Since green_block_1 was being held, stacking requires that black_block_1 is clear, which it is. This action is valid. Now, black_block_1 is not clear (since green_block_1 is on it), but constraint 4 says green_block_1 must not be on the table. Here, it's on black_block_1, so that's okay. So this step is okay.

3. Now, unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. Since black_block_2 is clear (after step 1), and the arm is empty, this is allowed. Now, holding black_block_2. This satisfies constraint 1. Then, we need to put it somewhere. To satisfy constraint 6, perhaps stack it on black_block_1. But black_block_1 already has green_block_1. So can't stack there. Wait, no: stacking is placing on top of another block. So black_block_1 has green_block_1 on it. So green_block_1 is the top of that stack. So if we want to stack black_block_2 onto black_block_1, we need to first move green_block_1. But that would complicate things. Alternatively, stack black_block_2 onto another block. Let's see the possible options.

Alternatively, stack black_block_2 onto green_block_2. Let's see. Green_block_2 is currently on top of brown_block_1. To stack black_block_2 onto green_block_2, green_block_2 must be clear. Initially, green_block_2 is clear. But after step 1 and 2, green_block_2 is still on brown_block_1. So to stack black_block_2 onto green_block_2, we can do that. So:

4. Stack black_block_2 green_block_2. Preconditions: holding black_block_2 and green_block_2 is clear. Yes, green_block_2 is clear. So this is allowed. Then, after stacking, black_block_2 is on green_block_2, the arm is empty, green_block_2 is not clear anymore. This action would satisfy constraint 3 (black_block_2 is on green_block_2). But also, stacking here would require that green_block_2 is clear, which it is. So this action is possible.

After this, red_block_1 is clear (since black_block_2 is moved off), which is the goal. So steps 1-4 would achieve the main goal. Now, check constraints:

Constraint 1: Holding black_block_2 in step 3. Yes.

Constraint 2: If holding black_block_2 (step 3), then there must be an earlier state where either green_block_2 is not clear or holding orange_block_1. Let's see. Before step 3 (unstack black_block_2), the earlier steps are 1 and 2. In step 1, we were holding green_block_1. So not orange_block_1. In step 2, we stacked green_block_1 onto black_block_1. After that, the arm is empty. So before step 3, the states don't involve holding orange_block_1. Also, green_block_2's state: in the initial state, green_block_2 is on brown_block_1 and clear. After step 2, green_block_2 is still on brown_block_1 and clear. So in step 3, before unstacking black_block_2, green_block_2 is still clear. So the condition for constraint 2 requires that in some earlier state before step 3, either green_block_2 is not clear (which hasn't happened yet) or the arm was holding orange_block_1. Neither of which is true. So this violates constraint 2. Therefore, the current plan is invalid.

So I need to adjust the plan to satisfy constraint 2. How? The constraint says that whenever the arm is holding black_block_2, there must have been a previous state where either green_block_2 is not clear or the arm was holding orange_block_1.

So, in the current plan, when the arm is holding black_block_2 (step 3), there must be an earlier state where green_block_2 was not clear (i.e., something was on top of it) or the arm held orange_block_1. But in the initial state, green_block_2 is clear. So unless we do something to make green_block_2 not clear before step 3, or hold orange_block_1.

Option 1: Make green_block_2 not clear before step 3. How? By stacking something on it. But to stack something on green_block_2, the arm must be holding a block and green_block_2 must be clear. Let's see. After step 2 (stacking green_block_1 onto black_block_1), the arm is empty. Then, could we pick up another block and stack it on green_block_2? For example, unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1. Wait, but green_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1. So to unstack green_block_2, preconditions are that green_block_2 is clear (which it is), the arm is empty. So:

After step 2, maybe do:

3. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1. Now, holding green_block_2. Then stack green_block_2 onto some other block. But then, green_block_2 is moved, and brown_block_1 becomes clear. But why would we do this? Because if we stack something on green_block_2 before step where we hold black_block_2, then in that state, green_block_2 is not clear. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 2, instead of proceeding to unstack black_block_2, first manipulate the orange_block_1 tower.

Wait, the orange_block_1 tower is orange_block_1 (table), brown_block_1 (on orange), green_block_2 (on brown). To get green_block_2 not clear, perhaps stack something on it. But the arm is empty after step 2. So pick up a block and stack it on green_block_2. Which block? The available clear blocks are black_block_2 (on red_block_1, but after step 1, it's clear). Wait, after step 1, green_block_1 is removed from black_block_2, making black_block_2 clear. So after step 2, black_block_2 is clear, so we could unstack it. Wait, but that's what step 3 was originally. But if we need to make green_block_2 not clear before step 3 (holding black_block_2), then perhaps first stack something on green_block_2.

But how? Let's see. After step 2, the arm is empty. The available blocks that are clear: black_block_2 (clear), green_block_2 (clear), brown_block_1 (has green_block_2 on it, so not clear). Wait, no. brown_block_1 is under green_block_2. So brown_block_1 is not clear. The clear blocks are black_block_2, green_block_2, and black_block_1 (which has green_block_1 on it now, so not clear). Wait, after step 2, black_block_1 has green_block_1 on it, so black_block_1 is not clear. So the clear blocks after step 2 are black_block_2 and green_block_2.

So, the arm is empty. So possible actions: pickup a block from the table. But black_block_1 is on the table but has green_block_1 on it, so not clear. red_block_1 has black_block_2 on it. orange_block_1 is under brown_block_1. So the only clear blocks on the table are black_block_2 (on red_block_1, but it's clear) and green_block_2 (on brown_block_1, clear). Wait, but black_block_2 is on red_block_1, so to pick up black_block_2, we can unstack it. But that's what step 3 was supposed to do.

Alternatively, unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1. That's possible. Let's try:

After step 2 (stacked green_block_1 on black_block_1), arm is empty. Then:

3. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1. Now, holding green_block_2. Then, stack green_block_2 onto some block. Let's stack it onto black_block_2. But black_block_2 is on red_block_1 and is clear. So:

4. Stack green_block_2 black_block_2. Now, green_block_2 is on black_block_2. This makes green_block_2 not clear (since something is on top?), wait, no: stacking green_block_2 onto black_block_2 would place green_block_2 on black_block_2. Wait, no: the arm is holding green_block_2, so stack green_block_2 onto black_block_2. Preconditions: holding green_block_2 and black_block_2 is clear. Both are true. After stacking, green_block_2 is on black_block_2, which is on red_block_1. Then, black_block_2 is no longer clear. So now, green_block_2 is on black_block_2. But this action would require that black_block_2 is clear, which it is. So this is allowed.

Now, after this, in the state after step 4, green_block_2 is on black_block_2. So in this state, green_block_2 has a block (green_block_2) on top of it? Wait, no: green_block_2 is on black_block_2. So green_block_2 is on top of black_block_2, but nothing is on top of green_block_2. So green_block_2 is clear. Wait, no. The action stack green_block_2 black_block_2 would place green_block_2 on black_block_2, making black_block_2 not clear, and green_block_2 clear. So then, after this, green_block_2 is clear. Hmm, so that doesn't make green_block_2 not clear. Wait, maybe I need to stack something else on top of green_block_2.

Alternatively, after unstacking green_block_2, we could stack it onto another block where it's not clear. But I'm not sure. Let's think again.

After step 3, we are holding green_block_2. To make green_block_2 not clear, we need to place another block on top of it. But since the arm can only hold one block at a time, we can't do that in one step. Alternatively, perhaps this approach isn't working. Let's think of another way to satisfy constraint 2.

Constraint 2 says that when holding black_block_2, there must have been a previous state where either green_block_2 was not clear or the arm held orange_block_1.

So, maybe instead of stacking something on green_block_2, we could have the arm hold orange_block_1 before holding black_block_2. How? To hold orange_block_1, we need to unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1. But brown_block_1 has green_block_2 on it. So we need to first unstack green_block_2, then unstack brown_block_1, then pickup orange_block_1. But orange_block_1 is on the table. To pickup orange_block_1, it must be clear and on the table. But initially, orange_block_1 has brown_block_1 on it, so it's not clear. So to make orange_block_1 clear, we need to remove brown_block_1 and green_block_2.

So, for example:

After step 2 (stacked green_block_1 on black_block_1), the arm is empty. Then:

3. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1. Now holding green_block_2.

4. Stack green_block_2 somewhere, maybe on the table. But constraint 4 requires that green_block_1 is never on the table, but green_block_2 can be. Wait, constraint 4 is about green_block_1. So stacking green_block_2 on the table is allowed. Then:

4. Putdown green_block_2. Now, green_block_2 is on the table. Now, brown_block_1 is clear.

5. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1. Now, holding brown_block_1.

6. Putdown brown_block_1. Now, orange_block_1 is clear and on the table.

7. Pickup orange_block_1. Now, holding orange_block_1.

So at this point, the arm is holding orange_block_1. Then, after this, we can proceed to unstack black_block_2.

But this seems like a lot of steps, but perhaps necessary to satisfy constraint 2. Because then, when we later hold black_block_2 (step X), we would have previously held orange_block_1 (step 7). That satisfies the second part of constraint 2.

But this is adding several steps. Let's see if this approach works.

Continuing:

After step 7, we are holding orange_block_1. Then, we need to put it down somewhere. Because to unstack black_block_2, the arm needs to be empty. So:

8. Putdown orange_block_1. Now, orange_block_1 is on the table and clear.

Now, the arm is empty. Then:

9. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. Now holding black_block_2.

At this point, when we are holding black_block_2 (step 9), the previous step where we held orange_block_1 (step 7) satisfies constraint 2. Because in step 7, the arm was holding orange_block_1, which is an earlier state. So constraint 2 is satisfied.

Then, proceed to put black_block_2 somewhere. But we also need to satisfy constraint 6: at some state, black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 and green_block_2 is on the table. In the current steps, green_block_2 was put on the table in step 4. So green_block_2 is on the table. So if we stack black_block_2 onto black_block_1 now, that would satisfy constraint 6.

But black_block_1 currently has green_block_1 on it. So we can't stack black_block_2 on black_block_1. Therefore, we need to move green_block_1 first. But moving green_block_1 requires unstacking it from black_block_1. But green_block_1 is clear (after step 2, when we stacked it on black_block_1). So:

10. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_1. Now holding green_block_1.

11. Stack green_block_1 onto black_block_2. Wait, but black_block_2 is currently being held. Wait, no. After step 9, we are holding black_block_2. So step 10 would require putting down black_block_2 first. Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me retrace.

After step 9: holding black_block_2. Need to stack it somewhere. Let's stack it onto black_block_1. But black_block_1 has green_block_1. So we can't stack there. So maybe stack onto orange_block_1, which is on the table and clear (since we put it down in step 8). So:

10. Stack black_block_2 orange_block_1. Now, black_block_2 is on orange_block_1. Then, putdown.

Wait, no: stack action requires that we are holding the first block and the second block is clear. So stack black_block_2 orange_block_1. orange_block_1 is clear (after step 8). So yes. Then, stacking black_block_2 on orange_block_1. Now, black_block_2 is on orange_block_1, and the arm is empty. But this doesn't help with constraint 6. Constraint 6 requires black_block_2 on black_block_1 and green_block_2 on the table. So perhaps we need to move green_block_1 from black_block_1 first.

But this is getting too long. Let's see if there's a more efficient way.

Alternatively, after step 9 (holding black_block_2), stack it on green_block_2 (which is on the table). So:

10. Stack black_block_2 green_block_2. Preconditions: holding black_block_2 and green_block_2 is clear. green_block_2 is on the table and clear. So yes. After stacking, black_block_2 is on green_block_2, green_block_2 is not clear, arm is empty. This satisfies constraint 3 (black_block_2 is on green_block_2). Also, green_block_2 is on the table (from step 4). So constraint 6 requires that at some state, black_block_2 is on black_block_1 and green_block_2 is on the table. But in this case, black_block_2 is on green_block_2, not black_block_1. So this doesn't satisfy constraint 6. So we need to have a state where black_block_2 is on black_block_1. 

But how? If we can't stack black_block_2 onto black_block_1 because green_block_1 is there, then maybe we need to move green_block_1 first. Let's consider:

After step 9 (holding black_block_2):

10. Putdown black_block_2 on the table. Now, black_block_2 is on the table. But then, red_block_1 is clear, which is the goal. But then, we need to satisfy constraint 6. So perhaps after putting black_block_2 on the table, we can pick it up again and stack it on black_block_1. But that would require moving green_block_1 first.

So:

10. Putdown black_block_2. Now, black_block_2 is on the table, clear.

11. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_1. Now, holding green_block_1.

12. Stack green_block_1 onto black_block_2. Now, green_block_1 is on black_block_2, which is on the table. But constraint 4 says green_block_1 must not be on the table. Wait, black_block_2 is on the table, so green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2. That's allowed because green_block_1 is not on the table. So this is okay.

13. Pickup black_block_2. Wait, no. black_block_2 has green_block_1 on it. So it's not clear. So we can't pickup black_block_2. This approach isn't working.

Alternative idea: Instead of stacking green_block_1 onto black_block_1 initially, stack it onto green_block_2. Let's backtrack.

Original steps 1 and 2:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2.

2. Stack green_block_1 onto green_block_2. But green_block_2 is on brown_block_1. So after stacking, green_block_1 is on green_block_2. Now, green_block_2 is not clear. This would satisfy constraint 2's condition of green_block_2 not being clear in an earlier state. Then, when we unstack black_block_2 (step 3), we have an earlier state where green_block_2 was not clear. So this might satisfy constraint 2.

Let me try this approach.

Revised steps:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2. Now holding green_block_1.

2. Stack green_block_1 onto green_block_2. Preconditions: holding green_block_1 and green_block_2 is clear. Green_block_2 is clear initially. So this is allowed. After stacking, green_block_1 is on green_block_2, green_block_2 is not clear. Now, in this state, green_block_2 has green_block_1 on top, so it's not clear. This satisfies the condition for constraint 2, because when we later hold black_block_2, there was an earlier state (step 2) where green_block_2 was not clear.

3. Now, unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. Preconditions: black_block_2 is clear (yes, since green_block_1 was moved). Arm is empty (after step 2, arm is empty). So this is allowed. Now, holding black_block_2. This satisfies constraint 1.

Then, to satisfy constraint 6, we need to have a state where black_block_2 is on black_block_1 and green_block_2 is on the table. Currently, green_block_2 is on brown_block_1 (since step 2 stacked green_block_1 onto green_block_2, which is on brown_block_1). So green_block_2 is not on the table. So we need to move green_block_2 to the table. But how?

Wait, after step 2, green_block_1 is on green_block_2, which is on brown_block_1. So green_block_2 is part of the tower orange_block_1, brown_block_1, green_block_2, green_block_1.

To move green_block_2 to the table, we need to unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1, but there's green_block_1 on top of it. So first, unstack green_block_1 from green_block_2.

But this would require:

4. Unstack green_block_1 from green_block_2. Now, holding green_block_1.

5. Putdown green_block_1. But constraint 4 forbids green_block_1 from being on the table. So we have to stack it somewhere else. Let's stack it onto black_block_1.

5. Stack green_block_1 black_block_1. Now, green_block_1 is on black_block_1, which is allowed.

6. Now, green_block_2 is clear again. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1. Now, holding green_block_2.

7. Putdown green_block_2. Now, green_block_2 is on the table.

Now, green_block_2 is on the table. Then, to satisfy constraint 6, we need to have black_block_2 on black_block_1. So:

8. Stack black_block_2 black_block_1. Preconditions: holding black_block_2 (step 3) and black_block_1 is clear. But after step 5, black_block_1 has green_block_1 on it. So black_block_1 is not clear. So this is not possible. Therefore, this approach isn't working.

Alternative idea: After step 3 (holding black_block_2), stack it onto black_block_1. But black_block_1 has green_block_1 (from step 5). So can't. 

This is getting very complicated. Let's try to find a different path that satisfies all constraints.

Another approach: To satisfy constraint 6, we need to have a state where black_block_2 is on black_block_1 and green_block_2 is on the table. Let's make that happen.

First, move green_block_2 to the table. How?

The tower is orange_block_1, brown_block_1, green_block_2. To move green_block_2 to the table:

1. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1. Now, holding green_block_2.

2. Putdown green_block_2. Now, green_block_2 is on the table.

Now, brown_block_1 is clear. Then, unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1.

3. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1. Now, holding brown_block_1.

4. Putdown brown_block_1. Now, orange_block_1 is clear.

Now, with green_block_2 on the table (step 2), we can work towards stacking black_block_2 on black_block_1. But first, we need to clear red_block_1.

The initial state of red_block_1 has black_block_2 on it, with green_block_1 on top. So:

5. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2. Now, holding green_block_1.

6. Stack green_block_1 somewhere that's not the table. Let's stack it onto brown_block_1 (which is on the table now). Stack green_block_1 brown_block_1. Now, green_block_1 is on brown_block_1, which is on the table. This is allowed because green_block_1 is not on the table.

7. Now, unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. Now, holding black_block_2. This satisfies constraint 1.

Then, stack black_block_2 onto black_block_1. Since black_block_1 is on the table and clear (initial state), we can stack.

8. Stack black_block_2 black_block_1. Now, black_block_2 is on black_block_1. green_block_2 is on the table from step 2. So this satisfies constraint 6.

Now, the main goal is to clear red_block_1, which is achieved after step 7 (black_block_2 is unstacked from red_block_1). But after step 8, red_block_1 is clear.

But we need to check all constraints. Let's go through them:

Constraint 1: Holding black_block_2 in step 7. Yes.

Constraint 2: When holding black_block_2 (step 7), there must have been an earlier state where green_block_2 was not clear or holding orange_block_1. Before step 7, steps 1-6. In step 1, unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1. At this point, green_block_2 was on brown_block_1 and clear. After step 1, green_block_2 is held, so brown_block_1 is clear. Then step 2: putdown green_block_2. Then, green_block_2 is on the table and clear. So in the steps before step 7, green_block_2 was on the table and clear, so not not clear. Also, did we hold orange_block_1? No. So this violates constraint 2. Therefore, this approach also fails.

This is very tricky. Let's try to integrate the previous approaches.

Let me try to outline a plan that satisfies all constraints:

1. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1. Now holding green_block_2.

2. Stack green_block_2 onto black_block_2 (which is on red_block_1). This requires that black_block_2 is clear. But initially, black_block_2 has green_block_1 on it. So this is not possible. So first, need to unstack green_block_1.

Alternative steps:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2. Now holding green_block_1.

2. Stack green_block_1 onto green_block_2 (which is on brown_block_1). This makes green_block_2 not clear. Now, green_block_2 has green_block_1 on top.

3. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. Now holding black_block_2. This satisfies constraint 1.

At this point, before step 3, in step 2, green_block_2 was not clear (has green_block_1 on it). So when we hold black_block_2 (step 3), there's an earlier state (step 2) where green_block_2 is not clear. So constraint 2 is satisfied.

4. Stack black_block_2 onto black_block_1. Preconditions: holding black_block_2, black_block_1 is clear. Initially, black_block_1 is clear. So yes. Now, black_block_2 is on black_block_1.

5. Now, move green_block_2 to the table. To do that, first unstack green_block_1 from green_block_2.

5. Unstack green_block_1 from green_block_2. Now holding green_block_1.

6. Stack green_block_1 onto black_block_2 (which is on black_block_1). This requires black_block_2 is clear. After step 4, black_block_2 is clear. So yes.

7. Now, unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1. Now holding green_block_2.

8. Putdown green_block_2. Now, green_block_2 is on the table.

Now, in step 8, green_block_2 is on the table. In step 4, black_block_2 is on black_block_1. So constraint 6 is satisfied.

The main goal is achieved after step 3 (black_block_2 is removed from red_block_1). But after step 4, red_block_1 is clear. So the goal is maintained.

Now, check other constraints:

Constraint 3: At some state, black_block_2 is on green_block_2 or red_block_1 is not on the table. In this plan, red_block_1 remains on the table throughout. But after step 4, black_block_2 is on black_block_1, not green_block_2. So this doesn't satisfy constraint 3. So need to adjust.

Wait, in step 2, green_block_1 is stacked on green_block_2. So after step 2, black_block_2 is on red_block_1, green_block_2 has green_block_1 on it. Then, after step 3, black_block_2 is held. Then, step 4 stacks black_block_2 on black_block_1. So at no point is black_block_2 on green_block_2. So constraint 3 requires that either black_block_2 is on green_block_2 or red_block_1 is not on the table. Since red_block_1 is still on the table, this is not satisfied. So this plan fails constraint 3.

To satisfy constraint 3, maybe instead of stacking black_block_2 on black_block_1, stack it on green_block_2.

Revised steps:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2. Hold green_block_1.

2. Stack green_block_1 onto green_block_2. Now, green_block_2 is not clear.

3. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. Now, holding black_block_2.

4. Stack black_block_2 onto green_block_2. Now, green_block_2 has black_block_2 on it. So constraint 3 is satisfied (black_block_2 is on green_block_2).

5. Now, need to move green_block_2 to the table for constraint 6. But green_block_2 has black_block_2 on it. So first, unstack black_block_2.

But wait, after step 4, black_block_2 is on green_block_2, which is on brown_block_1. To move green_block_2 to the table, need to first remove black_block_2 and green_block_1.

This is getting too complex. Let's try another approach.

Alternative plan that satisfies all constraints:

- Ensure that during the process, green_block_2 is moved to the table (for constraint 6).

- Also, ensure that black_block_2 is stacked on black_block_1.

- And that during the process, the constraints are met.

Let's try:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2. Now, holding green_block_1.

2. Stack green_block_1 onto green_block_2 (which is on brown_block_1). Now, green_block_2 is not clear.

3. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. Now, holding black_block_2. Satisfies constraint 1.

4. Stack black_block_2 onto black_block_1. Now, black_block_2 is on black_block_1. green_block_2 is on brown_block_1 with green_block_1 on it.

5. Now, need to move green_block_2 to the table. To do that, first unstack green_block_1 from green_block_2.

5. Unstack green_block_1 from green_block_2. Now holding green_block_1.

6. Stack green_block_1 onto black_block_2 (which is on black_block_1). Now, green_block_1 is on black_block_2.

7. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1. Now, holding green_block_2.

8. Putdown green_block_2. Now, green_block_2 is on the table.

Now, in this state:

- black_block_2 is on black_block_1 (step 4), green_block_2 is on the table (step 8). So constraint 6 is satisfied.

- The main goal (red_block_1 clear) is achieved after step 3.

- Constraint 3 is satisfied in step 4: black_block_2 is on black_block_1, which doesn't directly help, but during step 4, green_block_2 has green_block_1 on it (from step 2). Wait, no. After step 4, green_block_2 is on brown_block_1 with green_block_1 on top. So in step 3, when we unstack black_block_2, green_block_2 was not clear (due to step 2). So constraint 3 would require that in some state, either black_block_2 is on green_block_2 or red_block_1 is not on the table. In this plan, red_block_1 is still on the table, but black_block_2 is on black_block_1. So constraint 3 is not satisfied. So this plan fails constraint 3.

Hmm. This is really challenging. Let's try to ensure constraint 3 is met.

Constraint 3 requires that at some state, either black_block_2 is on green_block_2 or red_block_1 is not on the table. Since moving red_block_1 would require picking it up, which is impossible while something is on it, we can't make red_block_1 not on the table. So the only option is to have black_block_2 on green_block_2 at some point.

So let's revise the plan to include that.

Steps:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2. Holding green_block_1.

2. Stack green_block_1 onto green_block_2. Now, green_block_2 is not clear.

3. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. Holding black_block_2.

4. Stack black_block_2 onto green_block_2. Now, black_block_2 is on green_block_2. This satisfies constraint 3.

5. Now, to satisfy constraint 6, need to have black_block_2 on black_block_1 and green_block_2 on the table. So we need to move black_block_2 from green_block_2 to black_block_1 and move green_block_2 to the table.

But this requires additional steps:

5. Unstack black_block_2 from green_block_2. But green_block_2 has green_block_1 on top (from step 2). So first, unstack green_block_1.

5. Unstack green_block_1 from green_block_2. Now holding green_block_1.

6. Stack green_block_1 somewhere else. Let's stack it onto black_block_1.

7. Now, unstack black_block_2 from green_block_2. Now holding black_block_2.

8. Stack black_block_2 onto black_block_1.

9. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1. Now holding green_block_2.

10. Putdown green_block_2. Now, green_block_2 is on the table.

Now, in this state:

- black_block_2 is on black_block_1 (step 8).

- green_block_2 is on the table (step 10). So constraint 6 is satisfied.

- Constraint 3 is satisfied in step 4 (black_block_2 on green_block_2).

- Constraint 2 is satisfied because when holding black_block_2 in step 3, there's an earlier state (step 2) where green_block_2 was not clear.

- Constraint 5 requires that at some state, either orange_block_1 is not on the table or green_block_1 is on red_block_1. In this plan, orange_block_1 is still on the table (under brown_block_1, which was not moved). So we need to ensure that at some point, green_block_1 is on red_block_1 or orange_block_1 is not on the table. 

Looking at the steps: green_block_1 is stacked onto black_block_1 in step 6. So orange_block_1 is still on the table. So this violates constraint 5. 

To satisfy constraint 5, we need to either move orange_block_1 off the table or stack green_block_1 onto red_block_1.

But moving orange_block_1 requires unstacking brown_block_1 and green_block_2. But in this plan, after step 10, green_block_2 is on the table. So let's see:

After step 10, green_block_2 is on the table. brown_block_1 is still on orange_block_1. So orange_block_1 is not clear. To pickup orange_block_1, we need to clear it. So steps after step 10:

11. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1. Now holding brown_block_1.

12. Putdown brown_block_1. Now, orange_block_1 is clear and on the table.

13. Pickup orange_block_1. Now, holding orange_block_1.

14. Putdown orange_block_1. But this doesn't take it off the table. So not helpful. Alternatively, stack orange_block_1 onto something.

Alternatively, after step 10, we can stack green_block_1 onto red_block_1 to satisfy constraint 5.

In step 6, green_block_1 is stacked onto black_block_1. So to move it to red_block_1:

11. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_1. Now holding green_block_1.

12. Stack green_block_1 onto red_block_1. Now, red_block_1 has green_block_1 on it, which satisfies the second part of constraint 5 (green_block_1 on red_block_1). But this would violate the main goal of red_block_1 being clear. So this is not allowed.

Therefore, this approach fails constraint 5.

This is extremely complex. Perhaps the optimal plan requires more steps than initially expected, but given the constraints, it's necessary.

Let's try to find a plan that addresses all constraints:

1. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1. Now holding green_block_2.

2. Stack green_block_2 onto black_block_1. Now, green_block_2 is on black_block_1. This makes green_block_2 not clear. 

3. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2. Now holding green_block_1.

4. Stack green_block_1 onto green_block_2. Now, green_block_2 has green_block_1 on it. 

5. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. Now holding black_block_2 (satisfies constraint 1). At this point, constraint 2 is satisfied because in step 4, green_block_2 was not clear.

6. Stack black_block_2 onto green_block_2. Now, black_block_2 is on green_block_2 (satisfies constraint 3).

7. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. Now holding green_block_2.

8. Putdown green_block_2. Now, green_block_2 is on the table (satisfies part of constraint 6).

9. Unstack black_block_2 from green_block_2. Now holding black_block_2.

10. Stack black_block_2 onto black_block_1. Now, black_block_2 is on black_block_1 (satisfies the other part of constraint 6).

Now, check constraints:

- Constraint 5: At some state, orange_block_1 is not on the table or green_block_1 is on red_block_1. In this plan, orange_block_1 is still on the table. But green_block_1 is on green_block_2 (step 4), which is on black_block_1. So green_block_1 is not on red_block_1. So constraint 5 is not satisfied. 

To address this, we need to either move orange_block_1 off the table or stack green_block_1 onto red_block_1. But stacking on red_block_1 would conflict with the goal. So move orange_block_1.

After step 10, we can:

11. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1. Now holding brown_block_1.

12. Stack brown_block_1 onto black_block_2 (which is on black_block_1). Now, brown_block_1 is on black_block_2.

13. Now, orange_block_1 is clear. Pickup orange_block_1. Now, holding orange_block_1.

14. Stack orange_block_1 onto brown_block_1. Now, orange_block_1 is on brown_block_1, which is on black_block_2. So orange_block_1 is not on the table. This satisfies constraint 5.

Now, all constraints are satisfied.

But this plan is very long. However, given the constraints, this might be necessary.

But wait, let's check each constraint:

- Constraint 1: Holding black_block_2 in steps 5 and 9. Yes.

- Constraint 2: When holding black_block_2 (step 5), previous state (step 4) where green_block_2 was not clear. Yes.

- Constraint 3: In step 6, black_block_2 is on green_block_2. Yes.

- Constraint 4: green_block_1 is never on the table. In this plan, green_block_1 is stacked on green_block_2 (step 4), which is on black_block_1. Yes.

- Constraint 5: In step 14, orange_block_1 is not on the table. Yes.

- Constraint 6: In step 10, black_block_2 is on black_block_1 and green_block_2 is on the table (step 8). Yes.

This seems to satisfy all constraints. However, the main goal is to clear red_block_1, which is achieved in step 5 (unstacking black_block_2 from red_block_1). The rest of the steps are to satisfy the other constraints.

But the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). This plan has many steps. Maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternative approach: Find a way to satisfy all constraints with fewer steps.

Let me try to integrate the necessary constraints into the minimal steps required to clear red_block_1.

The main steps are:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2.

2. Stack green_block_1 somewhere (not table).

3. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.

4. Stack black_block_2 somewhere.

To satisfy the constraints:

- Constraint 1: Step 3 holds black_block_2.

- Constraint 2: Before step 3, either green_block_2 not clear or holding orange_block_1. Let's make green_block_2 not clear before step 3.

- Constraint 3: During the plan, either black_block_2 on green_block_2 or red_block_1 not on table. Since red_block_1 remains on table, need black_block_2 on green_block_2.

- Constraint 6: At some state, black_block_2 on black_block_1 and green_block_2 on table.

So let's try:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2. Hold green_block_1.

2. Stack green_block_1 onto green_block_2 (now on brown_block_1). Now, green_block_2 not clear.

3. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. Hold black_block_2 (constraint 1 met).

4. Stack black_block_2 onto green_block_2 (constraint 3 met).

5. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1 (but green_block_2 has black_block_2 and green_block_1 on it, so need to unstack those first).

Wait, after step 4, black_block_2 is on green_block_2. green_block_2 is on brown_block_1. green_block_1 is on green_block_2. So to move green_block_2 to the table:

5. Unstack green_block_1 from green_block_2. Hold green_block_1.

6. Stack green_block_1 somewhere else, e.g., black_block_1.

7. Unstack black_block_2 from green_block_2. Hold black_block_2.

8. Stack black_block_2 onto black_block_1 (constraint 6 part 1).

9. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1. Hold green_block_2.

10. Putdown green_block_2 (constraint 6 part 2).

Now, check constraints:

- Constraint 5: Need to have either orange_block_1 not on table or green_block_1 on red_block_1. In this plan, green_block_1 is on black_block_1 (step 6). So need to move orange_block_1.

11. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1. Hold brown_block_1.

12. Stack brown_block_1 onto black_block_2 (on black_block_1).

13. Unstack orange_block_1 from table. Can't, because it's under brown_block_1. Wait, after step 11, brown_block_1 is moved, so orange_block_1 is clear. 

14. Pickup orange_block_1. Now, holding orange_block_1.

15. Stack orange_block_1 onto brown_block_1. Now, orange_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 5 met).

This is still very long, but perhaps this is the optimal plan considering all constraints.

But perhaps there's a shorter way. Let me try to condense.

After step 10, green_block_2 is on the table. black_block_2 is on black_block_1. orange_block_1 is still under brown_block_1. To make orange_block_1 not on the table, need to move brown_block_1 and green_block_2.

But this requires additional steps. 

Alternatively, during step 2, stack green_block_1 onto orange_block_1. Then, orange_block_1 has green_block_1 on top, so not on the table. This would satisfy constraint 5.

Let's try this:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2. Hold green_block_1.

2. Stack green_block_1 onto orange_block_1. Now, orange_block_1 has green_block_1 on top. So orange_block_1 is not on the table. This satisfies constraint 5.

3. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. Hold black_block_2 (constraint 1).

4. Stack black_block_2 onto black_block_1 (constraint 6 part 1).

5. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1. Hold green_block_2.

6. Putdown green_block_2 (constraint 6 part 2).

Now, check constraints:

- Constraint 2: When holding black_block_2 (step 3), earlier state where green_block_2 not clear or holding orange_block_1. In this plan, before step 3, steps 1 and 2. In step 2, we stacked green_block_1 onto orange_block_1. So orange_block_1 is not on the table. But the arm was holding green_block_1, not orange_block_1. So no. Also, green_block_2 is clear initially, and in step 2, it's still clear. So constraint 2 is not satisfied.

So this approach fails constraint 2.

Another idea: In step 2, stack green_block_1 onto brown_block_1, making green_block_2 not clear.

But brown_block_1 is under green_block_2. So stacking green_block_1 onto brown_block_1 would require unstacking green_block_2 first.

This is getting too complicated. Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I think the optimal plan must include the necessary steps to satisfy all constraints, even if it's longer. The final answer will have to be a sequence that satisfies all constraints while achieving the goal.
