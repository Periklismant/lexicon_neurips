Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to make red_block_1 clear. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the goal.

Initial state:
- brown_block_1 is on the table with orange_block_1 on it. Then green_block_1 is on orange, and black_block_1 on green.
- white_block_1 is on the table with red_block_1 on it, and blue_block_1 on red.
- The arm is empty.

So, blue_block_1 is on top of red_block_1. To make red clear, we need to remove blue from red. The straightforward way would be to unstack blue from red and put it somewhere. But we have constraints to satisfy.

Constraints:
1. At some state, black_block_1 is not on blue. Then, either blue is clear and green is on table in that state or later.
2. Red must be on orange in some state.
3. Blue must not be on the table in some state. Then, in that state or later, blue is on orange and white is on black.
4. Red must not be on orange in some state. Then, red must be on table at that state or later.
5. Must be holding green at some point.

This is complicated. Let's break it down.

First, the main goal is to have red_block_1 clear. So, blue needs to be moved from red. Let's think about the steps:

1. Unstack blue_block_1 from red_block_1. But to do that, blue must be clear (which it is) and the arm is empty. Then, after unstacking, the arm holds blue. Then, we can put it down. But putting it down would make it on the table. However, one of the constraints is that blue is not on the table in some state, so maybe we need to stack it elsewhere.

Wait, but if we just put blue on the table, then in that state, blue is on the table, which violates the constraint that blue must not be on the table in some state. Wait, no, the constraint is that "blue is not on the table" must hold in at least one state. So blue has to be off the table in some state. So perhaps after moving blue, we need to stack it somewhere else.

But let's outline possible steps.

Original stack on white_block_1: red_block_1, then blue_block_1. So to clear red, we need to unstack blue from red. So:

Action: unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1
Effect: blue is held, red is clear. But the main goal is achieved here. But we have to check constraints.

Wait, but the main goal is that red is clear in the final state. So if we unstack blue from red and put it somewhere, that's the main goal. However, the constraints need to be satisfied throughout the plan.

But let's see. Let's first do the unstack:

1. unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1 → now holding blue, red is clear.

If we stop here, the main goal is achieved. But we need to satisfy all constraints.

But let's check the constraints:

Constraint 3: blue is not on the table in some state. If we unstack blue and then put it down on the table, then in the state after unstack, blue is not on the table (since it's being held). Then when we put it down, it's on the table. So in the state after unstack but before putdown, blue is not on the table. So that satisfies constraint 3. Then, for the implication: when blue is not on the table (during the time it's held), we need to have blue on orange and white on black in that state or later.

Wait, but after unstacking blue, we have to place it somewhere. If we stack it on orange_block_1, then blue would be on orange. But orange is under green and black. So let's see: orange_block_1 is under green and black. So green is on orange, and black is on green. So orange is not clear. So we can't stack blue on orange unless we first remove green and black from orange.

But that's a long process. Alternatively, maybe stack blue on another block. Let's see.

But the constraint says that when blue is not on the table (which happens when we unstack it and hold it), then in that state or later, blue must be on orange and white must be on black. So perhaps after moving blue, we need to place it on orange, and also move white onto black.

But how?

Let me list the constraints again:

Constraint 3: Blue must not be on the table in some state. Then, in that state or after, blue is on orange and white is on black.

Constraint 2: Red must be on orange in some state.

Constraint 4: Red must not be on orange in some state (so in some other state, red is not on orange, but then red must be on table at that state or after).

Also, must hold green_block_1 at some point.

And another constraint: black_block_1 is not on blue in some state, and then blue is clear and green is on table in that state or later.

This is complex. Let's try to find a plan that satisfies all these.

First, the main goal: red is clear. So unstack blue from red. Let's do that first.

Action 1: unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1 → holding blue, red is clear. Now the main goal is achieved. But we need to satisfy all constraints.

But we need to check if all constraints are met. Let's go through each constraint:

1. "black_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1" in some state. Initially, black is on green, which is on orange, which is on brown. Blue is on red. So in the initial state, black is not on blue. So that's already true. Wait, the initial state has black on green, so black is not on blue. So that condition is already true in the initial state. But the first constraint says that this must hold in at least one state. Since the initial state already satisfies it, perhaps that's covered. But then the implication is that if in some state s (which could be the initial state), then in s or after, blue is clear and green is on table.

But in the initial state, blue is clear (since there's nothing on top of it), and green is on orange, not on table. So the implication is that after the initial state (since s is the initial state where black is not on blue), we need to have blue clear and green on table at some point. But blue is clear in the initial state, but green is not on the table. So maybe the plan needs to ensure that after the initial state (which triggers the first constraint), at some point, green is on the table.

So in the plan, we need to move green to the table. But green is under black. So to move green, we need to unstack black from green, then unstack green from orange, then put green on the table. But this would require several steps.

But let's see. Also, the constraint says that if the first expression (black not on blue) holds in some state s, then the conditions (blue clear and green on table) must hold in s or after. The initial state is s where black is not on blue. But in s, blue is clear (since initial state has blue on red, which is clear). So the first part (blue clear) holds in s, but green is not on the table. So the implication is not satisfied unless in s or later, green is on the table. Therefore, during the plan, we need to have green on the table at some point.

So even though the main goal is achieved early by unstacking blue, we need to do more steps to put green on the table.

Additionally, we need to have red on orange in some state (constraint 2), and red not on orange in another (constraint 4), with the implication that when red is not on orange, it's on the table. Also, must hold green (constraint 7).

Moreover, blue must be not on the table in some state (constraint 3), and in that state or after, blue is on orange and white on black. Also, red must be on orange at some point (constraint 2) and not on orange at another (constraint 4), with when it's not, it's on table.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline steps.

Step 1: unstack blue_block_1 from red_block_1. Now holding blue, red is clear. Main goal achieved, but need to handle other constraints.

Now, we have to put blue somewhere. Let's consider stacking it on orange_block_1. But orange has green and black on top. So first, we need to clear orange. So steps:

To stack blue on orange, we need to unstack black, green, orange from brown. But that's a lot.

Alternatively, put blue on the table. But then constraint 3 requires that in some state, blue is not on the table. So if we put blue on the table, then in the state after unstack (when it's held), blue is not on the table. But once putdown, it's on the table. So the state where blue is not on the table is during the time it's being held. But the implication is that when blue is not on the table (during that time), then in that state or after, blue is on orange and white is on black. So during the time we're holding blue (after unstack), we need to stack it on orange and then stack white on black.

But how?

After unstacking blue, we have to stack it on orange. But orange is under green and black. So first, we need to remove green and black from orange.

So steps:

1. unstack blue from red → holding blue, red clear.

But then we need to stack blue on orange. But orange is currently under green and black. So to do that, we need to move black and green.

So:

2. putdown blue → blue is on table. Now, blue is on table. But constraint 3 requires that in some state, blue is not on the table. So maybe we need to stack it later.

But let's see. After step 1, blue is held (not on table). That state satisfies blue not on table. So according to constraint 3's implication, we need to have blue on orange and white on black in that state or after.

But during step 1, after unstack, blue is held. So in that state, we need to either have blue on orange (which would require stacking immediately, but orange is not clear) or in a later state. But since we can't stack blue on orange right away (since orange has green on top), we need to first clear orange.

So perhaps:

After step 1 (unstack blue), we need to plan to stack it on orange. To do that:

We need to unstack black from green, then unstack green from orange, put them somewhere, then stack blue on orange, then restack green and black on blue?

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Let's see.

Alternative approach: Maybe the plan has to involve moving green and black to the table, then stack blue on orange, then rebuild part of the structure. But let's proceed step by step.

Step 1: unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1 → holding blue.

Now, blue is not on the table (held), so constraint 3 is satisfied. Then, according to the implication, we need to have blue on orange and white on black in this state or later.

But in this state, blue is held, so not on orange. So we need to later stack blue on orange. Also, need to have white on black. So perhaps after stacking blue on orange, we can move white to black.

But first, to stack blue on orange, we need to clear orange. So:

Step 2: putdown blue → blue on table. Now blue is on table again. But this is after step 1, where blue was not on table (so constraint 3 is already satisfied in step 1's state). Now, to stack blue on orange, we need to clear orange, which is under green and black.

So steps:

3. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1 → holding black.

4. putdown black_block_1 → black on table.

5. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1 → holding green.

6. putdown green_block_1 → green on table.

Now, orange_block_1 is clear. So step 7: stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1 (blue was on table, need to pick it up first).

Wait, after step 2, blue is on table. So to stack blue on orange:

7. pickup blue_block_1.

8. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1.

Now, blue is on orange. Then, to satisfy the implication from constraint 3, we need white on black. White is currently on table (original state had white_block_1 on table with red on it, but red is still on white, because after step 1, blue was removed from red. Wait, initial state: white_block_1 is on table, red_block_1 is on white_block_1, blue on red. After step 1, blue is removed, red is clear. So red is on white. So white_block_1 has red on it. So to stack white on black, we need to move red first.

Wait, white_block_1 is on table with red on top. So to move white, we need to first remove red. But red is clear (after step 1). So:

Step 9: pickup red_block_1 (since it's on white and clear).

10. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1 → now red is on orange. This satisfies constraint 2 (red on orange in some state).

But wait, blue is already on orange. Oh no, because in step 8, blue is stacked on orange. So orange has blue on top. So can't stack red on orange unless we move blue. Hmm, this is getting messy.

Alternative approach: Maybe after stacking blue on orange, we need to move red to another place. But the goal is to have red clear, which is already achieved in step 1. So red is on white. So after step 1, red is on white, clear.

If we then pick up red and stack it on orange (which requires orange to be clear, but orange was cleared in step 6 (green and black moved to table). Wait, after step 6, orange is clear. Then in step 8, blue is stacked on orange. So orange is now holding blue. So to stack red on orange, we need to unstack blue first.

This is getting too complicated. Let's try to outline a possible plan that satisfies all constraints, step by step.

Main steps needed:

1. Make red clear (unstack blue from red).

2. Ensure that black is not on blue (already true initially, but the implication requires green on table and blue clear. Since initially blue is clear, but green is not on table, we need to move green to table).

3. Ensure that red is on orange in some state (stack red on orange).

4. Ensure that red is not on orange in another state (unstack red from orange and put it on table).

5. Ensure blue is not on table (just unstacking it and holding it meets this, but then must stack on orange and have white on black).

6. Hold green at some point.

Let's try to build the plan:

Step 1: unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1 → holding blue, red clear. Main goal achieved.

Now, we need to satisfy the constraints:

- blue is not on table (currently holding it, so yes). Implication: blue on orange and white on black must happen in this state or later.

So we need to stack blue on orange and stack white on black.

But to stack blue on orange, orange must be clear. Initially, orange has green and black. So first, move green and black to table.

Step 2: putdown blue_block_1 → blue on table. Now, need to clear orange.

Step 3: unstack black_block_1 green_block_1 → holding black.

Step 4: putdown black_block_1 → black on table.

Step 5: unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1 → holding green.

Step 6: putdown green_block_1 → green on table. Now orange is clear.

Now, stack blue on orange:

Step 7: pickup blue_block_1 → holding blue.

Step 8: stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1 → blue on orange, arm empty.

Now, blue is on orange. Now, to satisfy the implication from constraint 3 (blue not on table in state s (step 1), and in s or later, blue on orange and white on black). We have blue on orange. Now need to stack white on black.

But white_block_1 has red_block_1 on it. So need to move red first.

Step 9: unstack red_block_1 white_block_1 → holding red.

Step 10: putdown red_block_1 → red on table.

Now, white_block_1 is clear. Now, stack white on black.

Step 11: pickup white_block_1.

Step 12: stack white_block_1 black_block_1 → white on black.

Now, in step 8, blue is on orange, and step 12, white is on black. This satisfies the implication for constraint 3.

But we also need to satisfy constraint 2 (red on orange in some state). Currently, red is on table. So perhaps stack red on orange.

But orange has blue on top. So need to move blue.

Step 13: unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_1 → holding blue.

Step 14: putdown blue_block_1 → blue on table.

Step 15: pickup red_block_1 → holding red.

Step 16: stack red_block_1 orange_block_1 → red on orange.

This satisfies constraint 2. Then, to satisfy constraint 4 (red not on orange in some state), we need to unstack red from orange and put it on table.

Step 17: unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1 → holding red.

Step 18: putdown red_block_1 → red on table.

Now, red is on table, satisfying the implication for constraint 4.

Also, we need to hold green_block_1 at some point. We did that in step 5 (unstack green from orange and putdown). So step 5 is where we held green.

So far, the steps are:

1. unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1

2. putdown blue_block_1

3. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1

4. putdown black_block_1

5. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1

6. putdown green_block_1

7. pickup blue_block_1

8. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1

9. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1

10. putdown red_block_1

11. pickup white_block_1

12. stack white_block_1 black_block_1

13. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_1

14. putdown blue_block_1

15. pickup red_block_1

16. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1

17. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1

18. putdown red_block_1

This is a lot of steps. But let's check if all constraints are met.

Check constraints:

1. "black not on blue" in some state: Initially true. Implication: in that state or later, blue clear and green on table. In step 6, green is on table. Blue is clear in step 1 (after unstack), but after step 8, blue is on orange, so not clear. So the implication is satisfied because in step 6, green is on table, and in step 1, blue is clear. So combining the two, the implication is met.

2. "red on orange" in some state: step 16.

3. "blue not on table" in some state: step 1 (holding blue). Implication: in that state or later, blue on orange and white on black. Step 8 (blue on orange) and step 12 (white on black), so yes.

4. "red not on orange" in some state: step 18 (red on table). Implication: red on table at that state.

5. "hold green" in some state: step 5.

Also, main goal: red is clear (step 1, and after step 10, red is on table, so clear. But after step 16, red is on orange, so not clear. But the final goal is the final state. So wait, the final state after all steps would be:

- brown_block_1 on table.

- orange_block_1 has blue (step 14: blue is putdown, so on table. Wait, step 13: unstack blue from orange (step 13), putdown (step14). So blue is on table. Then step 15: pickup red (from table?), stack on orange (step 16). Then unstack (step17) and putdown (step18). So final state:

- blue is on table.

- orange is clear.

- red is on table.

- white is on black, which is on table.

- green is on table.

- black is on table.

Wait, but the main goal is that red is clear in the final state. In step 18, red is on table, which is clear. So the final state satisfies the main goal.

But during the steps, after step 1, red is clear (on white). Then in step9, we unstack red from white, so red is held, then putdown (step10), then stacked on orange (step16), then unstacked (step17) and putdown (step18). So the final state has red on table, clear.

So main goal is achieved.

Now, the constraints are satisfied.

But this seems like a long plan. Is there a shorter way?

Wait, maybe there's a more optimal path. Let's think again.

Alternative approach: After unstacking blue from red (step1), instead of putting it down, can we use it to satisfy the blue not on table constraint and then stack it on orange directly?

But to stack on orange, we need to clear orange first. So steps:

1. unstack blue from red → holding blue.

2. unstack black from green → holding black.

3. putdown black.

4. unstack green from orange → holding green.

5. putdown green.

6. stack blue on orange → now blue is on orange.

7. Then stack white on black.

But to stack white on black, need to move red from white:

8. unstack red from white → holding red.

9. putdown red.

10. stack white on black.

This way, after step1, blue is not on table (held), so constraint3 is met. Then step6 stacks blue on orange, step10 stacks white on black. So implications are met.

Then, to get red on orange (constraint2):

11. pickup red.

12. stack red on orange (but orange has blue, so need to unstack blue first).

Hmm, this complicates.

Alternatively, after step6 (blue on orange), stack red on blue:

13. pickup red.

14. stack red on blue. Now red is on blue, which is on orange. This satisfies constraint2 (red is on orange? No, red is on blue, which is on orange. But the problem says "on top of", which is direct. So red is on blue, not on orange. So that doesn't satisfy constraint2.

So need to have red directly on orange.

But orange has blue. So need to move blue first.

Alternatively, after step6, unstack blue from orange, then stack red on orange.

But this adds steps.

Alternatively, maybe after stacking blue on orange, then move blue again.

But this is getting complex.

Alternatively, after step1 (unstack blue), instead of putting it down, proceed to clear orange by moving black and green.

But requires more steps.

Alternatively, think of the minimal steps needed.

Wait, the main goal is to make red clear. The constraints require several things, but perhaps some can be satisfied in the process without too many steps.

For example, after unstacking blue from red (step1), the main goal is achieved. But we need to satisfy other constraints.

Constraint7: must hold green. So we need to pick up green at some point.

Constraint3: blue not on table (step1 is that state). So need to stack blue on orange and white on black.

Constraint2: red on orange in some state.

Constraint4: red not on orange in another state, and then red is on table.

So perhaps:

Plan:

1. unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1 → holding blue. Red is clear. Main goal achieved.

Now, need to satisfy:

- blue on orange and white on black (for constraint3).

- red on orange (constraint2).

- red not on orange (constraint4), then red on table.

- hold green (step needed).

Let's try:

Step2: stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1 → but orange is not clear (has green and black). So can't. So need to clear orange.

Step2: putdown blue_block_1 → blue on table.

Step3: unstack black_block_1 green_block_1 → holding black.

Step4: putdown black_block_1 → black on table.

Step5: unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1 → holding green. This satisfies constraint7 (holding green).

Step6: stack green_block_1 black_block_1 → green on black. Now, black is on table. So green is on black, which is on table.

Step7: stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1 → blue on orange.

Now, to satisfy constraint3's implication: blue on orange (done) and white on black.

White is on table with red on it. To stack white on black:

Step8: unstack red_block_1 white_block_1 → holding red.

Step9: putdown red_block_1 → red on table.

Step10: stack white_block_1 black_block_1 → white on black.

Now, constraint3's implication is satisfied.

Constraint2: red on orange. So need to stack red on orange.

Step11: pickup red_block_1.

Step12: stack red_block_1 orange_block_1 → but orange has blue. So need to unstack blue first.

Step12: unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_1 → holding blue.

Step13: stack red_block_1 orange_block_1 → red on orange.

This satisfies constraint2.

Constraint4: red not on orange in some state. After step13, red is on orange. Then we need to unstack it.

Step14: unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1 → holding red.

Step15: putdown red_block_1 → red on table. This satisfies constraint4's implication (red on table).

So the plan steps are:

1. unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1

2. putdown blue_block_1

3. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1

4. putdown black_block_1

5. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1

6. stack green_block_1 black_block_1

7. pickup blue_block_1

8. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1

9. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1

10. putdown red_block_1

11. stack white_block_1 black_block_1

12. pickup red_block_1

13. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_1

14. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1

15. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1

16. putdown red_block_1

This plan has 16 steps. Is there a shorter way?

Wait, after step6, green is on black. Step7 is picking up blue (which was putdown in step2) and stacking on orange (step8). Then step9 unstack red from white, putdown, then stack white on black. Then steps 12-16 involve moving red to orange and back.

But perhaps there's a way to optimize.

Alternative Idea:

After step1 (unstack blue), we need to stack blue on orange and white on black. Also, need to have red on orange and then off.

But maybe after step1, instead of putting blue down, we proceed to clear orange by moving black and green.

But this would require:

Step1: unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1 → holding blue.

Step2: unstack black_block_1 green_block_1 → holding black. (But arm is holding blue, so can't do this. Need to put down blue first.)

Ah, right, the arm can only hold one block. So after step1, holding blue. To unstack black from green, need to put blue down.

So steps:

1. unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1 → holding blue.

2. putdown blue_block_1 → blue on table.

3. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1 → holding black.

4. putdown black_block_1 → black on table.

5. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1 → holding green.

6. stack green_block_1 black_block_1 → green on black.

7. pickup blue_block_1 → holding blue.

8. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1 → blue on orange.

9. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1 → holding red.

10. stack red_block_1 green_block_1 → red on green. This way, red is on green, which is on black. But this doesn't satisfy constraint2 (red on orange). So step10 should stack red on orange.

Wait, but orange has blue. So need to unstack blue first.

Hmm. This is tricky.

Alternatively, after step8 (blue on orange), to stack red on orange, need to unstack blue.

So:

9. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_1 → holding blue.

10. putdown blue_block_1 → blue on table.

11. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1 → holding red.

12. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1 → red on orange (satisfies constraint2).

13. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1 → holding red (satisfies constraint4 when putdown).

14. putdown red_block_1 → red on table.

Also, need to stack white on black. After step11, white is clear (since red was unstacked). So step15: stack white_block_1 black_block_1.

So steps:

1. unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1

2. putdown blue_block_1

3. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1

4. putdown black_block_1

5. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1

6. stack green_block_1 black_block_1

7. pickup blue_block_1

8. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1

9. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_1

10. putdown blue_block_1

11. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1

12. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1

13. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1

14. putdown red_block_1

15. stack white_block_1 black_block_1

This is 15 steps. But let's check if all constraints are met.

Constraint2: red on orange in step12.

Constraint4: red not on orange in step14.

Constraint3: blue not on table in step1 (held), and then blue is stacked on orange (step8), so implication requires white on black. White is stacked on black in step15.

Constraint7: holding green in step5.

Also, constraint1: black not on blue in initial state. Implication: green on table. In step6, green is stacked on black, not on table. Wait, this is a problem.

Wait, the implication for constraint1 is that if black is not on blue in state s (which is the initial state), then in s or later, blue is clear and green is on table.

In the initial state, blue is clear (on red, but red is on white). After step1, blue is held (not clear). Then step2, blue is on table, clear.

But the implication requires green on table. In step5, green is unstacked from orange and held, then stacked on black in step6. So green is not on table. So this violates the implication.

Ah, this is a mistake. So the implication for constraint1 (when black is not on blue in s, which is true in initial state) requires that in s or later, blue is clear and green is on table. But in the initial state, blue is clear (yes), but green is not on table. So the implication is not met unless green is on table at some point after the initial state.

So in the plan, green must be put on the table. But in the previous plan, green is stacked on black (step6), so never on the table. This violates the implication.

So the previous plan is invalid. We need to adjust it.

So to satisfy the implication for constraint1, after the initial state (which triggers the condition), we need to have green on the table at some point.

So in the plan, after step5 (unstack green from orange), we need to put green on the table, not stack it on black.

Adjusting steps:

1. unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1

2. putdown blue_block_1

3. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1

4. putdown black_block_1

5. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1

6. putdown green_block_1 → green on table.

7. pickup blue_block_1

8. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1

9. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1

10. putdown red_block_1

11. stack white_block_1 black_block_1

12. pickup red_block_1

13. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1

14. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1

15. putdown red_block_1

Now, in step6, green is on table. So the implication for constraint1 is satisfied (blue is clear in initial state and after step2, blue is on table and clear). But after step6, green is on table. So in the state after step6, green is on table. Thus, the implication holds.

Constraint2: red is stacked on orange in step13.

Constraint4: red is putdown in step15, so not on orange.

Constraint3: blue is not on table in step1 (held), and later stacked on orange (step8), and white on black (step11).

Constraint7: green is held in step5.

This plan has 15 steps. Is this the minimal?

But perhaps we can optimize further.

Wait, after step1 (unstack blue from red), red is clear. The main goal is achieved. But we have to process other constraints.

Alternative plan:

1. unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1 → holding blue. Now, blue not on table (in step1's state). Implication: blue on orange and white on black.

2. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1 → but arm is holding blue, so can't. So must put down blue first.

So step2: putdown blue_block_1 → blue on table.

3. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1 → holding black.

4. putdown black_block_1 → black on table.

5. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1 → holding green.

6. putdown green_block_1 → green on table. Now, constraint1's implication is met (green on table).

7. pickup blue_block_1 → holding blue.

8. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1 → blue on orange. Now, to fulfill implication from step1's state, need white on black.

9. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1 → holding red.

10. putdown red_block_1 → red on table.

11. stack white_block_1 black_block_1 → white on black.

Now, constraint3's implication is met.

Constraint2: red on orange.

12. pickup red_block_1.

13. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1 → but orange has blue. Need to unstack blue first.

14. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_1 → holding blue.

15. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1 → red on orange.

Constraint4: red not on orange.

16. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1 → holding red.

17. putdown red_block_1 → red on table.

Constraint7: green was held in step5.

This gives 17 steps. Not better.

But let's see if there's a way to avoid stacking and unstacking red multiple times.

Alternative idea: After step1 (unstack blue), putdown blue, then work on moving green and black to table. Then stack blue on orange, then move white to black.

Then, to satisfy red on orange, stack red on blue (which is on orange), but this makes red on blue, not directly on orange. So that doesn't satisfy constraint2.

So we need to have red directly on orange. Which requires moving blue.

Alternatively, after stacking blue on orange, unstack blue, stack red on orange, then put blue back.

But this adds steps.

It seems challenging to find a shorter plan. Given the constraints, perhaps the initial longer plan is necessary.

But perhaps the optimal plan can be shorter by combining some steps.

Wait, after unstacking blue (step1), instead of putting it down, could we move black and green while holding blue? No, because the arm can only hold one block. So must put down blue first.

So, the minimal steps required are likely around 15 steps.

But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Let me think again:

Initial state:

Towers:

- brown_block_1: orange_block_1 (green_block_1 (black_block_1))

- white_block_1: red_block_1 (blue_block_1)

Goal: red_block_1 clear.

Constraints:

Must have:

- black not on blue (initially true).

- red on orange in some state.

- blue not on table in some state, then blue on orange and white on black.

- red not on orange in some state, then red on table.

- hold green.

So, perhaps:

Plan:

1. unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1 → blue in hand, red clear.

2. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1 → but arm is holding blue; can't. So put down blue first.

2. putdown blue_block_1 → blue on table.

3. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1 → holding black.

4. putdown black_block_1 → black on table.

5. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1 → holding green.

6. putdown green_block_1 → green on table. Now, constraint1's implication is met (green on table).

7. pickup blue_block_1 → holding blue.

8. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1 → blue on orange.

9. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1 → holding red.

10. stack red_block_1 blue_block_1 → red on blue (on orange). This satisfies constraint2 (red is on orange via blue? No, red is on blue, which is on orange. But "on top of" is direct. So red is on blue, not on orange. So this doesn't satisfy constraint2. So need to stack red directly on orange.

But orange has blue. So need to unstack blue first.

11. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_1 → holding blue.

12. putdown blue_block_1 → blue on table.

13. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1 → red on orange. This satisfies constraint2.

14. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1 → holding red. Now, red not on orange (constraint4).

15. putdown red_block_1 → red on table.

16. stack white_block_1 black_block_1 → white on black (satisfies constraint3's implication).

This is 16 steps. But also, need to hold green (step5).

But this satisfies all constraints:

- constraint1: black not on blue in initial state. Implication: blue clear and green on table. In step6, green on table. Blue clear in step2 (putdown), and in step7, picked up again.

- constraint3: blue not on table in step1 (held). Implication: blue on orange and white on black (step8 and step16).

- constraint2: red on orange in step13.

- constraint4: red not on orange in step14 and putdown in step15.

- constraint7: held green in step5.

But this plan has 16 steps. Is there a way to reduce this?

For example, after step13, red is on orange. To satisfy constraint4, we need to unstack it. But maybe instead of unstacking, can we move it another way?

Alternatively, after step13 (red on orange), we can stack another block on red. But that's not required.

Hmm.

Alternatively, after step13, we can leave red on orange, but that would violate constraint4. So we must unstack it.

Another idea: after step8 (blue on orange), stack white on black. To do that, need to move red from white.

But white has red. So:

9. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1 → holding red.

10. putdown red_block_1 → red on table.

11. stack white_block_1 black_block_1 → white on black. Now, implication for constraint3 is met.

12. pickup red_block_1.

13. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1 → but orange has blue. So unstack blue first.

14. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_1 → holding blue.

15. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1 → red on orange.

16. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1 → holding red.

17. putdown red_block_1.

This gives 17 steps. Not better.

It seems challenging to find a shorter plan. The constraints require multiple specific states, so the plan must include actions to achieve each.

The initial plan I thought of has 15 steps but failed to put green on table. The corrected version has 15 steps, ensuring green is on table.

So the corrected steps:

1. unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1 → holding blue.

2. putdown blue_block_1.

3. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1.

4. putdown black_block_1.

5. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1.

6. putdown green_block_1.

7. pickup blue_block_1.

8. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1.

9. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1.

10. putdown red_block_1.

11. stack white_block_1 black_block_1.

12. pickup red_block_1.

13. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_1.

14. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1.

15. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1.

16. putdown red_block_1.

This is 16 steps, but ensures green is on table (step6), satisfying the implication for constraint1.

Additionally:

- constraint2 is met in step14.

- constraint4 in step16.

- constraint3 in steps8 and 11.

- constraint7 in step5.

This seems to satisfy all constraints. Now, the final state has red on table, clear. So main goal achieved.

But can this plan be optimized further?

For instance, after step8 (stack blue on orange), can we use the same action to stack white on black without unstacking red?

Yes:

After step8, we have blue on orange. Now, to stack white on black:

Step9: unstack red from white → holding red.

Step10: putdown red.

Step11: stack white on black.

Then, to satisfy constraint2:

Step12: pickup red.

Step13: stack red on orange → but orange has blue. So need to unstack blue first.

Step14: unstack blue from orange → holding blue.

Step15: stack red on orange.

Step16: unstack red → holding red.

Step17: putdown red.

This is 17 steps. Not better.

Alternatively, after step8, can we stack red on blue (on orange) for constraint2? But as mentioned earlier, red on blue is not directly on orange.

Thus, this approach doesn't satisfy constraint2.

Another Idea: After step6, green is on table. Then, stack green on blue after stacking blue on orange. But this may not help.

Alternatively, after step8 (blue on orange), stack green on blue:

Step9: pickup green_block_1.

Step10: stack green_block_1 blue_block_1 → green on blue.

But then, to satisfy constraint2, red must be on orange. So red can be stacked on green (which is on blue on orange). But this is not directly on orange. So no.

So, no luck.

Given all this, the 16-step plan seems necessary.
