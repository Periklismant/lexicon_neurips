Let's break down this Blocksworld problem.

I'm given:
- Objects: 7 blocks (brown_block_1, white_block_1, orange_block_1, red_block_1, blue_block_1, green_block_1, black_block_1)
- Initial state:
  * brown_block_1 is on the table
  * white_block_1 is on the table
  * orange_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
  * red_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
  * blue_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
  * green_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
  * black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
  * blue_block_1 is clear
  * black_block_1 is clear
  * you are not holding any block

- Goal: red_block_1 is clear

Let's visualize the initial state:
```
    blue_block_1       black_block_1
         |                  |
    red_block_1        green_block_1
         |                  |
   white_block_1      orange_block_1
                           |
                     brown_block_1
         -------------TABLE-------------
```

And our goal is to have red_block_1 clear. 

Given the constraints I also need to:
1. Have a state where black_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1 (this is already true in the initial state)
2. If black_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1 (which is true in the initial state), then I need to ensure that blue_block_1 is clear (true in the initial state) and green_block_1 is on the table (this is false in the initial state, so I'll need to put green_block_1 on the table).
3. Have a state where red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
4. Have a state where blue_block_1 is not on the table (true in the initial state)
5. If blue_block_1 is not on the table (true in the initial state), then I need to ensure that blue_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 and white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1.
6. Have a state where red_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1 (true in the initial state)
7. If red_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1 (true in the initial state), then I need to ensure that red_block_1 is on the table.
8. Have a state where I am holding green_block_1

Let's plan step by step:

Initially, the blue_block_1 is clear and black_block_1 is clear.

From the constraints, I need to achieve:
- green_block_1 on the table (as per constraint 2, because black_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1 in the initial state)
- red_block_1 on top of orange_block_1 (constraint 3)
- blue_block_1 on top of orange_block_1 and white_block_1 on top of black_block_1 (as per constraint 5, because blue_block_1 is not on the table in the initial state)
- red_block_1 on the table (as per constraint 7, because red_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1 in the initial state)
- hold green_block_1 at some point (constraint 8)

And the final goal is to have red_block_1 be clear.

Let's create a plan:

1. First, let's achieve "you are holding green_block_1" (constraint 8)
   To achieve this, I need to unstack black_block_1 from green_block_1, then unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_1.
   
   - unstack black_block_1 green_block_1
   - putdown black_block_1
   - unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1

2. Now, I'm holding green_block_1 (satisfying constraint 8). Next, let's put green_block_1 on the table (for constraint 2)
   
   - putdown green_block_1

3. I need to achieve "red_block_1 on top of orange_block_1" (constraint 3).
   Since red_block_1 is under blue_block_1, I need to first unstack blue_block_1.

   - unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1
   - putdown blue_block_1

4. Now, unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1
   
   - unstack red_block_1 white_block_1

5. Now, I'm holding red_block_1. I need to stack it on orange_block_1.
   
   - stack red_block_1 orange_block_1

This satisfies constraint 3.

6. Now, I need to ensure "blue_block_1 on top of orange_block_1 and white_block_1 on top of black_block_1" (constraint 5).
   I currently have:
   ```
        red_block_1                
             |                  
       orange_block_1      
             |                  
      brown_block_1      
         -------------TABLE-------------
   ```
   Also, white_block_1, black_block_1, green_block_1, and blue_block_1 are on the table.
   
   Let's start by putting white_block_1 on top of black_block_1.
   
   - pickup white_block_1
   - stack white_block_1 black_block_1

7. Now, let's put blue_block_1 on top of orange_block_1. However, red_block_1 is already on top of orange_block_1. So I'll need to move red_block_1 first.
   
   - unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1
   - putdown red_block_1

Now, red_block_1 is on the table, satisfying constraint 7.

8. Then I can put blue_block_1 on top of orange_block_1.
   
   - pickup blue_block_1
   - stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1

This satisfies constraint 5.

Let's check if my goal and all constraints are met:

1. Goal: red_block_1 is clear. Since I just put red_block_1 on the table (step 7) and haven't put anything on top of it, it is clear.

2. Constraints:
   - "black_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1" (constraint 1): Met initially, and hasn't changed.
   - "If black_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1, then blue_block_1 is clear and green_block_1 is on the table" (constraint 2): I put green_block_1 on the table, but blue_block_1 is now on top of orange_block_1 and not clear. I need to fix this.
   - "red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1" (constraint 3): I achieved this in step 5, but then moved red_block_1 in step 7. I may need to reconsider the order.
   - "blue_block_1 is not on the table" (constraint 4): Met in steps 3 and 8.
   - "If blue_block_1 is not on the table, then blue_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 and white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" (constraint 5): Met in steps 6 and 8.
   - "red_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1" (constraint 6): Initially true, then not true in step 5, then true again in step 7.
   - "If red_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1, then red_block_1 is on the table" (constraint 7): Met in step 7.
   - "You are holding green_block_1" (constraint 8): Met in step 1.

Ok, I need to rethink the ordering to ensure that blue_block_1 is clear and all constraints are met.

Let's retry:

1. First, let's achieve "you are holding green_block_1" (constraint 8)
   
   - unstack black_block_1 green_block_1
   - putdown black_block_1
   - unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
   - putdown green_block_1

2. I need to achieve "red_block_1 on top of orange_block_1" (constraint 3).
   
   - unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1
   - putdown blue_block_1
   - unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
   - stack red_block_1 orange_block_1

This satisfies constraint 3.

3. Then, let's make sure "blue_block_1 is not on the table" (constraint 4) and "blue_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 and white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" (constraint 5).
   
   - pickup blue_block_1
   - stack blue_block_1 red_block_1
   - pickup white_block_1
   - stack white_block_1 black_block_1

This satisfies constraints 4 and 5.

4. I still need to ensure "red_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1" (constraint 6) and "If red_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1, then red_block_1 is on the table" (constraint 7). But red_block_1 is already on top of orange_block_1, and I've also stacked blue_block_1 on top of red_block_1. This seems contradictory.

Actually, the constraints say: "If red_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1, then red_block_1 is on the table." This means that IF at any point red_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1, THEN I need to ensure (at that point or any point after that) that red_block_1 is on the table.

So, before I put red_block_1 on top of orange_block_1, I should place it on the table to satisfy constraint 7.

Let me re-plan this:

1. First, let's achieve "you are holding green_block_1" (constraint 8)
   
   - unstack black_block_1 green_block_1
   - putdown black_block_1
   - unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
   - putdown green_block_1

2. Unstack blue_block_1 and red_block_1.
   
   - unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1
   - putdown blue_block_1
   - unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
   - putdown red_block_1

This placement of red_block_1 on the table satisfies constraint 7.

3. Now, put red_block_1 on top of orange_block_1 to satisfy constraint 3.
   
   - pickup red_block_1
   - stack red_block_1 orange_block_1

4. Stack blue_block_1 on top of red_block_1 (this will make blue_block_1 not on the table, satisfying constraint 4) and white_block_1 on top of black_block_1 (satisfying constraint 5).
   
   - pickup blue_block_1
   - stack blue_block_1 red_block_1
   - pickup white_block_1
   - stack white_block_1 black_block_1

5. For constraint 2, blue_block_1 should be clear (it is), and green_block_1 should be on the table (we did this earlier).

But wait, the final goal is to have red_block_1 be clear, and now it has blue_block_1 on top of it. I need to adjust.

I need to move blue_block_1 off of red_block_1 to ensure red_block_1 is clear.

- unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1
- putdown blue_block_1

Wait, let me think about constraint 5 again: "If blue_block_1 is not on the table, then blue_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 and white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1."

This means I need to have a state where blue_block_1 is not on the table. If I have such a state, then I also need to ensure that blue_block_1 is on orange_block_1 AND white_block_1 is on black_block_1.

I initially stacked blue_block_1 on top of red_block_1 (which was on top of orange_block_1), but that doesn't satisfy the constraint. Instead, I need to put blue_block_1 directly on top of orange_block_1.

Let's revise the plan:

1. First, let's achieve "you are holding green_block_1" (constraint 8)
   
   - unstack black_block_1 green_block_1
   - putdown black_block_1
   - unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
   - putdown green_block_1

2. Unstack blue_block_1 and red_block_1.
   
   - unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1
   - putdown blue_block_1
   - unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
   - putdown red_block_1

This placement of red_block_1 on the table satisfies constraint 7.

3. Setup for constraint 5: we want blue_block_1 on top of orange_block_1 and white_block_1 on top of black_block_1.
   
   - pickup blue_block_1
   - stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1
   - pickup white_block_1
   - stack white_block_1 black_block_1

This satisfies constraints 4 and 5.

4. Now, to satisfy constraint 3, red_block_1 needs to be on top of orange_block_1. But blue_block_1 is already there. So, I need to move blue_block_1 off of orange_block_1.
   
   - unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_1
   - putdown blue_block_1
   - pickup red_block_1
   - stack red_block_1 orange_block_1

This satisfies constraint 3.

5. The goal is to have red_block_1 be clear, and it is (if we don't move anything else on top of it).

Actually, let me review the constraints again to ensure I've covered everything:

1. ✓ There's a state where black_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1 (this is already true in the initial state)
2. ✓ If black_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1, then blue_block_1 is clear and green_block_1 is on the table (We've placed green_block_1 on the table, but blue_block_1 might not be clear. I'll need to fix this.)
3. ✓ There's a state where red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 (step 4 above)
4. ✓ There's a state where blue_block_1 is not on the table (step 3 above)
5. ✓ If blue_block_1 is not on the table, then blue_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 and white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1 (step 3 above)
6. ✓ There's a state where red_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1 (initial state and step 2 above)
7. ✓ If red_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1, then red_block_1 is on the table (step 2 above)
8. ✓ There's a state where I am holding green_block_1 (step 1 above)

Wait, I'm still concerned about constraint 2. We need blue_block_1 to be clear, but I've placed red_block_1 on top of orange_block_1 and blue_block_1 is on the table. This doesn't contradict the constraint, because the constraint says:

"If black_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1, then blue_block_1 is clear and green_block_1 is on the table."

Let's think of it in terms of logical implication: A → B means if A, then B. If A is true, then B must be true. If A is false, then B can be either true or false.

In our context, A is "black_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1." This is true in our current state. Therefore, B, which is "blue_block_1 is clear and green_block_1 is on the table," must also be true. So, blue_block_1 must indeed be clear, and green_block_1 must be on the table.

Let's go back to my plan. I need to ensure blue_block_1 is clear, and green_block_1 is on the table.

Let me revise once more:

1. First, let's achieve "you are holding green_block_1" (constraint 8)
   
   - unstack black_block_1 green_block_1
   - putdown black_block_1
   - unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
   - putdown green_block_1

This also ensures green_block_1 is on the table, which is needed for constraint 2.

2. Unstack blue_block_1 and red_block_1.
   
   - unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1
   - putdown blue_block_1
   - unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
   - putdown red_block_1

This placement of red_block_1 on the table satisfies constraint 7.

3. Setup for constraint 5: we need "blue_block_1 on top of orange_block_1 and white_block_1 on top of black_block_1."
   
   - pickup white_block_1
   - stack white_block_1 black_block_1
   - pickup blue_block_1
   - stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1

This satisfies constraints 4 and 5.

4. Now, to satisfy constraint 3, red_block_1 needs to be on top of orange_block_1. But blue_block_1 is already there. So, I need to move blue_block_1 off of orange_block_1.
   
   - unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_1
   - putdown blue_block_1
   - pickup red_block_1
   - stack red_block_1 orange_block_1

This satisfies constraint 3.

5. The goal is to have red_block_1 be clear, and it is currently (since we stacked it on top of orange_block_1 and haven't moved anything on top of it).

Hmm, but I've left blue_block_1 on the table, which means it's not clear. I need to ensure it's clear for constraint 2.

Let me try again:

1. First, let's achieve "you are holding green_block_1" (constraint 8)
   
   - unstack black_block_1 green_block_1
   - putdown black_block_1
   - unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
   - putdown green_block_1

This also ensures green_block_1 is on the table, which is needed for constraint 2.

2. Unstack blue_block_1 and red_block_1.
   
   - unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1
   - putdown blue_block_1
   - unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
   - putdown red_block_1

This placement of red_block_1 on the table satisfies constraint 7.

3. For constraint 5, I need to ensure "blue_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 and white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1." I'll do this:
   
   - pickup white_block_1
   - stack white_block_1 black_block_1
   - pickup blue_block_1
   - stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1

This satisfies constraints 4 and 5.

4. For constraint 3, red_block_1 needs to be on top of orange_block_1. I already achieved this by stacking red_block_1 on orange_block_1 in step 4. But I realize now that this will require moving blue_block_1 off of orange_block_1, which means it's not clear. I need to reconsider.

The issue I'm grappling with is that:

- Constraint 3: red_block_1 should be on top of orange_block_1 at some point.
- Constraint 5: If blue_block_1 is not on the table, then blue_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 and white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1.
- Constraint 2: If black_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1, then blue_block_1 is clear and green_block_1 is on the table.

I need to order my steps carefully.

Let's revise:

1. First, let's achieve "you are holding green_block_1" (constraint 8)
   
   - unstack black_block_1 green_block_1
   - putdown black_block_1
   - unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
   - putdown green_block_1

This also ensures green_block_1 is on the table, which is needed for constraint 2.

2. Unstack blue_block_1 and red_block_1.
   
   - unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1
   - putdown blue_block_1
   - unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
   - putdown red_block_1

3. For constraint 3, I'll pick up red_block_1 and stack it on orange_block_1.
   
   - pickup red_block_1
   - stack red_block_1 orange_block_1

This satisfies constraint 3.

4. To satisfy constraint 2, I need to ensure blue_block_1 is clear. It's currently on the table, and nothing is on top of it, so it's clear. But I also need to satisfy constraint 5, where blue_block_1 should be on top of orange_block_1.

Wait, I can't have both at the same time: blue_block_1 can't be both clear and on top of orange_block_1 (because red_block_1 is already on top of orange_block_1). Let's think about the constraints more carefully.

Constraint 2 says: "If black_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1, then blue_block_1 is clear and green_block_1 is on the table."
Constraint 5 says: "If blue_block_1 is not on the table, then blue_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 and white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1."

For constraint 2, the condition is already true from the start. Black_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1. This means I need to ensure blue_block_1 is clear and green_block_1 is on the table immediately.

For constraint 5, I need a state where blue_block_1 is not on the table. I can choose when this happens. And when I choose to have blue_block_1 not on the table, I also need to ensure it's on top of orange_block_1 and white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1.

Given these considerations, I need to ensure:

- blue_block_1 is clear
- green_block_1 is on the table
- I need a state with red_block_1 on top of orange_block_1
- I need a state with blue_block_1 not on the table, where blue_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 and white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1

Given the strict constraint of having blue_block_1 clear (constraint 2), it seems I can't have blue_block_1 on top of anything (which is required for constraint 5) unless I move it back later and ensure it's clear and green_block_1 is on the table.

Let's try to sequence it this way:

1. First, unstack all blocks to get to a clean state.
   
   - unstack black_block_1 green_block_1
   - putdown black_block_1
   - unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
   - putdown green_block_1 (this ensures green_block_1 is on the table for constraint 2)
   - unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1
   - putdown blue_block_1 (blue_block_1 is now clear for constraint 2)
   - unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
   - putdown red_block_1 (this satisfies constraint 7)

2. For constraint 5, I'll stack blue_block_1 on top of orange_block_1 and white_block_1 on top of black_block_1.
   
   - pickup white_block_1
   - stack white_block_1 black_block_1
   - pickup blue_block_1
   - stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1

3. For constraint 3, I'll pick up red_block_1 and stack it on top of blue_block_1 (which is on top of orange_block_1).
   
   - pickup red_block_1
   - stack red_block_1 blue_block_1

4. I also want to move blue_block_1 back to the table and red_block_1 on top of orange_block_1:
   
   - unstack red_block_1 blue_block_1
   - putdown red_block_1
   - unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_1
   - putdown blue_block_1
   - pickup red_block_1
   - stack red_block_1 orange_block_1

Ok wait, let's just simplify this. Since my goal is to have red_block_1 be clear, and I've already satisfied all the constraints from steps 1-4, I can just move red_block_1 back to the table (ensuring constraint 6 and 7 are satisfied again).

Let me revise one more time:

1. First, let's achieve "you are holding green_block_1" (constraint 8) and ensure green_block_1 is on the table (part of constraint 2).
   
   - unstack black_block_1 green_block_1
   - putdown black_block_1
   - unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
   - putdown green_block_1

2. Unstack blue_block_1 and red_block_1, ensuring blue_block_1 is clear (part of constraint 2) and red_block_1 is on the table (constraint 7, because red_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1 in the initial state).
   
   - unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1
   - putdown blue_block_1
   - unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
   - putdown red_block_1

3. For constraint 5, stack white_block_1 on top of black_block_1 and blue_block_1 on top of orange_block_1.
   
   - pickup white_block_1
   - stack white_block_1 black_block_1
   - pickup blue_block_1
   - stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1

4. For constraint 3, unstack blue_block_1 from orange_block_1 and stack red_block_1 on top of orange_block_1.
   
   - unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_1
   - putdown blue_block_1
   - pickup red_block_1
   - stack red_block_1 orange_block_1

5. My goal is to have red_block_1 be clear, and it currently is. But I should also place blue_block_1 back on the table to ensure constraint 2 (blue_block_1 is clear) is satisfied.

Actually, blue_block_1 is already on the table from step 4, and since nothing is on top of it, it's clear. So, I don't need to do anything else to achieve constraint 2.

Let's check all constraints:

1. ✓ There's a state where black_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1 (this is true throughout the plan)
2. ✓ If black_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1, then blue_block_1 is clear and green_block_1 is on the table (true at the end of the plan: blue_block_1 is on the table and clear, and green_block_1 is on the table)
3. ✓ There's a state where red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 (step 4 above)
4. ✓ There's a state where blue_block_1 is not on the table (step 3 above)
5. ✓ If blue_block_1 is not on the table, then blue_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 and white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1 (satisfied in step 3)
6. ✓ There's a state where red_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1 (initial state and step 2 above)
7. ✓ If red_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1, then red_block_1 is on the table (satisfied in step 2)
8. ✓ There's a state where I am holding green_block_1 (step 1 above)

This all seems good. My final state has red_block_1 on top of orange_block_1, and nothing is on top of red_block_1, so it's clear (achieving the goal).

Let me summarize the final plan:

1. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1
2. putdown black_block_1
3. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
4. putdown green_block_1
5. unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1
6. putdown blue_block_1
7. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
8. putdown red_block_1
9. pickup white_block_1
10. stack white_block_1 black_block_1
11. pickup blue_block_1
12. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1
13. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_1
14. putdown blue_block_1
15. pickup red_block_1
16. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1

This plan:
- Achieves the goal of having red_block_1 be clear.
- Satisfies all the constraints as detailed above.

One moment, let me double-check this.

I think I missed one thing. The constraint says: "If red_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1, then red_block_1 is on the table." I need to ensure this condition is met whenever red_block_1 is not on orange_block_1.

In the initial state, red_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1, and it's also not on the table. So, I immediately need to place red_block_1 on the table.

Also, in steps 3 and 4, when blue_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1, red_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1, so it should be on the table.

I think I might have been overthinking this. Let's approach it more systematically.

First, I will make sure red_block_1 is on the table (since it's not on top of orange_block_1 in the initial state, it should immediately go to the table due to constraint 7).

1. unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1
2. putdown blue_block_1
3. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
4. putdown red_block_1 (Now red_block_1 is on the table, satisfying constraint 7)

Next, I'll achieve "you are holding green_block_1" (constraint 8) and ensure green_block_1 is on the table (part of constraint 2):

5. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1
6. putdown black_block_1
7. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
8. putdown green_block_1 (Now green_block_1 is on the table, and I've held it, satisfying constraint 8 and part of constraint 2)

For constraint 5, I'll stack white_block_1 on top of black_block_1 and blue_block_1 on top of orange_block_1:

9. pickup white_block_1
10. stack white_block_1 black_block_1
11. pickup blue_block_1
12. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1 (This satisfies constraint 5)

For constraint 3, I need to have red_block_1 on top of orange_block_1. But blue_block_1 is already there, so I need to move it:

13. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_1
14. putdown blue_block_1
15. pickup red_block_1
16. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1 (This satisfies constraint 3)

Now, I've achieved the goal of having red_block_1 be clear (since nothing is on top of it). And, since blue_block_1 is on the table and nothing is on top of it, it's clear, satisfying the remaining part of constraint 2.

Let's check all constraints one more time to be sure:

1. ✓ There's a state where black_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1 (this is true throughout the plan)
2. ✓ If black_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1, then blue_block_1 is clear and green_block_1 is on the table (true at the end of the plan: blue_block_1 is on the table and clear, and green_block_1 is on the table)
3. ✓ There's a state where red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 (step 16 above)
4. ✓ There's a state where blue_block_1 is not on the table (step 12 above)
5. ✓ If blue_block_1 is not on the table, then blue_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 and white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1 (satisfied in steps 10-12)
6. ✓ There's a state where red_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1 (initial state and steps 1-15 above)
7. ✓ If red_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1, then red_block_1 is on the table (satisfied in step 4 and maintained until step 15)
8. ✓ There's a state where I am holding green_block_1 (step 7 above)

I believe this plan is correct and satisfies all the constraints. Let me finalize:

1. unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1
2. putdown blue_block_1
3. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
4. putdown red_block_1
5. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1
6. putdown black_block_1
7. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
8. putdown green_block_1
9. pickup white_block_1
10. stack white_block_1 black_block_1
11. pickup blue_block_1
12. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1
13. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_1
14. putdown blue_block_1
15. pickup red_block_1
16. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1

Let me check a couple of nitty details to make sure that all of the operations have their prerequisites satisfies.

Starting state:
```
    blue_block_1       black_block_1
         |                  |
    red_block_1        green_block_1
         |                  |
   white_block_1      orange_block_1
                           |
                     brown_block_1
         -------------TABLE-------------
```
1. unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1. Good, blue_block_1 is on top of red_block_1, blue_block_1 is clear, and we're not holding anything.
2. putdown blue_block_1. Good, we're holding blue_block_1.
3. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1. Good, red_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, red_block_1 is clear, and we're not holding anything.
4. putdown red_block_1. Good, we're holding red_block_1.

State after Step 4:
```

              |
         green_block_1
              |
        orange_block_1
              |
        brown_block_1
                          blue_block_1   red_block_1   white_block_1
         -------------TABLE-------------
```

5. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1. Good, black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1, black_block_1 is clear, and we're not holding anything.
6. putdown black_block_1. Good, we're holding black_block_1.
7. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1. Good, green_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1, green_block_1 is clear, and we're not holding anything.
8. putdown green_block_1. Good, we're holding green_block_1.

State after Step 8:
```
                                              orange_block_1
                                                   |
                                             brown_block_1
   blue_block_1   red_block_1   white_block_1   black_block_1   green_block_1
         -------------TABLE-------------
```

9. pickup white_block_1. Good, white_block_1 is on the table, white_block_1 is clear, and we're not holding anything.
10. stack white_block_1 black_block_1. Good, we're holding white_block_1, and black_block_1 is clear.
11. pickup blue_block_1. Good, blue_block_1 is on the table, blue_block_1 is clear, and we're not holding anything.
12. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1. Good, we're holding blue_block_1, and orange_block_1 is clear.

State after Step 12:
```
       blue_block_1       white_block_1
            |                  |
       orange_block_1     black_block_1
            |
       brown_block_1
     red_block_1   green_block_1
         -------------TABLE-------------
```

13. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_1. Good, blue_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1, blue_block_1 is clear, and we're not holding anything.
14. putdown blue_block_1. Good, we're holding blue_block_1.
15. pickup red_block_1. Good, red_block_1 is on the table, red_block_1 is clear, and we're not holding anything.
16. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1. Good, we're holding red_block_1, and orange_block_1 is clear.

Final state:
```
       red_block_1        white_block_1
            |                  |
       orange_block_1     black_block_1
            |
       brown_block_1
     blue_block_1   green_block_1
         -------------TABLE-------------
```

All good, red_block_1 is clear in the final state as required.

To ensure optimality, I also want to check if any steps can be eliminated. Let's remove steps cautiously:

Constraint 2 requires green_block_1 to be on the table and blue_block_1 to be clear.
Constraint 3 requires red_block_1 to be on top of orange_block_1 at some point.
Constraint 5 requires blue_block_1 to be on top of orange_block_1 and white_block_1 to be on top of black_block_1.
Constraint 7 requires red_block_1 to be on the table if it's not on orange_block_1.
Constraint 8 requires holding green_block_1 at some point.

Let's remove steps:

1. unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1 (needed to get red_block_1)
2. putdown blue_block_1 (needed to prepare for next action)
3. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1 (needed to get red_block_1 on the table, constraint 7)
4. putdown red_block_1 (needed for constraint 7)
5. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1 (needed to get to green_block_1)
6. putdown black_block_1 (needed to prepare for next action)
7. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1 (needed to get green_block_1 on the table, constraint 2, and to hold green_block_1, constraint 8)
8. putdown green_block_1 (needed for constraint 2)
9. pickup white_block_1 (needed for constraint 5)
10. stack white_block_1 black_block_1 (needed for constraint 5)
11. pickup blue_block_1 (needed for constraint 5)
12. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1 (needed for constraint 5)
13. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_1 (needed to achieve the goal and constraint 3)
14. putdown blue_block_1 (needed to prepare for next action and for constraint 2)
15. pickup red_block_1 (needed to achieve the goal and constraint 3)
16. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1 (needed to achieve the goal and constraint 3)

I think all steps are necessary to satisfy the constraints and achieve the goal. I've been careful in planning to minimize the number of steps.

Let me make sure there's not a more optimal ordering. I think I can more optimally satisfy constraint 5:

For constraint 5, I satisfied it by both placing white_block_1 on top of black_block_1 and blue_block_1 on top of orange_block_1. But then I had to unstack blue_block_1 again.

A more direct way might be:

1. unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1
2. putdown blue_block_1
3. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
4. putdown red_block_1
5. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1
6. putdown black_block_1
7. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
8. putdown green_block_1
9. pickup white_block_1
10. stack white_block_1 black_block_1
11. pickup blue_block_1
12. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1 (constraint 4 & 5 satisfied)
13. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_1
14. putdown blue_block_1
15. pickup red_block_1
16. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1 (constraint 3 satisfied & goal achieved)

This looks like the most efficient plan to me. All constraints are satisfied, and the goal is achieved.

Actually, I'm thinking of something: maybe the constraint of "If blue_block_1 is not on the table, then blue_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 and white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" could refer to any time when blue_block_1 is not on the table, meaning not just after we stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_1 but any time?

Let's double-check: In the original state, blue_block_1 is on top of red_block_1, not on the table. So at that state, blue_block_1 should be on top of orange_block_1 and white_block_1 should be on top of black_block_1. But it's not.

I think this means that I need to first ensure blue_block_1 is on the table (or achieve the condition of blue_block_1 on top of orange_block_1 and white_block_1 on top of black_block_1) before moving any blocks.

Actually, this seems to make an important clarification for me. The constraint reads: "If expression 'blue_block_1 is not on the table' holds in some state s, then expression 'The following conditions are all true: blue_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1, white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1' must hold at s or at some state after s."

This means that if at any point blue_block_1 is not on the table, then I need to make sure that, either at that point or at some future point, blue_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 and white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1. It doesn't say that this has to be true at any state where blue_block_1 is not on the table; only that if blue_block_1 is ever not on the table, then this condition needs to be met at some state.

Given this interpretation, my proposed plan is valid. I have a state (step 12) where blue_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 and white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, which satisfies the constraint.

Similarly, the constraint for red_block_1 reads: "If expression 'red_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'red_block_1 is on the table' must hold at s or at some state after s."

This means that if at any point red_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1, then I need to make sure that, either at that point or at some future point, red_block_1 is on the table. Again, my plan satisfies this.

Let me finalize:

1. unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1
2. putdown blue_block_1
3. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
4. putdown red_block_1
5. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1
6. putdown black_block_1
7. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
8. putdown green_block_1
9. pickup white_block_1
10. stack white_block_1 black_block_1
11. pickup blue_block_1
12. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1
13. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_1
14. putdown blue_block_1
15. pickup red_block_1
16. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1

This plan:
- Achieves the goal of having red_block_1 be clear.
- Satisfies all the constraints as discussed.
- Is optimized to the minimum number of actions needed to satisfy all constraints.
