Okay, let's see. The goal is to make sure that the red_block_1 is clear, meaning there's nothing on top of it. Looking at the initial state, red_block_1 has blue_block_1 on top of it. So I need to remove blue_block_1 from red_block_1 and place it somewhere else. But how?

First, I need to check what's on top of blue_block_1. The initial state says blue_block_1 is clear. So I can pick it up directly. Wait, but to unstack blue_block_1 from red_block_1, the preconditions are that blue_block_1 is on red_block_1, blue is clear, and the arm isn't holding anything. All those are true. So the action would be unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1. Then, after that, I need to put it down somewhere. Since after unstack, the arm is holding blue_block_1. Then, putdown blue_block_1 on the table. That should make red_block_1 clear because blue is no longer on it.

Wait, but after unstacking, when I putdown blue_block_1, red_block_1's top is removed, so red_block_1 becomes clear. That should satisfy the goal. So the plan would be:

1. unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1
2. putdown blue_block_1

But wait, is there anything else I need to consider? Let's check the preconditions for each step.

First action: unstack blue_block_1 from red_block_1. Preconditions: blue is on red, blue is clear (which it is, as per initial state), and the arm is empty. Since initially, the arm isn't holding anything, that's okay. So this action is valid. After unstacking, the arm is holding blue_block_1, red_block_1 becomes clear (since blue was removed).

Then, the next action is putdown blue_block_1. The precondition is that the arm is holding it, which it is. So putdown is allowed. After putting it down, blue is on the table and clear. The red_block_1 is already clear from the unstack action.

So the plan would be those two steps. But wait, is there any other blocks that might be on top of blue_block_1? No, because initial state says blue_block_1 is clear. So this should work. Let me verify the effects.

After unstacking blue_block_1 from red_block_1: blue is no longer on red, red becomes clear. The arm is holding blue. Then putdown blue: blue is on table, arm is empty, and blue is clear. So the goal of red_block_1 being clear is achieved. This plan is two steps long. Is there a shorter plan? Well, each action is necessary. You can't just remove blue_block_1 in one step; you have to unstack and then put down. So this should be the optimal plan.
