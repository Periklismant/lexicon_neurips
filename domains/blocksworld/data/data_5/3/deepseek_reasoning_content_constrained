Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld problem. So, the initial state is a bit complex. Let me list out all the blocks and their positions first. 

We have yellow_block_1 on the table with brown_block_2 on top of it. Then brown_block_1 is on the table, with purple_block_1 on top of it, then black_block_1, and green_block_1 on top of black. Orange_block_1 is on the table and clear. Also, all the top blocks (brown_block_2, green_block_1, orange_block_1) are clear. The goal is to have brown_block_1 on top of orange_block_1.

But there are several constraints to satisfy. Let's go through each constraint one by one.

First constraint: At some state, the robot is holding brown_block_2 and orange_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1. Wait, but the goal is brown_block_1 on orange_block_1. So that's the opposite. Hmm. So this condition requires that at some point, orange is on brown_block_1, which is not the final state. But the final state is brown_block_1 on orange. So this must happen during the plan but then be reversed? That complicates things.

Second constraint: brown_block_1 is not on the table in at least one state. Since the initial state has brown_block_1 on the table, and the goal requires moving it to orange_block_1, which is on the table. So during the plan, brown_block_1 must be moved, perhaps stacked somewhere else first, but ultimately placed on orange.

Third constraint: If brown_block_1 is not on the table in some state, then earlier there must be a state where either brown_block_2 is on the table or yellow_block_1 is clear. Initially, brown_block_2 is on yellow_block_1, and yellow_block_1 is not clear (since brown_block_2 is on it). So to make yellow_block_1 clear, we need to remove brown_block_2. Alternatively, putting brown_block_2 on the table would satisfy the condition. So perhaps moving brown_block_2 from yellow to table would satisfy this.

Fourth constraint: black_block_1 must be on the table at some state. Currently, black_block_1 is on purple_block_1, which is on brown_block_1. So to get black_block_1 to the table, we need to unstack green_block_1 from black, then unstack black from purple, then put it down.

Fifth constraint: If black_block_1 is on the table in some state, then in an earlier state, either purple_block_1 is not on brown_block_1 or the robot is holding orange_block_1. Since initially purple is on brown_block_1, to satisfy this, we need to either move purple (making it not on brown) before putting black on the table, or have the robot hold orange_block_1 before that.

Sixth constraint: At some state, brown_block_2 is on the table or yellow_block_1 is clear. Initially, yellow is not clear (has brown_block_2). So to satisfy this, either move brown_block_2 to table (making yellow clear) or leave it and have yellow clear by removing brown_block_2. Wait, if we move brown_block_2, then either it's on the table (satisfies the first part) or yellow becomes clear (second part). So moving brown_block_2 would satisfy this.

Seventh constraint: brown_block_1 must be on the table at some state. Well, initially it's on the table, so that's already satisfied. But since we have to move it to orange_block_1, which is on the table, maybe during the plan, we might pick it up and put it back down? But wait, the initial state already has brown_block_1 on the table, so the constraint is already met. But the problem says "must hold in at least one state". So maybe we can just leave it as is. But need to check if the constraints require it to be on the table again after moving. Let me check the eighth constraint.

Eighth constraint: If in state s, brown_block_1 is on the table, then in s or some state after s, there's a block on purple_block_1 (so purple is not clear) and black_block_1 is not on the table. Initially, purple is on brown_block_1, so purple has black on top. So purple is not clear (since black is on it). And black is not on the table. So in the initial state, when brown_block_1 is on the table, the conditions "purple has something on top (black)" and "black not on table" are true. So the initial state already satisfies this. However, during the plan, if we put brown_block_1 back on the table, then at that state or after, we need to ensure that purple is covered and black isn't on the table. For example, if after moving brown_block_1 to orange, but that's the goal, so brown_block_1 is not on the table anymore. Wait, but the seventh constraint says that brown_block_1 must be on the table in some state, which is already true initially. So perhaps the initial state counts, and the eighth constraint is satisfied by the initial state. So maybe we don't have to worry about that, unless during the plan, we move brown_block_1 off the table and then put it back. But the goal is to have it on orange, so once moved, it's not on the table again. So the initial state satisfies the seventh constraint and the eighth constraint's condition is met in the initial state. So that's okay.

Now, the main goal is to get brown_block_1 on orange_block_1. To do that, we need to move brown_block_1 from the table to orange_block_1. But brown_block_1 currently has purple_block_1 on top, which has black_block_1 and green_block_1. So the stack is brown_block_1 -> purple -> black -> green. All of these need to be cleared to move brown_block_1. So first, we need to unstack green from black, then black from purple, then purple from brown_block_1. Then, we can pick up brown_block_1 and stack it on orange_block_1.

But wait, let's check the constraints again. The first constraint requires that at some state, the robot is holding brown_block_2 and orange_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1. But the goal is the opposite. So we need to have a state where orange is on brown_block_1, but then later move brown_block_1 to be on orange. That seems conflicting. So how can we do that?

Let me think. Let's say we need to first stack orange_block_1 onto brown_block_1, which would require moving brown_block_1's current stack (purple, etc.) and then stacking orange on brown_block_1. Then later, unstack orange and put it back, then stack brown_block_1 on orange. But that's adding steps, but maybe necessary for the constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps during the process of moving the blocks, we can have a temporary state where orange is on brown_block_1. For example, after clearing brown_block_1, we could stack orange on it, but then need to unstack it again to place brown on orange. But that would require more steps.

Wait, the first constraint requires that in at least one state, the robot is holding brown_block_2 AND orange is on brown_block_1. So two conditions must be true at the same time. So in that state, the robot is holding brown_block_2, and orange is on brown_block_1. How can that happen?

So to have orange on brown_block_1, we need to have moved orange from the table to brown_block_1. But currently, brown_block_1 has a stack (purple, black, green). So first, we need to clear brown_block_1. That requires moving green, black, and purple. Once brown_block_1 is clear, we can stack orange on it. But the robot would need to be holding orange_block_1. Then stack orange on brown_block_1. Then, perhaps the robot picks up brown_block_2 (from yellow_block_1, which is on the table). But during that time, orange is on brown_block_1. So that would satisfy the first constraint: holding brown_block_2 and orange on brown_block_1.

But then, after that, we need to move brown_block_1 to orange. But how? Because if brown_block_1 is under orange, we can't move it unless we first unstack orange from it.

So the plan would involve:

1. Unstack green from black, put it on the table.

2. Unstack black from purple, put it on the table.

3. Unstack purple from brown_block_1, put it on the table. Now brown_block_1 is clear.

4. Pickup orange_block_1 and stack it on brown_block_1. Now orange is on brown_block_1.

5. Now, need to hold brown_block_2. Since brown_block_2 is on yellow_block_1, which is on the table. So unstack brown_block_2 from yellow_block_1. But to do that, the robot must not be holding anything. So after stacking orange on brown_block_1, the robot is empty. Then unstack brown_block_2 from yellow. So now, robot is holding brown_block_2, and orange is on brown_block_1. That satisfies the first constraint.

But then, we need to proceed to get brown_block_1 onto orange. So after that, perhaps put down brown_block_2, then unstack orange from brown_block_1, put it on the table, then pickup brown_block_1 and stack on orange.

But this would add steps. Let's outline this:

Steps:

1. unstack green_block_1 black_block_1

2. putdown green_block_1

3. unstack black_block_1 purple_block_1

4. putdown black_block_1 (now black is on table, satisfying fourth constraint)

Wait, the fourth constraint requires that black_block_1 is on the table in at least one state. So putting it down here satisfies that.

Then fifth constraint: if black is on the table, then earlier state must have purple not on brown_block_1 or holding orange. But in step 3, when we unstack black from purple, purple is still on brown_block_1. So after step 4, black is on the table. The previous state (step 3) had purple on brown_block_1. So we need to have either purple not on brown_block_1 before putting black down, or hold orange before that. But in step 3, we unstack black from purple (which is on brown_block_1). So at step 3, purple is still on brown_block_1. So to satisfy the fifth constraint, we need before step 4 (where black is put down), in some earlier state, either purple is not on brown_block_1 or the robot is holding orange. But in the initial steps, we haven't moved purple yet. So when we put black down (step4), the earlier state (step3) has purple on brown_block_1. Therefore, this violates the fifth constraint. Because the condition for black on table (step4) requires that earlier state has either purple not on brown_block_1 or robot holding orange. But in step3, purple is on brown, and robot is holding black. So that's not satisfying.

So we need to adjust the plan. To satisfy the fifth constraint when we put black on the table, we must have either moved purple off brown_block_1 before, or have held orange before. So perhaps after unstacking black and putting it down, we need to do something else.

Alternatively, maybe we can first move purple_block_1 off brown_block_1 before moving black. Let's see:

Another approach:

1. unstack green from black.

2. putdown green.

3. unstack black from purple.

4. putdown black (now black is on table, step4). But fifth constraint: when black is on table (step4), need earlier state where either purple is not on brown or holding orange. But at step3, when we unstack black from purple, purple is still on brown. So that's not allowed. Therefore, we need to have either moved purple before step4 or held orange before step4.

So perhaps before moving black, we need to move purple. Let's try:

1. unstack green from black.

2. putdown green.

3. unstack black from purple.

4. stack black on orange_block_1 (but orange is clear). Wait, can we stack black on orange? Yes, if orange is clear. But then black is on orange. Then, when we need to put brown_block_1 on orange, we have to move black again.

Alternatively, perhaps after unstacking black, instead of putting it down, we can stack it somewhere else. But that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps after unstacking black from purple (step3), we need to do something that either moves purple or holds orange before putting black down.

But how? If we put black down, we need to have in an earlier step either purple not on brown or holding orange. So maybe after unstacking black (step3), we then unstack purple from brown_block_1 (step4), then putdown black (step5). But step4 would require that purple is clear. Wait, purple is under black, so initially, black is on purple. So to unstack purple from brown_block_1, we first need to remove black. Which we already did in step3. Wait, step3 is unstack black from purple, so after that, purple is clear. So step4 could be unstack purple from brown_block_1. Wait, but purple is on brown_block_1. So after step3, purple is on brown_block_1 and clear (since black was removed). So yes, we can unstack purple from brown_block_1.

So revised steps:

1. unstack green from black.

2. putdown green.

3. unstack black from purple.

4. putdown black. (Now, black is on table, which satisfies constraint4. But when we do step4, the fifth constraint requires that in an earlier state, either purple is not on brown or holding orange. But step3 is unstack black from purple, which leaves purple on brown. So before step4 (putting black down), we need to either move purple or hold orange. So perhaps after step3, we can hold purple instead of putting black down immediately.

Alternative steps:

1. unstack green from black.

2. putdown green.

3. unstack black from purple.

4. unstack purple from brown_block_1.

5. putdown purple.

6. putdown black. 

Wait, after step3, robot is holding black. Then step4 is unstack purple from brown_block_1, but robot is holding black, so can't do that. So this approach doesn't work.

Alternatively, after step3 (holding black), put down black (step4). Then, unstack purple from brown_block_1 (step5). Now, purple is clear. But after putting black down (step4), we need to satisfy the fifth constraint. So step4: black is on table. The earlier state (step3) is holding black, which was unstacked from purple which is on brown. So step3 has purple on brown. So to satisfy fifth constraint, before step4, there must be a state where either purple is not on brown or robot holds orange. But in step3, neither is the case. Therefore, this approach fails.

Hmm. So perhaps we need to, before moving black, first move purple. But to move purple, which is under black, we need to move black first. Which is a catch-22.

Alternatively, after unstacking black and holding it, maybe stack it on some other block instead of putting it down. For example, stack black on orange. Then, when we put black on orange, that's a stack action. Then, the fifth constraint: when black is on the table (but in this case, it's on orange), the fifth constraint requires that if black is on the table, which it isn't. Wait, the fourth constraint requires that black is on the table at some state. So if we stack black on orange, then it's not on the table. So we need to put it down at some point.

Alternatively, after unstacking black, put it down (step4). But then, to satisfy the fifth constraint, we need to have either moved purple before step4 or held orange before step4. So perhaps before step4, we need to pick up orange and hold it. So:

1. unstack green from black.

2. putdown green.

3. unstack black from purple. (robot holding black)

4. pickup orange_block_1. (But to pickup orange, it must be clear, which it is. So possible.)

5. stack black on something else? Or putdown black.

Wait, but after step3, robot is holding black. Then step4 is pickup orange, but robot can't hold two blocks. So that's impossible. So this approach won't work.

Alternative idea: After step3 (holding black), instead of putting it down, stack it on orange. Then step4: stack black orange_block_1. Now, black is on orange. Then, step5: unstack purple from brown_block_1. But purple is clear now. So step5: unstack purple from brown_block_1. Then putdown purple. Now, brown_block_1 is clear. Now, we can stack orange on brown_block_1. But orange has black on top. So we can't. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe after stacking black on orange, we can unstack it later. But this adds steps.

Wait, let's consider the fifth constraint again. The fifth constraint says: if black is on the table in some state, then earlier there's a state where either purple is not on brown or holding orange. So if we can avoid putting black on the table, then the fifth constraint is not triggered. But the fourth constraint requires that black is on the table in at least one state. So we have to put it down at some point. Therefore, we need to handle that.

So, perhaps the solution is to first move purple off brown_block_1 before moving black. But purple is under black. So we need to move black first. But moving black requires unstacking it from purple. Then, after moving black, we can move purple.

Wait, here's a possible plan:

1. unstack green_block_1 from black_block_1.

2. putdown green_block_1. (green is on table)

3. unstack black_block_1 from purple_block_1. (now holding black)

4. putdown black_block_1. (now black is on table, satisfying constraint4)

But step4 triggers the fifth constraint. So before step4, we need to have either purple not on brown or holding orange. So step3: after unstacking black, purple is still on brown_block_1. So in step3, we are holding black. So to satisfy the fifth constraint, before step4 (putting black down), we need to have a state where either purple is not on brown or holding orange. So perhaps between step3 and step4, we can hold orange. But we can't, since we're holding black. So alternative: before moving black, first move orange. But orange is on the table. So:

Alternative steps:

1. pickup orange_block_1.

2. stack orange_block_1 somewhere. Maybe on brown_block_1. Wait, but brown_block_1 has purple and black on top. So can't stack there.

Alternatively, stack orange on another block. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, put it back down. But that doesn't help.

Alternatively, after step3 (holding black), stack it on some other block that's clear, like yellow_block_1 (which has brown_block_2 on it, so not clear). Or brown_block_2 is on yellow. So yellow is not clear. Orange is clear. So stack black on orange. Then, black is on orange. Then, step5: unstack purple from brown_block_1. Now, purple is clear. Then putdown purple. Now, brown_block_1 is clear. Then, we can stack orange on brown_block_1. But orange has black on top. So we can't stack orange unless it's clear. So this approach isn't working.

Alternatively, after stacking black on orange, we need to unstack black again to free orange. But that's adding steps.

This is getting quite tangled. Maybe we need to approach the problem step by step, ensuring all constraints are met.

Let me outline the necessary steps to achieve the goal, then check where the constraints fit in.

Goal: brown_block_1 on orange_block_1.

Current stack on brown_block_1: purple, black, green.

So to move brown_block_1, need to clear it by removing purple, which requires removing black and green.

So steps to clear brown_block_1:

1. unstack green from black.

2. putdown green.

3. unstack black from purple.

4. putdown black.

5. unstack purple from brown_block_1.

6. putdown purple.

Now, brown_block_1 is clear. Then:

7. pickup brown_block_1.

8. stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_1.

But this would achieve the goal. Now, check constraints.

First constraint: during the plan, there must be a state where holding brown_block_2 and orange is on brown_block_1. In the above steps, that doesn't happen. So we need to adjust the plan to include this.

So perhaps after step6 (putdown purple), we need to create a state where orange is on brown_block_1, and during that time, hold brown_block_2.

Let's see. After step6, brown_block_1 is clear. So:

7. pickup orange_block_1.

8. stack orange_block_1 on brown_block_1. Now, orange is on brown_block_1.

9. Now, need to pickup brown_block_2. It's on yellow_block_1. So unstack brown_block_2 from yellow_block_1.

At step9, the robot is holding brown_block_2, and orange is on brown_block_1. This satisfies the first constraint.

Then, proceed to move brown_block_1 onto orange.

So after that:

10. putdown brown_block_2.

11. unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_1.

12. putdown orange_block_1.

13. pickup brown_block_1.

14. stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_1.

But this adds many steps. Let's check if this satisfies all constraints.

Constraint2: brown_block_1 not on table. Yes, when it's stacked on orange in step14, and also when it's stacked under orange in step8-11.

Constraint3: whenever brown_block_1 is not on table, there was an earlier state where brown_block_2 is on table or yellow is clear. For example, when brown_block_1 is stacked on orange (step8), the earlier state would be after step6, where brown_block_2 is on yellow. So to satisfy the condition, we need to have either brown_block_2 on table or yellow clear. At step8, brown_block_2 is on yellow, yellow is not clear. So we need to have moved brown_block_2 to the table or made yellow clear before step8. But in the current plan, brown_block_2 is moved to table in step9 when we unstack it. Wait, step9 is unstack brown_block_2 from yellow, which requires holding it, then in step10, put it down. So after step10, brown_block_2 is on table, which satisfies the condition. But the state when brown_block_1 is not on table (like step8) must have an earlier state where either brown_block_2 is on table or yellow is clear. But in step8, the earlier step is step7 (pickup orange), which is before moving brown_block_2. So that's not sufficient. Hmm, this is a problem.

Wait, constraint3 says: if in a state s, brown_block_1 is not on the table, then there must be an earlier state where either brown_block_2 is on the table or yellow_block_1 is clear. So in the plan above, when brown_block_1 is moved to orange (step14), it's not on the table. The earlier state before that must have either brown_block_2 on table or yellow clear. But in the steps, brown_block_2 is moved to the table in step10. So step10 is putdown brown_block_2. So after step10, brown_block_2 is on table. Then, in step14, when brown_block_1 is not on table, the earlier state (step10) has brown_block_2 on table. So that satisfies constraint3 for step14.

But when brown_block_1 is under orange in step8, which is not on the table, we need to check the earlier states. The state s is step8 (orange on brown_block_1). The earlier states before step8 would be steps1-7. In those steps, brown_block_2 is on yellow_block_1, which is not clear. So to satisfy constraint3 for step8, we need an earlier state where either brown_block_2 is on table or yellow is clear. But before step8, brown_block_2 is still on yellow. So we need to have moved brown_block_2 to the table or made yellow clear before step8. But in the current plan, brown_block_2 is moved in step9, which is after step8. So step8 violates constraint3.

Therefore, we need to adjust the plan so that before step8 (stacking orange on brown_block_1), we have either brown_block_2 on table or yellow clear. So perhaps we need to move brown_block_2 earlier.

Let's revise the plan:

After step6 (putdown purple), we have brown_block_1 clear.

7. unstack brown_block_2 from yellow_block_1. (Now holding brown_block_2)

8. putdown brown_block_2. (Now brown_block_2 is on table. This satisfies the sixth constraint (brown_block_2 on table or yellow clear), since brown_block_2 is on table. Also, step7 is unstack, so yellow_block_1 becomes clear. So step7 also satisfies the sixth constraint (yellow is clear). 

Now, after step8, brown_block_2 is on table. Then:

9. pickup orange_block_1.

10. stack orange_block_1 on brown_block_1. Now, orange is on brown_block_1.

At this point, the robot is empty. Then:

11. pickup brown_block_2. (But why? Because we need to have a state where the robot is holding brown_block_2 and orange is on brown_block_1. So step10: orange is on brown_block_1. Step11: pickup brown_block_2. So in step11, the robot is holding brown_block_2 and orange is on brown_block_1. That satisfies the first constraint.

Then:

12. putdown brown_block_2. 

13. unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_1.

14. putdown orange_block_1.

15. pickup brown_block_1.

16. stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_1.

Now, checking the constraints:

First constraint: step11 holds brown_block_2 and orange is on brown_block_1. Yes.

Second constraint: brown_block_1 not on table in step10, 11, 13-16. So satisfied.

Third constraint: for each state where brown_block_1 is not on table, check earlier state. For example, step10: brown_block_1 is not on table. The earlier state step8 has brown_block_2 on table, so satisfies. For step15: brown_block_1 is not on table. Earlier state step8 has brown_block_2 on table.

Fourth constraint: black_block_1 is on table in step4. Yes.

Fifth constraint: when black is on table (step4), earlier state must have purple not on brown or holding orange. Before step4 (putdown black), the previous steps are step3 (unstack black from purple, which is on brown). So step3: purple is on brown. So to satisfy fifth constraint, before step4, we need to have either moved purple (not on brown) or held orange. But step3 is unstack black from purple (still on brown). So in step3, we are holding black. So how to satisfy fifth constraint?

Ah, this is a problem. So when we put black down in step4, we need to have an earlier state where either purple is not on brown or we were holding orange. But in steps1-3, we haven't done anything with orange. So this violates the fifth constraint.

So we need to adjust the plan to satisfy the fifth constraint when we put black on the table (step4). 

How can we do that? We need to have either moved purple off brown before step4 or held orange before step4.

But in the current plan, step3 is unstack black from purple, which leaves purple on brown. So to satisfy the fifth constraint, before step4, we need to have held orange. So perhaps after step3 (holding black), instead of putting it down immediately, we need to first hold orange. But how? We can't hold two blocks. So maybe:

After step3 (holding black), do:

4. putdown black. (But this triggers fifth constraint. So need to have held orange before.)

Alternative approach:

After step3 (holding black):

4. stack black on orange_block_1. (Orange is clear.)

Then, step4: stack black orange. Now, black is on orange. Then step5: unstack purple from brown_block_1.

But step4 would mean black is not on the table, so the fourth constraint (black on table) is not met. So we need to put black on the table later.

Alternatively, after stacking black on orange, later unstack it and put it down. But that adds steps.

So:

1. unstack green from black.

2. putdown green.

3. unstack black from purple.

4. stack black on orange. (Now, black is on orange, not on table. Fourth constraint not met yet.)

5. unstack purple from brown_block_1.

6. putdown purple.

7. unstack black from orange. (To put black on table later.)

8. putdown black. (Now, fourth constraint is met.)

But when we putdown black in step8, the fifth constraint requires that before that, either purple is not on brown or holding orange. 

At step8, black is put down. The earlier state is step7 (unstack black from orange). Before step7, step5-6: purple is on table. So in step8, purple is not on brown. So when we putdown black in step8, the fifth constraint is satisfied because purple is not on brown (since step6 putdown purple). So this works.

So let's outline this revised plan:

1. unstack green_block_1 black_block_1

2. putdown green_block_1

3. unstack black_block_1 purple_block_1

4. stack black_block_1 orange_block_1

5. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1

6. putdown purple_block_1

7. unstack black_block_1 orange_block_1

8. putdown black_block_1

Now, step8 satisfies fourth constraint (black on table). Also, at step8, when we put black down, purple is already on table (step6), so purple is not on brown, satisfying the fifth constraint's requirement that before putting black down, either purple is not on brown or holding orange. Since purple was moved in step5-6, which is before step8.

Then, proceed to handle brown_block_1 and the constraints:

9. unstack brown_block_2 yellow_block_1

10. putdown brown_block_2

11. pickup orange_block_1

12. stack orange_block_1 brown_block_1

13. pickup brown_block_2

14. putdown brown_block_2

15. unstack orange_block_1 brown_block_1

16. putdown orange_block_1

17. pickup brown_block_1

18. stack brown_block_1 orange_block_1

This plan may work, but let's check each constraint.

First constraint: At step13, holding brown_block_2 and orange is on brown_block_1 (step12). Yes.

Second constraint: brown_block_1 not on table. Yes, in steps12-18.

Third constraint: whenever brown_block_1 is not on table, earlier state has brown_block_2 on table or yellow clear. For example, in step12 (orange on brown_block_1), the earlier step10 has brown_block_2 on table. So satisfied.

Fourth constraint: black on table at step8. Yes.

Fifth constraint: when black is put down at step8, earlier state (step5-6) has purple not on brown. Yes.

Sixth constraint: brown_block_2 on table or yellow clear. In step10, brown_block_2 is on table. So yes.

Seventh constraint: brown_block_1 on table in some state. Initially, it's on table. So yes.

Eighth constraint: if brown_block_1 is on table in state s, then at s or after, purple has a block on top and black not on table. Initially, brown_block_1 is on table, and purple is on it (with black on top). So in the initial state, purple has black on top (so not clear) and black is not on table. So this satisfies the eighth constraint. Other states where brown_block_1 is on table: none except the initial state, since we move it in step12. But the seventh constraint is satisfied by the initial state. So eighth constraint is satisfied.

This plan seems to satisfy all constraints. But let's check if it's optimal. The steps are numerous, but perhaps this is the minimal required.

Alternative approach: can we find a shorter path?

For example, after unstacking purple, instead of putting it down, can we stack it elsewhere? Maybe not necessary. Let's see.

Alternatively, after step5 (unstack purple from brown), could we stack it on top of brown_block_2 or something else, but that might not help.

But perhaps the plan is optimal given the constraints. Let's count the steps:

Original steps needed to clear brown_block_1: unstack green, putdown, unstack black, stack on orange, unstack purple, putdown, unstack black, putdown. Then moving brown_block_2, then orange, etc. So it's a bit lengthy, but due to the constraints, it's necessary.

Another possible optimization: after step4 (stack black on orange), maybe we can leave it there and proceed, but the fourth constraint requires black to be on the table, so we have to put it down eventually.

Yes, so step8 is necessary.

Thus, the plan outlined above seems to satisfy all constraints and achieve the goal.
