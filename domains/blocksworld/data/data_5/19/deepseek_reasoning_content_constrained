Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to get the robotic arm to hold grey_block_1. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy, so I need to be careful.

First, let me understand the initial state. The blocks are arranged as follows:

- blue_block_1 is on the table with black_block_1 on top of it, then grey_block_1 on top of black_block_1, and grey_block_2 on top of grey_block_1. So the tower here is blue -> black -> grey_1 -> grey_2. All clear except grey_2 is clear.

- yellow_block_1 is on the table with brown_block_1 on top. Brown is clear.

- red_block_1 is on the table and clear.

The arm is empty.

The goal is to have the arm holding grey_block_1. So I need to get grey_block_1 into the arm's grasp.

Now, the constraints. Let's list them out:

1. **Always**: grey_block_2 is not on the table. So in every state of the plan, grey_block_2 must be on top of another block. Since initially, it's on grey_block_1, that's okay. But if we ever putdown grey_block_2, that's a problem. So actions that would put grey_block_2 on the table are forbidden.

2. **At least once**: yellow_block_1 is not clear (has a block on top). But in the initial state, brown_block_1 is on yellow, so yellow is not clear. Wait, initial state has brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1. So the initial state already satisfies this. But maybe during the plan, if brown is moved, then we have to make sure that at some point yellow has something on top again. But the constraint says "at least one state" must have it. Since the initial state already meets this, maybe this constraint is already satisfied. But wait, the problem says the plan must bring about the goal while satisfying all constraints. However, perhaps if during the plan, the brown_block is moved, then the yellow_block becomes clear again. So we need to ensure that at some state in the plan (maybe the initial state counts), this condition is met. Since the initial state meets it, maybe this constraint is already handled. But need to confirm.

3. **If** at any state s, yellow_block_1 is not clear (has a block on top), then in s or some state after, either black_block_1 is on brown_block_1 or the arm is holding black_block_1. Since initially, yellow is not clear (has brown on top), then this implication applies. So either in the initial state or after, black must be on brown or being held. But in the initial state, black is on blue. So we have to make sure that if brown is ever on yellow (which it is initially), then after that, either black is moved to brown or the arm holds black. So in this case, the initial state requires that at some point after, either black is on brown or held. So perhaps during the plan, after the initial state, we have to satisfy this. So if we remove brown from yellow, but then maybe put something else on yellow, but not sure. Need to track this.

4. **At least once**: black_block_1 is clear. Currently, in the initial state, grey_block_1 is on black_block_1, so black is not clear. So we need to unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1 at some point, making black clear. That would satisfy this constraint.

5. **If** black_block_1 is clear in some state, then in an earlier state, either yellow_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_1 is clear. Currently, blue_block_1 has black on top, so blue is not clear. So when we make black_block_1 clear (by removing grey_block_1 and grey_block_2 from above), we need to have had a prior state where either yellow is not on the table (but yellow is on table initially) or blue is clear. Blue is clear only if nothing is on it. Initially, black is on blue, so blue is not clear. So to satisfy this implication, when we make black clear (say by unstacking grey_1 from black), we need to have had a previous state where either yellow is not on table (but yellow is on table) or blue is clear. But blue is not clear initially. So perhaps during the plan, before making black clear, we need to make blue clear. How? Maybe by removing black from blue. But that would require unstacking black from blue, but black is under grey_1 and grey_2. Wait, the initial stack is blue -> black -> grey_1 -> grey_2. So to get blue clear, we need to remove everything above it. But that would require unstacking grey_2 from grey_1, then unstacking grey_1 from black, then unstacking black from blue. But if we do that, then blue is clear, which could satisfy the condition. But if we do that before making black clear, then when we make black clear (by unstacking grey_1 from it), the prior state would have had blue clear. So that would satisfy the implication. So maybe this is part of the plan.

6. **At least once**: blue_block_1 is not clear (has a block on top). Initially, blue has black on top, so this is already true. So this constraint is satisfied in the initial state, but we have to ensure that in the plan, this condition remains true or is achieved again. Wait, no: the constraint is that at least one state in the plan must have blue_block_1 not clear. Since the initial state already satisfies this, this constraint is met. But if during the plan, we remove all blocks from blue, then in some states, blue is clear, but as long as there's at least one state (like the initial one) where it's not, then it's okay.

7. **If** blue_block_1 is not clear in some state s, then in s or after, grey_block_1 is on top of blue. Initially, blue has black on top, so the condition holds. So this implication says that whenever blue is not clear (has a block on top), then in that state or later, grey_block_1 must be on blue. But in the initial state, blue has black on top, which is not grey_block_1. So this would violate the constraint unless after the initial state, we make sure that at some point, grey_block_1 is placed on blue. So this is a problem. So whenever blue is not clear (which is initially true), we need to have in that state or later that grey_block_1 is on blue. But currently, blue has black, so in the initial state, the implication is violated unless we later put grey_block_1 on blue. So the plan must include putting grey_block_1 on blue_block_1 at some point after any state where blue is not clear. But blue starts not clear. Therefore, the plan must include a step where grey_block_1 is stacked on blue_block_1, either during or after the initial state. But the initial state has black on blue, so we can't stack grey_1 on blue unless we first remove black. So perhaps after moving black away, then stack grey_1 on blue. But this has to happen after the initial state, which triggers the implication. So this is a critical constraint. So during the plan, whenever blue is not clear (which starts as true), we must have grey_1 on blue in that state or later. So the initial state violates this unless we later stack grey_1 on blue. So that's a must-do step.

8. **At least once**: blue_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1. Well, initially, blue is on the table, so it's not on brown. Brown is on yellow. So this constraint is already satisfied in the initial state. So no problem here.

9. **If** blue is not on brown in state s, then in s or later, either black is not on blue or red is not clear. Initially, blue is not on brown, so the implication requires that in the initial state or later, either black is not on blue or red has a block on top. In the initial state, black is on blue, and red is clear. So the initial state violates this implication unless later in the plan, either black is removed from blue or a block is placed on red. So we need to ensure that whenever blue is not on brown (which is always true unless we stack blue on brown, which we probably won't do), then either black is not on blue or red is not clear. So since blue is not on brown in the initial state, and in that state, black is on blue and red is clear, which violates the implication. Therefore, to satisfy this, the plan must either move black off blue or put a block on red, during or after the initial state. So we need to do one of those two things.

So the constraints are quite involved. Let me try to outline the steps needed to achieve the goal and satisfy all constraints.

The goal is to hold grey_block_1. To pick up grey_block_1, it must be clear and on the table. But in the initial state, grey_block_1 is under grey_block_2. So we need to first unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1. But constraint 1 says that grey_block_2 must never be on the table. So after unstacking grey_block_2 from grey_1, we can't put it down. So we have to stack it somewhere else.

Wait, let's think. The initial state has grey_2 on grey_1. To get grey_1, we need to unstack grey_2, then unstack grey_1 from black_block_1. But after unstacking grey_2, we can't put it on the table (due to constraint 1). So we need to find another block to stack it on. The blocks available are: blue, black, grey_1, yellow, brown, red. But after unstacking grey_2, the arm is holding it. Where can we stack it? It can be stacked on any clear block. So possible targets: red_block_1 (since it's clear), or perhaps brown_block_1 (if we can clear it), or maybe yellow_block_1 (but brown is on yellow, so brown is clear. Wait, in the initial state, brown is on yellow, so yellow is not clear. So we can't stack on yellow. So possible targets: red, or maybe brown if we unstack brown from yellow. But if we unstack brown from yellow, then yellow becomes clear. But constraint 2 requires that at least once, yellow is not clear, which is already satisfied in the initial state. However, if we unstack brown from yellow, then during the plan, we need to make sure that if yellow is not clear again (but maybe we don't have to, since the constraint is "at least once", which is already met by the initial state). However, there's another constraint: constraint 3 says that whenever yellow is not clear, then in that state or later, black is on brown or being held. So if we restack something on yellow, that could trigger this.

But let's focus on handling grey_2 first. So after unstacking grey_2 from grey_1, we need to stack it somewhere. Let's consider stacking it on red_block_1. Because red is clear and on the table. So:

1. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
   - Preconditions: grey_2 is on grey_1, grey_2 is clear, arm is empty.
   - Effects: arm holds grey_2, grey_1 becomes clear.

But after this, we need to stack grey_2 on red.

2. stack grey_block_2 red_block_1
   - Preconditions: arm holds grey_2, red is clear.
   - After stacking, red is not clear, grey_2 is on red, arm is empty.

Now, with grey_2 on red, which is allowed as long as grey_2 is not on the table (constraint 1 is satisfied).

Now, we can proceed to unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1.

3. unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1
   - Preconditions: grey_1 is on black, grey_1 is clear (since we unstacked grey_2 from it earlier), arm is empty.
   - Effects: arm holds grey_1, black becomes clear.

Now, we have the arm holding grey_block_1, which is the goal. But wait, the goal is to have the arm holding grey_block_1. So is this the end? But let's check the constraints.

Wait, after step 3, the arm is holding grey_1, which is the goal. But let's check if all constraints are satisfied throughout the plan.

But let's check the constraints step by step.

First, constraint 1: grey_block_2 is not on the table in any state. In step 1, after unstacking, grey_2 is in the arm. Then in step 2, it's stacked on red. So grey_2 is never on the table. So that's good.

Constraint 2: at least once yellow has a block on top. Initially, brown is on yellow, so this is already true. So no issue.

Constraint 3: if yellow is not clear (has a block on top), then in that state or later, black is on brown or held. In the initial state, yellow is not clear (brown on top). So we need to ensure that either in the initial state or later, black is on brown or held. In the initial state, black is on blue. So we need to do this during the plan. But in the current steps 1-3, we haven't addressed this. So this constraint is violated unless we do something about it.

So, during the plan, after the initial state (where yellow is not clear), we need to have black on brown or held. So perhaps after the initial steps, we need to move black to brown or pick up black.

But how? Let's see. Let's consider that after step 3, the arm is holding grey_1. The goal is achieved. But the plan would end here. But we need to check if all constraints are satisfied.

But in the initial state, the implication of constraint 3 is triggered: yellow is not clear. Therefore, in the initial state or later, black must be on brown or held. But in the initial state, black is on blue, not on brown. So in some state after the initial, we need to have black on brown or held.

But in the plan steps 1-3, after the initial state, the steps are:

1. unstack grey_2 from grey_1 (arm holds grey_2)
2. stack grey_2 on red (arm empty)
3. unstack grey_1 from black (arm holds grey_1)

At this point, the goal is achieved. But constraint 3 requires that after the initial state (which is s0), in some state after s0, black is on brown or held. However, in the current steps, black is still on blue. So this would violate constraint 3. Therefore, the plan is invalid.

Therefore, we need to adjust the plan to address this. So we need to ensure that after the initial state, at some point, black is on brown or held.

So perhaps after step 3, when the arm is holding grey_1, we need to do something else. But the goal is to hold grey_1, so the plan could end there. However, the constraints require that whenever yellow is not clear (which in the initial state it is), then in that state or later, black is on brown or held. Since the initial state is s0, and in the plan, after s0, the steps are executed. So s0 is the initial state, and s1 is step 1, etc. So in s0, yellow is not clear. Therefore, the implication is that in s0 or any state after, black must be on brown or held. But in s0, it's not. So we need to have in the plan a state where black is on brown or held. But how?

So, perhaps after moving grey_2 and grey_1, we need to move black onto brown. Let's think.

Alternative approach:

1. unstack grey_2 from grey_1 → hold grey_2
2. stack grey_2 on red → grey_2 on red, arm empty
3. unstack grey_1 from black → hold grey_1 (goal achieved)
But we need to handle constraint 3. So after step 3, the arm holds grey_1. But the problem is that during the initial state, which is s0, yellow is not clear. The implication is that in s0 or after, black must be on brown or held. So during the plan, after s0, we need to have black on brown or held. But in the current steps, after s0, the steps are 1,2,3. In none of these steps is black moved or held.

Therefore, to satisfy constraint 3, we need to add steps where black is either stacked on brown or picked up.

So let's adjust the plan. After step 2 (stack grey_2 on red), perhaps pick up black_block_1 and stack it on brown_block_1. But to do that, we need to first unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1. But in the initial state, black is under grey_1 and grey_2. So after step 1 and 2, grey_2 is on red, and grey_1 is on black. So after step 3, grey_1 is in the arm. Then, to get black, we need to unstack black from blue, but black is clear after step 3 (since grey_1 was unstacked). Wait, after step 3, grey_1 is in the arm, so black_block_1 is clear. So perhaps after step 3:

4. putdown grey_1 → but the goal is to hold grey_1, so that's not allowed. So instead, after step 3, the arm is holding grey_1 (goal achieved), but we need to ensure that black is on brown or held in some state after the initial. So perhaps before step 3, we need to move black.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's try a different approach.

Alternative plan:

1. unstack brown_block_1 from yellow_block_1 → hold brown
   - Preconditions: brown is on yellow, brown is clear, arm empty.
   - Effects: arm holds brown, yellow becomes clear.

But this would make yellow clear, which might affect constraint 2, but since constraint 2 is "at least once", which is already met in the initial state, it's okay. However, constraint 3 says that whenever yellow is not clear, then in that state or after, black is on brown or held. But after step 1, yellow becomes clear. So if we don't put anything back on yellow, then the only state where yellow is not clear is the initial state. But the initial state triggers constraint 3, requiring that in s0 or later, black is on brown or held. So after moving brown, in the plan, we need to have black on brown or held.

So let's proceed:

1. unstack brown_block_1 from yellow_block_1 → hold brown
2. stack brown_block_1 black_block_1 → but wait, black is under grey_1 and grey_2. So to stack brown on black, we need black to be clear. But initially, black has grey_1 on top. So we can't stack on black unless we clear it.

Alternatively, stack brown on red. Then:

2. stack brown_block_1 red_block_1 → red is clear before stacking. After stacking, red has brown on top.

But then, after this, we can proceed to handle the grey_1.

But this seems to complicate things. Alternatively, stack brown on blue. But blue has black on top. So not possible unless we unstack black.

Alternatively, after unstacking brown, we can put it down, but constraint 1 says that grey_2 can't be on the table. But brown can be put down. Wait, constraint 1 is only about grey_block_2. So putting brown on the table is allowed. Wait, no: constraint 1 is "grey_block_2 is not on the table in every state". Putting brown on the table is allowed. So if we unstack brown from yellow, we can put it on the table. Then:

1. unstack brown_block_1 yellow_block_1 → hold brown
2. putdown brown_block_1 → brown is on table, clear.

But then yellow is clear. But the initial state already satisfies constraint 2 (yellow not clear), so it's okay. Then, in this case, the implication of constraint 3 (when yellow is not clear) applies to the initial state. So we need to have black on brown or held in s0 or later. Since in the initial state, black is on blue, we need to move black to brown or hold it later.

But this approach may require additional steps. Let's see:

After putting brown on the table, we can then work on the stack involving blue, black, grey_1, and grey_2.

So steps:

1. unstack brown_block_1 from yellow_block_1 → hold brown
2. putdown brown_block_1 → brown on table
3. unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1 → hold grey_2
4. stack grey_block_2 brown_block_1 → requires brown to be clear. After step 2, brown is on table and clear. So yes. Now grey_2 is on brown, which is on table. This satisfies constraint 1 (grey_2 not on table? Wait, grey_2 is on brown, which is on table. So grey_2 is not on the table. So that's okay. Because the constraint is that grey_2 is never on the table. So stacking it on brown (which is on table) is allowed. Because grey_2 is on brown, not directly on table.

Then, after stacking grey_2 on brown, we can unstack grey_1 from black.

5. unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1 → hold grey_1 (goal achieved)

But now, we need to handle constraint 3. Since the initial state (s0) has yellow not clear (brown on yellow), we need to ensure that in s0 or later, black is on brown or held. But in this plan, after step 1, brown is on the table. Then in step 4, grey_2 is stacked on brown. But black is still on blue. So we need to move black to brown.

So perhaps after step 5 (holding grey_1), we can put it down and then work on moving black.

But the goal is to have the arm holding grey_1. So the plan can't put it down. So perhaps during the plan, before achieving the goal, we need to move black to brown.

Alternative plan steps:

1. unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1 → hold grey_2
2. stack grey_block_2 red_block_1 → grey_2 on red, arm empty
3. unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1 → hold grey_1 (goal achieved)
4. Now, to satisfy constraint 3, we need to move black_block_1 to brown_block_1 or pick it up. But the arm is holding grey_1. So we need to put it down first, but that would make the goal not achieved. So this is a problem.

Alternatively, before step 3, we handle moving black.

But to move black, which is on blue, we need to unstack black from blue. But black is under grey_1 and grey_2. After steps 1 and 2, grey_2 is on red. grey_1 is still on black. So to unstack black from blue, we need to first unstack grey_1 from black.

Wait, but step 3 is unstacking grey_1 from black. So after step 3, black is clear. Then we can unstack black from blue.

But let's see:

After step 3, we have:

- Arm holds grey_1 (goal)
- black is clear
- blue has black on it

So to move black to brown, we need to unstack black from blue.

But the arm is already holding grey_1. So we can't do that unless we put down grey_1, which would abandon the goal. So this is a problem.

Alternative approach: instead of immediately going for grey_1, first move black to brown.

But how? Let's think:

1. unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1 → hold grey_2
2. stack grey_block_2 red_block_1 → grey_2 on red
3. unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1 → hold grey_1
4. putdown grey_block_1 → grey_1 on table (but this would make the goal not achieved)
5. unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1 → hold black
6. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1 → black on brown
7. pickup grey_block_1 → now arm holds grey_1 (goal)

But this adds steps. Also, during step 4, grey_1 is on table. But there's no constraint against that, except for constraint 1 (grey_2 not on table, which is satisfied here). But this plan has more steps and may not be optimal. Also, need to check all constraints.

But let's see if this satisfies the constraints.

Constraint 3: when yellow is not clear (initially, yes). So in s0, we need to ensure that in s0 or after, black is on brown or held. In this plan, step 5 and 6 move black to brown. So in step 6, black is on brown. So after step 6, the condition is satisfied.

Constraint 7: if blue is not clear (has a block), then in that state or later, grey_1 is on blue. Initially, blue has black. So we need to have grey_1 on blue at some point after. In the plan above, after step 6, blue is clear. So the only time blue is not clear is in the initial state and steps before step 5. So in the initial state, blue is not clear (has black), so we need to have grey_1 on blue at some point after. But in this plan, after moving black to brown (step 6), blue is clear. So the initial state's condition requires that grey_1 is on blue at some point after. But in this plan, grey_1 is put on the table in step 4, then picked up again in step 7. So grey_1 is never on blue. Therefore, this violates constraint 7.

So this plan is invalid.

So we need to have grey_1 on blue at some point after the initial state. So perhaps after moving black, we stack grey_1 on blue.

Alternative steps:

1. unstack grey_2 from grey_1 → hold grey_2
2. stack grey_2 on red → arm empty
3. unstack grey_1 from black → hold grey_1
4. stack grey_1 blue_block_1 → now grey_1 is on blue
5. unstack grey_1 from blue → hold grey_1 again

But this would be redundant. Also, after step 4, blue has grey_1 on it. But initially, blue had black. So after step 4, blue has grey_1. Then, if we unstack grey_1 from blue, we can hold it again. But this adds steps.

But this would satisfy constraint 7: whenever blue is not clear (which after step 4, blue has grey_1, so not clear), then in that state or later, grey_1 is on blue. Well, in step 4, grey_1 is on blue, so that's already satisfied. So after step 4, the condition is met.

But then, when we unstack grey_1 from blue (step 5), blue becomes clear. So in the final state, blue is clear. But constraint 6 requires that at least once, blue is not clear. Which is satisfied in steps 0-4.

But let's see:

In this adjusted plan:

1. unstack grey_2 from grey_1 → hold grey_2
2. stack grey_2 on red → arm empty
3. unstack grey_1 from black → hold grey_1
4. stack grey_1 on blue → grey_1 on blue, arm empty
5. pickup grey_1 → hold grey_1 (goal)

Now, let's check constraints.

Constraint 7: whenever blue is not clear, in that state or later, grey_1 is on blue. In the initial state, blue is not clear (has black). So we need to have grey_1 on blue after that. In step 4, grey_1 is stacked on blue, so after the initial state, in step 4, grey_1 is on blue. So this satisfies the constraint.

Constraint 3: after the initial state (s0), since yellow was not clear, we need to have black on brown or held. In this plan, steps 1-5 don't move black. So black remains on blue. Thus, violating constraint 3.

So this is still a problem.

Therefore, we need to address constraint 3 by moving black to brown or holding it.

So perhaps after step 4 (stack grey_1 on blue), we can unstack black from blue and stack it on brown.

But after step 4, grey_1 is on blue. So:

After step 4:

- blue has grey_1 on top.
- black is under grey_1, but wait no: step 3 was unstacking grey_1 from black, so after step 3, black is clear. Then step 4 stacks grey_1 on blue. So black is still on blue. Wait, no: original stack is blue -> black -> grey_1 -> grey_2.

After step 1: unstack grey_2 from grey_1 → grey_2 in arm, grey_1 clear.

After step 2: stack grey_2 on red → grey_2 on red, arm empty.

Step 3: unstack grey_1 from black → grey_1 in arm, black clear.

So after step 3, black is on blue and clear.

Step 4: stack grey_1 on blue → grey_1 on blue, arm empty. Now, blue has grey_1 on top, and black is on blue under grey_1? No, wait: the stack is blue -> black. When you unstack grey_1 from black, black is on blue. Then stacking grey_1 on blue would place it on top of blue, making the stack blue -> grey_1. But black is still on blue. Wait, this is not possible. Because when you stack, you place the block on another block. So if blue is on the table, stacking grey_1 on blue would place grey_1 directly on blue. But black is already on blue. So this would require that blue is clear. But after step 3, black is on blue and clear (since grey_1 was removed). So blue has black on it. So you can't stack grey_1 on blue unless you first remove black.

Ah, here's a mistake. After step 3:

- black_block_1 is on blue_block_1 and is clear (since grey_1 was unstacked from it).

So blue has black on top. To stack grey_1 on blue, blue must be clear (since stacking requires the target block to be clear). But blue has black on top. Therefore, step 4 (stack grey_1 on blue) is not possible, because blue is not clear (it has black on top). So this is invalid.

Therefore, the previous approach is flawed. So we need to adjust.

So after step 3, the arm is holding grey_1. The blocks are:

- blue -> black (clear)
- grey_2 on red
- brown on yellow (initially), but in some plans, brown may have been moved.

So to stack grey_1 on blue, we need to first clear blue. But blue has black on top. So we need to unstack black from blue.

But to unstack black from blue, we need to pick up black, which is clear. So:

4. unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1 → hold black
5. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1 → requires brown to be clear. Initially, brown is on yellow, but if we moved brown earlier, perhaps.

Wait, let's start over with a different plan.

Alternative plan considering all constraints:

1. unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1 → hold grey_2
2. stack grey_block_2 red_block_1 → arm empty
3. unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1 → hold grey_1 (goal achieved)
4. unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1 → requires black is clear (which it is after step 3), arm is empty (but after step 3, arm is holding grey_1, so this is impossible.

So can't do step 4 after step 3.

Alternative approach: before step 3, unstack black from blue.

But to unstack black from blue, we need to first clear black, which requires unstacking grey_1 and grey_2 from it.

So:

1. unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1 → hold grey_2
2. stack grey_block_2 red_block_1 → arm empty
3. unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1 → hold grey_1
4. putdown grey_block_1 → grey_1 on table, arm empty
5. unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1 → hold black
6. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1 → requires brown is clear. But brown is on yellow initially. So need to unstack brown first.

But this is getting too long. Let's think again.

Alternative plan to satisfy constraint 3:

After unstacking grey_2 and grey_1, we need to move black to brown.

But after unstacking grey_1, the arm is holding it. So perhaps before that, we can move black.

But that's not possible because black is under grey_1 and grey_2.

Alternative idea: first move brown from yellow to another place, then move black to brown.

But this requires several steps.

Let's try:

1. unstack brown_block_1 from yellow_block_1 → hold brown
2. stack brown_block_1 red_block_1 → now red has brown on top
3. unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1 → hold grey_2
4. stack grey_block_2 brown_block_1 → grey_2 on brown (which is on red)
5. unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1 → hold grey_1 (goal)
6. unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1 → arm empty? No, arm is holding grey_1. So need to put down grey_1 first.
7. putdown grey_block_1 → but goal is to hold it.

This approach isn't working.

Alternative plan:

To satisfy constraint 3, we need to have black on brown or held after the initial state.

Since the initial state has yellow not clear (brown on yellow), we can either:

a) Move black to brown (stack black on brown)
b) Pick up black and hold it at some point

But to stack black on brown, we need to clear brown. Brown is on yellow. So first, unstack brown from yellow.

Steps:

1. unstack brown_block_1 from yellow_block_1 → hold brown
2. stack brown_block_1 red_block_1 → now red has brown, yellow is clear
3. unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1 → but black is under grey_1 and grey_2. So we need to unstack grey_2 and grey_1 first.

So:

3. unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1 → hold grey_2
4. stack grey_block_2 brown_block_1 (which is on red) → grey_2 on brown
5. unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1 → hold grey_1
6. unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1 → arm empty? No, holding grey_1. So need to put down grey_1 first.

This is getting too convoluted. Perhaps the optimal plan is to first move brown to another location, then move black to brown, and then proceed to get grey_1.

But each step adds to the plan length, and we need an optimal plan with minimal steps.

Alternatively, perhaps during the process of getting grey_1, we can also handle moving black.

Wait, the goal is to hold grey_1. So the minimal steps would be to unstack grey_2, unstack grey_1. But to satisfy the constraints, we need to also move black to brown or hold it.

So here's an idea:

After unstacking grey_2 and stacking it on red, then unstack grey_1. Then, while holding grey_1, unstack black from blue (but can't, since the arm is holding grey_1). So that's not possible. So need to put down grey_1, but that would abandon the goal.

So perhaps the plan must include moving black to brown after unstacking grey_1, but before achieving the goal.

But that would require:

1. unstack grey_2 from grey_1 → hold grey_2
2. stack grey_2 on red → arm empty
3. unstack grey_1 from black → hold grey_1
4. putdown grey_1 → grey_1 on table, arm empty
5. unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1 → hold black
6. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1 → requires brown to be clear. Initially, brown is on yellow. So need to unstack brown first.

So:

6. unstack brown_block_1 from yellow_block_1 → hold brown
7. putdown brown_block_1 → brown on table
8. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1 → black on brown
9. pickup grey_block_1 → hold grey_1 (goal)

But this is nine steps, which is way too long. And maybe not optimal.

But let's check constraints:

- constraint 3: yellow was not clear in s0. Then, in s6, we unstack brown from yellow, making yellow clear. But the constraint only requires that in at least one state, yellow is not clear, which is satisfied in s0. The implication is that whenever yellow is not clear, then in that state or later, black is on brown or held. In s0, yellow is not clear, so we need to have black on brown or held in s0 or later. In s8, black is on brown. So this satisfies the implication.

- constraint 7: whenever blue is not clear (in s0, s1-8), then in that state or later, grey_1 is on blue. In s0, blue has black, so we need grey_1 on blue at some point after. In the plan, grey_1 is put on table in s4, then picked up in s9. So grey_1 is never on blue. Thus, violates constraint 7.

So this plan is invalid.

This is getting very complicated. Let's try to find a way to satisfy all constraints with minimal steps.

Another approach: use the fact that constraint 7 requires that whenever blue is not clear (which it is initially), then grey_1 must be on blue at that state or later. So we need to stack grey_1 on blue at some point after the initial state.

So perhaps after unstacking grey_1 from black, we stack it on blue.

Steps:

1. unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1 → hold grey_2
2. stack grey_block_2 red_block_1 → arm empty
3. unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1 → hold grey_1
4. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_1 → but blue has black on top. So to stack on blue, blue must be clear. But after step 3, black is on blue and clear. So blue is not clear (has black), so target block for stack must be clear. So you can't stack on blue if blue has black. So this is invalid.

Wait, no: blue is a block on the table. If you want to stack grey_1 on blue, blue must be clear. But blue has black on top. So blue is not clear. Therefore, can't stack grey_1 on blue. So this is impossible.

Thus, we need to first clear blue by removing black.

So:

1. unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1 → hold grey_2
2. stack grey_block_2 red_block_1 → arm empty
3. unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1 → hold grey_1
4. putdown grey_block_1 → grey_1 on table
5. unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1 → hold black
6. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1 → requires brown to be clear. Brown is on yellow initially. So need to unstack brown first.

Continuing:

6. unstack brown_block_1 from yellow_block_1 → hold brown
7. putdown brown_block_1 → brown on table
8. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1 → black on brown
9. pickup grey_block_1 → hold grey_1 (goal)

But again, this leads to grey_1 not being on blue, violating constraint 7.

So to satisfy constraint 7, after unstacking grey_1, we need to stack it on blue. But that requires blue to be clear. So after unstacking black from blue (step 5), we can stack grey_1 on blue.

So steps:

1. unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1 → hold grey_2
2. stack grey_block_2 red_block_1 → arm empty
3. unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1 → hold grey_1
4. putdown grey_block_1 → grey_1 on table
5. unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1 → hold black
6. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1 → requires brown to be clear. So unstack brown from yellow first.
7. unstack brown_block_1 from yellow_block_1 → hold brown
8. putdown brown_block_1 → brown on table
9. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1 → black on brown
10. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_1 → blue is clear (after step 5, blue is clear)
11. pickup grey_block_1 → hold grey_1 (goal)

But this is 11 steps. And the goal is achieved at step 11. But this seems too long. Also, constraint 7 is satisfied because after step 10, grey_1 is on blue. So whenever blue is not clear (initially, until step 5), we need to have grey_1 on blue after. After step 10, grey_1 is on blue, so after the initial state, step 10 fulfills that requirement.

But this is a very long plan. Is there a shorter way?

Let's think of another approach.

What if we stack grey_1 on blue after unstacking it from black?

But blue has black on top. So we need to first move black.

But how?

1. unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1 → hold grey_2
2. stack grey_block_2 red_block_1 → arm empty
3. unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1 → hold grey_1
4. unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1 → arm must be empty. But after step 3, arm is holding grey_1. Can't do this.

So we need to put down grey_1 first.

4. putdown grey_block_1 → grey_1 on table
5. unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1 → hold black
6. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1 → unstack brown first.
7. unstack brown_block_1 from yellow_block_1 → hold brown
8. putdown brown_block_1 → brown on table
9. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1 → black on brown
10. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_1 → grey_1 on blue
11. pickup grey_block_1 → hold grey_1 (goal)

Still 11 steps. But this is not optimal. The optimal plan should have the fewest steps possible.

Alternative idea: Use the brown_block_1 that's on yellow. If we stack black on brown while brown is on yellow, that would leave yellow not clear, but brown would have black on top. But according to constraint 3, when yellow is not clear (as it is in the initial state), we need black on brown or held. If we stack black on brown (which is on yellow), then yellow is not clear (still has brown and black), and black is on brown. So this satisfies constraint 3.

So steps:

1. unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1 → hold grey_2
2. stack grey_block_2 red_block_1 → arm empty
3. unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1 → hold grey_1
4. unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1 → arm empty? No, holding grey_1. Can't do.

Alternative plan:

1. unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1 → hold grey_2
2. stack grey_block_2 red_block_1 → arm empty
3. unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1 → hold grey_1
4. unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1 → arm empty? No, still holding grey_1. So need to put down grey_1.

4. putdown grey_block_1 → grey_1 on table
5. unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1 → hold black
6. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1 → brown is on yellow. So need to unstack brown first? Or stack black on brown while brown is on yellow.

Wait, can we stack black on brown while brown is on yellow? The stack action requires that the target block (brown) is clear. Brown is on yellow, so to stack black on brown, brown must be clear. But initially, brown is on yellow, so brown is clear. So:

6. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1 → stack black on brown (which is on yellow). This makes yellow not clear (since brown is on yellow and black on brown). But this is allowed. So:

After step 6:

- yellow has brown, which has black on top.

This satisfies constraint 3: in the initial state, yellow is not clear (brown on top). The plan must ensure that in s0 or later, black is on brown or held. By step 6, black is on brown, which satisfies this.

Then:

7. pickup grey_block_1 → hold grey_1 (goal)

This plan has 7 steps. Let's check constraints.

Constraint 1: grey_block_2 is never on the table. Steps 1-2 ensure it's stacked on red.

Constraint 2: at least once yellow is not clear. Initial state has brown on yellow. Step 6 adds black on brown, so yellow is still not clear. So satisfied.

Constraint 3: in s0, yellow is not clear. In step 6, black is on brown, so satisfied.

Constraint 4: at least once black_block_1 is clear. In step 5, after unstacking black from blue, black is held. But when we stack it on brown (step 6), black is on brown, so black is clear only if nothing is on top. After step 6, black is on brown and clear. So during step 6, after stacking, black is not clear (since it's under nothing). Wait, no: stacking black on brown makes black clear (since nothing is on top), and brown is not clear. So in step 6, after stacking, black is clear. So constraint 4 is satisfied in step 6.

Constraint 5: if black is clear in some state, then there must be an earlier state where yellow is not on table or blue is clear. When does black become clear? After step 6, black is on brown, and clear. So in step 6, black is clear. The earlier states must have either yellow not on table (but yellow is on table) or blue clear. When is blue cleared? After step 5, blue is clear (since black was unstacked from it). So the state after step 5 has blue clear. So the condition is satisfied: before step 6 (where black is clear), step 5 made blue clear.

Constraint 6: at least once blue is not clear. Initially, blue is not clear. So satisfied.

Constraint 7: whenever blue is not clear, then grey_1 is on blue at that state or later. In the initial state, blue is not clear. So we need to have grey_1 on blue at some point after. But in this plan, grey_1 is put on table in step 4, then picked up in step 7. So never on blue. This violates constraint 7.

Ah, here's the problem again. So this plan violates constraint 7.

So to satisfy constraint 7, after the initial state (where blue is not clear), we must have grey_1 on blue at some point. So in this plan, grey_1 is never on blue. Thus, invalid.

Therefore, we need to include a step where grey_1 is stacked on blue.

So after step 5 (unstack black from blue, making blue clear), we can stack grey_1 on blue.

But grey_1 is on the table after step 4. So:

1. unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1 → hold grey_2
2. stack grey_block_2 red_block_1 → arm empty
3. unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1 → hold grey_1
4. putdown grey_block_1 → grey_1 on table
5. unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1 → hold black
6. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_1 → requires blue to be clear (which it is after step 5)
7. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1 → stack black on brown (brown is on yellow)
8. pickup grey_block_1 → hold grey_1 (goal)

Now, step 6 stacks grey_1 on blue. This satisfies constraint 7: after the initial state (blue not clear), grey_1 is stacked on blue in step 6. So whenever blue is not clear (initially and before step 5), we later have grey_1 on blue.

Now, check other constraints:

Constraint 3: in s0, yellow is not clear. By step 7, black is on brown (on yellow), so constraint is satisfied.

Constraint 5: when black becomes clear (after step 7, black is on brown and clear), there must be an earlier state where yellow is not on table or blue is clear. Blue is cleared in step 5, which is before step 7. So satisfied.

Constraint 7: grey_1 is on blue in step 6, satisfying the requirement.

Constraint 9: the initial state has blue not on brown, and in the plan, blue is never on brown. So the constraint that "blue is not on brown" is always true. The implication is that whenever this is true (which is always), either black is not on blue or red is not clear. After step 5, black is moved from blue. So after step 5, black is not on blue. So in all states after step 5, the condition holds. But before step 5, black is on blue, and red is clear (steps 0-4). So in those states, the implication requires that either black is not on blue (which it is) or red is not clear (which it is). So in steps 0-4, blue is not on brown, and in those states, black is on blue and red is clear. This violates the implication. So the plan is invalid.

Thus, we need to ensure that whenever blue is not on brown (which is always), either black is not on blue or red is not clear.

In steps 0-4: blue is not on brown, black is on blue, red is clear. So this violates the implication. To fix this, we need to either move black off blue or put something on red before step 5.

So let's adjust the plan:

Add a step after step 2 to put something on red. But step 2 already stacks grey_2 on red. So red is not clear after step 2. So in steps after step 2, red has grey_2 on top, so red is not clear. Therefore, the implication is satisfied because when blue is not on brown (all the time), in steps after step 2, red is not clear. So the condition is satisfied.

Wait, let's see:

The implication is: if blue is not on brown in state s, then in s or later, either black is not on blue or red is not clear.

In steps 0-2:

- s0: blue not on brown, black on blue, red clear → violates implication.
- s1: blue not on brown, black on blue, red clear → violates.
- s2: after stacking grey_2 on red, red is not clear. So in s2, blue is not on brown, black is on blue, but red is not clear. So the condition holds (red is not clear), so implication is satisfied.

So in s0 and s1, the implication is violated. Because in those states, blue is not on brown, black is on blue, and red is clear. But the plan must satisfy all constraints in every state. Therefore, this is a problem.

Thus, we need to ensure that in s0 and s1, the implication is satisfied. But in s0 and s1, red is clear. So we need to either move black off blue or make red not clear before s0 and s1. But we can't change the initial state. Therefore, we need to make red not clear as soon as possible.

So step 2 is stacking grey_2 on red. So after step 2, red is not clear. Therefore, from step 2 onwards, the implication is satisfied. But s0 and s1 are before step 2, so the implication is violated there.

Thus, this plan is invalid.

Therefore, the only way to satisfy constraint 9 is to have red not clear in the initial state. But red is initially clear. So the plan must make red not clear as soon as possible. The earliest step is step 2.

So the implication is violated in s0 and s1, but satisfied from step 2 onwards. But the problem requires that the plan satisfies all constraints in every state. Therefore, the plan is invalid.

This suggests that the problem is very restrictive and requires a specific order of actions.

Alternative approach: stack grey_2 on red early to satisfy constraint 9.

But the initial state violates constraint 9. Because blue is not on brown, and in the initial state, black is on blue and red is clear. So the implication is violated. Therefore, the initial state itself is invalid, but the problem states that the initial state is given. This suggests that the constraints apply to the plan, not the initial state. Wait, the problem says the constraints must hold in every state of the plan. Or does it include the initial state?

The problem says: "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints: ... The following expression must hold in every state: "grey_block_2 is not on the table" ..."

So the constraints apply to every state of the plan, including the initial state. But the initial state has grey_block_2 on grey_block_1, which is not on the table. So that's okay. But for constraint 9: "If expression "blue_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1" holds in some state s, then expression "At least one of the following conditions is true: "black_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1", "there is a block on top of red_block_1, i.e., red_block_1 is not clear"" must hold at s or at some state after s".

In the initial state, blue is not on brown, and in the initial state, black is on blue and red is clear. So in the initial state, the implication requires that either black is not on blue or red is not clear, in the initial state or later. Since in the initial state, both conditions are false, we need to have in some state after the initial state either black not on blue or red not clear.

In the plan we're considering, step 2 stacks grey_2 on red, making red not clear. So in step 2, red is not clear, satisfying the implication for all states after step 2. For the initial state, the implication is satisfied because in step 2, red becomes not clear, which is after the initial state. Therefore, the implication is satisfied for the initial state: in s0, blue is not on brown, and in a later state (s2), red is not clear.

Thus, the plan is valid as long as the implication is satisfied in all states s: if s satisfies blue not on brown, then in s or later, black is not on blue or red is not clear.

So for s0 (initial state), the implication is satisfied because in s2, red becomes not clear. So s0's implication is satisfied by s2.

For s1 (after step 1, grey_2 is held), blue is not on brown, black is on blue, red is clear. So the implication requires that in s1 or later, either black is not on blue or red is not clear. In s2, red is not clear. So s1's implication is satisfied by s2.

Similarly, for s2, blue is not on brown, but red is not clear. So implication is satisfied.

Therefore, the plan is valid with respect to constraint 9.

So the previous plan is acceptable.

Thus, the plan steps are:

1. unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1
2. stack grey_block_2 red_block_1
3. unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1
4. putdown grey_block_1
5. unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1
6. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1
7. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
8. pickup grey_block_1

But wait, step 6 requires that brown is clear. Initially, brown is on yellow. So to stack black on brown, brown must be clear. Therefore, we need to unstack brown from yellow first.

So adjusted plan:

1. unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1
2. stack grey_block_2 red_block_1
3. unstack brown_block_1 from yellow_block_1
4. stack brown_block_1 red_block_1 (but red already has grey_2)
   Or putdown brown.
   Wait, after step 3, brown is held. We need to put it somewhere clear.

3. unstack brown_block_1 from yellow_block_1 → hold brown
4. putdown brown_block_1 → brown on table
5. unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1 → hold grey_2
6. stack grey_block_2 red_block_1 → arm empty
7. unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1 → hold grey_1
8. putdown grey_block_1 → grey_1 on table
9. unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1 → hold black
10. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1 → arm empty
11. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_1 → arm empty
12. pickup grey_block_1 → hold grey_1 (goal)

But this is 12 steps, which is not optimal.

Alternatively, after step 3 (unstack brown), stack it somewhere else to free up yellow.

But this is getting too lengthy. Let's try to find the minimal steps.

Final answer: After carefully considering all constraints and the necessary steps to satisfy them, the optimal plan is:

```
unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
stack grey_block_2 red_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1
unstack black_block_1 blue_block_1
stack black_block_1 brown_block_1
stack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
pickup grey_block_1
```

But let's verify each step:

1. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1: Preconditions met (grey_2 is on grey_1, clear, arm empty).
2. stack grey_block_2 red_block_1: red is clear, arm holds grey_2. After stacking, red is not clear.
3. unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1: grey_1 is on black, clear, arm empty.
4. unstack black_block_1 blue_block_1: black is on blue, clear, arm empty.
5. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1: brown must be clear. Initially, brown is on yellow, but after step 3, we haven't moved brown. So this step is invalid because brown is on yellow, not clear.

Thus, this plan is invalid. Therefore, the correct steps must include moving brown first.

Final correct plan:

1. unstack brown_block_1 yellow_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
4. stack grey_block_2 red_block_1
5. unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1
6. unstack black_block_1 blue_block_1
7. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1
8. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
9. pickup grey_block_1

This plan has 9 steps. Let's check each constraint:

- grey_2 is never on the table (steps 3-4).
- yellow has brown on top initially (step 0), then step 1 removes it. But constraint 2 requires at least once yellow is not clear, which is satisfied in step 0.
- For constraint 3: initial state (yellow not clear) requires black on brown or held. Step 7 satisfies this.
- constraint 4: black is clear in step 6 (after unstacking from blue) and step 7 (stacked on brown).
- constraint 5: when black is clear in step 6, earlier state step 5 has blue clear (after step 6 unstack black from blue), but actually step 5 is unstacking grey_1 from black, making black clear. Then step 6 unstacking black from blue makes blue clear. So prior to black being clear in step 6, step 6 makes blue clear. So constraint 5 is satisfied.
- constraint 6: blue is not clear in step 0-6.
- constraint 7: whenever blue is not clear (steps 0-6), grey_1 is stacked on blue in step 8.
- constraint 8: blue is not on brown (always true).
- constraint 9: after step 4, red is not clear (has grey_2). So whenever blue is not on brown (always), in steps after step 4, red is not clear. So satisfies the implication.

But this is a 9-step plan. However, the problem asks for an optimal plan with minimal steps. Given the constraints, I think this is the minimal possible.
