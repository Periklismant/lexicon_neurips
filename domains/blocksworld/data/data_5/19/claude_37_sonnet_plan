1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1
2. Stack grey_block_2 on red_block_1
3. Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1 (blue_block_1 is clear, which satisfies constraint 5)
4. Stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1 (constraint 3 is satisfied)
5. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1 (since it's on top of black_block_1 in the initial state)
6. Stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_1 (constraint 7 is satisfied)
7. Unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1 (grey_block_1 is held, which is our goal)
