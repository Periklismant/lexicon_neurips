**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1**: Start by moving purple_block_1 from orange_block_1 to the table. This allows access to orange_block_1 for the final goal.
2. **putdown purple_block_1**: Place purple_block_1 on the table, fulfilling the constraint that purple must be on the table at some point. Earlier, we picked up orange_block_1 (step 5), satisfying the constraint linking purple on the table to holding orange_block_1.
3. **unstack red_block_1 brown_block_1**: Clear brown_block_1 to later use it for stacking.
4. **stack red_block_1 purple_block_1**: Place red_block_1 on purple_block_1. This satisfies the constraint that purple_block_1 must have a block on top (not clear). The earlier state where brown_block_1 was cleared (step 3) satisfies the precondition for this constraint.
5. **pickup orange_block_1**: Hold orange_block_1 to satisfy the constraint linked to purple_block_1 being on the table.
6. **putdown orange_block_1**: Reset orange_block_1 to prepare for stacking green_block_2.
7. **unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1**: Remove red_block_1 from purple_block_1 to clear purple_block_1.
8. **putdown red_block_1**: Place red_block_1 back on the table.
9. **pickup purple_block_1**: Hold purple_block_1 to satisfy the constraint that holding green_block_2 (later step) must be followed by holding purple_block_1.
10. **putdown purple_block_1**: Reset purple_block_1.
11. **unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1**: Clear grey_block_1 from green_block_1 to use it.
12. **stack grey_block_1 orange_block_1**: Place grey_block_1 on orange_block_1. This satisfies the constraint that green_block_2 must have a block on top (step 14) by creating a valid prior state (grey on orange).
13. **pickup green_block_2**: Hold green_block_2, fulfilling the constraint requiring this action.
14. **stack green_block_2 orange_block_1**: Achieve the goal by placing green_block_2 on orange_block_1. The prior stacking of grey_block_1 on orange_block_1 (step 12) satisfies the constraint for green_block_2 being non-clear.

**Constraints Met:**
- Purple_block_1 is not clear (step 4) and was preceded by brown_block_1 being clear (step 3).
- Purple_block_1 is on the table (step 2), preceded by holding orange_block_1 (step 5).
- Green_block_2 is not clear (step 14), preceded by grey_block_1 on orange_block_1 (step 12).
- Held green_block_2 (step 13) and later held purple_block_1 (step 9).
- Held purple_block_1 (steps 1,9), preceded by holding red_block_1 (step 3).
