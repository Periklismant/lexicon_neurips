Okay, let's try to figure out how to get red_block_2 onto the table. So, the initial state is a bit complicated. Let me first visualize the blocks. 

Starting from the table, black_block_1 has white_block_1 on top, which in turn has black_block_2. So, black_block_1 -> white_block_1 -> black_block_2. On the other side, red_block_1 has white_block_2, which has red_block_2, and then orange_block_1 on top. So, red_block_1 -> white_block_2 -> red_block_2 -> orange_block_1. Both black_block_2 and orange_block_1 are clear, meaning nothing is on top of them. And the robot isn't holding anything.

The goal is to have red_block_2 on the table. Currently, red_block_2 is on top of white_block_2, under orange_block_1. To move red_block_2 to the table, I need to first remove whatever is on top of it. But wait, red_block_2 is under orange_block_1. So, orange_block_1 is on top of red_block_2. That means I can't pick up red_block_2 directly because there's a block (orange_block_1) on top of it. So, I need to unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2 first.

But to unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2, the preconditions are: orange_block_1 is on red_block_2, orange_block_1 is clear (which it is), and the robot isn't holding anything (which it isn't). So, I can perform unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2. That would leave red_block_2 clear. Then, I can pick up red_block_2 and put it down on the table. But wait, after unstacking orange_block_1, the robot is holding it. So, after unstacking, I need to put down orange_block_1 somewhere before I can handle red_block_2.

Wait, the steps would be:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. Now, the robot is holding orange_block_1, and red_block_2 is clear.
2. Put down orange_block_1 on the table. Now, orange_block_1 is on the table, clear, and the robot is free.
3. Now, red_block_2 is clear. So I can pick it up. Wait, but red_block_2 is on top of white_block_2. To pick it up, I need to do unstack red_block_2 white_block_2. Wait, because pickup can only be used if the block is on the table. Since red_block_2 is on white_block_2, I have to unstack it. Oh right, because "pickup" is only for blocks on the table. So if a block is on another block, you have to unstack it.

Wait, the actions are "pickup x" (only if x is on table) and "unstack x y" (if x is on y). So for red_block_2, which is on white_block_2, I need to unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. But after moving orange_block_1, red_block_2 is clear. So the steps would be:

After step 2 (putting orange_block_1 down), red_block_2 is on white_block_2 and clear. So unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. Wait, but unstack requires that the robot is not holding anything, which it is after putting down orange_block_1. So step 3 would be unstack red_block_2 white_block_2. Then, the robot is holding red_block_2. Then, put it down on the table with putdown red_block_2. That would achieve the goal.

Wait, but let's check the preconditions again. For unstack red_block_2 white_block_2: red_block_2 is on white_block_2, red_block_2 is clear (since we removed orange_block_1), and the robot isn't holding anything. Yes, that's valid. Then, after unstacking, the robot holds red_block_2, so then putdown red_block_2. That's possible.

So the plan would be:

unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2
putdown orange_block_1
unstack red_block_2 white_block_2
putdown red_block_2

But wait, let's verify each step's preconditions and effects.

Original state:

- black_block_1 on table, with white_block_1 on it, then black_block_2.
- red_block_1 on table, with white_block_2 on it, then red_block_2, then orange_block_1.

Step 1: unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2.

Preconditions: orange_block_1 is on red_block_2, clear, and robot is empty. Yes. After unstacking, robot holds orange_block_1, red_block_2 becomes clear.

Step 2: putdown orange_block_1. Now orange_block_1 is on table, robot is empty.

Step 3: unstack red_block_2 white_block_2. red_block_2 is on white_block_2, which is on red_block_1. red_block_2 is clear (since we removed orange_block_1), and robot is empty. So yes. After unstacking, robot holds red_block_2, and white_block_2 becomes clear.

Step 4: putdown red_block_2. Then red_block_2 is on table, clear, and robot is empty. That's the goal.

So that's four steps. Is there a shorter way? Let's see. Is there a way to do it in fewer steps? Let's think. Suppose instead of putting down orange_block_1, could we stack it somewhere else? But the goal only requires red_block_2 to be on the table. So maybe no. But let's see.

Alternative approach: After unstacking orange_block_1, instead of putting it down, maybe stack it onto another block. But then we need to have a clear block. For example, stack orange_block_1 onto black_block_2, which is clear. Then, after that, we can unstack red_block_2. But that would require:

1. unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2
2. stack orange_block_1 black_block_2
3. unstack red_block_2 white_block_2
4. putdown red_block_2

That's still four steps. So same length. But in this case, is stacking possible? Let's check step 2's preconditions. To stack orange_block_1 onto black_block_2, we need to be holding orange_block_1 (yes, after unstack), and black_block_2 must be clear (yes). So stacking would work. Then, after stacking, black_block_2 is not clear anymore. But that's okay. Then step 3: unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. Then step 4: putdown. So same number of steps. So whether you putdown orange_block_1 or stack it, the number of steps is the same. So both plans are optimal.

But the problem says to provide an optimal plan, so either way is acceptable. But maybe the first plan (putdown) is better because stacking requires an extra block, but in terms of steps, same length.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to do it in three steps? Let's think. For example, can we unstack red_block_2 without first moving orange_block_1? But orange_block_1 is on top of red_block_2. So red_block_2 isn't clear. So we can't unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2 until we remove orange_block_1. So the first two steps are necessary. Then, unstack red_block_2 and putdown. So no, it's four steps.

So the minimal plan is four actions. So the correct answer is the sequence: unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2, putdown orange_block_1, unstack red_block_2 white_block_2, putdown red_block_2.
