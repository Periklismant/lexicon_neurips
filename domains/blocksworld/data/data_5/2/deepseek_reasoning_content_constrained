Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this Blocksworld problem. The goal is to get red_block_2 on the table, but there are a bunch of constraints we have to satisfy along the way. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the goal.

In the initial state, there are several blocks arranged in towers. Let me list them out:

- black_block_1 is on the table, with white_block_1 on top of it, and then black_block_2 on top of white_block_1. Black_block_2 is clear.
- red_block_1 is on the table, with white_block_2 on top, then red_block_2, and finally orange_block_1. Orange_block_1 is clear.

The goal is to have red_block_2 on the table. So, red_block_2 is currently on top of white_block_2, which is on red_block_1. To get red_block_2 on the table, we need to move it down. But orange_block_1 is on top of red_block_2, so we can't just unstack red_block_2 yet. We need to first remove orange_block_1.

Constraints:

1. At some point, orange_block_1 must be on the table. And if that happens, there must have been a prior state where either red_block_1 was clear or we were holding white_block_2.
2. At some point, red_block_1 must have a block on top (i.e., not clear). If that happens, then in that state or a later one, we must be holding white_block_2 and black_block_2 is on the table.
3. At some point, red_block_1 is on top of white_block_1. Wait, red_block_1 is initially on the table. So we need to stack red_block_1 onto white_block_1 at some point.
4. We must hold orange_block_1 at some state, and when we do, white_block_1 must be clear either at that state or after.
5. At some point, white_block_2 must be clear. And if that happens, there must have been an earlier state where orange_block_1 was on white_block_1.

This is a lot. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the main goal is to get red_block_2 on the table. Let's see the initial stack for red_block_2: red_block_1 has white_block_2, then red_block_2, then orange_block_1. So to get red_block_2 down, we need to unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2 first. Then unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2, then put it down.

But let's check constraints. One of them requires that orange_block_1 is on the table at some point. So moving orange_block_1 to the table is necessary. Also, when we do that, the constraint says that before that, either red_block_1 was clear or we were holding white_block_2. Let's see: initially, red_block_1 has white_block_2 on it, so it's not clear. So to satisfy the first part of the constraint, if we put orange_block_1 on the table, we need to ensure that prior to that, either red_block_1 was clear (which it isn't until we remove white_block_2) or we were holding white_block_2. So perhaps when we unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2, we need to first unstack red_block_2, but wait, red_block_2 is under orange_block_1. So we need to unstack orange_block_1 first. Let's see:

To unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2, since orange_block_1 is clear, the robotic arm can pick it up. So action: unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2. Then put it down. But when we unstack orange_block_1, we are holding it. Then putting it down. So that would satisfy the constraint that orange_block_1 is on the table. But according to constraint 1, when we do that, we need in a prior state that either red_block_1 was clear or we were holding white_block_2. At the time we unstack orange_block_1, red_block_1 is not clear (since white_block_2 is on it). So the prior state must have us holding white_block_2. But how?

Wait, the initial state has white_block_2 under red_block_2. So to hold white_block_2, we need to unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. But red_block_2 has orange_block_1 on top. So we can't unstack red_block_2 until orange_block_1 is moved. So first, unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. Then, unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2, then put red_block_2 down. But putting red_block_2 down would achieve the goal. But maybe we need to handle the constraints.

But let's go step by step. Let's outline the steps to get red_block_2 on the table:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. (This requires that orange_block_1 is clear, which it is. The arm is empty. So preconditions are met.)
   - After unstacking, we are holding orange_block_1, red_block_2 is now clear.
   - Then putdown orange_block_1. Now orange_block_1 is on the table, which satisfies constraint 1 (since it's on the table at some state). Now, when we putdown orange_block_1, the prior state (before that action) had us holding it. But constraint 1 requires that before orange_block_1 is on the table, there was a state where either red_block_1 was clear or we were holding white_block_2. At the time of putting down orange_block_1, the prior action was unstacking it, which required holding it. So during the unstack action, we were holding orange_block_1, but that's not white_block_2. So the prior state (before putting down orange_block_1) doesn't meet the condition. Therefore, this approach may not satisfy constraint 1.

Wait, constraint 1 says that if in some state, orange is on the table, then there must be an earlier state where either red_block_1 is clear or holding white_block_2. So putting orange on the table (putdown orange_block_1) is the state where orange is on the table. The earlier state would be the state after unstacking, where we are holding orange. But in that case, the earlier state (before putdown) doesn't have red_block_1 clear or holding white_block_2. So this approach might not satisfy the constraint. Therefore, we need to make sure that before putting orange on the table, either red_block_1 is clear (which requires moving white_block_2) or we are holding white_block_2.

Hmm. So perhaps the steps need to be adjusted. Let's think: to satisfy constraint 1, when we put orange on the table, there must have been an earlier state where either red_block_1 was clear or we were holding white_block_2.

In the initial state, red_block_1 has white_block_2 on it. So red_block_1 is not clear. So if we can hold white_block_2 before putting orange on the table, then that would satisfy the condition. But white_block_2 is under red_block_2 and orange_block_1. So to get to white_block_2, we need to unstack red_block_2 and then unstack white_block_2. But red_block_2 is under orange_block_1. So first, unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2, then unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2, then unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. But that's a lot. Let's see:

Wait, but maybe we can do it another way. Suppose after moving orange_block_1, we unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2 and put it down. Then, we can unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. But then red_block_1 would be clear, which might help with the constraint. Let's see:

But let's think again. Suppose we first unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. Then, we put it down. But to satisfy constraint 1, before putting orange on the table, we need to have either red_block_1 clear or hold white_block_2. At the time we put down orange, the prior action was unstacking it, so we were holding orange, not white_block_2. And red_block_1 was still covered by white_block_2. So that doesn't satisfy the condition. Therefore, this approach is invalid.

Alternative approach: Before putting orange on the table, make sure we have a state where we are holding white_block_2. But how? To hold white_block_2, we need to unstack it from red_block_1. But white_block_2 is under red_block_2 and orange_block_1. So we need to first remove the blocks above it. So the order would be:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. Now holding orange.
2. Putdown orange_block_1. Now orange is on the table. But this is the state that requires prior condition. However, prior to this, we were holding orange, not white_block_2. So this doesn't satisfy constraint 1. So this is a problem.

Alternative plan: Instead of putting orange down immediately, perhaps stack it somewhere else. But to stack, we need a clear target block. Let's see:

After unstacking orange_block_1, we can stack it on another block. For example, stack it onto black_block_2, which is currently on white_block_1. But black_block_2 is clear. So stack orange_block_1 onto black_block_2. Then, we can unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. Then putdown red_block_2. But this way, when we stack orange_block_1 onto black_block_2, we are not putting it on the table yet. So constraint 1 (orange on table) is not satisfied here. So we need to eventually put orange on the table.

Alternatively, maybe stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1. Let's see:

After unstacking orange_block_1, stack it onto white_block_1. But white_block_1 is under black_block_2. Wait, white_block_1 is under black_block_2, which is clear. So to stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1, we need to unstack black_block_2 first. Because white_block_1 has black_block_2 on top. So white_block_1 is not clear. So we can't stack on it unless we remove black_block_2. So maybe:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from white_block_1. (Because black_block_2 is clear.) Now holding black_block_2.
2. Putdown black_block_2. Now black_block_2 is on the table. This might help with some constraints. For example, constraint 2 requires that if red_block_1 is not clear (has a block on top) then at that state or later, we are holding white_block_2 and black_block_2 is on the table. So putting black_block_2 on the table satisfies part of that.

Then, stack orange_block_1 onto white_block_1. But wait, after unstacking black_block_2, white_block_1 is clear. So:

3. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. Now holding orange.
4. Stack orange_block_1 onto white_block_1. Now, white_block_1 has orange_block_1 on top, but orange_block_1 was stacked, so white_block_1 is not clear anymore. However, this might help with constraint 5: "if white_block_2 is clear at some state, then there must have been a prior state where orange_block_1 is on white_block_1". But I'm not sure yet. Let's proceed.

Now, after stacking orange_block_1 on white_block_1, we can then unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. But white_block_2 is under red_block_2, which is now clear (since orange_block_1 was moved). Wait, red_block_2 was under orange_block_1. After moving orange_block_1, red_block_2 is clear. So:

5. Unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. Now holding red_block_2.
6. Putdown red_block_2. Now red_block_2 is on the table. This achieves the goal.

But wait, let's check constraints:

- Constraint 1: orange_block_1 must be on the table at some state. In this plan, we stacked orange_block_1 onto white_block_1, so it's not on the table. So that violates constraint 1. Therefore, we need to put orange_block_1 on the table at some point.

So perhaps after stacking orange_block_1 on white_block_1, we need to move it again. Let's adjust:

After step 4 (stack orange on white_block_1), then:

5. Unstack orange_block_1 from white_block_1. Now holding orange.
6. Putdown orange_block_1. Now it's on the table. Now, constraint 1 is satisfied. When we putdown orange, the prior state was holding it. But to satisfy the condition that before orange is on the table, either red_block_1 was clear or we held white_block_2. At this point, red_block_1 still has white_block_2 on it (since we haven't moved white_block_2 yet). So red_block_1 is not clear. So we need to have held white_block_2 before this putdown. But in this plan, we haven't done that yet. So this approach still doesn't meet constraint 1.

So maybe after putting black_block_2 down, we need to unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. But white_block_2 has red_block_2 on top. So we need to first unstack red_block_2. But red_block_2 is under orange_block_1. So:

Alternative plan steps:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. Hold orange.
2. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_2 (which is on white_block_1). Wait, but black_block_2 is on white_block_1. So to stack on black_block_2, it must be clear. Currently, black_block_2 is clear. So:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. Hold orange.
2. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_2. Now, black_block_2 has orange_block_1 on it. Now, red_block_2 is clear.
3. Unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. Hold red_block_2.
4. Putdown red_block_2. Goal achieved. But now, we need to handle constraints.

But again, orange_block_1 is not on the table here. So constraint 1 requires that at some point, orange is on the table. So this approach doesn't satisfy that. So we need to put orange on the table at some point.

Let's try another approach. Let's try to unstack orange_block_1, then unstack red_block_2, then put red_block_2 down, then put orange_block_1 down. But let's check the constraints:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. Hold orange.
2. Unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. Hold red_block_2.
3. Putdown red_block_2. Now, goal achieved. Then, putdown orange_block_1. Now orange is on the table.

But when we putdown orange_block_1, that's after putting red_block_2 down. Now, the constraint 1 says that when orange is on the table, there must have been a prior state where red_block_1 was clear or we held white_block_2. At the time of putting orange down, prior state was holding orange, and before that, we unstacked red_block_2. So in that prior state (before putting down orange), the steps were: after unstacking red_block_2, white_block_2 is now clear (since red_block_2 was removed). So during the unstacking of red_block_2, we had to hold it, and white_block_2 was clear. But the constraint requires that before putting orange on the table (step 4), there must have been a state where either red_block_1 was clear or we held white_block_2.

In this case, before step 4 (putdown orange), the prior step is step 3 (putdown red_block_2). Before that, step 2 (unstack red_block_2), which required that white_block_2 was clear. Wait, no. Wait, when you unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2, the precondition is that red_block_2 is on white_block_2 and red_block_2 is clear. In the initial state, red_block_2 is under orange_block_1, so it's not clear. So step 2 can't be done until we remove orange_block_1. Which step 1 does. So after step 1, red_block_2 is clear (since orange_block_1 was removed). So step 2: unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. Now holding red_block_2, put it down. Then step 4: putdown orange_block_1.

Now, when we putdown orange_block_1 (step 4), the prior state was holding it. To satisfy constraint 1, before this state, there must have been a state where red_block_1 was clear or we held white_block_2. But in this plan, red_block_1 is not clear until we move white_block_2. But white_block_2 is still on red_block_1. So red_block_1 is not clear. So we need to have held white_block_2 at some point before step 4.

So how can we hold white_block_2? It's under red_block_2 and initially under orange_block_1. So after step 1 (unstack orange), step 2 (unstack red_block_2), then we can unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. Let's adjust the plan:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. Hold orange.
2. Unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. Hold red_block_2.
3. Putdown red_block_2. (Goal achieved)
4. Unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. Now holding white_block_2.
5. Putdown white_block_2.
6. Putdown orange_block_1.

But in this case, when we putdown orange_block_1 (step 6), the prior state is holding it. The prior actions include steps 5 (putdown white_block_2), 4 (unstack white_block_2). So in step 4, we were holding white_block_2. That happens before step 6. So when we putdown orange in step 6, there was a prior state (step 4) where we held white_block_2. Thus, constraint 1 is satisfied.

So this plan might work. Let's check all constraints:

- Constraint 1: orange_block_1 is on the table in step 6. Prior to that, in step 4, we held white_block_2. So condition met.

- Constraint 2: There must be a state where red_block_1 is not clear. Initially, red_block_1 has white_block_2 on it. After step 4, we unstack white_block_2, so red_block_1 becomes clear. But the constraint requires that red_block_1 is not clear in at least one state. So in the initial state, it's not clear. So that's satisfied. Then, if red_block_1 is not clear (which it is initially and until step 4), then in that state or later, we must be holding white_block_2 and black_block_2 is on the table. Let's see: in the initial state, red_block_1 is not clear. Then, according to the constraint, at that state or later, we must have held white_block_2 and black_block_2 on table. Black_block_2 is initially on white_block_1, not on the table. So we need to put black_block_2 on the table. But in this plan, we haven't done that. So this would violate constraint 2.

Ah, right. So constraint 2 says that if red_block_1 is not clear (which it is initially and until step 4 when we unstack white_block_2), then in that state or a later one, we must be holding white_block_2 and black_block_2 is on the table. But in the initial state, black_block_2 is not on the table. So we need to ensure that when red_block_1 is not clear (which it is in the initial state and until step 4), either during that state or later, we must hold white_block_2 and have black_block_2 on the table.

In the initial state, red_block_1 is not clear (has white_block_2). So the constraint applies. Therefore, in the initial state or some state after, we must have held white_block_2 and black_block_2 is on the table. In the initial state, we are not holding white_block_2 and black_block_2 is not on the table. So we need to, at some point after, hold white_block_2 and have black_block_2 on the table.

In the current plan, step 4 is unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1, which requires that black_block_2 is on the table? No. Wait, black_block_2 is part of another tower. Initially, black_block_2 is on white_block_1, which is on black_block_1. So to unstack white_block_2, we don't need to do anything with black_block_2. But according to the plan, after step 4, we are holding white_block_2, and black_block_2 is still on white_block_1. So in step 4, when we unstack white_block_2, we are holding white_block_2, but black_block_2 is not on the table. So this violates constraint 2 because during the state when red_block_1 is not clear (before step 4), we need to have black_block_2 on the table at that state or later.

So to satisfy constraint 2, we need to ensure that whenever red_block_1 is not clear, which is until step 4, either during that time or after, we must hold white_block_2 and have black_block_2 on the table. So in this plan, when we hold white_block_2 (step 4), black_block_2 is not on the table. Therefore, we need to put black_block_2 on the table before or during the time we hold white_block_2.

So perhaps we need to unstack black_block_2 first. Let's adjust the plan:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from white_block_1. (It's clear, so possible.) Hold black_block_2.
2. Putdown black_block_2. Now black_block_2 is on the table.
3. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. Hold orange.
4. Unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. Hold red_block_2.
5. Putdown red_block_2. Goal achieved.
6. Unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. Hold white_block_2.
7. Putdown white_block_2.
8. Putdown orange_block_1.

Now, checking constraint 2: When red_block_1 is not clear (initially, and until step 6 when we unstack white_block_2), we need to have in that state or later that we hold white_block_2 and black_block_2 is on the table. After step 2, black_block_2 is on the table. When we unstack white_block_2 in step 6, we are holding white_block_2, and black_block_2 is on the table. So during step 6, the condition is satisfied. Thus, constraint 2 is met.

Other constraints:

Constraint 3: At some point, red_block_1 is on top of white_block_1. Currently, in the initial state, red_block_1 is on the table. So we need to stack red_block_1 onto white_block_1. But this plan doesn't include that. So we need to add that.

Constraint 3 requires that red_block_1 is on white_block_1 in some state. But red_block_1 starts on the table. So we need to stack it onto white_block_1. But white_block_1 is under black_block_2. Wait, initially, white_block_1 has black_block_2 on top. So to stack red_block_1 on white_block_1, we need white_block_1 to be clear. Which requires removing black_block_2. Which we did in step 1. So after step 1, white_block_1 is clear. Then, we could stack red_block_1 onto white_block_1. But red_block_1 is on the table. So:

After step 2 (putdown black_block_2), we can pick up red_block_1 (since it's on the table and clear). Then stack it onto white_block_1. But this would add steps:

3. Pickup red_block_1.
4. Stack red_block_1 white_block_1.

But then we need to manage the rest of the plan. Let's see:

But this complicates the plan. However, constraint 3 requires that red_block_1 is on white_block_1 at some state. So we need to include that.

But how? Let's adjust the plan to include stacking red_block_1 onto white_block_1:

Revised plan:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from white_block_1. Hold black_block_2.
2. Putdown black_block_2. Now on table.
3. Pickup red_block_1. (It's on the table and clear.)
4. Stack red_block_1 white_block_1. Now red_block_1 is on white_block_1. But white_block_1 was on black_block_1. So the tower becomes black_block_1, white_block_1, red_block_1. But we need to have red_block_1 on white_block_1. This satisfies constraint 3.

But now, red_block_1 is no longer on the table. But in the initial stack, red_block_1 was on the table with white_block_2. So after stacking red_block_1 on white_block_1, we need to handle the original tower. But this complicates things. Let's see the rest:

5. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. (But red_block_2 is on white_block_2, which is on red_block_1, but red_block_1 is now on white_block_1. Wait, no. Original stack for red_block_1: red_block_1 is on the table with white_block_2 on it. But after step 4, red_block_1 is on white_block_1, so the original tower (white_block_2 on red_block_1) would now be white_block_2 on top of red_block_1, which is on white_block_1. But this might not affect the other tower. Wait, no. The red_block_1 was moved, so the tower starting with red_block_1 (originally on the table) is now under white_block_2. So moving red_block_1 would leave white_block_2 on the table? No. Wait, no. If red_block_1 was on the table and we moved it, then white_block_2 was on red_block_1. So if red_block_1 is moved, white_block_2 would be on the table. Wait, no. If you stack red_block_1 on white_block_1, then white_block_2 is still on red_block_1. So red_block_1 is now on white_block_1, and white_block_2 is on top of red_block_1. So the tower for red_block_1 is now red_block_1 on white_block_1, with white_block_2 on top, then red_block_2, then orange_block_1. So this complicates things.

But perhaps we need to do this to satisfy constraint 3. But this makes the plan more complex. Let's see if there's another way. Maybe we can stack red_block_1 onto white_block_1 and then unstack it later. But this might add unnecessary steps. Alternatively, maybe after moving black_block_2, we can stack red_block_1 onto white_block_1, and then later unstack it again. Let's proceed step by step.

After step 4 (stack red_block_1 onto white_block_1), we have:

- black_block_1 on table, white_block_1 on it, red_block_1 on white_block_1.
- white_block_2 on red_block_1 (since originally white_block_2 was on red_block_1 when red_block_1 was on the table). Wait, no. When red_block_1 is stacked on white_block_1, the white_block_2 that was on red_block_1 is now on top of red_block_1 which is on white_block_1. So the tower is white_block_2 on red_block_1 on white_block_1 on black_block_1. Then, red_block_2 is on white_block_2, and orange_block_1 is on red_block_2.

So to get to red_block_2, we still need to unstack orange_block_1 and red_block_2. But now, the tower is taller. This could complicate the plan. But perhaps necessary to satisfy constraint 3.

Continuing the plan:

5. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. Hold orange.
6. Unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. Hold red_block_2.
7. Putdown red_block_2. Goal achieved.
8. Unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. Hold white_block_2.
9. Putdown white_block_2.
10. Putdown orange_block_1.

But now, we need to check constraints again.

Constraint 3 is satisfied because in step 4, red_block_1 is stacked on white_block_1.

Constraint 4: At some point, you are holding orange_block_1. Yes, step 5.

When you are holding orange_block_1 (step 5), in that state or after, white_block_1 must be clear. But white_block_1 has red_block_1 on it. So after step 5, white_block_1 is not clear. So we need to clear it. How? After step 5, maybe unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1. But red_block_1 has white_block_2 on top. So we need to first unstack white_block_2. Which is done in step 8. After step 8, white_block_2 is unstacked from red_block_1, so red_block_1 is clear. So then we can unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1. But this is additional steps:

11. Unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1. Hold red_block_1.
12. Putdown red_block_1.

Now, after step 12, white_block_1 is clear. So when we hold orange_block_1 in step 5, the state after step 12 has white_block_1 clear. So constraint 4 is satisfied.

But this adds more steps. However, the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). So perhaps there's a way to satisfy constraint 4 without these additional steps.

Wait, constraint 4 says: if you are holding orange_block_1 in state s, then white_block_1 must be clear at s or after. So when we hold orange in step 5, during that state, white_block_1 is not clear (has red_block_1 on it). So we need to have a state after step 5 where white_block_1 is clear. Which would require removing red_block_1 from white_block_1, which would require unstacking red_block_1, but red_block_1 has white_block_2 on it. So we need to unstack white_block_2 first (step 8), then unstack red_block_1. So after step 8, white_block_2 is put down (step 9), then unstack red_block_1 (step 11), putdown (step 12). Then, white_block_1 is clear. So in step 12, white_block_1 is clear, which is after step 5. So constraint 4 is satisfied.

But this adds steps. However, this might be necessary.

Constraint 5: At some state, white_block_2 is clear. In the initial state, white_block_2 is under red_block_2 and orange_block_1, so not clear. After step 6 (unstack red_block_2), white_block_2 is clear. So step 6: white_block_2 is clear. So constraint 5 is satisfied. Now, according to constraint 5, if white_block_2 is clear in some state, there must have been a prior state where orange_block_1 was on white_block_1. In this plan, orange_block_1 is moved in step 5 to be held, then putdown in step 10. But there's no state where orange_block_1 is on white_block_1. So this violates constraint 5.

Ah, right. Constraint 5 says that if white_block_2 is clear in some state (like step 6), then there must have been a prior state where orange_block_1 was on white_block_1. But in the current plan, orange_block_1 was only on red_block_2 initially, then held, then putdown. So to satisfy this, we need to have orange_block_1 on white_block_1 at some point before white_block_2 becomes clear.

So perhaps after unstacking orange_block_1 (step 5), we stack it onto white_block_1. Let's adjust:

5. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. Hold orange.
6. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1. Now, white_block_1 has red_block_1 and orange_block_1? Wait, no. white_block_1 has red_block_1 on top, which is stacked in step 4. So to stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1, we need white_block_1 to be clear. But red_block_1 is on white_block_1. So we can't stack orange_block_1 there unless we move red_block_1. So this approach won't work.

Alternative idea: stack orange_block_1 on black_block_2, which is on the table after step 2. Then, later unstack it.

5. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. Hold orange.
6. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_2. Now, black_block_2 is on the table and clear. After stacking, black_block_2 has orange_block_1. Then, unstack red_block_2 (step 7), etc.

But then, when white_block_2 becomes clear (step 7), there must have been a prior state where orange_block_1 was on white_block_1. But orange_block_1 is on black_block_2, not white_block_1. So this doesn't satisfy constraint 5.

Hmm. To satisfy constraint 5, we need that before white_block_2 becomes clear (step 7), there was a state where orange_block_1 was on white_block_1. But how? The only way is to move orange_block_1 to white_block_1 before step 7.

But to do that, after step 4 (stacking red_block_1 on white_block_1), we need to unstack red_block_1 to clear white_block_1, but red_block_1 has white_block_2 on top. So:

Alternative plan:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from white_block_1. Hold black_block_2.
2. Putdown black_block_2.
3. Unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. (But red_block_1 has white_block_2 on top. Wait, initially, red_block_1 is on the table with white_block_2 on it. But in the initial state, red_block_1 is on the table, and white_block_2 is on it. So to unstack white_block_2, we need to have nothing on top of it. But white_block_2 has red_block_2 and orange_block_1. So we can't unstack white_block_2 until we remove red_block_2 and orange_block_1.

This is getting too complicated. Let's think differently.

Perhaps the optimal plan is longer than expected, but given the constraints, we have to include certain steps.

Let me try to outline the necessary steps to meet all constraints:

1. Move orange_block_1 to the table, but ensure that before that, we either held white_block_2 or red_block_1 was clear.

2. Ensure that when red_block_1 is not clear, we hold white_block_2 and black_block_2 is on the table.

3. Have red_block_1 on white_block_1 at some point.

4. Hold orange_block_1 and then ensure white_block_1 is clear later.

5. Have white_block_2 clear at some point, which requires that orange_block_1 was on white_block_1 before.

So let's try a step-by-step plan:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from white_block_1. Now holding black_block_2.
   - Preconditions: black_block_2 is clear (yes), arm is empty (yes).
   - Effect: black_block_2 is held, white_block_1 is clear.

2. Putdown black_block_2. Now it's on the table.

3. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. Hold orange.
   - Pre: orange is clear, arm is empty.

4. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1. Now, white_block_1 has orange_block_1.
   - Pre: holding orange, white_block_1 is clear (yes after step 1).
   - Effect: orange is on white_block_1, white_block_1 not clear.

5. Unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. Hold red_block_2.
   - Pre: red_block_2 is clear (yes after step 3), arm is empty (after step 4, arm is empty).

6. Putdown red_block_2. Goal achieved.

Now, check constraints:

- Constraint 1: orange_block_1 must be on the table. In this plan, it's stacked on white_block_1, so not on the table. So need to adjust.

So perhaps after step 4, we need to unstack orange_block_1 and put it down.

5. Unstack orange_block_1 from white_block_1. Hold orange.
6. Putdown orange_block_1. Now it's on the table.
7. Unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. Hold red_block_2.
8. Putdown red_block_2.

Now, constraint 1 is satisfied (step 6). Before step 6, we held orange_block_1 (step 5), but we need to check if before step 6, there was a state where either red_block_1 was clear or we held white_block_2. 

At step 6, prior state is step 5 (unstack orange_block_1). Before that, step 4 (stack orange on white_block_1). In step 4, after stacking, red_block_1 is still on the table with white_block_2 on it (since we haven't moved red_block_1 yet). So red_block_1 is not clear. And we didn't hold white_block_2 yet. So this violates constraint 1.

Therefore, we need to hold white_block_2 before putting orange on the table.

So after step 4 (stack orange on white_block_1), we can unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. But white_block_2 is under red_block_2. So we need to first unstack red_block_2.

But red_block_2 is now on white_block_2, which is on red_block_1. But after step 3, we unstacked orange_block_1, which makes red_block_2 clear. So steps:

5. Unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. Hold red_block_2.
6. Putdown red_block_2. Goal achieved.
7. Unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. Hold white_block_2.
8. Putdown white_block_2.
9. Unstack orange_block_1 from white_block_1. Hold orange.
10. Putdown orange_block_1.

Now, constraint 1: step 10 puts orange on table. Before that, in step 7, we held white_block_2. So condition met.

Constraint 2: When red_block_1 is not clear (initially, until step 7), in step 7 we hold white_block_2 and black_block_2 is on the table (step 2). So condition met.

Constraint 3: red_block_1 is on white_block_1? No, in this plan, red_block_1 is still on the table. So this is not met. So need to stack red_block_1 on white_block_1.

Adjust the plan to include that:

After step 2:

3. Pickup red_block_1. (It's on the table and clear.)
4. Stack red_block_1 white_block_1. Now, red_block_1 is on white_block_1.
5. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. Hold orange.
6. Stack orange_block_1 on red_block_1. (Assuming red_block_1 is clear after stacking.)
   - Pre: holding orange, red_block_1 is clear (yes, after stacking red_block_1 on white_block_1, nothing is on it until this step).
   - Now, red_block_1 has orange_block_1.
7. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_1. Hold orange.
8. Putdown orange_block_1.
9. Unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. Hold red_block_2.
10. Putdown red_block_2.
11. Unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. Hold white_block_2.
12. Putdown white_block_2.

Now, checking constraints:

- Constraint 3: step 4, red_block_1 is on white_block_1. Satisfied.

- Constraint 5: white_block_2 is clear in step 9 after unstacking red_block_2. Before that, in step 6, orange_block_1 was on red_block_1 (which is on white_block_1). So to satisfy constraint 5: before white_block_2 is clear (step 9), there must have been a state where orange_block_1 was on white_block_1. But in this plan, orange_block_1 was on red_block_1, which is on white_block_1. So technically, orange_block_1 is on top of red_block_1, which is on white_block_1. So is that considered "orange_block_1 is on white_block_1"? No, because it's on red_block_1. So this doesn't satisfy constraint 5.

This is getting extremely complicated. Given the time constraints, perhaps the optimal plan requires moving orange_block_1 to white_block_1 at some point.

Let me try to outline the correct plan with all constraints satisfied:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from white_block_1.
2. Putdown black_block_2.
3. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2.
4. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1. (Now orange is on white_block_1.)
5. Unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2.
6. Putdown red_block_2. (Goal achieved)
7. Unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1.
8. Putdown white_block_2.
9. Unstack orange_block_1 from white_block_1.
10. Putdown orange_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 1)
11. Pickup red_block_1. (To stack on white_block_1 for constraint 3)
12. Stack red_block_1 white_block_1.

But this is getting too long. However, this plan satisfies:

- orange_block_1 on table (step 10).
- Before step 10, we held white_block_2 in step 7.
- red_block_1 is on white_block_1 in step 12.
- When holding orange_block_1 in steps 3 and 9, after step 12, white_block_1 has red_block_1, so not clear. So need to clear white_block_1 after step 12.

This is very time-consuming, but I think the correct approach involves moving orange_block_1 to white_block_1, then moving it to the table, and ensuring all constraints are met.

After several iterations, the optimal plan is likely:

```
unstack black_block_2 white_block_1
putdown black_block_2
unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2
stack orange_block_1 white_block_1
unstack red_block_2 white_block_2
putdown red_block_2
unstack white_block_2 red_block_1
putdown white_block_2
unstack orange_block_1 white_block_1
putdown orange_block_1
pickup red_block_1
stack red_block_1 white_block_1
```

But need to check each constraint:

- Constraint 1: orange is on table in step 9. Before that, step 7: held white_block_2. Satisfied.

- Constraint 2: red_block_1 was not clear until step 7. In step 7, we unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. At that state, we are holding white_block_2 and black_block_2 is on table (step 2). Satisfied.

- Constraint 3: red_block_1 is stacked on white_block_1 in step 12.

- Constraint 4: holding orange in steps 3 and 9. In step 9, after putting down orange, white_block_1 is clear (after unstacking orange). So when holding orange in step 9, after that step, white_block_1 is clear. Satisfied.

- Constraint 5: white_block_2 is clear in step 5 (after unstacking red_block_2). Before that, orange was on white_block_1 in step 4. Satisfied.

This plan has 12 steps, but perhaps it's optimal. However, maybe there's a shorter way. But given the constraints, this seems necessary.
