Okay, let's see. The goal is to have the robotic arm holding brown_block_1. The initial state has a bunch of blocks arranged in certain ways. Let me start by visualizing the initial setup.

From the initial state:

- brown_block_1 is on the table, and white_block_1 is on top of it. But wait, the description says "white_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1" and that white_block_1 is clear. So brown_block_1 has white_block_1 on it, and nothing is on white_block_1. So brown_block_1 is not clear because it's under white_block_1. Therefore, to get brown_block_1, I need to first remove white_block_1 from it.

Similarly, looking at the other blocks:

- yellow_block_1 is on the table, with grey_block_1 on it, then black_block_1 on grey, and white_block_2 on black. So that's a stack: yellow, grey, black, white2. All of these except yellow are not on the table. But white_block_2 is clear. The red_block_1 is on the table and clear.

So the current state of brown_block_1 is under white_block_1, which is clear. So to pick up brown_block_1, I need to have it clear and on the table. But right now, brown_block_1 has white_block_1 on it. So first, I need to move white_block_1 somewhere else.

The available actions are pickup, putdown, stack, unstack. Let's think step by step.

To get brown_block_1 into the hand, I need to pick it up. But to do that, brown_block_1 must be on the table, clear, and the arm is empty. Currently, brown_block_1 is under white_block_1, so it's not clear. Therefore, the first step is to remove white_block_1 from brown_block_1.

So to unstack white_block_1 from brown_block_1. The preconditions for unstack are: white_block_1 is on brown_block_1, white_block_1 is clear, and the arm is empty. All these are true in the initial state. So the first action would be unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1. After that, the arm is holding white_block_1, and brown_block_1 becomes clear and on the table.

Now, with brown_block_1 clear and on the table, we can perform pickup brown_block_1. The preconditions for pickup are that the block is on the table, clear, and the arm is empty. After unstacking white_block_1, the arm is holding white_block_1, so we can't pickup brown_block_1 yet. So we need to put down white_block_1 first.

So after unstacking white_block_1 from brown_block_1, the arm is holding white_block_1. Then, we need to put it down somewhere. So putdown white_block_1. Now, white_block_1 is on the table, clear. Then, the arm is empty. Now, brown_block_1 is on the table and clear, so we can pickup brown_block_1.

So the steps would be:

1. unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1
2. putdown white_block_1
3. pickup brown_block_1

That's three actions. Let's check if that's possible.

Wait, but after unstacking white_block_1 from brown_block_1, the arm is holding white_block_1. Then, putdown white_block_1, which makes it on the table. Then, since the arm is empty, we can pickup brown_block_1.

Yes, that should work. Is there a shorter way? Let's see. The initial state: white_block_1 is on brown_block_1. So unstack is the only way to remove it. Then, after putting it down, pickup brown_block_1. So that's three steps. But maybe there's a way to stack white_block_1 somewhere else without putting it down, but then the arm would be holding white_block_1, which would need to be put down before picking up brown_block_1. Alternatively, maybe stack white_block_1 onto another block. For example, if there's a clear block, stack it there. But where?

Looking at the initial blocks, red_block_1 is on the table and clear. So after unstacking white_block_1, we could stack it onto red_block_1. Let's see:

1. unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1
2. stack white_block_1 red_block_1

After this, white_block_1 is on red_block_1. Then, the arm is empty. Then, we can pickup brown_block_1. That would be three steps as well. Wait, but stack requires that the target block (red_block_1) is clear. In the initial state, red_block_1 is clear. So after unstack, when we stack white_block_1 onto red_block_1, that's allowed. Then, the arm is empty, so we can pickup brown_block_1. So that would be three steps as well. But the original plan with putdown is three steps, same as stacking. So same length. So which is better?

Wait, in the first approach, after putting white_block_1 on the table, it's on the table and clear. In the second approach, stacking it on red_block_1 would make red_block_1 not clear. But since the goal is just to hold brown_block_1, either way is okay as long as the steps are valid.

But the question is whether this is a valid plan. Let's check the preconditions for each step.

First approach:

1. unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1: yes, white is on brown, white is clear, arm is empty.
2. putdown white_block_1: arm is holding white, so allowed. This places white on table, clear.
3. pickup brown_block_1: brown is on table, clear, arm empty. Correct.

Second approach:

1. unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1: same as before.
2. stack white_block_1 red_block_1: arm is holding white, red is clear. So allowed. After stacking, white is on red, red is not clear. Arm is empty.
3. pickup brown_block_1: yes, brown is on table, clear (since white was removed), arm is empty.

Either way, both plans have three steps. So both are optimal. But maybe the first approach is better because putting down is a single action, whereas stacking requires two blocks. But the length is the same. So either is acceptable. Wait, but the problem states to provide an optimal plan, which is the same length or shorter than any other. Since both are three steps, either is acceptable. But perhaps the first approach is simpler.

Wait, but when you stack, the target block (red_block_1) is now not clear. But in the putdown approach, white_block_1 is on the table. The goal is only to hold brown_block_1. So either way works.

But the user's answer requires that the plan is optimal. So whichever is possible. Let me check again.

Original initial state:

- white_block_1 is on brown_block_1 (so brown is not clear)
- red_block_1 is on table and clear.

So after unstacking white from brown, you can either putdown white (putting it on table) or stack it on red. Both options would allow the next action to pick up brown_block_1.

So both sequences are three steps. But perhaps the first approach (putdown) is better because stacking on red_block_1 would require that red is clear, which it is. So either approach is valid and optimal.

But let's check if stacking white on red would cause any issues. After stacking white on red, red is not clear. But the goal is just to hold brown_block_1. So that's okay.

So which plan is better? Both are same length. So either is acceptable. The user probably expects one of them. Let's see:

If we choose to stack white on red, then the steps would be:

unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1

stack white_block_1 red_block_1

pickup brown_block_1

That's three steps. Alternatively, putdown and pickup.

But perhaps the optimal plan requires three steps either way. So either is correct. Wait, but maybe in the stack approach, after stacking, the arm is empty, so then the pickup is possible. Yes. So both are correct.

But wait, when stacking, after stacking white on red, the red_block_1 is now under white, so brown_block_1 is clear and on table, so pickup is possible. So yes.

But the initial state of red_block_1 is clear, so stacking white on red is allowed. So both are valid. However, the plan that uses putdown would leave white on table, while the other uses stack. The problem doesn't have any constraints on the final state except holding brown_block_1. So either way is acceptable.

So both are valid and optimal. But the user might expect one. Let me think: which is shorter? No, same length. So either is correct. But perhaps the first approach (unstack, putdown, pickup) is more straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the stack approach is better. Let's check the preconditions again.

In the stack approach:

Action 1: unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1. Preconditions: white is on brown, white is clear, arm is empty. Correct.

Action 2: stack white_block_1 red_block_1. Preconditions: arm is holding white, red is clear. Red is clear initially. So yes.

Action 3: pickup brown_block_1. Preconditions: brown is on table, clear, arm is empty. After action 2, the arm is empty. And brown_block_1 is clear because white_block_1 was removed. So yes.

So that's a valid plan. So either approach is acceptable.

Wait, but in the initial state, after unstacking white_block_1, brown_block_1 becomes clear. Because the effect of unstack is that the block under (brown_block_1) becomes clear. So after unstack, brown_block_1 is clear. Then, stacking white_block_1 on red_block_1 leaves brown_block_1 still clear. So yes, then pickup is possible.

So either plan is valid. So the answer could be either. But which is better? Since the user wants the optimal plan, which is the shortest possible. Both have three steps, so either is correct.

But the problem is, in the initial state, when we unstack white_block_1 from brown_block_1, we have to put it somewhere. Either on the table or on another clear block. The red_block_1 is clear. So stacking it there saves a step? Wait, no. Because in the putdown approach, the steps are unstack, putdown, pickup (three steps). In the stack approach, unstack, stack, pickup (three steps). Same length. So both are optimal.

But the problem states "you need to provide an optimal plan, i.e., a valid plan whose length is equal or less than the length of any other valid plan." So any plan with the minimal number of steps is acceptable.

So the answer can be either. But perhaps the user expects one of them. Let me think if one of them is not possible.

Wait, when stacking white_block_1 on red_block_1, after that, the red_block_1 is no longer clear. But since the goal is just to hold brown_block_1, that's okay. So that's acceptable.

Alternatively, putting white_block_1 on the table is also acceptable. So both are valid. The answer requires an optimal plan. So either approach is correct.

But let's see if there's a shorter plan. Could it be done in two steps? Let's think.

The initial state requires that brown_block_1 has white_block_1 on it. To get brown_block_1 into the hand, we need to remove white_block_1. So the first action must be unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1. Then, the arm is holding white_block_1. To pickup brown_block_1, the arm must be empty. So we have to put down or stack white_block_1 first. Then pickup. So that's three steps. No way to do it in two steps. Therefore, three steps is the minimal.

Therefore, either plan is correct. However, perhaps the problem allows stacking on red_block_1, but maybe the blocks are already arranged in a way that allows a shorter path. But I don't think so.

So the answer could be either. But which one to choose? Let's look at the initial state again. The red_block_1 is on the table and clear, so stacking on it is possible. Therefore, the plan could be:

unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1

stack white_block_1 red_block_1

pickup brown_block_1

Alternatively:

unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1

putdown white_block_1

pickup brown_block_1

Either way, three steps. So both are optimal.

But perhaps the stack approach is better because it's two actions (unstack and stack) instead of unstack and putdown. But the number of steps is the same. So they are equally optimal.

But the user expects one answer. Let me check if there's any constraints in the problem that I missed. The user says: "The task is to bring about the following situation: 'you are holding brown_block_1'". So the final state is that the arm is holding brown_block_1. The other blocks can be in any state as long as that's achieved.

So both plans achieve that. So either is acceptable.

But perhaps the first approach (putdown) is more straightforward. Let's proceed with that.

Wait, but when we stack, after stacking white on red, white is on red, and the arm is empty, so we can then pickup brown. That's three steps. So both are correct.

The user might prefer the stack approach because it's using stack instead of putdown, but I think either is correct. Let's see. Maybe the problem requires that. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. For example, what if we unstack white_block_2 from black_block_1, then unstack black from grey, etc. But that's unnecessary steps. Because the goal is to get brown_block_1 into the hand. So the only necessary steps are those involving white_block_1 and brown_block_1.

Therefore, the minimal steps are three. So the answer is either of the two plans. But the user expects one. Let's choose the putdown approach. But why? Because after unstack, the arm is holding white, and the next action is to put it down, then pickup. Alternatively, stacking. Either is correct.

But perhaps the user wants the putdown approach. Let me proceed with that.

So the plan would be:

unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1

putdown white_block_1

pickup brown_block_1

Yes. That's three steps. Let's confirm each action's preconditions and effects.

1. unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1:
   - Pre: white is on brown, white is clear, arm empty. True initially.
   - Effects: white is not on brown, brown is clear, arm holds white.

2. putdown white_block_1:
   - Pre: arm is holding white. Yes.
   - Effects: white on table, clear, arm empty.

3. pickup brown_block_1:
   - Pre: brown is on table, clear, arm empty. After step 2, all true.
   - Effects: arm holds brown, brown not on table.

So this achieves the goal of holding brown_block_1.

Alternatively, the stack approach:

1. unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1

2. stack white_block_1 red_block_1

3. pickup brown_block_1

Check steps:

1. unstack: same as before.

2. stack white on red:
   - Pre: arm holds white, red is clear. True after step 1 (arm holds white, red is clear).
   - Effects: white on red, red not clear, arm empty.

3. pickup brown: same as before.

Both plans work. So either is correct. Since the problem asks for an optimal plan, and both are three steps, either is acceptable.

But maybe the problem expects the putdown approach. Alternatively, the stack approach could be better. But why? Because perhaps stacking white on red uses fewer blocks on the table, but the problem doesn't care about that. The goal is only to hold brown_block_1.

Therefore, either plan is correct. But perhaps the user expects the putdown approach. Let me proceed with that.

So the final answer would be:

```
unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1
putdown white_block_1
pickup brown_block_1
```

But another valid answer would be:

```
unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1
stack white_block_1 red_block_1
pickup brown_block_1
```

Either is correct. But the user might have a preference. But I need to check which one is actually possible.

Wait, after stacking white on red, is the red_block_1 clear? No, because white is on it. So after stacking, red is not clear. But that's okay. But in the initial state, red is clear, so stacking is allowed. So the second action is valid.

So both are correct. The user might accept either. But since the user example may vary, perhaps the first one is more straightforward. So I'll present that.
