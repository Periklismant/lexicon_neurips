Alright, so I am given a blocks world problem. Let's break down the problem:

1. We have blocks on the table or on top of each other.
2. The robotic arm can hold at most one block at a time.
3. We have four actions: pickup, putdown, stack, and unstack.

Next, let's understand the initial state:

- green_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
- black_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1
- yellow_block_3 is on top of green_block_2
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_2 is clear
- yellow_block_3 is clear
- grey_block_1 is clear
- we are not holding any block

So, in terms of a stack of blocks, we have:
1. yellow_block_2 on yellow_block_1 on green_block_1 on the table
2. yellow_block_3 on green_block_2 on black_block_1 on the table
3. grey_block_1 on the table

And our goal is to make black_block_1 clear.

But we also have constraints:

1. At some point during the plan, either we are holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3.
2. yellow_block_3 is never on the table.
3. At some point, black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1. (Note: Given the initial state, black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1 already, so this constraint is already satisfied.)
4. If black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1 (which is the case initially), then at some point black_block_1 is not on the table. 
5. At some point, yellow_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1.
6. At some point, green_block_2 is clear.
7. If green_block_2 is clear, then before that, either we were holding yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 was not on top of yellow_block_1.

Let's think about our goal: black_block_1 should be clear. In the initial state, green_block_2 is on top of black_block_1, and yellow_block_3 is on top of green_block_2. 

To make black_block_1 clear, we need to remove everything on top of it.

Using the constraints, I think a plan would look something like:

1. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2
2. We need to place yellow_block_3 somewhere (not on the table due to constraint 2)
  - We could place it on grey_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 1)
3. Stack yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1
4. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1 (this makes black_block_1 clear and satisfies constraint 6)
5. Now we need to satisfy constraint 5, where yellow_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
  - But currently, yellow_block_3 is on top of grey_block_1
  - We need to move yellow_block_3
6. But constraint 2 says yellow_block_3 is never on the table
  - We need to place yellow_block_3 on top of another block
7. Stack green_block_2 on yellow_block_2 (this block is clear in the initial state)
8. Unstack yellow_block_3 from grey_block_1
9. Stack yellow_block_3 on green_block_2
10. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1 (this satisfies the condition for constraint 7)
11. Stack yellow_block_2 on yellow_block_3
12. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
13. Stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1 (this satisfies constraint 5)
14. Pickup black_block_1 (this satisfies constraint 4)
15. Putdown black_block_1

Now, let's verify that all the constraints are satisfied:

1. grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3 - NOT SATISFIED
2. yellow_block_3 is not on the table - SATISFIED
3. black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1 - SATISFIED
4. black_block_1 is not on the table - SATISFIED
5. yellow_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 - SATISFIED
6. green_block_2 is clear - SATISFIED
7. Before green_block_2 is clear, either we're holding yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1 - SATISFIED

Let me redo the plan to satisfy the constraint about "At least one of the following conditions is true: you are holding grey_block_1, grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3".

Ok, we need to move grey_block_1 at some point, and we also want to ensure  that yellow_block_3 is never on the table.

I'll re-consider the constraints and see how to satisfy them:

1. At some point, either we are holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3.
2. yellow_block_3 is never on the table.
3. At some point, black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1. (Initially satisfied)
4. If black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1, then at some point black_block_1 is not on the table. (Will need to satisfy)
5. At some point, yellow_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1.
6. At some point, green_block_2 is clear.
7. If green_block_2 is clear, then before that, either we were holding yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 was not on top of yellow_block_1.

From the initial state, to satisfy point 1 and 5, we'll need to pick up grey_block_1 at some point and stack it on yellow_block_3, and later move it to allow yellow_block_1 to be stacked on top of it.

Starting with the initial state:

```
   YB2       YB3       GB1
   |         |         |
   YB1       GB2       
   |         |         
   GB1       BB1       
   |         |         
  Table     Table     Table
```

Initial plan:
1. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2
2. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2 (satisfying constraint 2)
3. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1 (satisfying constraint 6)
4. Stack green_block_2 on yellow_block_3
5. Pickup grey_block_1 (partially satisfying constraint 1)
6. Putdown grey_block_1
7. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1 (satisfying constraint 7)
8. Stack yellow_block_2 on green_block_2
9. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
10. Stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1 (satisfying constraint 5)
11. Pickup black_block_1 (satisfying constraint 4)
12. Putdown black_block_1

Wait, I think I still misunderstood some constraints. Especially the conditional ones. Let me reconsider:

1. At some point, either we are holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3.
2. yellow_block_3 is never on the table.
3. At some point, black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1. (Initially satisfied)
4. If black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1 (which is the case initially), then at some point black_block_1 is not on the table. (We will need to pick up black_block_1 at some point)
5. At some point, yellow_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1.
6. At some point, green_block_2 is clear. (will be satisfied when we remove yellow_block_3)
7. If green_block_2 is clear (which will happen when we remove yellow_block_3), then before that, either we were holding yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 was not on top of yellow_block_1.

For constraint 7, since green_block_2 will be clear after we remove yellow_block_3, then before that either:
a) We need to hold yellow_block_1, which means removing yellow_block_2 first.
b) yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1, which means we've moved yellow_block_2 somewhere else.

I think option b is simpler, so I'll go with that.

Ok, so if I understand the constraints correctly, a valid plan might be:

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1 (satisfying part of constraint 7)
2. Stack yellow_block_2 on grey_block_1
3. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2 (satisfying constraint 6)
4. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2
5. Pickup grey_block_1 (which has yellow_block_2 and yellow_block_3 on it, so we can't actually do this; revising plan)...

Actually, I think I need a different approach. Let's revisit the constraints.

1. Yellow_block_3 is currently on top of green_block_2 which is on top of black_block_1. To make black_block_1 clear, we need to remove everything on top of it.
2. Yellow_block_3 can't be on the table.
3. We need to move black_block_1 at some point.
4. We need to make yellow_block_1 on top of grey_block_1 at some point.
5. We need to make green_block_2 clear at some point.
6. Before green_block_2 is clear, we need to satisfy one of the two conditions about yellow_block_1 and yellow_block_2.

Taking into consideration all of these, let's try a different approach:

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1 (satisfying part of constraint 7)
2. Stack yellow_block_2 on grey_block_1
3. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2 (satisfying constraint 6)
4. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2
5. Pickup grey_block_1 (and everything on top of it, which we can't do in blocks world; this doesn't work).

Let's take a step back and reconsidered. The blocks world actions allow us to only move one block at a time, and we can only pickup blocks that are clear and on the table or unstack blocks that are clear. I think I need a more methodical approach:

Sigh, I'd like to draw what's happening, but let's do a step-by-step approach where I list what's on top of what at each step.

Initial configuration:
```
YB2 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
YB3 on GB2 on BB1 on Table
GB1 on Table
```

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1 (this satisfies constraint 7)
   ```
   YB1 on GB1 on Table
   YB3 on GB2 on BB1 on Table
   GB1 on Table
   (Holding YB2)
   ```

2. Stack yellow_block_2 on grey_block_1
   ```
   YB1 on GB1 on Table
   YB3 on GB2 on BB1 on Table
   YB2 on GB1 on Table
   (Not holding anything)
   ```

3. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2
   ```
   YB1 on GB1 on Table
   GB2 on BB1 on Table
   YB2 on GB1 on Table
   (Holding YB3)
   ```

4. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2
   ```
   YB1 on GB1 on Table
   GB2 on BB1 on Table
   YB3 on YB2 on GB1 on Table
   (Not holding anything)
   ```

5. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
   ```
   GB1 on Table
   GB2 on BB1 on Table
   YB3 on YB2 on GB1 on Table
   (Holding YB1)
   ```

Wait, I'm still confused about grey_block. In the initial configuration, it's "grey_block_1 is on the table" and then "grey_block_1 is clear". So, I believe it's just on the table with nothing on top.

Let me correct and continue:

Initial configuration:
```
YB2 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
YB3 on GB2 on BB1 on Table
GB1 on Table (This should be GrB1)
```

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1 (this satisfies constraint 7)
   ```
   YB1 on GB1 on Table
   YB3 on GB2 on BB1 on Table
   GrB1 on Table
   (Holding YB2)
   ```

2. Stack yellow_block_2 on grey_block_1
   ```
   YB1 on GB1 on Table
   YB3 on GB2 on BB1 on Table
   YB2 on GrB1 on Table
   (Not holding anything)
   ```

3. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2
   ```
   YB1 on GB1 on Table
   GB2 on BB1 on Table
   YB2 on GrB1 on Table
   (Holding YB3)
   ```

4. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2
   ```
   YB1 on GB1 on Table
   GB2 on BB1 on Table
   YB3 on YB2 on GrB1 on Table
   (Not holding anything)
   ```

5. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1 (this makes black_block_1 clear, which is our goal, and satisfies constraint 6)
   ```
   YB1 on GB1 on Table
   BB1 on Table
   YB3 on YB2 on GrB1 on Table
   (Holding GB2)
   ```

6. Stack green_block_2 on yellow_block_1
   ```
   GB2 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
   BB1 on Table
   YB3 on YB2 on GrB1 on Table
   (Not holding anything)
   ```

7. Pickup grey_block_1 (This won't work because it's not clear; it has yellow_block_2 and yellow_block_3 on top)

I'm realizing I keep making the same mistake. I need to be more methodical and ensure I've satisfied all the constraints.

Let's retry, with a focus on making sure we satisfy the constraints:

Constraints:
1. At some point, either we are holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3.
2. yellow_block_3 is never on the table.
3. At some point, black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1. (Already true in the initial state)
4. If black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1, then at some point black_block_1 is not on the table. (Need to pick up black_block_1)
5. At some point, yellow_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1.
6. At some point, green_block_2 is clear.
7. If green_block_2 is clear, then before that, either we were holding yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 was not on top of yellow_block_1.

Using these constraints and the goal to make black_block_1 clear:

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1 (to satisfy part of constraint 7)
   ```
   YB1 on GB1 on Table
   YB3 on GB2 on BB1 on Table
   GrB1 on Table
   (Holding YB2)
   ```

2. Stack yellow_block_2 on grey_block_1
   ```
   YB1 on GB1 on Table
   YB3 on GB2 on BB1 on Table
   YB2 on GrB1 on Table
   (Not holding anything)
   ```

3. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2 (making green_block_2 clear, satisfying constraint 6)
   ```
   YB1 on GB1 on Table
   GB2 on BB1 on Table
   YB2 on GrB1 on Table
   (Holding YB3)
   ```

4. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2
   ```
   YB1 on GB1 on Table
   GB2 on BB1 on Table
   YB3 on YB2 on GrB1 on Table
   (Not holding anything)
   ```

5. Unstack yellow_block_3 from yellow_block_2
   ```
   YB1 on GB1 on Table
   GB2 on BB1 on Table
   YB2 on GrB1 on Table
   (Holding YB3)
   ```

6. Putdown yellow_block_3 (violates constraint 2, so can't do this)

7. Let's try a different approach:
   
Initial configuration:
```
YB2 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
YB3 on GB2 on BB1 on Table
GrB1 on Table
```

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1 (to satisfy part of constraint 7)
   ```
   YB1 on GB1 on Table
   YB3 on GB2 on BB1 on Table
   GrB1 on Table
   (Holding YB2)
   ```

2. Stack yellow_block_2 on grey_block_1
   ```
   YB1 on GB1 on Table
   YB3 on GB2 on BB1 on Table
   YB2 on GrB1 on Table
   (Not holding anything)
   ```

3. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2 (making green_block_2 clear, satisfying constraint 6)
   ```
   YB1 on GB1 on Table
   GB2 on BB1 on Table
   YB2 on GrB1 on Table
   (Holding YB3)
   ```

4. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_1
   ```
   YB3 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
   GB2 on BB1 on Table
   YB2 on GrB1 on Table
   (Not holding anything)
   ```

5. Unstack yellow_block_2 from grey_block_1
   ```
   YB3 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
   GB2 on BB1 on Table
   GrB1 on Table
   (Holding YB2)
   ```

6. Stack yellow_block_2 on yellow_block_3
   ```
   YB2 on YB3 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
   GB2 on BB1 on Table
   GrB1 on Table
   (Not holding anything)
   ```

7. Pickup grey_block_1 (satisfying constraint 1)
   ```
   YB2 on YB3 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
   GB2 on BB1 on Table
   (Holding GrB1)
   ```

8. Stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3 (this won't work because yellow_block_3 is not clear, it has yellow_block_2 on it)

Ok, this approach isn't working either. Let's re-think.

Actually, I'm not 100% sure about the intrepretation of constraint 1. Let me re-read it:

"At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding grey_block_1", "grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3""

That means, during the entire plan, at some state, either I am holding grey_block_1 OR grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3.

Similarly, for constraint 7, it says:

"If expression "there is no block on top of green_block_2, i.e., green_block_2 is clear" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding yellow_block_1", "yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1"""

This means, if at some point in the plan green_block_2 is clear, then before that, i had to satisfy the condition after the colon ("you are holding yellow_block_1" or "yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1").

I think my approach isn't working because I'm overthinking. Let's make black_block_1 clear first, which is the ultimate goal, and make sure all the constraints are satisfied.

Initial configuration:
```
YB2 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
YB3 on GB2 on BB1 on Table
GrB1 on Table
```

1. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2 (this will make green_block_2 clear, but see constraint 7, I need to satisfy the condition first)

So, to satisfy constraint 7, before I unstack yellow_block_3, I need to make sure that either I am holding yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1.

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1
   ```
   YB1 on GB1 on Table
   YB3 on GB2 on BB1 on Table
   GrB1 on Table
   (Holding YB2)
   ```

2. Stack yellow_block_2 on grey_block_1
   ```
   YB1 on GB1 on Table
   YB3 on GB2 on BB1 on Table
   YB2 on GrB1 on Table
   (Not holding anything)
   ```

Now, condition "yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1" is satisfied, so I can proceed to unstack yellow_block_3 and make green_block_2 clear.

3. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2
   ```
   YB1 on GB1 on Table
   GB2 on BB1 on Table
   YB2 on GrB1 on Table
   (Holding YB3)
   ```

Now, to satisfy constraint 1, I need to either hold grey_block_1 at some point or make grey_block_1 on top of yellow_block_3. Let's do the latter:

4. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_1
   ```
   YB3 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
   GB2 on BB1 on Table
   YB2 on GrB1 on Table
   (Not holding anything)
   ```

5. Unstack yellow_block_2 from grey_block_1
   ```
   YB3 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
   GB2 on BB1 on Table
   GrB1 on Table
   (Holding YB2)
   ```

6. Stack yellow_block_2 on yellow_block_3
   ```
   YB2 on YB3 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
   GB2 on BB1 on Table
   GrB1 on Table
   (Not holding anything)
   ```

7. Pickup grey_block_1
   ```
   YB2 on YB3 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
   GB2 on BB1 on Table
   (Holding GrB1)
   ```

8. Stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_2
   ```
   GrB1 on YB2 on YB3 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
   GB2 on BB1 on Table
   (Not holding anything)
   ```

9. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1 (this makes black_block_1 clear, which is our goal)
   ```
   GrB1 on YB2 on YB3 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
   BB1 on Table
   (Holding GB2)
   ```

10. Stack green_block_2 on grey_block_1
    ```
    GB2 on GrB1 on YB2 on YB3 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
    BB1 on Table
    (Not holding anything)
    ```

11. Pickup black_block_1 (satisfying constraint 4)
    ```
    GB2 on GrB1 on YB2 on YB3 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
    (Holding BB1)
    ```

12. Stack black_block_1 on green_block_2
    ```
    BB1 on GB2 on GrB1 on YB2 on YB3 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
    (Not holding anything)
    ```

Now, to satisfy constraint 5, at some point, yellow_block_1 needs to be on top of grey_block_1.

Hmm, now I'm in a bind because Grey_block_1 is beneath a lot of blocks. I'll probably need to restructure my approach.

Actually, I feel like we don't need to make the world so complicated. Let's think of it this way:

1. I need to make black_block_1 clear, which means removing green_block_2 and yellow_block_3.
2. I need to satisfy the contraints, some of which have temporal dependencies.

Let's try a different approach:

Initial configuration:
```
YB2 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
YB3 on GB2 on BB1 on Table
GrB1 on Table
```

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1 (satisfying part of constraint 7)
   ```
   YB1 on GB1 on Table
   YB3 on GB2 on BB1 on Table
   GrB1 on Table
   (Holding YB2)
   ```

2. Putdown yellow_block_2
   ```
   YB1 on GB1 on Table
   YB3 on GB2 on BB1 on Table
   GrB1 on Table
   YB2 on Table
   (Not holding anything)
   ```

3. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2 (satisfying constraint 6, after previously satisfying constraint 7)
   ```
   YB1 on GB1 on Table
   GB2 on BB1 on Table
   GrB1 on Table
   YB2 on Table
   (Holding YB3)
   ```

4. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_1
   ```
   YB3 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
   GB2 on BB1 on Table
   GrB1 on Table
   YB2 on Table
   (Not holding anything)
   ```

5. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1 (this makes black_block_1 clear, which is our goal)
   ```
   YB3 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
   BB1 on Table
   GrB1 on Table
   YB2 on Table
   (Holding GB2)
   ```

6. Stack green_block_2 on green_block_1
   ```
   YB3 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
   GB2 on YB3 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
   BB1 on Table
   GrB1 on Table
   YB2 on Table
   (Not holding anything)
   ```

Wait, this is not valid in blocks world. Each block can have at most one block on top of it. Let me restructure:

6. Stack green_block_2 on yellow_block_2
   ```
   YB3 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
   GB2 on YB2 on Table
   BB1 on Table
   GrB1 on Table
   (Not holding anything)
   ```

7. Pickup grey_block_1 (satisfying constraint 1)
   ```
   YB3 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
   GB2 on YB2 on Table
   BB1 on Table
   (Holding GrB1)
   ```

8. Stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3 (satisfying constraint 1 in a different way)
   ```
   GrB1 on YB3 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
   GB2 on YB2 on Table
   BB1 on Table
   (Not holding anything)
   ```

9. Pickup black_block_1 (satisfying constraint 4)
   ```
   GrB1 on YB3 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
   GB2 on YB2 on Table
   (Holding BB1)
   ```

10. Putdown black_block_1
    ```
    GrB1 on YB3 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
    GB2 on YB2 on Table
    BB1 on Table
    (Not holding anything)
    ```

Now, to satisfy constraint 5, at some point, yellow_block_1 needs to be on top of grey_block_1.

11. Unstack grey_block_1 from yellow_block_3
    ```
    YB3 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
    GB2 on YB2 on Table
    BB1 on Table
    (Holding GrB1)
    ```

12. Putdown grey_block_1
    ```
    YB3 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
    GB2 on YB2 on Table
    BB1 on Table
    GrB1 on Table
    (Not holding anything)
    ```

13. Unstack yellow_block_3 from yellow_block_1
    ```
    YB1 on GB1 on Table
    GB2 on YB2 on Table
    BB1 on Table
    GrB1 on Table
    (Holding YB3)
    ```

14. Stack yellow_block_3 on green_block_2
    ```
    YB1 on GB1 on Table
    YB3 on GB2 on YB2 on Table
    BB1 on Table
    GrB1 on Table
    (Not holding anything)
    ```

15. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
    ```
    GB1 on Table
    YB3 on GB2 on YB2 on Table
    BB1 on Table
    GrB1 on Table
    (Holding YB1)
    ```

16. Stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1 (satisfying constraint 5)
    ```
    GB1 on Table
    YB3 on GB2 on YB2 on Table
    BB1 on Table
    YB1 on GrB1 on Table
    (Not holding anything)
    ```

All our constraints are now satisfied, and black_block_1 is clear. Let's summarize the plan:

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1
2. Putdown yellow_block_2
3. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2
4. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_1
5. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1
6. Stack green_block_2 on yellow_block_2
7. Pickup grey_block_1
8. Stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3
9. Pickup black_block_1
10. Putdown black_block_1
11. Unstack grey_block_1 from yellow_block_3
12. Putdown grey_block_1
13. Unstack yellow_block_3 from yellow_block_1
14. Stack yellow_block_3 on green_block_2
15. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
16. Stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1

Let's verify that all of the constraints are satisfied:

1. At some point, either we are holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3.
   - Satisfied in steps 7 and 8.

2. yellow_block_3 is never on the table.
   - Satisfied. yellow_block_3 starts on green_block_2, then is placed on yellow_block_1, then on green_block_2 again.

3. At some point, black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1.
   - Satisfied. In the initial state, black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1.

4. If black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1, then at some point black_block_1 is not on the table.
   - Satisfied. black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1 from the beginning, and at some point (step 9), black_block_1 is not on the table.

5. At some point, yellow_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1.
   - Satisfied in step 16.

6. At some point, green_block_2 is clear.
   - Satisfied in step 3.

7. If green_block_2 is clear, then before that, either we were holding yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1.
   - Satisfied. green_block_2 becomes clear in step 3, and before that, in step 1, yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1.

I think all of them are now satisfied. Let's go back to our goal:

Make black_block_1 clear.

In our plan, black_block_1 becomes clear in step 5 and remains clear through the end of the plan.

I think we've got a valid plan!

Actually, let's double check constraint 1 one more time:

"At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding grey_block_1", "grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3""

I satisfy this in step 7 (holding grey_block_1) and step 8 (grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3).

And we can actually stop at step 10, since we've already made black_block_1 clear and satisfied all of the constraints:

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1
2. Putdown yellow_block_2
3. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2
4. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_1
5. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1
6. Stack green_block_2 on yellow_block_2
7. Pickup grey_block_1
8. Stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3
9. Pickup black_block_1
10. Putdown black_block_1

Checking all the constraints to make sure they are satisfied:

1. At some point, either we are holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3.
   - Satisfied in steps 7 and 8.

2. yellow_block_3 is never on the table.
   - Satisfied. yellow_block_3 starts on green_block_2, then is placed on yellow_block_1.

3. At some point, black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1.
   - Satisfied. In the initial state, black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1.

4. If black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1, then at some point black_block_1 is not on the table.
   - Satisfied. black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1 from the beginning, and at some point (step 9), black_block_1 is not on the table.

5. At some point, yellow_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1.
   - Not satisfied. We need to actually do steps 11-16 to satisfy this constraint.

Actually, I guess we can't stop at step 10 as constraint 5 is still not satisfied. So the entire plan is necessary.

But actually, I think I found a more efficient plan that has fewer steps. Let me try:

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1
2. Stack yellow_block_2 on grey_block_1
3. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2
4. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_1
5. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1
6. Putdown green_block_2
7. Pickup black_block_1
8. Putdown black_block_1
9. Unstack yellow_block_3 from yellow_block_1
10. Stack yellow_block_3 on green_block_2
11. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
12. Stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1

Tracing through this plan, I realize that we've put yellow_block_1 on top of grey_block_1, but we haven't satisfied constraint 1 (that at some point, we are holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3).

Let's modify the plan to satisfy this constraint, perhaps by picking up grey_block_1 at some point.

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1
2. Putdown yellow_block_2
3. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2
4. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_1
5. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1
6. Stack green_block_2 on yellow_block_2
7. Pickup grey_block_1
8. Putdown grey_block_1
9. Unstack yellow_block_3 from yellow_block_1
10. Stack yellow_block_3 on green_block_2
11. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
12. Stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1

This satisfies constraint 1 by picking up grey_block_1, but still doesn't make grey_block_1 on top of yellow_block_3.

I feel like we're going in circles, so let's try to solve the problem using a more direct approach.

Initial configuration:
```
YB2 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
YB3 on GB2 on BB1 on Table
GrB1 on Table
```

Our goal is to make black_block_1 clear. To do this, we need to remove everything on top of it. 

Let's think step by step about what would be the fastest way to make black_block_1 clear: we need to move yellow_block_3 and green_block_2.

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1 (satisfying part of constraint 7)
2. Stack yellow_block_2 on grey_block_1
3. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2 (making green_block_2 clear, satisfying constraint 6)
4. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_1
5. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1 (making black_block_1 clear, which is our goal)
6. Stack green_block_2 on yellow_block_2

Now, we've made black_block_1 clear, and we've already satisfied constraints 6 and 7. Let's satisfy the rest:

7. Pickup grey_block_1 (this won't work because yellow_block_2 is on it)

We need to move yellow_block_2 first:

7. Unstack yellow_block_2 from grey_block_1
8. Stack yellow_block_2 on black_block_1
9. Pickup grey_block_1 (satisfying part of constraint 1)
10. Stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3 (satisfying constraint 1 fully)
11. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
12. Stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1 (satisfying constraint 5)

We've made black_block_1 clear and satisfied constraints 1, 5, 6, and 7. Now, let's make sure we satisfy constraints 3 and 4.

Constraint 3 is already satisfied in the initial state (black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1).

For constraint 4, since black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1 from the beginning, we need to make black_block_1 not on the table at some point:

13. Unstack yellow_block_2 from black_block_1
14. Stack yellow_block_2 on yellow_block_1
15. Pickup black_block_1 (satisfying constraint 4)
16. Putdown black_block_1

I think we now have a valid plan that satisfies all the constraints:

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1
2. Stack yellow_block_2 on grey_block_1
3. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2
4. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_1
5. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1
6. Stack green_block_2 on yellow_block_2
7. Unstack yellow_block_2 from grey_block_1 (hmm this is invalid, it has green_block_2 on it)

I still have the issue of circular dependencies. I feel like I'm complicating the problem. Let me start with a clean slate.

We need to make black_block_1 clear, and to do that we need to move yellow_block_3 and green_block_2. For that, we need to satisfy constraints:

1. At some point, either we are holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3.
2. yellow_block_3 is never on the table.
3. At some point, black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1. (Already satisfied in the initial state)
4. If black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1, then at some point black_block_1 is not on the table.
5. At some point, yellow_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1.
6. At some point, green_block_2 is clear.
7. If green_block_2 is clear, then before that, either we were holding yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 was not on top of yellow_block_1.

Given the initial configuration:
```
YB2 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
YB3 on GB2 on BB1 on Table
GrB1 on Table
```

To satisfy constraint 7, we need to either hold yellow_block_1 or make yellow_block_2 not on top of yellow_block_1 before green_block_2 is clear. The easiest seems to be to unstack yellow_block_2:

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1
2. Stack yellow_block_2 on grey_block_1
3. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2 (making green_block_2 clear, satisfying constraint 6)
4. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_1
5. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1 (making black_block_1 clear, which is our goal)
6. Stack green_block_2 on black_block_1 (temp, so I can do other operations)

Now, we've made black_block_1 clear, and then covered it again, but we've already satisfied constraints 6 and 7. Next, we need to satisfy constraints 1 and 5.

7. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1
8. Stack green_block_2 on yellow_block_3
9. Pickup black_block_1 (satisfying constraint 4)
10. Putdown black_block_1
11. Unstack yellow_block_2 from grey_block_1
12. Stack yellow_block_2 on green_block_2
13. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
14. Stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1 (satisfying constraint 5)
15. Unstack yellow_block_2 from green_block_2
16. Stack yellow_block_2 on yellow_block_1
17. Unstack green_block_2 from yellow_block_3
18. Stack green_block_2 on yellow_block_2
19. Pickup grey_block_1 (satisfying part of constraint 1)
20. Stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3 (satisfying full constraint 1)

Now, all the constraints have been satisfied, and we've achieved our goal of making black_block_1 clear.

Actually, I realize I can make this plan more efficient by not having to re-stack green_block_2 on black_block_1 in step 6. Let me revise:

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1
2. Stack yellow_block_2 on grey_block_1
3. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2 (making green_block_2 clear, satisfying constraint 6)
4. Stack yellow_block_3 on black_block_1
5. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1 (this doesn't work since yellow_block_3 is on black_block_1 now)

Let me redo:

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1
2. Stack yellow_block_2 on grey_block_1
3. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2 (making green_block_2 clear, satisfying constraint 6)
4. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_1
5. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1 (making black_block_1 clear, which is our goal)

It seems I'm still too ambitious with my plans, and they don't pan out. Let me try a different approach. Let's first ensure we make black_block_1 clear, and then work on satisfying the other constraints one by one.

Hmm, on reflection, I think my overarching approach is fine. I just need to be more careful in tracing through the effects of the actions.

First, I need to make green_block_2 clear. To do this, I need to unstack yellow_block_3. To satisfy constraint 7, before doing that, I need to remove yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1.

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1
2. Putdown yellow_block_2
3. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2 (making green_block_2 clear, satisfying constraint 6)
4. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_1
5. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1 (making black_block_1 clear, which is our goal)
6. Putdown green_block_2

Now our goal is satisfied and I've satisfied constraint 6. The remaining constraints are 1, 4 and 5.

7. Pickup black_block_1 (satisfying constraint 4)
8. Putdown black_block_1
9. Pickup grey_block_1 (partially satisfying constraint 1)
10. Stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3 (fully satisfying constraint 1)
11. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
12. Stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1 (satisfying constraint 5)

Alright, this plan should satisfy all the constraints and achieve our goal. Let's check:

1. At some point, either we are holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3.
   - Satisfied in steps 9 and 10.

2. yellow_block_3 is never on the table.
   - Satisfied. yellow_block_3 moves from green_block_2 to yellow_block_1.

3. At some point, black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1.
   - Satisfied. In the initial state, black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1.

4. If black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1, then at some point black_block_1 is not on the table.
   - Satisfied. black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1 from the beginning, and at some point (step 7), black_block_1 is not on the table.

5. At some point, yellow_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1.
   - Satisfied in step 12.

6. At some point, green_block_2 is clear.
   - Satisfied in step 3.

7. If green_block_2 is clear, then before that, either we were holding yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1.
   - Satisfied. green_block_2 becomes clear in step 3, and before that, in step 1, yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1.

This looks good! I believe we've got a valid plan:

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1
2. Putdown yellow_block_2
3. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2
4. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_1
5. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1
6. Putdown green_block_2
7. Pickup black_block_1
8. Putdown black_block_1
9. Pickup grey_block_1
10. Stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3
11. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
12. Stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1

Let's double check this. Starting from the position:

```
YB2 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
YB3 on GB2 on BB1 on Table
GrB1 on Table
```

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1
```
YB1 on GB1 on Table
YB3 on GB2 on BB1 on Table
GrB1 on Table
(Holding YB2)
```

2. Putdown yellow_block_2
```

```

3. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2
```
YB1 on GB1 on Table

(Holding YB3)
```

4. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_1
```
YB3 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
GB2 on BB1 on Table

```

5. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1
```
YB3 on YB1 on GB1 on Table

```

6. Putdown green_block_2
```

7. Pickup black_block_1

```

8. Putdown black_block_1

```

9. Pickup grey_block_1
```

```

10. Stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3
```
GrB1 on YB3 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
BB1 on Table
YB2 on Table
GB2 on Table
(Not holding anything)
```

11. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1 (this doesn't work because it's not clear, it has both grey_block_1 and yellow_block_3 on top)

Sigh, I still messed up. Let's redo. yellow_block_1 is not clear. Let's understand the situation:

By satisfying constraint 1 (steps 9-10), we've placed grey_block_1 on top of yellow_block_3, which is on top of yellow_block_1, so now yellow_block_1 is not clear. But to satisfy constraint 5, we need to make yellow_block_1 on top of grey_block_1.

There's a dependency here. Let's think about this chronologically:

1. We want to make black_block_1 clear, which means removing green_block_2 from it.
2. Before removing yellow_block_3 from green_block_2, we need to satisfy constraint 7.
3. Constraint 7 is satisfied when yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1, so we unstack it.
4. Now we can remove yellow_block_3 and then green_block_2, making black_block_1 clear.
5. To satisfy constraint 1, we will want to place grey_block_1 on top of yellow_block_3.
6. To satisfy constraint 5, we want to place yellow_block_1 on top of grey_block_1.

But there's a circular dependency here. If we satisfy constraint 1 first (grey_block_1 on top of yellow_block_3), then yellow_block_1 is not clear (it has yellow_block_3 and grey_block_1 on top). If we satisfy constraint 5 first (yellow_block_1 on top of grey_block_1), then we can't place grey_block_1 on top of yellow_block_3.

Actually, I think I've been overly complicating this. The alternative to "grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3" for Constraint 1 is "you are holding grey_block_1". We could satisfy that constraint by holding grey_block_1 at some point, and it doesn't have to be on top of yellow_block_3.

Let's redo the plan with this in mind:

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1
2. Putdown yellow_block_2
3. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2 (making green_block_2 clear, satisfying constraint 6)
4. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_1
5. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1 (making black_block_1 clear, which is our goal)
6. Putdown green_block_2
7. Pickup black_block_1 (satisfying constraint 4)
8. Putdown black_block_1
9. Unstack yellow_block_3 from yellow_block_1
10. Stack yellow_block_3 on green_block_2
11. Pickup grey_block_1 (satisfying constraint 1)
12. Putdown grey_block_1
13. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
14. Stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1 (satisfying constraint 5)

Alright, let's trace through this step-by-step to make sure it works.

Starting from the position:

```
YB2 on YB1 on GB1 on Table
YB3 on GB2 on BB1 on Table
GrB1 on Table
```

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1

```
GB1 on Table
BB1 on Table
YB1 on GrB1 on Table
YB2 on Table
YB3 on GB2 on Table
(Not holding anything)
```

This seems like a valid plan. Let's check the constraints again:

1. At some point, either we are holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3.
   - Satisfied in step 11 (holding grey_block_1).

2. yellow_block_3 is never on the table.
   - Satisfied. yellow_block_3 moves from green_block_2 to yellow_block_1 to green_block_2.

3. At some point, black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1.
   - Satisfied. In the initial state, black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1.

4. If black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1, then at some point black_block_1 is not on the table.
   - Satisfied. black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1 from the beginning, and at some point (step 7), black_block_1 is not on the table.

5. At some point, yellow_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1.
   - Satisfied in step 14.

6. At some point, green_block_2 is clear.
   - Satisfied in step 3.

7. If green_block_2 is clear, then before that, either we were holding yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 was not on top of yellow_block_1.
   - Satisfied. green_block_2 becomes clear in step 3, and before that, in step 1, yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1.

Alright, this plan should be valid. It's relatively straight-forward to follow, and it seems to satisfy all the constraints:

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1
2. Putdown yellow_block_2
3. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2
4. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_1
5. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1
6. Putdown green_block_2
7. Pickup black_block_1
8. Putdown black_block_1
9. Unstack yellow_block_3 from yellow_block_1
10. Stack yellow_block_3 on green_block_2
11. Pickup grey_block_1
12. Putdown grey_block_1
13. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
14. Stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1
