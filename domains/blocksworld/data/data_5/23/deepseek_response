**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2**: Remove yellow_block_3 from green_block_2 to access green_block_2.
2. **stack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1**: Place yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1, satisfying the constraint that grey_block_1 must have yellow_block_3 in at least one state.
3. **unstack green_block_2 black_block_1**: Remove green_block_2 from black_block_1, making black_block_1 clear (achieves the goal).
4. **putdown green_block_2**: Place green_block_2 on the table, making it clear (satisfies the constraint requiring green_block_2 to be clear).
5. **pickup black_block_1**: Lift black_block_1 to ensure it's not on the table, fulfilling the constraint that black_block_1 must not be on the table after being clear.
6. **stack black_block_1 green_block_2**: Place black_block_1 back on green_block_2, keeping it clear and off the table.
7. **unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1**: Remove yellow_block_2 to later satisfy the constraint involving yellow_block_1.
8. **stack yellow_block_2 grey_block_1**: Place yellow_block_2 on grey_block_1, ensuring yellow_block_3 remains off the table and satisfying the constraint for yellow_block_1's position indirectly.

This plan efficiently meets all constraints and achieves the goal with minimal steps.
