Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to make sure that black_block_1 is clear, which means nothing is on top of it. In the initial state, green_block_2 is on black_block_1. So I need to remove green_block_2 from black_block_1. 

But wait, there's yellow_block_3 on top of green_block_2. So first, I have to unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2. Let me check the preconditions for unstack. To unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2, yellow_block_3 must be clear (which it is), and the arm isn't holding anything (which it isn't). So action: unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2. Then the arm is holding yellow_block_3. Next, I can put it down, but wait, the constraints say that in every state, yellow_block_3 must not be on the table. So putting it down on the table is not allowed. So I need to stack it somewhere else. Let's see. The constraint also says that in at least one state, either the arm is holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3. So maybe stack yellow_block_3 onto grey_block_1? Wait, but grey_block_1 is on the table and clear. So stack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1. That would make grey_block_1 not clear, but the action requires that the target block (grey_block_1) is clear. Which it is. So yes, stack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1. That would satisfy the constraint because now grey_block_1 is under yellow_block_3. Then, after that, we can unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. Wait, but green_block_2 is under yellow_block_3, which we just moved. Wait, in the initial state, green_block_2 is on black_block_1, and yellow_block_3 is on green_block_2. After unstacking yellow_block_3 from green_block_2, green_block_2 becomes clear. So then we can pick up green_block_2 (since it's on the table? Wait no, green_block_2 is on black_block_1. To pick up green_block_2, it has to be on the table. So to get green_block_2 off black_block_1, we need to unstack it. Wait, green_block_2 is on black_block_1. So to unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1, we need to check preconditions: green_block_2 is on black_block_1, green_block_2 is clear (which it is after removing yellow_block_3), and the arm isn't holding anything. So unstack green_block_2 black_block_1. Then we can put it down on the table. But wait, the goal is just to have black_block_1 clear, which would be achieved by removing green_block_2. But after unstacking green_block_2 from black_block_1 and putting it down, black_block_1 is clear. But we need to satisfy all constraints.

Wait, the constraints: 

1. At least one state must have holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 under yellow_block_3. We already stacked yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1, so that condition is satisfied in that state. So that's covered.

2. Every state must have yellow_block_3 not on the table. So whenever we move yellow_block_3, we can't put it on the table. So after unstacking it, we have to stack it somewhere. So stacking on grey_block_1 is good.

3. At least one state where black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1. Initially, black_block_1 is on the table, so it's not on grey_block_1. So that's already true. But maybe the constraint is that this must hold in at least one state, which it already does. But the problem says that the constraints must be abided by. Wait, but the fourth constraint says that if black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1 in some state, then black_block_1 is not on the table in that state or a later one. Since in the initial state, black_block_1 is on the table and not on grey_block_1, we have to ensure that in that state or a later one, black_block_1 is not on the table. Wait, but black_block_1 starts on the table. So the fourth constraint says that if in any state s, black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1 (which is true in the initial state), then in s or a later state, black_block_1 is not on the table. So to satisfy this, we need to have black_block_1 not on the table at some point after the initial state. So we must move black_block_1 off the table. But black_block_1 is initially under green_block_2. So after we unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1, black_block_1 is clear. To move black_block_1, we need to pick it up. But black_block_1 is on the table and clear. So we can pick it up. Then put it down again? But that would put it back on the table. Alternatively, stack it on another block. But where? Let's see. If we stack black_block_1 onto another block, say grey_block_1, but grey_block_1 currently has yellow_block_3 on top. So we can't stack there. Maybe stack onto another block. But which ones are available? Let's see. Other blocks: green_block_1 has yellow_block_1 and yellow_block_2. So maybe after moving some blocks, we can stack black_block_1 somewhere. But this complicates the plan. Wait, the goal is just to have black_block_1 clear, but the constraints require that black_block_1 is not on the table at some point. Because in the initial state, black_block_1 is on the table and not on grey_block_1. So according to constraint 4, we must have black_block_1 not on the table in that state or a later one. But the initial state is s0. So in s0, black_block_1 is on the table. So constraint 4 says that if in s0, black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1 (which is true), then in s0 or later, black_block_1 is not on the table. But in s0, it is on the table. So we need to have a later state where black_block_1 is not on the table. Therefore, we must move black_block_1 off the table. So after unstacking green_block_2 from black_block_1, we can pick up black_block_1 (since it's on the table and clear), then stack it somewhere. For example, stack it on grey_block_1. But grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3 on it. Wait, no: after stacking yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1, grey_block_1 is not clear. So we can't stack anything else on it unless we move yellow_block_3 again. Alternatively, stack black_block_1 on another block. Let's see other options. Maybe stack it on green_block_1. But green_block_1 has yellow_block_1 and yellow_block_2. So to stack on green_block_1, we need to have green_block_1 clear. But currently, yellow_block_1 is on green_block_1, and yellow_block_2 is on yellow_block_1. So that's a tower. To make green_block_1 clear, we need to unstack yellow_block_1 and then yellow_block_2. That's getting complicated, but maybe necessary. Alternatively, stack black_block_1 on another block that's clear. Let's check the initial state:

Blocks on table: green_block_1 (has yellow_block_1 and yellow_block_2), black_block_1 (has green_block_2 and yellow_block_3), grey_block_1 (clear). After moving yellow_block_3 to grey_block_1, grey_block_1 is not clear. So the only clear blocks after that would be green_block_2 (after we unstack it from black_block_1). Wait, when we unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1, after that, black_block_1 is clear (but still on the table). Then, if we put green_block_2 on the table, but then we need to move black_block_1. But let's see: after unstacking green_block_2 from black_block_1, we can put it down. Then, pickup black_block_1 (since it's on table and clear), then stack it on another block. But which block is clear? Maybe green_block_2, which is now on the table and clear. So stack black_block_1 onto green_block_2. That would make black_block_1 not on the table, satisfying constraint 4. Then, the goal is achieved because black_block_1 is clear (since nothing is on top of it). Wait, no. If we stack black_block_1 on green_block_2, then green_block_2 is under black_block_1, so black_block_1 is on top of green_block_2, making green_block_2 not clear. But the goal is to have black_block_1 clear. Wait, the goal is "there is no block on top of black_block_1". So if we stack black_block_1 on green_block_2, then black_block_1 has nothing on top, so it's clear. Wait, no. Wait, stacking black_block_1 onto green_block_2 would place black_block_1 on top of green_block_2. Then, black_block_1 is on green_block_2, so black_block_1 is clear (since nothing is on top of it), and green_block_2 is not clear (because black_block_1 is on it). So the goal is satisfied because black_block_1 is clear. But in this case, black_block_1 is not on the table, so constraint 4 is satisfied. 

But let's outline the steps:

1. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2. Now holding yellow_block_3.
2. Stack yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3, satisfying the first constraint (grey_block_1 is under yellow_block_3 in this state).
3. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. Now holding green_block_2. Black_block_1 is clear (goal achieved, but we need to maintain it). However, we have to ensure that black_block_1 is not on the table in some state. So after this, black_block_1 is still on the table. So we need to move it.
4. Putdown green_block_2. Now green_block_2 is on the table, clear.
5. Pickup black_block_1. Now holding black_block_1. Black_block_1 is no longer on the table, satisfying constraint 4.
6. Stack black_block_1 on green_block_2. Now black_block_1 is on green_block_2, and is clear. The goal is achieved.

But wait, after step 3, black_block_1 is clear. So the goal is achieved. But the constraints require that we have to also satisfy all the other constraints. Let's check:

- The first constraint: At least one state has holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 under yellow_block_3. In step 2, after stacking, that's true. So covered.

- Second constraint: yellow_block_3 is not on the table in every state. Initially, it's on green_block_2 (not on table). After step 2, it's on grey_block_1 (not on table). So that's okay.

- Third constraint: black_block_1 not on grey_block_1 in at least one state. Initially, it's on the table, so not on grey_block_1. So covered.

- Fourth constraint: if black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1 in some state, then in that state or later, black_block_1 is not on the table. Since in the initial state, black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1 and is on the table, we need to have a later state where it's not on the table. That happens when we pick it up in step 5 and stack it in step 6. So after step 5, it's not on the table anymore.

- Fifth constraint: yellow_block_1 on top of grey_block_1 in at least one state. Hmm, this isn't addressed yet. So we need to have a state where yellow_block_1 is on grey_block_1. Currently, in the initial state, yellow_block_1 is on green_block_1, and yellow_block_2 is on yellow_block_1. So perhaps after moving some blocks, we can stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1. Let's see. To do that, we need to unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1, then unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1, then stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1. But that adds steps. How can we fit that into the plan without making it longer? Also, the sixth constraint requires that at least one state has green_block_2 clear. In our current plan, after step 3, green_block_2 is held, then put down in step 4, making it clear. So step 4's state has green_block_2 clear. Then, the sixth constraint says that if green_block_2 is clear in some state, then there must be an earlier state where either holding yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 is not on yellow_block_1. In our current plan, the state where green_block_2 is clear (step 4) is after step 3. The earlier states are steps 1-3. In the initial state, yellow_block_2 is on yellow_block_1, so the condition "yellow_block_2 is not on yellow_block_1" is false. So we need to have a state before step 4 where either the arm is holding yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 is not on yellow_block_1. But in our current plan, we haven't touched those blocks. So this constraint is not satisfied. Therefore, we need to modify the plan to include an action that affects yellow_block_2 or yellow_block_1 before green_block_2 becomes clear.

Hmm, this complicates things. Let's think. The sixth constraint is that whenever green_block_2 is clear (which happens after step 3, when we unstack it), there must be an earlier state where either the arm is holding yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 is not on yellow_block_1. But in our current plan, before step 3, we have steps 1 and 2, which involve moving yellow_block_3 and grey_block_1. So the initial state has yellow_block_2 on yellow_block_1. So to satisfy the sixth constraint, we need to have an action before step 3 that either picks up yellow_block_1 or moves yellow_block_2 off yellow_block_1. Let's see. If we can unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1, that would make yellow_block_2 not on yellow_block_1. So perhaps insert that action before step 3. Let's adjust the plan:

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. Now holding yellow_block_2. This satisfies the sixth constraint's condition because now yellow_block_2 is not on yellow_block_1. Then, we can proceed.

But wait, but this action requires that yellow_block_2 is clear (which it is in the initial state), and the arm is empty. So yes, possible. Then put down yellow_block_2 or stack it somewhere. But we need to satisfy other constraints. Also, the fifth constraint requires that yellow_block_1 is on grey_block_1 at least once. So maybe stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1 after moving it.

But this is getting complicated. Let me try to outline a revised plan:

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. Preconditions: yellow_block_2 is on yellow_block_1, yellow_block_2 is clear (yes), arm is empty. Action: unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1. Now holding yellow_block_2.

2. Putdown yellow_block_2. Now yellow_block_2 is on the table, clear. This allows the sixth constraint's condition (yellow_block_2 not on yellow_block_1) to be true in this state, which is before step where green_block_2 is clear.

3. Now proceed with original steps:

   a. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2.

   b. Stack yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1.

   c. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. Now green_block_2 is clear (step c's effect). The sixth constraint is satisfied because before this, in step 1, yellow_block_2 was moved, satisfying the condition.

4. Now, to handle the fifth constraint: yellow_block_1 must be on grey_block_1 in some state. Currently, yellow_block_1 is on green_block_1. To move it to grey_block_1, we need to unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1. But yellow_block_1 has nothing on top of it now (since we removed yellow_block_2 in step 1). So we can unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.

5. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1. Now holding yellow_block_1.

6. Stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1. But grey_block_1 currently has yellow_block_3. So we can't stack there. Alternatively, stack on another block. Wait, grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3, which we stacked in step 3b. So to stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1, we need to unstack yellow_block_3 first. That complicates things. Alternatively, stack yellow_block_1 on another clear block. Let's see. After step 3c, green_block_2 is being held. Wait, no: step 3c is unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1, so after that, we're holding green_block_2. Then, we can put it down, making it clear. Then, pick up yellow_block_1. But yellow_block_1 is on green_block_1, which is clear after step 1. Wait, after step 1, we unstacked yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1, so yellow_block_1 is clear. So yes, we can unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.

Wait, let's adjust the plan again:

After step 1 (unstack yellow_block_2), step 2 (putdown yellow_block_2), then step 3a: unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2. Then step 3b: stack yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1. Then step 3c: unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. Now holding green_block_2. Then step 3d: putdown green_block_2. Now green_block_2 is on the table, clear. Then, step 4: unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1 (since it's clear). Now holding yellow_block_1. Step 5: stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1. But grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3. So can't stack. So maybe stack yellow_block_1 on green_block_2. Green_block_2 is clear. So stack yellow_block_1 green_block_2. Then, yellow_block_1 is on green_block_2. But this doesn't satisfy the fifth constraint (needs to be on grey_block_1). Hmm. Alternatively, we need to move yellow_block_3 from grey_block_1 to somewhere else, then stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1. Let's see:

After step 3b (yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1), to stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1, we need to unstack yellow_block_3 first. So:

Step 4: unstack yellow_block_3 from grey_block_1. Now holding yellow_block_3.

Step 5: stack yellow_block_3 somewhere else. Maybe on black_block_1? But black_block_1 is clear after step 3c. Wait, step 3c: unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. Then, after that, black_block_1 is clear. So stack yellow_block_3 on black_block_1. Then, step 6: unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1. Then stack on grey_block_1. But this adds more steps. 

This is getting too long. Let me try to see if there's a shorter way. The fifth constraint requires that yellow_block_1 is on grey_block_1 in at least one state. So perhaps during the plan, we can temporarily place yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1 and then move it back. But that adds steps. Alternatively, find a way to place yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1 and keep it there, but that may interfere with other constraints.

Alternatively, after moving yellow_block_3 to grey_block_1 (step 3b), we can unstack it again and stack yellow_block_1 there. But that might complicate the plan.

Alternatively, after step 3b (stack yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1), then unstack yellow_block_3, put it somewhere else, stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1, then put yellow_block_3 back. But this seems too many steps.

Alternatively, during the process of moving black_block_1, maybe stack it on grey_block_1, but then yellow_block_3 is already there. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the fifth constraint can be satisfied by having the arm hold yellow_block_1 and then stack it on grey_block_1, even if temporarily. But to stack on grey_block_1, we need to have grey_block_1 clear. Which is only possible if we first move yellow_block_3. So perhaps:

After step 3b (stack yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1), then step 4: unstack yellow_block_3 from grey_block_1. Now holding yellow_block_3.

Step 5: stack yellow_block_3 on another block. For example, stack on black_block_1. Then step 6: unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1. Then stack on grey_block_1. But then we need to move yellow_block_3 again. This is getting too long.

Alternatively, perhaps the fifth constraint can be satisfied by stacking yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1 after moving yellow_block_3. But given the time constraints, maybe there's a shorter path. Let's think again.

Maybe after unstacking green_block_2 from black_block_1, we can stack black_block_1 on grey_block_1. But grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3. So we can't. Alternatively, stack black_block_1 on yellow_block_3. But yellow_block_3 is on grey_block_1. So stacking black_block_1 on yellow_block_3 would require that yellow_block_3 is clear, which it is. So:

After step 3c (unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1), we have black_block_1 clear on the table. Then step 4: pickup black_block_1. Now holding black_block_1.

Step 5: stack black_block_1 on yellow_block_3. Now black_block_1 is on yellow_block_3, which is on grey_block_1. This makes black_block_1 not on the table, satisfying constraint 4. The goal is achieved because black_block_1 is clear (nothing on top). But also, to satisfy the fifth constraint, we need to have yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1. How?

Alternatively, perhaps we can stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1 after moving yellow_block_2. Let's revisit:

Original plan with sixth constraint satisfied:

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. Now holding yellow_block_2.

2. Putdown yellow_block_2. Now yellow_block_2 is on table. This satisfies the sixth constraint's antecedent.

3. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2. Holding yellow_block_3.

4. Stack yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3.

5. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. Holding green_block_2.

6. Putdown green_block_2. Now green_block_2 is clear. This triggers the sixth constraint, which is satisfied because step 1 happened earlier.

7. Now, need to satisfy fifth constraint: yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1. To do that:

   a. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1. Now holding yellow_block_1.

   b. Stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1. But grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3. So can't stack. So need to unstack yellow_block_3 first.

   c. Unstack yellow_block_3 from grey_block_1. Now holding yellow_block_3.

   d. Putdown yellow_block_3 on table. But constraint 2 says yellow_block_3 can't be on table in any state. So can't do that. So stack yellow_block_3 on another block. Let's say green_block_2.

   e. Stack yellow_block_3 on green_block_2. Now green_block_2 has yellow_block_3. Then stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1.

   f. Now, stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1. This satisfies the fifth constraint.

But this adds several steps. Also, after stacking yellow_block_3 on green_block_2, green_block_2 is not clear, but the goal is to have black_block_1 clear, which it is. However, the plan is getting longer. Is there a way to minimize steps?

Alternatively, after step 6 (putdown green_block_2), pick up yellow_block_1 and stack it on grey_block_1. But grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3. So not possible. Therefore, need to move yellow_block_3 first.

Alternatively, during step 4, instead of stacking yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1, stack it somewhere else where it can be moved again. For example, stack on yellow_block_2, which is on the table. But yellow_block_2 is on the table and clear. So stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2. Then grey_block_1 remains clear. Then, later stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1.

Let's see:

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. Hold YB2.

2. Putdown YB2.

3. Unstack YB3 from GB2. Hold YB3.

4. Stack YB3 on YB2. Now YB2 has YB3.

5. Unstack GB2 from BB1. Hold GB2.

6. Putdown GB2.

7. Unstack YB1 from GB1. Hold YB1.

8. Stack YB1 on grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 has YB1. Satisfies fifth constraint.

9. Now, need to move BB1 off table.

   a. Pickup BB1. Stack on any clear block. For example, stack BB1 on GB2.

So steps 9: pickup BB1. Stack BB1 on GB2.

This way, BB1 is not on the table. The goal is achieved (BB1 is clear). All constraints:

- Constraint 5: step 8.

- Constraint 6: step 6 (GB2 clear), and step 1-2 satisfy the condition.

- Constraint 4: BB1 is not on table in step 9.

- Constraint 2: YB3 is on YB2, not table.

- Constraint 1: grey_block_1 has YB1 in step 8, so the condition "grey_block_1 is on top of YB3" is not true, but "you are holding grey_block_1" is not done. Wait, no: the first constraint requires that at least one state has either holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 is under YB3. In step 4, we stacked YB3 on YB2, so grey_block_1 is not involved there. So step 4 doesn't satisfy the first constraint. Original step 4 was stacking YB3 on YB2, which doesn't involve grey_block_1. So the first constraint is not satisfied. So this approach fails.

So back to the original idea of stacking YB3 on grey_block_1 to satisfy the first constraint. But then moving YB3 again to stack YB1 on grey_block_1.

But this requires more steps. Let's outline:

1. Unstack YB2 from YB1. Hold YB2.

2. Putdown YB2. Now YB2 is on table.

3. Unstack YB3 from GB2. Hold YB3.

4. Stack YB3 on grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 has YB3. Satisfies first constraint.

5. Unstack GB2 from BB1. Hold GB2.

6. Putdown GB2. Now GB2 is clear.

7. Unstack YB1 from GB1. Hold YB1.

8. Need to stack YB1 on grey_block_1. But grey_block_1 has YB3. So:

   a. Unstack YB3 from grey_block_1. Hold YB3.

   b. Stack YB3 somewhere else. For example, stack on BB1 (now on table and clear after step 5).

   c. Then stack YB1 on grey_block_1.

9. Now, stack YB3 on BB1. Then:

   a. Stack YB1 on grey_block_1.

10. Now, BB1 has YB3 on top. So BB1 is not clear. But the goal is to have BB1 clear. So this is a problem. Therefore, need to stack YB3 elsewhere.

Alternative after step 8a (unstack YB3 from grey_block_1):

   b. Stack YB3 on YB2 (which is on table and clear).

   c. Then stack YB1 on grey_block_1.

Now, BB1 is clear (step 5), and in step 10, YB3 is on YB2. Then, step 11: pickup BB1 and stack it somewhere.

But this is getting very long. The optimal plan requires the shortest possible steps. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, the fifth constraint is to have yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1 in at least one state. So even if it's just temporarily, as long as it's in one state. So perhaps after moving YB1 to grey_block_1, then move it back. But that adds steps.

Alternatively, during the process of satisfying other constraints, we can satisfy this. For example, when we unstack YB1 from GB1, carry it and then put it down, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, stack it on grey_block_1 even if just for one step.

But given the time, perhaps the optimal plan is as follows, accepting that it's longer but satisfies all constraints:

The steps would be:

1. Unstack YB2 from YB1.

2. Putdown YB2.

3. Unstack YB3 from GB2.

4. Stack YB3 on grey_block_1.

5. Unstack GB2 from BB1.

6. Putdown GB2.

7. Unstack YB1 from GB1.

8. Unstack YB3 from grey_block_1.

9. Stack YB3 on GB2.

10. Stack YB1 on grey_block_1.

11. Pickup BB1.

12. Stack BB1 on GB2.

This plan has 12 steps. But is there a shorter way?

Alternative approach:

What if after step 4 (stack YB3 on grey_block_1), then proceed to unstack GB2 from BB1 (step5), then putdown GB2 (step6). Then, pickup BB1 (step7), stack on GB2 (step8). Now, BB1 is not on table. Then, unstack YB1 from GB1 (step9), stack on grey_block_1 (step10), but grey_block_1 has YB3. So need to unstack YB3 first (step11), stack YB3 somewhere else (step12), then stack YB1. This is even longer.

Alternatively, find a way to stack YB1 on grey_block_1 without moving YB3. Not possible because YB3 is there.

Hmm. This seems very complicated. Maybe there's a different approach.

Wait, the initial state has yellow_block_3 on green_block_2. To make black_block_1 clear, we need to remove green_block_2. To do that, first remove yellow_block_3. Then unstack green_block_2.

But after moving yellow_block_3 to grey_block_1 (satisfying the first constraint), and then moving green_block_2, then we need to handle black_block_1. Also, the fifth constraint needs yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1. Maybe after moving yellow_block_1, we can stack it on grey_block_1 after moving yellow_block_3.

But I'm stuck. Let's try to outline the plan again, step by step, making sure all constraints are met.

Plan:

1. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1

   - Pre: yellow_block_2 is on yellow_block_1, clear, arm empty.

   - Effect: holding yellow_block_2, yellow_block_1 is clear.

2. putdown yellow_block_2

   - Now yellow_block_2 is on table, clear.

   - This satisfies the sixth constraint's antecedent (yellow_block_2 not on yellow_block_1) in step 2.

3. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2

   - Pre: yellow_block_3 is on green_block_2, clear, arm empty.

4. stack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1

   - Now grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3, satisfying constraint 1.

5. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1

   - Now green_block_2 is held, black_block_1 is clear (goal achieved).

   - In this state, black_block_1 is clear, but it's still on the table. So constraint 4 requires that black_block_1 is not on the table in this state or later. So we need to move it.

6. putdown green_block_2

   - Now green_block_2 is on table, clear. This state satisfies the sixth constraint's condition (green_block_2 clear), which requires that before this state, either holding yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 not on yellow_block_1. Step 2 satisfies this.

7. pickup black_block_1

   - Now holding black_block_1, which is off the table. Satisfies constraint 4.

8. stack black_block_1 green_block_2

   - Now black_block_1 is on green_block_2, clear. Goal remains achieved.

Now, need to satisfy constraint 5: yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1.

9. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1

   - Pre: yellow_block_1 is on green_block_1, clear (since yellow_block_2 was moved in step 1), arm empty.

10. stack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1

    - Pre: grey_block_1 is clear. But grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3 from step4. So cannot stack. So need to unstack yellow_block_3 first.

Hmm, this is a problem. So steps 9-10 are not possible. Therefore, we need to adjust.

Alternative after step 8:

9. unstack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1

   - Now holding yellow_block_3.

10. stack yellow_block_3 black_block_1

    - Since black_block_1 is on green_block_2 and is clear.

11. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1

12. stack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1

But step 10: stacking yellow_block_3 on black_block_1. Now black_block_1 is not clear, so the goal is violated. So can't do that.

Alternatively, stack yellow_block_3 on another block. Like yellow_block_2.

10. stack yellow_block_3 yellow_block_2

    - Now yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_2, which is on the table. So yellow_block_3 is not on table, satisfying constraint 2.

11. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1

12. stack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1

    - Now grey_block_1 is clear (after step9 unstack).

This way, constraint 5 is satisfied in step12.

But this adds steps. The total steps would be 12. Is this the shortest possible?

Let me count the steps:

1. unstack YB2 YB1

2. putdown YB2

3. unstack YB3 GB2

4. stack YB3 grey_block_1

5. unstack GB2 BB1

6. putdown GB2

7. pickup BB1

8. stack BB1 GB2

9. unstack YB3 grey_block_1

10. stack YB3 YB2

11. unstack YB1 GB1

12. stack YB1 grey_block_1

This plan has 12 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way. Let's see.

Alternative plan:

After step8 (stack BB1 GB2), the goal is achieved. The fifth constraint requires YB1 on grey_block_1. But grey_block_1 has YB3. So to stack YB1 on grey_block_1, we need to unstack YB3. But then, if we do that and stack YB3 elsewhere, perhaps in the same step.

Wait, is there a way to satisfy the fifth constraint by having YB1 on grey_block_1 even temporarily?

But in the current plan, after step8, we can't do that without additional steps. So perhaps this is the minimal plan.

But maybe there's a different approach. Let's think again.

What if we don't move YB2 initially? Let's see:

Original goal is to make BB1 clear. The initial state has GB2 on BB1 and YB3 on GB2. So remove YB3 and GB2.

Steps:

1. unstack YB3 GB2

2. stack YB3 grey_block_1 (satisfies constraint1)

3. unstack GB2 BB1

4. putdown GB2 (now GB2 clear, triggering constraint6. But before this, we need to have either holding YB1 or YB2 not on YB1. Since we didn't move YB2, YB2 is still on YB1. So this violates constraint6. So need to address that.

Ah, right. So moving YB2 is necessary to satisfy constraint6. So initial unstack of YB2 is needed.

Thus, the minimal plan must include moving YB2 first.

Therefore, the plan I outlined earlier with 12 steps is necessary. But perhaps there's a shorter path.

Wait, what if after step5 (unstack GB2 BB1), instead of putting GB2 down, we stack it somewhere else. For example, stack GB2 on YB1. But YB1 has YB2 on top. So need to move YB2 first.

Wait, let's try:

1. unstack YB2 YB1

2. putdown YB2

3. unstack YB3 GB2

4. stack YB3 grey_block_1

5. unstack GB2 BB1

6. stack GB2 YB1 (YB1 is clear now after step1)

7. pickup BB1

8. stack BB1 GB2

Now, after step6, GB2 is on YB1. Then, step8 stacks BB1 on GB2. Then, to satisfy constraint5:

9. unstack YB1 GB1 (YB1 is on GB1, but in step6, we stacked GB2 on YB1. So YB1 has GB2 on top. Wait, no. After step6, GB2 is stacked on YB1. So YB1 has GB2 on top. So YB1 is not clear. Therefore, cannot unstack YB1 from GB1.

This approach is invalid.

Hmm. So back to original plan. It seems that the minimal plan would require 12 steps. But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, after step5 (unstack GB2 from BB1), instead of putting it down, use it to satisfy another constraint. For example, stack GB2 on grey_block_1. But grey_block_1 has YB3. So can't do that. 

Alternatively, stack GB2 on YB3. YB3 is on grey_block_1. So stack GB2 on YB3. But that would require YB3 is clear. Yes, after step4, YB3 is on grey_block_1 and clear. So:

5. unstack GB2 BB1

6. stack GB2 YB3

Now, GB2 is on YB3. Then, BB1 is clear (goal achieved). Now, to handle constraint4: BB1 is not on table in some state after initial. So need to move BB1.

7. pickup BB1

8. stack BB1 somewhere, like on GB2 (but GB2 is on YB3). Preconditions: GB2 is clear? No, GB2 has BB1. Wait, no. Stacking BB1 on GB2 requires that GB2 is clear. But after step6, GB2 is on YB3 and clear. So stacking BB1 on GB2 would make GB2 have BB1. Then, BB1 is clear.

But this would require steps:

7. pickup BB1

8. stack BB1 GB2

Now, BB1 is on GB2, which is on YB3. Now, BB1 is clear. The goal is achieved. But also, constraint4 is satisfied because BB1 is not on the table.

Now, for constraint5: YB1 on grey_block_1. Need to stack YB1 there.

YB1 is currently under YB2 (initially), but YB2 was moved to table in step2. So YB1 is on GB1 and clear (since YB2 was removed). So can unstack YB1 and stack on grey_block_1. But grey_block_1 has YB3, which has GB2, which has BB1. So need to unstack YB3, GB2, BB1 first. Not feasible.

Alternative, after step8:

9. unstack YB1 GB1

10. stack YB1 grey_block_1 (can't, since grey_block_1 has YB3)

So need to unstack YB3 first.

This is getting too long again.

Alternatively, perhaps the fifth constraint can be satisfied by holding YB1. But the fifth constraint requires YB1 to be on grey_block_1, not holding. So no.

Given all this, perhaps the minimal plan is 12 steps. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to satisfy the fifth constraint by having YB1 on grey_block_1 during the process of moving other blocks.

Alternatively, during step4, after stacking YB3 on grey_block_1, can we immediately unstack it and stack YB1 there?

For example:

1. unstack YB2 YB1

2. putdown YB2

3. unstack YB3 GB2

4. stack YB3 grey_block_1

5. unstack YB3 grey_block_1

6. stack YB3 somewhere else (e.g., YB2)

7. unstack YB1 GB1

8. stack YB1 grey_block_1

9. unstack GB2 BB1

10. putdown GB2

11. pickup BB1

12. stack BB1 GB2

This plan has 12 steps and satisfies all constraints:

- Constraint1: step4 (YB3 on grey_block_1).

- Constraint2: YB3 is never on table.

- Constraint3: BB1 not on grey_block_1 in initial state and others.

- Constraint4: BB1 is moved in step11-12, not on table.

- Constraint5: step8.

- Constraint6: step10 (GB2 clear), and step1-2 satisfy antecedent.

But this is longer than the previous plan. So perhaps the minimal plan is 12 steps. However, the user wants the optimal (shortest) plan. 

But wait, maybe there's a way to satisfy multiple constraints with fewer steps. Let's think again.

Original problem:

Initial state:

- green_block_1 on table, yellow_block_1 on it, yellow_block_2 on yellow_block_1.

- black_block_1 on table, green_block_2 on it, yellow_block_3 on green_block_2.

- grey_block_1 on table, clear.

Goal: black_block_1 clear.

Constraints:

1. At least one state: hold grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 has YB3.

2. Every state: YB3 not on table.

3. At least one state: BB1 not on grey_block_1 (already true in initial).

4. If BB1 not on grey_block_1 in any state, then BB1 not on table in that or later state.

5. At least one state: YB1 on grey_block_1.

6. At least one state: GB2 clear, and before that, either holding YB1 or YB2 not on YB1.

So, the key is to find a plan that achieves the goal while satisfying all these.

Alternative approach:

- To make BB1 clear, unstack GB2 from BB1. To do that, unstack YB3 from GB2 first.

- Then, unstack GB2 from BB1.

But after that, need to move BB1 to satisfy constraint4.

- Also, satisfy other constraints.

So:

1. unstack YB3 GB2

2. stack YB3 grey_block_1 (constraint1)

3. unstack GB2 BB1 (now BB1 is clear)

4. putdown GB2 (now GB2 clear, constraint6 requires earlier state where YB2 not on YB1 or holding YB1. But this isn't done yet. So need to address constraint6.

So before step4, need to have a state where either YB2 is not on YB1 or holding YB1. So need to move YB2 or YB1 before step4.

Thus:

Insert steps before step3:

1. unstack YB2 YB1

2. putdown YB2 (now YB2 not on YB1)

3. unstack YB3 GB2

4. stack YB3 grey_block_1

5. unstack GB2 BB1

6. putdown GB2 (now GB2 clear, and step2 satisfies constraint6)

7. pickup BB1

8. stack BB1 GB2 (now BB1 not on table)

Now, need to satisfy constraint5: YB1 on grey_block_1.

YB1 is on GB1, clear (since YB2 was moved in step1). So:

9. unstack YB1 GB1

10. stack YB1 grey_block_1 (but grey_block_1 has YB3 from step4. So need to unstack YB3 first.

11. unstack YB3 grey_block_1

12. stack YB3 BB1 (since BB1 is clear after step8)

13. stack YB1 grey_block_1

Now, BB1 has YB3, so BB1 is not clear. So goal is violated. Thus, invalid.

Alternatively, stack YB3 elsewhere.

11. unstack YB3 grey_block_1

12. stack YB3 YB2 (on table)

13. stack YB1 grey_block_1

This way, YB1 is on grey_block_1 (constraint5 satisfied), YB3 is not on table (constraint2), and BB1 is clear (step8).

But steps now total 13. Not optimal.

Alternatively, after step8, BB1 is on GB2, clear. Then, unstack YB3 from grey_block_1 (step9), stack YB3 on BB1 (step10). Now YB3 is on BB1, so BB1 is not clear. Goal violated.

This seems impossible. So the minimal plan must include moving YB1 to grey_block_1, requiring additional steps.

Alternatively, find another way to satisfy constraint5 without moving YB1. For example, if the arm holds YB1 in some state. But constraint5 requires YB1 to be on grey_block_1, not held.

This is very challenging. Perhaps the initial plan with 12 steps is the shortest possible. But I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed to outline the plan that satisfies all constraints, even if it's longer, but perhaps there's a shorter one I'm missing.

Final plan:

```
1. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_2
3. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2
4. stack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1
5. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1
6. putdown green_block_2
7. pickup black_block_1
8. stack black_block_1 green_block_2
9. unstack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1
10. stack yellow_block_3 yellow_block_2
11. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1
12. stack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1
```

This plan has 12 steps. Let's verify all constraints:

- Constraint1: step4 satisfies grey_block_1 has YB3.

- Constraint2: YB3 is never on table.

- Constraint3: initially BB1 is not on grey_block_1.

- Constraint4: BB1 is moved in step7-8, not on table.

- Constraint5: step12 YB1 is on grey_block_1.

- Constraint6: step6 (GB2 clear), and step1-2 made YB2 not on YB1.

So all constraints are satisfied.
