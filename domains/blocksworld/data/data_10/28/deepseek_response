**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2** to clear red_block_2 (satisfies constraints related to red_block_2 being clear and later states).
2. **Putdown green_block_1** to free the arm.
3. **Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1** to address constraints involving brown_block_2 and brown_block_1.
4. **Putdown brown_block_2** to free the arm.
5. **Unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1** to prepare stacking red_block_1 on brown_block_1.
6. **Stack red_block_1 on brown_block_1** (satisfies constraint requiring red_block_1 on brown_block_1).
7. **Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_3** to achieve the goal of clearing brown_block_3.
8. **Stack purple_block_1 on red_block_1** (satisfies constraint involving purple_block_1 on red_block_1).
9. **Pickup green_block_1** to place it on purple_block_1.
10. **Stack green_block_1 on purple_block_1** (ensures purple_block_1 is not clear, fulfilling its constraint).
11. **Pickup red_block_2** to move it off the table.
12. **Stack red_block_2 on brown_block_2** (ensures red_block_2 is not on the table, meeting related constraints).
13. **Pickup brown_block_3** to move it off the table.
14. **Stack brown_block_3 on brown_block_1** (satisfies constraint requiring brown_block_3 on brown_block_1 and ensures itâ€™s not on the table).

This plan efficiently satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal with minimal steps.
