Let's analyze the current state of the world and what we need to achieve.

**Initial state**:
- `white_block_1` is on the table
- `purple_block_1` is on the table
- `blue_block_1` is on top of `white_block_1`
- `red_block_1` is on top of `purple_block_1`
- `grey_block_1` is on the table
- `white_block_2` is on top of `blue_block_1`
- `blue_block_2` is on top of `white_block_2`
- `red_block_1` is clear
- `grey_block_1` is clear
- `blue_block_2` is clear
- No block is being held

So the current towers are:
1. `blue_block_2` on `white_block_2` on `blue_block_1` on `white_block_1` (4-block tower)
2. `red_block_1` on `purple_block_1` (2-block tower)
3. `grey_block_1` (1-block tower)

**Goal state**:
- `blue_block_2` is on the table

So we need to move `blue_block_2` from the top of the 4-block tower to the table.

To do this, we can follow a simple plan:
1. Unstack `blue_block_2` from `white_block_2`
2. Put down `blue_block_2` on the table

Let's formalize this plan:

1. "unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2" - This would pick up `blue_block_2` from the top of `white_block_2`
2. "putdown blue_block_2" - This would place `blue_block_2` on the table

Let's check if this plan satisfies the preconditions and effects of the actions:

For "unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2":
- Precondition (i): `blue_block_2` is on top of `white_block_2` ✓
- Precondition (ii): `blue_block_2` is clear ✓
- Precondition (iii): not holding any block ✓
- Effect (i): `blue_block_2` is no longer on top of `white_block_2` ✓
- Effect (ii): `white_block_2` is clear ✓
- Effect (iii): holding `blue_block_2` ✓

For "putdown blue_block_2":
- Precondition: holding `blue_block_2` ✓
- Effect (i): `blue_block_2` is on the table ✓
- Effect (ii): `blue_block_2` is clear ✓
- Effect (iii): no longer holding any block ✓

Our plan achieves the goal and satisfies all preconditions and effects. Therefore, our optimal plan would be:

unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2
putdown blue_block_2
