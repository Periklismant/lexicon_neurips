This is a complex planning problem in the Blocksworld domain. Let's break it down:

**Initial State:**
- white_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
- blue_block_2 is on top of white_block_2
- red_block_1 is clear
- grey_block_1 is clear
- blue_block_2 is clear
- The robot arm is not holding any block

The initial state can be represented like this (where blocks are stacked from bottom to top):
Table: white_block_1, purple_block_1, grey_block_1
white_block_1: blue_block_1
blue_block_1: white_block_2
white_block_2: blue_block_2
purple_block_1: red_block_1

**Goal State:**
- blue_block_2 is on the table

But we have to satisfy several constraints. Let's analyze each of these constraints:

1. "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" must hold in at least one state
   - This is initially true since red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1.

2. If "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" holds in some state s, then "white_block_2 is on the table" must hold at s or at some state after s
   - Since "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is initially true, we need to ensure that "white_block_2 is on the table" becomes true at some point.

3. "grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" must hold in at least one state
   - This is initially true since grey_block_1 is on the table.

4. If "grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" holds in some state s, then "there is a block on top of red_block_1, i.e., red_block_1 is not clear" must hold at s or at some state after s
   - Since "grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is initially true, we need to ensure that "red_block_1 is not clear" becomes true at some point.

5. "blue_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in at least one state
   - This is initially true since blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1.

6. If "blue_block_1 is not on the table" holds in some state s, then "purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1" must hold at s or at some state after s
   - Since "blue_block_1 is not on the table" is initially true, we need to ensure that "purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1" becomes true at some point.

7. "white_block_2 is clear" must hold in at least one state
   - Initially, white_block_2 is not clear (it has blue_block_2 on top). We need to make it clear at some point.

8. If "white_block_2 is clear" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which "grey_block_1 is not clear" is true
   - Before we can have white_block_2 clear, we need to ensure that grey_block_1 has a block on top of it at some earlier state.

9. "grey_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in at least one state
   - Initially, grey_block_1 is on the table. We need to move it at some point.

10. "blue_block_2 is not clear" must hold in at least one state
    - Initially, blue_block_2 is clear. We need to place a block on top of it at some point.

11. If "blue_block_2 is not clear" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which either "red_block_1 is not clear" or "you are holding white_block_2" is true
    - Before we can place a block on top of blue_block_2, we need to ensure that either red_block_1 has a block on top of it or we are holding white_block_2.

12. "you are holding white_block_1" must hold in at least one state
    - We need to pick up white_block_1 at some point.

13. "blue_block_1 is clear" and "white_block_2 is on top of red_block_1" must hold simultaneously in at least one state
    - We need to arrange the blocks such that blue_block_1 is clear and white_block_2 is on top of red_block_1 at the same time.

14. Either "blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_2" or "purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1" must hold in at least one state
    - We need to ensure that at least one of these conditions becomes true at some point.

15. "white_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2" must hold in at least one state
    - This is initially true since white_block_1 is on the table.

16. If "white_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2" holds in some state s, then "purple_block_1 is not on the table" must hold at s or at some state after s
    - Since "white_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2" is initially true, we need to ensure that "purple_block_1 is not on the table" becomes true at some point.

Now, let's use the constraints to formulate a plan. Our goal is to have blue_block_2 on the table, but we need to satisfy all the constraints along the way.

First, let me try to determine which constraints are already satisfied in the initial state:
- Constraint 1: satisfied (red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1, not white_block_1)
- Constraint 3: satisfied (grey_block_1 is on the table, not on top of white_block_1)
- Constraint 5: satisfied (blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, not on the table)
- Constraint 15: satisfied (white_block_1 is on the table, not on top of blue_block_2)

Now, let's determine which constraints need to be satisfied during the plan:
- Constraint 2: We need to put white_block_2 on the table
- Constraint 4: We need to put a block on top of red_block_1
- Constraint 6: We need to put purple_block_1 on top of grey_block_1
- Constraint 7: We need to make white_block_2 clear (i.e., remove blue_block_2 from it)
- Constraint 8: Before making white_block_2 clear, we need to have grey_block_1 not clear (i.e., with a block on top)
- Constraint 9: We need to move grey_block_1 from the table
- Constraint 10: We need to put a block on top of blue_block_2
- Constraint 11: Before putting a block on top of blue_block_2, we need to either have red_block_1 not clear or be holding white_block_2
- Constraint 12: We need to hold white_block_1 at some point
- Constraint 13: We need to have blue_block_1 clear and white_block_2 on top of red_block_1 simultaneously
- Constraint 14: We need to either have blue_block_1 on top of white_block_2 or purple_block_1 on top of grey_block_1
- Constraint 16: We need to move purple_block_1 from the table

I'll start by formulating a plan to satisfy these constraints and reach the goal.

Initial configuration:
Table: white_block_1, purple_block_1, grey_block_1
white_block_1: blue_block_1
blue_block_1: white_block_2
white_block_2: blue_block_2
purple_block_1: red_block_1

Goal: blue_block_2 is on the table

1. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2 (This makes white_block_2 clear, satisfying constraint 7, but we first need to ensure that grey_block_1 is not clear to satisfy constraint 8)

To satisfy constraint 8, we need to put a block on top of grey_block_1 first.

Let's try a different approach. Let's first look at constraints that form chains, such as 11 (before making blue_block_2 not clear, we need either red_block_1 not clear or be holding white_block_2) and 10 (we need to make blue_block_2 not clear).

To satisfy constraint 11, we can either place a block on red_block_1 or hold white_block_2. To satisfy constraint 4, we need to place a block on red_block_1. So we'll go with that.

Let's try a structured plan:

Step 1: Satisfy constraint 8 (grey_block_1 not clear)
- Action: stack some block on grey_block_1

Step 2: Satisfy constraint 7 (white_block_2 clear)
- Action: unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2

Step 3: Satisfy constraint 4 and 11 (red_block_1 not clear)
- Action: stack some block on red_block_1

Step 4: Satisfy constraint 10 (blue_block_2 not clear)
- Action: stack some block on blue_block_2

Step 5: Satisfy constraint 12 (holding white_block_1)
- Action: unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1, then pickup white_block_1

Step 6: Satisfy constraint 13 (blue_block_1 clear and white_block_2 on red_block_1)
- Actions: ensure blue_block_1 is clear, then stack white_block_2 on red_block_1

Step 7: Satisfy constraint 14 (blue_block_1 on white_block_2 or purple_block_1 on grey_block_1)
- Action: stack either blue_block_1 on white_block_2 or purple_block_1 on grey_block_1

Step 8: Satisfy constraint 16 (purple_block_1 not on table)
- Action: pickup purple_block_1 from table

Step 9: Satisfy constraint 2 (white_block_2 on table)
- Action: putdown white_block_2 on table

Step 10: Satisfy constraint 6 (purple_block_1 on grey_block_1)
- Action: stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1

Step 11: Satisfy constraint 9 (grey_block_1 not on table)
- Action: pickup grey_block_1 from table

Step 12: Achieve the goal (blue_block_2 on table)
- Action: putdown blue_block_2 on table

I need to resolve the dependencies between these steps and create a coherent plan. Let me see if I can come up with an actual sequence of actions that satisfies all the constraints and reaches the goal.

Let's think about this more systematically. I'll start by identifying the easiest constraints to satisfy and work towards the goal.

First, let's analyze the goal: blue_block_2 needs to be on the table. Currently, it's on top of white_block_2, which is on top of blue_block_1, which is on top of white_block_1. So we need to remove it from white_block_2 and place it on the table.

To do this, we need to satisfy constraint 10 (blue_block_2, not clear) first, which depends on constraint 11 (red_block_1 not clear or holding white_block_2).

Let's try a stepwise approach:

1. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2 (to make blue_block_2 available for our goal)
2. Now white_block_2 is clear, but to satisfy constraint 8, we need to have had grey_block_1 not clear in an earlier state.
   So we need to stack something on grey_block_1 first.
3. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1 (to get a block we can stack on grey_block_1)
4. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1 (to make grey_block_1 not clear, satisfying constraint 8)
5. Now we can proceed with making white_block_2 clear (already done in step 1).
6. To satisfy constraint 4, we need to have red_block_1 not clear.
   But we just used red_block_1 to satisfy constraint 8!
   Ok, we need to have some block on top of red_block_1, but the block can change over time.

Ok, let's try a different approach. 

In the initial state:
- white_block_1 is on the table with blue_block_1 on top
- blue_block_1 has white_block_2 on top
- white_block_2 has blue_block_2 on top
- purple_block_1 is on the table with red_block_1 on top
- grey_block_1 is on the table and is clear
- blue_block_2, red_block_1, and grey_block_1 are clear
- The arm is not holding anything

To accomplish our goal of having blue_block_2 on the table, we need to perform at least the following steps:
- unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2
- putdown blue_block_2 on the table

But to satisfy all the constraints, we need to be more careful with the ordering of actions.

Let's try to formulate a plan that satisfies all constraints and reaches the goal.

Wait, I think I should focus more on constraint 13, which requires blue_block_1 to be clear and white_block_2 to be on top of red_block_1 simultaneously.

In the initial state:
- blue_block_1 is not clear (white_block_2 is on top of it)
- white_block_2 is not on top of red_block_1 (it's on top of blue_block_1)

So to satisfy constraint 13, we need to:
1. Remove white_block_2 from blue_block_1 (making blue_block_1 clear)
2. Place white_block_2 on top of red_block_1

To satisfy constraint 7, we need to have white_block_2 clear:
3. Remove blue_block_2 from white_block_2 (making white_block_2 clear)

But constraint 8 requires that before white_block_2 is clear, grey_block_1 must not be clear:
4. Place some block on top of grey_block_1 (making it not clear)

Let's see if we can formulate a plan.

1. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2 (to make white_block_2 clear for future steps)
2. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1 (to get a block we can stack on grey_block_1)
3. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1 (to make grey_block_1 not clear, satisfying constraint 8)
4. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1 (to make blue_block_1 clear for constraint 13)
5. unstack red_block_1 grey_block_1 (to make red_block_1 available for constraint 13)
6. stack white_block_2 red_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 13: blue_block_1 is clear and white_block_2 is on top of red_block_1)
7. pickup purple_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 16)
8. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 6 and 14)
9. unstack white_block_2 red_block_1 (to free white_block_2 for constraint 2)
10. putdown white_block_2 (to satisfy constraint 2: white_block_2 on table)
11. stack red_block_1 white_block_2 (to satisfy constraint 4: red_block_1 not clear)
12. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1 (to free white_block_1 for constraint 12)
13. pickup white_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 12: holding white_block_1)
14. putdown white_block_1 (releasing white_block_1)
15. stack white_block_1 blue_block_2 (to satisfy constraint 10: blue_block_2 not clear)
16. unstack white_block_1 blue_block_2 (to free blue_block_2 for the goal)
17. putdown white_block_1 (releasing white_block_1)
18. pickup blue_block_2 (to move blue_block_2 to the table)
19. putdown blue_block_2 (to achieve the goal: blue_block_2 on table)

Wait, there's an issue with the above plan. Step 11 doesn't work because red_block_1 won't be clear after step 9. Let's revise the plan.

Wait, I'm forgetting something. Constraint 4 requires that if "grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" holds in some state (which is initially true), then "red_block_1 is not clear" must hold at that state or at some later state. Also, constraint 9 requires that grey_block_1 is not on the table in at least one state.

Let me try to formulate a more coherent plan.

Actually, let me think about this problem from a different angle. Let me create a plan from the goal state backwards.

We want to end with blue_block_2 on the table. In the initial state, blue_block_2 is on top of white_block_2, which is on top of blue_block_1, which is on top of white_block_1. So we need to unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2 and put it on the table. Let's see how we can satisfy the constraints while doing this.

Wait, I noticed constraint 11 again: Before making blue_block_2 not clear, we need to either have red_block_1 not clear or be holding white_block_2. Combined with constraint 10 which requires blue_block_2 to not be clear at some point.

Also, constraint 7 and 8 together require us to first make grey_block_1 not clear and then make white_block_2 clear.

Let me create a plan that satisfies all constraints.

I think a good way to come up with a valid plan is to list the constraints and dependencies, and then choose an ordering that satisfies everything. Since some constraints require conditions to hold before or after certain states.

For instance:
- Constraint 8: Before "white_block_2 is clear", we need "grey_block_1 is not clear"
- Constraint 11: Before "blue_block_2 is not clear", we need either "red_block_1 is not clear" or "you are holding white_block_2"

Before we can do any action, we need to understand the dependencies between the constraints.

Let me re-outline a plan that tries to satisfy all constraints.

1. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2 (to free blue_block_2 for our goal)
2. pickup grey_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 9: grey_block_1 not on table)
3. putdown grey_block_1 (releasing grey_block_1)
4. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1 (to prepare for constraint 4)
5. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1 (to make grey_block_1 not clear, satisfying constraint 8)
6. pickup purple_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 16)
7. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 6 and 14)
8. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1 (to make blue_block_1 clear and to free white_block_2)
9. stack white_block_2 purple_block_1 (to temporarily hold white_block_2)
10. unstack purple_block_1 grey_block_1 (to make red_block_1 available for constraint 13)
11. putdown purple_block_1 (releasing purple_block_1)
12. unstack red_block_1 grey_block_1 (to make red_block_1 available for constraint 13)
13. unstack white_block_2 purple_block_1 (to make white_block_2 available for constraint 13)
14. stack white_block_2 red_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 13: blue_block_1 is clear and white_block_2 is on top of red_block_1)
15. putdown red_block_1 (to release red_block_1 for other constraints)
16. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 6 and 14 again)
17. unstack white_block_2 red_block_1 (to free white_block_2 for constraint 2)
18. putdown white_block_2 (to satisfy constraint 2: white_block_2 on table)
19. pickup white_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 12: holding white_block_1)
20. stack white_block_1 blue_block_2 (to satisfy constraint 10: blue_block_2 not clear)
21. unstack white_block_1 blue_block_2 (to free blue_block_2 for the goal)
22. putdown white_block_1 (releasing white_block_1)
23. putdown blue_block_2 (to achieve the goal: blue_block_2 on table)

But again, I'm finding several issues with this plan. Let me consider the constraints more carefully and come up with a coherent plan.

Ok, the tricky part seems to be satisfying constraint 11: before putting a block on top of blue_block_2, we need to ensure that either red_block_1 is not clear or we're holding white_block_2. Let's focus on this.

Currently:
- blue_block_2 is on top of white_block_2
- white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1

Constraint 11: Before making blue_block_2 not clear, we need either red_block_1 not clear or be holding white_block_2.

We need to put something on top of blue_block_2 (constraint 10) but before we can do that, we need red_block_1 not clear or be holding white_block_2 (constraint 11).

Ok, let me approach this differently. Let me focus on satisfying each constraint in a systematic manner. 

1. Constraint 8: Before white_block_2 is clear, grey_block_1 must not be clear.
   - In the initial state, white_block_2 is not clear (blue_block_2 is on it)
   - If we make white_block_2 clear, we'd first need grey_block_1 to not be clear
   - So, before unstacking blue_block_2 from white_block_2, we need to stack something on grey_block_1

2. Constraint 11: Before blue_block_2 is not clear, either red_block_1 is not clear or we are holding white_block_2.
   - In the initial state, blue_block_2 is clear
   - If we want to make blue_block_2 not clear (as required by constraint 10), we first need red_block_1 not clear or be holding white_block_2
   - So, before stacking something on blue_block_2, we need to either stack something on red_block_1 or be holding white_block_2

Let's step through the plan more methodically, starting from the initial state and focusing on these constraints.

From the initial state:
1. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1 (to free red_block_1)
2. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1 (to make grey_block_1 not clear, satisfying constraint 8)
3. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2 (now we can make white_block_2 clear, satisfying constraint 7)
4. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1 (to free white_block_2 for other steps)
5. putdown white_block_2 (to satisfy constraint 2: white_block_2 on table)
6. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1 (to free white_block_1 for constraint 12)
7. stack blue_block_1 white_block_2 (to satisfy part of constraint 14)
8. pickup white_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 12: holding white_block_1)
9. stack white_block_1 blue_block_1 (to temporarily hold white_block_1)
10. unstack red_block_1 grey_block_1 (to free red_block_1 for constraint 13)
11. pickup purple_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 16: purple_block_1 not on table)
12. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 6 and part of constraint 14)
13. unstack white_block_1 blue_block_1 (to free white_block_1)
14. putdown white_block_1 (releasing white_block_1)
15. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_2 (to free blue_block_1)
16. stack blue_block_1 red_block_1 (to make red_block_1 not clear, satisfying constraint 4 and part of constraint 11)
17. pickup white_block_2 (to free white_block_2 for constraint 13)
18. stack white_block_2 red_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 13: blue_block_1 is clear and white_block_2 is on top of red_block_1)
19. stack white_block_1 blue_block_2 (to satisfy constraint 10: blue_block_2 not clear)
20. unstack white_block_1 blue_block_2 (to free blue_block_2 for the goal)
21. putdown white_block_1 (releasing white_block_1)
22. putdown blue_block_2 (to achieve the goal: blue_block_2 on table)

Wait, there's an issue with the plan. 

I just realized that our plan is actually inconsistent from step 16 onwards.

At step 15, we've just relocated blue_block_1 from white_block_2 to red_block_1.

But at step 16, we can't stack blue_block_1 on red_block_1 because there's no blue_block_1 available (it's still on white_block_2). And there's no red_block_1 available either (it should be on or near grey_block_1).

Ok, I think I was going too fast. Let me be more deliberate and track the state after each step.

Let's redefine our plan carefully, again:
Initial state:
- white_block_1 is on the table with blue_block_1 on top
- blue_block_1 has white_block_2 on top
- white_block_2 has blue_block_2 on top
- purple_block_1 is on the table with red_block_1 on top
- grey_block_1 is on the table and is clear
- blue_block_2, red_block_1, and grey_block_1 are clear
- The arm is not holding anything

Our constraints:
C1: red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 (initially satisfied)
C2: After red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, white_block_2 must be on the table
C3: grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 (initially satisfied)
C4: After grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, red_block_1 must not be clear
C5: blue_block_1 is not on the table (initially satisfied)
C6: After blue_block_1 is not on the table, purple_block_1 must be on top of grey_block_1
C7: white_block_2 is clear in at least one state
C8: Before white_block_2 is clear, grey_block_1 must not be clear
C9: grey_block_1 is not on the table in at least one state
C10: blue_block_2 is not clear in at least one state
C11: Before blue_block_2 is not clear, either red_block_1 is not clear or we are holding white_block_2
C12: We are holding white_block_1 in at least one state
C13: blue_block_1 is clear and white_block_2 is on top of red_block_1 simultaneously in at least one state
C14: Either blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_2 or purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 in at least one state
C15: white_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2 (initially satisfied)
C16: After white_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2, purple_block_1 must not be on the table

Our plan, with constraints satisfied at each step:
1. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1 (to free red_block_1 for later steps)
2. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1 (to make grey_block_1 not clear, satisfying C8)
3. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2 (to make white_block_2 clear, satisfying C7)
4. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1 (to make blue_block_1 clear for C13)
5. stack white_block_2 red_block_1 (to satisfy C13: blue_block_1 is clear and white_block_2 is on top of red_block_1)
6. pickup purple_block_1 (to satisfy C16)
7. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1 (to satisfy C6 and C14)
8. pickup white_block_2 (to satisfy part of C11)
9. putdown white_block_2 (to satisfy C2)
10. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1 (to free white_block_1 for C12)
11. pickup white_block_1 (to satisfy C12)
12. stack white_block_1 blue_block_2 (to satisfy C10)
13. unstack purple_block_1 grey_block_1 (to free grey_block_1 for C9)
14. pickup grey_block_1 (to satisfy C9)
15. putdown grey_block_1 (releasing grey_block_1)
16. unstack white_block_1 blue_block_2 (to free blue_block_2 for the goal)
17. putdown white_block_1 (releasing white_block_1)
18. putdown blue_block_2 (to achieve the goal)

But I just realized that we're still missing constraint C4: After grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, red_block_1 must not be clear.

In the initial state, grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1. This means red_block_1 must not be clear at some point. But in our plan, we've stacked white_block_2 on red_block_1 (step 5) and then unstacked white_block_2 from red_block_1 (step 8), meaning red_block_1 becomes clear again. We need to ensure that red_block_1 remains not clear.

Let's refine our plan:

1. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1 (to free red_block_1 for later steps)
2. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1 (to make grey_block_1 not clear, satisfying C8)
3. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2 (to make white_block_2 clear, satisfying C7)
4. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1 (to make blue_block_1 clear for C13)
5. stack white_block_2 red_block_1 (to satisfy C13: blue_block_1 is clear and white_block_2 is on top of red_block_1)
6. pickup purple_block_1 (to satisfy C16)
7. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1 (to satisfy C6 and C14)
8. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1 (to free white_block_1 for C12 and to use blue_block_1 to keep red_block_1 not clear)
9. stack blue_block_1 white_block_2 (to keep red_block_1 not clear, satisfying C4)
10. pickup white_block_1 (to satisfy C12)
11. stack white_block_1 blue_block_2 (to satisfy C10)
12. unstack purple_block_1 grey_block_1 (to free grey_block_1 for C9)
13. pickup grey_block_1 (to satisfy C9)
14. putdown grey_block_1 (releasing grey_block_1)
15. unstack white_block_1 blue_block_2 (to free blue_block_2 for the goal)
16. putdown white_block_1 (releasing white_block_1)
17. putdown blue_block_2 (to achieve the goal)

But it's still not right since at step 9, white_block_2 is already stacked on something else (red_block_1), not on the table.

Step 8, we free white_block_1 by unstacking blue_block_1 from it. Before step 8, blue_block_1 is on white_block_1, white_block_2 is on red_block_1, and red_block_1 is on grey_block_1.

For step 9, we can't stack blue_block_1 on white_block_2, because white_block_2 is already on red_block_1. So there must be some mix-up in the steps. Let's revise the plan again.

Let me reorganize the plan and keep track of the state after each action to ensure consistency.

Initial state:
Table: white_block_1, purple_block_1, grey_block_1
white_block_1: blue_block_1
blue_block_1: white_block_2
white_block_2: blue_block_2
purple_block_1: red_block_1
Arm: empty (not holding any block)

1. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
   - Table: white_block_1, purple_block_1, grey_block_1
   - white_block_1: blue_block_1
   - blue_block_1: white_block_2
   - white_block_2: blue_block_2
   - Arm: red_block_1

2. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1
   - Table: white_block_1, purple_block_1, grey_block_1
   - white_block_1: blue_block_1
   - blue_block_1: white_block_2
   - white_block_2: blue_block_2
   - grey_block_1: red_block_1
   - Arm: empty

3. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2
   - Table: white_block_1, purple_block_1, grey_block_1
   - white_block_1: blue_block_1
   - blue_block_1: white_block_2
   - grey_block_1: red_block_1
   - Arm: blue_block_2

4. putdown blue_block_2
   - Table: white_block_1, purple_block_1, grey_block_1, blue_block_2
   - white_block_1: blue_block_1
   - blue_block_1: white_block_2
   - grey_block_1: red_block_1
   - Arm: empty

5. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1
   - Table: white_block_1, purple_block_1, grey_block_1, blue_block_2
   - white_block_1: blue_block_1
   - grey_block_1: red_block_1
   - Arm: white_block_2

6. stack white_block_2 red_block_1
   - Table: white_block_1, purple_block_1, grey_block_1, blue_block_2
   - white_block_1: blue_block_1
   - grey_block_1: red_block_1
   - red_block_1: white_block_2
   - Arm: empty

   Now we've achieved constraint 13 (blue_block_1 is clear and white_block_2 is on top of red_block_1).

7. pickup purple_block_1
   - Table: white_block_1, grey_block_1, blue_block_2
   - white_block_1: blue_block_1
   - grey_block_1: red_block_1
   - red_block_1: white_block_2
   - Arm: purple_block_1

8. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1
   - Table: white_block_1, grey_block_1, blue_block_2
   - white_block_1: blue_block_1
   - grey_block_1: red_block_1, purple_block_1
   - red_block_1: white_block_2
   - Arm: empty

9. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
   - Table: white_block_1, grey_block_1, blue_block_2
   - grey_block_1: red_block_1, purple_block_1
   - red_block_1: white_block_2
   - Arm: blue_block_1

10. putdown blue_block_1
    - Table: white_block_1, grey_block_1, blue_block_2, blue_block_1
    - grey_block_1: red_block_1, purple_block_1
    - red_block_1: white_block_2
    - Arm: empty

11. pickup white_block_1
    - Table: grey_block_1, blue_block_2, blue_block_1
    - grey_block_1: red_block_1, purple_block_1
    - red_block_1: white_block_2
    - Arm: white_block_1

12. stack white_block_1 blue_block_2
    - Table: grey_block_1, blue_block_2, blue_block_1
    - grey_block_1: red_block_1, purple_block_1
    - red_block_1: white_block_2
    - blue_block_2: white_block_1
    - Arm: empty

13. unstack purple_block_1 grey_block_1
    - Table: grey_block_1, blue_block_2, blue_block_1
    - grey_block_1: red_block_1
    - red_block_1: white_block_2
    - blue_block_2: white_block_1
    - Arm: purple_block_1

14. putdown purple_block_1
    - Table: grey_block_1, blue_block_2, blue_block_1, purple_block_1
    - grey_block_1: red_block_1
    - red_block_1: white_block_2
    - blue_block_2: white_block_1
    - Arm: empty

15. pickup grey_block_1
    - Table: blue_block_2, blue_block_1, purple_block_1
    - grey_block_1: red_block_1
    - red_block_1: white_block_2
    - blue_block_2: white_block_1
    - Arm: grey_block_1 (but this is impossible since grey_block_1 has red_block_1 on it)

Oops, I can't pick up grey_block_1 as it's not clear (red_block_1 is on it). Let me rethink this plan.

Ok, let me reorganize once again, focusing on satisfying all the constraints.

Initial state:
Table: white_block_1, purple_block_1, grey_block_1
white_block_1: blue_block_1
blue_block_1: white_block_2
white_block_2: blue_block_2
purple_block_1: red_block_1
Arm: empty

1. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
   - C4: red_block_1 is not clear in the initial state, so this constraint is satisfied.

2. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1
   - C8: grey_block_1 is not clear now, which is required before making white_block_2 clear.

3. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2
   - C7: white_block_2 is now clear.
   - C11: Before making blue_block_2 not clear, we need red_block_1 not clear or be holding white_block_2. Red_block_1 is not clear (it's under white_block_2).

4. putdown blue_block_2
   - This puts blue_block_2 on the table, which is our goal.

But I just noticed a mistake. Constraint 11 says "if blue_block_2 is not clear holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which red_block_1 is not clear or you are holding white_block_2". This is a temporal constraint, not a precondition for an action.

Ok, let's continue with this setup:
1. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
2. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1
3. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2
4. putdown blue_block_2

Now at this point:
Table: white_block_1, purple_block_1, grey_block_1, blue_block_2
white_block_1: blue_block_1
blue_block_1: white_block_2
grey_block_1: red_block_1
Arm: empty

5. pickup purple_block_1
   - This satisfies constraint 16: After white_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2, purple_block_1 must not be on the table.

6. stack purple_block_1 red_block_1
   - This satisfies constraint 4: After grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, red_block_1 must not be clear.

7. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1
   - This frees white_block_2 for the next step.

8. putdown white_block_2
   - This satisfies constraint 2: After red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, white_block_2 must be on the table.

9. pickup white_block_1
   - This satisfies constraint 12: You are holding white_block_1.

10. stack white_block_1 blue_block_2
    - This satisfies constraint 10: blue_block_2 is not clear.

Wait, hold on. There seems to be a lot of inconsistencies in the plan. Let's back up and be more precise.

Initial state:
Table: white_block_1, purple_block_1, grey_block_1
white_block_1: blue_block_1
blue_block_1: white_block_2
white_block_2: blue_block_2
purple_block_1: red_block_1
Arm: empty

1. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
   After this:
   Table: white_block_1, purple_block_1, grey_block_1
   white_block_1: blue_block_1
   blue_block_1: white_block_2
   white_block_2: blue_block_2
   Arm: red_block_1

2. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1
   After this:
   Table: white_block_1, purple_block_1, grey_block_1
   white_block_1: blue_block_1
   blue_block_1: white_block_2
   white_block_2: blue_block_2
   grey_block_1: red_block_1
   Arm: empty

3. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2
   After this:
   Table: white_block_1, purple_block_1, grey_block_1
   white_block_1: blue_block_1
   blue_block_1: white_block_2
   grey_block_1: red_block_1
   Arm: blue_block_2

4. putdown blue_block_2
   After this:
   Table: white_block_1, purple_block_1, grey_block_1, blue_block_2
   white_block_1: blue_block_1
   blue_block_1: white_block_2
   grey_block_1: red_block_1
   Arm: empty

5. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1
   After this:
   Table: white_block_1, purple_block_1, grey_block_1, blue_block_2
   white_block_1: blue_block_1
   grey_block_1: red_block_1
   Arm: white_block_2

6. stack white_block_2 red_block_1
   After this:
   Table: white_block_1, purple_block_1, grey_block_1, blue_block_2
   white_block_1: blue_block_1
   grey_block_1: red_block_1
   red_block_1: white_block_2
   Arm: empty

7. pickup purple_block_1
   After this:
   Table: white_block_1, grey_block_1, blue_block_2
   white_block_1: blue_block_1
   grey_block_1: red_block_1
   red_block_1: white_block_2
   Arm: purple_block_1

8. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1
   After this:
   Table: white_block_1, grey_block_1, blue_block_2
   white_block_1: blue_block_1
   grey_block_1: purple_block_1
   purple_block_1: red_block_1
   red_block_1: white_block_2
   Arm: empty

Wait, I just realized we can't stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1 on step 8, because grey_block_1 already has red_block_1 on it. I think our plan has inconsistencies because we're not modeling the constraints correctly.
