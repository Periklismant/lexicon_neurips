Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld problem. So the goal is to make sure that yellow_block_1 is clear. Right now, in the initial state, purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1. So the main thing I need to do is remove purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1. But how do I do that?

First, let me recall the actions available. To remove a block that's on top of another, I can use the unstack action. Wait, but unstack requires that the block (purple_block_1) is clear. In the initial state, purple_block_1 is clear, so that's good. Also, the robotic arm must not be holding anything. Which it isn't, according to the initial state.

So the first step would be to unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1. That action would result in the arm holding purple_block_1, and yellow_block_1 becomes clear. Then I need to put down purple_block_1 somewhere. But where? The constraints might not specify where to put it, just that yellow_block_1 is clear. So maybe put it on the table?

But wait, the problem says to provide an optimal plan, so the shortest possible. Let's think.

The initial state has purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1. The goal is that yellow_block_1 is clear. So the only necessary action is to unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1 and then put it down. Wait, no, because unstacking requires that after the action, the arm is holding purple_block_1. Then to put it down, you need to perform putdown. But wait, the unstack action gives that the arm is holding the block. So the sequence would be:

1. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
2. putdown purple_block_1

But after unstacking, the arm is holding purple_block_1. Then putting it down on the table would make purple_block_1 clear and on the table. That satisfies the goal because yellow_block_1 is clear. But wait, the goal is only that yellow_block_1 is clear. So after the first action, unstack, yellow_block_1 is already clear. But then why do we need to put down purple_block_1? Because the arm is holding it, but the problem doesn't say anything about the arm needing to not hold anything at the end. The constraints are just about the goal state. Wait, the problem says "bring about the goal of the problem while satisfying all constraints." The constraints here are the ones mentioned, but looking back, the user wrote:

"A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:"

But then there's no additional constraints listed. Wait, looking back at the original problem statement. The user provided the initial state, the goal, and mentioned constraints. But in the actual problem, after the goal, the constraints section just says "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but nothing else. So maybe there are no additional constraints except the preconditions of the actions. So the plan just needs to achieve the goal state, regardless of where other blocks are, as long as the actions are valid.

Wait, but in the problem statement, after the original state, the task is to bring about that yellow_block_1 is clear. So the goal is only that. So, after unstacking purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1, the yellow_block_1 is clear. So the arm is holding purple_block_1. But the problem doesn't require the arm to be empty at the end. So maybe the plan can just be unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1. Then the goal is achieved, because yellow_block_1 is clear, even if the arm is holding a block. But wait, the problem says "the final goal is a situation", which is that there's no block on top of yellow_block_1. So the arm's state doesn't matter as long as the goal is met. However, the problem's initial state says that the arm is not holding any block, but the goal doesn't specify that the arm must be empty. Therefore, the minimal plan would be to unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1, and that's it. Because after that, yellow_block_1 is clear, even though the arm is holding purple_block_1. But is that allowed?

Wait, the problem says "you are a robotic arm that can hold at most one block at a time." So the arm can be holding a block at the end. The goal doesn't require the arm to be empty. So in that case, the optimal plan would be just the unstack action. But wait, the unstack action's preconditions are:

For unstack x y: x is on y, x is clear, and arm is empty. So in the initial state, purple_block_1 is on yellow_block_1, and it's clear. The arm is empty. So unstack is possible. After unstack, the arm is holding purple_block_1, and yellow_block_1 is clear. So the goal is achieved. Therefore, the plan is just one action: unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1. But wait, the problem's initial state also has other blocks. For example, blue_block_1 is under yellow_block_1, which is under purple_block_1. Wait, the initial state says:

- black_block_1 is on table.

- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1.

- yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1.

- purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1.

So the stack is black_block_1 (on table), blue_block_1 on it, yellow on blue, purple on yellow. So the initial tower is black_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 -> purple_block_1.

So to make yellow_block_1 clear, we need to remove purple_block_1 from it. So the unstack action would do that. Then the arm holds purple_block_1. Since the goal doesn't require putting it anywhere else, just that yellow is clear, the plan can be just the unstack. But that's only one action. However, maybe the problem requires that all blocks are on the table or properly stacked? But the problem doesn't state that. The goal is only about yellow_block_1 being clear.

Wait, but let me check the effects again. After unstack, purple_block_1 is no longer on yellow_block_1, so the goal is achieved. So the plan would be just that action. But maybe the problem expects that the arm must not be holding anything at the end? But the original problem's initial state says the arm is empty, but the goal doesn't specify that. So perhaps the minimal plan is indeed just the unstack. But maybe there's a constraint that the arm must be empty at the end? But the user didn't mention that. Let me check the problem statement again.

The user wrote: "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then there's nothing written. Wait, looking back, the user's problem statement might have a formatting error. Let me check again.

Wait, the problem statement says: "The task is to bring about the following situation: 'there is no block on top of yellow_block_1, i.e., yellow_block_1 is clear' A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:"

But there's no listed constraints. Maybe a formatting error. So perhaps the user intended to list constraints but forgot. Alternatively, perhaps the constraints are the usual ones, i.e., the preconditions of actions. So assuming that, then the minimal plan is unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1. But in that case, the arm is holding the purple block. But the problem doesn't require the arm to be empty. So that's acceptable.

But wait, perhaps in the Blocksworld domain, the standard assumption is that the arm must not be holding any block at the end. But the problem didn't state that. So if the problem allows the arm to be holding a block at the end, then the minimal plan is one action. If not, then we need to put it down, making the plan two actions: unstack and putdown.

But according to the problem statement, the goal is just about the blocks' positions, not the arm's state. So the minimal plan would be the unstack action alone. However, I need to confirm whether the problem allows the arm to be holding a block in the final state. Since the initial state has the arm empty, but the goal doesn't mention the arm, it's possible that the arm can be holding a block. Therefore, the optimal plan would be just unstack.

But wait, let's check the problem statement again. The user wrote: "your task is to provide a valid sequence of actions that solves the planning problem, i.e., bringing about the goal of the problem while satisfying all constraints." The constraints are not listed, but perhaps the constraints are the preconditions of the actions, which must be satisfied during execution. The final state just needs to have the goal achieved, regardless of the arm's state. Therefore, the plan is unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1.

However, in standard Blocksworld problems, sometimes the goal implicitly requires the arm to be empty. But since the problem doesn't mention that, I think the optimal plan is just the unstack. But maybe I'm missing something. Let's think again.

In the initial state, the arm is empty. After unstack, the arm is holding purple_block_1. The goal is achieved. So the plan is valid. But perhaps the problem expects that all actions must end with the arm empty. But unless that's specified, it's not required. So the optimal plan is one action.

Wait, but maybe the problem has a typo and the constraints were meant to be written but were omitted. But given the information, I need to proceed with what's provided. Therefore, the answer is just the unstack action. But let me check the initial state again. The initial state has purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1. The goal is to have purple_block_1 not on yellow_block_1. So the unstack action achieves that. However, if the arm is holding it, then in the final state, purple_block_1 is in the air, so not on any block or table, which is allowed as long as the goal is met. But in the Blocksworld, usually, blocks must be on the table or on another block. So maybe the problem considers that the arm holding a block is part of the state, but the goal is only about blocks' positions. Therefore, it's acceptable.

But wait, the problem's definition says that the arm can hold a block. So the state includes whether the arm is holding a block. The goal only specifies that yellow_block_1 is clear. Therefore, the minimal plan is indeed one action.

However, maybe the user intended that the arm must be empty at the end. For example, in the initial state, the arm is empty, but the goal doesn't mention it. But that's not stated. So perhaps the correct answer is just the unstack action. But I'm not sure. Let me consider possible alternative steps.

If I unstack and then putdown, that would make purple_block_1 on the table, which is also acceptable, and the arm is empty. But that's two actions. But if the problem allows the arm to hold it, then one action is better. But how to know?

Looking back at the problem's description of the actions. The effects of unstack are: (i) b1 is no longer on b2, (ii) b2 is clear, (iii) the arm is holding b1. So after unstack, the arm is holding the block. The goal is that yellow_block_1 is clear. So after the unstack, the goal is achieved. Therefore, the plan can stop there.

But in standard planning problems, the arm is usually required to be empty at the end, but since this isn't specified here, I have to go with the given problem. Therefore, the optimal plan is just one action: unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1.

But wait, let me check the initial state again. The initial state says that purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1. So unstacking purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1 is possible because purple_block_1 is clear (as per initial state), and the arm is empty. So yes, unstack is possible. Then, after that, the goal is achieved. So the plan is just that action.

But maybe the problem's goal is to have yellow_block_1 clear, but also all blocks must be on the table or on another block, not in the air. But according to the problem's description, the arm can hold a block, which is considered a valid state. So the final state after unstack has the arm holding the block, but the goal is satisfied.

Therefore, the optimal plan is:

```
unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
```

But I'm a bit uncertain because typically, in Blocksworld problems, you need to place the block somewhere. However, since the problem's goal doesn't require it, I think this is acceptable. So the answer is that single action.
