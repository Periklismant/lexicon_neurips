Alright, I'm given a blocksworld planning problem, with a set of objects, initial state, goal state, and constraints. Let's break down the problem:

**Objects:**
- black_block_1, red_block_1, blue_block_1, black_block_2, yellow_block_1, black_block_3, purple_block_1

**Initial State:**
- black_block_1 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- black_block_3 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- black_block_2 is clear
- black_block_3 is clear
- purple_block_1 is clear
- I'm not holding any block

Visually, in the initial state, we have the following configuration:
```
     purple_block_1         black_block_2         black_block_3
           |                     |
     yellow_block_1              |
           |                     |
      blue_block_1               |
           |                     |
     black_block_1          red_block_1
         table                 table                table
```

**Goal State:**
- yellow_block_1 is clear

This seems simple at first: just remove purple_block_1 from the top of yellow_block_1. However, there are a lot of constraints to consider.

Let's analyze the constraints:

1. "you are holding purple_block_1" must be true in at least one state.
2. Before "you are holding purple_block_1" becomes true, "black_block_2 is on the table" must be true.
3. "there is a block on top of purple_block_1, i.e., purple_block_1 is not clear" must be true in at least one state.
4. Before "there is a block on top of purple_block_1, i.e., purple_block_1 is not clear" becomes true, "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding purple_block_1", "there is a block on top of black_block_2, i.e., black_block_2 is not clear"" must be true.
5. "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding yellow_block_1", "blue_block_1 is on the table"" must be true in at least one state.
6. "At least one of the following conditions is true: "black_block_1 is not on the table", "blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2"" must be true in at least one state.
7. "purple_block_1 is not on the table" must be true in at least one state.
8. At or after a state where "purple_block_1 is not on the table" is true, "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding black_block_2", "there is no block on top of red_block_1, i.e., red_block_1 is clear"" must be true.
9. "you are holding red_block_1" must be true in at least one state.
10. "yellow_block_1 is not on the table" must be true in at least one state. (This is already true in the initial state.)
11. At or after a state where "yellow_block_1 is not on the table" is true, "At least one of the following conditions is true: "there is no block on top of red_block_1, i.e., red_block_1 is clear", "black_block_3 is on top of red_block_1"" must be true.
12. "black_block_1 is on top of black_block_3" must be true in at least one state.
13. "black_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1" must be true in at least one state.
14. At or after a state where "black_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1" is true, "there is no block on top of purple_block_1, i.e., purple_block_1 is clear" must be true. (This is already true in the initial state since purple_block_1 is clear and black_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1.)
15. "there is a block on top of blue_block_1, i.e., blue_block_1 is not clear" must be true in at least one state. (This is already true in the initial state.)
16. At or after a state where "there is a block on top of blue_block_1, i.e., blue_block_1 is not clear" is true, "yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_3" must be true.

Oh, I realize that about half of the constraints are already satisfied in the initial state. For instance, constraint 10 "yellow_block_1 is not on the table" is true initially since yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1. However, the second part of this constraint says that at some point after, red_block_1 should be clear OR black_block_3 should be on top of red_block_1. Currently, neither of these are true because black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1.

Let's identify constraints that are already satisfied in the initial state:
10. "yellow_block_1 is not on the table" is true initially.
13. "black_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1" is true initially.
15. "there is a block on top of blue_block_1, i.e., blue_block_1 is not clear" is true initially.

Let's identify which of the follow-up constraints are already satisfied:
14. Since "black_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1" is true initially, at some point "there is no block on top of purple_block_1, i.e., purple_block_1 is clear" should be true. This is also true initially.

Okay, so constraints 10, 13, 14, and 15 are already satisfied. We still need to address the remaining constraints.

Let's think about these constraints and how we can satisfy them. I'll organize them based on the order I think we should address them:

2. Put black_block_2 on the table.
1. Hold purple_block_1. (Requires removing it from the top of yellow_block_1, which is already towards our goal.)
4. Make sure either we're holding purple_block_1 or black_block_2 is not clear, before we make purple_block_1 not clear.
3. At some point, purple_block_1 should not be clear. (This means we should place some block on top of it.)
7. At some point, purple_block_1 should not be on the table.
8. At or after a state where "purple_block_1 is not on the table" is true, we should either hold black_block_2 or red_block_1 should be clear.
9. At some point, we should hold red_block_1.
11. At or after a state where "yellow_block_1 is not on the table" is true, either red_block_1 should be clear or black_block_3 should be on top of red_block_1.
12. At some point, black_block_1 should be on top of black_block_3.
16. At or after a state where "there is a block on top of blue_block_1, i.e., blue_block_1 is not clear" is true, yellow_block_1 should be on top of black_block_3.
5. At some point, either we should hold yellow_block_1 or blue_block_1 should be on the table.
6. At some point, either black_block_1 should not be on the table or blue_block_1 should be on top of black_block_2.

Now, let's design a plan to address these constraints.

Given we need to eventually have yellow_block_1 clear, we need to remove purple_block_1 from the top of yellow_block_1.

Key steps might be:
1. Put black_block_2 on the table (to satisfy constraint 2).
2. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (to satisfy constraints 1 and 7, and progress toward the goal).
3. ...

But we need a more coherent plan. Let's try to map out a full plan that satisfies all constraints. Let me try to build a plan:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. (Now holding black_block_2)
2. Putdown black_block_2 on the table. (Satisfies constraint 2 and the first part of constraint 4)
3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 1 and moves toward our goal of making yellow_block_1 clear)
4. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_2. (Satisfies constraint 7 and makes it so that purple_block_1 is not on the table)
5. Unstack black_block_2 from the table. (Now holding black_block_2, which satisfies part of constraint 8 after constraint 7 is satisfied)
6. Stack black_block_2 on purple_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 3. Also, since we were holding purple_block_1 before, it satisfies the second part of constraint 4 before constraint 3 is satisfied)
7. Unstack black_block_3 from the table. (Now holding black_block_3)
8. Stack black_block_3 on red_block_1. (Satisfies part of constraint 11 after constraint 10 is satisfied)
9. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1. (Now holding blue_block_1)
10. Putdown blue_block_1 on the table. (Satisfies constraint 5)
11. Unstack black_block_1 from the table. (Now holding black_block_1)
12. Stack black_block_1 on black_block_3. (Satisfies constraint 12)
13. Unstack yellow_block_1 from the table. (Now holding yellow_block_1, which also satisfies constraint 5)
14. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_3. (Satisfies constraint 16 after constraint 15 is satisfied)
15. Unstack black_block_2 from purple_block_1. (Now purple_block_1 is clear, which satisfies constraint 14 after constraint 13 is satisfied. Now holding black_block_2.)
16. Stack black_block_2 on blue_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 6)
17. Unstack red_block_1 from the table. (Satisfies constraint 9)
18. Putdown red_block_1 on the table.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in my plan. Let me reconsider the sequences.

If I unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1, I'd be holding blue_block_1. But, blue_block_1 is not initially on black_block_1; it's yellow_block_1 that's on blue_block_1. Let me revise the plan.

Initial state:
```
     purple_block_1         black_block_2         black_block_3
           |                     |
     yellow_block_1              |
           |                     |
      blue_block_1               |
           |                     |
     black_block_1          red_block_1
         table                 table                table
```

Plan:
1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. (Now holding black_block_2)
2. Putdown black_block_2 on the table. (Satisfies constraint 2 and the first part of constraint 4)
3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 1 and moves toward our goal of making yellow_block_1 clear)
4. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_2. (Satisfies constraint 7 and makes it so that purple_block_1 is not on the table)
5. Unstack black_block_3 from the table. (Now holding black_block_3)
6. Stack black_block_3 on purple_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 3. Since we were holding purple_block_1 earlier, it satisfies the second part of constraint 4 before constraint 3 is satisfied)
7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1. (Now holding yellow_block_1, which satisfies constraint 5)
8. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_3. (Satisfies constraint 16 after constraint 15 is satisfied)
9. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1. (Now holding blue_block_1)
10. Putdown blue_block_1 on the table. (This, along with holding yellow_block_1 earlier, satisfies constraint 5)
11. Unstack black_block_1 from the table. (Now holding black_block_1)
12. Stack black_block_1 on black_block_3. (Black_block_1 is on top of black_block_3, but black_block_3 is on top of purple_block_1, and we can't have this chain because then black_block_1 would be on top of black_block_3, not black_block_1)

Wait, I think I messed up the structure. Let me rethink. In the original state, black_block_1 is on the table, and blue_block_1 is on top of it. Then, yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1, and purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1. Separately, red_block_1 is on the table with black_block_2 on top, and black_block_3 is separately on the table and clear.

Let me redraw the initial state:

```
     purple_block_1         black_block_2         black_block_3
           |                     |
     yellow_block_1              |
           |                     |
      blue_block_1               |
           |                     |
     black_block_1          red_block_1
         table                 table                table
```

Okay, that's the same as I drew before. Let me rethink the plan:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. (Now holding black_block_2)
2. Putdown black_block_2 on the table. (Satisfies constraint 2 and the first part of constraint 4)
3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 1 and moves toward our goal of making yellow_block_1 clear)
4. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_2. (Satisfies constraint 7 and makes it so that purple_block_1 is not on the table)
5. Unstack black_block_3 from the table. (Now holding black_block_3)
6. Stack black_block_3 on purple_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 3. Since we were holding purple_block_1 earlier, it satisfies the second part of constraint 4 before constraint 3 is satisfied)
7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1. (Now holding yellow_block_1, which satisfies constraint 5)
8. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_3. (Satisfies constraint 16 after constraint 15 is satisfied)

Wait, I realized we don't have to stack in the same order as the original towers. Let me re-approach the problem from a different angle.

Okay, we need to satisfy all the constraints and end up with yellow_block_1 being clear.

1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. (Now red_block_1 is clear.)
2. Putdown black_block_2 on the table. (Satisfies constraint 2)
3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 1 and moves toward our goal of making yellow_block_1 clear)

At this point, we've satisfied a few constraints and made yellow_block_1 clear, which is our goal. But we still need to address many other constraints.

4. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_2. (Satisfies constraint 7 and makes it so that purple_block_1 is not on the table. Also, since red_block_1 is now clear, it satisfies constraint 8 after constraint 7)
5. Unstack black_block_3 from the table. (Now holding black_block_3)
6. Stack black_block_3 on purple_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 3. Since we were holding purple_block_1 earlier, it satisfies the second part of constraint 4 before constraint 3 is satisfied)
7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1. (Now holding yellow_block_1, which satisfies constraint 5)
8. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_3. (Satisfies constraint 16 after constraint 15 is satisfied)
9. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1. (Now holding blue_block_1)
10. Stack blue_block_1 on black_block_2. (Satisfies constraint 6 and maintains constraint 5 since we already held yellow_block_1)
11. Unstack black_block_1 from the table. (Now holding black_block_1)
12. Stack black_block_1 on red_block_1. (This is a temporary step)
13. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1. (Now holding black_block_1)
14. Stack black_block_1 on black_block_3. (Satisfies constraint 12)
15. Unstack red_block_1 from the table. (Satisfies constraint 9)
16. Putdown red_block_1 on the table.

That's strange. I don't think I'm approaching this correctly. Let me reread the constraints and make sure I've addressed all of them:

1. "you are holding purple_block_1" must be true in at least one state. ✅
2. Before "you are holding purple_block_1" becomes true, "black_block_2 is on the table" must be true. ✅
3. "there is a block on top of purple_block_1, i.e., purple_block_1 is not clear" must be true in at least one state. (We satisfiy this by putting black_block_3 on top of purple_block_1) ✅
4. Before "there is a block on top of purple_block_1, i.e., purple_block_1 is not clear" becomes true, "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding purple_block_1", "there is a block on top of black_block_2, i.e., black_block_2 is not clear"" must be true. (We've satisfied this by holding purple_block_1 before making it not clear) ✅
5. "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding yellow_block_1", "blue_block_1 is on the table"" must be true in at least one state. (We satisfy this by holding yellow_block_1) ✅
6. "At least one of the following conditions is true: "black_block_1 is not on the table", "blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2"" must be true in at least one state. (We satisfy this by stacking blue_block_1 on black_block_2) ✅
7. "purple_block_1 is not on the table" must be true in at least one state. (We satisfy this by stacking purple_block_1 on black_block_2) ✅
8. At or after a state where "purple_block_1 is not on the table" is true, "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding black_block_2", "there is no block on top of red_block_1, i.e., red_block_1 is clear"" must be true. (After we stack purple_block_1 on black_block_2, red_block_1 is clear) ✅
9. "you are holding red_block_1" must be true in at least one state. (We satisfy this by unstacking red_block_1 from the table) ✅
10. "yellow_block_1 is not on the table" must be true in at least one state. (This is true already in the initial state) ✅
11. At or after a state where "yellow_block_1 is not on the table" is true, "At least one of the following conditions is true: "there is no block on top of red_block_1, i.e., red_block_1 is clear", "black_block_3 is on top of red_block_1"" must be true. (After we unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1, red_block_1 is clear) ✅
12. "black_block_1 is on top of black_block_3" must be true in at least one state. (We satisfy this by stacking black_block_1 on black_block_3. But we've already stacked black_block_3 on purple_block_1, and yellow_block_1 on black_block_3. So this would create a chain: black_block_1 -> black_block_3 -> yellow_block_1 -> purple_block_1 -> black_block_2. But this seems achievable.) ✅
13. "black_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1" must be true in at least one state. (This is true in the initial state) ✅
14. At or after a state where "black_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1" is true, "there is no block on top of purple_block_1, i.e., purple_block_1 is clear" must be true. (Initially, both conditions are true) ✅
15. "there is a block on top of blue_block_1, i.e., blue_block_1 is not clear" must be true in at least one state. (This is true in the initial state) ✅
16. At or after a state where "there is a block on top of blue_block_1, i.e., blue_block_1 is not clear" is true, "yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_3" must be true. (We satisfy this by stacking yellow_block_1 on black_block_3) ✅

Hmm, I think we're missing something in our plan. Let's reorganize and be more careful.

Actually, I'm realizing now that I can't stack black_block_1 on black_block_3 if yellow_block_1 is already on black_block_3. Let me revise the plan.

Starting from the initial state:
```
     purple_block_1         black_block_2         black_block_3
           |                     |
     yellow_block_1              |
           |                     |
      blue_block_1               |
           |                     |
     black_block_1          red_block_1
         table                 table                table
```

1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. (Now red_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraints 8 and 11.)
2. Putdown black_block_2 on the table. (Satisfies constraint 2)
3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 1, and yellow_block_1 is now clear, which is our goal.)
4. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_2. (Satisfies constraint 7)
5. Unstack black_block_3 from the table. (Now holding black_block_3)
6. Stack black_block_3 on purple_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 3. Since we were holding purple_block_1 earlier, it satisfies constraint 4.)
7. Unstack black_block_1 from the table. (Now holding black_block_1)
8. Stack black_block_1 on red_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 6, since black_block_1 is no longer on the table.)
9. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1. (Now holding yellow_block_1, satisfying constraint 5.)
10. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_3. (Satisfies constraint 16 after constraint 15.)
11. Unstack blue_block_1 from the table. (Now holding blue_block_1)
12. Stack blue_block_1 on black_block_1. (This is a temporary step to clear the blue_block_1.)
13. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1. (Now holding black_block_1)
14. Putdown black_block_1 on the table. (Now black_block_1 is on the table and clear.)
15. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1. (Now holding blue_block_1)
16. Stack blue_block_1 on black_block_2. (Satisfies constraint 6)
17. Unstack black_block_1 from the table. (Now holding black_block_1)
18. Stack black_block_1 on black_block_3. (Satisfies constraint 12)
19. Unstack red_block_1 from the table. (Satisfies constraint 9)
20. Putdown red_block_1 on the table.

Wait, there's a logical flaw in the above plan. If in step 10, we stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_3, and in step 18, we stack black_block_1 on black_block_3, then we have two blocks on top of black_block_3, which violates the rules of Blocksworld. Let me rethink the plan.

Let's rewrite the plan to make sure everything is consistent:

Starting from the initial state:
```
     purple_block_1         black_block_2         black_block_3
           |                     |
     yellow_block_1              |
           |                     |
      blue_block_1               |
           |                     |
     black_block_1          red_block_1
         table                 table                table
```

1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. (Now red_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraints 8 and 11.)
2. Putdown black_block_2 on the table. (Satisfies constraint 2)
3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 1, and yellow_block_1 is now clear, which is our goal. But we need to continue to satisfy all constraints.)
4. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_2. (Satisfies constraint 7)
5. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1. (Now holding yellow_block_1, satisfying constraint 5.)
6. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_3. (Satisfies constraint 16 after constraint 15.)
7. Unstack black_block_3 from the table. (Now holding black_block_3, with yellow_block_1 on top)
8. Stack black_block_3 on purple_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 3. Since we were holding purple_block_1 earlier, it satisfies constraint 4.)
9. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1. (Now holding blue_block_1)
10. Stack blue_block_1 on black_block_2. (Satisfies constraint 6)
11. Unstack black_block_1 from the table. (Now holding black_block_1)
12. Stack black_block_1 on yellow_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 12 via transitivity, since black_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, which is on top of black_block_3)
13. Unstack red_block_1 from the table. (Satisfies constraint 9)
14. Putdown red_block_1 on the table.

Oh, there's still a logical flaw. In Blocksworld, "black_block_1 is on top of black_block_3" means directly on top, not transitively. Let me rethink the plan.

Alright, let's make a fresh plan, keeping in mind all the constraints:

Starting from the initial state:
```
     purple_block_1         black_block_2         black_block_3
           |                     |
     yellow_block_1              |
           |                     |
      blue_block_1               |
           |                     |
     black_block_1          red_block_1
         table                 table                table
```

1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. (Now red_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraints 8 and 11.)
2. Putdown black_block_2 on the table. (Satisfies constraint 2)
3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 1, and yellow_block_1 is now clear, which is our goal. But we need to continue to satisfy all constraints.)
4. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_2. (Satisfies constraint 7)
5. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1. (Now holding yellow_block_1, satisfying constraint 5.)
6. Putdown yellow_block_1 on the table. (Now yellow_block_1 is clear and on the table.)
7. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1. (Now holding blue_block_1)
8. Stack blue_block_1 on black_block_2. (Satisfies constraint 6)
9. Unstack black_block_1 from the table. (Now holding black_block_1)
10. Stack black_block_1 on black_block_3. (Satisfies constraint 12)
11. Unstack black_block_1 from black_block_3. (Now holding black_block_1)
12. Putdown black_block_1 on the table. (black_block_1 is now clear and on the table)
13. Unstack black_block_3 from the table. (Now holding black_block_3)
14. Stack black_block_3 on purple_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 3. Since we were holding purple_block_1 earlier, it satisfies constraint 4.)
15. Unstack yellow_block_1 from the table. (Now holding yellow_block_1)
16. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_3. (Satisfies constraint 16 after constraint 15.)
17. Unstack red_block_1 from the table. (Satisfies constraint 9)
18. Putdown red_block_1 on the table.

Wait, in this plan, I have yellow_block_1 on top of black_block_3, but by the end, yellow_block_1 should be clear. I'm getting confused. Let me restate the goal to make sure I've understood it correctly.

Goal: "there is no block on top of yellow_block_1, i.e., yellow_block_1 is clear".

This means we want yellow_block_1 to not have any blocks on top of it. In the initial state, purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, so we need to remove it.

I think I'm overthinking this. Let's be more systematic. The goal is to have yellow_block_1 clear, and we need to satisfy all the constraints.

Starting from the initial state:
```
     purple_block_1         black_block_2         black_block_3
           |                     |
     yellow_block_1              |
           |                     |
      blue_block_1               |
           |                     |
     black_block_1          red_block_1
         table                 table                table
```

Let's unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1 to make yellow_block_1 clear. But before that, we need to satisfy constraint 2: before "you are holding purple_block_1" becomes true, "black_block_2 is on the table" must be true.

1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. (Now red_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraints 8 and 11 if applicable.)
2. Putdown black_block_2 on the table. (Satisfies constraint 2, allowing us to now hold purple_block_1.)
3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 1, and yellow_block_1 is now clear, which is our goal.)

Now, we can technically stop here since yellow_block_1 is clear, but we still need to satisfy many other constraints.

4. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_2. (Satisfies constraint 7)
5. Unstack black_block_3 from the table. (Now holding black_block_3)
6. Stack black_block_3 on purple_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 3. Since we were holding purple_block_1 earlier, it satisfies constraint 4 before constraint 3.)
7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1. (Now holding yellow_block_1, satisfying constraint 5.)
8. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_3. (Satisfies constraint 16 after constraint 15.)
9. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1. (Now holding blue_block_1)
10. Stack blue_block_1 on black_block_2. (Satisfies constraint 6)
11. Unstack black_block_1 from the table. (Now holding black_block_1)
12. Stack black_block_1 on red_block_1. (This serves as an intermediate step.)
13. Unstack yellow_block_1 from black_block_3. (Now holding yellow_block_1)
14. Putdown yellow_block_1 on the table. (Now yellow_block_1 is clear and on the table.)
15. Unstack black_block_3 from purple_block_1. (Now holding black_block_3)
16. Putdown black_block_3 on the table. (black_block_3 is now clear and on the table.)
17. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1. (Now holding black_block_1)
18. Stack black_block_1 on black_block_3. (Satisfies constraint 12)
19. Unstack red_block_1 from the table. (Satisfies constraint 9)
20. Putdown red_block_1 on the table.

I believe this plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal. Let's double-check each constraint:

1. "you are holding purple_block_1" must be true in at least one state. ✅ (At step 3)
2. Before "you are holding purple_block_1" becomes true, "black_block_2 is on the table" must be true. ✅ (Step 2 happens before step 3)
3. "there is a block on top of purple_block_1, i.e., purple_block_1 is not clear" must be true in at least one state. ✅ (At step 6)
4. Before "there is a block on top of purple_block_1, i.e., purple_block_1 is not clear" becomes true, "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding purple_block_1", "there is a block on top of black_block_2, i.e., black_block_2 is not clear"" must be true. ✅ (Step 3 happens before step 6)
5. "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding yellow_block_1", "blue_block_1 is on the table"" must be true in at least one state. ✅ (At step 7)
6. "At least one of the following conditions is true: "black_block_1 is not on the table", "blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2"" must be true in at least one state. ✅ (At step 10)
7. "purple_block_1 is not on the table" must be true in at least one state. ✅ (At step 4)
8. At or after a state where "purple_block_1 is not on the table" is true, "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding black_block_2", "there is no block on top of red_block_1, i.e., red_block_1 is clear"" must be true. ✅ (After step 4, red_block_1 is clear)
9. "you are holding red_block_1" must be true in at least one state. ✅ (At step 19)
10. "yellow_block_1 is not on the table" must be true in at least one state. ✅ (Initial state and after step 8)
11. At or after a state where "yellow_block_1 is not on the table" is true, "At least one of the following conditions is true: "there is no block on top of red_block_1, i.e., red_block_1 is clear", "black_block_3 is on top of red_block_1"" must be true. ✅ (After the initial state, red_block_1 is clear from step 1)
12. "black_block_1 is on top of black_block_3" must be true in at least one state. ✅ (At step 18)
13. "black_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1" must be true in at least one state. ✅ (Initial state)
14. At or after a state where "black_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1" is true, "there is no block on top of purple_block_1, i.e., purple_block_1 is clear" must be true. ✅ (Initial state and after step 15)
15. "there is a block on top of blue_block_1, i.e., blue_block_1 is not clear" must be true in at least one state. ✅ (Initial state)
16. At or after a state where "there is a block on top of blue_block_1, i.e., blue_block_1 is not clear" is true, "yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_3" must be true. ✅ (After the initial state, yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_3 from step 8)

All constraints are satisfied, and the goal is achieved.

But wait, let me revisit the plan to ensure it's step-by-step correct. Starting from the initial state:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. (This makes red_block_1 clear.)
2. Putdown black_block_2 on the table.
3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (This makes yellow_block_1 clear, achieving our goal.)
4. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_2.
5. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1. (Now holding yellow_block_1)
6. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_3. (Satisfies constraint 16 after constraint 15.)
7. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1. (Now holding blue_block_1)
8. Stack blue_block_1 on black_block_2. (Satisfies constraint 6)
9. Unstack black_block_1 from the table. (Now holding black_block_1)
10. Stack black_block_1 on red_block_1. (This serves as an intermediate step.)
11. Unstack black_block_3 from the table. (Now holding black_block_3, with yellow_block_1 on top)

Hold on, at step 11, black_block_3 has yellow_block_1 on top after step 6. I can't unstack black_block_3 from the table because it's not clear. Let me revise the plan again.

Starting from the initial state:
```
     purple_block_1         black_block_2         black_block_3
           |                     |
     yellow_block_1              |
           |                     |
      blue_block_1               |
           |                     |
     black_block_1          red_block_1
         table                 table                table
```

1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. (This makes red_block_1 clear.)
2. Putdown black_block_2 on the table.
3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (This makes yellow_block_1 clear, achieving our goal.)
4. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_2.
5. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1. (Now holding yellow_block_1)
6. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_3. (Satisfies constraint 16 after constraint 15.)
7. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1. (Now holding blue_block_1)
8. Stack blue_block_1 on black_block_2. (Satisfies constraint 6)
9. Unstack black_block_1 from the table. (Now holding black_block_1)
10. Stack black_block_1 on red_block_1. (This serves as an intermediate step.)
11. Unstack yellow_block_1 from black_block_3. (Now holding yellow_block_1)
12. Putdown yellow_block_1 on the table. (Now yellow_block_1 is clear and on the table.)
13. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1. (Now holding black_block_1)
14. Stack black_block_1 on black_block_3. (Satisfies constraint 12)
15. Unstack black_block_3 from the table. (Now holding black_block_3, with black_block_1 on top)
16. Stack black_block_3 on purple_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 3. Since we were holding purple_block_1 earlier, it satisfies constraint 4 before constraint 3.)
17. Unstack red_block_1 from the table. (Satisfies constraint 9)
18. Putdown red_block_1 on the table.

But wait, at step 15, I'd be stacking black_block_3 onto purple_block_1, and black_block_3 would have black_block_1 on top. This seems wrong. Let me fix the plan.

Starting from the initial state:
```
     purple_block_1         black_block_2         black_block_3
           |                     |
     yellow_block_1              |
           |                     |
      blue_block_1               |
           |                     |
     black_block_1          red_block_1
         table                 table                table
```

1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. (This makes red_block_1 clear.)
2. Putdown black_block_2 on the table.
3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (This makes yellow_block_1 clear, achieving our goal.)
4. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_2.
5. Unstack black_block_3 from the table. (Now holding black_block_3)
6. Stack black_block_3 on purple_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 3. Since we were holding purple_block_1 earlier, it satisfies constraint 4.)
7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1. (Now holding yellow_block_1, satisfying constraint 5.)
8. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_3. (Satisfies constraint 16 after constraint 15.)
9. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1. (Now holding blue_block_1)
10. Stack blue_block_1 on black_block_2. (Satisfies constraint 6)
11. Unstack black_block_1 from the table. (Now holding black_block_1)
12. Stack black_block_1 on red_block_1. (This serves as an intermediate step.)
13. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1. (Now holding black_block_1)
14. Putdown black_block_1 on the table.
15. Unstack yellow_block_1 from black_block_3. (Now holding yellow_block_1)
16. Putdown yellow_block_1 on the table.
17. Unstack black_block_3 from purple_block_1. (Now holding black_block_3)
18. Putdown black_block_3 on the table.
19. Unstack black_block_1 from the table. (Now holding black_block_1)
20. Stack black_block_1 on black_block_3. (Satisfies constraint 12)
21. Unstack red_block_1 from the table. (Satisfies constraint 9)
22. Putdown red_block_1 on the table.

I'm overthinking again. I think I should be simplifying.

First, let me determine the optimal plan to make yellow_block_1 clear (our main goal):
1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.
2. Putdown black_block_2 on the table.
3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (Yellow_block_1 is now clear, which is our goal.)

This should be the optimal plan to achieve just the goal, but we need to ensure all other constraints are met. Let's analyze again and make our plan more efficient.

Alright, let's step back and approach this more systematically. We need to satisfy all constraints and reach the goal of making yellow_block_1 clear.

Let's first handle the main goal of making yellow_block_1 clear, and then handle each constraint.

Starting from the initial state:
```
     purple_block_1         black_block_2         black_block_3
           |                     |
     yellow_block_1              |
           |                     |
      blue_block_1               |
           |                     |
     black_block_1          red_block_1
         table                 table                table
```

1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. (Makes red_block_1 clear, satisfying constraint 11 since yellow_block_1 is not on the table.)
2. Putdown black_block_2 on the table. (Satisfies constraint 2, allowing us to hold purple_block_1.)
3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (Makes yellow_block_1 clear, achieving our goal, and satisfies constraint 1.)
4. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_2. (Satisfies constraint 7.)
5. Stack black_block_1 on black_block_3. (Satisfies constraint 12.)

Wait, at step 5, we'd be holding black_block_1, but that's not possible. Let me redo this:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. (Makes red_block_1 clear, satisfying constraint 11 since yellow_block_1 is not on the table.)
2. Putdown black_block_2 on the table. (Satisfies constraint 2, allowing us to hold purple_block_1.)
3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (Makes yellow_block_1 clear, achieving our goal, and satisfies constraint 1.)
4. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_2. (Satisfies constraint 7.)
5. Unstack black_block_3 from the table. (Now holding black_block_3.)
6. Stack black_block_3 on purple_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 3, and since we were holding purple_block_1 earlier, it satisfies constraint 4.)
7. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1. (Now holding blue_block_1.)
8. Stack blue_block_1 on black_block_2. (Satisfies constraint 6.)
9. Unstack black_block_1 from the table. (Now holding black_block_1.)
10. Stack black_block_1 on black_block_3. (Satisfies constraint 12.)
11. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 5, since we're holding yellow_block_1.)
12. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 16 through transitivity, though I'm not sure if that's how it works in blocksworld.)
13. Unstack red_block_1 from the table. (Satisfies constraint 9.)
14. Putdown red_block_1 on the table.

Actually, I think I'm still making an error. In step 11, I'm trying to unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1, but blue_block_1 isn't below yellow_block_1 anymore; blue_block_1 is on black_block_2.

Let me restate the world state at each step:

Starting state:
```
     purple_block_1         black_block_2         black_block_3
           |                     |
     yellow_block_1              |
           |                     |
      blue_block_1               |
           |                     |
     black_block_1          red_block_1
         table                 table                table
```

1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.
   - Holding black_block_2
   - Red_block_1 is clear
   - Yellow_block_1 under purple_block_1, and above blue_block_1
   - Black_block_1 on table
   - Black_block_3 on table

2. Putdown black_block_2 on the table.
   - Not holding anything
   - Black_block_2 on table and clear
   - Red_block_1 on table and clear
   - Yellow_block_1 under purple_block_1, and above blue_block_1
   - Black_block_1 on table
   - Black_block_3 on table

3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1.
   - Holding purple_block_1
   - Yellow_block_1 on blue_block_1 and clear
   - Black_block_2 on table and clear
   - Red_block_1 on table and clear
   - Black_block_1 on table and under blue_block_1
   - Black_block_3 on table and clear

4. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_2.
   - Not holding anything
   - Purple_block_1 on black_block_2 and clear
   - Yellow_block_1 on blue_block_1 and clear
   - Red_block_1 on table and clear
   - Black_block_1 on table and under blue_block_1
   - Black_block_3 on table and clear

5. Unstack black_block_3 from the table.
   - Holding black_block_3
   - Purple_block_1 on black_block_2 and clear
   - Yellow_block_1 on blue_block_1 and clear
   - Red_block_1 on table and clear
   - Black_block_1 on table and under blue_block_1

6. Stack black_block_3 on purple_block_1.
   - Not holding anything
   - Black_block_3 on purple_block_1 and clear
   - Purple_block_1 on black_block_2 and under black_block_3
   - Yellow_block_1 on blue_block_1 and clear
   - Red_block_1 on table and clear
   - Black_block_1 on table and under blue_block_1

7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1.
   - Holding yellow_block_1
   - Black_block_3 on purple_block_1 and clear
   - Purple_block_1 on black_block_2 and under black_block_3
   - Blue_block_1 on black_block_1 and clear
   - Red_block_1 on table and clear
   - Black_block_1 on table and under blue_block_1

8. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_3.
   - Not holding anything
   - Yellow_block_1 on black_block_3 and clear
   - Black_block_3 on purple_block_1 and under yellow_block_1
   - Purple_block_1 on black_block_2 and under black_block_3
   - Blue_block_1 on black_block_1 and clear
   - Red_block_1 on table and clear
   - Black_block_1 on table and under blue_block_1

9. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1.
   - Holding blue_block_1
   - Yellow_block_1 on black_block_3 and clear
   - Black_block_3 on purple_block_1 and under yellow_block_1
   - Purple_block_1 on black_block_2 and under black_block_3
   - Black_block_1 on table and clear
   - Red_block_1 on table and clear
   - Black_block_2 on table and under purple_block_1

10. Stack blue_block_1 on black_block_2.
    - Not holding anything
    - Yellow_block_1 on black_block_3 and clear
    - Black_block_3 on purple_block_1 and under yellow_block_1
    - Purple_block_1 on black_block_2 and under black_block_3
    - Blue_block_1 on black_block_2 and clear
    - Black_block_1 on table and clear
    - Red_block_1 on table and clear

Wait, this doesn't make sense. If blue_block_1 is on black_block_2, then both blue_block_1 and purple_block_1 are on black_block_2, which violates the rules of blocksworld. I made an error. Let me correct this:

I think the issue is, I'm thinking of purple_block_1 being on black_block_2 at step 4, but purple_block_1 should be on the table at that point.

Let me re-do the step-by-step plan:

Starting state:
```
     purple_block_1         black_block_2         black_block_3
           |                     |
     yellow_block_1              |
           |                     |
      blue_block_1               |
           |                     |
     black_block_1          red_block_1
         table                 table                table
```

1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.
   - Holding black_block_2
   - Red_block_1 on table and clear

2. Putdown black_block_2 on the table.
   - Not holding anything
   - Black_block_2 on table and clear
   - Red_block_1 on table and clear

3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1.
   - Holding purple_block_1
   - Yellow_block_1 on blue_block_1 and clear

4. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_2.
   - Not holding anything
   - Purple_block_1 on black_block_2 and clear
   - Yellow_block_1 on blue_block_1 and clear

5. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1.
   - Holding yellow_block_1
   - Blue_block_1 on black_block_1 and clear
   - Purple_block_1 on black_block_2 and clear

6. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_3.
   - Not holding anything

Let's verify the constraints:

1. "you are holding purple_block_1" must be true in at least one state. ✅ (At step 3)
2. Before "you are holding purple_block_1" becomes true, "black_block_2 is on the table" must be true. ✅ (Step 2 happens before step 3)
3. "there is a block on top of purple_block_1, i.e., purple_block_1 is not clear" must be true in at least one state. ✅ (At step 8, blue_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1)
4. Before "there is a block on top of purple_block_1, i.e., purple_block_1 is not clear" becomes true, "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding purple_block_1", "there is a block on top of black_block_2, i.e., black_block_2 is not clear"" must be true. ✅ (Step 3 has "you are holding purple_block_1" true, which is before step 8)
5. "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding yellow_block_1", "blue_block_1 is on the table"" must be true in at least one state. ✅ (At step 5, we are holding yellow_block_1)
6. "At least one of the following conditions is true: "black_block_1 is not on the table", "blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2"" must be true in at least one state. ✅ (At step 10, black_block_1 is on blue_block_1, not on the table)
7. "purple_block_1 is not on the table" must be true in at least one state. ✅ (At step 4, purple_block_1 is on black_block_2)
8. At or after a state where "purple_block_1 is not on the table" is true, "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding black_block_2", "there is no block on top of red_block_1, i.e., red_block_1 is clear"" must be true. ✅ (red_block_1 is clear from step 1 onwards)
9. "you are holding red_block_1" must be true in at least one state. ✅ (At step 15)
10. "yellow_block_1 is not on the table" must be true in at least one state. ✅ (Initial state and until step 12)
11. At or after a state where "yellow_block_1 is not on the table" is true, "At least one of the following conditions is true: "there is no block on top of red_block_1, i.e., red_block_1 is clear", "black_block_3 is on top of red_block_1"" must be true. ✅ (red_block_1 is clear from step 1 onwards)
12. "black_block_1 is on top of black_block_3" must be true in at least one state. ✅ (At step 14)
13. "black_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1" must be true in at least one state. ✅ (Initial state and onwards)
14. At or after a state where "black_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1" is true, "there is no block on top of purple_block_1, i.e., purple_block_1 is clear" must be true. ✅ (purple_block_1 is clear in initial state, step 4, and step 16)
15. "there is a block on top of blue_block_1, i.e., blue_block_1 is not clear" must be true in at least one state. ✅ (At step 10, black_block_1 is on blue_block_1)
16. At or after a state where "there is a block on top of blue_block_1, i.e., blue_block_1 is not clear" is true, "yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_3" must be true. ✅ (yellow_block_1 is on black_block_3 at step 10)

All constraints have been satisfied, and our goal of making yellow_block_1 clear is achieved by the end of step 3, and it remains clear at the end of our plan.

The optimal plan to just achieve the goal is:
1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.
2. Putdown black_block_2 on the table.
3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1.

But to satisfy all constraints, we went through a more intricate plan:
1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.
2. Putdown black_block_2 on the table.
3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1.
4. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_2.
5. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1.
6. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_3.
7. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1.
8. Stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_1.
9. Unstack black_block_1 from the table.
10. Stack black_block_1 on blue_block_1.
11. Unstack yellow_block_1 from black_block_3.
12. Putdown yellow_block_1 on the table.
13. Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1.
14. Stack black_block_1 on black_block_3.
15. Unstack red_block_1 from the table.
16. Putdown red_block_1 on the table.
