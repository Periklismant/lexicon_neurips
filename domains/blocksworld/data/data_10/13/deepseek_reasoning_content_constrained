Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. First, I need to understand the initial state and the goal. The goal is to make sure that there's no block on top of yellow_block_1, meaning yellow_block_1 should be clear. 

Looking at the initial state, yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1, and purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1. So to clear yellow_block_1, I need to remove purple_block_1 from it. That means I have to move purple_block_1 somewhere else. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy as well. Let me go through each constraint carefully.

First constraint: The plan must include a state where the robotic arm is holding purple_block_1. Also, whenever the arm is holding purple_block_1, there must have been a prior state where black_block_2 is on the table. Initially, black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1. So to get black_block_2 on the table, I need to unstack it from red_block_1. But before that, I need to make sure black_block_2 is clear. Wait, in the initial state, black_block_2 is on red_block_1 and is clear. So I can unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1, then put it down. That would satisfy the condition that black_block_2 is on the table at some point before holding purple_block_1.

Next constraint: There must be a state where there's a block on top of purple_block_1. Since initially, purple_block_1 is clear, I need to stack something on it. But to do that, I need to have a block in hand and purple_block_1 must be clear. But after moving purple_block_1, maybe I can stack another block on it. However, the goal is to have yellow_block_1 clear, so once purple_block_1 is moved, maybe we can put it somewhere else. Wait, but the constraint says there must be a state where purple_block_1 is not clear. So perhaps after moving purple_block_1, I can place another block on top of it. But I need to check the other constraints related to this. The constraint also says that if purple_block_1 has a block on top, then in an earlier state, either the arm was holding purple_block_1 or black_block_2 is not clear. Since we have to hold purple_block_1 anyway (from the first constraint), that might satisfy this condition.

Another constraint requires that in some state, either the arm is holding yellow_block_1 or blue_block_1 is on the table. Initially, blue_block_1 is on black_block_1, so blue_block_1 is not on the table. So to satisfy this, maybe we need to either pick up yellow_block_1 (but it's under purple_block_1) or move blue_block_1 to the table. But moving blue_block_1 would require unstacking it from black_block_1, which has yellow_block_1 on top. So that's a problem. Because blue_block_1 is under yellow_block_1 and purple_block_1. To get blue_block_1 on the table, we'd have to first remove the blocks above it. But since the goal is to clear yellow_block_1, maybe we have to deal with purple_block_1 first.

Another constraint says that in some state, either black_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2. Since black_block_1 is initially on the table, to satisfy this, we need to either move black_block_1 (make it not on the table) or stack blue_block_1 on black_block_2. But blue_block_1 is under yellow and purple. So maybe moving black_block_1 onto something else? But that's not part of the goal. Hmm.

Another constraint requires that purple_block_1 is not on the table in some state. Since initially, it's on yellow_block_1, which is not the table, so it's already not on the table. Wait, but the initial state says purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, so it's not on the table. So maybe this constraint is already satisfied. But wait, the constraint says "must hold in at least one state", so perhaps it's already true in the initial state. But maybe we have to ensure that it's not on the table at some point. Wait, no: the constraint is that in at least one state, purple_block_1 is not on the table. Since in the initial state, it's on yellow_block_1, which is on blue_block_1, so purple is not on the table. So that's already true. But maybe during the plan, if we put purple on the table, but then need to ensure that at some point it's not. But the initial state already satisfies that. So maybe this constraint is already met. But I need to confirm. The original state says purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, which is on blue_block_1, which is on black_block_1, which is on the table. So purple is not on the table. So the initial state satisfies this constraint. So that's okay. However, if during the plan we put purple on the table, then we need to have another state where it's not. But since the initial state already satisfies it, perhaps we don't need to do anything. But I need to check if the constraints require it to be true in some state in the plan, not just the initial. The problem says "a valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints". So the constraints must hold in the plan's states. The initial state is part of the plan's states. So maybe this constraint is already satisfied. But I need to make sure that in the plan's sequence of actions, at least one state (which could be the initial) has purple_block_1 not on the table. Since that's true initially, this constraint is satisfied. However, if during the plan, purple is put on the table, then later moved again, but the initial state already satisfies it. So maybe this is already handled. But let's keep that in mind.

Another constraint: If purple_block_1 is not on the table in some state s, then in s or some state after, either the arm is holding black_block_2 or red_block_1 is clear. Since in the initial state, purple is not on the table, and in the initial state, red_block_1 has black_block_2 on top, so red_block_1 is not clear. So the initial state s0 would require that in s0 or after, either the arm holds black_block_2 or red_block_1 is clear. But in the initial state, neither is true. So we need to make sure that after s0, in some subsequent state, either the arm holds black_block_2 or red_block_1 is clear. So during the plan, after the initial state, if we unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1 and put it down, then red_block_1 becomes clear. That would satisfy the condition. So perhaps when we move black_block_2 to the table, red_block_1 becomes clear. So that action would make red_block_1 clear, which would satisfy this constraint.

Another constraint requires that the arm holds red_block_1 in some state. So we need to pick up red_block_1. But red_block_1 is under black_block_2. To pick up red_block_1, we need to first remove black_block_2. So unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1, put it down, then pickup red_block_1. But maybe that's part of the plan.

Another constraint: yellow_block_1 is not on the table in some state. Initially, yellow is on blue_block_1, so it's not on the table. So the initial state already satisfies this. Wait, but the constraint is that in some state in the plan, yellow is not on the table. Since it's already not on the table initially, this is satisfied. But if during the plan, we put yellow on the table, then we have to make sure that in some state after that, it's not. But perhaps this is already okay.

Another constraint: If yellow_block_1 is not on the table in some state s, then in s or after, either red_block_1 is clear or black_block_3 is on red_block_1. Since in the initial state, yellow is not on the table, and in the initial state, red_block_1 has black_block_2 on it. So in the initial state, neither condition is met. Therefore, we need to ensure that after the initial state, either red_block_1 becomes clear or black_block_3 is stacked on red_block_1. So when we unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1, red_block_1 becomes clear, which would satisfy this. So after unstacking black_block_2, red_block_1 is clear, which would meet the condition.

Another constraint: black_block_1 is on top of black_block_3 in some state. Currently, black_block_1 is on the table, and black_block_3 is on the table. So we need to stack black_block_1 on black_block_3. To do that, both blocks must be clear. black_block_1 has blue_block_1 on top, which has yellow and purple. So first, we need to clear black_block_1 by moving blue_block_1. But blue_block_1 is under yellow and purple. So to move blue_block_1, we have to unstack yellow and purple from it. Wait, but the goal is to clear yellow_block_1. Wait, the goal is that yellow_block_1 is clear. So perhaps we need to move purple_block_1 off yellow_block_1, which would make yellow clear. But in the process, we might have to move other blocks.

Another constraint: black_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1 in some state. Initially, black_block_2 is on red_block_1, so this is already true. So the initial state satisfies this. But if during the plan, black_block_2 is placed on yellow_block_1, then we need to ensure that in that state or after, purple_block_1 is clear. Since the initial state already satisfies the "black_block_2 not on yellow_block_1", this constraint is already met. But maybe during the plan, we need to avoid putting black_block_2 on yellow_block_1 unless we ensure that purple is clear. But since the initial state satisfies this, maybe this constraint is okay.

Another constraint: there's a block on top of blue_block_1 (i.e., blue_block_1 not clear) in some state. Initially, blue_block_1 has yellow on top, which has purple. So blue_block_1 is not clear. So the initial state satisfies this. But if during the plan, we remove yellow and purple, then blue_block_1 becomes clear. But the constraint requires that in some state, blue_block_1 is not clear. The initial state already satisfies this. However, if we remove all blocks from blue_block_1, then we need to make sure that in some state after that, blue_block_1 is not clear again. But perhaps the initial state is sufficient. The constraint says "must hold in at least one state", so the initial state counts. So this constraint is already satisfied.

But wait, the constraint says that if in some state s, blue_block_1 is not clear, then in s or after, yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_3. But the initial state s0 has blue_block_1 not clear, so we need to ensure that in s0 or after, yellow is on black_block_3. But in the initial state, yellow is on blue_block_1. So to satisfy this, after s0, we need to have a state where yellow is on black_block_3. So the plan must include stacking yellow on black_block_3 at some point.

So putting this all together, the steps I need to take are:

1. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1 to hold it. But wait, to unstack, the block must be clear. Purple is clear, so yes. So unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1. That would make yellow_block_1 clear, which is the goal. But wait, the goal is to have yellow_block_1 clear. So if I unstack purple from yellow, that directly achieves the goal. But I have to satisfy all the constraints. Let's see.

But wait, the first constraint requires that the arm holds purple_block_1 in some state. So by unstacking it, that's satisfied. Also, the second constraint says that if we hold purple_block_1, there must be an earlier state where black_block_2 is on the table. Initially, black_block_2 is on red_block_1. So before holding purple_block_1, I need to have black_block_2 on the table. So the sequence would be:

- Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1 (since it's clear and on red_block_1), put it down. Now black_block_2 is on the table. Then, unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1. That way, when we hold purple_block_1, the previous state had black_block_2 on the table.

But wait, after unstacking black_block_2, we have to put it down. So:

1. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
2. putdown black_block_2

Now, black_block_2 is on the table, satisfying the condition for when we hold purple_block_1 later.

Then, unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1. But wait, purple is on yellow, which is on blue. So to unstack purple, we need to have nothing on top of it (which it is), and the arm is empty. So steps:

3. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1

Now, holding purple_block_1. Then, we need to put it somewhere. But also, the constraint requires that in some state, there's a block on top of purple_block_1. So we need to stack something on it. But to do that, we need to have a block in hand and purple must be clear. After unstacking purple, we are holding it. If we put it down, then later stack something on it. But maybe we can stack it onto another block. Let's see.

But first, the goal is achieved by step 3, because yellow_block_1 is clear. However, we need to satisfy all the other constraints. Let's check each constraint:

- Must hold purple_block_1: done in step 3.
- Before holding purple, black_block_2 was on table: done in step 2.
- Must have a state where purple is not clear (something on top). So after step 3, we can put purple on the table, then stack something on it. But what blocks are available? Let's see. After step 3, we have purple in hand. Let's say we put it down (step 4: putdown purple_block_1). Then, later, pick up another block and stack it on purple. For example, pick up black_block_2 (which is on the table) and stack it on purple. But to do that, we need to have black_block_2 clear. After step 2, black_block_2 is on the table and clear. So:

4. putdown purple_block_1
5. pickup black_block_2
6. stack black_block_2 purple_block_1

Now, in step 6, purple_block_1 has black_block_2 on top, so it's not clear. That satisfies the third constraint. Also, when we stacked black_block_2 on purple, the condition for that constraint (if purple is not clear, then earlier state had holding purple or black_block_2 not clear) is met because we did hold purple in step 3, which is earlier.

Next constraint: at least one state where either holding yellow or blue is on table. Currently, blue is on black_block_1. So we need to have either pick up yellow (which is now clear) or move blue to table. Let's see: after step 3, yellow is clear. So maybe we can pick up yellow. But the goal is already achieved, but perhaps we need to do this for the constraint. So:

7. pickup yellow_block_1

But wait, after step 3, yellow is clear and on blue. So we can pickup yellow. Then put it down. But why? The constraint just needs that in some state, either holding yellow or blue is on table. So if we hold yellow in step 7, that satisfies the condition. Then we can put it down again. But maybe we need to stack it elsewhere. For example, stacking it on black_block_3 to satisfy another constraint.

Another constraint requires that in some state, black_block_1 is on top of black_block_3. So we need to stack black_block_1 onto black_block_3. But black_block_1 is currently under blue_block_1. So to move black_block_1, we need to clear it. To clear black_block_1, we need to move blue_block_1. But blue_block_1 is under yellow and purple. Wait, after step 3, purple is moved, yellow is clear. So yellow is on blue_block_1, which is on black_block_1. So to move blue_block_1, we need to first move yellow.

So after step 3:

3. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1 (holding purple)
4. putdown purple_block_1
5. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1 (since yellow is now clear)
6. putdown yellow_block_1
7. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1 (blue is now clear)
8. putdown blue_block_1

Now, blue is on the table, which satisfies the constraint where either holding yellow or blue is on the table. But step 7 and 8 would do that. Alternatively, if we hold yellow in step 5, that also satisfies the condition.

But let's see. Let's adjust the plan:

After step 3 (holding purple), put it down (step4). Then, pickup yellow (step5), which is clear. So:

4. putdown purple_block_1
5. pickup yellow_block_1

Now, holding yellow satisfies the constraint (either holding yellow or blue on table). Then, we can stack yellow somewhere else. But another constraint requires that in some state, yellow is on top of black_block_3. Because when blue_block_1 is not clear (initially, it's not), then we need yellow to be on black_block_3 at some point after. So we need to stack yellow on black_block_3.

So step 6: stack yellow_block_1 black_block_3

Now, yellow is on black_block_3. That satisfies the constraint related to blue_block_1 not clear.

Then, we can move blue_block_1. Since yellow is now on black_block_3, blue_block_1 is clear. So:

7. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
8. putdown blue_block_1

Now, blue is on the table. That satisfies the constraint where either holding yellow or blue is on the table. But we already satisfied it by holding yellow in step 5.

Now, to stack black_block_1 onto black_block_3 (another constraint). But black_block_1 is currently on the table and clear. So:

9. pickup black_block_1
10. stack black_block_1 black_block_3

Now, black_block_1 is on black_block_3, satisfying that constraint.

But wait, black_block_3 was on the table. After stacking, black_block_1 is on it, so black_block_3 is not clear. But that's okay.

Another constraint requires that the arm holds red_block_1 at some point. Currently, red_block_1 is under black_block_2, which we moved to the table. Wait, after step 2, black_block_2 is on the table, so red_block_1 is clear. So we can pickup red_block_1:

11. pickup red_block_1
12. putdown red_block_1 (or stack it somewhere)

But the constraint just requires holding it, so step 11 is enough.

Another constraint is that purple_block_1 is not on the table. Initially, it's not, and after step4, we put it on the table. Wait, step4 is putdown purple_block_1, so after step4, purple is on the table. But the constraint requires that in some state, purple is not on the table. However, in the initial state, it wasn't. But if during the plan we put it on the table, then we need to have another state where it's not. Wait, no. The constraint is that in at least one state, purple is not on the table. The initial state satisfies that. So even if later we put it on the table, as long as there's at least one state (like the initial) where it's not, it's okay. So that's handled.

But the constraint related to when purple is not on the table: if in any state s, purple is not on the table, then in s or after, either the arm holds black_block_2 or red_block_1 is clear. So in the initial state, purple is not on the table, and in that state, red_block_1 has black_block_2 on it (not clear), and the arm is empty. So to satisfy this, after the initial state, we must have a state where either the arm holds black_block_2 or red_block_1 is clear. When we unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1 (step1), then red_block_1 becomes clear. So after step1, red_block_1 is clear. So in the initial state s0, purple is not on the table, and in the next state (after step1), red_block_1 is clear, which satisfies the condition.

Another constraint: yellow_block_1 is not on the table. Initially, it's not, and after step6, it's on black_block_3, so still not on the table. So that's okay.

The constraint that if yellow is not on the table in some state s, then in s or after, red_block_1 is clear or black_block_3 is on red_block_1. Since after step1, red_block_1 is clear, any state after that where yellow is not on the table (which is all states) satisfies this because red_block_1 is clear.

Another constraint: black_block_2 is not on yellow_block_1. We never put black_block_2 on yellow, so that's okay.

The constraint that there's a block on blue_block_1 (initially yes, but after step7, blue is on the table. So in the initial state, it's satisfied. But when we move blue to the table, then blue is clear. But the constraint only requires that in some state, blue is not clear. The initial state suffices.

But the other part of that constraint: if blue is not clear in some state s, then yellow must be on black_block_3 in s or after. In the initial state, blue is not clear, so we need to ensure that yellow is on black_block_3 at some point. Which we did in step6.

Putting all this together, the steps would be:

1. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
2. putdown black_block_2
3. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
4. putdown purple_block_1
5. pickup yellow_block_1
6. stack yellow_block_1 black_block_3
7. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
8. putdown blue_block_1
9. pickup black_block_1
10. stack black_block_1 black_block_3
11. pickup red_block_1
12. putdown red_block_1

But wait, after step3, the goal is already achieved (yellow is clear). So steps after that are to satisfy other constraints. But the problem requires the plan to be optimal, i.e., as short as possible. So maybe there's a shorter path.

Wait, the main goal is to make yellow_block_1 clear, which is achieved by step3 (unstack purple from yellow). But we have to satisfy all the constraints. Let's see if the steps I outlined are necessary.

But perhaps there's a shorter way. Let me re-examine.

The minimal plan would be to unstack purple from yellow, but we have to satisfy all constraints. Let's check each constraint:

1. Hold purple: yes in step3.

2. Before holding purple, black_block_2 must be on table. So steps1 and2 are needed.

3. Have a state where purple is not clear (something on top). So after step3, we can stack something on purple. For example, after step3, putdown purple (step4), then pickup black_block_2 (step5), stack it on purple (step6). Now purple has black_block_2 on top.

4. The constraint requiring either holding yellow or blue on table. If we stack black_block_2 on purple, then maybe we can also handle blue_block_1. Alternatively, after step3, yellow is clear. If we pickup yellow (step4), then that satisfies the constraint. So steps:

3. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
4. pickup yellow_block_1 (now holding yellow, which satisfies the constraint)
5. putdown yellow_block_1 (or stack it somewhere else)

But then, we need to stack yellow on black_block_3 to satisfy the constraint related to blue_block_1 not clear. So:

5. stack yellow_block_1 black_block_3

Now, that's step5.

Then, blue_block_1 is now clear. To move blue_block_1, perhaps we need to put it on the table to satisfy another constraint (blue on table). But no, the constraint is that in some state, either hold yellow or blue is on table. We already held yellow, so that's satisfied.

Then, the constraint that black_block_1 must be on black_block_3. So we need to stack black_block_1 on black_block_3. But black_block_1 is under blue_block_1. Wait, after step3, purple is removed from yellow, yellow is clear. Then, after step4, yellow is picked up, stacked on black_block_3 (step5). Then, blue_block_1 is clear. So unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1 (step6), put it down (step7), then pickup black_block_1 (step8), stack on black_block_3 (step9).

Then, the constraint for holding red_block_1. After step2, red_block_1 is clear. So pickup red_block_1 (step10), put it down (step11).

Additionally, the constraint that purple is not on the table is already satisfied in the initial state. The constraint related to purple not on the table requiring that after, arm holds black_block_2 or red is clear. After step2, red is clear, so that's satisfied.

So possible plan steps:

1. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
2. putdown black_block_2
3. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
4. stack purple_block_1 black_block_2 (Wait, but black_block_2 is on the table and clear. So after step2, black_block_2 is on table. So we can stack purple on it. But stacking requires holding purple and black_block_2 is clear. So after step3, holding purple, then stack on black_block_2. So steps:

3. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
4. stack purple_block_1 black_block_2

This way, purple is on black_block_2, which is on the table. Then, black_block_2 is no longer clear. Also, this satisfies the constraint that there's a block on top of purple_block_1 (but wait, purple is on top of black_block_2, so black_block_2 has purple on it. So purple is clear? No, stacking purple on black_block_2 makes purple on top, so purple is clear. But the constraint requires that purple has something on top. So perhaps stacking something on purple later.

Wait, no. If we stack purple on black_block_2, then purple is on black_block_2, and purple is clear. So that doesn't put anything on top of purple. So to have something on purple, we need to stack another block on it. But that would require another step. So maybe after stacking purple on black_block_2, we need to stack another block on purple. For example, after step4, pickup black_block_2 (but it's under purple, so can't). Alternatively, pickup another block, like black_block_3, which is on the table. So:

5. pickup black_block_3
6. stack black_block_3 purple_block_1

But black_block_3 is initially on the table and clear. So steps:

1. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
2. putdown black_block_2
3. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
4. stack purple_block_1 black_block_2
5. pickup black_block_3
6. stack black_block_3 purple_block_1

Now, in step6, purple_block_1 has black_block_3 on top, so it's not clear. That satisfies the third constraint. Also, when we stacked purple on black_block_2, that doesn't require anything else, but the constraint for when purple is not clear is satisfied because we held purple in step3.

But this adds more steps. Let's see if this is necessary.

Alternatively, after step3, putdown purple (step4), then pickup black_block_2 (step5), stack on purple (step6). So:

1. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
2. putdown black_block_2
3. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
4. putdown purple_block_1
5. pickup black_block_2
6. stack black_block_2 purple_block_1

This way, purple has black_block_2 on top. So step6 makes purple not clear. But to stack black_block_2 on purple, we need to have black_block_2 clear. After step2, black_block_2 is on the table and clear. Then, step5 picks it up and stacks on purple. That works. So steps up to 6 would satisfy the constraint.

Then, the constraint requiring holding yellow or blue on table. Since after step3, yellow is clear, we can pickup yellow (step7), which satisfies that constraint.

7. pickup yellow_block_1
8. stack yellow_block_1 black_block_3

This satisfies the constraint related to blue_block_1 not clear requiring yellow on black_block_3.

Then, move blue_block_1 to table:

9. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
10. putdown blue_block_1

Then, move black_block_1 to black_block_3:

11. pickup black_block_1
12. stack black_block_1 black_block_3

Then, hold red_block_1:

13. pickup red_block_1
14. putdown red_block_1

But this is getting too long. Maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, after step3 (unstack purple), stack it somewhere else where it has a block on top. For example, stack purple on black_block_3, then stack black_block_2 on purple. But that requires more steps.

Alternatively, after step3, stack purple on black_block_3, then stack another block on it. But maybe that's not needed.

Wait, the third constraint requires that there's a state where purple is not clear (something on top). So stacking anything on purple would satisfy this. For example, after unstacking purple (step3), stack it on black_block_3. Then, purple is on black_block_3 and is clear. Not helpful. But if we then stack another block on purple, like black_block_2, that would make purple not clear. So:

1. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
2. putdown black_block_2
3. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
4. stack purple_block_1 black_block_3
5. pickup black_block_2
6. stack black_block_2 purple_block_1

Now, in step6, purple has black_block_2 on top, so not clear. This satisfies the constraint. Then, the rest of the steps to handle other constraints.

But this requires 6 steps before even addressing other constraints.

But the minimal plan must be as short as possible. Let's see what's the absolute minimum steps required.

The goal is to clear yellow_block_1, which can be done by unstacking purple from yellow. But to satisfy the constraints:

- Must hold purple (step3)
- Before that, black_block_2 on table (steps1-2)
- After holding purple, stack something on it (steps4-6)
- Hold yellow or blue on table (step7)
- Stack yellow on black_block_3 (step8)
- Stack black_block_1 on black_block_3 (steps9-10)
- Hold red_block_1 (step11)

This seems like a lot, but maybe some steps can be merged.

Alternative approach:

After unstacking black_block_2 and putting it down (steps1-2), unstack purple (step3), then stack purple on black_block_2 (step4). This makes purple not clear (as black_block_2 is under it), but no, stacking purple on black_block_2 would make purple on top of black_block_2, so black_block_2 is not clear, and purple is clear. So that doesn't satisfy the constraint that purple has something on top. So we need to stack something on purple. For example, after step4, pickup another block (like black_block_3) and stack on purple (steps5-6). But that's more steps.

Alternatively, after step3, putdown purple (step4), then pickup black_block_2 and stack on purple (steps5-6). Then, purple has black_block_2 on top. Wait, no, stacking black_block_2 on purple would require that purple is clear. After step4, purple is on the table and clear. So step5: pickup black_block_2 (on table, clear), stack on purple (step6). Now, black_block_2 is on purple, so purple is not clear. That works.

Then, proceed to handle other constraints.

So steps up to step6:

1. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
2. putdown black_block_2
3. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
4. putdown purple_block_1
5. pickup black_block_2
6. stack black_block_2 purple_block_1

Now, purple has black_block_2 on top. So constraint satisfied.

Then, need to handle yellow_block_1. It's clear, so we can pick it up (step7), then stack it on black_block_3 (step8), which satisfies the blue_block_1 constraint.

7. pickup yellow_block_1
8. stack yellow_block_1 black_block_3

Then, move blue_block_1 to table:

9. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
10. putdown blue_block_1

Then, stack black_block_1 on black_block_3:

11. pickup black_block_1
12. stack black_block_1 black_block_3

Then, hold red_block_1:

13. pickup red_block_1
14. putdown red_block_1

But this is 14 steps. Maybe there's a shorter way. Let's see:

Alternatively, after step3 (holding purple), instead of putting it down, stack it onto black_block_2 directly. But black_block_2 is on the table and clear. So:

3. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
4. stack purple_block_1 black_block_2

This way, purple is on black_block_2, and black_block_2 is on the table. Now, purple is clear. To make purple not clear, need to stack something on it. So:

5. pickup black_block_3
6. stack black_block_3 purple_block_1

Now, black_block_3 is on purple, so purple is not clear. Steps up to 6.

Then, handle yellow:

7. pickup yellow_block_1
8. stack yellow_block_1 black_block_3

Then, move blue_block_1:

9. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
10. putdown blue_block_1

Stack black_block_1:

11. pickup black_block_1
12. stack black_block_1 black_block_3

Hold red_block_1:

13. pickup red_block_1
14. putdown red_block_1

Still 14 steps. Maybe there's a way to combine some steps.

Wait, when we stack purple on black_block_2, that's step4. Then, stacking black_block_3 on purple (step6) requires picking up black_block_3 (step5). Alternatively, after stacking purple on black_block_2, can we stack something else without picking up? No, because the arm is empty after stacking. So steps are necessary.

But perhaps after stacking purple on black_block_2, we can use another block to stack on purple. For example, black_block_3 is on the table. So steps5-6 as above.

Alternatively, use red_block_1, but red_block_1 is clear after step1. So after step1, red_block_1 is clear. So in step5, pickup red_block_1 and stack on purple. But then that satisfies the constraint to hold red_block_1. So:

1. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
2. putdown black_block_2
3. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
4. stack purple_block_1 black_block_2
5. pickup red_block_1
6. stack red_block_1 purple_block_1

Now, purple has red_block_1 on top. But red_block_1 was picked up, which satisfies the constraint to hold it. Then, we don't need step13-14. So steps6 would satisfy the red_block_1 constraint. Then, proceed with other steps.

After step6:

7. pickup yellow_block_1
8. stack yellow_block_1 black_block_3
9. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
10. putdown blue_block_1
11. pickup black_block_1
12. stack black_block_1 black_block_3

This is 12 steps. Let's check all constraints:

- Hold purple: step3.

- Before step3, black_block_2 on table: steps1-2.

- Purple not clear: step6 (red on purple).

- Either hold yellow or blue on table: step7 (hold yellow).

- Either black_block_1 not on table or blue on black_block_2: after step11-12, black_block_1 is on black_block_3, so not on table. Satisfied.

- purple not on table: initial state and after step4 (purple on black_block_2).

- When purple not on table (initial state), after step1, red_block_1 is clear.

- Hold red_block_1: step5.

- yellow not on table: achieved by step8.

- After yellow not on table (step8), red is clear (since step1) or black_block_3 is on red. But red is clear after step1. So satisfied.

- black_block_1 on black_block_3: step12.

- black_block_2 not on yellow: achieved.

- blue_block_1 not clear initially, so yellow on black_block_3 (step8).

- blue_block_1 not clear in initial state, so yellow on black_block_3 after step8.

This seems to satisfy all constraints. Let's count the steps:

1. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1

2. putdown black_block_2

3. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1

4. stack purple_block_1 black_block_2

5. pickup red_block_1

6. stack red_block_1 purple_block_1

7. pickup yellow_block_1

8. stack yellow_block_1 black_block_3

9. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1

10. putdown blue_block_1

11. pickup black_block_1

12. stack black_block_1 black_block_3

That's 12 actions. But is there a way to shorten it further?

Wait, after step3, yellow is clear. The goal is achieved. The rest of the steps are for constraints. But the problem requires an optimal plan, which is the shortest possible. So maybe there's a shorter way to satisfy the constraints with fewer steps.

Let me think again.

Alternative plan:

1. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1

2. putdown black_block_2

3. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1 (goal achieved)

4. stack purple_block_1 black_block_2

5. pickup black_block_3

6. stack black_block_3 purple_block_1 (now purple is not clear)

7. pickup yellow_block_1 (satisfies the yellow/blue constraint)

8. stack yellow_block_1 black_block_3

9. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1

10. putdown blue_block_1

11. pickup black_block_1

12. stack black_block_1 black_block_3

13. pickup red_block_1

14. putdown red_block_1

But this is longer. Hmm.

Alternatively, after step4, stack red_block_1 on purple_block_1. But after step2, red_block_1 is clear. So:

5. pickup red_block_1

6. stack red_block_1 purple_block_1 (satisfies red being held and purple not clear)

7. pickup yellow_block_1

8. stack yellow_block_1 black_block_3

9. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1

10. putdown blue_block_1

11. pickup black_block_1

12. stack black_block_1 black_block_3

This is 12 steps. This seems to cover all constraints.

But let's verify each constraint:

- Hold purple: step3.

- Before that, step2 has black_block_2 on table.

- Purple not clear: step6.

- If purple not clear, earlier state held purple (step3) or black_block_2 not clear. After step4, black_block_2 has purple, so not clear. But step6 is after step4. So when stacking red on purple (step6), the condition is satisfied because earlier state (step3) held purple.

- Either hold yellow or blue on table: step7 holds yellow.

- Either black_block_1 not on table or blue on black_block_2. After step12, black_block_1 is on black_block_3, so not on table.

- Purple not on table: step4 places purple on black_block_2, which is on table, so purple is not on table.

- If purple not on table (step4), then in that state or after, hold black_block_2 or red_block_1 clear. After step2, red_block_1 is clear. So step4 and beyond have red_block_1 clear.

- Hold red_block_1: step5.

- yellow not on table: step8.

- After yellow not on table (step8), red is clear (step2 made it clear).

- black_block_1 on black_block_3: step12.

- black_block_2 not on yellow: yes.

- If black_block_2 not on yellow (always true), then purple is clear in step4. Wait, after step4, purple is on black_block_2, so purple is clear. The constraint says that if black_block_2 is not on yellow, then purple must be clear at that state or after. After step4, purple is clear. So satisfied.

- blue_block_1 not clear in initial state: satisfied.

- If blue_block_1 not clear (initial state), then yellow must be on black_block_3 after step8.

Yes.

All constraints seem to be satisfied with this 12-step plan. Is there a shorter way?

Alternative approach:

After step3 (unstack purple), stack it on black_block_3 (step4), then stack something else on purple (like black_block_3). Wait, can't stack on itself. Alternatively, stack purple on black_block_3, then stack another block on purple.

But this may not reduce steps.

Alternatively, after step3, stack purple on black_block_3 (step4), then pickup black_block_2 (step5), stack on purple (step6). Then, yellow is cleared, so pickup yellow (step7), stack on black_block_3 (step8). But then need to move blue and black_block_1 as before.

This also results in similar steps.

Alternatively, can we combine any steps?

For example, after step6 (stack red on purple), can we proceed to stack yellow on black_block_3 without putting it down. But the steps are sequential.

I think the 12-step plan is the shortest possible while satisfying all constraints.
