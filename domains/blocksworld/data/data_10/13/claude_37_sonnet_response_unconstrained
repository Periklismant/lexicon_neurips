Alright, I'm given a blocksworld problem with the following objects:
- black_block_1, red_block_1, blue_block_1, black_block_2, yellow_block_1, black_block_3, purple_block_1

The initial state is:
- black_block_1 is on the table with blue_block_1 on top, then yellow_block_1 on top of blue_block_1, and purple_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1. So, this stack from bottom to top is: black_block_1 (on table) -> blue_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 -> purple_block_1.
- red_block_1 is on the table with black_block_2 on top. So, this stack from bottom to top is: red_block_1 (on table) -> black_block_2.
- black_block_3 is on the table by itself.
- black_block_2, black_block_3, and purple_block_1 are clear (no blocks on top).
- The robot arm is not holding any block.

The goal is to make yellow_block_1 clear, which means I need to remove purple_block_1 from the top of yellow_block_1.

Given the actions I can perform, I need to find a valid plan that makes yellow_block_1 clear. Let's start by understanding the current state of the world and then plan a sequence of actions.

Currently, yellow_block_1 has purple_block_1 on top of it. So, to make yellow_block_1 clear, I need to remove purple_block_1 from the top.

To do this, I can use the unstack action to pick up purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1. Then, I need to decide what to do with purple_block_1. I can either putdown purple_block_1 on the table or stack it on top of one of the other clear blocks (black_block_2 or black_block_3).

Let's just unstack the purple block and putdown on the table, as that is the simplest action:

1. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
2. putdown purple_block_1

After these two actions, yellow_block_1 will be clear, which is the goal.

Let's confirm this is a valid plan and ensure we're following all the rules:

For the unstack action:
Preconditions: 
- purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1 (satisfied)
- purple_block_1 is clear (satisfied)
- The robot is not holding any block (satisfied)

Effects:
- purple_block_1 is no longer on top of yellow_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- The robot is holding purple_block_1

For the putdown action:
Preconditions:
- The robot is holding purple_block_1 (satisfied after the unstack)

Effects:
- purple_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is clear
- The robot is no longer holding any block

This plan seems valid. After executing it, yellow_block_1 will be clear, which is the goal.

So, the final optimal plan is:
1. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
2. putdown purple_block_1

Let me double check this:

In the initial state, we have:
- A stack of blocks: black_block_1 (on table) -> blue_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 -> purple_block_1
- A stack of blocks: red_block_1 (on table) -> black_block_2
- black_block_3 is on the table by itself
- black_block_2, black_block_3, and purple_block_1 are clear
- The robot arm is not holding any block

After the first action "unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1":
- The stacks become:
  - black_block_1 (on table) -> blue_block_1 -> yellow_block_1
  - red_block_1 (on table) -> black_block_2
  - black_block_3 is on the table by itself
- black_block_2, black_block_3, and yellow_block_1 are clear
- The robot is holding purple_block_1

After the second action "putdown purple_block_1":
- The stacks become:
  - black_block_1 (on table) -> blue_block_1 -> yellow_block_1
  - red_block_1 (on table) -> black_block_2
  - black_block_3 is on the table by itself
  - purple_block_1 is on the table by itself
- black_block_2, black_block_3, yellow_block_1, and purple_block_1 are clear
- The robot arm is not holding any block

Now, yellow_block_1 is clear, which is the goal. The plan is optimal because it takes only 2 actions to achieve the goal.

Actually, I just realized I was a bit too hasty with my planning. Let's double-check my description of the initial state, which is:

- black_block_1 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- black_block_3 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- black_block_2, black_block_3, and purple_block_1 are clear
- The robot arm is not holding any block

This indeed means the stacks are:
- Stack 1: black_block_1 (on table) -> blue_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 -> purple_block_1
- Stack 2: red_block_1 (on table) -> black_block_2
- Stack 3: black_block_3 (on table)

And the goal is to make yellow_block_1 clear. Currently, purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, so we need to remove purple_block_1 to make yellow_block_1 clear.

To do this, we can use the unstack action to pick up purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1. Then, we need to decide what to do with purple_block_1. We can either putdown purple_block_1 on the table or stack it on top of one of the other clear blocks (black_block_2 or black_block_3). Let's go with the simplest approach and put it on the table.

1. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
2. putdown purple_block_1

This plan is valid. After executing it, yellow_block_1 will be clear, which is the goal. Let me double-check once more and then finalize this as the optimal plan.
