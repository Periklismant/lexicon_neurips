Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld planning problem. Hmm, the initial state is a bit complex. Let me list out all the blocks and their positions first.

So, the blocks are: orange_block_1, white_block_1, red_block_1, orange_block_2, black_block_1, green_block_1, red_block_2.

Initial setup:
- orange_block_1 is on the table.
- white_block_1 is on the table.
- red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1. So, orange_block_1 has red_block_1 on it, and black_block_1 is on top of red_block_1. That makes a tower: orange_block_1 (with red_block_1 on it) supporting black_block_1. And black_block_1 is clear.
- orange_block_2 is on top of white_block_1, which is on the table. Then green_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2. So white_block_1 has orange_block_2, which has green_block_1. Both green_block_1 and black_block_1 are clear.
- red_block_2 is on the table and clear.

The goal is to have orange_block_2 on top of black_block_1. So we need to move orange_block_2 from being on white_block_1 (under green_block_1) to black_block_1. But first, we have to clear black_block_1, which is currently clear. Wait, no: black_block_1 is on top of red_block_1, which is on orange_block_1. So black_block_1 is clear. So to stack orange_block_2 on it, we just need to have orange_block_2 in hand and black_block_1 clear, which it already is. But the problem is getting orange_block_2 free. Right now, orange_block_2 is under green_block_1, so we need to move green_block_1 first.

But there are a lot of constraints. Let me go through them one by one.

Constraints:
1. black_block_1 must not be on the table in at least one state. Since initially, black_block_1 is on red_block_1, which is on orange_block_1, so it's not on the table. But maybe during the plan, if we move it, but the goal doesn't require moving it. Wait, the goal is to have orange_block_2 on black_block_1. So black_block_1 will still be on red_block_1. So unless the plan moves it, but the goal doesn't require that. So maybe this constraint is already satisfied in the initial state. But the problem states that the constraints must hold in the plan. So the initial state is part of the plan? Or does the plan start from the initial state, and the constraints must hold during the execution. So the first constraint is satisfied in the initial state because black_block_1 is not on the table. So that's okay. But maybe during the plan, if we move black_block_1 to the table, then we have to make sure that in some state after that, red_block_1 is clear. But the initial state already satisfies "black_block_1 not on table" (since it's on red_block_1), so maybe this constraint is already met. But perhaps we need to ensure that during the plan, at some point, black_block_1 is not on the table, which it already is. So maybe this is already satisfied. Hmm, but the constraint says "must hold in at least one state". So the initial state counts. So that's okay.

2. If black_block_1 is not on the table in some state s, then red_block_1 must be clear in s or a later state. Since in the initial state, black_block_1 is not on the table (it's on red_block_1), and red_block_1 has black_block_1 on top. So red_block_1 is not clear. So in the initial state, the constraint is satisfied because black_block_1 is not on the table, but red_block_1 is not clear. So we need to ensure that in some state after the initial state (if we have a state where black_block_1 is not on the table), then red_block_1 must be clear at that state or after. Wait, but in the initial state, black_block_1 is not on the table. So the condition is triggered. So in the initial state, we have to check if red_block_1 is clear in that state or after. But in the initial state, red_block_1 is not clear (it has black_block_1 on top). So to satisfy the constraint, after the initial state, there must be a state where red_block_1 is clear. So in the plan, we need to have red_block_1 cleared at some point after the initial state. That means we have to unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1, which would make red_block_1 clear. Then, perhaps, putting black_block_1 back somewhere else. But the goal doesn't require moving black_block_1. Hmm, but maybe during the plan, when we need to move red_block_1 or something else, we have to unstack black_block_1. So this constraint requires that if at any point black_block_1 is not on the table (which it is in the initial state and possibly other states), then red_block_1 must be clear at that state or later. So, for the initial state, we need to ensure that in some state after, red_block_1 is clear. Therefore, during the plan, we must make red_block_1 clear at least once.

3. white_block_1 must be clear in at least one state. Currently, white_block_1 has orange_block_2 on it, which has green_block_1. So to make white_block_1 clear, we need to remove orange_block_2 and green_block_1. But the goal is to put orange_block_2 on black_block_1. So during the plan, after moving green_block_1 and orange_block_2, white_block_1 would be clear. So this constraint is satisfied when we unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2 and then unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1, leaving white_block_1 clear.

4. If white_block_1 is clear in some state, there must be an earlier state where orange_block_1 is clear. Currently, orange_block_1 has red_block_1 on it. To make orange_block_1 clear, we need to unstack red_block_1. But red_block_1 is under black_block_1. So we need to unstack black_block_1 first. So the order here would be: unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1, then unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1. Then orange_block_1 becomes clear. Then, when white_block_1 becomes clear (after moving orange_block_2), we need to have had orange_block_1 clear before that.

5. Must be holding orange_block_1 in some state. So during the plan, we have to pick up orange_block_1. But orange_block_1 is under red_block_1 and black_block_1. So to get to orange_block_1, we have to first unstack black_block_1, then red_block_1, then pickup orange_block_1. But why would we need to hold orange_block_1? Because one of the constraints requires that "orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" in some state. So maybe we have to stack orange_block_1 onto white_block_1, which would require picking it up.

6. orange_block_1 must be on white_block_1 in some state. So during the plan, we have to stack orange_block_1 onto white_block_1. Which requires that orange_block_1 is clear (so red_block_1 and black_block_1 must be moved), then pickup orange_block_1 and stack it on white_block_1.

7. Must be holding orange_block_2 in some state. To move orange_block_2, we need to unstack it from white_block_1, but it's under green_block_1. So first unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2, then unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1, then hold it. Then stack it on black_block_1.

8. If holding orange_block_2 in some state, there must be an earlier state where red_block_1 is on green_block_1. Wait, red_block_1 is initially on orange_block_1. So to have red_block_1 on green_block_1, we need to move red_block_1 onto green_block_1. But green_block_1 is on orange_block_2, which is on white_block_1. So green_block_1 is clear. So maybe stack red_block_1 on green_block_1. But why would we do that? Because the constraint says that whenever we hold orange_block_2, there must be a prior state where red_block_1 is on green_block_1. So before we hold orange_block_2, we need to have red_block_1 on green_block_1.

9. Must be holding green_block_1 in some state. So we have to unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2.

10. If holding green_block_1 in state s, then in s or later, either red_block_2 is on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 is on black_block_1. So after picking up green_block_1, we need to make sure that either of those conditions is true. But orange_block_1 is initially on the table. To have orange_block_1 on black_block_1, we need to stack it there. But black_block_1 is on red_block_1. So stacking orange_block_1 on black_block_1 would require that black_block_1 is clear (which it is), and that we are holding orange_block_1. So perhaps after picking up green_block_1, we have to either stack red_block_2 on orange_block_1 (but red_block_2 is on the table and clear) or stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1.

11. black_block_1 must not be on top of white_block_1 in some state. Initially, black_block_1 is on red_block_1, so this condition is already true. But the constraint requires that in at least one state, this is true. So the initial state satisfies it, so that's okay. But if during the plan, black_block_1 is moved onto white_block_1, then we need to have a state where it's not. But since the initial state already satisfies this, perhaps this constraint is already met.

12. If in some state s, black_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, then red_block_1 must be clear in s or after. The initial state satisfies the antecedent (black_block_1 is not on white_block_1), so we need to ensure that in the initial state or after, red_block_1 is clear. But in the initial state, red_block_1 is not clear (has black_block_1 on top). So we need to make sure that after the initial state, red_block_1 becomes clear. Which aligns with constraint 2.

13. green_block_1 must not be on the table in every state. Initially, green_block_1 is on orange_block_2, which is on white_block_1, so it's not on the table. So we can't put green_block_1 on the table at any point. So all actions involving green_block_1 must either stack it somewhere or keep it in the air (but we can only hold one block). So when we unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2, we must stack it somewhere else, not put it down.

14. There must be a state where orange_block_1 is clear. Which would happen after removing red_block_1 and black_block_1 from it.

15. There must be a state where either holding orange_block_1 or red_block_1 is clear. Since we have to make red_block_1 clear at some point (from constraints 2 and 12), that would satisfy this.

So putting this all together, the plan must:

- Move green_block_1 from orange_block_2 to somewhere (but can't put it on the table). So maybe stack it on another block. But which one? Let's see.

But first, let's outline the steps needed to achieve the goal:

Goal: orange_block_2 on black_block_1.

Current position of orange_block_2: on white_block_1, under green_block_1.

To get orange_block_2, we need to unstack green_block_1 first. Then unstack orange_block_2.

But since green_block_1 can't be put on the table (constraint 13), we have to stack it somewhere else. Let's see. Available clear blocks: black_block_1 is clear, red_block_2 is clear. But black_block_1 is needed for the goal. So perhaps stack green_block_1 on red_block_2. But red_block_2 is on the table. Wait, can we stack green_block_1 on red_block_2? Yes, if red_block_2 is clear. Which it is. So:

1. unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2. Then stack it on red_block_2.

But then, when we unstack green_block_1, we have to hold it, and then stack it. So:

Action: unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2. Preconditions: green_block_1 is on orange_block_2, green_block_1 is clear (which it is), and the arm is empty. Initial state: arm is empty, so yes. Then, after unstacking, we're holding green_block_1, orange_block_2 becomes clear.

Then stack green_block_1 on red_block_2. Stack requires that we're holding green_block_1 and red_block_2 is clear. Yes. So:

stack green_block_1 red_block_2.

Then, now orange_block_2 is clear. So we can unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1. But orange_block_2 is on white_block_1. To unstack it, we need to have the arm empty. After stacking green_block_1, the arm is empty. So:

unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1. Now holding orange_block_2. Then stack it on black_block_1. But wait, the goal is to stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1. So:

stack orange_block_2 black_block_1.

But wait, after unstacking green_block_1 and stacking it on red_block_2, then unstacking orange_block_2, stacking on black_block_1. That would achieve the goal. But let's check the constraints.

But we need to satisfy all the constraints. Let's see:

- Constraint 7: holding orange_block_2 is satisfied when we unstack it.

- Constraint 8: When we hold orange_block_2, there must be a prior state where red_block_1 is on green_block_1. Wait, in the current steps, red_block_1 is still on orange_block_1. So this constraint isn't satisfied. So we need to have a step where red_block_1 is on green_block_1 before we hold orange_block_2.

So how to handle that. So before we unstack orange_block_2 (which makes us hold it), we need to have red_block_1 on green_block_1.

But red_block_1 is currently under black_block_1. So to move red_block_1, we need to first unstack black_block_1, then unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1, then stack red_block_1 onto green_block_1.

But green_block_1 is now on red_block_2. Wait, after stacking green_block_1 on red_block_2, green_block_1 is on red_block_2. So stacking red_block_1 on green_block_1 would require that green_block_1 is clear. But after stacking green_block_1 on red_block_2, red_block_2 is not clear (since green_block_1 is on it). So to stack red_block_1 on green_block_1, green_block_1 must be clear. So this might not be possible unless we move green_block_1 again.

This is getting complicated. Let's think again.

The constraint 8 says that if we are holding orange_block_2 in some state, then there must be an earlier state where red_block_1 is on green_block_1. So before we unstack orange_block_2 (which requires holding it), we need to have red_block_1 on green_block_1.

So, perhaps we need to:

1. Move black_block_1 from red_block_1 to some other place.

2. Move red_block_1 from orange_block_1 to green_block_1.

3. Then proceed to move green_block_1 and orange_block_2.

But how?

Let's outline possible steps:

- unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1. Now holding black_block_1. Put it down? But constraint 1 requires that black_block_1 is not on the table in at least one state, but initially it's not. If we put it on the table, then in that state, it's on the table, which violates the first constraint? Wait no, the first constraint says that "black_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in at least one state. So even if we put it on the table later, as long as there's at least one state (like the initial state) where it's not on the table, that's okay. So putting black_block_1 on the table is allowed, but we have to ensure that if we do that, then in that state or after, red_block_1 must be clear. But when we unstack black_block_1, red_block_1 becomes clear. So putting black_block_1 on the table would satisfy that.

But let's think:

After unstacking black_block_1, red_block_1 is clear. Then, we can put black_block_1 on the table. Then, the constraint for black_block_1 not being on the table is still satisfied in the initial state. But if we put black_block_1 on the table, then in that state, it's on the table. But the constraint requires that "black_block_1 is not on the table" in at least one state. Since the initial state is part of the plan, that's already satisfied. So it's okay to move black_block_1 to the table.

But perhaps it's better to stack black_block_1 somewhere else to avoid unnecessary steps. But let's see.

So steps:

1. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1. Now holding black_block_1. Red_block_1 is clear.

2. putdown black_block_1. Now black_block_1 is on the table. But this action would make red_block_1 clear (from the unstack), and after putdown, black_block_1 is on the table.

But according to constraint 2: if black_block_1 is not on the table (which it is in the initial state), then red_block_1 must be clear in that state or after. After unstacking, red_block_1 is clear, so that's satisfied.

Now, after putdown, black_block_1 is on the table, so in that state, black_block_1 is on the table. But the constraint 1 requires that in at least one state, it's not on the table. The initial state satisfies that, so it's okay.

But we need to make sure that red_block_1 is clear at some point. After step 1, red_block_1 is clear. So that's taken care of.

Now, moving red_block_1:

3. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1. Now holding red_block_1. Orange_block_1 becomes clear.

4. stack red_block_1 green_block_1. But green_block_1 is currently on orange_block_2, which is on white_block_1. So green_block_1 is under orange_block_2. Wait, no. Initially, green_block_1 is on orange_block_2. So to stack red_block_1 on green_block_1, we need to have green_block_1 clear. But green_block_1 is under orange_block_2, which is on white_block_1. So we need to first move green_block_1.

Wait, this is getting tangled. Let's backtrack.

Our goal is to have red_block_1 on green_block_1 before we hold orange_block_2. So let's consider moving green_block_1 first.

Alternative approach:

First, unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2.

But to do that, we need to have the arm empty, which it is initially.

1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2. Now holding green_block_1. Orange_block_2 becomes clear.

But we can't put green_block_1 on the table (constraint 13). So we need to stack it somewhere else. Possible targets: red_block_2 (on table, clear), black_block_1 (on red_block_1, which is on orange_block_1, but after moving black_block_1, maybe), or another block.

Wait, but if we stack green_block_1 on black_block_1, which is on red_block_1, then black_block_1 must be clear. Initially, black_block_1 is clear. So:

But currently, black_block_1 is on red_block_1. To stack green_block_1 on black_block_1, we need to have black_block_1 clear. Which it is. So:

After step 1 (unstack green_block_1), stack green_block_1 black_block_1.

But then black_block_1 is no longer clear. But the goal requires orange_block_2 on black_block_1. So if green_block_1 is on black_block_1, then we need to move it again. Not ideal.

Alternatively, stack green_block_1 on red_block_2, which is on the table and clear.

2. stack green_block_1 red_block_2. Now green_block_1 is on red_block_2, which is on the table.

But now, red_block_2 is not clear. So if we need to use it later, we have to unstack green_block_1. But maybe not necessary.

Then, we can unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1. But before that, we need to ensure that red_block_1 is on green_block_1 (constraint 8). So after moving green_block_1 to red_block_2, we need to move red_block_1 onto green_block_1.

But red_block_1 is currently under black_block_1. So:

3. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1. Now holding black_block_1. Red_block_1 is clear.

4. putdown black_block_1 on the table.

5. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1. Now holding red_block_1. Orange_block_1 is clear.

6. stack red_block_1 green_block_1. Now red_block_1 is on green_block_1 (which is on red_block_2). Green_block_1 must be clear. But after step 2, green_block_1 is on red_block_2. So to stack red_block_1 on green_block_1, green_block_1 must be clear. But green_block_1 has red_block_1 stacked on it. Wait, no. After step 2, green_block_1 is on red_block_2. So green_block_1 is clear (since nothing is on it). So stacking red_block_1 on green_block_1 is possible.

Wait, after step 2, green_block_1 is on red_block_2 and is clear. Then step 6 is stacking red_block_1 on green_block_1. That's possible. So now, red_block_1 is on green_block_1.

Now, constraint 8 is satisfied because before we hold orange_block_2, we have red_block_1 on green_block_1.

Now, we can proceed to unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1.

7. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1. Now holding orange_block_2. White_block_1 becomes clear.

Then stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1 (which is on the table, but no. Wait, black_block_1 was put on the table in step 4. So black_block_1 is on the table. So to stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1, which is on the table, we can do:

8. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1. But wait, stacking requires that the target block is clear. Black_block_1 is on the table and is clear (since we put it there and didn't put anything on it). So yes, this is possible.

But wait, the goal is to have orange_block_2 on black_block_1. But after step 8, black_block_1 is on the table, and orange_block_2 is on it. So the goal is achieved.

But let's check the constraints.

Constraint 4: If white_block_1 is clear (which happens after step 7), there must be an earlier state where orange_block_1 is clear. Orange_block_1 became clear in step 5 when we unsticked red_block_1 from it. So that's satisfied.

Constraint 6: orange_block_1 on white_block_1 at some state. Oh, this hasn't been addressed yet. We need to have orange_block_1 on white_block_1 in some state. But in our current plan, orange_block_1 is clear (after step 5) and is on the table. So we need to pick up orange_block_1 and stack it on white_block_1.

But this requires additional steps.

So after step 5, orange_block_1 is clear. So:

9. pickup orange_block_1. Preconditions: it's on the table, clear, and arm is empty. After step 5, yes.

10. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1. Now, orange_block_1 is on white_block_1. This satisfies constraint 6.

Then, we need to unstack it again to proceed? Because our goal is to have orange_block_2 on black_block_1, which is on the table. So perhaps after stacking orange_block_1 on white_block_1, we can leave it there. But the goal doesn't require moving it. But the constraint requires that in some state, orange_block_1 is on white_block_1. So we can stack it there and leave it.

But then, after step 10, orange_block_1 is on white_block_1. White_block_1 now has orange_block_1 and orange_block_2 was previously on it. Wait, no. Wait, white_block_1 initially had orange_block_2 and green_block_1. After step 1 and 2, green_block_1 is on red_block_2. After step 7, orange_block_2 is unsticked from white_block_1, so white_block_1 is clear. Then in step 10, we stack orange_block_1 onto white_block_1. So white_block_1 now has orange_block_1. That's fine.

But we also have constraint 5: holding orange_block_1. Which is satisfied in step 9.

Constraint 15: At least one of holding orange_block_1 or red_block_1 clear. When we hold orange_block_1 in step 9, that satisfies it. Also, after step 5, red_block_1 is clear (when we unstacked it and stacked it on green_block_1 in step 6). So that also satisfies.

Constraint 10: When holding green_block_1 (step 1), then either red_block_2 is on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 is on black_block_1. At step 1, after unstacking green_block_1, we are holding it. At that point, orange_block_1 has red_block_1 and black_block_1 on it (before moving them). Wait, no. At step 1, we've only moved green_block_1. The other blocks are still in their initial positions. So orange_block_1 has red_block_1 and black_block_1 on it. So in step 1, after unstacking green_block_1, we have to ensure that in some state after that, either red_block_2 is on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 is on black_block_1.

But after step 1, we are holding green_block_1. To satisfy constraint 10, during or after this state, either red_block_2 is on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 is on black_block_1.

But in the steps we have so far, after step 1, we stack green_block_1 on red_block_2 (step 2), then proceed to move black_block_1 and red_block_1, then stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1.

So during step 1, we are holding green_block_1, and we need to ensure that either red_block_2 is on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 is on black_block_1 in some state after.

But in our current plan, after step 1, neither of these conditions is met. So we need to make sure that after holding green_block_1, one of those is true.

So perhaps after stacking green_block_1 on red_block_2 (step 2), we need to stack red_block_2 on orange_block_1, or stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1.

But red_block_2 is on the table. To stack red_block_2 on orange_block_1, we need to unstack it first. But red_block_2 is under green_block_1 after step 2, so it's not clear. So we can't pick it up. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1. But orange_block_1 is currently under red_block_1 and black_block_1. So to do that, we need to first unstack black_block_1 and red_block_1.

Which we do in steps 3-5. Then after step 5, orange_block_1 is clear. Then in step 9, we pick it up and stack it on white_block_1. But we could instead stack it on black_block_1.

Wait, in step 9, after picking up orange_block_1, we could choose to stack it on black_block_1 instead of white_block_1. Then that would satisfy the condition for constraint 10.

Let's adjust the plan:

After step 5, we have orange_block_1 clear. Then:

9. pickup orange_block_1.

10. stack orange_block_1 black_block_1. Now orange_block_1 is on black_block_1, which is on the table. This satisfies the condition in constraint 10: after holding green_block_1 (step 1), in a later state, orange_block_1 is on black_block_1. So that's good.

But then, we need to have orange_block_1 on white_block_1 at some state for constraint 6. So perhaps after step 10, we need to unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_1 and stack it on white_block_1.

But that adds steps. Let's see:

11. unstack orange_block_1 black_block_1. Now holding orange_block_1. Black_block_1 becomes clear.

12. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1. Now it's on white_block_1. Then put it back? But the goal doesn't require orange_block_1's position. But constraint 6 requires that in some state, orange_block_1 is on white_block_1. So step 12 satisfies that.

But this adds more steps. Is there a way to do it with fewer steps?

Alternatively, when we stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1 (step 10), that satisfies the condition for constraint 10. But we still need to have orange_block_1 on white_block_1 at some point. So maybe after step 10, we need to move it to white_block_1.

But this is getting quite long. Let's summarize the steps so far:

1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2 → hold green_block_1.

2. stack green_block_1 red_block_2 → green on red2.

3. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1 → hold black_block_1.

4. putdown black_block_1 → black on table.

5. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1 → hold red_block_1. Orange1 clear.

6. stack red_block_1 green_block_1 → red1 on green1 (which is on red2).

7. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1 → hold orange2.

8. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1 → orange2 on black1 (on table).

9. pickup orange_block_1 → hold orange1.

10. stack orange_block_1 black_block_1 → orange1 on black1, which is under orange2. Wait, no. orange2 is on black1. So stacking orange1 on black1 is not possible because black1 has orange2 on top. So that's a mistake.

Wait, after step 8, black_block_1 has orange_block_2 on top. So black_block_1 is no longer clear. So step 10's stack would be impossible. So this approach has a flaw.

Ah, right. So after step 8, black_block_1 has orange_block_2 on it. So we can't stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1 in step 10. So this plan is invalid.

This indicates that the previous plan is incorrect. So we need to adjust.

Alternative approach: After step 4 (putdown black_block_1), we need to stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1 before moving orange_block_2.

Wait, after step 5: orange_block_1 is clear. So:

5. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1 → hold red_block_1. Orange1 clear.

6. stack red_block_1 green_block_1 → red1 on green1.

7. pickup orange_block_1 → hold orange1.

8. stack orange_block_1 black_block_1 → orange1 on black1 (which is on table).

Now, black_block_1 has orange_block_1 on it. Then, proceed to unstack orange_block_2:

9. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1 → hold orange2.

10. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1 → can't, because black_block_1 has orange_block_1 on it. So we need to unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_1 first.

11. unstack orange_block_1 black_block_1 → hold orange1.

12. putdown orange_block_1 → back to table.

13. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1.

But this is getting too long. There must be a better way.

Alternatively, after step 8 (stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1), perhaps we need to stack orange_block_2 on top of orange_block_1. But the goal is to have orange_block_2 on black_block_1, not on orange_block_1. So that wouldn't achieve the goal.

This is getting too complicated. Let's try a different approach.

Let me list all the constraints again and see which ones are the most restrictive:

- Constraint 8: When holding orange_block_2, must have prior state where red_block_1 is on green_block_1.

- Constraint 10: When holding green_block_1, in same or later state, either red_block_2 on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 on black_block_1.

- Constraint 6: orange_block_1 must be on white_block_1 in some state.

- Constraint 5: Must hold orange_block_1.

- Constraint 14: orange_block_1 must be clear in some state.

So perhaps the optimal plan involves moving red_block_1 to green_block_1, then moving green_block_1 and orange_block_2, while also moving orange_block_1 onto white_block_1.

Let me try to outline the steps again, carefully:

1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2 → hold green_block_1.

At this point, constraint 10 requires that after holding green_block_1, either red_block_2 is on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 is on black_block_1. So after step 1, we need to ensure that one of these happens.

So perhaps after step 1, stack green_block_1 on red_block_2 (step 2), then unstack black_block_1 (step 3), put it down (step 4), unstack red_block_1 (step 5), stack red_block_1 on green_block_1 (step 6). Then proceed.

But let's see:

1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2.

2. stack green_block_1 red_block_2 → now green on red2.

Now, constraint 10: after step 1 (holding green_block_1), we need to ensure that in some later state, either red_block_2 is on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 is on black_block_1.

If we stack green_block_1 on red_block_2 (step 2), then red_block_2 is under green_block_1, so can't move. To get red_block_2 on orange_block_1, we would need to unstack green_block_1, which is possible but adds steps.

Alternatively, after step 1, stack green_block_1 on black_block_1.

But black_block_1 is on red_block_1. So:

1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2 → hold green_block_1.

2. stack green_block_1 black_block_1 → green on black_block_1.

Now, black_block_1 has green_block_1 on it. Then, we need to move black_block_1 to stack orange_block_2 on it. But black_block_1 is under green_block_1. So we have to unstack green_block_1 first. Which would require another step.

This seems messy. Perhaps another approach.

Let's consider stacking red_block_1 on green_block_1 first.

To do that:

- unstack black_block_1 red_block_1 → hold black_block_1.

- putdown black_block_1.

- unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1 → hold red_block_1.

- stack red_block_1 green_block_1 → red1 on green1.

Now, red_block_1 is on green_block_1 (which is on orange_block_2 on white_block_1). Then, unstack green_block_1 and orange_block_2.

But green_block_1 has red_block_1 on top. So to unstack green_block_1, we need to first unstack red_block_1.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the optimal plan requires a certain order.

Another angle: The goal is to have orange_block_2 on black_block_1. Currently, black_block_1 is on red_block_1. So to have orange_block_2 on black_block_1, black_block_1 must remain where it is (on red_block_1), and orange_block_2 is stacked on it. But black_block_1 is clear, so that's possible.

So, if we can get orange_block_2 into the air and stack it on black_block_1 without moving black_block_1, that would be ideal.

To do that, we need to unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1, which requires unstacking green_block_1 first.

So steps:

1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2 → hold green_block_1.

2. stack green_block_1 red_block_2 → green on red2.

3. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1 → hold orange2.

4. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1 → done. Goal achieved.

But this plan has only four steps. Now, check the constraints.

Constraint 8: When holding orange_block_2 (step 3), there must be a prior state where red_block_1 is on green_block_1. But in this plan, red_block_1 is still on orange_block_1. So this constraint is not satisfied. Hence, the plan is invalid.

Thus, we need to include moving red_block_1 to green_block_1 before step 3.

So inserting steps to move red_block_1:

1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2 → hold green_block_1.

2. stack green_block_1 red_block_2 → green on red2.

3. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1 → hold black_block_1.

4. putdown black_block_1 → black on table.

5. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1 → hold red_block_1.

6. stack red_block_1 green_block_1 → red on green (now green is on red2).

7. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1 → hold orange2.

8. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1 → done.

Now, check constraint 8: when holding orange_block_2 (step 7), prior state (step 6) has red_block_1 on green_block_1. Yes. So satisfied.

Now, check other constraints:

Constraint 2: black_block_1 not on table in at least one state. Initial state satisfies this. So ok.

Constraint 2's other part: if black_block_1 is not on table (initial state), then red_block_1 must be clear in that state or after. In step 5, red_block_1 is unsticked, making it clear. So after step 5, red_block_1 is clear. So this is satisfied.

Constraint 3: white_block_1 clear in at least one state. After step 7, white_block_1 is clear. So satisfied.

Constraint 4: if white_block_1 is clear (step 7), there must be an earlier state where orange_block_1 is clear. Orange_block_1 becomes clear in step 5 when red_block_1 is unsticked. So step 5 is before step 7. Satisfied.

Constraint 5: holding orange_block_1. Not in this plan. So need to add steps to hold orange_block_1.

Oh right, constraint 5 requires that we hold orange_block_1 in some state. So current plan doesn't do that. So we need to add steps to pickup orange_block_1.

So after step 5, orange_block_1 is clear. So:

6. pickup orange_block_1 → hold orange1.

7. putdown orange_block_1 → to satisfy that we have to hold it. But this adds steps. Or stack it somewhere.

But constraint 6 requires that orange_block_1 is on white_block_1 in some state. So we can stack it there.

So:

6. pickup orange_block_1.

7. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1.

Now, this satisfies constraints 5 and 6.

Then proceed:

8. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1 → but orange_block_1 is now on white_block_1. Wait, no. After step 7, orange_block_1 is on white_block_1, and we need to unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1. Wait, no. Red_block_1 was moved in step 5.

Wait, in step 5, after unstacking red_block_1 from orange_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear. Then in step 6, we pick it up and stack it on white_block_1. Then, in step 7, we stack red_block_1 on green_block_1.

Wait, adjusting the steps:

After step 5: unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1 → red_block_1 in hand, orange_block_1 clear.

6. stack red_block_1 green_block_1 → red1 on green1.

7. pickup orange_block_1 → hold orange1.

8. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1 → orange1 on white_block_1.

9. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1 → but white_block_1 now has orange_block_1. So orange_block_2 is not on white_block_1 anymore. Wait, no. Initially, orange_block_2 is on white_block_1. After step 1 and 2, green_block_1 is moved to red_block_2. Then, orange_block_2 is still on white_block_1 until step 9. But in step 8, we stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1. So white_block_1 now has orange_block_1 and orange_block_2? No, because when you stack a block on another, you remove it from wherever it was. Wait, no. The blocks are stacked. Initially, white_block_1 has orange_block_2, which has green_block_1. After step 1, green_block_1 is moved. So orange_block_2 is on white_block_1. Then in step 8, we stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1, so now white_block_1 has orange_block_1, and orange_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1. But this is not possible unless we moved orange_block_2 first.

This indicates a mistake. Because when we unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1 (step 9), but after step 8, white_block_1 has orange_block_1, and orange_block_2 is still on white_block_1. Wait, no. Initially, white_block_1 has orange_block_2. When we unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2 (step 1), orange_block_2 remains on white_block_1. Then, in step 8, we stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1. So white_block_1 now has two blocks: orange_block_1 on the table, and orange_block_2 on top of orange_block_1? But you can't stack on a block that's already on the table. Wait, no. The white_block_1 is on the table. When you stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1, white_block_1 now has orange_block_1. If orange_block_2 is still on white_block_1, that's impossible because you can't have two blocks on the same block. So this indicates that the step of stacking orange_block_1 on white_block_1 is only possible if white_block_1 is clear. But after step 1, white_block_1 has orange_block_2. So step 8 (stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1) would require white_block_1 to be clear, which it's not. So this is invalid.

This is a critical error. So after step 1, orange_block_2 is still on white_block_1. So in step 8, when we try to stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1, white_block_1 is not clear (it has orange_block_2). So the stack action is impossible.

This means that we need to unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1 before stacking orange_block_1 there. But unstacking orange_block_2 requires that it's clear. Initially, orange_block_2 has green_block_1 on it. After step 1, green_block_1 is moved, so orange_block_2 is clear. So:

So after step 2 (stack green_block_1 on red_block_2), orange_block_2 is clear and on white_block_1. So we can unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1 (step 3), then stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1.

But then, we need to hold orange_block_2, which triggers constraint 8. So we need to ensure that before step 3, red_block_1 is on green_block_1.

This is getting very complex. Let's try to outline the steps correctly:

1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2 → hold green_block_1.

2. stack green_block_1 red_block_2 → green on red2.

3. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1 → hold orange2.

4. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1 → orange2 on black1.

But this fails constraint 8, because when holding orange_block_2 (step 3), there's no prior state where red_block_1 is on green_block_1.

So need to insert steps to move red_block_1 to green_block_1 before step 3.

So:

1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2 → hold green_block_1.

2. stack green_block_1 red_block_2 → green on red2.

3. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1 → hold black_block_1.

4. putdown black_block_1 → black on table.

5. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1 → hold red_block_1.

6. stack red_block_1 green_block_1 → red on green (now green is on red2).

Now, red_block_1 is on green_block_1.

7. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1 → hold orange2.

8. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1 → done.

But still missing the steps to hold orange_block_1 and put it on white_block_1.

After step 5, orange_block_1 is clear. So:

7. pickup orange_block_1 → hold orange1.

8. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1 → orange1 on white_block_1.

9. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1 → can't, because white_block_1 now has orange_block_1. So orange_block_2 is no longer on white_block_1. This indicates a mistake.

Ah, right. After step 1 and 2, orange_block_2 is still on white_block_1. Then in step 7, we unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1. But after step 8, we stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1. So the steps are:

1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2 → hold green_block_1.

2. stack green_block_1 red_block_2 → green on red2.

3. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1 → hold black_block_1.

4. putdown black_block_1 → black on table.

5. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1 → hold red_block_1.

6. stack red_block_1 green_block_1 → red on green.

7. pickup orange_block_1 → hold orange1.

8. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1 → orange1 on white_block_1.

9. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1 → but white_block_1 now has orange_block_1. So orange_block_2 is not on white_block_1 anymore. So this is impossible.

This is a contradiction. So the error arises because after step 8, we assume orange_block_2 is still on white_block_1, but it's not. The initial position of orange_block_2 was on white_block_1, but after step 1, when we unstack green_block_1, orange_block_2 remains on white_block_1. Then in step 9, we try to unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1, which is valid. But after step 8, we stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1. So white_block_1 now has orange_block_1. Therefore, orange_block_2 can't be on white_block_1 anymore. This indicates that the plan is invalid.

So, the correct order must be to unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1 before stacking orange_block_1 on white_block_1.

So:

After step 6 (stack red_block_1 on green_block_1):

7. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1 → hold orange2.

8. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1 → done.

9. pickup orange_block_1 → hold orange1.

10. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1 → satisfies constraints 5 and 6.

This way, we unstack orange_block_2 before stacking orange_block_1 on white_block_1.

So the steps would be:

1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2 → hold green_block_1.

2. stack green_block_1 red_block_2 → green on red2.

3. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1 → hold black_block_1.

4. putdown black_block_1 → black on table.

5. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1 → hold red_block_1.

6. stack red_block_1 green_block_1 → red on green.

7. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1 → hold orange2.

8. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1 → goal achieved.

9. pickup orange_block_1 → hold orange1.

10. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1 → satisfies constraint 6.

But step 9 and 10 are after the goal is achieved, which is allowed since the constraints just require that certain conditions hold in some state.

But we need to check all constraints:

- Constraint 5: holding orange_block_1 → step 9.

- Constraint 6: orange_block_1 on white_block_1 → step 10.

- Constraint 8: when holding orange_block_2 (step 7), prior state step 6 has red_block_1 on green_block_1. Yes.

- Constraint 10: when holding green_block_1 (step 1), in some later state, either red_block_2 on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 on black_block_1. After step 10, orange_block_1 is on white_block_1, which doesn't satisfy the condition. But in step 9, we picked up orange_block_1, which requires that in step 9 or after, either red_block_2 is on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 is on black_block_1. At step 9, we are holding orange_block_1. So during step 9, we need to have either red_block_2 on orange_block_1 (no) or orange_block_1 on black_block_1 (no). After step 10, orange_block_1 is on white_block_1. So this constraint is not satisfied.

This is a problem. So step 9: when holding orange_block_1 (constraint 5), we need to ensure that in that state or later, either red_block_2 is on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 is on black_block_1.

But in our plan, after step 9, we stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1. So neither condition is met. Thus, the constraint is violated.

To fix this, when holding orange_block_1 in step 9, we need to either stack it on black_block_1 (which is on the table) or stack red_block_2 on orange_block_1.

Stacking red_block_2 on orange_block_1 would require unstacking red_block_2 from under green_block_1. But green_block_1 is on red_block_2, so red_block_2 is not clear. So we can't pick it up.

Alternatively, stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1 (step 10 instead of stacking on white_block_1). Then:

10. stack orange_block_1 black_block_1 → now orange1 on black1 (which is on table). This satisfies the condition for constraint 10.

But then, constraint 6 requires orange_block_1 to be on white_block_1 in some state. So we need to unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_1 and stack it on white_block_1.

11. unstack orange_block_1 black_block_1 → hold orange1.

12. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1 → now on white_block_1.

This adds steps but satisfies all constraints.

But this makes the plan longer. Is there a way to optimize?

Alternatively, after step 8 (goal achieved), can we stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1 (which already has orange_block_2 on it)? No, because black_block_1 is under orange_block_2, which is clear. So we can stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1 only if black_block_1 is clear. But it's not. So that's impossible.

Another idea: After step 8, black_block_1 has orange_block_2 on it. So to stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1, we need to unstack orange_block_2 first. But that would undo the goal.

This is getting extremely complicated. Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct plan involves the following steps, which may be longer but satisfy all constraints:

1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2
2. stack green_block_1 red_block_2
3. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1
4. putdown black_block_1
5. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1
6. stack red_block_1 green_block_1
7. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1
8. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1
9. pickup orange_block_1
10. stack orange_block_1 black_block_1
11. unstack orange_block_1 black_block_1
12. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1

But this ensures that after step 9 (holding orange_block_1), we stack it on black_block_1 (step 10), satisfying constraint 10. Then, unstack and stack on white_block_1 for constraint 6. However, step 10 is impossible because black_block_1 has orange_block_2 on it (from step 8). So we can't stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1.

Alternative plan:

After step 8 (orange_block_2 on black_block_1), we can put orange_block_1 on white_block_1, but that requires:

9. pickup orange_block_1 (clear after step 5)
10. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1

This satisfies constraints 5 and 6.

But when we hold orange_block_1 (step 9), we need to ensure that in that state or after, either red_block_2 is on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 is on black_block_1.

In step 10, we stack it on white_block_1. So neither condition is met. Thus, constraint 10 is violated.

So we need to instead, after step 9, stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1. But black_block_1 has orange_block_2 on it. So impossible.

This is a dead end. So the only way to satisfy constraint 10 when holding green_block_1 (step 1) is to ensure that in some later state, either red_block_2 is on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 is on black_block_1.

But how?

After step 1, we have green_block_1 in hand. We stack it on red_block_2 (step 2). Then, red_block_2 is under green_block_1. So red_block_2 cannot be moved. So the only option is to stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1.

But orange_block_1 is under red_block_1 and black_block_1 initially. So we need to unstack them.

After step 5, orange_block_1 is clear. So in step 5, after unstacking red_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear. Then, in step 9, pickup orange_block_1 and stack it on black_block_1 (step 10), which is on the table.

But in step 10, black_block_1 is on the table and clear. So stacking orange_block_1 on black_block_1 is possible.

Then, after step 10, orange_block_1 is on black_block_1, satisfying constraint 10.

Then, unstack orange_block_1 to stack on white_block_1:

11. unstack orange_block_1 black_block_1 → hold orange1.

12. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1.

Now, all constraints are satisfied:

- When holding green_block_1 (step 1), in step 10, orange_block_1 is on black_block_1.

- When holding orange_block_2 (step 7), prior step 6 has red_block_1 on green_block_1.

- All other constraints are checked.

Thus, the final plan would be:

1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2
2. stack green_block_1 red_block_2
3. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1
4. putdown black_block_1
5. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1
6. stack red_block_1 green_block_1
7. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1
8. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1
9. pickup orange_block_1
10. stack orange_block_1 black_block_1
11. unstack orange_block_1 black_block_1
12. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1

But step 10 is stacking orange_block_1 on black_block_1, which is on the table. Then step 11 unstacking it to stack on white_block_1.

But this adds steps. However, given the constraints, it's necessary.

Let me check all constraints again with this plan:

- Constraint 1: black_block_1 not on table in at least one state. Initial state and steps 3-4 (after putdown, it's on table). But initial state satisfies it.

- Constraint 2: If black_block_1 is not on table (initial state), then red_block_1 clear in s or after. After step 5, red_block_1 is clear.

- Constraint 3: white_block_1 clear in step 7 (after unstacking orange_block_2).

- Constraint 4: When white_block_1 is clear (step 7), prior state step 5 (orange_block_1 clear).

- Constraint 5: holding orange_block_1 in step 9.

- Constraint 6: orange_block_1 on white_block_1 in step 12.

- Constraint 7: holding orange_block_2 in step 7.

- Constraint 8: when holding orange_block_2 (step 7), prior state step 6 (red_block_1 on green_block_1).

- Constraint 9: holding green_block_1 in step 1.

- Constraint 10: when holding green_block_1 (step 1), in step 10, orange_block_1 is on black_block_1.

- Constraint 11: black_block_1 not on white_block_1 in all states. True.

- Constraint 12: If black_block_1 not on white_block_1 (always true), then red_block_1 clear in step 5 or after.

- Constraint 13: green_block_1 not on table. It's stacked on red_block_2 in step 2.

- Constraint 14: orange_block_1 clear in step 5.

- Constraint 15: Either holding orange_block_1 (step 9) or red_block_1 clear (step 5). Both are true.

This plan satisfies all constraints. However, is it optimal? The user asks for an optimal plan with minimal steps. This plan has 12 steps, which might not be optimal. But given the complexity of the constraints, it might be the best possible.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. Let's see:

After step 8, the goal is achieved. Steps 9-12 are to satisfy constraints related to orange_block_1. Is there a way to combine some steps?

For example, after step 5 (orange_block_1 clear), we can pickup orange_block_1 (step 6), stack it on white_block_1 (step 7), then proceed with moving red_block_1 and orange_block_2.

But let's try:

1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2
2. stack green_block_1 red_block_2
3. pickup orange_block_1
4. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1
5. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1
6. putdown black_block_1
7. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1
8. stack red_block_1 green_block_1
9. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1
10. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1

Now, check constraints:

- Constraint 8: when holding orange_block_2 (step 9), prior step 8 has red_block_1 on green_block_1. Yes.

- Constraint 10: when holding green_block_1 (step 1), after step 4, orange_block_1 is on white_block_1. Not on black_block_1 or red_block_2 on orange_block_1. So violates constraint 10.

Thus, this plan is invalid.

Another try:

1. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1
2. putdown black_block_1
3. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1
4. stack red_block_1 green_block_1
5. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2
6. stack green_block_1 red_block_2
7. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1
8. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1
9. pickup orange_block_1
10. stack orange_block_1 white_block_1

This plan might work. Let's check constraints:

- Constraint 8: when holding orange_block_2 (step 7), prior step 4 has red_block_1 on green_block_1. Yes.

- Constraint 10: when holding green_block_1 (step 5), in step 4, red_block_1 is on green_block_1, but that's before holding green_block_1. So after step 5, need to ensure either red_block_2 on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 on black_block_1. After step 5, orange_block_1 is clear. Then step 9 picks it up and stacks it on white_block_1. So no. So constraint 10 is violated.

This shows how challenging this problem is. After multiple iterations, the initial long plan seems to be the only way to satisfy all constraints.

Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial longer plan, ensuring all constraints are met.
