Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld problem. So, the initial state is a bit complex with several blocks arranged in different stacks. The goal is to get orange_block_2 on top of black_block_1. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to visualize the initial setup. Let's list out the blocks and their positions:

- orange_block_1 is on the table, with red_block_1 on top of it, and black_block_1 on top of red_block_1. So the stack here is orange_block_1 -> red_block_1 -> black_block_1, and black_block_1 is clear.

- white_block_1 is on the table, with orange_block_2 on top, and green_block_1 on top of orange_block_2. So the stack is white_block_1 -> orange_block_2 -> green_block_1, with green_block_1 clear.

- red_block_2 is alone on the table and clear.

The goal is to have orange_block_2 on black_block_1. So we need to move orange_block_2 from its current position (on white_block_1, under green_block_1) to be on top of black_block_1.

Constraints? The problem says to abide by the constraints, which are the usual Blocksworld action preconditions. So I need to make sure each action's preconditions are met.

Let's think about the steps needed. To move orange_block_2, which is currently under green_block_1, we first need to remove green_block_1. Because green_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2, we can't move orange_block_2 until green_block_1 is moved. So first, unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2 and put it somewhere, maybe on the table.

But wait, the unstack action requires that the block being unstacked (green_block_1) is clear, which it is. Also, the arm must be empty. So first, unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2. Then put it down. Then, we can pick up orange_block_2, but wait, orange_block_2 is on white_block_1. To pick up orange_block_2 from the table, it has to be clear and on the table. But in this case, orange_block_2 is on white_block_1, not the table. So to move orange_block_2, we need to unstack it from white_block_1. But before that, there's nothing on top of orange_block_2 except green_block_1, which we've already moved. Wait, no: after moving green_block_1, orange_block_2 is clear. So then, unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1. Wait, but unstack is for when the block is on top of another block. Yes, orange_block_2 is on white_block_1, so unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1. Then, we can stack it onto black_block_1. But black_block_1 is currently on top of red_block_1, which is on orange_block_1. So black_block_1 is clear. So stacking orange_block_2 onto black_block_1 is possible if the arm is holding orange_block_2 and black_block_1 is clear.

So the steps would be:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2. Then put it down on the table. Now, orange_block_2 is clear.

2. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1. Now, the arm is holding orange_block_2.

3. Stack orange_block_2 onto black_block_1. But wait, is black_block_1 clear? Initially, yes. But after step 2, when we unstacked orange_block_2, we had to make sure that nothing else is on top of black_block_1. Let me check the initial state again. In the original state, black_block_1 is on red_block_1 and is clear. So during the process, unless we disturb that stack, it remains. But if we don't touch that stack, black_block_1 is still clear. So yes, after step 2, the arm is holding orange_block_2, and black_block_1 is clear, so stacking is possible.

Wait, but in the initial state, black_block_1 is on red_block_1. So to stack orange_block_2 onto black_block_1, we need to have the arm holding orange_block_2 and black_block_1 being clear. Which it is. So that's possible.

So the steps would be:

- Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2. Then putdown green_block_1.

- Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1. Then stack it onto black_block_1.

Wait, but after unstacking orange_block_2, the arm is holding it. Then, to stack it on black_block_1, which is clear, that's allowed. So that would achieve the goal.

But let me check the preconditions for each action.

First action: unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2. Preconditions: green_block_1 is on orange_block_2, green_block_1 is clear (which it is), and the arm is empty. Initially, the arm is empty, so yes. So unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2. Then, putdown green_block_1. Because after unstacking, the arm is holding green_block_1. Putdown requires holding the block, so that's okay. Then, after putdown, green_block_1 is on the table, clear.

Then, unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1. Preconditions: orange_block_2 is on white_block_1, orange_block_2 is clear (after removing green_block_1, yes), arm is empty (after putdown, yes). So that's possible. Then, stack orange_block_2 onto black_block_1. Preconditions: holding orange_block_2 (after unstack, yes) and black_block_1 is clear (initially yes, and since we didn't touch that stack, it remains clear). So that's allowed.

So the plan would be:

unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2

putdown green_block_1

unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1

stack orange_block_2 black_block_1

That's four actions. Is there a shorter plan? Let's see. Is there a way to avoid moving green_block_1? No, because orange_block_2 is under green_block_1, so we have to move green_block_1 first. So the steps above seem necessary.

Wait, but maybe there's another way. Suppose instead of putting green_block_1 on the table, can we stack it somewhere else? But that would require more steps. The optimal plan is the shortest possible. Putting it on the table is the fastest.

So the plan I have is four steps. Let me verify each step's effects.

1. unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2: now, green_block_1 is held, orange_block_2 is clear.

2. putdown green_block_1: green_block_1 is on table, clear. Arm empty.

3. unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1: arm holds orange_block_2, white_block_1 becomes clear.

4. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1: orange_block_2 is on black_block_1, which is now not clear. Arm empty.

This achieves the goal. Are there any constraints I'm missing? The problem mentions to follow all constraints, which are the preconditions of the actions. Each action here meets the preconditions. Yes.

So this should be the optimal plan.
