Let's analyze the initial state and the goal state to create a plan.

Initial State:
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- orange_block_2 is on top of white_block_1
- black_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- green_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2
- red_block_2 is on the table
- black_block_1 is clear
- green_block_1 is clear
- red_block_2 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Goal State:
- orange_block_2 is on top of black_block_1

Currently, orange_block_2 is under green_block_1 and on top of white_block_1. Black_block_1 is on top of red_block_1, which is on top of orange_block_1.

Let's visualize the initial state:

```
     black_block_1      green_block_1     red_block_2
          |                   |
     red_block_1        orange_block_2
          |                   |
     orange_block_1      white_block_1
          |                   |
        table              table             table
```

Let's visualize the goal state:

```
     orange_block_2
          |
     black_block_1
          |
     red_block_1
          |
     orange_block_1
          |
        table
```

We need to:
1. Move green_block_1 from orange_block_2 so that orange_block_2 becomes clear
2. Move orange_block_2 from white_block_1
3. Move black_block_1 from red_block_1 (this is probably not necessary, since we just need orange_block_2 on top of black_block_1, not the other way around)
4. Place orange_block_2 on top of black_block_1

Actually, let me re-read the goal. The goal is "orange_block_2 is on top of black_block_1". This means that we need to have orange_block_2 on top of black_block_1, not black_block_1 on top of orange_block_2.

So, the goal state should look something like:

```
      ???
       |
  orange_block_2
       |
  black_block_1
       |
      ???
```

We don't really care about the arrangement of other blocks, as long as orange_block_2 is on top of black_block_1. 

Given that, let's revise our plan:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2 so that orange_block_2 becomes clear
2. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1
3. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1
4. Place orange_block_2 on top of black_block_1 (stack operation)

Let's create this plan step by step:

1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2
2. putdown green_block_1
3. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1
4. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1
5. putdown black_block_1
6. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1

But this doesn't look right. Let me trace through this with the correct sequence of blocks being held.

Start:
- You are not holding any block.
- black_block_1, green_block_1, and red_block_2 are clear.

Step 1: unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2
- Effect: You are holding green_block_1, and orange_block_2 is clear.

Step 2: putdown green_block_1
- Effect: green_block_1 is on the table and clear, and you are not holding any block.

Step 3: unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1
- Precondition: orange_block_2 is clear, and you are not holding any block.
- Effect: You are holding orange_block_2, and white_block_1 is clear.

At this point, you are holding orange_block_2. But for Step 4, you need to unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1, which requires you to not be holding any block.

Let me adjust our plan:

1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2
2. putdown green_block_1
3. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1
4. putdown orange_block_2
5. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1
6. putdown black_block_1
7. pickup orange_block_2
8. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1

But we're still not efficiently placing orange_block_2 on top of black_block_1. Let's see if we can optimize this.

Actually, I think we can have a more efficient plan by taking advantage of the fact that black_block_1 is already clear in the initial state. Let's revise:

1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2
2. putdown green_block_1
3. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1
4. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1

This gives us our goal: orange_block_2 is on top of black_block_1.

Let's verify that this plan is valid by going over the preconditions and effects at each step:

Start:
- You are not holding any block.
- black_block_1, green_block_1, and red_block_2 are clear.

Step 1: unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2
- Precondition: green_block_1 is clear, green_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2, and you are not holding any block.
- Effect: You are holding green_block_1, and orange_block_2 is clear.

Step 2: putdown green_block_1
- Precondition: You are holding green_block_1.
- Effect: green_block_1 is on the table and clear, and you are not holding any block.

Step 3: unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1
- Precondition: orange_block_2 is clear, orange_block_2 is on top of white_block_1, and you are not holding any block.
- Effect: You are holding orange_block_2, and white_block_1 is clear.

Step 4: stack orange_block_2 black_block_1
- Precondition: You are holding orange_block_2, and black_block_1 is clear.
- Effect: orange_block_2 is on top of black_block_1, orange_block_2 is clear, black_block_1 is not clear, and you are not holding any block.

This plan achieves our goal of having orange_block_2 on top of black_block_1. It is valid and efficient.

So, our final plan is:

1. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2
2. putdown green_block_1
3. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1
4. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1

Let me double-check if this plan achieves the goal and respects all constraints:

- After step 4, orange_block_2 is on top of black_block_1, which satisfies our goal.
- The plan respects all preconditions of each action.
- The plan consists of 4 steps, which seems to be the minimum number of steps required to achieve the goal.

Actually, let me double-check again as I notice we have to follow a specific format for the plan:

```
unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2
putdown green_block_1
unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1
stack orange_block_2 black_block_1
```

Each action is on a separate line, and for each action, we have the action name followed by its arguments. This seems to match the required format.

I don't see any constraints mentioned in the problem statement, so I believe this plan is valid and optimal. Let's review one more time:

- We are moving green_block_1 and orange_block_2 to get orange_block_2 on top of black_block_1, which is our goal.
- The plan is minimal; we can't achieve the goal in fewer than 4 steps.
- We've verified that each action's preconditions are met before it's executed.

So, our final plan is:

```
unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2
putdown green_block_1
unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1
stack orange_block_2 black_block_1
```

I think this is the correct and most efficient plan for the given problem.
