Let's analyze this planning problem step by step. I need to find an optimal sequence of actions to achieve the goal while satisfying all the given constraints.

First, let's understand the goal:
- "orange_block_2 is on top of black_block_1"

Now, let's analyze the initial state:
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- orange_block_2 is on top of white_block_1
- black_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- green_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2
- red_block_2 is on the table
- black_block_1 is clear
- green_block_1 is clear
- red_block_2 is clear
- You are not holding any block

So, the initial configuration is:
```
    black_block_1     green_block_1     red_block_2
    red_block_1       orange_block_2
    orange_block_1    white_block_1     table
    table             table
```

And the goal is to have orange_block_2 on top of black_block_1:
```
                      orange_block_2
                      black_block_1
                      [...]
```

Now, let's consider the constraints:

1. "black_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in at least one state.
   - Initially, black_block_1 is on red_block_1, so this constraint is already satisfied.

2. If "black_block_1 is not on the table" holds in some state s, then "red_block_1 is clear" must hold at s or at some state after s.
   - Initially, black_block_1 is on red_block_1, so red_block_1 is not clear. We need to ensure that red_block_1 becomes clear at some point after or during the time black_block_1 is not on the table.

3. "white_block_1 is clear" must hold in at least one state.
   - Initially, white_block_1 has orange_block_2 on it, so we need to remove orange_block_2 at some point.

4. If "white_block_1 is clear" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which "orange_block_1 is clear" is true.
   - Initially, orange_block_1 has red_block_1 on it, so it's not clear. We need to ensure orange_block_1 becomes clear before white_block_1 becomes clear.

5. "you are holding orange_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - This means we need to pick up orange_block_1 at some point.

6. "orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - This means we need to stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1 at some point.

7. "you are holding orange_block_2" must hold in at least one state.
   - This means we need to pick up orange_block_2 at some point.

8. If "you are holding orange_block_2" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which "red_block_1 is on top of green_block_1" is true.
   - This means before we pick up orange_block_2, we need to ensure red_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 at some point.

9. "you are holding green_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - This means we need to pick up green_block_1 at some point.

10. If "you are holding green_block_1" holds in some state s, then "red_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1" OR "orange_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" must hold at s or at some state after s.
    - This means after we pick up green_block_1, we need to ensure one of those conditions is met.

11. "black_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
    - This seems to always be true since black_block_1 is initially on red_block_1, not white_block_1.

12. If "black_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" holds in some state s, then "red_block_1 is clear" must hold at s or at some state after s.
    - Since "black_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is always true, we need to ensure "red_block_1 is clear" is true at some point.

13. "green_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in every state.
    - Initially, green_block_1 is on orange_block_2, not on the table, so this is satisfied initially. We need to ensure green_block_1 never goes directly to the table.

14. "orange_block_1 is clear" must hold in at least one state.
    - Initially, orange_block_1 has red_block_1 on it, so it's not clear. We need to ensure orange_block_1 becomes clear at some point.

15. "you are holding orange_block_1" OR "red_block_1 is clear" must hold in at least one state.
    - This is a combination of constraints 5 and 12.

Let me now try to come up with a valid plan. I need to achieve the goal while satisfying all the constraints.

First, let's think about our most challenging constraints:

- We need to pick up orange_block_2 at some point, and before that, red_block_1 needs to be on top of green_block_1.
- We need to pick up green_block_1 at some point, and after that, either red_block_2 needs to be on top of orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 needs to be on top of black_block_1.
- "orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
- green_block_1 should never be placed directly on the table.

Let's try to plan backwards from the goal:

The goal is to have orange_block_2 on top of black_block_1.

To stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1, we need to be holding orange_block_2 and black_block_1 needs to be clear.

To pick up orange_block_2, we need orange_block_2 to be clear and either on the table or on another block.

Let's start by trying to satisfy as many constraints as possible while reaching the goal:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1. This makes red_block_1 clear, satisfying constraint 2 and part of constraint 12.
2. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2. This allows us to pick up orange_block_2 later.
3. Now, to satisfy constraint 8, we need to ensure red_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 before we pick up orange_block_2. So, stack red_block_1 on green_block_1.
4. To satisfy constraint 10, after we pick up green_block_1, either red_block_2 should be on top of orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 should be on top of black_block_1. Let's choose the latter.
5. We need to make orange_block_1 clear (constraint 14). To do this, we need to unstack red_block_1.
6. Stack black_block_1 on the table.
7. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1.
8. Stack red_block_1 on the table.
9. Now, orange_block_1 is clear. Pick up orange_block_1 (satisfying constraint 5).
10. We need orange_block_1 to be on top of white_block_1 at some point (constraint 6). But white_block_1 currently has orange_block_2 on it. We also need white_block_1 to be clear at some point (constraint 3). Let's plan for that.
11. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1. This makes white_block_1 clear, satisfying constraint 3.
12. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1, satisfying constraint 6.
13. We also need to pick up green_block_1 at some point (constraint 9).
14. Unstack orange_block_1 from white_block_1.
15. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1, satisfying the second part of constraint 10.
16. Pick up green_block_1, satisfying constraint 9. Since orange_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, constraint 10 is satisfied.
17. Finally, stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1, reaching the goal. But wait, this can't be done because black_block_1 isn't clear yet (it has orange_block_1 on it).

Alright, let's rethink the plan a bit. I need to ensure all constraints are satisfied while still reaching the goal.

Wait, I'm making a mistake. I can't simply stack black_block_1 on the table because constraint 1 states that "black_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in at least one state, which is already satisfied in the initial state. It's not saying black_block_1 should never be on the table.

Let me rethink the plan more carefully.

The goal is to have orange_block_2 on top of black_block_1.

To stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1, we need to be holding orange_block_2 and black_block_1 needs to be clear.

Actually, let me recheck my understanding of the constraints. If I'm reading them correctly, a lot of the "must hold in at least one state" constraints are already satisfied in the initial state or will be satisfied naturally as we work towards the goal. 

Let me break down the constraints more clearly:

1. ✓ "black_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in at least one state.
   - Already satisfied in the initial state since black_block_1 is on red_block_1.

2. If "black_block_1 is not on the table" holds in some state s, then "red_block_1 is clear" must hold at s or at some state after s.
   - Since "black_block_1 is not on the table" is true in the initial state, we need to ensure red_block_1 becomes clear at some point.

3. ✘ "white_block_1 is clear" must hold in at least one state.
   - Not initially satisfied. We'll need to clear white_block_1 at some point.

4. If "white_block_1 is clear" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which "orange_block_1 is clear" is true.
   - This means we need to make orange_block_1 clear before white_block_1 becomes clear.

5. ✘ "you are holding orange_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - Not initially satisfied. We'll need to pick up orange_block_1 at some point.

6. ✘ "orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - Not initially satisfied. We'll need to stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1 at some point.

7. ✘ "you are holding orange_block_2" must hold in at least one state.
   - Not initially satisfied. We'll need to pick up orange_block_2 at some point.

8. If "you are holding orange_block_2" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which "red_block_1 is on top of green_block_1" is true.
   - This means before we pick up orange_block_2, we need to ensure red_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 at some point.

9. ✘ "you are holding green_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - Not initially satisfied. We'll need to pick up green_block_1 at some point.

10. If "you are holding green_block_1" holds in some state s, then "red_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1" OR "orange_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" must hold at s or at some state after s.
    - This means after we pick up green_block_1, we need to ensure one of those conditions is met.

11. ✓ "black_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
    - Already satisfied in the initial state since black_block_1 is on red_block_1, not white_block_1.

12. If "black_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" holds in some state s, then "red_block_1 is clear" must hold at s or at some state after s.
    - Since "black_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is true in the initial state, we need to ensure red_block_1 becomes clear at some point (this is also mentioned in constraint 2).

13. ✓ "green_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in every state.
    - Green_block_1 is not on the table initially. We need to ensure it never goes directly to the table in any state.

14. ✘ "orange_block_1 is clear" must hold in at least one state.
    - Not initially satisfied. We'll need to make orange_block_1 clear at some point.

15. ✘ "you are holding orange_block_1" OR "red_block_1 is clear" must hold in at least one state.
    - Not initially satisfied. We'll need to either pick up orange_block_1 or make red_block_1 clear at some point.

Now, let's try to come up with a valid plan again, keeping all these constraints in mind:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1. Now red_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraints 2, 12, and 15.
2. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2.
3. Stack green_block_1 on red_block_1 (to ensure green_block_1 doesn't go on the table, satisfying constraint 13).
4. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint 3. But we have an issue with constraint 4, which states that orange_block_1 must be clear before white_block_1 becomes clear. We need to ensure orange_block_1 becomes clear before this step.

Let's reconsider.

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1. Now red_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraints 2, 12, and 15.
2. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1. Now orange_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint 14 and setting up for constraint 4.
3. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2.
4. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1, satisfying constraint 8.
5. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is clear, and orange_block_1 was clear earlier, so constraint 4 is satisfied.
6. Pick up orange_block_1, satisfying constraint 5.
7. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1, satisfying constraint 6.
8. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1.
9. Unstack orange_block_1 from white_block_1.
10. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1, setting up for constraint 10.
11. Pick up green_block_1, satisfying constraint 9. Since orange_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, constraint 10 is satisfied.
12. Stack green_block_1 on red_block_1 (to ensure green_block_1 doesn't go on the table, satisfying constraint 13).
13. Pick up orange_block_2, satisfying constraint 7. Constraint 8 is satisfied because red_block_1 was on top of green_block_1 earlier.
14. Unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_1.
15. Stack orange_block_1 on red_block_2 (or any other clear block).
16. Stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1, achieving the goal.

However, I realize that step 9-15 might not be the most efficient. Let's optimize this plan.

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1. Now red_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraints 2, 12, and 15.
2. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1. Now orange_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint 14 and setting up for constraint 4.
3. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2.
4. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1, satisfying constraint 8.
5. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is clear, and orange_block_1 was clear earlier, so constraint 4 is satisfied.
6. Pick up orange_block_1, satisfying constraint 5.
7. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1, satisfying constraint 6.
8. Pick up orange_block_2, satisfying constraint 7. Constraint 8 is satisfied because red_block_1 was on top of green_block_1 earlier.
9. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1.
10. Pick up green_block_1, satisfying constraint 9.
11. Stack green_block_1 on red_block_2 (to ensure green_block_1 doesn't go on the table, satisfying constraint 13).
12. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1, setting up for constraint 10. Since we already picked up green_block_1 and now orange_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, constraint 10 is satisfied.
13. Stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1, achieving the goal. But wait, this can't be done because black_block_1 isn't clear yet (it has orange_block_1 on it).

I realize I made an error. Let me reconsider the plan more carefully, ensuring I'm correctly tracking the state of the world after each action.

The goal is to have orange_block_2 on top of black_block_1. Let's try again:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1. Now red_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraints 2, 12, and 15.
2. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1. Now orange_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint 14 and setting up for constraint 4.
3. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2.
4. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1, satisfying constraint 8.
5. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is clear, and orange_block_1 was clear earlier, so constraint 4 is satisfied.
6. Pick up orange_block_1, satisfying constraint 5.
7. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1, satisfying constraint 6.
8. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1.
9. Stack red_block_1 on orange_block_1. This is a temporary move to ensure other blocks can be moved.
10. Pick up green_block_1, satisfying constraint 9.
11. Stack green_block_1 on red_block_2 (to ensure green_block_1 doesn't go on the table, satisfying constraint 13).
12. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1.
13. Stack red_block_1 on red_block_2 (or any other clear block).
14. Unstack orange_block_1 from white_block_1.
15. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1, satisfying constraint 10 (which states that after holding green_block_1, "red_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1" OR "orange_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" must hold).
16. Pick up orange_block_2, satisfying constraint 7. Constraint 8 is satisfied because red_block_1 was on top of green_block_1 earlier.
17. Stack orange_block_2 on orange_block_1. This is a temporary move to ensure the end goal can be achieved.
18. Unstack orange_block_2 from orange_block_1.
19. Unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_1.
20. Stack orange_block_1 on red_block_1 (or any other clear block).
21. Stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1, achieving the goal.

However, this plan is quite long. Let me see if there's a more efficient way to satisfy all the constraints while achieving the goal.

Let's reconsider the key constraints:
- Before we hold orange_block_2, red_block_1 should be on top of green_block_1.
- After we hold green_block_1, either red_block_2 should be on top of orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 should be on top of black_block_1.
- orange_block_1 should be on top of white_block_1 at some point.
- green_block_1 should never be on the table.

Let's try to design a more efficient plan:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1. Now red_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraints 2, 12, and 15.
2. Stack black_block_1 on red_block_2. This is just to temporarily store black_block_1.
3. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1. Now orange_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint 14 and setting up for constraint 4.
4. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2.
5. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1, satisfying constraint 8.
6. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is clear, and orange_block_1 was clear earlier, so constraint 4 is satisfied.
7. Pick up orange_block_1, satisfying constraint 5.
8. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1, satisfying constraint 6.
9. Pick up orange_block_2, satisfying constraint 7. Constraint 8 is satisfied because red_block_1 was on top of green_block_1 earlier.
10. Stack orange_block_2 on orange_block_1. This is a temporary move to prepare for the end goal.
11. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1.
12. Pick up green_block_1, satisfying constraint 9.
13. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_2.
14. Stack green_block_1 on red_block_2 (to ensure green_block_1 doesn't go on the table, satisfying constraint 13).
15. Unstack orange_block_2 from orange_block_1.
16. Unstack orange_block_1 from white_block_1.
17. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1, satisfying constraint 10 (which states that after holding green_block_1, either red_block_2 should be on top of orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 should be on top of black_block_1).
18. Stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1. But wait, this can't be done because black_block_1 isn't clear yet (it has orange_block_1 on it).

Let me correct this. The goal is to have orange_block_2 on top of black_block_1.

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1. Now red_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraints 2, 12, and 15.
2. Stack black_block_1 on red_block_2. This is just to temporarily store black_block_1.
3. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1. Now orange_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint 14 and setting up for constraint 4.
4. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2.
5. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1, satisfying constraint 8.
6. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is clear, and orange_block_1 was clear earlier, so constraint 4 is satisfied.
7. Pick up orange_block_1, satisfying constraint 5.
8. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1, satisfying constraint 6.
9. Pick up orange_block_2, satisfying constraint 7. Constraint 8 is satisfied because red_block_1 was on top of green_block_1 earlier.
10. Stack orange_block_2 on red_block_1. This is a temporary move to prepare for the end goal.
11. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1 (but wait, this can't be done because orange_block_2 is on red_block_1).

Let me correct this. We need to ensure that the block states are correctly tracked at each step.

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1. Now red_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraints 2, 12, and 15.
2. Stack black_block_1 on red_block_2. This is just to temporarily store black_block_1.
3. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1. Now orange_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint 14 and setting up for constraint 4.
4. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2.
5. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1, satisfying constraint 8.
6. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is clear, and orange_block_1 was clear earlier, so constraint 4 is satisfied.
7. Pick up orange_block_1, satisfying constraint 5.
8. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1, satisfying constraint 6.
9. Pick up orange_block_2, satisfying constraint 7. Constraint 8 is satisfied because red_block_1 was on top of green_block_1 earlier.
10. Stack orange_block_2 on the table. This is a temporary move.
11. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1.
12. Stack red_block_1 on orange_block_1. This is a temporary move.
13. Pick up green_block_1, satisfying constraint 9.
14. Stack green_block_1 on orange_block_2 (to ensure green_block_1 doesn't go on the table, satisfying constraint 13).
15. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_2.
16. Stack black_block_1 on the table.
17. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1.
18. Stack red_block_1 on black_block_1.
19. Unstack orange_block_1 from white_block_1.
20. Stack orange_block_1 on red_block_1, satisfying constraint 10 (which states that after holding green_block_1, either red_block_2 should be on top of orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 should be on top of black_block_1. Here, orange_block_1 is indirectly on top of black_block_1, but that's not what the constraint specifically states. Let me rethink this).

Ok, the constraint is specific: "orange_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" means orange_block_1 is directly on top of black_block_1. Let me correct this.

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1. Now red_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraints 2, 12, and 15.
2. Stack black_block_1 on red_block_2. This is just to temporarily store black_block_1.
3. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1. Now orange_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint 14 and setting up for constraint 4.
4. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2.
5. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1, satisfying constraint 8.
6. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is clear, and orange_block_1 was clear earlier, so constraint 4 is satisfied.
7. Pick up orange_block_1, satisfying constraint 5.
8. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1, satisfying constraint 6.
9. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_2.
10. Stack black_block_1 on the table.
11. Pick up green_block_1, satisfying constraint 9. (Note: we need to ensure that either red_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 is on top of black_block_1 after this step, as specified by constraint 10).
12. Stack green_block_1 on orange_block_1 (to ensure green_block_1 doesn't go on the table, satisfying constraint 13).
13. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_1.
14. Stack green_block_1 on red_block_2 (to ensure green_block_1 doesn't go on the table, satisfying constraint 13).
15. Unstack orange_block_1 from white_block_1.
16. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1, satisfying constraint 10.
17. Pick up orange_block_2, satisfying constraint 7. Constraint 8 is satisfied because red_block_1 was on top of green_block_1 earlier.
18. Unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_1.
19. Stack orange_block_1 on red_block_1 (or any other clear block).
20. Stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1, achieving the goal.

Actually, this plan still seems inefficient. Let's make one more attempt to optimize the plan.

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1. Now red_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraints 2, 12, and 15.
2. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1. Now orange_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint 14 and setting up for constraint 4.
3. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2.
4. Stack green_block_1 on red_block_1 (to ensure green_block_1 doesn't go on the table, satisfying constraint 13).
5. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1, satisfying constraint 8. (Wait, this doesn't make sense. If green_block_1 is on red_block_1, I can't stack red_block_1 on green_block_1. Let me correct this).

Let me try again and be more careful with the state tracking:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1. Now red_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraints 2, 12, and 15.
2. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1. Now orange_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint 14 and setting up for constraint 4.
3. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2.
4. Stack green_block_1 on black_block_1 (to ensure green_block_1 doesn't go on the table, satisfying constraint 13).
5. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is clear, and orange_block_1 was clear earlier, so constraint 4 is satisfied.
6. Pick up orange_block_1, satisfying constraint 5.
7. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1, satisfying constraint 6.
8. Pick up red_block_1.
9. Stack red_block_1 on orange_block_1.
10. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_1.
11. Pick up black_block_1.
12. Stack black_block_1 on red_block_2.
13. Stack green_block_1 on red_block_1, satisfying constraint 8.
14. Pick up orange_block_2, satisfying constraint 7. Constraint 8 is satisfied because red_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 (I think I mistaken here in my previous plan, red_block_1 should be on top of green_block_1 before orange_block_2 is picked up).
15. Stack orange_block_2 on the table.
16. Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_1.
17. Pick up red_block_1.
18. Stack red_block_1 on orange_block_2 (to ensure green_block_1 doesn't go on the table, satisfying constraint 13).
19. Pick up green_block_1, satisfying constraint 9.
20. Stack green_block_1 on red_block_1.
21. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_2.
22. Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_1.
23. Stack green_block_1 on orange_block_2.
24. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_2.
25. Stack black_block_1 on the table.
26. Unstack orange_block_1 from white_block_1.
27. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1, satisfying constraint 10.
28. Pick up orange_block_2.
29. Unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_1.
30. Stack orange_block_1 on the table.
31. Stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1, achieving the goal.

I see a lot of redundant steps in this plan, and I also failed to correctly enforce constraints 8 and 10. Let me take a step back and think about this problem more carefully.

Constraint 8: If "you are holding orange_block_2" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which "red_block_1 is on top of green_block_1" is true.
This means that we need to ensure red_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 before we pick up orange_block_2 at any point in the plan.

Constraint 10: If "you are holding green_block_1" holds in some state s, then "red_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1" OR "orange_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" must hold at s or at some state after s.
This means that after we pick up green_block_1, either red_block_2 should be on top of orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 should be on top of black_block_1 at some point before the end of the plan.

Let me try to plan more carefully:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1. Now red_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraints 2, 12, and 15.
2. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1. Now orange_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint 14 and setting up for constraint 4.
3. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2.
4. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1, satisfying constraint 8.
5. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is clear, and orange_block_1 was clear earlier, so constraint 4 is satisfied.
6. Pick up orange_block_1, satisfying constraint 5.
7. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1, satisfying constraint 6.
8. Pick up orange_block_2, satisfying constraint 7. Constraint 8 is satisfied because red_block_1 is on top of green_block_1.
9. Stack orange_block_2 on the table.
10. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1.
11. Stack red_block_1 on orange_block_2.
12. Pick up green_block_1, satisfying constraint 9.
13. Stack green_block_1 on red_block_1 (to ensure green_block_1 doesn't go on the table, satisfying constraint 13).
14. Unstack orange_block_1 from white_block_1.
15. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1, satisfying constraint 10.
16. Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_1.
17. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_2.
18. Stack red_block_1 on white_block_1.
19. Stack green_block_1 on red_block_1.
20. Pick up orange_block_2.
21. Unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_1.
22. Stack orange_block_1 on the table.
23. Stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1, achieving the goal.

But I realize I might be overcomplicating things. Constraints 8 and 10 only state that certain conditions must be satisfied before or after certain events, but they don't specify that those conditions must remain satisfied. For instance, constraint 8 just requires that red_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 at some point before orange_block_2 is picked up, but red_block_1 doesn't need to remain on top of green_block_1.

So let's try to optimize this plan:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1. Now red_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraints 2, 12, and 15.
2. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1. Now orange_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint 14 and setting up for constraint 4.
3. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2.
4. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1, satisfying constraint 8.
5. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is clear, and orange_block_1 was clear earlier, so constraint 4 is satisfied.
6. Pick up orange_block_1, satisfying constraint 5.
7. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1, satisfying constraint 6.
8. Pick up orange_block_2, satisfying constraint 7. Constraint 8 is satisfied because red_block_1 was on top of green_block_1 earlier.
9. Stack orange_block_2 on red_block_1. This is a temporary move.
10. Unstack orange_block_1 from white_block_1.
11. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1.
12. Unstack orange_block_2 from red_block_1.
13. Pick up green_block_1, satisfying constraint 9. After this, orange_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, satisfying constraint 10.
14. Stack green_block_1 on white_block_1 (to ensure green_block_1 doesn't go on the table, satisfying constraint 13).
15. Stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1, achieving the goal. But I realize this isn't possible because orange_block_1 is already on top of black_block_1. We need to remove orange_block_1 first.

Let me revise the plan one more time:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1. Now red_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraints 2, 12, and 15.
2. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1. Now orange_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint 14 and setting up for constraint 4.
3. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2.
4. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1, satisfying constraint 8.
5. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is clear, and orange_block_1 was clear earlier, so constraint 4 is satisfied.
6. Pick up orange_block_1, satisfying constraint 5.
7. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1, satisfying constraint 6.
8. Pick up orange_block_2, satisfying constraint 7. Constraint 8 is satisfied because red_block_1 was on top of green_block_1 earlier.
9. Stack orange_block_2 on red_block_1. This is a temporary move.
10. Unstack orange_block_1 from white_block_1.
11. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1.
12. Pick up green_block_1, satisfying constraint 9. After this, orange_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, satisfying constraint 10.
13. Stack green_block_1 on white_block_1 (to ensure green_block_1 doesn't go on the table, satisfying constraint 13).
14. Unstack orange_block_2 from red_block_1.
15. Stack orange_block_2 on the table.
16. Unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_1.
17. Stack orange_block_1 on the table.
18. Pick up orange_block_2.
19. Stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1, achieving the goal.

But the plan is still rather long. Let me try to optimize it further, ensuring I'm not missing a more efficient approach.

Let's look at the goal again: orange_block_2 is on top of black_block_1.

And the key constraints:
- orange_block_1 should be clear before white_block_1 becomes clear.
- Before holding orange_block_2, red_block_1 should be on top of green_block_1.
- After holding green_block_1, either red_block_2 should be on top of orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 should be on top of black_block_1.
- orange_block_1 should be on top of white_block_1 at some point.
- green_block_1 should never be on the table.

Let's try one more time:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1. This satisfies constraints 2, 12, and 15.
2. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1. This makes orange_block_1 clear, satisfying constraint 14.
3. Stack black_block_1 on orange_block_1. This is a temporary move.
4. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2.
5. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1, satisfying constraint 8.
6. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1. This makes white_block_1 clear, but orange_block_1 was clear earlier, satisfying constraint 4.
7. Unstack black_block_1 from orange_block_1.
8. Stack black_block_1 on the table.
9. Pick up orange_block_1, satisfying constraint 5.
10. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1, satisfying constraint 6.
11. Pick up orange_block_2, satisfying constraint 7. Constraint 8 is satisfied because red_block_1 was on top of green_block_1 earlier.
12. Stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1. This achieves the goal, but I need to ensure all constraints are satisfied.
13. Pick up green_block_1, satisfying constraint 9.
14. Stack green_block_1 on red_block_2 (to ensure green_block_1 doesn't go on the table, satisfying constraint 13).
15. Unstack orange_block_1 from white_block_1.
16. Stack orange_block_1 on red_block_1, satisfying constraint 10.

But I realize that to satisfy constraint 10, I need to ensure that after picking up green_block_1, either red_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 is on top of black_block_1. In the plan above, at step 13, orange_block_1 is on white_block_1, not on black_block_1. And red_block_2 is not on top of orange_block_1 either. So I need to adjust.

Let's try again:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1. This satisfies constraints 2, 12, and 15.
2. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1. This makes orange_block_1 clear, satisfying constraint 14.
3. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2.
4. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1, satisfying constraint 8.
5. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1. This makes white_block_1 clear, but orange_block_1 was clear earlier, satisfying constraint 4.
6. Pick up orange_block_1, satisfying constraint 5.
7. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1, satisfying constraint 6.
8. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1.
9. Stack red_block_1 on orange_block_1.
10. Pick up green_block_1, satisfying constraint 9.
11. Stack green_block_1 on red_block_2 (to ensure green_block_1 doesn't go on the table, satisfying constraint 13).
12. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1.
13. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1.
14. Unstack orange_block_1 from white_block_1.
15. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1, satisfying constraint 10.
16. Pick up orange_block_2, satisfying constraint 7. Constraint 8 is satisfied because red_block_1 was on top of green_block_1 earlier.
17. Unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_1.
18. Stack orange_block_1 on the table.
19. Stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1, achieving the goal.

This plan is still quite long, but I believe it correctly satisfies all the constraints.

However, there's a concern that I might be misinterpreting constraint 10: "If "you are holding green_block_1" holds in some state s, then "red_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1" OR "orange_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" must hold at s or at some state after s."

The way I've been interpreting this is that after picking up green_block_1, at some later point, either red_block_2 should be on top of orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 should be on top of black_block_1. But perhaps the constraint means that immediately after holding green_block_1, one of those conditions should be true. If that's the case, I'd need to adjust the plan.

Actually given the wording of the constraint, I think my original interpretation is correct. "at s or at some state after s" indicates that it could be a later state, not immediately after.

Alright, I believe the following plan works:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1. This satisfies constraints 2, 12, and 15.
2. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1. This makes orange_block_1 clear, satisfying constraint 14.
3. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2.
4. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1, satisfying constraint 8.
5. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1. This makes white_block_1 clear, but orange_block_1 was clear earlier, satisfying constraint 4.
6. Pick up orange_block_1, satisfying constraint 5.
7. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1, satisfying constraint 6.
8. Pick up orange_block_2, satisfying constraint 7. Constraint 8 is satisfied because red_block_1 was on top of green_block_1 earlier.
9. Stack orange_block_2 on the table.
10. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1.
11. Stack red_block_1 on the table.
12. Pick up green_block_1, satisfying constraint 9.
13. Stack green_block_1 on red_block_1 (to ensure green_block_1 doesn't go on the table, satisfying constraint 13).
14. Unstack orange_block_1 from white_block_1.
15. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1, satisfying constraint 10.
16. Pick up orange_block_2.
17. Unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_1.
18. Stack orange_block_1 on the table.
19. Stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1, achieving the goal.

Actually, I think the plan is still redundantly long. Let me simplify it:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1. This satisfies constraints 2, 12, and 15 by making red_block_1 clear.
2. Stack black_block_1 on the table.
3. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1. This makes orange_block_1 clear, satisfying constraint 14.
4. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2.
5. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1, satisfying constraint 8 (which states that before picking up orange_block_2, red_block_1 should be on top of green_block_1).
6. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1. This makes white_block_1 clear, and orange_block_1 was clear earlier, satisfying constraint 4.
7. Pick up orange_block_1, satisfying constraint 5.
8. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1, satisfying constraint 6.
9. Pick up orange_block_2, satisfying constraint 7. Constraint 8 is satisfied because red_block_1 was on top of green_block_1 earlier.
10. Stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1, achieving the goal.
11. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1.
12. Pick up green_block_1, satisfying constraint 9.
13. Stack green_block_1 on red_block_2 (to ensure green_block_1 doesn't go on the table, satisfying constraint 13).
14. Unstack orange_block_1 from white_block_1.
15. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1, satisfying constraint 10 (which states that after picking up green_block_1, either red_block_2 should be on top of orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 should be on top of black_block_1).

Wait, I realize there's a mistake. In step 10, I tried to stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1, but that's the goal. I'm trying to work through the constraints first.

Let me try one more time:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1. This satisfies constraints 2, 12, and 15 by making red_block_1 clear.
2. Stack black_block_1 on the table.
3. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1. This makes orange_block_1 clear, satisfying constraint 14.
4. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2.
5. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1, satisfying constraint 8 (which states that before picking up orange_block_2, red_block_1 should be on top of green_block_1).
6. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1. This makes white_block_1 clear, and orange_block_1 was clear earlier, satisfying constraint 4.
7. Pick up orange_block_1, satisfying constraint 5.
8. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1, satisfying constraint 6.
9. Pick up orange_block_2, satisfying constraint 7. Constraint 8 is satisfied because red_block_1 was on top of green_block_1 earlier.
10. Stack orange_block_2 on the table.
11. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1.
12. Pick up green_block_1, satisfying constraint 9.
13. Stack green_block_1 on red_block_2 (to ensure green_block_1 doesn't go on the table, satisfying constraint 13).
14. Unstack orange_block_1 from white_block_1.
15. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1, satisfying constraint 10 (which states that after picking up green_block_1, either red_block_2 should be on top of orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 should be on top of black_block_1).
16. Pick up orange_block_2.
17. Unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_1.
18. Stack orange_block_1 on the table.
19. Stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1, achieving the goal.

Let me see if there's room for further simplification:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1.
2. Stack black_block_1 on the table.
3. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2.
5. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1.
6. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1.
7. Pick up orange_block_1.
8. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1.
9. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1.
10. Pick up green_block_1.
11. Stack green_block_1 on red_block_2.
12. Pick up orange_block_2.
13. Unstack orange_block_1 from white_block_1.
14. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1.
15. Stack orange_block_2 on the table.
16. Unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_1.
17. Stack orange_block_1 on the table.
18. Pick up orange_block_2.
19. Stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1.

But I realize that I'm not correctly enforcing constraint 8. Let's go back to it: "If "you are holding orange_block_2" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which "red_block_1 is on top of green_block_1" is true."

This means that red_block_1 should be on top of green_block_1 at some point before orange_block_2 is picked up. But in the steps 12 and 18, orange_block_2 is picked up, but red_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1 at any point before step 12. I need to ensure this happens.

Let me revise the plan once more:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1.
2. Stack black_block_1 on the table.
3. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2.
5. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1, satisfying constraint 8 (before picking up orange_block_2, red_block_1 is on top of green_block_1).
6. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1.
7. Pick up orange_block_1.
8. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1.
9. Pick up orange_block_2, satisfying constraint 7. Constraint 8 is satisfied because red_block_1 was on top of green_block_1 earlier.
10. Stack orange_block_2 on the table.
11. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1.
12. Pick up green_block_1.
13. Stack green_block_1 on red_block_2.
14. Unstack orange_block_1 from white_block_1.
15. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1, satisfying constraint 10 (after picking up green_block_1, orange_block_1 is on top of black_block_1).
16. Pick up orange_block_2.
17. Unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_1.
18. Stack orange_block_1 on red_block_1.
19. Stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1, achieving the goal.

I think this is correct. Double-checking all the constraints:

1. "black_block_1 is not on the table" is satisfied in the initial state.
2. "red_block_1 is clear" is true after step 1, which is after "black_block_1 is not on the table" is true.
3. "white_block_1 is clear" is true after step 6.
4. "orange_block_1 is clear" is true after step 3, which is before "white_block_1 is clear".
5. "you are holding orange_block_1" is true at step 7.
6. "orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" is true after step 8.
7. "you are holding orange_block_2" is true at steps 9 and 16.
8. "red_block_1 is on top of green_block_1" is true after step 5, which is before "you are holding orange_block_2" at step 9.
9. "you are holding green_block_1" is true at step 12.
10. "orange_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" is true after step 15, which is after "you are holding green_block_1" at step 12.
11. "black_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is always true.
12. "red_block_1 is clear" is true after step 1, which is after "black_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1".
13. "green_block_1 is not on the table" is always true. Initially, it's on orange_block_2. Later, it's stacked on red_block_2.
14. "orange_block_1 is clear" is true after step 3.
15. "you are holding orange_block_1" OR "red_block_1 is clear" is satisfied by the satisfaction of constraints 5 and 2.

So all constraints are satisfied. And the goal "orange_block_2 is on top of black_block_1" is achieved in step 19.

Let me double-check for any unnecessary steps.

Steps 17 and 18 are necessary because we need to remove orange_block_1 from black_block_1 before stacking orange_block_2 on black_block_1. The other steps all seem necessary to satisfy the constraints.

Here's the final optimized plan:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1.
2. Stack black_block_1 on the table.
3. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2.
5. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1.
6. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1.
7. Pick up orange_block_1.
8. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1.
9. Pick up orange_block_2.
10. Stack orange_block_2 on the table.
11. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1.
12. Pick up green_block_1.
13. Stack green_block_1 on red_block_2.
14. Unstack orange_block_1 from white_block_1.
15. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1.
16. Pick up orange_block_2.
17. Unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_1.
18. Stack orange_block_1 on red_block_1.
19. Stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1.

But, let me double-check if there are still any redundant steps and if we can't reduce the actions required for the problem.

After reviewing, I believe steps 7-8 and steps 14-15 can be optimized. We can replace them with:

7. Pick up orange_block_1.
8. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1.
...
14. Pick up orange_block_1.
15. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1.

This simplifies the plan to:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1.
2. Stack black_block_1 on the table.
3. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2.
5. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1.
6. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1.
7. Pick up orange_block_1.
8. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1.
9. Pick up orange_block_2.
10. Stack orange_block_2 on the table.
11. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1.
12. Pick up green_block_1.
13. Stack green_block_1 on red_block_2.
14. Pick up orange_block_1.
15. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1.
16. Pick up orange_block_2.
17. Unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_1.
18. Stack orange_block_1 on red_block_1.
19. Stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1.

Hmm, I realized I made an error. Steps 14-15 should be "Unstack orange_block_1 from white_block_1" and "Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1", not "Pick up orange_block_1" and "Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1". So my original steps were correct.

So the optimal plan is:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1.
2. Stack black_block_1 on the table.
3. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1.

Let me verifying if any other constraints might be redundant or if there are shorter paths. But having gone through this problem carefully, I think the given plan is optimal. It achieves the goal while satisfying all the constraints and minimizes the number of steps.

Actually, I'm not convinced that step 10 is needed. Let's see if skipping it affects the correctness of the plan:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1.
2. Stack black_block_1 on the table.
3. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2.
5. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1.
6. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1.
7. Pick up orange_block_1.
8. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1.
9. Pick up orange_block_2.
10. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1.
11. Pick up green_block_1.
12. Stack green_block_1 on red_block_2.
13. Unstack orange_block_1 from white_block_1.
14. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1.
15. Unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_1.
16. Stack orange_block_1 on red_block_1.
17. Stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1.

But this doesn't make sense because we can't execute step 10 after step 9 since we're already holding orange_block_2 after step 9. So, we need step 10 to place orange_block_2 somewhere so we can perform the subsequent steps. Alternatively, we can reorganize the plan a bit, making it slightly more efficient:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1.
2. Stack black_block_1 on the table.
3. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2.
5. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1. This is to ensure constraint 8 is satisfied.
6. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1.
7. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1.
8. Pick up green_block_1.
9. Stack green_block_1 on red_block_2. This ensures constraint 13 (green_block_1 never goes on the table).
10. Pick up orange_block_1.
11. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1. This is to satisfy constraint 10 after picking up green_block_1.
12. Pick up orange_block_2.
13. Unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_1.
14. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1. This satisfies constraint 6.
15. Stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1. This achieves the goal.

I've rearranged the order of steps, and this plan satisfies all the constraints. I also noticed that this way, we're placing orange_block_1 on white_block_1 at a different stage, but it still satisfies constraint 6. The advantage of doing it this way is that we minimize the number of times we need to move orange_block_1.

But there's an issue: we haven't satisfied constraint 5, which requires me to hold orange_block_1 at some point. Let me correct this plan:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1.
2. Stack black_block_1 on the table.
3. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Pick up orange_block_1. This satisfies constraint 5. It also means orange_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint 14.
5. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1. This satisfies constraint 6.
6. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2.
7. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1. This is to ensure constraint 8 is satisfied.
8. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1.
9. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1.
10. Pick up green_block_1.
11. Stack green_block_1 on red_block_2. This ensures constraint 13 (green_block_1 never goes on the table).
12. Pick up orange_block_1. This is a duplicate of step 4 and doesn't add value. But we still need to unstack orange_block_1 from white_block_1.
...

Ok actually, after thinking about it. Let's go back to the original plan, perhaps I missed some small optimizations but given the complexity of the problem, I think it's close to optimal.

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1.
2. Stack black_block_1 on the table.
3. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2.
5. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1.
6. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1.
7. Pick up orange_block_1.
8. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1.
9. Pick up orange_block_2.
10. Stack orange_block_2 on the table.
11. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1.
12. Pick up green_block_1.
13. Stack green_block_1 on red_block_2.
14. Unstack orange_block_1 from white_block_1.
15. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1.
16. Pick up orange_block_2.
17. Unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_1.
18. Stack orange_block_1 on red_block_1.
19. Stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1.

This is the final plan that satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal. It might not be the absolute optimal, there might exist be a plan that's shorter, but I believe it's close to optimal.

The plan is:

1. unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1
2. stack black_block_1 on the table
3. unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1
4. unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2
5. stack red_block_1 on green_block_1
6. unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1
7. pickup orange_block_1
8. stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1
9. pickup orange_block_2
10. stack orange_block_2 on the table
11. unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1
12. pickup green_block_1
13. stack green_block_1 on red_block_2
14. unstack orange_block_1 from white_block_1
15. stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1
16. pickup orange_block_2
17. unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_1
18. stack orange_block_1 on red_block_1
19. stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1
