Let's analyze the problem:

We have a Blocksworld scenario with multiple blocks, and our goal is to be holding white_block_1.

The initial state is:
- blue_block_1 is on the table and clear
- black_block_1 is on the table with blue_block_3 on top of it
- blue_block_2 is on the table with white_block_2 on top of it
- blue_block_3 is on top of black_block_1 and is clear
- white_block_1 is on the table and clear
- white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_2 and is clear
- brown_block_1 is on the table and clear
- The robot arm is not holding any block

The goal state is:
- The robot arm is holding white_block_1

To achieve this goal, we need to perform the "pickup" action on white_block_1. The preconditions for this action are:
1. white_block_1 is clear (which it is)
2. white_block_1 is on the table (which it is)
3. The robot arm is not holding any block (which is true)

So, we can directly pick up white_block_1:

```
pickup white_block_1
```

That's it! This is the optimal plan for the given problem.
