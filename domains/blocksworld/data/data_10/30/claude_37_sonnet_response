Let's analyze this problem step by step. 

First, I'll understand the initial state:
- blue_block_1 is on the table and clear
- black_block_1 is on the table with blue_block_3 on top of it
- blue_block_2 is on the table with white_block_2 on top of it
- blue_block_3 is on top of black_block_1 and is clear
- white_block_1 is on the table and clear
- white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_2 and is clear
- brown_block_1 is on the table and clear
- The arm is not holding any block

The goal is: "you are holding white_block_1"

Now, let's go through the constraints:

1. white_block_1 must not be on the table at some point
2. If white_block_1 is not on the table, then at the same time or after, either blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2 OR blue_block_3 is on the table
3. At some point, white_block_1 must have a block on top of it
4. If white_block_1 has a block on top of it, then earlier you must have been holding white_block_2
5. At some point, blue_block_3 must be on top of white_block_2
6. At some point, either white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_3 OR blue_block_2 is clear
7. At some point, either brown_block_1 is not on the table OR blue_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1
8. At some point, brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2
9. If brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2, then at the same time or after, brown_block_1 must have a block on top of it
10. At some point, either brown_block_1 has a block on top of it OR brown_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
11. At some point, blue_block_3 is not on top of white_block_1
12. If blue_block_3 is not on top of white_block_1, then at the same time or after, either blue_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 OR blue_block_2 is not on the table
13. At some point, either white_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 OR blue_block_2 is not on the table
14. At some point, blue_block_2 is not on top of white_block_2
15. If blue_block_2 is not on top of white_block_2, then at the same time or after, you must be holding blue_block_2

Let me think about satisfying these constraints while achieving the goal.

To achieve the goal, I need to pick up white_block_1 from the table. But to satisfy constraint 3, I need to first have a block on top of white_block_1. And according to constraint 4, before that, I need to be holding white_block_2.

So, first I need to:
1. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2
2. Stack white_block_2 on something else or put it on the table
3. Eventually stack some block on white_block_1
4. Then unstack that block
5. Finally, pickup white_block_1

Let's think about more constraints. 

Constraint 5 requires blue_block_3 to be on white_block_2 at some point. Currently, blue_block_3 is on black_block_1, so I'll need to unstack blue_block_3 and stack it on white_block_2.

Constraint 7 requires either brown_block_1 to be not on the table OR blue_block_3 to be on brown_block_1. Since blue_block_3 needs to be on white_block_2 (constraint 5), I'll choose to pick up brown_block_1 and stack it somewhere.

Constraint 9 says that if brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2 (which is already true in the initial state), then it must have a block on top of it at some point.

Constraint 10 requires either brown_block_1 to have a block on top of it OR brown_block_1 to be on top of white_block_1. Since constraint 3 requires white_block_1 to have a block on top of it, and constraint 4 suggests this happens after we hold white_block_2, we could satisfy constraint 10 by stacking brown_block_1 on white_block_1.

Alright, let's plan out our sequence of actions:

1. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2
2. Stack white_block_2 on the table or somewhere appropriate
3. Unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1
4. Stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2 (satisfying constraint 5)
5. Pick up brown_block_1 from the table (satisfying constraint 7)
6. Stack brown_block_1 on white_block_1 (satisfying constraints 3 and 10)
7. Unstack brown_block_1 from white_block_1
8. Stack brown_block_1 somewhere else
9. Pick up white_block_1 from the table (achieving the goal)

Let's check if this plan satisfies all constraints:

1. ✅ white_block_1 must not be on the table at some point: Satisfied when we pick it up in step 9.
2. ✅ If white_block_1 is not on the table, then blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2 OR blue_block_3 is on the table: In step 9, white_block_1 is not on the table, and blue_block_3 is on white_block_2 from step 4.
3. ✅ At some point, white_block_1 must have a block on top of it: Satisfied in step 6 when brown_block_1 is on white_block_1.
4. ✅ If white_block_1 has a block on top of it, then earlier you must have been holding white_block_2: This will be satisfied because we hold white_block_2 in step 1, before brown_block_1 is on white_block_1 in step 6.
5. ✅ At some point, blue_block_3 must be on top of white_block_2: Satisfied in step 4.
6. ✅ At some point, either white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_3 OR blue_block_2 is clear: blue_block_2 becomes clear after we unstack white_block_2 in step 1.
7. ✅ At some point, either brown_block_1 is not on the table OR blue_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1: Satisfied in step 5 when brown_block_1 is picked up.
8. ✅ At some point, brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2: Already satisfied in the initial state.
9. ✅ If brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2, then at the same time or after, brown_block_1 must have a block on top of it: We need to ensure this.
10. ✅ At some point, either brown_block_1 has a block on top of it OR brown_block_1 is on top of white_block_1: Satisfied in step 6.
11. ✅ At some point, blue_block_3 is not on top of white_block_1: Already satisfied in the initial state.
12. ✅ If blue_block_3 is not on top of white_block_1, then at the same time or after, either blue_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 OR blue_block_2 is not on the table: We need to ensure this.
13. ✅ At some point, either white_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 OR blue_block_2 is not on the table: We need to pick up blue_block_2 at some point or stack white_block_2 on black_block_1.
14. ✅ At some point, blue_block_2 is not on top of white_block_2: Already satisfied in the initial state (white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_2, not the other way around).
15. ✅ If blue_block_2 is not on top of white_block_2, then at the same time or after, you must be holding blue_block_2: We need to pick up blue_block_2 at some point.

I notice that I still need to ensure a few constraints, specifically 9, 12, 13, and 15. Let's adjust our plan:

1. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2 (satisfying constraint 6 - blue_block_2 is clear)
2. Stack white_block_2 on black_block_1 (satisfying constraint 13)
3. Pickup blue_block_2 from the table (satisfying constraint 15)
4. Putdown blue_block_2 on the table (satisfying constraint 12 - blue_block_2 is not on the table)
5. Unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1
6. Stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2 (satisfying constraint 5)
7. Pickup blue_block_1 from the table
8. Stack blue_block_1 on brown_block_1 (satisfying constraint 9 - brown_block_1 has a block on top of it)
9. Pickup white_block_1 from the table
10. Putdown white_block_1 on the table (to ensure the constraint is satisfied before we achieve the goal)
11. Pickup brown_block_1 from the table (satisfying constraint 7)
12. Stack brown_block_1 on white_block_1 (satisfying constraints 3 and 10)
13. Unstack brown_block_1 from white_block_1
14. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table
15. Pickup white_block_1 from the table (achieving the goal)

However, upon further reflection, I've realized that after we stack brown_block_1 on white_block_1, we need to pick brown_block_1 up again before we can pick up white_block_1. This means that brown_block_1 won't have a block on top of it when we achieve our goal. Let's adjust our plan once more:

1. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2 (satisfying constraint 6 - blue_block_2 is clear)
2. Stack white_block_2 on black_block_1 (satisfying constraint 13)
3. Pickup blue_block_2 from the table (satisfying constraint 15)
4. Putdown blue_block_2 on the table
5. Unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1
6. Stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2 (satisfying constraint 5)
7. Pickup brown_block_1 from the table (satisfying constraint 7)
8. Stack brown_block_1 on white_block_1 (satisfying constraints 3 and 10)
9. Unstack brown_block_1 from white_block_1
10. Stack brown_block_1 on blue_block_1
11. Pickup white_block_1 from the table (achieving the goal)

This ensures that constraint 9 is satisfied because after we pick up brown_block_1, we stack it on white_block_1, and after we unstack it, we stack it on blue_block_1.

Let's double-check if this new plan satisfies all constraints:

1. ✅ white_block_1 must not be on the table at some point: Satisfied when we pick it up in step 11.
2. ✅ If white_block_1 is not on the table, then blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2 OR blue_block_3 is on the table: In step 11, white_block_1 is not on the table, and blue_block_3 is on white_block_2 from step 6.
3. ✅ At some point, white_block_1 must have a block on top of it: Satisfied in step 8 when brown_block_1 is on white_block_1.
4. ✅ If white_block_1 has a block on top of it, then earlier you must have been holding white_block_2: This will be satisfied because we hold white_block_2 in step 1, before brown_block_1 is on white_block_1 in step 8.
5. ✅ At some point, blue_block_3 must be on top of white_block_2: Satisfied in step 6.
6. ✅ At some point, either white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_3 OR blue_block_2 is clear: blue_block_2 becomes clear after we unstack white_block_2 in step 1.
7. ✅ At some point, either brown_block_1 is not on the table OR blue_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1: Satisfied in step 7 when brown_block_1 is picked up.
8. ✅ At some point, brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2: Already satisfied in the initial state.
9. ✅ If brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2, then at the same time or after, brown_block_1 must have a block on top of it: We stack brown_block_1 on blue_block_1 in step 10, but no block is on top of brown_block_1. This constraint is not satisfied.
10. ✅ At some point, either brown_block_1 has a block on top of it OR brown_block_1 is on top of white_block_1: Satisfied in step 8.
11. ✅ At some point, blue_block_3 is not on top of white_block_1: Already satisfied in the initial state.
12. ✅ If blue_block_3 is not on top of white_block_1, then at the same time or after, either blue_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 OR blue_block_2 is not on the table: Satisfied in step 3.
13. ✅ At some point, either white_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 OR blue_block_2 is not on the table: Satisfied in steps 2 and 3.
14. ✅ At some point, blue_block_2 is not on top of white_block_2: Already satisfied in the initial state.
15. ✅ If blue_block_2 is not on top of white_block_2, then at the same time or after, you must be holding blue_block_2: Satisfied in step 3.

I still need to satisfy constraint 9: "If brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2, then at the same time or after, brown_block_1 must have a block on top of it."

Since brown_block_1 is initially not on top of blue_block_2, this constraint requires that at some point, we have a block on top of brown_block_1. Let's adjust our plan one more time:

1. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2 (satisfying constraint 6 - blue_block_2 is clear)
2. Stack white_block_2 on black_block_1 (satisfying constraint 13)
3. Pickup blue_block_2 from the table (satisfying constraint 15)
4. Stack blue_block_2 on blue_block_1
5. Unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1
6. Stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2 (satisfying constraint 5)
7. Pickup blue_block_2 from blue_block_1
8. Stack blue_block_2 on brown_block_1 (satisfying constraint 9 - brown_block_1 has a block on top of it)
9. Unstack blue_block_2 from brown_block_1
10. Putdown blue_block_2 on the table
11. Pickup brown_block_1 from the table (satisfying constraint 7)
12. Stack brown_block_1 on white_block_1 (satisfying constraints 3 and 10)
13. Unstack brown_block_1 from white_block_1
14. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table
15. Pickup white_block_1 from the table (achieving the goal)

Let's double-check if this new plan satisfies constraint 9:

9. ✅ If brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2, then at the same time or after, brown_block_1 must have a block on top of it: Satisfied in step 8 when blue_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1.

All constraints are now satisfied, and we achieve the goal at the end.

Actually, I just realized there's a potential problem. If we stack blue_block_2 on brown_block_1, then brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2, which is fine initially. But after we unstack blue_block_2 from brown_block_1, brown_block_1 still isn't on top of blue_block_2, but now there's no block on top of brown_block_1 either. 

I need to re-read constraint 9:

"If brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2, then at the same time or after, brown_block_1 must have a block on top of it"

It means that if brown_block_1 isn't on blue_block_2, then at that same time or after, there should be a block on top of brown_block_1. This holds for all states where brown_block_1 is not on blue_block_2, which includes the initial state and all states in our plan. So we need to ensure that in the final state, either brown_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2 or there's a block on top of brown_block_1.

Let's adjust our plan one more time:

1. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2 (satisfying constraint 6 - blue_block_2 is clear)
2. Stack white_block_2 on black_block_1 (satisfying constraint 13)
3. Pickup blue_block_2 from the table (satisfying constraint 15)
4. Stack blue_block_2 on brown_block_1 (satisfying constraint 9 - brown_block_1 has a block on top of it)
5. Unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1
6. Stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2 (satisfying constraint 5)
7. Pickup blue_block_1 from the table
8. Stack blue_block_1 on white_block_1 (satisfying constraints 3 and 10)
9. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1
10. Putdown blue_block_1 on the table
11. Pickup white_block_1 from the table (achieving the goal)

In this plan, blue_block_2 remains on top of brown_block_1 throughout the execution (from step 4 onwards), ensuring that constraint 9 is satisfied.

Let's check if all other constraints are satisfied:

1. ✅ white_block_1 must not be on the table at some point: Satisfied when we pick it up in step 11.
2. ✅ If white_block_1 is not on the table, then blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2 OR blue_block_3 is on the table: In step 11, white_block_1 is not on the table, and blue_block_3 is on white_block_2 from step 6.
3. ✅ At some point, white_block_1 must have a block on top of it: Satisfied in step 8 when blue_block_1 is on white_block_1.
4. ✅ If white_block_1 has a block on top of it, then earlier you must have been holding white_block_2: This will be satisfied because we hold white_block_2 in step 1, before blue_block_1 is on white_block_1 in step 8.
5. ✅ At some point, blue_block_3 must be on top of white_block_2: Satisfied in step 6.
6. ✅ At some point, either white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_3 OR blue_block_2 is clear: blue_block_2 becomes clear after we unstack white_block_2 in step 1.
7. ❌ At some point, either brown_block_1 is not on the table OR blue_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1: Not satisfied, as brown_block_1 remains on the table, and blue_block_3 is on white_block_2, not brown_block_1.
8. ✅ At some point, brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2: Already satisfied in the initial state.
9. ✅ If brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2, then at the same time or after, brown_block_1 must have a block on top of it: Satisfied in step 4 when blue_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1.
10. ✅ At some point, either brown_block_1 has a block on top of it OR brown_block_1 is on top of white_block_1: Satisfied in step 4.
11. ✅ At some point, blue_block_3 is not on top of white_block_1: Already satisfied in the initial state.
12. ✅ If blue_block_3 is not on top of white_block_1, then at the same time or after, either blue_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 OR blue_block_2 is not on the table: Satisfied in step 3 when blue_block_2 is not on the table.
13. ✅ At some point, either white_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 OR blue_block_2 is not on the table: Satisfied in steps 2 and 3.
14. ✅ At some point, blue_block_2 is not on top of white_block_2: Already satisfied in the initial state.
15. ✅ If blue_block_2 is not on top of white_block_2, then at the same time or after, you must be holding blue_block_2: Satisfied in step 3.

I need to address constraint 7. Let me adjust the plan:

1. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2 (satisfying constraint 6 - blue_block_2 is clear)
2. Stack white_block_2 on black_block_1 (satisfying constraint 13)
3. Pickup blue_block_2 from the table (satisfying constraint 15)
4. Stack blue_block_2 on brown_block_1 (satisfying constraint 9 - brown_block_1 has a block on top of it)
5. Unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1
6. Stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2 (satisfying constraint 5)
7. Unstack blue_block_2 from brown_block_1
8. Stack blue_block_2 on blue_block_1
9. Pickup brown_block_1 from the table (satisfying constraint 7)
10. Stack brown_block_1 on white_block_1 (satisfying constraints 3 and 10)
11. Unstack brown_block_1 from white_block_1
12. Stack brown_block_1 on blue_block_2 (ensuring constraint 9 is satisfied)
13. Pickup white_block_1 from the table (achieving the goal)

Let's check all constraints:

1. ✅ white_block_1 must not be on the table at some point: Satisfied when we pick it up in step 13.
2. ✅ If white_block_1 is not on the table, then blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2 OR blue_block_3 is on the table: In step 13, white_block_1 is not on the table, and blue_block_3 is on white_block_2 from step 6.
3. ✅ At some point, white_block_1 must have a block on top of it: Satisfied in step 10 when brown_block_1 is on white_block_1.
4. ✅ If white_block_1 has a block on top of it, then earlier you must have been holding white_block_2: This will be satisfied because we hold white_block_2 in step 1, before brown_block_1 is on white_block_1 in step 10.
5. ✅ At some point, blue_block_3 must be on top of white_block_2: Satisfied in step 6.
6. ✅ At some point, either white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_3 OR blue_block_2 is clear: blue_block_2 becomes clear after we unstack white_block_2 in step 1.
7. ✅ At some point, either brown_block_1 is not on the table OR blue_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1: Satisfied in step 9 when brown_block_1 is picked up.
8. ✅ At some point, brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2: Already satisfied in the initial state.
9. ✅ If brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2, then at the same time or after, brown_block_1 must have a block on top of it: Satisfied in step 4 when blue_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1.
10. ✅ At some point, either brown_block_1 has a block on top of it OR brown_block_1 is on top of white_block_1: Satisfied in steps 4 and 10.
11. ✅ At some point, blue_block_3 is not on top of white_block_1: Already satisfied in the initial state.
12. ✅ If blue_block_3 is not on top of white_block_1, then at the same time or after, either blue_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 OR blue_block_2 is not on the table: Satisfied in step 3 when blue_block_2 is not on the table.
13. ✅ At some point, either white_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 OR blue_block_2 is not on the table: Satisfied in steps 2 and 3.
14. ✅ At some point, blue_block_2 is not on top of white_block_2: Already satisfied in the initial state.
15. ✅ If blue_block_2 is not on top of white_block_2, then at the same time or after, you must be holding blue_block_2: Satisfied in step 3.

Wait, I realized I misunderstood constraint 9. Let me re-read it:

"If brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2, then at the same time or after, brown_block_1 must have a block on top of it"

I thought it meant that if brown_block_1 isn't on blue_block_2, then there should be a block on top of brown_block_1. But actually, it means that if brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2, then at that same time or later, brown_block_1 must have a block on top of it.

In the initial state, brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2. So, according to this constraint, at some point, there needs to be a block on top of brown_block_1. This is already satisfied in our plan in step 4 when blue_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1.

However, there's another issue. After we unstack blue_block_2 from brown_block_1 in step 7, brown_block_1 is still not on top of blue_block_2, but now there's no block on top of it either. This might violate the constraint.

Actually, let me re-interpret the constraint. It says "at the same time or after", which means that if at some point brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2, then at that point or at some later point, brown_block_1 must have a block on top of it. It doesn't necessarily mean brown_block_1 must always have a block on top of it.

So, even though we unstack blue_block_2 from brown_block_1 in step 7, we've still satisfied the constraint because there was a time (step 4) when brown_block_1 had a block on top of it, which was after the time when brown_block_1 was not on top of blue_block_2 (the initial state).

Now let's make sure that constraint 9 remains satisfied in the final state.

In step 12, we stack brown_block_1 on blue_block_2. This means brown_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2, so the premise of constraint 9 is false (as it says "If brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2"). When the premise of an "if-then" statement is false, the entire statement is true regardless of the consequent. So, constraint 9 is satisfied in the final state.

But, reading constraint 9 again: "If brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2, then at the same time or after, brown_block_1 must have a block on top of it", it doesn't say that brown_block_1 must be on top of blue_block_2, it says that if it's not, then there should be a block on top of it.

Maybe to be safer, let's modify our plan to have a block on top of brown_block_1 at the end, just to be sure:

1. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2 (satisfying constraint 6 - blue_block_2 is clear)
2. Stack white_block_2 on black_block_1 (satisfying constraint 13)
3. Pickup blue_block_2 from the table (satisfying constraint 15)
4. Stack blue_block_2 on brown_block_1 (satisfying constraint 9 - brown_block_1 has a block on top of it)
5. Unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1
6. Stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2 (satisfying constraint 5)
7. Unstack blue_block_2 from brown_block_1
8. Putdown blue_block_2 on the table
9. Pickup blue_block_1 from the table
10. Stack blue_block_1 on brown_block_1 (ensuring constraint 9 is satisfied throughout)
11. Pickup white_block_1 from the table (achieving the goal)

Let's check all constraints one more time:

1. ✅ white_block_1 must not be on the table at some point: Satisfied when we pick it up in step 11.
2. ✅ If white_block_1 is not on the table, then blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2 OR blue_block_3 is on the table: In step 11, white_block_1 is not on the table, and blue_block_3 is on white_block_2 from step 6.
3. ❌ At some point, white_block_1 must have a block on top of it: Not satisfied in this plan.
4. ❌ If white_block_1 has a block on top of it, then earlier you must have been holding white_block_2: Not applicable, as white_block_1 never has a block on top of it in this plan.
7. ❌ At some point, either brown_block_1 is not on the table OR blue_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1: Not satisfied in this plan, as brown_block_1 stays on the table and blue_block_3 is on white_block_2, not brown_block_1.
10. ❌ At some point, either brown_block_1 has a block on top of it OR brown_block_1 is on top of white_block_1: Satisfied in step 10, but not fully as brown_block_1 is never on top of white_block_1.

I made a mistake by forgetting some constraints. Let's create a new plan:

1. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2 (satisfying constraint 6 - blue_block_2 is clear)
2. Stack white_block_2 on black_block_1 (satisfying constraint 13)
3. Pickup blue_block_2 from the table (satisfying constraint 15)
4. Stack blue_block_2 on blue_block_1
5. Unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1
6. Stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2 (satisfying constraint 5)
7. Pickup brown_block_1 from the table (satisfying constraint 7)
8. Stack brown_block_1 on white_block_1 (satisfying constraints 3 and 10)
9. Unstack brown_block_1 from white_block_1
10. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table
11. Pickup blue_block_1 from the table
12. Stack blue_block_1 on brown_block_1 (ensuring constraint 9 is satisfied)
13. Pickup white_block_1 from the table (achieving the goal)

This plan should satisfy all constraints. Let's check:

1. ✅ white_block_1 must not be on the table at some point: Satisfied when we pick it up in step 13.
2. ✅ If white_block_1 is not on the table, then blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2 OR blue_block_3 is on the table: In step 13, white_block_1 is not on the table, and blue_block_3 is on white_block_2 from step 6.
3. ✅ At some point, white_block_1 must have a block on top of it: Satisfied in step 8 when brown_block_1 is on white_block_1.
4. ✅ If white_block_1 has a block on top of it, then earlier you must have been holding white_block_2: This is satisfied because we hold white_block_2 in step 1, before brown_block_1 is on white_block_1 in step 8.
5. ✅ At some point, blue_block_3 must be on top of white_block_2: Satisfied in step 6.
6. ✅ At some point, either white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_3 OR blue_block_2 is clear: blue_block_2 becomes clear after we unstack white_block_2 in step 1.
7. ✅ At some point, either brown_block_1 is not on the table OR blue_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1: Satisfied in step 7 when brown_block_1 is picked up.
8. ✅ At some point, brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2: Already satisfied in the initial state.
9. ✅ If brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2, then at the same time or after, brown_block_1 must have a block on top of it: Satisfied in step 12 when blue_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1.
10. ✅ At some point, either brown_block_1 has a block on top of it OR brown_block_1 is on top of white_block_1: Satisfied in steps 8 and 12.
11. ✅ At some point, blue_block_3 is not on top of white_block_1: Already satisfied in the initial state.
12. ✅ If blue_block_3 is not on top of white_block_1, then at the same time or after, either blue_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 OR blue_block_2 is not on the table: Satisfied in step 3 when blue_block_2 is not on the table.
13. ✅ At some point, either white_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 OR blue_block_2 is not on the table: Satisfied in steps 2 and 3.
14. ✅ At some point, blue_block_2 is not on top of white_block_2: Already satisfied in the initial state.
15. ✅ If blue_block_2 is not on top of white_block_2, then at the same time or after, you must be holding blue_block_2: Satisfied in step 3.

Great, all constraints are satisfied with our current plan, and the goal is achieved. Here's the summarized plan:

1. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2
2. Stack white_block_2 on black_block_1
3. Pickup blue_block_2 from the table
4. Stack blue_block_2 on blue_block_1
5. Unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1
6. Stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2
7. Pickup brown_block_1 from the table
8. Stack brown_block_1 on white_block_1
9. Unstack brown_block_1 from white_block_1
10. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table
11. Pickup blue_block_1 from the table
12. Stack blue_block_1 on brown_block_1
13. Pickup white_block_1 from the table

However, I just noticed there's one more problem. Constraint 12 is:

"If blue_block_3 is not on top of white_block_1, then at the same time or after, either blue_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 OR blue_block_2 is not on the table"

In our plan, blue_block_3 is never on top of white_block_1. So, we need to ensure that at some point, either blue_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 OR blue_block_2 is not on the table. We satisfy this in step 3 when blue_block_2 is not on the table.

But the condition "blue_block_3 is not on top of white_block_1" is true throughout our plan, including the final state. In the final state, blue_block_2 is on blue_block_1, not on black_block_1 or off the table, which might violate the constraint.

Let's make one final adjustment:

1. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2
2. Stack white_block_2 on black_block_1
3. Pickup blue_block_2 from the table
4. Stack blue_block_2 on black_block_1 (ensuring constraint 12 is satisfied in the final state)
5. Unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1
6. Stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2
7. Pickup brown_block_1 from the table
8. Stack brown_block_1 on white_block_1
9. Unstack brown_block_1 from white_block_1
10. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table
11. Pickup blue_block_1 from the table
12. Stack blue_block_1 on brown_block_1
13. Pickup white_block_1 from the table

Wait, I realized there's a mistake. We stack blue_block_2 on black_block_1 in step 4, but white_block_2 is already on black_block_1 from step 2. Let's fix this:

1. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2
2. Stack white_block_2 on black_block_1
3. Pickup blue_block_2 from the table
4. Putdown blue_block_2 on the table (ensuring blue_block_2 is not on the table, which satisfies constraint 12)
5. Unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1
6. Stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2
7. Pickup brown_block_1 from the table
8. Stack brown_block_1 on white_block_1
9. Unstack brown_block_1 from white_block_1
10. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table
11. Pickup blue_block_1 from the table
12. Stack blue_block_1 on brown_block_1
13. Pickup white_block_1 from the table

But actually, putting blue_block_2 back on the table doesn't ensure that it's not on the table in the final state. Let's adjust:

1. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2
2. Stack white_block_2 on black_block_1
3. Pickup blue_block_2 from the table
4. Stack blue_block_2 on blue_block_1
5. Unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1
6. Stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2
7. Pickup brown_block_1 from the table
8. Stack brown_block_1 on white_block_1
9. Unstack brown_block_1 from white_block_1
10. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table
11. Pickup blue_block_1 from the table
12. Stack blue_block_1 on brown_block_1
13. Pickup blue_block_2 from blue_block_1 (ensuring blue_block_2 is not on the table in the final state, satisfying constraint 12)
14. Putdown blue_block_2 on the table
15. Pickup white_block_1 from the table

Actually, that's not correct. The constraint doesn't require blue_block_2 to be off the table at the end; it just requires that either blue_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 OR blue_block_2 is not on the table at some point after blue_block_3 is not on top of white_block_1. Since blue_block_3 is not on top of white_block_1 from the beginning, and blue_block_2 is off the table in step 3, constraint 12 is already satisfied.

I was overthinking it. Our original plan is fine:

1. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2
2. Stack white_block_2 on black_block_1
3. Pickup blue_block_2 from the table
4. Stack blue_block_2 on blue_block_1
5. Unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1
6. Stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2
7. Pickup brown_block_1 from the table
8. Stack brown_block_1 on white_block_1
9. Unstack brown_block_1 from white_block_1
10. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table
11. Pickup blue_block_1 from the table
12. Stack blue_block_1 on brown_block_1
13. Pickup white_block_1 from the table

Finally, let me check if this is the most optimal (i.e., shortest) plan:

- We need to have blue_block_3 on top of white_block_2 at some point (constraint 5). Currently, blue_block_3 is on black_block_1, and white_block_2 is on blue_block_2. So, we need to unstack both.
- We need white_block_1 to have a block on top of it at some point (constraint 3), and then remove that block to achieve our goal. 

Our current plan includes 13 steps. I'm not sure if a shorter plan is possible given all the constraints, but I believe this is a near-optimal plan if not the optimal one.

Let me double-check that all constraints are indeed satisfied in the final state:

1. blue_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 (satisfying constraint 9).
2. blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2 (satisfying constraint 5).
3. white_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 (satisfying constraint 13).
4. blue_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1 (satisfying constraint 15).
5. You are holding white_block_1 (achieving the goal).
6. All other constraints are satisfied at various points during the execution of the plan.

I believe our plan is valid and optimal.

Let me make a typo in step 4. We want to stack blue_block_2 on blue_block_1, not black_block_1.

Here's the corrected plan:

1. unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2
2. stack white_block_2 on black_block_1
3. pickup blue_block_2 from the table
4. stack blue_block_2 on blue_block_1
5. unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1
6. stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2
7. pickup brown_block_1 from the table
8. stack brown_block_1 on white_block_1
9. unstack brown_block_1 from white_block_1
10. putdown brown_block_1 on the table
11. pickup blue_block_1 from the table
12. stack blue_block_1 on brown_block_1
13. pickup white_block_1 from the table
