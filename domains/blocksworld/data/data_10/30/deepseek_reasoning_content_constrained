Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld planning problem. The goal is to have the robotic arm holding white_block_1. But there are a bunch of constraints we need to satisfy along the way. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's look at the initial state. The blocks are arranged as follows:

- blue_block_1, black_block_1, blue_block_2, white_block_1, brown_block_1 are on the table.
- blue_block_3 is on top of black_block_1.
- white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_2.
- All these blocks are clear except black_block_1 (since blue_block_3 is on it) and blue_block_2 (since white_block_2 is on it).

The goal is to have the arm holding white_block_1. So, the straightforward plan would be to pick up white_block_1 from the table. But wait, we have to check the preconditions for the pickup action. For pickup, the block must be on the table, clear, and the arm must be empty. In the initial state, white_block_1 is on the table and clear, so we could do pickup white_block_1 right away. But wait, the constraints might prevent that.

Now, let's look at the constraints. There are several, and they need to be satisfied in the plan. Let's list them out:

1. At least one state where white_block_1 is not on the table. Since the goal is to hold it, which requires picking it up (so it's not on the table anymore), but we also need to satisfy that after picking it up, maybe we put it down again? Wait, but the goal is to be holding it, which would be the final state. So if the final action is pickup white_block_1, then in the final state, white_block_1 is not on the table, which satisfies constraint 1. But maybe we have to do more steps because other constraints require certain conditions.

Wait, let's check all constraints one by one.

Constraint 1: white_block_1 is not on the table in at least one state. That's satisfied once we pick it up, so that's covered.

Constraint 2: If white_block_1 is not on the table in some state, then either blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2 or blue_block_3 is on the table in that state or a later one. So, after picking up white_block_1 (so it's not on the table), we need to ensure that blue_block_3 is either on white_block_2 or on the table in that state or later. Let's see. Initially, blue_block_3 is on black_block_1. So if we leave it there, then in the state after pickup, blue_block_3 is still on black_block_1. But the constraint requires blue_block_3 to be either on the table or on white_block_2. So perhaps we need to move blue_block_3 to white_block_2 at some point. But how does that tie into the other constraints?

Constraint 3: There must be a state where white_block_1 is not clear (i.e., something is on top of it). So we need to stack another block on white_block_1 at some point. But the final goal is to hold white_block_1, so if we stack something on it, we would have to unstack it again, which might complicate things. Wait, but the constraints don't say that the final state has to have white_block_1 clear, just that the goal is to hold it. So perhaps we can stack something on white_block_1 and then unstack it later. Or maybe stack it onto something else and then pick it up again.

Constraint 4: If white_block_1 is not clear (i.e., has a block on top), then there must be an earlier state where the arm is holding white_block_2. Because when you stack a block on white_block_1, you have to hold that block. But white_block_2 is initially on blue_block_2. So to stack something on white_block_1, maybe we need to move white_block_2 first. Wait, but white_block_2 is on blue_block_2. If we unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2, then we can hold it. Then maybe stack it onto white_block_1. That would satisfy constraint 4, because when white_block_1 is not clear (due to white_block_2 on top), we had to hold white_block_2 earlier.

Constraint 5: At least one state where blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2. So we need to perform a stack blue_block_3 white_block_2 action. To do that, we need to have blue_block_3 in hand and white_block_2 clear. Initially, white_block_2 is on blue_block_2, so it's not clear. So first, we need to unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2. Then put it down, maybe, or stack it somewhere else.

Constraint 6: At least one state where either white_block_1 is on blue_block_3 or blue_block_2 is clear. Since blue_block_2 initially has white_block_2 on it, to make it clear, we need to remove white_block_2. If we unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2, blue_block_2 becomes clear, which satisfies that part of the condition. So maybe doing that would satisfy constraint 6.

Constraint 7: At least one state where brown_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1. Since brown_block_1 is on the table initially, to satisfy this, we either need to move it (so it's not on the table) or stack blue_block_3 onto it. But blue_block_3 is on black_block_1 initially. So perhaps stack blue_block_3 on brown_block_1 at some point.

Constraint 8: At least one state where brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2. Well, initially, brown_block_1 is on the table, so it's not on top of blue_block_2. So this is already true in the initial state. Wait, but the constraint says "must hold in at least one state". So the initial state already satisfies this, so no action needed here. However, the next constraint (8's implication) says that if brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2 in some state s, then in s or later, brown_block_1 is not clear. Since in the initial state, brown_block_1 is on the table and clear. So the initial state violates the implication because the antecedent (brown_block_1 not on blue_block_2) is true, but the consequent (brown_block_1 not clear) is false. Therefore, we need to ensure that whenever brown_block_1 is not on blue_block_2 (which is always except if we stack it there), then in that state or later, there's a block on brown_block_1. But since the initial state has brown_block_1 on the table and clear, we need to address this. So perhaps we need to stack something on brown_block_1 to satisfy this. Because the initial state would trigger the implication: since brown_block_1 is not on blue_block_2 (true), we must have in that state or later that brown_block_1 is not clear. But in the initial state, it is clear, so we need to later have a state where brown_block_1 has a block on top. So we have to stack something on brown_block_1 at some point.

Constraint 9: At least one state where either brown_block_1 is not clear or brown_block_1 is on top of white_block_1. We can satisfy this by either stacking something on brown_block_1 (making it not clear) or stacking brown_block_1 on white_block_1. But white_block_1 needs to be held, so maybe stacking on brown_block_1 is easier.

Constraint 10: At least one state where blue_block_3 is not on white_block_1. Initially, blue_block_3 is on black_block_1, so this is already true. But perhaps after moving it, we need to ensure it's not on white_block_1. Wait, the constraint says "blue_block_3 is not on top of white_block_1" must hold in at least one state. Since in the initial state, it's not, that's already satisfied. So no action needed here. But the implication for constraint 10: if in some state s, blue_block_3 is not on white_block_1, then in s or later, either blue_block_2 is on black_block_1 or blue_block_2 is not on the table. So, since the initial state satisfies the antecedent (blue_block_3 not on white_block_1), we need to ensure that in the initial state or later, blue_block_2 is on black_block_1 or not on the table. Blue_block_2 is initially on the table, so to satisfy this, we need to either stack blue_block_2 on black_block_1 or move it elsewhere (like stacking it on another block, making it not on the table). But blue_block_2 has white_block_2 on it initially. So to move blue_block_2, we need to first unstack white_block_2 from it. Then pickup blue_block_2 and stack it somewhere.

Constraint 11: At least one state where either white_block_2 is on black_block_1 or blue_block_2 is not on the table. Since blue_block_2 is initially on the table, to satisfy this, we need to either move blue_block_2 off the table or stack white_block_2 on black_block_1. For example, unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2, then stack white_block_2 on black_block_1. That would satisfy this constraint.

Constraint 12: At least one state where blue_block_2 is not on top of white_block_2. Initially, white_block_2 is on blue_block_2, so blue_block_2 is not on white_block_2. Wait, no: blue_block_2 is under white_block_2, so blue_block_2 is not on top of white_block_2. So the initial state already satisfies this constraint. Therefore, no action needed here. But the implication for constraint 12: if blue_block_2 is not on white_block_2 in some state s, then in s or later, the arm is holding blue_block_2. But in the initial state, blue_block_2 is not on white_block_2 (since white_block_2 is on blue_block_2), so the antecedent is true, and we need to ensure that in that state or later, the arm holds blue_block_2. So, at some point, we need to pick up blue_block_2.

Putting all this together, the plan must include actions that satisfy all these constraints. Let's try to outline a possible sequence.

First, the goal is to hold white_block_1. But to satisfy the constraints, we need to perform several other actions.

Let's start by considering constraint 2. After picking up white_block_1 (which makes it not on the table), we need to ensure blue_block_3 is on white_block_2 or on the table. Since initially, blue_block_3 is on black_block_1, we might need to move it. Let's say we stack blue_block_3 onto white_block_2. To do that:

1. Unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1. Preconditions: blue_block_3 is clear (initially it is), and the arm is empty. So unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1. Then, we're holding blue_block_3.

2. Now, to stack it on white_block_2, white_block_2 needs to be clear. But white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_2. So first, we need to unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2.

Wait, but we can't do that yet because the arm is holding blue_block_3. So perhaps the order is different.

Alternative approach: To stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2, we need white_block_2 to be clear. But white_block_2 is on blue_block_2. So first, unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2.

So:

1. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2. Preconditions: white_block_2 is clear (initially yes?), wait no. Initially, white_block_2 is on blue_block_2. So white_block_2 is clear (since nothing is on top of it). So we can unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2. Then, we hold white_block_2. Then, putdown white_block_2 on the table. But that would make blue_block_2 clear. But maybe instead, we need to stack white_block_2 somewhere else, like on black_block_1 to satisfy constraint 11.

Wait, constraint 11 requires that in some state, either white_block_2 is on black_block_1 or blue_block_2 is not on the table. If we move white_block_2 to black_block_1, then blue_block_2 remains on the table. Alternatively, if we move blue_block_2 somewhere else (like stacking it on another block), that would make it not on the table. But moving blue_block_2 requires first clearing it, which is done by moving white_block_2.

So steps so far:

1. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2. Now holding white_block_2. Then, stack white_block_2 on black_block_1. But black_block_1 has blue_block_3 on it. Wait, initially, blue_block_3 is on black_block_1. So to stack white_block_2 on black_block_1, we need to first unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's re-express the initial state:

- black_block_1 has blue_block_3 on top.
- blue_block_2 has white_block_2 on top.

So, initial state:

black_block_1: blue_block_3 (clear)
blue_block_2: white_block_2 (clear)
others on table.

So, to stack white_block_2 onto black_block_1, we need to first unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1.

So steps:

1. Unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1. Now holding blue_block_3. Then, putdown blue_block_3 on the table. Now, black_block_1 is clear. Then, stack white_block_2 on black_block_1.

But let's see:

Alternatively, after unstacking white_block_2 from blue_block_2 (step 1), we can stack white_block_2 onto black_block_1, but black_block_1 has blue_block_3 on it. So we can't stack there unless we move blue_block_3 first.

Therefore, perhaps:

1. Unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1. Preconditions: blue_block_3 is clear (yes), arm empty. So unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1. Now holding blue_block_3.

2. Putdown blue_block_3 on the table. Now, black_block_1 is clear.

3. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2. Now holding white_block_2.

4. Stack white_block_2 on black_block_1. Now, white_block_2 is on black_block_1. This satisfies constraint 11 (white_block_2 on black_block_1).

Then, we can proceed to stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2 (to satisfy constraint 5), which requires blue_block_3 to be on white_block_2 in some state.

So next steps:

5. Pickup blue_block_3 (now on table). Preconditions: clear, on table, arm empty. Yes.

6. Stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2. Now, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2. This satisfies constraint 5.

Now, let's check constraint 2: after white_block_1 is not on the table (which will be when we pick it up), blue_block_3 must be on white_block_2 or on the table. So in the state after we pick up white_block_1, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2 (from step 6), which satisfies constraint 2.

Next, constraint 3: white_block_1 must have a block on top in some state. To do that, we need to stack something on white_block_1. But to stack on white_block_1, it must be clear. Initially, white_block_1 is on the table and clear. So after picking it up and putting it down again, it's clear again. Wait, but if we stack something on it, that would make it not clear.

Wait, perhaps after we pick up white_block_1, we can put it down again and then stack something on it. But the goal is to end up holding white_block_1, so maybe we need to do that towards the end.

Alternatively, maybe stack white_block_2 onto white_block_1. But white_block_2 is on black_block_1 after step 4. So to stack something on white_block_1, we need to have that block in hand. Let's think.

Alternatively, after step 6, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2, which is on black_block_1. Then, perhaps we can stack another block on white_block_1. For example, take brown_block_1 and stack it on white_block_1. But brown_block_1 is on the table and clear. So steps could be:

7. Pickup brown_block_1. Preconditions: clear, on table, arm empty. Yes.

8. Stack brown_block_1 on white_block_1. Now white_block_1 has brown_block_1 on top, satisfying constraint 3. But then we need to unstack brown_block_1 later to pick up white_block_1 again. Also, this satisfies constraint 9 (brown_block_1 is on top of white_block_1) or constraint 9 says "brown_block_1 is not clear or on white_block_1". If brown_block_1 is on white_block_1, then it's not clear, so that satisfies constraint 9.

But then, we need to ensure that if brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2 (which it isn't, since it's on white_block_1), then in that state or later, brown_block_1 is not clear (which it isn't, because it's on white_block_1). So that's covered.

Now, after stacking brown_block_1 on white_block_1, we need to unstack it to pick up white_block_1 again. So:

9. Unstack brown_block_1 from white_block_1. Preconditions: brown_block_1 is clear (yes, since it's on top), arm empty. Unstack brown_block_1 white_block_1. Now holding brown_block_1.

10. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table. Now, white_block_1 is clear again.

11. Pickup white_block_1. Now, the goal is achieved. But wait, in the final state, we need to be holding white_block_1. So step 11 would be the final action.

But let's check all the constraints again with this plan:

Constraints:

1. white_block_1 not on table: yes, when we pick it up (step 11), but also when we put it down after step 8 (if we put it down). Wait, in the steps above, after step 8, white_block_1 is on the table with brown_block_1 on top. So white_block_1 is still on the table. Then, when we unstack brown_block_1, white_block_1 remains on the table. So to have white_block_1 not on the table, we need to pick it up. So step 11 would be the only time white_block_1 is not on the table. So constraint 1 is satisfied.

Constraint 2: When white_block_1 is not on the table (step 11), blue_block_3 is on white_block_2 (from step 6), which satisfies the condition.

Constraint 3: white_block_1 not clear (step 8 when brown_block_1 is on it).

Constraint 4: In the state where white_block_1 is not clear (step 8), there must be an earlier state where we held white_block_2. That's step 3 (unstack white_block_2) and step 4 (stack it). So yes.

Constraint 5: blue_block_3 on white_block_2 (step 6).

Constraint 6: At least one state where white_block_1 is on blue_block_3 or blue_block_2 is clear. After step 3, blue_block_2 is clear (since white_block_2 was removed). So in the state after step 3, blue_block_2 is clear, satisfying the second part. So constraint 6 is satisfied.

Constraint 7: brown_block_1 not on the table or blue_block_3 on brown_block_1. In step 7-8, brown_block_1 is picked up and stacked on white_block_1, so it's not on the table. So in that state, brown_block_1 is not on the table, satisfying the first part. Also, if we stack blue_block_3 on brown_block_1 later, that would also work. But in our current plan, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2. So step 7-8 satisfies constraint 7.

Constraint 8: brown_block_1 not on top of blue_block_2. Initially true, and remains true.

But the implication for constraint 8 says that whenever brown_block_1 is not on blue_block_2 (which is always except if we stack it there), then brown_block_1 must not be clear in that state or later. So after step 8, brown_block_1 is on white_block_1, so it's not clear. So in the state after step 8, brown_block_1 is not clear, satisfying the implication. So that's covered.

Constraint 9: brown_block_1 not clear or on white_block_1. After step 8, brown_block_1 is on white_block_1, so it's not clear. So that's satisfied.

Constraint 10: blue_block_3 not on white_block_1. In our plan, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2, so this is satisfied. The implication here is that if blue_block_3 is not on white_block_1 (which is always true in our plan), then blue_block_2 is on black_block_1 or not on the table. After step 3, blue_block_2 is clear and on the table. But in step 3, we unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2, making blue_block_2 clear and still on the table. So to satisfy the implication for constraint 10, we need to ensure that after the state where blue_block_3 is not on white_block_1 (which is all the time), blue_block_2 is on black_block_1 or not on the table. Since blue_block_2 is on the table until we move it. So we need to move blue_block_2. For example, stack blue_block_2 on black_block_1 or another block.

Wait, this is a problem. Because according to constraint 10's implication, whenever blue_block_3 is not on white_block_1 (which is always), we need in that state or later that blue_block_2 is on black_block_1 or not on the table. In our current plan, after step 3, blue_block_2 is still on the table. So we need to do something with blue_block_2.

So let's add steps to move blue_block_2. For example:

After step 3 (unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2), blue_block_2 is clear. Then:

4. Pickup blue_block_2. Preconditions: clear, on table, arm empty. After step 3, we are holding white_block_2. So before picking up blue_block_2, we need to put down white_block_2.

Wait, let's adjust the steps:

Original steps up to step 3:

1. Unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1. Hold blue_block_3.

2. Putdown blue_block_3. Now on table.

3. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2. Now holding white_block_2.

4. Putdown white_block_2 on the table. Now, blue_block_2 is clear.

5. Pickup blue_block_2. Now holding blue_block_2.

6. Stack blue_block_2 on black_block_1. Now, blue_block_2 is on black_block_1, which satisfies constraint 10's implication (blue_block_2 is not on the table).

But this changes other steps. Then, after stacking blue_block_2 on black_block_1, we can proceed to stack white_block_2 on blue_block_2? Wait, no, because blue_block_2 is on black_block_1. So white_block_2 can be stacked on blue_block_2 if it's clear. Let me see.

Alternatively, after stacking blue_block_2 on black_block_1, we can stack white_block_2 on blue_block_2. But that requires white_block_2 to be in hand. Let's adjust:

After step 5 (holding blue_block_2):

6. Stack blue_block_2 on black_block_1. Now, blue_block_2 is on black_block_1. Then, we can proceed to stack white_block_2 on blue_block_2. But we need to pick up white_block_2 again.

Wait, this seems complicated. Maybe we need to rearrange the steps.

Alternatively, after step 3 (unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2), put down white_block_2, then pickup blue_block_2 and stack it somewhere, making it not on the table.

So revised steps:

1. Unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1. Hold blue_block_3.

2. Putdown blue_block_3.

3. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2. Hold white_block_2.

4. Putdown white_block_2.

5. Pickup blue_block_2. Now holding blue_block_2.

6. Stack blue_block_2 on black_block_1. Now, blue_block_2 is not on the table. This satisfies constraint 10's implication because blue_block_2 is not on the table, so whenever blue_block_3 is not on white_block_1 (which it is), blue_block_2 is not on the table.

Then proceed to stack white_block_2 on black_block_1 or another block.

But this complicates the plan. However, it's necessary to satisfy constraint 10's implication. So we have to include moving blue_block_2 off the table.

Continuing with the revised steps:

7. Pickup white_block_2 (after step 4, it's on the table).

8. Stack white_block_2 on black_block_1. Now, black_block_1 has blue_block_2 and white_block_2? Wait, no. If blue_block_2 is stacked on black_block_1 in step 6, then black_block_1 has blue_block_2, which is clear. Then stacking white_block_2 on blue_block_2 would require blue_block_2 to be clear. Yes. So:

6. Stack blue_block_2 on black_block_1. Now, blue_block_2 is on black_block_1, clear.

7. Pickup white_block_2 from the table (step 4 put it there).

8. Stack white_block_2 on blue_block_2. Now, white_block_2 is on blue_block_2, which is on black_block_1. Then, blue_block_3 can be stacked on white_block_2.

9. Pickup blue_block_3 (from step 2, it's on the table).

10. Stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2. Now, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2, satisfying constraint 5.

Then proceed to handle brown_block_1 and white_block_1:

11. Pickup brown_block_1.

12. Stack brown_block_1 on white_block_1. Now, white_block_1 has brown_block_1 on top (satisfies constraint 3).

13. Unstack brown_block_1 from white_block_1.

14. Putdown brown_block_1.

15. Pickup white_block_1. Now, goal achieved.

This plan would satisfy all the constraints. Let's check each one again:

1. white_block_1 not on table: step 15, yes.

2. After step 15, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2 (step 10), so satisfies.

3. Step 12: white_block_1 has brown_block_1 on top.

4. In step 12, white_block_1 is not clear. Earlier step where we held white_block_2: steps 3 and 7-8. Yes.

5. Step 10: blue_block_3 on white_block_2.

6. After step 3, blue_block_2 is clear (since we unstacked white_block_2), but in revised steps, after step 3, we putdown white_block_2, then move blue_block_2. So after step 5, blue_block_2 is picked up and then stacked on black_block_1. So in step 6, blue_block_2 is on black_block_1, so not on the table, satisfying the second part of constraint 6.

7. In step 11, brown_block_1 is picked up, so it's not on the table, satisfying constraint 7.

8. Constraint 8 is satisfied as discussed.

9. In step 12, brown_block_1 is on white_block_1, so not clear.

10. After step 6, blue_block_2 is not on the table, satisfying constraint 10's implication.

11. In step 8, white_block_2 is stacked on blue_block_2 (on black_block_1), so white_block_2 is on black_block_1's tower. But constraint 11 requires white_block_2 on black_block_1 or blue_block_2 not on the table. Since blue_block_2 is not on the table (stacked on black_block_1), this is satisfied.

12. Constraint 12 is satisfied as discussed.

13. For constraint 12's implication: whenever blue_block_2 is not on white_block_2 (which is always), in that state or later, the arm holds blue_block_2. In step 5, the arm picks up blue_block_2, satisfying this.

Thus, this plan seems to satisfy all constraints. Now, let's write the step-by-step actions:

1. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
2. putdown blue_block_3
3. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
4. putdown white_block_2
5. pickup blue_block_2
6. stack blue_block_2 black_block_1
7. pickup white_block_2
8. stack white_block_2 blue_block_2
9. pickup blue_block_3
10. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2
11. pickup brown_block_1
12. stack brown_block_1 white_block_1
13. unstack brown_block_1 white_block_1
14. putdown brown_block_1
15. pickup white_block_1

Now, let's count the steps. Is there a shorter way? For example, can we avoid some steps?

Alternatively, maybe after unstacking white_block_2 from blue_block_2 (step 3), instead of putting it down, we can stack it on black_block_1 directly. But black_block_1 has blue_block_3 on it. So we need to unstack blue_block_3 first.

Alternative sequence:

1. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
2. putdown blue_block_3
3. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
4. stack white_block_2 black_block_1
5. pickup blue_block_2
6. stack blue_block_2 black_block_1 (but black_block_1 now has white_block_2, so stacking blue_block_2 on white_block_2?)

Wait, no. After step 4, white_block_2 is on black_block_1. So blue_block_2 is clear and on the table. Then, pick up blue_block_2 and stack it on black_block_1 (on top of white_block_2). Then, blue_block_2 is on white_block_2. Then, stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2 (which is now under blue_block_2). That's not possible. So this approach might not work.

Alternatively, after step 4 (white_block_2 on black_block_1), stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2. Then, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2. Then proceed to handle brown_block_1 and white_block_1.

But this alternative path may not save steps. Let's see:

Original plan steps: 15 steps.

Alternative approach:

1. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
2. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2 (but white_block_2 is on blue_block_2, so first unstack white_block_2)
Wait, no. To stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 must be clear. So need to unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2 first.

So steps:

1. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
2. stack white_block_2 black_block_1 (but black_block_1 has blue_block_3 on it; so need to unstack blue_block_3 first)
3. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
4. putdown blue_block_3
5. stack white_block_2 black_block_1
6. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2
7. pickup blue_block_2
8. stack blue_block_2 black_block_1 (on top of white_block_2)
...

This seems more steps. So perhaps the original plan is better.

But let's see if the original plan can be optimized. For example, after step 8 (stack white_block_2 on blue_block_2 which is on black_block_1), can we stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2 without putting down blue_block_3 first? Let's see:

In the original plan:

After step 6 (stack blue_block_2 on black_block_1), step 7 is pickup white_block_2 (which is on the table from step 4). Then stack it on blue_block_2 (step 8). Then pickup blue_block_3 (step 9) and stack on white_block_2 (step 10). This seems necessary.

Another optimization: can we avoid putting down blue_block_3 after unstacking it from black_block_1? For example, after unstacking blue_block_3, instead of putting it down, directly stack it on white_block_2. But white_block_2 is on blue_block_2, which is on the table. So to stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2, we need white_block_2 to be clear. But white_block_2 is on blue_block_2, so it's clear. Wait, no. If white_block_2 is on blue_block_2, then white_block_2 is clear. So after unstacking blue_block_3 from black_block_1 (holding it), then unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2 (holding white_block_2), then stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2. But that requires white_block_2 to be on a block. Wait, no. To stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 must be clear and on a block or table. But if white_block_2 is in the arm, then you can't stack blue_block_3 on it. So perhaps:

1. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1 (hold blue_block_3)
2. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2 (requires putting down blue_block_3 first? No, arm is holding blue_block_3, so can't unstack white_block_2 unless arm is empty. So this approach won't work.

So the original plan seems necessary.

Therefore, the final plan is as outlined with 15 steps. But wait, the user asked for an optimal plan (shortest possible). Let's see if there's a shorter way.

Alternative approach: Instead of stacking brown_block_1 on white_block_1 and then unstacking it, perhaps use another block. For example, use blue_block_1 to stack on white_block_1. But blue_block_1 is on the table and clear. So:

After step 10 (stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2):

11. pickup blue_block_1
12. stack blue_block_1 white_block_1 (satisfies constraint 3)
13. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
14. putdown blue_block_1
15. pickup white_block_1

This also uses 15 steps. No improvement.

Alternatively, can we use a different block for constraint 3? For example, stack blue_block_3 on white_block_1. But that would require moving blue_block_3 again. Let's see:

After step 10 (stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2), then:

11. unstack blue_block_3 white_block_2 (requires arm empty)
12. stack blue_block_3 white_block_1 (satisfies constraint 3)
13. unstack blue_block_3 white_block_1 (to pick up white_block_1)
14. putdown blue_block_3
15. pickup white_block_1

This adds steps, making it longer. Not better.

Another idea: Can we satisfy constraint 3 by stacking white_block_1 onto another block, making it not clear? For example, stack white_block_1 on blue_block_3. Then, you have to unstack it again. But that would require white_block_1 to be on the table first. Wait, the goal is to hold white_block_1. So:

After step 10 (blue_block_3 on white_block_2):

11. pickup white_block_1
12. stack white_block_1 blue_block_3 (now white_block_1 is on blue_block_3, making it not clear. Then, unstack it.
13. unstack white_block_1 blue_block_3
14. (now holding white_block_1, which is the goal)

This would be steps 1-10, then 11-14. Total steps 14. Let's see:

Steps:

1. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
2. putdown blue_block_3
3. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
4. putdown white_block_2
5. pickup blue_block_2
6. stack blue_block_2 black_block_1
7. pickup white_block_2
8. stack white_block_2 blue_block_2
9. pickup blue_block_3
10. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2
11. pickup white_block_1
12. stack white_block_1 blue_block_3
13. unstack white_block_1 blue_block_3

But wait, after step 13, we are holding white_block_1, which is the goal. So steps 1-13.

But does this satisfy all constraints?

Constraint 3: white_block_1 not clear. Step 12: white_block_1 is on blue_block_3, so not clear. Yes.

Constraint 4: When white_block_1 is not clear (step 12), earlier state where we held white_block_2. Steps 3 and 7-8, yes.

Constraint 5: blue_block_3 on white_block_2 (step 10).

Constraint 6: blue_block_2 is not on the table (step 6), so satisfies.

Constraint 7: brown_block_1 is on the table in step 11, but we need to have either brown_block_1 not on table or blue_block_3 on brown_block_1. But in this plan, we didn't touch brown_block_1. So this violates constraint 7. Therefore, we need to address brown_block_1.

Ah, right. So this approach doesn't handle constraint 7. So we have to include actions involving brown_block_1.

So back to the original plan where we stack brown_block_1 on white_block_1.

Thus, the original 15-step plan seems necessary.

Another thought: Can we combine moving brown_block_1 with another action? For example, after stacking blue_block_3 on white_block_2 (step 10), pickup brown_block_1 and stack it on white_block_1 (steps 11-12), then unstack it (13-14), then pickup white_block_1 (15). That's 15 steps.

Yes. So it's necessary.

Now, checking the constraints again with this plan, all are satisfied.

Thus, the optimal plan likely has 15 actions. But perhaps there's a shorter path.

Wait, maybe there's a way to avoid stacking blue_block_2 on black_block_1. Let's revisit constraint 10's implication. The implication is that if blue_block_3 is not on white_block_1 (which is always true), then in that state or later, blue_block_2 is on black_block_1 or not on the table. So if we can make blue_block_2 not on the table without stacking it on black_block_1, perhaps by stacking it on another block. For example, stack blue_block_2 on brown_block_1.

But then we need to clear brown_block_1 first. Let's see:

After step 3 (unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2):

4. putdown white_block_2
5. pickup blue_block_2
6. stack blue_block_2 brown_block_1

Now, blue_block_2 is on brown_block_1, which is on the table. Then, brown_block_1 is not clear. This satisfies constraint 8's implication (whenever brown_block_1 is not on blue_block_2, which it is, then brown_block_1 is not clear). So that works.

Then, proceed to stack white_block_2 on black_block_1, etc.

But this saves steps? Let's see:

Revised plan:

1. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
2. putdown blue_block_3
3. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
4. putdown white_block_2
5. pickup blue_block_2
6. stack blue_block_2 brown_block_1 (now blue_block_2 is not on the table)
7. pickup white_block_2
8. stack white_block_2 black_block_1
9. pickup blue_block_3
10. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2
11. pickup brown_block_1 (now on blue_block_2)
12. stack brown_block_1 white_block_1
13. unstack brown_block_1 white_block_1
14. putdown brown_block_1
15. pickup white_block_1

This plan also has 15 steps. Not shorter.

Another idea: Can we use brown_block_1 earlier to satisfy constraint 7?

For example, stack blue_block_3 on brown_block_1, satisfying constraint 7 (blue_block_3 on brown_block_1).

Steps:

1. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
2. stack blue_block_3 brown_block_1 (satisfies constraint 7)
3. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
4. stack white_block_2 black_block_1
5. pickup blue_block_2
6. stack blue_block_2 black_block_1 (on top of white_block_2)
7. pickup blue_block_3
8. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2 (satisfies constraint 5)
9. pickup brown_block_1 (from table, since blue_block_3 was stacked on it)
10. stack brown_block_1 white_block_1
11. unstack brown_block_1 white_block_1
12. putdown brown_block_1
13. pickup white_block_1

But wait, after step 2, blue_block_3 is on brown_block_1. Then, in step 7, to pickup blue_block_3, we need to unstack it from brown_block_1. So steps should be:

1. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
2. stack blue_block_3 brown_block_1
3. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
4. stack white_block_2 black_block_1
5. pickup blue_block_2
6. stack blue_block_2 black_block_1
7. unstack blue_block_3 brown_block_1
8. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2
9. pickup brown_block_1
10. stack brown_block_1 white_block_1
11. unstack brown_block_1 white_block_1
12. putdown brown_block_1
13. pickup white_block_1

This is 13 steps. But let's check constraints:

Constraint 7: blue_block_3 is on brown_block_1 (step 2), so satisfies "blue_block_3 on brown_block_1", which is one of the options. So yes.

Constraint 5: blue_block_3 is on white_block_2 (step 8), yes.

Constraint 3: step 10, brown_block_1 on white_block_1.

Constraint 4: when white_block_1 is not clear (step 10), earlier step of holding white_block_2 (step 3 and 4).

Constraint 6: after step 5, blue_block_2 is picked up and stacked on black_block_1 (step 6), so blue_block_2 is not on the table, satisfying "blue_block_2 not on the table".

Constraint 10: blue_block_2 is not on the table (step 6), so satisfies.

Constraint 8: brown_block_1 is not on blue_block_2 (true), so in step 10, brown_block_1 is on white_block_1, making it not clear, satisfying the implication.

This plan has 13 steps. This seems better. But let's verify all constraints:

Constraint 1: white_block_1 not on table in step 13.

Constraint 2: after step 13, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2 (step 8), yes.

Constraint 3: step 10.

Constraint 4: held white_block_2 in steps 3 and 4.

Constraint 5: step 8.

Constraint 6: blue_block_2 not on table (step 6).

Constraint 7: step 2.

Constraint 8: yes.

Constraint 9: step 10.

Constraint 10: yes.

Constraint 11: step 4 (white_block_2 on black_block_1).

Constraint 12: blue_block_2 not on white_block_2 (step 6 is blue_block_2 on black_block_1), and in step 5, pickup blue_block_2 satisfies the implication.

This seems to work with 13 steps, which is shorter than the previous plan. So this would be more optimal.

Let's outline the steps clearly:

1. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
2. stack blue_block_3 brown_block_1
3. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
4. stack white_block_2 black_block_1
5. pickup blue_block_2
6. stack blue_block_2 black_block_1
7. unstack blue_block_3 brown_block_1
8. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2
9. pickup brown_block_1
10. stack brown_block_1 white_block_1
11. unstack brown_block_1 white_block_1
12. putdown brown_block_1
13. pickup white_block_1

Now, checking each step for preconditions:

Step 1: unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1. Preconditions: blue_block_3 is clear (yes), arm empty (yes).

Step 2: stack blue_block_3 on brown_block_1. Preconditions: holding blue_block_3 (yes), brown_block_1 is clear (yes, initially on table and clear).

Step 3: unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2. Preconditions: white_block_2 is clear (yes), arm empty (yes, after step 2, arm is empty).

Step 4: stack white_block_2 on black_block_1. Preconditions: holding white_block_2 (yes), black_block_1 is clear (yes, after step 1, black_block_1 is clear).

Step 5: pickup blue_block_2. Preconditions: blue_block_2 is on table (yes, after step 3), clear (yes), arm empty (yes).

Step 6: stack blue_block_2 on black_block_1. Preconditions: holding blue_block_2 (yes), black_block_1 is clear (no, after step 4, black_block_1 has white_block_2 and blue_block_2 is being stacked on top. Wait, no: after step 4, white_block_2 is stacked on black_block_1. So black_block_1 has white_block_2 on it, which is clear. Then step 6 stacks blue_block_2 on white_block_2. Wait, no: stack blue_block_2 on black_block_1. But black_block_1 already has white_block_2 on it. So stacking blue_block_2 on black_block_1 would require black_block_1 to be clear. Which it's not, because white_block_2 is on it. So this step is invalid.

Ah, here's a mistake. After step 4, white_block_2 is on black_block_1. So to stack blue_block_2 on black_block_1, we need to unstack white_block_2 first. Therefore, step 6 is invalid.

This is a critical error. So the plan is incorrect.

Therefore, the previous approach is invalid. This shows the importance of checking preconditions.

Correcting this: After step 4, white_block_2 is on black_block_1. To stack blue_block_2 on black_block_1, we need black_block_1 to be clear. But it's not. So the plan is incorrect.

This means we need to revise the steps. So after step 4, we can't stack blue_block_2 on black_block_1. Instead, we need to stack blue_block_2 elsewhere.

Alternative approach after step 4:

5. pickup blue_block_2 (on table, clear)

6. stack blue_block_2 brown_block_1 (brown_block_1 has blue_block_3 on it from step 2. So brown_block_1 is not clear. So cannot stack. Therefore, invalid.

Hmm. So perhaps stack blue_block_2 on white_block_2, which is on black_block_1. White_block_2 is clear after step 4.

Step 5: pickup blue_block_2

Step 6: stack blue_block_2 white_block_2

Preconditions: holding blue_block_2 (yes), white_block_2 is clear (yes, after step 4).

Yes. Then, blue_block_2 is on white_block_2, which is on black_block_1. This makes blue_block_2 not on the table, satisfying constraint 10's implication.

Then proceed:

7. unstack blue_block_3 from brown_block_1 (preconditions: blue_block_3 is clear (yes), arm empty (after step 6, arm is empty).

8. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2 (preconditions: holding blue_block_3, white_block_2 is clear. But white_block_2 has blue_block_2 on it, so not clear. Therefore, cannot stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2. This is a problem.

So this approach doesn't work. Thus, the earlier attempt to stack blue_block_2 on black_block_1 was invalid, leading to an error.

This suggests that the initial plan with 15 steps is necessary.

Given the complexity of the constraints and the preconditions, the optimal plan likely requires the initial sequence of 15 steps. However, I might have missed a shortcut. Let's try to find a shorter valid plan.

Alternative plan focusing on satisfying constraints with minimal steps:

1. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2. Now holding white_block_2.
2. Stack white_block_2 on black_block_1. But black_block_1 has blue_block_3 on it. So first unstack blue_block_3.
3. Unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1. Now holding blue_block_3.
4. Putdown blue_block_3.
5. Stack white_block_2 on black_block_1. Now, white_block_2 is on black_block_1.
6. Pickup blue_block_3.
7. Stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2. Satisfies constraint 5.
8. Pickup brown_block_1.
9. Stack brown_block_1 on white_block_1. Satisfies constraint 3 and 7 (brown_block_1 not on table).
10. Unstack brown_block_1 from white_block_1.
11. Putdown brown_block_1.
12. Pickup white_block_1. Goal achieved.

Now, check the constraints:

1. white_block_1 not on table in step 12. Yes.

2. After step 12, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2 (step 7). Yes.

3. Step 9: white_block_1 has brown_block_1 on top. Yes.

4. In step 9, earlier step where we held white_block_2 (steps 1 and 5). Yes.

5. Step 7: blue_block_3 on white_block_2. Yes.

6. After step 1, blue_block_2 is clear. So constraint 6 is satisfied (blue_block_2 is clear).

7. Step 9: brown_block_1 not on table. Yes.

8. brown_block_1 not on blue_block_2 (always true). Then, step 9: brown_block_1 is on white_block_1 (not clear). Yes.

9. Step 9: brown_block_1 not clear. Yes.

10. blue_block_3 not on white_block_1 (yes). Then, in step 7, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2. But constraint 10's implication requires blue_block_2 to be on black_block_1 or not on table. In this plan, blue_block_2 is still on the table. So this is violated.

Thus, this plan doesn't satisfy constraint 10's implication. Therefore, invalid.

Thus, the correct plan must include moving blue_block_2.

After step 1 (unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2), blue_block_2 is clear.

Then, pickup blue_block_2 and stack it somewhere to take it off the table.

For example:

1. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
2. stack white_block_2 black_block_1 (requires unstacking blue_block_3 first)
3. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
4. putdown blue_block_3
5. stack white_block_2 black_block_1
6. pickup blue_block_2
7. stack blue_block_2 black_block_1 (on top of white_block_2)
8. pickup blue_block_3
9. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2
10. pickup brown_block_1
11. stack brown_block_1 white_block_1
12. unstack brown_block_1 white_block_1
13. putdown brown_block_1
14. pickup white_block_1

This plan has 14 steps. Check constraint 10's implication: blue_block_2 is not on the table (step 7), so satisfies. Check all other constraints similarly. This might work.

But let's check the steps:

1. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2: OK.
2. stack white_block_2 black_block_1: No, because black_block_1 has blue_block_3 on it. So need to unstack blue_block_3 first.

Corrected steps:

1. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
2. putdown blue_block_3
3. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
4. stack white_block_2 black_block_1
5. pickup blue_block_2
6. stack blue_block_2 black_block_1
7. pickup blue_block_3
8. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2
9. pickup brown_block_1
10. stack brown_block_1 white_block_1
11. unstack brown_block_1 white_block_1
12. putdown brown_block_1
13. pickup white_block_1

This plan has 13 steps. Check constraints:

1. step 13: white_block_1 not on table. Yes.

2. step 8: blue_block_3 on white_block_2. Yes.

3. step 10: white_block_1 has brown_block_1. Yes.

4. step 10: earlier steps 3 and 4 (holding white_block_2). Yes.

5. step 8: yes.

6. after step 5, blue_block_2 is picked up, then stacked on black_block_1 (step 6). So blue_block_2 not on table. Yes.

7. step 9-10: brown_block_1 not on table. Yes.

8. brown_block_1 not on blue_block_2. In step 10, brown_block_1 is on white_block_1. So step 10, brown_block_1 not clear. Yes.

9. step 10: yes.

10. blue_block_3 not on white_block_1 (yes). blue_block_2 not on table (step 6). Yes.

11. step 4: white_block_2 on black_block_1. Yes.

12. blue_block_2 not on white_block_2 (step 6: blue_block_2 on black_block_1). Implication: step 5, pickup blue_block_2. Yes.

All constraints are satisfied. This plan has 13 steps.

So this is shorter than the initial 15-step plan. Thus, this is the optimal plan.
