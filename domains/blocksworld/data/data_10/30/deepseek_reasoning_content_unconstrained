Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to have the robotic arm hold the white_block_1. Let's start by understanding the initial state and the required goal.

First, looking at the initial state. The blocks are arranged as follows:

- blue_block_1 is on the table and clear.
- black_block_1 is on the table, with blue_block_3 on top of it. Since blue_block_3 is clear, that means nothing is on top of it.
- blue_block_2 is on the table, and white_block_2 is on top of it. White_block_2 is clear, so nothing is on it.
- white_block_1 is on the table and clear.
- brown_block_1 is on the table and clear.
- The arm is empty.

The goal is to have the arm holding white_block_1. To achieve this, we need to find a sequence of actions that leads to this state, respecting all the constraints.

Let's think about the actions available. To hold a block, we can either pick it up from the table if it's clear or unstack it from another block. Since white_block_1 is on the table and clear in the initial state, the straightforward action would be to perform 'pickup white_block_1'. But wait, let's check the preconditions for pickup:

1. The block must be on the table.
2. The block must be clear (no blocks on top).
3. The arm is not holding anything.

In the initial state, white_block_1 is on the table and clear, and the arm is empty. So the preconditions for 'pickup white_block_1' are satisfied. Therefore, the simplest plan would just be that single action. But wait, are there any constraints mentioned that might prevent this? The problem says the plan must abide by the constraints, but looking back, there are no additional constraints listed beyond the usual action preconditions. So if that's the case, then the plan is just one step: pickup white_block_1.

But let me double-check. The initial state says white_block_1 is on the table and clear. The arm is empty. So yes, 'pickup white_block_1' is possible. No other blocks are on top of it. So why isn't the plan just that single action? That seems too simple, but maybe that's correct. Let me confirm the effects of the pickup action. After pickup, the arm is holding white_block_1, which is exactly the goal. So the plan would be just that one action. But perhaps there's a mistake here. Maybe I'm missing a constraint. Wait, the problem mentions "a valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then the user didn't list any specific constraints beyond the usual action preconditions. So maybe there are no additional constraints, and the answer is indeed just the pickup action.

But sometimes, in some problem descriptions, there might be hidden constraints, but in this case, the user didn't specify any. So the optimal plan is simply picking up white_block_1. That would achieve the goal in one step, which is the shortest possible. Therefore, the correct plan is:

```
pickup white_block_1
```

But let me make sure that there's no block on top of white_block_1. The initial state says "there is no block on top of white_block_1, i.e., white_block_1 is clear." So yes. The arm is empty. So all preconditions are met. The action pickup white_block_1 is valid. Therefore, the optimal plan is indeed one action.
