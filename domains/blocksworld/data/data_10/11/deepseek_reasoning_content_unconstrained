Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld problem. So the goal is to make sure that red_block_1 is clear. In the initial state, red_block_1 has black_block_2 on top of it. So I need to remove black_block_2 from red_block_1. But wait, black_block_2 has green_block_1 on top of it. And green_block_1 is clear. Then there's another stack: orange_block_1 has brown_block_1, which has green_block_2 on top. 

So the main issue is the stack starting with red_block_1, then black_block_2, then green_block_1. To clear red_block_1, we need to remove black_block_2. But to do that, first we have to remove green_block_1 from black_block_2. Because you can't unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1 if there's something on top of black_block_2. 

So the steps would be: unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2. But wait, green_block_1 is clear, so we can pick it up. Wait, no. The initial state says green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2, and green_block_1 is clear. So to unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2, the preconditions are: green_block_1 is on black_block_2, green_block_1 is clear, and the arm is empty. Which they are. So the first action would be unstack green_block_1 black_block_2. Then we have to put it somewhere. Let's see, after unstacking, the arm is holding green_block_1. Then we can put it down on the table. So putdown green_block_1. 

Now, black_block_2 is clear. So then we can unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. But wait, red_block_1 is on the table, and black_block_2 is on red_block_1. So unstack black_block_2 red_block_1. Preconditions: black_block_2 is on red_block_1, black_block_2 is clear (which it is now that green_block_1 is removed), and the arm is empty. Wait, after putting down green_block_1, the arm is empty. So yes, we can unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. Then we need to put it somewhere. Put it on the table? That would achieve the goal. So after unstacking, the arm is holding black_block_2. Then putdown black_block_2. 

But wait, after that, red_block_1 would be clear. So that's the goal. So the plan would be:

1. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
2. putdown green_block_1
3. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
4. putdown black_block_2

Wait, but let's check the constraints. Are there any constraints mentioned? The user says the plan must abide by the constraints, but the problem statement doesn't list any additional constraints beyond the usual preconditions. So as long as each action's preconditions are met, it's okay.

Let me check each step:

1. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2: Preconditions are green_block_1 is on black_block_2, green_block_1 is clear (yes, because the initial state says green_block_1 is clear), and the arm is empty (yes). So this is valid.

2. putdown green_block_1: The arm is holding green_block_1 after unstacking, so this is valid. Now green_block_1 is on the table, clear.

3. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1: Now, after step 2, the arm is empty. black_block_2 is on red_block_1, and since we removed green_block_1, black_block_2 is now clear. So unstack is allowed. This action would pick up black_block_2.

4. putdown black_block_2: The arm is holding it, so putdown is valid. Now, black_block_2 is on the table, and red_block_1 is clear. So the goal is achieved.

That seems like a four-step plan. Is there a shorter way? Let me think. Suppose instead of putting down green_block_1, could we stack it somewhere else? For example, stack it on another block that's clear. But in the initial state, black_block_1 is clear on the table, red_block_1 has black_block_2 on top, orange_block_1 has brown_block_1 and green_block_2. The other blocks on the table are black_block_1, red_block_1, orange_block_1. After removing green_block_1, could we stack it on black_block_1? But to stack, the target block must be clear. black_block_1 is clear. So after unstacking green_block_1, we could stack it on black_block_1. Then we wouldn't need a putdown and then a pickup. Wait, but stacking would immediately free the arm. So maybe:

1. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
2. stack green_block_1 black_block_1
3. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
4. putdown black_block_2

But wait, after stacking green_block_1 on black_block_1, black_block_1 is no longer clear. So then if we need to do something else, but maybe not. Let's see: the goal is only to clear red_block_1, so stacking green_block_1 on another block is fine. But does that save steps? The original plan was four steps. If we stack instead of putdown, the steps would be same number. So same length. So either way, the plan is four steps. But perhaps the optimal plan is four steps either way. Wait, but maybe there's a way to do it in fewer steps.

Wait, what's the initial state:

Blocks:

- black_block_1 on table, clear.

- red_block_1 has black_block_2 on it, which has green_block_1 on it (which is clear).

- orange_block_1 has brown_block_1, which has green_block_2, which is clear.

Other blocks: red_block_1 is on table, black_block_2 is on red_block_1, green_block_1 on black_block_2. So the tower is red_block_1 <- black_block_2 <- green_block_1.

To make red_block_1 clear, need to remove black_block_2. But to remove black_block_2, need to first remove green_block_1.

So steps: unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2, then put it down. Then unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1, put it down. That's four steps. Alternatively, after unstacking green_block_1, stack it on another block. But the other blocks that are clear are black_block_1, orange_block_1 (wait, orange_block_1 has brown_block_1 on it, which has green_block_2. So orange_block_1 is not clear. The clear blocks are black_block_1, green_block_1 (initially, but after unstacking, black_block_1 is clear, and after putting down green_block_1, it's clear. So stacking green_block_1 on black_block_1 would require that black_block_1 is clear, which it is. Then step 2 would be stack green_block_1 black_block_1. Then step 3 is unstack black_block_2 red_block_1, step 4 putdown. Still four steps. So same length. So both plans are valid and optimal. Which one is better? The problem says to provide an optimal plan, which is as short as possible. Since both are four steps, either is acceptable. But perhaps the user expects the first approach. Let me check the constraints again. Are there any constraints that might affect this choice? The problem statement says "a valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then there's no constraints listed. Wait, the user might have pasted the problem incorrectly. Let me check the original input.

Looking back: the user's problem says "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then there's nothing after. That's probably a formatting error. But assuming there are no additional constraints, both approaches are valid. So either plan is correct. However, in the Blocksworld domain, stacking a block on another may not be necessary if the goal doesn't require it, so putting down on the table might be simpler, but since both are four steps, both are optimal. 

Therefore, the answer should be a four-step plan. Let's write it as:

unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
putdown green_block_1
unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
putdown black_block_2

Alternatively, stacking green_block_1 on black_block_1 would also work, but the steps are same. Let's go with the first approach since it's more straightforward.
