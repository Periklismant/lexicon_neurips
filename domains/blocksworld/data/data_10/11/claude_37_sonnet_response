Let's analyze the problem step by step:

**Initial state:**
- black_block_1 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2
- brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- green_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1
- black_block_1 is clear
- green_block_1 is clear
- green_block_2 is clear
- not holding any block

Visually, the configuration looks like:
```
       green_block_1    green_block_2
            |                |
       black_block_2     brown_block_1
            |                |
       red_block_1      orange_block_1
            |                |
         table            table       black_block_1
                                          |
                                        table
```

**Goal state:**
- red_block_1 is clear

So, we need to remove any blocks that might be on top of red_block_1.

**Constraints:**
1. At some point, we are holding black_block_2.
2. Before holding black_block_2, either green_block_2 isn't clear or we are holding orange_block_1.
3. At some point, either black_block_2 is on green_block_2 or red_block_1 is not on the table.
4. green_block_1 is never on the table.
5. At some point, either orange_block_1 is not on the table or green_block_1 is on red_block_1.
6. At some point, black_block_2 is on black_block_1 and green_block_2 is on the table.
7. At some point, we are holding red_block_1.
8. At some point, there's a block on orange_block_1.
9. If there's a block on orange_block_1, then at some point after, either there's a block on black_block_1 or a block on green_block_2.
10. At some point, black_block_2 is not on red_block_1.
11. Before black_block_2 is not on red_block_1, brown_block_1 is on the table.
12. At some point, black_block_1 is not on red_block_1 (this is trivially satisfied in the initial state, since black_block_1 is on the table).
13. If black_block_1 is not on red_block_1, then at some point after, we are holding black_block_1.
14. At some point, brown_block_1 is on the table and we are holding orange_block_1.

Let's think about how to approach this:

1. First we need to make sure red_block_1 is clear. In the initial state, black_block_2 and green_block_1 are above red_block_1, so we need to remove them.
2. We must satisfy all constraints. 

I'll work on a plan that achieves the goal while satisfying all constraints.

First, let's sketch a basic plan to clear red_block_1:
1. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2.
2. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.

However, this doesn't satisfy the many constraints. Let's work through the constraints methodically.

Constraint 11 says that before black_block_2 is not on red_block_1, brown_block_1 must be on the table. Currently, brown_block_1 is on orange_block_1, so we need to move it to the table first.

Constraint 14 says at some point, brown_block_1 is on the table and we are holding orange_block_1. So, we might need to:
1. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1.
3. Put brown_block_1 on the table.
4. Pickup orange_block_1.

Constraint 6 says at some point, black_block_2 is on black_block_1 and green_block_2 is on the table. So, we need to:
1. Move green_block_2 to the table.
2. Move black_block_2 onto black_block_1.

Let's try to construct a plan:

1. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Putdown green_block_2 (on the table).
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Putdown brown_block_1 (on the table).
5. Pickup orange_block_1. (Satisfies the "holding orange_block_1" part of constraint 14, and combined with step 4, satisfies all of constraint 14.)
6. Putdown orange_block_1 (or maybe use it in a different way? I'll decide later).
7. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2.
8. Stack green_block_1 on another block (to ensure it's never on the table, as per constraint 4).
9. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. (Now, red_block_1 is clear, but we need to ensure all other constraints are met.)

But, this doesn't satisfy constraint 2, which says before holding black_block_2, either green_block_2 isn't clear or we are holding orange_block_1. We've already held orange_block_1 in step 5, so that should be fine.

Constraint 3 says at some point, either black_block_2 is on green_block_2 or red_block_1 is not on the table. Let's make black_block_2 on green_block_2 at some point.

Constraint 5 says at some point, either orange_block_1 is not on the table or green_block_1 is on red_block_1. We've already had orange_block_1 not on the table when we picked it up.

Constraint 7 says at some point, we are holding red_block_1. Let's make sure that happens.

Constraint 8 and 9 say at some point, there's a block on orange_block_1, and if there's a block on orange_block_1, then at some point after, either there's a block on black_block_1 or a block on green_block_2. In the initial state, brown_block_1 is on orange_block_1, so we need to ensure that after brown_block_1 is on orange_block_1, at some point, there's a block on black_block_1 or on green_block_2.

Constraint 12 and 13 say at some point, black_block_1 is not on red_block_1, and after that, at some point, we are holding black_block_1. black_block_1 is already not on red_block_1 in the initial state, so we need to ensure we are holding black_block_1 at some point.

Let's revise the plan:

1. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Putdown green_block_2 (on the table). (Contributes to constraint 6)
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Putdown brown_block_1 (on the table). (Satisfies the "brown_block_1 is on the table" part of constraint 14)
5. Pickup orange_block_1. (Satisfies the "holding orange_block_1" part of constraint 14, and combined with step 4, satisfies all of constraint 14. Also contributes to constraint 5)
6. Stack orange_block_1 on green_block_2. (Making green_block_2 not clear, which contributes to constraint 2)
7. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2.
8. Stack green_block_1 on brown_block_1. (Ensuring green_block_1 is never on the table, as per constraint 4)
9. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. (This satisfies constraint 10. The condition from constraint 11 is already met by step 4)
10. Stack black_block_2 on black_block_1. (Satisfies part of constraint 6, and combined with step 2, satisfies all of constraint 6)
11. Pickup red_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 7)
12. Putdown red_block_1. (Now, red_block_1 is clear, but we need to ensure all other constraints are met)
13. Pickup black_block_1. (This will make black_block_2 fall, which might not be allowed. Let me rethink)

Actually, there's a problem here. If we pick up black_block_1 when black_block_2 is on it, black_block_2 would "fall". This is not a valid action in the blocksworld.

Let's revise again:

1. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Putdown green_block_2 (on the table). (Contributes to constraint 6)
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Putdown brown_block_1 (on the table). (Satisfies the "brown_block_1 is on the table" part of constraint 14)
5. Pickup orange_block_1. (Satisfies the "holding orange_block_1" part of constraint 14, and combined with step 4, satisfies all of constraint 14. Also contributes to constraint 5)
6. Stack orange_block_1 on green_block_2. (Making green_block_2 not clear, which contributes to constraint 2)
7. Pickup black_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 13, since black_block_1 is not on red_block_1 in the initial state)
8. Stack black_block_1 on orange_block_1. (Ensuring there's a block on orange_block_1 after it's placed on green_block_2, which contributes to constraint 9)
9. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2.
10. Stack green_block_1 on brown_block_1. (Ensuring green_block_1 is never on the table, as per constraint 4)
11. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. (This satisfies constraint 10. The condition from constraint 11 is already met by step 4)
12. Stack black_block_2 on red_block_1. (Wait, this doesn't make sense for the goal. Let me rethink)

This isn't working out as expected. Let me reconsider the problem and the constraints again. The goal is to have red_block_1 clear, which means removing black_block_2 and green_block_1 from it.

Ah, I should note that in the initial state, green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2, not directly on red_block_1. Let me rethink:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2.
2. Stack green_block_1 onto a block (not the table, as per constraint 4).
3. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. (Now, red_block_1 is clear)

But I need to ensure all constraints are met.

I'll start afresh.

Initial configuration:
```
       green_block_1    green_block_2
            |                |
       black_block_2     brown_block_1
            |                |
       red_block_1      orange_block_1
            |                |
         table            table       black_block_1
                                          |
                                        table
```

Let's enumerate the constraints again:
1. At some point, hold black_block_2.
2. Before holding black_block_2, either green_block_2 isn't clear or hold orange_block_1.
3. At some point, either black_block_2 is on green_block_2 or red_block_1 is not on the table.
4. green_block_1 is never on the table.
5. At some point, either orange_block_1 is not on the table or green_block_1 is on red_block_1.
6. At some point, black_block_2 is on black_block_1 and green_block_2 is on the table.
7. At some point, hold red_block_1.
8. At some point, there's a block on orange_block_1.
9. If there's a block on orange_block_1, then at some point after, either there's a block on black_block_1 or a block on green_block_2.
10. At some point, black_block_2 is not on red_block_1.
11. Before black_block_2 is not on red_block_1, brown_block_1 is on the table.
12. At some point, black_block_1 is not on red_block_1 (always true in the initial state).
13. If black_block_1 is not on red_block_1, then at some point after, hold black_block_1.
14. At some point, brown_block_1 is on the table and hold orange_block_1.

I need to devise a plan that:
1. Makes red_block_1 clear.
2. Satisfies all constraints.

Let me try to find a path that satisfies the constraints in a logical order.

First, I need to get brown_block_1 on the table (constraint 11) before removing black_block_2 from red_block_1 (constraint 10).

1. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Putdown green_block_2 (on the table). (Contributes to constraint 6)
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Putdown brown_block_1 (on the table). (Satisfies constraint 11, contributes to constraint 14)

Now I can act on orange_block_1:

5. Pickup orange_block_1. (Combined with step 4, satisfies constraint 14. Also satisfies constraint 5 because orange_block_1 is not on the table.)

I need to make sure green_block_2 isn't clear or I'm holding orange_block_1 before holding black_block_2 (constraint 2). Since I'm holding orange_block_1 right now, I've satisfied that.

Now, I need to ensure that after orange_block_1 has a block on it, either black_block_1 or green_block_2 has a block on it (constraint 9). Let's stack orange_block_1 for now:

6. Stack orange_block_1 on green_block_2. (Making green_block_2 not clear, which ensures constraint 9 is in progress)

I need to hold black_block_1 at some point (constraint 13):

7. Pickup black_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 13)

Now, I need to ensure black_block_2 is on black_block_1 and green_block_2 is on the table at some point (constraint 6). The second part is already done. For the first part, I need to move black_block_2 onto black_block_1:

8. Stack black_block_1 on orange_block_1. (Satisfying constraint 9)

Now, I need to address the goal of making red_block_1 clear, which means removing black_block_2 and green_block_1 from it:

9. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2.
10. Stack green_block_1 on brown_block_1. (Ensuring green_block_1 is never on the table, as per constraint 4)
11. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 10)

I need to ensure black_block_2 is on black_block_1 at some point (constraint 6) and that I hold black_block_2 at some point (constraint 1):

12. Stack black_block_2 on black_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 6 along with step 2)

Now, I also need to ensure that I hold red_block_1 at some point (constraint 7) and that either black_block_2 is on green_block_2 or red_block_1 is not on the table at some point (constraint 3):

13. Pickup red_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 7 and constraint 3 because red_block_1 is not on the table)
14. Putdown red_block_1. (Goal: red_block_1 is clear)

But hey, I still haven't satisifed constraint 1, which says at some point I need to be holding black_block_2. Also I forgot that in step 8, black_block_1 is no longer on the table, thus in step 12 I can't stack black_block_2 there. Let me rethink the plan.

Actually, scratch that. Let's think about constraint 6: "At some point, black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1, green_block_2 is on the table." We can't just have black_block_2 on black_block_1 at one point and green_block_2 on the table at another. They both need to be true simultaneously.

Let me revisit the plan.

Actually, one interesting detail is that the problem statement says "there is no block on top of red_block_1, i.e., red_block_1 is clear." It's not explicit that this has to happen at the end of the plan, but I'm assuming that's the intent.

So let's be methodical. The goal is:
- red_block_1 is clear.

Here's a new approach:

1. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Putdown green_block_2 (on the table). (Contributes to constraint 6)
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Putdown brown_block_1 (on the table). (Satisfies constraint 11 and contributes to constraint 14)
5. Pickup orange_block_1. (Combined with step 4, satisfies constraint 14. Also satisfies constraint 5 because orange_block_1 is not on the table.)
6. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2. (Since we're holding orange_block_1, this also ensures constraint 2 is satisfied)
7. Stack green_block_1 on brown_block_1. (Ensuring green_block_1 is never on the table, as per constraint 4)
8. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 10. The prerequisite for constraint 11 is already satisfied by step 4)
9. Putdown orange_block_1. (Needed to free up the hand)
10. Pickup black_block_2. (Satisfies constraint 1)
11. Stack black_block_2 on black_block_1. (Together with step 2, satisfies constraint 6)
12. Stack orange_block_1 on green_block_2. (Brown_block_1 had a block on orange_block_1 at the start, so constraint 8 is satisfied. This ensures constraint 9 is satisfied by having a block on green_block_2.)
13. Pickup red_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 7 and constraint 3 because red_block_1 is not on the table)
14. Putdown red_block_1. (Goal: red_block_1 is clear)
15. Pickup black_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 13)
16. Putdown black_block_1.

Wait, at step 11, I'm stacking black_block_2 on black_block_1, but I forget that black_block_1 is on the table. So, black_block_2 is on black_block_1 and green_block_2 is on the table, which satisfies constraint 6.

Let's double-check the constraints:
1. Hold black_block_2. Satisfied in step 10.
2. Before holding black_block_2, either green_block_2 isn't clear or hold orange_block_1. Satisfied in step 5 by holding orange_block_1.
3. Either black_block_2 is on green_block_2 or red_block_1 is not on the table. Satisfied in step 13 by having red_block_1 not on the table.
4. green_block_1 is never on the table. Satisfied by ensuring green_block_1 doesn't go on the table.
5. Either orange_block_1 is not on the table or green_block_1 is on red_block_1. Satisfied in step 5 by having orange_block_1 not on the table.
6. black_block_2 is on black_block_1 and green_block_2 is on the table. Satisfied in step 11 by having black_block_2 on black_block_1 and in step 2 by having green_block_2 on the table.
7. Hold red_block_1. Satisfied in step 13.
8. There's a block on orange_block_1. Satisfied in the initial state by having brown_block_1 on orange_block_1.
9. If there's a block on orange_block_1, then at some point after, either there's a block on black_block_1 or a block on green_block_2. Satisfied in step 12 by having a block on green_block_2.
10. black_block_2 is not on red_block_1. Satisfied in step 8.
11. Before black_block_2 is not on red_block_1, brown_block_1 is on the table. Satisfied in step 4.
12. black_block_1 is not on red_block_1. Always satisfied in the initial state.
13. If black_block_1 is not on red_block_1, then hold black_block_1. Satisfied in step 15.
14. brown_block_1 is on the table and hold orange_block_1. Satisfied in steps 4 and 5.

Upon further reflection, it seems like I'm satisfying all constraints with this plan. The goal is also achieved because red_block_1 is clear in the final state.

Let me finalize the plan:

1. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Putdown green_block_2 (on the table).
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Putdown brown_block_1 (on the table).
5. Pickup orange_block_1.
6. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2.
7. Stack green_block_1 on brown_block_1.
8. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.
9. Putdown orange_block_1.
10. Pickup black_block_2.
11. Stack black_block_2 on black_block_1.
12. Stack orange_block_1 on green_block_2.
13. Pickup red_block_1.
14. Putdown red_block_1.
15. Pickup black_block_1.
16. Putdown black_block_1.

Actually, the step 15 may be invalid because black_block_1 has black_block_2 on it. 

In fact, in steps 11-16, there are complications. In step 11, I'm stacking black_block_2 on black_block_1, which is fine. But in step 15, I'm trying to pick up black_block_1, which now has black_block_2 on it. This is not a valid action, as I would need to unstack black_block_2 first.

I need to revisit the plan again. The key issue is with constraint 13, which says if black_block_1 is not on red_block_1, then at some point after, hold black_block_1. Since black_block_1 is not on red_block_1 in the initial state, I need to make sure I hold black_block_1 at some point.

I'm seeing inconsistencies with multiple constraints. Let's rethink:

1. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Putdown green_block_2 (on the table).
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Putdown brown_block_1 (on the table).
5. Pickup orange_block_1.
6. Pickup black_block_1. (But I'm already holding orange_block_1, so this is invalid)

Ok let's rethink more carefully.

1. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Putdown green_block_2 (on the table).
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Putdown brown_block_1 (on the table).
5. Pickup orange_block_1. (Combined with step 4, satisfies constraint 14. Also satisfies constraint 5 because orange_block_1 is not on the table.)
6. Putdown orange_block_1. (To free up the hand)
7. Pickup black_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 13)
8. Stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1. (or any other block to free up the hand)
9. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2. (This ensures constraint 2 is satisfied because we're holding orange_block_1 in step 5.)
10. Stack green_block_1 on orange_block_1. (Ensuring green_block_1 is never on the table, as per constraint 4. Also, there's a block on orange_block_1, which satisfies constraint 8.)
11. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 10. The prerequisite for constraint 11 is already satisfied by step 4)
12. Stack black_block_2 on green_block_2. (Together with step 2, satisfies constraint 6. Also, after orange_block_1 has a block on it, a block is on green_block_2, which satisfies constraint 9.)
13. Pickup red_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 7 and constraint 3 because red_block_1 is not on the table)
14. Putdown red_block_1. (Goal: red_block_1 is clear)

Wait, there's an inconsistency at step 12. I say I'm stacking black_block_2 on green_block_2, but at the same time, I say this satisfies constraint 6 (black_block_2 is on black_block_1 and green_block_2 is on the table). But if I stack black_block_2 on green_block_2, it can't be on black_block_1.

My plan still has inconsistencies. 

Ok let's try yet again. 

It's worth noting we need to handle all the constraints. It's also worth understanding what constraint 6 says in particular: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: The following conditions are all true: "black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1", "green_block_2 is on the table"""

This implies that there needs to be at least one state where both conditions are simultaneously true.

Let's think about the action plan again:

1. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Putdown green_block_2 (on the table). 
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Putdown brown_block_1 (on the table). (Satisfies constraint 11. Steps 4 and 5 together will satisfy constraint 14.)
5. Pickup orange_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 5 and, with step 4, constraint 14.)
6. Stack orange_block_1 on green_block_2. (Green_block_2 is not clear, which helps with constraint 2. Also, it helps with constraint 9.)
7. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2.
8. Stack green_block_1 on brown_block_1. (Ensuring green_block_1 is never on the table, as per constraint 4.)
9. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 10. The condition from constraint 11 is already satisfied.)
10. Pickup black_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 13.)
11. Putdown black_block_1. (To get ready for constraint 6.)
12. Stack black_block_2 on black_block_1. (Together with green_block_2 on the table, this satisfies constraint 6. Also, satisfies constraint 1 as we're holding black_block_2.)
13. Pickup red_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 7 and constraint 3 because red_block_1 is not on the table.)
14. Putdown red_block_1. (Goal: red_block_1 is clear.)

Ok, I think I have a conflict at step 12. We can't say steps 11-12 satisfies constraint 1 (hold black_block_2) because we are not actually holding black_block_2; we are stacking it. Let's consider this constraint more carefully: we need to physically hold black_block_2 at some point during our plan.

Actually, sorry, I'm confused. I looked back and I'm still not stacking black_block_2 but putdown it, which doesn't work for constraint 6. 

Let me start fresh one more time:

1. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Putdown green_block_2 (on the table).
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Putdown brown_block_1 (on the table). (With step 5, satisfies constraint 14.)
5. Pickup orange_block_1. (Satisfies constraints 5 and, with step 4, constraint 14.)
6. Stack orange_block_1 on green_block_2. (Green_block_2 is not clear, which helps with constraint 2. Also, it helps with constraint 9.)
7. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2.
8. Stack green_block_1 on brown_block_1. (Ensuring green_block_1 is never on the table, as per constraint 4.)
9. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. (This satisfies constraint 10 and constraint 1 as we're now holding black_block_2. The condition from constraint 11 is already satisfied.)
10. Stack black_block_2 on black_block_1. (Together with green_block_2 on the table, this satisfies constraint 6.)
11. Pickup red_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 7 and constraint 3 because red_block_1 is not on the table.)
12. Putdown red_block_1. (Goal: red_block_1 is clear.)

But, wait, where in this plan am I satisfying constraint 13? Constraint 13 says if black_block_1 is not on red_block_1, then at some point after, hold black_block_1. black_block_1 is not on red_block_1 in the initial state, so I need to hold black_block_1 at some point.

I realize there's a fundamental issue: I can't pick up black_block_1 if it has black_block_2 on it. But I also need to ensure black_block_2 is on black_block_1 at some point (constraint 6). 

I think I need to split these actions: first, pick up black_block_1, and then later, ensure black_block_2 is on black_block_1.

Let's try again:

1. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Putdown green_block_2 (on the table).
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Putdown brown_block_1 (on the table). (With step 5, satisfies constraint 14.)
5. Pickup orange_block_1. (Satisfies constraints 5 and, with step 4, constraint 14.)
6. Stack orange_block_1 on green_block_2. (Green_block_2 is not clear, which helps satisfy constraint 2. Also, it helps with constraint 9.)
7. Pickup black_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 13.)
8. Stack black_block_1 on orange_block_1. (Continuing to satisfy constraint 9 by having blocks on either black_block_1 or green_block_2.)
9. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2.
10. Stack green_block_1 on brown_block_1. (Ensuring green_block_1 is never on the table, as per constraint 4.)
11. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. (This satisfies constraint 10 and, since we're now holding black_block_2, constraint 1. The condition from constraint 11 is already satisfied.)
12. Stack black_block_2 on black_block_1. (Together with green_block_2 on the table, this satisfies constraint 6.)
13. Pickup red_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 7 and constraint 3 because red_block_1 is not on the table.)
14. Putdown red_block_1. (Goal: red_block_1 is clear.)

Hmm, I went back and read constraint 9 and realized there's a subtlety. It's saying that if there's a block on orange_block_1 at state s, then at state s or later, either there's a block on black_block_1 or a block on green_block_2. In our initial state, brown_block_1 is on orange_block_1, and green_block_2 is on brown_block_1. So, we initially have a state where there's a block on orange_block_1 (brown_block_1), and at that same state, there's a block on brown_block_1 (green_block_2). 

However, this doesn't directly satisfy constraint 9 because it doesn't say "there's a block on brown_block_1." It says "there's a block on black_block_1 or a block on green_block_2." So, I need to ensure that after there's a block on orange_block_1, at some point, either there's a block on black_block_1 or a block on green_block_2. I can satisify this by having a block on green_block_2.

Actually, I think I'm overthinking this. Let's start again. Here's a cleaner, more straightforward plan:

1. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Putdown green_block_2 (on the table).
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Putdown brown_block_1 (on the table). (With step 5, satisfies constraint 14.)
5. Pickup orange_block_1. (Satisfies constraints 5 and, with step 4, constraint 14.)
6. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1. (Now, there's a block on black_block_1, which helps with constraint 9 for the initial state.)
7. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2.
8. Stack green_block_1 on brown_block_1. (Ensuring green_block_1 is never on the table, as per constraint 4.)
9. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. (This satisfies constraint 10 and, since we're now holding black_block_2, constraint 1. The condition from constraint 11 is already satisfied.)
10. Stack black_block_2 on orange_block_1. (Together with green_block_2 on the table, this satisfies constraint 6.)
11. Pickup orange_block_1. (Wait, this is invalid because black_block_2 is on orange_block_1. Let me reconsider.)

Hmm, in step 10, I'm getting confused. I say "Stack black_block_2 on orange_block_1" and "(Together with green_block_2 on the table, this satisfies constraint 6)." But constraint 6 requires black_block_2 to be on black_block_1. There's a contradiction there.

I think I'm mixing up the blocks. Let's be very explicit.

Constraint 6 says: "At some point, black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1, green_block_2 is on the table."

So, I need to have black_block_2 on top of black_block_1.

Let's try again:

1. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Putdown green_block_2 (on the table).
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Putdown brown_block_1 (on the table). (With step 5, satisfies constraint 14.)
5. Pickup orange_block_1. (Satisfies constraints 5 and, with step 4, constraint 14.)
6. Stack orange_block_1 on green_block_2. (Now, green_block_2 is not clear, which ensures we've satisfied the condition for constraint 2. Also, there's now a block on green_block_2, which helps with constraint 9 for the initial state.)
7. Pickup black_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 13.)
8. Stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1. (Just parking black_block_1 somewhere.)
9. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2.
10. Stack green_block_1 on black_block_1. (Ensuring green_block_1 is never on the table, as per constraint 4.)
11. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. (This satisfies constraint 10 and, since we're now holding black_block_2, constraint 1. The condition from constraint 11 is already satisfied.)
12. Unstack orange_block_1 from green_block_2. (To be able to move black_block_1 for constraint 6.)
13. Putdown orange_block_1 (on the table). (Just to get it out of the way.)
14. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_1. (To be able to move black_block_1.)
15. Stack green_block_1 on orange_block_1. (Ensuring green_block_1 is never on the table, as per constraint 4. Also, there's now a block on orange_block_1, which ensures constraint 8.)
16. Unstack black_block_1 from brown_block_1. (To move it for constraint 6.)
17. Putdown black_block_1 (on the table). (For constraint 6.)
18. Stack black_block_2 on black_block_1. (Together with green_block_2 on the table, satisfies constraint 6.)
19. Pickup red_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 7 and constraint 3 because red_block_1 is not on the table.)
20. Putdown red_block_1. (Goal: red_block_1 is clear.)

I think this plan works! Let's double-check the constraints:
1. Hold black_block_2. Satisfied in step 11.
2. Before holding black_block_2, either green_block_2 isn't clear or hold orange_block_1. Satisfied in step 5 by holding orange_block_1 and in step 6 by having orange_block_1 on green_block_2.
3. Either black_block_2 is on green_block_2 or red_block_1 is not on the table. Satisfied in step 19 by having red_block_1 not on the table.
4. green_block_1 is never on the table. Satisfied by ensuring green_block_1 is always on another block.
5. Either orange_block_1 is not on the table or green_block_1 is on red_block_1. Satisfied in step 5 by having orange_block_1 not on the table.
6. black_block_2 is on black_block_1 and green_block_2 is on the table. Satisfied in step 18 by having black_block_2 on black_block_1 and green_block_2 on the table.
7. Hold red_block_1. Satisfied in step 19.
8. There's a block on orange_block_1. Satisfied in step 15 by having green_block_1 on orange_block_1. Also, initially, brown_block_1 is on orange_block_1.
9. If there's a block on orange_block_1, then at some point after, either there's a block on black_block_1 or a block on green_block_2. Satisfied in step 6 by having a block on green_block_2 after the initial state, and in step 18 by having a block on black_block_1 after step 15.
10. black_block_2 is not on red_block_1. Satisfied in step 11.
11. Before black_block_2 is not on red_block_1, brown_block_1 is on the table. Satisfied in step 4.
12. black_block_1 is not on red_block_1. Satisfied in the initial state.
13. If black_block_1 is not on red_block_1, then at some point after, hold black_block_1. Satisfied in step 7.
14. brown_block_1 is on the table and hold orange_block_1. Satisfied in steps 4 and 5.

I believe this plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal.

1. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Putdown green_block_2 (on the table).
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Putdown brown_block_1 (on the table).
5. Pickup orange_block_1.
6. Stack orange_block_1 on green_block_2.
7. Pickup black_block_1.
8. Stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1.
9. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2.
10. Stack green_block_1 on black_block_1.
11. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.
12. Unstack orange_block_1 from green_block_2.
13. Putdown orange_block_1.
14. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_1.
15. Stack green_block_1 on orange_block_1.
16. Unstack black_block_1 from brown_block_1.
17. Putdown black_block_1.
18. Stack black_block_2 on black_block_1.
19. Pickup red_block_1.
20. Putdown red_block_1.

I think this is becoming too complex. Let me see if there's a simpler solution that meets all constraints.

One observation is that the goal state is simply "red_block_1 is clear." In the initial state, red_block_1 has black_block_2 on it, and black_block_2 has green_block_1 on it. So, at the very basic level, I need to remove green_block_1 and black_block_2 from red_block_1.

Let's simplify. It seems like many of the constraints can be satisfied with a short sequence of actions. Let's see:

1. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Putdown green_block_2 (on the table). (For constraint 6.)
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Putdown brown_block_1 (on the table). (For constraint 11 and part of constraint 14.)
5. Pickup orange_block_1. (With step 4, satisfies constraint 14. Also, for constraint 5.)
6. Stack orange_block_1 on green_block_2. (For constraint 2 to ensure green_block_2 isn't clear.)
7. Pickup black_block_1. (For constraint 13.)
8. Putdown black_block_1. (To free up the hand.)
9. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2.
10. Stack green_block_1 on brown_block_1. (For constraint 4 to ensure green_block_1 is never on the table.)
11. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. (For constraint 10. Also, for constraint 1 as we're now holding black_block_2.)
12. Stack black_block_2 on black_block_1. (With step 2, satisfies constraint 6.)
13. Pickup red_block_1. (For constraint 7 and constraint 3 as red_block_1 is not on the table.)
14. Putdown red_block_1. (Goal: red_block_1 is clear.)

I think this plan is more concise and satisfies all the constraints. Let's double-check:
1. Hold black_block_2. Satisfied in step 11.
2. Before holding black_block_2, either green_block_2 isn't clear or hold orange_block_1. Satisfied in step 5 and 6.
3. Either black_block_2 is on green_block_2 or red_block_1 is not on the table. Satisfied in step 13.
4. green_block_1 is never on the table. Satisfied.
5. Either orange_block_1 is not on the table or green_block_1 is on red_block_1. Satisfied in step 5.
6. black_block_2 is on black_block_1 and green_block_2 is on the table. Satisfied in steps 2 and 12.
7. Hold red_block_1. Satisfied in step 13.
8. There's a block on orange_block_1. Satisfied in the initial state.
9. If there's a block on orange_block_1, then at some point after, either there's a block on black_block_1 or a block on green_block_2. Satisfied in step 6 for the initial state.
10. black_block_2 is not on red_block_1. Satisfied in step 11.
11. Before black_block_2 is not on red_block_1, brown_block_1 is on the table. Satisfied in step 4.
12. black_block_1 is not on red_block_1. Satisfied in the initial state.
13. If black_block_1 is not on red_block_1, then at some point after, hold black_block_1. Satisfied in step 7.
14. brown_block_1 is on the table and hold orange_block_1. Satisfied in steps 4 and 5.

Looks like all constraints are satisfied with this plan. Here's the final plan:

1. Unstack green_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Putdown green_block_2.
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. Putdown brown_block_1.
5. Pickup orange_block_1.
6. Stack orange_block_1 on green_block_2.
7. Pickup black_block_1.
8. Putdown black_block_1.
9. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2.
10. Stack green_block_1 on brown_block_1.
11. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.
12. Stack black_block_2 on black_block_1.
13. Pickup red_block_1.
14. Putdown red_block_1.
