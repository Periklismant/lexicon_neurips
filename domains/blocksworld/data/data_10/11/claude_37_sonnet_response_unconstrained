Let's analyze the problem:

We have a blocksworld problem with 7 blocks: black_block_1, red_block_1, black_block_2, orange_block_1, green_block_1, brown_block_1, and green_block_2.

The initial state is as follows:
- black_block_1 is on the table and is clear
- red_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2 and is clear
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- green_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1 and is clear
- The robotic arm is not holding any block

The goal is to make red_block_1 clear. In the initial state, red_block_1 has black_block_2 on top of it, and green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2. So, to make red_block_1 clear, we need to remove the blocks on top of it.

Let's plan how to achieve this. We need to:
1. First, unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2
2. Then, unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1

Let's work through this step by step:

1. Initial State:
   - black_block_1 is on the table and clear
   - red_block_1 is on the table with black_block_2 on top
   - black_block_2 has green_block_1 on top
   - orange_block_1 is on the table with brown_block_1 on top
   - brown_block_1 has green_block_2 on top
   - green_block_1 is clear
   - green_block_2 is clear
   - The arm is not holding anything

2. Let's unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2:
   
   Action: unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
   
   This is valid because:
   - green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2
   - green_block_1 is clear
   - The arm is not holding anything
   
   After this action:
   - The arm is holding green_block_1
   - black_block_2 is clear
   - green_block_1 is no longer on top of black_block_2

3. Now we need to place green_block_1 somewhere. One option is to place it on the table:
   
   Action: putdown green_block_1
   
   After this:
   - green_block_1 is on the table and clear
   - The arm is not holding anything
   - black_block_2 is still clear and on top of red_block_1

4. Now we can unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1:
   
   Action: unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
   
   This is valid because:
   - black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
   - black_block_2 is clear
   - The arm is not holding anything
   
   After this:
   - The arm is holding black_block_2
   - red_block_1 is clear
   - black_block_2 is no longer on top of red_block_1

5. Finally, we need to place black_block_2 somewhere. We can place it on the table:
   
   Action: putdown black_block_2
   
   After this:
   - black_block_2 is on the table and clear
   - The arm is not holding anything
   - red_block_1 is clear

With this, we've achieved our goal of making red_block_1 clear. 

Here's the plan:
1. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
2. putdown green_block_1
3. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
4. putdown black_block_2

This is a valid and optimal plan for the given problem.

Let's double-check the entire plan:

1. Initial State:
   - black_block_1 is on the table and clear
   - red_block_1 is on the table with black_block_2 on top
   - black_block_2 has green_block_1 on top
   - orange_block_1 is on the table with brown_block_1 on top
   - brown_block_1 has green_block_2 on top
   - green_block_1 is clear
   - green_block_2 is clear
   - The arm is not holding anything

2. Action: unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
   
   After this:
   - black_block_1 is on the table and clear
   - red_block_1 is on the table with black_block_2 on top
   - black_block_2 is clear
   - orange_block_1 is on the table with brown_block_1 on top
   - brown_block_1 has green_block_2 on top
   - The arm is holding green_block_1
   - green_block_2 is clear

3. Action: putdown green_block_1
   
   After this:
   - black_block_1 is on the table and clear
   - red_block_1 is on the table with black_block_2 on top
   - black_block_2 is clear
   - orange_block_1 is on the table with brown_block_1 on top
   - brown_block_1 has green_block_2 on top
   - green_block_1 is on the table and clear
   - green_block_2 is clear
   - The arm is not holding anything

4. Action: unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
   
   After this:
   - black_block_1 is on the table and clear
   - red_block_1 is on the table and clear
   - orange_block_1 is on the table with brown_block_1 on top
   - brown_block_1 has green_block_2 on top
   - green_block_1 is on the table and clear
   - green_block_2 is clear
   - The arm is holding black_block_2

5. Action: putdown black_block_2
   
   After this:
   - black_block_1 is on the table and clear
   - red_block_1 is on the table and clear
   - black_block_2 is on the table and clear
   - orange_block_1 is on the table with brown_block_1 on top
   - brown_block_1 has green_block_2 on top
   - green_block_1 is on the table and clear
   - green_block_2 is clear
   - The arm is not holding anything

That meets the goal of having red_block_1 clear. The plan is valid and optimal, with a length of 4 actions.

But wait, let me think about this more carefully. In the initial state it says:
"black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1"
"green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2"

So, it does seem like red_block_1 has two blocks on top of it: black_block_2 and on top of black_block_2 is green_block_1.

Let's re-examine the initial state structure:

- black_block_1 is on the table and is clear
- red_block_1 is on the table 
- black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1 (so red_block_1 is not clear)
- green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2 (so black_block_2 is not clear)
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 (so orange_block_1 is not clear)
- green_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1 (so brown_block_1 is not clear)

In the initial state, we have:
"there is no block on top of black_block_1, i.e., black_block_1 is clear"
"there is no block on top of green_block_1, i.e., green_block_1 is clear"
"there is no block on top of green_block_2, i.e., green_block_2 is clear"

So, of all the blocks, only black_block_1, green_block_1, and green_block_2, are clear initially.

The structures (from top to bottom) are:
1. black_block_1 on the table
2. green_block_1 on black_block_2 on red_block_1 on the table
3. green_block_2 on brown_block_1 on orange_block_1 on the table

To achieve the goal of making red_block_1 clear, we need to remove black_block_2 from it. But first, we need to remove green_block_1 from black_block_2.

So, the plan should be:
1. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
2. putdown green_block_1
3. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
4. putdown black_block_2

The plan is the same as I had before. Let's check if there's any other consideration I've missed.

Actually, I'm noticing that the problem statement doesn't explicitly state that green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2. It says:
"green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2"

So it is correct. Let me double-check the rest of the initial state to ensure I understand the structure correctly:

"black_block_1 is on the table"
"red_block_1 is on the table"
"black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1"
"orange_block_1 is on the table"
"green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2"
"brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1"
"green_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1"

And the clear blocks:
"there is no block on top of black_block_1, i.e., black_block_1 is clear"
"there is no block on top of green_block_1, i.e., green_block_1 is clear"
"there is no block on top of green_block_2, i.e., green_block_2 is clear"

Confirming the structure again (from top to bottom):
1. black_block_1 on the table
2. green_block_1 on black_block_2 on red_block_1 on the table
3. green_block_2 on brown_block_1 on orange_block_1 on the table

This is consistent with the clear blocks mentioned, and with the goal of making red_block_1 clear. So, my plan still stands:

1. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
2. putdown green_block_1
3. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
4. putdown black_block_2

This is a valid and optimal plan for the given problem. Let's finalize this plan.

The solution is:
```
unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
putdown green_block_1
unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
putdown black_block_2
```

As specified, I'm supposed to delineate the plan with one top line and one bottom line containing only 3 "`" characters, so the final answer should be:

```
unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
putdown green_block_1
unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
putdown black_block_2
```
