Let me analyze the problem and construct a plan to bring about the goal "blue_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1".

First, let's identify the initial state:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table (clear)
- blue_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
- red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 (clear)
- green_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 (clear)
- The arm is not holding any block

The goal is:
- blue_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1

Looking at the initial state, I notice that blue_block_1 is at the bottom of a stack with blue_block_2, red_block_1, and purple_block_1 (in that order from bottom to top). To achieve the goal, I need to move blue_block_1 on top of purple_block_1.

The current stack structure is:
```
purple_block_1
red_block_1
blue_block_2
blue_block_1
```

So I need to disassemble this stack, and then place blue_block_1 on top of purple_block_1.

Let's plan the steps:

1. First, I need to clear blue_block_1 by removing all blocks on top of it:
   - Unstack purple_block_1 from red_block_1
   - Unstack red_block_1 from blue_block_2
   - Unstack blue_block_2 from blue_block_1

2. Then I can pick up blue_block_1 from the table

3. Finally, stack blue_block_1 on top of purple_block_1

Let's develop the detailed plan:

1. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1
   - This makes purple_block_1 held and red_block_1 clear

2. putdown purple_block_1
   - This puts purple_block_1 on the table, it's clear, and the arm is empty

3. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2
   - This makes red_block_1 held and blue_block_2 clear

4. putdown red_block_1
   - This puts red_block_1 on the table, it's clear, and the arm is empty

5. unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1
   - This makes blue_block_2 held and blue_block_1 clear

6. putdown blue_block_2
   - This puts blue_block_2 on the table, it's clear, and the arm is empty

7. pickup blue_block_1
   - This makes blue_block_1 held and no longer on the table

8. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1
   - This places blue_block_1 on top of purple_block_1, achieving the goal

Let me double-check this plan:

Start state:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table (clear)
- blue_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
- red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2

- The arm is not holding any block

This plan achieves the goal of "blue_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1". It takes 8 steps.

Let me reread the original state description to make sure I understood it correctly:

Original state:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
- red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- green_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- There is no block on top of black_block_1, i.e., black_block_1 is clear
- There is no block on top of purple_block_1, i.e., purple_block_1 is clear
- There is no block on top of green_block_1, i.e., green_block_1 is clear
- You are not holding any block

Wait, I misunderstood the original state. Let me redraw the stacks:

Stack 1:
```
purple_block_1 (clear)
red_block_1
blue_block_2
blue_block_1
table
```

Stack 2:
```
black_block_1 (clear)
table
```

Stack 3:
```
green_block_1 (clear)
grey_block_1
table
```

Now, let's revise the plan:

1. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1
   - This makes purple_block_1 held and red_block_1 clear

2. putdown purple_block_1
   - This puts purple_block_1 on the table, it's clear, and the arm is empty

3. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2
   - This makes red_block_1 held and blue_block_2 clear

4. putdown red_block_1
   - This puts red_block_1 on the table, it's clear, and the arm is empty

5. unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1
   - This makes blue_block_2 held and blue_block_1 clear

6. putdown blue_block_2
   - This puts blue_block_2 on the table, it's clear, and the arm is empty

7. pickup blue_block_1
   - This makes blue_block_1 held and no longer on the table

8. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1
   - This places blue_block_1 on top of purple_block_1, achieving the goal

Let me verify this plan:

Start state:
- Stack 1: blue_block_1 (on table), blue_block_2 (on blue_block_1), red_block_1 (on blue_block_2), purple_block_1 (on red_block_1, clear)

- Stack 5: red_block_1 (on table, clear)
- Stack 6: blue_block_2 (on table, clear)
- The arm is empty

The goal "blue_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1" is achieved.

But I need to check if there's a more optimal plan. Let me consider:

Hmm, we need to get blue_block_1 from the bottom of the stack and put it on top of purple_block_1, which is initially at the top of the same stack. So we definitely need to disassemble the entire stack.

Let's try an alternative:

1. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1
2. putdown purple_block_1
3. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2
4. putdown red_block_1
5. unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1
6. putdown blue_block_2
7. pickup blue_block_1
8. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1

This is the same plan I had before, and I can't find a shorter valid plan. So the optimal plan takes 8 steps.

Let me review it one more time to ensure correctness:

1. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1
   - Preconditions: purple_block_1 is clear, purple_block_1 is on top of red_block_1, arm is empty
   - Effects: arm is holding purple_block_1, red_block_1 is clear, purple_block_1 is no longer on red_block_1

2. putdown purple_block_1
   - Preconditions: arm is holding purple_block_1
   - Effects: purple_block_1 is on the table, purple_block_1 is clear, arm is empty

3. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2
   - Preconditions: red_block_1 is clear, red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2, arm is empty
   - Effects: arm is holding red_block_1, blue_block_2 is clear, red_block_1 is no longer on blue_block_2

4. putdown red_block_1
   - Preconditions: arm is holding red_block_1
   - Effects: red_block_1 is on the table, red_block_1 is clear, arm is empty

5. unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1
   - Preconditions: blue_block_2 is clear, blue_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1, arm is empty
   - Effects: arm is holding blue_block_2, blue_block_1 is clear, blue_block_2 is no longer on blue_block_1

6. putdown blue_block_2
   - Preconditions: arm is holding blue_block_2
   - Effects: blue_block_2 is on the table, blue_block_2 is clear, arm is empty

7. pickup blue_block_1
   - Preconditions: blue_block_1 is clear, blue_block_1 is on the table, arm is empty
   - Effects: arm is holding blue_block_1, blue_block_1 is no longer on the table

8. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1
   - Preconditions: arm is holding blue_block_1, purple_block_1 is clear
   - Effects: blue_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1, blue_block_1 is clear, purple_block_1 is not clear, arm is empty

All preconditions and effects are correctly accounted for at each step. The plan is valid and optimal.

So the final optimal plan is:
1. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1
2. putdown purple_block_1
3. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2
4. putdown red_block_1
5. unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1
6. putdown blue_block_2
7. pickup blue_block_1
8. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1
