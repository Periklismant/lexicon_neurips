Let's first understand the initial state:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
- red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- green_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- black_block_1 is clear
- purple_block_1 is clear
- green_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

This can be visualized as:
```
         purple_block_1       green_block_1
               |                    |
         red_block_1          grey_block_1
               |
         blue_block_2      black_block_1
               |
         blue_block_1
         (on table)         (on table)     (on table)
```

Our goal is to have blue_block_1 on top of purple_block_1.

Let's analyze the constraints:

1. "purple_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in every state.
2. "you are holding purple_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
3. If "you are holding purple_block_1" holds in some state s, then "black_block_1 is not on the table" must hold at s or at some later state.
4. "blue_block_1 is on top of green_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
5. "blue_block_2 is not on the table" must hold in every state.
6. "blue_block_1 is clear" must hold in at least one state.
7. If "blue_block_1 is clear" holds in some state, then "grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2" must have held in an earlier state.
8. "you are holding blue_block_2" must hold in at least one state.
9. If "you are holding blue_block_2" holds in some state s, then "black_block_1 is not clear OR black_block_1 is not on the table" must hold at s or at some later state.
10. "red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2" must hold in at least one state.
11. If "red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2" holds in some state s, then "grey_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 OR grey_block_1 is clear" must hold at s or at some later state.
12. "you are holding red_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
13. If "you are holding red_block_1" holds, then "you are holding black_block_1" must have held in an earlier state.
14. "red_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in every state.
15. "grey_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in at least one state.

Now, let's plan:

1. Currently, blue_block_1 is at the bottom of a stack, and we need it to be on top of purple_block_1. So we'll need to unstack everything above blue_block_1 first.
2. According to constraint 7, we need to have grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2 at some point before blue_block_1 is clear.
3. According to constraint 13, we need to hold black_block_1 before holding red_block_1.
4. We need to ensure that purple_block_1 never touches the table.
5. We need to ensure that blue_block_2 never touches the table.
6. We need to ensure that red_block_1 never touches the table.

Let's construct a plan:

First, let's handle constraint 13, which requires us to hold black_block_1 before holding red_block_1.

1. pickup black_block_1 (black_block_1 is clear and on the table initially)
2. putdown black_block_1 (this satisfies the requirement for holding black_block_1 before holding red_block_1)

Let's continue by unstacking blocks to get blue_block_1 clear:

3. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1 (purple_block_1 is clear initially)
4. stack purple_block_1 black_block_1 (this satisfies constraint 3 because black_block_1 is no longer on the table due to purple_block_1 being stacked on it)

This also satisfies constraint 2, as we've held purple_block_1. Now, let's continue unstacking:

5. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2 (red_block_1 is clear after step 4)

This satisfies constraint 12, as we've held red_block_1. Now, we need to make sure red_block_1 doesn't touch the table (constraint 14). Let's place it somewhere:

6. stack red_block_1 green_block_1 (green_block_1 is clear initially)

Now, let's handle constraint 7. We need to have grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2 before blue_block_1 is clear:

7. unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1 (green_block_1 is now clear after step 6)
8. stack green_block_1 purple_block_1 (green_block_1 is being held, purple_block_1 is clear after step 4)
9. unstack grey_block_1 table (grey_block_1 is now clear after step 7)

This also satisfies constraint 15, as grey_block_1 is not on the table after being unstacked. For constraint 7 and constraint 11, let's place grey_block_1 on top of red_block_1:

10. stack grey_block_1 red_block_1 (grey_block_1 is being held, red_block_1 is clear after step 6)

Now, let's unstack blue_block_2 from blue_block_1:

11. unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1 (blue_block_2 is clear after step 5)

This satisfies constraint 8, as we've held blue_block_2. For constraint 9, we need to ensure that black_block_1 is not clear or not on the table. It's not on the table after step 4, so we're good.

Now, we have constraint 10, which requires red_block_1 to be on top of blue_block_2 at some point. Let's rearrange some blocks:

12. stack blue_block_2 black_block_1 (blue_block_2 is being held, black_block_1 has purple_block_1 on it, which has green_block_1 on it, so this won't work without rearranging more blocks)

Wait, this doesn't work as black_block_1 isn't clear. Let's adjust our plan:

Let me restart from where we are right now:

After step 11, we have:
- blue_block_1 is clear and on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_1 on top, which has green_block_1 on top
- blue_block_2 is being held (unstacked from blue_block_1)
- red_block_1 is on the table with grey_block_1 on top

For constraint 9, we need to ensure that black_block_1 is not clear or not on the table. It's not clear after step 8, so we're good.

For constraint 10, we need red_block_1 to be on top of blue_block_2. Let's rearrange:

12. stack blue_block_2 green_block_1 (blue_block_2 is being held, green_block_1 is clear after step 8)
13. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1 (grey_block_1 is clear after step 10)
14. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2 (grey_block_1 is being held, blue_block_2 is clear after step 12)

This satisfies constraint 7, as grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2 before blue_block_1 is clear.

15. unstack red_block_1 table (red_block_1 is clear after step 13)
16. stack red_block_1 blue_block_2 (red_block_1 is being held, grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2, which isn't clear, so this won't work)

Wait, this doesn't work either. Let's adjust again:

Let me restart from where we are right now:

After step 11, we have:
- blue_block_1 is clear and on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_1 on top, which has green_block_1 on top
- blue_block_2 is being held (unstacked from blue_block_1)
- red_block_1 is on the table with grey_block_1 on top

Wait, I'm not sure my representation is right. Let's backtrack a bit:

After step 10, I had:
- blue_block_1 on the table with blue_block_2 on top
- black_block_1 on the table with purple_block_1 on top, which has green_block_1 on top
- red_block_1 on the table with grey_block_1 on top

Then step 11 was to unstack blue_block_2 from blue_block_1, so after step 11, the configuration is:
- blue_block_1 is clear and on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_1 on top, which has green_block_1 on top
- red_block_1 is on the table with grey_block_1 on top
- the arm is holding blue_block_2

Now, for constraint 10, we need red_block_1 to be on top of blue_block_2 at some point. But first, we need to place blue_block_2 somewhere, as the arm is holding it:

12. stack blue_block_2 green_block_1 (blue_block_2 is being held, green_block_1 is clear after step 10)

For constraint 9, we need to ensure that black_block_1 is not clear or not on the table. It's not clear since it has purple_block_1 on top, so we're good.

Now, to have red_block_1 on top of blue_block_2 (constraint 10):

13. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1 (grey_block_1 is clear after step 10)
14. putdown grey_block_1

This satisfies constraint 11, as grey_block_1 is clear after being put down.

15. unstack red_block_1 table (red_block_1 is clear after step 13)
16. stack red_block_1 blue_block_2 (red_block_1 is being held, blue_block_2 is clear after step 12)

This satisfies constraint 10.

Now, for constraint 7, we need to stack grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2 before making blue_block_1 clear:

17. pickup grey_block_1 (grey_block_1 is clear and on the table after step 14)
18. stack grey_block_1 red_block_1 (grey_block_1 is being held, red_block_1 is clear after step 16)

Now, to satisfy constraint 4, we need to have blue_block_1 on top of green_block_1 at some point:

19. unstack green_block_1 purple_block_1 (green_block_1 is clear after step 12)
20. putdown green_block_1
21. pickup blue_block_1 (blue_block_1 is clear and on the table after step 11)
22. stack blue_block_1 green_block_1 (blue_block_1 is being held, green_block_1 is clear after step 20)

This satisfies constraint 4. Now, for our final goal, we need to place blue_block_1 on top of purple_block_1:

23. unstack blue_block_1 green_block_1 (blue_block_1 is clear after step 22)
24. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1 (blue_block_1 is being held, purple_block_1 is clear after step 19)

This achieves our goal: blue_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1.

But, let's check all the constraints:

1. "purple_block_1 is not on the table" - Satisfied, as purple_block_1 is on top of black_block_1 throughout the plan.
2. "you are holding purple_block_1" - Satisfied in step 3.
3. If "you are holding purple_block_1", then "black_block_1 is not on the table" must hold after - Not satisfied because in step 3, the arm is holding purple_block_1, but black_block_1 remains on the table.

Hmm, let's adjust our plan:

Actually, I think I'm confused about constraint 3. It states: "If expression 'you are holding purple_block_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'black_block_1 is not on the table' must hold at s or at some state after s."

So, it means that after the arm holds purple_block_1, at some point (possibly later), black_block_1 should not be on the table.

So, let's update our plan:

1. pickup black_block_1 (black_block_1 is clear and on the table initially)
2. putdown black_block_1 (this satisfies the requirement for holding black_block_1 before holding red_block_1)
3. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1 (purple_block_1 is clear initially)
4. stack purple_block_1 black_block_1 (this ensures black_block_1 is not on the table, satisfying constraint 3)

The rest of the plan can proceed as before. Let's check all the constraints again:

Hmm, I think I'm still missing something. Let me go through the constraints one by one and ensure each is satisfied in our plan.

Before I do that, I need to fix my representation. In step 4, if we stack purple_block_1 on black_block_1, then black_block_1 is still on the table. What this step does is make black_block_1 not clear.

Let's start again with the initial state:

```
         purple_block_1       green_block_1
               |                    |
         red_block_1          grey_block_1
               |
         blue_block_2      black_block_1
               |
         blue_block_1
         (on table)         (on table)     (on table)
```

First, from constraint 13, we need to hold black_block_1 before holding red_block_1:

1. pickup black_block_1 (black_block_1 is clear and on the table initially)
2. stack black_block_1 green_block_1 (now black_block_1 is not on the table, but on top of green_block_1)

For constraint 7, we need to have grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2 before blue_block_1 is clear. Also, for constraint 2, we need to hold purple_block_1 at some point.

3. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1 (purple_block_1 is clear initially)

For constraint 3, since we're now holding purple_block_1, we need to ensure black_block_1 is not on the table. We've already done that in step 2.

4. stack purple_block_1 black_block_1 (purple_block_1 is being held, black_block_1 is clear after step 2)
5. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2 (red_block_1 is clear after step 3)

This satisfies constraint 12, as we're holding red_block_1.

For constraint 7, let's rearrange blocks to have grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2:

6. stack red_block_1 green_block_1 (red_block_1 is being held, green_block_1 has black_block_1 and purple_block_1 on it, so it's not clear)

Wait, this doesn't work. Let's adjust:

6. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1 (red_block_1 is being held, grey_block_1 is clear after step 5)
7. unstack green_block_1 table (green_block_1 has blocks stacked on it, so it's not clear)

That doesn't work either. I'm getting confused with the state. Let me try to keep track of the state better:

Initial state:
```
         purple_block_1       green_block_1
               |                    |
         red_block_1          grey_block_1
               |
         blue_block_2      black_block_1
               |
         blue_block_1
         (on table)         (on table)     (on table)
```

After step 1, the arm is holding black_block_1.
After step 2, black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1, and the arm is empty.
After step 3, the arm is holding purple_block_1, and red_block_1 is clear.
After step 4, purple_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, and the arm is empty.
After step 5, the arm is holding red_block_1, and blue_block_2 is clear.

But wait, I missed something. In step 2, we can't stack black_block_1 on green_block_1 because green_block_1 is not clear (it has grey_block_1 on top).

Let's actually start again and be very careful about the state at each step:

Initial state:
```
         purple_block_1       green_block_1
               |                    |
         red_block_1          grey_block_1
               |
         blue_block_2      black_block_1
               |
         blue_block_1
         (on table)         (on table)     (on table)
```

Looking at the constraints again, constraint 5 says "blue_block_2 is not on the table" must hold in every state. So we need to ensure blue_block_2 never touches the table.

Also, let's reverse our planning approach. Let's work backward from the goal (blue_block_1 on top of purple_block_1) and see what we need to achieve.

For the goal, we need blue_block_1 to be clear and we need purple_block_1 to be clear. Currently, blue_block_1 has blue_block_2 on it, which has red_block_1 on it, which has purple_block_1 on it. So we need to unstack this tower.

But, constraint 7 says that if blue_block_1 is clear, then there must be an earlier state where grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2. So, at some point before blue_block_1 is clear, we need to have grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2.

Let's plan carefully:

1. unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1 (green_block_1 is clear initially)
2. putdown green_block_1 (green_block_1 is being held)
3. unstack grey_block_1 table (grey_block_1 is clear after step 1)

This satisfies constraint 15, as grey_block_1 is not on the table after being unstacked.

4. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1 (purple_block_1 is clear initially)

This satisfies constraint 2, as we're holding purple_block_1.

Now, for constraint 3, since we're holding purple_block_1, we need to ensure black_block_1 is not on the table at some future point:

5. stack purple_block_1 green_block_1 (purple_block_1 is being held, green_block_1 is clear after step 2)
6. pickup black_block_1 (black_block_1 is clear initially)
7. stack black_block_1 purple_block_1 (black_block_1 is being held, purple_block_1 is clear after step 5)

This satisfies constraint 3, as black_block_1 is not on the table after step 7.

8. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2 (red_block_1 is clear after step 4)

This satisfies constraint 12, as we're holding red_block_1. For constraint 13, we need to have held black_block_1 before holding red_block_1, which is satisfied due to step 6.

For constraint 10, red_block_1 is already on top of blue_block_2 in the initial state. To satisfy constraint 14, we need to ensure red_block_1 never touches the table:

9. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1 (red_block_1 is being held, grey_block_1 is clear after step 3)

For constraint 11, since red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2 in the initial state, we need to ensure grey_block_1 is either on top of red_block_1 or clear. Grey_block_1 is clear after step 3, so this is satisfied.

Now, for constraint 7, we need to have grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_2 before blue_block_1 is clear. Currently, blue_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1, and grey_block_1 is on the table with red_block_1 on top. So we need to rearrange:

10. unstack grey_block_1 table (we've already done this in step 3, so there's an error in my sequencing)

Let me restart with correct sequencing:

1. unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1 (green_block_1 is clear initially)
2. putdown green_block_1 (green_block_1 is being held)
3. unstack grey_block_1 table (grey_block_1 is clear after step 1)
4. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1 (purple_block_1 is clear initially)
5. stack purple_block_1 green_block_1 (purple_block_1 is being held, green_block_1 is clear after step 2)
6. pickup black_block_1 (black_block_1 is clear initially)
7. stack black_block_1 purple_block_1 (black_block_1 is being held, purple_block_1 is clear after step 5)
8. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2 (red_block_1 is clear after step 4)
9. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1 (red_block_1 is being held, grey_block_1 is clear after step 3)
10. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2 (grey_block_1 is not clear after step 9, so this won't work)

Wait, there's an error in step 9. Let's restart the planning:

1. unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1 (green_block_1 is clear initially)
2. putdown green_block_1 (green_block_1 is being held)
3. unstack grey_block_1 table (grey_block_1 is clear after step 1)
4. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1 (purple_block_1 is clear initially)
5. stack purple_block_1 green_block_1 (purple_block_1 is being held, green_block_1 is clear after step 2)
6. pickup black_block_1 (black_block_1 is clear initially)
7. stack black_block_1 purple_block_1 (black_block_1 is being held, purple_block_1 is clear after step 5)
8. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2 (grey_block_1 is being held, blue_block_2 is clear in the initial state)

This satisfies constraint 7, as grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2 before blue_block_1 is clear.

9. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2 (red_block_1 is clear after step 4, but blue_block_2 has grey_block_1 on it after step 8, so this won't work)

Wait, there's an error in step 8. Let's be even more careful:

From the initial state:
```
         purple_block_1       green_block_1
               |                    |
         red_block_1          grey_block_1
               |
         blue_block_2      black_block_1
               |
         blue_block_1
         (on table)         (on table)     (on table)
```

1. unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1 (green_block_1 is clear initially)
2. putdown green_block_1 (green_block_1 is being held)
3. unstack grey_block_1 table (grey_block_1 is clear after step 1)
4. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1 (purple_block_1 is clear initially)
5. stack purple_block_1 green_block_1 (purple_block_1 is being held, green_block_1 is clear after step 2)
6. pickup black_block_1 (black_block_1 is clear initially)
7. stack black_block_1 purple_block_1 (black_block_1 is being held, purple_block_1 is clear after step 5)

After step 7, the state is:
```
            black_block_1
                |
           purple_block_1
                |
           green_block_1          grey_block_1 (in hand)
           
         red_block_1
               |
         blue_block_2
               |
         blue_block_1
         (on table)         (on table)     (on table)
```

8. stack grey_block_1 red_block_1 (grey_block_1 is being held, red_block_1 is clear after step 4)

After step 8, the state is:
```
            black_block_1          grey_block_1
                |                      |
           purple_block_1          red_block_1
                |                      |
           green_block_1          blue_block_2
                                       |
                                  blue_block_1
           (on table)             (on table)
```

For constraint 8, we need to hold blue_block_2 at some point:

9. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1 (grey_block_1 is clear after step 8)
10. putdown grey_block_1 (grey_block_1 is being held)
11. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2 (red_block_1 is clear after step 9)
12. putdown red_block_1 (red_block_1 is being held)
13. unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1 (blue_block_2 is clear after step 11)

This satisfies constraint 8, as we're holding blue_block_2.

For constraint 9, since we're holding blue_block_2, we need to ensure black_block_1 is either not clear or not on the table. Black_block_1 is not on the table after step 7, so this is satisfied.

14. stack blue_block_2 grey_block_1 (blue_block_2 is being held, grey_block_1 is clear after step 10)

For constraint 10, red_block_1 was on top of blue_block_2 in the initial state, so it's satisfied.

15. pickup red_block_1 (red_block_1 is clear and on the table after step 12)
16. stack red_block_1 blue_block_2 (red_block_1 is being held, blue_block_2 is clear after step 14)

For constraint 11, since red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2 in the initial state and after step 16, we need to ensure grey_block_1 is either on top of red_block_1 or clear. Grey_block_1 is clear after step 10, so this is satisfied for the initial state. For step 16, grey_block_1 is no longer clear (it has blue_block_2 on it), and it's not on top of red_block_1. This might be a problem.

Let me rethink the planning for constraints 10 and 11. Perhaps we should ensure that when red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2, grey_block_1 is either on top of red_block_1 or clear.

In the initial state, grey_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1, so it should be clear for constraint 11. But initially, grey_block_1 has green_block_1 on it, so it's not clear.

Ok, let me really think this constraint through. Constraint 11 says:
"If expression 'red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: grey_block_1 is on top of red_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear' must hold at s or at some state after s."

So, if at any point red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2, then at that point or afterwards, either grey_block_1 should be on top of red_block_1 or grey_block_1 should be clear.

Initially, red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2, so at this point or later, we must satisfy the condition about grey_block_1. Initially, grey_block_1 has green_block_1 on it, so it's not clear. Therefore, to satisfy the constraint, we must later have grey_block_1 on top of red_block_1 or make it clear.

In our plan, grey_block_1 becomes clear after step 9, so the constraint is satisfied.

Now, for constraint 4, we need to have blue_block_1 on top of green_block_1 at some point:

17. pickup blue_block_1 (blue_block_1 is clear and on the table after step 13)
18. stack blue_block_1 green_block_1 (blue_block_1 is being held, green_block_1 is clear after step 5)

This satisfies constraint 4.

Finally, for the goal, we need to place blue_block_1 on top of purple_block_1:

19. unstack blue_block_1 green_block_1 (blue_block_1 is clear after step 18)
20. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1 (blue_block_1 is being held, purple_block_1 has black_block_1 on it, so it's not clear)

Actually, there's an error in step 20. Let's check the state after step 18:

```
            black_block_1     blue_block_1       red_block_1
                |                |                  |
           purple_block_1    green_block_1      blue_block_2
                                                    |
                                                grey_block_1
           
           (on table)        (on table)         (on table)
```

Now, for the goal, we need to place blue_block_1 on top of purple_block_1, but purple_block_1 is not clear (it has black_block_1 on it). So we need to unstack black_block_1 first:

19. unstack black_block_1 purple_block_1 (black_block_1 is clear after step 7)
20. putdown black_block_1 (black_block_1 is being held)
21. unstack blue_block_1 green_block_1 (blue_block_1 is clear after step 18)
22. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1 (blue_block_1 is being held, purple_block_1 is clear after step 19)

This achieves our goal: blue_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1.

Let's check all the constraints again:
1. "purple_block_1 is not on the table" - Satisfied, as purple_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 throughout the plan.
2. "you are holding purple_block_1" - Satisfied in step 4.
3. If "you are holding purple_block_1", then "black_block_1 is not on the table" must hold after - Satisfied, as black_block_1 is not on the table after step 7.
4. "blue_block_1 is on top of green_block_1" - Satisfied in step 18.
5. "blue_block_2 is not on the table" - Satisfied, as blue_block_2 is either on top of blue_block_1 or on top of grey_block_1 throughout the plan.
6. "blue_block_1 is clear" - Satisfied in step 17.
7. If "blue_block_1 is clear", then "grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2" must have held earlier - Satisfied, as grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2 in step 8, before blue_block_1 becomes clear in step 13.
8. "you are holding blue_block_2" - Satisfied in step 13.
9. If "you are holding blue_block_2", then "black_block_1 is not clear OR black_block_1 is not on the table" must hold after - Satisfied, as black_block_1 is not on the table after step 7.
10. "red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2" - Satisfied in the initial state and again in step 16.
11. If "red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2", then "grey_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 OR grey_block_1 is clear" must hold after - Satisfied, as grey_block_1 becomes clear after step 9, which is after the initial state where red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2. For step 16, the constraint is not satisfied, as grey_block_1 is not clear (it has blue_block_2 on it) and it's not on top of red_block_1.

Wait, there's a potential problem with constraint 11. Let me reconsider the plan for constraints 10 and 11.

If we're satisfying constraint 10 by having red_block_1 on top of blue_block_2 in the initial state, then for constraint 11, we need to ensure that at that point or afterwards, grey_block_1 is either on top of red_block_1 or clear. Initially, grey_block_1 has green_block_1 on it, so it's not clear. So to satisfy the constraint, we must later have grey_block_1 on top of red_block_1 or make it clear.

In our plan, grey_block_1 becomes clear after step 9, so the constraint is satisfied for the initial state.

The problem might lie with step 16, where we again place red_block_1 on top of blue_block_2. At this point, grey_block_1 is not clear (it has blue_block_2 on it) and it's not on top of red_block_1. So, after step 16, we need to make sure grey_block_1 is either on top of red_block_1 or clear.

There's a circular dependency here: we're trying to put red_block_1 on top of blue_block_2, but blue_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1. So grey_block_1 can never be clear or on top of red_block_1 if red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2.

Let's adjust our plan to satisfy constraint 11:

First, let's ensure grey_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 to satisfy the constraint for the initial state.

The plan I've outlined has 22 steps:
1. unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1
2. putdown green_block_1
3. unstack grey_block_1 table
4. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1
5. stack purple_block_1 green_block_1
6. pickup black_block_1
7. stack black_block_1 purple_block_1
8. stack grey_block_1 red_block_1
9. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1
10. putdown grey_block_1
11. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2
12. putdown red_block_1
13. unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1
14. stack blue_block_2 grey_block_1
15. pickup red_block_1
16. stack red_block_1 blue_block_2
17. pickup blue_block_1
18. stack blue_block_1 green_block_1
19. unstack black_block_1 purple_block_1
20. putdown black_block_1
21. unstack blue_block_1 green_block_1
22. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1

For step 16, I'm placing red_block_1 on top of blue_block_2, which was on top of grey_block_1. According to constraint 11, at this point or later, grey_block_1 should be either on top of red_block_1 or clear, which is not possible since it's under blue_block_2.

Let's adjust our plan to satisfy constraint 11:

After step 15, we have:
```
            black_block_1                     red_block_1 (in hand)
                |                 
           purple_block_1      blue_block_2
                |                  |
           green_block_1      grey_block_1
           
           (on table)         (on table)     blue_block_1 (on table)
```

For constraint 11, instead of placing red_block_1 on top of blue_block_2, we need to ensure grey_block_1 is either on top of red_block_1 or clear. Since blue_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1, we can't make grey_block_1 clear. So, we need to restructure the blocks to have grey_block_1 on top of red_block_1.

Let's update our plan from step 15:

15. stack red_block_1 blue_block_1 (red_block_1 is being held, blue_block_1 is clear after step 13)
16. unstack blue_block_2 grey_block_1 (blue_block_2 is clear after step 15, but grey_block_1 is not clear, this won't work)

Actually, let's think of an alternate way to satisfy constraint 10 and 11:

We need red_block_1 to be on top of blue_block_2 at some point, and if that is the case, we need grey_block_1 to be on top of red_block_1 or clear at that time or afterwards. In the initial state, red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2 but grey_block_1 is not clear and not on top of red_block_1. So, after the initial state, we need to satisfy the condition about grey_block_1.

Perhaps we should try to satisfy this constraint by placing red_block_1 on top of blue_block_2 again, but in a different configuration where the constraint for grey_block_1 is also satisfied.

Let's go back to step 13, where we have:
```
            black_block_1          
                |                      
           purple_block_1          red_block_1
                |                      
           green_block_1          blue_block_2 (in hand)
                                       
                                  grey_block_1
           (on table)             (on table)     blue_block_1 (on table)
```

For constraint 10, we need red_block_1 to be on top of blue_block_2. For constraint 11, if red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2, then grey_block_1 should be either on top of red_block_1 or clear. In the initial state, grey_block_1 is not clear and not on top of red_block_1. So, after the initial state, we need to satisfy the condition about grey_block_1.

Let's change our approach and try to satisfy both constraints by working forward:

14. putdown blue_block_2 (blue_block_2 is being held, we can't place it on grey_block_1 as before due to the constraint)
15. pickup red_block_1 (red_block_1 is clear and on the table after step 12)
16. stack red_block_1 blue_block_2 (red_block_1 is being held, blue_block_2 is clear after step 14)
17. pickup grey_block_1 (grey_block_1 is clear and on the table after step 10)
18. stack grey_block_1 red_block_1 (grey_block_1 is being held, red_block_1 is clear after step 16)

This satisfies constraint 10 (red_block_1 on top of blue_block_2 in step 16) and constraint 11 (grey_block_1 on top of red_block_1 in step 18).

19. pickup blue_block_1 (blue_block_1 is clear and on the table after step 13)
20. stack blue_block_1 green_block_1 (blue_block_1 is being held, green_block_1 is clear after step 5)

This satisfies constraint 4 (blue_block_1 on top of green_block_1).

21. unstack black_block_1 purple_block_1 (black_block_1 is clear after step 7)
22. putdown black_block_1 (black_block_1 is being held)
23. unstack blue_block_1 green_block_1 (blue_block_1 is clear after step 20)
24. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1 (blue_block_1 is being held, purple_block_1 is clear after step 21)

This achieves our goal: blue_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1.

Let's check all the constraints again:
1. "purple_block_1 is not on the table" - Satisfied, as purple_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 throughout the plan.
2. "you are holding purple_block_1" - Satisfied in step 4.
3. If "you are holding purple_block_1", then "black_block_1 is not on the table" must hold after - Satisfied, as black_block_1 is not on the table after step 7.
4. "blue_block_1 is on top of green_block_1" - Satisfied in step 20.
5. "blue_block_2 is not on the table" - Not satisfied, as blue_block_2 is on the table after step 14.

Ok, error with constraint 5. Let's adjust our plan from step 13:

14. stack blue_block_2 black_block_1 (blue_block_2 is being held, black_block_1 is clear after step 7)

This ensures blue_block_2 is never on the table.

15. pickup red_block_1 (red_block_1 is clear and on the table after step 12)
16. stack red_block_1 blue_block_2 (red_block_1 is being held, blue_block_2 is clear after step 14)
17. pickup grey_block_1 (grey_block_1 is clear and on the table after step 10)
18. stack grey_block_1 red_block_1 (grey_block_1 is being held, red_block_1 is clear after step 16)
19. pickup blue_block_1 (blue_block_1 is clear and on the table after step 13)
20. stack blue_block_1 green_block_1 (blue_block_1 is being held, green_block_1 is clear after step 5)
21. unstack black_block_1 purple_block_1 (black_block_1 has blue_block_2 on it in step 14, so it's not clear, this won't work)

Wait, I might have an issue with my state tracking. Let me be more explicit:

After step 13, blue_block_2 is in the arm, and the state is:
```
            black_block_1          
                |                      
           purple_block_1          
                |                      
           green_block_1          grey_block_1
                                       
                                  
           (on table)             (on table)     blue_block_1 (on table)
                                                 red_block_1 (on table)
```

In step 14, we stack blue_block_2 on black_block_1. After step 14, the state is:
```
         blue_block_2
              |
            black_block_1          
                |                      
           purple_block_1          
                |                      
           green_block_1          grey_block_1
                                       
                                  
           (on table)             (on table)     blue_block_1 (on table)
                                                 red_block_1 (on table)
```

Now, in step 15 and 16, we pick up red_block_1 and stack it on blue_block_2. After step 16, the state is:
```
         red_block_1
              |
         blue_block_2
              |
            black_block_1          
                |                      
           purple_block_1          
                |                      
           green_block_1          grey_block_1
                                       
                                  
           (on table)             (on table)     blue_block_1 (on table)
```

In step 17 and 18, we pick up grey_block_1 and stack it on red_block_1. After step 18, the state is:
```
         grey_block_1
              |
         red_block_1
              |
         blue_block_2
              |
            black_block_1          
                |                      
           purple_block_1          
                |                      
           green_block_1          
                                       
                                  
           (on table)                   blue_block_1 (on table)
```

In step 19 and 20, we pick up blue_block_1 and stack it on green_block_1. After step 20, the state is:
```
         grey_block_1              blue_block_1
              |                       |
         red_block_1               green_block_1
              |
         blue_block_2
              |
            black_block_1          
                |                      
           purple_block_1          
                                     
                                  
           (on table)                   
```

For the goal, we need to place blue_block_1 on top of purple_block_1. But there's an issue: to do this, we need to unstack black_block_1 from purple_block_1, but black_block_1 has blue_block_2, red_block_1, and grey_block_1 on top of it. We need to unstack the tower on black_block_1 first.

Let's adjust our approach. I'm going to introduce a new constraint satisfaction approach. Actually, let me think if there's a more efficient way to satisfy all the constraints and achieve the goal:

For constraint 1, purple_block_1 should never be on the table.
For constraint 5, blue_block_2 should never be on the table.
For constraint 14, red_block_1 should never be on the table.

This suggests that these blocks should always be on top of another block or being held. Let's use this to guide our planning:

Working from the initial state, let's satisfy constraint 7 (if blue_block_1 is clear, then grey_block_1 has been on top of blue_block_2 earlier):

1. unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1 (green_block_1 is clear initially)
2. putdown green_block_1 (green_block_1 is being held)
3. unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1 (purple_block_1 is clear initially)
4. stack purple_block_1 green_block_1 (purple_block_1 is being held, green_block_1 is clear after step 2)
5. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2 (red_block_1 is clear after step 3)
6. stack red_block_1 purple_block_1 (red_block_1 is being held, purple_block_1 is clear after step 4)
7. unstack grey_block_1 table (grey_block_1 is clear after step 1)
8. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2 (grey_block_1 is being held, blue_block_2 is clear after step 5)
9. pickup black_block_1 (black_block_1 is clear initially)
10. stack black_block_1 red_block_1 (black_block_1 is being held, red_block_1 is clear after step 6)
11. unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1 (blue_block_2 has grey_block_1 on it after step 8, so it's not clear, this won't work)

Let me readjust our approach. I think I need a clearer approach to satisfy all the constraints and achieve the goal.
