Let me analyze this problem:

We have 7 blocks:
- blue_block_1
- grey_block_1
- white_block_1
- white_block_2
- blue_block_2
- yellow_block_1
- brown_block_1

Initial state:
- The blocks are arranged as follows:
  - white_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1, which is on top of blue_block_1, which is on the table
  - white_block_2 is on the table
  - blue_block_2 is on the table
  - yellow_block_1 is on the table
  - brown_block_1 is on the table
- The clear blocks are: white_block_1, white_block_2, blue_block_2, yellow_block_1, brown_block_1
- The robot arm is not holding any block

Goal:
- The robot arm is holding yellow_block_1

To achieve this goal, we need to pick up yellow_block_1 from the table. Let me check if we can perform that action:

Action: pickup yellow_block_1
Preconditions:
- yellow_block_1 is clear (satisfied, as stated in the initial state)
- yellow_block_1 is on the table (satisfied, as stated in the initial state)
- The robot arm is not holding any block (satisfied, as stated in the initial state)

All preconditions are met, so we can directly pick up yellow_block_1.

Let me provide the plan:

pickup yellow_block_1

That's it! Just one action to achieve the goal.

Let me double-check to make sure this satisfies the goal:
- After "pickup yellow_block_1", the robot arm is holding yellow_block_1, which is the goal.

So, the optimal plan for this problem is:

```
pickup yellow_block_1
```
