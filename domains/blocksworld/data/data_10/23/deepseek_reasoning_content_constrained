Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld planning problem. The goal is to have the robotic arm holding the yellow_block_1, but there are a bunch of constraints we need to satisfy along the way. Hmm, this might be a bit complex, but let's break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the initial state. The blocks are arranged as follows:

- blue_block_1 is on the table with grey_block_1 on top of it, and then white_block_1 on top of grey_block_1. So the tower is blue_block_1 -> grey_block_1 -> white_block_1. The white_block_1 is clear.
- white_block_2, blue_block_2, yellow_block_1, and brown_block_1 are all on the table and clear.
- The arm is empty.

The final goal is to have the arm holding yellow_block_1. So we need to perform actions that lead to picking up yellow_block_1. But the constraints complicate things. Let's list out all the constraints to make sure we don't miss any.

Constraints:

1. At least one state must have yellow_block_1 not on top of blue_block_2. But if that happens in state s, then white_block_2 must not be on the table at s or after s. So maybe we need to move white_block_2 off the table after ensuring yellow_block_1 isn't on blue_block_2.

2. Must hold blue_block_1 at some point. So we need to pick up blue_block_1. But initially, blue_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top. So to pick up blue_block_1, we need to unstack grey_block_1 and white_block_1 first. Wait, but blue_block_1 is on the table with grey_block_1 on it. So blue_block_1 is under grey_block_1. To pick up blue_block_1, we need it to be clear. But in the initial state, it's not clear because grey_block_1 is on top. So maybe we have to unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1, but that's part of the tower. Wait, the tower is blue_block_1 (on table), grey_block_1 on blue_block_1, then white_block_1 on grey_block_1. So white_block_1 is clear. To get to blue_block_1, we need to unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1, then unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1. Then we can pick up blue_block_1. But the constraint says we must hold blue_block_1 at least once, so that's part of the plan.

3. Must have a state where yellow_block_1 is not clear (i.e., something on top of it). But before that, there must be an earlier state where either grey_block_1 is on blue_block_2 or the arm is holding blue_block_2. Hmm, so we need to set up that condition before putting something on yellow_block_1.

4. Must hold blue_block_2 at some point. So we need to pick up blue_block_2, which is initially on the table and clear.

5. Must have a state where white_block_2 is not on the table and brown_block_1 has a block on top. So white_block_2 needs to be stacked somewhere, and brown_block_1 must have a block stacked on it.

6. yellow_block_1 must not be on the table at some state. Since the goal is to hold it, that's achieved when we pick it up. But maybe we have to put it down again? Wait, the goal is to be holding it, so the final action is pickup or unstack. Wait, no: the goal is the final state, so we need to end with holding yellow_block_1. So in the plan, the last action should be pickup yellow_block_1 or unstack it from somewhere. But if we have to satisfy that yellow_block_1 is not on the table in some state, then either we pick it up (so it's not on the table anymore) or stack it somewhere. Since the goal is to hold it, the final action is probably pickup or unstack, which would make it not on the table. So that constraint might be satisfied naturally. But also, when we pick up yellow_block_1, it's no longer on the table, so that state satisfies the "yellow_block_1 not on table" constraint. However, there's another constraint: if yellow_block_1 is not on the table in state s, then either blue_block_2 is not on the table or we are holding white_block_2 at s or after. So when we pick up yellow_block_1, we need to ensure that either blue_block_2 is not on the table (so maybe stack it somewhere) or we hold white_block_2 afterwards. Hmm.

7. grey_block_1 must not be on the table at some state, and then after that, it must be on top of brown_block_1. So we have to move grey_block_1 from blue_block_1 to brown_block_1. But initially, grey_block_1 is on blue_block_1. So to get it off, we need to unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1, then unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1, then put it on brown_block_1. But wait, putting it on brown_block_1 requires that brown_block_1 is clear. Initially, brown_block_1 is clear. So maybe after moving grey_block_1 to brown_block_1, that satisfies the constraint.

8. white_block_1 must not be on top of itself. Well, that's always true since a block can't be on top of itself, so that's automatically satisfied. So maybe that constraint is trivial and can be ignored.

9. At least one state must have white_block_2 not on the table or on top of blue_block_1. So we need to move white_block_2 either to blue_block_1 or somewhere else. But blue_block_1 is initially under grey_block_1. So to stack white_block_2 on blue_block_1, we need to clear blue_block_1 first by moving grey_block_1 and white_block_1.

10. yellow_block_1 must not be on top of blue_block_1. Initially, it's not, since yellow is on the table. So maybe that's already satisfied, but perhaps during the plan, if we ever put yellow on blue_block_1, then we need to undo that. Wait, but the constraint requires that in at least one state, yellow is not on blue_block_1. Since the initial state already satisfies that, maybe this constraint is already met. But the problem states that the constraints must be met in the plan, so perhaps we need to ensure that this condition holds at some state in the plan. Since the initial state is part of the plan, maybe this is already satisfied. But the problem might require that during the execution of the plan, this condition is true. Wait, the original state is part of the plan's states, so if the initial state meets this, then it's okay. But perhaps the problem requires that the condition holds in at least one state in the plan, which includes the initial state. So maybe that's already satisfied, but we need to check. Let me see: the initial state has yellow_block_1 on the table, so it's not on blue_block_1. So this constraint is satisfied in the initial state. Therefore, we don't need to do anything for this one. However, the next constraint says that if in some state s, yellow_block_1 is not on blue_block_1, then in s or after, white_block_2 is not on the table or the arm is holding brown_block_1. Since the initial state s0 has yellow not on blue_block_1, then in s0 or after, white_block_2 must not be on the table or the arm is holding brown_block_1. But in the initial state, white_block_2 is on the table, so we need to ensure that after s0, we either move white_block_2 off the table or hold brown_block_1. Hmm, so even though the first part of the constraint is met in the initial state, the implication requires that we address the second part. So after s0, we need to have white_block_2 not on the table or hold brown_block_1 at some point. So perhaps stacking white_block_2 somewhere or picking up brown_block_1.

Okay, this is a lot. Let's try to outline the steps needed, considering the constraints.

First, the main goal is to hold yellow_block_1. To do that, we need to pick it up from the table. The preconditions for pickup are that it's clear and on the table, and the arm is empty. Initially, yellow is on the table and clear, so we could pick it up. But wait, if we do that immediately, would that satisfy all constraints? Let's check.

If the plan is just "pickup yellow_block_1", then:

- The final state has the arm holding yellow, which is the goal.

But check the constraints:

1. Must have a state where yellow is not on blue_block_2. Since yellow is never stacked there, that's true in all states. But we need at least one state where this is true. Since it's always true, that's satisfied.

But the constraint also says that if in any state s, yellow is not on blue_block_2, then in s or after, white_block_2 is not on the table. But in the initial state, s0, yellow isn't on blue_block_2, and white_block_2 is on the table. So we need to ensure that after s0, white_block_2 is moved. So even if we just do pickup yellow, then after s0, white_block_2 is still on the table, violating the constraint. Therefore, we need to move white_block_2 off the table after s0. So the simple plan of just picking up yellow won't work because it doesn't satisfy this constraint.

So we need to include moving white_block_2 off the table at some point after the state where yellow isn't on blue_block_2. But since all states except those where yellow is on blue_block_2 have yellow not on blue_block_2, and since we never put yellow on blue_block_2, the constraint applies to all states. Therefore, whenever we have a state where yellow isn't on blue_block_2 (which is always), we need to have white_block_2 not on the table in that state or later. So in the plan, we must move white_block_2 off the table eventually.

But moving white_block_2 requires either stacking it somewhere or putting it down after holding it. Since the arm can only hold one block at a time, we need to handle that.

Additionally, other constraints:

- Must hold blue_block_1: So we need to pick it up. But it's under grey_block_1 and white_block_1. To pick up blue_block_1, we need to unstack the blocks above it. So unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1, then unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1, then pickup blue_block_1. But doing all that just to satisfy holding blue_block_1 might be time-consuming, but it's required.

- Must have a block on top of yellow_block_1 at some state. So after picking up yellow, we might need to put it down and stack something on it. But the goal is to hold yellow, so maybe we do this before the final pickup.

Wait, the goal is to end up holding yellow. So if we pick up yellow, then put it down, then stack something on it, then unstack it again. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps we can stack another block on yellow after putting it down. Let's think.

But let's outline the steps considering all constraints.

Possible steps:

1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1. Preconditions: white_block_1 is on grey_block_1, white is clear, arm is empty. After unstacking, arm holds white_block_1, grey_block_1 becomes clear.

2. Putdown white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is on the table.

3. Unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1. Now arm holds grey_block_1, blue_block_1 is clear.

4. Now, to satisfy the constraint about grey_block_1 not being on the table and then on brown_block_1: put grey_block_1 on brown_block_1. So stack grey_block_1 brown_block_1. Preconditions: holding grey_block_1 and brown_block_1 is clear. After stacking, brown_block_1 has grey on top, satisfying the constraint that brown_block_1 is not clear in some state.

Wait, constraint 7 says that there must be a state where white_block_2 is not on the table and brown_block_1 is not clear. So stacking grey on brown would make brown not clear, and if we move white_block_2, that's covered.

But let's continue.

5. Now, blue_block_1 is clear. We need to hold blue_block_1 to satisfy constraint 3. So pickup blue_block_1. Then put it down again? Or use it elsewhere.

6. Now, to satisfy holding blue_block_2: pickup blue_block_2 (it's on the table and clear). Then put it down or stack it somewhere.

But let's also consider the constraint that when yellow_block_1 is not on the table (which will happen when we pick it up), we need to have blue_block_2 not on the table or holding white_block_2. So if we stack blue_block_2 somewhere before picking up yellow, then when we pick up yellow, blue_block_2 is not on the table, satisfying that constraint.

Alternatively, after picking up yellow, we can hold white_block_2, but that would require putting down yellow first, which complicates things.

So perhaps stacking blue_block_2 on another block before picking up yellow.

But let's proceed step by step.

After step 5: holding blue_block_1. We can put it down, but then we have to do something else. Or stack it somewhere.

Wait, the constraint 3 requires that we hold blue_block_1 at some state. So step 5 achieves that. Now, we can put it down again.

But maybe we need to use blue_block_1 elsewhere. Let's see.

Now, moving white_block_2: need to get it off the table. Let's say we stack white_block_2 on blue_block_2. To do that:

7. Pickup white_block_2 (it's on the table and clear). Then stack it on blue_block_2 (which is clear if we haven't moved it yet). So:

7. pickup white_block_2

8. stack white_block_2 blue_block_2

Now, white_block_2 is not on the table, satisfying part of constraint 5 (the part where white_block_2 is not on the table and brown_block_1 has a block on top). Wait, but brown_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top from step 4. So that's already satisfied. So step 4 and step 8 together satisfy constraint 5: white_block_2 not on table and brown_block_1 not clear.

Now, constraint 5 is satisfied.

Next, constraint 6: must hold blue_block_2. So if we stacked white_block_2 on blue_block_2, blue_block_2 is under white_block_2. To hold blue_block_2, we need to unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2, then pickup blue_block_2. But that's more steps. Alternatively, maybe pick up blue_block_2 before stacking white on it.

Wait, if we first pick up blue_block_2 and then stack white on it, but blue_block_2 is on the table. So steps could be:

After step 4 (grey on brown):

5. pickup blue_block_2 (to satisfy holding it)

6. putdown blue_block_2 (maybe not helpful) or stack it somewhere.

But we need to hold blue_block_2 at least once, so step 5 would satisfy that. Then, stack white_block_2 on it:

7. pickup white_block_2

8. stack white_block_2 blue_block_2

But then blue_block_2 is under white_block_2. If we need to use blue_block_2 again, we might have to unstack.

But this approach may complicate other steps. Let's think.

Alternatively, after step 4 (grey on brown), we can:

5. pickup blue_block_2 (satisfy constraint 6)

6. stack blue_block_2 somewhere. Maybe on brown_block_1? But brown already has grey. Or on another block. Maybe stack blue_block_2 on yellow_block_1. But yellow is on the table. So stack blue_block_2 on yellow_block_1. Then, when we need to have something on top of yellow (constraint 4), that's satisfied. But we need to ensure that before stacking something on yellow, the precondition that either grey_block_1 is on blue_block_2 or the arm is holding blue_block_2 is met.

Wait, constraint 4 says that if there's a block on yellow, then earlier there must be a state where grey is on blue_block_2 or the arm holds blue_block_2. So if we stack blue_block_2 on yellow, then before that, we need to have either grey on blue_block_2 or have held blue_block_2. Since we picked up blue_block_2 in step 5, that satisfies the "held blue_block_2" part, so stacking blue_block_2 on yellow would meet the requirement.

So:

5. pickup blue_block_2 (hold it, satisfying constraint 6)

6. stack blue_block_2 yellow_block_1 (now yellow has blue on top, satisfying constraint 4. Also, blue_block_2 is not on the table anymore, which might help with the constraint related to yellow not on the table.)

But then, to pick up yellow_block_1, we need to unstack blue_block_2 from it. But the goal is to hold yellow_block_1. So after stacking blue on yellow, we need to unstack blue from yellow, then pick up yellow. That adds steps.

Alternatively, perhaps stack another block on yellow. For example, if we have white_block_1 on the table (from step 2), we could stack that on yellow.

But let's proceed.

Continuing from step 5 and 6:

5. pickup blue_block_2 (hold it)

6. stack blue_block_2 yellow_block_1 (now yellow is under blue_block_2. So yellow is not clear (satisfies constraint 4), and blue_block_2 is not on the table. Also, since we held blue_block_2, the requirement for constraint 4 is met.

Now, to get yellow, we need to unstack blue_block_2 from yellow. But the arm is empty after stacking. So:

7. unstack blue_block_2 yellow_block_1 (preconditions: blue is on yellow, blue is clear, arm is empty). After unstacking, we hold blue_block_2, and yellow becomes clear.

8. putdown blue_block_2.

Now, yellow is clear again. So we can pick it up.

9. pickup yellow_block_1. Now, the goal is achieved.

But let's check the constraints along the way.

Let's verify each constraint:

1. At least one state where yellow is not on blue_block_2. Since we never put yellow on blue_block_2, all states satisfy this. So the first part is okay. The second part: whenever yellow is not on blue_block_2 (which is always), then white_block_2 must not be on the table in that state or after. In the steps above, after step 6, white_block_2 is still on the table. So we need to move white_block_2 off the table. Oops, we forgot to handle that. So in the current steps, white_block_2 is still on the table. Therefore, the constraint that when yellow is not on blue_block_2 (which is always), white_block_2 must not be on the table in that state or after. So we need to move white_block_2 off the table.

So let's adjust the plan.

After step 6 (stack blue_block_2 on yellow), we need to move white_block_2.

But white_block_2 is on the table. So we need to pick it up and stack it somewhere.

But the arm is currently empty after step 6. Wait, step 6 is stack blue_block_2 on yellow, so after that, the arm is empty. Then, step 7 is unstack blue_block_2 from yellow. Wait, maybe we should handle white_block_2 before that.

Alternative approach:

After step 4 (grey on brown):

5. pickup blue_block_2 (hold it, satisfies constraint 6)

6. stack blue_block_2 yellow_block_1 (now yellow has blue on top)

7. pickup white_block_2 (it's on the table and clear)

8. stack white_block_2 somewhere. Maybe on blue_block_1, which is now clear after we unstacked grey and white earlier. But blue_block_1 is clear after step 3 (unstack grey from blue_block_1). So stack white_block_2 on blue_block_1. Then, white_block_2 is not on the table, satisfying the constraint. Also, this satisfies constraint 9: at least one state where white_block_2 is not on the table or on top of blue_block_1. Since we stack it on blue_block_1, that's true.

So steps 7 and 8 would be:

7. pickup white_block_2

8. stack white_block_2 blue_block_1

Now, white_block_2 is not on the table. That satisfies the constraint related to whenever yellow is not on blue_block_2, white_block_2 is not on the table after that. Because after step 8, white_block_2 is off the table.

Then, proceed to unstack blue_block_2 from yellow:

9. unstack blue_block_2 yellow_block_1

10. putdown blue_block_2

11. pickup yellow_block_1

Now, the goal is achieved. Let's check all constraints again.

Constraint 1: yellow is not on blue_block_2 in all states, so satisfied. After any state where this is true, white_block_2 is not on the table from step 8 onwards.

Constraint 2: held blue_block_1 in step 5 (earlier steps: step 5 was pickup blue_block_1? Wait, no. Wait, in the steps above, after step 4 (grey on brown), the next steps were about blue_block_2. Wait, let's re-express the steps correctly.

Wait, I think I got mixed up earlier. Let's re-express the steps with proper numbering.

Let me re-structure:

Initial steps:

1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1.

2. Putdown white_block_1.

3. Unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1.

4. Stack grey_block_1 on brown_block_1. (Satisfies constraint about grey not on table and later on brown.)

5. Pickup blue_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 3.)

6. Putdown blue_block_1. (Now blue_block_1 is clear again.)

7. Pickup blue_block_2. (Satisfies constraint 6.)

8. Stack blue_block_2 on yellow_block_1. (Now yellow is not clear, satisfying constraint 4. Also, since we held blue_block_2 before, the precondition for constraint 4 is met.)

9. Pickup white_block_2. (To move it off the table.)

10. Stack white_block_2 on blue_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 9: white_block_2 is on blue_block_1.)

11. Unstack blue_block_2 from yellow_block_1.

12. Putdown blue_block_2.

13. Pickup yellow_block_1. (Goal achieved.)

Now, let's verify all constraints:

1. yellow not on blue_block_2: Always true. After any state, white_block_2 is off the table after step 10.

Yes.

2. Must hold blue_block_1: Step 5.

3. yellow not clear in step 8 (blue_block_2 on top). The precondition for this is that earlier, either grey is on blue_block_2 or held blue_block_2. We held blue_block_2 in step 7, so satisfied.

4. Held blue_block_2: Step 7.

5. white_block_2 not on table and brown not clear: white is stacked on blue_block_1 (step 10), brown has grey (step 4), so yes.

6. yellow not on table: when picked up in step 13, yes. Then, the constraint that when yellow is not on table, blue_block_2 is not on table or holding white_block_2. In step 13, blue_block_2 is on the table (step 12 put it down), but in step 13, we are holding yellow, not white_block_2. So this violates the constraint. Wait, in step 13, when we pick up yellow (making it not on table), the constraint requires that at that state or after, blue_block_2 is not on table or we hold white_block_2. But in step 13, blue_block_2 is on the table (from step 12), and we are holding yellow, not white. So this violates the constraint. Therefore, we need to adjust.

Ah, here's a problem. When we pick up yellow in step 13, yellow is not on the table. So according to constraint 9, at that state (s13) or after, either blue_block_2 is not on the table or we are holding white_block_2. But in step 13, blue_block_2 is on the table (we put it down in step 12), and we are holding yellow. So we need to ensure that after step 13, either blue_block_2 is not on the table or we hold white_block_2.

But the plan ends at step 13. So we need to have, after step 13, blue_block_2 not on the table or hold white_block_2. Since the plan ends there, we need to have either condition met in step 13. But blue_block_2 is on the table, and we're holding yellow, not white. So this is a problem.

Therefore, we need to adjust the plan to ensure that when we pick up yellow (step 13), either blue_block_2 is not on the table or we are holding white_block_2. Since in step 13, we can't be holding white_block_2 (we're holding yellow), we need to have blue_block_2 not on the table. So before step 13, we need to move blue_block_2 off the table.

So perhaps after step 12 (putdown blue_block_2), we need to stack it somewhere else before picking up yellow.

But where? Let's see:

After step 12: blue_block_2 is on the table. We need to move it off before picking up yellow.

But how? Let's add steps:

After step 12:

12.5. Pickup blue_block_2.

12.6. Stack blue_block_2 somewhere, like on brown_block_1 (but brown already has grey on it). Or on white_block_1, which is on the table.

But white_block_1 is on the table after step 2. So:

12.5. Pickup blue_block_2.

12.6. Stack blue_block_2 white_block_1.

Now, blue_block_2 is on white_block_1, which is on the table. Then:

12.7. Proceed to pickup yellow_block_1.

Now, in step 12.7, when we pick up yellow, blue_block_2 is not on the table (it's on white_block_1), satisfying the constraint.

So updated steps:

1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1.

2. Putdown white_block_1.

3. Unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1.

4. Stack grey_block_1 on brown_block_1.

5. Pickup blue_block_1.

6. Putdown blue_block_1.

7. Pickup blue_block_2.

8. Stack blue_block_2 on yellow_block_1.

9. Pickup white_block_2.

10. Stack white_block_2 on blue_block_1.

11. Unstack blue_block_2 from yellow_block_1.

12. Putdown blue_block_2.

13. Pickup blue_block_2.

14. Stack blue_block_2 on white_block_1.

15. Pickup yellow_block_1.

Now, in step 15, yellow is not on the table, and blue_block_2 is on white_block_1 (not on the table), so the constraint is satisfied.

But this makes the plan longer. Is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, instead of putting blue_block_2 on white_block_1, maybe stack it on another block earlier. Let's see.

After step 8 (blue_block_2 on yellow), perhaps stack blue_block_2 elsewhere before unstacking it.

But that might not help. Alternatively, when we unstack blue_block_2 from yellow (step 11), instead of putting it down, stack it somewhere else immediately.

So step 11: unstack blue_block_2 from yellow.

Step 12: stack blue_block_2 on another block, say, white_block_1 (which is on the table).

Then, blue_block_2 is not on the table. Then step 13: pickup yellow.

This way, when we pick up yellow, blue_block_2 is not on the table.

So revised steps:

1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1.

2. Putdown white_block_1.

3. Unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1.

4. Stack grey_block_1 on brown_block_1.

5. Pickup blue_block_1.

6. Putdown blue_block_1.

7. Pickup blue_block_2.

8. Stack blue_block_2 on yellow_block_1.

9. Pickup white_block_2.

10. Stack white_block_2 on blue_block_1.

11. Unstack blue_block_2 from yellow_block_1.

12. Stack blue_block_2 on white_block_1.

13. Pickup yellow_block_1.

This plan has 13 steps. Now, checking the constraint when yellow is not on the table (step 13), blue_block_2 is on white_block_1, so not on the table. Satisfied.

Other constraints:

- Must hold blue_block_1: step 5.

- yellow not clear: step 8 (blue on yellow), and before that, held blue_block_2 (step7), satisfying the precondition.

- white_block_2 not on table: step 10.

- brown_block_1 not clear: step4.

- grey_block_1 not on table: step4.

- white_block_1 not on top of itself: always true.

- white_block_2 on blue_block_1: step10.

- yellow not on blue_block_1: always true.

- After step 13, the arm is holding yellow, which is the goal.

Now, check all constraints:

1. yellow not on blue_block_2 in all states. After any state, white_block_2 is off table from step10.

2. Held blue_block_1: yes.

3. yellow not clear in step8. Precondition met by step7.

4. Held blue_block_2: step7.

5. white_block_2 not on table and brown not clear: steps10 and4.

6. yellow not on table: step13. blue_block_2 not on table (step12).

7. grey_block_1 not on table (step4) and later on brown_block_1.

8. white_block_1 not on top of itself: always true.

9. white_block_2 not on table or on blue_block_1: step10.

10. yellow not on blue_block_1: always true.

11. The constraint that if yellow is not on blue_block_1 (always true), then white_block_2 not on table or holding brown_block_1. After step10, white_block_2 is not on table, so satisfied.

All constraints seem met.

Now, is this plan optimal? Are there redundant steps? Let's count the steps:

13 actions. Let's see if we can shorten it.

For example, after step5 (pickup blue_block_1), do we need to put it down (step6)? If we can use it elsewhere, maybe not. But step5 is just to satisfy the constraint of holding blue_block_1. So once picked up, we can put it down immediately. That's two steps (5 and6). But maybe there's a way to hold blue_block_1 and use it in a way that helps the plan.

Alternatively, after step3 (unstack grey_block_1), we have to stack it on brown (step4). Then step5 pickup blue_block_1, step6 putdown. Maybe we can skip putting it down and use it elsewhere. For example, stack it somewhere. But where? Maybe stack blue_block_1 on another block, but that might require more steps.

Alternatively, after step5 (holding blue_block_1), stack it on some block to satisfy other constraints. But I don't see a way to use that to shorten the plan.

Another possible optimization: when we stack white_block_2 on blue_block_1 (step10), maybe we can do that earlier. For example, after step4, stack white_block_2 on blue_block_1 before handling blue_block_2. Let's see:

Alternative steps:

1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1.

2. Putdown white_block_1.

3. Unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1.

4. Stack grey_block_1 on brown_block_1.

5. Pickup blue_block_1. (hold it)

6. Putdown blue_block_1. (now clear)

7. Pickup white_block_2.

8. Stack white_block_2 on blue_block_1. (satisfies moving white_block_2 off table)

9. Pickup blue_block_2.

10. Stack blue_block_2 on yellow_block_1. (yellow not clear)

11. Unstack blue_block_2 from yellow_block_1.

12. Stack blue_block_2 on white_block_1.

13. Pickup yellow_block_1.

This is 13 steps again. Same length.

Alternatively, after stacking white_block_2 on blue_block_1 (step8), we could proceed to handle blue_block_2.

Is there a way to reduce steps? Perhaps by combining actions.

But in Blocksworld, each action is a single step. So I don't think we can merge steps.

Another thought: after step12 (stack blue_block_2 on white_block_1), we can immediately pickup yellow_block_1. That's what the current plan does.

Alternatively, after step11 (unstack blue_block_2 from yellow), instead of stacking it on white_block_1, stack it on another block that's already in a tower. For example, stack it on white_block_2 (which is on blue_block_1). But that would require that white_block_2 is clear. After step8, white_block_2 is on blue_block_1 and clear. So:

11. Unstack blue_block_2 from yellow.

12. Stack blue_block_2 on white_block_2.

Then, blue_block_2 is not on the table, and we can pickup yellow.

This would save a step: step12 instead of stack and then pickup.

Wait, in this case:

Steps would be:

1. Unstack white1 from grey1.

2. Putdown white1.

3. Unstack grey1 from blue1.

4. Stack grey1 on brown1.

5. Pickup blue1.

6. Putdown blue1.

7. Pickup white2.

8. Stack white2 on blue1.

9. Pickup blue2.

10. Stack blue2 on yellow.

11. Unstack blue2 from yellow.

12. Stack blue2 on white2 (now on blue1).

13. Pickup yellow.

This is still 13 steps. No change.

Hmm. I think this is as optimal as it gets. Unless there's a way to combine actions or achieve multiple constraints with fewer steps.

Another angle: when we stack blue_block_2 on yellow (step10), we could leave it there and not unstack it, but then how do we pick up yellow? Because yellow would have blue on top. So we have to unstack blue_block_2 from yellow to make yellow clear again. So that's necessary.

Alternatively, instead of stacking blue_block_2 on yellow, stack another block on yellow. For example, stack white_block_1 on yellow. But white_block_1 is on the table after step2. So steps could be:

After step2 (white1 on table):

3. Unstack grey1 from blue1.

4. Stack grey1 on brown1.

5. Pickup blue1.

6. Putdown blue1.

7. Pickup white1.

8. Stack white1 on yellow. (Now yellow is not clear. Before this, we need to have held blue_block_2 or grey on blue_block_2. But we haven't handled blue_block_2 yet. So to satisfy constraint4, we need to have held blue_block_2 before stacking on yellow. So this approach would require picking up blue_block_2 first, which adds steps.

Thus, this might not save steps.

Overall, I think the 13-step plan is necessary to satisfy all constraints. However, perhaps there's a shorter path.

Wait, let's consider another approach. Instead of moving grey_block_1 to brown_block_1, maybe move it elsewhere. But constraint7 requires that grey_block_1 is not on the table in some state and then on brown_block_1. So we have to stack grey on brown.

So that part is fixed.

Another idea: after unstacking grey_block_1 (step3), instead of stacking it on brown_block_1, maybe stack it on blue_block_2. Then, this would satisfy the precondition for constraint4 (grey on blue_block_2). But then we need to move it to brown_block_1 later. Let's see:

Steps:

1. Unstack white1 from grey1.

2. Putdown white1.

3. Unstack grey1 from blue1.

4. Stack grey1 on blue2. (Now, grey is on blue2. So in some state, grey is on blue2, which would satisfy the precondition for constraint4.)

5. Pickup blue1.

6. Putdown blue1.

7. Pickup blue2. (Now, grey is on blue2, so to pickup blue2, we need to unstack grey1 from blue2 first. Wait, no: to pickup blue2, which is on the table, but if grey is on blue2, then blue2 is not clear. So this approach complicates things. So step4 makes blue2 not clear, which prevents us from picking it up. So this is a problem.

Thus, stacking grey on blue2 would make blue2 unavailable until we unstack grey. So this is not helpful.

Therefore, the initial approach of stacking grey on brown is better.

Alternative plan focusing on constraint4:

Constraint4 requires that when there's a block on yellow, there must have been a state where either grey is on blue2 or we held blue2. If we can hold blue2 before stacking something on yellow, then we can satisfy this.

So if we pickup blue2 first, then stack something on yellow, that would work.

So let's try:

1. Pickup blue2. (Holds blue2, satisfying constraint6.)

2. Stack blue2 on yellow. (Now yellow is not clear. Precondition for constraint4 met by holding blue2.)

3. Unstack blue2 from yellow. (Now holding blue2 again.)

4. Putdown blue2.

5. Proceed to handle other constraints.

But then, we need to move white_block_2 off the table. Let's see:

6. Pickup white2.

7. Stack white2 on some block, say blue1. But blue1 is under grey and white1. So need to clear it.

So:

0. Unstack white1 from grey1.

1. Putdown white1.

2. Unstack grey1 from blue1.

3. Stack grey1 on brown1.

4. Pickup blue2.

5. Stack blue2 on yellow.

6. Unstack blue2 from yellow.

7. Putdown blue2.

8. Pickup white2.

9. Stack white2 on blue1.

10. Pickup yellow.

But this leaves out holding blue_block_1. So we need to add steps to pickup blue_block_1.

After step3 (grey on brown):

4. Pickup blue1.

5. Putdown blue1.

6. Pickup blue2.

... etc.

This approach might not save steps.

It seems that regardless of the order, the constraints require a certain number of steps. Therefore, the 13-step plan may be optimal.

But let's count the steps again in the initial plan:

1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1.

2. Putdown white_block_1.

3. Unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1.

4. Stack grey_block_1 on brown_block_1.

5. Pickup blue_block_1.

6. Putdown blue_block_1.

7. Pickup blue_block_2.

8. Stack blue_block_2 on yellow_block_1.

9. Pickup white_block_2.

10. Stack white_block_2 on blue_block_1.

11. Unstack blue_block_2 from yellow_block_1.

12. Stack blue_block_2 on white_block_1.

13. Pickup yellow_block_1.

Yes, 13 steps. Now, is there a way to reduce this?

Let's see:

After step4 (grey on brown), we have blue_block_1 clear. We need to hold it (step5). But if we can use blue_block_1 for something else instead of just putting it down. For example, stack something on it. But white_block_2 needs to be moved. So:

After step4:

5. Pickup blue_block_1.

6. Stack blue_block_1 somewhere, but where? Maybe on white_block_2.

But white_block_2 is on the table. So:

6. Stack blue_block_1 on white_block_2.

But then white_block_2 is under blue_block_1. Then, when we need to move white_block_2, we have to unstack blue_block_1 first. Which may add steps.

Alternatively, stack blue_block_1 on another block. Not sure if helpful.

Another idea: after step5 (hold blue_block_1), instead of putting it down, use it to satisfy another constraint. But I don't see a direct way.

Alternatively, skip steps5 and6 if possible. But we must hold blue_block_1 to satisfy constraint3. So steps5 and6 are necessary.

So steps5 and6 are essential.

Thus, the plan seems to be as short as possible.

Another check: when we stack blue_block_2 on white_block_1 (step12), white_block_1 is on the table. So blue_block_2 is on white_block_1, which is on the table. So blue_block_2 is not on the table, satisfying the constraint related to yellow not on table.

Yes.

Now, ensuring all constraints are met:

- "yellow_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2" in all states. So satisfied.

- "If yellow not on blue2, then white2 not on table after." White2 is stacked on blue_block_1 in step10, so satisfied.

- Held blue_block_1: step5.

- yellow not clear in step8. Before that, held blue2 in step7, so satisfied.

- Held blue2: step7.

- white2 not on table and brown not clear: step10 and step4.

- yellow not on table: step13. blue2 not on table (step12).

- grey not on table (step4) and later on brown.

- white1 not on top of itself: always true.

- white2 not on table or on blue1: step10.

- yellow not on blue1: always true.

- If yellow not on blue1 (always), then white2 not on table or hold brown. white2 not on table after step10.

All constraints are satisfied.

Thus, the final plan is as outlined with 13 steps. However, I need to check if there's a shorter way by combining actions or reordering.

Another possible optimization: after step10 (stack white2 on blue1), can we unstack blue2 from yellow and stack it on white2 in one step? No, each action is separate.

Alternatively, after step8 (stack blue2 on yellow), instead of unstacking, perhaps use another block to stack on yellow. For example, after step8, use white_block_1 to stack on yellow. But white_block_1 is on the table. So:

9. Pickup white_block_1.

10. Stack white_block_1 on yellow_block_1. (Now, yellow is not clear. Precondition for this stack: holding white1 and yellow is clear. But after step8, yellow has blue2 on top, so it's not clear. Therefore, cannot stack white1 on yellow. So this is not possible.

Thus, the only way to have something on yellow is to use blue2, which requires unstacking it later.

Therefore, the initial plan is necessary.

In conclusion, the optimal plan has 13 steps. But I'm not sure if there's a shorter way. Given the complexity of the constraints, it's possible that this is the minimal length.
