Okay, let's see. The problem is to get the robotic arm to hold the yellow_block_1. The initial state has several blocks on the table and a small tower: blue_block_1 with grey_block_1 on top, then white_block_1. The yellow_block_1 is on the table and clear. The constraints here are probably that we need to achieve this goal in the shortest number of steps possible.

First, I need to check what's required to pick up the yellow_block_1. The "pickup" action requires that the block is on the table, clear, and the arm isn't holding anything. Since yellow_block_1 is on the table and clear in the initial state, can we just do "pickup yellow_block_1" right away?

Wait, the initial state says "there is no block on top of yellow_block_1", so it's clear. Also, the arm is not holding anything. So yes, the first action should be "pickup yellow_block_1". That would immediately achieve the goal. So the plan is just that one action. But wait, are there any constraints that might prevent this?

Wait, the problem statement mentions "a valid plan must abide by the following constraints", but the user didn't list any constraints here. Wait, looking back at the original problem description. The user provided the problem, and then under "The task is to bring about the following situation...", they added "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then there's nothing after that. Maybe it's a formatting error. Hmm. But assuming there are no additional constraints beyond the standard Blocksworld rules, then the solution is straightforward.

So the initial state is that yellow_block_1 is on the table, clear, and the arm is empty. So the preconditions for picking it up are all met. Therefore, the optimal plan is just one action: pickup yellow_block_1. That's the shortest possible plan.
