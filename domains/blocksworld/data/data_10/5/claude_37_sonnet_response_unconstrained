Let's analyze the initial state of the world and the goal state to understand what actions need to be done.

Initial state:
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- purple_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
- purple_block_1 is clear
- orange_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Goal state:
- orange_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1

Let's draw the initial state to help visualize it:

```
     purple_block_1           red_block_1       orange_block_1
           |                       |
     blue_block_1                  |
           |                       |
    white_block_1            grey_block_2
           |
     grey_block_1
```

And we want to get to:

```
                            orange_block_1
                                  |
                            blue_block_1
                                  |
                            ???
```

So the goal is to have orange_block_1 on top of blue_block_1. Currently, orange_block_1 is on the table and blue_block_1 is in a stack with purple_block_1, white_block_1, and grey_block_1.

To achieve our goal, we need to:
1. Free blue_block_1 from being under purple_block_1.
2. Move orange_block_1 on top of blue_block_1.

Let's think through the steps:

1. Unstack purple_block_1 from blue_block_1 (This makes blue_block_1 "clear")
2. Put purple_block_1 on the table
3. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1
4. Put blue_block_1 on the table
5. Pick up orange_block_1 from the table
6. Stack orange_block_1 on top of blue_block_1

But wait, after step 3, we have blue_block_1 in hand. To move orange_block_1 on top of blue_block_1, we need blue_block_1 to be on something (either the table or another block). So we need to put blue_block_1 down first:

1. Unstack purple_block_1 from blue_block_1
2. Put purple_block_1 on the table
3. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1
4. Put blue_block_1 on the table
5. Pick up orange_block_1 from the table
6. Stack orange_block_1 on top of blue_block_1

Now, let's check if this plan satisfies the preconditions of each action:

1. Unstack purple_block_1 from blue_block_1: 
   - Preconditions: (i) purple_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1, (ii) purple_block_1 is clear, (iii) you are not holding any block.
   - Check: (i) Yes, purple_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1 in the initial state. (ii) Yes, purple_block_1 is clear in the initial state. (iii) Yes, initially you are not holding any block.
   - Effects: (i) purple_block_1 is no longer on top of blue_block_1, (ii) blue_block_1 is clear, (iii) you are holding purple_block_1.

2. Put purple_block_1 on the table (putdown purple_block_1):
   - Preconditions: You are holding purple_block_1.
   - Check: Yes, after the previous action, you are holding purple_block_1.
   - Effects: (i) purple_block_1 is on the table, (ii) purple_block_1 is clear, (iii) you are not holding any block.

3. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1:
   - Preconditions: (i) blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, (ii) blue_block_1 is clear, (iii) you are not holding any block.
   - Check: (i) Yes, blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 in the initial state. (ii) Yes, after the previous actions, blue_block_1 is clear. (iii) Yes, after the previous action, you are not holding any block.
   - Effects: (i) blue_block_1 is no longer on top of white_block_1, (ii) white_block_1 is clear, (iii) you are holding blue_block_1.

4. Put blue_block_1 on the table (putdown blue_block_1):
   - Preconditions: You are holding blue_block_1.
   - Check: Yes, after the previous action, you are holding blue_block_1.
   - Effects: (i) blue_block_1 is on the table, (ii) blue_block_1 is clear, (iii) you are not holding any block.

5. Pick up orange_block_1 from the table (pickup orange_block_1):
   - Preconditions: (i) orange_block_1 is clear, (ii) orange_block_1 is on the table, (iii) you are not holding any block.
   - Check: (i) Yes, orange_block_1 is clear initially and this doesn't change. (ii) Yes, orange_block_1 is on the table initially and this doesn't change. (iii) Yes, after the previous action, you are not holding any block.
   - Effects: (i) you are holding orange_block_1, (ii) orange_block_1 is no longer on the table.

6. Stack orange_block_1 on top of blue_block_1:
   - Preconditions: (i) you are holding orange_block_1, (ii) blue_block_1 is clear.
   - Check: (i) Yes, after the previous action, you are holding orange_block_1. (ii) Yes, blue_block_1 is clear after we put it on the table.
   - Effects: (i) orange_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1, (ii) orange_block_1 is clear, (iii) blue_block_1 is no longer clear, (iv) you are not holding any block.

All the preconditions of our actions are satisfied, so the plan is valid. Let's simplify it to make sure it's optimal:

1. unstack purple_block_1 from blue_block_1
2. putdown purple_block_1
3. unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1
4. putdown blue_block_1
5. pickup orange_block_1
6. stack orange_block_1 on blue_block_1

I believe this is optimal as we need to free blue_block_1 from being under purple_block_1 and on top of white_block_1, and then move orange_block_1 on top of it.

Actually, let me rewrite this in the format of the domain, which uses the action names in lowercase and the arguments directly:

1. unstack purple_block_1 blue_block_1
2. putdown purple_block_1
3. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
4. putdown blue_block_1
5. pickup orange_block_1
6. stack orange_block_1 blue_block_1

That's the final plan.
