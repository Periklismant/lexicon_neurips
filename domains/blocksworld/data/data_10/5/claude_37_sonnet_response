Alright, so I'm given a Blocksworld problem with a specific initial state, a goal state, and a set of constraints. Let me break this down:

**Initial State:**
- `grey_block_1` is on the table
- `grey_block_2` is on the table
- `white_block_1` is on top of `grey_block_1`
- `blue_block_1` is on top of `white_block_1`
- `purple_block_1` is on top of `blue_block_1`
- `orange_block_1` is on the table
- `red_block_1` is on top of `grey_block_2`
- `purple_block_1`, `orange_block_1`, and `red_block_1` are clear
- Not holding any block

**Goal State:**
- `orange_block_1` is on top of `blue_block_1`

**Constraints:**
1. At some point, I should be holding `grey_block_1` while `orange_block_1` is on top of `grey_block_2`
2. At some point, `purple_block_1` should have a block on top of it
3. If `purple_block_1` ever has a block on top, then at an earlier state, either `white_block_1` is on the table or `grey_block_2` is not on the table
4. At some point, `grey_block_1` should be on top of `white_block_1`
5. At some point, `blue_block_1` is not on top of `white_block_1` and `grey_block_2` is on top of `red_block_1`
6. At some point, I should be holding `orange_block_1`
7. If I'm ever holding `orange_block_1`, then at the same state or a later state, `purple_block_1` should have a block on top and `purple_block_1` should be on top of `orange_block_1`
8. `purple_block_1` should never be on the table
9. At some point, `grey_block_2` is not on top of `red_block_1`
10. If `grey_block_2` is ever not on top of `red_block_1`, then at the same state or a later state, `purple_block_1` should have a block on top
11. At some point, either `blue_block_1` is on the table or I'm holding `red_block_1`
12. At some point, `orange_block_1` should have a block on top
13. If `orange_block_1` ever has a block on top, then at an earlier state, either `purple_block_1` is on top of `red_block_1` or `grey_block_2` is not on the table
14. At some point, I should be holding `white_block_1`

Let me think through this step by step to come up with a valid plan:

The goal state is to have `orange_block_1` on top of `blue_block_1`. 

In the initial state, `orange_block_1` is on the table, while `blue_block_1` is in a tower with `grey_block_1` at the bottom, then `white_block_1`, then `blue_block_1`, and `purple_block_1` at the top.

Given constraints 8 and 7, we know that `purple_block_1` should never be on the table and if I ever hold `orange_block_1`, there should be a state where `purple_block_1` is on top of `orange_block_1` and has a block on top of it. 

Given constraint 5, at some point I need to have `blue_block_1` not on top of `white_block_1` and `grey_block_2` on top of `red_block_1`.

Considering constraints 3 and 12, if `purple_block_1` ever has a block on top, at an earlier state, either `white_block_1` is on the table or `grey_block_2` is not on the table. Similarly, if `orange_block_1` has a block on top, at an earlier state, either `purple_block_1` is on top of `red_block_1` or `grey_block_2` is not on the table.

So, here's a high-level plan:
1. Reconfigure the blocks to ensure all constraints are met.
2. End with `orange_block_1` on top of `blue_block_1`.

Let's map out a plan:

1. First, I'll dismantle the stack with `purple_block_1`, `blue_block_1`, `white_block_1`, and `grey_block_1`. This will let me reposition these blocks.
2. I'll also move `red_block_1` from on top of `grey_block_2` to ensure I can meet all the constraints involving these blocks.
3. I'll set up the final configuration with `orange_block_1` on top of `blue_block_1`.

Now, let me start building the specific actions:

Initial state:
- `grey_block_1` on table with `white_block_1`, `blue_block_1`, and `purple_block_1` stacked on top
- `grey_block_2` on table with `red_block_1` on top
- `orange_block_1` on table
- not holding any block

First, I need to dismantle the stack with `purple_block_1` at the top:
1. `unstack purple_block_1 blue_block_1`
2. `putdown purple_block_1`
3. `unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1`
4. `putdown blue_block_1`
5. `unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1`

Wait, I think I should reconsider because of constraint 8, which says `purple_block_1` should never be on the table. Let me rethink...

Hmm, if `purple_block_1` can't be on the table, I need to ensure it's always on top of another block or being held. Let me reconsider the initial state and think step by step.

There are several constraints that involve `purple_block_1`:
- Constraint 2: At some point, `purple_block_1` should have a block on top of it.
- Constraint 3: If `purple_block_1` ever has a block on top, then at an earlier state, either `white_block_1` is on the table or `grey_block_2` is not on the table.
- Constraint 7: If I'm ever holding `orange_block_1`, then at the same state or a later state, `purple_block_1` should have a block on top and `purple_block_1` should be on top of `orange_block_1`.
- Constraint 8: `purple_block_1` should never be on the table.
- Constraint 10: If `grey_block_2` is ever not on top of `red_block_1`, then at the same state or a later state, `purple_block_1` should have a block on top.

Given these constraints, I can't just simply put `purple_block_1` on the table. I need to rethink my approach.

Let's see... I need to hold `orange_block_1` at some point (constraint 6), and if I do, then I need to have `purple_block_1` on top of `orange_block_1` and a block on top of `purple_block_1` (constraint 7). 

With constraint 8, I can't put `purple_block_1` on the table. So, I'll need to move it to another block, and then make sure I stack something on top of it.

Let me reapproach this:

1. `unstack purple_block_1 blue_block_1`
2. `stack purple_block_1 orange_block_1` (to start satisfying constraint 7)
3. `unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1`
4. `putdown blue_block_1` (to satisfy constraint 11, which states at some point either `blue_block_1` is on the table or I'm holding `red_block_1`)
5. `unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1`
6. (We now have `white_block_1` in hand, satisfying constraint 14)
7. `stack white_block_1 purple_block_1` (to satisfy constraint 2, which says at some point `purple_block_1` should have a block on top)

At this point, `white_block_1` is on top of `purple_block_1`, which is on top of `orange_block_1`. This would partially satisfy constraint 3, but I still need to make sure that at an earlier state, either `white_block_1` is on the table or `grey_block_2` is not on the table.

Let's think about how to satisfy constraint 5, which says at some point, `blue_block_1` is not on top of `white_block_1` (which is true now) and `grey_block_2` is on top of `red_block_1`.

For now, let's continue:

8. `pickup grey_block_1`
9. `stack grey_block_1 white_block_1` (to satisfy constraint 4, `grey_block_1` on top of `white_block_1`)
10. `unstack red_block_1 grey_block_2` (to satisfy constraint 9, which says at some point `grey_block_2` is not on top of `red_block_1`. Note that this is wrong: the constraint actually says `grey_block_2` is not on top of `red_block_1`. I messed up the direction.)

Hm, let's reconsider. I'm misinterpreting constraint 9. Let's be careful:

Constraint 9 actually says: At some point, `grey_block_2` is not on top of `red_block_1`. But in the initial state, `red_block_1` is on top of `grey_block_2`, not the other way around. So this constraint is already satisfied.

Let's continue with the plan:

10. `putdown red_block_1`
11. `pickup grey_block_2` (this makes `grey_block_2` not on the table, which has been referenced in constraint 3)
12. `stack grey_block_2 red_block_1` (to satisfy constraint 5, we need `grey_block_2` on top of `red_block_1`)
13. `unstack grey_block_1 white_block_1`
14. `putdown grey_block_1`
15. (We've already satisfied constraint 2, which said at some point `purple_block_1` should have a block on top of it)
16. `unstack white_block_1 purple_block_1`
17. `putdown white_block_1` (this placed `white_block_1` on the table, which is referenced in constraint 3)
18. `unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1`
19. `pickup blue_block_1`
20. `stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1` (to satisfy constraint 10, if `grey_block_2` is ever not on top of `red_block_1`, which happened temporarily in step 11, then `purple_block_1` should have a block on top, which we're ensuring now)
21. `pickup orange_block_1` (to satisfy constraint 6, at some point, I should be holding `orange_block_1`)
22. `stack orange_block_1 grey_block_1` (for now, just to place it somewhere)
23. `unstack blue_block_1 purple_block_1`
24. `putdown blue_block_1`
25. `stack purple_block_1 orange_block_1` (to satisfy constraint 7, after holding `orange_block_1`, `purple_block_1` should be on top and should have a block on top, which we'll do next)
26. `pickup blue_block_1`
27. `stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1` (to satisfy constraint 7, ensuring a block is on top of `purple_block_1`)

Let's check constraints 1 and 12 now.

Constraint 1 says at some point, I should be holding `grey_block_1` while `orange_block_1` is on top of `grey_block_2`. This hasn't happened in the steps I've outlined.

Constraint 12 says at some point, `orange_block_1` should have a block on top. This would happen if I put a block on top of `orange_block_1`.

But, constraint 13 complicates this. It says if `orange_block_1` ever has a block on top, then at an earlier state, either `purple_block_1` is on top of `red_block_1` or `grey_block_2` is not on the table. We don't have a state where `purple_block_1` is on top of `red_block_1` in the steps I've outlined, but we did have `grey_block_2` not on the table.

Ok, I'm starting to weave a tangled web here. Let me start fresh and approach the problem differently.

First, a clearer game plan:
1. Ensure `purple_block_1` is never on the table (constraint 8).
2. Meet all the "at some point" constraints, one by one.
3. Ensure all the "if-then" constraints are satisfied by ensuring the "then" part if the "if" part ever becomes true.
4. End with `orange_block_1` on top of `blue_block_1` (the goal).

The constraints specify specific goals to help me move through the state space I guess. Let's now try again and be more careful, ensuring all constraints are met:

Initial state:
- `grey_block_1` on table with `white_block_1`, `blue_block_1`, and `purple_block_1` stacked on top
- `grey_block_2` on table with `red_block_1` on top
- `orange_block_1` on table
- not holding any block

Constraint 8 says `purple_block_1` should never be on the table. So whenever I move `purple_block_1`, I need to stack it on another block or keep holding it.

1. `unstack purple_block_1 blue_block_1` (now I'm holding `purple_block_1`)
2. `stack purple_block_1 orange_block_1` (to avoid violating constraint 8)
3. `unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1` (now I'm holding `blue_block_1`)
4. `stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1` (to satisfy constraint 2, which says at some point `purple_block_1` should have a block on top)

At this point, I've satisfied constraints 2 and 8 (partially, since I need to ensure `purple_block_1` is never on the table throughout). I also have `blue_block_1` on top of `purple_block_1`, which is on top of `orange_block_1`.

Next, I need to satisfy constraint 3, which says if `purple_block_1` ever has a block on top (which it does now), then at an earlier state, either `white_block_1` is on the table or `grey_block_2` is not on the table. So I'll need to make either of those conditions true before moving forward.

Let's move `grey_block_2` off the table:

5. `unstack red_block_1 grey_block_2` (I'm now holding `red_block_1`)
6. `putdown red_block_1` (to free up my hand)
7. `pickup grey_block_2` (I'm now holding `grey_block_2`, making it not on the table, satisfying part of constraint 3)
8. `putdown grey_block_2` (to free up my hand)

We have to place it somewhere, but I want to make sure constraint 9 is satisfied as well. Constraint 9 says at some point, `grey_block_2` is not on top of `red_block_1`. This is already satisfied at this stage, and all prevoous stages.

Now, let's focus on constraint 13, which says if `orange_block_1` ever has a block on top (which it does now), then at an earlier state, either `purple_block_1` is on top of `red_block_1` or `grey_block_2` is not on the table. The latter has been achieved, so we're good on this constraint as well.

Continuing:

9. `unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1` (I'm now holding `white_block_1`, satisfying constraint 14)
10. `stack white_block_1 red_block_1` (just to place it somewhere for now)
11. `pickup grey_block_1` (I'm now holding `grey_block_1`)

Now, to satisfy constraint 1, I need to have `orange_block_1` on top of `grey_block_2` while I'm holding `grey_block_1`. But `orange_block_1` currently has `purple_block_1` and `blue_block_1` stacked on top of it. I'll need to reconsider...

Maybe, I can stack the blocks in a way to satisfy multiple constraints at once.

Let's see... If I have `purple_block_1` on top of `red_block_1` at some point, I'll satisfy one of the conditions mentioned in constraint 13.

So let's go with a different approach:

1. `unstack purple_block_1 blue_block_1` (now I'm holding `purple_block_1`)
2. `unstack red_block_1 grey_block_2` (to remove `red_block_1` from `grey_block_2`)
3. `stack purple_block_1 red_block_1` (to partially fulfilling the condition mentioned in constraint 13)
4. `unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1` (now I'm holding `blue_block_1`)
5. `putdown blue_block_1` (to satisfy constraint 11, which says at some point, `blue_block_1` is on the table or I'm holding `red_block_1`)

Here, we've satisfied constrains 8 (partially), 11, and we've set things up for constraint 13.

Now, let's satisfy constraint 5, which says at some point, `blue_block_1` is not on top of `white_block_1` (which is true now) and `grey_block_2` is on top of `red_block_1`:

6. `pickup grey_block_2` (now I'm holding `grey_block_2`)
7. `unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1` (to make way for `grey_block_2` to be on top of `red_block_1`)
8. `stack purple_block_1 blue_block_1` (to keep `purple_block_1` off the table)
9. `stack grey_block_2 red_block_1` (to satisfy the second part of constraint 5, I already satisfied the first part)

Alright, now constraint 5 is satisfied. And since we have `grey_block_2` off the table momentarily, it also helps with constraint 3.

Let's continue for constraint 14 (at some point, I should be holding `white_block_1`):

10. `unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1` (now I'm holding `white_block_1`, satisfying constraint 14)
11. `unstack purple_block_1 blue_block_1` (to make way)
12. `stack purple_block_1 white_block_1` (to keep `purple_block_1` off the table)
13. `pickup grey_block_1` (now I'm holding `grey_block_1`)

Now, for constraint 1, I need to have `orange_block_1` on top of `grey_block_2` while I'm holding `grey_block_1`:

14. `pickup orange_block_1` (now I'm holding `orange_block_1`)
15. `unstack grey_block_2 red_block_1` (to make way)
16. `stack orange_block_1 grey_block_2` (to set up for constraint 1)
17. `pickup grey_block_1` (now I'm holding `grey_block_1` while `orange_block_1` is on top of `grey_block_2`, satisfying constraint 1)

Now, for constraint 4, I need to have `grey_block_1` on top of `white_block_1`:

18. `unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1` (to make way)
19. `stack purple_block_1 orange_block_1` (to keep `purple_block_1` off the table)
20. `stack grey_block_1 white_block_1` (to satisfy constraint 4, which says at some point, `grey_block_1` should be on top of `white_block_1`)

At this point, I've satisfied constraints 1, 4, 5, 8 (so far), 11, and 14.

Now, for constraint 6, I need to hold `orange_block_1` at some point:

21. `unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1` (to make way)
22. `stack purple_block_1 red_block_1` (to keep `purple_block_1` off the table)
23. `unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_2` (now I'm holding `orange_block_1`, satisfying constraint 6)

Now, for constraint 7, after holding `orange_block_1`, `purple_block_1` should be on top of `orange_block_1` and have a block on top:

24. `putdown orange_block_1` (to place it somewhere temporarily)
25. `unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1` (to make way)
26. `stack purple_block_1 orange_block_1` (to satisfy the first part of constraint 7)
27. `pickup blue_block_1` (to set up for placing on top of `purple_block_1`)
28. `stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1` (to satisfy the second part of constraint 7)

Now, for the goal, I need to have `orange_block_1` on top of `blue_block_1`:

29. `unstack blue_block_1 purple_block_1` (to make way)
30. `stack blue_block_1 white_block_1` (to keep it somewhere for now)
31. `unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1` (to make way)
32. `stack purple_block_1 grey_block_2` (to keep `purple_block_1` off the table)
33. `pickup orange_block_1` (to set up for the goal)
34. `unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1` (to make way)
35. `putdown blue_block_1` (to prepare for the final goal)
36. `stack orange_block_1 blue_block_1` (to achieve the goal)

But has constraint 10 been satisfied? It says if `grey_block_2` is ever not on top of `red_block_1`, then at the same state or a later state, `purple_block_1` should have a block on top. What about constraint 9?

We actually already satisfied constraint 9. The constraint said: At some point, `grey_block_2` is not on top of `red_block_1`. We had a state where `red_block_1` was on top of `grey_block_2`, and later we had a state where `grey_block_2` was not on `red_block_1` but rather on the table.

As for constraint 10, it states: If `grey_block_2` is ever not on top of `red_block_1`, then at the same state or a later state, `purple_block_1` should have a block on top. This means that if the condition is ever met, the requirement must also be met. In our case, `grey_block_2` was indeed not on top of `red_block_1` for many states, and during some of those states, namely after step 28, `purple_block_1` did have a block on top. So, constraint 10 is satisfied.

Let's add a check for constraint 12 to be sure: at some point, `orange_block_1` should have a block on top.

Before step 24 when the state was (before `orange_block_1` is picked up):
- `purple_block_1` on top of `orange_block_1`

So, constraint 12 is also satisfied.

Let's double-check all constraints:

Constraint 1: At some point, I should be holding `grey_block_1` while `orange_block_1` is on top of `grey_block_2`. Satisfied at step 17.

Constraint 2: At some point, `purple_block_1` should have a block on top of it. Satisfied at step 28.

Constraint 3: If `purple_block_1` ever has a block on top, then at an earlier state, either `white_block_1` is on the table or `grey_block_2` is not on the table. Satisfied, as before step 28, we had `grey_block_2` not on the table at step 7.

Constraint 4: At some point, `grey_block_1` should be on top of `white_block_1`. Satisfied at step 20.

Constraint 5: At some point, `blue_block_1` is not on top of `white_block_1` and `grey_block_2` is on top of `red_block_1`. Satisfied at step 9.

Constraint 6: At some point, I should be holding `orange_block_1`. Satisfied at step 23.

Constraint 7: If I'm ever holding `orange_block_1`, then at the same state or a later state, `purple_block_1` should have a block on top and `purple_block_1` should be on top of `orange_block_1`. Satisfied at step 28.

Constraint 8: `purple_block_1` should never be on the table. Satisfied; we always moved it from one block to another without ever placing it on the table.

Constraint 9: At some point, `grey_block_2` is not on top of `red_block_1`. Satisfied in the initial state.

Constraint 10: If `grey_block_2` is ever not on top of `red_block_1`, then at the same state or a later state, `purple_block_1` should have a block on top. Satisfied at step 28.

Constraint 11: At some point, either `blue_block_1` is on the table or I'm holding `red_block_1`. Satisfied at step 5.

Constraint 12: At some point, `orange_block_1` should have a block on top. Satisfied at step 27.

Constraint 13: If `orange_block_1` ever has a block on top, then at an earlier state, either `purple_block_1` is on top of `red_block_1` or `grey_block_2` is not on the table. Satisfied at step 7 (when `grey_block_2` is not on the table).

Constraint 14: At some point, I should be holding `white_block_1`. Satisfied at step 10.

I think the high-level plan is correct. Let me now translate this plan to actual actions. Let's rewrite the plan carefully, ensuring that the preconditions for each action are met:

Initial state:
- `grey_block_1` on table with `white_block_1`, `blue_block_1`, and `purple_block_1` stacked on top

Preconditions: `blue_block_1` is clear, it's on top of `purple_block_1`, and I'm not holding anything.
Effects: I'm holding `blue_block_1`, `purple_block_1` is clear, and `blue_block_1` is no longer on top of `purple_block_1`.

14. `putdown blue_block_1`
Preconditions: I'm holding `blue_block_1`.
Effects: `blue_block_1` is on the table, `blue_block_1` is clear, and I'm not holding anything.

15. `unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1`
Preconditions: `purple_block_1` is clear, it's on top of `orange_block_1`, and I'm not holding anything.
Effects: I'm holding `purple_block_1`, `orange_block_1` is clear, and `purple_block_1` is no longer on top of `orange_block_1`.

16. `stack purple_block_1 grey_block_2`
Preconditions: I'm holding `purple_block_1` and `grey_block_2` is clear.

17. `pickup orange_block_1`
Preconditions: `orange_block_1` is clear, it's on the table, and I'm not holding anything.
Effects: I'm holding `orange_block_1` and `orange_block_1` is no longer on the table.

18. `stack orange_block_1 grey_block_1`
Preconditions: I'm holding `orange_block_1` and `grey_block_1` is clear.
Effects: `orange_block_1` is on top of `grey_block_1`, `orange_block_1` is clear, and I'm not holding anything.

I was moving blocks during the initial planning, but now that I'm checking preconditions, I realize I need to be more careful. Let's continue:

19. `pickup grey_block_1`
Preconditions: `orange_block_1` is on top of `grey_block_1`, so `grey_block_1` is not clear. This action's preconditions are not met. I need to reconsider.

Let me reorganize the steps to ensure the preconditions are met at each stage. The issue with trying to pick up `grey_block_1` is that it has `orange_block_1` on top. I need to remove `orange_block_1` first.

Let's try again, starting from the beginning. Also, step 17 above says I pick up `orange_block_1` just to put it on `grey_block_1`, which I then pick up again. That's needlessly complicated and I think a bug.

Initial state:
- `grey_block_1` on table with `white_block_1`, `blue_block_1`, and `purple_block_1` stacked on top
- `grey_block_2` on table with `red_block_1` on top
- `orange_block_1` on table
- not holding any block

1. `unstack purple_block_1 blue_block_1` (to start dismantling the tower)
2. `stack purple_block_1 orange_block_1` (to keep `purple_block_1` off the table)
3. `unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1` (continuing dismantling)
4. `putdown blue_block_1` (to satisfy constraint 11)
5. `unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1` (to satisfy constraint 14, i.e., holding `white_block_1` at some point)
6. `stack white_block_1 blue_block_1` (to place `white_block_1` somewhere)
7. `pickup grey_block_1` (to free up the table a bit)
8. `stack grey_block_1 white_block_1` (to satisfy constraint 4, i.e., `grey_block_1` on top of `white_block_1` at some point)
9. `unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1` (to make way for `orange_block_1`)
10. `stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1` (to keep `purple_block_1` off the table)
11. `unstack red_block_1 grey_block_2` (to make way for `grey_block_2`)
12. `putdown red_block_1` (to free up the hand)
13. `pickup grey_block_2` (to satisfy part of constraint 3, i.e., `grey_block_2` not on the table)
14. `stack grey_block_2 red_block_1` (to satisfy constraint 5, i.e., `grey_block_2` on top of `red_block_1`)
15. `pickup orange_block_1` (to satisfy constraint 6, i.e., holding `orange_block_1` at some point)
16. `stack orange_block_1 grey_block_2` (to set up for constraint 1)
17. `unstack purple_block_1 grey_block_1` (to access `grey_block_1`)
18. `stack purple_block_1 orange_block_1` (to satisfy constraint 7, i.e., `purple_block_1` on top of `orange_block_1`)
19. `unstack grey_block_1 white_block_1` (to set up for constraint 1)
20. `pickup grey_block_1` (to satisfy constraint 1, i.e., holding `grey_block_1` while `orange_block_1` is on top of `grey_block_2`)
21. `putdown grey_block_1` (to free up the hand)
22. `pickup blue_block_1` (to set up for stacking)
23. `stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1` (to satisfy the second part of constraint 7, i.e., a block on top of `purple_block_1` after holding `orange_block_1`)
24. `unstack blue_block_1 purple_block_1` (to make way for the goal)
25. `putdown blue_block_1` (to set up for the goal)
26. `unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1` (to make way for `orange_block_1`)
27. `stack purple_block_1 white_block_1` (to keep `purple_block_1` off the table)
28. `unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_2` (to set up for the goal)
29. `stack orange_block_1 blue_block_1` (to achieve the final goal, `orange_block_1` on top of `blue_block_1`)

Let me double-check the constraints:

1. At some point, I should be holding `grey_block_1` while `orange_block_1` is on top of `grey_block_2`. Satisfied at step 20.
2. At some point, `purple_block_1` should have a block on top of it. Satisfied at step 23.
3. If `purple_block_1` ever has a block on top, then at an earlier state, either `white_block_1` is on the table or `grey_block_2` is not on the table. Satisfied at step 13, before the condition in step 23.
4. At some point, `grey_block_1` should be on top of `white_block_1`. Satisfied at step 8.
5. At some point, `blue_block_1` is not on top of `white_block_1` and `grey_block_2` is on top of `red_block_1`. Satisfied at step 14.
6. At some point, I should be holding `orange_block_1`. Satisfied at step 15.
7. If I'm ever holding `orange_block_1`, then at the same state or a later state, `purple_block_1` should have a block on top and `purple_block_1` should be on top of `orange_block_1`. Satisfied at steps 18 and 23.
8. `purple_block_1` should never be on the table. Satisfied; we've kept `purple_block_1` off the table by always stacking it on another block.
9. At some point, `grey_block_2` is not on top of `red_block_1`. Satisfied in the initial state and at many other points.
10. If `grey_block_2` is ever not on top of `red_block_1`, then at the same state or a later state, `purple_block_1` should have a block on top. Satisfied at step 23.
11. At some point, either `blue_block_1` is on the table or I'm holding `red_block_1`. Satisfied at step 4 and 11.
12. At some point, `orange_block_1` should have a block on top. Satisfied at step 18.
13. If `orange_block_1` ever has a block on top, then at an earlier state, either `purple_block_1` is on top of `red_block_1` or `grey_block_2` is not on the table. Satisfied at step 13, before the condition in step 18.
14. At some point, I should be holding `white_block_1`. Satisfied at step 5.

All constraints are satisfied, and the plan achieves the goal of having `orange_block_1` on top of `blue_block_1`.

Actually, we should make sure `purple_block_1` is off the table at the very end of the plan (since constraint 8 states it should never be on the table). Let me check the state after the last step:

After step 29:
- `purple_block_1` is on top of `white_block_1`
- `orange_block_1` is on top of `blue_block_1`
- `grey_block_2` is on top of `red_block_1`
- `grey_block_1` is on the table
- not holding any block
- `purple_block_1` is not on the table, thus constraint 8 is still satisfied

Let's also make sure the preconditions are met for each of the steps of our plan:

1. `unstack purple_block_1 blue_block_1`
Preconditions: `purple_block_1` is clear, it's on top of `blue_block_1`, and I'm not holding anything. All satisfied in the initial state.

2. `stack purple_block_1 orange_block_1`
Preconditions: I'm holding `purple_block_1` and `orange_block_1` is clear. Both satisfied after step 1.

3. `unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1`
Preconditions: `blue_block_1` is clear (it's no longer has `purple_block_1` on top), it's on top of `white_block_1`, and I'm not holding anything. All satisfied after step 2.

4. `putdown blue_block_1`
Preconditions: I'm holding `blue_block_1`. Satisfied after step 3.

5. `unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1`
Preconditions: `white_block_1` is clear, it's on top of `grey_block_1`, and I'm not holding anything. All satisfied after step 4.

6. `stack white_block_1 blue_block_1`
Preconditions: I'm holding `white_block_1` and `blue_block_1` is clear. Both satisfied after step 5.

7. `pickup grey_block_1`
Preconditions: `grey_block_1` is clear, it's on the table, and I'm not holding anything. All satisfied after step 6.

8. `stack grey_block_1 white_block_1`
Preconditions: I'm holding `grey_block_1` and `white_block_1` is clear. Both satisfied after step 7.

9. `unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1`
Preconditions: `purple_block_1` is clear, it's on top of `orange_block_1`, and I'm not holding anything. All satisfied after step 8.

10. `stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1`
Preconditions: I'm holding `purple_block_1` and `grey_block_1` is clear. Both satisfied after step 9.

11. `unstack red_block_1 grey_block_2`
Preconditions: `red_block_1` is clear, it's on top of `grey_block_2`, and I'm not holding anything. All satisfied after step 10.

12. `putdown red_block_1`
Preconditions: I'm holding `red_block_1`. Satisfied after step 11.

13. `pickup grey_block_2`
Preconditions: `grey_block_2` is clear, it's on the table, and I'm not holding anything. All satisfied after step 12.

14. `stack grey_block_2 red_block_1`
Preconditions: I'm holding `grey_block_2` and `red_block_1` is clear. Both satisfied after step 13.

15. `pickup orange_block_1`
Preconditions: `orange_block_1` is clear (it no longer has `purple_block_1` on top), it's on the table, and I'm not holding anything. All satisfied after step 14.

16. `stack orange_block_1 grey_block_2`
Preconditions: I'm holding `orange_block_1` and `grey_block_2` is clear. Both satisfied after step 15.

17. `unstack purple_block_1 grey_block_1`
Preconditions: `purple_block_1` is clear, it's on top of `grey_block_1`, and I'm not holding anything. All satisfied after step 16.

18. `stack purple_block_1 orange_block_1`
Preconditions: I'm holding `purple_block_1` and `orange_block_1` is clear. Both satisfied after step 17.

19. `unstack grey_block_1 white_block_1`
Preconditions: `grey_block_1` is clear, it's on top of `white_block_1`, and I'm not holding anything. All satisfied after step 18.

20. `pickup grey_block_1`
Wait, the precondition fails because I just unstacked `grey_block_1`. I'd have to `putdown grey_block_1`. Let me adjust the plan:

19. `unstack grey_block_1 white_block_1`
Preconditions: `grey_block_1` is clear (it no longer has `purple_block_1` on top), it's on top of `white_block_1`, and I'm not holding anything. All satisfied after step 18.

20. `putdown grey_block_1`
Preconditions: I'm holding `grey_block_1`. Satisfied after step 19.

21. `pickup grey_block_1`
Preconditions: `grey_block_1` is clear, it's on the table, and I'm not holding anything. All satisfied after step 20.
This satisfies constraint 1 (holding `grey_block_1` while `orange_block_1` is on top of `grey_block_2`).

22. `putdown grey_block_1`
Preconditions: I'm holding `grey_block_1`. Satisfied after step 21.

I need to revise the remainder of the plan to ensure the preconditions are met for each action:

23. `pickup blue_block_1`
Preconditions: `blue_block_1` is clear, it's on the table, and I'm not holding anything. All satisfied after step 22.

24. `stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1`
Preconditions: I'm holding `blue_block_1` and `purple_block_1` is clear. Both satisfied after step 23.

25. `unstack blue_block_1 purple_block_1`
Preconditions: `blue_block_1` is clear, it's on top of `purple_block_1`, and I'm not holding anything. All satisfied after step 24.

26. `putdown blue_block_1`
Preconditions: I'm holding `blue_block_1`. Satisfied after step 25.

27. `unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1`
Preconditions: `purple_block_1` is clear, it's on top of `orange_block_1`, and I'm not holding anything. All satisfied after step 26.

28. `stack purple_block_1 white_block_1`
Preconditions: I'm holding `purple_block_1` and `white_block_1` is clear (after `grey_block_1` is removed in step 19). Both satisfied after step 27.

29. `unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_2`
Preconditions: `orange_block_1` is clear (it no longer has `purple_block_1` on top), it's on top of `grey_block_2`, and I'm not holding anything. All satisfied after step 28.

30. `stack orange_block_1 blue_block_1`
Preconditions: I'm holding `orange_block_1` and `blue_block_1` is clear. Both satisfied after step 29.

I think now we have a valid plan. Let me cross check once more that all constraints are met and the goal is achieved.

Ok I'm convinced we have a valid plan. Let's finalize the plan:

```
unstack purple_block_1 blue_block_1
stack purple_block_1 orange_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1
stack white_block_1 blue_block_1
pickup grey_block_1
stack grey_block_1 white_block_1
unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1
stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1
unstack red_block_1 grey_block_2
putdown red_block_1
pickup grey_block_2
stack grey_block_2 red_block_1
pickup orange_block_1
stack orange_block_1 grey_block_2
unstack purple_block_1 grey_block_1
stack purple_block_1 orange_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 white_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
pickup grey_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
pickup blue_block_1
stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 purple_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1
stack purple_block_1 white_block_1
unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_2
stack orange_block_1 blue_block_1
```

Hang on, let me double check the goal. We need to have "orange_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1", and our plan ends with precisely that, so we're good.

Let's actually double check the constraints one last time to be sure:
1. At some point, I should be holding `grey_block_1` while `orange_block_1` is on top of `grey_block_2`. Satisfied at step 21.
2. At some point, `purple_block_1` should have a block on top of it. Satisfied at step 24.
3. If `purple_block_1` ever has a block on top, then at an earlier state, either `white_block_1` is on the table or `grey_block_2` is not on the table. Satisfied at step 13 (we have `grey_block_2` not on the table), before the condition in step 24.
4. At some point, `grey_block_1` should be on top of `white_block_1`. Satisfied at step 8.
5. At some point, `blue_block_1` is not on top of `white_block_1` and `grey_block_2` is on top of `red_block_1`. Satisfied at step 14, where we have `blue_block_1` on the table and `grey_block_2` on top of `red_block_1`.
6. At some point, I should be holding `orange_block_1`. Satisfied at step 15 and 29.
7. If I'm ever holding `orange_block_1`, then at the same state or a later state, `purple_block_1` should have a block on top and `purple_block_1` should be on top of `orange_block_1`. Satisfied after step 15, at steps 18 and 24.
8. `purple_block_1` should never be on the table. Satisfied; we've kept `purple_block_1` off the table by always stacking it on another block.
9. At some point, `grey_block_2` is not on top of `red_block_1`. Satisfied in the initial state where `red_block_1` is on top of `grey_block_2`.
10. If `grey_block_2` is ever not on top of `red_block_1`, then at the same state or a later state, `purple_block_1` should have a block on top. Satisfied at step 24.
11. At some point, either `blue_block_1` is on the table or I'm holding `red_block_1`. Satisfied at step 4 and 11.
12. At some point, `orange_block_1` should have a block on top. Satisfied at step 18.
13. If `orange_block_1` ever has a block on top, then at an earlier state, either `purple_block_1` is on top of `red_block_1` or `grey_block_2` is not on the table. Satisfied at step 13, before the condition in step 18.
14. At some point, I should be holding `white_block_1`. Satisfied at step 5.

All constraints are satisfied, and the goal is achieved. Our final plan is:

```
unstack purple_block_1 blue_block_1
stack purple_block_1 orange_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
