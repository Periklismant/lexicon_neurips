**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_1**: This clears black_block_1 and allows access to the lower blocks. Green is placed on the table.

2. **Unstack black_block_1 from purple_block_1**: Now holding black_block_1. 

3. **Stack black_block_1 on green_block_1**: This satisfies constraint 15 (black on green) for later unstacking purple_block_1.

4. **Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_1**: Purple is now held, satisfying constraint 14. Brown_block_1 is clear.

5. **Putdown purple_block_1**: Purple is on the table.

6. **Pickup orange_block_1**: Satisfies constraint 11 (holding orange). 

7. **Stack orange_block_1 on brown_block_1**: Temporarily places orange on brown_block_1, partially satisfying constraint 1.

8. **Unstack brown_block_2 from yellow_block_1**: Now holding brown_block_2 while orange is on brown_block_1, fully satisfying constraint 1. Yellow_block_1 becomes clear, addressing constraints 3 and 6.

9. **Putdown brown_block_2**: Prepares for final steps.

10. **Unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_1**: Reverts the temporary stack to clear brown_block_1.

11. **Putdown orange_block_1**: Resets orange to the table for the final goal.

12. **Pickup brown_block_1 and stack on orange_block_1**: Achieves the goal. During this step:
   - brown_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 2).
   - orange_block_1 has a block on top (constraint 9), which was enabled by earlier unstacking brown_block_2 (constraint 10).
   - black_block_1 is on the table (step 3: putdown after unstacking) satisfies constraint 4.
