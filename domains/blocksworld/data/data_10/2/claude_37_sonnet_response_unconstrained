Let me analyze this planning problem step by step.

First, I'll define the initial state of the world:

1. Yellow_block_1 is on the table.
2. Brown_block_1 is on the table.
3. Brown_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1.
4. Purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1.
5. Black_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1.
6. Orange_block_1 is on the table.
7. Green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1.
8. Brown_block_2 is clear.
9. Orange_block_1 is clear.
10. Green_block_1 is clear.
11. The arm is not holding any block.

Here's a visual representation:

```
          green_block_1
               |
          black_block_1
               |
          purple_block_1    brown_block_2
               |                |
          brown_block_1    yellow_block_1    orange_block_1
             Table
```

The goal is to have brown_block_1 on top of orange_block_1.

Currently, brown_block_1 is on the table, and it has purple_block_1, black_block_1, and green_block_1 stacked on top of it. Also, orange_block_1 is on the table and is clear.

To achieve the goal, I need to:
1. Remove all blocks from on top of brown_block_1
2. Pick up brown_block_1
3. Stack brown_block_1 on top of orange_block_1

Let me develop the plan:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_1
2. Unstack black_block_1 from purple_block_1
3. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_1
4. Pickup brown_block_1 from the table
5. Stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_1

Now, let's check if this plan is valid according to the preconditions and effects of the actions:

Step 1: Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_1
Preconditions: green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, green_block_1 is clear, arm is not holding any block.
All preconditions are met.
Effects: green_block_1 is no longer on top of black_block_1, black_block_1 is clear, arm is holding green_block_1.

Step 2: After Step 1, the arm is holding green_block_1, so I need to put it down somewhere.
Option: Putdown green_block_1 on the table
Preconditions: Arm is holding green_block_1.
This precondition is met.
Effects: green_block_1 is on the table, green_block_1 is clear, arm is not holding any block.

Step 3: Unstack black_block_1 from purple_block_1
Preconditions: black_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1, black_block_1 is clear, arm is not holding any block.
All preconditions are met after Step 2.
Effects: black_block_1 is no longer on top of purple_block_1, purple_block_1 is clear, arm is holding black_block_1.

Step 4: After Step 3, the arm is holding black_block_1, so I need to put it down somewhere.
Option: Putdown black_block_1 on the table
Preconditions: Arm is holding black_block_1.
This precondition is met.
Effects: black_block_1 is on the table, black_block_1 is clear, arm is not holding any block.

Step 5: Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_1
Preconditions: purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1, purple_block_1 is clear, arm is not holding any block.
All preconditions are met after Step 4.
Effects: purple_block_1 is no longer on top of brown_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear, arm is holding purple_block_1.

Step 6: After Step 5, the arm is holding purple_block_1, so I need to put it down somewhere.
Option: Putdown purple_block_1 on the table
Preconditions: Arm is holding purple_block_1.
This precondition is met.
Effects: purple_block_1 is on the table, purple_block_1 is clear, arm is not holding any block.

Step 7: Pickup brown_block_1 from the table
Preconditions: brown_block_1 is clear, brown_block_1 is on the table, arm is not holding any block.
All preconditions are met after Step 6.
Effects: arm is holding brown_block_1, brown_block_1 is no longer on the table.

Step 8: Stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_1
Preconditions: Arm is holding brown_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear.
All preconditions are met after Step 7.
Effects: brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear, orange_block_1 is not clear, arm is not holding any block.

After Step 8, we have achieved the goal: brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1.

So the plan is:
1. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_1
2. Putdown green_block_1
3. Unstack black_block_1 from purple_block_1
4. Putdown black_block_1
5. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_1
6. Putdown purple_block_1
7. Pickup brown_block_1
8. Stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_1

This 8-step plan is valid and achieves the goal, satisfying all preconditions and producing the required effects at each step.

Let me check if there's a more optimal plan, i.e., a valid plan with fewer steps:

The key steps to achieve the goal are:
1. Get brown_block_1 clear by removing all blocks on top of it.
2. Pick up brown_block_1
3. Stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_1

Given the initial state, we need to remove 3 blocks from on top of brown_block_1 (purple_block_1, black_block_1, and green_block_1), and we need to do something with each of them after picking them up (either stack them somewhere else or put them on the table). 

The most efficient way is to put each block on the table, requiring 2 actions for each block (unstack and putdown). Then we need 2 more actions to pick up brown_block_1 and stack it on orange_block_1. 

That's 3 * 2 + 2 = 8 actions total, which matches our plan. So, our 8-step plan is optimal.

Let me verify the plan one more time to ensure it's correct:

Initial state:
```
          green_block_1
               |
          black_block_1
               |
          purple_block_1    brown_block_2
               |                |
          brown_block_1    yellow_block_1    orange_block_1
             Table
```

1. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_1
   - After this: Arm is holding green_block_1, black_block_1 is clear

2. Putdown green_block_1
   - After this: green_block_1 is on the table, arm is empty
   ```
             black_block_1 (clear)
                  |
             purple_block_1    brown_block_2 (clear)
                  |                |
             brown_block_1    yellow_block_1    orange_block_1 (clear)    green_block_1 (clear)
                Table
   ```

3. Unstack black_block_1 from purple_block_1
   - After this: Arm is holding black_block_1, purple_block_1 is clear
   
4. Putdown black_block_1
   - After this: black_block_1 is on the table, arm is empty
   ```
             purple_block_1 (clear)    brown_block_2 (clear)
                  |                        |
             brown_block_1            yellow_block_1    orange_block_1 (clear)    green_block_1 (clear)    black_block_1 (clear)
                Table
   ```

5. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_1
   - After this: Arm is holding purple_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear
   
6. Putdown purple_block_1
   - After this: purple_block_1 is on the table, arm is empty
   ```
             brown_block_1 (clear)    brown_block_2 (clear)
                                          |
                                     yellow_block_1    orange_block_1 (clear)    green_block_1 (clear)    black_block_1 (clear)    purple_block_1 (clear)
                Table
   ```

7. Pickup brown_block_1
   - After this: Arm is holding brown_block_1
   
8. Stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_1
   - After this: brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1, arm is empty
   ```
                                     brown_block_2 (clear)    brown_block_1 (clear)
                                          |                        |
                                     yellow_block_1            orange_block_1    green_block_1 (clear)    black_block_1 (clear)    purple_block_1 (clear)
                Table
   ```

The goal is achieved: brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1.

Our optimal plan is:
1. unstack green_block_1 black_block_1
2. putdown green_block_1
3. unstack black_block_1 purple_block_1
4. putdown black_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. pickup brown_block_1
8. stack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
