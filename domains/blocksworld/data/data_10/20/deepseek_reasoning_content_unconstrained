Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this Blocksworld problem. So, the goal is to get blue_block_1 on top of yellow_block_2. The initial state has several blocks on the table or stacked. Let me start by looking at the initial setup.

In the initial state:
- yellow_block_1 is on the table, with white_block_1 on top of it. And white_block_1 is clear.
- grey_block_1 is on the table with grey_block_2 on top. Grey_block_2 is clear.
- The other blocks (black_block_1, yellow_block_2, blue_block_1) are all on the table and clear.

So the target is blue_block_1 on yellow_block_2. Right now, both are on the table and clear. So to stack blue on yellow_2, I need to pick up blue and then stack it on yellow_2.

Wait, but the preconditions for stacking are that I'm holding the first block (blue) and the second block (yellow_2) is clear. Since yellow_2 is clear, that's good. But first, I need to pick up blue_block_1. Since it's on the table and clear, I can do that with a pickup action. Then stack it on yellow_2. So the plan would be:

1. pickup blue_block_1
2. stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2

But wait, let me check the preconditions for each step. For pickup, the block must be on the table, clear, and the arm is empty. Blue is on table, clear, and the arm is not holding anything initially. So step 1 is valid. Then, stack: I'm holding blue, and yellow_2 is clear. Yes. So stacking should work. That's a two-step plan. Is there anything blocking this? Let me check the constraints. The problem mentions that the plan must satisfy all constraints. But in the problem description, under the constraints section, it's empty. Wait, the user wrote "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but there's nothing after that. Maybe that's a formatting error. Or perhaps the original problem had constraints that didn't get copied here. Hmm. Wait, looking back at the user's problem statement: under the task, it says "A valid plan... must abide by the following constraints:" but then nothing follows. So maybe there are no additional constraints beyond the usual action preconditions. So maybe the plan is straightforward.

But wait, let's double-check the initial state again. Are there any blocks on top of blue_block_1 or yellow_block_2? No. Both are clear. So the steps are possible. So the optimal plan is just two actions: pickup blue, stack on yellow_2. That's the shortest possible. So why would the user ask for an optimal plan? Maybe I'm missing something. Let me verify each action's effects.

After pickup blue_block_1: The arm is holding it, and blue is no longer on the table. Then stack blue on yellow_2. After stacking, blue is on yellow_2, which is the goal. That's correct. So this should work. Therefore, the optimal plan is two steps. But wait, maybe the initial state has some other blocks that need to be moved? Let's see. The goal is only about blue and yellow_2. The other blocks don't need to be touched. So no, the other blocks can stay as they are. Therefore, the minimal plan is indeed two steps. I think that's right. So the answer should be those two actions.
