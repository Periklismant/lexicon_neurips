Let's analyze the problem:

1. We have a Blocksworld problem with 7 blocks:
   - yellow_block_1
   - black_block_1
   - grey_block_1
   - grey_block_2
   - white_block_1
   - yellow_block_2
   - blue_block_1

2. The initial state is:
   - yellow_block_1 is on the table
   - black_block_1 is on the table
   - grey_block_1 is on the table
   - grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1
   - white_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
   - yellow_block_2 is on the table
   - blue_block_1 is on the table
   - black_block_1 is clear
   - grey_block_2 is clear
   - white_block_1 is clear
   - yellow_block_2 is clear
   - blue_block_1 is clear
   - you are not holding any block

3. The goal state is:
   - blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2

4. The available actions are:
   - pickup x
   - putdown x
   - stack x y
   - unstack x y

Let's create a plan:

I need to ensure blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2.

In the initial state, blue_block_1 is clear (no block on top of it) and on the table. yellow_block_2 is also clear and on the table. So I need to:

1. Pickup blue_block_1 from the table (which is possible because it's clear and I'm not holding any block).
2. Stack blue_block_1 on top of yellow_block_2 (which is possible because I'm holding blue_block_1 and yellow_block_2 is clear).

So the optimal plan is:

```
pickup blue_block_1
stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2
```

Let me check the validity of this plan:

For pickup blue_block_1:
Preconditions:
- blue_block_1 is clear ✓
- blue_block_1 is on the table ✓
- I'm not holding any block ✓

Effects:
- I'm holding blue_block_1 ✓
- blue_block_1 is no longer on the table ✓

For stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2:
Preconditions:
- I'm holding blue_block_1 ✓
- yellow_block_2 is clear ✓

Effects:
- blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2 ✓
- blue_block_1 is clear ✓
- yellow_block_2 is no longer clear ✓
- I'm no longer holding blue_block_1 ✓

The goal state "blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2" is achieved at the end of the plan.

So the optimal plan is:

```
pickup blue_block_1
stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2
```

Let me double-check to make sure this is optimal and valid.

Validity:
1. pickup blue_block_1
   - Preconditions: blue_block_1 is clear, on the table, and I'm not holding any block. ✓
   - Effects: I'm holding blue_block_1, and it's not on the table anymore. ✓

2. stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2
   - Preconditions: I'm holding blue_block_1, and yellow_block_2 is clear. ✓
   - Effects: blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2, blue_block_1 is clear, yellow_block_2 is not clear anymore, and I'm not holding blue_block_1. ✓

The goal "blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2" is indeed achieved after executing these two actions.

Optimality:
The goal is to have blue_block_1 on top of yellow_block_2. In the initial state, blue_block_1 is on the table, and we need to move it on top of yellow_block_2. There's no way to do this in fewer than two moves (pickup and stack).

Therefore, the plan is both valid and optimal.
