Alright, let's break down this planning problem.

First, I need to understand the initial state:
- yellow_block_1 is on the table, with white_block_1 on top of it.
- black_block_1 is on the table and is clear.
- grey_block_1 is on the table, with grey_block_2 on top of it.
- yellow_block_2 is on the table and is clear.
- blue_block_1 is on the table and is clear.
- The robotic arm is not holding any block.

The goal is to have blue_block_1 on top of yellow_block_2.

Now, let's go through the constraints:

1. At some point, the arm must be holding grey_block_1, and blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1.
2. At some point, grey_block_1 must be clear.
3. At some point, either grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, or yellow_block_1 is clear.
4. At some point, yellow_block_1 is not on the table and black_block_1 is not clear.
5. At some point, blue_block_1 is not on the table.
6. If blue_block_1 is not on the table, then there must be an earlier state where yellow_block_2 has a block on top of it.
7. At some point, yellow_block_2 is clear.
8. If yellow_block_2 is clear, then either blue_block_1 must be on top of black_block_1 or grey_block_2 must be on the table at that state or after.
9. At some point, the arm must be holding blue_block_1.
10. If the arm is holding blue_block_1, then there must be an earlier state where grey_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1.
11. At some point, black_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1.
12. At some point, black_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_2.
13. If black_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_2, then the arm must be holding white_block_1 at that state or after.
14. At some point, grey_block_2 is not on top of black_block_1.
15. If grey_block_2 is not on top of black_block_1, then white_block_1 must have a block on top of it at that state or after.

Now, let me analyze these constraints to figure out a valid plan.

Constraint 1 says that at some point, blue_block_1 must be on top of black_block_1, and we need to be holding grey_block_1. 

Constraint 10 says that if we're holding blue_block_1, then grey_block_2 must have been on top of blue_block_1 at an earlier state. But in the initial state, grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1. This means we need to move grey_block_2 to be on top of blue_block_1 at some point.

Let's start by thinking about the steps to move grey_block_2:
1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1.
2. Stack grey_block_2 on blue_block_1.

This satisfies part of Constraint 10.

Next, we need to pick up grey_block_1 (which is now clear) and have blue_block_1 on top of black_block_1. This is required by Constraint 1. 

Before we can pick up grey_block_1, we need to remove grey_block_2 from blue_block_1. And we need to put blue_block_1 on top of black_block_1:
3. Unstack grey_block_2 from blue_block_1.
4. Stack grey_block_2 on some other block or the table.
5. Pickup blue_block_1.
6. Stack blue_block_1 on black_block_1.
7. Pickup grey_block_1.

This satisfies Constraint 1.

Constraint 3 says that at some point, either grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, or yellow_block_1 is clear. 

Since white_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1 in the initial state, if we want to make yellow_block_1 clear, we'd need to move white_block_1. But we're already holding grey_block_1, so that's not an option right now. The other option is to move grey_block_1 to be on top of white_block_1:
8. Stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1.

This satisfies Constraint 3.

Constraint 4 says that at some point, yellow_block_1 is not on the table and black_block_1 is not clear. 

We've already made black_block_1 not clear by stacking blue_block_1 on it. Now, we need to move yellow_block_1 off the table. But yellow_block_1 has white_block_1 on top of it, and white_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top of it. So we need to:
9. Unstack grey_block_1 from white_block_1.
10. Stack grey_block_1 on some other block or the table.
11. Unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1.
12. Stack white_block_1 on some other block or the table.
13. Pickup yellow_block_1.
14. Stack yellow_block_1 on some block (not the table).

Alright, now I need to satisfy Constraint 4 (yellow_block_1 is not on the table and black_block_1 is not clear). I've already made black_block_1 not clear by stacking blue_block_1 on it. Now, I need to move yellow_block_1 off the table.

But wait, if I stack yellow_block_1 on some block, then blue_block_1 (which is on top of black_block_1) will no longer be on top of black_block_1. This might not work out.

Let me think about this in a different way.

Constraint 11 says that at some point, black_block_1 must be on top of yellow_block_1. Let's work towards that.

To achieve this, we need to:
- Ensure yellow_block_1 is clear (which means moving white_block_1 off it).
- Ensure black_block_1 is clear (which means moving any block on top of it).
- Unstack black_block_1 from the table.
- Stack black_block_1 on yellow_block_1.

Ok, wait. I think I should make a plan step by step and ensure all the constraints are satisfied.

Let's start with the initial state:
- yellow_block_1 is on the table, with white_block_1 on top of it.
- black_block_1 is on the table and is clear.
- grey_block_1 is on the table, with grey_block_2 on top of it.
- yellow_block_2 is on the table and is clear.
- blue_block_1 is on the table and is clear.
- The robotic arm is not holding any block.

Now, I need to figure out a sequence of actions to achieve our goal: blue_block_1 on top of yellow_block_2.

Constraint 1: Ensure arm is holding grey_block_1, and blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1.
Constraint 10: Before holding blue_block_1, ensure grey_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1 at an earlier state.

So I need to first move grey_block_2 off grey_block_1, place it on blue_block_1, then move it again, put blue_block_1 on black_block_1, and finally pick up grey_block_1.

Let's do it step by step:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1.
   - Now the arm is holding grey_block_2, grey_block_1 is clear, and grey_block_2 is not on top of grey_block_1.

2. Stack grey_block_2 on blue_block_1.
   - Now the arm is not holding any block, grey_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1, and blue_block_1 is not clear.
   - Constraint 10 is now partially satisfied.

3. Unstack grey_block_2 from blue_block_1.
   - Now the arm is holding grey_block_2, blue_block_1 is clear, and grey_block_2 is not on top of blue_block_1.

4. Stack grey_block_2 on yellow_block_2.
   - Now the arm is not holding any block, grey_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_2, and yellow_block_2 is not clear.
   - This is relevant for Constraint 6.

5. Pickup blue_block_1.
   - Now the arm is holding blue_block_1, and blue_block_1 is not on the table.
   - Constraint 5 is satisfied.
   - Constraint 6 is satisfied since yellow_block_2 has a block on top of it at an earlier state (step 4).

6. Stack blue_block_1 on black_block_1.
   - Now the arm is not holding any block, blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, and black_block_1 is not clear.

7. Pickup grey_block_1.
   - Now the arm is holding grey_block_1, and grey_block_1 is not on the table.
   - Constraint 1 is satisfied: Arm is holding grey_block_1 and blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1.

Wait, before I move on, let's check if Constraint 2 (grey_block_1 is clear) is satisfied.
After step 1, grey_block_1 is clear. So Constraint 2 is satisfied.

Constraint 3: Either grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, or yellow_block_1 is clear.
Let's stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1:

8. Stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1.
   - Now the arm is not holding any block, grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, and white_block_1 is not clear.
   - Constraint 3 is satisfied: grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1.

Constraint 4: yellow_block_1 is not on the table and black_block_1 is not clear.
Right now, black_block_1 is not clear (it has blue_block_1 on it), but yellow_block_1 is on the table. We need to move yellow_block_1 off the table.

Hmm, but to do that, I'd need to move white_block_1 off yellow_block_1 first, which is not trivial because white_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top of it.

Let's think about what needs to happen next to satisfy our constraints...

Constraint 11: black_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1.
For this, I need to:
- Clear yellow_block_1 (which means removing white_block_1 and any blocks on top of it, if any).
- Clear black_block_1 (which means removing blue_block_1 from it).
- Move black_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1.

Let's continue:

9. Unstack grey_block_1 from white_block_1.
   - Now the arm is holding grey_block_1, and white_block_1 is clear.

10. Stack grey_block_1 on the table.
   - Now the arm is not holding any block, and grey_block_1 is on the table.

11. Unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1.
   - Now the arm is holding white_block_1, and yellow_block_1 is clear.

Constraint 13 says that if black_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_2, then the arm must be holding white_block_1 at that state or after. 
In the initial state, black_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_2, and now, after step 11, the arm is holding white_block_1. So, Constraint 13 is satisfied.

Now, I need to clear black_block_1 (so I need to move blue_block_1 off it), and then put black_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1 to satisfy Constraint 11.

12. Stack white_block_1 on grey_block_2.
   - Now the arm is not holding any block, white_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2, and grey_block_2 is not clear.

13. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1.
   - Now the arm is holding blue_block_1, and black_block_1 is clear.
   - Constraint 9 is satisfied: Arm is holding blue_block_1.

14. Pickup black_block_1.
   - I can't do this, because the arm is holding blue_block_1.

I need to put down blue_block_1 before picking up black_block_1. But I also want to ensure that Constraint 10 is fully satisfied, which says:
"If the arm is holding blue_block_1, then there must be an earlier state where grey_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1."

Grey_block_2 was on top of blue_block_1 at step 2, and now the arm is holding blue_block_1 at step 13. So Constraint 10 is satisfied.

14. Stack blue_block_1 on grey_block_1.
   - Now the arm is not holding any block, blue_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1, and grey_block_1 is not clear.

15. Pickup black_block_1.
   - Now the arm is holding black_block_1, and black_block_1 is not on the table.

16. Stack black_block_1 on yellow_block_1.
   - Now the arm is not holding any block, black_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, and yellow_block_1 is not clear.
   - Constraint 11 is satisfied: black_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1.
   - Constraint 4 is satisfied: yellow_block_1 is not on the table (it's under black_block_1) and black_block_1 is not clear (since there's a block on it).

Oops, I made a mistake. By saying "yellow_block_1 is not on the table", I was thinking that it's not directly on the table anymore, but that's not right. yellow_block_1 is on the table in the initial state and stacking a block on top of it doesn't make it "not on the table". So Constraint 4 is not satisfied by step 16.

Let's modify our plan:

15. Pickup black_block_1.
   - Now the arm is holding black_block_1, and black_block_1 is not on the table.

16. Stack black_block_1 on yellow_block_1.
   - Now the arm is not holding any block, black_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, and yellow_block_1 is not clear.
   - Constraint 11 is satisfied: black_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1.

17. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_2.
   - Now the arm is holding white_block_1, and grey_block_2 is clear.

18. Stack white_block_1 on black_block_1.
   - Now the arm is not holding any block, white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, and black_block_1 is not clear.

Constraint 14 says that at some point, grey_block_2 is not on top of black_block_1. In the initial state and in all the steps so far, grey_block_2 has never been on top of black_block_1, so this constraint is satisfied.

Constraint 15 says that if grey_block_2 is not on top of black_block_1, then white_block_1 must have a block on top of it at that state or after. After step 18, white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1 and doesn't have a block on top of it. So Constraint 15 is not yet satisfied.

Let's continue with our plan:

19. Unstack blue_block_1 from grey_block_1.
   - Now the arm is holding blue_block_1, and grey_block_1 is clear.

20. Stack blue_block_1 on white_block_1.
   - Now the arm is not holding any block, blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, and white_block_1 is not clear.
   - Constraint 15 is satisfied: white_block_1 has a block on top of it.

Now, let's check the goal: blue_block_1 on top of yellow_block_2.

Currently, blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, and we need to move it to be on top of yellow_block_2.

21. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1.
   - Now the arm is holding blue_block_1, and white_block_1 is clear.

Wait, Constraint 15 is no longer satisfied! But I think the constraint is about ensuring that at some state or after, white_block_1 is not clear. We satisfied it at step 20, so we should be good.

Constraint 7 says that at some point, yellow_block_2 is clear. Currently, grey_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_2, so we need to remove it.

22. Unstack grey_block_2 from yellow_block_2.
   - Now the arm is holding grey_block_2, and yellow_block_2 is clear.
   - Constraint 7 is satisfied: yellow_block_2 is clear.

Constraint 8 says that if yellow_block_2 is clear, then either blue_block_1 must be on top of black_block_1 or grey_block_2 must be on the table at that state or after.

Currently, blue_block_1 is not on top of black_block_1, and grey_block_2 is not on the table (the arm is holding it). So we need to put grey_block_2 on the table or stack blue_block_1 on black_block_1.

Let's put grey_block_2 on the table:

23. Putdown grey_block_2.
   - Now the arm is not holding any block, grey_block_2 is on the table, and the arm is free.
   - Constraint 8 is satisfied: grey_block_2 is on the table.

Now, let's pick up blue_block_1 (which the arm was holding previously, but then we dealt with Constraint 7) and stack it on yellow_block_2 to achieve our goal:

24. Stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_2.
   - Now the arm is not holding any block, blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2, and yellow_block_2 is not clear.
   - Goal is achieved: blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2.

But wait, we still need to satisfy Constraint 4, which says that at some point, yellow_block_1 is not on the table and black_block_1 is not clear.

Currently, yellow_block_1 is on the table (with black_block_1 and white_block_1 on top of it) and black_block_1 is not clear (it has white_block_1 on top of it). So the second part of Constraint 4 is satisfied, but we still need to satisfy the first part.

Let's update our plan:

24. Pickup grey_block_2.
   - Now the arm is holding grey_block_2.

25. Stack grey_block_2 on white_block_1.
   - Now the arm is not holding any block, grey_block_2 is on top of white_block_1, and white_block_1 is not clear.

26. Unstack black_block_1 from yellow_block_1.
   - Now the arm is holding black_block_1, and yellow_block_1 is clear.

27. Putdown black_block_1.
   - Now the arm is not holding any block, black_block_1 is on the table, and the arm is free.

28. Pickup yellow_block_1.
   - Now the arm is holding yellow_block_1, and yellow_block_1 is not on the table.
   - Part 1 of Constraint 4 is satisfied: yellow_block_1 is not on the table.

29. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1.
   - Now the arm is not holding any block, yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, and black_block_1 is not clear.
   - Constraint 4 is fully satisfied: yellow_block_1 is not on the table and black_block_1 is not clear.

30. Pickup blue_block_1.
   - Now the arm is holding blue_block_1.

31. Stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_2.
   - Now the arm is not holding any block, blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2, and yellow_block_2 is not clear.
   - Goal is achieved: blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2.

Let's double-check all constraints:

1. Grey_block_1 is held at the same time blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1: Satisfied at step 7.
2. Grey_block_1 is clear: Satisfied after step 1 and also after step 19.
3. Grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, or yellow_block_1 is clear: Satisfied at step 8 (grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1) and also at step 26 (yellow_block_1 is clear).
4. Yellow_block_1 is not on the table and black_block_1 is not clear: Satisfied at step 29.
5. Blue_block_1 is not on the table: Satisfied at step 5 and multiple steps after.
6. If blue_block_1 is not on the table, then there must be an earlier state where yellow_block_2 has a block on top of it: Satisfied because at step 4, grey_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_2, and blue_block_1 is not on the table at step 5.
7. Yellow_block_2 is clear: Satisfied at step 22.
8. If yellow_block_2 is clear, then either blue_block_1 must be on top of black_block_1 or grey_block_2 must be on the table: Satisfied at step 23 (grey_block_2 is on the table).
9. Arm must hold blue_block_1 at some point: Satisfied at step 5 and multiple steps after.
10. If arm is holding blue_block_1, then grey_block_2 must have been on top of blue_block_1 at an earlier state: Satisfied because grey_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1 at step 2, and the arm holds blue_block_1 at step 5.
11. Black_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1: Satisfied at step 16.
12. Black_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_2: Satisfied in the initial state and most steps, except it's now satisfied by negation.
13. If black_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_2, then the arm must be holding white_block_1 at that state or after: Satisfied at step 11.
14. Grey_block_2 is not on top of black_block_1: Satisfied in the initial state and all steps, as grey_block_2 is never on top of black_block_1.
15. If grey_block_2 is not on top of black_block_1, then white_block_1 must have a block on top of it at that state or after: Satisfied at step 20 and step 25.

Everything looks good! Let's finalize our plan.

Actually, there's a small issue: After step 28, we're holding yellow_block_1 and at step 30, we're picking up blue_block_1. This is not possible without putting down yellow_block_1 first.

Let's correct the last part of our plan:

28. Pickup yellow_block_1.
   - Now the arm is holding yellow_block_1, and yellow_block_1 is not on the table.
   - Part 1 of Constraint 4 is satisfied: yellow_block_1 is not on the table.

29. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1.
   - Now the arm is not holding any block, yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, and black_block_1 is not clear.
   - Constraint 4 is fully satisfied: yellow_block_1 is not on the table and black_block_1 is not clear.

30. Pickup blue_block_1.
   - Now the arm is holding blue_block_1.

31. Stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_2.
   - Now the arm is not holding any block, blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2, and yellow_block_2 is not clear.
   - Goal is achieved: blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2.

Actually, after further checking, I realize there's a problem with our plan.

In step 13, we unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1. But in the previous step, blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, which is in step 6. Between steps 6 and 13, we have:
7. Pickup grey_block_1.
8. Stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1.
9. Unstack grey_block_1 from white_block_1.
10. Stack grey_block_1 on the table.
11. Unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1.
12. Stack white_block_1 on grey_block_2.

I don't see any inconsistencies here. blue_block_1 remains on top of black_block_1 from step 6 to step 13.

But in step 14, we stack blue_block_1 on grey_block_1. However, at step 13, we're holding blue_block_1, and at step 14, we need to stack it on grey_block_1. This should be consistent.

Let me double-check the rest of the plan...

Actually, there's a problem with step 24. We've done putdown grey_block_2 in step 23, and in step 24, we're trying to pickup grey_block_2. This is fine since we've just put it down.

But after that, in step 29, we're stacking yellow_block_1 on black_block_1, when we actually wanted to satisfy Constraint 4 (yellow_block_1 is not on the table and black_block_1 is not clear).

Wait, this constraint is satisfied by the fact that yellow_block_1 is not on the table (we're holding it after step 28) and black_block_1 is not clear (it already has white_block_1 and grey_block_2 on top of it after step 25).

But after stacking yellow_block_1 on black_block_1 at step 29, we're trying to pickup blue_block_1 at step 30. But in the previous steps, we don't see blue_block_1 being put down. This is an inconsistency.

Let me trace through our plan one more time, carefully:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1.
2. Stack grey_block_2 on blue_block_1.
3. Unstack grey_block_2 from blue_block_1.
4. Stack grey_block_2 on yellow_block_2.
5. Pickup blue_block_1.
6. Stack blue_block_1 on black_block_1.
7. Pickup grey_block_1.
8. Stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1.
9. Unstack grey_block_1 from white_block_1.
10. Stack grey_block_1 on the table.
11. Unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1.
12. Stack white_block_1 on grey_block_2.
13. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1.
14. Stack blue_block_1 on grey_block_1.
15. Pickup black_block_1.
16. Stack black_block_1 on yellow_block_1.
17. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_2.
18. Stack white_block_1 on black_block_1.
19. Unstack blue_block_1 from grey_block_1.
20. Stack blue_block_1 on white_block_1.
21. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1.
22. Unstack grey_block_2 from yellow_block_2.
23. Putdown grey_block_2.
24. Pickup grey_block_2.
25. Stack grey_block_2 on white_block_1.
26. Unstack black_block_1 from yellow_block_1.
27. Putdown black_block_1.
28. Pickup yellow_block_1.
29. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1.
30. Pickup blue_block_1.
31. Stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_2.

But wait, in step 21, we're unstacking blue_block_1 from white_block_1, so now the arm is holding blue_block_1. Then, in step 22, we're unstacking grey_block_2 from yellow_block_2, which is inconsistent because the arm is already holding blue_block_1.

Let's redo the plan:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1.
2. Stack grey_block_2 on blue_block_1.
3. Unstack grey_block_2 from blue_block_1.
4. Stack grey_block_2 on yellow_block_2.
5. Pickup blue_block_1.
6. Stack blue_block_1 on black_block_1.
7. Pickup grey_block_1.
8. Stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1.
9. Unstack grey_block_1 from white_block_1.
10. Putdown grey_block_1.
11. Unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1.
12. Stack white_block_1 on grey_block_2.
13. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1.
14. Stack blue_block_1 on grey_block_1.
15. Pickup black_block_1.
16. Stack black_block_1 on yellow_block_1.
17. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_2.
18. Stack white_block_1 on black_block_1.
19. Unstack blue_block_1 from grey_block_1.
20. Stack blue_block_1 on white_block_1.
21. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1.
22. Putdown blue_block_1.
23. Unstack grey_block_2 from yellow_block_2.
24. Putdown grey_block_2.
25. Pickup blue_block_1.
26. Stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_2.

This is the best I can come up with. Let's check the constraints:

1. Grey_block_1 is held at the same time blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1: Satisfied at step 7.
2. Grey_block_1 is clear: Satisfied after step 1 and again after step 9.
3. Grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, or yellow_block_1 is clear: Satisfied at step 8 (grey_block_1 on top of white_block_1) and at step 11 (yellow_block_1 is clear).
4. Yellow_block_1 is not on the table and black_block_1 is not clear: Not yet satisfied.
5. Blue_block_1 is not on the table: Satisfied at step 5 and multiple steps after.
6. If blue_block_1 is not on the table, then there must be an earlier state where yellow_block_2 has a block on top of it: Satisfied because at step 4, grey_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_2, and blue_block_1 is not on the table at step 5.
7. Yellow_block_2 is clear: Satisfied at step 23.
8. If yellow_block_2 is clear, then either blue_block_1 must be on top of black_block_1 or grey_block_2 must be on the table: Satisfied at step 24 (grey_block_2 is on the table).
9. Arm must hold blue_block_1 at some point: Satisfied at step 5 and multiple steps after.
10. If arm is holding blue_block_1, then grey_block_2 must have been on top of blue_block_1 at an earlier state: Satisfied because grey_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1 at step 2, and the arm holds blue_block_1 at step 5.
11. Black_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1: Satisfied at step 16.
12. Black_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_2: Satisfied in the initial state and most steps, as black_block_1 is never on top of yellow_block_2.
13. If black_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_2, then the arm must be holding white_block_1 at that state or after: Satisfied at step 11.
14. Grey_block_2 is not on top of black_block_1: Satisfied in the initial state and all steps, as grey_block_2 is never on top of black_block_1.
15. If grey_block_2 is not on top of black_block_1, then white_block_1 must have a block on top of it at that state or after: Satisfied at step 20 (blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1).

Wait, we're still missing Constraint 4 (yellow_block_1 is not on the table and black_block_1 is not clear). Let's update the plan:

26. Unstack black_block_1 from yellow_block_1.
27. Putdown black_block_1.
28. Pickup yellow_block_1.
29. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1.

Now, yellow_block_1 is not on the table, and black_block_1 is not clear, satisfying Constraint 4. Let's continue:

30. Pickup blue_block_1.
31. Stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_2.

But wait, blue_block_1 is already stacked on yellow_block_2 in step 26.

OK, I messed this up. Let me start again, and check each constraint as I go.

Initial state:
- yellow_block_1 is on the table, with white_block_1 on top of it.
- black_block_1 is on the table and is clear.
- grey_block_1 is on the table, with grey_block_2 on top of it.
- yellow_block_2 is on the table and is clear.
- blue_block_1 is on the table and is clear.
- The arm is not holding any block.

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1.
   - Arm is holding grey_block_2, grey_block_1 is clear.

2. Stack grey_block_2 on blue_block_1.
   - Arm is free, grey_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1.
   - Constraint 14 is satisfied: grey_block_2 is not on top of black_block_1.

3. Unstack grey_block_2 from blue_block_1.
   - Arm is holding grey_block_2, blue_block_1 is clear.

4. Stack grey_block_2 on yellow_block_2.
   - Arm is free, grey_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_2.

5. Pickup blue_block_1.
   - Arm is holding blue_block_1, blue_block_1 is not on the table.
   - Constraint 5 is satisfied: blue_block_1 is not on the table.
   - Constraint 6 is satisfied: Before blue_block_1 is not on the table, yellow_block_2 had a block on top of it (grey_block_2 at step 4).
   - Constraint 9 is satisfied: Arm is holding blue_block_1.
   - Constraint 10 is satisfied: Before the arm is holding blue_block_1, grey_block_2 was on top of blue_block_1 (at step 2).

6. Stack blue_block_1 on black_block_1.
   - Arm is free, blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1.
   - Black_block_1 is not clear.

7. Pickup grey_block_1.
   - Arm is holding grey_block_1.
   - Constraint 1 is satisfied: Arm is holding grey_block_1 and blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1.
   - Constraint 2 is satisfied: grey_block_1 was clear (at step 1).

8. Stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1.
   - Arm is free, grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1.
   - Constraint 3 is satisfied: grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1.

9. Unstack grey_block_1 from white_block_1.
   - Arm is holding grey_block_1, white_block_1 is clear.

10. Putdown grey_block_1.
    - Arm is free, grey_block_1 is on the table.

11. Unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1.
    - Arm is holding white_block_1, yellow_block_1 is clear.
    - Constraint 13 is satisfied: Black_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_2 (from the initial state), and now the arm is holding white_block_1.

12. Stack white_block_1 on grey_block_2.
    - Arm is free, white_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2.

13. Pickup yellow_block_1.
    - Arm is holding yellow_block_1, yellow_block_1 is not on the table.

14. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1.
    - Arm is free, yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1 (which already has blue_block_1 on it).
    - Constraint 4 is satisfied: yellow_block_1 is not on the table and black_block_1 is not clear.
    - Constraint 11 is NOT satisfied: black_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1, but rather the reverse.

I need to rethink this plan. Somehow we need to have black_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1 at some point (Constraint 11), but we also need to satisfy Constraint 4, which requires yellow_block_1 to not be on the table and black_block_1 to not be clear.

I think I need to have yellow_block_1 on top of some other block (not the table) at some point, and have some other block on top of black_block_1.

Let's try a different approach:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1.
   - Arm is holding grey_block_2, grey_block_1 is clear.

2. Stack grey_block_2 on blue_block_1.
   - Arm is free, grey_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1.
   - Constraint 14 is satisfied: grey_block_2 is not on top of black_block_1.

3. Unstack grey_block_2 from blue_block_1.
   - Arm is holding grey_block_2, blue_block_1 is clear.

4. Stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1.
   - Arm is free, grey_block_2 is on top of black_block_1.

Oh, I thought grey_block_2 is never on top of black_block_1, but now I'm stacking it there. That's fine; the constraint just says that at some point, grey_block_2 is not on top of black_block_1, which is true for the initial state.

5. Pickup blue_block_1.
   - Arm is holding blue_block_1, blue_block_1 is not on the table.
   - Constraint 5 is satisfied: blue_block_1 is not on the table.
   - Constraint 9 is satisfied: Arm is holding blue_block_1.
   - Constraint 10 is satisfied: Before the arm is holding blue_block_1, grey_block_2 was on top of blue_block_1 (at step 2).

6. Stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_2.
   - Arm is free, blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2.
   - Constraint 6 is NO longer satisfied: Before blue_block_1 is not on the table (step 5), yellow_block_2 did not have a block on top of it.

I think I need to add a step to put a block on top of yellow_block_2 before removing blue_block_1 from the table.

Let me try a different approach:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1.
   - Arm is holding grey_block_2, grey_block_1 is clear.
   - Constraint 2 is satisfied: grey_block_1 is clear.

2. Stack grey_block_2 on yellow_block_2.
   - Arm is free, grey_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_2.
   - Constraint 14 is satisfied: grey_block_2 is not on top of black_block_1.

3. Pickup grey_block_1.
   - Arm is holding grey_block_1, grey_block_1 is not on the table.

4. Stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1.
   - Arm is free, grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1.
   - Constraint 3 is satisfied: grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1.

5. Pickup blue_block_1.
   - Arm is holding blue_block_1, blue_block_1 is not on the table.
   - Constraint 5 is satisfied: blue_block_1 is not on the table.
   - Constraint 6 is satisfied: Before blue_block_1 is not on the table, yellow_block_2 had a block on top of it (grey_block_2 at step 2).
   - Constraint 9 is satisfied: Arm is holding blue_block_1.
   - But Constraint 10 is NOT satisfied: Before the arm is holding blue_block_1, grey_block_2 was not on top of blue_block_1 in any prior state.

I think I need to ensure grey_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1 at some point, and then the arm picks up blue_block_1 after that. Let's redo our plan:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1.
   - Arm is holding grey_block_2, grey_block_1 is clear.
   - Constraint 2 is satisfied: grey_block_1 is clear.

2. Stack grey_block_2 on blue_block_1.
   - Arm is free, grey_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1.
   - Constraint 14 is satisfied: grey_block_2 is not on top of black_block_1.

3. Unstack grey_block_2 from blue_block_1.
   - Arm is holding grey_block_2, blue_block_1 is clear.

4. Stack grey_block_2 on yellow_block_2.
   - Arm is free, grey_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_2.

5. Pickup blue_block_1.
   - Arm is holding blue_block_1, blue_block_1 is not on the table.
   - Constraint 5 is satisfied: blue_block_1 is not on the table.
   - Constraint 6 is satisfied: Before blue_block_1 is not on the table, yellow_block_2 had a block on top of it (grey_block_2 at step 4).
   - Constraint 9 is satisfied: Arm is holding blue_block_1.
   - Constraint 10 is satisfied: Before the arm is holding blue_block_1, grey_block_2 was on top of blue_block_1 (at step 2).

6. Stack blue_block_1 on black_block_1.
   - Arm is free, blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1.
   - Black_block_1 is not clear.

7. Pickup grey_block_1.
   - Arm is holding grey_block_1.
   - Constraint 1 is satisfied: Arm is holding grey_block_1 and blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1.

8. Stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1.
   - Arm is free, grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1.
   - Constraint 3 is satisfied: grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1.

9. Unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1.
   - I can't do this because white_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top of it, so it's not clear.

Hmm, I need to rethink step 8.

8. Putdown grey_block_1.
   - Arm is free, grey_block_1 is on the table.

9. Unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1.
   - Arm is holding white_block_1, yellow_block_1 is clear.
   - Constraint 13 is satisfied: Black_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_2 (from the initial state), and now the arm is holding white_block_1.

    - Arm is free, white_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1.
    - Constraint 15 is satisfied: grey_block_2 is not on top of black_block_1 (from the initial state), and now white_block_1 has a block on top of it.
    Oops, white_block_1 doesn't have a block on top of it yet. We'll need to fix that.

11. Pickup yellow_block_1.
    - Arm is holding yellow_block_1, yellow_block_1 is not on the table.

12. Stack yellow_block_1 on white_block_1.
    - Arm is free, yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, white_block_1 is not clear.
    - Now, Constraint 15 is satisfied: white_block_1 has a block on top of it.

13. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1.

Alright, let's check all constraints one more time:

1. Grey_block_1 is held at the same time blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1: Satisfied at step 7.
2. Grey_block_1 is clear: Satisfied after step 1.
3. Grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, or yellow_block_1 is clear: Not yet satisfied.
4. Yellow_block_1 is not on the table and black_block_1 is not clear: Satisfied at step 18.
5. Blue_block_1 is not on the table: Satisfied at step 5 and again at step 25.
6. If blue_block_1 is not on the table, then there must be an earlier state where yellow_block_2 has a block on top of it: Satisfied because at step 4, grey_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_2, and blue_block_1 is not on the table at step 5. And at step 25, blue_block_1 is not on the table, and earlier, grey_block_2 was on top of yellow_block_2 (at step 4).
7. Yellow_block_2 is clear: Satisfied at step 19.
8. If yellow_block_2 is clear, then either blue_block_1 must be on top of black_block_1 or grey_block_2 must be on the table: Satisfied at step 20 (grey_block_2 is on the table).
9. Arm must hold blue_block_1 at some point: Satisfied at step 5 and again at step 13 and again at step 25.
10. If arm is holding blue_block_1, then grey_block_2 must have been on top of blue_block_1 at an earlier state: Satisfied because grey_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1 at step 2, and the arm holds blue_block_1 at step 5, step 13, and step 25.
11. Black_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1: Satisfied at step 24.
12. Black_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_2: Satisfied in the initial state and most steps, as black_block_1 is never on top of yellow_block_2.
13. If black_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_2, then the arm must be holding white_block_1 at that state or after: Satisfied at step 9.
14. Grey_block_2 is not on top of black_block_1: Satisfied in the initial state.
15. If grey_block_2 is not on top of black_block_1, then white_block_1 must have a block on top of it at that state or after: Satisfied at step 12 (yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1).

Constraint 3 (Grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, or yellow_block_1 is clear) is not satisfied in the above plan.

I missed a step earlier. We need to put grey_block_1 on top of white_block_1 at some point.

Let's modify the plan:

10. Stack white_block_1 on grey_block_1.
    - Arm is free, white_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1.

    - Arm is free, grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, white_block_1 is not clear.
    - Constraint 3 is satisfied: grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1.

Ok, so let me think this through again. I'm overcomplicating things. Let's come up with a plan that definitely meets all constraints.

10. If arm is holding blue_block_1, then grey_block_2 must have been on top of blue_block_1 at an earlier state: Satisfied because grey_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1 at step 2, and the arm holds blue_block_1 at step 5.
11. Black_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1: Satisfied at step 18.
12. Black_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_2: Satisfied throughout, as black_block_1 is never on top of yellow_block_2.
13. If black_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_2, then the arm must be holding white_block_1 at that state or after: Satisfied at step 9.
14. Grey_block_2 is not on top of black_block_1: Satisfied throughout, as grey_block_2 is never on top of black_block_1.
15. If grey_block_2 is not on top of black_block_1, then white_block_1 must have a block on top of it at that state or after: Satisfied at step 12 (yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1).
