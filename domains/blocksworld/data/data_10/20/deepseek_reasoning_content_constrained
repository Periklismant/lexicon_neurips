Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get blue_block_1 on top of yellow_block_2 while satisfying all the constraints. First, I need to understand the initial state and the goal, then look at all the constraints to make sure each is met at some point.

Starting with the initial state. The blocks are arranged as follows:

- yellow_block_1 is on the table, with white_block_1 on top of it. So white_block_1 is clear.
- black_block_1 is on the table and clear.
- grey_block_1 is on the table with grey_block_2 on top. So grey_block_2 is clear.
- yellow_block_2 and blue_block_1 are on the table and clear.

The goal is to have blue_block_1 on yellow_block_2. So I need to move blue_block_1 from the table to yellow_block_2. To do that, I need to pick up blue_block_1 and stack it on yellow_block_2. But before that, yellow_block_2 must be clear. In the initial state, it is clear, so that's good. So the straightforward steps might be: pickup blue_block_1, then stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2. But wait, are there any constraints that might interfere?

Looking at the constraints:

1. At some state, the robot is holding grey_block_1 and blue_block_1 is on black_block_1.
2. At some state, grey_block_1 is clear.
3. At some state, either grey_block_1 is on white_block_1 or yellow_block_1 is clear.
4. At some state, yellow_block_1 is not on the table (so it's on another block) and black_block_1 has a block on top (so it's not clear).
5. At some state, blue_block_1 is not on the table (which it will be once stacked on yellow_block_2, but maybe also earlier steps).
6. If blue_block_1 is not on the table in some state, there must be an earlier state where yellow_block_2 is not clear. Wait, but the goal is blue_block_1 on yellow_block_2. So when we stack blue on yellow_2, blue is not on the table. So we need to ensure that before that, there was a state where yellow_2 had a block on top. But initially, yellow_2 is clear. So we might need to stack something on yellow_2 first, then unstack it later. That complicates things.
7. At some state, yellow_block_2 is clear. Which is true initially, but maybe after stacking something and then removing it.
8. If yellow_2 is clear in a state s, then in s or after, either blue is on black or grey_2 is on the table. Since grey_2 starts on grey_1 and is clear, perhaps moving grey_2 at some point.
9. Must hold blue_block_1 at some state. Which we will do when moving it.
10. If holding blue_block_1, there must be an earlier state where grey_2 was on blue_1. Hmm, so before we can pick up blue_block_1, grey_2 must have been stacked on it at some point. But initially, blue_1 is on the table and clear. So this seems tricky. To have grey_2 on blue_1, we need to stack grey_2 onto blue_1. But grey_2 is initially on grey_1. So we need to unstack grey_2 from grey_1, then stack it on blue_1. Then later unstack it again to get blue_1. But that's adding steps. But this is a constraint that must be met.
11. At some state, black_block_1 is on yellow_block_1. So stacking black_1 onto yellow_1.
12. At some state, black_block_1 is not on yellow_block_2. Which is true initially, but maybe needs to ensure it's maintained.
13. If black_1 is not on yellow_2 in state s, then in s or after, the robot is holding white_block_1. So perhaps after moving black_1 somewhere else, we need to pick up white_block_1.
14. At some state, grey_2 is not on black_1. Initially, it's not, so that's true. But maybe after some steps, if grey_2 was moved onto black_1, but then moved off, this condition is met again.
15. If grey_2 is not on black_1 in state s, then in s or after, white_block_1 has a block on top. So white_block_1 is on yellow_block_1 initially. If we stack something on white_block_1, then that condition is met. Or if we leave it as is, but maybe need to do something else.

This is a lot. Let's try to outline the steps needed, considering constraints.

First, the main goal is blue on yellow_2. But to pick up blue, we need to satisfy constraint 10: when we hold blue, there must have been a prior state where grey_2 was on blue. So first, we need to stack grey_2 onto blue_1, then unstack it, then pick up blue_1.

But grey_2 is currently on grey_1. So steps for that:

1. Unstack grey_2 from grey_1 (since grey_2 is clear). Then putdown grey_2? Or stack it on blue_1. Wait, to stack grey_2 on blue_1, we need to pick up grey_2, then stack it on blue_1. Let's see:

- Unstack grey_2 from grey_1. Now holding grey_2. Then stack grey_2 on blue_1. Then later, unstack grey_2 from blue_1 (to make blue_1 clear again so we can pick it up). But then blue_1 would be clear, so we can pick it up. However, when we stack grey_2 on blue_1, that makes blue_1 not clear. Then to pick up blue_1, we need to unstack grey_2 from blue_1 first. So steps:

- Unstack grey_2 from grey_1 (possible since grey_2 is clear). Now holding grey_2.
- Stack grey_2 on blue_1. Now blue_1 has grey_2 on top. So blue_1 is not clear. Then, to pick up blue_1, we need to first unstack grey_2 from blue_1. So:

- Unstack grey_2 from blue_1. Now holding grey_2. Then putdown grey_2 somewhere. Then pickup blue_1. But then, when we unstack grey_2 from blue_1, that makes blue_1 clear. Then we can pick up blue_1. But during this process, when we hold blue_1 (after the final pickup), the constraint 10 requires that there was a prior state where grey_2 was on blue_1. Which would be after we stacked it there and before unstacking. So that's satisfied.

So steps to handle constraint 10:

1. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
2. stack grey_block_2 blue_block_1
3. unstack grey_block_2 blue_block_1
4. putdown grey_block_2 (maybe on table or elsewhere)
5. pickup blue_block_1
6. stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2

But wait, after step 2, blue_block_1 has grey_block_2 on it, so when we later unstack grey_block_2, blue_block_1 becomes clear. Then we can pickup blue_block_1. That works.

But this adds several steps. Now, the main goal is achieved in step 6. But there are other constraints to consider.

Looking at constraint 1: At some state, the robot is holding grey_block_1 and blue_block_1 is on black_block_1. So during the plan, we need to have a state where the arm is holding grey_block_1 and blue is on black_1. How can we achieve that?

So first, blue_block_1 needs to be on black_block_1 at some point. But our main plan is to put blue on yellow_2. So perhaps we need to temporarily stack blue on black_1, then move it later.

But then, how to get blue on black_1. Let's think. Let's say after step 2 (grey_2 on blue_1), maybe we can move blue_1 onto black_1. Wait, but blue_1 is under grey_2. To move blue_1, we need to first remove grey_2. Wait, but blue_1 is on the table. To stack blue_1 on black_1, we need to pick up blue_1. But in step 2, blue_1 has grey_2 on top. So we can't pick up blue_1 until after unstacking grey_2 (step 3). So perhaps after step 3, we can pick up blue_1 and stack it on black_1, then later move it to yellow_2.

So modifying the steps:

1. unstack grey_2 from grey_1 → hold grey_2
2. stack grey_2 on blue_1 → blue_1 has grey_2
3. unstack grey_2 from blue_1 → hold grey_2
4. putdown grey_2 (maybe on table)
5. pickup blue_1 → now holding blue_1
6. stack blue_1 on black_1 → blue_1 on black_1, which satisfies the first part of constraint 1 (blue on black_1). Then, to satisfy the other part (holding grey_block_1), perhaps after this, we need to pick up grey_block_1.

But grey_block_1 is under grey_2 initially. Wait, initial state: grey_block_1 is on table with grey_block_2 on top. After step 1, grey_2 is removed. So grey_block_1 is clear. So after step 4, when we put grey_2 on the table, grey_block_1 is still on the table and clear. So we can pick up grey_block_1.

So after step 6 (blue on black_1), we can:

7. pickup grey_block_1 → now holding grey_block_1. At this state, blue is on black_1 (from step 6) and we are holding grey_block_1. This satisfies constraint 1.

Then, after that, we need to move blue from black_1 to yellow_2. But first, we have to unstack blue from black_1. But to do that, blue must be clear. So if blue is on black_1, and nothing is on top, then we can unstack it. So steps:

8. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1 → holding blue_block_1
9. stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2 → done.

But let's check the order. So steps would be:

1. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
2. stack grey_block_2 blue_block_1
3. unstack grey_block_2 blue_block_1
4. putdown grey_block_2
5. pickup blue_block_1
6. stack blue_block_1 black_block_1 → now blue is on black_1
7. pickup grey_block_1 → now holding grey_1, and blue is on black_1 (constraint 1 met)
8. putdown grey_block_1 → maybe on table
9. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1 → but to unstack, blue must be clear. After step 6, blue is on black_1, and since we putdown grey_1, black_1 is under blue. So blue is on black_1, and nothing is on top of blue (since step 6's effect is that blue is on black_1, and blue is clear after stacking. Wait, when you stack, the block being stacked becomes clear. Wait, the stack action's effects: after stacking b1 on b2, b1 is clear. So in step 6, after stacking blue on black_1, blue is clear. So to unstack it, we can do that.

Wait, stack action's effects:

After stack b1 b2:

- b1 is on b2

- b1 is clear (since nothing is on top of it)

- b2 is not clear (since b1 is on top)

Wait, no. The effect of stack x y is that x is on y, x is clear (since nothing is on x), y is not clear (since x is on y). So after stacking blue on black_1, blue is clear, so we can unstack it if needed. Wait, no, unstack requires that the block to be unstacked is clear and you're not holding anything. Wait, to unstack x y, x must be on y, x must be clear, and you are not holding anything.

So after step 6, blue is on black_1, and blue is clear. So to unstack blue from black_1, we can do that as long as the arm is empty. So after step 7, we are holding grey_1. So we need to putdown grey_1 (step 8), then unstack blue (step 9), then stack on yellow_2 (step 10).

So steps 1-10 would satisfy the main goal and some constraints. Let's check the other constraints.

Constraint 2: grey_block_1 is clear in some state. Initially, grey_block_1 has grey_2 on top. After step 1 (unstack grey_2), grey_1 becomes clear. So that's one state where it's clear. So that's satisfied.

Constraint 3: in some state, either grey_1 is on white_block_1 or yellow_block_1 is clear. Let's see. Initially, yellow_block_1 has white_block_1 on top. So yellow_block_1 is not clear. After step 7, when we pick up grey_block_1, we could put it on white_block_1. Wait, but in the current steps, after step 7, we putdown grey_1 on the table. So if we instead stack grey_1 on white_block_1, then we meet the first part of constraint 3. Let's adjust step 8 to stack instead of putdown.

Wait, step 7 is pickup grey_1, step 8 could be stack grey_1 white_block_1. Then in that state, grey_1 is on white_block_1, satisfying constraint 3. But stacking grey_1 on white_block_1 requires that white_block_1 is clear. Initially, white_block_1 is on yellow_block_1 and is clear. So yes, white_block_1 is clear. So step 8: stack grey_block_1 white_block_1. Then, grey_1 is on white_1. Then, to proceed, we need to unstack grey_1 from white_1 to free up the arm. But perhaps that's not necessary. Wait, after stacking grey_1 on white_1, the arm is empty. Then step 9 would be unstack blue from black_1. So that works.

But stacking grey_1 on white_1 would also mean that white_1 is no longer clear, which might affect other steps. Let's see. But in any case, doing this stack would satisfy constraint 3. Let's adjust step 8 to stack grey_1 on white_1. Then:

After step 7 (holding grey_1), step 8: stack grey_1 white_block_1. Now grey_1 is on white_1, which is on yellow_1. Then, step 9: unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1. Now holding blue. Then stack on yellow_2. So that's steps:

1. unstack grey_2 grey_1
2. stack grey_2 blue_1
3. unstack grey_2 blue_1 → hold grey_2
4. putdown grey_2
5. pickup blue_1 → hold blue_1
6. stack blue_1 black_1 → blue on black_1
7. pickup grey_1 → hold grey_1
8. stack grey_1 white_1 → grey_1 on white_1, which satisfies constraint 3
9. unstack blue_1 black_1 → hold blue_1
10. stack blue_1 yellow_2 → goal achieved

Now, checking constraint 3: in step 8, grey_1 is on white_1, so that satisfies the first condition. So constraint 3 is met.

Constraint 4: at some state, yellow_block_1 is not on the table (i.e., it's on another block) and black_block_1 has a block on top. Let's see when that can happen. After step 6, blue is on black_1. And yellow_block_1 is under white_block_1. But yellow_block_1 is still on the table. Unless we move it. So perhaps after step 8, we have grey_1 on white_1, which is on yellow_1. So yellow_1 is still on the table. To make yellow_1 not on the table, we need to move it. For example, stack yellow_1 on another block. But how?

Wait, initially, yellow_1 has white_1 on top. So to move yellow_1, we first need to remove white_1 and grey_1 (if stacked on white_1). But in step 8, we stacked grey_1 on white_1, which is on yellow_1. So to pick up yellow_1, we need to first unstack grey_1 from white_1, then unstack white_1 from yellow_1. That's a lot. Maybe there's another way.

Alternatively, maybe during the plan, we can move yellow_1. But given the steps so far, maybe not. Let's see. Constraint 4 requires that in some state, yellow_1 is not on the table (so it's on another block) and black_1 has a block on top (which is blue_1 after step 6). So if we can have yellow_1 moved onto another block, but in our current steps, it's still on the table. So perhaps we need to add steps to move yellow_1.

Wait, but the main goal doesn't require moving yellow_1. But the constraints do. So how to satisfy constraint 4.

Constraint 4: "yellow_block_1 is not on the table" and "black_block_1 is not clear (has a block on top)".

In our current plan, after step 6, black_1 has blue_1 on top. So that's the second part. The first part is yellow_1 not on the table. So if we can have yellow_1 stacked on another block. But how? Let's think.

Suppose after step 8 (grey_1 on white_1), we then move yellow_1. But yellow_1 is under white_1 and grey_1. To move yellow_1, we need to remove the blocks on top. So:

After step 8 (grey_1 on white_1):

9. unstack grey_1 white_1 → hold grey_1
10. unstack white_1 yellow_1 → hold white_1
11. putdown white_1 → on table
12. pickup yellow_1 → now holding yellow_1
13. stack yellow_1 some_block → e.g., stack on black_1? But black_1 has blue_1. So can't. Maybe stack on another block, like yellow_2. But yellow_2 is needed for the goal. So perhaps stack yellow_1 on blue_block_1 (which is on black_1). But blue_block_1 is on black_1. To stack yellow_1 on blue_1, we need blue_1 to be clear. But blue_1 is under yellow_1's stack. Wait, this seems complicated.

Alternatively, after step 8, we could stack yellow_1 on another block, but it's under white_1 and grey_1. So this seems not feasible without a lot of steps. Maybe there's a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe during the process of handling other constraints, we can satisfy constraint 4. For example, when we unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1 to move it elsewhere. Let's see.

In the initial state, white_block_1 is on yellow_block_1. So if we unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1, then yellow_block_1 becomes clear. But to do that, we need to have the arm free. Let's see when that can happen.

In the current steps, after step 8, we have grey_1 stacked on white_1. So to unstack white_1 from yellow_1, we need to first remove grey_1.

But maybe in step 8, instead of stacking grey_1 on white_1, we stack it somewhere else, allowing us to move white_1 and then yellow_1.

Alternatively, maybe we can adjust the steps to move white_block_1 and yellow_block_1.

But this is getting complicated. Let's think again. Constraint 4 requires that in some state, yellow_1 is not on the table and black_1 has a block on top. The black_1 part is satisfied when blue is on it (step 6). The yellow_1 part needs to have it not on the table. So perhaps we can stack yellow_1 on another block.

For example, after moving white_1 and grey_1 off, we can stack yellow_1 onto another block. Let's try:

After step 6 (blue on black_1), perhaps:

7. unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1 → need to hold white_block_1. But initially, white_block_1 is on yellow_block_1. To unstack, we need to have the arm empty. So after step 6, the arm is empty. So step 7: unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1 → hold white_1.

8. stack white_block_1 black_block_1 → but black_block_1 has blue_1 on top. Cannot. So stack white_1 elsewhere. Maybe stack on grey_1.

But grey_1 is on the table (since we unstacked grey_2 in step 1, then grey_1 is clear. So step 8: stack white_1 grey_1. Now, white_1 is on grey_1, which is on the table. Then, step 9: pickup yellow_block_1 (which is now clear, since white_1 was removed). Then stack yellow_block_1 on another block, say, blue_block_1 (which is on black_1). But blue_block_1 is on black_1 and is clear (from step 6). So step 10: stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1. Now yellow_1 is not on the table. So in this state, yellow_1 is on blue_1 (which is on black_1), and black_1 has blue_1 on top. So both parts of constraint 4 are satisfied.

Then, proceed to handle other steps. But this adds several steps. Let's see:

So steps would be:

1. unstack grey_2 grey_1
2. stack grey_2 blue_1
3. unstack grey_2 blue_1
4. putdown grey_2
5. pickup blue_1
6. stack blue_1 black_1 → blue on black_1, black_1 not clear, blue is clear
7. unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1 → hold white_1
8. stack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → white_1 on grey_1
9. pickup yellow_block_1 → now holding yellow_1
10. stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1 → yellow_1 on blue_1 (now blue_1 is under yellow_1 and is on black_1)
At this point, yellow_1 is not on the table (satisfies constraint 4), and black_1 has blue_1 (satisfies constraint 4). So step 10 satisfies constraint 4.

Then, we need to proceed to hold grey_block_1 (constraint 1) and other steps.

But after step 10, yellow_1 is on blue_1, which is on black_1. To pick up grey_block_1 (which is under white_1 in step 8?), wait: after step 8, white_1 is stacked on grey_1. So grey_1 is under white_1, which is on grey_1. So grey_1 is on the table, and white_1 is on grey_1. So grey_1 has white_1 on top. So to pick up grey_1, we need to unstack white_1 from grey_1.

But after step 8, grey_1 has white_1 on top. So steps after step 10:

11. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold white_1
12. putdown white_block_1 → on table
13. pickup grey_block_1 → now holding grey_1 (satisfies part of constraint 1 when combined with blue on black_1)
At this point, blue is on black_1, and we're holding grey_1. So this satisfies constraint 1.

Then, putdown grey_1 somewhere:

14. putdown grey_block_1 → on table
15. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1 → to move yellow_1 back to table if needed, but since our main goal is blue on yellow_2, maybe not necessary.

But wait, after step 10, yellow_1 is on blue_1. So blue_1 is under yellow_1, which is on top of it. So to unstack blue_1 from black_1, we need to first remove yellow_1. Which complicates things. This seems like a detour. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, after step 10, we can unstack blue_1 from black_1. But blue_1 has yellow_1 on top. So we can't unstack blue_1 unless yellow_1 is clear. So we need to unstack yellow_1 first.

But this is getting too complicated. Perhaps there's a way to satisfy constraint 4 without moving yellow_block_1. Wait, no. Because constraint 4 requires yellow_block_1 not to be on the table. So unless we stack it somewhere, it's on the table. So we have to move it.

Alternatively, perhaps when we stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1 (step 8 in the earlier plan), yellow_block_1 is still on the table. So that doesn't help. So we need to find a way to get yellow_block_1 off the table.

This seems like a necessary step. So perhaps the steps to satisfy constraint 4 are:

- unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1

- stack white_block_1 somewhere else

- pickup yellow_block_1 and stack it on another block.

But doing this adds steps. Let's try integrating this into the plan.

Original steps leading to constraint 1 and 4:

1. unstack grey_2 from grey_1

2. stack grey_2 on blue_1

3. unstack grey_2 from blue_1

4. putdown grey_2

5. pickup blue_1

6. stack blue_1 on black_1

7. unstack white_1 from yellow_1

8. stack white_1 on grey_1

9. pickup yellow_1

10. stack yellow_1 on blue_1 (now on black_1)

This satisfies constraint 4 (yellow_1 not on table, black_1 has blue_1).

Then, to satisfy constraint 1 (hold grey_1 and blue on black_1):

After step 10, we need to pick up grey_1. But grey_1 has white_1 on top (from step 8). So:

11. unstack white_1 from grey_1 → hold white_1

12. putdown white_1 → on table

13. pickup grey_1 → now holding grey_1 (and blue is on black_1 from step 6, which is still true). So this state satisfies constraint 1.

Then, proceed to move blue to yellow_2:

14. unstack yellow_1 from blue_1 → hold yellow_1

15. putdown yellow_1 → on table

16. unstack blue_1 from black_1 → hold blue_1

17. stack blue_1 on yellow_2 → goal achieved.

Now, let's check all constraints:

1. At step 13, holding grey_1, blue on black_1 → satisfied.

2. grey_1 is clear after step 1 (unstack grey_2) → satisfied.

3. After step 8, white_1 is on grey_1, so grey_1 is not on white_1, but yellow_1 is clear after step 7 (unstack white_1). Wait, no: after step 7, white_1 is unstacked from yellow_1, so yellow_1 becomes clear. Then in step 8, white_1 is stacked on grey_1. So yellow_1 is clear in step 7-8. So constraint 3 requires that in some state, either grey_1 is on white_1 or yellow_1 is clear. After step 7, yellow_1 is clear (before step 8). So that satisfies the second condition. So constraint 3 is satisfied.

4. In step 10, yellow_1 is not on table (on blue_1) and black_1 has blue_1 → satisfied.

5. blue_1 not on table in steps 6, 10, 16, 17 → satisfied.

6. For any state where blue is not on table (like step 6), there must be an earlier state where yellow_2 is not clear. Initially, yellow_2 is clear. The first time blue is not on table is step 6. But before step 6, there's no action that makes yellow_2 not clear. So this is a problem. So constraint 6 requires that if blue is not on the table in a state, then there was an earlier state where yellow_2 was not clear. So in step 6, blue is not on table, but before that, there's no state where yellow_2 had a block on top. So this violates constraint 6. Thus, we need to ensure that before step 6, yellow_2 is made not clear at some point.

How can we do that? We need to stack something on yellow_2 before step 6, then unstack it later. Let's see.

For example, before step 5 (pickup blue_1), we could stack grey_2 on yellow_2, then unstack it after.

But let's adjust the plan:

After step 4 (putdown grey_2):

4.5. pickup grey_2

4.6. stack grey_2 yellow_2 → now yellow_2 has grey_2 on top (not clear)

4.7. unstack grey_2 yellow_2 → hold grey_2

4.8. putdown grey_2

Then proceed to step 5 (pickup blue_1).

Now, in step 4.6, yellow_2 is not clear. Then, in step 6 (stack blue_1 on black_1), blue is not on table. The earlier step 4.6 satisfies the condition for constraint 6.

But this adds steps. Let's see:

Revised steps:

1. unstack grey_2 grey_1 → hold grey_2

2. stack grey_2 blue_1 → blue_1 has grey_2

3. unstack grey_2 blue_1 → hold grey_2

4. putdown grey_2 → on table

5. pickup grey_2 → again

6. stack grey_2 yellow_2 → makes yellow_2 not clear

7. unstack grey_2 yellow_2 → hold grey_2

8. putdown grey_2 → on table

9. pickup blue_1 → now step 5 becomes step 9

10. stack blue_1 black_1 → blue not on table

Then proceed with the other steps. This way, before step 10 (blue not on table), step 6 (stack grey_2 on yellow_2) makes yellow_2 not clear. So constraint 6 is satisfied.

But this adds four steps (steps 5-8). This makes the plan longer, but necessary to satisfy constraint 6.

So integrating this into the plan:

1. unstack grey_2 grey_1 → hold grey_2

2. stack grey_2 blue_1 → grey_2 on blue_1

3. unstack grey_2 blue_1 → hold grey_2

4. putdown grey_2 → on table

5. pickup grey_2 → hold grey_2 again

6. stack grey_2 yellow_2 → yellow_2 has grey_2

7. unstack grey_2 yellow_2 → hold grey_2

8. putdown grey_2 → on table

9. pickup blue_1 → hold blue_1

10. stack blue_1 black_1 → blue on black_1

11. unstack white_1 yellow_1 → hold white_1

12. stack white_1 grey_1 → white_1 on grey_1

13. pickup yellow_1 → hold yellow_1

14. stack yellow_1 blue_1 → yellow_1 on blue_1 (now on black_1)

15. unstack white_1 grey_1 → hold white_1

16. putdown white_1 → on table

17. pickup grey_1 → now holding grey_1 (satisfies constraint 1 when combined with blue on black_1)

18. putdown grey_1 → on table

19. unstack yellow_1 blue_1 → hold yellow_1

20. putdown yellow_1 → on table

21. unstack blue_1 black_1 → hold blue_1

22. stack blue_1 yellow_2 → goal achieved

Now, check constraint 6: when blue is not on table (steps 10, 14, 21, 22), there must be an earlier state where yellow_2 was not clear. The earliest such state is step 6 (grey_2 on yellow_2). So when blue is not on table in step 10, there was step 6 before it where yellow_2 was not clear. So constraint 6 is satisfied.

Constraint 7: yellow_2 is clear in some state. Initially, it's clear. Also, after step 7 (unstack grey_2 from yellow_2), yellow_2 is clear. And in step 22, after stacking blue on yellow_2, yellow_2 is not clear. But before that, after step 7, yellow_2 is clear. So constraint 7 is satisfied.

Constraint 8: if yellow_2 is clear in state s, then in s or after, either blue is on black_1 or grey_2 is on table. Let's see. After step 7, yellow_2 is clear. Then in the subsequent steps, after step 7, grey_2 is on table (step 8). So in state s (step 7), grey_2 is on table (step 8 comes after). So in step 7, grey_2 is not on table (step 7 is unstacking from yellow_2, then step 8 is putdown grey_2 on table). So after step 8, grey_2 is on table. So in state s (step 7), after s, step 8 puts grey_2 on table. So constraint 8 is satisfied.

Constraint 9: must hold blue_block_1 at some state. Steps 9,21: yes.

Constraint 10: if holding blue_1 (steps 9,21), there must be an earlier state where grey_2 was on blue_1. Yes, steps 2-3: grey_2 was stacked on blue_1 in step 2, then unstacked in step 3. So when holding blue_1 in step 9, there was an earlier state (step 2) where grey_2 was on blue_1. So satisfied.

Constraint 11: black_1 on yellow_1 at some state. In our plan, black_1 is on table. Wait, no. Constraint 11 says "black_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1" at some state. But in our current plan, black_block_1 is on the table, and yellow_block_1 is moved onto blue_1 (step 14). So this constraint is not satisfied. Oops! So we need to have a state where black_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1.

This requires us to stack black_block_1 onto yellow_block_1. But how?

This is a new constraint. So in our current plan, we need to add steps to stack black_block_1 on yellow_block_1 at some point.

But black_block_1 is initially on the table. To stack it on yellow_block_1, we need to pick up black_block_1 and stack it on yellow_block_1. But yellow_block_1 has white_block_1 and grey_block_1 stacked on it in some steps. So we need to clear yellow_block_1 first.

But this adds more steps. Let's see.

Perhaps after step 14 (yellow_1 on blue_1), we can move black_block_1.

Wait, after step 14, black_block_1 has blue_1 on top. To pick up black_block_1, we need to unstack blue_1 from black_1. But blue_1 has yellow_1 on top (step 14). So we need to unstack yellow_1 first.

This is getting very complex. Maybe there's a different approach.

Alternatively, during the plan, after moving white_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (step 11), we can stack black_block_1 onto yellow_block_1.

Let me adjust the plan:

After step 11 (unstack white_1 from yellow_1), we can stack black_1 on yellow_1.

So steps:

11. unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1 → hold white_1

12. putdown white_block_1 → on table

13. pickup black_block_1 → hold black_1

14. stack black_block_1 yellow_block_1 → black_1 on yellow_1

This would satisfy constraint 11. Then proceed.

But this adds steps. Let's integrate:

Revised steps after step 10:

10. stack blue_1 black_1 → blue on black_1

11. unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1 → hold white_1

12. putdown white_block_1 → on table

13. pickup black_block_1 → hold black_1

14. stack black_block_1 yellow_block_1 → black_1 on yellow_1 (satisfies constraint 11)

15. unstack black_block_1 yellow_block_1 → to free up black_block_1 if needed, but not sure.

But this may complicate other steps. Let's see:

After step 14, black_1 is on yellow_1. To continue with the earlier steps, we need to move it back. But this is getting too involved. Perhaps there's a way to stack black_block_1 on yellow_block_1 and then move it back, but this will increase the steps.

Alternatively, maybe after stacking black_block_1 on yellow_block_1 (step 14), we can proceed to stack white_block_1 on grey_block_1 (original step 12 becomes step 15):

15. stack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → white on grey_1

16. pickup yellow_block_1 → hold yellow_1

17. stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1 → yellow_1 on blue_1 (now on black_1, which is on yellow_block_1)

But this seems messy. Also, after step 14, black_block_1 is on yellow_block_1. So yellow_block_1 is not on the table, which helps satisfy constraint 4. Wait, constraint 4 requires yellow_block_1 not on the table and black_block_1 has a block on top. But in this case, black_block_1 is on yellow_block_1 (so yellow_block_1 is not on the table), but black_block_1 has blue_block_1 on top (from step 10). Wait, no: after step 10, blue_block_1 is on black_block_1. Then in step 14, we stack black_block_1 on yellow_block_1. So black_block_1 is on yellow_block_1, and blue_block_1 is on black_block_1. So yellow_block_1 is not on the table (satisfies part of constraint 4), and black_block_1 has blue_block_1 on top (satisfies the other part). So this would satisfy constraint 4. Additionally, black_block_1 is on yellow_block_1 (satisfies constraint 11). So this could be a way to handle both constraints 4 and 11.

But then, we need to unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1 to stack it on yellow_block_2. But blue_block_1 is on black_block_1, which is on yellow_block_1. So to unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1, we need to have blue_block_1 clear. Which it is. So after step 14, black_block_1 is on yellow_block_1, blue_block_1 is on black_block_1. So blue_block_1 is clear. So unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1 (step 15):

15. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1 → hold blue_1

16. stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2 → goal achieved.

But we also need to satisfy constraint 1 (holding grey_block_1 and blue on black_block_1). But after step 14, blue is on black_block_1. So we need to pick up grey_block_1 while blue is on black_block_1.

But grey_block_1 is under white_block_1 (step 15: white_block_1 is stacked on grey_block_1 in step 15? Let's see:

Original step after 14:

15. stack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → but white_block_1 was putdown in step 12.

So after step 12, white_block_1 is on the table. Then step 13: pickup black_block_1. Then step 14: stack black_block_1 on yellow_block_1. Then step 15: stack white_block_1 on grey_block_1 (assuming grey_block_1 is clear).

But grey_block_1 is clear after step 1 (unstack grey_2 from grey_1). Then in step 15, stack white_block_1 on grey_block_1. So:

15. stack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → white on grey_1

Then step 16: pickup grey_block_1 → but grey_block_1 has white_block_1 on top. So can't. So need to unstack white_block_1 first.

This is getting too complicated. Let's try to outline the full revised plan with all constraints:

1. unstack grey_2 grey_1

2. stack grey_2 blue_1

3. unstack grey_2 blue_1

4. putdown grey_2

5. pickup grey_2

6. stack grey_2 yellow_2

7. unstack grey_2 yellow_2

8. putdown grey_2

9. pickup blue_1

10. stack blue_1 black_1

11. unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1

12. putdown white_block_1

13. pickup black_block_1

14. stack black_block_1 yellow_block_1 → satisfies constraint 11 and 4

15. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1 → hold blue_1

16. stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2 → goal

But need to satisfy constraint 1: holding grey_block_1 and blue on black_block_1. But after step 14, blue is on black_block_1 (wait no: after step 10, blue is on black_1. Then step 14, black_1 is stacked on yellow_1. So blue is still on black_1, which is now on yellow_1. So blue is on black_1, which is on yellow_1. So in step 15, we unstack blue from black_1, which is allowed.

But to satisfy constraint 1: need to have a state where holding grey_1 and blue is on black_1. So after step 10, blue is on black_1 (which is on the table). So perhaps after step 10, we can pickup grey_1 and then put it down, but grey_1 is clear after step 1.

So steps after step 10:

11. pickup grey_block_1 → hold grey_1 (blue on black_1 → constraint 1 satisfied)

12. putdown grey_block_1

Then proceed with other steps.

But then we need to handle moving white_block_1 and yellow_block_1.

So revised plan:

1. unstack grey_2 grey_1 → hold grey_2

2. stack grey_2 blue_1 → grey_2 on blue_1

3. unstack grey_2 blue_1 → hold grey_2

4. putdown grey_2 → on table

5. pickup grey_2 → again

6. stack grey_2 yellow_2 → grey_2 on yellow_2

7. unstack grey_2 yellow_2 → hold grey_2

8. putdown grey_2 → on table

9. pickup blue_1 → hold blue_1

10. stack blue_1 black_1 → blue on black_1

11. pickup grey_block_1 → hold grey_1 (constraint 1: holding grey_1 and blue on black_1 → satisfied)

12. putdown grey_block_1 → on table

13. unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1 → hold white_1

14. stack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → white on grey_1

15. pickup black_block_1 → hold black_1

16. stack black_block_1 yellow_block_1 → black on yellow_1 (constraint 11)

17. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1 → hold blue_1

18. stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2 → goal

Now, check all constraints:

1. Step 11: holding grey_1, blue on black_1 → satisfied.

2. grey_1 clear after step 1 → step 1 unstack grey_2, grey_1 becomes clear → satisfied.

3. In step 14, white_1 is on grey_1. So either grey_1 on white_1 (no) or yellow_1 clear. After step 13, white_1 is unstacked from yellow_1, so yellow_1 is clear. So constraint 3 is satisfied in step 13 or 14.

4. Step 16: black_1 on yellow_1 (so yellow_1 not on table), and black_1 has blue_1 (from step 10, but after step 16, black_1 is on yellow_1, and blue_1 was unstacked in step 17. Wait, no. After step 10, blue_1 is on black_1. Then step 16 stacks black_1 on yellow_1. So blue_1 is still on black_1. So in step 16, black_1 is on yellow_1 and has blue_1 on top. So yellow_1 is not on table (satisfies part 1 of constraint 4), and black_1 has blue_1 (part 2). So constraint 4 is satisfied.

5. blue not on table in steps 10, 17, 18 → satisfied.

6. For step 10 (blue not on table), there was step 6 where yellow_2 was not clear. So satisfied.

7. yellow_2 clear in steps 0 (initial), step 7 (after unstack), step 8, etc. → satisfied.

8. In step 7, yellow_2 is clear. After that, step 8 puts grey_2 on table, which satisfies "grey_2 on table" → so constraint 8 is satisfied.

9. Step 9, 17, 18: holding blue → satisfied.

10. When holding blue (step 9, 17, 18), earlier step 2 where grey_2 was on blue → satisfied.

11. Step 16: black_1 on yellow_1 → satisfied.

12. Constraint 12: black_1 not on yellow_2 in some state. Initially true, and unless we stack black_1 on yellow_2, which we don't. So satisfied.

13. If black_1 is not on yellow_2 (always true in our plan), then in that state or after, hold white_1. After step 13, we are holding white_1 (step 13-14). So satisfied.

14. Constraint 14: grey_2 not on black_1 in some state. Initially true. After step 5-8, grey_2 is on table. So satisfied.

15. If grey_2 is not on black_1 (which is always true), then in that state or after, white_1 has a block on top. After step 14, white_1 is on grey_1. So white_1 has nothing on top (since step 14 is stack white_1 on grey_1). So this is a problem. Constraint 15 requires that if grey_2 is not on black_1, then white_1 has a block on top in that state or after. But in our plan, after step 14, white_1 is on grey_1 and clear. So no block on top of white_1. This violates constraint 15.

Thus, we need to ensure that whenever grey_2 is not on black_1 (which is always), there is a state where white_1 has a block on top. To satisfy this, we need to stack something on white_1.

In our current plan, after step 14, white_1 is on grey_1. So white_1 is on grey_1, which is on the table. So white_1 is clear. To satisfy the constraint, we need to have a block on top of white_1. So perhaps stack another block on white_1.

For example, after step 14, we can stack another block on white_1. Like grey_2.

So step 15: pickup grey_2 (which is on table after step 8)

16. stack grey_2 white_block_1 → grey_2 on white_1

This would make white_1 not clear. So in step 16, white_1 has grey_2 on top, satisfying the constraint.

But then, this adds steps. Let's adjust the plan:

After step 14 (stack white_1 on grey_1):

15. pickup grey_2 → from table

16. stack grey_2 white_block_1 → grey_2 on white_1

Now, in step 16, white_1 has grey_2 on top. So whenever grey_2 is not on black_1 (which is always), in state 16, white_1 has a block on top. So constraint 15 is satisfied.

Then proceed with the other steps:

17. pickup black_block_1 → but black_1 is under blue_1 and on yellow_1. Wait, after step 10, blue_1 is on black_1. Then step 16 is stack grey_2 on white_1. So black_1 is on the table with blue_1 on top. Then step 17: unstack blue_1 from black_1 to move it.

But this complicates the earlier steps. Let me rework the plan to include stacking grey_2 on white_1:

Revised steps after step 14:

14. stack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → white on grey_1

15. pickup grey_2 → from table

16. stack grey_2 white_block_1 → grey_2 on white_1 (now white_1 has a block on top)

17. unstack grey_2 white_block_1 → hold grey_2

18. putdown grey_2 → on table

19. pickup black_block_1 → but black_block_1 has blue_block_1 on top. So need to unstack blue_block_1 first.

19. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1 → hold blue_1

20. stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2 → goal

But this adds more steps. However, this ensures that constraint 15 is satisfied when grey_2 is on white_1.

But now, after step 16, white_1 has grey_2 on top. So constraint 15 is satisfied: in state 16, white_1 is not clear.

Thus, the full plan with all constraints would be:

```
1. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
2. stack grey_block_2 blue_block_1
3. unstack grey_block_2 blue_block_1
4. putdown grey_block_2
5. pickup grey_block_2
6. stack grey_block_2 yellow_block_2
7. unstack grey_block_2 yellow_block_2
8. putdown grey_block_2
9. pickup blue_block_1
10. stack blue_block_1 black_block_1
11. pickup grey_block_1
12. putdown grey_block_1
13. unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1
14. stack white_block_1 grey_block_1
15. pickup grey_block_2
16. stack grey_block_2 white_block_1
17. unstack grey_block_2 white_block_1
18. putdown grey_block_2
19. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
20. stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2
```

But I need to check if this plan satisfies all constraints. However, this is getting very long and might not be optimal. There might be a shorter way. But given the complexity of the constraints, it's challenging to find a shorter plan.

Final check for the constraints:

- Constraint 1: Step 11 (holding grey_1, blue on black_1)
- Constraint 2: Step 1 makes grey_1 clear
- Constraint 3: After step 13, yellow_1 is clear
- Constraint 4: Step 10 and 14: yellow_1 is on grey_1? No, step 14: white_block_1 is on grey_block_1. Wait, step 14: stack white_block_1 on grey_block_1. Then step 13: unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1. So yellow_block_1 is clear after step 13. So constraint 3 is satisfied by yellow_block_1 being clear in step 13.

But constraint 4 requires yellow_block_1 not on the table and black_block_1 has a block on top. In step 10, black_block_1 has blue_block_1 on top. But yellow_block_1 is on the table (step 13). So this is not satisfied. So the plan still doesn't meet constraint 4. Oops.

This indicates that the current plan doesn't satisfy constraint 4. So we need to adjust it to move yellow_block_1 off the table.

This problem is extremely complex due to the multiple interacting constraints. Given the time constraints, I'll try to find a plan that meets all the constraints, even if it's longer.

An optimal plan may require carefully sequencing actions to satisfy each constraint. However, due to the extensive constraints and the need to backtrack, creating such a plan manually is error-prone. Given the time, I'll proceed with the best possible attempt, acknowledging that it might not be optimal but meets the constraints.
