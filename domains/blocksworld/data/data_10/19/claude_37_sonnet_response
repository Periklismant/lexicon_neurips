Let's systematically analyze this problem to come up with a valid plan. First, let's summarize the initial state, the goal, and the constraints.

Initial State:
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- purple_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1
- grey_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1
- purple_block_2 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is clear
- yellow_block_2 is clear
- purple_block_2 is clear
- The arm is not holding any block

So the initial state can be represented as:
```
    yellow_block_2
    /
yellow_block_1      grey_block_2
/                  /
purple_block_1    brown_block_1
                 /
                grey_block_1

purple_block_2
```

Goal:
- yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1

Constraints:
1. At some point: purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 AND grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1.
2. In all states: yellow_block_2 is not on the table.
3. At some point: you are holding yellow_block_1.
4. Before holding yellow_block_1, either purple_block_2 is not on the table or you are holding purple_block_2.
5. At some point: brown_block_1 is not clear (i.e., there's a block on it).
6. If at some state brown_block_1 is not clear, then at that state or later: brown_block_1 is clear OR you are holding grey_block_2.
7. At some point: brown_block_1 is not on the table.
8. If brown_block_1 is not on the table, then at that state or later: purple_block_1 is not clear.
9. At some point: brown_block_1 is clear.
10. Before brown_block_1 is clear, purple_block_2 was not on the table.
11. At some point: purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 OR you are holding grey_block_1.
12. At some point: grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1 AND yellow_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2.
13. In all states: grey_block_2 is not on the table.
14. At some point: you are holding grey_block_1 AND brown_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2.

Now, let's try to satisfy all these constraints while achieving the goal.

Let me think through a plan:

First, I need to ensure that all the constraints are satisfied. For instance, I need to have yellow_block_1 on top of brown_block_1 (the goal). But I also need to have a state where grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1 AND yellow_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2 (constraint 12). And I need to make sure yellow_block_2 is never on the table (constraint 2).

Let's start by visualizing the goal state:
```
yellow_block_1
/
brown_block_1
/
?
```

Where should brown_block_1 be? According to constraint 7, at some point, brown_block_1 should not be on the table. But it doesn't say it should never be on the table. So, in the final state, brown_block_1 could be on the table. However, constraint 8 states that if brown_block_1 is not on the table, then at that state or later, purple_block_1 should not be clear. This implies that there's a relationship between brown_block_1 and purple_block_1.

Let's take a different approach. Let's imagine some intermediate states that we need to pass through to satisfy all constraints, and then try to connect these states to form a plan.

From constraint 14, we need to have a state where we're holding grey_block_1 and brown_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2.

From constraint 12, we need to have a state where grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1 and yellow_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2.

From constraint 1, we need to have a state where purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1.

From constraint 11, we need to have a state where either purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 or we're holding grey_block_1.

From constraint 4, before holding yellow_block_1, either purple_block_2 is not on the table or we're holding purple_block_2.

From constraint 10, before brown_block_1 is clear (which according to constraint 9 should happen at some point), purple_block_2 was not on the table.

Let's try to find a sequence of actions that transition through these states, satisfy all constraints, and finally achieve our goal.

Let's start from the initial state and gradually progress:

Starting state:
```
    yellow_block_2
    /
yellow_block_1      grey_block_2
/                  /
purple_block_1    brown_block_1
                 /
                grey_block_1

purple_block_2
```

First, we need to create a state where brown_block_1 is clear (constraint 9) and purple_block_2 is not on the table (constraint 10).

1. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
Now, brown_block_1 is clear, and we're holding grey_block_2. Constraint 9 is satisfied. We still need to make purple_block_2 not on the table (constraint 10).

2. stack grey_block_2 purple_block_2
Now, brown_block_1 is clear and purple_block_2 is not on the table (because grey_block_2 is on it). Constraints 9 and 10 are satisfied.

From constraint 14, we need a state where we're holding grey_block_1 and brown_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2.

3. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
Now, we're holding brown_block_1 and grey_block_1 is on the table and clear.

4. stack brown_block_1 purple_block_2
Brown_block_1 is now on top of purple_block_2. But we're not holding grey_block_1 yet.

5. pickup grey_block_1
Now, we're holding grey_block_1 and brown_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2. Constraint 14 is satisfied.

From constraint 1, we need a state where purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1.

6. putdown grey_block_1
Grey_block_1 is on the table.

7. unstack grey_block_2 purple_block_2
We're holding grey_block_2.

8. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
Grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1.

9. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
We're holding yellow_block_2.

10. stack yellow_block_2 grey_block_2
Yellow_block_2 is on top of grey_block_2.

11. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
We're holding yellow_block_1. Constraint 3 is satisfied.

12. stack yellow_block_1 grey_block_2
Yellow_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2 and grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1. Constraint 12 is satisfied.

13. unstack yellow_block_2 grey_block_2
We're holding yellow_block_2.

Wait, I think I made a mistake. I added yellow_block_1 on grey_block_2, and then tried to access yellow_block_2 which would be beneath it. Let me rethink.

Let's go back to step 9.

9. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
We're holding yellow_block_2.

10. stack yellow_block_2 grey_block_2
Yellow_block_2 is on top of grey_block_2.

11. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
We're holding yellow_block_1. Constraint 3 is satisfied.

12. stack yellow_block_1 grey_block_2
Now, yellow_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2, yellow_block_2 is on top of grey_block_2, and grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1. Constraint 12 appears to be satisfied.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Yellow_block_1 and yellow_block_2 can't both be directly on top of grey_block_2. Let me re-evaluate.

I think the correct approach for step 12 should be to place yellow_block_1 on top of yellow_block_2, which is on top of grey_block_2, which is on top of grey_block_1.

12. stack yellow_block_1 yellow_block_2
Now, yellow_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2, which is on top of grey_block_2, which is on top of grey_block_1. I think this does not exactly satisfy constraint 12, which specifically asks for yellow_block_1 to be on top of grey_block_2. Let me reconsider.

I think the right approach is to ensure that grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1 and, separately, yellow_block_1 is on grey_block_2, not necessarily at the same time. But constraint 12 specifically says "The following conditions are all true: "grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1", "yellow_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2"". This means both conditions need to be true simultaneously in at least one state.

OK, so yelllow_block_2 is in the way. Let's revise:

9. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
We're holding yellow_block_2.

10. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_1
Yellow_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1, ensuring it's not on the table (constraint 2).

11. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
We're holding yellow_block_1. Constraint 3 is satisfied.

12. stack yellow_block_1 grey_block_2
Now, yellow_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2, and grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1. Constraint 12 is satisfied.

From constraint 1, we need a state where purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1.

13. unstack yellow_block_1 grey_block_2
We're holding yellow_block_1.

14. unstack yellow_block_2 purple_block_1
We're holding yellow_block_2.

Wait, I'm making mistakes again. Since we're holding yellow_block_1 after step 13, we can't immediately execute step 14, which requires us to not be holding any blocks. Let's revise again.

13. unstack yellow_block_1 grey_block_2
We're holding yellow_block_1.

14. putdown yellow_block_1
Yellow_block_1 is on the table.

15. unstack yellow_block_2 purple_block_1
We're holding yellow_block_2.

16. stack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
Yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1, ensuring it's not on the table (constraint 2).

17. pickup purple_block_1
We're holding purple_block_1.

18. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
Purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1, and grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1. Constraint 1 is satisfied.

Now, I need to satisfy the goal, which is to have yellow_block_1 on top of brown_block_1.

19. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
We're holding purple_block_1.

20. putdown purple_block_1
Purple_block_1 is on the table.

21. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
We're holding yellow_block_2.

22. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_1
Yellow_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1, ensuring it's not on the table (constraint 2).

23. pickup yellow_block_1
We're holding yellow_block_1.

24. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1
Yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1. Goal achieved!

Wait, I keep making errors. Let's be careful and ensure that all constraints are satisfied. I'm going to start over more methodically.

Initial state:
```
    yellow_block_2
    /
yellow_block_1      grey_block_2
/                  /
purple_block_1    brown_block_1
                 /
                grey_block_1

purple_block_2
```

From constraint 4, before holding yellow_block_1 (which we need to do as per constraint 3), either purple_block_2 is not on the table or we're holding purple_block_2. So, we first need to make purple_block_2 not on the table.

1. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
We're holding grey_block_2.

2. stack grey_block_2 purple_block_2
Grey_block_2 is on top of purple_block_2, so purple_block_2 is not on the table anymore.

From constraint 10, before brown_block_1 is clear (which according to constraint 9 should happen at some point), purple_block_2 is not on the table. Since we've already made purple_block_2 not on the table, brown_block_1 can be clear, which is already the case after step 1.

From constraint 14, we need a state where we're holding grey_block_1 and brown_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2.

3. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
We're holding brown_block_1, and grey_block_1 is on the table and clear.

4. stack brown_block_1 purple_block_2
Brown_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2, and grey_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1.

5. pickup grey_block_1
We're holding grey_block_1, and brown_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2. Constraint 14 is satisfied.

From constraint 13, grey_block_2 must never be on the table. Currently, grey_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1.

From constraint 12, we need a state where grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1 and yellow_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2.

6. putdown grey_block_1
Grey_block_1 is on the table.

7. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
We're holding grey_block_2.

8. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
Grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1.

9. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
We're holding yellow_block_2.

10. stack yellow_block_2 brown_block_1
Yellow_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1, ensuring it's not on the table (constraint 2).

11. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
We're holding yellow_block_1. But wait, before holding yellow_block_1, either purple_block_2 is not on the table or we're holding purple_block_2 (constraint 4). Let's check: purple_block_2 is not on the table (it has brown_block_1 and yellow_block_2 on it), so constraint 4 is satisfied.

12. stack yellow_block_1 grey_block_2
Yellow_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2, and grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1. Constraint 12 is satisfied.

From constraint 1, we need a state where purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1.

13. unstack yellow_block_1 grey_block_2
We're holding yellow_block_1.

14. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
Yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1. But this violates constraint 8 because we just moved brown_block_1 to not be on the table at step 4, and by step 14, we've put yellow_block_1 back on top of purple_block_1, which doesn't align with the constraint that if brown_block_1 is not on the table, then at that state or later, purple_block_1 should not be clear. Let's rethink.

Actually, the constraint says "If brown_block_1 is not on the table, then at that state or later, purple_block_1 is not clear." Since yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1, purple_block_1 is not clear, so the constraint is satisfied.

15. unstack yellow_block_2 brown_block_1
We're holding yellow_block_2.

16. stack yellow_block_2 grey_block_2
Yellow_block_2 is on top of grey_block_2, ensuring it's not on the table (constraint 2).

17. pickup purple_block_1
We're holding purple_block_1. But wait, we just said yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1 at step 14. So, purple_block_1 is not clear, and we can't pick it up. Let's reconsider.

I'm getting a bit confused with the sequence. Let's refactor:

13. unstack yellow_block_1 grey_block_2
We're holding yellow_block_1.

14. putdown yellow_block_1
Yellow_block_1 is on the table. Wait, actually, let's not do this because we'll need it on brown_block_1 for the goal. Let's try a different sequence.

Let's reconsider. If we put yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1 (our goal), brown_block_1 is on purple_block_2, and grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1, we might satisfy multiple constraints at once.

13. unstack yellow_block_1 grey_block_2
We're holding yellow_block_1.

14. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1
Yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1. Goal achieved! But we still need to check for other constraints.

15. unstack yellow_block_2 brown_block_1
Wait, that's impossible because yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 from the previous step, so brown_block_1 isn't clear.

I think I've been misinterpreting constraint 1. It says "purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 AND grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1", which means both conditions need to be true in at least one state. Right now, grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1, but purple_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1.

I need to figure out a sequence where purple_block_1 can be on top of brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1, but also ensuring all other constraints are met.

Let's refactor again. After step 12, where yellow_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2, and grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1, let's move toward satisfying constraint 1.

13. unstack yellow_block_1 grey_block_2
We're holding yellow_block_1.

14. putdown yellow_block_1
Yellow_block_1 is on the table.

15. unstack yellow_block_2 brown_block_1
We're holding yellow_block_2.

16. stack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
Yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1, ensuring it's not on the table (constraint 2).

17. pickup purple_block_1
We're holding purple_block_1.

18. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
Purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1, and grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1. Constraint 1 is satisfied.

Now I need to make yellow_block_1 on top of brown_block_1 for the goal.

19. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
We're holding purple_block_1.

20. putdown purple_block_1
Purple_block_1 is on the table.

21. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
We're holding yellow_block_2.

22. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_1
Yellow_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1, ensuring it's not on the table (constraint 2).

23. pickup yellow_block_1
We're holding yellow_block_1. Constraint 3 is satisfied.

24. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1
Yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1. Goal achieved!

Let's double-check all constraints:

Constraint 1: "At some point: purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 AND grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1."
This is satisfied after step 18.

Constraint 2: "In all states: yellow_block_2 is not on the table."
We've ensured that yellow_block_2 is always placed on top of another block, so it's never on the table. This constraint is satisfied.

Constraint 3: "At some point: you are holding yellow_block_1."
This is satisfied at step 23.

Constraint 4: "Before holding yellow_block_1, either purple_block_2 is not on the table or you are holding purple_block_2."
This is satisfied because before step 23, purple_block_2 is not on the table (it has brown_block_1 on it).

Constraint 5: "At some point: brown_block_1 is not clear."
This is satisfied after step 18 when purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1, and also after step 24 when yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1.

Constraint 6: "If at some state brown_block_1 is not clear, then at that state or later: brown_block_1 is clear OR you are holding grey_block_2."
Brown_block_1 is not clear after step 18, but it becomes clear after step 19 when we unstack purple_block_1. Brown_block_1 is also not clear after step 24, but since that's our goal state, we don't need to restore it. This constraint is satisfied.

Constraint 7: "At some point: brown_block_1 is not on the table."
This is satisfied after step 4 when brown_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2.

Constraint 8: "If brown_block_1 is not on the table, then at that state or later: purple_block_1 is not clear."
After step 4, brown_block_1 is not on the table, and after step 14, purple_block_1 is not clear (because yellow_block_1 is on it). However, I observe that after step 20, purple_block_1 is on the table and clear, and brown_block_1 is not on the table. This violates the constraint.

I misunderstood the constraint. It says "If brown_block_1 is not on the table at some state s, then purple_block_1 is not clear at state s or some state after s." It doesn't mean purple_block_1 should always be not clear if brown_block_1 is not on the table. It just means that if brown_block_1 is not on the table, then at that state or at some point later, we should ensure purple_block_1 is not clear.

After step 4, brown_block_1 is not on the table. After step 16, yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1, and yellow_block_1 is on the table, so purple_block_1 is clear at this point. But after step 22, yellow_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1, making purple_block_1 not clear. So, the constraint is satisfied.

Constraint 9: "At some point: brown_block_1 is clear."
This is satisfied after step 1 when we unstack grey_block_2.

Constraint 10: "Before brown_block_1 is clear, purple_block_2 was not on the table."
If brown_block_1 is clear after step 1, then purple_block_2 should be not on the table before that. But purple_block_2 is on the table in the initial state. This seems to violate the constraint.

I may have misunderstood the constraint. It says "If brown_block_1 is clear at some state, then at some point earlier, purple_block_2 was not on the table." But in the initial state, brown_block_1 is not clear (because grey_block_2 is on it). After step 1, brown_block_1 is clear. But purple_block_2 has been on the table since the initial state, and still is at step 1. So, this constraint is not satisfied in my current plan.

I need to revise my plan to ensure purple_block_2 is not on the table at some point before brown_block_1 becomes clear.

Let's adjust. In the initial state, brown_block_1 is not clear because grey_block_2 is on it. Let's make purple_block_2 not on the table, then make brown_block_1 clear.

1. pickup purple_block_2
We're holding purple_block_2.

2. putdown purple_block_2
Purple_block_2 is back on the table. This doesn't make sense. Let's try a different approach.

1. pickup purple_block_2
We're holding purple_block_2. Constraint 10 would be satisfied if brown_block_1 becomes clear later.

2. stack purple_block_2 yellow_block_2
Purple_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_2.

3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
We're holding grey_block_2, and brown_block_1 is clear. Constraint 10 is satisfied.

4. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
Grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1.

But wait, this would put grey_block_2 on the table, violating constraint 13, which says "In all states: grey_block_2 is not on the table."

Initial state: grey_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1, which is on top of grey_block_1, which is on the table. So grey_block_2 is not on the table to begin with.

I think I need to be more careful. Let's go step by step and ensure all constraints are satisfied.

OK, I think I understand my confusion. Constraint 10 states "Before brown_block_1 is clear, purple_block_2 was not on the table."

If I'm understanding it correctly, I need to have purple_block_2 not be on the table for awhile, and then at some point after that, brown_block_1 must be clear.

In the initial state, brown_block_1 is not clear, and purple_block_2 is on the table. So, I need to first make purple_block_2 not on the table, then make brown_block_1 clear, and then proceed with the rest of the plan.

1. pickup purple_block_2
We're holding purple_block_2. Constraint 10 would be satisfied if brown_block_1 becomes clear later.

2. stack purple_block_2 yellow_block_2
Purple_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_2, which is on top of yellow_block_1, which is on top of purple_block_1, which is on the table.

So the current state is:
```
       purple_block_2
       /
    yellow_block_2
    /
yellow_block_1      grey_block_2
/                  /
purple_block_1    brown_block_1
                 /
                grey_block_1
```

3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
We're holding grey_block_2, and brown_block_1 is clear. Constraint 10 is satisfied.

4. stack grey_block_2 purple_block_2
Grey_block_2 is on top of purple_block_2. This satisfies constraint 13, which says grey_block_2 should never be on the table.

5. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
We're holding brown_block_1, and grey_block_1 is on the table and clear.

6. stack brown_block_1 purple_block_1
Brown_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1. This satisfies constraint 7, which says at some point, brown_block_1 should not be on the table.

7. pickup grey_block_1
We're holding grey_block_1, and brown_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1. This satisfies constraint 14, which says at some point, we should be holding grey_block_1 and brown_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2. Wait, the constraint specifies brown_block_1 on top of purple_block_2, but we have brown_block_1 on top of purple_block_1. This doesn't satisfy the constraint.

Let's backtrack a bit.

5. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
We're holding brown_block_1, and grey_block_1 is on the table and clear.

6. stack brown_block_1 purple_block_2
Brown_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2.

7. pickup grey_block_1
We're holding grey_block_1, and brown_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2. This satisfies constraint 14.

Constraint 8 states "If brown_block_1 is not on the table, then at that state or later: purple_block_1 is not clear." After step 6, brown_block_1 is not on the table. So, at this or some later state, purple_block_1 should not be clear. Currently, purple_block_1 is clear, so this constraint is not yet satisfied.

8. putdown grey_block_1
Grey_block_1 is on the table.

9. unstack grey_block_2 purple_block_2
We're holding grey_block_2.

10. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
Grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1.

11. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
We're holding yellow_block_2.

12. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_1
Yellow_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1. This satisfies constraint 8 because purple_block_1 is no longer clear.

13. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
Wait, we just stacked yellow_block_2 on purple_block_1, so yellow_block_1 can't be on purple_block_1.

I think I made a mistake. Let me think about the initial state again:
```
    yellow_block_2
    /
yellow_block_1      grey_block_2
/                  /
purple_block_1    brown_block_1
                 /
                grey_block_1

purple_block_2
```

And after step 12, the state would be:
```
                   brown_block_1
                  /
    yellow_block_2     grey_block_2
    /                 /
purple_block_1       grey_block_1

purple_block_2
```

Actually, I made a mistake above. After step 12, the state would be:
```
                  brown_block_1
                 /
grey_block_2    yellow_block_2
/               /
grey_block_1   purple_block_1

yellow_block_1
```

Actually, I think I'm making too many tracking errors. Let's explicitly start with the initial state and explicitly update it step by step:

Initial State:
```
  yellow_block_2
  /
yellow_block_1      grey_block_2
/                  /
purple_block_1    brown_block_1
                 /
                grey_block_1

purple_block_2
```

1. pickup purple_block_2
Now we're holding purple_block_2.
```
  yellow_block_2
  /
yellow_block_1      grey_block_2
/                  /
purple_block_1    brown_block_1
                 /
                grey_block_1

(We're holding purple_block_2)
```

2. stack purple_block_2 yellow_block_2
Now purple_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_2.
```
  purple_block_2
  /
yellow_block_2      grey_block_2
/                  /
yellow_block_1    brown_block_1
/                 /
purple_block_1   grey_block_1
```

3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
Now we're holding grey_block_2 and brown_block_1 is clear.
```
                    brown_block_1
                   /
  purple_block_2  grey_block_1
  /
yellow_block_2    
/                 
yellow_block_1    
/                 
purple_block_1   

(We're holding grey_block_2)
```

4. stack grey_block_2 purple_block_2
Now grey_block_2 is on top of purple_block_2.
```
    grey_block_2
   /
  purple_block_2  
  /                   brown_block_1
yellow_block_2       /
/                   grey_block_1
yellow_block_1    
/                 
purple_block_1  
```

5. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
Now we're holding brown_block_1 and grey_block_1 is clear.
```
    grey_block_2
   /
  purple_block_2  
  /                  
yellow_block_2       grey_block_1
/                 
yellow_block_1    
/                 
purple_block_1  

(We're holding brown_block_1)
```

6. stack brown_block_1 purple_block_2
Now brown_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2.
```
    brown_block_1
   /
  grey_block_2  
  /                  
  purple_block_2     grey_block_1
  /
yellow_block_2       
/                 
yellow_block_1    
/                 
purple_block_1  
```

Hmm, I think this is getting unweildy, and I'm making a lot of tracking errors. Let me try again with a better representation.

Initial state: (table top)
- grey_block_1 with brown_block_1 on top, with grey_block_2 on top.
- purple_block_1 with yellow_block_1 on top, with yellow_block_2 on top.
- purple_block_2 (clear).

1. pickup purple_block_2
Now we're holding purple_block_2.

2. stack purple_block_2 yellow_block_2
Now purple_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_2.
State:
- grey_block_1 with brown_block_1 on top, with grey_block_2 on top.
- purple_block_1 with yellow_block_1 on top, with yellow_block_2 on top, with purple_block_2 on top.

3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
Now we're holding grey_block_2 and brown_block_1 is clear.
State:
- grey_block_1 with brown_block_1 on top.
- purple_block_1 with yellow_block_1 on top, with yellow_block_2 on top, with purple_block_2 on top.
- (hand) grey_block_2.

4. stack grey_block_2 purple_block_2
Now grey_block_2 is on top of purple_block_2.
State:
- grey_block_1 with brown_block_1 on top.
- purple_block_1 with yellow_block_1 on top, with yellow_block_2 on top, with purple_block_2 on top, with grey_block_2 on top.

5. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
Now we're holding brown_block_1 and grey_block_1 is clear.
State:
- grey_block_1 (clear).
- purple_block_1 with yellow_block_1 on top, with yellow_block_2 on top, with purple_block_2 on top, with grey_block_2 on top.
- (hand) brown_block_1.

OK, wait, I think I understand my confusion from earlier. In constraint 14, it says to have brown_block_1 on purple_block_2 while I am holding grey_block_1, but in step 5 I'm now holding brown_block_1. Let me backtrack.

So after step 4, we have:
- grey_block_1 with brown_block_1 on top.
- purple_block_1 with yellow_block_1 on top, with yellow_block_2 on top, with purple_block_2 on top, with grey_block_2 on top.

Now I want to have brown_block_1 on purple_block_2 while I'm holding grey_block_1.

5. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
Now we're holding brown_block_1 and grey_block_1 is clear.
State:
- grey_block_1 (clear).
- purple_block_1 with yellow_block_1 on top, with yellow_block_2 on top, with purple_block_2 on top, with grey_block_2 on top.
- (hand) brown_block_1.

6. stack brown_block_1 grey_block_2
Now brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2.
State:
- grey_block_1 (clear).
- purple_block_1 with yellow_block_1 on top, with yellow_block_2 on top, with purple_block_2 on top, with grey_block_2 on top, with brown_block_1 on top.

Hmm, but the tower is getting too tall, and I'm not achieving the constraint. Let me think differently.

My previous mistake is that I'm building a single tower, which doesn't allow for flexibility. Let's create multiple smaller towers.

Initial state:
- Tower 1: grey_block_1 with brown_block_1 on top, with grey_block_2 on top.
- Tower 2: purple_block_1 with yellow_block_1 on top, with yellow_block_2 on top.
- Tower 3: purple_block_2 (clear).

1. pickup purple_block_2
Now we're holding purple_block_2.

2. stack purple_block_2 grey_block_2
Now purple_block_2 is on top of grey_block_2.
State:
- Tower 1: grey_block_1 with brown_block_1 on top, with grey_block_2 on top, with purple_block_2 on top.
- Tower 2: purple_block_1 with yellow_block_1 on top, with yellow_block_2 on top.

3. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
Now we're holding yellow_block_2.
State:
- Tower 1: grey_block_1 with brown_block_1 on top, with grey_block_2 on top, with purple_block_2 on top.
- Tower 2: purple_block_1 with yellow_block_1 on top.
- (hand) yellow_block_2.

4. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2
Now yellow_block_2 is on top of purple_block_2.
State:
- Tower 1: grey_block_1 with brown_block_1 on top, with grey_block_2 on top, with purple_block_2 on top, with yellow_block_2 on top.
- Tower 2: purple_block_1 with yellow_block_1 on top.

5. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
Now we're holding yellow_block_1.
State:
- Tower 1: grey_block_1 with brown_block_1 on top, with grey_block_2 on top, with purple_block_2 on top, with yellow_block_2 on top.
- Tower 2: purple_block_1 (clear).
- (hand) yellow_block_1.

6. stack yellow_block_1 yellow_block_2
Now yellow_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2.
State:
- Tower 1: grey_block_1 with brown_block_1 on top, with grey_block_2 on top, with purple_block_2 on top, with yellow_block_2 on top, with yellow_block_1 on top.
- Tower 2: purple_block_1 (clear).

7. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
Hmm, but I can't access brown_block_1 because it's not at the top of its tower.

I'm having trouble with the approach of stacking multiple blocks. Let me try a different approach.

Let's go back to the initial state:
```
  yellow_block_2
  /
yellow_block_1      grey_block_2
/                  /
purple_block_1    brown_block_1
                 /
                grey_block_1

purple_block_2
```

Constraint 10 states "Before brown_block_1 is clear, purple_block_2 was not on the table." In the initial state, brown_block_1 is not clear, and purple_block_2 is on the table. We need to make purple_block_2 not on the table, and then make brown_block_1 clear.

1. pickup purple_block_2
We're holding purple_block_2.

2. stack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
Purple_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1, so it's not on the table.

3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
We're holding grey_block_2, and brown_block_1 is clear. Constraint 10 is satisfied.

4. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
Grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1, which satisfies constraint 13 (grey_block_2 is not on the table).

5. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
We're holding brown_block_1, and grey_block_1 is now clear.

6. stack brown_block_1 purple_block_2
Brown_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2.

7. pickup grey_block_1
We're holding grey_block_1, and brown_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2. This satisfies constraint 14.

From constraint 1, we need a state where purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1.

8. putdown grey_block_1
Grey_block_1 is on the table.

9. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
We're holding yellow_block_2.

10. stack yellow_block_2 grey_block_2
Yellow_block_2 is on top of grey_block_2.

11. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
Wait, that's incorrect. yellow_block_1 is not on purple_block_1 after step 2, because purple_block_2 is now on top of purple_block_1.

Let me try a different approach:

Initial state:
```
  yellow_block_2
  /
yellow_block_1      grey_block_2
/                  /
purple_block_1    brown_block_1
                 /
                grey_block_1

purple_block_2
```

Ugh. OK, this is getting unweildy. I think the reason I can't design a solution is that I can't parse the problem well. Let me go systematically.

First, I'm going to enumerate some of the most important constraints, starting with the goal.
Goal: yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1.

Constraint 1: At some point, purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1.

Constraint 2: In all states, yellow_block_2 is not on the table.

Constraint 8: If brown_block_1 is not on the table, then at that state or later, purple_block_1 is not clear.

Constraint 10: Before brown_block_1 is clear, purple_block_2 was not on the table.

Constraint 12: At some point, grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1 and yellow_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2.

Constraint 13: In all states, grey_block_2 is not on the table.

Constraint 14: At some point, you are holding grey_block_1 and brown_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2.

These seem like the most restrictive constraints.

From the initial state, let's make a plan that satisfies these constraints.

First, let's address constraint 10, which requires purple_block_2 to not be on the table before brown_block_1 is clear.

1. pickup purple_block_2
We're holding purple_block_2.

2. stack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
Purple_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1, so it's not on the table.

3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
We're holding grey_block_2, and brown_block_1 is clear. Constraint 10 is satisfied.

4. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
Grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1, satisfying constraint 13 (grey_block_2 is not on the table) and part of constraint 1.

Now, let's address constraint 14, which requires us to be holding grey_block_1 while brown_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2.

5. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
We're holding brown_block_1, and grey_block_1 is now clear.

6. stack brown_block_1 purple_block_2
Brown_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2.

7. pickup grey_block_1
We're holding grey_block_1, and brown_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2. Constraint 14 is satisfied.

Now, let's satisfy constraint 12, which requires grey_block_2 to be on top of grey_block_1 and yellow_block_1 to be on top of grey_block_2.

8. putdown grey_block_1
Grey_block_1 is on the table.

9. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
We're holding yellow_block_2.

10. stack yellow_block_2 grey_block_2
Yellow_block_2 is on top of grey_block_2.

11. pickup yellow_block_1
We're holding yellow_block_1.

12. stack yellow_block_1 yellow_block_2
Yellow_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2, which is on top of grey_block_2, which is on top of grey_block_1.

Wait, that's not right. Constraint 12 specifies "yellow_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2", not "yellow_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2".

Let's correct:

11. pickup yellow_block_1
We're holding yellow_block_1.

12. unstack yellow_block_2 grey_block_2
Wait, that's impossible because we can't hold two blocks at the same time.

Let's backtrack:

9. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
We're holding yellow_block_2.

10. stack yellow_block_2 brown_block_1
Yellow_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1, satisfying constraint 2 (yellow_block_2 is not on the table).

11. pickup yellow_block_1
We're holding yellow_block_1.

12. stack yellow_block_1 grey_block_2
Yellow_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2, and grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1. Constraint 12 is satisfied.

Now, let's address constraint 1, which requires purple_block_1 to be on top of brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 to be on top of grey_block_1.

13. unstack yellow_block_1 grey_block_2
We're holding yellow_block_1.

14. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
Yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1.

15. unstack yellow_block_2 brown_block_1
We're holding yellow_block_2.

16. stack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
Yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1, satisfying constraint 2 (yellow_block_2 is not on the table).

17. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_2
We're holding brown_block_1.

18. putdown brown_block_1
Brown_block_1 is on the table.

19. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
We're holding purple_block_2.

20. stack purple_block_2 yellow_block_2
Purple_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_2.

21. pickup brown_block_1
We're holding brown_block_1.

22. stack brown_block_1 purple_block_1
Brown_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1.

23. pickup purple_block_1
Hmm, but that's impossible because brown_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1.

This is not working. Let's try a different approach. My confusion partly stemms from the fact that if purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1, it means I've displaced grey_block_2.

Actually, I noticed a mistake I was making. Constraint 1 states: purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 AND grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1. Thus, purple_block_1 is ON TOP of brown_block_1, not the other way around. Let me clarify the rest of the constraints:

Constraint 8: If brown_block_1 is not on the table, then at that state or later, purple_block_1 is not clear.

This means if we move brown_block_1 to be not on the table, then at that point or later, purple_block_1 can't be a "leaf" node, i.e., someone needs to be on top of it.

Let's try a plan again.
