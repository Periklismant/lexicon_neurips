Let's start by analyzing the initial state of the world and the goal:

Initial state:
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- purple_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1
- grey_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1
- purple_block_2 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is clear
- yellow_block_2 is clear
- purple_block_2 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Goal:
- yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1

To reach this goal, we need to:
1. Move yellow_block_1 from purple_block_1 to brown_block_1

But this is not straightforward because:
1. yellow_block_1 has yellow_block_2 on top of it, so it's not clear
2. brown_block_1 has grey_block_2 on top of it, so it's not clear

So, our plan should involve:
1. Remove yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1
2. Remove grey_block_2 from brown_block_1
3. Move yellow_block_1 from purple_block_1 to brown_block_1

Let's plan this step by step.

Step 1: Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1
```
unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
```
After this action, we're holding yellow_block_2, and yellow_block_1 is clear.

Step 2: We need to put yellow_block_2 somewhere. Let's put it on the table.
```
putdown yellow_block_2
```
Now yellow_block_2 is on the table, and we're not holding any block.

Step 3: Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1
```
unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
```
After this action, we're holding grey_block_2, and brown_block_1 is clear.

Step 4: We need to put grey_block_2 somewhere. Let's put it on the table.
```
putdown grey_block_2
```
Now grey_block_2 is on the table, and we're not holding any block.

Step 5: Unstack yellow_block_1 from purple_block_1
```
unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
```
After this action, we're holding yellow_block_1, and purple_block_1 is clear.

Step 6: Stack yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1
```
stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1
```
After this action, yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1, which is our goal.

So, the plan is:
```
unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
putdown yellow_block_2
unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
putdown grey_block_2
unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1
```

Actually, let me verify this by checking each step's preconditions and effects against the state of the world.

Initial state:
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- purple_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1
- grey_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1
- grey_block_2 is clear
- yellow_block_2 is clear
- purple_block_2 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Step 1: Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1
Preconditions:
- yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1 ✅
- yellow_block_2 is clear ✅
- you are not holding any block ✅

Effects:
- yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- you are holding yellow_block_2

Step 2: Putdown yellow_block_2
Preconditions:
- you are holding yellow_block_2 ✅

Effects:
- yellow_block_2 is on the table
- yellow_block_2 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Step 3: Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1
Preconditions:
- grey_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1 ✅
- grey_block_2 is clear ✅
- you are not holding any block ✅

Effects:
- grey_block_2 is not on top of brown_block_1
- brown_block_1 is clear
- you are holding grey_block_2

Step 4: Putdown grey_block_2
Preconditions:
- you are holding grey_block_2 ✅

Effects:
- grey_block_2 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Step 5: Unstack yellow_block_1 from purple_block_1
Preconditions:
- yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1 ✅
- yellow_block_1 is clear ✅
- you are not holding any block ✅

Effects:
- yellow_block_1 is not on top of purple_block_1
- purple_block_1 is clear
- you are holding yellow_block_1

Step 6: Stack yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1
Preconditions:
- you are holding yellow_block_1 ✅
- brown_block_1 is clear ✅

Effects:
- yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- brown_block_1 is not clear
- you are not holding any block

This reaches our goal: yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1.

So, the final plan is:
```
unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
putdown yellow_block_2
unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
putdown grey_block_2
unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1
```

This is a valid plan to reach the goal. It's also optimal, as each step is necessary to reach the goal.
