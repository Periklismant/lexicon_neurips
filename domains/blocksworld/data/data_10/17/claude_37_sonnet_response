Let's analyze the initial state and goal of this problem, along with the constraints.

Initial state:
- white_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_2 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on top of white_block_2
- orange_block_2 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1, orange_block_1, green_block_1, orange_block_2, red_block_1 are clear
- you are not holding any block

Goal:
- yellow_block_1 is on the table

Constraints:
1. "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" must hold in at least one state. This means we must move yellow_block_1 from white_block_1 at some point.
2. If "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" holds in some state s, then "white_block_2 is clear OR white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" must hold in state s or later. This means that after moving yellow_block_1, we need to ensure white_block_2 is clear or white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1.
3. "green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1" must hold in at least one state. Since green_block_1 is initially on white_block_2, not on yellow_block_1, this is already satisfied in the initial state.
4. If "green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1" holds in some state s, then "orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2" must hold in state s or later. This means we need to stack orange_block_1 on white_block_2 at some point.
5. "there is a block on top of red_block_1" must hold in at least one state. This means we need to stack some block on red_block_1.
6. "orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1" must hold in at least one state. Since orange_block_1 is initially on the table, not on red_block_1, this is already satisfied in the initial state.
7. If "orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1" holds in some state s, then "orange_block_1 is not on the table OR there is a block on top of red_block_1" must hold in state s or later. This means we need to either move orange_block_1 from the table or put a block on red_block_1.
8. "green_block_1 is not clear AND orange_block_1 is not clear" must hold in at least one state. This means we need to stack blocks on both green_block_1 and orange_block_1.
9. "white_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1" must hold in at least one state. Since white_block_1 is initially on the table, not on orange_block_1, this is already satisfied in the initial state.
10. If "white_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1" holds in some state s, then "red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2 OR orange_block_2 is not on the table" must hold in state s or later. This means we need to either stack red_block_1 on orange_block_2 or move orange_block_2 from the table.
11. "you are holding yellow_block_1" must hold in at least one state. This means we need to pick up yellow_block_1 at some point.
12. If "you are holding yellow_block_1" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which "white_block_1 is clear OR red_block_1 is not on the table" is true. This means before picking up yellow_block_1, we need to ensure white_block_1 is clear or red_block_1 is not on the table. Since yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 initially, white_block_1 is not clear in the initial state. So, we need to move red_block_1 from the table before picking up yellow_block_1.
13. "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" must hold in at least one state. Since a block cannot be on top of itself, this is always satisfied.
14. If "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" holds in some state s, then "orange_block_2 is not clear OR orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2" must hold in state s or later. This means we need to either stack a block on orange_block_2 or stack orange_block_1 on white_block_2.
15. "you are holding red_block_1 AND orange_block_2 is not clear" must hold in at least one state. This means we need to pick up red_block_1 and also have a block on top of orange_block_2.
16. "white_block_2 is clear OR orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2" must hold in at least one state. Since white_block_2 has green_block_1 on top initially, we need to either move green_block_1 from white_block_2 or stack orange_block_1 on white_block_2 (which requires removing green_block_1 first).

Let's now come up with a plan to satisfy all these constraints and achieve the goal.

1. Since yellow_block_1 is the only block on top of a block in the initial state, and according to constraint 12, we need to move red_block_1 from the table before picking up yellow_block_1, let's start by picking up red_block_1.
2. According to constraint 15, we need to have a block on top of orange_block_2 and be holding red_block_1 at the same time. So, we can stack red_block_1 on orange_block_2, fulfilling constraint 10 as well.
3. Now, we can unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1, satisfying constraints 1 and 11.
4. According to constraint 2, after moving yellow_block_1 from white_block_1, we need to ensure white_block_2 is clear or white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1. Let's put yellow_block_1 on the table for now, and focus on this.
5. To make white_block_2 clear, we need to unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2.
6. According to constraint 4, after ensuring "green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1", we need to stack orange_block_1 on white_block_2. Let's stack green_block_1 somewhere else, e.g., on orange_block_1. This will also help satisfy constraint 8.
7. Now, we can stack orange_block_1 on white_block_2, fulfilling constraint 4 and 14.
8. According to constraint 5, we need to stack a block on red_block_1. We can unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_2 and stack it on the table, then pick up another block, e.g., green_block_1, and stack it on red_block_1.
9. According to constraint 8, we need both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 to be not clear at the same time. We've already stacked a block on each of them, so this is satisfied.
10. The goal is to have yellow_block_1 on the table, which we've already achieved.

This plan still needs refinement to satisfy all constraints. Let's revise it.

Alright, let me look at the initial state again and carefully plan out a solution:

Initial state:
- white_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top
- white_block_2 is on the table with green_block_1 on top
- orange_block_1, orange_block_2, red_block_1 are all on the table and clear

First, I need to move red_block_1 from the table (constraint 12) before I can pick up yellow_block_1 (constraint 11).
I also need to have a block on orange_block_2 at the same time as I'm holding red_block_1 (constraint 15).

Let's try a different plan:

1. Pick up orange_block_1 (it's clear and on the table, and we're not holding anything).
2. Stack orange_block_1 on orange_block_2. (Now orange_block_2 is not clear).
3. Pick up red_block_1 (it's clear and on the table, and we're not holding anything).
   - Now we're holding red_block_1 and orange_block_2 is not clear, satisfying constraint 15.
4. Stack red_block_1 on orange_block_1.
   - Now red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1, which is on top of orange_block_2.
   - This also satisfies constraint 5 (a block on top of red_block_1 later) and constraint 10 (red_block_1 on top of orange_block_2).
5. Unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2.
   - Now white_block_2 is clear, satisfying constraint 2 and 16.
6. Stack green_block_1 on red_block_1.
   - Now we have a block on top of red_block_1, satisfying constraint 5 and 7.
7. Pick up orange_block_1 (the one with green_block_1 on top of red_block_1 on top of it).
8. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_2.
   - This satisfies constraint 4 and 14 (orange_block_1 on top of white_block_2).
   - This also partially satisfies constraint 8 (orange_block_1 is not clear, as it has red_block_1 and green_block_1 on top).
9. Unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1.
   - This satisfies constraint 1 (yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1).
   - It also satisfies constraint 11 (holding yellow_block_1).
10. Put down yellow_block_1 on the table.
   - This achieves our goal (yellow_block_1 is on the table).

However, there's a problem with the above plan. In step 7, we can't pick up orange_block_1 because it has blocks on top of it (red_block_1 and green_block_1). Let's correct this.

Alright, let's try one more time:

1. Pick up orange_block_1 (it's clear and on the table, and we're not holding anything).
2. Stack orange_block_1 on orange_block_2. (Now orange_block_2 is not clear).
3. Pick up red_block_1 (it's clear and on the table, and we're not holding anything).
   - Now we're holding red_block_1 and orange_block_2 is not clear, satisfying constraint 15.
4. Stack red_block_1 on orange_block_1.
   - This satisfies constraint 10 (red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2, via orange_block_1).
5. Unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2.
   - Now white_block_2 is clear, satisfying constraint 2 and 16.
6. Stack green_block_1 on red_block_1.
   - Now we have a block on top of red_block_1, satisfying constraint 5 and 7.
   - This also satisfies constraint 8 (green_block_1 and orange_block_1 are both not clear).
7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1.
   - This satisfies constraint 1 (yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1).
   - It also satisfies constraint 11 (holding yellow_block_1).
8. Put down yellow_block_1 on the table.
   - This achieves our goal (yellow_block_1 is on the table).
9. Since constraint 4 requires orange_block_1 to be on top of white_block_2, we need to move orange_block_1. But it has blocks on top, so we need to remove them first.
10. Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_1.
11. Put down green_block_1 on the table.
12. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1.
13. Stack red_block_1 on green_block_1.
14. Unstack orange_block_1 from orange_block_2.
15. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_2.
   - This satisfies constraint 4 and 14 (orange_block_1 on top of white_block_2).

Wait, this still doesn't work properly as we need to fulfill constraint 4 before step 8 due to the temporal constraint.

Let's try again, focusing on the constraints:

1. We need to ensure "white_block_1 is clear OR red_block_1 is not on the table" before picking up yellow_block_1.
2. We need to ensure "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" at some point, and after that, ensure "white_block_2 is clear OR white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1".
3. We need to ensure "orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2" after ensuring "green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1".
4. We need to have "a block on top of red_block_1" at some point.
5. We need to ensure "orange_block_1 is not on the table OR there is a block on top of red_block_1" after ensuring "orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1".
6. We need to have "green_block_1 is not clear AND orange_block_1 is not clear" at some point.
7. We need to ensure "red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2 OR orange_block_2 is not on the table" after ensuring "white_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1".
8. We need to have "you are holding red_block_1 AND orange_block_2 is not clear" at some point.
9. We need to ensure "orange_block_2 is not clear OR orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2" after ensuring "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1".

Let's start from the initial state and attempt to fulfill these constraints in a logical order:

1. The first thing we need to do is move red_block_1 from the table (to satisfy constraint 1).
2. Pick up red_block_1.
3. We also need orange_block_2 to be not clear at the same time (constraint 8).
4. Stack red_block_1 on orange_block_2.
   - Now red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2, satisfying constraint 7 and partially satisfying constraint 8.
5. Unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1.
   - This satisfies constraint 1 (yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1).
   - It also satisfies constraint 11 (holding yellow_block_1).
6. Now, we need to ensure "white_block_2 is clear OR white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" (constraint 2).
7. To make white_block_2 clear, we unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2.
8. Stack yellow_block_1 on the table.
   - This achieves our goal (yellow_block_1 is on the table).
9. According to constraint 3, we need to stack orange_block_1 on white_block_2 after ensuring "green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1".
10. Pick up orange_block_1.
11. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_2.
   - This satisfies constraint 3, 4, and 9.
12. We need to have "a block on top of red_block_1" (constraint 4) and "green_block_1 is not clear AND orange_block_1 is not clear" (constraint 6).
13. Stack green_block_1 on red_block_1.
   - This satisfies constraint 4.
14. Pick up white_block_1.
15. Stack white_block_1 on orange_block_1.
   - This satisfies constraint 6.

Let's clean up everything step by step:

Given the initial state:
- white_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top
- white_block_2 is on the table with green_block_1 on top
- orange_block_1, orange_block_2, red_block_1 are all on the table and clear

Here's our plan:

1. pickup red_block_1
2. stack red_block_1 orange_block_2
3. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1 (on the table)
5. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
6. pickup orange_block_1
7. stack orange_block_1 white_block_2
8. stack green_block_1 red_block_1
9. pickup white_block_1
10. stack white_block_1 orange_block_1

Let me verify if this plan satisfies all the constraints:

1. "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - This is satisfied after step 3.
2. If "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" holds in some state s, then "white_block_2 is clear OR white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" must hold in state s or later.
   - After step 5, white_block_2 is clear.
3. "green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - This is satisfied in the initial state.
4. If "green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1" holds in some state s, then "orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2" must hold in state s or later.
   - This is satisfied after step 7.
5. "there is a block on top of red_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - This is satisfied after step 8.
6. "orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - This is satisfied in the initial state.
7. If "orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1" holds in some state s, then "orange_block_1 is not on the table OR there is a block on top of red_block_1" must hold in state s or later.
   - After step 7, orange_block_1 is not on the table, and after step 8, there is a block on top of red_block_1.
8. "green_block_1 is not clear AND orange_block_1 is not clear" must hold in at least one state.
   - After step 10, both blocks are not clear. (green_block_1 is not clear as it's under white_block_1, and orange_block_1 is not clear as it has white_block_1 on top)
9. "white_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - This is satisfied in the initial state.
10. If "white_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1" holds in some state s, then "red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2 OR orange_block_2 is not on the table" must hold in state s or later.
   - After step 2, red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2.
11. "you are holding yellow_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - This is satisfied after step 3.
12. If "you are holding yellow_block_1" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which "white_block_1 is clear OR red_block_1 is not on the table" is true.
   - After step 2, red_block_1 is not on the table.
13. "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - This is always true since a block cannot be on top of itself.
14. If "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" holds in some state s, then "orange_block_2 is not clear OR orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2" must hold in state s or later.
   - After step 2, orange_block_2 is not clear, and after step 7, orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2.
15. "you are holding red_block_1 AND orange_block_2 is not clear" must hold in at least one state.
   - This is satisfied after step 2. After stacking red_block_1 on orange_block_2, orange_block_2 is not clear. However, at this point, we're no longer holding red_block_1. We need to correct this.
16. "white_block_2 is clear OR orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2" must hold in at least one state.
   - After step 5, white_block_2 is clear, and after step 7, orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2.

I see the issue with constraint 15. Let's correct our plan:

1. pickup orange_block_1
2. stack orange_block_1 orange_block_2
3. pickup red_block_1
   - Now we're holding red_block_1 and orange_block_2 is not clear, satisfying constraint 15.
4. stack red_block_1 white_block_1
   - This makes red_block_1 not on the table, satisfying part of constraint 12.
5. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
   - This satisfies constraint 1 (yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1) and constraint 11 (holding yellow_block_1).
6. putdown yellow_block_1 (on the table)
   - This achieves our goal (yellow_block_1 is on the table).
7. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
   - This satisfies constraint 2 (white_block_2 is clear).
8. pickup orange_block_1
9. stack orange_block_1 white_block_2
   - This satisfies constraint 4, 9, and 14 (orange_block_1 on top of white_block_2).
10. stack green_block_1 red_block_1
   - This satisfies constraint 5 (there is a block on top of red_block_1) and constraint 7 (there is a block on top of red_block_1).
   - It also satisfies constraint 8 (green_block_1 and orange_block_1 are both not clear).

Hmm, are we still not satisfying all constraints? If Unstack green_block_1, it should no longer be on top of white_block_2 for constraint 2. Let's try to get the plan clear:

1. pickup orange_block_1
2. stack orange_block_1 orange_block_2
3. pickup red_block_1
   - Now we're holding red_block_1 and orange_block_2 is not clear, satisfying constraint 15.
4. stack red_block_1 white_block_1
   - This blocks yellow_block_1, but that seems like the only path forward given the constraints.
   - Stacked red_block_1 on white_block_1 to ensure red_block_1 is not on the table for constraint 12.
5. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
   - Now white_block_1 is clear.
6. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1
   - This puts red_block_1 on top of orange_block_1, which is on top of orange_block_2, satisfying constraint 10.
7. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
   - This satisfies constraint 1 (yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1) and constraint 11 (holding yellow_block_1).
8. putdown yellow_block_1 (on the table)
   - This achieves our goal (yellow_block_1 is on the table).
9. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
   - This satisfies constraint 2 (white_block_2 is clear).
10. pickup unstack orange_block_1 orange_block_2
11. stack orange_block_1 white_block_2
   - This satisfies constraint 4, 9, and 14 (orange_block_1 on top of white_block_2).
12. stack green_block_1 red_block_1
   - This satisfies constraint 5 (there is a block on top of red_block_1) and constraint 7 (there is a block on top of red_block_1).
   - It also satisfies constraint 8 (green_block_1 and orange_block_1 are both not clear).

This plan still doesn't fully satisfy constraint 7. Let me review again:

7. If "orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1" holds in some state s, then "orange_block_1 is not on the table OR there is a block on top of red_block_1" must hold in state s or later.

Actually, since orange_block_1 is initially on the table and not on top of red_block_1, this constraint is triggered in the initial state. So, we need to ensure "orange_block_1 is not on the table OR there is a block on top of red_block_1" holds at some point.

Let's review the whole plan again to ensure all constraints are satisfied:

1. pickup orange_block_1
2. stack orange_block_1 orange_block_2
3. pickup red_block_1
   - Now we're holding red_block_1 and orange_block_2 is not clear, satisfying constraint 15.
4. stack red_block_1 white_block_1
   - This blocks yellow_block_1, but that seems like the only path forward given the constraints.
   - Stacked red_block_1 on white_block_1 to ensure red_block_1 is not on the table for constraint 12.
5. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
   - Now white_block_1 is clear.
6. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1
   - This puts red_block_1 on top of orange_block_1, which is on top of orange_block_2, satisfying constraint 10 and 7 (orange_block_1 is not on the table).
7. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
   - This satisfies constraint 1 (yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1) and constraint 11 (holding yellow_block_1).
8. putdown yellow_block_1 (on the table)
   - This achieves our goal (yellow_block_1 is on the table).
9. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
   - This satisfies constraint 2 (white_block_2 is clear).
10. stack green_block_1 red_block_1
   - This satisfies constraint 5 (there is a block on top of red_block_1).
   - It also satisfies constraint 8 (green_block_1 and orange_block_1 are both not clear).
11. unstack orange_block_1 orange_block_2
12. stack orange_block_1 white_block_2
   - This satisfies constraint 4, 9, and 14 (orange_block_1 on top of white_block_2).
   - However, this contradicts constraint 8 as green_block_1 is no longer on top of a block.

This seems problematic. Let me revisit the constraints, especially constraint 8:

8. "green_block_1 is not clear AND orange_block_1 is not clear" must hold in at least one state.

This means that at some point during the plan, both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 should have blocks on top of them. 

Actually, I notice a potential issue with my interpretation of the constraints. Let's read constraint 8 more carefully:

8. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 
    The following conditions are all true: "there is a block on top of green_block_1, i.e., green_block_1 is not clear", "there is a block on top of orange_block_1, i.e., orange_block_1 is not clear""

This means that at some state, green_block_1 should have a block on top of it, making it not clear, and orange_block_1 should also have a block on top of it, making it not clear. It's not saying that green_block_1 is not clear because it's on top of a block, but rather that it has a block on top of it.

Given this clarification, let's revise the plan to ensure that, at some state, both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 have blocks on top of them, making them not clear:

1. pickup orange_block_1
2. stack orange_block_1 orange_block_2
3. pickup red_block_1
   - Now we're holding red_block_1 and orange_block_2 is not clear, satisfying constraint 15.
4. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1
   - This puts red_block_1 on top of orange_block_1, making orange_block_1 not clear.
   - This also satisfies constraint 7 (orange_block_1 is not on the table).
5. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
   - This satisfies constraint 1 (yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1) and constraint 11 (holding yellow_block_1).
6. stack yellow_block_1 green_block_1
   - This makes green_block_1 not clear, and combined with the previous step, at this state, both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 are not clear, satisfying constraint 8.
7. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1
8. putdown yellow_block_1 (on the table)
   - This achieves our goal (yellow_block_1 is on the table).
9. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
   - This satisfies constraint 2 (white_block_2 is clear).
10. stack green_block_1 red_block_1
   - This satisfies constraint 5 (there is a block on top of red_block_1).
11. unstack green_block_1 red_block_1
12. putdown green_block_1 (on the table)
13. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1
14. putdown red_block_1 (on the table)
15. unstack orange_block_1 orange_block_2
16. stack orange_block_1 white_block_2
   - This satisfies constraint 4 (orange_block_1 on top of white_block_2).

Ah, I was confused again. If I look at the constraint 8, I see it is pretty clear:

"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 
    'The following conditions are all true: "there is a block on top of green_block_1, i.e., green_block_1 is not clear", "there is a block on top of orange_block_1, i.e., orange_block_1 is not clear"'

I had correctly interpreted it. At some state, both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 should have blocks on top of them, making them not clear.

Let me review the constraints again, and I'll try to construct a plan step by step:

1. In the initial state, the following constraints are already satisfied: 3, 6, 9, 13.
2. To satisfy constraint 15 ("you are holding red_block_1 AND orange_block_2 is not clear"), we need to ensure orange_block_2 is not clear and then pick up red_block_1. We can achieve this by stacking some block on orange_block_2, and then picking up red_block_1.
3. To satisfy constraint 12 ("If you are holding yellow_block_1, then there must be an earlier state in which white_block_1 is clear OR red_block_1 is not on the table"), we need to ensure white_block_1 is clear or red_block_1 is not on the table before picking up yellow_block_1. Since yellow_block_1 is initially on top of white_block_1, the only way to pick it up is to first make white_block_1 clear or move red_block_1 from the table.
4. This suggests a partial order of operations: we need to move red_block_1 from the table (or clear white_block_1, which is not initially possible) before we can pick up yellow_block_1.

Let's construct a plan step by step, ensuring all constraints are satisfied:

1. pickup orange_block_1
2. stack orange_block_1 orange_block_2
   - Now orange_block_2 is not clear.
3. pickup red_block_1
   - Now we're holding red_block_1 and orange_block_2 is not clear, satisfying constraint 15.
4. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1
   - This puts red_block_1 on top of orange_block_1, making orange_block_1 not clear.
   - This also satisfies constraint 7 (orange_block_1 is not on the table) and constraint 10 (red_block_1, through orange_block_1, makes orange_block_2 not clear).
5. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
   - This satisfies constraint 1 (yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1) and constraint 11 (holding yellow_block_1).
   - It also ensures we're now in a state where constraint 12 applies, since red_block_1 is not on the table.
6. stack yellow_block_1 green_block_1
   - This makes green_block_1 not clear, and combined with the fact that orange_block_1 is still not clear (it has red_block_1 on top), at this state, both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 are not clear, satisfying constraint 8.
7. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
   - This is a bit tricky since green_block_1 is not clear. Let me back up. We can't directly unstack green_block_1 because it has yellow_block_1 on top. We need to unstack yellow_block_1 first.
   - Oh, but we can't do that because only clear blocks can be picked up, and green_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on top.

I need to rethink this plan. The challenge is getting both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 to be not clear at the same time, while still making white_block_2 clear or stacking orange_block_1 on white_block_2 after ensuring green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1.

Let's try a different approach. In the initial state, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_2. For constraint 2, we need to ensure white_block_2 is clear or white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1 after ensuring yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1. To make white_block_2 clear, we need to unstack green_block_1, which means we need to ensure green_block_1 is clear. For constraint 8, we need to ensure at some state, both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 have blocks on top of them.

Let's try a slightly different approach:

1. pickup red_block_1
2. stack red_block_1 green_block_1
   - This makes green_block_1 not clear.
3. pickup orange_block_1
4. stack orange_block_1 orange_block_2
   - Now orange_block_2 is not clear.
5. pickup white_block_1
   - This ensures white_block_1 is clear.
6. stack white_block_1 orange_block_1
   - This makes orange_block_1 not clear, and combined with the fact that green_block_1 is still not clear (it has red_block_1 on top), at this state, both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 are not clear, satisfying constraint 8.
   - But wait, to unstack white_block_1, we need to first unstack yellow_block_1, and we can only do that if white_block_1 is clear or red_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 12).

It seems there's a circular dependency. We'll need to revise our approach to ensure a coherent order of operations.

Actually, let me back up and more systematically work through the constraints. Perhaps it's easier to follow a recipe, or template, to deal with these, to try to reduce the chance of entangling myself:

1. pickup orange_block_1
2. stack orange_block_1 orange_block_2 (this makes orange_block_2 not clear)
3. pickup red_block_1
   - Now red_block_1 is not on the table, which helps with constraint 12, and we are holding red_block_1 with orange_block_2 not clear, satisfying constraint 15.
4. stack red_block_1 white_block_1
   - This makes white_block_1 not clear, which is not ideal, but it ensures red_block_1 is not on the table, which will help with constraint 12.
5. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
   - This removes the block from white_block_1, making it clear again, while still ensuring red_block_1 is not on the table (since we're holding it).
6. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1
   - This makes orange_block_1 not clear.
7. pickup white_block_1
8. stack white_block_1 green_block_1
   - This makes green_block_1 not clear, and combined with the fact that orange_block_1 is still not clear (it has red_block_1 on top), at this state, both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 are not clear, satisfying constraint 8.
9. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
   - Hmm, I've got confused again. I'm now trying to pick up white_block_1, but it's on the table, not stacked on another block.

Let me clear my head and start from the initial state:

Initial state:
- white_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top
- white_block_2 is on the table with green_block_1 on top
- orange_block_1, orange_block_2, red_block_1 are all on the table and clear

To satisfy constraint 12, I need red_block_1 to be not on the table before I pick up yellow_block_1. To satisfy constraint 15, I need to hold red_block_1 when orange_block_2 is not clear.

Here's a plan:

1. pickup orange_block_1
2. stack orange_block_1 orange_block_2 (this makes orange_block_2 not clear)
3. pickup red_block_1
   - Now red_block_1 is not on the table, which helps with constraint 12, and we are holding red_block_1 with orange_block_2 not clear, satisfying constraint 15.
4. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1 (this makes orange_block_1 not clear)
5. pickup white_block_1's-another-block
6. stack white_block_1's-another-block green_block_1 (this makes green_block_1 not clear)
   - At this state, both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 are not clear, satisfying constraint 8.

Hmm, but there's no "white_block_1's-another-block". I'm confused again. Let's reorganize.

In the initial state:
- white_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top
- white_block_2 is on the table with green_block_1 on top
- orange_block_1, orange_block_2, red_block_1 are all on the table and clear

Constraint 8 requires that at some state, both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 have blocks on top of them. 

I realize we can only pickup blocks that are clear, and we can only unstack blocks that are on top of a tower. Let's just think step by step and forget about trying to come up with the whole plan immediately.

1. pick up red_block_1
2. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1
3. pick up orange_block_2
4. stack orange_block_2 green_block_1
5. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
6. putdown yellow_block_1

At this point, the state is:
- white_block_1 is on the table and clear
- white_block_2 is on the table with green_block_1 on top, and orange_block_2 on top of green_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on the table and clear
- orange_block_1 is on the table with red_block_1 on top (making it not clear)
- green_block_1 is on top of white_block_2 with orange_block_2 on top (making it not clear)
- red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- orange_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
- we're not holding any block

Let's check if all constraints are satisfied:

1. "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - This is satisfied after step 5.
2. If "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" holds in some state s, then "white_block_2 is clear OR white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" must hold in state s or later.
   - After step 5, white_block_2 is not clear (it has green_block_1 on top), and white_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1. So, this constraint is not satisfied.

Let's re-analyze this constraint:
"If expression "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" holds in some state s, then expression "At least one of the following conditions is true: "there is no block on top of white_block_2, i.e., white_block_2 is clear", "white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" must hold at s or at some state after s"

After we remove yellow_block_1 from white_block_1, we need to ensure that either white_block_2 is clear or white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1. In the initial state, white_block_2 is not clear (since green_block_1 is on top of it), and white_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1. 

To satisfy this constraint, we need to rearrange the blocks to make white_block_2 clear (by removing green_block_1 from the top) or to put white_block_2 on top of green_block_1.

Let's revise our plan:

1. pick up red_block_1
2. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1
3. pick up orange_block_2
4. stack orange_block_2 green_block_1
   - At this point, both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 are not clear, satisfying constraint 8.
5. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
   - This satisfies constraint 1 (yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1) and constraint 11 (holding yellow_block_1).
6. putdown yellow_block_1
   - This achieves our goal (yellow_block_1 is on the table).
7. unstack orange_block_2 green_block_1
8. putdown orange_block_2
9. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
   - Now white_block_2 is clear, satisfying constraint 2.
10. stack green_block_1 white_block_1
11. pickup orange_block_1
   - Wait, I can't pick up orange_block_1 because it has red_block_1 on top. I need to unstack red_block_1 first.
12. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1
13. putdown red_block_1
14. pickup orange_block_1
15. stack orange_block_1 white_block_2
   - This satisfies constraint 4 and 14 (orange_block_1 on top of white_block_2).

Let's check if this plan satisfies all the constraints:

1. "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - This is satisfied after step 5.
2. If "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" holds in some state s, then "white_block_2 is clear OR white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" must hold in state s or later.
   - After step 9, white_block_2 is clear, satisfying this constraint.
3. "green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - This is satisfied in the initial state.
4. If "green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1" holds in some state s, then "orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2" must hold in state s or later.
   - After step 15, orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2, satisfying this constraint.
5. "there is a block on top of red_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - This is not satisfied in the current plan. We need to stack a block on red_block_1.
   - This means we'd need to add a step to stack a block on red_block_1. But this would complicate the plan and potentially violate other constraints.

Actually, let me redo this from the start. I am feeling like my partial plan might be incorrect. Let's attempt a cleaner plan step-by-step:

1. I need to make "red_block_1 not on the table" or "white_block_1 is clear" before picking up yellow_block_1 (constraint 12). Since white_block_1 is not clear in the initial state, I'll move red_block_1 from the table.
    - pickup red_block_1

2. I also need to hold red_block_1 and have orange_block_2 not clear at the same time (constraint 15). So, I need to make orange_block_2 not clear, and I can do this by stacking a block on it. Since I'm holding red_block_1, I could stack it on orange_block_2, but that would not satisfy constraint 5 (a block on top of red_block_1). I can also stack another block on orange_block_2, and then stack red_block_1 on that block, ensuring both red_block_1 is not on the table and orange_block_2 is not clear.
    - stack red_block_1 orange_block_2
    - pickup orange_block_1
    - stack orange_block_1 red_block_1
      (This makes red_block_1 not on the table, and it also makes orange_block_2 not clear, and it ensures there's a block on top of red_block_1, satisfying constraint 5.)
      But I realize I have to first pickup red_block_1, and then stack it. So I can't simply pickup orange_block_1. 
3. I need a different approach for holding red_block_1 and having orange_block_2 not clear simultaneously.
    - pickup orange_block_1
    - stack orange_block_1 orange_block_2
    (This makes orange_block_2 not clear)
    - pickup red_block_1
    (Now I'm holding red_block_1 and orange_block_2 is not clear, satisfying constraint 15)

4. Now, we need to satisfy constraint 8 (having both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 not clear at the same time). orange_block_1 is already not clear because it's on top of orange_block_2. To make green_block_1 not clear, I'd need to stack a block on it. 
   - stack red_block_1 green_block_1
   (Now both green_block_1 and orange_block_1 are not clear, satisfying constraint 8)

5. To satisfy constraint 1 and 11, I need to unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1.
    - unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
    (This satisfies constraint 1: yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, and constraint 11: holding yellow_block_1)

6. To achieve the goal, I need to put yellow_block_1 on the table.
    - putdown yellow_block_1
    (This achieves our goal: yellow_block_1 is on the table)

7. Now, for constraint 2, after yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, I need to ensure white_block_2 is clear or white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1.
    - unstack red_block_1 green_block_1
    - putdown red_block_1
    - unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
    (This makes white_block_2 clear, satisfying constraint 2)

8. For constraint 4, after green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1, I need to ensure orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2.
    - unstack orange_block_1 orange_block_2
    - stack orange_block_1 white_block_2
    (This satisfies constraint 4 and 14: orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2)

9. For constraint 5, we need to have a block on top of red_block_1 at some point.
    - pickup green_block_1
    - stack green_block_1 red_block_1
    (This satisfies constraint 5: there is a block on top of red_block_1, and also ensures red_block_1 is not on the table, which helps with constraint 7)

10. For constraint 7, after orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1, we need to ensure orange_block_1 is not on the table or there is a block on top of red_block_1. Orange_block_1 is already not on the table (it's on white_block_2), and there's also a block on top of red_block_1, so this constraint is satisfied.

So, our final plan is:

1. pickup orange_block_1
2. stack orange_block_1 orange_block_2
3. pickup red_block_1
4. stack red_block_1 green_block_1
5. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
6. putdown yellow_block_1
7. unstack red_block_1 green_block_1
8. putdown red_block_1
9. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
10. unstack orange_block_1 orange_block_2
11. stack orange_block_1 white_block_2
12. pickup green_block_1
13. stack green_block_1 red_block_1

Let me check if this plan satisfies all the constraints:

1. "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - This is satisfied after step 5.
2. If "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" holds in some state s, then "white_block_2 is clear OR white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" must hold in state s or later.
   - After step 9, white_block_2 is clear, satisfying this constraint.
3. "green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - This is satisfied in the initial state.
4. If "green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1" holds in some state s, then "orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2" must hold in state s or later.
   - After step 11, orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2, satisfying this constraint.
5. "there is a block on top of red_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - This is satisfied after step 13.
6. "orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - This is satisfied in the initial state.
7. If "orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1" holds in some state s, then "orange_block_1 is not on the table OR there is a block on top of red_block_1" must hold in state s or later.
   - After step 2, orange_block_1 is not on the table, and after step 13, there is a block on top of red_block_1, satisfying this constraint.
8. "green_block_1 is not clear AND orange_block_1 is not clear" must hold in at least one state.
   - After step 4, green_block_1 is not clear (it has red_block_1 on top), and orange_block_1 is not clear (it's under orange_block_2), satisfying this constraint.
9. "white_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - This is satisfied in the initial state.
10. If "white_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1" holds in some state s, then "red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2 OR orange_block_2 is not on the table" must hold in state s or later.
   - After step 2, orange_block_2 is not on the table (it has orange_block_1 on top), satisfying this constraint.
11. "you are holding yellow_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - This is satisfied after step 5.
12. If "you are holding yellow_block_1" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which "white_block_1 is clear OR red_block_1 is not on the table" is true.
   - After step 3, red_block_1 is not on the table, satisfying this constraint.
13. "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - This is always true, since a block cannot be on top of itself.
14. If "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" holds in some state s, then "orange_block_2 is not clear OR orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2" must hold in state s or later.
   - After step 2, orange_block_2 is not clear, and after step 11, orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2, satisfying this constraint.
15. "you are holding red_block_1 AND orange_block_2 is not clear" must hold in at least one state.
   - After step 3, we're holding red_block_1 and orange_block_2 is not clear, satisfying this constraint.
16. "white_block_2 is clear OR orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2" must hold in at least one state.
   - After step 9, white_block_2 is clear, and after step 11, orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2, satisfying this constraint.

It looks like our plan satisfies all the constraints. Let's finalize it:

1. pickup orange_block_1
2. stack orange_block_1 orange_block_2
3. pickup red_block_1
4. stack red_block_1 green_block_1
5. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
6. putdown yellow_block_1
7. unstack red_block_1 green_block_1
8. putdown red_block_1
9. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
10. unstack orange_block_1 orange_block_2
11. stack orange_block_1 white_block_2
12. pickup green_block_1
13. stack green_block_1 red_block_1

I think that's the optimal plan: we moved the blocks in the most efficient way to satisfy all constraints and achieve the goal. Let me double check one more time to make sure it's correct.

Actually, I don't think I've been careful enough in the step-by-step execution, so let's carefully work through this once more:

Initial state:
- white_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top

10. putdown green_block_1

Current state:
- white_block_1 is on the table and clear
- white_block_2 is on the table and clear
- yellow_block_1 is on the table and clear
- orange_block_2 is on the table with orange_block_1 on top

- orange_block_2 is on the table and clear
- orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2 and clear
- red_block_1 is on the table and clear
- green_block_1 is on the table and clear

13. pickup green_block_1

- white_block_2 is on the table with orange_block_1 on top
- yellow_block_1 is on the table and clear
- orange_block_2 is on the table and clear
- orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2 and clear
- red_block_1 is on the table with green_block_1 on top (constraint 5 is satisfied)
- green_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 and clear

Let me check if all the constraints are satisfied in this final plan:

1. "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - This is satisfied after step 5.
2. If "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" holds in some state s, then "white_block_2 is clear OR white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" must hold in state s or later.
   - After step 9, white_block_2 is clear, satisfying this constraint.
3. "green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - This is satisfied in the initial state.
4. If "green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1" holds in some state s, then "orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2" must hold in state s or later.
   - After step 12, orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2, satisfying this constraint.
5. "there is a block on top of red_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - This is satisfied after step 14.
6. "orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - This is satisfied in the initial state.
7. If "orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1" holds in some state s, then "orange_block_1 is not on the table OR there is a block on top of red_block_1" must hold in state s or later.
   - After step 2, orange_block_1 is not on the table, and after step 14, there is a block on top of red_block_1, satisfying this constraint.
8. "green_block_1 is not clear AND orange_block_1 is not clear" must hold in at least one state.
   - After step 4, green_block_1 is not clear (it has red_block_1 on top), and orange_block_1 is not clear (it's under orange_block_2), satisfying this constraint.
9. "white_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - This is satisfied in the initial state.
10. If "white_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1" holds in some state s, then "red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2 OR orange_block_2 is not on the table" must hold in state s or later.
   - After step 2, orange_block_2 is not on the table (it has orange_block_1 on top), satisfying this constraint.
11. "you are holding yellow_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - This is satisfied after step 5.
12. If "you are holding yellow_block_1" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which "white_block_1 is clear OR red_block_1 is not on the table" is true.
   - After step 3, red_block_1 is not on the table, satisfying this constraint.
13. "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - This is always true, since a block cannot be on top of itself.
14. If "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" holds in some state s, then "orange_block_2 is not clear OR orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2" must hold in state s or later.
   - After step 2, orange_block_2 is not clear, and after step 12, orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2, satisfying this constraint.
15. "you are holding red_block_1 AND orange_block_2 is not clear" must hold in at least one state.
   - After step 3, we're holding red_block_1 and orange_block_2 is not clear, satisfying this constraint.
16. "white_block_2 is clear OR orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2" must hold in at least one state.
   - After step 9, white_block_2 is clear, and after step 12, orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2, satisfying this constraint.

All the constraints are satisfied, and our goal is achieved (yellow_block_1 is on the table). The revised plan is:

1. pickup orange_block_1
2. stack orange_block_1 orange_block_2
3. pickup red_block_1
4. stack red_block_1 green_block_1
5. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
6. putdown yellow_block_1
7. unstack red_block_1 green_block_1
8. putdown red_block_1
9. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
10. putdown green_block_1
11. unstack orange_block_1 orange_block_2
12. stack orange_block_1 white_block_2
13. pickup green_block_1
14. stack green_block_1 red_block_1

I think this is the optimal plan that satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal. Let's return it.

Actually, I think step 10 was unnecessary. I can combine steps 9-10 of the current plan into a single step, and then the rest of the steps would be renumbered:

1. pickup orange_block_1
2. stack orange_block_1 orange_block_2
3. pickup red_block_1
4. stack red_block_1 green_block_1
5. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
6. putdown yellow_block_1
7. unstack red_block_1 green_block_1
8. putdown red_block_1
9. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
10. unstack orange_block_1 orange_block_2
11. stack orange_block_1 white_block_2
12. pickup green_block_1
13. stack green_block_1 red_block_1

Oh wait, I can't just skip the putdown step. I was getting confused. After unstacking green_block_1 in step 9, we're holding it, and we can't pick up another block (orange_block_1) as per constraint "you may only perform this action on a block b if you are currently not holding any block". We need to put down green_block_1 first, as in the original plan. So, the original plan is correct:

1. pickup orange_block_1
2. stack orange_block_1 orange_block_2
3. pickup red_block_1
4. stack red_block_1 green_block_1
5. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
6. putdown yellow_block_1
7. unstack red_block_1 green_block_1
8. putdown red_block_1
9. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
10. putdown green_block_1
11. unstack orange_block_1 orange_block_2
12. stack orange_block_1 white_block_2
13. pickup green_block_1
14. stack green_block_1 red_block_1

This is the optimal plan to achieve the goal while satisfying all constraints. Let's go with this for our answer.
