Let's analyze the problem:

We have 7 blocks: white_block_1, white_block_2, yellow_block_1, orange_block_1, green_block_1, orange_block_2, and red_block_1.

The initial state is:
- white_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_2 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on top of white_block_2
- orange_block_2 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1, orange_block_1, green_block_1, orange_block_2, and red_block_1 are clear
- We are not holding any block

The goal is:
- yellow_block_1 is on the table

Currently, yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, and we want it to be on the table. 

To accomplish this, I need to:
1. Pick up yellow_block_1 from white_block_1 using the "unstack" action.
2. Place yellow_block_1 on the table using the "putdown" action.

Let's verify the preconditions for each action:

For "unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1":
- yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 (satisfied)
- yellow_block_1 is clear (satisfied)
- We are not holding any block (satisfied)

After performing this action, the effects would be:
- yellow_block_1 is no longer on top of white_block_1
- white_block_1 is clear
- We are holding yellow_block_1

For "putdown yellow_block_1":
- We are holding yellow_block_1 (satisfied after the previous action)

After performing this action, the effects would be:
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- We are not holding any block

So, the plan would be:
1. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1

This plan satisfies the goal of having yellow_block_1 on the table, and it adheres to the constraints specified.

Let me double-check the preconditions and effects for each action:

For "unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1":
Preconditions:
- yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 (satisfied)
- yellow_block_1 is clear (satisfied)
- We are not holding any block (satisfied)

Effects:
- yellow_block_1 is no longer on top of white_block_1
- white_block_1 is clear
- We are holding yellow_block_1

For "putdown yellow_block_1":
Preconditions:
- We are holding yellow_block_1 (satisfied after the previous action)

Effects:
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- We are not holding any block

Yes, the preconditions and effects align properly, and the plan is valid.

Let me check if there's a shorter plan possible. Since our goal is to have yellow_block_1 on the table, and it's currently on top of white_block_1, we need to remove it from there and place it on the table. This requires the two actions I've outlined.

So, the optimal plan is:
1. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1
