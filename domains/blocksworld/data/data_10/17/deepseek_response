**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Move red_block_1 to orange_block_2** to satisfy the constraint that red_block_1 must have a block on it (by stacking) and handle conditional constraints.
   - `pickup red_block_1`
   - `stack red_block_1 orange_block_2`

2. **Move yellow_block_1 to the table** (goal achievement).
   - `unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1`
   - `putdown yellow_block_1`

3. **Stack orange_block_1 on green_block_1** and **stack white_block_1 on orange_block_1** to satisfy the "both green and orange1 have blocks" constraint.
   - `pickup orange_block_1`
   - `stack orange_block_1 green_block_1`
   - `pickup white_block_1`
   - `stack white_block_1 orange_block_1`

4. **Re-stack red_block_1 on orange_block_2** to temporarily meet holding requirements (though this step might need adjustment for full constraint compliance).
   - `unstack red_block_1 orange_block_2`
   - `stack red_block_1 orange_block_2`

This plan addresses the main goal and key constraints but may require additional steps for full compliance.
