Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld problem. The goal is to get yellow_block_1 on the table. But there are a bunch of constraints we have to satisfy along the way. Let's start by understanding the initial state and the goal.

In the initial state, yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1. So to move it to the table, I need to unstack it. The unstack action requires that yellow_block_1 is clear (which it is) and that the robotic arm isn't holding anything. So first step might be unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1, then put it down. But wait, the problem isn't just the goal; there are all these constraints.

Looking at the constraints:

1. The first constraint says that at some point, yellow_block_1 is not on white_block_1. Well, since the goal requires moving it to the table, that's naturally achieved. So that's covered once we unstack it.

But then there's a conditional constraint: if in some state yellow_block_1 is not on white_block_1, then either white_block_2 is clear or white_block_2 is on green_block_1. Wait, in the initial state, green_block_1 is on white_block_2. So white_block_2 is not clear. So after moving yellow_block_1, we need to ensure that either white_block_2 becomes clear (which would require moving green_block_1 off) or put white_block_2 on green_block_1, but that's impossible since white_block_2 is a block and can't be placed under green_block_1 if it's already under. Wait, the initial state has green_block_1 on white_block_2. So white_block_2 is under green_block_1. So to satisfy that conditional, after moving yellow_block_1, we need to either make white_block_2 clear (by moving green_block_1) or put white_block_2 on top of green_block_1. But white_block_2 is on the table with green_block_1 on top. So putting white_block_2 on green_block_1 would require stacking, but that's not possible unless green_block_1 is clear. But green_block_1 is clear initially. Wait, green_block_1 is on white_block_2 and is clear. So if we unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2, then white_block_2 becomes clear. But maybe that's a way to satisfy the condition. But this is a conditional: if yellow is not on white1, then in that state or later, either white2 is clear or white2 is on green1. Since in the state after unstacking yellow, white2 is still under green1 (so not clear). So perhaps we need to make white2 clear later.

But maybe the plan would involve moving green_block_1. Let's think about that.

Another constraint: green_block_1 is not on yellow_block_1 in at least one state. But in the initial state, green is on white2. So as long as we don't put green on yellow, this is automatically true. Wait, no. The constraint is that green_block_1 is not on yellow_block_1 must hold in at least one state. Since initially, green is not on yellow, maybe this is already satisfied. But perhaps the problem requires that it's true in some state during the plan, which would already be the case unless we move green on top of yellow. But we don't need to do that. So maybe this constraint is automatically satisfied. Wait, but the initial state may not count as part of the plan's states. Wait, the initial state is the starting point, and the plan is a sequence of actions. So the initial state is considered state s0, then each action leads to s1, s2, etc. So the initial state counts. So if the initial state already satisfies that green is not on yellow, then that's covered. But the problem says "must hold in at least one state". So perhaps that's already satisfied, but the problem may require it to be true at some state in the plan, which includes the initial state. So maybe that's already okay. But maybe not. Need to check if the problem counts the initial state. The user's instruction says "bring about the goal", but the constraints are on the states during the plan. So perhaps the initial state is considered. But the problem says "the following expression must hold in at least one state", which could include the initial. So for example, the first constraint: "yellow is not on white1" must be true in at least one state. But initially, yellow is on white1, so we need to make sure that after some action, it's not. Which we do by unstacking. So the first constraint is handled once we unstack. But the conditional that follows: after that state, we need to have either white2 clear or white2 on green1. So after unstacking yellow, we need to ensure that in that state or later, white2 is clear or white2 is on green1. Currently, after unstacking yellow, white2 is still under green1. So white2 is not clear. So perhaps we need to make white2 clear later. That would involve moving green_block_1 off of white2. For example, picking up green and putting it somewhere else. But the goal is only about yellow. So maybe the plan has to include moving green_block_1 to satisfy this constraint.

Another constraint: there must be a state where red_block_1 is not clear. So someone has to put a block on top of red_block_1. Similarly, the constraint that orange_block_1 is not on red_block_1 must hold in some state. Well, initially, orange1 is on the table, not on red. So that's already true. Wait, the constraint says "orange_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1" must hold in at least one state. Since in the initial state, orange1 is on the table and red is also on the table, so orange1 is not on red. So this is already satisfied. But maybe the problem requires that during the plan, this is true. So perhaps that's okay. But the conditional says if orange1 is not on red in some state s, then in s or later, either orange1 is not on the table or red has a block on top. So since initially, orange1 is not on red, then in the initial state, we must ensure that either orange1 is not on the table (but it is) or red has a block on top (which it doesn't). So this conditional is triggered at the initial state. Therefore, we need to ensure that in the initial state or some state after, either orange1 is moved from the table or red has a block on top. Since the initial state doesn't satisfy the consequent, we must do something in the plan to satisfy it. So perhaps we need to put a block on red or move orange1 off the table.

Another constraint: There's a state where both green_block_1 is not clear (has a block on top) and orange_block_1 is not clear. So we need to stack something on green and something on orange1.

Another constraint: white_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1 in some state. Since initially, white1 is on the table, so it's not on orange1. So that's already true. But again, if the initial state counts, then this is satisfied. But the conditional says if white1 is not on orange1 in state s, then in s or later, red1 is on orange2 or orange2 is not on the table. Initially, orange2 is on the table. So in the initial state, since white1 is not on orange1, we need to have either red1 on orange2 or orange2 not on the table at some point. So perhaps we need to move orange2 off the table or put red1 on it.

Another constraint: you must be holding yellow_block_1 in some state. That will naturally happen when we unstack it. But then the conditional says that before that, either white1 is clear (which it is after unstacking yellow, but we need a state before holding yellow where white1 is clear or red1 is not on the table. Wait, in the initial state, white1 has yellow on top. So white1 is not clear. So when we unstack yellow from white1, the preconditions require that yellow is clear (which it is) and the arm is empty. So to unstack, white1 must have yellow on top and yellow is clear. So after unstacking, white1 becomes clear. But the condition is that when we are holding yellow, there must have been an earlier state where white1 is clear or red1 is not on the table. But the only time we hold yellow is after unstacking. Before that, in the initial state, white1 is not clear. So the earlier state would have to be before we unstack. So how can we satisfy that? Because to unstack yellow, we have to do it when yellow is clear. So the only way to get an earlier state where white1 is clear is impossible before unstacking. Alternatively, red1 is not on the table. But initially, red1 is on the table. So perhaps before holding yellow, we need to move red1 off the table, but that's another action. Wait, but the plan's goal is to put yellow on the table. So maybe after unstacking yellow, we put it down, but we need to also move red1. But this complicates things.

Let's start sketching a plan. The main goal is to get yellow on the table. So steps could be:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1. This makes the arm hold yellow, and white_block_1 becomes clear.

Then putdown yellow. That achieves the goal. But this is two steps. But we have to satisfy all constraints.

But let's check the constraints that require other actions.

First, the constraint that red_block_1 must have a block on top at some state. So we need to stack something on red. Let's pick a block that's not needed elsewhere. For example, orange_block_2 is on the table. Maybe stack orange2 on red1. But how? To stack, we need to pick up orange2, then stack on red1. But red1 must be clear. Initially, it is. So perhaps:

pickup orange_block_2
stack orange_block_2 red_block_1

This would satisfy the constraint that red has a block on top.

But when to do this? Maybe after moving yellow. Because moving yellow is part of the goal.

But let's think. If we first do the steps to get yellow on the table, then handle other constraints. But some constraints require actions to be done during the plan.

Another constraint is that there's a state where you are holding red_block_1 and orange_block_2 is not clear (has a block on top). Wait, the constraint says "you are holding red_block_1" and "orange_block_2 is not clear". So to have orange_block_2 not clear, we need to stack something on it. So perhaps stack another block on orange2. But we need to hold red and have orange2 have a block on top. So maybe:

Pick up some block, say orange_block_2. Stack it on another block, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, stack another block on orange2. For example, stack white_block_2 on orange2. But white_block_2 is under green_block_1. So first, unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2, put it down, then pickup white_block_2 and stack on orange2. Then, later, pickup red_block_1. But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps during the plan, after stacking something on red1 (like orange2), then we can pickup red1, but that's not possible unless red1 is clear. Hmm. Alternatively, after putting orange2 on red1, then we can unstack it, but that's more steps.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to list all the constraints and see which ones require actions beyond just moving yellow.

Constraints needing actions:

1. There must be a state where red_block_1 is not clear. So stack something on red1.

2. There must be a state where green_block_1 is not clear and orange_block_1 is not clear. So stack something on green and something on orange1.

3. The state where you are holding red_block_1 and orange_block_2 is not clear. So during the plan, we need to hold red1 and have something on orange2.

4. The constraint that when orange1 is not on red1 (which is always true except if we stack orange1 on red1, which we probably shouldn't do), then in that state or later, either orange1 is not on the table or red1 has a block. Since initially orange1 is on the table and red1 is clear, we need to either move orange1 off the table or stack on red1. Stacking on red1 is needed for another constraint, so this can be satisfied by stacking on red1.

5. The constraint that when white1 is not on orange1 (which is always true), we need to have red1 on orange2 or orange2 not on the table. So we can either put red1 on orange2 or move orange2. But stacking red1 on orange2 would require that orange2 is clear, which it is. So maybe stack red1 on orange2.

But red1 is on the table initially. So steps could be: pickup red1, stack on orange2. But that would make orange2 not clear, satisfying one part of the constraint. Alternatively, move orange2 somewhere else. But moving orange2 would require picking it up, which is possible.

6. The constraint that when green_block_1 is not on itself (always true), then either orange2 is not clear or orange1 is on white2. So we can stack something on orange2 or stack orange1 on white2.

Also, the constraint that after moving yellow_block_1 off white1, we need to have white2 clear or white2 on green1. Since white2 is under green1, after moving green1, white2 becomes clear. So maybe we need to move green1.

Putting all this together, the plan might involve:

- Unstack yellow and put it down (achieving the goal)
- Stack something on red1 (e.g., orange2)
- Stack something on green1 (e.g., orange1)
- Stack something on orange1 (maybe white1)
- Move orange2 (either stack on red1 or somewhere else)
- Ensure that when holding red1, orange2 is not clear (maybe stack something on orange2 before picking up red1)

But this is a lot. Let's try to outline steps:

1. Unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1. Now holding yellow. Then putdown yellow. This achieves the goal. But we need to handle other constraints.

2. Now, to satisfy red1 not clear: stack orange2 on red1. So:

pickup orange_block_2
stack orange_block_2 red_block_1

3. To make green_block_1 not clear and orange_block_1 not clear, we need to stack blocks on them. Let's stack something on green1. Since green1 is on white_block_2, we can pick up another block and stack on green1. For example, pickup orange_block_1 and stack on green_block_1. Then, stack another block on orange_block_1. But we need two blocks to stack on green and orange1.

Alternatively, after stacking on green1, then stack on orange1. Let's see:

After step 2, orange2 is on red1. Now, to stack on green1, which is on white2. Pickup orange_block_1 (which is on the table and clear). Then stack on green1. Then, pickup white_block_1 (now clear after unstacking yellow) and stack on orange_block_1.

But white_block_1 is clear after step 1. So:

4. pickup orange_block_1
5. stack orange_block_1 green_block_1 (now green1 is not clear)
6. pickup white_block_1
7. stack white_block_1 orange_block_1 (now orange1 is not clear)

This satisfies the constraint that both green1 and orange1 have blocks on top.

Also, the constraint that white1 is not on orange1 would be true until we stack white1 on orange1. Wait, after step7, white1 is on orange1. So before that, white1 was on the table, so not on orange1. So the constraint "white1 is not on orange1" holds in the initial state and until step7. Then in step7, white1 is on orange1. But the constraint requires that in at least one state, white1 is not on orange1. Which is true in the initial state. However, the conditional associated with it says that whenever white1 is not on orange1 in a state s, then in s or later, red1 is on orange2 or orange2 is not on the table. So in the initial state, white1 is not on orange1, so we need to ensure that either red1 is on orange2 (which we can do by stacking red1 on orange2) or orange2 is not on the table (which we did in step2 by stacking orange2 on red1. Wait, in step2, orange2 is on red1, so orange2 is no longer on the table. So in that case, the condition is satisfied because orange2 is not on the table. So that's handled by step2. So when we have white1 not on orange1 in the initial state, the consequent is satisfied when orange2 is moved off the table in step2. So that's okay.

Another constraint: when you are holding yellow_block_1 (which happens in step1), there must be an earlier state where white1 is clear or red1 is not on the table. But before step1, in the initial state, white1 is not clear (has yellow on top), and red1 is on the table. So to satisfy this, we need an earlier state (before step1) where either white1 is clear (which it isn't) or red1 is not on the table. But how can we do that? Because the first action is unstacking yellow, which requires that yellow is clear (which it is). So before unstacking yellow, red1 is on the table. So unless we move red1 before unstacking yellow, the condition isn't met. But the problem says that when you are holding yellow, there must have been an earlier state (before that) where white1 is clear or red1 is not on the table. But how to do that? Because the first action is unstacking yellow, which requires the arm is empty. So perhaps before unstacking yellow, we need to move red1. For example, pickup red1 and put it down. Wait, but that doesn't change its position. Or stack it on another block. But if we stack red1 on orange2, then red1 is not on the table. Let's see:

Suppose we do:

0. pickup red_block_1
1. stack red_block_1 orange_block_2
Then, unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
putdown yellow

But this adds steps. But this way, before holding yellow (step2), in step0 and 1, red1 is moved to orange2, so it's not on the table. Thus, when we hold yellow in step2, the earlier state (step1) has red1 not on the table. This satisfies the conditional.

But this complicates the plan. However, the user requires the shortest possible plan. So adding steps for this might be necessary, but let's see if there's another way.

Alternatively, after unstacking yellow, when we are holding yellow, the earlier state (before unstacking) has red1 on the table. So unless we move red1 before unstacking, the condition isn't met. So we have to move red1 before unstacking yellow. But how? Because to move red1, we need to pick it up. But the arm is empty in the initial state, and red1 is clear. So possible steps:

0. pickup red_block_1
1. putdown red_block_1

But this doesn't change anything. Or stack it on another block:

0. pickup red_block_1
1. stack red_block_1 orange_block_2

This makes red1 not on the table, satisfying the condition. Then proceed to unstack yellow.

So the plan would be:

pickup red_block_1
stack red_block_1 orange_block_2
unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
putdown yellow_block_1

Then proceed to handle other constraints.

But this adds steps. However, this is necessary to satisfy the conditional that when holding yellow, there must have been a prior state where red1 was not on the table.

This seems unavoidable. So including these steps.

Then, after that, we need to stack on red1 (to satisfy red1 not clear). But after step1, red1 is stacked on orange2. So red1 is not clear. Wait, but the constraint requires that in some state, red1 is not clear. So if we stack red1 on orange2, then red1 is on top of orange2, which makes orange2 not clear. But red1 is clear. Wait, no: when you stack red1 on orange2, red1 is on orange2, so orange2 is not clear. Red1 is on top, so red1 is clear. So the state where red1 is not clear would require something on top of red1. So perhaps stacking orange2 on red1. Let's adjust:

Instead of stacking red1 on orange2, stack orange2 on red1.

But orange2 is on the table initially. So:

pickup orange_block_2
stack orange_block_2 red_block_1

Then, red_block_1 has orange2 on top, so red1 is not clear. This satisfies that constraint. But then, when we do this, red1 is not clear. But also, orange2 is on red1, so orange2 is not on the table. So in the conditional for white1 not on orange1, we need to have orange2 not on the table. Which is achieved by this step. So after stacking orange2 on red1, orange2 is not on the table. So that satisfies the conditional linked to white1 not being on orange1.

So let's try this approach:

0. pickup orange_block_2
1. stack orange_block_2 red_block_1
2. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
3. putdown yellow_block_1

This gives us:

- yellow is on the table (goal achieved)
- red1 has orange2 on top (so red1 is not clear)
- orange2 is not on the table (satisfies the conditional for white1)
- when holding yellow (step2), the prior state (step1) has orange2 not on the table, but the condition requires that in the earlier state, red1 is not on the table or white1 is clear. Wait, in step0 and 1, red1 is still on the table. Because stacking orange2 on red1 doesn't move red1. Oh, right! Stacking orange2 on red1 means red1 is still on the table, but now has orange2 on top. So red1 is on the table, but not clear. So red1 is still on the table. Therefore, in step2 when we hold yellow, the earlier state (step1) has red1 on the table, which doesn't satisfy the condition. So this approach doesn't solve the problem.

Ah, right. So stacking orange2 on red1 leaves red1 on the table. Therefore, to have red1 not on the table, we need to move red1. So perhaps:

0. pickup red_block_1
1. stack red_block_1 orange_block_2
Then, red1 is on orange2, so not on the table. Then, when we unstack yellow, the prior state (step1) has red1 not on the table. So the conditional is satisfied.

Then, proceed to handle other constraints.

But after step1, orange_block_2 has red1 on top. So orange2 is not clear. Then, to stack something on red1, we would need to unstack red1 first. But maybe that's not necessary. Let's proceed.

So steps:

0. pickup red_block_1
1. stack red_block_1 orange_block_2
2. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
3. putdown yellow_block_1

Now, red1 is on orange2, so not on the table. When we hold yellow in step2, the prior state (step1) has red1 not on the table. So the conditional is satisfied.

Now, other constraints:

- Need to have a state where green_block_1 is not clear and orange_block_1 is not clear. So stack something on green1 and on orange1.

Green1 is on white2. Let's stack orange1 on green1:

4. pickup orange_block_1
5. stack orange_block_1 green_block_1

Now, green1 has orange1 on top, so not clear. Then stack something on orange1. Maybe white_block_1 is available (clear after step2). So:

6. pickup white_block_1
7. stack white_block_1 orange_block_1

Now, orange1 has white1 on top, not clear. So this satisfies the constraint.

Next, the constraint that there's a state where you are holding red_block_1 and orange_block_2 is not clear. Currently, red1 is on orange2. So to hold red1, we need to unstack it from orange2:

8. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_2
9. (hold red_block_1; at this point, orange2 is clear again. So this doesn't satisfy the requirement that orange2 is not clear while holding red. So this step won't help. Instead, perhaps before unstacking red1, stack something on orange2. But orange2 is under red1. So to stack on orange2, we need to first unstack red1. But that's a problem.

Alternatively, after step1, orange2 has red1 on top. So orange2 is not clear. If we can hold red1 while orange2 is not clear. But when we unstack red1 from orange2 (step8), we are holding red1, and orange2 becomes clear. So that's not helpful. So perhaps we need to stack another block on orange2 after step1. But since red1 is on orange2, we can't stack anything else on orange2 unless we move red1.

Alternatively, during another part of the plan, stack something on orange2. For example, after step7, perhaps we can stack another block on orange2. But that requires picking up a block and stacking. Let's see:

After step7, available blocks on the table: white_block_2 (with green1 and orange1 on top), white_block_1 is stacked on orange1, yellow is on the table, red1 is on orange2. So orange2 has red1, and orange2 is not clear. So if we can hold red1 while orange2 is not clear, but that requires that when we hold red1, orange2 is not clear. The only way is to unstack red1 from orange2 while orange2 has something else on it. But that's impossible because red1 is on top. So perhaps this constraint can't be met with the current steps. Therefore, we need to find another way.

Alternatively, after stacking red1 on orange2 (step1), then stack another block on orange2. But since red1 is on orange2, you can't stack on orange2 unless you move red1. So maybe:

After step1, stack another block on red1. Let's say stack white_block_2 on red1. But white_block_2 has green1 and orange1 on it. To move white_block_2, we need to unstack green1 and orange1 first. This is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, find another way to satisfy the constraint. The constraint is that there's a state where you are holding red1 and orange2 is not clear. So when you pick up red1, orange2 must have a block on top. But if red1 is on orange2, then to pick up red1, you unstack it from orange2, which makes orange2 clear. So that doesn't work. Therefore, we need to have another block on orange2 while holding red1. How?

Perhaps:

- Stack another block on orange2, then pick up red1 while leaving the other block on orange2.

But to stack on orange2, it must be clear. So first, stack block A on orange2. Then stack red1 on top of block A. Then, when you unstack red1 from block A, you are holding red1, and block A is still on orange2. So orange2 is not clear.

So steps:

0. pickup blockA (say, orange_block_2)
1. stack orange_block_2 orange_block_2 (can't stack on itself)
Wait, no. Let's pick a different block. Let's stack white_block_1 on orange2.

But white_block_1 is under yellow initially. After moving yellow, white_block_1 is clear.

So after step3 (putdown yellow), white_block_1 is clear.

So steps:

0. pickup red_block_1
1. stack red_block_1 orange_block_2 (red1 is on orange2, orange2 not clear)
2. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
3. putdown yellow_block_1
4. pickup white_block_1
5. stack white_block_1 orange_block_2 (but orange2 has red1 on top, so can't stack. So this is invalid.)

Alternatively, stack white_block_1 on red_block_1. But red1 is on orange2. So:

4. pickup white_block_1
5. stack white_block_1 red_block_1

Now, red1 has white1 on top. So orange2 has red1 and white1. Then, to hold red1, we need to unstack white1 first:

6. unstack white_block_1 red_block_1
7. putdown white_block_1
8. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_2
Now holding red1, and orange2 is clear. Not helpful.

Alternatively, after step1 (red1 on orange2), stack another block on orange2. But how? Since red1 is on orange2, you can't stack anything else. Therefore, this approach doesn't work.

Another idea: stack red1 on orange2, then stack another block on red1. So:

0. pickup red_block_1
1. stack red_block_1 orange_block_2
2. pickup another block (e.g., orange_block_1)
3. stack orange_block_1 red_block_1

Now, red1 has orange1 on top. Orange2 has red1. Then, unstack orange1 from red1:

4. unstack orange_block_1 red_block_1
Now holding orange1. Then, stack orange1 somewhere else.

But this doesn't help with the constraint.

Alternatively, after step3 (stack orange1 on red1), then unstack red1 from orange2:

But you can't unstack red1 because it has orange1 on top. So you need to unstack orange1 first.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the constraint requiring holding red1 and orange2 not clear is the hardest one. Let's think differently. Maybe during the process of stacking on green and orange1, we can also stack something on orange2.

For example, after step3 (putdown yellow), we can stack orange2 on green1. Then, later, pickup red1 and have orange2 not clear.

But let's outline:

0. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
1. putdown yellow_block_1
This achieves the goal but misses the condition about holding yellow requiring a prior state with red1 not on table.

So this won't work.

Alternatively, the correct order is to first handle the constraints that require moving blocks before unstacking yellow.

So:

Steps:

1. pickup red_block_1
2. stack red_block_1 orange_block_2 (red1 not on table, orange2 not clear)
3. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1 (goal done)

Now, we've handled the holding yellow's conditional, because before unstacking yellow, red1 was moved off the table.

Then, need to stack on green and orange1:

5. pickup orange_block_1
6. stack orange_block_1 green_block_1 (green1 not clear)
7. pickup white_block_1
8. stack white_block_1 orange_block_1 (orange1 not clear)

Now, the constraint about green and orange both having blocks is satisfied.

Now, the constraint about holding red1 and orange2 not clear: currently, red1 is on orange2. To hold red1, we need to unstack it from orange2, but that would make orange2 clear. Unless we have another block on orange2. But we can't do that. Alternatively, during the unstacking of red1, we are holding it, and orange2 is clear. So this doesn't satisfy the constraint.

So to satisfy this, we need to have another block on orange2 while holding red1. How?

Perhaps stack another block on orange2 before moving red1:

9. pickup white_block_2 (but green_block_1 is on white2. So first, unstack green_block_1 and orange_block_1 from white2. Wait, green_block_1 is on white2, and orange1 is on green1. So to pickup white2, we need to unstack green1 and orange1. But that's a lot of steps.

Alternatively, after step8, we have:

- orange2 has red1.
- green1 has orange1.
- orange1 has white1.

So, to stack something on orange2 without moving red1, which is impossible. So perhaps this constraint can't be satisfied with the current plan. Therefore, we need to adjust.

Alternative approach: After step2 (stack red1 on orange2), stack another block on orange2. But since red1 is on orange2, you can't. Unless you stack on red1. For example:

5. pickup orange_block_1
6. stack orange_block_1 red_block_1 (now orange1 is on red1, which is on orange2)

Now, orange2 has red1 and orange1. Then, to hold red1, we need to unstack orange1:

7. unstack orange_block_1 red_block_1
8. putdown orange_block_1
9. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_2
Now holding red1, but orange2 is clear. Doesn't help.

Alternatively, after step6, unstack red1 from orange2 while orange1 is on top. But you can't unstack red1 because it has orange1 on top. So this is not possible.

This is really challenging. Maybe there's a different way to satisfy this constraint. The constraint is: "you are holding red_block_1" and "orange_block_2 is not clear". So while holding red1, there must be a block on orange2. So during the time you hold red1, orange2 must have a block. So perhaps:

- Stack something on orange2.
- Then pickup red1 from somewhere else, while orange2 has the block.

But how? If red1 is on the table, then you can stack something on orange2, then pickup red1. But in that case, orange2 is not clear (has a block), and you are holding red1. That satisfies the constraint.

For example:

Steps:

0. pickup orange_block_2
1. stack orange_block_2 red_block_1 (orange2 is on red1, red1 is not clear)
2. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
3. putdown yellow_block_1
4. pickup red_block_1 (can't, because it has orange2 on top. Need to unstack first.)

So:

4. unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1
5. putdown orange_block_2
6. pickup red_block_1

Now, holding red1, orange2 is on the table (clear). So doesn't satisfy.

Alternatively, stack something else on orange2 before picking up red1:

4. pickup white_block_1
5. stack white_block_1 orange_block_2
6. pickup red_block_1

Now, while holding red1, orange2 has white1 on top (not clear). This satisfies the constraint.

So steps:

0. pickup orange_block_2
1. stack orange_block_2 red_block_1 (orange2 on red1)
2. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
3. putdown yellow_block_1 (goal done)
4. unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1 (now holding orange2)
5. putdown orange_block_2
6. pickup white_block_1
7. stack white_block_1 orange_block_2 (now orange2 has white1)
8. pickup red_block_1 (now holding red1, orange2 has white1)

This satisfies the constraint. So steps 0-8.

But this is a lot of steps. Let's check if this works.

Step0: pickup orange2, stack on red1. Now, red1 is not clear.

Step2-3: move yellow to table.

Step4: unstack orange2 from red1. Now holding orange2, red1 is clear.

Step5: putdown orange2.

Step6: pickup white1 (which is clear after step3).

Step7: stack white1 on orange2. Now, orange2 has white1, not clear.

Step8: pickup red1. Now, holding red1, orange2 has white1. This satisfies the constraint.

Then, proceed to stack on green and orange1.

Step9: pickup orange_block_1

Step10: stack orange1 on green_block_1.

Step11: pickup another block (maybe white_block_2 has green and orange1. So need to unstack them. This complicates things.)

Alternatively, after step8, we can stack red1 somewhere else, but this is getting too long.

This plan is getting very lengthy, but the user asked for the optimal (shortest) plan. So perhaps there's a more efficient way.

Let me try to integrate all the constraints into the minimal steps.

The main goal is to move yellow to the table, which takes two steps: unstack and putdown. But we need to handle the constraints.

Let's see:

Constraints that require actions:

1. red_block_1 must have a block on top at least once. So stack something on red1.

2. green and orange1 must each have a block on top. So two stack actions.

3. You must hold red1 while orange2 is not clear. So need to have a block on orange2 when holding red1.

4. The conditional that when you hold yellow, there was a prior state where red1 was not on the table or white1 clear. Since white1 is not clear until you unstack yellow, this requires moving red1 before unstacking.

So the plan must include:

- Move red1 off the table before unstacking yellow.

- Stack something on red1.

- Stack something on green and orange1.

- Have a state where you hold red1 and orange2 has a block.

Let's attempt:

Step0: pickup red_block_1

Step1: stack red_block_1 orange_block_2 (now red1 is on orange2, not on table. This satisfies the conditional for when holding yellow.)

Step2: unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1

Step3: putdown yellow_block_1 (goal done)

Step4: pickup orange_block_1

Step5: stack orange_block_1 green_block_1 (green not clear)

Step6: pickup white_block_1

Step7: stack white_block_1 orange_block_1 (orange1 not clear)

Step8: unstack red_block_1 orange_block_2 (now holding red1, orange2 is clear. Not good.)

So this doesn't satisfy the constraint of holding red1 with orange2 not clear.

Alternative:

After step1 (red1 on orange2), stack another block on orange2. But red1 is on orange2, so can't. Unless we stack on red1.

Step4: pickup white_block_1

Step5: stack white_block_1 red_block_1 (now red1 has white1, orange2 has red1 and white1)

Step6: unstack white_block_1 red_block_1

Step7: putdown white_block_1

Step8: unstack red_block_1 orange_block_2 (now holding red1, orange2 is clear. Not good.)

Still no luck.

Alternative idea: Use the stacking of orange_block_1 on green_block_1 and then white_block_1 on orange_block_1 as part of the steps, and then stack red1 on orange2, but that doesn't help.

Alternatively, after step1 (red1 on orange2), stack orange_block_1 on orange2, but orange2 has red1. So impossible.

This is really tricky. Maybe the shortest plan involves 10+ steps. But the user wants the optimal (shortest) plan. Let's think again.

Perhaps we can satisfy multiple constraints with fewer steps.

For example, stacking orange_block_1 on green_block_1 satisfies the constraint on green, and then stacking white_block_1 on orange_block_1 satisfies the constraint on orange1.

Also, stacking orange_block_2 on red_block_1 satisfies the red1 not clear constraint.

Additionally, when we stack orange_block_2 on red_block_1, orange2 is not on the table, which helps with the white1 constraint.

And when we stack orange_block_2 on red_block_1, then orange2 is on red1, which means that orange2 is not clear. If we then pickup red_block_1 (which requires unstacking orange2 first), but that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps during another part of the plan, we can have red1 held while orange2 has something else on it.

But perhaps the key is to combine the steps where possible.

Let me outline a possible plan:

1. pickup orange_block_2
2. stack orange_block_2 red_block_1 (now red1 has orange2, orange2 not on table)
3. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1 (goal achieved)
5. pickup orange_block_1
6. stack orange_block_1 green_block_1 (green not clear)
7. pickup white_block_1
8. stack white_block_1 orange_block_1 (orange1 not clear)
9. unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1 (now holding orange2)
10. stack orange_block_2 orange_block_2 (invalid, can't stack on itself)
11. putdown orange_block_2 (now orange2 is on table)
12. pickup red_block_1
13. stack red_block_1 orange_block_2 (now red1 is on orange2, holding red1 not possible unless we unstack. Not helpful.)

Alternatively, after step9, holding orange2, we need to stack it somewhere else. For example:

9. unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1
10. stack orange_block_2 white_block_2 (but white_block_2 has green and orange1. So invalid.)

This is getting too complicated. Perhaps the answer requires accepting that some constraints are satisfied in the initial state and others through necessary steps, even if it's longer.

Given the time constraints, I think the minimal steps that satisfy all constraints would be around 10 actions. But I need to find the optimal path.

Let me try to compile all required steps:

To satisfy the holding red1 and orange2 not clear:

- Stack block A on orange2.
- Hold red1 while block A is on orange2.

To do this:

1. Stack block A on orange2.
2. Pickup red1 (must be elsewhere, like on the table).

But red1 starts on the table. So steps:

1. pickup block A (e.g., orange2)
2. stack A on orange2 (now A is on orange2)
3. pickup red1 (which is on the table)
Now, holding red1 and orange2 has A on top. This satisfies the constraint.

But how to do this without conflicting with other constraints.

So steps:

0. pickup orange_block_2
1. stack orange_block_2 orange_block_2 (invalid)
No. So pick another block. Let's say white_block_1:

0. pickup white_block_1 (can't, as it has yellow on top. So first, unstack yellow.)

Wait, but the conditional requires moving red1 before unstacking yellow. So perhaps:

0. pickup white_block_1 (can't, because it has yellow. So first, unstack yellow.)

But that would violate the conditional for holding yellow.

This is really challenging. 

Perhaps the correct plan is:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1
But this doesn't satisfy the conditional for holding yellow.

Thus, the minimal plan must include steps to move red1 off the table before unstacking yellow.

So:

1. pickup red_block_1
2. stack red_block_1 orange_block_2
3. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1
5. pickup orange_block_2 (from red1, but red1 is on orange2)
6. stack orange_block_2 red_block_1 (now orange2 is on red1)
7. unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1 (holding orange2)
8. stack orange_block_2 green_block_1
9. pickup orange_block_1
10. stack orange_block_1 orange_block_2
11. pickup white_block_1
12. stack white_block_1 orange_block_1

This seems too long, but perhaps this is the way.

Alternatively, after step2 (red1 on orange2), do:

3. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1
5. pickup orange_block_1
6. stack orange_block_1 green_block_1
7. pickup white_block_1
8. stack white_block_1 orange_block_1
9. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_2
10. stack red_block_1 white_block_2 (but white_block_2 has green and orange1)
11. pickup orange_block_2
12. stack orange_block_2 red_block_1

This is getting too long. I think I'm stuck. Maybe the optimal plan is:

```
pickup red_block_1
stack red_block_1 orange_block_2
unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
putdown yellow_block_1
pickup orange_block_1
stack orange_block_1 green_block_1
pickup white_block_1
stack white_block_1 orange_block_1
unstack red_block_1 orange_block_2
stack red_block_1 orange_block_2
```

But this doesn't satisfy all constraints. For instance, the step where you hold red_block_1 (unstacking from orange2) leaves orange2 clear. So the constraint requiring holding red1 while orange2 is not clear isn't met.

Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to proceed with a plan that covers the main points, even if it's not perfect. But I need to ensure all constraints are met.
