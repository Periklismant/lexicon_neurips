To achieve the goal "brown_block_1 is on top of green_block_1" while satisfying all constraints, we need to carefully analyze the constraints to understand the full requirements, including intermediate states and the final configuration.

**Analysis of Key Constraints:**

1.  **C2 (Effective Goal Modification):** "If green_block_1 is not clear holds in some state s, then 'brown_block_1 is not clear' AND 'red_block_1 is on top of black_block_1' must hold at s or some state after s."
    Since the goal On(brown_block_1, green_block_1) makes green_block_1 not clear, this constraint implies that the final state must also satisfy:
    *   On(Y, brown_block_1) (for some block Y, making brown_block_1 not clear)
    *   On(red_block_1, black_block_1)
    A consistent interpretation is that the final tower involving brown_block_1 and green_block_1 is Y on brown_block_1 on green_block_1. If Y is black_block_1, then the tower is black_block_1 on brown_block_1 on green_block_1. Combined with On(red_block_1, black_block_1), this implies a final main tower: red_block_1 on black_block_1 on brown_block_1 on green_block_1.

2.  **C13 and C10 (Early Actions):**
    *   C13: "If red_block_1 is not on black_block_1 (true initially), then holding(brown_block_2) must hold at s or after s." This forces an early `unstack brown_block_2 black_block_1`.
    *   C10: "If green_block_1 is not on black_block_1 (true initially), then black_block_2 is not clear must hold at s or after s." This forces something to be stacked on black_block_2.

3.  **C4 and C11 (Intermediate States for brown_block_1):**
    *   C4: "If brown_block_1 is on the table (true initially and for some intermediate states), then white_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 must hold at s or after s."
    *   C11: "red_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 must hold in at least one state."
    These require brown_block_1 to be temporarily under white_block_1 and red_block_1 while it's on the table, before being moved to its final position on green_block_1.

4.  **C5 and C7 (Movement Restrictions):**
    *   C5: "brown_block_2 is not on the table" (every state).
    *   C7: "black_block_1 is not on the table" (every state).
    These mean if brown_block_2 or black_block_1 are picked up, they must be stacked on another block, not put on the table.

5.  **C15 (Precondition for moving brown_block_1):** "If brown_block_1 is not on the table (as in the final goal), then there must be an earlier state where 'holding(green_block_1)' or 'holding(white_block_1)' was true."

**Plan Outline:**

1.  Satisfy C13 and C10: Unstack brown_block_2 from black_block_1 and stack it on black_block_2.
2.  Prepare green_block_1: Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_1 and place it on the table. (Satisfies C15's "holding(green_block_1)" part).
3.  Prepare brown_block_1: Unstack black_block_1 from brown_block_1. Park black_block_1 (e.g., on brown_block_2, due to C7). brown_block_1 is now clear on the table.
4.  Satisfy C4 (On(white_block_1, brown_block_1)): Get white_block_1 (unstack red_block_1, putdown red_block_1, pickup white_block_1) and stack it on brown_block_1. Then unstack white_block_1 and put it down to make brown_block_1 clear again. (Also satisfies C15's "holding(white_block_1)" part).
5.  Satisfy C11 (On(red_block_1, brown_block_1)): Pickup red_block_1 and stack it on brown_block_1. Then unstack red_block_1 and put it down to make brown_block_1 clear again.
6.  Build the main tower (red_block_1 -> black_block_1 -> brown_block_1 -> green_block_1):
    a.  Pickup brown_block_1 and stack it on green_block_1.
    b.  Unstack black_block_1 from its parking spot and stack it on brown_block_1.
    c.  Pickup red_block_1 and stack it on black_block_1.

This sequence ensures all "at least once" and conditional constraints are met.
