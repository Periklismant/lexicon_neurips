Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to have brown_block_1 on top of green_block_1. The initial state is a bit complex with several blocks stacked. Let me first visualize the initial setup.

So, initial state:
- white_block_1 is on the table, with red_block_1 on top, then green_block_1 on red_block_1. So white -> red -> green, all clear except white and red (since green is clear).
- brown_block_1 is on the table, with black_block_1 on top, then brown_block_2 on black_block_1. So brown_block_1 -> black_block_1 -> brown_block_2. Both brown_block_2 and black_block_2 are clear.
- black_block_2 is alone on the table, clear.

The constraints are numerous. Let's list them out to make sure I don't miss any:

1. At some point, green_block_1 must not be clear (has a block on top). And if that's true, then either in that state or later, brown_block_1 must not be clear (has a block on top) and red_block_1 is on black_block_1.

2. At some point, brown_block_1 must be on the table, and if so, then white_block_1 must be on top of it either then or later.

3. brown_block_2 must never be on the table. Wait, initial state has brown_block_2 on top of black_block_1. So as long as we don't put it on the table, that's okay. So in any state, brown_block_2 is not on the table. So we can't putdown brown_block_2.

4. At least once, either black_block_2 has a block on top or white_block_1 is on green_block_1.

5. black_block_1 is never on the table. Initially, it's on brown_block_1, so we have to ensure that when we move it, we don't put it on the table. So any action involving black_block_1 must stack it somewhere else.

6. At some point, red_block_1 must be on black_block_1.

7. At some point, green_block_1 is not on top of black_block_1. Since initially green is on red, which is on white, so initial state already satisfies this? Wait, green is on red_block_1, which is on white_block_1. So green is not on black_block_1. So that's already true. But maybe during the plan, if green is moved onto black_block_1, then later moved off. Hmm, but the constraint is that at some state, green is not on top of black_block_1. Which is already true in the initial state. So maybe that's satisfied. But the problem says "must hold in at least one state", so as long as it's true at some point. So maybe that's already met. But perhaps during the plan, if we move green_block_1 onto black_block_1, then we have to make sure that later it's moved off again. But maybe the initial state already satisfies this constraint. Wait, the problem says "the task is to bring about the following situation: brown_block_1 is on top of green_block_1". The constraints are additional conditions that the plan must satisfy. So the initial state may already meet some constraints, but the plan must ensure that all constraints are met during its execution. So for constraint 7, if in any state during the plan, green_block_1 is not on black_block_1, then it's okay. But perhaps the initial state already satisfies this. However, maybe during the plan, we need to have a state where this is true again. Hmm, not sure. Let's check the exact wording: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'green_block_1 is not on top of black_block_1'". Since in the initial state, green is on red, which is on white, so yes, in the initial state this is true. So that's already satisfied. But when the plan starts executing actions, maybe that changes. Wait, no. The initial state is part of the states considered. So the initial state counts as one of the states where that condition holds. So maybe that constraint is already satisfied. But the user might still need to ensure that during the plan, it's not violated. Wait, no—the constraints are about the plan's states. So if the initial state is part of the plan's states (which it is), then if the condition holds in the initial state, that's acceptable. So maybe that constraint is already met. But perhaps the plan needs to not make it false in all states? Wait, no. The constraint is "must hold in at least one state", so as long as there's at least one state (could be initial) where it's true. So that's okay. So perhaps that constraint is already satisfied. But I need to confirm that during the plan's execution, there's at least one state (could be initial) where green_block_1 is not on top of black_block_1. Since the initial state is part of the plan's states, that's true. So maybe that constraint is already met. However, if during the plan, we move green_block_1 onto black_block_1, then we need to make sure that in some state after that, it's moved off again. Wait, no. The constraint is that there exists at least one state where green is not on black. Since the initial state is such a state, that's sufficient. So no action needed for that.

But then there's another constraint: if in some state s, green is not on black, then in s or a later state, black_block_2 must have a block on top. So since the initial state s0 satisfies green not on black, then in s0 or later, black_block_2 must not be clear. So in the initial state, black_block_2 is clear, so we need to have at some point after s0, black_block_2 has a block on top. So that's a required condition. So in the plan, we need to ensure that after the initial state, at some point, we put a block on black_block_2.

Moving on to other constraints. Let's go step by step.

Constraints:

1. At least one state where green_block_1 is not clear. Then, if that's true, in that state or after, brown_block_1 is not clear and red_block_1 is on black_block_1.

So we need to have green_block_1 have a block on top (since that's the only way it's not clear). The goal is to put brown_block_1 on green_block_1. So once we stack brown_block_1 on green, that will make green not clear. So that's part of the goal. Then, after that state, we need to ensure that brown_block_1 is not clear (so something is on top of it) and red_block_1 is on black_block_1.

But wait, the goal is only brown_block_1 on green. So after achieving the goal, if brown_block_1 is on green, then brown_block_1 is clear (since nothing is on top). Unless we stack something else on it. So the constraint says that after green is not clear (i.e., when brown is on green), then either in that state or later, brown_block_1 must not be clear (so something is on it) and red is on black_block_1.

But our goal is to have brown on green. So to satisfy this constraint, after putting brown on green, we need to stack something else on brown_block_1 and also have red on black_block_1.

But the goal doesn't require anything else. So the plan must not only achieve the goal but also satisfy these constraints. So even after achieving the goal, maybe we need to do more steps to meet the constraints.

But wait, the problem says "bring about the goal while satisfying all constraints". So the plan must end with the goal state, but also all constraints must be satisfied in the states along the plan. So the constraints must hold in at least one state (could be during the plan) and some must hold in every state.

So for constraint 1: After we stack brown_block_1 on green_block_1 (making green not clear), we need to ensure that in that state or a subsequent state, brown_block_1 is not clear (has a block on top) and red is on black_block_1. So perhaps after achieving the goal, we need to stack something on brown_block_1 and move red_block_1 to black_block_1.

But the goal is only brown on green. So the final state must have brown on green, but the constraints may require additional conditions in the plan's states. So the plan may have steps after achieving the goal to satisfy the constraints.

But how can we do that? Let's think.

Another constraint is that red_block_1 must be on black_block_1 at some state. That's constraint 6. So in the plan, we need to have red_block_1 on black_block_1 at some point. Also, constraint 1 requires that if green is not clear (which it is in the goal state), then in that state or after, brown_block_1 is not clear and red is on black_block_1. So the goal state has green not clear (brown on it), but in that state, brown_block_1 is clear (since nothing is on it). So the constraint 1 requires that either in the goal state or after, we have brown_block_1 not clear and red on black_block_1. So after achieving the goal, we need to stack something on brown_block_1 and move red to black_block_1.

But the goal is only to have brown on green. So the plan can have additional steps after the goal is achieved, as long as the final state is the goal. Wait, no. The problem says "the task is to bring about the following situation: brown_block_1 is on top of green_block_1". So the final state must have brown_block_1 on green. Any actions after that would change the state, possibly undoing the goal. So the plan must end with the goal state. Therefore, the constraints must be satisfied within the plan's steps, including possibly the final state.

But how can we satisfy constraint 1? Let's see:

Constraint 1: When green is not clear (which happens when brown is on green), in that state or later, brown_block_1 is not clear (has something on top) and red is on black_block_1. But the final state is brown on green (so green is not clear), and brown is clear. Therefore, the final state would violate the implication of constraint 1, unless in the final state, red is on black_block_1 and brown_block_1 is not clear. But in the final state, brown_block_1 is on green, so unless there's a block on brown_block_1, which would require stacking something else on it. But that's not part of the goal. So this seems conflicting. Therefore, the plan must include steps after achieving the goal to satisfy these constraints, but the problem states that the goal must be achieved. Hmm, this is a bit tricky.

Wait, the problem says "bring about the goal of the problem while satisfying all constraints". The constraints must be satisfied during the execution of the plan, but the final state must be the goal. So in the final state, brown_block_1 is on green. So in that state, green is not clear. Then, according to constraint 1, either in that state or after, brown_block_1 is not clear and red is on black_block_1. But the plan ends in the final state. So if in the final state, brown_block_1 is clear (as per the goal), then the implication of constraint 1 is not satisfied. Therefore, the plan must arrange that in the final state, both brown_block_1 is on green (goal) and brown_block_1 is not clear (something on top) and red is on black_block_1. But that's impossible unless the goal is modified. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the constraints.

Wait, the constraints are about the plan's states. So the plan's sequence of actions must result in states that satisfy the constraints. For example, constraint 1 says that there must be at least one state where green is not clear. The goal state will be such a state. Then, for that state (the final state), the implication is that in that state or a subsequent one, brown_block_1 is not clear and red is on black_block_1. However, the plan ends at the final state, so the subsequent state doesn't exist. Therefore, in the final state, both conditions (brown_block_1 not clear and red on black_block_1) must hold. But the goal is only brown on green. So how can this be resolved?

This suggests that the plan must achieve the goal and also, in the same state, have red on black_block_1 and something on brown_block_1. But the goal doesn't require that. So perhaps the plan must include steps that achieve the goal and also satisfy these additional conditions in the same state. That complicates things.

Let me try to outline the necessary steps.

First, the initial state:

Stacks:

- white_block_1 (table) → red_block_1 → green_block_1 (clear)
- brown_block_1 (table) → black_block_1 → brown_block_2 (clear)
- black_block_2 (table, clear)

We need to get brown_block_1 on green_block_1.

To do that, we need to move brown_block_1 from the table. Currently, brown_block_1 has black_block_1 on top, which in turn has brown_block_2. So to pick up brown_block_1, we need to first clear it by removing black_block_1 and brown_block_2.

Wait, brown_block_1 is on the table with black_block_1 on it. So brown_block_1 is under black_block_1. To pick up brown_block_1, it must be clear (no blocks on top). But black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1, so brown_block_1 is not clear. Therefore, we need to unstack black_block_1 from brown_block_1. But black_block_1 has brown_block_2 on top. So to unstack black_block_1, we need to first remove brown_block_2.

So steps:

1. Unstack brown_block_2 from black_block_1.

But to unstack brown_block_2 from black_block_1, the robotic arm must be empty. Initially, it is. So unstack brown_block_2 black_block_1. Then, the arm is holding brown_block_2. Now, we need to put it somewhere. But we can't put it on the table because of constraint 3: brown_block_2 must never be on the table. So we must stack it on another block. The only available clear blocks are green_block_1, brown_block_2 (now held), black_block_2 (clear). Wait, after unstacking brown_block_2, black_block_1 becomes clear. So perhaps we can stack brown_block_2 onto black_block_1 again, but that would be putting it back. But maybe there's another way.

Alternatively, stack brown_block_2 onto black_block_2. Since black_block_2 is clear. Let me see. Let's proceed.

Action: unstack brown_block_2 black_block_1. This requires that brown_block_2 is on black_block_1 and clear, which it is. After this, the arm is holding brown_block_2. Now, we need to place it. Since we can't put it on the table, we have to stack it somewhere. The available clear blocks are black_block_1 (now clear after unstacking), green_block_1 (has red and white under, but green is clear), black_block_2 (clear). So options: stack brown_block_2 on black_block_1, black_block_2, green_block_1, or another block.

But stacking on green_block_1 would make green not clear, which triggers constraint 1. But let's see.

If we stack brown_block_2 on black_block_2, then black_block_2 is no longer clear. That would satisfy constraint 4: at least one state where either black_block_2 is not clear or white on green. Since stacking brown on black_block_2 makes black_block_2 not clear, that satisfies one of the options for constraint 4. So that's good.

So action: stack brown_block_2 black_block_2.

Now, black_block_2 has brown_block_2 on top.

Next, we can unstack black_block_1 from brown_block_1. Because black_block_1 is now clear (after removing brown_block_2). So action: unstack black_block_1 brown_block_1. Now, the arm is holding black_block_1. We need to place it somewhere. Since constraint 5 says black_block_1 can't be on the table. So we have to stack it on another block. The clear blocks now are brown_block_1 (on table, clear), green_block_1 (still has red and white under, but green is clear), black_block_1 is being held, black_block_2 has brown_block_2. So possible options: stack black_block_1 on green_block_1, but that would interfere with the goal. Alternatively, stack it on brown_block_1. Wait, but brown_block_1 is on the table. If we stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1, that's allowed. But then brown_block_1 is not clear. But we need to pick up brown_block_1 later to put it on green. So maybe that's not ideal.

Alternatively, stack black_block_1 on black_block_2, which already has brown_block_2. But can we stack on top of brown_block_2? Yes, if brown_block_2 is clear. But after stacking brown_block_2 on black_block_2, brown_block_2 is clear. Wait, stacking brown_block_2 on black_block_2 would make brown_block_2 on black_block_2, and brown_block_2 is clear. Then, can we stack black_block_1 on brown_block_2? Yes, if we can pick up black_block_1 and brown_block_2 is clear. Wait, after stacking brown_block_2 on black_block_2, brown_block_2 is on black_block_2, and brown_block_2 is clear (since nothing is on top). So we can stack black_block_1 on brown_block_2. But why would we do that?

Alternatively, stack black_block_1 on green_block_1. But the goal is to have brown_block_1 on green. So if we stack black_block_1 on green, then we have to move it again later. That adds steps.

Alternatively, stack black_block_1 on red_block_1. But red_block_1 is under green_block_1, so red_block_1 is not clear. So we can't stack on red.

Hmm, maybe stack black_block_1 on white_block_1. But white_block_1 has red_block_1 on top, which is under green. So white_block_1 is not clear.

Alternatively, stack black_block_1 on black_block_2. But black_block_2 has brown_block_2. Wait, after stacking brown_block_2 on black_block_2, brown_block_2 is clear. So we can stack black_block_1 on brown_block_2. Let's try that.

After unstacking black_block_1 from brown_block_1, we have to place it. Let's choose to stack it on brown_block_2, which is on black_block_2.

Action: stack black_block_1 brown_block_2.

Wait, but brown_block_2 is on black_block_2. So stacking black_block_1 on brown_block_2 would create a stack: black_block_2 → brown_block_2 → black_block_1. That's allowed. So now, black_block_1 is on brown_block_2, which is on black_block_2. Then, black_block_1 is clear. So now, to get brown_block_1, which is on the table and clear, we can pick it up.

So now, brown_block_1 is clear. So action: pickup brown_block_1.

Then, stack brown_block_1 on green_block_1. That achieves the goal. But now, in the final state, green_block_1 is not clear (has brown_block_1), which triggers constraint 1. So we need to ensure that in this state or after, brown_block_1 is not clear and red_block_1 is on black_block_1.

But in this state, brown_block_1 is clear (since nothing is on top). So we need to have another step where we stack something on brown_block_1. Let's see what's available. Available blocks: red_block_1 is under green_block_1. To get red, we need to unstack green_block_1 from red_block_1. Then, unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1. But that's a lot of steps.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another way. Let's see.

Wait, after stacking brown_block_1 on green, we need to stack something on brown_block_1. What blocks are available? The blocks that are clear are black_block_1 (on brown_block_2), white_block_1 (under red), red_block_1 (under green), black_block_2 (under brown_block_2), and brown_block_2 (under black_block_1). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe during the process of achieving the goal, we can also satisfy the constraints.

Let me retrace the steps so far:

1. unstack brown_block_2 from black_block_1 → hold brown_block_2.

2. stack brown_block_2 on black_block_2 → now black_block_2 has brown_block_2, which is clear.

3. unstack black_block_1 from brown_block_1 → hold black_block_1.

4. stack black_block_1 on brown_block_2 → now brown_block_2 has black_block_1, which is clear.

5. pickup brown_block_1 from table (since it's clear now).

6. stack brown_block_1 on green_block_1 → goal achieved.

Now, in the final state (step 6), brown_block_1 is on green, so green is not clear. According to constraint 1, in this state or after, brown_block_1 must not be clear and red must be on black_block_1. But in this state, brown_block_1 is clear. So we need to add steps after step 6 to stack something on brown_block_1 and move red to black_block_1.

But the problem requires the plan to end with the goal. So the final state must be brown_block_1 on green. Therefore, the steps after stacking brown_block_1 on green must not undo that. So we need to stack something on brown_block_1 and move red to black_block_1 while keeping brown on green.

So after step 6:

7. unstack green_block_1 from red_block_1. Wait, green is under brown_block_1. No, brown is on green. So to access red, we need to unstack brown_block_1 from green, but that would undo the goal. Not allowed. So we can't do that.

Alternative approach: Before stacking brown_block_1 on green, we need to move red_block_1 to black_block_1 and stack something on brown_block_1.

But that complicates the plan. Let's think.

Alternative plan:

Perhaps instead of immediately moving brown_block_1 to green, we first move red_block_1 to black_block_1, then proceed.

But red_block_1 is under green_block_1. So to move red, we need to unstack green_block_1, then unstack red_block_1.

So steps:

1. unstack green_block_1 from red_block_1 → hold green.

2. putdown green_block_1 → but that would make green on the table. Then, unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1 → hold red.

3. stack red_block_1 on black_block_1 → but black_block_1 is on brown_block_2, which is on black_block_2. So stack red on black_block_1.

But need to clear black_block_1 first. Currently, black_block_1 has brown_block_2 on top (from previous steps?), wait no. Wait, initial state: black_block_1 is on brown_block_1, with brown_block_2 on top. So to move red to black_block_1, we need to have black_block_1 clear. So first, unstack brown_block_2 from black_block_1.

But this is getting complicated. Let's try to outline the steps again, considering all constraints.

Alternative approach: Let's list all constraints and ensure each is satisfied.

Constraints:

C1: At least one state with green not clear. Satisfied when brown is on green (goal state). Then, in that state or after, brown must not be clear and red on black_block_1.

C2: At least one state with brown_block_1 on table. Initial state has that. So satisfied. But if during the plan, brown_block_1 is picked up, then later put down again, but constraint C2 says if brown is on table in any state, then white must be on top of it in that or a later state. So in the initial state, brown is on table, so in that state or later, white must be on brown. But the initial state does not have white on brown. So this constraint requires that if brown is ever on the table (which it is initially), then white must be stacked on it at some point. So during the plan, after the initial state, if brown is on the table again, then white must be put on top. But since we need to pick up brown from the table to put it on green, perhaps the initial state's condition is already handled. Wait, no. The constraint is: if in any state s, brown_block_1 is on the table, then in s or later, white is on top of it. The initial state s0 has brown on table. So in s0 or later, white must be on brown. But white is on the table with red on top in s0. So we need to have white on brown at some point. So in the plan, we must move white_block_1 onto brown_block_1.

But brown_block_1 is initially under black_block_1. So we need to first clear brown_block_1 by moving black_block_1 and brown_block_2. Then, we can stack white on brown_block_1.

But how does this fit into the plan?

This adds more steps. Let's see.

Steps:

1. Unstack brown_block_2 from black_block_1.

2. stack brown_block_2 on black_block_2 (to satisfy constraint 4: black_block_2 not clear).

3. unstack black_block_1 from brown_block_1.

4. stack black_block_1 somewhere else (maybe on black_block_2's stack).

5. Now, brown_block_1 is clear and on table. Pick up brown_block_1 and put it down again. Wait, why? Because constraint C2 says if brown is on the table in any state, then white must be on top. So if we pick up brown_block_1 and put it back on the table (after step 5), then in that state (putdown), we have to stack white on it. Alternatively, if we leave brown_block_1 on the table (after step 4), then we need to stack white on it.

But the goal is to have brown on green. So we can't leave brown on the table. So during the plan, after moving black_block_1 and brown_block_2, brown_block_1 is on the table. At that point, we need to stack white on brown_block_1 to satisfy C2. But then we have to move white again to get brown_block_1 to green.

This complicates the plan. Let's think:

After steps 1-4, brown_block_1 is on table and clear. So we have to stack white on brown_block_1.

5. pickup white_block_1. But white has red on top. So first, we need to unstack red and green.

6. unstack green_block_1 from red_block_1.

7. putdown green_block_1.

8. unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1.

9. putdown red_block_1.

10. pickup white_block_1.

11. stack white_block_1 on brown_block_1.

Now, C2 is satisfied because after step 11, white is on brown. Then, we need to move brown_block_1 to green. But brown_block_1 has white on top. So we need to unstack white first.

12. unstack white_block_1 from brown_block_1.

13. putdown white_block_1.

14. pickup brown_block_1.

15. stack brown_block_1 on green_block_1.

This achieves the goal, but now in the final state, green is not clear (brown on it). So we need to handle C1: in this state or after, brown_block_1 must not be clear (so something on top) and red on black_block_1.

But in the final state, brown is clear. So we need to stack something on it. Let's see:

16. pickup white_block_1 (from table).

17. stack white_block_1 on brown_block_1.

Now, brown_block_1 is not clear. Also, red_block_1 is on the table (from step 9). So we need to move red to black_block_1.

18. pickup red_block_1.

19. stack red_block_1 on black_block_1.

But where is black_block_1? Earlier steps had it stacked on brown_block_2, which is on black_block_2. So black_block_1 is on brown_block_2. So stacking red on black_block_1 is possible if black_block_1 is clear. After step 4, black_block_1 was stacked on brown_block_2, which is on black_block_2. If that's the case, then black_block_1 is clear, so we can stack red on it.

So step 19: stack red_block_1 black_block_1.

Now, in the final state after step 19, brown_block_1 is on green, white is on brown_block_1 (making brown not clear), and red is on black_block_1. This satisfies C1: in the final state, green is not clear (due to brown), and in that state, brown is not clear (white on top) and red is on black_block_1. Also, constraint 6: red is on black_block_1 in this state.

But the problem is that the goal is to have brown on green, which is achieved in step 15. Steps 16-19 are additional steps that modify the state beyond the goal. But the problem requires that the final state is the goal. Therefore, this approach won't work.

Hmm, this is getting really complicated. Let's try to find a way to satisfy all constraints within the steps that achieve the goal.

Let's think differently. Maybe during the process of moving blocks to achieve the goal, we can also satisfy the constraints.

For example, when we unstack brown_block_2 from black_block_1 and stack it on black_block_2, this makes black_block_2 not clear, which helps with constraint 4.

Also, when we move black_block_1 to another place, perhaps onto red_block_1, but red is under green. No, red is under green, so we can't access it until green is moved.

Alternatively, stack black_block_1 on white_block_1. But white has red and green on top. So no.

Wait, after unstacking black_block_1 from brown_block_1, we need to place it somewhere. Suppose we stack it on black_block_2. But black_block_2 already has brown_block_2. So stacking black_block_1 on brown_block_2 (which is on black_block_2) would make a tower: black_block_2 → brown_block_2 → black_block_1. Then, later, we can stack red on black_block_1.

But let's see:

Steps:

1. unstack brown_block_2 from black_block_1.

2. stack brown_block_2 on black_block_2. Now, black_block_2 has brown_block_2 (not clear).

3. unstack black_block_1 from brown_block_1.

4. stack black_block_1 on brown_block_2. Now, brown_block_2 has black_block_1.

5. Now, brown_block_1 is clear on the table. Pick it up.

6. stack brown_block_1 on green_block_1. Goal achieved.

At this point, green is not clear (C1). So we need to ensure that in this state or later, brown_block_1 is not clear and red is on black_block_1.

In this state, brown_block_1 is clear. So we need to do more steps.

7. unstack brown_block_1 from green_block_1 (undoing the goal, which is not allowed).

Alternative: Before stacking brown_block_1 on green, stack something on it. But how?

Wait, maybe after step 5, instead of stacking brown_block_1 on green, we first stack another block on it. But the goal requires brown_block_1 to be on green. So perhaps we can stack brown on green, then stack another block on brown.

But that would require having a block available to stack on brown. Let's see what's available.

Available blocks: white, red, green, black_block_1, brown_block_2, black_block_2.

After step 4: black_block_1 is on brown_block_2 (on black_block_2). So black_block_1 is clear.

So steps:

5. pickup brown_block_1.

6. stack brown_block_1 on green_block_1.

7. pickup black_block_1 (from brown_block_2).

8. stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1.

Now, brown_block_1 is not clear (has black_block_1 on top). Also, need to have red on black_block_1. So:

9. unstack green_block_1 from red_block_1. Wait, green is under brown_block_1 and black_block_1. So to access red, we need to unstack black_block_1 and brown_block_1. But that would undo the goal.

This seems impossible. Therefore, perhaps the key is to have red_block_1 moved to black_block_1 before stacking brown_block_1 on green.

But how?

Let's try:

1. unstack brown_block_2 from black_block_1.

2. stack brown_block_2 on black_block_2.

3. unstack black_block_1 from brown_block_1.

4. stack black_block_1 on black_block_2 (now black_block_2 has brown_block_2 and black_block_1? No, you can't stack on a block that already has something. Each block can have only one block on top. Wait, no, blocks can have multiple blocks stacked, but each block can only have one block directly on top. Wait, in Blocksworld, each block can have at most one block on top. So when you stack a block on another, it becomes the top of that tower. So black_block_2 has brown_block_2 on top. If we stack black_block_1 on black_block_2, it's not possible because black_block_2 already has brown_block_2. So you can only stack on top of the top block. So to stack black_block_1 on black_block_2's stack, you have to stack it on brown_block_2, which is the top.

So step 4: stack black_block_1 on brown_block_2.

Now, brown_block_2 has black_block_1 on top.

5. Now, brown_block_1 is clear. Pick it up.

6. stack brown_block_1 on green_block_1. Now, green is not clear.

At this point, we need to satisfy C1: in this state or later, brown_block_1 must not be clear and red must be on black_block_1.

But in this state, red is still on white_block_1, under green. So to move red to black_block_1, we need to unstack green and red.

So steps:

7. unstack brown_block_1 from green_block_1 (but this would undo the goal).

No, can't do that. Therefore, the only way is to move red_block_1 before stacking brown_block_1 on green.

But how? Because red_block_1 is under green_block_1. So to move red, we have to first move green.

Alternative approach:

1. unstack green_block_1 from red_block_1.

2. putdown green_block_1.

3. unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1.

4. stack red_block_1 on black_block_1.

But black_block_1 is on brown_block_1, which is on the table. So we need to clear black_block_1 first. Which requires unstacking black_block_1 from brown_block_1. But black_block_1 has brown_block_2 on top.

So steps:

1. unstack brown_block_2 from black_block_1.

2. stack brown_block_2 on black_block_2.

3. unstack black_block_1 from brown_block_1.

4. stack black_block_1 on black_block_2.

5. Now, red can be stacked on black_block_1.

6. unstack green_block_1 from red_block_1.

7. putdown green_block_1.

8. unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1.

9. stack red_block_1 on black_block_1.

Now, red is on black_block_1, satisfying constraint 6. Then, proceed to move brown_block_1 to green.

10. pickup brown_block_1.

11. stack brown_block_1 on green_block_1.

Now, in the final state (step 11), green is not clear (brown on top). So for C1, in this state or after, brown_block_1 must not be clear and red is on black_block_1. In this state, red is on black_block_1, so that part is satisfied. But brown_block_1 is clear. So we need to stack something on it. For example:

12. pickup green_block_1 (from table).

13. stack green_block_1 on brown_block_1.

But then the goal is no longer satisfied because brown_block_1 is on green, and green is on brown. This creates a loop. Also, the goal requires brown_block_1 to be on green, not the other way around.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a different path.

Alternative plan:

- First, move red_block_1 to black_block_1, which satisfies constraint 6 and part of C1.

But red is under green. So steps:

1. unstack green_block_1 from red_block_1.

2. putdown green_block_1.

3. unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1.

4. stack red_block_1 on black_block_1.

But again, black_block_1 is under brown_block_2 and black_block_1 is on brown_block_1. So need to clear black_block_1 first.

This seems like a recurring issue. To move red to black_block_1, black_block_1 must be clear. So steps:

1. unstack brown_block_2 from black_block_1.

2. stack brown_block_2 on black_block_2.

3. unstack black_block_1 from brown_block_1.

4. stack black_block_1 on black_block_2.

5. Now, black_block_1 is clear.

6. unstack green_block_1 from red_block_1.

7. putdown green_block_1.

8. unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1.

9. stack red_block_1 on black_block_1.

Now, red is on black_block_1, which is on black_block_2. Now, we need to move brown_block_1 to green.

10. pickup brown_block_1.

11. stack brown_block_1 on green_block_1.

In this final state, green is not clear (brown on top), and red is on black_block_1. But brown_block_1 is clear. So to satisfy C1, we need to stack something on brown_block_1.

12. pickup green_block_1.

13. stack green_block_1 on brown_block_1.

But this makes the goal no longer true. So this is invalid.

Alternative: After step 11, stack something else on brown_block_1, but without disturbing the goal. Available blocks: white_block_1 (clear, since red was moved to black_block_1). So:

12. unstack red_block_1 from black_block_1. Wait, but red is on black_block_1, which is on black_block_2. To unstack red, need to be holding nothing.

12. unstack red_block_1 from black_block_1 → hold red.

13. stack red_block_1 on brown_block_1.

Now, brown_block_1 has red on top (not clear), and red is on brown_block_1. But the goal is still met (brown on green). This satisfies C1: in the final state, green is not clear (brown on it), and in that state or after, brown is not clear (red on top) and red is on black_block_1. Wait, but red is no longer on black_block_1. So this doesn't work.

This is really challenging. Let's consider that perhaps the plan needs to have brown_block_1 stacked on green, and then in the same state, have another block stacked on brown_block_1 and red on black_block_1. But how?

Maybe during the process:

After moving red to black_block_1 (step 9), then stack brown_block_1 on green (step 11). Then, pickup white_block_1 (which is clear), and stack it on brown_block_1.

Steps:

12. unstack white_block_1 from ... Wait, white_block_1 has red and green moved. Initially, white has red, which was moved to black_block_1. So after step 9, white_block_1 is clear. So:

12. pickup white_block_1.

13. stack white_block_1 on brown_block_1.

Now, in the final state (step 13), brown_block_1 is on green, white is on brown (so brown is not clear), and red is on black_block_1. This satisfies C1. Also, red on black_block_1 satisfies constraint 6. Constraint 4 is satisfied because black_block_2 has brown_block_2 and black_block_1, so not clear. Constraint 3: brown_block_2 is never on the table. Constraint 5: black_block_1 is never on the table. Constraint 7: red on black_block_1. Constraint 8: green is not on black_block_1 (which is true since green is on table). Constraint 9: red is not on black_block_1 at some point. Wait, in this plan, red is on black_block_1 in the final state, so constraint 9 requires that in some state, red is not on black_block_1. Which is true in earlier states (before step 9). So that's satisfied. Constraint 10: if green is not on black_block_1 (which is true in all states), then in that state or after, black_block_2 is not clear. Since in step 2, black_block_2 has brown_block_2, which makes it not clear, so that's satisfied. Constraint 11: at least one state where red is on brown_block_1. Not sure, but in this plan, red is on black_block_1. Hmm, no. So that's another constraint to address. Wait, looking back at the constraints:

Another constraint: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'red_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1'". So in this plan, red is never on brown_block_1. So this is a problem.

So we need to have at least one state where red is on brown_block_1. How to achieve that?

This adds another layer of complexity. Maybe after moving red to black_block_1, we need to move it again to brown_block_1.

Let me adjust the plan:

After step 9 (red on black_block_1):

10. unstack red_block_1 from black_block_1.

11. stack red_block_1 on brown_block_1.

Now, red is on brown_block_1. Then, move brown_block_1 to green.

But brown_block_1 has red on top. So we need to unstack red first.

12. unstack red_block_1 from brown_block_1.

13. putdown red_block_1.

14. pickup brown_block_1.

15. stack brown_block_1 on green_block_1.

16. pickup red_block_1.

17. stack red_block_1 on brown_block_1.

Now, in the final state, brown_block_1 is on green, red is on brown_block_1 (making brown not clear), and red is on brown_block_1. This satisfies C1 (green not clear, brown not clear, red on black_block_1 is not true here. Wait, red is on brown_block_1, not black_block_1. So this doesn't satisfy C1.

This is getting too convoluted. Maybe I need to start over and think of a different approach.

Alternative plan focusing on satisfying all constraints step by step.

Constraints to satisfy:

- C1: green not clear → brown not clear and red on black_block_1.

- C2: brown on table → white on brown.

- C3: brown_block_2 never on table.

- C4: At least once, black_block_2 not clear or white on green.

- C5: black_block_1 never on table.

- C6: At least once, red on black_block_1.

- C7: At least once, green not on black_block_1 (already true initially).

- C8: If green not on black_block_1, then black_block_2 not clear (already handled by C4 if black_block_2 is not clear).

- C9: At least once, red on brown_block_1.

- C10: At least once, red not on black_block_1.

- C11: If red not on black_block_1, then hold brown_block_2.

- C12: At least once, brown not on table.

- C13: If brown not on table, then earlier state holding green or white.

Let's try to hit each constraint.

C3: brown_block_2 never on table. Initially, it's on black_block_1. As long as we don't put it down, it's okay.

C5: black_block_1 never on table. Initially on brown_block_1. So must be stacked elsewhere.

C4: At least once, black_block_2 not clear or white on green. We can achieve this by stacking brown_block_2 on black_block_2.

C6: At least once, red on black_block_1.

C9: At least once, red on brown_block_1.

C10: At least once, red not on black_block_1. Since initially, red is on white, this is already true. Also, during the plan, if we move red to black_block_1 and then move it again, this is satisfied.

C11: If red is not on black_block_1, then hold brown_block_2. So in any state where red is not on black_block_1, either that state or later, we must be holding brown_block_2. For example, in the initial state, red is not on black_block_1. So during the plan, we need to have an action where we hold brown_block_2. Which happens when we unstack it.

C12: At least once, brown not on table. This will be true when we move brown_block_1 to green.

C13: If brown not on table, then earlier state holding green or white. So when we move brown_block_1 to green (not on table), there must have been a previous state where we held green or white. For example, when we unstack green to move red, we would hold green.

C2: If brown is on table (initially), then white must be on brown at some point. So we need to stack white on brown_block_1 during the plan.

This is a lot. Let's try to integrate all these.

Plan outline:

1. Unstack brown_block_2 from black_block_1. This allows us to hold brown_block_2, satisfying C11 when red is not on black_block_1 (initially).

2. Stack brown_block_2 on black_block_2. This satisfies C4 (black_block_2 not clear).

3. Unstack black_block_1 from brown_block_1. Now, black_block_1 is clear.

4. Stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1. Wait, no. Because we need to keep black_block_1 not on table. But stacking it back on brown_block_1 would keep it off the table.

Alternatively, stack black_block_1 on black_block_2's stack. Since brown_block_2 is on black_block_2, we can stack black_block_1 on brown_block_2.

5. Stack black_block_1 on brown_block_2.

Now, black_block_1 is on brown_block_2 (on black_block_2).

6. Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_1. Now holding green.

This satisfies C13 when we later move brown_block_1 (not on table) because we held green earlier.

7. Putdown green_block_1.

8. Unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1. Now holding red.

9. Stack red_block_1 on brown_block_1. This satisfies C9 (red on brown_block_1).

10. Unstack red_block_1 from brown_block_1. Now holding red.

11. Stack red_block_1 on black_block_1. This satisfies C6 (red on black_block_1).

12. Now, brown_block_1 is clear again. Pickup brown_block_1.

13. Stack brown_block_1 on green_block_1. This achieves the goal and satisfies C1 (green not clear). Now, in this state, C1 requires that either now or later, brown_block_1 is not clear and red is on black_block_1.

In this state, red is on black_block_1 (from step 11), so that part is satisfied. But brown_block_1 is clear. So need to stack something on it.

14. Pickup white_block_1 (now clear).

15. Stack white_block_1 on brown_block_1. This makes brown not clear.

Now, all constraints should be satisfied.

Let's verify:

C1: green not clear (yes, in final state). In this state, brown_block_1 is not clear (white on top) and red is on black_block_1. So satisfied.

C2: brown was on table initially, so white must be on brown at some point. In step 9, red is on brown_block_1, but white is on table. Later, in step 15, white is on brown_block_1. So satisfied.

C3: brown_block_2 never on table. Correct.

C4: black_block_2 has brown_block_2 and black_block_1. So not clear. Satisfied.

C5: black_block_1 never on table. Correct.

C6: red on black_block_1 in step 11. Satisfied.

C7: green not on black_block_1 in initial state. Satisfied.

C8: whenever green not on black_block_1 (all states), black_block_2 not clear after step 2. Satisfied.

C9: red on brown_block_1 in step 9. Satisfied.

C10: red not on black_block_1 in many states (initial, steps 9, 10, etc.). Satisfied.

C11: when red is not on black_block_1 (e.g., initial state), we held brown_block_2 in step 1. Satisfied.

C12: brown_block_1 not on table in steps 13-15. Satisfied.

C13: when brown_block_1 is not on table (steps 13-15), we held green in step 6. Satisfied.

This seems to work.

Now, let's write out the steps:

1. unstack brown_block_2 black_block_1
2. stack brown_block_2 black_block_2
3. unstack black_block_1 brown_block_1
4. stack black_block_1 brown_block_2
5. unstack green_block_1 red_block_1
6. putdown green_block_1
7. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
8. stack red_block_1 brown_block_1
9. unstack red_block_1 brown_block_1
10. stack red_block_1 black_block_1
11. pickup brown_block_1
12. stack brown_block_1 green_block_1
13. pickup white_block_1
14. stack white_block_1 brown_block_1

Check each action's preconditions:

1. unstack brown_block_2 black_block_1: brown_block_2 is on black_block_1 and clear, arm empty. Yes.

2. stack brown_block_2 black_block_2: holding brown_block_2, black_block_2 is clear. Yes.

3. unstack black_block_1 brown_block_1: black_block_1 is on brown_block_1 and clear, arm empty. Yes.

4. stack black_block_1 brown_block_2: holding black_block_1, brown_block_2 is clear (after step 2). Yes.

5. unstack green_block_1 red_block_1: green is on red, green is clear, arm empty. Yes.

6. putdown green_block_1: holding green. Yes.

7. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1: red is on white, red is clear (after step 5 and 6), arm empty. Yes.

8. stack red_block_1 brown_block_1: holding red, brown_block_1 is clear. Yes (brown_block_1 was on table, cleared after step 3 and 4).

9. unstack red_block_1 brown_block_1: red is on brown_block_1 and clear, arm empty. Yes.

10. stack red_block_1 black_block_1: holding red, black_block_1 is clear (stacked on brown_block_2, which is on black_block_2). After step 4, black_block_1 is on brown_block_2. So to stack red on black_block_1, we need black_block_1 to be clear. Since after step 4, black_block_1 is on brown_block_2 and nothing is on black_block_1. Yes.

11. pickup brown_block_1: brown_block_1 is on table, clear, arm empty. Yes.

12. stack brown_block_1 green_block_1: holding brown_block_1, green_block_1 is clear (after step 5 and 6, green is on table). Yes.

13. pickup white_block_1: white is on table, clear (red was moved in step 7). Yes.

14. stack white_block_1 brown_block_1: holding white, brown_block_1 is clear (after step 12). No, after step 12, brown_block_1 is on green_block_1 and clear. So yes, can stack white on it.

Wait, no. After step 12, brown_block_1 is on green_block_1 and clear (nothing on top). So step 13: pickup white_block_1 (clear). Step 14: stack white_block_1 on brown_block_1, which is clear. Yes.

This sequence should work and satisfy all constraints.
