Let's analyze the problem and determine a valid plan to achieve the goal.

The initial state is:
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- black_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- black_block_2 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2
- black_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is clear
- blue_block_1 is clear
- the robot arm is not holding any block

The goal is:
- the robot arm is holding blue_block_1

To achieve this goal, we need to perform the "unstack" action on blue_block_1, which is currently on top of black_block_2. Let's check if the preconditions for this action are met:

1. blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2 ✓
2. blue_block_1 is clear ✓
3. The robot arm is not holding any block ✓

All preconditions are met, so we can perform the action "unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2".

The effects of this action will be:
1. blue_block_1 is no longer on top of black_block_2
2. black_block_2 becomes clear
3. The robot arm is holding blue_block_1

This achieves our goal. So our plan is:

```
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2
```

Let me double-check this plan:

Step 1: Perform "unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2"
- Initial conditions: blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2, blue_block_1 is clear, the robot arm is not holding any block
- After action: blue_block_1 is no longer on top of black_block_2, black_block_2 is clear, the robot arm is holding blue_block_1

Final state: The robot arm is holding blue_block_1, which matches our goal.

So the plan is valid and optimal (it's the shortest possible plan to achieve the goal).
