Alright, let's break down this complex planning problem:

We have 7 blocks: orange_block_1, yellow_block_1, black_block_1, black_block_2, white_block_1, red_block_1, and blue_block_1.

Initial state:
1. orange_block_1 is on the table
2. yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
3. black_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
4. black_block_2 is on the table
5. white_block_1 is on the table
6. red_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
7. blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2
8. black_block_1 is clear
9. red_block_1 is clear
10. blue_block_1 is clear
11. The robotic arm is not holding any block

Goal:
- The robotic arm should be holding blue_block_1

Let's also enumerate the constraints that I need to satisfy:

1. At some point, blue_block_1 should have a block on top of it (not clear).
2. If blue_block_1 has a block on top of it, then there must be an earlier state where red_block_1 is on the table.
3. At some point, yellow_block_1 should be clear.
4. At some point, red_block_1 should be on top of orange_block_1.
5. At some point, yellow_block_1 should be on the table.
6. At some point, blue_block_1 should not be on top of white_block_1.
7. If blue_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, then yellow_block_1 should be clear at that state or later.
8. At some point, red_block_1 should be on the table.
9. At some point, either black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1 or black_block_1 has a block on top of it.
10. At some point, black_block_1 should not be on the table.
11. If black_block_1 is not on the table, then white_block_1 should be on top of blue_block_1 at that state or later.
12. At some point, yellow_block_1 should have a block on top of it.
13. If yellow_block_1 has a block on top of it, then the robotic arm should be holding black_block_1 at that state or later.
14. At some point, the robotic arm should be holding yellow_block_1 and red_block_1 should have a block on top of it.

These constraints create a fairly intricate planning problem. Let's start by thinking about how to approach it.

The main goal is to end with holding blue_block_1. But we need to satisfy all these constraints along the way.

One approach is to trace a path through the constraints, ensuring we hit all of them while moving towards the goal. 

Let's start with the fact that to hold blue_block_1, we need to first unstack it from black_block_2, but before that, we need to ensure that several constraints are met.

To satisfy constraint 1, we need to place a block on top of blue_block_1 at some point before unstacking it. Before doing that, according to constraint 2, we need to have red_block_1 on the table.

Let's try to sketch a plan, considering the constraints:

1. First, we need to get red_block_1 on the table. Initially, it's on top of white_block_1. We unstack it and put it down.
   - This satisfies constraint 8: "red_block_1 is on the table"

2. Now, we can move a block on top of blue_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 1). Let's say we'll use one of the clear blocks, say black_block_1.
   - So, we unstack black_block_1 from yellow_block_1 and stack it on blue_block_1.
   - This also means yellow_block_1 is now clear, satisfying constraint 3.

3. We then need to satisfy constraint 4: "red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1". But orange_block_1 currently has yellow_block_1 on top of it, which in turn has no block on top (black_block_1 has been moved).
   - We unstack yellow_block_1 from orange_block_1 and put it on the table.
   - This satisfies constraint 5: "yellow_block_1 is on the table"
   - Now, we pick up red_block_1 from the table and stack it on orange_block_1.
   - This satisfies constraint 4.

4. Constraint 6: "blue_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is already satisfied, as blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2 initially.
   - And since yellow_block_1 is already clear, constraint 7 is also satisfied.

5. For constraint 9, we need either black_block_2 on top of red_block_1 or black_block_1 to have a block on top of it. Given our actions so far, black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1 and doesn't have a block on top of it.
   - So, we would need to move some block (like white_block_1) on top of black_block_1. However, this would make it difficult to then unstack blue_block_1 without violating other constraints.
   - Alternatively, we could move black_block_2 on top of red_block_1. For this, we first need to unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2, which would make black_block_2 clear. Then, we can stack black_block_2 on red_block_1.

But this means we are unstacking blue_block_1 from black_block_2 relatively early, which could be tricky for the remaining constraints.

Let's step back and reconsider our approach. Rather than working forward, let's try working backwards from the goal.

The goal is to be holding blue_block_1. To do this, we need to unstack blue_block_1 from whatever block it's on (which could change throughout the plan). Before unstacking, blue_block_1 must be clear.

Let's think about the constraints that deal with blue_block_1:
- Constraint 1 says blue_block_1 should have a block on top of it at some point.
- Constraint 6 says blue_block_1 should not be on top of white_block_1 at some point.
- Constraint 11 says that if black_block_1 is not on the table, white_block_1 should be on top of blue_block_1.

Given these constraints, it seems like black_block_1 will be used to satisfy both constraint 10 (black_block_1 not on the table) and constraint 11 (white_block_1 on top of blue_block_1). This suggests we're going to move white_block_1 on top of blue_block_1 at some point.

But let's also consider the last constraint, which says at some point, we should be holding yellow_block_1 and red_block_1 should have a block on top of it. This is a bit tricky, as it specifies a specific configuration.

Let me try to sketch a more detailed plan, step by step:

Starting from the initial state:
```
orange_block_1 (on table)
    yellow_block_1
        black_block_1 (clear)
black_block_2 (on table)
    blue_block_1 (clear)
white_block_1 (on table)
    red_block_1 (clear)
```

1. First, let's address constraint 1, which says blue_block_1 should have a block on top of it at some point. According to constraint 2, before this happens, red_block_1 should be on the table. 
   - We unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1 and put it on the table.
   ```
   orange_block_1 (on table)
       yellow_block_1
           black_block_1 (clear)
   black_block_2 (on table)
       blue_block_1 (clear)
   white_block_1 (on table, clear)
   red_block_1 (on table, clear)
   ```

2. Now, to satisfy constraint 1, we pick a clear block, say white_block_1, and stack it on blue_block_1.
   ```
   orange_block_1 (on table)
       yellow_block_1
           black_block_1 (clear)
   black_block_2 (on table)
       blue_block_1
           white_block_1 (clear)
   red_block_1 (on table, clear)
   ```

3. For constraint 10, black_block_1 should not be on the table at some point. Given constraint 11, if black_block_1 is not on the table, white_block_1 should be on top of blue_block_1. We already have white_block_1 on top of blue_block_1 from step 2, so we're good for constraint 11 if we move black_block_1. However, initially black_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, not directly on the table. But the constraint says black_block_1 should not be on the table, which is already satisfied. So I don't think we need to change anything for constraints 10 and 11.

4. For constraint 12, yellow_block_1 should have a block on top of it. Currently, it does have black_block_1 on top of it, so this is satisfied. 

5. According to constraint 13, if yellow_block_1 has a block on top of it, we should be holding black_block_1. So, we unstack black_block_1 from yellow_block_1.
   ```
   orange_block_1 (on table)
       yellow_block_1 (clear)
   black_block_2 (on table)
       blue_block_1
           white_block_1 (clear)
   red_block_1 (on table, clear)
   holding black_block_1
   ```

6. For constraint 3, yellow_block_1 should be clear at some point. We just achieved this in step 5.

7. For constraint 5, yellow_block_1 should be on the table at some point. We unstack yellow_block_1 from orange_block_1 and put it on the table. First, we need to put down black_block_1.
   ```
   orange_block_1 (on table, clear)
       yellow_block_1 (clear)
   black_block_2 (on table)
       blue_block_1
           white_block_1 (clear)
   red_block_1 (on table, clear)
   black_block_1 (on table, clear)
   ```
   Now we can unstack yellow_block_1 and put it on the table.
   ```
   orange_block_1 (on table, clear)
   yellow_block_1 (on table, clear)
   black_block_2 (on table)
       blue_block_1
           white_block_1 (clear)
   red_block_1 (on table, clear)
   black_block_1 (on table, clear)
   ```

8. For constraint 4, red_block_1 should be on top of orange_block_1. We pick up red_block_1 and stack it on orange_block_1.
   ```
   orange_block_1 (on table)
       red_block_1 (clear)
   yellow_block_1 (on table, clear)
   black_block_2 (on table)
       blue_block_1
           white_block_1 (clear)
   black_block_1 (on table, clear)
   ```

9. For constraint 9, either black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1 or black_block_1 has a block on top of it. Let's move black_block_1 on top of red_block_1.
   ```
   orange_block_1 (on table)
       red_block_1
           black_block_1 (clear)
   yellow_block_1 (on table, clear)
   black_block_2 (on table)
       blue_block_1
           white_block_1 (clear)
   ```

10. For constraint 14, at some point, we should be holding yellow_block_1 and red_block_1 should have a block on top of it. red_block_1 already has black_block_1 on top of it from the previous step, so we just need to pick up yellow_block_1.
    ```
    orange_block_1 (on table)
        red_block_1
            black_block_1 (clear)
    black_block_2 (on table)
        blue_block_1
            white_block_1 (clear)
    holding yellow_block_1
    ```

11. Now, we need to get to our goal: holding blue_block_1. We'll first need to put down yellow_block_1 and then unstack white_block_1 from blue_block_1, and then unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2.
    ```
    orange_block_1 (on table)
        red_block_1
            black_block_1 (clear)
    black_block_2 (on table)
        blue_block_1
            white_block_1 (clear)
    yellow_block_1 (on table, clear)
    ```
    We now unstack white_block_1.
    ```
    orange_block_1 (on table)
        red_block_1
            black_block_1 (clear)
    black_block_2 (on table)
        blue_block_1 (clear)
    yellow_block_1 (on table, clear)
    holding white_block_1
    ```
    We put down white_block_1.
    ```
    orange_block_1 (on table)
        red_block_1
            black_block_1 (clear)
    black_block_2 (on table)
        blue_block_1 (clear)
    yellow_block_1 (on table, clear)
    white_block_1 (on table, clear)
    ```
    Finally, we unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2, achieving our goal.
    ```
    orange_block_1 (on table)
        red_block_1
            black_block_1 (clear)
    black_block_2 (on table, clear)
    yellow_block_1 (on table, clear)
    white_block_1 (on table, clear)
    holding blue_block_1
    ```

But wait, I realized I made a mistake. I said moving black_block_1 off the table satisfies constraint 10, but black_block_1 was already off the table initially (it's on top of yellow_block_1). So currently, all the constraints might not be satisfied.

Let me re-read the constraints and verify:

1. At some point, blue_block_1 should have a block on top of it. We satisfy this by placing white_block_1 on top of blue_block_1.
2. If blue_block_1 has a block on top of it, then there must be an earlier state where red_block_1 is on the table. We unstack red_block_1 and place it on the table before stacking white_block_1 on blue_block_1.
3. At some point, yellow_block_1 should be clear. We achieve this when we unstack black_block_1 from yellow_block_1.
4. At some point, red_block_1 should be on top of orange_block_1. We achieve this by stacking red_block_1 on orange_block_1.
5. At some point, yellow_block_1 should be on the table. We achieve this by unstacking yellow_block_1 from orange_block_1 and placing it on the table.
6. At some point, blue_block_1 should not be on top of white_block_1. This seems to be always satisfied since we never place blue_block_1 on top of white_block_1 in our plan.
7. If blue_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, then yellow_block_1 should be clear at that state or later. yellow_block_1 is clear from after we unstack black_block_1 from it, which is after blue_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 (constraint 6), so this is satisfied.
8. At some point, red_block_1 should be on the table. We achieve this when we unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1 and place it on the table.
9. At some point, either black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1 or black_block_1 has a block on top of it. We achieve this by stacking black_block_1 on top of red_block_1.
10. At some point, black_block_1 should not be on the table. Initially, black_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, not on the table, so this is satisfied.
11. If black_block_1 is not on the table, then white_block_1 should be on top of blue_block_1 at that state or later. We satisfy this by stacking white_block_1 on top of blue_block_1.
12. At some point, yellow_block_1 should have a block on top of it. Initially, yellow_block_1 has black_block_1 on top of it, so this is satisfied.
13. If yellow_block_1 has a block on top of it, then the robotic arm should be holding black_block_1 at that state or later. We satisfy this by unstacking black_block_1 later in the plan.
14. At some point, the robotic arm should be holding yellow_block_1 and red_block_1 should have a block on top of it. We achieve this by picking up yellow_block_1 after black_block_1 is on top of red_block_1.

I believe our plan satisfies all the constraints. Let's formalize the plan:

1. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
2. putdown red_block_1
3. pickup white_block_1
4. stack white_block_1 blue_block_1
5. unstack black_block_1 yellow_block_1
6. putdown black_block_1
7. unstack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1
8. putdown yellow_block_1
9. pickup red_block_1
10. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1
11. pickup black_block_1
12. stack black_block_1 red_block_1
13. pickup yellow_block_1
14. putdown yellow_block_1
15. unstack white_block_1 blue_block_1
16. putdown white_block_1
17. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2

Let's double-check to make sure this satisfies all constraints:

Checking constraint 1: Does blue_block_1 have a block on top of it at some point? Yes, after step 4, white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1.

Checking constraint 2: If blue_block_1 has a block on top of it, is there an earlier state where red_block_1 is on the table? Yes, after step 2, red_block_1 is on the table, which is before step 4 where blue_block_1 has a block on top of it.

Checking constraint 3: Is yellow_block_1 clear at some point? Yes, after step 5, yellow_block_1 is clear when black_block_1 is removed from it.

Checking constraint 4: Is red_block_1 on top of orange_block_1 at some point? Yes, after step 10, red_block_1 is stacked on orange_block_1.

Checking constraint 5: Is yellow_block_1 on the table at some point? Yes, after step 8, yellow_block_1 is put down on the table.

Checking constraint 6: Is blue_block_1 not on top of white_block_1 at some point? Yes, at no point in the plan is blue_block_1 on top of white_block_1.

Checking constraint 7: If blue_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, is yellow_block_1 clear at that state or later? Yes, since blue_block_1 is never on top of white_block_1, and yellow_block_1 is clear after step 5, this constraint is satisfied.

Checking constraint 8: Is red_block_1 on the table at some point? Yes, after step 2, red_block_1 is put down on the table.

Checking constraint 9: Is either black_block_2 on top of red_block_1 or black_block_1 not clear at some point? Yes, after step 12, black_block_1 is stacked on red_block_1, which means red_block_1 has a block on top of it.

Checking constraint 10: Is black_block_1 not on the table at some point? Yes, initially black_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, and later it's on top of red_block_1 after step 12.

Checking constraint 11: If black_block_1 is not on the table, is white_block_1 on top of blue_block_1 at that state or later? Yes, after step 4, white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1, and black_block_1 is not on the table throughout the plan.

Checking constraint 12: Is there a block on top of yellow_block_1 at some point? Yes, initially, black_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1.

Checking constraint 13: If there's a block on top of yellow_block_1, are we holding black_block_1 at that state or later? Yes, initially, black_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, and later, after step 5, we're holding black_block_1.

Checking constraint 14: Are we holding yellow_block_1 and is there a block on top of red_block_1 at some point? Yes, after step 13, we're holding yellow_block_1, and at that point, black_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 (from step 12).

It looks like our plan satisfies all the constraints. However, a more careful reading of constraint 14 shows it requires that at a single state, both conditions should be true: we are holding yellow_block_1 AND red_block_1 has a block on top of it. Our plan does achieve this, so it's fine.

One thing to note is that in our plan, we move yellow_block_1 off of orange_block_1 and onto the table, and then later pick it up and put it down again. It might be more efficient to skip the intermediate placement of yellow_block_1 on the table and directly hold onto it, like:

1. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
2. putdown red_block_1
3. pickup white_block_1
4. stack white_block_1 blue_block_1
5. unstack black_block_1 yellow_block_1
6. putdown black_block_1
7. unstack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1  # Now holding yellow_block_1
8. pickup red_block_1  # But we're still holding yellow_block_1, which is a violation!

Actually, I can't optimize it that way, because I can only hold one block at a time. So the original plan is the most efficient.

Wait, there's an issue at steps 7-8. These steps assume yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1, but this is only true in the initial state. In the plan, we're removing black_block_1 from yellow_block_1 at step 5, but yellow_block_1 is still on top of orange_block_1. So steps 7-8 should be correct.

But oh, it seems I made a mistake in describing the world states in the middle of the planning. Let me re-trace the plan:

1. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
   ```

        blue_block_1
            white_block_1 (clear)
    holding yellow_block_1
    ```

Now, at this state, we're holding yellow_block_1 and red_block_1 has a block on top of it, satisfying constraint 14.

14. putdown yellow_block_1
    ```
    orange_block_1 (on table)
        red_block_1
            black_block_1 (clear)
    black_block_2 (on table)
        blue_block_1
            white_block_1 (clear)
    yellow_block_1 (on table, clear)
    not holding anything
    ```

15. unstack white_block_1 blue_block_1
    ```
    orange_block_1 (on table)
        red_block_1
            black_block_1 (clear)
    black_block_2 (on table)
        blue_block_1 (clear)
    yellow_block_1 (on table, clear)
    holding white_block_1
    ```

16. putdown white_block_1
    ```
    orange_block_1 (on table)
        red_block_1
            black_block_1 (clear)
    black_block_2 (on table)
        blue_block_1 (clear)
    yellow_block_1 (on table, clear)
    white_block_1 (on table, clear)
    not holding anything
    ```

17. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2
    ```
    orange_block_1 (on table)
        red_block_1
            black_block_1 (clear)
    black_block_2 (on table, clear)
    yellow_block_1 (on table, clear)
    white_block_1 (on table, clear)
    holding blue_block_1
    ```

This matches the goal: holding blue_block_1. I believe the plan is valid and satisfies all the constraints. Here's the finalized sequence of actions:

1. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
2. putdown red_block_1
3. pickup white_block_1
4. stack white_block_1 blue_block_1
5. unstack black_block_1 yellow_block_1
6. putdown black_block_1
7. unstack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1
8. putdown yellow_block_1
9. pickup red_block_1
10. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1
11. pickup black_block_1
12. stack black_block_1 red_block_1
13. pickup yellow_block_1
14. putdown yellow_block_1
15. unstack white_block_1 blue_block_1
16. putdown white_block_1
17. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2
