```
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2
```
``` 

The plan consists of a single action: unstacking blue_block_1 from black_block_2. This action is valid because:

1. blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2 in the initial state
2. blue_block_1 is clear (no blocks on top of it)
3. The robotic arm is initially empty

After performing this action, the robotic arm is holding blue_block_1, which directly achieves the goal state. No additional actions are needed since this single action satisfies the goal condition.
