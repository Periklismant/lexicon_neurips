Okay, let's see. The problem is to get the robotic arm to hold the blue_block_1. The initial state has blue_block_1 on top of black_block_2, which is on the table. Also, blue_block_1 is clear. So to pick up blue_block_1, I need to perform the unstack action, right? Because it's on top of another block. But wait, the unstack action requires that the block to be unstacked (blue_block_1) is clear, which it is. Also, the arm must not be holding anything. So the first step should be unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2. That would make the arm hold blue_block_1, which is the goal. Let me check the preconditions again. Unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2: yes, blue_block_1 is on black_block_2, it's clear, and the arm is empty. So that's the only action needed. The plan would just be that one action. But wait, does any other action interfere here? Let me make sure. The initial state says blue_block_1 is on black_block_2 and clear. So the unstack action is valid. Then after unstacking, the arm is holding blue_block_1, which is exactly the goal. So the optimal plan is just that single action.
