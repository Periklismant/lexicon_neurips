Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld problem step by step. The goal is to have the robotic arm holding the blue_block_1, but there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy along the way. Hmm, I need to make sure all those constraints are met in the plan. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the goal.

Initial State:
- orange_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top, then black_block_1 on yellow.
- black_block_2 is on the table with blue_block_1 on top.
- white_block_1 is on the table with red_block_1 on top.
- All top blocks (black_block_1, red_block_1, blue_block_1) are clear.
- The arm is empty.

Goal:
- Hold blue_block_1.

Constraints:
There are several constraints here. Let me list them out to keep track:

1. At some state, blue_block_1 has a block on top (not clear).
2. If blue_block_1 is not clear, then earlier there must be a state where red_block_1 is on the table.
3. Yellow_block_1 must be clear at some point.
4. Red_block_1 must be on orange_block_1 at some state.
5. Yellow_block_1 must be on the table at some state.
6. Blue_block_1 is not on white_block_1 at some state.
7. If blue_block_1 is not on white_block_1 in state s, then yellow_block_1 must be clear in s or after.
8. Red_block_1 must be on the table at some state.
9. Either black_block_2 is on red_block_1 or black_block_1 is not clear at some state.
10. Black_block_1 is not on the table at some state.
11. If black_block_1 is not on the table in s, then white_block_1 must be on blue_block_1 in s or after.
12. Yellow_block_1 is not clear (has a block on top) at some state.
13. If yellow_block_1 is not clear in s, then the arm must hold black_block_1 in s or after.
14. At some state, the arm is holding yellow_block_1 and red_block_1 is not clear.

Wow, that's a lot. Let's start by figuring out how to get blue_block_1 into the hand. Since blue_block_1 is currently on black_block_2, which is on the table. To pick it up, I need to unstack it from black_block_2. But wait, the preconditions for unstack are that the block to unstack (blue_block_1) is clear, which it is. Also, the arm must be empty. So first action could be unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2. Then the arm is holding blue_block_1, which achieves the goal. But wait, there are constraints to satisfy. So even though that's the direct path, we need to make sure all constraints are met in the plan.

But maybe the plan can't be that short because of the constraints. Let's see.

Let's check the constraints one by one and see how they can be satisfied.

First, constraint 1: blue_block_1 must be not clear in some state. Currently, blue is on black_block_2 and is clear. To make it not clear, we need to stack something on top. But the goal is to have the arm holding blue_block_1. So perhaps before picking up blue_block_1, we need to put another block on it, but then unstack that block again. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe after picking up blue, we put it down and stack something else on it. But the goal is to end up holding blue. So maybe we need to do some steps where blue is under another block at some point.

But let's see. Suppose we first unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2. Then we have blue in hand. If we put it down again, but then stack another block on it. Then blue would not be clear. But then we need to pick it up again. Let's see:

1. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2 → hold blue
2. putdown blue_block_1 → blue on table, clear. Not helpful.
Wait, no. If we stack it somewhere else. Alternatively, stack something else on blue after putting it down. But maybe that's not necessary. Let's see other constraints.

Constraint 2: if blue is not clear (which we need to achieve), then earlier red_block_1 must be on the table. So red_block_1 is initially on white_block_1. So to have red on the table, we need to unstack red from white. But to do that, red must be clear. It is, so we can unstack red and put it on the table. Then, if we stack something on blue, that would satisfy constraint 2 if red was on the table before.

But let's see the order. Let's think about steps that involve moving red_block_1 to the table, which would satisfy constraint 8 as well (since red must be on the table at some state). Also, constraint 4 requires red to be on orange_block_1 at some state. So red needs to be on the table at some point (constraint 8) and on orange (constraint 4). So perhaps we need to move red from white to table, then later stack it on orange.

But let's think: the plan needs to include red being on the table and also on orange. So steps would be:

- unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1 (precondition: red is clear, which it is)
- putdown red_block_1 → now red is on table (satisfies constraint 8)
- then later, stack red_block_1 on orange_block_1 (satisfies constraint 4)

But stacking red on orange requires that orange is clear. Initially, orange has yellow_block_1 on top. So we need to move yellow_block_1 first.

But yellow is under black_block_1. So the stack is orange -> yellow -> black_block_1. To get to yellow, we need to unstack black_block_1 from yellow, then unstack yellow from orange.

So steps for that:

- unstack black_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (pre: black_block_1 is clear, which it is)
- putdown black_block_1 → now yellow is clear (satisfies constraint 3)
- unstack yellow_block_1 from orange_block_1 → now orange is clear
- putdown yellow_block_1 → yellow on table (satisfies constraint 5)
- Then stack red_block_1 on orange_block_1 (satisfies constraint 4)

But this is getting a bit involved. Let's see how all these steps can fit in with the main goal of holding blue_block_1.

Also, constraint 9: either black_block_2 is on red_block_1 or black_block_1 is not clear. So need to have either of those at some point.

Constraint 10: black_block_1 is not on the table. Currently, black_block_1 is on yellow, which is on orange. So if we move black_block_1 to the table, then it's on the table. But the constraint is that it's not on the table at some state. Wait, no: the constraint says "black_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in at least one state. Initially, black_block_1 is on yellow, not on the table. So that condition is already true in the initial state. So constraint 10 is already satisfied. Wait, no: the initial state says "black_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1". So black_block_1 is not on the table. So constraint 10 is already satisfied in the initial state. But the problem says the constraints must hold in the plan. Wait, but the problem says "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints". So perhaps the plan must include a state where black_block_1 is not on the table. Since in the initial state, it's not on the table, but as the plan progresses, if we put it on the table, then in some states it's on the table. But the constraint requires that in at least one state of the plan, it's not on the table. Since the initial state is part of the plan's states, then the initial state already satisfies that. But perhaps the problem counts the initial state as part of the states. However, the problem says "must hold in at least one state". So if the initial state meets that, then it's already satisfied, but perhaps during the plan's execution, the block may be moved, but as long as in some state (including initial) it's not on the table, that's okay. So maybe we don't need to do anything for constraint 10.

Similarly, constraint 12: yellow_block_1 must not be clear (i.e., has a block on top) at some state. Initially, yellow_block_1 has black_block_1 on top, so it's not clear. So the initial state satisfies that. So constraint 12 is satisfied. But then constraint 13 says that if in some state s, yellow_block_1 is not clear (which is the case in the initial state), then in s or after, the arm must hold black_block_1. So in the initial state, yellow is not clear. So the arm must hold black_block_1 at some point after that. So in the plan, the arm needs to hold black_block_1 at some point. Which would happen if we unstack it from yellow.

So moving on.

Constraint 14: At some state, the arm is holding yellow_block_1 and red_block_1 is not clear. So we need to have a state where the arm is holding yellow_block_1 and red_block_1 has a block on top (since red is not clear). Currently, red is on white and clear. To make red not clear, we need to stack something on it. But how?

Wait, but constraint 4 requires red to be on orange_block_1 at some state. If we stack red on orange, then red is on orange. But in that case, red is clear (assuming nothing is on top). So to make red not clear, we need to stack something on top of red. But maybe during the plan, after moving red to orange, we can stack something else on it. But let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps when red is on white, we stack something on it. But initially, red is on white and is clear. If we unstack red and put it on the table, then stack something else on white, but that doesn't affect red. Hmm.

But constraint 14 requires that while holding yellow_block_1, red is not clear. So perhaps during the plan, after moving red to orange, then stacking something on top of red (on orange), and then holding yellow_block_1.

But let's think step by step.

Let me outline the main steps needed:

1. Achieve the goal: hold blue_block_1. To do that, unstack blue from black_block_2. But we need to satisfy all constraints first.

But perhaps we can unstack blue at the end. However, the constraints require that during the plan, certain conditions are met. Let's see.

First, constraints that need to be met during the plan:

- Constraint 1: blue_block_1 is not clear. So before the final step of picking up blue, maybe we need to have something on top of blue. But then we need to unstack that block first.

For example:

- stack another block on blue_block_1 (so blue is not clear)
- then unstack that block to pick up blue.

But how?

Alternatively, after picking up blue, put it down and stack something on it. But the goal is to have the arm holding blue at the end. So maybe the steps would be:

1. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2 → hold blue.
2. Putdown blue_block_1 → blue is on table, clear.
3. Pickup some block (like red) and stack it on blue. Now blue is not clear.
4. Unstack that block from blue and put it somewhere else.
5. Then pickup blue again to achieve the goal.

But this adds steps. But maybe necessary to satisfy constraint 1.

But let's check other constraints.

Constraint 7: If blue is not on white_block_1 in some state s, then yellow must be clear in s or after. So we need to ensure that whenever blue is not on white, yellow is clear at some point after. But blue starts on black_block_2 (not on white), and in the initial state, yellow is not clear. So to satisfy this, whenever blue is not on white, which is initially true, we need yellow to be clear at that state or after. In the initial state, yellow is not clear, so we need to make sure that after that state, yellow becomes clear. Which we can do by unstacking black_block_1 from yellow, making yellow clear. So that's part of the steps.

Now, let's start building the plan step by step.

First, the initial state:

- orange_block_1 (table) with yellow on top and black_block_1 on yellow.
- black_block_2 (table) with blue on top.
- white_block_1 (table) with red on top.
- All top blocks are clear.

Constraints that need to be met:

- Constraint 3: yellow must be clear at some state. So unstack black_block_1 from yellow, then yellow is clear.

- Constraint 5: yellow must be on the table. So after unstacking black_block_1, we can unstack yellow from orange and put it on the table.

- Constraint 4: red on orange. So we need to move red from white to orange. But orange must be clear. So first, unstack yellow from orange (after removing black_block_1), then put yellow on table. Then stack red on orange.

- Constraint 8: red on table. So unstack red from white and put it on table.

But we need red to be on table and also on orange. So perhaps first move red to table (satisfy constraint 8), then move it to orange (satisfy constraint 4).

But how to do that.

Also, constraint 14: need to hold yellow_block_1 while red is not clear. So after red is on orange, stack something on red to make it not clear. Then hold yellow.

So possible steps:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from yellow_block_1. Now holding black_block_1. This satisfies constraint 13 (since yellow was not clear, and now we're holding black_block_1). Also, after this, yellow is clear (satisfies constraint 3).

2. Putdown black_block_1 on table.

3. Unstack yellow_block_1 from orange_block_1. Now holding yellow. Putdown yellow on table (satisfies constraint 5).

4. Now, orange_block_1 is clear. Unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1 (it's clear). Now holding red. Putdown red on table (satisfies constraint 8).

5. Pickup red_block_1 again (since we need to stack it on orange_block_1). Stack red on orange_block_1. Now red is on orange (satisfies constraint 4). Now, red is clear.

6. To make red not clear (for constraint 14), stack something on red. For example, stack black_block_1 on red_block_1. But need to have black_block_1 clear. Since we put it down earlier, it's on the table and clear. So:

6. Pickup black_block_1 and stack it on red_block_1. Now red is not clear.

7. Now, to satisfy constraint 14, we need to hold yellow_block_1 while red is not clear. Since yellow is on the table, we can pick it up. So:

7. Pickup yellow_block_1. At this point, red is not clear (has black_block_1 on top). So this step satisfies constraint 14.

8. Then putdown yellow_block_1 somewhere, maybe back on orange, but not sure yet.

But let's check other constraints.

Constraint 9: Either black_block_2 on red_block_1 or black_block_1 not clear. Currently, black_block_1 is on red_block_1, making red not clear and black_block_1 not clear. So black_block_1 is not clear (since it's on red). So that satisfies the second part of constraint 9. So that's covered.

Constraint 6: blue_block_1 is not on white_block_1 at some state. Initially, blue is on black_block_2, so not on white. So that's already true. But the constraint says it must hold in at least one state. So initial state satisfies that. But maybe during the plan, blue is moved to white, but then moved back. But the constraint is satisfied as long as there's a state where blue is not on white. Since the initial state is part of the plan's states, that's covered. However, the problem says "at least one state in the plan". So if during the plan, blue is moved to white, but then moved back, we need to ensure that there's a state (like the initial) where it's not on white. So perhaps no action needed here.

But constraint 7 says that if in any state s, blue is not on white, then yellow must be clear in s or after. Since blue is not on white in the initial state, which is s0, then in s0 or after, yellow must be clear. In the initial state, yellow is not clear (has black_block_1 on top), but after step 1, we unstack black_block_1, making yellow clear. So that's satisfied.

Now, back to the plan.

At step 7, after picking up yellow_block_1, we need to do something with it. Maybe stack it on something. But constraint 14 is already satisfied here: holding yellow and red is not clear.

Now, let's get back to the goal: holding blue_block_1. Currently, blue is on black_block_2. To pick it up, we need to unstack it. But to satisfy constraint 1, blue must not be clear at some state. So perhaps after unstacking blue, we need to stack something on it. But the goal is to end up holding blue. So maybe:

8. Stack yellow_block_1 on blue_block_1. Wait, blue is currently on black_block_2. To stack yellow on blue, blue must be clear. But blue is on black_block_2, which is clear. So after unstacking blue, we could stack it somewhere else, then stack another block on it. But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, after step 7, when we have yellow in hand, maybe we can stack it on blue. But blue is on black_block_2. To stack yellow on blue, blue must be clear. Currently, blue is on black_block_2, which is on the table. So blue is clear. So yes:

8. Stack yellow_block_1 on blue_block_1. Now blue is not clear (satisfies constraint 1). Now, in this state, blue is not clear, so constraint 2 requires that red was on the table in an earlier state. Which it was in step 4 when we put red on the table. So that's satisfied.

Then, to get blue into hand, we need to unstack yellow from blue. But yellow is on blue. So:

9. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1. Now holding yellow. Then putdown yellow.

10. Now, blue is clear again. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2. Now holding blue, achieving the goal.

But wait, the goal is to have the arm holding blue. So step 10 would be the final action. But let's check if all constraints are met.

Constraints check:

1. Blue is not clear in step 8 (after stacking yellow on it). Satisfied.

2. In step 8, blue is not clear. Previous state where red is on table: step 4. Satisfied.

3. Yellow is clear after step 1. Satisfied.

4. Red is on orange in step 5. Satisfied.

5. Yellow is on table in step 3. Satisfied.

6. Blue is not on white in initial state. Satisfied.

7. Whenever blue is not on white (which is always, except if moved there), then yellow must be clear after. Since blue is never on white, and after step 1, yellow is clear. Satisfied.

8. Red is on table in step 4. Satisfied.

9. black_block_1 is not clear (since it's on red in step 6). Satisfied.

10. Black_block_1 is not on the table (it's on red_block_1). Satisfied.

11. If black_block_1 is not on the table (which is true from step 6 onward), then white must be on blue. Wait, the constraint says: if black_block_1 is not on the table in state s, then white_block_1 must be on top of blue_block_1 in s or after. So after step 6, black_block_1 is on red, not on table. So in the plan, we need to have white_block_1 on blue_block_1 at some point after step 6. But currently, white_block_1 is on the table with red moved to orange. So we need to stack white_block_1 on blue_block_1. But white is on the table, clear. So:

After step 8, we have blue on black_block_2 with yellow on top. Then after step 9, yellow is in hand. Then step 10 is unstacking blue. Wait, no. Let me re-examine.

Wait, after step 8, blue has yellow on top. Then step 9 is unstack yellow from blue, which requires that yellow is clear (which it is, since it's on top of blue). Then step 9: unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1. Now holding yellow. Then putdown yellow somewhere. Then step 10: unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2. But after step 8, blue is under yellow. After step 9, blue is clear again. So unstacking blue is possible.

But in this case, white_block_1 is still on the table. So to satisfy constraint 11: after step 6 (black_block_1 not on table), we need white_block_1 on blue_block_1 at some point. But in our current plan, white is never on blue. So we need to add steps to stack white on blue.

So perhaps after step 10, when we have blue in hand (the goal), but we need to put it down and stack white on it, then unstack again. But that would make the plan longer. But the goal is to end up holding blue, so we need to do that last.

Alternative approach: after step 6 (black_block_1 on red), we need to stack white on blue. Let's adjust the plan.

Continuing from step 7: we have yellow in hand. Let's proceed:

7. After stacking black_block_1 on red (step 6), we need to stack white on blue.

But white is on the table. To stack white on blue, we need to pick up white and stack it on blue. But blue is on black_block_2. So:

7. (After step 6) Putdown yellow (from step 7, but maybe step 7 is different. Let me retrace.)

Wait, let's reorganize the steps:

Let me outline the steps again, making sure all constraints are met.

1. Unstack black_block_1 from yellow_block_1. Now holding black_block_1. (This satisfies constraint 13 because after unstacking, yellow is not clear in initial state, and now we're holding black_block_1.)

2. Putdown black_block_1 on table.

3. Unstack yellow_block_1 from orange_block_1. Now holding yellow.

4. Putdown yellow_block_1 on table. (Satisfies constraint 5.)

5. Unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1. Now holding red.

6. Putdown red_block_1 on table. (Satisfies constraint 8.)

7. Pickup red_block_1 again.

8. Stack red_block_1 on orange_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 4.)

9. Pickup black_block_1 from table.

10. Stack black_block_1 on red_block_1. Now red is not clear. (Satisfies part of constraint 9.)

11. Now, need to stack white_block_1 on blue_block_1 to satisfy constraint 11. So:

11. Pickup white_block_1 (it's on table, clear).

12. Stack white_block_1 on blue_block_1. Now blue is not clear. (But wait, blue is on black_block_2, so stacking white on blue would require blue to be clear. But initially, blue is clear. Wait, after step 11, white is stacked on blue. So blue is not clear. But in step 12, we need to unstack blue later. So after stacking white on blue, to unstack blue, we need to unstack white first. But the goal is to have the arm holding blue. So this complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe stack white on blue after blue is on the table. But we need to move blue first.

Alternatively, after unstacking blue and holding it, put it down and then stack white on it. But that would require:

For example:

13. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2. (Hold blue.)

14. Putdown blue_block_1 on table.

15. Pickup white_block_1.

16. Stack white_block_1 on blue_block_1. Now blue is not clear. (Satisfies constraint 1.)

17. Unstack white_block_1 from blue_block_1.

18. Pickup blue_block_1 again. (This achieves the goal.)

But this adds steps, but ensures that blue is not clear at step 16. Also, step 16 satisfies constraint 1. Then step 17 unstacking white, step 18 holding blue.

But how does this fit into the other steps.

Let me integrate this into the plan:

After step 10 (stack black_block_1 on red_block_1):

11. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2. Now holding blue. (But this would be the goal, but we need to first satisfy other constraints.)

Wait, but if we unstack blue here, we can then put it down and stack white on it.

But let's proceed:

11. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2. (Hold blue.)

12. Putdown blue_block_1 on table.

13. Pickup white_block_1.

14. Stack white_block_1 on blue_block_1. Now blue is not clear (satisfies constraint 1). Also, this satisfies constraint 11, as white is on blue.

15. Now, to hold blue again, need to unstack white_block_1.

15. Unstack white_block_1 from blue_block_1. Now holding white.

16. Putdown white_block_1.

17. Pickup blue_block_1. Now holding blue, which is the goal.

But this adds steps. Also, in this scenario, when blue is not clear (step 14), we need to ensure that red was on the table in an earlier state. Which it was in step 6.

Now, let's check constraint 14: must hold yellow_block_1 while red is not clear. So after step 10, red is not clear (has black_block_1 on top). So we need to hold yellow_block_1 during or after that.

In the current plan, after step 10, we need to have a step where we hold yellow_block_1. For example, after step 10, we could pick up yellow_block_1 (which is on the table from step 4).

So inserting steps:

After step 10:

11. Pickup yellow_block_1 from table. (Now holding yellow, and red is not clear. So this satisfies constraint 14.)

12. Then proceed with steps to handle blue and white.

But integrating this:

After step 10:

11. Pickup yellow_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 14.)

12. Putdown yellow_block_1 somewhere, perhaps back on orange.

But maybe not necessary. Let's proceed:

After step 10:

11. Pickup yellow_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 14.)

12. Now, proceed to handle blue and white.

13. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2. (Hold blue.)

14. Putdown blue_block_1.

15. Pickup white_block_1.

16. Stack white on blue. (Satisfies constraint 1 and 11.)

17. Unstack white_block_1.

18. Putdown white_block_1.

19. Pickup blue_block_1. (Goal achieved.)

But this makes the plan quite long. Let's count the steps. Each action is a line, so steps 1-19. But need to check if there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, perhaps when we stack white on blue, blue is not clear (constraint 1), and then we can directly unstack white and pick up blue.

But let's check if all constraints are covered:

- Constraint 1: step 16 (white on blue).

- Constraint 2: step 16 requires red was on table earlier (step 6).

- Constraint 3: step 1 makes yellow clear.

- Constraint 4: step 8.

- Constraint 5: step 4.

- Constraint 6: blue is not on white in many states, including initial.

- Constraint 7: blue not on white in step 16 (it's white on blue). So in step 16, blue is not on white, so yellow must be clear in that state or after. In step 11, we picked up yellow, so after step 11, yellow is in hand, which means it's not on the table. Wait, no. If we putdown yellow after step 11, then it's on the table and clear. But in step 11, we pick up yellow, so after that, yellow is not on the table. So if in step 16, blue is not on white, we need yellow to be clear at step 16 or after. But in step 16, yellow is in hand (if we didn't put it down), so not clear. Hmm, this might be a problem.

Wait, step 11: Pickup yellow_block_1 (from table). So after step 11, yellow is in hand. Then step 12: putdown yellow_block_1 somewhere. For example, back on orange_block_1. But then, to do that, orange must be clear. Originally, after step 8, red is on orange. So step 8: stack red on orange. So orange is now occupied by red. So we can't stack yellow on orange unless red is moved. Hmm.

Alternatively, putdown yellow on black_block_2, which is on the table and clear. So after step 11, we can putdown yellow on black_block_2:

12. Putdown yellow_block_1 on black_block_2. Now yellow is on black_block_2, which is clear. So black_block_2 is not clear anymore. But this might complicate other steps.

But the main point is to ensure that in step 16 (blue not on white), yellow is clear in that state or after. If in step 16, yellow is on black_block_2 and clear (if nothing is on top), then that's okay. But after step 12, if we putdown yellow on black_block_2, then yellow is on black_block_2, which makes black_block_2 not clear. So when we unstack blue from black_block_2 in step 13, we need to unstack yellow first.

Wait, if in step 12 we put yellow on black_block_2, then blue is under yellow. So to unstack blue, we need to unstack yellow first. But that would require:

13. Unstack yellow_block_1 from black_block_2.

14. Putdown yellow.

15. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2.

But this adds more steps. This is getting very complicated. Perhaps there's a more optimal path.

Alternative approach: Let's try to find the shortest possible path that meets all constraints.

The main goal is to hold blue_block_1. The constraints require certain conditions to be met during the plan. Let's see if we can satisfy them with minimal steps.

Let's list all constraints again and see which ones are already satisfied by the initial state or require actions.

Constraints:

1. blue_block_1 not clear: need to stack something on it.

2. If blue not clear, then red was on table before.

3. yellow clear at least once.

4. red on orange at least once.

5. yellow on table at least once.

6. blue not on white at least once (initial state satisfies this).

7. If blue not on white in state s, then yellow clear in s or after. Since blue is not on white in initial state, we need yellow clear after.

8. red on table at least once.

9. black_block_2 on red or black_block_1 not clear.

10. black_block_1 not on table (already true initially).

11. If black_block_1 not on table (which it is), then white on blue at some point after.

12. yellow not clear at least once (initial state satisfies this).

13. If yellow not clear (as in initial state), then hold black_block_1 after.

14. Hold yellow and red not clear.

So the main constraints that require action are:

- 1: stack something on blue.

- 2: ensure that when blue is not clear, red was on table before.

- 3: make yellow clear by unstacking black_block_1.

- 4: stack red on orange.

- 5: put yellow on table.

- 8: put red on table.

- 9: either black_block_2 on red or black_block_1 not clear (we can have black_block_1 not clear by stacking something on it).

- 11: stack white on blue.

- 14: hold yellow while red is not clear.

Let me try to find a sequence that covers these with minimal steps.

Possible steps:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from yellow_block_1. Now holding black_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 3 (yellow clear) and 13 (holding black_block_1 after yellow was not clear).)

2. Putdown black_block_1.

3. Unstack yellow_block_1 from orange_block_1. (Holding yellow.)

4. Putdown yellow_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 5.)

5. Unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1. (Holding red.)

6. Putdown red_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 8.)

7. Pickup red_block_1.

8. Stack red_block_1 on orange_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 4.)

9. Pickup black_block_1.

10. Stack black_block_1 on red_block_1. (Now red is not clear. Satisfies constraint 9 as black_block_1 is not clear. Also, for constraint 14, need to hold yellow while red is not clear.)

11. Now, pick up yellow_block_1 (on table). (Holding yellow, red is not clear. Satisfies constraint 14.)

12. Stack yellow_block_1 on blue_block_1. (Now blue is not clear, satisfying constraint 1. Also, for constraint 2, red was on table in step 6.)

13. Now, need to stack white_block_1 on blue_block_1 to satisfy constraint 11. So:

13. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1. (Holding yellow.)

14. Putdown yellow_block_1.

15. Pickup white_block_1.

16. Stack white_block_1 on blue_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 11.)

17. Unstack white_block_1 from blue_block_1. (Holding white.)

18. Putdown white_block_1.

19. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2. (Holding blue, goal achieved.)

But this is a lot of steps. Let's see if any steps can be optimized.

Alternatively, after step 12 (stack yellow on blue), can we stack white on blue without unstacking yellow?

Wait, if blue has yellow on top, to stack white on blue, we need to unstack yellow first. So no. So steps 13-19 are necessary.

But maybe there's a shorter way. Let's see:

After step 12 (yellow on blue), instead of unstacking yellow, can we stack white on yellow? Then blue would have yellow, which has white. But that would make blue not clear (since yellow is on blue), and white is on yellow. But this doesn't help.

Alternatively, after step 10 (stack black_block_1 on red), instead of stacking yellow on blue, we can stack white on blue directly.

So:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (Hold black_block_1.)

2. Putdown black_block_1.

3. Unstack yellow_block_1 from orange_block_1. (Hold yellow.)

4. Putdown yellow_block_1. (Satisfies 5.)

5. Unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1. (Hold red.)

6. Putdown red_block_1. (Satisfies 8.)

7. Pickup red_block_1.

8. Stack red_block_1 on orange_block_1. (Satisfies 4.)

9. Pickup black_block_1.

10. Stack black_block_1 on red_block_1. (Satisfies 9.)

11. Pickup yellow_block_1. (Satisfies 14.)

12. Putdown yellow_block_1. (Not helpful.)

13. Pickup white_block_1.

14. Stack white_block_1 on blue_block_1. (Now blue is not clear. Satisfies 1 and 11.)

15. Unstack white_block_1 from blue_block_1. (Hold white.)

16. Putdown white_block_1.

17. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2. (Hold blue. Goal achieved.)

But this skips stacking yellow on blue, but steps 11-17 are:

11. Pickup yellow (satisfies 14 if done while red is not clear, which it is after step 10).

But step 11: holding yellow, and red is not clear. So constraint 14 is satisfied.

Then, steps 13-14: stack white on blue, which satisfies constraint 1 and 11.

Then unstack white and pick up blue.

So this plan would be:

1. pickup black_block_1 from yellow_block_1 via unstack.

Wait, no: the actions are "unstack x y", which requires x is on y and clear, and arm is empty.

So:

1. unstack black_block_1 yellow_block_1

2. putdown black_block_1

3. unstack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1

4. putdown yellow_block_1

5. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1

6. putdown red_block_1

7. pickup red_block_1

8. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1

9. pickup black_block_1

10. stack black_block_1 red_block_1

11. pickup yellow_block_1

12. putdown yellow_block_1

13. pickup white_block_1

14. stack white_block_1 blue_block_1

15. unstack white_block_1 blue_block_1

16. putdown white_block_1

17. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2

But this is 17 steps. Is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, after step 14 (stack white on blue), can we unstack blue from black_block_2? But blue has white on top. So need to unstack white first.

So steps 15-17 are necessary.

But perhaps there's a way to combine steps.

Wait, after step 14, white is on blue. To get blue, you must first unstack white. Then unstack blue.

So steps:

14. stack white_block_1 blue_block_1

15. unstack white_block_1 blue_block_1

16. putdown white_block_1

17. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2

So that's necessary.

But this seems like the minimal steps to satisfy all constraints.

Let me check if all constraints are met:

1. step 14: blue is not clear. Satisfied.

2. step 14: earlier state step 6 has red on table. Yes.

3. step 3: unstack yellow makes it clear. Satisfied.

4. step 8: red on orange. Yes.

5. step 4: yellow on table. Yes.

6. initial state: blue not on white. Yes.

7. whenever blue not on white (always true), yellow clear after step 3. Yes.

8. step 6: red on table. Yes.

9. step 10: black_block_1 on red, so not clear. Yes.

10. black_block_1 not on table. Yes (stacked on red).

11. step 14: white on blue. Yes.

12. initial state: yellow not clear. Yes.

13. step 1: after yellow not clear, hold black_block_1. Yes.

14. step 11: hold yellow while red is not clear (after step 10). Yes.

All constraints are satisfied.

But wait, step 11 is pickup yellow_block_1, which is on the table (step 4). Then step 12 is putdown yellow_block_1. So during step 11, the arm is holding yellow, and red is not clear (due to step 10). So constraint 14 is satisfied in step 11.

Thus, this plan seems to meet all constraints.

Now, count the steps:

1. unstack black_block_1 yellow_block_1

2. putdown black_block_1

3. unstack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1

4. putdown yellow_block_1

5. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1

6. putdown red_block_1

7. pickup red_block_1

8. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1

9. pickup black_block_1

10. stack black_block_1 red_block_1

11. pickup yellow_block_1

12. putdown yellow_block_1

13. pickup white_block_1

14. stack white_block_1 blue_block_1

15. unstack white_block_1 blue_block_1

16. putdown white_block_1

17. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2

But step 12: putdown yellow_block_1 is optional if we can use it elsewhere. But in this plan, it's needed to free the arm to pick up white.

But is there a way to reduce steps?

Alternatively, after step 11 (holding yellow), instead of putting it down, use it in another way. For example:

11. pickup yellow_block_1

12. stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1 (making blue not clear)

13. then pickup white_block_1 and stack on blue, but blue already has yellow. So can't stack white on blue unless yellow is unstacked.

Hmm, but maybe that's a better path.

Let's try:

After step 10 (stack black_block_1 on red):

11. pickup yellow_block_1 (satisfies constraint 14)

12. stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1 (now blue is not clear, satisfying constraint 1)

13. pickup white_block_1

14. stack white_block_1 yellow_block_1 (requires yellow to be clear, which it is after step 12. Now white is on yellow, which is on blue. This satisfies constraint 11: white is on blue. Because white is stacked on yellow, which is on blue. So technically, white is not on blue, but on yellow. So this does not satisfy constraint 11, which requires white on blue. So that's invalid.

Thus, step 14 would need to stack white directly on blue. So after step 12 (yellow on blue), we need to unstack yellow to stack white.

So steps:

11. pickup yellow_block_1

12. stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1

13. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1

14. putdown yellow_block_1

15. pickup white_block_1

16. stack white_block_1 blue_block_1

17. unstack white_block_1 blue_block_1

18. putdown white_block_1

19. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2

This adds more steps. So original plan is better.

Thus, the initial 17-step plan is likely the shortest possible.

But let's check if any steps can be optimized.

For example, after step 7 (pickup red_block_1), can we directly stack it on orange_block_1 without putting it down first?

Wait, steps 5-7: unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1 (step 5), putdown (step 6), then pickup (step 7). But perhaps instead of putting it down, we can stack it directly on orange_block_1. Let's see:

After step 5: unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1 → holding red.

Then step 6: stack red_block_1 on orange_block_1. But orange_block_1 currently has yellow_block_1 on it (from initial state). Wait, no: in step 3, we unstacked yellow_block_1 from orange_block_1 and put it down in step 4. So by step 5, orange_block_1 is clear. So after step 5 (holding red), can we directly stack it on orange_block_1, skipping steps 6 and 7.

Yes:

Revised steps:

1. unstack black_block_1 yellow_block_1

2. putdown black_block_1

3. unstack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1

4. putdown yellow_block_1

5. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1

6. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1

This would save two steps (original steps 6 and 7: putdown and pickup). So steps saved.

Then proceed:

7. pickup black_block_1

8. stack black_block_1 red_block_1

9. pickup yellow_block_1

10. putdown yellow_block_1

11. pickup white_block_1

12. stack white_block_1 blue_block_1

13. unstack white_block_1 blue_block_1

14. putdown white_block_1

15. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2

So total steps reduced from 17 to 15. Let's check if this works.

Constraint 8: red must be on the table. But in this revised plan, red is stacked on orange in step 6, never put on the table. So constraint 8 is violated. Oops. So we need to have red on the table at some state. So in this revised plan, red is only on orange, not on the table. Thus, this violates constraint 8.

Thus, the steps 5-7 are necessary to put red on the table.

Thus, the original steps 5-8 (unstack red, putdown, pickup, stack) are needed to satisfy constraint 8.

Thus, the plan can't be shortened there.

Alternative approach: to satisfy constraint 8, red must be on the table at some point. So we need to putdown red after unstacking it from white. So steps 5 and 6 are necessary.

Thus, the initial plan of 17 steps seems necessary.

But wait, another idea: after stacking red on orange (step 8), then unstack it again and put it on the table. But that would satisfy constraint 8 again, but it's redundant. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps after unstacking red from white (step 5), put it on the table (step 6), then stack it on orange (step 7-8). This way, red is on table (step 6) and later on orange (step 8). This satisfies constraint 8 (red on table) and constraint 4 (red on orange). This is what the original plan does.

Thus, the initial plan is correct.

Another possible optimization: after step 10 (stack black_block_1 on red_block_1), we need to hold yellow_block_1. Instead of putting down yellow in step 12, can we use it to satisfy constraint 14 and then stack it somewhere else without putting it down.

But step 11: pickup yellow_block_1 (satisfies constraint 14). Then step 12: stack yellow_block_1 on blue_block_1 (satisfies constraint 1). Then proceed to handle white.

This would save the putdown step. Let's see:

After step 10:

11. pickup yellow_block_1.

12. stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 1 and 14.)

13. pickup white_block_1.

14. stack white_block_1 yellow_block_1. (But yellow is on blue, so white is on yellow. This satisfies constraint 11 because white is on yellow, which is on blue. But constraint 11 requires white on blue. So this doesn't satisfy it. Thus, invalid.)

Thus, need to stack white directly on blue. So after step 12:

13. unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1.

14. putdown yellow_block_1.

15. pickup white_block_1.

16. stack white_block_1 blue_block_1.

17. unstack white_block_1 blue_block_1.

18. putdown white_block_1.

19. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2.

This is still 19 steps, which is longer.

Thus, the initial plan of 17 steps seems to be the most optimal.

Now, let's write the final plan with the 17 steps:

```
unstack black_block_1 yellow_block_1
putdown black_block_1
unstack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1
putdown yellow_block_1
unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
putdown red_block_1
pickup red_block_1
stack red_block_1 orange_block_1
pickup black_block_1
stack black_block_1 red_block_1
pickup yellow_block_1
putdown yellow_block_1
pickup white_block_1
stack white_block_1 blue_block_1
unstack white_block_1 blue_block_1
putdown white_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2
```

But wait, after step 14 (stack white_block_1 blue_block_1), we need to unstack white_block_1 to get blue. Then step 15: unstack white_block_1 from blue_block_1. Then putdown white. Then step 17: unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2.

Yes, this achieves the goal. Let's check all constraints again with this plan:

- Constraint 1: step 14 (white on blue).

- Constraint 2: step 14 requires red was on table (step 6).

- Constraint 3: step 3 (unstack yellow makes it clear).

- Constraint 4: step 8 (red on orange).

- Constraint 5: step 4 (yellow on table).

- Constraint 6: initial state.

- Constraint 7: satisfied because after step 3, yellow is clear.

- Constraint 8: step 6.

- Constraint 9: step 10 (black_block_1 on red).

- Constraint 10: initially true.

- Constraint 11: step 14 (white on blue).

- Constraint 12: initially true.

- Constraint 13: step 1 (unstack black_block_1 after initial state where yellow was not clear).

- Constraint 14: step 11 (hold yellow while red is not clear after step 10).

All constraints are satisfied. The plan is 17 steps. However, the problem asks for an optimal plan with minimal length. Is there a shorter way?

Let me think again. Maybe there's a way to avoid some steps.

For example, after step 10 (stack black_block_1 on red), we need to pickup yellow_block_1 (step 11) to satisfy constraint 14. But perhaps instead of putting it down (step 12), can we use it in another way. For instance, stack it on blue_block_1 in step 12.

So:

11. pickup yellow_block_1

12. stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1 (satisfies constraint 1 and 14)

13. pickup white_block_1

14. stack white_block_1 yellow_block_1 (but this stacks white on yellow, which is on blue. This satisfies constraint 11? No, because white is on yellow, not on blue. So constraint 11 requires white on blue. So invalid.

Thus, step 14 must stack white on blue, requiring yellow to be unstacked first.

Alternatively, after step 12:

13. unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1

14. putdown yellow_block_1

15. pickup white_block_1

16. stack white_block_1 blue_block_1

17. unstack white_block_1 blue_block_1

18. putdown white_block_1

19. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2

This is 19 steps, longer than the initial 17-step plan. So no improvement.

Another idea: maybe after stacking black_block_1 on red (step 10), we can stack white_block_1 on blue_block_1 directly, then handle yellow_block_1 later.

But to stack white on blue, white must be picked up. So:

10. stack black_block_1 red_block_1

11. pickup white_block_1

12. stack white_block_1 blue_block_1 (satisfies constraint 1 and 11)

13. unstack white_block_1 blue_block_1

14. putdown white_block_1

15. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2 (now holding blue, goal achieved)

But during this, constraint 14 is not satisfied (hold yellow while red is not clear). So need to include that.

Thus, after step 10:

11. pickup yellow_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 14)

12. stack yellow_block_1 somewhere, then proceed with white.

But this adds steps. So the initial plan seems to be the shortest possible.

Thus, the provided plan of 17 steps is optimal.
