Alright, let's analyze this blocksworld problem step by step.

First, let's understand the initial state:
- `purple_block_1` is on the table
- `green_block_1` is on the table
- `purple_block_2` is on the table
- `red_block_1` is on top of `purple_block_2`
- `green_block_2` is on top of `green_block_1`
- `red_block_2` is on top of `purple_block_1`
- `orange_block_1` is on top of `red_block_2`
- `red_block_1` is clear
- `green_block_2` is clear
- `orange_block_1` is clear
- not holding any block

And the goal is to bring about:
- `red_block_2` is on the table

Now let's analyze the constraints one by one:

1. "you are holding orange_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - This means that at some point, we need to hold `orange_block_1`.

2. If "you are holding orange_block_1" holds, then there must be an earlier state where either "you are holding green_block_2" or "green_block_1 is clear".
   - So before we hold `orange_block_1`, we must either hold `green_block_2` or make `green_block_1` clear.

3. "red_block_2 is not on top of green_block_2" must hold in at least one state.
   - Initially, `red_block_2` is on top of `purple_block_1`, not `green_block_2`, so this condition is already met.

4. If "red_block_2 is not on top of green_block_2" holds in a state s, then at s or later, "purple_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" and "you are holding purple_block_1" must both hold.
   - This means we must move `purple_block_2` on top of `green_block_1` and be holding `purple_block_1`.

5. "there is no block on top of red_block_2, i.e., red_block_2 is clear" must hold in at least one state.
   - Initially, `orange_block_1` is on top of `red_block_2`, so we need to move `orange_block_1` off `red_block_2` at some point.

6. If "red_block_2 is clear" holds, then there must be an earlier state where "purple_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1".
   - This means before we make `red_block_2` clear, we must place `purple_block_2` on top of `orange_block_1`.

7. "orange_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in every state.
   - This means we can never put `orange_block_1` on the table. It must always be on top of another block when not being held.

8. "green_block_2 is on top of red_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - We need to move `green_block_2` on top of `red_block_1` at some point.

9. "there is a block on top of green_block_1, i.e., green_block_1 is not clear" must hold in at least one state.
   - Initially, `green_block_2` is on top of `green_block_1`, so this condition is already met.

10. If "green_block_1 is not clear" holds in a state s, then at s or later, "orange_block_1 is not clear" must hold.
    - This means after `green_block_1` is not clear, `orange_block_1` also must not be clear.

11. "At least one of the following conditions is true: green_block_2 is on the table, red_block_1 is on the table" must hold in at least one state.
    - We need to either move `green_block_2` to the table or move `red_block_1` to the table at some point.

12. "purple_block_2 is not on top of red_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
    - We need to ensure that `purple_block_2` is not on top of `red_block_1` at some point.

13. If "purple_block_2 is not on top of red_block_1" holds in a state s, then at s or later, "purple_block_2 is clear" must hold.
    - After we ensure `purple_block_2` is not on top of `red_block_1`, we must make `purple_block_2` clear.

14. "red_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in at least one state.
    - We need to move `red_block_1` off the table at some point.

15. If "red_block_1 is not on the table" holds in a state s, then at s or later, "you are holding purple_block_2" must hold.
    - After moving `red_block_1` off the table, we must be holding `purple_block_2`.

16. "green_block_1 is not on top of purple_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
    - This condition is already met because in the initial state, `green_block_1` is on the table, not on top of `purple_block_1`.

17. If "green_block_1 is not on top of purple_block_1" holds in a state s, then at s or later, both "orange_block_1 is not clear" and "green_block_2 is on top of red_block_1" must hold.
    - After ensuring `green_block_1` is not on top of `purple_block_1`, we must make `orange_block_1` not clear and place `green_block_2` on top of `red_block_1`.

Now, let's think about a plan to achieve the goal and satisfy all constraints.

First, I notice that our goal is to have `red_block_2` on the table, and currently, it is under `orange_block_1` and on top of `purple_block_1`. So we need to move `orange_block_1` and then move `red_block_2` to the table. But there are a lot of other constraints we need to satisfy.

Let's start by considering the constraint that "orange_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in every state. This means we can't put `orange_block_1` on the table.

Also, we need to ensure that "purple_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1" before making `red_block_2` clear, which is currently not the case.

Additionally, we need to place `green_block_2` on top of `red_block_1` at some point.

Let's try to devise a plan step by step, keeping track of the constraints.

I'll start from the initial state and think about the moves I need to make.

From the initial state, I see that `red_block_2` is on `purple_block_1`, and `orange_block_1` is on `red_block_2`. I want to get `red_block_2` on the table, but I need to move `orange_block_1` first.

Let's check the constraints again to see if there's an order I need to follow:

1. Before holding `orange_block_1`, I need to either hold `green_block_2` or make `green_block_1` clear.
   - Currently, `green_block_2` is on `green_block_1`, so `green_block_1` is not clear. Let's first unstack `green_block_2` from `green_block_1`.

So my first move is to unstack `green_block_2` from `green_block_1`.

Alright, after unstacking `green_block_2`, I can hold `green_block_2` and `green_block_1` is clear, satisfying one of the conditions needed before holding `orange_block_1`.

Next, I need to decide where to put `green_block_2`. The constraints say "green_block_2 is on top of red_block_1" must hold in at least one state, so I should stack `green_block_2` on `red_block_1`.

But first, let's check if there are any other restrictions.

Let's check the constraints of "At least one of the following conditions is true: green_block_2 is on the table, red_block_1 is on the table". I can satisfy this by putting `green_block_2` on the table.

But I should also check if there are conditions related to "green_block_2 is on top of red_block_1" that must be satisfied in a specific order.

I see that if "green_block_1 is not on top of purple_block_1" (which is already the case), then later on "green_block_2 is on top of red_block_1" must hold. But this doesn't give a specific order, just that it must happen after we ensure `green_block_1` is not on top of `purple_block_1`.

Another constraint says that after "there is a block on top of green_block_1, i.e., green_block_1 is not clear", we must ensure "orange_block_1 is not clear". Since the condition already holds in the initial state, we need to make sure `orange_block_1` is not clear at some point.

Hmm, let's think through this more carefully. There are a lot of interrelated constraints.

Let's start with the fact that we need to make `red_block_2` clear, and before that, `purple_block_2` must be on top of `orange_block_1`. So, I need to move `purple_block_2` on top of `orange_block_1`.

Currently, `red_block_1` is on top of `purple_block_2`, so I need to unstack `red_block_1` first.

Let's try to build a plan, step by step, considering all constraints.

1. Unstack `green_block_2` from `green_block_1`. Now holding `green_block_2`.
2. Stack `green_block_2` on top of `red_block_1`. Now, `green_block_2` is on top of `red_block_1` and `green_block_1` is clear.
3. Unstack `red_block_1` from `purple_block_2`. Now holding `red_block_1`.

Actually, let's go back to constraint 17. It says "After ensuring `green_block_1` is not on top of `purple_block_1` [which is already the case], we must make `orange_block_1` not clear and place `green_block_2` on top of `red_block_1`."

So I need to make `orange_block_1` not clear and put `green_block_2` on top of `red_block_1`. That means I need to put something on top of `orange_block_1`.

But before that, constraint 6 says that before making `red_block_2` clear, I must place `purple_block_2` on top of `orange_block_1`.

Let's think about this differently. Let's try to identify which constraints are the most restrictive and build a plan from there.

First, I know my goal is to have `red_block_2` on the table. This means I need to unstack `orange_block_1` and then unstack `red_block_2`. But I can't put `orange_block_1` on the table.

Constraint 6 says: If `red_block_2` is clear, then there must be an earlier state where `purple_block_2` is on top of `orange_block_1`. This means I must move `purple_block_2` on top of `orange_block_1` before making `red_block_2` clear.

Constraint 17 says: "If `green_block_1` is not on top of `purple_block_1` (which is already the case in the initial state), then later on, both `orange_block_1` is not clear and `green_block_2` is on top of `red_block_1` must hold."

This means I need to put something on top of `orange_block_1` and also put `green_block_2` on top of `red_block_1`.

Constraint 4 says: If `red_block_2` is not on top of `green_block_2` (which is already the case in the initial state), then later on, `purple_block_2` is on top of `green_block_1` and I'm holding `purple_block_1` must both hold.

This means I need to put `purple_block_2` on top of `green_block_1` and be holding `purple_block_1`.

Alright, I'm going to try to put together a plan now:

1. Unstack `green_block_2` from `green_block_1`. (This gives us "green_block_1 is clear", satisfying constraint 2)
2. Set aside `green_block_2` by putting it on the table. (This satisfies constraint 11)
3. Unstack `red_block_1` from `purple_block_2`. (This helps us move `purple_block_2` onto `orange_block_1` later)
4. Stack `red_block_1` on the table. (This also satisfies constraint 11, though we already satisfied it)
5. Now we can move `purple_block_2`...

Actually, let me start fresh. Let's look at the constraints one by one and note the order in which things must happen.

1. Constraint 2: Before holding `orange_block_1`, we must either hold `green_block_2` or make `green_block_1` clear.
   - So, we need to unstack `green_block_2` from `green_block_1` before moving `orange_block_1`.

2. Constraint 6: Before making `red_block_2` clear, we must place `purple_block_2` on top of `orange_block_1`.
   - So, we need to move `red_block_1` off `purple_block_2`, move `purple_block_2` onto `orange_block_1`, and then we can make `red_block_2` clear.

3. Constraint 17: If "green_block_1 is not on top of purple_block_1" holds (which is already the case in the initial state), then later on, both "orange_block_1 is not clear" and "green_block_2 is on top of red_block_1" must hold.
   - Since we'll need `purple_block_2` on top of `orange_block_1`, `orange_block_1` won't be clear. We also need to put `green_block_2` on top of `red_block_1`.

4. Constraint 4: If "red_block_2 is not on top of green_block_2" holds (which is already the case in the initial state), then later on, "purple_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" and "you are holding purple_block_1" must both hold.
   - We need to move `purple_block_2` onto `green_block_1` and be holding `purple_block_1`.

5. Constraint 15: If "red_block_1 is not on the table" holds, then later on, "you are holding purple_block_2" must hold.
   - After moving `red_block_1` off the table, we must be holding `purple_block_2`.

Let's try to devise a plan considering these constraints:

1. Unstack `green_block_2` from `green_block_1`. Now holding `green_block_2`.
2. Stack `green_block_2` on `red_block_1`. Now `green_block_2` is on top of `red_block_1` (Constraint 8) and `green_block_1` is clear.
3. Unstack `orange_block_1` from `red_block_2`. Now holding `orange_block_1` (Constraint 1). This also makes `red_block_2` clear (Constraint 5).
 
Wait, that's not quite right yet. According to constraint 6, before making `red_block_2` clear, we must place `purple_block_2` on top of `orange_block_1`. So I can't just unstack `orange_block_1` directly; I need to move `purple_block_2` first.

Let's revise:

1. Unstack `green_block_2` from `green_block_1`. Now holding `green_block_2`.
2. Stack `green_block_2` on `red_block_1`. Now `green_block_2` is on top of `red_block_1` (Constraint 8) and `green_block_1` is clear.
3. Unstack `red_block_1` from `purple_block_2`. Now holding `red_block_1`. This also makes `purple_block_2` not on top of `red_block_1` (Constraint 12).
4. Stack `red_block_1` on the table. Now `red_block_1` is on the table (Constraint 11).

OK, I'm confused. Let's go back to the goal and work backwards.

Goal: `red_block_2` is on the table.

To reach this goal, we need to:
1. Move `orange_block_1` off `red_block_2`.
2. Move `red_block_2` to the table.

Here are some of the key constraints:

- Before holding `orange_block_1`, we must either hold `green_block_2` or make `green_block_1` clear.
- Before making `red_block_2` clear, we must place `purple_block_2` on top of `orange_block_1`.
- We can never put `orange_block_1` on the table.
- We must, at some point, put `green_block_2` on top of `red_block_1`.
- If `red_block_1` is not on the table, then later on, we must be holding `purple_block_2`.
- If "green_block_1 is not on top of purple_block_1" holds (which is already the case in the initial state), then later on, both "orange_block_1 is not clear" and "green_block_2 is on top of red_block_1" must hold.
- If "red_block_2 is not on top of green_block_2" holds (which is already the case in the initial state), then later on, "purple_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" and "you are holding purple_block_1" must both hold.

Let's revise our plan now:

1. Unstack `green_block_2` from `green_block_1`. Now holding `green_block_2`.
2. Stack `green_block_2` on `red_block_1`. Now `green_block_2` is on top of `red_block_1` (Constraint 8) and `green_block_1` is clear.
3. Unstack `red_block_1` from `purple_block_2`. Now holding `red_block_1`. This also makes `purple_block_2` not on top of `red_block_1` (Constraint 12).
4. Unstack `green_block_2` from `red_block_1`. Now holding `green_block_2`.

OK, I'm going to write out a new plan from scratch with a clearer thinking process.

From the initial state, I want to get `red_block_2` on the table. Currently, `orange_block_1` is on top of `red_block_2`, so I need to move `orange_block_1` first.

Constraint 2 says that before holding `orange_block_1`, I must either hold `green_block_2` or make `green_block_1` clear. Since `green_block_2` is on top of `green_block_1`, I'll unstack `green_block_2` first.

1. Unstack `green_block_2` from `green_block_1`. Now holding `green_block_2`.

Where should I put `green_block_2`? Constraint 8 says that "green_block_2 is on top of red_block_1" must hold in at least one state. So, I'll stack `green_block_2` on `red_block_1`.

2. Stack `green_block_2` on `red_block_1`. Now `green_block_2` is on top of `red_block_1`.

Now, I want to move `orange_block_1` so I can get to `red_block_2`. But, Constraint 6 says that before making `red_block_2` clear, `purple_block_2` must be on top of `orange_block_1`.

So, I need to move `purple_block_2` onto `orange_block_1`. But `purple_block_2` has `red_block_1` on top of it, and `red_block_1` now has `green_block_2` on top of it.

I'll unstack `green_block_2` from `red_block_1`.

3. Unstack `green_block_2` from `red_block_1`. Now holding `green_block_2`.

Where should I put `green_block_2`? Let's put it on the table for now (which also satisfies Constraint 11: "Either `green_block_2` is on the table or `red_block_1` is on the table").

4. Put down `green_block_2`. Now `green_block_2` is on the table.

Now, let's unstack `red_block_1` from `purple_block_2`.

5. Unstack `red_block_1` from `purple_block_2`. Now holding `red_block_1`.

According to Constraint 15, after moving `red_block_1` off the table (which it already is), we must be holding `purple_block_2`. So, I should pick up `purple_block_2` soon.

Let's put `red_block_1` on the table for now.

6. Put down `red_block_1`. Now `red_block_1` is on the table.

Now, let's pick up `purple_block_2` to satisfy Constraint 15.

7. Pickup `purple_block_2`. Now holding `purple_block_2`.

Where should I place `purple_block_2`? Constraint 6 says that before making `red_block_2` clear, `purple_block_2` must be on top of `orange_block_1`. So, I should place `purple_block_2` on `orange_block_1`.

8. Stack `purple_block_2` on `orange_block_1`. Now `purple_block_2` is on top of `orange_block_1`.

Now, according to Constraint 4, since `red_block_2` is not on top of `green_block_2` (which has been the case from the start), I must ensure that `purple_block_2` is on top of `green_block_1` and I'm holding `purple_block_1`.

So, I need to move `purple_block_2` onto `green_block_1` and hold `purple_block_1`. But this conflicts with the plan. Let me rethink...

Constraint 4 says: If `red_block_2` is not on top of `green_block_2` (which is already the case in the initial state), then at some later state, `purple_block_2` is on top of `green_block_1` and I'm holding `purple_block_1` must both hold. I don't need to move `purple_block_2` onto `green_block_1` right now. I can do it later.

Now, I want to make `red_block_2` clear. Since `purple_block_2` is on top of `orange_block_1`, which satisfies the prerequisite for making `red_block_2` clear (Constraint 6), I can unstack `orange_block_1` from `red_block_2`.

9. Unstack `purple_block_2` from `orange_block_1`. Now holding `purple_block_2`.
10. Stack `purple_block_2` on `green_block_1`. Now `purple_block_2` is on top of `green_block_1`. This also satisfies the first part of Constraint 4 (But I still need to hold `purple_block_1`).

11. Unstack `orange_block_1` from `red_block_2`. Now holding `orange_block_1` and `red_block_2` is clear.

Where should I put `orange_block_1`? Constraint 7 says "orange_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in every state, so I can't put it on the table. I'll stack it on a clear block, like `red_block_1`.

12. Stack `orange_block_1` on `red_block_1`. Now `orange_block_1` is on top of `red_block_1` and not on the table.

Now, I can unstack `red_block_2` from `purple_block_1`.

13. Unstack `red_block_2` from `purple_block_1`. Now holding `red_block_2`.
14. Put down `red_block_2`. Now `red_block_2` is on the table, which is our goal.

Now, let's check the constraints we still need to satisfy:

One constraint we haven't satisfied yet is Constraint 4, which requires that I hold `purple_block_1`. Let's do that now.

15. Pickup `purple_block_1`. Now holding `purple_block_1` and the second part of Constraint 4 is satisfied.

Let's check all the constraints to make sure we've met them:

1. "you are holding orange_block_1" must hold in at least one state. ✓ (Step 11)
2. Before holding `orange_block_1`, we must either hold `green_block_2` or make `green_block_1` clear. ✓ (Steps 1 and 11)
3. "red_block_2 is not on top of green_block_2" must hold in at least one state. ✓ (Initial state and every step)
4. If "red_block_2 is not on top of green_block_2" holds, then later on, "purple_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" and "you are holding purple_block_1" must both hold. ✓ (Steps 10 and 15)
5. "red_block_2 is clear" must hold in at least one state. ✓ (After Step 11)
6. Before making `red_block_2` clear, `purple_block_2` must be on top of `orange_block_1`. ✓ (Step 8)
7. "orange_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in every state. ✓ (Initial state, Steps 11-12, never put on table)
8. "green_block_2 is on top of red_block_1" must hold in at least one state. ✓ (Step 2)
9. "green_block_1 is not clear" must hold in at least one state. ✓ (Initial state and Step 10)
10. If "green_block_1 is not clear" holds, then later on, "orange_block_1 is not clear" must hold. ✗ (Before step 15, `orange_block_1` might be clear)

Actually I need to make `orange_block_1` not clear after step 10. In the plan I outlined, after step 12, `orange_block_1` is on `red_block_1`, and it's clear.

For "orange_block_1 is not clear" to hold, I need to put a block on top of `orange_block_1`. But the only clear blocks at this point are `purple_block_1`, `green_block_2`, and `purple_block_2`. However, after unstacking `orange_block_1` from `red_block_2` and stacking it on `red_block_1`, I'm going to unstack `red_block_2` from `purple_block_1`. 

Actually I don't see any inconsistency. Let's continue checking:

10. If "green_block_1 is not clear" holds in a state s (which is the initial state), then at s or later, "orange_block_1 is not clear" must hold. ✓ (In the initial state, `orange_block_1` is indeed not clear as it has no block on top of it) Actually, it says "orange_block_1 is not clear" means there is a block on top of it. OK, so in the initial state, `orange_block_1` is clear. I need to make it not clear later.
11. Either `green_block_2` is on the table or `red_block_1` is on the table must hold in at least one state. ✓ (Step 4 and Step 6)
12. "purple_block_2 is not on top of red_block_1" must hold in at least one state. ✓ (Initial state and after Step 5)
13. If "purple_block_2 is not on top of red_block_1" holds in a state s (which is the initial state), then at s or later, "purple_block_2 is clear" must hold. ✓ (In the initial state, `purple_block_2` is not on top of `red_block_1`, and `purple_block_2` is clear after Setp 5)
14. "red_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in at least one state. ✓ (Initial state)
15. If "red_block_1 is not on the table" holds in a state s (which is the initial state), then at s or later, "you are holding purple_block_2" must hold. ✓ (Step 7)
16. "green_block_1 is not on top of purple_block_1" must hold in at least one state. ✓ (Initial state and every step)
17. If "green_block_1 is not on top of purple_block_1" holds in a state s (which is the initial state), then at s or later, both "orange_block_1 is not clear" and "green_block_2 is on top of red_block_1" must hold. ✗ (We've satisfied the second part with Step 2, but we haven't made `orange_block_1` not clear)

After step 10, the next step should be to place a block on top of `orange_block_1` to satisfy constraints 10 and 17. But I'm not sure that's possible in the plan I've outlined. Let me think more...

After Step 10, I'll be holding nothing. `purple_block_2` is on `green_block_1`. `purple_block_1` is on the table. `red_block_2` is on `purple_block_1`. `orange_block_1` is on `red_block_2`. `red_block_1` is on the table. `green_block_2` is on the table.

I can pick up `green_block_2` and stack it on `orange_block_1` to make `orange_block_1` not clear. Let's do that.

11. Pickup `green_block_2`. Now holding `green_block_2`.
12. Stack `green_block_2` on `orange_block_1`. Now `green_block_2` is on top of `orange_block_1` and `orange_block_1` is not clear.

Now I can continue with the plan:

13. Unstack `green_block_2` from `orange_block_1`. Now holding `green_block_2`.
14. Stack `green_block_2` on `red_block_1`. Now `green_block_2` is on top of `red_block_1`.
15. Unstack `orange_block_1` from `red_block_2`. Now holding `orange_block_1` and `red_block_2` is clear.
16. Stack `orange_block_1` on `green_block_2`. Now `orange_block_1` is on top of `green_block_2` and not on the table.
17. Unstack `red_block_2` from `purple_block_1`. Now holding `red_block_2`.
18. Put down `red_block_2`. Now `red_block_2` is on the table, which is our goal.
19. Pickup `purple_block_1`. Now holding `purple_block_1` and the second part of Constraint 4 is satisfied.

Let's check the constraints one more time:

1. "you are holding orange_block_1" must hold in at least one state. ✓ (Step 15)
2. Before holding `orange_block_1`, we must either hold `green_block_2` or make `green_block_1` clear. ✓ (Steps 1 and 15)
3. "red_block_2 is not on top of green_block_2" must hold in at least one state. ✓ (Initial state and every step)
4. If "red_block_2 is not on top of green_block_2" holds, then later on, "purple_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" and "you are holding purple_block_1" must both hold. ✓ (Steps 10 and 19)
5. "red_block_2 is clear" must hold in at least one state. ✓ (After Step 15)
6. Before making `red_block_2` clear, `purple_block_2` must be on top of `orange_block_1`. ✓ (Step 8)
7. "orange_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in every state. ✓ (Initial state, Steps 15-16, never put on table)
8. "green_block_2 is on top of red_block_1" must hold in at least one state. ✓ (Steps 2 and 14)
9. "green_block_1 is not clear" must hold in at least one state. ✓ (Initial state and Step 10)
10. If "green_block_1 is not clear" holds, then later on, "orange_block_1 is not clear" must hold. ✓ (After Step 12)
11. Either `green_block_2` is on the table or `red_block_1` is on the table must hold in at least one state. ✓ (Step 4 and Step 6)
12. "purple_block_2 is not on top of red_block_1" must hold in at least one state. ✓ (Initial state and after Step 5)
13. If "purple_block_2 is not on top of red_block_1" holds, then later on, "purple_block_2 is clear" must hold. ✓ (After Step 7)
14. "red_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in at least one state. ✓ (Initial state)
15. If "red_block_1 is not on the table" holds, then later on, "you are holding purple_block_2" must hold. ✓ (Step 7)
16. "green_block_1 is not on top of purple_block_1" must hold in at least one state. ✓ (Initial state and every step)
17. If "green_block_1 is not on top of purple_block_1" holds, then later on, both "orange_block_1 is not clear" and "green_block_2 is on top of red_block_1" must hold. ✓ (Steps 12 and 14)

This plan satisfies all the constraints. Let's summarize it:

1. Unstack `green_block_2` from `green_block_1`.
2. Stack `green_block_2` on `red_block_1`.
3. Unstack `green_block_2` from `red_block_1`.
4. Put down `green_block_2`.
5. Unstack `red_block_1` from `purple_block_2`.
6. Put down `red_block_1`.
7. Pickup `purple_block_2`.
8. Stack `purple_block_2` on `orange_block_1`.
9. Unstack `purple_block_2` from `orange_block_1`.
10. Stack `purple_block_2` on `green_block_1`.
11. Pickup `green_block_2`.
12. Stack `green_block_2` on `orange_block_1`.
13. Unstack `green_block_2` from `orange_block_1`.
14. Stack `green_block_2` on `red_block_1`.
15. Unstack `orange_block_1` from `red_block_2`.
16. Stack `orange_block_1` on `green_block_2`.
17. Unstack `red_block_2` from `purple_block_1`.
18. Put down `red_block_2`.
19. Pickup `purple_block_1`.

I'm also looking if we can optimize this plan and make it shorter, because this is a lot of steps.

Wait, let me re-add steps 11 through 16, because I'm not sure the order of things is correct there. After step 10:

- `purple_block_2` is on `green_block_1`
- `purple_block_1` is on the table (clear)
- `red_block_2` is on `purple_block_1`
- `orange_block_1` is on `red_block_2` (clear)
- `red_block_1` is on the table (clear)
- `green_block_2` is on the table (clear)

If I pick up `green_block_2` and stack it on `orange_block_1`, now `orange_block_1` is not clear, which satisfies constraints 10 and 17. From there, we need to get to our goal of having `red_block_2` on the table.

If I unstack `green_block_2` from `orange_block_1`, then unstack `orange_block_1` from `red_block_2`, I can't put `orange_block_1` on the table (Constraint 7). So I need to stack it somewhere.

At this point:
- `purple_block_2` is on `green_block_1` (not clear)
- `purple_block_1` is on the table (clear)
- `red_block_2` is on `purple_block_1` (clear)
- I'm holding `orange_block_1`
- `red_block_1` is on the table (clear)
- `green_block_2` is on the table (clear)

I can stack `orange_block_1` on `green_block_2`, `red_block_1`, or `red_block_2`. If I need to put `green_block_2` on `red_block_1` later, I might as well stack `orange_block_1` on `green_block_2`...

Actually wait. Constraint 17 isn't quite satisfied yet. It says that if "green_block_1 is not on top of purple_block_1" holds in a state s, then at s or later, both "orange_block_1 is not clear" and "green_block_2 is on top of red_block_1" must hold. We've made `orange_block_1` not clear with step 12, but we don't have `green_block_2` on top of `red_block_1` yet.

Let me revise:

After step 12:
- `purple_block_2` is on `green_block_1`
- `purple_block_1` is on the table (clear)
- `red_block_2` is on `purple_block_1`
- `orange_block_1` is on `red_block_2` (not clear)
- `green_block_2` is on `orange_block_1` (clear)
- `red_block_1` is on the table (clear)

I should stack `green_block_2` on `red_block_1` to satisfy constraint 17 fully. After I unstack `green_block_2`, `orange_block_1` is clear again. But that's OK because constraint 17 says "at s or later", so it's enough to have `orange_block_1` not clear for a while.

13. Unstack `green_block_2` from `orange_block_1`. Now holding `green_block_2`.
14. Stack `green_block_2` on `red_block_1`. Now `green_block_2` is on top of `red_block_1`. This also fully satisfies constraint 17.

Now, I want to make `red_block_2` clear:

15. Unstack `orange_block_1` from `red_block_2`. Now holding `orange_block_1` and `red_block_2` is clear.

Where should I stack `orange_block_1`? I can't put it on the table (Constraint 7), and I can't put it on `red_block_2` (as I want `red_block_2` to be clear). I can stack it on `green_block_2`:

16. Stack `orange_block_1` on `green_block_2`. Now `orange_block_1` is on top of `green_block_2` and not on the table.

Now, I can unstack `red_block_2` from `purple_block_1`:

17. Unstack `red_block_2` from `purple_block_1`. Now holding `red_block_2`.
18. Put down `red_block_2`. Now `red_block_2` is on the table, which is our goal.

I also need to hold `purple_block_1` to fully satisfy Constraint 4:

19. Pickup `purple_block_1`. Now holding `purple_block_1` and the second part of Constraint 4 is satisfied.

OK, this final revised plan is:

1. Unstack `green_block_2` from `green_block_1`.
2. Stack `green_block_2` on `red_block_1`.
3. Unstack `green_block_2` from `red_block_1`.
4. Put down `green_block_2`.
5. Unstack `red_block_1` from `purple_block_2`.
6. Put down `red_block_1`.
7. Pickup `purple_block_2`.
8. Stack `purple_block_2` on `orange_block_1`.
9. Unstack `purple_block_2` from `orange_block_1`.
10. Stack `purple_block_2` on `green_block_1`.
11. Pickup `green_block_2`.
12. Stack `green_block_2` on `orange_block_1`.
13. Unstack `green_block_2` from `orange_block_1`.
14. Stack `green_block_2` on `red_block_1`.
15. Unstack `orange_block_1` from `red_block_2`.
16. Stack `orange_block_1` on `green_block_2`.
17. Unstack `red_block_2` from `purple_block_1`.
18. Put down `red_block_2`.
19. Pickup `purple_block_1`.

I verified that this plan satisfies all the constraints.

Actually I'm going to rethink yet again if we can make the plan shorter, because 19 steps seems unnecessarily long.

Let's start again. We need to have `red_block_2` on the table. We want to minimize the number of steps.

From the initial state:
1. Unstack `green_block_2` from `green_block_1`. Now holding `green_block_2`. (Required for constraints 2, 8, 17)
2. Stack `green_block_2` on `red_block_1`. (Required for constraints 8, 17)

OK, now we have:
- `purple_block_1` is on the table (clear)
- `red_block_2` is on `purple_block_1`
- `orange_block_1` is on `red_block_2` (clear)
- `green_block_1` is on the table (clear)
- `purple_block_2` is on the table (not clear)
- `red_block_1` is on `purple_block_2` (not clear)
- `green_block_2` is on `red_block_1` (clear)

We can't unstack `orange_block_1` directly because of constraint 6, which says that before making `red_block_2` clear, `purple_block_2` must be on top of `orange_block_1`. But `purple_block_2` has `red_block_1` on top, which has `green_block_2` on top.

3. Unstack `green_block_2` from `red_block_1`. Now holding `green_block_2`.
4. Put down `green_block_2`. Now `green_block_2` is on the table. (This satisfies Constraint 11)

5. Unstack `red_block_1` from `purple_block_2`. Now holding `red_block_1`. (Required for constraint 15)

OK, now we are holding `red_block_1`. According to constraint 15, since `red_block_1` is not on the table, we must later on be holding `purple_block_2`. I'll put `red_block_1` on the table for now.

6. Put down `red_block_1`. Now `red_block_1` is on the table.

Now I should pick up `purple_block_2` to satisfy constraint 15:

7. Pickup `purple_block_2`. Now holding `purple_block_2`. (Required for constraint 15)

According to constraint 6, before making `red_block_2` clear, `purple_block_2` must be on top of `orange_block_1`. So I should stack `purple_block_2` on `orange_block_1`:

8. Stack `purple_block_2` on `orange_block_1`. Now `purple_block_2` is on top of `orange_block_1`. (Required for constraint 6)

According to constraint 4, since `red_block_2` is not on top of `green_block_2` (which has been the case from the start), later on, `purple_block_2` must be on top of `green_block_1` and I must be holding `purple_block_1`. I should move `purple_block_2` to `green_block_1`:

9. Unstack `purple_block_2` from `orange_block_1`. Now holding `purple_block_2`.
10. Stack `purple_block_2` on `green_block_1`. Now `purple_block_2` is on top of `green_block_1`. (Required for constraint 4)

According to constraint 17, since `green_block_1` is not on top of `purple_block_1` (which has been the case from the start), later on, both `orange_block_1` must not be clear and `green_block_2` must be on top of `red_block_1`. Both conditions aren't satisfied yet:

11. Pickup `green_block_2`. Now holding `green_block_2`.
12. Stack `green_block_2` on `orange_block_1`. Now `green_block_2` is on top of `orange_block_1` and `orange_block_1` is not clear. (Required for constraint 17)

13. Unstack `green_block_2` from `orange_block_1`. Now holding `green_block_2`.
14. Stack `green_block_2` on `red_block_1`. Now `green_block_2` is on top of `red_block_1`. (Required for constraint 17)

Now all the prerequisite constraints are satisfied. We can proceed to make `red_block_2` clear and then put it on the table:

15. Unstack `orange_block_1` from `red_block_2`. Now holding `orange_block_1` and `red_block_2` is clear. (Required for constraint 1, 5)

16. Stack `orange_block_1` on `green_block_2`. Now `orange_block_1` is on top of `green_block_2` and not on the table. (Required for constraint 7)

17. Unstack `red_block_2` from `purple_block_1`. Now holding `red_block_2`.
18. Put down `red_block_2`. Now `red_block_2` is on the table, which is our goal.

Finally, to fully satisfy constraint 4, I need to hold `purple_block_1`:

19. Pickup `purple_block_1`. Now holding `purple_block_1` and the second part of Constraint 4 is satisfied.

I'm sticking with these 19 steps. I've analyzed the problem very carefully, and I don't see a way to make the plan shorter while still satisfying all the constraints. This is my final plan:

1. Unstack `green_block_2` from `green_block_1`.
2. Stack `green_block_2` on `red_block_1`.
3. Unstack `green_block_2` from `red_block_1`.
4. Put down `green_block_2`.
5. Unstack `red_block_1` from `purple_block_2`.
6. Put down `red_block_1`.
7. Pickup `purple_block_2`.
8. Stack `purple_block_2` on `orange_block_1`.
9. Unstack `purple_block_2` from `orange_block_1`.
10. Stack `purple_block_2` on `green_block_1`.
11. Pickup `green_block_2`.
12. Stack `green_block_2` on `orange_block_1`.
13. Unstack `green_block_2` from `orange_block_1`.
14. Stack `green_block_2` on `red_block_1`.
15. Unstack `orange_block_1` from `red_block_2`.
16. Stack `orange_block_1` on `green_block_2`.
17. Unstack `red_block_2` from `purple_block_1`.
18. Put down `red_block_2`.
19. Pickup `purple_block_1`.

This plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal. I've verified it several times.
