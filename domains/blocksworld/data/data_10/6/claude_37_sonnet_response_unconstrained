Let's break down the problem:

We have a blocksworld with several blocks, and we need to create a plan to get "red_block_2 is on the table". 

The initial state is:
- "purple_block_1 is on the table"
- "green_block_1 is on the table"
- "purple_block_2 is on the table"
- "red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2"
- "green_block_2 is on top of green_block_1"
- "red_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1"
- "orange_block_1 is on top of red_block_2"
- "there is no block on top of red_block_1, i.e., red_block_1 is clear"
- "there is no block on top of green_block_2, i.e., green_block_2 is clear"
- "there is no block on top of orange_block_1, i.e., orange_block_1 is clear"
- "you are not holding any block"

The goal is:
- "red_block_2 is on the table"

Currently, red_block_2 is not on the table; it's on top of purple_block_1. And orange_block_1 is on top of red_block_2.

So, to achieve the goal, we need to:
1. Remove orange_block_1 from red_block_2.
2. Remove red_block_2 from purple_block_1 and place it on the table.

Let's develop the plan:

1. unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2 - This picks up orange_block_1 from red_block_2, making red_block_2 clear.
2. putdown orange_block_1 - We put orange_block_1 on the table, freeing our hand.
3. unstack red_block_2 purple_block_1 - We pick up red_block_2 from purple_block_1.
4. putdown red_block_2 - We put red_block_2 on the table, achieving our goal.

Let me check if this plan is valid in terms of the preconditions and effects of the actions.

Action 1: unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2
Preconditions:
- orange_block_1 is on top of red_block_2 (True)
- orange_block_1 is clear (True)
- Agent is not holding any block (True)
Effects:
- orange_block_1 is no longer on top of red_block_2
- red_block_2 is clear
- Agent is holding orange_block_1

Action 2: putdown orange_block_1
Preconditions:
- Agent is holding orange_block_1 (True from Action 1)
Effects:
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- orange_block_1 is clear
- Agent is not holding any block

Action 3: unstack red_block_2 purple_block_1
Preconditions:
- red_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1 (True)
- red_block_2 is clear (True from Action 1)
- Agent is not holding any block (True from Action 2)
Effects:
- red_block_2 is no longer on top of purple_block_1
- purple_block_1 is clear
- Agent is holding red_block_2

Action 4: putdown red_block_2
Preconditions:
- Agent is holding red_block_2 (True from Action 3)
Effects:
- red_block_2 is on the table
- red_block_2 is clear
- Agent is not holding any block

This achieves our goal of "red_block_2 is on the table". The plan is valid and optimal (I believe this is the shortest possible sequence of actions to achieve the goal).

Let's double-check by visualizing the states after each action:

Initial state:
- purple_block_1 is on the table with red_block_2 on top of it, and orange_block_1 on top of red_block_2.
- green_block_1 is on the table with green_block_2 on top of it.
- purple_block_2 is on the table with red_block_1 on top of it.
- Clear blocks: red_block_1, green_block_2, orange_block_1.
- Agent is not holding any block.

After unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2:
- purple_block_1 is on the table with red_block_2 on top of it.
- green_block_1 is on the table with green_block_2 on top of it.
- purple_block_2 is on the table with red_block_1 on top of it.
- Clear blocks: red_block_1, green_block_2, red_block_2.
- Agent is holding orange_block_1.

After putdown orange_block_1:
- purple_block_1 is on the table with red_block_2 on top of it.
- green_block_1 is on the table with green_block_2 on top of it.
- purple_block_2 is on the table with red_block_1 on top of it.
- orange_block_1 is on the table.
- Clear blocks: red_block_1, green_block_2, red_block_2, orange_block_1.
- Agent is not holding any block.

After unstack red_block_2 purple_block_1:
- purple_block_1 is on the table.
- green_block_1 is on the table with green_block_2 on top of it.
- purple_block_2 is on the table with red_block_1 on top of it.
- orange_block_1 is on the table.
- Clear blocks: red_block_1, green_block_2, purple_block_1, orange_block_1.
- Agent is holding red_block_2.

After putdown red_block_2:
- purple_block_1 is on the table.
- green_block_1 is on the table with green_block_2 on top of it.
- purple_block_2 is on the table with red_block_1 on top of it.
- orange_block_1 is on the table.
- red_block_2 is on the table.
- Clear blocks: red_block_1, green_block_2, purple_block_1, orange_block_1, red_block_2.
- Agent is not holding any block.

The goal "red_block_2 is on the table" is achieved after executing the given plan. The plan is valid and optimal.

So, the formal plan is:
1. unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2
2. putdown orange_block_1
3. unstack red_block_2 purple_block_1
4. putdown red_block_2
