Okay, let's see. The goal is to get red_block_2 on the table. Let me start by looking at the initial state.

So, the initial state has orange_block_1 on top of red_block_2, which is on top of purple_block_1. And red_block_2 is not clear because orange_block_1 is on it. But wait, the problem states that orange_block_1 is clear, so there's nothing on top of it. So the stack is orange_block_1 on red_block_2 on purple_block_1. Also, red_block_1 is on purple_block_2, and green_block_2 is on green_block_1. All the bases (purple_block_1, purple_block_2, green_block_1) are on the table.

The goal is to have red_block_2 on the table. Right now, red_block_2 is under orange_block_1. So to move red_block_2, I first need to remove orange_block_1 from on top of it. Because the preconditions for moving red_block_2 would require that it's clear. But since orange_block_1 is on top of it, I need to unstack orange_block_1 first.

So the steps might be: unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2, then putdown orange_block_1. Then I can pickup red_block_2 and put it down. Let's check the preconditions.

First action: unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. The preconditions for unstack are that orange_block_1 is on red_block_2, orange_block_1 is clear (which it is), and the arm is empty. Since the initial state says the arm isn't holding anything, that's okay. So unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2. Then the arm is holding orange_block_1, and red_block_2 becomes clear. Then I need to put down orange_block_1. So putdown orange_block_1. Now, after that, red_block_2 is clear and on purple_block_1. Now I can pickup red_block_2. But wait, is red_block_2 on the table? No, it's on purple_block_1. So to pick it up, I can't use the pickup action because pickup is only for blocks on the table. Instead, I need to unstack red_block_2 from purple_block_1. Wait, but red_block_2 is on purple_block_1. So to move red_block_2, since it's on another block, I need to unstack it. But to unstack red_block_2 from purple_block_1, the preconditions are that red_block_2 is on purple_block_1, red_block_2 is clear (which it is now, since orange_block_1 was moved), and the arm is empty. After putting down orange_block_1, the arm is empty. So yes, then unstack red_block_2 purple_block_1. Then the arm is holding red_block_2, and purple_block_1 becomes clear. Then I can putdown red_block_2 on the table. So putdown red_block_2. That should achieve the goal.

Wait, but let me check the steps again:

1. unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2
   - After this, holding orange_block_1, red_block_2 is clear.

2. putdown orange_block_1
   - Now, orange_block_1 is on the table, clear. Arm is empty.

3. unstack red_block_2 purple_block_1
   - Preconditions: red_block_2 is on purple_block_1, red_block_2 is clear (since orange was removed), arm is empty. Yes.

4. putdown red_block_2
   - Now, red_block_2 is on the table. Goal achieved.

So that's four actions. Is there a shorter way? Let's think. Let me see if there's any alternative.

Alternative approach: After unstacking orange_block_1, instead of putting it down, maybe stack it somewhere else. But the goal only requires moving red_block_2, so perhaps not necessary. But putting it down is the simplest.

Wait, but after unstacking orange_block_1, the arm is holding it. To proceed to unstack red_block_2, the arm must be empty. So yes, you have to putdown orange_block_1 first. So steps 1-4 are necessary.

Alternatively, can you stack orange_block_1 onto another block instead of putting it on the table? For example, maybe stack it onto purple_block_2 or something. But that would require that the target block is clear. For example, if after unstacking orange_block_1, you can stack it onto another block that's clear. Let's see: purple_block_2 has red_block_1 on top. So purple_block_2 is not clear. Red_block_1 is clear. So red_block_1 is on purple_block_2. So stacking orange_block_1 onto red_block_1 would require that red_block_1 is clear, which it is. But then after stacking, red_block_1 would have orange_block_1 on top, so red_block_1 is not clear anymore. But that's allowed. So maybe that's an option. Let's see.

So after step 1: unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2, holding orange_block_1. Then instead of putdown, do stack orange_block_1 red_block_1. Because red_block_1 is clear. Then, after stacking, the arm is empty. Then proceed to unstack red_block_2 from purple_block_1, then putdown. Let's count the steps.

1. unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2
2. stack orange_block_1 red_block_1
3. unstack red_block_2 purple_block_1
4. putdown red_block_2

Same number of steps. But does stacking orange_block_1 onto red_block_1 affect anything else? The problem's goal is only about red_block_2 being on the table; the other blocks can be in any state. So either approach works. But the plan length is the same. So either is acceptable as an optimal plan. However, perhaps the first approach (putting orange_block_1 on the table) is better because stacking requires another action's preconditions. Let me check.

The stack action requires that the target block (red_block_1) is clear, which it is. So step 2 would be stack orange_block_1 red_block_1. Then, after that, orange_block_1 is on red_block_1, which is okay. Then step 3: unstack red_block_2 from purple_block_1, then putdown. So four steps. Either way, four actions. So both are valid and optimal. But the problem says to provide an optimal plan with the shortest possible length. Since both approaches take four steps, either is acceptable. However, in the initial state, orange_block_1 is on red_block_2. If we stack it on red_block_1, maybe that's allowed. But the plan's length is the same. So either way.

But perhaps the first approach (putting orange on the table) is more straightforward and uses fewer steps in another way? No, same number. So either plan is acceptable.

But the user wants the optimal plan. So both are correct. Let me check if the initial plan is possible.

Original plan steps:

1. unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2
2. putdown orange_block_1
3. unstack red_block_2 purple_block_1
4. putdown red_block_2

Wait, wait. Wait, step 3 is unstack red_block_2 purple_block_1. But red_block_2 is on purple_block_1. So unstacking requires that red_block_2 is clear (which it is, after step 2) and that the arm is empty. After step 2, arm is empty. So yes. Then unstack red_block_2 purple_block_1. Then putdown red_block_2. So yes. That's four steps.

Alternatively, using stack instead of putdown:

1. unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2
2. stack orange_block_1 red_block_1
3. unstack red_block_2 purple_block_1
4. putdown red_block_2

Same length. So both are valid. So either is correct. Which one is better? The problem states that the plan must bring about the goal, but doesn't care about other blocks. So both are correct.

But maybe the user expects the first approach, as moving orange to the table. Let me see if there are any constraints I missed.

The problem statement says: "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then it's cut off. Oh, wait, the user pasted the problem, and maybe the original had more constraints, but here it's cut. Wait, looking back:

The user's message ends with "The task is to bring about the following situation: 'red_block_2 is on the table' A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then nothing follows. So maybe the user made a mistake in pasting, but in any case, the answer requires the plan.

So either approach is valid. Let's proceed with the first approach, which is:

unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2
putdown orange_block_1
unstack red_block_2 purple_block_1
putdown red_block_2

That's four actions. Let's check each step's preconditions:

Step 1: unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2. Preconditions: orange is on red_block_2, orange is clear (yes), arm is empty (yes). So allowed.

After step 1: arm holds orange, red_block_2 is clear.

Step 2: putdown orange_block_1. Precondition: holding orange. So allowed. After, orange is on table, clear. Arm is empty.

Step3: unstack red_block_2 purple_block_1. Preconditions: red_block_2 is on purple_block_1 (yes), red_block_2 is clear (yes, since orange was moved). Arm is empty (yes). So allowed. After, arm holds red_block_2, purple_block_1 is clear.

Step4: putdown red_block_2. Precondition: holding red_block_2. Yes. After, red_block_2 is on table. Goal achieved.

Yes, that's correct. So the plan is four steps. Are there any shorter plans?

Is there a way to do it in three steps? Let's see. For example, can we skip putting down orange_block_1?

Wait, after step1: holding orange_block_1. To unstack red_block_2, the arm must be empty. So you have to putdown or stack the orange_block_1 first. So steps 2 is necessary. So no way around that. So four steps is the minimal.

Thus, the plan I described is optimal.
