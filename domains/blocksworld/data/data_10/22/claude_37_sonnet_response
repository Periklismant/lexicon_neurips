Let's breakdown this problem. We need to come up with a plan to satisfy the goal of "you are holding black_block_3" while respecting all the constraints given.

First, let's understand the initial state:

1. brown_block_1 is on the table.
2. brown_block_2 is on the table.
3. green_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2.
4. black_block_1 is on the table.
5. black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1.
6. black_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1.
7. grey_block_1 is on top of green_block_1.
8. black_block_2 is clear.
9. black_block_3 is clear.
10. grey_block_1 is clear.
11. you are not holding any block.

Our goal is to make "you are holding black_block_3" true. This means we need to pick up black_block_3, which can only be done using the "unstack" action since black_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1 initially.

Let's check if we can directly unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1:
- black_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1 ✓
- black_block_3 is clear ✓
- you are not holding any block ✓

So, we can use the action "unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1". After this action, we'll be holding black_block_3, which is our goal.

But, we also need to ensure that all the constraints are satisfied. Let's check each one:

1. "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   After we unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1, this becomes true.

2. "If black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1 holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: you are holding brown_block_2."
   This means before we unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1, we must have a state where "you are holding brown_block_2" is true.

3. "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   This is trivially true in all states, as a block cannot be on top of itself.

4. "If green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1 holds in some state s, then expression At least one of the following conditions is true: you are holding black_block_1, green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1 must hold at s or at some state after s."
   Since "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" is true in all states, we need to ensure either "you are holding black_block_1" or "green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" is true at some point.

5. "At least one of the following conditions is true: there is no block on top of green_block_1, i.e., green_block_1 is clear, brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" must hold in at least one state.

6. "black_block_3 is not on top of black_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   This is already true in the initial state, as black_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1.

7. "If black_block_3 is not on top of black_block_1 holds in some state s, then expression At least one of the following conditions is true: brown_block_2 is not on the table, there is a block on top of brown_block_1, i.e., brown_block_1 is not clear must hold at s or at some state after s."
   Since "black_block_3 is not on top of black_block_1" is true in the initial state, we need to ensure either "brown_block_2 is not on the table" or "brown_block_1 is not clear" is true initially or at some point after.
   This is already true initially as black_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1, making brown_block_1 not clear.

8. "there is no block on top of brown_block_1, i.e., brown_block_1 is clear" must hold in at least one state.
   After we unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1, brown_block_1 becomes clear.

9. "If there is no block on top of brown_block_1, i.e., brown_block_1 is clear holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1."
   This means before brown_block_1 becomes clear, we must have a state where "black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" is true.

10. "there is a block on top of black_block_3, i.e., black_block_3 is not clear" must hold in at least one state.
    This means we need to place a block on top of black_block_3 at some point.

11. "If there is a block on top of black_block_3, i.e., black_block_3 is not clear holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: there is no block on top of green_block_1, i.e., green_block_1 is clear."
    Before we place a block on top of black_block_3, green_block_1 must be clear.

12. "grey_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
    This is already true in the initial state, as grey_block_1 is on top of green_block_1.

13. "If grey_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1 holds in some state s, then expression green_block_1 is on the table must hold at s or at some state after s."
    Since "grey_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1" is true in the initial state, we need to ensure "green_block_1 is on the table" is true initially or at some point after.

14. "brown_block_2 is not on top of grey_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
    This is already true in the initial state, as brown_block_2 is on the table.

15. "If brown_block_2 is not on top of grey_block_1 holds in some state s, then expression green_block_1 is on the table must hold at s or at some state after s."
    Since "brown_block_2 is not on top of grey_block_1" is true in the initial state, we need to ensure "green_block_1 is on the table" is true initially or at some point after.

16. "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_2" must hold in at least one state.
    This is already true in the initial state, as black_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1.

17. "If black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_2 holds in some state s, then expression At least one of the following conditions is true: green_block_1 is on the table, there is a block on top of black_block_2, i.e., black_block_2 is not clear must hold at s or at some state after s."
    Since "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_2" is true in the initial state, we need to ensure either "green_block_1 is on the table" or "black_block_2 is not clear" is true initially or at some point after.

18. "brown_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
    We need to place brown_block_2 on top of green_block_1 at some point.

Looking at these constraints, I can see that there's quite a sequence of steps we need to follow before we can achieve our goal. Let's plan them out:

1. First, we need to make green_block_1 clear. This means we need to unstack grey_block_1 from green_block_1.
2. Before we can remove black_block_3 from brown_block_1, we need to have a state where "you are holding brown_block_2" is true. This means we need to pick up brown_block_2, which requires removing green_block_1 from it first.
3. Before brown_block_1 becomes clear (which happens after we unstack black_block_3), we need to have a state where "black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" is true.
4. We need to place brown_block_2 on top of green_block_1 at some point.
5. We need to place a block on top of black_block_3 at some point. Before doing this, green_block_1 must be clear.

Let's try to come up with a plan that satisfies all these constraints:

1. unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1: This makes green_block_1 clear.
2. putdown grey_block_1: We put grey_block_1 on the table, freeing our hand.
3. unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2: Now brown_block_2 is clear.
4. putdown green_block_1: Now green_block_1 is on the table.
5. pickup brown_block_2: Now "you are holding brown_block_2" is true, satisfying constraint 2.
6. putdown brown_block_2: We release brown_block_2.
7. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1: We pick up black_block_2.
8. stack black_block_2 green_block_1: Now "black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" is true, satisfying constraint 9.
9. pickup brown_block_2: We pick up brown_block_2 again.
10. stack brown_block_2 green_block_1: This would involve putting brown_block_2 on top of black_block_2, but this doesn't align with our constraint about "brown_block_2 is on top of green_block_1".

Wait, I see a problem. Constraint 18 says "brown_block_2 is on top of green_block_1". But if "black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" (from constraint 9), we can't have brown_block_2 directly on top of green_block_1. 

Let's reconsider our plan:

Actually, I think I've misunderstood how to interpret the constraints. Let's re-read them:

1. "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   This is a straightforward requirement: at some point, black_block_3 should not be on top of brown_block_1.

2. "If black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1 holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: you are holding brown_block_2."
   This says: If the previous constraint is met, then before that happened, we must have a state where "you are holding brown_block_2" is true.

3. "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   This is always true, as a block cannot be on top of itself.

4. "If green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1 holds in some state s, then expression At least one of the following conditions is true: you are holding black_block_1, green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1 must hold at s or at some state after s."
   Since green_block_1 is always not on top of itself, this constraint says: we must have a state where either "you are holding black_block_1" or "green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" is true.

5. "At least one of the following conditions is true: there is no block on top of green_block_1, i.e., green_block_1 is clear, brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   This says: we must have a state where either "green_block_1 is clear" or "brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" is true.

Going through the remaining constraints with the same interpretation:

9. "If there is no block on top of brown_block_1, i.e., brown_block_1 is clear holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1."
   This says: If brown_block_1 becomes clear, then before that happened, we must have had a state where "black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" is true.

The critical constraints I see are:
- Before black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1, we must have a state where "you are holding brown_block_2" is true.
- Before brown_block_1 becomes clear, we must have a state where "black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" is true.
- We need to place a block on top of black_block_3 at some point, and before doing that, green_block_1 must be clear.
- We need to have brown_block_2 on top of green_block_1 at some point.

Given the initial state and these constraints, let's try to plan our actions:

1. unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1: This makes green_block_1 clear.
2. putdown grey_block_1: We put grey_block_1 on the table, freeing our hand.
3. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1: We pick up black_block_2.
4. stack black_block_2 green_block_1: Now "black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" is true, satisfying constraint 9.
5. unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2: Now brown_block_2 is clear. But wait, green_block_1 is now beneath black_block_2, so we can't unstack it. This doesn't work.

Let's think more carefully:

Given the initial state:

1. brown_block_1 is on the table.
2. brown_block_2 is on the table.
3. green_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2.
4. black_block_1 is on the table.
5. black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1.
6. black_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1.
7. grey_block_1 is on top of green_block_1.
8. black_block_2 is clear.
9. black_block_3 is clear.
10. grey_block_1 is clear.
11. you are not holding any block.

Since grey_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 and green_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2, we can only access grey_block_1, black_block_2, and black_block_3 initially.

Now, constraint 18 says "brown_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" must hold in at least one state. This is opposite to the initial state, where green_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2. To achieve this, we need to first make green_block_1 and brown_block_2 clear, then place brown_block_2 on top of green_block_1.

Constraint 2 says "If black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1 holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: you are holding brown_block_2." This means we need to hold brown_block_2 before we unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1.

Constraint 9 says "If there is no block on top of brown_block_1, i.e., brown_block_1 is clear holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1." This means we need to have black_block_2 on top of green_block_1 before we make brown_block_1 clear.

Let's try to come up with a coherent plan:

1. unstack grey_block_1 from green_block_1
2. putdown grey_block_1
3. unstack green_block_1 from brown_block_2
4. putdown green_block_1 on the table
5. pickup brown_block_2
6. putdown brown_block_2 (to satisfy constraint 2)
7. unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1
8. stack black_block_2 on green_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 9)
9. pickup brown_block_2
10. stack brown_block_2 on black_block_2
11. unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 1 and the goal)

But wait, constraint 18 says "brown_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" must hold in at least one state. In the above plan, brown_block_2 is on top of black_block_2, not directly on green_block_1.

Hmm, let's try a different approach:

1. unstack grey_block_1 from green_block_1
2. stack grey_block_1 on black_block_3 (to satisfy constraint 10, placing a block on top of black_block_3)
3. unstack green_block_1 from brown_block_2
4. putdown green_block_1 on the table
5. pickup brown_block_2
6. putdown brown_block_2 (to satisfy constraint 2)
7. unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1
8. stack black_block_2 on green_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 9)
9. unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_3
10. putdown grey_block_1
11. unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 1 and the goal)

But this still doesn't address constraint 18 about "brown_block_2 is on top of green_block_1".

Let me try one more approach, focusing on ensuring all constraints are met:

1. unstack grey_block_1 from green_block_1 (to make green_block_1 clear, satisfying the precondition for constraint 11)
2. stack grey_block_1 on black_block_3 (to satisfy constraint 10, placing a block on top of black_block_3)
3. unstack green_block_1 from brown_block_2
4. putdown green_block_1 on the table (to satisfy constraints 13 and 15)
5. pickup brown_block_2
6. stack brown_block_2 on green_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 18)
7. unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_3
8. putdown grey_block_1
9. unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1
10. pickup black_block_1 (to satisfy part of constraint 4)
11. putdown black_block_1
12. unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 1 and the goal)

Wait, constraint 9 still isn't satisfied. We need "black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" to be true before "brown_block_1 is clear", which happens after we unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1. But if we place brown_block_2 on top of green_block_1 (constraint 18), we can't then place black_block_2 on top of green_block_1 without moving brown_block_2 first.

Hmm, let's revisit the constraints more methodically:

1. "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   This happens after we unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1.

2. "If black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1 holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: you are holding brown_block_2."
   Before unstacking black_block_3, we need to have held brown_block_2.

8. "there is no block on top of brown_block_1, i.e., brown_block_1 is clear" must hold in at least one state.
   This happens after we unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1.

9. "If there is no block on top of brown_block_1, i.e., brown_block_1 is clear holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1."
   Before brown_block_1 becomes clear, we need to have had black_block_2 on top of green_block_1.

10. "there is a block on top of black_block_3, i.e., black_block_3 is not clear" must hold in at least one state.
    We need to place a block on top of black_block_3 at some point.

11. "If there is a block on top of black_block_3, i.e., black_block_3 is not clear holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: there is no block on top of green_block_1, i.e., green_block_1 is clear."
    Before placing a block on top of black_block_3, green_block_1 must be clear.

18. "brown_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
    We need to place brown_block_2 on top of green_block_1 at some point.

Given these constraints, let's try a different sequence:

1. unstack grey_block_1 from green_block_1 (to make green_block_1 clear, satisfying the precondition for constraint 11)
2. stack grey_block_1 on black_block_3 (to satisfy constraint 10, placing a block on top of black_block_3)
3. unstack green_block_1 from brown_block_2
4. putdown green_block_1 on the table (to satisfy constraints 13 and 15)
5. pickup brown_block_2
6. putdown brown_block_2 (to satisfy constraint 2)
7. unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1
8. stack black_block_2 on green_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 9)
9. pickup brown_block_2
10. stack brown_block_2 on black_block_2
11. unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_3
12. putdown grey_block_1
13. unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 1 and the goal)

But wait, we still don't have a state where "brown_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" (constraint 18).

Let's try one more time, with a more comprehensive approach:

1. unstack grey_block_1 from green_block_1 (to make green_block_1 clear, satisfying the precondition for constraint 11)
2. stack grey_block_1 on black_block_3 (to satisfy constraint 10, placing a block on top of black_block_3)
3. unstack green_block_1 from brown_block_2
4. putdown green_block_1 on the table (to satisfy constraints 13 and 15)
5. pickup brown_block_2
6. stack brown_block_2 on green_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 18)
7. unstack brown_block_2 from green_block_1
8. putdown brown_block_2 (to satisfy constraint 2)
9. unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1
10. stack black_block_2 on green_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 9)
11. unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_3
12. putdown grey_block_1
13. unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 1 and the goal)

This seems to satisfy all the critical constraints. Let's review:
- Before black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1 (which happens after step 13), we have held brown_block_2 (in step 5), satisfying constraint 2.
- Before brown_block_1 becomes clear (which happens after step 13), we've had black_block_2 on top of green_block_1 (in step 10), satisfying constraint 9.
- We've placed a block on top of black_block_3 (grey_block_1 in step 2), and before that, green_block_1 was clear (after step 1), satisfying constraints 10 and 11.
- We've had brown_block_2 on top of green_block_1 (in step 6), satisfying constraint 18.

Let's check the remaining constraints:

3. "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   This is always true, as a block cannot be on top of itself.

4. "If green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1 holds in some state s, then expression At least one of the following conditions is true: you are holding black_block_1, green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1 must hold at s or at some state after s."
   Since constraint 3 is always true, we need to ensure either "you are holding black_block_1" or "green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" is true at some point. We haven't addressed this yet.

5. "At least one of the following conditions is true: there is no block on top of green_block_1, i.e., green_block_1 is clear, brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   Green_block_1 is clear at several points in our plan, like after step 3 or after step 7, satisfying this constraint.

6. "black_block_3 is not on top of black_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
   This is true in the initial state, as black_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1, not black_block_1.

7. "If black_block_3 is not on top of black_block_1 holds in some state s, then expression At least one of the following conditions is true: brown_block_2 is not on the table, there is a block on top of brown_block_1, i.e., brown_block_1 is not clear must hold at s or at some state after s."
   Since "black_block_3 is not on top of black_block_1" is true in the initial state, we need to ensure either "brown_block_2 is not on the table" or "brown_block_1 is not clear" is true initially or at some point after. This is already true initially as black_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1, making brown_block_1 not clear.

12. "grey_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
    This is true in the initial state, as grey_block_1 is on top of green_block_1, not brown_block_1.

13. "If grey_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1 holds in some state s, then expression green_block_1 is on the table must hold at s or at some state after s."
    Since "grey_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1" is true in the initial state, we need to ensure "green_block_1 is on the table" is true initially or at some point after. This is satisfied in our plan after step 4.

14. "brown_block_2 is not on top of grey_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
    This is true in the initial state, as brown_block_2 is on the table, not on top of grey_block_1.

15. "If brown_block_2 is not on top of grey_block_1 holds in some state s, then expression green_block_1 is on the table must hold at s or at some state after s."
    Since "brown_block_2 is not on top of grey_block_1" is true in the initial state, we need to ensure "green_block_1 is on the table" is true initially or at some point after. This is satisfied in our plan after step 4.

16. "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_2" must hold in at least one state.
    This is true in the initial state, as black_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1, not brown_block_2.

17. "If black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_2 holds in some state s, then expression At least one of the following conditions is true: green_block_1 is on the table, there is a block on top of black_block_2, i.e., black_block_2 is not clear must hold at s or at some state after s."
    Since "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_2" is true in the initial state, we need to ensure either "green_block_1 is on the table" or "black_block_2 is not clear" is true initially or at some point after. This is satisfied in our plan after step 4, when green_block_1 is on the table.

We still haven't addressed constraint 4. Let's modify our plan:

1. unstack grey_block_1 from green_block_1
2. stack grey_block_1 on black_block_3
3. unstack green_block_1 from brown_block_2
4. putdown green_block_1 on the table
5. pickup brown_block_2
6. stack brown_block_2 on green_block_1
7. unstack brown_block_2 from green_block_1
8. putdown brown_block_2
9. unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1
10. stack black_block_2 on green_block_1
11. pickup black_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 4)
12. putdown black_block_1
13. unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_3
14. putdown grey_block_1
15. unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1

This should now satisfy all the constraints. Let's double-check:

- Constraint 1: "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
  Satisfied after step 15.
  
- Constraint 2: "If black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1 holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: you are holding brown_block_2."
  Satisfied at step 5.
  
- Constraint 3: "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
  Always satisfied.
  
- Constraint 4: "If green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1 holds in some state s, then expression At least one of the following conditions is true: you are holding black_block_1, green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1 must hold at s or at some state after s."
  Satisfied at step 11.
  
- Constraint 5: "At least one of the following conditions is true: there is no block on top of green_block_1, i.e., green_block_1 is clear, brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
  Green_block_1 is clear at several points in our plan, such as after step 1, after step 4, and after step 7.
  
- Constraint 6: "black_block_3 is not on top of black_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
  True in the initial state and throughout the plan.
  
- Constraint 7: "If black_block_3 is not on top of black_block_1 holds in some state s, then expression At least one of the following conditions is true: brown_block_2 is not on the table, there is a block on top of brown_block_1, i.e., brown_block_1 is not clear must hold at s or at some state after s."
  Satisfied in the initial state because brown_block_1 is not clear.
  
- Constraint 8: "there is no block on top of brown_block_1, i.e., brown_block_1 is clear" must hold in at least one state.
  Satisfied after step 15.
  
- Constraint 9: "If there is no block on top of brown_block_1, i.e., brown_block_1 is clear holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1."
  Satisfied at step 10.
  
- Constraint 10: "there is a block on top of black_block_3, i.e., black_block_3 is not clear" must hold in at least one state.
  Satisfied at step 2.
  
- Constraint 11: "If there is a block on top of black_block_3, i.e., black_block_3 is not clear holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: there is no block on top of green_block_1, i.e., green_block_1 is clear."
  Satisfied at step 1.
  
- Constraint 12: "grey_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
  True in the initial state and throughout the plan.
  
- Constraint 13: "If grey_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1 holds in some state s, then expression green_block_1 is on the table must hold at s or at some state after s."
  Satisfied at step 4.
  
- Constraint 14: "brown_block_2 is not on top of grey_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
  True in the initial state and throughout most of the plan.
  
- Constraint 15: "If brown_block_2 is not on top of grey_block_1 holds in some state s, then expression green_block_1 is on the table must hold at s or at some state after s."
  Satisfied at step 4.
  
- Constraint 16: "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_2" must hold in at least one state.
  True in the initial state and throughout the plan.
  
- Constraint 17: "If black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_2 holds in some state s, then expression At least one of the following conditions is true: green_block_1 is on the table, there is a block on top of black_block_2, i.e., black_block_2 is not clear must hold at s or at some state after s."
  Satisfied at step 4.
  
- Constraint 18: "brown_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
  Satisfied at step 6.

All constraints seem to be satisfied now, and our final goal of "you are holding black_block_3" is achieved after step 15.

Here's the final plan:

1. unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
2. stack grey_block_1 black_block_3
3. unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2
4. putdown green_block_1
5. pickup brown_block_2
6. stack brown_block_2 green_block_1
7. unstack brown_block_2 green_block_1
8. putdown brown_block_2
9. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
10. stack black_block_2 green_block_1
11. pickup black_block_1
12. putdown black_block_1
13. unstack grey_block_1 black_block_3
14. putdown grey_block_1
15. unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1
