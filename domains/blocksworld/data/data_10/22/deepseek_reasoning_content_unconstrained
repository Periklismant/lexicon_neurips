Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld problem. The goal is to have the robotic arm holding black_block_3. Let's start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

First, the initial setup:

- brown_block_1 is on the table, with black_block_3 on top of it. Since black_block_3 is clear, that means nothing is on top of it.
- brown_block_2 is on the table, with green_block_1 on top, and grey_block_1 on top of green_block_1. So grey_block_1 is clear.
- black_block_1 is on the table with black_block_2 on top, which is clear.
- The arm is empty.

So the current state has several towers. Let's note the positions:

Tower 1: brown_block_1 (table) → black_block_3 (clear)
Tower 2: brown_block_2 (table) → green_block_1 → grey_block_1 (clear)
Tower 3: black_block_1 (table) → black_block_2 (clear)

Our goal is to have the arm holding black_block_3. To do that, the arm needs to pick up black_block_3. But to pick it up, it must be on the table and clear. Wait, black_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1, not the table. So the precondition for pickup is that the block is on the table. But black_block_3 is on brown_block_1, so we can't use pickup. Instead, we need to unstack it from brown_block_1.

So the correct action is unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1. Let's check the preconditions for unstack:

- black_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1. Check.
- black_block_3 is clear. Yes, initial state says black_block_3 is clear. Check.
- The arm is not holding anything. Yes. So the unstack action is possible.

So the first step should be unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1. After that, the arm is holding black_block_3, which is the goal. So that's the plan? Just one action? But wait, let's check if there are any constraints. The problem mentions constraints, but the user didn't list any specific ones except the general domain constraints. Wait, the original problem statement says "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then there's nothing listed. Maybe that's a formatting error. Assuming there are no additional constraints beyond the usual action preconditions and effects.

So if the initial state allows us to unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1 immediately, then that's the optimal plan. Because that action directly achieves the goal in one step. Let's confirm:

Initial state:

- black_block_3 is on brown_block_1 (which is on table). Since brown_block_1 is under black_block_3, is brown_block_1 clear? No, because black_block_3 is on it. Wait, wait the initial state says:

Original state includes:

"black_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1"

and

"there is no block on top of black_block_3, i.e., black_block_3 is clear"

So brown_block_1 has black_block_3 on it, so brown_block_1 is not clear. But for unstacking black_block_3 from brown_block_1, the preconditions are:

- block b1 (black_block_3) is on top of b2 (brown_block_1)
- b1 is clear (yes)
- arm is empty (yes)

So unstack is allowed. The action would pick up black_block_3 from brown_block_1, which makes the arm hold it. That achieves the goal. So the plan is just one action: unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1.

Wait, but maybe there's a catch. Let's check the unstack action's effects. After unstacking black_block_3 from brown_block_1:

- black_block_3 is no longer on brown_block_1.
- brown_block_1 becomes clear (since nothing is on it now).
- The arm is holding black_block_3.

Which directly meets the goal of holding black_block_3. So the optimal plan is indeed just that single action. No need for any other steps. So that's the answer.
