Let's solve this blocksworld planning problem. The task is to have the robotic arm hold the black_block_3.

First, let's understand the initial state:
- brown_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_2 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2
- black_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
- black_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
- black_block_2 is clear
- black_block_3 is clear
- grey_block_1 is clear
- The robotic arm is not holding any block

The goal state is:
- The robotic arm is holding black_block_3

Let's think about the actions needed to achieve this goal. 

In the initial state, black_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1, and black_block_3 is clear. The robotic arm is not holding any block. 

According to the action preconditions for "unstack", I can unstack block b1 from block b2 if:
1. b1 is on top of b2
2. b1 is clear
3. The arm is not holding any block

So I can unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1 since all these conditions are met.

Let's check the actions one by one:
1. "pickup black_block_3" - Not valid because black_block_3 is not on the table, it's on top of brown_block_1.
2. "putdown black_block_3" - Not valid because the arm is not holding black_block_3.
3. "stack black_block_3 ..." - Not valid because the arm is not holding black_block_3.
4. "unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1" - Valid because black_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1, black_block_3 is clear, and the arm is not holding any block.

So the only valid action to start with is "unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1". After this action, the arm will be holding black_block_3, which is our goal.

The plan is:
```
unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1
```

Let's double-check:
After performing "unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1", the arm will be holding black_block_3, which is the goal. So this is a valid plan.

Actually, I've now realized that there's no need to check other actions or possibilities since we have a direct path to the goal. This is also an optimal plan since we only need one action to achieve the goal.

So the final optimal plan is:
```
unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1
```
