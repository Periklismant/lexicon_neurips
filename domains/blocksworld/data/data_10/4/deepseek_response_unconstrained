```
pickup orange_block_1
```
``` 

The initial state already has orange_block_1 on the table and clear, with no blocks on top of it. Since the robotic arm isn't holding anything initially, it can directly execute "pickup orange_block_1" to satisfy the goal of holding orange_block_1. This single-action plan is optimal as no shorter sequence exists.
