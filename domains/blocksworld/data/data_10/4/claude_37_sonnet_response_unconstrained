Alright, I'm given a Blocksworld problem where I need to find a plan to achieve the goal of "you are holding orange_block_1".

Let's first understand the initial state of the world:
- purple_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
- white_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- purple_block_2 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_2 is clear
- black_block_1 is clear
- orange_block_1 is clear
- white_block_1 is clear
- I'm not holding any block

My goal is to be holding orange_block_1.

To achieve this goal, I need to pick up orange_block_1 from the table. Let's check if I can do this using the "pickup" action:

For "pickup orange_block_1" the preconditions are:
(i) orange_block_1 is clear - Yes, there's no block on top of it.
(ii) orange_block_1 is on the table - Yes, it's on the table.
(iii) I'm not holding any block - Yes, I'm not holding any block.

All preconditions for the action "pickup orange_block_1" are satisfied. So I can perform this action.

The effects of "pickup orange_block_1" are:
(i) I'm holding orange_block_1.
(ii) orange_block_1 is no longer on the table.

After performing "pickup orange_block_1", the world state becomes:
- purple_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
- white_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- purple_block_2 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_2 is clear
- black_block_1 is clear
- white_block_1 is clear
- I'm holding orange_block_1

This satisfies the goal "you are holding orange_block_1". So the plan consists of just one action: "pickup orange_block_1".

Let me double-check: 
- The goal is to be holding orange_block_1.
- After the action "pickup orange_block_1", I'm holding orange_block_1.
- All preconditions for "pickup orange_block_1" are satisfied in the initial state.

Yes, the plan "pickup orange_block_1" is valid and optimal (since it achieves the goal in just one action).

So my final plan is:
```
pickup orange_block_1
```
