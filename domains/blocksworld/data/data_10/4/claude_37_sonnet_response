Alright, I am given a blocksworld planning problem. Let me understand the initial state, goal, and constraints.

Initial state:
- purple_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
- purple_block_2 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- purple_block_2 is clear
- black_block_1 is clear
- orange_block_1 is clear
- white_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

So in the initial state we have a tower (from bottom to top): purple_block_1, brown_block_1, yellow_block_1, white_block_1. And we have three individual blocks on the table: purple_block_2, black_block_1, and orange_block_1.

Goal:
- you are holding orange_block_1

Constraints (summarizing for clarity):
1. "orange_block_1 is not on the table" must be true at some point
2. If "orange_block_1 is not on the table" is true, then earlier, either "yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" or "black_block_1 is not on the table" must be true
3. At some point, either "purple_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" or "yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2" must be true
4. "orange_block_1 is not clear" must be true at some point
5. If "orange_block_1 is not clear" is true, then earlier, both "purple_block_2 is on top of black_block_1" and "brown_block_1 is on the table" must be true
6. "you are holding purple_block_1" must be true at some point
7. "purple_block_2 is not clear" must be true at some point
8. "purple_block_1 is not clear" must be true at some point
9. If "purple_block_1 is not clear" is true, then at the same time or later, "orange_block_1 is clear" must be true
10. "you are holding purple_block_2" must be true at some point
11. "black_block_1 is not on the table" must be true at some point
12. At some point, either "you are holding black_block_1" or "you are holding white_block_1" must be true
13. "white_block_1 is not on the table" must be true at some point
14. If "white_block_1 is not on the table" is true, then at the same time or later, "orange_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1" must be true

Now, let me think about how to approach this problem. The constraints are quite complex and interconnected. Let me try to understand the dependencies.

Constraint 4 says we need to have a block on top of orange_block_1, and constraint 5 says this can only happen after purple_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 and brown_block_1 is on the table.

Constraint 3 says at some point we need either "purple_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" or "yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2".

Constraint 1 says orange_block_1 needs to be off the table at some point, and constraint 2 says this can only happen after either "yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" or "black_block_1 is not on the table" is true.

Constraint 13 says white_block_1 needs to be off the table at some point, and constraint 14 says that after this, orange_block_1 should be on top of yellow_block_1.

Let me try to figure out a plan step by step.

First, let's handle the constraint about having a block on top of orange_block_1. This requires purple_block_2 to be on top of black_block_1 and brown_block_1 to be on the table.

So, let's first unstack the tower with purple_block_1, brown_block_1, yellow_block_1, and white_block_1.

1. unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1
2. putdown white_block_1
3. unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1
5. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1
6. putdown brown_block_1

Now we have:
- purple_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_2 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on the table
- All blocks are clear
- you are not holding any block

Now, let's make purple_block_2 be on top of black_block_1:

7. pickup purple_block_2
8. stack purple_block_2 black_block_1

At this point, we satisfy the conditions for constraint 5 (purple_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 and brown_block_1 is on the table). So now we can have a block on top of orange_block_1.

Let's choose to put white_block_1 on top of orange_block_1:

9. pickup white_block_1
10. stack white_block_1 orange_block_1

Now, we have:
- orange_block_1 is not clear (it has white_block_1 on top)
- black_block_1 is not clear (it has purple_block_2 on top)

Let's satisfy constraint 12 by holding white_block_1:

11. unstack white_block_1 orange_block_1
12. putdown white_block_1

Now let's handle constraint 6 by holding purple_block_1:

13. pickup purple_block_1
14. putdown purple_block_1

Now, let's handle constraint 10 by holding purple_block_2:

15. unstack purple_block_2 black_block_1
16. putdown purple_block_2

Now, let's handle constraint 3 by making yellow_block_1 be on top of purple_block_2:

17. pickup yellow_block_1
18. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2

This satisfies constraint 7 as well (purple_block_2 is not clear). Also, this satisfies the condition for constraint 2 ("black_block_1 is not on the table" was true when purple_block_2 was on top of it, which is before now).

Let's now satisfy constraint 8 by putting a block on top of purple_block_1:

19. pickup black_block_1
20. stack black_block_1 purple_block_1

Now purple_block_1 is not clear, so according to constraint 9, orange_block_1 should be clear, which it is.

Now, let's satisfy constraint 13 by making white_block_1 not on the table. And to satisfy constraint 14, after this, orange_block_1 should be on top of yellow_block_1.

21. pickup white_block_1
22. stack white_block_1 black_block_1

23. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2
24. putdown yellow_block_1

25. pickup orange_block_1
26. stack orange_block_1 yellow_block_1

Now orange_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, which satisfies constraint 14. Also, orange_block_1 is not on the table, which satisfies constraint 1 (and constraint 2 is satisfied because "black_block_1 is not on the table" was true earlier).

Now, to satisfy the goal, we need to hold orange_block_1:

27. unstack orange_block_1 yellow_block_1

Actually, I'm not convinced this plan is correct. Let me double-check again.

Constraints:

1. "orange_block_1 is not on the table" must be true at some point
   - Satisfied when we stack orange_block_1 on yellow_block_1 at step 26.

2. If "orange_block_1 is not on the table" is true, then earlier, either "yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" or "black_block_1 is not on the table" must be true
   - black_block_1 is not on the table" was true at steps 8-15, before orange_block_1 is off the table at step 26. This is satisfied.

3. At some point, either "purple_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" or "yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2" must be true
   - "yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2" is true at steps 18-23. This is satisfied.

4. "orange_block_1 is not clear" must be true at some point
   - This is true at steps 10-11, when white_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1. This is satisfied.

5. If "orange_block_1 is not clear" is true, then earlier, both "purple_block_2 is on top of black_block_1" and "brown_block_1 is on the table" must be true
   - "purple_block_2 is on top of black_block_1" is true at steps 8-15.
   - "brown_block_1 is on the table" is true from step 6 onwards.
   - Both are true before "orange_block_1 is not clear" at step 10. This is satisfied.

6. "you are holding purple_block_1" must be true at some point
   - This is true at step 13. This is satisfied.

7. "purple_block_2 is not clear" must be true at some point
   - This is true at steps 18-23 when yellow_block_1 is on top of it. This is satisfied.

8. "purple_block_1 is not clear" must be true at some point
   - This is true at steps 20-onward when black_block_1 is on top of it. This is satisfied.

9. If "purple_block_1 is not clear" is true, then at the same time or later, "orange_block_1 is clear" must be true
   - "purple_block_1 is not clear" is true from step 20 onwards.
   - "orange_block_1 is clear" is true from step 12 until step 25. Then it's stacked on top of yellow_block_1, so it's clear again.
   - So this is satisfied.

10. "you are holding purple_block_2" must be true at some point
    - This is true at step 15. This is satisfied.

11. "black_block_1 is not on the table" must be true at some point
    - This is true at steps 8-15 (when purple_block_2 is on top of it) and from step 20 onwards (when it's on top of purple_block_1). This is satisfied.

12. At some point, either "you are holding black_block_1" or "you are holding white_block_1" must be true
    - "you are holding white_block_1" is true at steps 9, 11, and 21. This is satisfied.
    - "you are holding black_block_1" is true at step 19. This is also satisfied.

13. "white_block_1 is not on the table" must be true at some point
    - This is true at steps 9-10 (when it's being held then stacked on orange_block_1) and from step 21 onwards (when it's stacked on black_block_1). This is satisfied.

14. If "white_block_1 is not on the table" is true, then at the same time or later, "orange_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1" must be true
    - "white_block_1 is not on the table" is true from step 21 onwards.
    - "orange_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1" is true at steps 26-27.
    - So this is satisfied.

Goal: "you are holding orange_block_1"
- This is true at step 27. The goal is satisfied.

Actually, I see an issue: I didn't account for the constraint that says if "white_block_1 is not on the table" is true, then at the same time or later, "orange_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1" must be true. This was the case between steps 9-10, but orange_block_1 wasn't on top of yellow_block_1 at that time. Let me fix this.

Let's revise the plan:

1. unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1
2. putdown white_block_1
3. unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1
5. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1
6. putdown brown_block_1

At this point:
- All blocks are on the table
- All blocks are clear
- You are not holding any block

7. pickup purple_block_2
8. stack purple_block_2 black_block_1

At this point:
- black_block_1 is not on the table
- purple_block_2 is on top of black_block_1

9. pickup purple_block_1
10. putdown purple_block_1

11. pickup white_block_1
12. stack white_block_1 orange_block_1

At this point:
- orange_block_1 is not clear
- white_block_1 is not on the table

13. unstack white_block_1 orange_block_1
14. putdown white_block_1

15. pickup yellow_block_1
16. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2

At this point:
- purple_block_2 is not clear
- yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2

17. pickup black_block_1
18. putdown black_block_1

19. pickup purple_block_2
20. putdown purple_block_2

21. pickup black_block_1
22. stack black_block_1 purple_block_1

At this point:
- purple_block_1 is not clear
- black_block_1 is not on the table

We need to make white_block_1 not on the table, and then ensure orange_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1:

23. pickup white_block_1
24. stack white_block_1 black_block_1

At this point:
- white_block_1 is not on the table
- black_block_1 is not clear

25. pickup orange_block_1
26. stack orange_block_1 yellow_block_1

At this point:
- orange_block_1 is not on the table
- orange_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1

27. unstack orange_block_1 yellow_block_1

Wait, I actually have a logical flaw in my constraint checking. Let me go through the plan one more time:

1. unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1
2. putdown white_block_1
3. unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1
5. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1
6. putdown brown_block_1

At this point:
- All blocks are on the table
- All blocks are clear
- You are not holding any block

7. pickup purple_block_2
8. stack purple_block_2 black_block_1

At this point:
- black_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 11)
- purple_block_2 is on top of black_block_1

9. pickup brown_block_1 (instead of purple_block_1, which has a constraint)
10. stack brown_block_1 orange_block_1

At this point:
- orange_block_1 is not clear (constraint 4)
- brown_block_1 is not on the table

But this violates constraint 5, which says if "orange_block_1 is not clear" is true, then earlier, both "purple_block_2 is on top of black_block_1" and "brown_block_1 is on the table" must be true. Brown_block_1 is not on the table at this point, so this constraint is not satisfied.

Let me fix this:

1. unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1
2. putdown white_block_1
3. unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1
5. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1
6. putdown brown_block_1

At this point:
- All blocks are on the table
- All blocks are clear
- You are not holding any block
- brown_block_1 is on the table (for constraint 5)

7. pickup purple_block_2
8. stack purple_block_2 black_block_1

At this point:
- black_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 11)
- purple_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on the table (for constraint 5)

Now we can make orange_block_1 not clear:

9. pickup white_block_1
10. stack white_block_1 orange_block_1

At this point:
- orange_block_1 is not clear (constraint 4)
- white_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 13)
- The conditions for constraint 5 are satisfied (purple_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 and brown_block_1 is on the table)

11. unstack white_block_1 orange_block_1
12. putdown white_block_1

13. pickup purple_block_1
14. putdown purple_block_1

This satisfies constraint 6 (you are holding purple_block_1).

15. pickup yellow_block_1
16. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2

At this point:
- purple_block_2 is not clear (constraint 7)
- yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2 (part of constraint 3)

17. unstack purple_block_2 black_block_1
18. putdown purple_block_2

Oops, but yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2, so we can't unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1. Let me fix this:

1. unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1
2. putdown white_block_1
3. unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1
5. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1
6. putdown brown_block_1

At this point:
- All blocks are on the table
- All blocks are clear
- You are not holding any block
- brown_block_1 is on the table (for constraint 5)

7. pickup purple_block_2
8. stack purple_block_2 black_block_1

At this point:
- black_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 11)
- purple_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on the table (for constraint 5)

9. pickup yellow_block_1
10. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2

At this point:
- purple_block_2 is not clear (constraint 7)
- yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2 (part of constraint 3)

11. pickup white_block_1
12. stack white_block_1 orange_block_1

At this point:
- orange_block_1 is not clear (constraint 4)
- white_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 13)
- The conditions for constraint 5 are satisfied (purple_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 and brown_block_1 is on the table)

13. unstack white_block_1 orange_block_1

Now we have "you are holding white_block_1," which satisfies constraint 12 (At some point, either "you are holding black_block_1" or "you are holding white_block_1" must be true).

14. putdown white_block_1

15. pickup purple_block_1
16. putdown purple_block_1

This satisfies constraint 6 (you are holding purple_block_1).

17. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2
18. putdown yellow_block_1

19. pickup purple_block_2
20. putdown purple_block_2

This satisfies constraint 10 (you are holding purple_block_2).

21. pickup black_block_1
22. stack black_block_1 purple_block_1

At this point:
- purple_block_1 is not clear (constraint 8)
- black_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 11)

Now, according to constraint 9, if "purple_block_1 is not clear" is true, then at the same time or later, "orange_block_1 is clear" must be true. Orange_block_1 is already clear, so this constraint is satisfied.

We need to make white_block_1 not on the table, and then ensure orange_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1:

23. pickup white_block_1
24. stack white_block_1 black_block_1

At this point:
- white_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 13)
- black_block_1 is not clear

According to constraint 14, if "white_block_1 is not on the table" is true, then at the same time or later, "orange_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1" must be true. So we need to make that happen:

25. pickup orange_block_1
26. stack orange_block_1 yellow_block_1

At this point:
- orange_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 1)
- orange_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1 (for constraint 14)

For constraint 2, if "orange_block_1 is not on the table" is true, then earlier, either "yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" or "black_block_1 is not on the table" must be true. We satisfied this because "black_block_1 is not on the table" was true from step 8 onwards.

27. unstack orange_block_1 yellow_block_1

At this point:
- you are holding orange_block_1 (the goal)

Let me quickly double-check all the constraints to ensure the plan is valid:

1. "orange_block_1 is not on the table" must be true at some point
   - Satisfied at steps 25-27 when orange_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1.

2. If "orange_block_1 is not on the table" is true, then earlier, either "yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" or "black_block_1 is not on the table" must be true
   - "black_block_1 is not on the table" is true from steps 8-18 and 21 onwards.
   - This is before orange_block_1 is off the table at steps 25-27.
   - This constraint is satisfied.

3. At some point, either "purple_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" or "yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2" must be true
   - "yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2" is true at steps 9-17.
   - This constraint is satisfied.

4. "orange_block_1 is not clear" must be true at some point
   - This is true at steps 11-13 when white_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1.
   - This constraint is satisfied.

5. If "orange_block_1 is not clear" is true, then earlier, both "purple_block_2 is on top of black_block_1" and "brown_block_1 is on the table" must be true
   - "purple_block_2 is on top of black_block_1" is true at steps 8-18.
   - "brown_block_1 is on the table" is true from step 6 onwards.
   - Both are true before "orange_block_1 is not clear" at steps 11-13.
   - This constraint is satisfied.

6. "you are holding purple_block_1" must be true at some point
   - This is true at step 15.
   - This constraint is satisfied.

7. "purple_block_2 is not clear" must be true at some point
   - This is true at steps 9-17 when yellow_block_1 is on top of it.
   - This constraint is satisfied.

8. "purple_block_1 is not clear" must be true at some point
   - This is true from step 21 onwards when black_block_1 is on top of it.
   - This constraint is satisfied.

9. If "purple_block_1 is not clear" is true, then at the same time or later, "orange_block_1 is clear" must be true
   - "purple_block_1 is not clear" is true from step 21 onwards.
   - "orange_block_1 is clear" is true from step 14 to step 25.
   - So at step 21, both conditions are true.
   - This constraint is satisfied.

10. "you are holding purple_block_2" must be true at some point
    - This is true at step 19.
    - This constraint is satisfied.

11. "black_block_1 is not on the table" must be true at some point
    - This is true at steps 8-18 (when purple_block_2 then yellow_block_1 are above it) and from step 21 onwards (when it's on top of purple_block_1).
    - This constraint is satisfied.

12. At some point, either "you are holding black_block_1" or "you are holding white_block_1" must be true
    - "you are holding white_block_1" is true at steps 11 and 13 and 23.
    - "you are holding black_block_1" is true at step 21.
    - This constraint is satisfied.

13. "white_block_1 is not on the table" must be true at some point
    - This is true at steps 11-13 (when it's being held and on top of orange_block_1) and from step 23 onwards (when it's stacked on black_block_1).
    - This constraint is satisfied.

14. If "white_block_1 is not on the table" is true, then at the same time or later, "orange_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1" must be true
    - "white_block_1 is not on the table" is true at steps 11-13 and from step 23 onwards.
    - "orange_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1" is true at steps 25-26.
    - So after step 23, "orange_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1" is true at a later step (25-26).
    - This constraint is satisfied.

Hmm, I realized I'm making a mistake with constraint 14. It says if "white_block_1 is not on the table" is true, then at the same time or later, "orange_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1" must be true. But "white_block_1 is not on the table" is true at steps 11-13 too, but "orange_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1" doesn't happen until steps 25-26.

I need to fix this. Let me revise the plan:

1. unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1
2. putdown white_block_1
3. unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1
5. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1
6. putdown brown_block_1

7. pickup purple_block_2
8. stack purple_block_2 black_block_1

9. pickup yellow_block_1
10. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2

At this point, black_block_1 is not on the table, which satisfies the condition for constraint 2. And yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2, which satisfies constraint 3 and 7.

11. pickup purple_block_1
12. putdown purple_block_1

This satisfies constraint 6.

13. pickup purple_block_2
14. putdown purple_block_2

Oops, I can't do this because yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2. Let me fix this:

1. unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1
2. putdown white_block_1
3. unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1
5. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1
6. putdown brown_block_1

7. pickup purple_block_2
8. stack purple_block_2 black_block_1

9. pickup yellow_block_1
10. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2

11. pickup purple_block_1
12. putdown purple_block_1

This satisfies constraint 6.

13. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2
14. putdown yellow_block_1

15. pickup purple_block_2
16. putdown purple_block_2

This satisfies constraint 10.

17. pickup black_block_1
18. stack black_block_1 purple_block_1

This satisfies constraint 8.

Now for constraint 5, we need brown_block_1 to be on the table (which it is) and purple_block_2 to be on top of black_block_1 (which it's not anymore). Let's rebuild that configuration:

19. pickup purple_block_2
20. stack purple_block_2 black_block_1

Oops, but black_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1 now, so we can't stack purple_block_2 on top of it. I need to reconsider the entire plan.

Actually, let's try a different approach. I'll first lay out all the blocks on the table, and then build the configurations required to satisfy the constraints.

1. unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1
2. putdown white_block_1
3. unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1
5. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1
6. putdown brown_block_1

At this point, all blocks are on the table and clear.

For constraint 5, we need "purple_block_2 is on top of black_block_1" and "brown_block_1 is on the table" before "orange_block_1 is not clear" becomes true. Brown_block_1 is already on the table, so we need to stack purple_block_2 on black_block_1:

7. pickup purple_block_2
8. stack purple_block_2 black_block_1

Now both conditions of constraint 5 are satisfied. We can now make orange_block_1 not clear:

9. pickup white_block_1
10. stack white_block_1 orange_block_1

At this point, we've satisfied constraint 4 and 5.

White_block_1 is not on the table, so according to constraint 14, we need "orange_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1" to become true at the same time or later. But orange_block_1 is under white_block_1 right now, so we can't move it yet.

Let's unstack white_block_1 first:

11. unstack white_block_1 orange_block_1
12. putdown white_block_1

Now we've satisfied constraint 12 (holding white_block_1).

Let's now make yellow_block_1 be on top of purple_block_2 to satisfy constraint 3 and 7:

13. pickup yellow_block_1
14. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2

Next, let's satisfy constraint 6 by holding purple_block_1:

15. pickup purple_block_1
16. putdown purple_block_1

Now, to satisfy constraint 10, we need to hold purple_block_2. But yellow_block_1 is on top of it. Let's first unstack yellow_block_1:

17. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2
18. putdown yellow_block_1

19. pickup purple_block_2
20. putdown purple_block_2

Now we've satisfied constraint 10.

Let's make purple_block_1 not clear to satisfy constraint 8:

21. pickup black_block_1
22. stack black_block_1 purple_block_1

This also satisfies constraint 11 (black_block_1 is not on the table) and constraint 12 (holding black_block_1).

At this point, we've satisfied many constraints, but we still need to handle constraint 14 (if "white_block_1 is not on the table" is true, then at the same time or later, "orange_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1" must be true) and constraint 1 ("orange_block_1 is not on the table" must be true at some point).

Let's make white_block_1 not on the table again:

23. pickup white_block_1
24. stack white_block_1 black_block_1

Now, to satisfy constraint 14, we need to make orange_block_1 be on top of yellow_block_1:

25. pickup orange_block_1
26. stack orange_block_1 yellow_block_1

This also satisfies constraint 1 (orange_block_1 is not on the table) and constraint 2 is satisfied because earlier, "black_block_1 is not on the table" was true.

Finally, to satisfy the goal, we need to hold orange_block_1:

27. unstack orange_block_1 yellow_block_1

Great! I think this plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal.

Let me double-check the crucial parts:

1. orange_block_1 is not clear at steps 9-11 (constraint 4)
2. purple_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 and brown_block_1 is on the table before orange_block_1 is not clear (constraint 5)
3. yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2 at steps 13-17 (constraint 3 and 7)
4. purple_block_1 is held at step 15 (constraint 6)
5. purple_block_2 is held at step 19 (constraint 10)
6. purple_block_1 is not clear from step 21 onwards (constraint 8)
7. black_block_1 is not on the table at steps 7-9 and from step 21 onwards (constraint 11)
8. white_block_1 is held at step 11 and black_block_1 is held at step 21 (constraint 12)
9. white_block_1 is not on the table at steps 9-11 and from step 23 onwards (constraint 13)
10. orange_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1 at steps 25-26, which is after white_block_1 is not on the table at step 23 (constraint 14)
11. orange_block_1 is not on the table at steps 25-27 (constraint 1)
12. black_block_1 is not on the table before orange_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 2)
13. You are holding orange_block_1 at step 27 (the goal)

Everything seems correct. Here's the final plan:

1. unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1
2. putdown white_block_1
3. unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1
5. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1
6. putdown brown_block_1
7. pickup purple_block_2
8. stack purple_block_2 black_block_1
9. pickup white_block_1
10. stack white_block_1 orange_block_1
11. unstack white_block_1 orange_block_1
12. putdown white_block_1
13. pickup yellow_block_1
14. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2
15. pickup purple_block_1
16. putdown purple_block_1
17. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2
18. putdown yellow_block_1
19. pickup purple_block_2
20. putdown purple_block_2
21. pickup black_block_1
22. stack black_block_1 purple_block_1
23. pickup white_block_1
24. stack white_block_1 black_block_1
25. pickup orange_block_1
26. stack orange_block_1 yellow_block_1
27. unstack orange_block_1 yellow_block_1
