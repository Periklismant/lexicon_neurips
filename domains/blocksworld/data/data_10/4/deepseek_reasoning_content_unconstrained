Okay, let's see. The goal is to have the robotic arm holding the orange_block_1. So, the initial state is that the arm isn't holding anything. Let me look at where orange_block_1 is. In the initial state, orange_block_1 is on the table and clear. So that's good because to pick it up, it needs to be clear and on the table. Wait, the preconditions for pickup are that the block is on the table, clear, and the arm isn't holding anything. Since orange_block_1 is on the table and clear, and the arm is empty, can we just do a pickup orange_block_1? That would directly achieve the goal. But wait, is there anything blocking that?

Wait, let me check the initial state again. The initial state says orange_block_1 is on the table and clear. So, yes, all the preconditions for pickup are met. So the plan would just be one action: pickup orange_block_1. That's the optimal plan because it's the shortest possible. But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me make sure.

Looking at the initial state again: white_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, which is on top of brown_block_1, which is on purple_block_1. But that's unrelated to orange_block_1. The other blocks like purple_block_2, black_block_1, and orange_block_1 are all on the table and clear. So the arm can just pick up orange_block_1 directly. There's no need to move any other blocks. So the optimal plan is just one step. That seems too simple, but maybe that's correct. Let me double-check the preconditions for pickup. The block must be on the table (which it is), clear (yes), and the arm must not be holding anything (also true). So yes, the action is valid. Therefore, the plan is simply to pickup orange_block_1.
