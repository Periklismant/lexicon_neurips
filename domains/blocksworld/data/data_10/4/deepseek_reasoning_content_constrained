Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to have the robot holding the orange_block_1. But there are a bunch of constraints that need to be satisfied along the way. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

First, the initial setup: There's a tower of purple_block_1 with brown_block_1 on it, then yellow_block_1, and white_block_1 on top. So, purple_block_1 (table) -> brown_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 -> white_block_1. Then, purple_block_2, black_block_1, and orange_block_1 are on the table, all clear. The robot isn't holding anything.

The goal is to hold orange_block_1. But since orange_block_1 is initially on the table and clear, the simplest plan would be just to pick it up. However, the constraints complicate things.

Let's list the constraints one by one to see what needs to be done:

1. Orange_block_1 must not be on the table in at least one state. So we need to move it somewhere else and possibly bring it back. But since the final goal is to hold it, maybe we can stack it somewhere and then unstack it later.

2. If orange_block_1 is not on the table (which has to happen), then earlier there must be a state where either yellow_block_1 is on white_block_1 or black_block_1 is not on the table. Hmm. So we need to either stack yellow on white or remove black from the table before moving orange_block_1.

3. At least one state must have either purple_block_1 on black_block_1 or yellow_block_1 on purple_block_2. So we need to create one of these two situations.

4. Orange_block_1 must have a block on top in some state. So we need to stack something on it.

5. If orange_block_1 is not clear (has a block on top), then earlier there must be a state where purple_block_2 is on black_block_1 and brown_block_1 is on the table. So we need to stack purple_block_2 on black_block_1 and have brown_block_1 on the table before that.

Wait, but brown_block_1 is initially on purple_block_1. So to have brown_block_1 on the table, we need to unstack the tower starting from white_block_1. Let's see. The initial tower is purple_block_1 -> brown_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 -> white_block_1. So to get brown_block_1 on the table, we need to unstack white from yellow, then unstack yellow from brown, then unstack brown from purple. But doing that might disrupt other things. Alternatively, maybe we can unstack brown from purple only after dealing with the tower.

6. Must hold purple_block_1 at some state. So we need to pick it up.

7. Purple_block_2 must have a block on top in some state. So stack something on it.

8. Purple_block_1 must not be clear (have a block on top) in some state. But initially, it has brown_block_1 on top. Wait, the initial state says brown_block_1 is on purple_block_1. So purple_block_1 is not clear in the initial state. So that condition is already satisfied. Wait, but the constraints might require that it's in the plan's states. But the initial state is part of the plan's states. So maybe this constraint is already satisfied by the initial state. Wait, the problem says "must hold in at least one state". The initial state has purple_block_1 not clear (since brown is on it). So maybe that constraint is already met. But wait, the planning problem starts from the initial state, so the initial state is part of the plan's states. So maybe some constraints are already satisfied. But let me check again.

Wait, the constraint is: "there is a block on top of purple_block_1, i.e., purple_block_1 is not clear". In the initial state, brown_block_1 is on purple_block_1, so purple_block_1 is not clear. So that constraint is already satisfied. So we don't need to do anything for that. But the robot might need to ensure that after some actions, this is still true. Wait, noâ€”the constraint just needs at least one state where it's true. So the initial state counts. So that constraint is already met. So maybe we don't need to do anything here. But the next part of the constraint is an implication: if in some state s, purple_block_1 is not clear, then in s or a subsequent state, orange_block_1 is clear. Since the initial state has purple_block_1 not clear, we must ensure that in the initial state or any state after, orange_block_1 is clear. But in the initial state, orange_block_1 is on the table and clear. So that's okay. But if during the plan, we make purple_block_1 not clear again (e.g., after putting something back on it), then we need to ensure that orange_block_1 is clear either then or later. Hmm. So perhaps we need to make sure that whenever we have purple_block_1 not clear, orange_block_1 is clear in that state or later. But since the initial state already satisfies the antecedent, the consequent must hold in that state or later. Since in the initial state, orange_block_1 is clear, that's okay. But if during the plan, we have another state where purple_block_1 is not clear, then in that state or after, orange_block_1 must be clear. So maybe when we stack something on purple_block_1 again, we need to ensure that orange_block_1 is clear then or after. But the final goal is to hold orange_block_1, which would require that in the final state, orange_block_1 is not on the table, but being held. So maybe during the plan, we need to handle that.

Moving on:

9. Must hold purple_block_2 at some state. So pick it up.

10. Black_block_1 must not be on the table in some state. So move it somewhere.

11. At least one of holding black or white in some state. So pick up either.

12. White_block_1 must not be on the table in some state. But initially, white is on yellow. So it's already not on the table. So this constraint is already satisfied. Wait, the initial state has white_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1, so it's not on the table. So the constraint is met. So no action needed here. But the implication: if white is not on the table (which is always true except if we put it down?), then orange must be on top of yellow at that state or later. Wait, the initial state has white not on the table. So according to the constraint, in the initial state or after, orange must be on top of yellow. But the final goal is to hold orange, so unless we stack orange on yellow and then unstack it. Hmm. So perhaps we need to stack orange on yellow at some point. Let's see.

So the constraints are a bit complex. Let's try to outline the steps needed, considering all constraints.

First, the goal is to hold orange_block_1. The simplest plan would be to pickup orange_block_1. But let's check constraints.

Constraints that affect this:

Constraint 1: orange_block_1 must not be on the table in at least one state. So we need to move it from the table and then back. But since the final state is holding it, that would mean that in the final state, it's not on the table. So maybe moving it once and then picking it up would satisfy this. Wait, when you pick up a block from the table, the block is no longer on the table. So the action 'pickup orange_block_1' would cause orange_block_1 to not be on the table. So in the state after pickup, orange is not on the table. So constraint 1 is satisfied. Then, the second constraint says that whenever orange is not on the table (which happens after pickup), there must be an earlier state where either yellow is on white or black is not on the table.

Wait, the implication is: if in any state s, orange is not on the table, then there's an earlier state where either yellow is on white or black is not on the table. So in our case, after we pick up orange, which makes orange not on the table, we need to have previously had either yellow on white or black not on the table. So before we can do 'pickup orange', we need to have satisfied one of those two conditions.

But initially, black is on the table. So to satisfy the condition, we need to have either stacked yellow on white (which they are not in the initial state) or moved black off the table. Let's see. The initial state has yellow on brown, which is on purple_block_1. White is on yellow. So yellow is under white. To stack yellow on white, we would need to unstack white from yellow, then stack yellow on white. But that's possible. Alternatively, moving black off the table (stack it somewhere) would also satisfy the condition.

But considering other constraints, maybe moving black off the table is necessary. Let's see:

Constraint 11: At least one state where holding black or white. So if we pick up black_block_1 (which is on the table and clear), then that's satisfied. Also, constraint 10 requires that black is not on the table in some state. So moving black off the table would satisfy both constraints 10 and 2 (if we do it before moving orange).

So perhaps the plan needs to first move black_block_1 off the table. Let's think: To move black, we can pick it up and stack it on another block. For example, stack black on purple_block_2. Then, black is not on the table, satisfying constraint 10 and the condition for constraint 2.

Then, when we later pick up orange, the condition for constraint 2 is met because black is not on the table in a previous state.

Also, constraint 3 requires that either purple_block_1 is on black or yellow is on purple_block_2. Suppose we stack yellow on purple_block_2. That would satisfy constraint 3. Alternatively, stack purple_block_1 on black. But purple_block_1 is initially on the table with brown on it. To stack purple_block_1 on black, we need to first unstack brown, then purple_block_1. But that might be more involved.

Alternatively, stack yellow on purple_block_2. To do that, we need to unstack yellow from brown. Since yellow is under white, we need to unstack white first, then unstack yellow, then stack yellow on purple_block_2.

Let's outline possible steps:

1. Unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1. Preconditions: white is clear (it is), and robot is empty. So unstack white from yellow. Now, holding white.

2. Putdown white. Now white is on table, clear. But this might not be useful. Alternatively, stack white somewhere else. Wait, but constraint 12 says that white must not be on the table in some state. But initially, it's not on the table. If we put it down, then it's on the table. But the constraint requires that in some state, white is not on the table. But the initial state already satisfies that. Wait, no. The constraint says "The following expression must hold in at least one state: white_block_1 is not on the table". Initially, white is on yellow, so not on the table. So constraint 12 is already satisfied. The implication is that if white is not on the table (which is true in the initial state and after unstacking), then in that state or later, orange is on top of yellow. Wait, the implication is: If in some state s, white is not on the table, then in s or later, orange is on top of yellow. So during the plan, whenever white is not on the table, we need to have orange on yellow at that state or later.

But initially, white is not on the table. So we need to have orange on yellow at some point after the initial state. So during the plan, we need to stack orange on yellow. Then, even if we put white back on the table later, the constraint would still be satisfied because in the state where white was not on the table (initial state), we eventually have orange on yellow.

So to satisfy this, we need to stack orange on yellow at some point. Then unstack it to pick up orange for the goal.

But stacking orange on yellow would require that we have orange in hand and yellow is clear. Let's see. Initially, yellow has white on top. So first, unstack white from yellow, then putdown white. Then yellow is clear. Then pick up orange (which is on the table), stack it on yellow. Then, to get orange back, we need to unstack it from yellow. But the goal is to hold orange, so after stacking, we need to unstack it again.

But this seems complicated, but necessary to satisfy the implication from constraint 12.

So the plan might involve:

- Unstack white from yellow.

- Putdown white (now white is on the table, violating constraint 12's implication unless we stack orange on yellow later).

But according to the implication, whenever white is not on the table (like in the initial state), we need to have orange on yellow at some point after. So stacking orange on yellow later would satisfy that.

Alternatively, keep white not on the table. For example, stack white somewhere else. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, after unstacking white from yellow, stack white on another block. For instance, stack white on purple_block_2. Then, white remains not on the table. Then, the implication requires that in that state (where white is not on the table) or later, orange is on yellow. So stacking orange on yellow after that would satisfy it.

But this might require more steps. Let's see.

But let's think about all the constraints again to make sure we hit all of them.

Constraints:

3. At least one of purple_block_1 on black or yellow on purple_block_2. Let's choose yellow on purple_block_2. To do that, after unstacking white and yellow, we can stack yellow on purple_block_2.

Constraint 7: purple_block_2 must have a block on top. Stacking yellow on purple_block_2 would satisfy this.

Constraint 9: must hold purple_block_2. So perhaps pick it up at some point. But if we stack yellow on purple_block_2, we can unstack it later to hold purple_block_2.

Alternatively, stack something else on purple_block_2. For example, stack black on purple_block_2, which would also satisfy constraint 10 (black not on table) and constraint 3 if we stack yellow elsewhere. Wait, no. Constraint 3 requires either purple_block_1 on black or yellow on purple_block_2. If we stack black on purple_block_2, that doesn't directly contribute to constraint 3. So maybe stack yellow on purple_block_2.

So steps could be:

1. Unstack white from yellow.

2. Putdown white (but this might not be ideal due to constraint 12's implication).

Alternatively, stack white on another block.

But let's proceed.

Suppose:

1. Unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1. Now holding white.

2. Stack white_block_1 on purple_block_2. Now purple_block_2 has white on top. This satisfies constraint 7 (purple_block_2 not clear). But white is now on purple_block_2. Then, purple_block_2 is not clear. Also, constraint 3 requires yellow on purple_block_2, but this is white. So that doesn't satisfy constraint 3. So maybe stacking yellow on purple_block_2.

But to get yellow, we need to unstack it from brown_block_1, which is under yellow. So after unstacking white, we can unstack yellow from brown.

So:

1. Unstack white from yellow.

2. Unstack yellow from brown.

3. Stack yellow on purple_block_2.

Now, constraint 3 is satisfied (yellow on purple_block_2).

Now, to get back to orange, we need to handle other constraints.

Constraint 4: orange must have a block on top in some state. So stack something on orange. But orange is initially on the table. So we need to pick up another block and stack it on orange.

But stacking on orange requires that orange is clear. So after possibly moving orange, but the goal is to hold it. So perhaps stack something on orange after picking it up and putting it down again. But that complicates things.

Alternatively, stack another block on orange while it's on the table. But to do that, we need to pick up that block and stack it on orange. For example, after moving black_block_1, stack it on orange.

But let's outline the steps:

- Move black_block_1 from table to somewhere else to satisfy constraint 10 and 2.

- Stack black on orange (so orange is not clear, satisfying constraint 4). But then, when we unstack black from orange, we can pick up orange.

But then, constraint 5 says that if orange is not clear (has a block on top), then earlier there must be a state where purple_block_2 is on black_block_1 and brown is on the table.

Wait, constraint 5: If in some state s, orange is not clear (i.e., has a block on top), then there must be an earlier state where purple_block_2 is on black and brown is on the table.

So if we stack black on orange (making orange not clear), then prior to that, we need to have a state where purple_block_2 is on black and brown is on the table.

But purple_block_2 is initially on the table. To have purple_block_2 on black, we need to stack purple_block_2 on black. So:

Steps needed for constraint 5 when we stack on orange:

Before stacking on orange, need to:

a. Stack purple_block_2 on black.

b. Ensure brown is on the table.

But brown is initially on purple_block_1. To get brown on the table, we need to unstack the tower from purple_block_1.

The initial tower is purple_block_1 -> brown -> yellow -> white. After step 1 and 2 above (unstack white and yellow), brown is still on purple_block_1. To unstack brown from purple_block_1, since there's nothing on brown now (since yellow was unstacked), we can unstack brown from purple_block_1 and put it on the table. Then brown is on the table.

So:

3. Unstack brown from purple_block_1. Now holding brown.

4. Putdown brown. Now brown is on the table.

Now, with brown on the table, we can proceed to stack purple_block_2 on black_block_1.

But black_block_1 is on the table. So:

5. Pickup purple_block_2 (must be clear, which it is after step 2 where we stacked yellow on it? Wait, no. If after step 2 we stacked yellow on purple_block_2, then purple_block_2 is not clear. So can't pick up purple_block_2. Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's re-examine.

Wait, in step 2, after unstacking yellow from brown, we stack yellow on purple_block_2. So purple_block_2 has yellow on top. So purple_block_2 is not clear. Then, to stack purple_block_2 on black, we need to first unstack yellow from purple_block_2. But that's more steps.

Alternatively, maybe stack purple_block_2 on black_block_1 before stacking yellow on it.

Alternatively, perhaps choose a different approach for constraint 3. Suppose we stack purple_block_1 on black_block_1. To do that:

But purple_block_1 is initially on the table with brown on it. So to stack purple_block_1 on black_block_1, we need to first unstack brown from purple_block_1.

So steps:

1. Unstack white from yellow.

2. Unstack yellow from brown.

3. Unstack brown from purple_block_1.

4. Putdown brown.

5. Pickup purple_block_1 (which is now clear).

6. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_1. Now, purple_block_1 is on black, which is on the table. This satisfies constraint 3 (purple on black). Also, constraint 8 (purple_block_1 not clear) is already satisfied by the initial state, but here it's again not clear. Also, constraint 6 requires holding purple_block_1, which is done in step 5.

But then, after stacking purple on black, we need to handle other constraints. Let's see.

But this approach might be longer. Let's see which path is shorter.

Alternatively, to satisfy constraint 3 by stacking yellow on purple_block_2. Let's try that path.

So steps:

1. Unstack white from yellow. Now holding white.

2. Unstack yellow from brown. Now holding yellow.

3. Stack yellow on purple_block_2. Now, purple_block_2 has yellow, satisfying constraint 3 and 7 (purple_block_2 not clear).

Now, we have purple_block_2 with yellow on top. Also, brown is on purple_block_1, which is clear (since we unstacked yellow from brown, which was on purple_block_1). Wait, no: brown was on purple_block_1. After unstacking yellow from brown, brown is still on purple_block_1, and now clear (since yellow was removed). So brown is on purple_block_1 and clear.

Now, to satisfy constraint 5, we need to stack something on orange_block_1. Let's say we stack black_block_1 on orange_block_1. To do that:

4. Pickup black_block_1 (clear, on table).

5. Stack black on orange. Now, orange has black on top, not clear. This satisfies constraint 4.

But before this, we need to have purple_block_2 on black and brown on the table. Wait, constraint 5 says: if orange is not clear (after step 5), then there must be an earlier state where purple_block_2 is on black and brown is on the table. So prior to step 4-5, we need to have those conditions.

But currently, purple_block_2 has yellow on it, not on black. So how to get purple_block_2 on black?

Alternatively, perhaps stack purple_block_2 on black_block_1 before stacking black on orange.

So steps:

4. Unstack yellow from purple_block_2 (since after step 3, yellow is on purple_block_2).

Wait, but to unstack yellow from purple_block_2, we need to be holding nothing, and yellow is clear. But after step 3, yellow is on purple_block_2. So yellow is clear? No, because we stacked it there. So purple_block_2 has yellow, so yellow is on top. Therefore, yellow is clear (since nothing is on yellow). So we can unstack yellow from purple_block_2.

4. Unstack yellow from purple_block_2. Now holding yellow.

5. Putdown yellow. Now yellow is on table.

6. Pickup purple_block_2 (now clear, since yellow was unstacked).

7. Stack purple_block_2 on black_block_1. Now, purple_block_2 is on black. This satisfies the condition for constraint 5 (purple_block_2 on black). Also, brown needs to be on the table. Currently, brown is on purple_block_1. So we need to unstack brown from purple_block_1.

8. Unstack brown from purple_block_1. Now holding brown.

9. Putdown brown. Now brown is on the table.

Now, we have purple_block_2 on black, and brown on table. So this satisfies the precondition for constraint 5 when we stack something on orange.

Then, proceed to stack black on orange:

10. Pickup black_block_1. But wait, black is under purple_block_2. So to pick up black, we need to unstack purple_block_2 from black.

Wait, but black is on the table, and purple_block_2 is stacked on it. So to pick up black, we need to unstack purple_block_2 first. But purple_block_2 is on black. So unstack purple_block_2 from black:

10. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1. Now holding purple_block_2.

11. Putdown purple_block_2. Now it's on the table.

12. Pickup black_block_1 (now clear).

13. Stack black on orange. Now, orange has black on top. This satisfies constraint 4. Also, since we did steps 7 and 9 (purple on black and brown on table) before step 13, constraint 5 is satisfied.

Now, to pick up orange_block_1, we need to unstack black from orange:

14. Unstack black from orange. Now holding black.

15. Putdown black. Now black is on table.

16. Pickup orange_block_1. Now holding orange, which is the goal.

But this seems very long. Let's count the steps: 16 actions. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, after stacking purple_block_2 on black (step 7) and putting brown on table (step 9), maybe instead of stacking black on orange, use another block. But constraint 4 requires something on orange.

Alternatively, stack purple_block_2 on orange. But after step 7, purple_block_2 is on black. To move it to orange, we'd need to unstack it from black, then stack on orange. But that's more steps.

Alternatively, use white_block_1. After step 1, white was put down. If we stacked white somewhere else, maybe on orange.

But let's think again. The current plan is getting too long. Let's see if there's a shorter path.

Alternative approach:

- Satisfy constraint 2 by moving black off the table.

- Satisfy constraint 3 by stacking yellow on purple_block_2.

- Satisfy constraint 4 by stacking black on orange.

- Ensure all other constraints.

Let's try:

1. Unstack white from yellow. Now holding white.

2. Putdown white. Now white is on table.

3. Unstack yellow from brown. Now holding yellow.

4. Stack yellow on purple_block_2. Satisfies constraint 3 and 7.

5. Pickup black_block_1. Now holding black.

6. Stack black on orange. Now, orange has black on top (constraint 4). But before this, we need to have purple_block_2 on black and brown on table (constraint 5). But currently, purple_block_2 is on yellow, which is on purple_block_2. So no. So this approach doesn't satisfy constraint 5.

Thus, need to first get purple_block_2 on black and brown on table before stacking on orange.

Another approach:

1. Unstack white from yellow. Hold white.

2. Stack white on purple_block_2. Now, purple_block_2 has white (constraint 7).

3. Unstack yellow from brown. Hold yellow.

4. Stack yellow on purple_block_2. But purple_block_2 has white, so we can't stack yellow on it unless we unstack white first. This seems complicated.

Alternatively:

1. Unstack white from yellow. Hold white.

2. Unstack yellow from brown. Hold yellow.

3. Stack yellow on purple_block_2. Satisfy constraint 3 and 7.

4. Unstack brown from purple_block_1. Hold brown.

5. Putdown brown. Now brown is on table.

6. Pickup purple_block_2. (But it's under yellow, so can't. Need to unstack yellow first.)

Hmm. This is getting too tangled. Maybe I need to outline all required steps considering all constraints.

Let's list all constraints and their required actions:

Constraint 1: Orange not on table. Achieved by picking it up.

Constraint 2: Before orange is not on table, either yellow on white or black not on table. So either stack yellow on white or move black off table before picking orange.

Constraint 3: purple on black or yellow on purple2.

Constraint 4: something on orange.

Constraint 5: if something is on orange, then earlier purple2 on black and brown on table.

Constraint 6: hold purple1.

Constraint 7: something on purple2.

Constraint 8: already satisfied.

Constraint 9: hold purple2.

Constraint 10: black not on table.

Constraint 11: hold black or white.

Constraint 12: already satisfied.

Constraint 12's implication: whenever white is not on table (which is always true except when we put it down), orange must be on yellow at that state or later. So we need to stack orange on yellow at some point.

Putting this all together:

Steps:

1. Unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1. Now holding white. (This allows us to access yellow and brown.)

2. Stack white_block_1 on purple_block_2. Now, purple2 has white (satisfies constraint 7). Also, white is not on table (still satisfies constraint 12's implication if we later stack orange on yellow).

3. Unstack yellow_block_1 from brown_block_1. Now holding yellow.

4. Stack yellow_block_1 on purple_block_2. Now, purple2 has white and yellow? No, you can't stack a block on another block that's already holding something. So step 2 stacked white on purple2. To stack yellow on purple2, need to unstack white first. So this approach is wrong.

Alternative:

1. Unstack white from yellow.

2. Putdown white. Now white is on table. This makes white on table, which affects constraint 12's implication. Because now, in this state, white is on the table. But the constraint says that if in some state s, white is not on the table, then in s or later, orange is on yellow. So putting white on the table doesn't trigger the implication. However, initially, white was not on the table, so we still need to stack orange on yellow at some point.

But since we put white on the table, the implication is not triggered anymore. But the initial state's condition (white not on table) requires that eventually orange is on yellow. So we must stack orange on yellow at some point after the initial state.

So proceeding:

1. Unstack white from yellow. Now holding white.

2. Putdown white. Now white is on table.

3. Unstack yellow from brown. Now holding yellow.

4. Stack yellow on purple2. Satisfies constraint 3 and 7.

5. Unstack brown from purple1. Now holding brown.

6. Putdown brown. Now brown is on table. Satisfies part of constraint 5 (brown on table).

7. Pickup purple2. Wait, purple2 has yellow on it. So to pick up purple2, need to unstack yellow first.

8. Unstack yellow from purple2. Now holding yellow.

9. Stack yellow on white. Now, yellow is on white (satisfies constraint 2's condition for yellow on white). White is on table. So when we later pick up orange (making it not on table), this condition is met.

10. Now, purple2 is clear. Pickup purple2. Now holding purple2. Satisfies constraint 9.

11. Stack purple2 on black. Now, purple2 is on black, which is on table. So black is not on table (satisfies constraint 10). Also, purple2 on black is part of constraint 5's requirement.

12. Now, brown is on table (from step 6), purple2 is on black. So constraint 5's conditions are met.

13. Pickup orange_block_1. Wait, but orange is on table and clear. But to pick it up, we need to have constraints in order. But according to constraint 2, since we will make orange not on table (step 13), we need to have either yellow on white (step 9) or black not on table (step 11). Both are satisfied. So step 13 is allowed.

14. Now, we need to stack something on orange (constraint 4). But we are holding orange. So perhaps stack it on another block and then unstack it.

15. Stack orange on yellow (which is on white). Now, orange is on yellow (satisfies constraint 12's implication). Also, orange is not on table (satisfies constraint 1). But wait, stacking orange on yellow would require that yellow is clear. Yellow is on white, so to stack orange on yellow, yellow must be clear. But after step 9, yellow is on white. So yellow is clear. So yes.

16. Unstack orange from yellow. Now holding orange. This is the goal.

But wait, step 13 already picked up orange. Why stack and unstack again? Because we need to satisfy constraint 4: there must be a state where orange has a block on top. But in this plan, after stacking orange on yellow, nothing is on top of orange. So that doesn't satisfy constraint 4. So we need to stack something on orange.

Alternatively, after picking up orange (step 13), put it down and stack something on it.

But this is getting too long. Let's see:

Alternative approach after step 12:

13. Pickup black_block_1 (which is under purple2). Wait, can't. Because black is under purple2. So need to unstack purple2 from black.

13. Unstack purple2 from black. Now holding purple2.

14. Putdown purple2. Now black is clear.

15. Pickup black. Now holding black.

16. Stack black on orange. Now, orange has black on top (satisfies constraint 4). Now, constraint 5 requires that before this, there's a state where purple2 is on black and brown is on table. Which happened in step 11 (purple2 on black) and step 6 (brown on table). So yes.

17. Unstack black from orange. Now holding black.

18. Putdown black.

19. Pickup orange. Now holding orange, which is the goal.

This plan would have many steps, but let's check all constraints:

- Constraint 1: orange is not on table in step 13 (when picked up), but then put back in step 16. Wait, no. Let me re-examine steps:

Wait, steps after step 12 (purple2 on black):

13. Unstack purple2 from black â†’ holding purple2.

14. Putdown purple2.

15. Pickup black.

16. Stack black on orange â†’ orange has black on top.

17. Unstack black from orange â†’ holding black.

18. Putdown black.

19. Pickup orange.

So in step 16, orange is on the table with black on top. So orange is not clear (satisfies constraint 4). Then, when we unstack black, orange is clear again, and finally picked up.

But this plan involves many steps. Let's count them:

1. Unstack white from yellow.

2. Putdown white.

3. Unstack yellow from brown.

4. Stack yellow on purple2.

5. Unstack brown from purple1.

6. Putdown brown.

7. Unstack yellow from purple2.

8. Stack yellow on white.

9. Pickup purple2.

10. Stack purple2 on black.

11. Unstack purple2 from black.

12. Putdown purple2.

13. Pickup black.

14. Stack black on orange.

15. Unstack black from orange.

16. Putdown black.

17. Pickup orange.

This is 17 steps. But there must be a shorter way.

Alternative Idea: Use the initial state to satisfy some constraints.

For example, constraint 8 (purple_block_1 not clear) is already satisfied in the initial state. So we don't need to do anything for that. Also, the implication associated with it requires that whenever purple_block_1 is not clear, orange is clear. In the initial state, purple_block_1 is not clear, and orange is clear. So that's okay. As long as whenever we make purple_block_1 not clear again (e.g., by stacking something on it), we need to ensure orange is clear then or later.

But perhaps it's easier to not modify purple_block_1's stack after the initial state.

Another Idea: To satisfy constraint 3 (yellow on purple2), stack yellow on purple2. To do that:

1. Unstack white from yellow.

2. Unstack yellow from brown.

3. Stack yellow on purple2. This satisfies constraint 3 and 7.

Then, to satisfy constraint 5 when we stack on orange:

Need to have purple2 on black and brown on table.

So:

4. Unstack brown from purple1. Now holding brown.

5. Putdown brown. Now brown is on table.

6. Pickup purple2. But purple2 has yellow on it. So can't pick up. Need to unstack yellow first.

7. Unstack yellow from purple2. Now holding yellow.

8. Putdown yellow.

9. Pickup purple2. Now holding purple2.

10. Stack purple2 on black. Now, purple2 is on black (satisfies part of constraint 5).

Now, brown is on table (step5), purple2 on black (step10). So constraint5's condition is met.

Now, to stack something on orange:

11. Pickup black. Can't, since purple2 is on black. So need to unstack purple2 first.

12. Unstack purple2 from black. Now holding purple2.

13. Putdown purple2.

14. Pickup black.

15. Stack black on orange. Satisfies constraint4.

16. Unstack black from orange. Now holding black.

17. Putdown black.

18. Pickup orange. Now holding orange.

This is 18 steps. Still too long.

But perhaps there's a shorter path by reusing some steps.

Let me try to find a shorter sequence:

Steps:

1. Unstack white from yellow. (Holding white)

2. Stack white on purple2. (Purple2 has white, satisfying constraint7)

3. Unstack yellow from brown. (Holding yellow)

4. Stack yellow on white. (Now, yellow is on white on purple2. Satisfies constraint3? No, because purple2 has white, which has yellow. But constraint3 requires purple1 on black or yellow on purple2. This is yellow on purple2 via white. So technically, yellow is on purple2. Wait, no. Stacking yellow on white which is on purple2 means yellow is on white, not directly on purple2. So this doesn't satisfy constraint3. So need to stack yellow directly on purple2.

So step4: Stack yellow on purple2. Which requires that purple2 is clear. But after step2, purple2 has white. So can't stack yellow on purple2. So this approach is wrong.

Alternative:

1. Unstack white from yellow. (Holding white)

2. Putdown white. (White on table)

3. Unstack yellow from brown. (Holding yellow)

4. Stack yellow on purple2. (Satisfies constraint3 and7)

5. Unstack brown from purple1. (Holding brown)

6. Putdown brown. (Brown on table)

7. Pickup purple2. Can't, as it has yellow. So unstack yellow first.

8. Unstack yellow from purple2. (Holding yellow)

9. Stack yellow on white. (Satisfies constraint2's condition yellow on white)

10. Pickup purple2. Now clear.

11. Stack purple2 on black. (Satisfies part of constraint5)

12. Now, brown is on table and purple2 is on black. So constraint5's conditions are met.

13. Pickup black. Can't, as purple2 is on it. Unstack purple2.

14. Unstack purple2 from black. (Holding purple2)

15. Putdown purple2.

16. Pickup black.

17. Stack black on orange. (Satisfies constraint4)

18. Unstack black from orange. (Holding black)

19. Putdown black.

20. Pickup orange. (Goal)

This is 20 steps, which is way too long. There has to be a shorter path.

Let me think differently. The key constraints that require the most steps are 3, 5, and 12's implication.

Maybe we can satisfy constraint3 by stacking purple1 on black, which requires:

- Unstacking brown from purple1.

- Putting brown on table.

- Picking up purple1.

- Stacking purple1 on black.

This would satisfy constraint3. Also, holding purple1 satisfies constraint6.

Let's try this path:

1. Unstack white from yellow. (Holding white)

2. Unstack yellow from brown. (Holding yellow)

3. Unstack brown from purple1. (Holding brown)

4. Putdown brown. (Brown on table)

5. Pickup purple1. (Now clear)

6. Stack purple1 on black_block_1. (Satisfies constraint3 and7 if black is under purple1. Wait, constraint3 is purple1 on black or yellow on purple2. So this satisfies the first part.)

7. Now, constraint6 is satisfied (held purple1 in step5).

8. Now, to satisfy constraint5, when we stack something on orange, we need purple2 on black and brown on table. Wait, constraint5 requires that if orange is not clear, then earlier state has purple2 on black and brown on table. But in this scenario, we haven't done anything with purple2. So we need to stack purple2 on black.

But purple2 is initially on table. So:

9. Pickup purple2. (It's clear)

10. Stack purple2 on black. (Now purple2 is on black. So black is not on table, satisfying constraint10.)

Now, brown is on table (step4), purple2 on black (step10). So constraint5's condition is met.

Now, to stack something on orange:

11. Pickup black_block_1. Can't, since purple2 is on it. So unstack purple2.

12. Unstack purple2 from black. (Holding purple2)

13. Putdown purple2.

14. Pickup black.

15. Stack black on orange. (Satisfies constraint4)

16. Unstack black from orange. (Holding black)

17. Putdown black.

18. Pickup orange. (Goal)

But this plan has 18 steps. Still long.

Wait, perhaps we can combine steps. Let's see:

After stacking purple1 on black (step6), we can then stack purple2 on purple1. But that's not necessary.

Alternatively, after step6, purple1 is on black. Then, to satisfy constraint5, we need purple2 on black. But purple1 is already on black. So stacking purple2 on purple1.

But that would make purple2 on purple1 on black. But constraint5 requires purple2 on black. Not sure. Let's see.

Alternatively, stack purple2 on purple1. Then, purple2 is on purple1, which is on black. But this may not satisfy the requirement of purple2 on black.

I think the key is to have purple2 on black and brown on table before stacking on orange.

But this seems unavoidable. 

Perhaps the optimal plan is to:

- Unstack the initial tower to get brown on table.

- Stack purple1 on black.

- Stack purple2 on black.

- Then stack black on orange.

- Finally, pickup orange.

But this may not work.

Alternatively:

1. Unstack white from yellow.

2. Unstack yellow from brown.

3. Unstack brown from purple1.

4. Putdown brown.

5. Pickup purple1.

6. Stack purple1 on black.

7. Pickup purple2.

8. Stack purple2 on black.

Now, purple2 is on black, brown on table.

9. Pickup black. Can't, so unstack purple2.

10. Unstack purple2 from black.

11. Putdown purple2.

12. Pickup black.

13. Stack black on orange.

14. Unstack black from orange.

15. Putdown black.

16. Pickup orange.

This is 16 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, steps 7-8 are stacking purple2 on black. But after step6, purple1 is on black. So to stack purple2 on black, we need to unstack purple1 first. Which is not possible unless we clear black.

This approach isn't working.

At this point, I'm realizing that this problem requires a lengthy plan due to the multiple constraints, and it's challenging to find the shortest path. However, the user requires an optimal plan, so I need to find the minimal number of steps.

Alternative Idea: Since the goal is to hold orange_block_1, and constraints require certain conditions, perhaps the minimal steps involve:

- Moving black off the table to satisfy constraints 2 and 10.

- Stacking yellow on purple2 to satisfy constraint3.

- Stacking something on orange to satisfy constraint4, ensuring constraint5's conditions are met.

- Then unstacking to pick up orange.

Let's try:

1. Unstack white from yellow. (Holding white)

2. Putdown white. (White on table)

3. Unstack yellow from brown. (Holding yellow)

4. Stack yellow on purple2. (Satisfies constraint3 and7)

5. Unstack brown from purple1. (Holding brown)

6. Putdown brown. (Brown on table, part of constraint5)

7. Pickup black. (Satisfies constraint11, part of constraint2 and10)

8. Stack black on purple_block_1. (Now purple1 has black on top, which was already not clear. But this may not be necessary.)

Wait, perhaps stack black on purple2 (which has yellow), but can't stack on yellow unless it's clear.

Alternatively, stack black on orange. But need to meet constraint5.

Wait, before stacking black on orange, we need to have purple2 on black and brown on table. So:

7. Pickup purple2. Can't, since yellow is on it. So unstack yellow from purple2.

8. Unstack yellow from purple2. (Holding yellow)

9. Putdown yellow.

10. Pickup purple2.

11. Stack purple2 on black. (Satisfies part of constraint5)

Now, brown is on table (step6), purple2 on black (step11). Now, constraint5's conditions are met.

12. Pickup black. Can't, since purple2 is on it. So unstack purple2.

13. Unstack purple2 from black. (Holding purple2)

14. Putdown purple2.

15. Pickup black.

16. Stack black on orange. (Satisfies constraint4)

17. Unstack black from orange. (Holding black)

18. Putdown black.

19. Pickup orange. (Goal)

This is 19 steps. Still long. But maybe there's a better way.

Alternative Idea: Use the white_block_1 to satisfy constraint11 (hold white or black).

1. Unstack white from yellow. (Holding white. Satisfies constraint11)

2. Putdown white.

3. Unstack yellow from brown.

4. Stack yellow on purple2. (Constraint3,7)

5. Unstack brown from purple1.

6. Putdown brown. (Brown on table)

7. Pickup purple2. Can't, as yellow is on it. Unstack yellow.

8. Unstack yellow from purple2. (Holding yellow)

9. Stack yellow on white. (Satisfies constraint2's condition yellow on white)

10. Pickup purple2.

11. Stack purple2 on black. (Constraint5's purple2 on black)

12. Now, brown is on table, purple2 on black.

13. Pickup black. Can't, so unstack purple2.

14. Unstack purple2 from black. (Holding purple2)

15. Putdown purple2.

16. Pickup black.

17. Stack black on orange. (Constraint4)

18. Unstack black from orange. (Holding black)

19. Putdown black.

20. Pickup orange.

This is 20 steps, but we held white in step1, satisfying constraint11.

But this is too long. I'm clearly missing a shorter path. Let's think differently.

What if we use the action 'unstack' to pick up orange_block_1 indirectly? For example, if we stack something on orange, then unstack it, which requires picking up the block on top, then we can pick up orange.

But orange is initially on the table. So to stack on it, we need to have another block. Let's say we stack black on orange, then unstack black, then pick up orange.

But stacking black on orange requires that black is clear and we are holding it. So steps:

1. Pickup black. (Preconditions: black is clear, which it is.)

2. Stack black on orange. (Now, orange has black on top, satisfying constraint4.)

3. Unstack black from orange. Now holding black.

4. Putdown black.

5. Pickup orange. (Now holding orange, goal achieved.)

This would be 5 steps, but need to check all constraints.

But we also need to satisfy other constraints:

Constraint1: orange is not on table. Yes, after step5, orange is being held.

But constraint2: whenever orange is not on table (step5), there must be an earlier state where yellow on white or black not on table. In this plan, black is moved off the table in step2 (stacked on orange, which is on table). Wait, no. Stacking black on orange, which is on the table, means black is not on the table. So in step2, black is not on the table. So before picking up orange (step5), we have a state where black is not on table. So constraint2 is satisfied.

Constraint3: purple1 on black or yellow on purple2. Not addressed in this plan. So this plan is invalid.

Similarly, other constraints like constraint3, 5, etc., are not satisfied. So the simple plan won't work.

Thus, we must find a way to satisfy all constraints with minimal steps.

Alternative Idea: Use the initial state to satisfy some constraints.

For example, the initial state satisfies constraint8 (purple1 not clear) and constraint12 (white not on table). The implication for constraint12 requires that orange is on yellow at some point after the initial state.

So we must stack orange on yellow.

Additionally, we need to satisfy constraint3 (yellow on purple2 or purple1 on black).

So steps:

1. Unstack white from yellow. (Holding white)

2. Unstack yellow from brown. (Holding yellow)

3. Stack yellow on purple2. (Satisfies constraint3 and7)

4. Unstack brown from purple1. (Holding brown)

5. Putdown brown. (Satisfies part of constraint5)

6. Pickup purple2. Can't, yellow is on it. Unstack yellow.

7. Unstack yellow from purple2. (Holding yellow)

8. Stack yellow on white. (Satisfies constraint2's condition)

9. Pickup purple2. (Now clear)

10. Stack purple2 on black. (Satisfies part of constraint5)

11. Now, brown is on table (step5), purple2 on black (step10). So constraint5's conditions are met.

12. Pickup orange. (Can't, orange is on table. But to satisfy constraint1 and constraint2's implication, we need to stack orange on yellow first.)

13. Pickup orange. (But to satisfy constraint2's implication, we need to have either yellow on white or black not on table. Black is not on table after step10. So this is allowed.)

But constraint1 requires that orange is not on table in at least one state. Picking up orange satisfies this.

However, constraint4 requires that orange has a block on top in some state. So we need to stack something on orange.

But in this plan, we haven't stacked anything on orange. So we need to:

After step10:

11. Unstack purple2 from black. (Holding purple2)

12. Putdown purple2.

13. Pickup black.

14. Stack black on orange. (Satisfies constraint4)

15. Unstack black from orange. (Holding black)

16. Putdown black.

17. Pickup orange. (Goal)

But this adds more steps. Let's count:

1. Unstack white.

2. Unstack yellow.

3. Stack yellow on purple2.

4. Unstack brown.

5. Putdown brown.

6. Unstack yellow.

7. Stack yellow on white.

8. Pickup purple2.

9. Stack purple2 on black.

10. Unstack purple2.

11. Putdown purple2.

12. Pickup black.

13. Stack black on orange.

14. Unstack black.

15. Putdown black.

16. Pickup orange.

This is 16 steps. Still long.

At this point, I think the minimal plan would involve around 10-15 steps, but it's challenging to find the exact sequence. However, considering the constraints, here's a possible optimal plan:

1. Unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (Holding white)

2. Stack white_block_1 on purple_block_2. (Satisfies constraint7)

3. Unstack yellow_block_1 from brown_block_1. (Holding yellow)

4. Stack yellow_block_1 on purple_block_2. (Now, yellow is on white on purple2. This doesn't satisfy constraint3 directly, as yellow is on white, not purple2. So this is invalid.)

Alternative:

1. Unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1.

2. Putdown white_block_1.

3. Unstack yellow_block_1 from brown_block_1.

4. Stack yellow_block_1 on purple_block_2. (Satisfies constraint3 and7)

5. Unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_1. (Holding brown)

6. Putdown brown_block_1. (Satisfies part of constraint5)

7. Pickup purple_block_2. Can't, need to unstack yellow first.

8. Unstack yellow_block_1 from purple_block_2. (Holding yellow)

9. Stack yellow_block_1 on white_block_1. (Satisfies constraint2's condition)

10. Pickup purple_block_2. (Now clear)

11. Stack purple_block_2 on black_block_1. (Satisfies part of constraint5)

12. Now, brown is on table, purple2 on black.

13. Pickup black_block_1. Need to unstack purple2 first.

14. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1.

15. Putdown purple_block_2.

16. Pickup black_block_1.

17. Stack black_block_1 on orange_block_1. (Satisfies constraint4)

18. Unstack black_block_1 from orange_block_1.

19. Putdown black_block_1.

20. Pickup orange_block_1. (Goal)

This is 20 steps. It seems that given the constraints, the plan can't be much shorter. However, I might be missing a more efficient sequence. But given the time I've spent, I think this is the best I can do. The final plan would need to include all required steps to satisfy each constraint, even if it's lengthy.
