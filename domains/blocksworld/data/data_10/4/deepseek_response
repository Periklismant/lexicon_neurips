**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1:** This allows access to yellow_block_1 and starts dismantling the initial tower. Now holding white_block_1.

2. **Putdown white_block_1:** Places white_block_1 on the table to free the gripper.

3. **Unstack yellow_block_1 from brown_block_1:** Now holding yellow_block_1, preparing to stack it on purple_block_2.

4. **Stack yellow_block_1 on purple_block_2:** Satisfies constraint 3 (yellow on purple_block_2) and constraint 7 (purple_block_2 not clear).

5. **Unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_1:** Now holding brown_block_1. This allows brown_block_1 to be placed on the table, satisfying part of constraint 5.

6. **Putdown brown_block_1:** Places brown_block_1 on the table, fulfilling the "brown_block_1 on table" requirement for constraint 5.

7. **Pickup purple_block_2:** Now holding purple_block_2 (satisfies constraint 9). This requires first unstacking yellow_block_1 (done in step 4).

8. **Stack purple_block_2 on black_block_1:** Makes black_block_1 not on the table (satisfies constraint 10) and sets up for constraint 5 ("purple_block_2 on black_block_1").

9. **Pickup black_block_1:** Now holding black_block_1 (satisfies constraint 11).

10. **Stack black_block_1 on orange_block_1:** Makes orange_block_1 not clear (satisfies constraint 4). Valid because constraint 5's preconditions (purple_block_2 on black_block_1 and brown_block_1 on table) were met earlier.

11. **Unstack black_block_1 from orange_block_1:** Prepares to pick up orange_block_1.

12. **Putdown black_block_1:** Places black_block_1 back on the table.

13. **Pickup orange_block_1:** Achieves the goal. This action is valid because orange_block_1 is clear after unstacking black_block_1, and constraint 2 is satisfied via black_block_1 being removed from the table earlier.

All constraints are satisfied with minimal actions.
