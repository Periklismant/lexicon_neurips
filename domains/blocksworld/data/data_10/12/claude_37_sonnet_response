Let's break down this problem:

1. We have 7 blocks: red_block_1, white_block_1, grey_block_1, brown_block_1, blue_block_1, orange_block_1, and orange_block_2.

2. The initial state is:
   - red_block_1 is on the table
   - white_block_1 is on the table
   - grey_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
   - brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
   - blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
   - orange_block_1 is on the table
   - orange_block_2 is on the table
   - brown_block_1 is clear
   - blue_block_1 is clear
   - orange_block_1 is clear
   - orange_block_2 is clear
   - we're not holding any block

3. The goal is:
   - white_block_1 is clear

In the initial state, white_block_1 has blue_block_1 on top of it, so it's not clear. To achieve the goal, we need to remove blue_block_1 from white_block_1.

4. There are constraints to consider:
   a. At some point, orange_block_2 is not clear.
   b. At some point, orange_block_1 is not on the table.
   c. At some point, we're holding red_block_1 while orange_block_2 is not clear.
   d. At some point, brown_block_1 is not on the table.
   e. If brown_block_1 is not on the table, we must hold orange_block_1 after.
   f. At some point, grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and red_block_1 is clear.
   g. At some point, brown_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2.
   h. If brown_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2, then orange_block_2 is not on the table after.
   i. At some point, orange_block_2 is not on the table.
   j. At some point, we're holding blue_block_1.
   k. If we hold blue_block_1, we must have held orange_block_1 before.
   l. At some point, blue_block_1 is not clear.
   m. If blue_block_1 is not clear, then earlier either orange_block_2 must have been not clear or we were holding orange_block_1.
   n. At some point, white_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 (this always true, a block can't be on top of itself).
   o. If white_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, then orange_block_1 is not clear after.

Let's take a step back and think about this. Constraint (n) is always true, so we must enforce (o): at some point orange_block_1 is not clear.

Let's also note that the goal is to make white_block_1 clear. In the initial state, white_block_1 has blue_block_1 on top, so we need to move blue_block_1 somewhere else.

Let me start by outlining a step towards our goal:

1. We need to unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1.

But before we can do that, we need to satisfy all the constraints. Let's see if I can come up with a valid plan by reasoning through the constraints:

- For constraint (a), we need to put something on top of orange_block_2. 
- For constraint (b), we need to pick up orange_block_1.
- For constraint (c), we need to pick up red_block_1 while something is on top of orange_block_2.
- For constraint (f), we need to place grey_block_1 on top of white_block_1, which means we need to first remove brown_block_1 and grey_block_1 from their current positions.
- For constraint (j), we need to pick up blue_block_1.
- For constraint (k), before picking up blue_block_1, we need to pick up orange_block_1.
- For constraint (l), we need to place something on top of blue_block_1.
- For constraint (d), we need to pick up brown_block_1 (which is already satisfied by the need to remove it to move grey_block_1 to white_block_1).
- For constraint (e), after picking up brown_block_1, we need to pick up orange_block_1.
- For constraint (g), we need to make sure brown_block_1 is not on orange_block_2. Initially it's on top of grey_block_1, so this is already satisfied.
- For constraint (h), since brown_block_1 is not on orange_block_2, we need to ensure orange_block_2 is not on the table at some point.
- For constraint (i), we need to pick up orange_block_2, which will also satisfy the constraint (h).
- For constraint (o), we need to make orange_block_1 not clear at some point.

Alright, let's start formulating a plan:

1. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1. (Satisfies constraint (d))
2. Stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_2. (Helps satisfy constraint (a))
3. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1. (Satisfies part of constraint (f))
4. Stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1. (Satisfies constraint (f) if red_block_1 is clear)
5. Pickup orange_block_1. (Satisfies constraints (b), (e), and part of (k))
6. Stack orange_block_1 on orange_block_2. (Helps satisfy constraint (o))
7. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1. (Helps achieve the goal, satisfies constraint (j))
8. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_1. (Helps satisfy constraint (l))
9. Pickup red_block_1. (Helps satisfy constraint (c))
10. Pickup orange_block_2. (Satisfies constraint (i), we're holding orange_block_2 and orange_block_1 is on it, so both are not on the table)
11. Putdown red_block_1. (to free our hand for the next action)
12. Putdown orange_block_2. (to free our hand for the next action)
13. Unstack blue_block_1 from orange_block_1. (to continue our plan)
14. Putdown blue_block_1. (to free our hand for the next action)
15. Unstack orange_block_1 from orange_block_2. (to free up orange_block_2)
16. Putdown orange_block_1. (to free our hand for the next action)
17. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_2. (to free up orange_block_2)
18. Putdown brown_block_1. (to free our hand for the next action)

However, I realize that the plan I'm constructing is getting quite long and doesn't seem to be efficient. Let me try a different approach, and more carefully track the constraints.

Initial State:
```
red_block_1 (table)
  |
grey_block_1
  |
brown_block_1 (clear)

white_block_1 (table)
  |
blue_block_1 (clear)

orange_block_1 (table, clear)

orange_block_2 (table, clear)
```

Goal: white_block_1 is clear.

Constraints:
- (a) orange_block_2 is not clear at some point.
- (b) orange_block_1 is not on the table at some point.
- (c) Holding red_block_1 and orange_block_2 is not clear at some point.
- (d) brown_block_1 is not on the table at some point.
- (e) If brown_block_1 is not on the table, we must hold orange_block_1 after.
- (f) grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and red_block_1 is clear at some point.
- (g) brown_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2 at some point.
- (h) If brown_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2, then orange_block_2 is not on the table after.
- (i) orange_block_2 is not on the table at some point.
- (j) Holding blue_block_1 at some point.
- (k) If holding blue_block_1, we must have held orange_block_1 before.
- (l) blue_block_1 is not clear at some point.
- (m) If blue_block_1 is not clear, then earlier either orange_block_2 is not clear or we're holding orange_block_1.
- (n) white_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 at some point (always true).
- (o) If white_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, then orange_block_1 is not clear after.

Let's revise a plan more carefully:

1. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1. (Satisfies constraint (d))
2. Stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_2. (Satisfies constraint (a))
3. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1. (Preparing for constraint (f))
4. Pickup orange_block_1. (Satisfies constraints (b), (e), and part of (k))
5. Stack orange_block_1 on brown_block_1. (Satisfies constraint (o))
6. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1. (Helps achieve the goal, satisfies constraint (j))
7. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_1. (Satisfies constraint (l))
8. Stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1. (Satisfies constraint (f))
9. Pickup red_block_1. (Helps satisfy constraint (c), red_block_1 is now being held and orange_block_2 is not clear)
10. Unstack blue_block_1 from orange_block_1. (Removing the stack to prepare for moving orange_block_2)
11. Putdown red_block_1. (Freeing our hand)
12. Unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_1. (Removing the stack)
13. Putdown orange_block_1. (Freeing our hand)
14. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_2. (Satisfies constraint (g))
15. Pickup orange_block_2. (Satisfies constraints (h) and (i))
16. Putdown orange_block_2. (Freeing our hand)
17. Putdown blue_block_1. (Freeing up blue_block_1)
18. Putdown brown_block_1. (Freeing up brown_block_1)

Now let's check if all constraints are satisfied and if we reach the goal:

- (a) ✓ orange_block_2 is not clear during steps 2-14 (brown_block_1 is on top of it).
- (b) ✓ orange_block_1 is not on the table during steps 4-13.
- (c) ✓ In step 9, we're holding red_block_1 and orange_block_2 is not clear (brown_block_1 and orange_block_1 are on it).
- (d) ✓ brown_block_1 is not on the table during steps 1-14.
- (e) ✓ We pick up orange_block_1 in step 4, after brown_block_1 is not on the table from step 1.
- (f) ✓ In step 8, grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and red_block_1 is clear.
- (g) ✓ brown_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2 during steps 1-2 and after step 14.
- (h) ✓ After step 14 (when brown_block_1 is not on orange_block_2), we pick up orange_block_2 in step 15, ensuring it's not on the table.
- (i) ✓ orange_block_2 is not on the table during step 15.
- (j) ✓ We're holding blue_block_1 during steps 6-7 and 10.
- (k) ✓ We held orange_block_1 in step 4, before holding blue_block_1 in step 6.
- (l) ✓ blue_block_1 is not clear during steps 7-10 (orange_block_1 is on top of it).
- (m) ✓ Before blue_block_1 is not clear (step 7), orange_block_2 is not clear from step 2 onwards.
- (n) ✓ Always true.
- (o) ✓ After step 0 (when white_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1), orange_block_1 is not clear during steps 5-12 (blue_block_1 is on top of it).

Goal: white_block_1 is clear after step 8 when grey_block_1 is put on it (which would make white_block_1 not clear), but we remove grey_block_1 later.

There's a problem though: the goal is to make white_block_1 clear, but in the plan I've outlined, white_block_1 is not clear by the end, as grey_block_1 is on top of it (step 8).

Let's modify the plan:

1. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1. (Satisfies constraint (d))
2. Stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_2. (Satisfies constraint (a))
3. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1. (Preparing for constraint (f))
4. Stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1. (Satisfies part of constraint (f))
5. Pickup orange_block_1. (Satisfies constraints (b), (e), and part of (k))
6. Stack orange_block_1 on brown_block_1. (Satisfies constraint (o))
7. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1. (Helps achieve the goal, satisfies constraint (j))
8. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_1. (Satisfies constraint (l))
9. Pickup red_block_1. (Helps satisfy constraint (c), red_block_1 is now being held and orange_block_2 is not clear)
10. Putdown red_block_1. (Freeing our hand)
11. Unstack blue_block_1 from orange_block_1. (Removing the stack to prepare for moving orange_block_2)
12. Putdown blue_block_1. (Freeing our hand)
13. Unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_1. (Removing the stack)
14. Putdown orange_block_1. (Freeing our hand)
15. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_2. (Satisfies constraint (g))
16. Pickup orange_block_2. (Satisfies constraints (h) and (i))
17. Putdown orange_block_2. (Freeing our hand)
18. Unstack grey_block_1 from white_block_1. (Achieving the goal)
19. Putdown grey_block_1. (Freeing our hand)

Wait, there's a problem with my reasoning. In the initial state, both white_block_1 and blue_block_1 are on the table, so I can't "unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1". Let me quickly re-check the initial state:

```
red_block_1 (table)
  |
grey_block_1
  |
brown_block_1 (clear)

white_block_1 (table)
  |
blue_block_1 (clear)

orange_block_1 (table, clear)

orange_block_2 (table, clear)
```

The problem said "blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1", so it should be correctly represented as:

```
red_block_1 (table)
  |
grey_block_1
  |
brown_block_1 (clear)

white_block_1 (table)
  |
blue_block_1 (clear)

orange_block_1 (table, clear)

orange_block_2 (table, clear)
```

Yes, blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, not on the table. Let me revise the plan again:

1. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1. (Satisfies constraint (d))
2. Stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_2. (Satisfies constraint (a))
3. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1. (Preparing for constraint (f))
4. Pickup orange_block_1. (Satisfies constraints (b), (e), and part of (k))
5. Stack orange_block_1 on brown_block_1. (Satisfies constraint (o))
6. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1. (Helps achieve the goal, satisfies constraint (j))
7. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_1. (Satisfies constraint (l))
8. Stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1. (Satisfies constraint (f))
9. Pickup red_block_1. (Helps satisfy constraint (c), red_block_1 is now being held and orange_block_2 is not clear)
10. Putdown red_block_1. (Freeing our hand)
11. Unstack grey_block_1 from white_block_1. (Achieving the goal)
12. Putdown grey_block_1. (Freeing our hand)
13. Unstack blue_block_1 from orange_block_1. (Removing the stack to prepare for moving orange_block_2)
14. Putdown blue_block_1. (Freeing our hand)
15. Unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_1. (Removing the stack)
16. Putdown orange_block_1. (Freeing our hand)
17. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_2. (Satisfies constraint (g))
18. Pickup orange_block_2. (Satisfies constraints (h) and (i))
19. Putdown orange_block_2. (Freeing our hand)

With this plan, white_block_1 is made clear in step 11 and remains clear for the rest of the plan, satisfying the goal. Let me verify all constraints are still upheld:

- (a) ✓ orange_block_2 is not clear during steps 2-17 (brown_block_1 is on top of it).
- (b) ✓ orange_block_1 is not on the table during steps 4-15.
- (c) ✓ In step 9, we're holding red_block_1 and orange_block_2 is not clear (brown_block_1 and orange_block_1 are on it).
- (d) ✓ brown_block_1 is not on the table during steps 1-17.
- (e) ✓ We pick up orange_block_1 in step 4, after brown_block_1 is not on the table from step 1.
- (f) ✓ In step 8, grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and red_block_1 is clear.
- (g) ✓ brown_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2 during steps 1-2 and after step 17.
- (h) ✓ After step 17 (when brown_block_1 is not on orange_block_2), we pick up orange_block_2 in step 18, ensuring it's not on the table.
- (i) ✓ orange_block_2 is not on the table during step 18.
- (j) ✓ We're holding blue_block_1 during steps 6-7 and 13.
- (k) ✓ We held orange_block_1 in step 4, before holding blue_block_1 in step 6.
- (l) ✓ blue_block_1 is not clear during steps 7-13 (orange_block_1 is on top of it).
- (m) ✓ Before blue_block_1 is not clear (step 7), orange_block_2 is not clear from step 2 onwards.
- (n) ✓ Always true.
- (o) ✓ After step 0 (when white_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1), orange_block_1 is not clear during steps 5-15 (blue_block_1 is on top of it).

I think I still have an issue with step 8. If grey_block_1 is on white_block_1, we can't say that white_block_1 is clear. I'm thinking of revising my plan:

Let's go through the constraints again and break them down more methodically:

- Initial State: blue_block_1 is on white_block_1, so white_block_1 is not clear.
- Goal: white_block_1 should be clear.

Constraint (a): orange_block_2 must be not clear at some point.
Constraint (b): orange_block_1 must not be on the table at some point.
Constraint (c): We must hold red_block_1 and orange_block_2 must be not clear at the same time.
Constraint (d): brown_block_1 must not be on the table at some point.
Constraint (e): After brown_block_1 is not on the table, we must hold orange_block_1 at some point.
Constraint (f): grey_block_1 must be on white_block_1 and red_block_1 must be clear at the same time.
Constraint (g): brown_block_1 must not be on orange_block_2 at some point.
Constraint (h): After brown_block_1 is not on orange_block_2, orange_block_2 must not be on the table at some point.
Constraint (i): orange_block_2 must not be on the table at some point.
Constraint (j): We must hold blue_block_1 at some point.
Constraint (k): Before we hold blue_block_1, we must have held orange_block_1.
Constraint (l): blue_block_1 must be not clear at some point.
Constraint (m): Before blue_block_1 is not clear, orange_block_2 must have been not clear or we were holding orange_block_1.
Constraint (n): white_block_1 must not be on white_block_1 at some point (always true).
Constraint (o): After white_block_1 is not on white_block_1, orange_block_1 must be not clear at some point.

Looking at the specific goal and constraints, we need to do the following:
1. Remove blue_block_1 from white_block_1 to make white_block_1 clear.
2. Ensure all constraints are satisfied.

Let's attempt a different plan:

1. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1. (Satisfies constraint (d))
2. Stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_2. (Satisfies constraint (a))
3. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1. (Freeing up red_block_1)
4. Pickup orange_block_1. (Satisfies constraint (b) and part of (e), (k))
5. Stack orange_block_1 on brown_block_1. (Satisfies constraint (o))
6. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1. (Helping to achieve the goal, satisfying constraint (j) and (k))
7. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_1. (Satisfies constraint (l) and (m))
8. Pickup red_block_1. (Helps satisfy constraint (c))
9. Putdown red_block_1. (Freeing our hand)
10. Stack grey_block_1 on red_block_1. (Placing grey_block_1 somewhere else for now)
11. Unstack blue_block_1 from orange_block_1. (Freeing up blue_block_1)
12. Putdown blue_block_1. (Just putting it somewhere)
13. Unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_1. (Freeing up orange_block_1)
14. Putdown orange_block_1. (Just putting it somewhere)
15. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_2. (Satisfies constraint (g))
16. Putdown brown_block_1. (Just putting it somewhere)
17. Pickup orange_block_2. (Satisfies constraints (h) and (i))
18. Putdown orange_block_2. (Just putting it somewhere)
19. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1. (Freeing up grey_block_1)
20. Stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1. (Working towards constraint (f))
21. Pickup red_block_1. (Completing constraint (f) and (c))
22. Putdown red_block_1. (Freeing our hand)
23. Unstack grey_block_1 from white_block_1. (Ensuring white_block_1 is clear)
24. Putdown grey_block_1. (Just putting it somewhere)

Hmm wait, that's getting very long and I'm not sure it satisfies all constraints neatly. Let me approach this more systematically:

The goal is to make white_block_1 clear.
In the initial state, blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, so we need to remove it.

Let's see if we can work backwards from the goal:

1. We need to unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1.
2. To do that, we need to ensure that blue_block_1 is clear (which it is in the initial state) and that we are not holding any block (which is also true in the initial state).
3. After we unstack blue_block_1, we need to place it somewhere. According to constraint (l), blue_block_1 needs to be not clear at some point, meaning something needs to be on top of it. And before that, according to constraint (m), either orange_block_2 must have been not clear or we were holding orange_block_1.

Let's work out a plan:

Initial State:
```
red_block_1 (table)
  |
grey_block_1
  |
brown_block_1 (clear)

white_block_1 (table)
  |
blue_block_1 (clear)

orange_block_1 (table, clear)

orange_block_2 (table, clear)
```

1. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1. (Satisfies constraint (d))
2. Stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_2. (Satisfies constraint (a))
3. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1. (Freeing up red_block_1)
4. Pickup orange_block_1. (Satisfies constraint (b), (e), and part of (k))
5. Stack orange_block_1 on brown_block_1. (Satisfies constraint (o))
6. Pickup red_block_1. (Working towards constraint (c))
7. Putdown red_block_1. (Freeing our hand)
8. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1. (Achieving the goal, satisfying constraint (j))
9. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_1. (Satisfies constraint (l) and (m))
10. Stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1. (Working towards constraint (f))
11. Pickup red_block_1. (Satisfying constraint (c) and (f))
12. Putdown red_block_1. (Freeing our hand)
13. Unstack grey_block_1 from white_block_1. (Ensuring white_block_1 remains clear)
14. Putdown grey_block_1. (Just putting it somewhere)
15. Unstack blue_block_1 from orange_block_1. (Freeing up blue_block_1)
16. Putdown blue_block_1. (Just putting it somewhere)
17. Unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_1. (Freeing up orange_block_1)
18. Putdown orange_block_1. (Just putting it somewhere)
19. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_2. (Satisfies constraint (g))
20. Putdown brown_block_1. (Just putting it somewhere)
21. Pickup orange_block_2. (Satisfies constraints (h) and (i))
22. Putdown orange_block_2. (Just putting it somewhere)

Ok wait, I think I might be overcomplicating this. Let's make sure we understand what the task is demanding. We need to satisfy the constraints, but we also need to reach a state where white_block_1 is clear, and it should remain clear at the end.

Our goal is:
- white_block_1 is clear.

In the initial state, white_block_1 has blue_block_1 on top, so it's not clear. Let's remove blue_block_1 and make white_block_1 clear.

The simplest plan would be just to unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 and put it on the table, achieving the goal. But we also need to satisfy all the constraints.

Let's try a plan that aims to satisfy the constraints and then achieves the goal:

1. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1. (Satisfies constraint (d))
2. Stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_2. (Satisfies constraint (a))
3. Pickup orange_block_1. (Satisfies constraints (b), (e), and part of (k))
4. Stack orange_block_1 on brown_block_1. (Satisfies constraint (o))
5. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1. (Achieving the goal, satisfying constraint (j) and (k))
6. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_1. (Satisfies constraint (l) and (m))
7. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1. (Freeing up red_block_1)
8. Stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1. (Working towards constraint (f))
9. Pickup red_block_1. (Satisfying constraint (c) and (f))
10. Putdown red_block_1. (Freeing our hand)
11. Unstack grey_block_1 from white_block_1. (Ensuring white_block_1 remains clear)
12. Putdown grey_block_1. (Just putting it somewhere)
13. Unstack blue_block_1 from orange_block_1. (Freeing up blue_block_1)
14. Putdown blue_block_1. (Just putting it somewhere)
15. Unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_1. (Freeing up orange_block_1)
16. Putdown orange_block_1. (Just putting it somewhere)
17. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_2. (Satisfies constraint (g))
18. Putdown brown_block_1. (Just putting it somewhere)
19. Pickup orange_block_2. (Satisfies constraints (h) and (i))
20. Putdown orange_block_2. (Just putting it somewhere)

However, is this optimal? The optimal plan should be the shortest plan that satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal. Let's streamline our plan: we need to make white_block_1 clear (by removing blue_block_1) and we need to satisfy all the constraints, but we don't need to do anything else.

Ok, to simplify our approach, let's reorder actions in a more coherent way:

1. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1. (Satisfies constraint (d))
2. Stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_2. (Satisfies constraint (a))
3. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1. (Freeing up red_block_1)
4. Stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1. (Working towards constraint (f))
5. Pickup red_block_1. (Satisfying constraint (c) and (f))
6. Putdown red_block_1. (Freeing our hand)
7. Pickup orange_block_1. (Satisfies constraints (b), (e), and part of (k))
8. Stack orange_block_1 on brown_block_1. (Satisfies constraint (o))
9. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1. (Achieving the goal, satisfying constraint (j) and (k))
10. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_1. (Satisfies constraint (l) and (m))
11. Unstack grey_block_1 from white_block_1. (Ensuring white_block_1 remains clear)
12. Putdown grey_block_1. (Just putting it somewhere)
13. Unstack blue_block_1 from orange_block_1. (Freeing up blue_block_1)
14. Putdown blue_block_1. (Just putting it somewhere)
15. Unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_1. (Freeing up orange_block_1)
16. Putdown orange_block_1. (Just putting it somewhere)
17. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_2. (Satisfies constraint (g))
18. Pickup orange_block_2. (Satisfies constraints (h) and (i))
19. Putdown orange_block_2. (Just putting it somewhere)

Wait, but in step 4, after we place grey_block_1 on white_block_1, white_block_1 becomes not clear. But the constraint (f) only requires grey_block_1 to be on white_block_1 and red_block_1 to be clear at the same time, not blue_block_1 to be on white_block_1. I'm making a mistake here.

Let's carefully check the initial state:
```
red_block_1 (table)
  |
grey_block_1
  |
brown_block_1 (clear)

white_block_1 (table)
  |
blue_block_1 (clear)

orange_block_1 (table, clear)

orange_block_2 (table, clear)
```

Our goal is to make white_block_1 clear. We need to remove blue_block_1 from white_block_1.

Before we do that, let's satisfy all the constraints:

1. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1. (Satisfies constraint (d))
2. Stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_2. (Satisfies constraint (a), (g))
3. Pickup orange_block_1. (Satisfies constraints (b), (e), and part of (k))
4. Stack orange_block_1 on brown_block_1. (Satisfies constraint (o))
5. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1. (Achieving the goal, satisfying constraint (j) and (k))
6. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_1. (Satisfies constraint (l) and (m))
7. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1. (Freeing up red_block_1)
8. Stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1. (Working towards constraint (f))
9. Pickup red_block_1. (Satisfying constraint (c) and (f))
10. Putdown red_block_1. (Freeing our hand)
11. Unstack grey_block_1 from white_block_1. (Ensuring white_block_1 remains clear)
12. Putdown grey_block_1. (Just putting it somewhere)
13. Unstack blue_block_1 from orange_block_1. (Freeing up blue_block_1)
14. Putdown blue_block_1. (Just putting it somewhere)
15. Unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_1. (Freeing up orange_block_1)
16. Putdown orange_block_1. (Just putting it somewhere)
17. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_2. (Freeing up brown_block_1)
18. Pickup orange_block_2. (Satisfies constraints (h) and (i))
19. Putdown orange_block_2. (Just putting it somewhere)
20. Putdown brown_block_1. (Just putting it somewhere)

Wait, there's a mistake in step 9. I'm holding red_block_1, but the constraint (c) says we need to hold red_block_1 while orange_block_2 is not clear. Now orange_block_2 is not clear in steps 2-17 because brown_block_1 (and later, brown_block_1 with orange_block_1 and blue_block_1 on top) is on top of it. Let's adjust the plan:

1. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1. (Satisfies constraint (d))
2. Stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_2. (Satisfies constraint (a), (g))
3. Pickup orange_block_1. (Satisfies constraints (b), (e), and part of (k))
4. Stack orange_block_1 on brown_block_1. (Satisfies constraint (o))
5. Pickup red_block_1. (Satisfying constraint (c))
6. Putdown red_block_1. (Freeing our hand)
7. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1. (Achieving the goal, satisfying constraint (j) and (k))
8. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_1. (Satisfies constraint (l) and (m))
9. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1. (Freeing up red_block_1)
10. Stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1. (Working towards constraint (f))
11. Pickup red_block_1. (Satisfying constraint (f))
12. Putdown red_block_1. (Freeing our hand)
13. Unstack grey_block_1 from white_block_1. (Ensuring white_block_1 remains clear)
14. Putdown grey_block_1. (Just putting it somewhere)
15. Unstack blue_block_1 from orange_block_1. (Freeing up blue_block_1)
16. Putdown blue_block_1. (Just putting it somewhere)
17. Unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_1. (Freeing up orange_block_1)
18. Putdown orange_block_1. (Just putting it somewhere)
19. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_2. (Freeing up brown_block_1)
20. Pickup orange_block_2. (Satisfies constraints (h) and (i))
21. Putdown orange_block_2. (Just putting it somewhere)
22. Putdown brown_block_1. (Just putting it somewhere)

Ok wait, let's slow down and think about the optimal solution carefully. We want to make white_block_1 clear, and we have several constraints to satisfy:

Constraints and their satisfaction timestamps:
- (a) orange_block_2 is not clear at least once (satisfied during steps 2-19)
- (b) orange_block_1 is not on the table at least once (satisfied during steps 3-17)
- (c) Holding red_block_1 and orange_block_2 is not clear at least once (satisfied during step 5)
- (d) brown_block_1 is not on the table at least once (satisfied during steps 1-19)
- (e) After brown_block_1 is not on the table, we must hold orange_block_1 (satisfied in step 3)
- (f) grey_block_1 is on white_block_1 and red_block_1 is clear at least once (satisfied during steps 10-11)
- (g) brown_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2 at least once (satisfied in initial state)
- (h) After brown_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2, orange_block_2 is not on the table (satisfied in step 20)
- (i) orange_block_2 is not on the table at least once (satisfied during step 20)
- (j) Holding blue_block_1 at least once (satisfied during steps 7-8)
- (k) Before we hold blue_block_1, we must have held orange_block_1 (satisfied by holding orange_block_1 in step 3 before holding blue_block_1 in step 7)
- (l) blue_block_1 is not clear at least once (satisfied during steps 8-15)
- (m) Before blue_block_1 is not clear, orange_block_2 must have been not clear or we were holding orange_block_1 (satisfied by orange_block_2 being not clear from step 2 onwards before blue_block_1 becomes not clear in step 8)
- (n) white_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 at least once (always true)
- (o) After white_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, orange_block_1 is not clear (satisfied by orange_block_1 being not clear during steps 8-15 after white_block_1 is not on white_block_1, which is always true)

All constraints are satisfied by the steps we've outlined. This is not technically a minimal solution, but I've tried to make it reasonably compact.

Let's finalize the plan one more time to make sure it's clear:

1. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1
2. Stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_2
3. Pickup orange_block_1
4. Stack orange_block_1 on brown_block_1
5. Pickup red_block_1
6. Putdown red_block_1
7. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1
8. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_1
9. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1
10. Stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1
11. Pickup red_block_1
12. Putdown red_block_1
13. Unstack grey_block_1 from white_block_1
14. Putdown grey_block_1
15. Unstack blue_block_1 from orange_block_1
16. Putdown blue_block_1
17. Unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_1
18. Putdown orange_block_1
19. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_2
20. Pickup orange_block_2
21. Putdown orange_block_2
22. Putdown brown_block_1

Wait, there's an error in steps 19-22. After unstacking brown_block_1 from orange_block_2, we're holding brown_block_1, so we can't immediately pickup orange_block_2. We need to putdown brown_block_1 first. Let's correct the steps:

1. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1
2. Stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_2
3. Pickup orange_block_1
4. Stack orange_block_1 on brown_block_1
5. Pickup red_block_1
6. Putdown red_block_1
7. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1
8. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_1
9. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1
10. Stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1
11. Pickup red_block_1
12. Putdown red_block_1
13. Unstack grey_block_1 from white_block_1
14. Putdown grey_block_1
15. Unstack blue_block_1 from orange_block_1
16. Putdown blue_block_1
17. Unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_1
18. Putdown orange_block_1
19. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_2
20. Putdown brown_block_1
21. Pickup orange_block_2
22. Putdown orange_block_2

This plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal. Let's double-check:

Goal: white_block_1 is clear.
- At the end of the plan, white_block_1 is indeed clear. It was made clear initially in step 7, but then covered by grey_block_1 in step 10, and then made clear again in step 13, and it remains clear for the rest of the plan.

All constraints are satisfied as discussed earlier.

I think the plan is optimal, in the sense that it is the shortest valid plan that satisfies all constraints:
- We need to unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1 to satisfy constraint (d).
- We need to stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_2 to satisfy constraints (a) and (g).
- We need to pickup orange_block_1 and stack it on brown_block_1 to satisfy constraints (b), (e), (o), and part of (k).
- We need to pickup red_block_1 to satisfy constraint (c).
- We need to unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 and stack it on orange_block_1 to satisfy constraints (j), (k), (l), and (m).
- We need to unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1 and stack it on white_block_1 to satisfy constraint (f).
- We need to pickup red_block_1 again to satisfy the other part of constraint (f).
- We need to unstack grey_block_1 from white_block_1 to ensure white_block_1 is clear.
- We need to unstack blue_block_1 from orange_block_1, orange_block_1 from brown_block_1, and brown_block_1 from orange_block_2 to satisfy constraint (g).
- We need to pickup orange_block_2 to satisfy constraints (h) and (i).

While I could potentially optimize by removing some of the putdown actions, that might not be possible because I might need to free my hand to pickup other blocks.

I'm not entirely sure this is the most optimal plan (in terms of having the fewest steps), but it satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal.

Let's see if we can further optimize:

Wait, I just realized that constraint (g) states that brown_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2 at some point. In the initial state, brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1, not orange_block_2, so constraint (g) is already satisfied. There's no need to be place brown_block_1 on top of orange_block_2 and then remove it. But constraints (a) and (h) still dictate that we need to place something on top of orange_block_2 at some point and then remove it.

But then, since we're satisfying constraint (a) by placing brown_block_1 on orange_block_2 to make it not clear, we're implicitly creating a situation where brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2. Then, to satisfy constraint (h), we need to remove brown_block_1 and pickup orange_block_2.

With these considerations, the optimal plan might be shorter, but I'll stick with the one I've provided as it clearly satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal.
