Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to make sure that white_block_1 is clear, which means there's nothing on top of it. But there are a bunch of constraints we need to satisfy along the way. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the goal.

Initial State:
- red_block_1 is on the table, with grey_block_1 on top of it, and brown_block_1 on top of grey_block_1. So the stack is red -> grey -> brown. Both brown and red are clear because nothing is on them.
- white_block_1 is on the table, with blue_block_1 on top. Blue is clear.
- orange_block_1 and orange_block_2 are both on the table and clear.
- The arm is empty.

Goal:
- white_block_1 is clear. Currently, blue_block_1 is on it, so we need to remove blue_block_1 from white_block_1.

Constraints:
There are several constraints that must be met in the plan. Let's list them out to make sure I don't miss any:

1. At least once, orange_block_2 must have a block on top (not clear).
2. At least once, orange_block_1 is not on the table (so it's on another block or being held).
3. At least once, holding red_block_1 and orange_block_2 has a block on top.
4. At least once, brown_block_1 is not on the table (so it's on another block or being held).
5. If brown_block_1 is not on the table, then either in that state or later, the arm must be holding orange_block_1.
6. At least once, grey_block_1 is on white_block_1 and red_block_1 is clear.
7. At least once, brown_block_1 is not on orange_block_2.
8. If brown_block_1 is not on orange_block_2, then orange_block_2 must not be on the table at that state or later.
9. At least once, orange_block_2 is not on the table.
10. At least once, holding blue_block_1.
11. If holding blue_block_1 in some state, there must be an earlier state where holding orange_block_1.
12. At least once, blue_block_1 is not clear (has a block on top).
13. If blue_block_1 is not clear, then earlier there was either orange_block_2 not clear or holding orange_block_1.
14. At least once, white_block_1 is not on itself (which is always true, so maybe this is a trick constraint).
15. If white_block_1 is not on itself (which is always true), then in that state or later, orange_block_1 must have a block on top.

Wait, constraint 14 says white_block_1 is not on top of itself. Since a block can't be on itself, this is always true. But the implication in constraint 15 says that whenever this is true (which is always), then in that state or later, orange_block_1 must have something on top. So effectively, after the first action, in every state from that point on, there must be a block on orange_block_1 at some point. But since the final goal might require moving blocks, maybe we can satisfy this by ensuring that orange_block_1 is covered at some point after the plan starts.

Hmm, that's a bit tricky. So after any state where white_block_1 isn't on itself (which is every state), we need to have at some subsequent state orange_block_1 has a block on top. So we need to make sure that at some point, orange_block_1 is covered, possibly after the initial state.

Now, the main goal is to clear white_block_1, which means removing blue_block_1. Let's think about the steps required for that.

To remove blue_block_1 from white_block_1, the arm needs to pick it up (unstack) and put it somewhere else. But blue_block_1 is on white_block_1, so to unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1, the preconditions are that blue is clear (which it is) and the arm is empty. So we can do unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1, then put it down or stack it somewhere.

But we have to consider the constraints. Let's see:

Constraint 10: Must hold blue_block_1 at least once. So unstacking blue would satisfy that. But constraint 11 says that before holding blue, we must have held orange_block_1 at an earlier step. So before we unstack blue, we need to have picked up orange_block_1 at some point before.

So the plan must include picking up orange_block_1 before unstacking blue_block_1. Then, after using orange_block_1, maybe we can put it down again, but constraint 2 says orange_block_1 must not be on the table at least once. So perhaps we stack orange_block_1 onto another block.

Also, constraint 6 requires that grey_block_1 is on white_block_1 and red_block_1 is clear. Currently, grey is on red. So to get grey onto white, we need to unstack brown from grey, then unstack grey from red, then stack grey onto white.

But let's see how that fits. Let's outline possible steps.

First, to clear white_block_1, we need to remove blue_block_1. But before doing that, we need to have held orange_block_1. So maybe first pickup orange_block_1, stack it somewhere, then proceed.

Also, constraints 3, 4, 5: brown_block_1 must be not on the table (so it's on another block or held), and when that happens, we must hold orange_block_1 either then or later. Also, constraint 3 says in some state, holding red_block_1 and orange_block_2 is not clear. So we need to have a block on orange_block_2 and be holding red_block_1.

Moreover, constraint 7 requires that brown_block_1 is not on orange_block_2 at least once. Since initially, brown is on grey, which is on red, so currently brown is not on orange_block_2. So this constraint is already satisfied in the initial state. But wait, the initial state may not count as part of the plan's states. The plan's actions start from the initial state, then each action leads to a new state. So perhaps the initial state is considered, but the constraints need to be met in the plan's states. So if the initial state already satisfies some constraints, maybe that's okay. But we need to check if the problem counts the initial state as part of the states where constraints must hold. The problem says "in at least one state", which includes the initial state only if the condition is already met there. For example, constraint 7: brown_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2. In the initial state, brown is on grey, which is on red. So yes, brown is not on orange_block_2. So the initial state satisfies constraint 7. But then constraint 8 says that if in some state s, brown is not on orange_block_2, then in s or after, orange_block_2 is not on the table. Since the initial state s0 has brown not on orange_block_2, then in s0 or after, orange_block_2 must not be on the table. But in s0, orange_block_2 is on the table, so we need to have a state after s0 where orange_block_2 is not on the table. So constraint 9 also requires orange_block_2 to be not on the table at least once. So we need to make sure that orange_block_2 is moved from the table at some point.

Similarly, constraint 9 requires that orange_block_2 is not on the table at least once. So we need to put it on another block or hold it.

So, putting this all together, here's a possible plan outline:

1. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1. Then put it down or stack it somewhere. But moving brown would allow us to meet constraint 4 (brown not on table). If we put brown on the table, that's not helpful. So maybe stack it on another block. But where? Let's see.

Wait, if we unstack brown from grey, then brown is in the arm. Then we can put it down (putdown), but that would leave it on the table, which doesn't satisfy constraint 4 (needs brown not on table). So we need to stack it somewhere. Let's think: stack brown_block_1 onto orange_block_2. That would make orange_block_2 not clear (satisfying constraint 1), and also, brown is not on the table (satisfying constraint 4). But then, after stacking brown on orange_block_2, constraint 8 comes into play: if brown is not on orange_block_2 (which it was in the initial state, but after stacking, it's on orange_block_2. So the state where brown is not on orange_block_2 would be before that. Wait, no. After stacking brown on orange_block_2, brown is on orange_block_2, so in that state, the condition "brown is not on orange_block_2" is false. But constraint 7 requires that in at least one state, brown is not on orange_block_2. Which is true in the initial state. But then constraint 8 says whenever brown is not on orange_block_2 (like in the initial state), then in that state or later, orange_block_2 is not on the table. So in the initial state, orange_block_2 is on the table. So we need to, after the initial state, have a state where orange_block_2 is not on the table. So by stacking something on orange_block_2, we make it not on the table (since it's under another block). Wait, no. If a block is on the table, putting another block on top of it doesn't move it from the table. The block remains on the table. So orange_block_2 would still be on the table even if we stack brown on it. So to make orange_block_2 not on the table, we need to pick it up and place it on another block. But since the arm can only hold one block, this requires steps.

So, maybe stack brown on orange_block_2 (to satisfy constraint 1 and 4), but that leaves orange_block_2 on the table. So to satisfy constraint 9 (orange_block_2 not on table), we need to have a step where orange_block_2 is moved from the table. But how? The only way is to pick it up. But orange_block_2 is on the table and clear. So we can pick it up and put it on another block. However, that would require holding it. But perhaps after stacking brown on orange_block_2, we need to unstack brown and then pick up orange_block_2. But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe use orange_block_2 as part of a stack. Let's think.

Another approach: To satisfy constraint 9 (orange_block_2 not on table), we need to pick up orange_block_2 and stack it onto another block. But for that, we need to have a clear block to stack on. Let's see: initial state has red, white, orange1, orange2 on table. blue is on white, grey on red, brown on grey. So possible targets for stacking orange2 could be red (if it's clear) but red has grey and brown. White has blue. orange1 is clear. So perhaps stack orange2 onto orange1. But orange1 is on the table. So stack orange2 onto orange1. That would require picking up orange2, then stacking on orange1. Then orange2 is not on the table (satisfies constraint 9). Also, after that, orange_block_1 would have orange2 on top, making it not clear (so constraint 15's implication is satisfied because whenever white_block_1 is not on itself (always true), we need to have orange1 not clear at some point. If we stack orange2 on orange1, then that satisfies that.

But let's outline this:

1. pickup orange_block_2 (preconditions: clear, on table, arm empty. Yes. So action: pickup orange_block_2.

2. stack orange_block_2 onto orange_block_1. Now, orange2 is on orange1, so orange1 is not clear. This satisfies constraint 15's implication. Also, orange2 is not on the table (satisfies constraint 9). Also, this makes orange_block_2 have a block on top (orange2 is on orange1? Wait, no. Stacking orange2 onto orange1 would make orange2 be on top of orange1. So orange1 is not clear, and orange2 is on the table? No. Wait, when you stack a block onto another, the block being stacked is placed on top of the other. So orange2 is on orange1, which is on the table. So orange2 is not on the table anymore. So yes, this satisfies constraint 9. But then, in this state, orange_block_2 is not on the table. Also, since orange2 is on orange1, constraint 2 (orange1 not on table) is not satisfied here. Because orange1 is still on the table. Oh wait, constraint 2 requires that orange1 is not on the table at least once. So we need to have a state where orange1 is either held or on another block. So stacking orange2 on orange1 doesn't take orange1 off the table. So we need to move orange1 off the table. So perhaps pick up orange1 and stack it somewhere else.

But then we have to satisfy constraint 11: before holding blue_block_1, we must have held orange1. So perhaps first handle orange1 and orange2, then proceed.

Let's try to outline steps considering all constraints:

First, handle constraint 3: holding red_block_1 while orange_block_2 is not clear. To get red_block_1, we need to unstack grey and brown from it. But red is under grey, which is under brown. So to get red, we need to first unstack brown from grey, then unstack grey from red. Then pickup red. But that would take several steps.

But perhaps we can do that later. Let's think about the main goal first: clear white_block_1. To do that, we need to unstack blue from white. But before that, we need to have held orange1 (constraint 11). So steps:

1. pickup orange_block_1 (since it's on the table and clear).

2. putdown orange_block_1 (but this leaves it on the table, which doesn't help constraint 2). Alternatively, stack orange1 onto another block. Maybe stack orange1 onto orange2. But orange2 is on the table. So:

But wait, orange2 is clear. So stack orange1 onto orange2. Then orange1 is not on the table (satisfies constraint 2). So steps:

1. pickup orange1 (preconds met).

2. stack orange1 onto orange2. Now, orange1 is on orange2, which is on the table. This satisfies constraint 2 (orange1 not on table) and also makes orange2 not clear (satisfies constraint 1). Also, constraint 3 requires holding red_block_1 while orange2 is not clear. But we haven't handled red yet. So maybe after stacking orange1 on orange2, we can then work on red.

But let's proceed. Now, since constraint 3 requires holding red and orange2 not clear. So after step 2, orange2 is not clear. So if we later pick up red_block_1, we can satisfy constraint 3. But red is currently under grey and brown. So to get red, we need to remove brown and grey.

So steps to unstack brown and grey:

3. unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1. Preconditions: brown is clear (yes), arm is empty (yes after step 2). So action: unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1. Now, holding brown.

4. putdown brown_block_1. But that would put it on the table, which doesn't help constraint 4 (brown not on table). So instead, stack it somewhere. Let's stack brown on orange2. But orange2 has orange1 on top. Wait, orange1 is on orange2. So orange2 is not clear. So can't stack on orange2. Alternatively, stack brown on another block. Maybe stack brown on white_block_1. But white has blue on it. So no. Or stack brown on red_block_1. But red has grey on it. No. Hmm.

Alternatively, stack brown on blue_block_1. Blue is on white. So:

4. stack brown_block_1 on blue_block_1. Preconditions: holding brown, blue is clear (currently, blue is on white and clear). So yes. Stack brown on blue. Now, blue is not clear (satisfies constraint 12), and brown is not on the table (satisfies constraint 4). But constraint 5 says if brown is not on table (which is now true), then in this state or later, the arm must hold orange1. Currently, the arm just stacked brown, so it's empty. So we need to hold orange1 later. But we already held orange1 in step 1. But constraint 5 requires that when brown is not on the table (which starts at step 4), then in that state (step 4) or after, the arm holds orange1. But in step 4, after stacking brown, the arm is empty. So we need to hold orange1 again later. But orange1 is currently on orange2. So to hold it again, we need to unstack it. But orange1 is under orange2? No, after step 2, orange1 is on orange2. So orange2 is on the table with orange1 on top. Wait, no. Stacking orange1 onto orange2: orange1 is placed on top of orange2. So orange2 is on the table, orange1 is on orange2. So orange2 is not clear (since orange1 is on it). So to unstack orange1 from orange2, we need to pick it up. But that's possible. So after step 4, the arm is empty, and orange1 is on orange2. So step 5: unstack orange1 from orange2. Now, holding orange1. This would satisfy constraint 5, because brown is not on the table (since step 4 stacked it on blue), and in step 5, the arm is holding orange1. So that meets the condition.

So step 5: unstack orange_block_1 orange_block_2. Then, we can put it down or stack elsewhere. Maybe stack orange1 on red_block_1. But red has grey on it. Or stack on white_block_1 (but white has blue and brown). Alternatively, put it on the table. But that would put it back on the table, which we need to avoid for constraint 2. Wait, constraint 2 requires that orange1 is not on the table at least once. In step 2, we stacked orange1 onto orange2, so it was not on the table. Then, in step 5, we unstack it, and if we put it down, it's back on the table. So to keep it not on the table, we need to stack it somewhere else. Let's stack orange1 onto red_block_1. But red has grey on it. So grey is on red, which is on the table. To stack orange1 on red, we need red to be clear. But red has grey on it, which is under brown. Wait, no. The initial state has red on table, grey on red, brown on grey. After step 3, we unstacked brown from grey. Then, grey is still on red. So after step 3, grey is on red, and clear (since brown was removed). Then step 4: stack brown on blue. So after step 4, grey is still on red, and clear. So step 5: unstack orange1 from orange2 (holding orange1). Then, step 6: stack orange1 on grey_block_1. Preconditions: holding orange1, grey is clear (yes, since brown was removed). So stack orange1 on grey. Now, orange1 is not on the table, satisfying constraint 2 again. Also, grey is on red, orange1 on grey. But wait, stacking orange1 on grey would make grey not clear. But we need to satisfy constraint 6: grey is on white_block_1 and red is clear. Currently, grey is on red, so we need to move grey to white. Let's plan for that.

Constraint 6 requires that in some state, grey is on white and red is clear. Currently, grey is on red, and red is under grey. To make red clear, we need to remove grey. So we need to unstack grey from red. But first, we need to remove orange1 from grey (if it's there). Wait, after step 6, orange1 is on grey. So to unstack grey from red, we need to first unstack orange1 from grey.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline the steps again, keeping track of the state after each action.

Initial state:

- red: table, grey on red, brown on grey. brown is clear.
- white: table, blue on white. blue is clear.
- orange1: table, clear.
- orange2: table, clear.
- Arm empty.

Step 1: pickup orange1. Now, holding orange1.

Step 2: stack orange1 orange2. Now, orange1 is on orange2. orange2 is on table. orange1 is clear, orange2 is not clear. Arm empty. This satisfies constraint 2 (orange1 not on table) and constraint 1 (orange2 not clear). Also, constraint 15's implication: since white_block_1 is not on itself (always true), we need orange1 to be not clear at some point. Here, after step 2, orange1 is clear (since it's on top of orange2). So that's not enough. Wait, no. When you stack orange1 on orange2, orange1 is clear (nothing on top), and orange2 is not clear. So orange1 is clear. So to satisfy the implication of constraint 15, which requires that after any state where white is not on itself (which is always), there must be a state where orange1 is not clear. So we need to have a state where orange1 has something on top. So maybe later steps will do that.

Step 3: unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1. Now, holding brown.

Step 4: stack brown_block_1 blue_block_1. Now, brown is on blue. blue is on white. brown is clear, blue is not. Arm empty. This satisfies constraint 4 (brown not on table), constraint 12 (blue not clear). Also, constraint 5: when brown is not on table (now), in this state or later, must hold orange1. Currently, arm is empty. So in a later step, need to hold orange1 again.

Step 5: unstack orange_block_1 orange_block_2. Preconditions: orange1 is on orange2, orange1 is clear (after step 2, yes). Arm is empty. So yes. Now, holding orange1.

This satisfies constraint 5, because in step 4, brown is not on table, and in step 5, we hold orange1. So the constraint is met.

Step 6: stack orange_block_1 grey_block_1. Preconditions: holding orange1, grey is clear (grey is on red, and after step 3, grey is clear because brown was removed). So yes. Now, orange1 is on grey, grey is on red. Arm empty. This keeps orange1 not on table (constraint 2 met again).

Now, to satisfy constraint 6: grey on white and red clear. So we need to move grey to white and clear red. Red is currently under grey. To clear red, need to remove grey. To move grey to white, first unstack grey from red.

Step 7: unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1. Preconditions: grey is clear (after step 6, orange1 is on grey, so grey is not clear. So can't unstack. Oops, this is a problem. So after step 6, grey has orange1 on top. So we can't unstack grey from red unless we first remove orange1.

So step 7: unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1. Now, holding orange1. Then step 8: putdown orange1. But that puts it on the table, which violates constraint 2 (orange1 must not be on table at least once). So instead, stack it somewhere else. Maybe stack orange1 on white_block_1. But white has blue and brown on it. So can't stack there. Alternatively, stack on red_block_1. But red is under grey. Wait, after step 7, grey is unstacked from red. So red is clear. So step 7: unstack grey from red (but first, remove orange1 from grey).

Wait, let's backtrack. After step 6, orange1 is on grey, which is on red. So grey is not clear. So to unstack grey from red, we need to first remove orange1 from grey.

Step 7: unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1. Now, holding orange1.

Step 8: putdown orange1. Now, orange1 is on table. But constraint 2 says it must not be on the table at least once. We already achieved that in step 2. So putting it down now is okay. But maybe better to stack it elsewhere.

But let's proceed:

Step 8: putdown orange_block_1. Now, orange1 is on table. But constraint 2 requires that at some point, orange1 is not on the table. Which we already did in step 2. So this is acceptable.

Now, grey_block_1 is on red_block_1 and clear. So step 9: unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1. Now, holding grey.

Step 10: stack grey_block_1 white_block_1. Preconditions: holding grey, white is clear. But white has blue and brown on it. So blue is on white, and brown is on blue. So white is not clear. So can't stack grey on white. So this approach won't work. Need to first remove blue and brown from white.

Ah, right! The main goal is to clear white_block_1, which requires removing blue_block_1. So before we can stack grey on white, we need to remove blue and brown from white.

Let's adjust the plan.

After step 4: brown is stacked on blue, which is on white. So white has blue and brown. To clear white, we need to remove both.

First, unstack brown from blue:

Step 5: unstack brown_block_1 blue_block_1. Preconditions: brown is clear (yes, since it's on top of blue), arm is empty (after step 4, yes). So unstack brown_block_1 blue_block_1. Now, holding brown.

Step 6: putdown brown_block_1. Now, brown is on table. But constraint 4 requires brown not on table. So this is bad. Instead, stack brown somewhere else. Maybe stack brown on orange2 (which has orange1 on it). But orange2 has orange1, which is clear. Wait, after step 2, orange1 is on orange2. So orange2 is not clear. So can stack on orange2? No, because to stack on a block, it must be clear. So orange2 has orange1 on top, so it's not clear. So can't stack on orange2. Hmm.

Alternatively, stack brown on red_block_1. But red has grey on it. So grey is on red. To stack on red, red must be clear. So need to remove grey first. But that's a longer process.

This is getting very tangled. Maybe a different approach is needed.

Alternative plan outline focusing on the main goal and integrating constraints step by step:

Main goal: Clear white_block_1 (remove blue_block_1).

Constraints to satisfy:

- Must hold orange1 before holding blue (constraint 11).

- Must have orange2 not on table (constraint 9), which requires moving it.

- Must have brown not on table (constraint 4), which requires moving it from grey.

- Must have grey on white and red clear (constraint 6).

Let's try to handle these step by step.

1. Unstack brown from grey (to satisfy constraint 4 by moving brown off table).

   Action: unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1.

   Now, holding brown.

2. Stack brown on orange2. This makes orange2 not clear (constraint 1), and brown not on table (constraint 4).

   Action: stack brown_block_1 orange_block_2.

   Now, orange2 has brown on top. Arm is empty.

3. Now, need to ensure that when brown is not on table (which it is now), we must hold orange1 in this state or later. So at some point after step 2, pick up orange1.

4. Unstack grey from red (since after step 1, grey is clear).

   Action: unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1.

   Now, holding grey.

5. Stack grey on white_block_1. This satisfies constraint 6 (grey on white), but white has blue on it. So need to first clear white.

Wait, white has blue_block_1, which is on the table. Wait, no. Initially, white_block_1 has blue on it. So to stack grey on white, we need to remove blue first.

But the main goal is to clear white_block_1, which requires removing blue. So let's work on that.

6. To remove blue, need to unstack it from white. But before that, must have held orange1 (constraint 11). So:

   Action: pickup orange_block_1 (on table, clear).

7. Now, holding orange1. Stack it somewhere. To meet constraint 2 (orange1 not on table), stack it on red_block_1 (which is now clear after step 4).

   Action: stack orange_block_1 red_block_1.

   Now, red has orange1 on top. Arm empty.

8. Now, unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1.

   Action: unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1.

   Now, holding blue.

9. Putdown blue_block_1. This satisfies the main goal (white is clear).

But need to satisfy constraint 10 (hold blue_block_1), which is done in step 8.

Now, check other constraints:

Constraint 3: hold red_block_1 and orange2 not clear. Currently, red has orange1 on top. To hold red, need to unstack orange1 from red. But after step 7, orange1 is on red. So:

10. Unstack orange_block_1 red_block_1.

    Now, holding orange1.

11. Putdown orange1 (on table). But this puts it back, but constraint 2 is already met.

12. pickup red_block_1 (now clear).

    Now, holding red.

    At this point, orange2 has brown on top (from step 2), so orange2 is not clear. So this satisfies constraint 3 (holding red and orange2 not clear).

But this adds several steps. Also, need to check other constraints:

Constraint 7: brown not on orange2. But in step 2, we stacked brown on orange2. So in the initial state, brown wasn't on orange2. But after step 2, it is. So constraint 7 requires that at least once, brown is not on orange2. The initial state satisfies this, but if the plan includes steps after step 2 where brown is moved from orange2, then it would also satisfy. But if brown stays on orange2, then the only state where brown is not on orange2 is the initial state. However, constraint 7 says "at least one state" must have brown not on orange2. The initial state does that. But constraint 8 says that whenever brown is not on orange2 (like in the initial state), then in that state or later, orange2 is not on the table. In the initial state, orange2 is on the table, so we need to have a later state where orange2 is not on the table. But in step 2, we stacked brown on orange2, but orange2 is still on the table. So to satisfy constraint 9 (orange2 not on table), we need to pick up orange2 and move it. But how?

Alternatively, after step 2, if we unstack brown from orange2 and stack it elsewhere, then orange2 is back on the table. So perhaps we need to move orange2 off the table by stacking it on another block.

But this is getting very complex. Perhaps there's a more optimal path.

Alternative approach focusing on the main goal and key constraints:

Main goal: clear white_block_1 by removing blue_block_1.

Constraints:

- Must hold orange1 before holding blue.

- After moving brown off the table, must hold orange1.

- Other constraints.

Let's try:

1. pickup orange1 (satisfies part of constraint 11).

2. stack orange1 onto orange2 (now orange1 is not on table, orange2 has a block on top).

3. unstack brown from grey (moving brown off table).

4. stack brown on orange2 (orange2 now has brown on top, but already had orange1. Wait, no. After step 2, orange1 is on orange2. To stack brown on orange2, we need orange2 to be clear, which it's not (since orange1 is on it). So this is invalid.

So steps 2 and 4 can't be done. So alternative:

After step 1 (pickup orange1), stack it somewhere else. Maybe stack orange1 on red_block_1. To do that, need red to be clear. But red has grey and brown on it. So need to unstack brown and grey first.

1. unstack brown from grey.

2. stack brown on orange2.

3. unstack grey from red.

4. stack grey on white_block_1. But white has blue on it. Need to remove blue.

5. unstack blue from white (requires holding orange1 first).

But we need to have held orange1 before unstacking blue. So steps:

5. pickup orange1 (but where is it? Initially, orange1 is on table. After step 1, we unstacked brown. So if we haven't moved orange1 yet, it's still on the table.

Wait, let's re-order:

1. unstack brown from grey.

2. stack brown on orange2.

3. unstack grey from red.

4. stack grey on white. But white has blue. So first, remove blue.

5. To remove blue from white, unstack it. But before that, must hold orange1 (constraint 11). So:

5. pickup orange1.

6. stack orange1 somewhere (e.g., red, which is now clear after step 3).

7. unstack blue from white. Now, holding blue.

8. putdown blue.

Now, white is clear. Main goal achieved.

But need to check constraints:

- constraint 3: holding red_block_1 and orange2 not clear. We need to hold red at some point when orange2 has a block. In step 2, we stacked brown on orange2. So after step 2, orange2 has brown. Then, if we pick up red, which is clear after step 3 (grey was moved to white), then:

9. pickup red_block_1 (now clear).

Now, holding red while orange2 has brown. This satisfies constraint 3.

But how to get red clear? After step 3, grey was unstacked from red, so red is clear.

So step 9: pickup red_block_1.

This satisfies constraint 3.

Now, let's check other constraints:

- constraint 6: grey on white and red clear. After step 4, grey is on white, and red is clear (step 3 unstacked grey from red). So yes.

- constraint 4: brown not on table. In step 2, stacked on orange2. Yes.

- constraint 5: when brown not on table (step 2 onwards), must hold orange1 in that state or later. In step 5, pickup orange1. So yes.

- constraint 9: orange2 not on table. But in step 2, orange2 is on table with brown on top. So orange2 is still on the table. So constraint 9 is not satisfied. Therefore, we need to move orange2 off the table. To do that, need to pick it up and stack it somewhere.

But how? After step 2, orange2 has brown on top. So to pick up orange2, need to unstack brown from orange2 first.

So steps:

10. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2.

11. putdown brown_block_1 (now brown is on table, violating constraint 4). So instead, stack brown elsewhere.

11. stack brown_block_1 on another block. Maybe stack on red_block_1, which is being held in step 9.

Wait, after step 9, we are holding red. So step 9: pickup red.

Then step 10: unstack brown from orange2 (requires arm empty). So can't do that while holding red.

This is getting too complex. Perhaps there's a better way.

Alternative plan to satisfy orange2 not on table:

After step 2: brown is on orange2, which is on the table. To move orange2 off table, pick it up. But orange2 has brown on top. So first, unstack brown from orange2:

10. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2.

11. stack brown_block_1 somewhere else, maybe on red_block_1 (which is clear after step 3).

11. stack brown_block_1 red_block_1.

Now, red has brown, and orange2 is clear. But this makes brown on table again, which violates constraint 4. No, because red is on the table, so stacking brown on red means brown is not on the table. So constraint 4 is still satisfied.

Then, pick up orange2:

12. pickup orange_block_2.

13. stack orange_block_2 somewhere. Maybe on white_block_1, but white is clear (after step 8). But we need to keep white clear. So stack on another block.

13. stack orange_block_2 grey_block_1 (grey is on white). This makes orange2 not on table, satisfying constraint 9.

But this adds many steps. This seems necessary to satisfy constraint 9.

But this plan is getting very long. The problem requires an optimal plan, which is the shortest possible. So perhaps there's a way to satisfy all constraints with fewer steps.

Alternative idea: Use orange_block_2 as part of a tower that is moved off the table. For example, stack orange1 on orange2, then stack both on another block. But need to check preconditions.

Let's try:

1. pickup orange1.

2. stack orange1 orange2. Now, orange1 is on orange2, which is on table. orange2 not clear. (constraint 1 and 2 satisfied).

3. unstack brown from grey.

4. stack brown orange1. Now, brown is on orange1, which is on orange2. orange1 not clear. (brown not on table, constraint 4).

Now, constraint 5: when brown is not on table (step 4), must hold orange1 at that state or later. But in step 4, we are holding nothing (after stacking). So need to hold orange1 later. So:

5. unstack brown orange1.

6. stack brown somewhere else. Maybe on red_block_1 (clear after unstacking grey).

But first, unstack grey from red:

7. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1.

8. stack grey white_block_1. But white has blue.

So need to remove blue first:

9. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1. But need to have held orange1 before (constraint 11). Since we held orange1 in step 1, which is before step 9, this is satisfied.

9. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1 (holding blue).

10. putdown blue_block_1. Now, white is clear (goal achieved).

Now, stack grey on white (step 8 would be after removing blue).

This is getting too convoluted. Maybe I need to accept that the plan will have many steps and try to outline them systematically.

Final attempt:

1. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1. (brown is clear, arm empty). Now holding brown.

2. stack brown_block_1 orange_block_2. (orange2 now has brown; satisfies constraint 1 and 4). Arm empty.

3. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1. (grey is clear after step 1). Now holding grey.

4. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1. (can't do this yet; need to hold orange1 first per constraint 11. So insert steps before this.)

So:

3. pickup orange_block_1. (clear, on table). Now holding orange1.

4. stack orange_block_1 red_block_1. (red is clear after step 2). Now, orange1 is on red. Arm empty. This satisfies constraint 2 (orange1 not on table).

5. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1. Now holding grey.

6. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1. But white has blue. So need to unstack blue first.

7. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1. (now, since we held orange1 in step 3, before holding blue here, constraint 11 is satisfied). Now holding blue.

8. putdown blue_block_1. Now white is clear (goal achieved).

9. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1. Now white has grey. grey is clear. This satisfies constraint 6 (grey on white and red clear, since red has orange1).

Now, check other constraints:

- constraint 3: holding red_block_1 and orange2 not clear. Need to hold red. Currently, red has orange1. So unstack orange1 from red.

10. unstack orange_block_1 red_block_1. Now holding orange1.

11. pickup red_block_1. (red is clear). Now holding red. At this point, orange2 has brown (from step 2), so orange2 is not clear. This satisfies constraint 3.

- constraint 9: orange2 not on table. But in step 2, orange2 is on the table with brown on top. So orange2 is still on the table. So need to move it. To do that:

12. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2. (brown is on orange2, clear). Now holding brown.

13. stack brown_block_1 red_block_1. (red is in arm? No. Wait, step 11: holding red. So step 11: pickup red. Then step 12: unstack brown from orange2 requires arm empty. So need to put down red first.

This is getting too complex. I think I'm missing a more optimal path.

Perhaps the optimal plan is:

1. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1.

2. stack brown_block_1 orange_block_2. (satisfies constraints 1 and 4)

3. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1.

4. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1. (but white has blue. So need to unstack blue first)

5. pickup orange_block_1. (to satisfy constraint 11 before unstacking blue)

6. stack orange_block_1 grey_block_1. (orange1 not on table, grey is clear)

7. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1. (now holding blue)

8. putdown blue_block_1. (white is clear, goal met)

9. unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1. (to satisfy constraint 6: grey on white and red clear. After step 4, grey is on white. After step 3, red is clear. So constraint 6 is met after step 4 and 3.

But in step 6, orange1 is on grey. So after step 6, grey is not clear. Need to unstack orange1 from grey to make grey clear again.

But this adds steps.

This is really challenging. Perhaps the optimal plan is as follows:

```
Action: unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
Action: stack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
Action: unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1
Action: stack grey_block_1 white_block_1
Action: pickup orange_block_1
Action: stack orange_block_1 grey_block_1
Action: unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
Action: putdown blue_block_1
```

But this plan doesn't satisfy all constraints. For example, constraint 9 requires orange_block_2 not on the table. In this plan, orange_block_2 is on the table with brown on top. So orange_block_2 is still on the table. So we need to move it.

So additional steps:

Action: unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
Action: stack brown_block_1 red_block_1
Action: pickup orange_block_2
Action: stack orange_block_2 brown_block_1

But this makes the plan longer. It's clear that this problem requires a careful balance between achieving the goal and satisfying all constraints. Due to the complexity, the optimal plan would need to efficiently combine steps that satisfy multiple constraints at once. After several iterations, I think the correct plan involves moving brown to orange2, moving grey to white after removing blue (with proper ordering to satisfy constraints), and handling the orange blocks appropriately.
