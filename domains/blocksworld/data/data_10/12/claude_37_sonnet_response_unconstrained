Let's break down the problem:

We have 7 blocks: red_block_1, white_block_1, grey_block_1, brown_block_1, blue_block_1, orange_block_1, orange_block_2.

Initial state:
- red_block_1 is on the table.
- white_block_1 is on the table.
- grey_block_1 is on top of red_block_1.
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1.
- blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1.
- orange_block_1 is on the table.
- orange_block_2 is on the table.
- brown_block_1, blue_block_1, orange_block_1, and orange_block_2 are clear.
- The robot arm is not holding any block.

Goal state:
- white_block_1 is clear.

In the initial state, blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1. So, to make white_block_1 clear, we need to remove blue_block_1 from it.

Let's plan the actions:

1. We need to pick up blue_block_1 from white_block_1 using the "unstack" action.
2. After unstacking, the robot arm will be holding blue_block_1. We can either put it on the table or stack it on top of another clear block.

Let's assume we put it on the table using the "putdown" action.

Plan:
1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
2. putdown blue_block_1

Let's verify this plan:

After "unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1":
- The robot arm is holding blue_block_1.
- white_block_1 is clear.
- The goal state is achieved!

Wait, I need to put down blue_block_1 too, otherwise the robot arm is still holding it. So the final plan would be:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
2. putdown blue_block_1

Checking the validity of the plan:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1:
   - Preconditions: blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, blue_block_1 is clear, and the robot arm is not holding any block. All these conditions are met.
   - Effects: The robot arm is holding blue_block_1, blue_block_1 is no longer on top of white_block_1, and white_block_1 is clear.

2. putdown blue_block_1:
   - Preconditions: The robot arm is holding blue_block_1. This condition is met after the first action.
   - Effects: blue_block_1 is on the table, blue_block_1 is clear, and the robot arm is not holding any block.

After executing both actions, white_block_1 is clear, which is the goal state.

So, the optimal plan is:

```
unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
```

But actually let's think: can we make a shorter plan? The goal is to make white_block_1 clear. We achieve that after the first action, "unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1". But we need to ensure all preconditions are satisfied. 

Are there any preconditions that require the robot arm to be empty? Let's check:

- For the "pickup" action, the robot arm must be empty.
- For the "unstack" action, the robot arm must be empty.
- For the "putdown" and "stack" actions, the robot arm must be holding the block to be put down or stacked.

So if the goal is just to make white_block_1 clear, then a plan consisting of just one action:

```
unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
```

would actually achieve the goal. But the robot arm would be holding blue_block_1 at the end. However, the goal doesn't specify that the robot arm needs to be empty.

Let me double-check the goal again: "there is no block on top of white_block_1, i.e., white_block_1 is clear". Yes, the goal is just to make white_block_1 clear. It doesn't say anything about the robot arm being empty.

So, the optimal plan to achieve the goal is just one action:

```
unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
```

Actually, let me check the goal state more carefully.

Goal state: "there is no block on top of white_block_1, i.e., white_block_1 is clear"

The goal state doesn't specify anything about the robot arm. It only cares about white_block_1 being clear. After the action "unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1", the robot arm is holding blue_block_1, but white_block_1 is clear. So, the goal is achieved.

However, in real-world scenarios, it's often expected that the robot arm should be free at the end of a task. But since this isn't explicitly stated in the goal, and the problem asks for an optimal (shortest) plan, I believe the one-action plan is correct.

Let me do one more check for clarity:

After "unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1":
- The robot arm is holding blue_block_1.
- white_block_1 is clear.
- The goal state "there is no block on top of white_block_1, i.e., white_block_1 is clear" is achieved.

So the optimal plan is:

```
unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
```

...

On second thought, let me review the problem statement again. The goal is: "there is no block on top of white_block_1, i.e., white_block_1 is clear".

In the initial state, blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1. After the "unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1" action, blue_block_1 is no longer on top of white_block_1, meaning white_block_1 is now clear. This perfectly matches the goal.

Though the robot arm is now holding blue_block_1, the goal doesn't care about the state of the robot arm. It only cares about white_block_1 being clear. So, our one-action plan should be correct.

However, if I've misunderstood the problem or if there's a specific reason why the robot arm should be free at the end, please let me know, and I'll adjust the plan accordingly.

To summarize, the optimal plan to achieve the goal of making white_block_1 clear is:

```
unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
```

Actually let's just double-check what the problem says about optimality:

"You need to provide an optimal plan, i.e., a valid plan whose length is equal or less than the length of any other valid plan."

Our plan contains just one action, and no valid plan with zero actions can achieve the goal. Thus, our one-action plan is indeed optimal.
