Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to have the robotic arm holding brown_block_1. But there are a bunch of constraints we need to satisfy along the way. Let's start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

First, the initial state:

- brown_block_1 is on the table, with white_block_1 on top of it. Since white_block_1 is clear, nothing is on top of it.
- yellow_block_1 is on the table, with grey_block_1 on top, then black_block_1, and white_block_2 on top of black_block_1. So the tower here is yellow_block_1 < grey_block_1 < black_block_1 < white_block_2. All these except the bottom are clear except maybe the top.
- red_block_1 is on the table and clear.
- The arm is empty.

The goal is to be holding brown_block_1. To pick up brown_block_1, it must be clear and on the table. Right now, white_block_1 is on it. So we need to remove white_block_1 first. That means unstacking white_block_1 from brown_block_1. But wait, unstack requires that the block being unstacked (white_block_1) is clear, which it is. Also, the arm must be empty. So the first step would be to unstack white_block_1 from brown_block_1. Then put it down or stack it somewhere else. But let's check the constraints.

Looking at the constraints:

1. "brown_block_1 is not on the table" must be true at least once. Since initially it's on the table, we need to move it. But how? The only way is to stack it onto another block. But to stack, we need to be holding it and have a clear target block. So after picking up brown_block_1, we can stack it somewhere, but that would make it not on the table. However, the goal is to be holding it. So perhaps after stacking it and then unstacking again? But that seems unnecessary. Wait, the goal is to end up holding it. So maybe we need to pick it up, then do some actions, but the final action would be to pick it up again. Hmm, but once you put it down, you need to pick it up again. Let's see.

Wait, the final goal is to be holding brown_block_1. So the last action must be either picking it up from the table or unstacking it from another block. Since initially, it's under white_block_1, which we need to remove first.

So the initial steps would be:

1. unstack white_block_1 from brown_block_1. Then we're holding white_block_1.
2. putdown white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is on the table, clear. Then we can pickup brown_block_1. But wait, after putting down white_block_1, brown_block_1 is on the table and clear. So we can pick it up. But then the plan would be:

unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1
putdown white_block_1
pickup brown_block_1

But this gives the goal. However, we need to check all constraints.

But the constraints require several things. Let's list them:

Constraints:

C1: brown_block_1 not on table at least once. So in the above plan, after step 3, brown_block_1 is being held, so it's not on the table. So that's satisfied.

But then, according to C2: if brown_block_1 is not on table in state s, then either in s or after, white_block_1 is not clear (i.e., something on top) and red_block_1 is not on table. So when brown_block_1 is being held (after pickup), that's a state where it's not on the table. So in that state, we need to ensure that eventually, white_block_1 has something on top and red_block_1 is not on table. But in this plan, after putting down white_block_1, it's on the table and clear. Then when we pick up brown_block_1, brown_block_1 is not on table. So at that point, the constraint C2 requires that either in that state or later, white_block_1 has something on top and red_block_1 is not on table. But in this plan, after step 3, red_block_1 is still on the table, and white_block_1 is clear. So this violates the constraint. Therefore, this plan is invalid.

So we need to make sure that after brown_block_1 is not on the table (i.e., when we pick it up), there must be some action that causes white_block_1 to have a block on top and red_block_1 to not be on the table.

Wait, but the goal is to have the arm holding brown_block_1. So perhaps after picking up brown_block_1, we need to do something else to satisfy those conditions before putting it down again. But the final state is holding it, so the plan can't end with putting it down. Hmm, this complicates things.

Let me think. Let's outline all constraints and see which ones need to be satisfied.

Other constraints:

C3: At least once, grey_block_1 is clear and holding black_block_1.

C4: At least once, holding white_block_2 and red_block_1 has a block on top (not clear).

C5: At least once, brown_block_1 is clear.

C6: If brown_block_1 is clear in state s, then yellow_block_1 is on grey_block_1 at s or later.

C7: white_block_1 must be on the table at some state, but only after brown_block_1 was not on the table (from C8: if white_block_1 is on table in some state, there must be an earlier state where brown_block_1 is not on table).

C9: Must hold white_block_1 at least once.

C10: If holding white_block_1 in s, then in s or later, white_block_2 has a block on top.

C11: At least once, white_block_2 is not clear and holding red_block_1.

C12: At least once, white_block_2 not clear and black_block_1 is clear.

C13: At least once, black_block_1 is not clear.

C14: If black_block_1 is not clear in s, then yellow_block_1 is on red_block_1 at s or later.

C15: At least once, yellow_block_1 is not clear.

C16: If yellow_block_1 is not clear in s, then black_block_1 is clear in s or later.

Wow, this is a lot. Let's try to handle these step by step.

First, the main goal is to hold brown_block_1. But the constraints require several intermediate states. Let's see how we can satisfy them while achieving the goal.

Starting with the initial steps: to pick up brown_block_1, we need to first unstack white_block_1 from it.

So step 1: unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1. Now holding white_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear and on table.

But according to C5, we need brown_block_1 to be clear at least once, which is satisfied here. Then C6 says that if brown_block_1 is clear in a state, then yellow_block_1 must be on grey_block_1 at that state or later. But in the initial state, yellow_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top, so yellow_block_1 is not clear. So yellow_block_1 is under grey_block_1. So to get yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1, that's already the case. Wait, no: the initial state is yellow_block_1 is on the table, with grey_block_1 on top. So grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_1. So to have yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1, we need to invert that. So that's a new configuration.

But C6 requires that if brown_block_1 is clear (which is after step 1), then in that state or later, yellow_block_1 must be on grey_block_1. So in the current state after step 1, yellow_block_1 is under grey_block_1. So that's not satisfying the condition. Therefore, we need to have yellow_block_1 on top of grey_block_1 at some point after brown_block_1 is clear.

So after step 1, we need to stack yellow_block_1 onto grey_block_1. But wait, yellow_block_1 is on the table with grey_block_1 on top. So to stack yellow_block_1 onto grey_block_1, we need to first unstack grey_block_1 from yellow_block_1. But grey_block_1 has black_block_1 on top. So the tower is yellow_block_1 < grey_block_1 < black_block_1 < white_block_2.

To get yellow_block_1 onto grey_block_1, we need to move grey_block_1 somewhere else, then put yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1. But this seems complicated. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe we can unstack the entire tower above yellow_block_1. Let's see: grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_1, which is on the table. To unstack grey_block_1, we need to have nothing on top of it. But black_block_1 is on grey_block_1, so we need to unstack black_block_1 first. Then unstack grey_block_1, then put yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1. But this might take several steps.

But considering the constraints, let's note that C15 requires yellow_block_1 to have a block on top (not clear) at least once. Initially, grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_1, so that's already satisfied. Wait, no: the initial state says grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, so yellow_block_1 is not clear. So C15 is already satisfied in the initial state. So perhaps that constraint is already met. But the problem says "the original state of the world" as given, but the constraints may need to be checked during the plan.

Wait, the constraints must hold in at least one state in the plan. So if the initial state already satisfies some constraints, but the plan doesn't include that state (since the plan starts from the initial state and applies actions), but the initial state is part of the plan's states. So for example, if a constraint requires that "yellow_block_1 is not clear" in at least one state, the initial state already satisfies that. So maybe some constraints are already met. However, the plan might modify things, so we need to make sure that the required constraints are still met during the plan's execution.

But let's proceed. Let's try to outline the steps considering the constraints.

First, the main steps to get brown_block_1 into the hand:

1. unstack white_block_1 from brown_block_1. Now holding white_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear and on table.

Now, to satisfy C2: after brown_block_1 is not on table (which will happen when we pick it up), we need white_block_1 to have something on top and red_block_1 not on table. But in the current state after step 1, brown_block_1 is still on the table (we just removed white_block_1). So when do we make brown_block_1 not on table? That would be when we pick it up. So let's say after step 1, we putdown white_block_1, then pickup brown_block_1. At that point, brown_block_1 is not on the table. Then, according to C2, we need to have white_block_1 not clear (something on top) and red_block_1 not on table (i.e., red_block_1 is being held or stacked somewhere).

So after picking up brown_block_1, we need to ensure that in the same state or later, those two conditions are met. But if the plan ends here (holding brown_block_1), then those conditions aren't met. Therefore, the plan can't just end here. We need to perform additional actions after picking up brown_block_1 to satisfy C2.

But the goal is to end with holding brown_block_1. So we need to pick it up as the last action. Therefore, we need to have a plan where we pick up brown_block_1, then do some actions that satisfy the constraints, then perhaps put it down and pick it up again. But that would make the plan longer. Alternatively, maybe we can satisfy the constraints before picking up brown_block_1.

Alternatively, maybe after picking up brown_block_1 (making it not on the table), we can stack it onto another block, which would make it not on the table, and then unstack it again to hold it. But that would require more steps. Let's consider.

Let's outline possible steps:

1. unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1 → hold white_block_1, brown_block_1 clear.

2. putdown white_block_1 → white_block_1 on table, clear.

3. pickup brown_block_1 → holding brown_block_1, which is not on table (satisfies C1). Now, according to C2, we need in this state or later to have white_block_1 not clear and red_block_1 not on table.

So after step 3, we need to perform actions that:

- Put something on white_block_1.

- Move red_block_1 from the table (either pick it up or stack it).

But we are currently holding brown_block_1. So to stack or putdown, but putting down would make brown_block_1 back on table, which might not be desired.

Alternatively, stack brown_block_1 onto some block, then do other actions.

Let's say:

4. stack brown_block_1 onto red_block_1. But red_block_1 is clear. So stack requires that we are holding brown_block_1 and red_block_1 is clear. Yes. So stack brown_block_1 red_block_1. Now, brown_block_1 is on red_block_1, red_block_1 is not clear. Also, brown_block_1 is not on table (satisfies C1 again). But after this, we can then unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1 to hold it again as the final step.

But let's check C2. In state after step 3 (holding brown_block_1), brown_block_1 is not on table. So we need to have white_block_1 not clear and red_block_1 not on table in that state or later. In step 4, after stacking, red_block_1 is not on table (it's under brown_block_1, so it's on the table but has a block on top. Wait, red_block_1 is on the table, but after stacking brown_block_1 on it, red_block_1 is still on the table, but now has brown_block_1 on top. So red_block_1 is not on table? No, it's on the table with a block on top. The "not on table" condition is only true if the block is being held or stacked on another block. Wait, no. A block is on the table unless it's stacked on another block. So red_block_1 is still on the table but has brown_block_1 on top. So red_block_1 is on the table, but not clear. Therefore, red_block_1 is on the table. So the condition for C2 is that red_block_1 is not on the table. So stacking brown_block_1 on red_block_1 doesn't take red_block_1 off the table; it remains on the table. Therefore, to make red_block_1 not on the table, we need to stack it on another block. But red_block_1 is initially on the table. So to get red_block_1 not on the table, we need to stack it onto another block.

But in step 4, after stacking brown_block_1 onto red_block_1, red_block_1 is still on the table. So to get red_block_1 off the table, we need to have it be stacked on another block. But how? We would need to pick up red_block_1 and stack it. But after step 4, the arm is empty. So step 5: pickup red_block_1. But red_block_1 has brown_block_1 on top, so it's not clear. Therefore, cannot pick it up. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, maybe we need to stack red_block_1 onto another block before stacking brown_block_1 on it. But that complicates the plan.

Alternatively, let's think of another approach. Let's say after step 3 (holding brown_block_1), we need to put it down somewhere else, but that would make it on the table again. Not helpful. Alternatively, stack it on a block that is not on the table. Wait, all blocks are either on the table or on another block. So to get a block not on the table, it's stacked on another block. But we need to find a way to move red_block_1 off the table. Let's see.

Alternative steps:

After step 3 (holding brown_block_1), we can stack it onto another block. Let's say we stack it onto white_block_1 (which is on the table). But white_block_1 is clear. So stack brown_block_1 white_block_1. Now, brown_block_1 is on white_block_1, which is on the table. Now, white_block_1 is not clear (has brown_block_1 on top), and red_block_1 is still on the table. But this satisfies the white_block_1 part of C2, but not the red_block_1 part. So we need to do something with red_block_1.

So maybe after stacking brown_block_1 on white_block_1 (step 4), we can then work on moving red_block_1.

But then, to satisfy C2, red_block_1 needs to not be on the table. So we need to stack red_block_1 onto another block.

But red_block_1 is on the table and clear. So step 5: pickup red_block_1. Then stack it somewhere. Let's say stack red_block_1 onto yellow_block_1. But yellow_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top. So to stack red_block_1 onto yellow_block_1, yellow_block_1 must be clear. But it's not. So we need to clear yellow_block_1 first.

The tower on yellow_block_1 is yellow_block_1 < grey_block_1 < black_block_1 < white_block_2.

So to clear yellow_block_1, we need to remove grey_block_1. To remove grey_block_1, we need to remove black_block_1 and white_block_2 first.

So steps to remove grey_block_1:

5. unstack white_block_2 black_block_1 → holding white_block_2.

6. putdown white_block_2 → now white_block_2 is on table, clear.

7. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1 → holding black_block_1.

8. putdown black_block_1 → on table, clear.

9. unstack grey_block_1 yellow_block_1 → holding grey_block_1.

10. putdown grey_block_1 → on table, clear.

Now, yellow_block_1 is clear. Then we can stack red_block_1 onto it.

But this is a lot of steps. Let's see if this is necessary.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. Let's see.

But let's consider the constraints again. We also have to satisfy C3: at least once, grey_block_1 is clear and holding black_block_1. To have grey_block_1 clear, we need to remove whatever is on top. In the initial state, grey_block_1 has black_block_1 on top. So to clear grey_block_1, we need to unstack black_block_1, which requires unstacking white_block_2 first.

So steps to achieve C3:

unstack white_block_2 black_block_1 → holding white_block_2.

putdown white_block_2.

unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1 → holding black_block_1. Now, grey_block_1 is clear. So this satisfies C3 (grey_block_1 clear and holding black_block_1). So steps 5 and 6 (unstack white_block_2 and putdown) and step 7 (unstack black_block_1). At step 7, we're holding black_block_1 and grey_block_1 is clear. So this meets C3. So these steps are necessary.

Similarly, other constraints need to be addressed.

But this is getting complicated. Let's try to map out a plan that satisfies all constraints while achieving the goal.

Possible plan outline:

1. unstack white_block_1 from brown_block_1. Now holding white_block_1. brown_block_1 is clear (C5 met here).

2. stack white_block_1 onto red_block_1. This requires red_block_1 is clear (which it is). Now, red_block_1 has white_block_1 on top (so red_block_1 not clear), and white_block_1 is not clear. This helps with C2 (after brown_block_1 is not on table, which will be when we pick it up, we need red_block_1 not on table. Wait, no. Stacking white_block_1 onto red_block_1 leaves red_block_1 on the table but not clear. So red_block_1 is still on the table. So that doesn't satisfy C2's requirement that red_block_1 is not on the table. So this approach won't work.

Alternative approach: After step 1, putdown white_block_1. Then pickup brown_block_1. Now brown_block_1 is not on table (C1 met). But then we need to handle C2: in this state or later, white_block_1 must have something on top and red_block_1 not on table.

So after step 3 (holding brown_block_1), we need to:

- Put something on white_block_1.

- Move red_block_1 off the table.

But how? Since we are holding brown_block_1, we can't pick up another block. So perhaps stack brown_block_1 onto some block, then proceed.

So step 4: stack brown_block_1 onto yellow_block_1. But yellow_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top. So yellow_block_1 is not clear. Cannot stack. Alternatively, stack onto grey_block_1? grey_block_1 has black_block_1 on top. So no.

Alternatively, stack brown_block_1 onto black_block_1. But black_block_1 has white_block_2 on top. So no.

Alternatively, stack onto white_block_2. white_block_2 is clear. So step 4: stack brown_block_1 white_block_2. Now brown_block_1 is on white_block_2. Then, the arm is empty.

Now, to address red_block_1: we can pickup red_block_1 (it's clear) and stack it somewhere. Let's say stack red_block_1 onto white_block_1 (which is on the table). Then red_block_1 is on white_block_1, so red_block_1 is not on the table (since it's stacked on white_block_1, which is on the table. Wait, no: if a block is stacked on another block that's on the table, the first block is not on the table. So red_block_1 would be on white_block_1, which is on the table. So red_block_1 is not on the table. So that works.

So steps:

4. stack brown_block_1 white_block_2 → brown_block_1 on white_block_2, arm empty.

5. pickup red_block_1 → holding red_block_1.

6. stack red_block_1 white_block_1 → red_block_1 on white_block_1. Now, white_block_1 has red_block_1 on top (not clear), and red_block_1 is not on the table. So this satisfies C2's requirements when brown_block_1 was not on the table (step 3).

Now, after step 6, the conditions for C2 are met.

But we need to end with holding brown_block_1. So after step 4, brown_block_1 is on white_block_2. To pick it up again, we need to unstack it.

7. unstack brown_block_1 white_block_2 → holding brown_block_1. Now, we are done. The final state is holding brown_block_1.

But now we need to check all the constraints.

Let's go through each constraint:

C1: brown_block_1 not on table in at least one state. This is true in steps 3 (after pickup) and step 4-7 (stacked and then unstacked).

C2: when brown_block_1 is not on table (steps 3,4,7), in those states or after, white_block_1 must have something on top and red_block_1 not on table. In step 6, white_block_1 has red_block_1 on top, and red_block_1 is not on table. So after step 6, whenever brown_block_1 was not on table (like in step 3, 4, 7), the conditions are satisfied in later steps. So C2 is met.

C3: grey_block_1 clear and holding black_block_1. In the initial plan outlined, we haven't touched the tower on yellow_block_1 (grey_block_1, black_block_1, white_block_2). So grey_block_1 is still under black_block_1. So we need to do actions to satisfy C3. So this constraint isn't met yet. Therefore, we need to adjust the plan to include steps that unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_1, which would make grey_block_1 clear and hold black_block_1.

So let's insert steps to handle C3. Let's say after step 4 (stack brown_block_1 on white_block_2), we work on the yellow_block_1 tower.

So:

5. unstack white_block_2 from black_block_1 → holding white_block_2.

6. putdown white_block_2.

7. unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_1 → holding black_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear. Now, this satisfies C3 (grey_block_1 clear and holding black_block_1).

Then, we can proceed to putdown black_block_1 or stack it somewhere.

But we also have other constraints to satisfy.

C4: at least once, holding white_block_2 and red_block_1 not clear. In the current plan, step 5 is unstack white_block_2, which is holding it. Then step 6 is putdown. So if we instead, after unstacking white_block_2 (step 5), we stack it onto red_block_1, then red_block_1 would not be clear. So:

5. unstack white_block_2 black_block_1 → holding white_block_2.

6. stack white_block_2 red_block_1 → red_block_1 now has white_block_2 on top (not clear). Now, in this state, we are holding white_block_2 (no, after stacking, the arm is empty). Wait, no. After stacking, the arm is empty. So step 6 is stack, then arm is empty. So to satisfy C4 (holding white_block_2 and red_block_1 not clear), step 5 is holding white_block_2, and after step 6, red_block_1 is not clear. So the state after step 5 (holding white_block_2) and before step 6 (stacking) is when we are holding white_block_2, but red_block_1 is still clear (since we haven't stacked yet). After step 6, red_block_1 is not clear. So to satisfy C4, we need to be holding white_block_2 while red_block_1 is not clear. But that's not possible unless we pick up white_block_2 again after stacking. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 5 (holding white_block_2), before stacking, we do something else. But red_block_1 is clear at that point. To have red_block_1 not clear while holding white_block_2, we could stack white_block_2 onto red_block_1, but that would make red_block_1 not clear, but after stacking, the arm is empty. So the state during step 5 (holding white_block_2) is before red_block_1 is not clear. So C4 is not satisfied yet. Therefore, we need another way.

Alternatively, after step 5 (unstack white_block_2), hold it, then pickup red_block_1 (but red_block_1 is clear). Wait, but we can't pick up red_block_1 while holding white_block_2. So steps would be:

5. unstack white_block_2 → holding white_block_2.

6. putdown white_block_2.

7. pickup red_block_1.

8. stack red_block_1 somewhere, e.g., onto white_block_1.

But then, to get C4, we need to be holding white_block_2 while red_block_1 is not clear. So maybe:

5. unstack white_block_2 → hold.

6. stack white_block_2 onto red_block_1 → now red_block_1 has white_block_2, so not clear. Arm is empty. So in this case, during step 5, we are holding white_block_2, but red_block_1 is clear. After step 6, red_block_1 is not clear, but arm is empty. So no state where we are holding white_block_2 and red_block_1 is not clear. Therefore, C4 is not satisfied.

So perhaps another approach: after step 5 (holding white_block_2), we need to stack something on red_block_1 while holding white_block_2. But we can't do that unless we have another block to stack. Alternatively, maybe use another block to stack onto red_block_1 while holding white_block_2.

But this seems complicated. Maybe we need to include another sub-plan to satisfy C4.

Alternatively, after step 7 (unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_1), we're holding black_block_1. Then, perhaps stack black_block_1 onto red_block_1. Now, red_block_1 has black_block_1 on top (not clear). Then, pickup white_block_2 and hold it. So steps:

7. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1 → holding black_block_1, grey_block_1 clear.

8. stack black_block_1 red_block_1 → red_block_1 not clear.

9. pickup white_block_2 → holding white_block_2.

Now, in step 9, holding white_block_2 and red_block_1 is not clear (due to step 8). This satisfies C4.

So inserting these steps into the plan.

But this is getting quite involved. Let's try to compile all necessary steps.

Let's outline a comprehensive plan that addresses all constraints:

1. unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1 → hold white_block_1, brown_block_1 clear (C5 met).

2. stack white_block_1 red_block_1 → red_block_1 not clear, white_block_1 on red_block_1. Now, white_block_1 is not clear, red_block_1 is on table but has white_block_1 on top.

3. pickup brown_block_1 → hold (C1 met here, brown_block_1 not on table). Now, need to satisfy C2: in this state or later, white_block_1 has something on top (already true, since white_block_1 is under red_block_1?), wait no: white_block_1 is on red_block_1. So white_block_1 is clear? No, white_block_1 has red_block_1 on top? Wait, no: in step 2, we stacked white_block_1 onto red_block_1. So red_block_1 is on the table, white_block_1 is on top of red_block_1, and white_block_1 is clear (since nothing is on top of it). So red_block_1 is not clear (has white_block_1), but white_block_1 is clear. So after step 3 (holding brown_block_1), we need to ensure that white_block_1 is not clear. So perhaps we need to put something on white_block_1.

But in this approach, after step 2, white_block_1 is on red_block_1 and is clear. So in step 3, when we pick up brown_block_1, we need to have white_block_1 not clear. So we need to stack something on white_block_1.

But we're holding brown_block_1. So perhaps stack brown_block_1 onto white_block_1.

4. stack brown_block_1 white_block_1 → now, brown_block_1 is on white_block_1, which is on red_block_1. white_block_1 is not clear (has brown_block_1). This satisfies the white_block_1 part of C2. Now, red_block_1 is on the table but has white_block_1 on top. So red_block_1 is still on the table. So to satisfy C2's red_block_1 not on table, we need to move red_block_1.

But red_block_1 is under white_block_1 and brown_block_1. To move red_block_1, we need to unstack the blocks above. Which would require unstacking brown_block_1 and white_block_1 first.

This is getting too tangled. Let's try a different approach.

Alternative plan outline:

1. unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1 → hold white_block_1.

2. stack white_block_1 onto grey_block_1 → grey_block_1 is clear (since in initial state, grey_block_1 has black_block_1 on top). Wait, no. To stack white_block_1 onto grey_block_1, grey_block_1 must be clear. But grey_block_1 has black_block_1 on top. So we need to unstack black_block_1 first.

So:

1. unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1 → hold white_block_1.

2. unstack white_block_2 black_block_1 → hold white_block_2.

3. putdown white_block_2.

4. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold black_block_1.

5. stack black_block_1 red_block_1 → red_block_1 not on table? No, red_block_1 is on table with black_block_1 on top. So red_block_1 is still on table. So this doesn't help.

Wait, maybe stack black_block_1 onto another block not on the table. But all blocks are on the table except those in towers.

Alternatively, stack black_block_1 onto white_block_1 (which is being held). No, white_block_1 is being held. Can't stack onto a held block.

Alternatively, putdown black_block_1.

6. putdown black_block_1 → on table, clear.

7. stack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → now grey_block_1 has white_block_1 on top. Now, grey_block_1 is not clear, and white_block_1 is clear.

But how does this help? Maybe not.

This approach is not leading anywhere. Let's try to prioritize satisfying the constraints in the order they are needed.

Another angle: let's list all the constraints that require certain blocks to be held or stacked, and see if we can find a sequence that covers them.

C3: grey_block_1 clear and holding black_block_1. To do this, need to unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_1. But black_block_1 is under white_block_2. So steps:

unstack white_block_2 black_block_1 → hold white_block_2.

putdown white_block_2.

unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold black_block_1. Now, grey_block_1 is clear. This satisfies C3.

C4: holding white_block_2 and red_block_1 not clear. So after unstacking white_block_2, hold it and stack something on red_block_1. For example:

unstack white_block_2 → hold.

stack white_block_2 red_block_1 → red_block_1 not clear. Arm is empty. So this doesn't satisfy C4, which requires holding white_block_2 while red_block_1 is not clear. So perhaps:

unstack white_block_2 → hold.

stack white_block_2 onto another block, say grey_block_1. Then, while holding white_block_2, we can't make red_block_1 not clear. So this approach won't work. Alternative: after stacking white_block_2 onto red_block_1 (making red_block_1 not clear), then pick up white_block_2 again. But that requires unstacking, which would make red_block_1 clear again.

This seems challenging. Maybe we need to have a state where white_block_2 is held and red_block_1 is not clear in a different way.

For example:

1. unstack white_block_2 black_block_1 → hold white_block_2.

2. stack white_block_2 onto red_block_1 → red_block_1 not clear. Arm empty.

3. unstack white_block_2 red_block_1 → hold white_block_2 again. Now, red_block_1 is clear. So this doesn't help.

Alternatively, after step 2, have another block stacked on red_block_1. But this requires additional steps.

C11: At least once, white_block_2 not clear and holding red_block_1. So need to have white_block_2 under another block and hold red_block_1. For example, stack some block on white_block_2 and hold red_block_1.

C12: white_block_2 not clear and black_block_1 clear. So need a block on white_block_2 and black_block_1 clear. To have black_block_1 clear, need to remove whatever is on top. But black_block_1 initially has white_block_2 on top.

C13: black_block_1 not clear. Initially, black_block_1 has white_block_2 on top, so this is already true. But if we move white_block_2, then black_block_1 becomes clear. So we need to ensure that at some point, black_block_1 is not clear again. Maybe by stacking something else on it.

C14: If black_block_1 is not clear (which it is initially), then yellow_block_1 must be on red_block_1 at that state or later. So we need to have yellow_block_1 on red_block_1 at some point.

C15: yellow_block_1 not clear. Initially, it's under grey_block_1, so already not clear. So this constraint is satisfied in the initial state.

C16: If yellow_block_1 not clear (which it is), then black_block_1 must be clear at that state or later. Initially, black_block_1 is not clear (has white_block_2). So this would require that after some point, black_block_1 becomes clear. Which happens if we unstack white_block_2 from black_block_1.

But this is getting too complicated. I think the key is to find a plan that satisfies all constraints, possibly by including the necessary steps to achieve each constraint.

Let's try to build a plan step by step, ensuring each constraint is met.

1. unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1 → hold white_block_1. Now, brown_block_1 is clear (C5 met).

This action is needed to access brown_block_1.

2. stack white_block_1 red_block_1 → red_block_1 has white_block_1 on top (not clear), and white_block_1 is clear. This addresses part of C2 (white_block_1 has something on top), but red_block_1 is still on the table. So need to move red_block_1.

But to move red_block_1, we need to unstack white_block_1 first. So:

3. unstack white_block_1 red_block_1 → hold white_block_1.

4. pickup red_block_1 → hold red_block_1. Now, red_block_1 is not on table.

Now, after step 4, red_block_1 is not on table. So if we go back to step 3 (when we picked up brown_block_1), which is not yet in the plan, we need to check C2.

Wait, this approach is not leading to the goal. Let's rethink.

Alternative approach focusing on C3 and C4 first.

To satisfy C3: grey_block_1 clear and holding black_block_1.

Steps:

1. unstack white_block_2 black_block_1 → hold white_block_2.

2. putdown white_block_2.

3. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold black_block_1. Now, grey_block_1 is clear. This satisfies C3.

4. putdown black_block_1.

Now, to satisfy C4: holding white_block_2 and red_block_1 not clear.

5. pickup white_block_2.

6. stack white_block_2 red_block_1 → red_block_1 not clear. Arm empty. So to be holding white_block_2 and red_block_1 not clear, we need to do this before stacking. But step 5 is holding white_block_2, and step 6 makes red_block_1 not clear. So during step 5, red_block_1 is clear. After step 6, red_block_1 is not clear but arm is empty. So C4 is not satisfied. Therefore, need another approach.

Perhaps after step 5, while holding white_block_2, stack something else on red_block_1.

But we can't stack anything else unless we have another block. Let's use white_block_1.

7. unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1 → hold white_block_1.

8. stack white_block_1 red_block_1 → red_block_1 not clear. Now, in step 7, we are holding white_block_1, and after step 8, red_block_1 is not clear. But C4 requires holding white_block_2 and red_block_1 not clear. So this doesn't help.

Alternatively, after step 5 (holding white_block_2), stack white_block_2 onto red_block_1. Now, red_block_1 is not clear. But after stacking, arm is empty. So no state where we are holding white_block_2 and red_block_1 is not clear. Therefore, C4 is not met.

This is frustrating. Maybe we need to hold white_block_2 and have another block on red_block_1.

For example:

After step 5 (holding white_block_2), unstack white_block_1 from brown_block_1 (step 6), then stack white_block_1 onto red_block_1 (step 7). Now, red_block_1 has white_block_1 on top. So during step 5-7, while holding white_block_2, red_block_1 is clear until step 7. So this doesn't work.

Alternatively, have a different order:

1. unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1 → hold white_block_1.

2. stack white_block_1 onto red_block_1 → red_block_1 not clear.

3. unstack white_block_2 black_block_1 → hold white_block_2.

Now, in step 3, we are holding white_block_2, and red_block_1 is not clear (due to step 2). This satisfies C4.

So steps 1-3:

1. unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1.

2. stack white_block_1 red_block_1.

3. unstack white_block_2 black_block_1.

At this point, holding white_block_2, red_block_1 has white_block_1 on top (not clear). So C4 is met.

Now, proceed to satisfy C3:

4. putdown white_block_2.

5. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold black_block_1, grey_block_1 clear. C3 met.

Now, putdown black_block_1.

6. putdown black_block_1.

Now, to satisfy C2: when brown_block_1 is not on table (which hasn't happened yet), we need white_block_1 not clear (which it is, since it's on red_block_1) and red_block_1 not on table. But red_block_1 is on the table with white_block_1 on top. So red_block_1 is still on the table. Therefore, C2 is not met.

So we need to move red_block_1 off the table. To do that, stack it onto another block.

7. pickup red_block_1 → but red_block_1 has white_block_1 on top. Cannot pick up.

Ah, problem. So white_block_1 is on red_block_1, so red_block_1 is not clear. Can't pick it up. So need to unstack white_block_1 first.

8. unstack white_block_1 red_block_1 → hold white_block_1.

9. pickup red_block_1 → now, red_block_1 is held, not on table.

10. stack red_block_1 somewhere, e.g., onto grey_block_1.

But grey_block_1 is clear after step 5. So step 10: stack red_block_1 grey_block_1 → grey_block_1 has red_block_1 on top.

Now, red_block_1 is not on table. This helps with C2.

But when is brown_block_1 not on table? We haven't picked it up yet. So we need to do that.

11. pickup brown_block_1 → now, brown_block_1 is not on table (C1 met). Then, we need to satisfy C2: in this state or later, white_block_1 not clear and red_block_1 not on table. 

At step 11, white_block_1 is being held (step 8), so white_block_1 is not on any block. Wait, step 8: unstack white_block_1 from red_block_1, so white_block_1 is held. Then step 9: pickup red_block_1, so white_block_1 must have been put down or stacked. Wait, no. Step 8: unstack white_block_1 red_block_1 → hold white_block_1. Then step 9: to pickup red_block_1, we need to putdown white_block_1 first.

So corrected steps:

8. unstack white_block_1 red_block_1 → hold white_block_1.

9. putdown white_block_1 → on table, clear.

10. pickup red_block_1 → hold red_block_1.

11. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1 → red_block_1 not on table.

12. pickup brown_block_1 → now, brown_block_1 is not on table (C1). Now, in this state, white_block_1 is clear (step 9), which violates C2's requirement. So we need to ensure that white_block_1 has something on top. 

So after step 9, white_block_1 is on table and clear. Need to stack something on it.

13. pickup white_block_1 → hold.

14. stack white_block_1 onto black_block_1 (which is on table after step 6). But black_block_1 is clear. So stack white_block_1 black_block_1 → now, white_block_1 not clear, and black_block_1 not clear. 

Now, in step 14, white_block_1 is not clear. Then, in step 12, when brown_block_1 is picked up (step 12), we have white_block_1 not clear (due to step 14) and red_block_1 not on table (due to step 11). So C2 is satisfied.

Now, the final step is to hold brown_block_1 (step 12), but we have more steps after that. So the plan would end at step 12? No, because after step 12, we need to make sure all constraints are met.

But let's check the remaining constraints.

C5: brown_block_1 is clear at least once. In step 1, after unstacking white_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear. So met.

C6: when brown_block_1 is clear (step 1), then yellow_block_1 must be on grey_block_1. Initially, yellow_block_1 is under grey_block_1. So yellow_block_1 is on table, grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_1. To have yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1, we need to stack yellow_block_1 onto grey_block_1. But yellow_block_1 is on the table. So steps needed:

After step 5 (unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1), grey_block_1 is clear. 

Then, perhaps:

15. unstack grey_block_1 yellow_block_1 → hold grey_block_1.

16. stack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1 → yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1. Now, yellow_block_1 is on grey_block_1. This satisfies C6 when brown_block_1 was clear in step 1.

But this adds more steps. 

This is getting extremely lengthy. It seems that satisfying all constraints requires a long sequence of actions, but the problem asks for an optimal (shortest possible) plan. Given the time constraints, I'll try to draft a plan that meets all the necessary points, even if it's not the absolute shortest, but ensuring all constraints are satisfied.
