Let's analyze the current state of the world and the goal.

Initial state:
- brown_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- red_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
- white_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is clear
- white_block_2 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Goal:
- You are holding brown_block_1

To hold brown_block_1, I need to perform a "pickup" action on it. But the preconditions for the "pickup" action are:
1. The block is clear
2. The block is on the table
3. You are not holding any block

brown_block_1 is on the table and I'm not holding any block, but brown_block_1 is not clear because white_block_1 is on top of it. So I first need to remove white_block_1 from brown_block_1.

To do this, I need to perform an "unstack" action on white_block_1 from brown_block_1. The preconditions for the "unstack" action are:
1. The first block is on top of the second block
2. The first block is clear
3. You are not holding any block

white_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1, white_block_1 is clear, and I'm not holding any block. So I can perform this action.

After I unstack white_block_1 from brown_block_1, I'll be holding white_block_1. I need to place white_block_1 somewhere else to free my hand. I can either "putdown" white_block_1 on the table or "stack" it on another block.

Let's use "putdown" for simplicity. This will place white_block_1 on the table and free my hand.

Now, with brown_block_1 clear and on the table, and not holding any block, I can "pickup" brown_block_1 to achieve the goal.

So the plan is:
1. unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1
2. putdown white_block_1
3. pickup brown_block_1

Let's check if this plan achieves the goal:

After step 1, I am holding white_block_1 and brown_block_1 is clear.
After step 2, white_block_1 is on the table and I'm not holding any block.
After step 3, I am holding brown_block_1, which is the goal.

The plan seems valid and achieves the goal. Let's check if there are any constraints or other considerations I'm missing.

Looking back at the problem, there are no additional constraints mentioned. The plan I've proposed should be valid and optimal, achieving the goal in 3 steps.

unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1
putdown white_block_1
pickup brown_block_1
