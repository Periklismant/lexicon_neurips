1. unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1 # white_block_1 in hand, brown_block_1 clear. Satisfying constraint 5 and constraint 9.
2. putdown white_block_1 # white_block_1 on the table.
3. pickup brown_block_1 # brown_block_1 is not on the table. Satisfying constraint 1.
   - From constraint 2, if "brown_block_1 is not on the table" holds, then at that point or later, white_block_1 should not be clear and red_block_1 should not be on the table.
4. putdown brown_block_1 # brown_block_1 on the table.
5. pickup red_block_1 # red_block_1 is not on the table.
6. stack red_block_1 white_block_1 # white_block_1 is not clear, red_block_1 is not on the table. Satisfying constraint 2.
7. unstack white_block_2 black_block_1 # white_block_2 in hand. Satisfying constraint 10.
   - From constraint 4, we need a state where both "you are holding white_block_2" and "red_block_1 is not clear" are true.
   - Currently, red_block_1 is on white_block_1, so it's clear.
8. stack white_block_2 red_block_1 # white_block_2 on red_block_1, red_block_1 is not clear.
9. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1 # black_block_1 in hand, grey_block_1 clear. Satisfying constraint 3.
10. unstack white_block_2 red_block_1 # white_block_2 in hand, red_block_1 is clear.
11. stack white_block_2 black_block_1 # white_block_2 on black_block_1, white_block_2 is clear, black_block_1 is not clear.
12. unstack red_block_1 white_block_1 # red_block_1 in hand, white_block_1 is clear.
13. putdown red_block_1 # red_block_1 on the table.
14. putdown white_block_1 # white_block_1 on the table. Satisfying constraint 7 and constraint 8.
   - From constraint 11, we need a state where both "white_block_2 is not clear" and "you are holding red_block_1" are true.
15. pickup grey_block_1 # grey_block_1 in hand.
16. stack grey_block_1 white_block_2 # white_block_2 is not clear.
17. pickup red_block_1 # red_block_1 in hand. Satisfying constraint 11.
18. putdown red_block_1 # red_block_1 on the table.
   - From constraint 12, we need a state where both "white_block_2 is not clear" and "black_block_1 is clear" are true.
19. unstack grey_block_1 white_block_2 # grey_block_1 in hand, white_block_2 is clear.
20. unstack white_block_2 black_block_1 # white_block_2 in hand, black_block_1 is clear. Satisfying constraint 12.
   - From constraint 13, "black_block_1 is not clear" must hold in at least one state.
21. putdown white_block_2 # white_block_2 on the table.
22. pickup grey_block_1 # grey_block_1 in hand.
23. stack grey_block_1 black_block_1 # black_block_1 is not clear. Satisfying constraint 13.
   - From constraint 14, if "black_block_1 is not clear" holds, then at that point or later, yellow_block_1 should be on top of red_block_1.
24. pickup yellow_block_1 # yellow_block_1 in hand.
25. stack yellow_block_1 red_block_1 # yellow_block_1 on red_block_1. Satisfying constraint 14.
   - From constraint 16, if "yellow_block_1 is not clear" holds, then at that point or later, black_block_1 should be clear.
26. unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1 # grey_block_1 in hand, black_block_1 is clear. Satisfying constraint 16.
   - From constraint 6, if "brown_block_1 is clear" holds, then at that point or later, yellow_block_1 should be on top of grey_block_1.
27. unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_1 # yellow_block_1 in hand, red_block_1 is clear.
28. stack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1 # yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1. Satisfying constraint 6.
   - Finally, we want to achieve the goal: "you are holding brown_block_1".
29. pickup brown_block_1 # brown_block_1 in hand. Satisfying the goal.
