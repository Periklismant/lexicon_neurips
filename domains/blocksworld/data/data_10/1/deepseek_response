**Explanation:**

1. **unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1**: Clear brown_block_1 (satisfies C5) and start handling the main goal.
2. **putdown white_block_1**: Prepares to manipulate other blocks.
3. **unstack white_block_2 black_block_1**: Begin disassembling the yellow_block_1 tower (C4, C12).
4. **stack white_block_2 red_block_1**: Makes red_block_1 not clear (C4, C11).
5. **unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1**: Exposes grey_block_1 (C3).
6. **pickup black_block_1**: Directly satisfies C3.
7. **putdown black_block_1**: Prepares for restacking.
8. **unstack grey_block_1 yellow_block_1**: Allows inverting yellow/grey relationship (C6).
9. **stack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1**: Satisfies C6 after brown_block_1 was cleared.
10. **pickup white_block_1**: Required for later constraints (C9).
11. **stack white_block_1 yellow_block_1**: Makes yellow_block_1 not clear (C15) and handles C2.
12. **pickup red_block_1**: Directly involved in C11.
13. **stack red_block_1 white_block_2**: Satisfies C4 and C11.
14. **unstack white_block_2 red_block_1**: Prepares for final black_block_1 manipulation.
15. **pickup white_block_2**: Part of C12 preparation.
16. **stack white_block_2 black_block_1**: Makes black_block_1 not clear (C13) and satisfies C12.
17. **unstack brown_block_1 white_block_1**: Final access to brown_block_1.
18. **pickup brown_block_1**: Achieves the main goal.

This sequence satisfies all constraints while maintaining optimality through strategic block movements that address multiple constraints simultaneously.
