Let me analyze this Blocksworld planning problem.

We have the following initial state:
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- black_block_1 is on the table
- orange_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2
- green_block_1 is clear
- black_block_1 is clear
- brown_block_1 is clear
- You are not holding any block

The goal is to be holding green_block_1.

Let's visualize the initial state:

```
   green_block_1   black_block_1   brown_block_1
      |                              |
orange_block_1                   orange_block_2
                                    |
                                 red_block_1
                                    |
                                 blue_block_1
      |                              |
-------------------------------------------
                  table
```

Now let's figure out how to get to a state where we're holding green_block_1. To pick up green_block_1, we need it to be clear (which it is in the initial state) and we need to not be holding any block (which is also true in the initial state). However, green_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1, not on the table. So we can't use the "pickup" action; we need to use "unstack".

Actually, no, to use "unstack" on green_block_1 from orange_block_1, we need:
1. green_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 (true in the initial state)
2. green_block_1 is clear (true in the initial state)
3. We're not holding any block (true in the initial state)

So we can directly unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_1 to achieve our goal.

Let's check the action:
- Action: "unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1"
- Preconditions: 
  - green_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 (true)
  - green_block_1 is clear (true)
  - You are not holding any block (true)
- Effects:
  - green_block_1 is no longer on top of orange_block_1
  - orange_block_1 is clear
  - You are holding green_block_1

This satisfies our goal of "you are holding green_block_1".

So the plan is simply:
```
unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
```

Actually, let's double-check the action format. The actions are:
- "pickup x": Pick up block x from the table.
- "putdown x": Place block x on the table.
- "stack x y": Place block x on top of block y.
- "unstack x y": Pick up block x from the top of block y.

So the action should be:
```
unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
```

And this is indeed the optimal plan since it requires just one action to achieve the goal.
