Let me start by understanding the initial state of the world:

Initial State:
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- black_block_1 is on the table
- orange_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2
- green_block_1 is clear
- black_block_1 is clear
- brown_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Goal: you are holding green_block_1

Visually, the initial state looks like:
```
       green_block_1    brown_block_1    black_block_1
           |                |
     orange_block_1   orange_block_2
                          |
                      red_block_1
                          |
                     blue_block_1
           
           Table
```

Now, let's analyze the constraints:

1. "blue_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1" must be true at some point. This is already true in the initial state because blue_block_1 is on the table, not on top of orange_block_1.

2. If "blue_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1", then "black_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2" must be true in the current or a future state. Currently, "blue_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1", but "black_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2". So at some point we need to place black_block_1 on top of orange_block_2.

3. "orange_block_1 is clear" must be true at some point. Currently, green_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1, so we need to remove green_block_1 from orange_block_1.

4. If "orange_block_1 is clear", then "black_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1" or "you are holding black_block_1" must have been true in an earlier state. This means that before we make orange_block_1 clear, we need to either place black_block_1 on orange_block_1 or hold black_block_1.

5. "orange_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1" must be true at some point. This is already true in the initial state because orange_block_2 is on top of red_block_1, not green_block_1.

6. If "orange_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1", then "you are holding black_block_1" or "brown_block_1 is on the table" must be true in the current or a future state. Currently, "brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2", not on the table. So we need to either hold black_block_1 or place brown_block_1 on the table at some point.

7. "blue_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1" must be true at some point. This is already true in the initial state, because red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1, not the other way around.

8. If "blue_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1", then "blue_block_1 is clear" or "red_block_1 is clear" must be true in the current or a future state. Currently, neither blue_block_1 nor red_block_1 is clear (they have blocks on top of them). So we need to make one of them clear at some point.

9. "red_block_1 is clear" must be true at some point. Currently, orange_block_2 is on top of red_block_1 and brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2. So we need to remove both to make red_block_1 clear.

10. "brown_block_1 is on the table" and "you are holding orange_block_2" must be true simultaneously at some point. Currently, brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2, which is on top of red_block_1. So we need to move brown_block_1 to the table and then pick up orange_block_2.

11. "blue_block_1 is not clear" must be true at some point. This is already true in the initial state, because red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1.

12. If "blue_block_1 is not clear", then "orange_block_2 is clear" must be true in the current or a future state. Currently, "brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2", so orange_block_2 is not clear. We need to make orange_block_2 clear at some point.

13. "black_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2" must be true at some point. This is already true in the initial state, because black_block_1 is on the table, not on top of orange_block_2.

14. If "black_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2", then "brown_block_1 is not clear" or "green_block_1 is on the table" must be true in the current or a future state. Currently, "brown_block_1 is clear" and "green_block_1 is not on the table". So we need to either place some block on top of brown_block_1 or move green_block_1 to the table.

15. "orange_block_2 is not on the table" must be true at some point. This is already true in the initial state, because orange_block_2 is on top of red_block_1, not on the table.

16. If "orange_block_2 is not on the table", then "you are holding orange_block_2" or "blue_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1" must be true in the current or a future state. Currently, neither of these is true. So we need to either pick up orange_block_2 or place blue_block_1 on top of brown_block_1 at some point.

17. "brown_block_1 is on top of red_block_1" and "green_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1" must be true simultaneously at some point. Currently, "brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2" and "green_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1". So we need to rearrange the blocks to achieve this configuration.

Let's now start thinking about a plan. The goal is to be holding green_block_1.

First, let's focus on the constraints that involve mandatory states we need to reach:

- We need to have brown_block_1 on the table and be holding orange_block_2 at some point (Constraint 10).
- We need to have brown_block_1 on top of red_block_1 and green_block_1 on top of brown_block_1 at some point (Constraint 17).
- We need to make red_block_1 clear at some point (Constraint 9).
- We need to make orange_block_1 clear at some point (Constraint 3).
- Before making orange_block_1, we need to either place black_block_1 on top of orange_block_1 or hold black_block_1 (Constraint 4).
- At some point, we need to place black_block_1 on top of orange_block_2 (Constraint 2).
- We need to make orange_block_2 clear at some point (Constraint 12).

Let's start building a valid plan by following these constraints:

1. First, we need to handle the clear orange_block_1 constraint (Constraint 3). Before making orange_block_1 clear, we need to either place black_block_1 on top of orange_block_1 or hold black_block_1 (Constraint 4).

So, we'll first pick up black_block_1, then place it on orange_block_1:
   - unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1 (making orange_block_1 clear, but satisfying constraint 4 by having black_block_1 on top of orange_block_1 in the previous state)
   - pickup black_block_1
   - stack black_block_1 orange_block_1

Now black_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1. But we need to make orange_block_1 clear at some point (Constraint 3). So, later in our plan, we'll need to remove black_block_1 from orange_block_1.

2. Next, we need to make red_block_1 clear (Constraint 9). This means we need to remove brown_block_1 and orange_block_2 from the stack. Let's do that:
   - unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
   - putdown brown_block_1 (placing brown_block_1 on the table, satisfying part of Constraint 10)
   - unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1
   (Now red_block_1 is clear, satisfying Constraint 9)

Wait, I need to be more careful here. Let's make sure each action's preconditions are met.

Let me start over and build the plan step by step, checking the preconditions of each action:

Initial state:
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- black_block_1 is on the table
- orange_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2

Let's start by placing black_block_1 on top of orange_block_1 (to later satisfy Constraint 4):

```
pickup black_block_1
```
Preconditions: black_block_1 is clear, black_block_1 is on the table, you are not holding any block. All are satisfied.
Effect: you are holding black_block_1, black_block_1 is not on the table.

```
stack black_block_1 orange_block_1
```
Wait, I can't do this because green_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1, so orange_block_1 is not clear.

Let me reanalyze the constraints in the correct order.

First, I notice that the final goal is to be holding green_block_1. To achieve this, I need to unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_1. Let's keep this in mind.

Constraint 3 says we need to make orange_block_1 clear at some point. For this, we need to remove green_block_1 from orange_block_1.

Constraint 4 says that before making orange_block_1 clear, we need to have had black_block_1 on top of orange_block_1 or be holding black_block_1. So, before we unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_1, we need to satisfy this constraint.

So, let's start by unstacking green_block_1 from orange_block_1:

```
unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
```
Preconditions: green_block_1 is clear, green_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1, you are not holding any block. All are satisfied.
Effect: you are holding green_block_1, green_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear.

But, according to Constraint 4, before we make orange_block_1 clear, we need to have had black_block_1 on top of orange_block_1 or be holding black_block_1. So, we can't do this action directly.

Let's try a different approach. Instead of starting with unstacking green_block_1, let's try to satisfy the constraints one by one.

1. Constraint 17 says we need to have brown_block_1 on top of red_block_1 and green_block_1 on top of brown_block_1 at some point. Let's work towards this.

2. Constraint 9 says we need to make red_block_1 clear at some point. Currently, orange_block_2 and brown_block_1 are on top of red_block_1, so we need to remove them.

3. Constraint 10 says we need to have brown_block_1 on the table and be holding orange_block_2 at some point. So, we need to unstack brown_block_1 and put it on the table, then pick up orange_block_2.

Let's start with this:

```
unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
```
Preconditions: brown_block_1 is clear, brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2, you are not holding any block. All are satisfied.
Effect: you are holding brown_block_1, brown_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2, orange_block_2 is clear.

```
putdown brown_block_1
```
Preconditions: you are holding brown_block_1. Satisfied.
Effect: you are not holding any block, brown_block_1 is on the table, brown_block_1 is clear.

```
unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1
```
Preconditions: orange_block_2 is clear, orange_block_2 is on top of red_block_1, you are not holding any block. All are satisfied.
Effect: you are holding orange_block_2, orange_block_2 is not on top of red_block_1, red_block_1 is clear.

At this point, we've satisfied Constraint 9 (red_block_1 is clear) and part of Constraint 10 (brown_block_1 is on the table). We're also holding orange_block_2, which satisfies the rest of Constraint 10. And Constraint 16 is satisfied because we're holding orange_block_2.

Now, let's continue with the plan. Constraint 17 says we need to have brown_block_1 on top of red_block_1 and green_block_1 on top of brown_block_1 at some point. So, let's place orange_block_2 somewhere, then move brown_block_1 onto red_block_1, and then move green_block_1 onto brown_block_1.

```
putdown orange_block_2
```
Preconditions: you are holding orange_block_2. Satisfied.
Effect: you are not holding any block, orange_block_2 is on the table, orange_block_2 is clear.

```
pickup brown_block_1
```
Preconditions: brown_block_1 is clear, brown_block_1 is on the table, you are not holding any block. All are satisfied.
Effect: you are holding brown_block_1, brown_block_1 is not on the table.

```
stack brown_block_1 red_block_1
```
Preconditions: you are holding brown_block_1, red_block_1 is clear. Both are satisfied.
Effect: you are not holding any block, brown_block_1 is on top of red_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear, red_block_1 is not clear.

Next, we need to place green_block_1 on top of brown_block_1. But first, we need to pick it up from orange_block_1. Before we do that, let's check Constraint 4. It says that before making orange_block_1 clear, we need to have had black_block_1 on top of orange_block_1 or be holding black_block_1. So, before we unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_1, we need to satisfy this constraint.

Let's go back to Constraint 2, which says that at some point, we need to place black_block_1 on top of orange_block_2. Let's do that first:

```
pickup black_block_1
```
Preconditions: black_block_1 is clear, black_block_1 is on the table, you are not holding any block. All are satisfied.
Effect: you are holding black_block_1, black_block_1 is not on the table.

```
stack black_block_1 orange_block_2
```
Preconditions: you are holding black_block_1, orange_block_2 is clear. Both are satisfied.
Effect: you are not holding any block, black_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2, black_block_1 is clear, orange_block_2 is not clear.

Now, Constraint 2 is satisfied. Let's also check Constraint 6, which says if "orange_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1" (which is the case), then "you are holding black_block_1" or "brown_block_1 is on the table" must be true in the current or a future state. Since brown_block_1 is now on top of red_block_1, not on the table, we need to pick up black_block_1 at some point. But we've just placed black_block_1 on top of orange_block_2, so black_block_1 is not on the table. Maybe we'll have to check Constraint 6 again later.

Let's now unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_1. Before that, we need to satisfy Constraint 4, which says that before making orange_block_1 clear, we need to have had black_block_1 on top of orange_block_1 or be holding black_block_1. Let's pick up black_block_1 again:

```
unstack black_block_1 orange_block_2
```
Preconditions: black_block_1 is clear, black_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2, you are not holding any block. All are satisfied.
Effect: you are holding black_block_1, black_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2, orange_block_2 is clear.

Now, according to Constraint 4, we can unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_1 because we are holding black_block_1:

```
stack black_block_1 orange_block_1
```
Preconditions: you are holding black_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear. But orange_block_1 is not clear because green_block_1 is on top of it. So, we can't do this action.

I made a mistake. We need to place black_block_1 on top of orange_block_1, then remove it to make orange_block_1 clear, and then pick up green_block_1. Let's try again.

```
putdown black_block_1
```
Preconditions: you are holding black_block_1. Satisfied.
Effect: you are not holding any block, black_block_1 is on the table, black_block_1 is clear.

```
unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
```
Preconditions: green_block_1 is clear, green_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1, you are not holding any block. All are satisfied.
Effect: you are holding green_block_1, green_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear.

But according to Constraint 4, we need to have had black_block_1 on top of orange_block_1 or be holding black_block_1 before making orange_block_1 clear. So, we can't do this action yet.

The problem seems complex. Let's try a slightly different approach. I'll create a high-level plan first, and then check it against the constraints.

Since the goal is to be holding green_block_1, we need to unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_1. But, according to Constraint 4, before making orange_block_1 clear, we need to have had black_block_1 on top of orange_block_1 or be holding black_block_1. So, we need to pick up black_block_1, then stack it on orange_block_1, then unstack it (making orange_block_1 clear), and then unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_1.

Let's try this plan, action by action, with the current state after each action:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
   - Holding: brown_block_1
   - On table: orange_block_1, green_block_1 on orange_block_1, blue_block_1, red_block_1 on blue_block_1, orange_block_2 on red_block_1, black_block_1
   - Clear: green_block_1, orange_block_2, black_block_1

2. putdown brown_block_1
   - Holding: none
   - On table: orange_block_1, green_block_1 on orange_block_1, blue_block_1, red_block_1 on blue_block_1, orange_block_2 on red_block_1, black_block_1, brown_block_1
   - Clear: green_block_1, orange_block_2, black_block_1, brown_block_1

3. pickup black_block_1
   - Holding: black_block_1
   - On table: orange_block_1, green_block_1 on orange_block_1, blue_block_1, red_block_1 on blue_block_1, orange_block_2 on red_block_1, brown_block_1
   - Clear: green_block_1, orange_block_2, brown_block_1

4. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
   - We can't do this while holding black_block_1.

Let's continue with a different plan:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
   - Holding: brown_block_1
   - On table: orange_block_1, green_block_1 on orange_block_1, blue_block_1, red_block_1 on blue_block_1, orange_block_2 on red_block_1, black_block_1
   - Clear: green_block_1, orange_block_2, black_block_1

2. putdown brown_block_1
   - Holding: none
   - On table: orange_block_1, green_block_1 on orange_block_1, blue_block_1, red_block_1 on blue_block_1, orange_block_2 on red_block_1, black_block_1, brown_block_1
   - Clear: green_block_1, orange_block_2, black_block_1, brown_block_1

3. pickup black_block_1
   - Holding: black_block_1
   - On table: orange_block_1, green_block_1 on orange_block_1, blue_block_1, red_block_1 on blue_block_1, orange_block_2 on red_block_1, brown_block_1
   - Clear: green_block_1, orange_block_2, brown_block_1

4. putdown black_block_1
   - Holding: none
   - On table: orange_block_1, green_block_1 on orange_block_1, blue_block_1, red_block_1 on blue_block_1, orange_block_2 on red_block_1, black_block_1, brown_block_1
   - Clear: green_block_1, orange_block_2, black_block_1, brown_block_1

5. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
   - Holding: green_block_1
   - On table: orange_block_1, blue_block_1, red_block_1 on blue_block_1, orange_block_2 on red_block_1, black_block_1, brown_block_1
   - Clear: orange_block_1, orange_block_2, black_block_1, brown_block_1

This plan doesn't satisfy Constraint 4, which says that before making orange_block_1 clear, we need to have had black_block_1 on top of orange_block_1 or be holding black_block_1.

Let me try a completely different approach. I'll try to satisfy the constraints in the order they appear, and see if I can reach the goal.

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1
4. putdown orange_block_2
5. pickup black_block_1
6. stack black_block_1 orange_block_2
   (This satisfies Constraint 2)
7. unstack black_block_1 orange_block_2
   (We're now holding black_block_1, which satisfies part of Constraint 4)
8. stack black_block_1 orange_block_1
   (We can't do this because green_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1)

Let's try yet another approach. Let's analyze Constraint 17, which says we need to have brown_block_1 on top of red_block_1 and green_block_1 on top of brown_block_1 at some point. This seems like a good sub-goal to aim for.

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1
4. putdown orange_block_2
5. pickup brown_block_1
6. stack brown_block_1 red_block_1
7. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
   (We can't do this directly due to Constraint 4, which says that before making orange_block_1 clear, we need to have had black_block_1 on top of orange_block_1 or be holding black_block_1)

So, we need to satisfy Constraint 4 first. Let's pick up black_block_1 and try to place it on orange_block_1, but we can't because green_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1. So we need to find a way to satisfy Constraint 4 while also making it possible to unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_1.

In this context, I think we should reinterpret Constraint 4. It says that if "orange_block_1 is clear" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which "black_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1" or "you are holding black_block_1" is true. This could mean that either:
1. We first place black_block_1 on top of orange_block_1, then remove it (making orange_block_1 clear).
2. We first pick up black_block_1, then make orange_block_1 clear while we're still holding black_block_1.

Option 1 is not feasible because we can't place black_block_1 on orange_block_1 while green_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1. So, we'll try Option 2.

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1
4. putdown orange_block_2
5. pickup black_block_1
6. stack black_block_1 orange_block_2
   (This satisfies Constraint 2)
7. pickup brown_block_1
8. stack brown_block_1 red_block_1
9. unstack black_block_1 orange_block_2
   (We're now holding black_block_1, which satisfies part of Constraint 4)
10. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
    (We can't do this while holding black_block_1)

We need to fry something else. Let's try:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1
4. putdown orange_block_2
5. pickup black_block_1
   (We're now holding black_block_1)
6. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
   (We can't do this while holding black_block_1)

Maybe we should try to understand Constraint 4 in a different way. It says that if "orange_block_1 is clear" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which "black_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1" or "you are holding black_block_1" is true. It doesn't necessarily mean that black_block_1 needs to be on top of orange_block_1 or be held just before orange_block_1 becomes clear. It could be any earlier state.

Let's try this interpretation:

1. pickup black_block_1
   (We're now holding black_block_1, which can satisfy Constraint 4 for a future state where orange_block_1 is clear)
2. putdown black_block_1
3. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
4. putdown brown_block_1
5. unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1
6. putdown orange_block_2
7. pickup black_block_1
8. stack black_block_1 orange_block_2
   (This satisfies Constraint 2)
9. pickup brown_block_1
10. stack brown_block_1 red_block_1
11. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
    (Now, orange_block_1is clear, which is required by Constraint 3. And this is fine according to Constraint 4 because we were holding black_block_1 in step 1)
12. stack green_block_1 brown_block_1
    (This, combined with brown_block_1 on top of red_block_1, satisfies Constraint 17)

At this point, we've satisfied several constraints:
- Constraint 2 is satisfied in step 8 when we stack black_block_1 on orange_block_2.
- Constraint 3 is satisfied in step 11 when orange_block_1 becomes clear.
- Constraint 4 is satisfied because in step 1, we were holding black_block_1, which is earlier than step 11 when orange_block_1 becomes clear.
- Constraint 9 is satisfied in step 6 when red_block_1 becomes clear.
- Constraint 17 is satisfied in step 12 when green_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1, which is on top of red_block_1.

Let's check the other constraints:

- Constraint 1 is satisfied in the initial state because blue_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1.
- Constraint 5 is satisfied in the initial state because orange_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1.
- Constraint 6 says that if "orange_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1", then "you are holding black_block_1" or "brown_block_1 is on the table" must be true in the current or a future state. Since orange_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1 in the initial state, we need to satisfy this. We've picked up black_block_1 in step 1, so we've satisfied this constraint.
- Constraint 7 is satisfied in the initial state because blue_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1.
- Constraint 8 says that if "blue_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1", then "blue_block_1 is clear" or "red_block_1 is clear" must be true in the current or a future state. Since blue_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1 in the initial state, we need to satisfy this. We've made red_block_1 clear in step 6, so we've satisfied this constraint.
- Constraint 10 says we need to have brown_block_1 on the table and be holding orange_block_2 at some point. We have brown_block_1 on the table in step 4, but we haven't picked up orange_block_2 while brown_block_1 is on the table. We need to add this to our plan.
- Constraint 11 is satisfied in the initial state because blue_block_1 is not clear (red_block_1 is on top of it).
- Constraint 12 says that if "blue_block_1 is not clear", then "orange_block_2 is clear" must be true in the current or a future state. Since blue_block_1 is not clear in the initial state, we need to satisfy this. We've made orange_block_2 clear in step 7 when we picked up black_block_1, so we've satisfied this constraint.
- Constraint 13 is satisfied in the initial state because black_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2.
- Constraint 14 says that if "black_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2", then "brown_block_1 is not clear" or "green_block_1 is on the table" must be true in the current or a future state. Since black_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2 in the initial state, we need to satisfy this. While brown_block_1 is clear in the initial state and green_block_1 is not on the table, once we place green_block_1 on top of brown_block_1 in step 12, brown_block_1 will no longer be clear. So, we'd satisfy this constraint.
- Constraint 15 is satisfied in the initial state because orange_block_2 is not on the table.
- Constraint 16 says that if "orange_block_2 is not on the table", then "you are holding orange_block_2" or "blue_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1" must be true in the current or a future state. Since orange_block_2 is not on the table in the initial state, we need to satisfy this. We haven't picked up orange_block_2 or placed blue_block_1 on top of brown_block_1 yet. We need to add this to our plan.

Let's update our plan to satisfy the remaining constraints and reach the goal:

1. pickup black_block_1
   (We're now holding black_block_1, which can satisfy Constraint 4 for a future state where orange_block_1 is clear)
2. putdown black_block_1
3. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
4. putdown brown_block_1
   (This, combined with step 5 where we pick up orange_block_2, satisfies Constraint 10)
5. unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1
   (We're now holding orange_block_2, which, combined with step 4 where brown_block_1 is on the table, satisfies Constraint 10. Also, this satisfies part of Constraint 16)
6. putdown orange_block_2
7. pickup black_block_1
8. stack black_block_1 orange_block_2
   (This satisfies Constraint 2)
9. pickup brown_block_1
10. stack brown_block_1 red_block_1
11. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
    (Now, orange_block_1 is clear, which is required by Constraint 3. And this is fine according to Constraint 4 because we were holding black_block_1 in step 1)
12. stack green_block_1 brown_block_1
    (This, combined with brown_block_1 on top of red_block_1, satisfies Constraint 17. Also, brown_block_1 is no longer clear, which helps satisfy Constraint 14)

At this point, we've satisfied all constraints except the final goal, which is to be holding green_block_1. Let's continue our plan:

13. unstack green_block_1 brown_block_1
    (We're now holding green_block_1, which is the final goal)

But, we still haven't satisfied Constraint 16 fully. It says that if "orange_block_2 is not on the table", then "you are holding orange_block_2" or "blue_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1" must be true in the current or a future state. In step 5, we picked up orange_block_2, which satisfies this constraint. But since we're trying to be thorough, let's add another action to place blue_block_1 on top of brown_block_1.

Actually, I see a couple more issues in this plan:

1. To fully satisfy Constraint 16, after picking up orange_block_2 in step 5, we need to either keep holding it or place blue_block_1 on top of brown_block_1. We might not be able to do both because we have other actions to perform that require us to let go of orange_block_2 and manipulate other blocks.
2. Not sure if constraint 10 is actually satisfied with our sequence of steps. We need to verify that we have brown_block_1 on the table and be holding orange_block_2 at the same time. With the current steps, we first put brown_block_1 on the table, and then in the next step, we pick up orange_block_2. But I also think it's likely satisfied if I'm interpreting the constraint correctly. 
3. Constraint 14 says that if "black_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2", then "brown_block_1 is not clear" or "green_block_1 is on the table" must be true in the current or a future state. We plan to stack black_block_1 on orange_block_2 and then later pick up brown_block_1 and stack it under green_block_1. However, brown_block_1 on the table (after putting it down in step 4 and until we pick it up in step 9) is clear, and green_block_1 is not on the table. So, during this period, Constraint 14 may not be satisfied. We need to check when black_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2. It seems that happens in the initial state.

Let me address these issues one by one. First, let me double check Constraint 16. It says that if "orange_block_2 is not on the table", then "you are holding orange_block_2" or "blue_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1" must be true in the current or a future state. In the initial state, orange_block_2 is not on the table, so we need to either pick up orange_block_2 or place blue_block_1 on top of brown_block_1 at some point. We pick up orange_block_2 in step 5, which satisfies this constraint.

Next, let me check Constraint 10 again. It says we need to have brown_block_1 on the table and be holding orange_block_2 at some point. In step 4, we place brown_block_1 on the table, and in step 5, we pick up orange_block_2. At the end of step 5, brown_block_1 is on the table and we're holding orange_block_2, which satisfies Constraint 10.

Finally, let me check Constraint 14 again. It says that if "black_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2", then "brown_block_1 is not clear" or "green_block_1 is on the table" must be true in the current or a future state. In the initial state, black_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2, but brown_block_1 is clear and green_block_1 is not on the table. However, once we place green_block_1 on top of brown_block_1 in step 12, brown_block_1 will no longer be clear, which satisfies Constraint 14.

So, I think our plan is valid. Let's finalize it:

1. pickup black_block_1
2. putdown black_block_1
3. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
4. putdown brown_block_1
5. unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1
6. putdown orange_block_2
7. pickup black_block_1
8. stack black_block_1 orange_block_2
9. pickup brown_block_1
10. stack brown_block_1 red_block_1
11. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
12. stack green_block_1 brown_block_1
13. unstack green_block_1 brown_block_1

Seems valid to me. But let me see if any of these steps are unecessary:
1-2: Picking up and putting down black_block_1 seems unnecessary, but it's needed for Constraint 4. But couldn't I include this later? Let me try:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1
4. putdown orange_block_2
5. pickup black_block_1
6. stack black_block_1 orange_block_2
7. unstack black_block_1 orange_block_2  
   (We're now holding black_block_1, which can satisfy Constraint 4 for a future state where orange_block_1 is clear)
8. pickup brown_block_1
   (We can't do this while holding black_block_1)

So the initial handling of black_block_1 seems necessary for Constraint 4. Let me check if the entire sequence seems valid.

We're trying to get to a state where we're holding green_block_1. And we satisfy all the constraints along the way. In step 13, we're holding green_block_1, which achieves the goal.

Let's see the final state after step 13:
- Holding: green_block_1
- On table: orange_block_1, blue_block_1, red_block_1 with brown_block_1 on top, orange_block_2 with black_block_1 on top

This seems like a valid plan. Let me double-check that we've satisfied all constraints:

- Constraint 1 is satisfied in the initial state because blue_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1.
- Constraint 2 is satisfied in step 8 when we stack black_block_1 on orange_block_2.
- Constraint 3 is satisfied in step 11 when orange_block_1 becomes clear.
- Constraint 4 is satisfied because in step 1, we were holding black_block_1, which is earlier than step 11 when orange_block_1 becomes clear.
- Constraint 5 is satisfied in the initial state because orange_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1.
- Constraint 6 is satisfied because in step 1, we were holding black_block_1, which is after the initial state when orange_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1.
- Constraint 7 is satisfied in the initial state because blue_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1.
- Constraint 8 is satisfied in step 5 when red_block_1 becomes clear, which is after the initial state when blue_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1.
- Constraint 9 is satisfied in step 5 when red_block_1 becomes clear.
- Constraint 10 is satisfied at the end of step 5 when brown_block_1 is on the table and we're holding orange_block_2.
- Constraint 11 is satisfied in the initial state because blue_block_1 is not clear (red_block_1 is on top of it).
- Constraint 12 is satisfied in step 6 when orange_block_2 becomes clear, which is after the initial state when blue_block_1 is not clear.
- Constraint 13 is satisfied in the initial state because black_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2.
- Constraint 14 is satisfied in step 12 when brown_block_1 becomes not clear (green_block_1 is on top of it), which is after the initial state when black_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2.
- Constraint 15 is satisfied in the initial state because orange_block_2 is not on the table.
- Constraint 16 is satisfied in step 5 when we're holding orange_block_2, which is after the initial state when orange_block_2 is not on the table.
- Constraint 17 is satisfied in step 12 when green_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1, which is on top of red_block_1.

All constraints appear to be satisfied!

Let me double-check that we've achieved the goal:
- After step 13, we're holding green_block_1, which is the goal. Goal achieved!

So, our final plan is:
1. pickup black_block_1
2. putdown black_block_1
3. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
4. putdown brown_block_1
5. unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1
6. putdown orange_block_2
7. pickup black_block_1
8. stack black_block_1 orange_block_2
9. pickup brown_block_1
10. stack brown_block_1 red_block_1
11. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
12. stack green_block_1 brown_block_1
13. unstack green_block_1 brown_block_1

This plan seems valid and achieves the goal while satisfying all constraints!
