Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld problem. So, the goal is to end up holding the green_block_1. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy along the way. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the goal, then I'll go through each constraint to make sure the plan meets them all.

First, the initial state:

- orange_block_1 is on the table with green_block_1 on top of it. Green_block_1 is clear.
- blue_block_1 is on the table with red_block_1 on top, then orange_block_2, then brown_block_1. So the stack here is blue_block_1 -> red_block_1 -> orange_block_2 -> brown_block_1. Brown_block_1 is clear.
- black_block_1 is on the table and clear.
- The arm is empty.

The goal is to be holding green_block_1. So, to pick up green_block_1, I need to first make sure it's clear, which it already is. But it's on top of orange_block_1. Wait, but the preconditions for pickup are that the block is on the table. Oh, right! So green_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1, which is on the table. So to pick up green_block_1, I need to unstack it from orange_block_1. But wait, the unstack action requires that the block (green_block_1) is on top of another block (orange_block_1), and that the arm is empty. Since green_block_1 is clear, that's possible. So the action would be unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1. Then, after that, the arm is holding green_block_1, which is the goal. But wait, maybe that's all I need to do? But no, because there are all these constraints that must be satisfied during the plan. So even if the plan is just one action, I need to check if that action's effects and intermediate states meet all the constraints.

But let's look at the constraints one by one.

Constraints:

1. "blue_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1" must hold in at least one state. In the initial state, blue_block_1 is on the table, not on orange_block_1. So that's already true. Wait, but the initial state has orange_block_1 on the table with green_block_1 on top, and blue_block_1 is on the table. So blue_block_1 isn't on top of anything. So the initial state already satisfies this. But the constraint requires that this is true in at least one state. So maybe that's already satisfied. But the problem says "must abide by the following constraints", so perhaps we need to ensure that even if it's already true, but maybe during the plan, if any action changes that, we need to make sure it's true again. Wait, no. The first constraint says that the expression must hold in at least one state. Since it's already true in the initial state, that's satisfied. So maybe we don't need to do anything for that. But the second constraint linked to it: if blue_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1 in some state s, then black_block_1 must be on top of orange_block_2 in s or after. Since the initial state already has blue_block_1 not on orange_block_1, then the implication is that black_block_1 must be on orange_block_2 at some point after the initial state. But in the initial state, black_block_1 is on the table. So we need to make sure that at some point, black_block_1 is on orange_block_2. So that's a required step. So even if the plan could be just unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_1, but then the constraint about black_block_1 needing to be on orange_block_2 after the initial state (since the initial state already satisfies the first part) would not be met. Therefore, the plan must include putting black_block_1 on orange_block_2 at some point.

Another constraint: "there is no block on top of orange_block_1" must hold in at least one state. In the initial state, green_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1, so orange_block_1 is not clear. But after unstacking green_block_1, orange_block_1 becomes clear. So if the plan is just unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1, then in that state, orange_block_1 is clear, satisfying that constraint. But then the next constraint: if orange_block_1 is clear in some state, there must be an earlier state where black_block_1 is on orange_block_1 or the arm is holding black_block_1. Wait, in the plan where we unstack green_block_1, the state after that has orange_block_1 clear. But before that, in the initial state, black_block_1 is on the table and not on orange_block_1, and the arm isn't holding it. So this would violate that constraint. Therefore, we need to ensure that before making orange_block_1 clear, we have a state where either black_block_1 is on orange_block_1 or the arm is holding black_block_1. So to satisfy this, we need to either put black_block_1 on orange_block_1 and then remove it, or pick up black_block_1 at some point before making orange_block_1 clear.

But how? Let's think. The initial state has green_block_1 on orange_block_1. To make orange_block_1 clear, we have to remove green_block_1. But before that, we need to have a state where black_block_1 is on orange_block_1 or the arm is holding black_block_1. So perhaps we need to first move black_block_1 onto orange_block_1, then remove it, then unstack green_block_1. But that complicates the plan. Alternatively, perhaps we can pick up black_block_1 (since it's on the table and clear) before unstacking green_block_1. Let's see. If we pick up black_block_1, then put it down again, but that might not help. Wait, the constraint says that if orange_block_1 is clear in a state, then there must be an earlier state where black_block_1 is on it or the arm is holding it. So if we first pick up black_block_1 (holding it), then unstack green_block_1, then the state after unstacking has orange_block_1 clear, and the earlier state (when we picked up black_block_1) had the arm holding black_block_1. So that would satisfy the constraint. Because the holding of black_block_1 is before the state where orange_block_1 is clear.

So maybe the plan is:

1. pickup black_block_1 (since it's on the table and clear)
2. putdown black_block_1 (but why? Maybe not necessary. Alternatively, stack it somewhere. Wait, but the goal is to have green_block_1 in hand. So maybe after picking up black_block_1, we need to put it somewhere else to free the arm to unstack green_block_1. But perhaps stacking it on orange_block_2 would help with the earlier constraint that black_block_1 must be on orange_block_2 after the initial state. Let's see.

So let's outline possible steps:

- pickup black_block_1 (arm holds it)
- stack black_block_1 orange_block_2 (since orange_block_2 is under brown_block_1, so we need to unstack brown_block_1 first? Wait, no. Orange_block_2 is under brown_block_1. So in the initial state, orange_block_2 is on red_block_1, and brown_block_1 is on orange_block_2. So orange_block_2 is not clear. Therefore, to stack anything on orange_block_2, it needs to be clear. So we can't stack black_block_1 on orange_block_2 unless we first remove brown_block_1.

So maybe the steps would involve:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1
4. putdown orange_block_2 (but this would make orange_block_2 on the table, which might affect constraints)
Wait, but the constraint says "orange_block_2 is not on the table" must hold in at least one state. In the initial state, orange_block_2 is on red_block_1, so not on the table. If we put it on the table, then in that state, it's on the table. But the constraint requires that there's a state where orange_block_2 is not on the table. Since the initial state already satisfies that, maybe we don't have to worry. But another constraint says that if orange_block_2 is not on the table in some state s, then in s or after, either the arm is holding orange_block_2 or blue_block_1 is on brown_block_1. Hmm.

Alternatively, let's think of the required steps to get black_block_1 on orange_block_2. To do that, we need orange_block_2 to be clear. But initially, brown_block_1 is on orange_block_2. So we need to unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_2. Then, we can stack black_block_1 on orange_block_2.

So steps could be:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. pickup black_block_1
4. stack black_block_1 orange_block_2

Then, after step 4, black_block_1 is on orange_block_2, satisfying the constraint that if blue_block_1 is not on orange_block_1 (which is always true), then black_block_1 is on orange_block_2 at some point after.

But we also need to handle the other constraints. For example, the constraint that "orange_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1" must hold in at least one state. In the initial state, orange_block_2 is on red_block_1, so that's already true. So that's satisfied. But if during the plan, orange_block_2 is moved on top of green_block_1, then we might need to ensure that it's not, but since the initial state already satisfies that, perhaps we don't need to do anything. However, the second part of that constraint says that if orange_block_2 is not on green_block_1 in some state s, then in s or after, either the arm is holding black_block_1 or brown_block_1 is on the table. So since in the initial state, orange_block_2 is not on green_block_1, then in the initial state or after, either the arm is holding black_block_1 (which it isn't initially) or brown_block_1 is on the table (which it isn't; it's on orange_block_2). So this would be a problem unless in the plan, after the initial state, either brown_block_1 is put on the table or black_block_1 is held. For example, in step 2, we putdown brown_block_1, so brown_block_1 is on the table. So in the state after step 2, brown_block_1 is on the table. So in the initial state, the condition is not met (since brown_block_1 is not on the table and the arm isn't holding black_block_1), but in step 2's state, brown_block_1 is on the table, so the implication is satisfied. Because the initial state's s (where orange_block_2 is not on green_block_1) requires that in s or after, the condition holds. Since in step 2, brown_block_1 is on the table, which is after the initial state, the constraint is satisfied.

Another constraint: "blue_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1" must hold in at least one state. In the initial state, blue_block_1 is on the table, red_block_1 is on blue_block_1. Wait, no: initial state says "blue_block_1 is on the table" and "red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1". So red_block_1 is on blue_block_1, not the other way around. So blue_block_1 is under red_block_1. So "blue_block_1 is not on top of red_block_1" is true in the initial state because blue_block_1 is under red_block_1. So the constraint is already satisfied. But the second part: if blue_block_1 is not on red_block_1 (which is always true), then in that state or after, either blue_block_1 is clear or red_block_1 is clear. In the initial state, blue_block_1 has red_block_1 on top, so blue_block_1 is not clear. Red_block_1 has orange_block_2 on top, so red_block_1 is not clear. So the initial state doesn't satisfy the "either blue_block_1 is clear or red_block_1 is clear". Therefore, the constraint requires that whenever blue_block_1 is not on red_block_1 (which is always true), then in that state or after, either blue_block_1 is clear or red_block_1 is clear. Since the initial state doesn't meet the consequent, this is a problem. Therefore, we need to ensure that in some state after the initial state, either blue_block_1 becomes clear or red_block_1 becomes clear.

Wait, but blue_block_1 is under red_block_1. To make blue_block_1 clear, we need to remove red_block_1. But red_block_1 is under orange_block_2 and brown_block_1. So to remove red_block_1 from blue_block_1, we'd have to unstack red_block_1 from blue_block_1, but in the initial state, red_block_1 has orange_block_2 on top. So we can't unstack red_block_1 unless we first remove orange_block_2 and brown_block_1. Alternatively, if we can make red_block_1 clear, then we can unstack it. Let's see.

But maybe another approach: if we unstack brown_block_1, then orange_block_2, then red_block_1. Let's see:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1
4. putdown orange_block_2
5. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_1
6. putdown red_block_1

After step 6, blue_block_1 is clear (since red_block_1 was removed). So in that state, blue_block_1 is clear, which satisfies the condition that either blue_block_1 is clear or red_block_1 is clear. But this seems like a lot of steps. However, considering the other constraints, maybe this is necessary.

Another constraint: "there is no block on top of red_block_1" must hold in at least one state. In the initial state, orange_block_2 is on red_block_1, so red_block_1 is not clear. To make red_block_1 clear, we need to remove orange_block_2. So perhaps steps 1-4 above would do that. After step 3, unstack orange_block_2 from red_block_1, which makes red_block_1 clear. So in that state, red_block_1 is clear. So that satisfies the constraint.

Another constraint: "The following conditions are all true: brown_block_1 is on the table, you are holding orange_block_2". So we need a state where brown_block_1 is on the table and the arm is holding orange_block_2. Let's see: if we unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_2 (step 1), put it down (step 2), then unstack orange_block_2 from red_block_1 (step 3). At step 3, after unstacking, the arm is holding orange_block_2. Also, brown_block_1 is on the table from step 2. So in the state after step 3, brown_block_1 is on the table and the arm is holding orange_block_2. That satisfies the constraint.

Another constraint: "there is a block on top of blue_block_1" must hold in at least one state. In the initial state, red_block_1 is on blue_block_1, so that's true. So that's already satisfied. But the linked constraint: if there is a block on top of blue_block_1 (which is true in initial state), then in that state or after, orange_block_2 must be clear. In the initial state, orange_block_2 has brown_block_1 on top, so it's not clear. So we need to make sure that at some point after the initial state, orange_block_2 becomes clear. For example, when we unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_2 (step 1), then orange_block_2 is clear. So after step 1, orange_block_2 is clear. That would satisfy the constraint.

Another constraint: "black_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_2" must hold in at least one state. Initially, black_block_1 is on the table, so that's true. But if we stack black_block_1 on orange_block_2, then we need to have a state where it's not. So perhaps we need to stack and then unstack it, but that complicates things. Alternatively, since the initial state already satisfies this, maybe we don't need to do anything. But the linked constraint says that if black_block_1 is not on orange_block_2 in some state s, then in s or after, either brown_block_1 is not clear or green_block_1 is on the table. In the initial state, black_block_1 is not on orange_block_2, so s is the initial state. Then, in s or after, either brown_block_1 is not clear (initially, brown_block_1 is clear, so that's not true) or green_block_1 is on the table (initially, green_block_1 is on orange_block_1, not the table). So the initial state violates this unless we take action. Therefore, we need to ensure that after the initial state, either brown_block_1 becomes not clear (i.e., something is stacked on it) or green_block_1 is put on the table. But green_block_1 is on orange_block_1 initially, so to put it on the table, we need to unstack it, which is part of the goal. But if we unstack green_block_1, then it's in the arm, not on the table. So perhaps putting it down would make it on the table. But the goal is to be holding it at the end. So maybe we can't put it down. Alternatively, make brown_block_1 not clear. For example, stack something on brown_block_1. But brown_block_1 is initially on top of orange_block_2, which is on red_block_1, etc. If we unstack brown_block_1 and put it down, then brown_block_1 is on the table and clear. So to make brown_block_1 not clear, we could stack something on it. But that would require having another block available. The blocks available are black_block_1, which is on the table. So perhaps:

After unstacking brown_block_1 (step 1), put it down (step 2), then pickup black_block_1 (step 3), stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1 (step 4). Then, brown_block_1 has black_block_1 on top, so it's not clear. But in that case, when we do that, in the state after step 4, black_block_1 is on brown_block_1. Then, in the state after step 4, brown_block_1 is not clear. So in the initial state s, black_block_1 is not on orange_block_2, and in the state after step 4, brown_block_1 is not clear. So the implication is satisfied because after s, brown_block_1 becomes not clear. So that would work.

But this adds more steps. Let me try to outline the steps again, considering all constraints.

Let's try to plan step by step, considering all constraints:

1. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_2. This makes orange_block_2 clear (needed for the constraint linked to blue_block_1 not being clear). After this, the arm holds brown_block_1.

2. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table. Now, brown_block_1 is on the table and clear. This helps with the constraint that requires "brown_block_1 is on the table" in some state when holding orange_block_2.

3. Unstack orange_block_2 from red_block_1. Now, the arm holds orange_block_2, and red_block_1 becomes clear. This satisfies the constraint that red_block_1 is clear in some state. Also, in this state, brown_block_1 is on the table, and the arm holds orange_block_2, satisfying the constraint that both are true in the same state.

4. Putdown orange_block_2. Now, orange_block_2 is on the table. But we have a constraint that "orange_block_2 is not on the table" must hold in at least one state. Wait, but in the initial state, orange_block_2 is not on the table. So that's already satisfied. However, if we put it on the table, then in that state, it's on the table, but the constraint just requires that there's at least one state where it's not on the table, which is already true. The linked constraint says that if orange_block_2 is not on the table in some state s, then in s or after, either the arm is holding it or blue_block_1 is on brown_block_1. Since in the initial state, orange_block_2 is not on the table, and in step 3, the arm is holding it (so satisfies the "holding" condition), that's okay. So putting it down may not be necessary unless needed for other steps.

Alternatively, after step 3, we can stack orange_block_2 somewhere else. But perhaps it's better to put it down to free the arm.

5. Now, we need to handle the constraint related to black_block_1 being on orange_block_2. Let's say after step 2, brown_block_1 is on the table. Then, we can pickup black_block_1 (since it's clear on the table), and stack it on orange_block_2 (which is now on the table and clear after step 4). Wait, no: after step 4, orange_block_2 is on the table. To stack black_block_1 on orange_block_2, we need orange_block_2 to be clear. Since we just put it down, it is clear. So:

5. Pickup black_block_1.

6. Stack black_block_1 on orange_block_2. Now, black_block_1 is on orange_block_2, satisfying the constraint that after the initial state (where blue_block_1 is not on orange_block_1), black_block_1 is on orange_block_2.

Now, we also need to handle the constraint that when orange_block_1 becomes clear, there was a prior state where black_block_1 was on it or being held. Since we picked up black_block_1 in step 5, that would be the prior state where the arm was holding it. Then, when we unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_1 (making orange_block_1 clear), the prior step 5 where the arm was holding black_block_1 satisfies that constraint.

So steps so far:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1
4. putdown orange_block_2
5. pickup black_block_1
6. stack black_block_1 orange_block_2

Now, after step 6, black_block_1 is on orange_block_2, satisfying the first linked constraint. Also, in step 5, the arm was holding black_block_1, which helps when we later make orange_block_1 clear.

Next, we need to unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_1 to hold it. But before that, we need to make sure that when we do that, the preconditions are met. green_block_1 is clear initially, and the arm is empty. After step 6, the arm is empty. So steps:

7. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1

Now, the arm holds green_block_1, which is the goal. But we need to check if all constraints are satisfied.

Let's verify each constraint:

1. "blue_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1" must hold in at least one state. This is true in all states, including the initial.

2. If "blue_block_1 not on orange_block_1" in s, then "black_block_1 on orange_block_2" in s or after. In the initial state, s is true, and in step 6, black_block_1 is stacked on orange_block_2, so satisfied.

3. "orange_block_1 is clear" must hold in at least one state. After step 7, orange_block_1 is clear. So yes.

4. If orange_block_1 is clear in a state, there must be an earlier state where black_block_1 is on it or held. The state after step 7 is clear. Earlier, in step 5, the arm was holding black_block_1, which satisfies the condition.

5. "orange_block_2 is not on green_block_1" must hold in at least one state. This was true initially and remains true.

6. If orange_block_2 is not on green_block_1 in s, then in s or after, hold black_block_1 or brown_block_1 is on table. In the initial state, s is true, and in step 2, brown_block_1 is put on the table, which is after, so satisfied.

7. "blue_block_1 not on red_block_1" is always true, and after step 3, red_block_1 is clear (since orange_block_2 was removed), so in step 3 and after, red_block_1 is clear, satisfying the condition that either blue_block_1 is clear or red_block_1 is clear. Blue_block_1 is not clear (since red_block_1 was on it, and after step 3, red_block_1 is on blue_block_1 but is clear? Wait, after step 3: unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1. Wait, red_block_1 is under orange_block_2. So unstacking orange_block_2 from red_block_1 leaves red_block_1 on blue_block_1 and clear. So red_block_1 is clear. Therefore, in step 3, after unstacking, red_block_1 is clear. So the condition that either blue_block_1 is clear or red_block_1 is clear is satisfied (red_block_1 is clear). So that's okay.

8. "red_block_1 is clear" must hold in at least one state. This happens after step 3 when orange_block_2 is removed.

9. "brown_block_1 on table and holding orange_block_2" must hold. This happens after step 3: brown_block_1 is on the table (from step 2), and the arm is holding orange_block_2 (step 3).

10. "blue_block_1 not clear" must hold in at least one state. Initially, blue_block_1 has red_block_1 on top, so it's not clear. So satisfied.

11. If blue_block_1 is not clear (which is true in initial state), then orange_block_2 must be clear in that state or after. In step 1, after unstacking brown_block_1, orange_block_2 is clear. So satisfied.

12. "black_block_1 not on orange_block_2" must hold in at least one state. Initially true. But after step 6, black_block_1 is on orange_block_2. So we need another state where it's not. However, the constraint is that it must hold in at least one state. The initial state satisfies it, so it's okay. The linked constraint: if black_block_1 is not on orange_block_2 in s, then in s or after, brown_block_1 is not clear or green_block_1 is on table. In the initial state, s is true, and in step 2, brown_block_1 is on the table (so clear), but green_block_1 is not on the table. Wait, after step 2, brown_block_1 is on the table and clear. So in the initial state s, the implication requires that in s or after, either brown_block_1 is not clear or green_block_1 is on table. But after step 2, brown_block_1 is clear. So this would not be satisfied unless we take another action. Wait, this is a problem. Because in the initial state, black_block_1 is not on orange_block_2, so s is the initial state. The implication is that in s or after, either brown_block_1 is not clear or green_block_1 is on the table. But after step 2, brown_block_1 is on the table and clear. So in all states after initial, brown_block_1 is clear (until possibly step 6). So we need to have either brown_block_1 not clear or green_block_1 on table in some state after initial.

But green_block_1 is never put on the table in the plan so far; it's unstacked in step 7 and held. So green_block_1 is not on the table in any state after the initial. So to satisfy the implication, we need to have brown_block_1 not clear in some state after initial. How? Maybe stack something on brown_block_1. For example, after step 2, brown_block_1 is on the table. If we then stack another block on it, like black_block_1, then brown_block_1 would not be clear.

But in our current plan, step 5 picks up black_block_1 and stacks it on orange_block_2. What if instead, after step 2, we stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1?

Let me adjust the steps:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. pickup black_block_1
4. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1 (now, brown_block_1 has black_block_1 on top, so not clear)
5. unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1
6. putdown orange_block_2
7. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1

But then, in step 4, stacking black_block_1 on brown_block_1 makes brown_block_1 not clear. So in the initial state s (where black_block_1 is not on orange_block_2), after step 4, brown_block_1 is not clear, which satisfies the implication. Also, this way, black_block_1 is not on orange_block_2, so the initial state's constraint is still satisfied. But we need to have black_block_1 on orange_block_2 to satisfy the first linked constraint. Oh right, the first linked constraint requires that after the initial state (where blue_block_1 is not on orange_block_1), black_block_1 must be on orange_block_2. So in this adjusted plan, black_block_1 is stacked on brown_block_1, not on orange_block_2. That would fail the first linked constraint. Therefore, we can't do that. So we need to stack black_block_1 on orange_block_2, which would make black_block_1 on orange_block_2, satisfying that constraint. But then, after step 6, black_block_1 is on orange_block_2, so in the state after step 6, black_block_1 is on orange_block_2, which means that the initial state's implication for constraint 12 is not met, because in the initial state s (black_block_1 not on orange_block_2), we need in s or after that either brown_block_1 is not clear or green_block_1 is on the table. But after step 6, black_block_1 is on orange_block_2, which doesn't affect brown_block_1's status. If we stacked black_block_1 on brown_block_1 instead, then brown_block_1 would not be clear. But then we'd fail the first linked constraint. This is a conflict.

Hmm. So maybe we need to have black_block_1 on orange_block_2 and also make sure that brown_block_1 is not clear at some point. How?

Alternatively, after stacking black_block_1 on orange_block_2 (step 6), then in a later step, unstack black_block_1 and stack it on brown_block_1. But that adds steps. For example:

After step 6:

7. unstack black_block_1 orange_block_2
8. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1

Now, in step 8, brown_block_1 is not clear. So in the initial state s (black_block_1 not on orange_block_2), after step 8, brown_block_1 is not clear, satisfying the implication. Also, between steps 6 and 7, black_block_1 is on orange_block_2, satisfying the first linked constraint. But this adds more steps. However, it might be necessary.

But this complicates the plan. Let's see:

Steps:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1
4. putdown orange_block_2
5. pickup black_block_1
6. stack black_block_1 orange_block_2 (now, constraint 1's implication is satisfied)
7. unstack black_block_1 orange_block_2
8. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1 (now, brown_block_1 is not clear)
9. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1

But this is getting too long. Let's check if this is necessary.

The constraint for black_block_1 not on orange_block_2: must hold in at least one state. It holds initially. But after step 6, it's on orange_block_2. So the constraint is still satisfied because it's required to hold in at least one state, which is the initial. However, the linked constraint says that if in any state s, black_block_1 is not on orange_block_2, then in s or after, either brown_block_1 is not clear or green_block_1 is on the table. In the initial state s, black_block_1 is not on orange_block_2, so the implication applies. In the initial state, brown_block_1 is clear (it's on orange_block_2), and green_block_1 is not on the table. So in s (initial), the consequent is not met. Therefore, we need to ensure that after the initial state, either brown_block_1 becomes not clear or green_block_1 is put on the table. Since green_block_1 is unstacked and held (step 9), it's never put on the table. So we need to make brown_block_1 not clear after the initial state. To do that, we need to stack something on brown_block_1. Since brown_block_1 is on the table after step 2, we can stack black_block_1 on it. So steps:

After step 2 (brown_block_1 on table):

3. pickup black_block_1
4. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1 (now, brown_block_1 is not clear)
5. unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1
6. putdown orange_block_2
7. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1

But then, we need to have black_block_1 on orange_block_2 for the first linked constraint. So this approach won't work. So maybe we have to do both: stack black_block_1 on orange_block_2 to satisfy the first constraint, and then move it to brown_block_1 to satisfy the implication for constraint 12.

But this is getting very complicated. Let's see if there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, after step 6 (stack black_block_1 on orange_block_2), we can leave it there. But then, in the state after step 6, black_block_1 is on orange_block_2, so the constraint 12's antecedent (black_block_1 not on orange_block_2) is no longer true in that state. The implication only applies to states where the antecedent is true. So the only state where the antecedent is true is the initial state and steps before step 6. So in the initial state, we need to ensure that in s (initial) or after, either brown_block_1 is not clear or green_block_1 is on the table. After step 4, brown_block_1 is on the table and clear. So we need to make brown_block_1 not clear after the initial state. Therefore, perhaps after step 2 (putting brown_block_1 on the table), we can stack something else on it, like orange_block_2. Wait, but orange_block_2 is being moved in step 3.

Wait, after step 2, brown_block_1 is on the table. Then, after step 3, unstack orange_block_2 from red_block_1 and put it down (step 4). Then, perhaps stack orange_block_2 on brown_block_1. That way, brown_block_1 is not clear.

So revised steps:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1
4. stack orange_block_2 brown_block_1 (instead of putting it down)
5. pickup black_block_1
6. stack black_block_1 orange_block_2 (but orange_block_2 is now on brown_block_1, so to stack black_block_1 on orange_block_2, orange_block_2 must be clear. But after step 4, orange_block_2 is on brown_block_1 and clear? No, after stacking, orange_block_2 is on brown_block_1, and clear (since nothing is on top of it). So step 6 would be possible.

Wait, after step 4: stack orange_block_2 on brown_block_1. Then, brown_block_1 is not clear (has orange_block_2 on top). So that satisfies the implication for constraint 12. Then, step 5: pickup black_block_1, step 6: stack black_block_1 on orange_block_2 (which is on brown_block_1). That satisfies the first linked constraint (black_block_1 on orange_block_2 after initial state). Then, step 7: unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1.

This way, we satisfy all constraints:

- Constraint 12: in the initial state s (black_block_1 not on orange_block_2), after step 4, brown_block_1 is not clear (has orange_block_2 on top), so implication is satisfied.

- First linked constraint: after initial state, black_block_1 is on orange_block_2 (step 6).

This seems promising. Let's outline the steps:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1
4. stack orange_block_2 brown_block_1 (now, orange_block_2 is on brown_block_1, which is on the table)
5. pickup black_block_1
6. stack black_block_1 orange_block_2
7. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1

Now, check the constraints:

- Constraint 12: In the initial state, black_block_1 is not on orange_block_2. After step 4, brown_block_1 has orange_block_2 on top, so brown_block_1 is not clear. So the implication is satisfied because after the initial state, brown_block_1 is not clear.

- First linked constraint: black_block_1 is stacked on orange_block_2 in step 6, satisfying the requirement.

- The constraint that requires "black_block_1 must be on orange_block_2 after the initial state" is satisfied.

- The constraint that when orange_block_1 becomes clear (step 7), there's a prior state where black_block_1 was held (step 5).

- The constraint about brown_block_1 being on the table and holding orange_block_2: in step 3, after unstacking orange_block_2, the arm holds it, and brown_block_1 is on the table from step 2. So yes.

- The constraint about red_block_1 being clear: after step 3, red_block_1 is clear.

- The constraint about blue_block_1 not on red_block_1: always true, and after step 3, red_block_1 is clear, so either blue_block_1 is clear (no, blue_block_1 still has red_block_1 on it) or red_block_1 is clear (yes). So satisfied.

Wait, no: after step 3, red_block_1 is on blue_block_1 and clear. Because unstacking orange_block_2 from red_block_1 leaves red_block_1 on blue_block_1 and clear. So blue_block_1 is not clear (has red_block_1), but red_block_1 is clear. So the condition is satisfied.

Other constraints seem to be covered. Now, the plan steps:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1
4. stack orange_block_2 brown_block_1
5. pickup black_block_1
6. stack black_block_1 orange_block_2
7. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1

This gives us the goal of holding green_block_1 in step 7. Let's verify all constraints again:

1. blue_block_1 not on orange_block_1: always true.

2. After initial, black_block_1 on orange_block_2 (step 6).

3. orange_block_1 clear in step 7.

4. Prior state to step 7 (step 5) where arm holds black_block_1.

5. orange_block_2 not on green_block_1: always true.

6. In initial state, after step 2, brown_block_1 on table.

7. blue_block_1 not on red_block_1: always true, and after step 3, red_block_1 clear.

8. red_block_1 clear after step 3.

9. brown_block_1 on table and holding orange_block_2 in step 3.

10. blue_block_1 not clear initially (has red_block_1).

11. After initial, orange_block_2 clear in step 1 (after unstacking brown_block_1).

12. black_block_1 not on orange_block_2 in initial state, and after step 4, brown_block_1 not clear (has orange_block_2).

13. orange_block_2 not on table: in step 4, it's stacked on brown_block_1 (which is on table), so orange_block_2 is not on table. The constraint requires it to be not on table in at least one state, which is true.

14. The final constraint: "brown_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 and green_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1". Wait, this is another constraint that must hold in at least one state. The final constraint says that there must be a state where both brown_block_1 is on red_block_1 and green_block_1 is on brown_block_1. In our current plan, after step 4, brown_block_1 is on the table with orange_block_2 on it. So brown_block_1 is not on red_block_1. This constraint is not satisfied by the current plan. Oh no, I missed this!

So the last constraint requires that in at least one state, both brown_block_1 is on red_block_1 and green_block_1 is on brown_block_1. In the initial state, brown_block_1 is on orange_block_2, which is on red_block_1. So brown_block_1 is not on red_block_1. After step 1, brown_block_1 is on the table. So this constraint is not satisfied in the initial state or the plan steps so far. Therefore, the plan is invalid.

We need to create a state where brown_block_1 is on red_block_1 and green_block_1 is on brown_block_1. How can we achieve that?

In the initial state, the stack is blue_block_1 -> red_block_1 -> orange_block_2 -> brown_block_1. So to get brown_block_1 on red_block_1, we need to move it there. Also, green_block_1 is on orange_block_1. To have green_block_1 on brown_block_1, we need to stack it there.

So perhaps:

After moving brown_block_1 to red_block_1 and stacking green_block_1 on it.

But this would require significant changes. Let's think.

Alternative plan steps:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
2. stack brown_block_1 red_block_1 (but red_block_1 has orange_block_2 on it. Wait, no. Red_block_1 is under orange_block_2. So to stack brown_block_1 on red_block_1, we need to first remove orange_block_2.

So steps:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1
4. putdown orange_block_2
5. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_1
6. stack red_block_1 brown_block_1 (but brown_block_1 is on the table. Wait, no. After step 2, brown_block_1 is on the table. So stack red_block_1 on brown_block_1. But red_block_1 is being held after step 5.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's try:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1
4. stack orange_block_2 brown_block_1 (now brown_block_1 has orange_block_2)
5. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_1 (now red_block_1 is clear)
6. stack red_block_1 orange_block_2 (orange_block_2 is on brown_block_1; but orange_block_2 is not clear because of step 4)
Wait, orange_block_2 is under orange_block_2? No. After step 4, orange_block_2 is on brown_block_1. So to stack red_block_1 on orange_block_2, orange_block_2 must be clear. But after step 4, orange_block_2 is clear (since nothing is on top of it). So step 6: stack red_block_1 on orange_block_2.

But then, the stack becomes brown_block_1 -> orange_block_2 -> red_block_1.

Then, to get brown_block_1 on red_block_1, we need to move it. This seems messy.

Alternatively, after step 3, unstack orange_block_2 from red_block_1, then stack brown_block_1 on red_block_1.

So steps:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
2. stack brown_block_1 red_block_1 (but red_block_1 has orange_block_2 on top. So can't stack until orange_block_2 is removed.

So:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1
4. putdown orange_block_2
5. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_1
6. stack red_block_1 brown_block_1 (now, brown_block_1 is on the table, so red_block_1 is on brown_block_1)
7. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
8. stack green_block_1 red_block_1

Now, in step 8, green_block_1 is on red_block_1, which is on brown_block_1. But we need green_block_1 on brown_block_1 and brown_block_1 on red_block_1. This isn't the case. Hmm.

Alternatively:

After step 6, red_block_1 is on brown_block_1. Then, stack brown_block_1 on red_block_1. But that's not possible because brown_block_1 is under red_block_1.

This is getting too tangled. Let's try a different approach.

The final constraint requires that there exists a state where brown_block_1 is on red_block_1 and green_block_1 is on brown_block_1. In other words, a stack of red_block_1 -> brown_block_1 -> green_block_1. But in the initial state, red_block_1 is on blue_block_1, and green_block_1 is on orange_block_1. So to achieve this, we need to move brown_block_1 to red_block_1 and green_block_1 to brown_block_1.

Possible steps to achieve this:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1
4. putdown orange_block_2
5. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_1
6. stack red_block_1 brown_block_1 (now red_block_1 is on brown_block_1)
7. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
8. stack green_block_1 red_block_1 (now green_block_1 is on red_block_1, which is on brown_block_1)

But this makes the stack brown_block_1 -> red_block_1 -> green_block_1. But the constraint requires brown_block_1 on red_block_1 and green_block_1 on brown_block_1. So this is the reverse. So not correct.

Alternatively:

After step 5, unstack red_block_1 from blue_block_1 (step 5), then stack brown_block_1 on red_block_1 (step 6), then stack green_block_1 on brown_block_1 (step 7).

Steps:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1
4. putdown orange_block_2
5. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_1
6. stack red_block_1 blue_block_1 (wait, no, we need to stack brown_block_1 on red_block_1)
   Instead:
6. pickup brown_block_1
7. stack brown_block_1 red_block_1 (now red_block_1 is on blue_block_1, brown_block_1 is on red_block_1)
8. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
9. stack green_block_1 brown_block_1

Now, in step 9, green_block_1 is on brown_block_1, which is on red_block_1. So the state after step 9 has brown_block_1 on red_block_1 and green_block_1 on brown_block_1. This satisfies the final constraint.

But we also need to make sure that all other constraints are met. Let's check:

- The goal is to be holding green_block_1. But in step 9, we stack it, so the arm is empty. Therefore, we need to unstack it again.

So steps would be:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1
4. putdown orange_block_2
5. unstack red_block_1 blue_block_1
6. pickup brown_block_1
7. stack brown_block_1 red_block_1
8. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
9. stack green_block_1 brown_block_1
10. unstack green_block_1 brown_block_1

Now, step 10 gives us holding green_block_1. But this adds more steps. Also, we need to consider all other constraints, which might be satisfied during these steps.

But this is getting very long and complex. The optimal plan should be as short as possible. However, given the multiple constraints, it's challenging to find a short plan that satisfies all. Let's try to find a balance.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the initial plan with steps 1-7 (including stacking black_block_1 on orange_block_2 and making sure brown_block_1 is not clear) plus adding steps to satisfy the final constraint.

But this is getting too involved. Perhaps the correct answer requires a longer plan. However, due to time limitations, I'll proceed with the initial plan and add the necessary steps for the final constraint.

Final steps adjustment:

After step 6 (stack black_block_1 on orange_block_2), we need to get brown_block_1 on red_block_1 and green_block_1 on brown_block_1.

So steps:

7. unstack black_block_1 orange_block_2
8. putdown black_block_1
9. unstack orange_block_2 brown_block_1
10. stack orange_block_2 red_block_1
11. pickup brown_block_1
12. stack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
13. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
14. stack green_block_1 brown_block_1
15. unstack green_block_1 brown_block_1

Now, in step 14, green_block_1 is stacked on brown_block_1, which is on orange_block_2, which is on red_block_1. This doesn't meet the final constraint (brown_block_1 on red_block_1). So this isn't correct.

Alternative approach:

After step 3 (unstack orange_block_2 from red_block_1), stack brown_block_1 on red_block_1:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1
4. stack brown_block_1 red_block_1 (now brown_block_1 is on red_block_1)
5. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
6. stack green_block_1 brown_block_1
7. unstack green_block_1 brown_block_1

This way, in step 6, green_block_1 is on brown_block_1, which is on red_block_1. So the final constraint is satisfied in step 6. Then, step 7 unstack green_block_1 to hold it.

But let's check if this works with other constraints:

Steps:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1
4. stack brown_block_1 red_block_1 (now brown_block_1 is on red_block_1)
5. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1 (now holding green_block_1, but goal is to hold it)
6. stack green_block_1 brown_block_1 (now green_block_1 is on brown_block_1)
7. unstack green_block_1 brown_block_1 (now holding green_block_1)

This plan has 7 steps. Let's check constraints:

- Final constraint: step 6 has green_block_1 on brown_block_1 and brown_block_1 on red_block_1. Satisfied.

- Other constraints:

1. blue_block_1 not on orange_block_1: true.

2. After initial, black_block_1 must be on orange_block_2. But in this plan, black_block_1 is never moved. So the first linked constraint is not satisfied. Therefore, this plan is invalid.

So we need to incorporate moving black_block_1 to orange_block_2.

Combining steps to satisfy all constraints:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1
4. stack brown_block_1 red_block_1
5. pickup black_block_1
6. stack black_block_1 orange_block_2
7. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
8. stack green_block_1 brown_block_1
9. unstack green_block_1 brown_block_1

Now, check constraints:

- After step 6, black_block_1 is on orange_block_2 (satisfies first linked constraint).

- Final constraint: step 8 has green_block_1 on brown_block_1, which is on red_block_1. Satisfied.

- Constraint 12: in initial state, black_block_1 not on orange_block_2. After step 6, black_block_1 is on orange_block_2. So in steps after 6, the antecedent is not true. The implication only applies to states where the antecedent is true. The only state where the antecedent is true is initial and steps 1-5. After step 2, brown_block_1 is on the table. We need to ensure that after initial, in some state, brown_block_1 is not clear. After step 4, brown_block_1 is on red_block_1, so red_block_1 is not clear (has brown_block_1 on top). But brown_block_1 is clear unless something is stacked on it. So in step 4, brown_block_1 is clear. Then, after step 8, green_block_1 is on brown_block_1, so brown_block_1 is not clear. So in step 8, brown_block_1 is not clear. Therefore, the implication for constraint 12 is satisfied because after the initial state (s), there exists a state (step 8) where brown_block_1 is not clear.

This seems to satisfy all constraints. Now, the plan steps:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1
4. stack brown_block_1 red_block_1
5. pickup black_block_1
6. stack black_block_1 orange_block_2
7. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
8. stack green_block_1 brown_block_1
9. unstack green_block_1 brown_block_1

But wait, in step 7, we unstack green_block_1, which is allowed because it's clear. Then, step 8 stacks it on brown_block_1, which is on red_block_1. Then, step 9 unstacks it to hold it. This gives the goal. But this plan has 9 steps, which might not be optimal.

Is there a shorter way? Let's see:

After step 4, brown_block_1 is on red_block_1. Then, step 5: pickup black_block_1, step 6: stack black_block_1 orange_block_2 (which is on the table after step 3). Then, step 7: unstack green_block_1 and hold it. But then, the final constraint requires green_block_1 to be on brown_block_1. So we need to stack it there and then unstack. This adds steps. Alternatively, can we stack green_block_1 on brown_block_1 in the same step as unstacking?

Alternatively, can we avoid stacking green_block_1 and instead just unstack it? No, because the final constraint requires that it's on brown_block_1 in some state.

Therefore, this plan of 9 steps seems necessary.

But the problem asks for an optimal plan, i.e., the shortest possible. Let's see if any steps can be merged or eliminated.

For example, steps 5 and 6 (pickup and stack black_block_1) are necessary for the first linked constraint. Steps 7-9 are necessary for the final constraint and the goal.

Alternatively, after step 4, stack black_block_1 on orange_block_2:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
2. stack brown_block_1 red_block_1 (requires unstacking orange_block_2 first)
But this might not be possible.

Alternatively:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
2. stack brown_block_1 red_block_1 (but red_block_1 has orange_block_2 on top. So first unstack orange_block_2)
3. unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1
4. putdown orange_block_2
5. stack brown_block_1 red_block_1
6. pickup black_block_1
7. stack black_block_1 orange_block_2
8. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
9. stack green_block_1 brown_block_1
10. unstack green_block_1 brown_block_1

This is similar to the previous plan. It seems that the final constraint requires at least these steps. Therefore, the optimal plan must include these actions.

But I'm not sure if there's a shorter way. Given the complexity of the constraints, this might be the minimal plan.
