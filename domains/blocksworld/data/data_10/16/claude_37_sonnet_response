Alright, let's understand the problem. We are given an initial state of a blocksworld problem and a goal state. We also have a set of constraints that need to be satisfied.

Let's first outline the initial state:
- `green_block_1` is on the table
- `black_block_1` is on the table
- `black_block_2` is on the table
- `yellow_block_1` is on top of `green_block_1`
- `white_block_1` is on top of `black_block_2`
- `black_block_3` is on top of `white_block_1`
- `black_block_4` is on top of `black_block_3`
- `black_block_1` is clear
- `yellow_block_1` is clear
- `black_block_4` is clear
- The robotic arm is not holding any block

Visually, the initial state looks like this:

```
      black_block_4
          |
      black_block_3
          |
      white_block_1
          |
      black_block_2     yellow_block_1
                            |
 black_block_1         green_block_1
       |                    |
   table               table
```

The goal state is simple: `white_block_1` should be on the table.

Now, let's go through the constraints one by one and understand what they require:

1. At some point, `green_block_1` should be on top of `white_block_1` while the robotic arm is holding `black_block_1`.
2. At some point, the robotic arm should be holding `white_block_1`.
3. If the robotic arm is holding `white_block_1`, then after that (or at the same time), either `black_block_1` or `black_block_4` should not be clear.
4. At some point, `black_block_3` should not be on top of `yellow_block_1`. (Note: Initially, it's not on top of `yellow_block_1` anyway.)
5. If `black_block_3` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`, then after that (or at the same time), either `black_block_2` should not be on the table or the robotic arm should be holding `green_block_1`.
6. In every state, `black_block_3` should not be on the table.
7. At some point, `black_block_4` should not be on top of `yellow_block_1`. (Note: Initially, it's not on top of `yellow_block_1` anyway.)
8. If `black_block_4` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`, then after that (or at the same time), `black_block_2` should not be clear.
9. At some point, the robotic arm should be holding `green_block_1`.
10. At some point, `white_block_1` should be on top of `black_block_1`.
11. At some point, `black_block_2` should be on top of `black_block_1`.
12. In every state, `black_block_4` should not be on the table.
13. At some point, the robotic arm should be holding `black_block_1`.

This is a complex problem with many constraints. Let's try to derive a plan that satisfies all of them.

First, let's understand the goal: we want `white_block_1` to be on the table. In the initial state, `white_block_1` is on top of `black_block_2`. To move it to the table, we need to:
1. Unstack `black_block_4` from `black_block_3`
2. Unstack `black_block_3` from `white_block_1`
3. Unstack `white_block_1` from `black_block_2`
4. Put down `white_block_1` on the table

But that's just to achieve the final goal. We also need to ensure all the constraints are satisfied. Let's try to incorporate them into our plan.

Let's start by noting the constraints that must be satisfied in every state:
- `black_block_3` should not be on the table.
- `black_block_4` should not be on the table.

These are important as they restrict what we can do with these blocks.

Now, let's try to come up with a plan that satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal.

First, we need to ensure `white_block_1` is on the table at the end. But we also need to visit the states required by the constraints.

Let's try to build a plan:

1. Unstack `black_block_4` from `black_block_3`
   - After this, `black_block_3` is clear.
   - `black_block_4` is being held.
   - `black_block_4` is not on top of `yellow_block_1` (constraint 7).
   - But we need to ensure `black_block_2` is not clear (constraint 8). Currently, `white_block_1` is on top of `black_block_2`, so `black_block_2` is indeed not clear.

2. Now, we need to place `black_block_4` somewhere to free up the robotic arm.
   - We can't place it on the table (constraint 12).
   - We can place it on clear blocks: `black_block_1` or `yellow_block_1`.
   - Let's place it on `black_block_1`: Stack `black_block_4` on `black_block_1`.
   - This ensures `black_block_1` is not clear.
   - If we later pick up `white_block_1`, constraint 3 will be satisfied.

3. Unstack `black_block_3` from `white_block_1`
   - This makes `white_block_1` clear.
   - `black_block_3` is being held.
   - We can't place `black_block_3` on the table (constraint 6).
   - We need to stack it somewhere: `black_block_4`, `yellow_block_1`, or others.
   - Let's stack it on `yellow_block_1`: Stack `black_block_3` on `yellow_block_1`.
   - This will trigger constraint 5 in the future, which means we'll need to hold `green_block_1` at some point.

4. Unstack `white_block_1` from `black_block_2`
   - This makes `black_block_2` clear.
   - `white_block_1` is being held (constraint 2).
   - Constraint 3 requires either `black_block_1` or `black_block_4` to not be clear. `black_block_1` is indeed not clear (it has `black_block_4` on it).

5. While we're holding `white_block_1`, let's place it on `black_block_1` (constraint 10).
   - This means we need to unstack `black_block_4` from `black_block_1` first.
   - But to do that, we need to put down `white_block_1` somewhere first.
   - Let's put `white_block_1` on the table temporarily.

6. Unstack `black_block_4` from `black_block_1`
   - `black_block_1` is now clear.
   - `black_block_4` is being held.
   - We can't place it on the table (constraint 12).
   - Let's place it on `black_block_2`: Stack `black_block_4` on `black_block_2`.

7. Pickup `white_block_1` from the table.
   - `white_block_1` is being held.
   - Constraint 3 requires either `black_block_1` or `black_block_4` to not be clear. `black_block_4` is indeed not clear (it's on `black_block_2`).

8. Stack `white_block_1` on `black_block_1` (constraint 10).
   - This means `black_block_1` is no longer clear.

9. We need to satisfy constraint 11 (at some point, `black_block_2` should be on top of `black_block_1`).
   - For this, we need to unstack `white_block_1` from `black_block_1`.

10. Unstack `white_block_1` from `black_block_1`
    - `black_block_1` is now clear.
    - `white_block_1` is being held.
    - Constraint 3 requires either `black_block_1` or `black_block_4` to not be clear. `black_block_4` is clear at this point (it's on `black_block_2`).
    - To satisfy constraint 3, we might need to place `white_block_1` down and then place another block on top of either `black_block_1` or `black_block_4`.

11. Put down `white_block_1` on the table.
    - This achieves the final goal.

12. Unstack `black_block_4` from `black_block_2`.
    - `black_block_2` is now clear.
    - `black_block_4` is being held.

13. Stack `black_block_4` on `black_block_1` (to satisfy constraint 3).
    - `black_block_1` is no longer clear.

14. Pick up `black_block_2` from the table.
    - `black_block_2` is being held.

15. Stack `black_block_2` on `black_block_1` (constraint 11).
    - `black_block_1` is no longer clear.

I realized that this plan doesn't satisfy constraint 1 (at some point, `green_block_1` should be on top of `white_block_1` while the robotic arm is holding `black_block_1`).

Let's revise our plan to incorporate this constraint:

After Step 11, `white_block_1` is on the table. We need to place `green_block_1` on top of it. But `green_block_1` has `yellow_block_1` on top of it, which has `black_block_3` on top of it. So we need to unstack these blocks first.

11. Put down `white_block_1` on the table.

12. Unstack `black_block_3` from `yellow_block_1`.
    - `yellow_block_1` is now clear.
    - `black_block_3` is being held.
    - We can't place it on the table (constraint 6).
    - Let's place it on `black_block_2`: Stack `black_block_3` on `black_block_2`.

13. Unstack `yellow_block_1` from `green_block_1`.
    - `green_block_1` is now clear.
    - `yellow_block_1` is being held.
    - Let's place it on `black_block_3`: Stack `yellow_block_1` on `black_block_3`.

14. Pickup `green_block_1` from the table (constraint 9).
    - `green_block_1` is being held.
    - This satisfies constraint 5.

15. Stack `green_block_1` on `white_block_1`.
    - `white_block_1` is no longer clear.
    - This is one part of constraint 1.

16. Unstack `black_block_4` from `black_block_1` (assuming it's on `black_block_1` from a previous step).
    - `black_block_1` is now clear.
    - `black_block_4` is being held.
    - We can't place it on the table (constraint 12).
    - Let's place it on `black_block_2` (which has `black_block_3` and `yellow_block_1` on it): Stack `black_block_4` on `yellow_block_1`.

17. Pickup `black_block_1` from the table (constraint 13).
    - `black_block_1` is being held.
    - Together with `green_block_1` on `white_block_1`, this satisfies constraint 1.

18. Stack `black_block_1` on `green_block_1`.
    - This continues our progress.

19. Unstack `black_block_1` from `green_block_1`.
    - `green_block_1` is now clear.
    - `black_block_1` is being held.

20. Stack `black_block_2` on `black_block_1` (constraint 11).
    - `black_block_1` is no longer clear.

Hmm, I've made a mistake in my planning. Let's be more systematic and ensure that our plan satisfies all constraints.

Let's start with a fresh plan, ensuring we achieve all constraints and the final goal.

initial state:
- `green_block_1` is on the table
- `black_block_1` is on the table
- `black_block_2` is on the table
- `yellow_block_1` is on top of `green_block_1`
- `white_block_1` is on top of `black_block_2`
- `black_block_3` is on top of `white_block_1`
- `black_block_4` is on top of `black_block_3`
- `black_block_1` is clear
- `yellow_block_1` is clear
- `black_block_4` is clear

Constraints to satisfy:
1. At some point, `green_block_1` should be on top of `white_block_1` while the robotic arm is holding `black_block_1`.
2. At some point, the robotic arm should be holding `white_block_1`.
3. If the robotic arm is holding `white_block_1`, then after that (or at the same time), either `black_block_1` or `black_block_4` should not be clear.
4. At some point, `black_block_3` should not be on top of `yellow_block_1`. (Note: Initially, it's not on top of `yellow_block_1` anyway.)
5. If `black_block_3` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`, then after that (or at the same time), either `black_block_2` should not be on the table or the robotic arm should be holding `green_block_1`.
6. In every state, `black_block_3` should not be on the table.
7. At some point, `black_block_4` should not be on top of `yellow_block_1`. (Note: Initially, it's not on top of `yellow_block_1` anyway.)
8. If `black_block_4` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`, then after that (or at the same time), `black_block_2` should not be clear.
9. At some point, the robotic arm should be holding `green_block_1`.
10. At some point, `white_block_1` should be on top of `black_block_1`.
11. At some point, `black_block_2` should be on top of `black_block_1`.
12. In every state, `black_block_4` should not be on the table.
13. At some point, the robotic arm should be holding `black_block_1`.

Goal: `white_block_1` is on the table.

Let me come up with a plan step by step:

1. Unstack `black_block_4` from `black_block_3`
   - `black_block_3` is now clear
   - `black_block_4` is being held
   - Constraint 7 is satisfied: `black_block_4` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`
   - We need to ensure constraint 8: `black_block_2` should not be clear. Currently, `white_block_1` is on top of `black_block_2`, so `black_block_2` is not clear, satisfying constraint 8.

2. We need to place `black_block_4` somewhere. Due to constraint 12, we can't place it on the table. The only clear blocks are `black_block_1` and `yellow_block_1`.
   - Stack `black_block_4` on `black_block_1`
   - `black_block_1` is no longer clear
   - Constraint 8 continues to be satisfied.

3. Unstack `black_block_3` from `white_block_1`
   - `white_block_1` is now clear
   - `black_block_3` is being held
   - Constraint 4 is satisfied: `black_block_3` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`
   - We need to ensure constraint 5: either `black_block_2` is not on the table or we're holding `green_block_1`. Since we're not holding `green_block_1` and `black_block_2` is on the table, we don't satisfy this constraint yet.

4. We need to place `black_block_3` somewhere, but due to constraint 6, we can't place it on the table. The only clear blocks are `black_block_4` and `yellow_block_1`.
   - Stack `black_block_3` on `yellow_block_1`
   - `yellow_block_1` is no longer clear

5. Unstack `white_block_1` from `black_block_2`
   - `black_block_2` is now clear
   - `white_block_1` is being held
   - Constraint 2 is satisfied: we're holding `white_block_1`
   - We need to ensure constraint 3: either `black_block_1` or `black_block_4` is not clear. `black_block_1` is not clear (it has `black_block_4` on it), so constraint 3 is satisfied.

6. We need to place `white_block_1` somewhere. According to the final goal, we want `white_block_1` to be on the table. But before that, we need to satisfy constraint 10, which requires `white_block_1` to be on top of `black_block_1` at some point. However, `black_block_1` currently has `black_block_4` on it. We need to rearrange some blocks.
   - Let's put `white_block_1` on the table for now. This aligns with the final goal.
   - Putdown `white_block_1` on the table

7. Unstack `black_block_4` from `black_block_1`
   - `black_block_1` is now clear
   - `black_block_4` is being held
   - Constraint 7 continues to be satisfied

8. Since `black_block_2` is clear, constraint 8 requires `black_block_2` should not be clear after we move `black_block_4`. Let's address this.
   - Stack `black_block_4` on `black_block_2`
   - `black_block_2` is no longer clear
   - Constraint 8 is satisfied

9. Now, let's satisfy constraint 10: `white_block_1` should be on top of `black_block_1` at some point.
   - Pickup `white_block_1` from the table
   - `white_block_1` is being held
   - Constraint 2 is satisfied again

10. Stack `white_block_1` on `black_block_1`
    - `black_block_1` is no longer clear
    - Constraint 10 is satisfied

11. Now, let's satisfy constraint 11: `black_block_2` should be on top of `black_block_1` at some point. But `black_block_1` has `white_block_1` on it, and `black_block_2` has `black_block_4` on it. We need to rearrange.
    - Unstack `white_block_1` from `black_block_1`
    - `black_block_1` is now clear
    - `white_block_1` is being held
    - Constraint 2 is satisfied again
    - We need to ensure constraint 3: either `black_block_1` or `black_block_4` is not clear. Currently, both are clear, so we don't satisfy this constraint yet.

12. Putdown `white_block_1` on the table
    - This aligns with the final goal

13. Unstack `black_block_4` from `black_block_2`
    - `black_block_2` is now clear
    - `black_block_4` is being held
    - Constraint 7 continues to be satisfied
    - We need to ensure constraint 8: `black_block_2` should not be clear. But `black_block_2` is clear now, so we don't satisfy this constraint yet.

14. Stack `black_block_4` on `black_block_1`
    - `black_block_1` is no longer clear
    - Constraint 8 is now satisfied (even though `black_block_2` is clear, this constraint only matters if `black_block_4` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`, which is the case)

15. We need to satisfy constraint 11: `black_block_2` should be on top of `black_block_1` at some point. But `black_block_1` has `black_block_4` on it. We need to rearrange.
    - Unstack `black_block_4` from `black_block_1`
    - `black_block_1` is now clear
    - `black_block_4` is being held
    - Constraint 7 continues to be satisfied
    - We need to ensure constraint 8 again

16. Stack `black_block_4` on `black_block_2`
    - `black_block_2` is no longer clear
    - Constraint 8 is satisfied

17. Pickup `black_block_1` from the table
    - `black_block_1` is being held
    - Constraint 13 is satisfied

18. At this point, we can't satisfy constraint 11 (which requires `black_block_2` to be on top of `black_block_1`) because `black_block_2` has `black_block_4` on it. We need to rearrange.
    - Putdown `black_block_1` on the table
    - `black_block_1` is on the table and clear

19. Unstack `black_block_4` from `black_block_2`
    - `black_block_2` is now clear
    - `black_block_4` is being held
    - Constraint 7 continues to be satisfied
    - We need to ensure constraint 8 again

20. Stack `black_block_4` on `black_block_1`
    - `black_block_1` is no longer clear
    - Constraint 8 is now satisfied

21. Pickup `black_block_2` from the table
    - `black_block_2` is being held

22. Put down `black_block_2` on the table (temporarily)
    - `black_block_2` is on the table and clear

23. Unstack `black_block_4` from `black_block_1`
    - `black_block_1` is now clear
    - `black_block_4` is being held
    - Constraint 7 continues to be satisfied
    - We need to ensure constraint 8 again

24. Stack `black_block_4` on `black_block_2`
    - `black_block_2` is no longer clear
    - Constraint 8 is satisfied

25. Pickup `black_block_1` from the table
    - `black_block_1` is being held
    - Constraint 13 is satisfied

26. Let's satisfy constraint 11: `black_block_2` should be on top of `black_block_1`. But this conflicts with our current state where `black_block_2` is on the table and `black_block_1` is being held. We've clearly made a mistake in our planning.

Let's re-evaluate.

Constraint 11 and 13 seem to be conflicting if we try to satisfy them in the wrong order. Let's reconsider the entire plan more carefully.

Let's prioritize satisfying constraint 1, which requires `green_block_1` to be on top of `white_block_1` while the robotic arm is holding `black_block_1`.

For this to happen, we need to free `green_block_1` from `yellow_block_1` and place it on `white_block_1`. Then, we need to pick up `black_block_1`.

Given the constraints and the initial state, let's come up with a more coherent plan.

I think I'm getting a bit convoluted. Let me clearly and carefully outline a plan:

1. Unstack `black_block_4` from `black_block_3`
   - `black_block_3` is clear
   - `black_block_4` is being held
   - Constraint 7 is satisfied: `black_block_4` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`
   - Constraint 8 requires `black_block_2` not to be clear. In the initial state, `black_block_2` has blocks on top of it, so it's not clear, and this constraint is satisfied.

2. Stack `black_block_4` on `black_block_1`
   - `black_block_1` is no longer clear
   - Constraint 12 is satisfied: `black_block_4` is not on the table

3. Unstack `black_block_3` from `white_block_1`
   - `white_block_1` is clear
   - `black_block_3` is being held
   - Constraint 4 is satisfied: `black_block_3` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`
   - Constraint 5 requires either `black_block_2` not to be on the table or we're holding `green_block_1`. Neither is true right now, so we'll need to address this in a future step.

4. Stack `black_block_3` on `yellow_block_1`
   - `yellow_block_1` is no longer clear
   - Constraint 6 is satisfied: `black_block_3` is not on the table

5. Unstack `white_block_1` from `black_block_2`
   - `black_block_2` is clear
   - `white_block_1` is being held
   - Constraint 2 is satisfied: we're holding `white_block_1`
   - Constraint 3 requires either `black_block_1` or `black_block_4` to not be clear. `black_block_1` has `black_block_4` on it, so it's not clear, and this constraint is satisfied.

6. Putdown `white_block_1` on the table
   - `white_block_1` is on the table
   - The final goal is achieved

7. Pickup `black_block_2`
   - `black_block_2` is being held
   - Constraint 5 is satisfied: `black_block_2` is not on the table

8. Stack `black_block_2` on `black_block_1`
   - `black_block_1` now has `black_block_4` and `black_block_2` on it
   - Constraint 11 is satisfied: `black_block_2` is on top of `black_block_1`

But wait, that's not possible because `black_block_1` already has `black_block_4` on it. I've made an error. Let me correct.

8. Unstack `black_block_4` from `black_block_1`
   - `black_block_1` is clear
   - `black_block_4` is being held
   - Constraint 7 is satisfied: `black_block_4` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`
   - Constraint 8 requires `black_block_2` not to be clear. But `black_block_2` is clear now, so we need to address this.

9. Stack `black_block_4` on `black_block_2`
   - `black_block_2` is no longer clear
   - Constraint 8 is satisfied

10. Pickup `black_block_1`
    - `black_block_1` is being held
    - Constraint 13 is satisfied

11. Stack `black_block_1` on `white_block_1`
    - `white_block_1` is no longer clear
    - We're now approaching a state to satisfy constraint 1: we need `green_block_1` on top of `white_block_1` and the robotic arm holding `black_block_1`.

Hmm, I've made an error again. If we stack `black_block_1` on `white_block_1`, then `black_block_1` is no longer being held, so constraint 1 can't be satisfied in the next step. Let me correct.

Alright, let's try a different approach. 

From the constraints, we need at some point:
- `green_block_1` on top of `white_block_1` and the robotic arm holding `black_block_1`
- `white_block_1` on top of `black_block_1`
- `black_block_2` on top of `black_block_1`

But we also need `white_block_1` to be on the table in the final state.

Let's restructure our plan:

1. Unstack `black_block_4` from `black_block_3`
   - `black_block_3` is clear
   - `black_block_4` is being held
   - Constraint 7 is satisfied: `black_block_4` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`
   - Constraint 8 requires `black_block_2` not to be clear. In the initial state, `black_block_2` has blocks on top of it, so it's not clear, and this constraint is satisfied.

2. Stack `black_block_4` on `black_block_1`
   - `black_block_1` is no longer clear
   - Constraint 12 is satisfied: `black_block_4` is not on the table

3. Unstack `black_block_3` from `white_block_1`
   - `white_block_1` is clear
   - `black_block_3` is being held
   - Constraint 4 is satisfied: `black_block_3` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`
   - Constraint 5 requires either `black_block_2` not to be on the table or we're holding `green_block_1`. Neither is true right now, so we'll need to address this in a future step.

4. Stack `black_block_3` on `yellow_block_1`
   - `yellow_block_1` is no longer clear
   - Constraint 6 is satisfied: `black_block_3` is not on the table

5. Unstack `white_block_1` from `black_block_2`
   - `black_block_2` is clear
   - `white_block_1` is being held
   - Constraint 2 is satisfied: we're holding `white_block_1`
   - Constraint 3 requires either `black_block_1` or `black_block_4` to not be clear. `black_block_1` has `black_block_4` on it, so it's not clear, and this constraint is satisfied.

6. Stack `white_block_1` on `black_block_1`
   - `black_block_1` now has `black_block_4` and `white_block_1` on it
   - Constraint 10 is satisfied: `white_block_1` is on top of `black_block_1`

Oh, wait, that's not possible because `black_block_1` already has `black_block_4` on it. I've made the same error again.

OK, let me think step by step without rushing.

First, let's identify all the constraints that involve placing blocks on top of other blocks:
- constraint 1: `green_block_1` on top of `white_block_1`
- constraint 10: `white_block_1` on top of `black_block_1`
- constraint 11: `black_block_2` on top of `black_block_1`

These constraints potentially conflict with each other and with the final goal. Let's figure out a valid order to satisfy them.

Also, note constraints 6 and 12:
- constraint 6: `black_block_3` should not be on the table in any state
- constraint 12: `black_block_4` should not be on the table in any state

These constrain where we can place these blocks.

Now, let's try to build a plan:

1. Unstack `black_block_4` from `black_block_3`
   - `black_block_3` is clear
   - `black_block_4` is being held
   - Constraint 7 is satisfied: `black_block_4` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`
   - Constraint 8 requires `black_block_2` not to be clear. In the initial state, `black_block_2` has blocks on top of it, so it's not clear, and this constraint is satisfied.

2. Stack `black_block_4` on `black_block_1`
   - `black_block_1` is no longer clear
   - Constraint 12 is satisfied: `black_block_4` is not on the table

3. Unstack `black_block_3` from `white_block_1`
   - `white_block_1` is clear
   - `black_block_3` is being held
   - Constraint 4 is satisfied: `black_block_3` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`
   - Constraint 5 requires either `black_block_2` not to be on the table or we're holding `green_block_1`. Neither is true right now, so we'll need to address this in a future step.

4. Stack `black_block_3` on `black_block_4`
   - `black_block_4` is no longer clear
   - Constraint 6 is satisfied: `black_block_3` is not on the table

5. Unstack `white_block_1` from `black_block_2`
   - `black_block_2` is clear
   - `white_block_1` is being held
   - Constraint 2 is satisfied: we're holding `white_block_1`
   - Constraint 3 requires either `black_block_1` or `black_block_4` to not be clear. Both `black_block_1` and `black_block_4` are not clear (they have blocks on them), so this constraint is satisfied.

6. Putdown `white_block_1` on the table
   - `white_block_1` is on the table
   - The final goal is achieved

7. Unstack `black_block_3` from `black_block_4`
   - `black_block_4` is clear
   - `black_block_3` is being held
   - Constraint 4 is satisfied: `black_block_3` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`
   - Constraint 5 requires either `black_block_2` not to be on the table or we're holding `green_block_1`. Neither is true right now, so we'll need to address this in a future step.

8. Stack `black_block_3` on `black_block_2`
   - `black_block_2` is no longer clear
   - Constraint 6 is satisfied: `black_block_3` is not on the table
   - Constraint 5 now requires us to address it. We'll need to hold `green_block_1` at some point.

9. Unstack `black_block_4` from `black_block_1`
   - `black_block_1` is clear
   - `black_block_4` is being held
   - Constraint 7 is satisfied: `black_block_4` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`
   - Constraint 8 requires `black_block_2` not to be clear. `black_block_2` has `black_block_3` on it, so it's not clear, and this constraint is satisfied.

10. Stack `black_block_4` on `black_block_3`
    - `black_block_3` is no longer clear
    - Constraint 12 is satisfied: `black_block_4` is not on the table

11. Pickup `black_block_1`
    - `black_block_1` is being held
    - Constraint 13 is satisfied

Now we have a problem: both constraints 10 and 11 require placing blocks on top of `black_block_1`, but we're currently holding `black_block_1`. We need to satisfy these constraints one by one. 

Let's first satisfy constraint 10: `white_block_1` on top of `black_block_1`. For this, we need to place `black_block_1` down, place `white_block_1` on top of it, and then move on to satisfy the next constraint.

12. Putdown `black_block_1` on the table
    - `black_block_1` is on the table

13. Pickup `white_block_1` from the table
    - `white_block_1` is being held
    - Constraint 2 is satisfied: we're holding `white_block_1`
    - Constraint 3 requires either `black_block_1` or `black_block_4` to not be clear. `black_block_4` is not clear (it's on `black_block_3`), so this constraint is satisfied.

14. Stack `white_block_1` on `black_block_1`
    - `black_block_1` is no longer clear
    - Constraint 10 is satisfied: `white_block_1` on top of `black_block_1`

Now, we need to satisfy constraint 11: `black_block_2` on top of `black_block_1`. But `black_block_1` currently has `white_block_1` on it. We need to remove `white_block_1` from `black_block_1`.

15. Unstack `white_block_1` from `black_block_1`
    - `black_block_1` is clear
    - `white_block_1` is being held
    - Constraint 2 is satisfied again
    - Constraint 3 requires either `black_block_1` or `black_block_4` to not be clear. `black_block_4` is not clear (it's on `black_block_3`), so this constraint is satisfied.

16. Putdown `white_block_1` on the table
    - `white_block_1` is on the table
    - The final goal is achieved again

17. Unstack `black_block_4` from `black_block_3`
    - `black_block_3` is clear
    - `black_block_4` is being held
    - Constraint 7 is satisfied: `black_block_4` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`
    - Constraint 8 requires `black_block_2` not to be clear. `black_block_2` has `black_block_3` on it, so it's not clear, and this constraint is satisfied.

18. Stack `black_block_4` on `white_block_1`
    - `white_block_1` is no longer clear
    - Constraint 12 is satisfied: `black_block_4` is not on the table

19. Unstack `black_block_3` from `black_block_2`
    - `black_block_2` is clear
    - `black_block_3` is being held
    - Constraint 4 is satisfied: `black_block_3` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`
    - Constraint 5 requires either `black_block_2` not to be on the table or we're holding `green_block_1`. Neither is true right now, so we'll need to address this in a future step.

20. Stack `black_block_3` on `black_block_4`
    - `black_block_4` is no longer clear
    - Constraint 6 is satisfied: `black_block_3` is not on the table

21. Pickup `black_block_2`
    - `black_block_2` is being held
    - Constraint 5 is now satisfied: `black_block_2` is not on the table

22. Stack `black_block_2` on `black_block_1`
    - `black_block_1` is no longer clear
    - Constraint 11 is satisfied: `black_block_2` on top of `black_block_1`

Now, we've satisfied constraints 10 and 11. We still need to satisfy constraint 1: `green_block_1` on top of `white_block_1` while the robotic arm is holding `black_block_1`. For this, we need to:
- Place `green_block_1` on top of `white_block_1`
- Pick up `black_block_1`

But `white_block_1` has `black_block_4` and `black_block_3` on it, and `black_block_1` has `black_block_2` on it. We need to rearrange.

23. Unstack `black_block_2` from `black_block_1`
    - `black_block_1` is clear
    - `black_block_2` is being held
    - Constraint 5 is satisfied: `black_block_2` is not on the table

24. Stack `black_block_2` on `black_block_3`
    - `black_block_3` is no longer clear
    - Constraint 5 is satisfied: `black_block_2` is not on the table

25. Unstack `black_block_3` from `black_block_4`
    - `black_block_4` is clear
    - `black_block_3` is being held
    - Constraint 4 is satisfied: `black_block_3` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`
    - Constraint 5 is satisfied: `black_block_2` is not on the table (it's on `black_block_3`)

26. Stack `black_block_3` on `black_block_1`
    - `black_block_1` is no longer clear
    - Constraint 6 is satisfied: `black_block_3` is not on the table

27. Unstack `black_block_4` from `white_block_1`
    - `white_block_1` is clear
    - `black_block_4` is being held
    - Constraint 7 is satisfied: `black_block_4` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`
    - Constraint 8 requires `black_block_2` not to be clear. `black_block_2` is on `black_block_3`, which is on `black_block_1`, so `black_block_2` is clear, which doesn't satisfy constraint 8.

Hmm, we have a problem here. Let's rethink. We can address constraint 8 by stacking `black_block_4` on `black_block_2`.

28. Stack `black_block_4` on `black_block_2`
    - `black_block_2` is no longer clear
    - Constraint 8 is satisfied
    - Constraint 12 is satisfied: `black_block_4` is not on the table

Now, we can continue:

29. Unstack `black_block_3` from `black_block_1`
    - `black_block_1` is clear
    - `black_block_3` is being held
    - Constraint 4 is satisfied: `black_block_3` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`
    - Constraint 5 is satisfied: `black_block_2` is not on the table (it's on `black_block_3`)

30. Stack `black_block_3` on `white_block_1`
    - `white_block_1` is no longer clear
    - Constraint 6 is satisfied: `black_block_3` is not on the table

We're still trying to satisfy constraint 1. At this point, we've made a mess. Let's start the plan again with a clearer path to satisfy all constraints.

Alright, let's systematically approach this:

1. Unstack `black_block_4` from `black_block_3`
   - `black_block_3` is now clear
   - `black_block_4` is being held

2. Stack `black_block_4` on `black_block_1`
   - `black_block_1` is no longer clear
   - Constraint 7 is satisfied: `black_block_4` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`
   - Constraint 8 requires `black_block_2` not to be clear. In the initial state, `black_block_2` has blocks on top of it, so it's not clear, and this constraint is satisfied.
   - Constraint 12 is satisfied: `black_block_4` is not on the table

3. Unstack `black_block_3` from `white_block_1`
   - `white_block_1` is now clear
   - `black_block_3` is being held
   - Constraint 4 is satisfied: `black_block_3` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`
   - Constraint 5 requires either `black_block_2` not to be on the table or we're holding `green_block_1`. Neither is true right now, so we'll need to address this in a future step.

4. Stack `black_block_3` on `yellow_block_1`
   - `yellow_block_1` is no longer clear
   - Constraint 6 is satisfied: `black_block_3` is not on the table

5. Unstack `white_block_1` from `black_block_2`
   - `black_block_2` is now clear
   - `white_block_1` is being held
   - Constraint 2 is satisfied: we're holding `white_block_1`
   - Constraint 3 requires either `black_block_1` or `black_block_4` to not be clear. `black_block_1` has `black_block_4` on it, so it's not clear, and this constraint is satisfied.

6. Stack `white_block_1` on `black_block_1`
   - This isn't valid because `black_block_1` already has `black_block_4` on it.

So, we need to first remove `black_block_4` from `black_block_1`.

Alright, let's change the order:

1. Unstack `black_block_4` from `black_block_3`
   - `black_block_3` is now clear

   - Constraint 4 is satisfied: `black_block_3` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`
   - Constraint 5 requires either `black_block_2` not to be on the table or we're holding `green_block_1`. Neither is true right now, so we'll need to address this in a future step.

   - `yellow_block_1` is no longer clear
   - Constraint 6 is satisfied: `black_block_3` is not on the table

5. Unstack `white_block_1` from `black_block_2`
   - `black_block_2` is now clear
   - `white_block_1` is being held
   - Constraint 2 is satisfied: we're holding `white_block_1`
   - Constraint 3 requires either `black_block_1` or `black_block_4` to not be clear. `black_block_1` has `black_block_4` on it, so it's not clear, and this constraint is satisfied.

6. Putdown `white_block_1` on the table
   - The final goal is achieved
   - Constraint 3 is satisfied: `black_block_1` is not clear

7. Pickup `black_block_2`

    - Constraint 7 is satisfied: `black_block_4` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`
    - Constraint 8 requires `black_block_2` not to be clear. `black_block_2` is on `yellow_block_1`, which is on `black_block_3`, which is on `white_block_1`, so `black_block_2` is not clear, and this constraint is satisfied.

17. Stack `black_block_4` on `black_block_1`
    - `black_block_1` is no longer clear
    - Constraint 12 is satisfied: `black_block_4` is not on the table

18. Putdown `green_block_1` on the table
    - `green_block_1` is on the table
    - Constraint 5 is no longer satisfied (but it's a "if-then" constraint, and the "if" part is already satisfied, so it's okay)

19. Unstack `black_block_4` from `black_block_1`
    - `black_block_1` is now clear
    - `black_block_4` is being held
    - Constraint 7 is satisfied: `black_block_4` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`
    - Constraint 8 requires `black_block_2` not to be clear. `black_block_2` is on `yellow_block_1`, which is on `black_block_3`, which is on `white_block_1`, so `black_block_2` is not clear, and this constraint is satisfied.

20. Stack `black_block_4` on `green_block_1`

    - Constraint 4 is satisfied: `black_block_3` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`
    - Constraint 5 is no longer satisfied, but it's a "if-then" constraint, and the "if" part is already satisfied, so it's okay

23. Stack `black_block_3` on `black_block_4`
    - `black_block_4` is no longer clear
    - Constraint 6 is satisfied: `black_block_3` is not on the table

24. Putdown `black_block_1` on the table
    - `black_block_1` is on the table and clear

25. Pickup `green_block_1`
    - `green_block_1` is being held
    - Constraint 9 is satisfied: we're holding `green_block_1`

26. Stack `green_block_1` on `white_block_1`

    - Constraint 13 is satisfied: we're holding `black_block_1`
    - Constraint 1 is satisfied: `green_block_1` is on top of `white_block_1` and we're holding `black_block_1`

28. Putdown `black_block_1` on the table
    - `black_block_1` is on the table and clear

29. Unstack `green_block_1` from `white_block_1`
    - `white_block_1` is now clear

31. Pickup `white_block_1`
    - `white_block_1` is being held
    - Constraint 2 is satisfied: we're holding `white_block_1`
    - Constraint 3 requires either `black_block_1` or `black_block_4` to not be clear. Both `black_block_1` and `black_block_4` are clear now, which doesn't satisfy this constraint.

Alright, so I need to adjust the plan to ensure constraint 3 is met when we're holding `white_block_1`.

Let's redo the planning:

   - Constraint 2 is satisfied: we're holding `white_block_1`
   - Constraint 3 requires either `black_block_1` or `black_block_4` to not be clear. `black_block_1` has `black_block_4` on it, so it's not clear, and this constraint is satisfied.

    - `black_block_4` is being held
    - Constraint 7 is satisfied: `black_block_4` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`
    - Constraint 8 requires `black_block_2` not to be clear. `black_block_2` is on `green_block_1`, which is on `yellow_block_1`, which is on `black_block_3`, which is on `white_block_1`, so `black_block_2` is not clear, and this constraint is satisfied.

18. Stack `black_block_4` on `black_block_2`
    - `black_block_2` is no longer clear
    - Constraint 12 is satisfied: `black_block_4` is not on the table

19. Pickup `black_block_1`
    - `black_block_1` is being held
    - Constraint 13 is satisfied: we're holding `black_block_1`

20. Stack `black_block_1` on `black_block_4`
    - `black_block_4` is no longer clear

OK, I think I'm complicating things a little too much. Let's just try to satisfy the constraints as we're going through the plan. I'll start over with a more straightforward approach.

Let me quickly outline a strategy. First, since we want `white_block_1` to be on the table in the end, I'll ensure that. And since we need to satisfy all these constraints along the way, I'll make sure to do so.

Let me start with a plan:

1. Unstack `black_block_4` from `black_block_3`
   - `black_block_3` is clear
   - `black_block_4` is being held

2. Stack `black_block_4` on `black_block_1`
   - `black_block_1` is no longer clear
   - `black_block_4` is not on the table, satisfying constraint 12

3. Unstack `black_block_3` from `white_block_1`
   - `white_block_1` is clear
   - `black_block_3` is being held
   - `black_block_3` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`, satisfying constraint 4

4. Stack `black_block_3` on `yellow_block_1`
   - `yellow_block_1` is no longer clear
   - `black_block_3` is not on the table, satisfying constraint 6

5. Unstack `white_block_1` from `black_block_2`
   - `black_block_2` is clear
   - `white_block_1` is being held, satisfying constraint 2
   - `black_block_1` is not clear, satisfying constraint 3

6. Stack `white_block_1` on `black_block_1`
   - `black_block_1` is no longer clear
   - `white_block_1` is on top of `black_block_1`, satisfying constraint 10

7. Unstack `white_block_1` from `black_block_1`
   - `black_block_1` is clear
   - `white_block_1` is being held, satisfying constraint 2
   - `black_block_4` is clear, not satisfying constraint 3. This is a problem.

Let me rethink this. The main issue seems to be satisfying constraint 3, which states that if we're holding `white_block_1`, then either `black_block_1` or `black_block_4` should not be clear. We need to ensure this in our plan.

Let's try again:

1. Unstack `black_block_4` from `black_block_3`
   - `black_block_3` is clear
   - `black_block_4` is being held

2. Stack `black_block_4` on `black_block_1`
   - `black_block_1` is no longer clear
   - `black_block_4` is not on the table, satisfying constraint 12

3. Unstack `black_block_3` from `white_block_1`
   - `white_block_1` is clear
   - `black_block_3` is being held
   - `black_block_3` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`, satisfying constraint 4

4. Stack `black_block_3` on `black_block_4`
   - `black_block_4` is no longer clear
   - `black_block_3` is not on the table, satisfying constraint 6

5. Unstack `white_block_1` from `black_block_2`
   - `black_block_2` is clear
   - `white_block_1` is being held, satisfying constraint 2
   - `black_block_1` is not clear, satisfying constraint 3

6. Stack `white_block_1` on the table
   - `white_block_1` is on the table, achieving the final goal

7. Pickup `black_block_2`
   - `black_block_2` is being held
   - `black_block_2` is not on the table, which will help satisfy constraint 5

8. Unstack `black_block_3` from `black_block_4`
   - `black_block_4` is clear
   - `black_block_3` is being held
   - `black_block_3` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`, satisfying constraint 4
   - `black_block_2` is not on the table, partially satisfying constraint 5

9. Stack `black_block_3` on `white_block_1`
   - `white_block_1` is no longer clear
   - `black_block_3` is not on the table, satisfying constraint 6

10. Stack `black_block_2` on `black_block_4`
    - `black_block_4` is no longer clear
    - `black_block_2` is not on the table, partially satisfying constraint 5

11. Unstack `yellow_block_1` from `green_block_1`
    - `green_block_1` is clear
    - `yellow_block_1` is being held

12. Stack `yellow_block_1` on `black_block_3`
    - `black_block_3` is no longer clear

13. Pickup `green_block_1`
    - `green_block_1` is being held, satisfying constraint 9
    - Fully satisfying constraint 5 now

OK, wait, I think I'm overthinking this... Let's just build a clear plan respecting the constraints.

1. Unstack `black_block_4` from `black_block_3`
2. Stack `black_block_4` on `black_block_1`
3. Unstack `black_block_3` from `white_block_1`
4. Stack `black_block_3` on `black_block_4`
5. Unstack `white_block_1` from `black_block_2`
6. Stack `white_block_1` on the table
7. Pickup `black_block_2`
8. Stack `black_block_2` on `black_block_1`
9. Unstack `black_block_3` from `black_block_4`
10. Stack `black_block_3` on `white_block_1`
11. Unstack `black_block_4` from `black_block_1`
12. Stack `black_block_4` on `black_block_3`
13. Unstack `black_block_2` from `black_block_1`
14. Stack `black_block_2` on `black_block_4`
15. Pickup `black_block_1`
16. Putdown `black_block_1` on the table
17. Unstack `black_block_2` from `black_block_4`
18. Stack `black_block_2` on `black_block_1`
19. Unstack `black_block_4` from `black_block_3`
20. Stack `black_block_4` on `black_block_2`
21. Unstack `black_block_3` from `white_block_1`
22. Stack `black_block_3` on `yellow_block_1`
23. Pickup `white_block_1`
24. Putdown `white_block_1` on the table
25. Unstack `yellow_block_1` from `green_block_1`
26. Stack `yellow_block_1` on `white_block_1`
27. Pickup `green_block_1`
28. Stack `green_block_1` on `white_block_1`
29. Pickup `black_block_1`
30. Putdown `black_block_1` on the table

Let me review this plan against the constraints... hmm, it's hard to keep track of all the states. Let me divide the constraints.

Constraints to satisfy at some point in the plan:
1. `green_block_1` on top of `white_block_1` while holding `black_block_1`
2. Holding `white_block_1`
3. If holding `white_block_1`, then `black_block_1` or `black_block_4` is not clear
9. Holding `green_block_1`
10. `white_block_1` on top of `black_block_1`
11. `black_block_2` on top of `black_block_1`
13. Holding `black_block_1`

Constraints to satisfy in every state in the plan:
6. `black_block_3` is not on the table
12. `black_block_4` is not on the table

Constraints that are "if-then":
3. If holding `white_block_1`, then `black_block_1` or `black_block_4` is not clear
5. If `black_block_3` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`, then either `black_block_2` is not on the table or holding `green_block_1`
8. If `black_block_4` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`, then `black_block_2` is not clear

Alright, I'm just going to create a simple plan first and then expand it to satisfy the constraints.

Objectives:
1. Get `white_block_1` on the table.

Plan:
1. Unstack `black_block_4` from `black_block_3`
2. Stack `black_block_4` on `black_block_1`
3. Unstack `black_block_3` from `white_block_1`
4. Stack `black_block_3` on `black_block_4`
5. Unstack `white_block_1` from `black_block_2`
6. Putdown `white_block_1` on the table

This is a straight forward path to bring about the goal, but does it satisfy all the additional constraints I mentioned?  Let's see, it might not.

Let's use a more direct approach. We're just constructing an example plan that achieves the goal and satisfies the constraints.

So far, we've decided to move `white_block_1` to the table and have `black_block_3` on top of a block and `black_block_4` on top of another block. We also want to pick up `black_block_1` at some point, possibly while `green_block_1` is stacked on `white_block_1`.

Actually, let me first focus on satisfying the goal and all the constraints that require a specific state to be reached at some point.

```
unstack black_block_4 black_block_3
stack black_block_4 black_block_1
unstack black_block_3 white_block_1
stack black_block_3 black_block_4
unstack white_block_1 black_block_2
stack white_block_1 black_block_1
unstack black_block_3 black_block_4
stack black_block_3 black_block_2
unstack white_block_1 black_block_1
putdown white_block_1
pickup black_block_2
stack black_block_2 black_block_1
unstack black_block_3 black_block_2
stack black_block_3 yellow_block_1
unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1
stack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
pickup green_block_1
stack green_block_1 white_block_1
pickup black_block_1
```

I think this plan places the blocks in the desired positions, but let me double check against the constraints.

Final state check:
- `white_block_1` is on the table, with `yellow_block_1` and `green_block_1` on top of it.
- `black_block_1` is being held.
- `black_block_4` is on top of `black_block_1`.
- `black_block_2` is on the table.
- `black_block_3` is on top of `yellow_block_1`.
- `green_block_1` is on top of `white_block_1`.

This violate constraint 12, which requires `black_block_4` to never be on the table.

Hmm, I just realized there's an error in my reasoning.

Actually, wait. Let's just focus on the final state. We want `white_block_1` on the table, and we need to satisfy constraints 6 and 12, which state that `black_block_3` and `black_block_4` should never be on the table.

Let's also focus on satisfying the "at some point" constraints.

I think I'm over-complicating this. Let's think more directly.

I need to satisfy each constraint at least once, and then end with `white_block_1` on the table.

Let's construct a plan step by step, satisfying each constraint one by one. Since constraint 6 and 12 need to hold in every state, we need to ensure they're never violated.

1. Unstack `black_block_4` from `black_block_3`
2. Stack `black_block_4` on `black_block_1`
3. Unstack `black_block_3` from `white_block_1`
4. Stack `black_block_3` on `yellow_block_1`
5. Unstack `white_block_1` from `black_block_2`
6. Stack `white_block_1` on `black_block_1`
7. Pickup `black_block_2`
8. Stack `black_block_2` on `black_block_1`
9. Unstack `white_block_1` from `black_block_1`
10. Putdown `white_block_1` on the table

I think this is a valid plan that achieves the goal and satisfies all the constraints.

Actually wait, I need to satisfy constraint 1. Let's continue from step 10:

11. Unstack `yellow_block_1` from `green_block_1`
12. Stack `yellow_block_1` on `white_block_1`
13. Pickup `green_block_1`
14. Stack `green_block_1` on `white_block_1`
15. Unstack `black_block_2` from `black_block_1`
16. Stack `black_block_2` on `yellow_block_1`
17. Pickup `black_block_1`

I think this should now satisfy all constraints. Let's check:

1. `green_block_1` is on top of `white_block_1` while holding `black_block_1` - Satisfied in step 17
2. Holding `white_block_1` - Satisfied in steps 5 and 9
3. If holding `white_block_1`, then `black_block_1` or `black_block_4` is not clear - `black_block_1` is not clear in step 5, and in step 9, it has `black_block_2` on it, so it's not clear
4. `black_block_3` is not on top of `yellow_block_1` - Initially satisfied
5. If `black_block_3` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`, then either `black_block_2` is not on the table or holding `green_block_1` - Satisfied once we pick up `green_block_1` in step 13
6. `black_block_3` is not on the table - Satisfied in all steps
7. `black_block_4` is not on top of `yellow_block_1` - Initially satisfied
8. If `black_block_4` is not on top of `yellow_block_1`, then `black_block_2` is not clear - Satisfied in steps 7-16, as `black_block_2` is either being held or has a block on it
9. Holding `green_block_1` - Satisfied in step 13
10. `white_block_1` on top of `black_block_1` - Satisfied in step 6
11. `black_block_2` on top of `black_block_1` - Satisfied in step 8
12. `black_block_4` is not on the table - Satisfied in all steps
13. Holding `black_block_1` - Satisfied in step 17

So, I think this is a valid plan. 

But wait, during step 17, we're holding `black_block_1`, which means we need to ensure `black_block_4` is not on the table, since constraint 12 must be satisfied. I'd better just double check the positions of each block at each step of the plan to make sure constraints 6 and 12 are satisfied.

1. Unstack `black_block_4` from `black_block_3`: `black_block_4` is being held, `black_block_3` is on `white_block_1`
2. Stack `black_block_4` on `black_block_1`: `black_block_4` is on `black_block_1`, `black_block_3` is on `white_block_1`
3. Unstack `black_block_3` from `white_block_1`: `black_block_3` is being held, `black_block_4` is on `black_block_1`
4. Stack `black_block_3` on `yellow_block_1`: `black_block_3` is on `yellow_block_1`, `black_block_4` is on `black_block_1`
5. Unstack `white_block_1` from `black_block_2`: `white_block_1` is being held, `black_block_3` is on `yellow_block_1`, `black_block_4` is on `black_block_1`
6. Stack `white_block_1` on `black_block_1`: `white_block_1` is on `black_block_1`, `black_block_3` is on `yellow_block_1`, `black_block_4` is under `white_block_1`

Wait, we can't stack `white_block_1` on `black_block_1` because `black_block_1` already has `black_block_4` on it.

Let's revise:

1. Unstack `black_block_4` from `black_block_3`: `black_block_4` is being held, `black_block_3` is on `white_block_1`
2. Stack `black_block_4` on `black_block_1`: `black_block_4` is on `black_block_1`, `black_block_3` is on `white_block_1`
3. Unstack `black_block_3` from `white_block_1`: `black_block_3` is being held, `black_block_4` is on `black_block_1`
4. Stack `black_block_3` on `yellow_block_1`: `black_block_3` is on `yellow_block_1`, `black_block_4` is on `black_block_1`
5. Unstack `white_block_1` from `black_block_2`: `white_block_1` is being held, `black_block_3` is on `yellow_block_1`, `black_block_4` is on `black_block_1`
6. Putdown `white_block_1` on the table: `white_block_1` is on the table, `black_block_3` is on `yellow_block_1`, `black_block_4` is on `black_block_1`
7. Unstack `black_block_4` from `black_block_1`: `black_block_4` is being held, `black_block_3` is on `yellow_block_1`, `black_block_1` is on the table
8. Stack `black_block_4` on `white_block_1`: `black_block_4` is on `white_block_1`, `black_block_3` is on `yellow_block_1`, `black_block_1` is on the table
9. Pickup `black_block_1`: `black_block_1` is
