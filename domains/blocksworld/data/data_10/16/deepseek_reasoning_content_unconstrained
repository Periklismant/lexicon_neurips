Okay, let's see. I need to figure out a plan to get the white_block_1 onto the table. Let's start by understanding the initial state.

In the initial state, white_block_1 is under black_block_3 and black_block_4. The stack goes black_block_2 -> white_block_1 -> black_block_3 -> black_block_4. Since black_block_4 is on top and clear, I need to unstack that first. But to unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3, I need to pick it up. So the first action would be unstack black_block_4 black_block_3. Then, I have to put it down somewhere. But wait, after unstacking, I'm holding black_block_4. Then I can put it down on the table with putdown black_block_4.

Now, black_block_3 is clear. Next, I need to unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1. So unstack black_block_3 white_block_1, then put it down. Once that's done, white_block_1 is clear and on top of black_block_2. So I can unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2. Wait, but the goal is to have white_block_1 on the table. So after unstacking white_block_1, I just need to put it down. But wait, when I unstack, I have to hold it. So the steps would be: unstack white_block_1 black_block_2, then putdown white_block_1. But wait, in the initial state, white_block_1 is under black_block_3 and black_block_4. So first, I need to remove the blocks above it. So the correct order would be:

1. Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3. Then put it down.
2. Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1. Put it down.
3. Now, white_block_1 is clear. Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2 and put it down.

Wait, but the initial state of white_block_1 is on black_block_2. So the stack is black_block_2 (on table) with white_block_1 on it, then black_block_3, then black_block_4. So the steps would involve removing the upper blocks first.

So the plan steps:

- Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3. Then put it down.
- Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1. Then put it down.
- Now white_block_1 is clear. So unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2 and put it down.

That should do it. Let me check the preconditions each time.

First action: unstack black_block_4 black_block_3. Preconditions: black_block_4 is on black_block_3, black_block_4 is clear, and the arm is empty. In the initial state, black_block_4 is on top of black_block_3, and it's clear. So that's okay. After unstacking, the arm holds black_block_4. Then putdown black_block_4. That's allowed because the arm is holding it. Then black_block_3 is now clear.

Second action: unstack black_block_3 white_block_1. Wait, no, black_block_3 is on white_block_1. Wait, initial state: white_block_1 is on black_block_2, then black_block_3 is on white_block_1, then black_block_4 on top. So after removing black_block_4, black_block_3 is on white_block_1. So next, unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1. Preconditions: black_block_3 is on white_block_1, black_block_3 is clear (which it is after we put down black_block_4), and arm is empty. So yes. Then putdown black_block_3. Now, white_block_1 is clear. Then unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2. Preconditions: white_block_1 is on black_block_2, white_block_1 is clear, arm is empty. So unstack white_block_1 black_block_2. Then putdown white_block_1. That achieves the goal.

So the plan would be:

unstack black_block_4 black_block_3
putdown black_block_4
unstack black_block_3 white_block_1
putdown black_block_3
unstack white_block_1 black_block_2
putdown white_block_1

Wait, but wait, after unstacking white_block_1, we need to put it down. But the action after unstack is that we are holding the block, so putdown is needed. But in this case, when we unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2, we are holding it, then putdown white_block_1 would place it on the table, which is the goal.

Yes, that seems correct. Let me check the constraints. Each action's preconditions must be met. Let's go step by step.

Initial state: arm is empty.

1. unstack black_block_4 black_block_3: black_block_4 is on black_block_3, clear, and arm is empty. Correct. After this, arm holds black_block_4.

2. putdown black_block_4: arm is holding it, so allowed. After this, black_block_4 is on table, arm is empty.

3. unstack black_block_3 white_block_1: black_block_3 is on white_block_1, which is now clear (since black_block_3 was on top, but after we removed black_block_4, black_block_3 is clear). Wait, after putting down black_block_4, black_block_3 is still on white_block_1. So black_block_3 is clear? Yes, because there's nothing on top of it. So unstacking is allowed. Then arm holds black_block_3.

4. putdown black_block_3: places it on table. Now, white_block_1 is clear (since black_block_3 was removed). So white_block_1 is on black_block_2, and clear.

5. unstack white_block_1 black_block_2: white_block_1 is on black_block_2, clear, arm is empty. Correct. Now arm holds white_block_1.

6. putdown white_block_1: places it on the table. Goal achieved.

That seems to work. Each action's preconditions are met. The constraints are satisfied, and the plan is optimal because it's the minimal steps needed. Each step is necessary. There's no shorter way because each block above white_block_1 has to be moved first. So this should be the optimal plan.
