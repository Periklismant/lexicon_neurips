Alright, so I have a planning problem in the Blocksworld domain. Let me first understand the initial state and goal state, and then plan the actions needed to reach the goal state.

**Initial State:**
- `green_block_1` is on the table
- `black_block_1` is on the table and clear
- `black_block_2` is on the table
- `yellow_block_1` is on top of `green_block_1` and clear
- `white_block_1` is on top of `black_block_2`
- `black_block_3` is on top of `white_block_1`
- `black_block_4` is on top of `black_block_3` and clear
- The arm is empty (not holding any block)

So the initial state can be depicted as:
```
   yellow_block_1    black_block_4    black_block_1
       |                  |
   green_block_1      black_block_3
                          |
                      white_block_1
                          |
                      black_block_2

**Goal State:**
- `white_block_1` is on the table

To achieve this, we need to:
1. Get `white_block_1` onto the table

But `white_block_1` is currently beneath `black_block_3` and `black_block_4`. So, we need to first remove these blocks from on top of `white_block_1`.

Let's plan the sequence of actions:

1. Unstack `black_block_4` from `black_block_3`
2. Putdown `black_block_4` on the table
3. Unstack `black_block_3` from `white_block_1`
4. Putdown `black_block_3` on the table
5. Unstack `white_block_1` from `black_block_2`
6. Putdown `white_block_1` on the table

Let's verify this plan against the given preconditions and effects:

1. Unstack `black_block_4` from `black_block_3`:
   - Preconditions:
      - `black_block_4` is on top of `black_block_3` (satisfied)
      - `black_block_4` is clear (satisfied)
      - Arm is empty (satisfied)
   - Effects:
      - `black_block_4` is no longer on top of `black_block_3`
      - `black_block_3` is clear
      - Arm is holding `black_block_4`

2. Putdown `black_block_4` on the table:
   - Preconditions:
      - Arm is holding `black_block_4` (satisfied after step 1)
   - Effects:
      - `black_block_4` is on the table
      - `black_block_4` is clear
      - Arm is empty

3. Unstack `black_block_3` from `white_block_1`:
   - Preconditions:
      - `black_block_3` is on top of `white_block_1` (satisfied)
      - `black_block_3` is clear (satisfied after step 1)
      - Arm is empty (satisfied after step 2)
   - Effects:
      - `black_block_3` is no longer on top of `white_block_1`
      - `white_block_1` is clear
      - Arm is holding `black_block_3`

4. Putdown `black_block_3` on the table:
   - Preconditions:
      - Arm is holding `black_block_3` (satisfied after step 3)
   - Effects:
      - `black_block_3` is on the table
      - `black_block_3` is clear
      - Arm is empty

5. Unstack `white_block_1` from `black_block_2`:
   - Preconditions:
      - `white_block_1` is on top of `black_block_2` (satisfied)
      - `white_block_1` is clear (satisfied after step 3)
      - Arm is empty (satisfied after step 4)
   - Effects:
      - `white_block_1` is no longer on top of `black_block_2`
      - `black_block_2` is clear
      - Arm is holding `white_block_1`

6. Putdown `white_block_1` on the table:
   - Preconditions:
      - Arm is holding `white_block_1` (satisfied after step 5)
   - Effects:
      - `white_block_1` is on the table
      - `white_block_1` is clear
      - Arm is empty

After step 6, `white_block_1` is on the table, which is our goal state. So, this plan should be valid and optimal.

To summarize, the plan is:
```
unstack black_block_4 black_block_3
putdown black_block_4
unstack black_block_3 white_block_1
putdown black_block_3
unstack white_block_1 black_block_2
putdown white_block_1
```

This plan consists of 6 actions and is optimal for the given problem. We're now ready to provide the solution.
