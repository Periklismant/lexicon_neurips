Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get white_block_1 onto the table, but there are a bunch of constraints we need to satisfy along the way. First, I need to understand the initial state and all the constraints to make sure the plan I come up with meets all of them.

Starting with the initial state:

- green_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top of it, and yellow_block_1 is clear.
- black_block_1 is on the table and clear.
- black_block_2 is on the table with white_block_1 on top, then black_block_3, then black_block_4. So the stack is black_block_2 (table) → white_block_1 → black_block_3 → black_block_4, and black_block_4 is clear.
- The robot isn't holding anything.

The goal is to have white_block_1 on the table. So, currently, white_block_1 is part of a stack. To get it on the table, we need to unstack the blocks above it and then move it down. But since white_block_1 is under black_block_3 and black_block_4, we need to unstack those first.

Constraints to consider:

1. At some state, "green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" and the robot is holding black_block_1. So we need to stack green on white and have black_block_1 in hand at some point.

2. At some state, the robot is holding white_block_1. That will naturally happen when we unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2 after removing the blocks above it.

3. Whenever the robot is holding white_block_1, either black_block_1 has a block on top or black_block_4 is not clear. So during the time we hold white_block_1, one of these must be true either then or later.

4. At some state, black_block_3 is not on yellow_block_1. Since initially, black_block_3 is on white_block_1, which is on black_block_2, that's already true. But maybe this constraint is already satisfied? Wait, no, because the initial position of black_block_3 is on white_block_1, which is on black_block_2, not yellow. So maybe this constraint is already met in the initial state. But the problem says it must hold in at least one state. If it's already true, then maybe we don't need to do anything. But the next constraint says that if black_block_3 is not on yellow_block_1 in state s, then either black_block_2 is not on the table or the robot is holding green_block_1 in s or after. Since black_block_2 is on the table initially, and if the first constraint is already met (black_block_3 not on yellow), then we need to ensure that after that state, either black_block_2 is moved (not on table) or green is held.

But maybe we need to make sure that after some state where black_block_3 isn't on yellow, we have either black_block_2 not on table or holding green. So perhaps moving black_block_2 or picking up green_block_1.

Another constraint: black_block_3 must never be on the table. So we can't putdown black_block_3. Similarly, black_block_4 can't be on the table either. So when we unstack them, we have to stack them somewhere else.

Also, the robot must hold green_block_1 at some point. And white_block_1 must be on top of black_block_1 at some point. Also, black_block_2 must be on top of black_block_1 at some point. And the robot must hold black_block_1 at some point.

So, putting this all together, the plan needs to:

1. Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3. But wait, black_block_4 is on top of black_block_3. To unstack, we need to pick it up. Since black_block_4 is clear, we can unstack it. So action: unstack black_block_4 black_block_3. Then, we're holding black_block_4. But we can't put it on the table (due to constraint). So where to put it? Maybe stack it on another block. The only clear blocks initially are black_block_1, yellow_block_1, and black_block_4 (but black_block_4 is being moved). So after unstacking black_block_4, we can stack it on black_block_1, but that would make black_block_1 not clear, which might help with constraint 3.

Wait, constraint 3 says that when holding white_block_1, either black_block_1 has a block on top or black_block_4 is not clear. If we stack black_block_4 on black_block_1, then black_block_1 is not clear. So when we later hold white_block_1, this condition would be satisfied.

So after unstacking black_block_4, stack it on black_block_1.

Then, unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1. But after unstacking black_block_4, black_block_3 is clear. So unstack black_block_3 white_block_1. Now holding black_block_3. We can't put it on the table. Need to stack it somewhere. Possible options: stack on another block. Maybe stack on yellow_block_1? But yellow_block_1 is on green_block_1. So stack black_block_3 on yellow_block_1. But then, after that, we have to make sure that if black_block_3 is not on yellow_block_1 (as per constraint 4), but that's a separate constraint. Wait, constraint 4 says "black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1" must hold in at least one state. So if we stack it there, then in that state, it is on yellow, but maybe later we have to move it. Alternatively, perhaps stack it elsewhere. But if we stack it on black_block_1 (already has black_block_4?), but black_block_4 is on black_block_1. So black_block_1's top is black_block_4. To stack black_block_3 on black_block_4, we need to unstack black_block_4 first. That complicates things. Alternatively, stack black_block_3 on another block. Maybe black_block_2? But black_block_2 has white_block_1, which we need to move. Hmm.

Alternatively, stack black_block_3 on green_block_1. But green_block_1 has yellow_block_1. So stack black_block_3 on yellow_block_1. But that would make black_block_3 on yellow_block_1. Then, in that state, the constraint 4 (black_block_3 not on yellow) is not met. But the constraint requires that at least once, black_block_3 is not on yellow. So if we stack it there, then later we have to unstack it. But that's more steps. Alternatively, maybe stack it on black_block_1. Let's see: after stacking black_block_4 on black_block_1, then black_block_1 is not clear. So to stack black_block_3 on black_block_4, we need to unstack black_block_4 first. But that's not possible because we just stacked it. So perhaps stacking black_block_3 on another block. Maybe black_block_2? But black_block_2 has white_block_1. So if we unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2, then black_block_2 is clear. But we can't do that yet because there's black_block_3 and black_block_4 on top of white_block_1. Wait, we already removed black_block_4 and black_block_3. So after unstacking black_block_3, the stack is black_block_2 → white_block_1. Then, we can unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2, but we need to have the preconditions: white_block_1 is clear. But after removing black_block_3 and black_block_4, white_block_1 is clear. So perhaps:

Plan steps so far:

1. unstack black_block_4 black_block_3 → holding black_block_4
2. stack black_block_4 black_block_1 → now black_block_4 is on black_block_1, which is clear. So now, black_block_1 has black_block_4 on top, making it not clear. This helps with constraint 3 later when holding white_block_1.

Then:

3. unstack black_block_3 white_block_1 → holding black_block_3
4. Now need to stack black_block_3 somewhere. Since we can't put it on the table, maybe stack on black_block_1, but black_block_1 has black_block_4. So stack on black_block_4? Yes. So stack black_block_3 black_block_4. But wait, to stack, the target block (black_block_4) must be clear. After step 2, black_block_4 is on black_block_1 and is clear. After step 1, black_block_4 is held, then stacked on black_block_1. So after step 2, black_block_4 is on black_block_1 and clear. Then step 3: unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1. Now, we have to stack black_block_3. If we stack it on black_block_4, then black_block_4 is no longer clear. So:

4. stack black_block_3 black_block_4 → now black_block_3 is on black_block_4, which is on black_block_1. Now, black_block_4 is not clear. So that's allowed. But we have to make sure that black_block_3 is never on the table. So this is okay.

Now, the stack for black_block_1 is black_block_1 (table) → black_block_4 → black_block_3. Then, white_block_1 is on black_block_2, clear. So we can now unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2.

5. unstack white_block_1 black_block_2 → holding white_block_1. Now, according to constraint 3, during this state, either black_block_1 has a block on top (which it does: black_block_4) or black_block_4 is not clear (which it is, since black_block_3 is on it). So this satisfies constraint 3.

Now, we need to put white_block_1 on the table. So:

6. putdown white_block_1 → now white_block_1 is on the table. Goal achieved.

But wait, the goal is to have white_block_1 on the table. So that's step 6. But we also have other constraints to satisfy:

- The first constraint: green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and holding black_block_1 at some state. Currently, green_block_1 is under yellow_block_1. So to put green on white, we need to move yellow_block_1 first. Let's see.

We need to have a state where green is on white and holding black_block_1. So perhaps after step 6, we can do:

7. pickup black_block_1 → but wait, black_block_1 has blocks on top (black_block_4 and black_block_3). So we can't pickup black_block_1. Hmm. So maybe we need to unstack the blocks on top of black_block_1 first.

Wait, in step 2, we stacked black_block_4 on black_block_1. Then step 4 stacked black_block_3 on black_block_4. So the stack is black_block_1 → black_block_4 → black_block_3. To get to black_block_1, we need to unstack black_block_3 from black_block_4, then unstack black_block_4 from black_block_1. Then we can pickup black_block_1.

But that's additional steps. Let's think: maybe after step 6, we need to achieve the first constraint. Let's see.

At step 6, white_block_1 is on the table. To have green_block_1 on top of white_block_1, we need to move green_block_1. But green_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on top. So first, unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.

7. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1 → holding yellow_block_1. Then stack yellow_block_1 somewhere else. Maybe on black_block_1's stack. But black_block_1's stack is black_block_1 → black_block_4 → black_block_3. To stack on black_block_3, which is the top, we need to hold yellow and stack on black_block_3. So:

8. stack yellow_block_1 black_block_3 → now yellow is on black_block_3. Now, green_block_1 is clear. Then, we can pickup green_block_1.

9. pickup green_block_1 → holding green_block_1. Then stack it on white_block_1.

10. stack green_block_1 white_block_1 → now green is on white. At this point, the first constraint requires that in some state, green is on white and holding black_block_1. But right now, we're holding green and then stack it. So after stacking, we're not holding anything. So maybe after step 9, when holding green, we need to also hold black_block_1. But how?

Wait, the constraint is that in some state, both green is on white and the robot is holding black_block_1. But to have both conditions in the same state, we need to be holding black_block_1 while green is on white. But how?

Alternatively, maybe during the process of stacking green on white, we have a state where green is on white, and in another action, we are holding black_block_1. But the constraint requires both in the same state. So perhaps after stacking green on white, we then pick up black_block_1. But to pick up black_block_1, it must be clear. However, black_block_1 is under black_block_4 and black_block_3. So we need to unstack those first. Let's see:

After step 10, the blocks are:

- white_block_1 on table with green_block_1 on top.
- black_block_1 on table with black_block_4 on top, then black_block_3, then yellow_block_1.
- black_block_2 on table (since white_block_1 was unstacked from it).
- black_block_3 on black_block_4, which is on black_block_1.
- yellow_block_1 on black_block_3.

To pick up black_block_1, we need to unstack all blocks above it. So:

11. unstack yellow_block_1 black_block_3 → holding yellow.
12. putdown yellow_block_1 → but wait, can't putdown because black_block_3 can't be on the table. Wait, no: putdown is for the block being held. If we unstack yellow from black_block_3, then we can putdown yellow_block_1. But that's allowed. So:

12. putdown yellow_block_1 → yellow is on table. Now, black_block_3 is clear.
13. unstack black_block_3 black_block_4 → holding black_block_3.
14. stack black_block_3 somewhere. Maybe on black_block_2?
15. stack black_block_3 black_block_2 → now black_block_3 is on black_block_2. Then, unstack black_block_4 from black_block_1.
16. unstack black_block_4 black_block_1 → holding black_block_4.
17. stack black_block_4 somewhere. Maybe on black_block_2's stack (now black_block_2 → black_block_3).
18. stack black_block_4 black_block_3 → now black_block_4 is on black_block_3. Now, black_block_1 is clear. Then, pickup black_block_1.
19. pickup black_block_1 → now holding black_block_1. At this point, green is on white (from step 10), and we're holding black_block_1. So this state satisfies the first constraint.

But this is getting really long. The problem states that the plan must be optimal, i.e., as short as possible. So maybe there's a more efficient way.

Alternatively, maybe during the process of moving blocks to get white_block_1 to the table, we can satisfy some of the constraints along the way.

Let's re-examine the constraints:

- Must hold black_block_1 at some point. So we need to pick it up. But in the initial state, it's on the table and clear. So we can just pickup black_block_1 at some point. Let's say after moving some blocks.

Also, the constraint that black_block_2 must be on top of black_block_1 at some point. So we need to stack black_block_2 on black_block_1. But black_block_2 is initially on the table. So we need to pick it up and stack it on black_block_1. But black_block_2 has white_block_1 and others on top. So we have to first clear black_block_2 by moving the blocks above it.

Wait, initially, black_block_2 has white_block_1, black_block_3, black_block_4. So to clear black_block_2, we need to unstack all the blocks above white_block_1. Which we did in the earlier steps (steps 1-4). So after that, black_block_2 is clear. Then, we can pickup black_block_2 and stack it on black_block_1. But stacking black_block_2 on black_block_1 would require that black_block_1 is clear. But earlier steps stacked black_block_4 and black_block_3 on black_block_1, so we need to move those first.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline a plan that satisfies all constraints with minimal steps.

Alternative approach:

1. Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3. Then stack it on black_block_1. This makes black_block_1 not clear, which helps with constraint 3.

2. Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1. Then stack it on black_block_4 (now on black_block_1). Now, black_block_3 is on black_block_4.

3. Now, white_block_1 is clear. Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2 → holding white_block_1. At this state, constraint 2 is satisfied (holding white). Also, constraint 3: since black_block_1 has blocks on top (black_block_4 and black_block_3), so condition holds.

4. Putdown white_block_1 → achieves the goal.

Now, other constraints:

- Must have green on white and hold black_block_1 at some state. So after putting down white_block_1, perhaps:

5. Unstack green_block_1's block: yellow is on green. So unstack yellow from green.

6. Putdown yellow (since we can't have black_block_3 on table, but yellow can be put down).

7. Pickup green_block_1.

8. Stack green on white_block_1. Now, green is on white.

9. Now, need to hold black_block_1. But black_block_1 has blocks on it. So unstack black_block_3 from black_block_4.

10. Unstack black_block_3 from black_block_4 → holding black_block_3.

11. Stack black_block_3 on yellow_block_1 (which is on the table now).

12. Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_1 → holding black_block_4.

13. Stack black_block_4 on black_block_3.

14. Now, black_block_1 is clear. Pickup black_block_1 → holding it. At this point, green is on white (from step 8) and holding black_block_1. So this satisfies the first constraint.

But this adds many steps. Also, we need to satisfy the constraint that black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1. So after step 4, black_block_2 is clear. So we can:

15. Pickup black_block_2.

16. Stack black_block_2 on black_block_1. This satisfies the constraint that black_block_2 is on black_block_1.

But this is adding more steps. Also, the constraint that "black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1" must hold in at least one state. Initially, it's not. When we stack black_block_4 on black_block_3, which is on yellow (step 13), then black_block_4 is on black_block_3, which is on yellow. So black_block_4 is not on yellow. So that's already true. But if we stack it on yellow, then that's not. Wait, no: if black_block_3 is on yellow, and black_block_4 is on black_block_3, then black_block_4 is not on yellow. So the constraint is satisfied. So step 13 satisfies that.

Also, the constraint that if "black_block_4 is not on yellow" holds in a state, then there must be a block on black_block_2 in that state or after. After step 4, black_block_2 is clear. But after step 15, we stack black_block_2 on black_block_1, so black_block_2 is not on the table. So maybe that satisfies the condition.

Additionally, the constraint that "black_block_3 is not on yellow" must hold in at least one state. If in step 11, we stack black_block_3 on yellow, then in that state, black_block_3 is on yellow, so the constraint isn't met. But later, if we move it, then in some state it's not on yellow. Wait, maybe when we unstack black_block_3 from black_block_4 (step 9), and stack it on yellow (step 11), then in that state, it is on yellow. But if we later move it again, like in step 13, stacking black_block_4 on black_block_3 (which is on yellow), then black_block_3 is still on yellow. So perhaps we need to stack black_block_3 elsewhere. Alternatively, if we stack black_block_3 on a different block. For example, after unstacking black_block_3 from white_block_1 (step 2), stack it on black_block_1 (which already has black_block_4). Wait, but black_block_4 is on black_block_1, so stacking black_block_3 on black_block_4 would require that black_block_4 is clear. Which it is after step 1. Wait, step 1: unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3 → holding black_block_4. Then stack black_block_4 on black_block_1. Now, black_block_4 is on black_block_1 and clear. Then step 2: unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1 → holding black_block_3. Then stack black_block_3 on black_block_4. Now, black_block_4 is not clear. So after that, black_block_3 is on black_block_4, which is on black_block_1. So in this case, black_block_3 is not on yellow_block_1. So the constraint "black_block_3 is not on yellow" is already true in this state, satisfying constraint 4. Therefore, no need to stack it on yellow. So this way, constraint 4 is satisfied in step 2. Then, the next constraint is that if "black_block_3 is not on yellow" holds in state s, then in s or after, either black_block_2 is not on table or holding green. After step 2, black_block_2 is still on the table (since we only moved black_block_4 and black_block_3). So we need to ensure that after this state, either black_block_2 is not on table or we hold green. Since later steps involve unstacking white_block_1 from black_block_2 (step 3), which leaves black_block_2 on the table. So to satisfy the implication, we need to either move black_block_2 off the table or hold green. So after step 3, black_block_2 is still on the table. So we need to either move it or hold green. 

If we later stack black_block_2 on black_block_1 (as per another constraint), then black_block_2 is not on the table. So that would satisfy the condition. So during the plan, after the state where black_block_3 is not on yellow (which is after step 2), we eventually stack black_block_2 on black_block_1, making it not on the table. So the implication is satisfied.

Also, the constraint that "black_block_4 is not on top of yellow_block_1" must hold in at least one state. Since in the initial state, black_block_4 is on black_block_3, which is on white_block_1, which is on black_block_2. So it's not on yellow. So this constraint is already satisfied. But the problem says to provide a plan where this is true in at least one state, which it already is. However, the subsequent constraint says that if "black_block_4 is not on yellow" in state s, then there must be a block on top of black_block_2 in s or after. In the initial state, black_block_2 has white_block_1 on top. So this condition holds. So maybe this is already satisfied. But when we unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2 (step 3), then black_block_2 is clear. So after that, there's no block on black_block_2. So the implication would require that after that state, there is a block on black_block_2. But in our plan, after step 3, we put white_block_1 on the table. Then, later, when we stack black_block_2 on black_block_1, that removes it from the table. But the constraint is that if in any state s where black_block_4 is not on yellow, then in s or after, black_block_2 has a block on top. Since black_block_4 is not on yellow in the initial state, then in the initial state, black_block_2 has white_block_1 on top. So that's true. But when we remove white_block_1, black_block_2 is clear. So after that state, we need to ensure that at some point, black_block_2 has a block on top. In our plan, we later stack black_block_3 on black_block_4 (step 2: black_block_3 is stacked on black_block_4 on black_block_1). So no. Alternatively, perhaps when we stack black_block_2 on black_block_1, that makes black_block_1 have black_block_2 on top, but black_block_2 is now on black_block_1, so black_block_2 is not on the table. So the constraint is satisfied in the initial state, but after moving white_block_1, we need to ensure that black_block_2 has a block on top. Which we don't do. Hmm, this is a problem.

Wait, the constraint says: if "black_block_4 is not on yellow_block_1" holds in some state s, then "there is a block on top of black_block_2" must hold in s or after. So in the initial state, black_block_4 is not on yellow, and black_block_2 has white_block_1 on top. So that's okay. But when we unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2 (step 3), then in that state s', black_block_4 is still not on yellow. So the implication applies: in s' or after, there must be a block on black_block_2. But after s', black_block_2 is clear. So we need to stack something on black_block_2 later. But in the current plan, we don't. So this violates the constraint. Therefore, we need to ensure that after moving white_block_1 from black_block_2, we stack something on black_block_2.

So perhaps after step 3 (unstack white_block_1), we need to stack something on black_block_2.

But how? Because after step 3, we are holding white_block_1 and need to put it down. Then, after putdown, we can pick up another block to stack on black_block_2.

Alternatively, after step 3, putdown white_block_1, then pickup black_block_2 (since it's clear) and stack it on black_block_1. That would satisfy the constraint that black_block_2 is on black_block_1. But also, stacking it on black_block_1 would make black_block_2 not on the table, which satisfies the implication for the earlier constraint (black_block_3 not on yellow implies black_block_2 not on table or holding green). So this could kill two birds with one stone.

Let's adjust the plan:

1. unstack black_block_4 black_block_3 → holding black_block_4
2. stack black_block_4 black_block_1 → now black_block_4 on black_block_1
3. unstack black_block_3 white_block_1 → holding black_block_3
4. stack black_block_3 black_block_4 → now black_block_3 on black_block_4 (which is on black_block_1)
5. unstack white_block_1 black_block_2 → holding white_block_1 (satisfies constraint 2)
6. putdown white_block_1 → goal achieved
7. pickup black_block_2 → since it's clear now
8. stack black_block_2 black_block_1 → now black_block_2 is on black_block_1 (satisfies the constraint that black_block_2 is on black_block_1)
   - Now, black_block_2 is not on the table, satisfying the implication for the black_block_3 not on yellow constraint.
9. Now, need to satisfy the first constraint: green on white and holding black_block_1.

But green is currently under yellow_block_1. So:

9. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1 → holding yellow
10. putdown yellow_block_1 → on table
11. pickup green_block_1 → holding green
12. stack green_block_1 white_block_1 → now green is on white
13. Now, need to hold black_block_1. But black_block_1 has black_block_4, black_block_3, and black_block_2 on it. So we need to unstack those.

14. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1 → but black_block_2 has blocks on top? No, after step 8, black_block_2 is stacked on black_block_1, and it's clear. Because when you stack a block, the top block is clear. So black_block_2 is on black_block_1 and clear. So we can unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1.

14. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1 → holding black_block_2
15. putdown black_block_2 → now black_block_2 is on table again. But this might undo our earlier step. Alternatively, stack it elsewhere.

But this is getting too long. The optimal plan should be as short as possible. Let's see if there's a way to combine steps.

Alternative plan that satisfies all constraints:

1. unstack black_block_4 black_block_3 → holding B4
2. stack B4 B1 → B4 on B1, B1 now not clear
3. unstack B3 white_block_1 → holding B3
4. stack B3 B4 → B3 on B4, B4 not clear
5. unstack white_block_1 B2 → holding W1 (satisfies constraint 2)
6. putdown W1 → goal achieved
7. Now, need to satisfy other constraints:
   - Green on W1 and hold B1: need to move green_block_1 to W1, but currently, green has Y1 on it.
8. unstack Y1 G1 → holding Y1
9. stack Y1 B2 → B2 is clear (since W1 was removed and put down)
   - Now B2 has Y1 on top
10. pickup G1 → holding G1 (satisfies the constraint of holding G1)
11. stack G1 W1 → green on white (satisfies part of the first constraint)
12. Now, need to hold B1. But B1 has B4 and B3. So unstack B3 from B4:
13. unstack B3 B4 → holding B3
14. stack B3 Y1 → B3 on Y1 (B2 has Y1)
15. unstack B4 B1 → holding B4
16. stack B4 B3 → B4 on B3 (on Y1)
17. Now, B1 is clear. pickup B1 → holding B1 (satisfies the other part of the first constraint)
   - At this state: G1 is on W1, and holding B1. So satisfies first constraint.
   - Also, B2 has Y1 and B3 and B4, so there is a block on top of B2 (Y1). But after step 9, B2 has Y1. Then step 14 stacks B3 on Y1, which is on B2. So B2 has Y1, which has B3 and B4. So after step 14, B2 has Y1, which is not clear. So the constraint that whenever black_block_4 is not on yellow, there must be a block on B2 is satisfied.

Additionally, the constraint that black_block_2 must be on B1 at some point. But in this plan, we stacked B2 on B1 in step 8, but later removed it. Wait, no. In this alternative plan, step 8 was stacking Y1 on B2. So B2 has Y1. Then step 9 is pickup G1. So B2 is still on the table with Y1. So the constraint that black_block_2 is on B1 at some point isn't met. So we need to address that.

This is getting very complicated. Perhaps the optimal plan requires a different approach.

Let's try to outline a plan that satisfies all constraints with minimal steps:

1. Unstack B4 from B3. Stack on B1. This makes B1 not clear.
2. Unstack B3 from W1. Stack on B4.
3. Unstack W1 from B2. Putdown W1 (achieves goal).
4. Now, need to stack B2 on B1 for that constraint. But B2 is clear. So pickup B2 and stack on B1.
5. Now, B2 is on B1. Satisfies that constraint.
6. Now, need to get green on W1 and hold B1. To do that, first unstack Y1 from G1.
7. Putdown Y1 somewhere.
8. Pickup G1 and stack on W1.
9. Now, need to hold B1. To do that, unstack B2 from B1 (since B2 is on B1). Then unstack B4 and B3. But this is too many steps. Alternatively, after step 5, B1 has B2, B4, B3. So can't pick up B1. So perhaps this approach isn't working.

Alternative idea: Use the initial pickup of B1. Since B1 is clear initially, maybe pickup B1 early on to satisfy the constraint of holding it. But in the initial state, B1 is clear. So:

1. pickup B1 → holding B1. Now, can't stack yet.
   - But we need to put it down somewhere. But putting it down would just return it to the table. Maybe stack it on another block.
   - However, stacking B1 on another block would require that the target block is clear. But initially, B2 has blocks on top, G1 has Y1. So maybe stack B1 on B2? But B2 has W1, B3, B4. So no. Stack B1 on G1? G1 has Y1. So no. So perhaps this isn't helpful.

Alternatively, use B1 as a temporary storage. But this might not help.

Another approach: Since we need to have white_block_1 on the table, and to do that we need to unstack it from B2, which requires removing B3 and B4. So steps 1-4 as before. Then unstack W1 and put it down. Then, to satisfy the other constraints:

- Stack green on W1: need to move Y1 first.
- Stack B2 on B1: after unstacking W1, B2 is clear. So pickup B2 and stack on B1.
- Then, unstack Y1 from G1 and put it down, then stack G1 on W1.
- To hold B1, we need to unstack B2 from it. But after stacking B2 on B1, if we unstack it, then B1 is clear again. But that's more steps.

Let me try to write out the steps with this approach:

1. unstack B4 B3 → hold B4
2. stack B4 B1 → B4 on B1
3. unstack B3 W1 → hold B3
4. stack B3 B4 → B3 on B4
5. unstack W1 B2 → hold W1 (satisfies constraint 2)
6. putdown W1 → goal
7. pickup B2 → B2 is clear
8. stack B2 B1 → B2 on B1 (satisfies black_block_2 on B1)
9. unstack Y1 G1 → hold Y1
10. putdown Y1 → Y1 on table
11. pickup G1 → hold G1 (satisfies holding G1 constraint)
12. stack G1 W1 → G on W (satisfies green on white)
13. Now, need to hold B1 and have G on W in the same state. But after step 12, we're not holding anything. So need to pickup B1. But B1 has B4, B3, B2. So unstack B2 from B1:
13. unstack B2 B1 → hold B2
14. putdown B2 → B2 on table
15. unstack B3 B4 → hold B3
16. stack B3 B2 → B3 on B2
17. unstack B4 B1 → hold B4
18. stack B4 B3 → B4 on B3
19. pickup B1 → now holding B1. At this point, G is on W (step 12), and holding B1. So satisfies the first constraint.

This is very long. But perhaps this is necessary. However, the problem requires an optimal plan, which is the shortest possible. Maybe there's a shorter way.

Another idea: When unstacking B3 from W1, instead of stacking it on B4, stack it on B1. Wait, B1 has B4. So stack B3 on B4. Which is the same as before. No difference.

Alternatively, after step 4 (stack B3 on B4), then proceed to unstack W1. Then, putdown W1. Then, pickup B1 (but it's under B4 and B3). Can't.

Alternatively, after putting down W1, instead of stacking B2 on B1, stack something else on B2 to satisfy the constraint that there's a block on B2 after moving W1.

For example:

7. After putdown W1 (step 6), pickup B3 (which is on B4). But B3 is on B4, which is on B1. So to unstack B3 from B4:

7. unstack B3 B4 → hold B3
8. stack B3 B2 → B3 on B2 (now B2 has B3)
   - Now, B2 is not clear, satisfying the implication for the constraint when B4 is not on yellow. Which is already true, but this ensures that after unstacking W1, B2 has B3 on top.
9. Then proceed to handle the other constraints.

This reduces some steps. Let's see:

1. unstack B4 B3 → hold B4
2. stack B4 B1 → B4 on B1
3. unstack B3 W1 → hold B3
4. stack B3 B2 → B3 on B2 (B2 now has B3)
5. unstack W1 B2 → can't, because B2 has B3 on top. So W1 is under B3. So this approach doesn't work. So we need to unstack B3 first.

This is very tricky. It seems that the minimal plan requires quite a few steps. But the key is to satisfy all constraints without unnecessary actions. 

After several iterations, the correct and optimal plan would likely involve:

- Unstacking B4 and B3 to clear W1.
- Putting W1 down.
- Moving B2 onto B1 to satisfy the constraint.
- Moving green_block_1 onto W1 after clearing yellow_block_1.
- Holding black_block_1 after clearing its stack.
- Ensuring all other constraints are met through these actions.

But to fit this into a minimal number of steps while meeting all constraints, the plan might look like this:

```
```
unstack black_block_4 black_block_3
stack black_block_4 black_block_1
unstack black_block_3 white_block_1
stack black_block_3 black_block_4
unstack white_block_1 black_block_2
putdown white_block_1
pickup black_block_1
stack black_block_2 black_block_1
unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1
putdown yellow_block_1
pickup green_block_1
stack green_block_1 white_block_1
```
```

Wait, let's check each step:

1. unstack B4 from B3 → holding B4
2. stack B4 on B1 → B4 on B1, B1 not clear
3. unstack B3 from W1 → holding B3
4. stack B3 on B4 → B3 on B4, B4 not clear
5. unstack W1 from B2 → holding W1 (satisfies constraint 2)
6. putdown W1 → goal achieved
7. pickup B1 → but B1 has B4 and B3. Can't pickup. This is a mistake. So step 7 is invalid.

Ah, right. So after step 4, B1 has B4 and B3. So we can't pickup B1 here. So this plan is invalid.

Thus, the correct plan must first clear B1 by unstacking B3 and B4. Let's adjust:

After step 4 (stack B3 on B4):

5. unstack B3 B4 → holding B3
6. stack B3 on B2 → B3 on B2 (B2 now not clear)
7. unstack B4 B1 → holding B4
8. stack B4 on B3 (now B4 on B3 → B2 has B3 and B4)
9. Now, B1 is clear. pickup B1 → holding B1 (satisfies the constraint)
10. unstack W1 B2 → holding W1 (constraint 2)
11. putdown W1 → goal
12. Now, need to stack B2 on B1. B2 has B3 and B4. So unstack B4 from B3.
13. unstack B4 B3 → holding B4
14. stack B4 on B1 → B4 on B1
15. unstack B3 B2 → holding B3
16. stack B3 on B4 → B3 on B4
17. pickup B2 → holding B2
18. stack B2 B1 → B2 on B1 (satisfies constraint)
19. unstack Y1 G1 → holding Y1
20. putdown Y1
21. pickup G1 → holding G1
22. stack G1 W1 → green on white (constraint)
23. Now, in some state during these steps, we have G on W and holding B1. For example, after step 9 (holding B1), but G is not on W yet. After step 22, G is on W, but not holding B1. So need to have both conditions. So maybe after step 9, we stack B1 on some block, then pick up G and stack on W, then pick up B1 again. But this complicates the plan.

This is getting too long. Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct answer is the following, ensuring all constraints are met with the minimal steps:

```
```
unstack black_block_4 black_block_3
stack black_block_4 black_block_1
unstack black_block_3 white_block_1
stack black_block_3 black_block_4
unstack white_block_1 black_block_2
putdown white_block_1
unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1
stack yellow_block_1 black_block_2
pickup green_block_1
stack green_block_1 white_block_1
unstack black_block_3 black_block_4
stack black_block_3 yellow_block_1
unstack black_block_4 black_block_1
stack black_block_4 black_block_3
pickup black_block_1
stack black_block_2 black_block_1
```
```

This plan:

- Unstacks B4 and B3, stacks them on B1.
- Unstacks W1 and puts it down.
- Moves Y1 to B2, allowing G1 to be picked up and stacked on W1.
- Moves B3 to Y1 (so B3 is not on Y1 in the initial state, but after this step, it is. But the constraint requires at least one state where B3 is not on Y1. That was already true in the initial state.
- Stacks B4 on B3 on Y1.
- Picks up B1 and stacks B2 on it.

Checking constraints:

- "green on white and holding B1" occurs after stacking green on white and later picking up B1.
- "holding W1" is done when unstacking.
- When holding W1, B1 has B4 and B3, satisfying constraint 3.
- "black_block_3 not on yellow_block_1" is true initially.
- "black_block_4 not on yellow_block_1" is true initially.
- "holding green_block_1" occurs when picking it up.
- "white_block_1 on B1" is not done, but the constraint requires white on B1 at some state. Wait, no, the constraint says "white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" must hold in at least one state. But in this plan, white_block_1 is put down on the table. So that constraint isn't met. This is a problem.

Ah, right, one of the constraints is that white_block_1 must be on top of black_block_1 in some state. So the current plan doesn't satisfy that. Therefore, we need to adjust.

So, after putting down white_block_1, we need to pick it up again and stack it on black_block_1. But that adds steps. Alternatively, perhaps during the process, we can stack white on B1 before putting it down. But initially, white is under B3 and B4. So we have to remove those first.

Let me try to adjust the plan to include stacking white on B1:

1. unstack B4 B3 → hold B4
2. stack B4 B1 → B4 on B1
3. unstack B3 W1 → hold B3
4. stack B3 B4 → B3 on B4
5. unstack W1 B2 → hold W1
6. stack W1 B1 → W1 on B1 (satisfies white on B1)
7. Now, need to put W1 on table. So unstack W1 B1 → hold W1
8. putdown W1 → goal
9. ... other steps.

But this adds steps. But the constraint requires white on B1 in some state. So steps 6 and 7 would satisfy that. But this adds two steps. But maybe it's necessary.

Alternatively, after step 5 (hold W1), stack W1 on B1 (step 6), then unstack and putdown. This would satisfy the constraint.

But this increases the plan length. However, the problem requires that the plan is optimal, so we need to minimize steps.

Perhaps the optimal plan is as follows:

```
```
unstack black_block_4 black_block_3
stack black_block_4 black_block_1
unstack black_block_3 white_block_1
stack black_block_3 black_block_4
unstack white_block_1 black_block_2
stack white_block_1 black_block_1
putdown white_block_1
unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1
stack yellow_block_1 black_block_2
pickup green_block_1
stack green_block_1 white_block_1
unstack black_block_3 black_block_4
stack black_block_3 yellow_block_1
unstack black_block_4 black_block_1
stack black_block_4 black_block_3
pickup black_block_1
stack black_block_2 black_block_1
```
```

This plan includes stacking white_block_1 on black_block_1 (step 5-6), then putting it down. This satisfies the constraint of white on B1. However, after stacking and then unstacking, it's more steps. But the constraint is met in step 5.

But I'm not sure if this is the shortest possible. Given the complexity of the problem, the optimal plan likely requires around 14 steps. However, without further iteration, I'll provide the final answer based on the most efficient path I can determine.
