Let's analyze the planning problem:

Initial State:
- red_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- black_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- black_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- brown_block_1 is clear
- black_block_2 is clear
- green_block_1 is clear
- arm is not holding any block

Goal:
- brown_block_1 is on the table

So in the initial state, we have the following stacks:
1. red_block_1 (bottom, on table) with brown_block_1 on top
2. black_block_1 (bottom, on table) with blue_block_1 on top and black_block_2 on top of that
3. yellow_block_1 (bottom, on table) with green_block_1 on top

And we want to get to a state where brown_block_1 is on the table.

Currently, brown_block_1 is on top of red_block_1. Since brown_block_1 is clear and the arm is empty, we can unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1, and then put it down on the table.

So, the plan would be:
1. "unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1"
2. "putdown brown_block_1"

Let's check if this meets the preconditions and effects:

For action 1: "unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1"
Preconditions:
- brown_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 (satisfied)
- brown_block_1 is clear (satisfied)
- arm is not holding any block (satisfied)

Effects:
- brown_block_1 is no longer on top of red_block_1
- red_block_1 becomes clear
- arm is now holding brown_block_1

For action 2: "putdown brown_block_1"
Preconditions:
- arm is holding brown_block_1 (satisfied from the effects of action 1)

Effects:
- brown_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is clear
- arm is no longer holding any block

After these two actions, we achieve the goal of having brown_block_1 on the table. This is the optimal plan with the minimum number of actions (2).

So, the optimal plan is:
1. "unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1"
2. "putdown brown_block_1"
