Let's first understand the problem clearly. We have a blocksworld setup with 7 blocks, and we need to plan a sequence of actions to reach a goal state where "brown_block_1 is on the table" while satisfying a set of constraints.

Initial state:
- red_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- black_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- black_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- brown_block_1, black_block_2, and green_block_1 are clear
- You are not holding any block

Goal state:
- brown_block_1 is on the table

Now, let's think about a plan. We need to move brown_block_1 from on top of red_block_1 to the table. At first glance, this seems simple:
1. Unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1
2. Putdown brown_block_1

But we also have a lot of constraints to satisfy. Let's go through them one by one and understand what they mean:

1. "There is a block on top of black_block_2" must be true at some point.
   - In the initial state, black_block_2 is clear, so we need to stack some block on it.

2. "black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1" must be true at some point.
   - In the initial state, black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1 (it's on the table with blue_block_1 on top), so this constraint is already satisfied.

3. If "black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1" is true, then either "red_block_1 is not on the table" or "brown_block_1 is not clear" must be true subsequently.
   - We satisfy the antecedent (black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1), so we need to satisfy the consequent. In the initial state, brown_block_1 is clear and red_block_1 is on the table, so we don't satisfy the consequent yet. We need to either move red_block_1 off the table or put a block on top of brown_block_1.

4. "You are holding blue_block_1" must be true at some point.
   - We need to hold blue_block_1 at some point, which means we need to unstack it from somewhere.

5. "yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" and "yellow_block_1 is clear" must be true simultaneously at some point.
   - We need to move yellow_block_1 on top of black_block_1 and ensure nothing is on top of yellow_block_1.

6. "green_block_1 is not on the table" must be true at some point.
   - In the initial state, green_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, so this constraint is already satisfied.

7. If "green_block_1 is not on the table" is true, then either "yellow_block_1 is clear" or "green_block_1 is not clear" must be true subsequently.
   - In the initial state, green_block_1 is not on the table (it's on yellow_block_1) and green_block_1 is clear, but yellow_block_1 is not clear. So we don't satisfy the consequent initially. We need to either make yellow_block_1 clear or put something on top of green_block_1.

8. "black_block_1 is not on the table" and "green_block_1 is on the table" must be true simultaneously at some point.
   - We need to move black_block_1 off the table and move green_block_1 to the table.

9. "yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" must be true at some point.
   - We need to stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1.

10. "brown_block_1 is not clear" must be true at some point.
    - We need to put some block on top of brown_block_1.

11. If "brown_block_1 is not clear" is true, then there must be an earlier state where either "you are holding green_block_1" or "you are holding yellow_block_1" is true.
    - Before we can satisfy constraint 10, we need to hold either green_block_1 or yellow_block_1.

12. "brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1" must be true at some point.
    - In the initial state, brown_block_1 is on top of red_block_1, not blue_block_1, so this constraint is already satisfied.

13. If "brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1" is true, then either "yellow_block_1 is on top of red_block_1" or "you are holding blue_block_1" must be true subsequently.
    - We satisfy the antecedent (brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1), so we need to satisfy the consequent. We need to either put yellow_block_1 on top of red_block_1 or hold blue_block_1.

14. "black_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1" must be true at some point.
    - In the initial state, black_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1, not yellow_block_1, so this constraint is already satisfied.

15. If "black_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1" is true, then "yellow_block_1 is not on the table" must be true subsequently.
    - We satisfy the antecedent (black_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1), so we need to satisfy the consequent. We need to move yellow_block_1 off the table.

Now, let's try to construct a plan that achieves the goal and satisfies all constraints.

Step 1: We need to move brown_block_1 to the table, but we also need to satisfy constraint 10 (put a block on brown_block_1) before doing that. According to constraint 11, before we can put a block on brown_block_1, we need to hold either green_block_1 or yellow_block_1.

Let's start with moving green_block_1:
1. Unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1

Now, we're holding green_block_1, which satisfies part of constraint 11.

Step 2: Let's stack green_block_1 on brown_block_1 to satisfy constraint 10:
2. Stack green_block_1 brown_block_1

Now, brown_block_1 is not clear, satisfying constraint 10.

Step 3: Let's move brown_block_1 to the table. But first, we need to remove green_block_1 from it:
3. Unstack green_block_1 brown_block_1
4. Putdown green_block_1

Now green_block_1 is on the table, which helps with constraint 8.

Step 5: Now we can move brown_block_1 to the table:
5. Unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1
6. Putdown brown_block_1

We've achieved our goal of having brown_block_1 on the table.

Step 6: Let's work on constraint 5 and 9 (yellow_block_1 on top of black_block_1 and yellow_block_1 is clear). First, we need to clear black_block_1:
7. Unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
Now we're holding blue_block_1, which satisfies constraint 4.

Step 7: Now, let's also move yellow_block_1 (which satisfies part of constraint 15 since yellow_block_1 is not on the table when we pick it up):
8. Pickup yellow_block_1
9. Stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1

Now, yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, satisfying constraint 5 and 9. Also, now black_block_1 is not on the table, which, combined with green_block_1 being on the table, satisfies constraint 8.

Step 8: Let's work on constraint 1 (a block on top of black_block_2). First, we need to put down blue_block_1:
10. Putdown blue_block_1

Now, let's stack a block on black_block_2:
11. Pickup green_block_1
12. Stack green_block_1 black_block_2

This satisfies constraint 1.

Wait, I need to review our current state and check which constraints we still haven't satisfied.

Current state after our planned steps:
- red_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
- green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2
- red_block_1, brown_block_1, blue_block_1, yellow_block_1, green_block_1 are clear
- You are not holding any block

Constraints we've satisfied:
1. ✓ "There is a block on top of black_block_2" when we stacked green_block_1 on black_block_2.
2. ✓ "black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1" was already satisfied in the initial state.
4. ✓ "You are holding blue_block_1" when we unstacked blue_block_1 from black_block_1.
5. ✓ "yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" and "yellow_block_1 is clear" when we stacked yellow_block_1 on black_block_1.
6. ✓ "green_block_1 is not on the table" was already satisfied in the initial state and also when we stacked it on black_block_2.
8. ✓ "black_block_1 is not on the table" and "green_block_1 is on the table" can be satisfied during our plan by staggering the steps.
9. ✓ "yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" when we stacked yellow_block_1 on black_block_1.
10. ✓ "brown_block_1 is not clear" when we stacked green_block_1 on brown_block_1.
11. ✓ "Before brown_block_1 is not clear, you are holding green_block_1 or yellow_block_1" when we held green_block_1 before stacking it on brown_block_1.
12. ✓ "brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1" was already satisfied in the initial state.
14. ✓ "black_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1" was already satisfied in the initial state.

Constraints we need to satisfy:
3. If "black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1" is true, then either "red_block_1 is not on the table" or "brown_block_1 is not clear" must be true subsequently.
   - We've satisfied "brown_block_1 is not clear" at step 2, so this is good.
7. If "green_block_1 is not on the table" is true, then either "yellow_block_1 is clear" or "green_block_1 is not clear" must be true subsequently.
   - We've satisfied "yellow_block_1 is clear" during our plan, so this is good.
13. If "brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1" is true, then either "yellow_block_1 is on top of red_block_1" or "you are holding blue_block_1" must be true subsequently.
   - We've satisfied "you are holding blue_block_1" at step 7, so this is good.
15. If "black_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1" is true, then "yellow_block_1 is not on the table" must be true subsequently.
   - We've satisfied "yellow_block_1 is not on the table" when we picked it up, so this is good.

It looks like we've addressed all the constraints. Let's double-check our plan and make adjustments if necessary.

Hmm, I realized I made a mistake in my description of the current state. Let me correct it:

After our planned steps:
- red_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
- green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2

But this is inconsistent. Let me trace through the plan again:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (Now holding green_block_1)
2. Stack green_block_1 brown_block_1 (green_block_1 is on brown_block_1, which is on red_block_1)
3. Unstack green_block_1 brown_block_1 (Now holding green_block_1)
4. Putdown green_block_1 (green_block_1 is on the table)
5. Unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1 (Now holding brown_block_1)
6. Putdown brown_block_1 (brown_block_1 is on the table)
7. Unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1 (Now holding blue_block_1)
8. Pickup yellow_block_1 (Wait, we can't do this because we're holding blue_block_1)

Ok, let me revise the plan:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (Now holding green_block_1)
2. Stack green_block_1 brown_block_1 (green_block_1 is on brown_block_1, which is on red_block_1)
3. Unstack green_block_1 brown_block_1 (Now holding green_block_1)
4. Putdown green_block_1 (green_block_1 is on the table)
5. Unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1 (Now holding brown_block_1)
6. Putdown brown_block_1 (brown_block_1 is on the table)
7. Unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1 (Now holding blue_block_1)
8. Putdown blue_block_1 (blue_block_1 is on the table)
9. Unstack black_block_2 blue_block_1 (Now holding black_block_2)
10. Putdown black_block_2 (black_block_2 is on the table)
11. Pickup yellow_block_1 (Now holding yellow_block_1)
12. Stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is on black_block_1, both are on the table)
13. Pickup green_block_1 (Now holding green_block_1)
14. Stack green_block_1 black_block_2 (green_block_1 is on black_block_2, both are on the table)

Current state after the revised plan:
- red_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_2 is on the table with green_block_1 on top
- yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2
- red_block_1, brown_block_1, blue_block_1, yellow_block_1, green_block_1 are clear
- You are not holding any block

Now let's verify the constraints again:
1. ✓ "There is a block on top of black_block_2" when we stacked green_block_1 on black_block_2.
2. ✓ "black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1" was already satisfied in the initial state.
3. ✓ If "black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1" is true, then either "red_block_1 is not on the table" or "brown_block_1 is not clear" must be true subsequently. We satisfied this when we stacked green_block_1 on brown_block_1.
4. ✓ "You are holding blue_block_1" when we unstacked blue_block_1 from black_block_1.
5. ✓ "yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" and "yellow_block_1 is clear" when we stacked yellow_block_1 on black_block_1.
6. ✓ "green_block_1 is not on the table" was satisfied in the initial state and also when we stacked it on black_block_2.
7. ✓ If "green_block_1 is not on the table" is true, then either "yellow_block_1 is clear" or "green_block_1 is not clear" must be true subsequently. We satisfied this when yellow_block_1 became clear.
8. X "black_block_1 is not on the table" and "green_block_1 is on the table" must be true simultaneously at some point. In our plan, black_block_1 is always on the table, so we're not satisfying this constraint.
9. ✓ "yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" when we stacked yellow_block_1 on black_block_1.
10. ✓ "brown_block_1 is not clear" when we stacked green_block_1 on brown_block_1.
11. ✓ "Before brown_block_1 is not clear, you are holding green_block_1 or yellow_block_1" when we held green_block_1 before stacking it on brown_block_1.
12. ✓ "brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1" was already satisfied in the initial state.
13. ✓ If "brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1" is true, then either "yellow_block_1 is on top of red_block_1" or "you are holding blue_block_1" must be true subsequently. We satisfied this when we held blue_block_1.
14. ✓ "black_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1" was already satisfied in the initial state.
15. ✓ If "black_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1" is true, then "yellow_block_1 is not on the table" must be true subsequently. We satisfied this when we picked up yellow_block_1.

We still need to satisfy constraint 8: "black_block_1 is not on the table" and "green_block_1 is on the table" must be true simultaneously at some point.

Let's revise our plan again:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (Now holding green_block_1)
2. Stack green_block_1 brown_block_1 (green_block_1 is on brown_block_1, which is on red_block_1)
3. Unstack green_block_1 brown_block_1 (Now holding green_block_1)
4. Putdown green_block_1 (green_block_1 is on the table)
5. Unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1 (Now holding brown_block_1)
6. Stack brown_block_1 green_block_1 (brown_block_1 is on green_block_1, both are on the table)
7. Pickup black_block_1 (Now holding black_block_1)
-- At this point, black_block_1 is not on the table and green_block_1 is on the table, satisfying constraint 8 --
8. Putdown black_block_1 (black_block_1 is on the table)
9. Unstack brown_block_1 green_block_1 (Now holding brown_block_1)
10. Putdown brown_block_1 (brown_block_1 is on the table)
11. Unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1 (Now holding blue_block_1)
12. Putdown blue_block_1 (blue_block_1 is on the table)
13. Unstack black_block_2 blue_block_1 (Now holding black_block_2)
14. Putdown black_block_2 (black_block_2 is on the table)
15. Pickup yellow_block_1 (Now holding yellow_block_1)
16. Stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is on black_block_1, both are on the table)
17. Pickup green_block_1 (Now holding green_block_1)
18. Stack green_block_1 black_block_2 (green_block_1 is on black_block_2, both are on the table)

But does this satisfy all constraints? Let's verify:

1. ✓ "There is a block on top of black_block_2" when we stacked green_block_1 on black_block_2.
2. ✓ "black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1" was already satisfied in the initial state.
3. ✓ If "black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1" is true, then either "red_block_1 is not on the table" or "brown_block_1 is not clear" must be true subsequently. We satisfied this when we stacked green_block_1 on brown_block_1.
4. ✓ "You are holding blue_block_1" when we unstacked blue_block_1 from black_block_1.
5. ✓ "yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" and "yellow_block_1 is clear" when we stacked yellow_block_1 on black_block_1.
6. ✓ "green_block_1 is not on the table" was satisfied in the initial state and also when we stacked it on black_block_2.
7. ✓ If "green_block_1 is not on the table" is true, then either "yellow_block_1 is clear" or "green_block_1 is not clear" must be true subsequently. We satisfied this with yellow_block_1 being clear.
8. ✓ "black_block_1 is not on the table" and "green_block_1 is on the table" simultaneously at step 7.
9. ✓ "yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" when we stacked yellow_block_1 on black_block_1.
10. ✓ "brown_block_1 is not clear" when we stacked green_block_1 on brown_block_1.
11. ✓ "Before brown_block_1 is not clear, you are holding green_block_1 or yellow_block_1" when we held green_block_1 before stacking it on brown_block_1.
12. ✓ "brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1" was already satisfied in the initial state.
13. ✓ If "brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1" is true, then either "yellow_block_1 is on top of red_block_1" or "you are holding blue_block_1" must be true subsequently. We satisfied this when we held blue_block_1.
14. ✓ "black_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1" was already satisfied in the initial state.
15. ✓ If "black_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1" is true, then "yellow_block_1 is not on the table" must be true subsequently. We satisfied this when we picked up yellow_block_1.

It looks like we satisfy all constraints now. Let's double-check our goal: "brown_block_1 is on the table." In our final state, brown_block_1 is indeed on the table, so we've achieved the goal.

Let's review the plan one more time to make sure it's valid:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (Now holding green_block_1)
2. Stack green_block_1 brown_block_1 (green_block_1 is on brown_block_1, which is on red_block_1)
3. Unstack green_block_1 brown_block_1 (Now holding green_block_1)
4. Putdown green_block_1 (green_block_1 is on the table)
5. Unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1 (Now holding brown_block_1)
6. Stack brown_block_1 green_block_1 (brown_block_1 is on green_block_1, both are on the table)
7. Pickup black_block_1 (Now holding black_block_1)
8. Putdown black_block_1 (black_block_1 is on the table)
9. Unstack brown_block_1 green_block_1 (Now holding brown_block_1)
10. Putdown brown_block_1 (brown_block_1 is on the table)
11. Unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1 (Now holding blue_block_1)
12. Putdown blue_block_1 (blue_block_1 is on the table)
13. Unstack black_block_2 blue_block_1 (Now holding black_block_2)
14. Putdown black_block_2 (black_block_2 is on the table)
15. Pickup yellow_block_1 (Now holding yellow_block_1)
16. Stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is on black_block_1, both are on the table)
17. Pickup green_block_1 (Now holding green_block_1)
18. Stack green_block_1 black_block_2 (green_block_1 is on black_block_2, both are on the table)

Wait, I'm still not tracking the state correctly. Let me carefully go through the initial state again:

Initial state:
- red_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- black_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- black_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- brown_block_1, black_block_2, and green_block_1 are clear
- You are not holding any block

Now I'll trace through the plan and update the state after each step:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1
   - Now holding green_block_1
   - yellow_block_1 is clear

2. Stack green_block_1 brown_block_1
   - green_block_1 is on brown_block_1
   - green_block_1 is clear
   - brown_block_1 is not clear
   - not holding any block

3. Unstack green_block_1 brown_block_1
   - Now holding green_block_1
   - brown_block_1 is clear

4. Putdown green_block_1
   - green_block_1 is on the table
   - green_block_1 is clear
   - not holding any block

5. Unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1
   - Now holding brown_block_1
   - red_block_1 is clear

6. Stack brown_block_1 green_block_1
   - brown_block_1 is on green_block_1
   - brown_block_1 is clear
   - green_block_1 is not clear
   - not holding any block

7. Pickup black_block_1
   Oops, we can't do this because blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, so black_block_1 is not clear. Let me go back to step 7 and revise.

7. Unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
   - Now holding blue_block_1
   - black_block_1 is clear
   - black_block_2 is on blue_block_1 in the initial state, but we're holding blue_block_1 now, so this doesn't make sense.

I'm not tracking the state correctly. Let me restart and be more careful.

- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- black_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- green_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- black_block_2 is clear
- You are not holding any block

Now we've achieved the goal of having brown_block_1 on the table. Let's continue to satisfy the remaining constraints.

Step 7: Unstack black_block_2 blue_block_1
Updated state:
- red_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- brown_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- black_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1 (and is now clear)
- yellow_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- green_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- You are holding black_block_2

Step 8: Stack black_block_2 green_block_1
Updated state:
- red_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- brown_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- black_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1 (and is clear)
- yellow_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- green_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1 (and is clear)
- You are not holding any block

Step 9: Unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
Updated state:
- red_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- brown_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- black_block_1 is on the table (and is now clear)
- yellow_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- green_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1 (and is clear)
- You are holding blue_block_1

Step 10: Putdown blue_block_1
Updated state:
- red_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- brown_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- black_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- blue_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- yellow_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- green_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1 (and is clear)
- You are not holding any block

Step 11: Stack something on black_block_2 to satisfy constraint 1. Let's use blue_block_1:
Pickup blue_block_1
Updated state:
- red_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- brown_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- black_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- yellow_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- green_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1 (and is clear)
- You are holding blue_block_1

Step 12: Stack blue_block_1 black_block_2
Updated state:
- red_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- brown_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- black_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- yellow_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- green_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2 (and is clear)
- You are not holding any block

This satisfies constraint 1.

Let's work on constraint 5 and 9: "yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" and "yellow_block_1 is clear".

Step 13: Pickup yellow_block_1
Updated state:
- red_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- brown_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- black_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- green_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2 (and is clear)
- You are holding yellow_block_1

Step 14: Stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1
Updated state:
- red_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- brown_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- black_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1 (and is clear)
- green_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2 (and is clear)
- You are not holding any block

This satisfies constraints 5 and 9.

Now, let's work on constraint 8: "black_block_1 is not on the table" and "green_block_1 is on the table" simultaneously. green_block_1 is already on the table, so we need to pick up black_block_1.

But we can't pick up black_block_1 directly because yellow_block_1 is on top of it. So we need to unstack yellow_block_1 first.

Step 15: Unstack yellow_block_1 black_block_1
Updated state:
- red_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- brown_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- black_block_1 is on the table (and is now clear)
- green_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2 (and is clear)
- You are holding yellow_block_1

Step 16: Putdown yellow_block_1
Updated state:
- red_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- brown_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- black_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- yellow_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- green_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2 (and is clear)
- You are not holding any block

Step 17: Pickup black_block_1
Updated state:
- red_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- brown_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- yellow_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- green_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2 (and is clear)
- You are holding black_block_1

At this point, black_block_1 is not on the table and green_block_1 is on the table, satisfying constraint 8.

Step 18: Putdown black_block_1
Updated state:
- red_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- brown_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- black_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- yellow_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- green_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2 (and is clear)
- You are not holding any block

Step 19: Pickup yellow_block_1
Updated state:
- red_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- brown_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- black_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- green_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2 (and is clear)
- You are holding yellow_block_1

Step 20: Stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1
Updated state:
- red_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- brown_block_1 is on the table (and is clear)
- black_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1 (and is clear)
- green_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2 (and is clear)
- You are not holding any block

This satisfies constraints 5 and 9 again.

Let's review the constraints we've satisfied:

1. ✓ "There is a block on top of black_block_2" when we stacked blue_block_1 on black_block_2.
2. ✓ "black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1" was already satisfied in the initial state.
3. ✓ If "black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1" is true, then either "red_block_1 is not on the table" or "brown_block_1 is not clear" must be true subsequently. We satisfied this when we stacked green_block_1 on brown_block_1.
4. ✓ "You are holding blue_block_1" when we unstacked blue_block_1 from black_block_1.
5. ✓ "yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" and "yellow_block_1 is clear" when we stacked yellow_block_1 on black_block_1.
6. ✓ "green_block_1 is not on the table" was satisfied in the initial state.
7. ✓ If "green_block_1 is not on the table" is true, then either "yellow_block_1 is clear" or "green_block_1 is not clear" must be true subsequently. We satisfied this when yellow_block_1 became clear.
8. ✓ "black_block_1 is not on the table" and "green_block_1 is on the table" simultaneously at step 17.
9. ✓ "yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" when we stacked yellow_block_1 on black_block_1.
10. ✓ "brown_block_1 is not clear" when we stacked green_block_1 on brown_block_1.
11. ✓ "Before brown_block_1 is not clear, you are holding green_block_1 or yellow_block_1" when we held green_block_1 before stacking it on brown_block_1.
12. ✓ "brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1" was already satisfied in the initial state.
13. ✓ If "brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1" is true, then either "yellow_block_1 is on top of red_block_1" or "you are holding blue_block_1" must be true subsequently. We satisfied this when we held blue_block_1.
14. ✓ "black_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1" was already satisfied in the initial state.
15. ✓ If "black_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1" is true, then "yellow_block_1 is not on the table" must be true subsequently. We satisfied this when we picked up yellow_block_1.

All constraints appear to be satisfied. Let's finalize our plan:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1
2. Stack green_block_1 brown_block_1
3. Unstack green_block_1 brown_block_1
4. Putdown green_block_1
5. Unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1
6. Putdown brown_block_1
7. Unstack black_block_2 blue_block_1
8. Stack black_block_2 green_block_1
9. Unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
10. Putdown blue_block_1
11. Pickup blue_block_1
12. Stack blue_block_1 black_block_2
13. Pickup yellow_block_1
14. Stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1
15. Unstack yellow_block_1 black_block_1
16. Putdown yellow_block_1
17. Pickup black_block_1
18. Putdown black_block_1
19. Pickup yellow_block_1
20. Stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1

We can simplify this plan by removing certain steps that are unnecessary. Specifically, steps 15-20 don't add anything to satisfying the constraints we haven't already satisfied. Let's remove them:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_1
2. Stack green_block_1 brown_block_1
3. Unstack green_block_1 brown_block_1
4. Putdown green_block_1
5. Unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1
6. Putdown brown_block_1
7. Unstack black_block_2 blue_block_1
8. Stack black_block_2 green_block_1
9. Unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
10. Putdown blue_block_1
11. Pickup blue_block_1
12. Stack blue_block_1 black_block_2
13. Pickup yellow_block_1
14. Stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1
15. Unstack yellow_block_1 black_block_1
16. Putdown yellow_block_1
17. Pickup black_block_1

Ah, actually, I still need step 17 to satisfy constraint 8. But after that, steps 18-20 don't add anything, so I don't need to reput yellow_block_1 after that.

Let's try simplifying the plan in a different way. Do steps 11-12 add anything? Yes, it satisfies constraint 1 (a block on top of black_block_2). What about steps 15-16? They are needed to make black_block_1 clear before picking it up.

Let's try a different approach. Let's start with the minimal steps to achieve the goal:

1. Unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1
2. Putdown brown_block_1

Now, let's add steps to satisfy the constraints:

Constraint 1: "There is a block on top of black_block_2"
3. Unstack black_block_2 blue_block_1
4. Putdown black_block_2
5. Pickup blue_block_1
6. Stack blue_block_1 black_block_2

Constraint 3: "If black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1, then either red_block_1 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear"
We satisfy the antecedent (black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1), so we need to satisfy the consequent. Let's make brown_block_1 not clear:
7. Pickup green_block_1
8. Stack green_block_1 brown_block_1
9. Unstack green_block_1 brown_block_1
10. Putdown green_block_1

Constraint 4: "You are holding blue_block_1"
We already satisfied this in steps 5-6.

Constraint 5 and 9: "yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" and "yellow_block_1 is clear"
11. Unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1 (if needed)
12. Putdown blue_block_1 (if needed)
13. Pickup yellow_block_1
14. Stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1

Constraint 8: "black_block_1 is not on the table" and "green_block_1 is on the table"
15. Unstack yellow_block_1 black_block_1
16. Putdown yellow_block_1
17. Pickup black_block_1
18. Putdown black_block_1
19. Pickup yellow_block_1
20. Stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1

But wait, I'm mixing up the states again. Let me start over and trace through the states more carefully. Let's start with the initial state:

Initial state:
- red_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- black_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- black_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- brown_block_1, black_block_2, and green_block_1 are clear
- You are not holding any block

Let's restate our goal and the constraints:

Goal: brown_block_1 is on the table

Constraints (simplified):
1. black_block_2 must have a block on top at some point
2. black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1 at some point
3. When black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1, then either red_block_1 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear
4. You must hold blue_block_1 at some point
5. yellow_block_1 must be on top of black_block_1 and clear at some point
6. green_block_1 is not on the table at some point
7. When green_block_1 is not on the table, then either yellow_block_1 is clear or green_block_1 is not clear
8. black_block_1 is not on the table and green_block_1 is on the table simultaneously at some point
9. yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1 at some point
10. brown_block_1 is not clear at some point
11. Before brown_block_1 is not clear, you must be holding green_block_1 or yellow_block_1
12. brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1 at some point
13. When brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1, then either yellow_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 or you are holding blue_block_1
14. black_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1 at some point
15. When black_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1, then yellow_block_1 is not on the table at some point

Now, let's create a minimal plan to achieve the goal while satisfying all constraints. Let's start with the goal:

1. Unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1
2. Putdown brown_block_1

Now, brown_block_1 is on the table, but we have several constraints to satisfy:

To satisfy constraint 10 (brown_block_1 is not clear), we need to put a block on top of brown_block_1. Constraint 11 says that before doing this, we must be holding green_block_1 or yellow_block_1.

Let's choose green_block_1:
3. Unstack green_block_1 yellow_block_1 (Now holding green_block_1, yellow_block_1 is clear)
4. Stack green_block_1 brown_block_1 (green_block_1 is on brown_block_1, brown_block_1 is not clear)

This satisfies constraint 10 and 11. Also, constraint 3 is satisfied since brown_block_1 is not clear.

To satisfy constraint 4 (you must hold blue_block_1), we need to get to blue_block_1, which is currently under black_block_2. 

5. Unstack green_block_1 brown_block_1 (Now holding green_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear)
6. Putdown green_block_1 (green_block_1 is on the table)
7. Unstack black_block_2 blue_block_1 (Now holding black_block_2, blue_block_1 is clear)
8. Putdown black_block_2 (black_block_2 is on the table)
9. Unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1 (Now holding blue_block_1, black_block_1 is clear)

This satisfies constraint 4 (holding blue_block_1) and constraint 13 (either yellow_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 or you are holding blue_block_1).

To satisfy constraint 1 (black_block_2 must have a block on top), we can stack blue_block_1 on black_block_2:
10. Stack blue_block_1 black_block_2 (blue_block_1 is on black_block_2, blue_block_1 is clear)

To satisfy constraint 9 (yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1), we need to move yellow_block_1, which is currently clear:
11. Pickup yellow_block_1 (Now holding yellow_block_1)
12. Stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is on black_block_1, yellow_block_1 is clear)

This also satisfies constraint 5 (yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1 and clear).

To satisfy constraint 8 (black_block_1 is not on the table and green_block_1 is on the table), we need to move black_block_1 off the table. But first, we need to remove yellow_block_1 from it:
13. Unstack yellow_block_1 black_block_1 (Now holding yellow_block_1, black_block_1 is clear)
14. Stack yellow_block_1 red_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is on red_block_1, yellow_block_1 is clear)
15. Pickup black_block_1 (Now holding black_block_1)

At this point, black_block_1 is not on the table and green_block_1 is on the table, satisfying constraint 8.

Let's put black_block_1 back to finish our plan:
16. Putdown black_block_1 (black_block_1 is on the table)

Final plan:
1. Unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1
2. Putdown brown_block_1
3. Unstack green_block_1 yellow_block_1
4. Stack green_block_1 brown_block_1
5. Unstack green_block_1 brown_block_1
6. Putdown green_block_1
7. Unstack black_block_2 blue_block_1
8. Putdown black_block_2
9. Unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
10. Stack blue_block_1 black_block_2
11. Pickup yellow_block_1
12. Stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1
13. Unstack yellow_block_1 black_block_1
14. Stack yellow_block_1 red_block_1
15. Pickup black_block_1
16. Putdown black_block_1

Let's check all constraints one more time:

1. ✓ "There is a block on top of black_block_2" at step 10.
2. ✓ "black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1" is already satisfied in the initial state.
3. ✓ "When black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1, then either red_block_1 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear" is satisfied at step 4 when brown_block_1 is not clear.
4. ✓ "You must hold blue_block_1" at step 9.
5. ✓ "yellow_block_1 must be on top of black_block_1 and clear" at step 12.
6. ✓ "green_block_1 is not on the table" is satisfied in the initial state.
7. ✓ "When green_block_1 is not on the table, then either yellow_block_1 is clear or green_block_1 is not clear" is satisfied at step 3 when yellow_block_1 becomes clear.
8. ✓ "black_block_1 is not on the table and green_block_1 is on the table" simultaneously at step 15.
9. ✓ "yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" at step 12.
10. ✓ "brown_block_1 is not clear" at step 4.
11. ✓ "Before brown_block_1 is not clear, you must be holding green_block_1 or yellow_block_1" is satisfied at step 3 when we hold green_block_1.
12. ✓ "brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1" is already satisfied in the initial state.
13. ✓ "When brown_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1, then either yellow_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 or you are holding blue_block_1" is satisfied at step 9 when we hold blue_block_1 and at step 14 when yellow_block_1 is on top of red_block_1.
14. ✓ "black_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1" is already satisfied in the initial state.
15. ✓ "When black_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1, then yellow_block_1 is not on the table" is satisfied at step 11 when we pick up yellow_block_1.

All constraints are satisfied, and our goal is achieved. Here's the final plan:

1. Unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1
2. Putdown brown_block_1
3. Unstack green_block_1 yellow_block_1
4. Stack green_block_1 brown_block_1
5. Unstack green_block_1 brown_block_1
6. Putdown green_block_1
7. Unstack black_block_2 blue_block_1
8. Putdown black_block_2
9. Unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
10. Stack blue_block_1 black_block_2
11. Pickup yellow_block_1
12. Stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1
13. Unstack yellow_block_1 black_block_1
14. Stack yellow_block_1 red_block_1
15. Pickup black_block_1
16. Putdown black_block_1

This plan achieves the goal and satisfies all constraints. It's also quite efficient, with each step serving a specific purpose.
