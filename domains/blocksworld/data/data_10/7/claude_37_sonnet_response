Let's analyze the planning problem in detail:

Initial state:
- black_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_2 is on top of white_block_1
- green_block_1 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
- black_block_2 is on the table
- yellow_block_1, white_block_2, red_block_1, and black_block_2 are clear
- I'm not holding any block

Goal:
- black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1

Let's visualize the initial state:

```
   white_block_2     red_block_1     
   white_block_1     green_block_1   yellow_block_1   black_block_2
   black_block_1                                      
   -------------------------------------------------------- (table)
```

And the goal state:
```
                     black_block_2
                     red_block_1     
                     green_block_1   
   -------------------------------------------------------- (table)
```

Now let's go through the constraints:

1. At some point, black_block_2 must not be clear (i.e., have a block on top of it).
2. Before black_block_2 becomes not clear, red_block_1 must not be on top of green_block_1.
3. At some point, red_block_1 must not be clear.
4. Before red_block_1 becomes not clear, yellow_block_1 must not be clear AND I must be holding white_block_1.
5. At some point, red_block_1 must not be on top of green_block_1.
6. At some point, white_block_1 must not be on the table.
7. After white_block_1 is not on the table, at some point I must be holding green_block_1.
8. At some point, black_block_2 must not be on the table.
9. After black_block_2 is not on the table, at some point yellow_block_1 must not be clear.
10. At some point, white_block_2 must not be clear.
11. At some point, either I must be holding white_block_2 OR white_block_1 must be on the table.
12. At some point, green_block_1 must not be clear.
13. After green_block_1 becomes not clear, at some point black_block_1 must be on top of yellow_block_1.
14. At some point, white_block_2 must not be on top of green_block_1. (Note: In the initial state, white_block_2 is already not on top of green_block_1, so this constraint is automatically satisfied).
15. After white_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1, at some point green_block_1 must be clear.
16. At some point, black_block_2 must not be on top of white_block_1. (Note: In the initial state, black_block_2 is already not on top of white_block_1, so this constraint is automatically satisfied).
17. After black_block_2 is not on top of white_block_1, at some point yellow_block_1 must be on top of white_block_2 AND white_block_1 must be on the table.

These constraints are complex and interrelated. Let's try to find an efficient plan that satisfies all of them and reaches the goal.

First, let's see what the goal requires directly:
- We need to have black_block_2 on top of red_block_1, which means we need to move black_block_2 from the table to the top of red_block_1.

Given constraints 8 and 9, after black_block_2 is not on the table, at some point yellow_block_1 must not be clear. So, we'll need to put something on top of yellow_block_1.

Given constraints 3 and 4, before putting something on top of red_block_1, yellow_block_1 must not be clear and I must be holding white_block_1.

Let's start planning:

1. We need to move red_block_1 from the top of green_block_1 to somewhere else (to satisfy constraint 5).
2. We need to pick up white_block_1 at some point (for constraint 4), which means we need to first remove white_block_2 from on top of it.
3. We need to put something on top of green_block_1 (for constraint 12), and after that, put black_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1 (for constraint 13).
4. We need to put something on top of white_block_2 (for constraint 10).
5. Yellow_block_1 needs to be put on top of white_block_2, and white_block_1 needs to be on the table (for constraint 17).

Let's try to develop a plan:

1. unstack red_block_1 green_block_1  // This satisfies constraint 5
2. putdown red_block_1  // red_block_1 is now on the table and clear
3. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1  // Now white_block_1 is clear
4. stack white_block_2 green_block_1  // This puts a block on top of green_block_1, satisfying constraint 12
5. unstack white_block_1 black_block_1  // Now I'm holding white_block_1, which is needed for constraint 4, and this also satisfies constraint 6
6. stack white_block_1 yellow_block_1  // This makes yellow_block_1 not clear, which is needed for constraint 4
7. pickup black_block_1  // Now I can move black_block_1
8. stack black_block_1 white_block_1  // This should satisfy constraint 13
9. pickup black_block_2  // This satisfies constraint 8
10. stack black_block_2 yellow_block_1  // This makes black_block_2 not on the table and not clear (constraint 1) because of black_block_1 above it
11. unstack black_block_1 white_block_1  // To clear white_block_1
12. putdown black_block_1  // black_block_1 is now on the table
13. unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1  // To clear yellow_block_1
14. putdown white_block_1  // white_block_1 is now on the table, which is needed for constraint 17
15. unstack black_block_2 yellow_block_1  // To clear yellow_block_1
16. stack black_block_2 red_block_1  // This achieves the goal

Wait, there are inconsistencies in this plan. Let me review and correct:

The issue is at step 10. We're trying to stack black_block_2 on yellow_block_1, but yellow_block_1 already has white_block_1 on top of it.

Let me rethink this plan:

1. unstack red_block_1 green_block_1  // This satisfies constraint 5
2. putdown red_block_1  // red_block_1 is now on the table and clear
3. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1  // Now white_block_1 is clear
4. putdown white_block_2  // white_block_2 is now on the table
5. unstack white_block_1 black_block_1  // Now I'm holding white_block_1, which is needed for constraint 4, and this also satisfies constraint 6
6. stack white_block_1 yellow_block_1  // This makes yellow_block_1 not clear, which is needed for constraint 4
7. stack white_block_2 white_block_1  // This puts a block on top of white_block_1

Wait, this approach also has issues. Let me restart with a clearer plan.

Let's focus on the constraints directly:

1. The goal requires black_block_2 to be on top of red_block_1.
2. Constraint 3 requires red_block_1 to not be clear at some point.
3. Constraint 4 requires that before red_block_1 becomes not clear, yellow_block_1 must not be clear AND I must be holding white_block_1.
4. Constraint 5 requires red_block_1 to not be on top of green_block_1 at some point.
5. Constraint 7 requires that after white_block_1 is not on the table, at some point I must be holding green_block_1.
6. Constraint 9 requires that after black_block_2 is not on the table, at some point yellow_block_1 must not be clear.
7. Constraint 13 requires that after green_block_1 becomes not clear, at some point black_block_1 must be on top of yellow_block_1.
8. Constraint 17 requires that after black_block_2 is not on top of white_block_1, at some point yellow_block_1 must be on top of white_block_2 AND white_block_1 must be on the table.

Let's start with a high-level plan:

1. First, satisfy constraint 5 by moving red_block_1 from green_block_1.
2. Then, make white_block_1 not on the table and at some point after that, hold green_block_1 (for constraints 6 and 7).
3. Make yellow_block_1 not clear and be holding white_block_1 (for constraint 4).
4. Make red_block_1 not clear (for constraint 3).
5. Make green_block_1 not clear and after that, put black_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1 (for constraint 13).
6. Move black_block_2 from the table and after that, ensure yellow_block_1 is not clear (for constraints 8 and 9).
7. Put yellow_block_1 on top of white_block_2 and make white_block_1 on the table (for constraint 17).

Let's now refine this plan into specific actions:

```
1. unstack red_block_1 green_block_1  // This satisfies constraint 5
2. putdown red_block_1  // red_block_1 is now on the table and clear
3. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1  // Clearing white_block_1
4. putdown white_block_2  // white_block_2 is now on the table
5. unstack white_block_1 black_block_1  // This makes white_block_1 not on the table (constraint 6)
6. stack white_block_1 yellow_block_1  // yellow_block_1 is now not clear and we're holding white_block_1 (constraint 4)
7. pickup green_block_1  // Now we're holding green_block_1 (constraint 7)
8. putdown green_block_1  // green_block_1 is back on the table
9. pickup black_block_1  // To move black_block_1
10. stack black_block_1 green_block_1  // This makes green_block_1 not clear (constraint 12)
11. pickup white_block_2  // This satisfies constraint 11
12. putdown white_block_2  // white_block_2 is back on the table
13. pickup black_block_2  // black_block_2 is now not on the table (constraint 8)
14. stack black_block_2 red_block_1  // This makes red_block_1 not clear (constraint 3) and achieves the goal
15. pickup yellow_block_1  // To move yellow_block_1
16. stack yellow_block_1 white_block_2  // This makes white_block_2 not clear (constraint 10) and satisfies part of constraint 17
17. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1  // To clear green_block_1
18. stack black_block_1 yellow_block_1  // black_block_1 is now on top of yellow_block_1 (constraint 13) and yellow_block_1 is not clear (constraint 9)
19. pickup white_block_1  // To move white_block_1
20. putdown white_block_1  // white_block_1 is now on the table (satisfying the rest of constraint 17)
```

Hmm, something still doesn't seem right. Let's review and ensure we're meeting all constraints:

1. "At some point, black_block_2 must not be clear": After step 14, black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1 and clear. We don't put anything on top of it, so this constraint is not satisfied. We need to put something on top of black_block_2.

Let me reconsider the constraints:

1. "At some point, black_block_2 must not be clear": We need to put a block on top of black_block_2.
2. "Before black_block_2 becomes not clear, red_block_1 must not be on top of green_block_1": We remove red_block_1 from green_block_1 in step 1, so this should be fine.
3. "At some point, red_block_1 must not be clear": We put black_block_2 on top of red_block_1 in step 14, so this is satisfied.
4. "Before red_block_1 becomes not clear, yellow_block_1 must not be clear AND I must be holding white_block_1": In step 6, we make yellow_block_1 not clear by putting white_block_1 on it. But by step 14, I'm not holding white_block_1 anymore. This might be an issue.
5. "At some point, red_block_1 must not be on top of green_block_1": Satisfied in step 1.
6. "At some point, white_block_1 must not be on the table": Satisfied in step 5.
7. "After white_block_1 is not on the table, at some point I must be holding green_block_1": Satisfied in step 7.
8. "At some point, black_block_2 must not be on the table": Satisfied in step 13.
9. "After black_block_2 is not on the table, at some point yellow_block_1 must not be clear": yellow_block_1 becomes not clear in step 18, which is after black_block_2 is not on the table in step 13, so this is satisfied.
10. "At some point, white_block_2 must not be clear": Satisfied in step 16.
11. "At some point, either I must be holding white_block_2 OR white_block_1 must be on the table": Satisfied in step 11 (holding white_block_2) and also in step 20 (white_block_1 on the table).
12. "At some point, green_block_1 must not be clear": Satisfied in step 10.
13. "After green_block_1 becomes not clear, at some point black_block_1 must be on top of yellow_block_1": green_block_1 becomes not clear in step 10, and black_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1 in step 18, so this is satisfied.
14. "At some point, white_block_2 must not be on top of green_block_1": This is already satisfied in the initial state.
15. "After white_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1, at some point green_block_1 must be clear": green_block_1 is initially clear, then not clear in step 10, then clear again in step 17. So this is satisfied.
16. "At some point, black_block_2 must not be on top of white_block_1": This is already satisfied in the initial state.
17. "After black_block_2 is not on top of white_block_1, at some point yellow_block_1 must be on top of white_block_2 AND white_block_1 must be on the table": yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_2 in step 16, and white_block_1 is on the table in step 20, so this is satisfied.

The issue is with constraints 1 and 4:
1. We need to put a block on top of black_block_2 to satisfy constraint 1.
4. Before red_block_1 becomes not clear (i.e., before step 14), yellow_block_1 must not be clear AND I must be holding white_block_1. We need to revise our plan.

Let me create a new plan:

```
1. unstack red_block_1 green_block_1  // This satisfies constraint 5
2. putdown red_block_1  // red_block_1 is now on the table and clear
3. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1  // Now white_block_1 is clear
4. putdown white_block_2  // white_block_2 is now on the table
5. unstack white_block_1 black_block_1  // Now white_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 6)
6. stack white_block_1 yellow_block_1  // This makes yellow_block_1 not clear
7. pickup black_block_2  // black_block_2 is now not on the table (constraint 8)
8. stack black_block_2 red_block_1  // This makes red_block_1 not clear (constraint 3) and achieves the goal
9. pickup green_block_1  // Now we're holding green_block_1 (constraint 7)
10. stack green_block_1 black_block_2  // This makes black_block_2 not clear (constraint 1)
11. pickup white_block_2  // This satisfies constraint 11
12. stack white_block_2 green_block_1  // This makes white_block_2 not clear (constraint 10)
13. pickup black_block_1  // To move black_block_1
14. stack black_block_1 white_block_1  // This satisfies constraint 13
15. unstack black_block_1 white_block_1  // To clear white_block_1
16. putdown black_block_1  // black_block_1 is now on the table
17. unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1  // To clear yellow_block_1
18. putdown white_block_1  // white_block_1 is now on the table (part of constraint 17)
19. pickup yellow_block_1  // To move yellow_block_1
20. stack yellow_block_1 white_block_2  // This makes yellow_block_1 on top of white_block_2 (the other part of constraint 17)
```

Wait, I still haven't satisfied constraint 4: "Before red_block_1 becomes not clear, yellow_block_1 must not be clear AND I must be holding white_block_1." In step 8, I make red_block_1 not clear by putting black_block_2 on it, but I'm not holding white_block_1 at that point.

Let me rethink this.

Actually, let's break down constraint 4 more carefully: "If expression 'there is a block on top of red_block_1, i.e., red_block_1 is not clear' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'The following conditions are all true: "there is a block on top of yellow_block_1, i.e., yellow_block_1 is not clear", "you are holding white_block_1"'"

This means that at some state before red_block_1 becomes not clear, we need to simultaneously have yellow_block_1 not be clear AND be holding white_block_1. It doesn't have to be the state immediately before.

Alright, let's create a new plan with this clarification:

```
1. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1  // Now white_block_1 is clear
2. putdown white_block_2  // white_block_2 is now on the table
3. unstack white_block_1 black_block_1  // Now white_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 6) and I'm holding it
4. stack white_block_1 yellow_block_1  // This makes yellow_block_1 not clear AND I was holding white_block_1 (constraint 4)
5. unstack red_block_1 green_block_1  // This satisfies constraint 5
6. putdown red_block_1  // red_block_1 is now on the table and clear
7. pickup green_block_1  // Now I'm holding green_block_1 (constraint 7)
8. putdown green_block_1  // green_block_1 is back on the table
9. pickup black_block_1  // To move black_block_1
10. stack black_block_1 green_block_1  // This makes green_block_1 not clear (constraint 12)
11. pickup black_block_2  // black_block_2 is now not on the table (constraint 8)
12. stack black_block_2 red_block_1  // This makes red_block_1 not clear (constraint 3) and achieves the goal
13. pickup white_block_2  // This satisfies constraint 11
14. stack white_block_2 green_block_1  // This makes white_block_2 not on the table
15. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1  // To clear green_block_1 (constraint 15)
16. stack black_block_1 yellow_block_1  // black_block_1 is now on top of yellow_block_1 (constraint 13), and this makes yellow_block_1 not clear (constraint 9)
17. pickup white_block_1  // To move white_block_1
18. putdown white_block_1  // white_block_1 is now on the table (part of constraint 17)
19. unstack black_block_1 yellow_block_1  // To clear yellow_block_1
20. putdown black_block_1  // black_block_1 is now on the table
21. pickup yellow_block_1  // To move yellow_block_1
22. stack yellow_block_1 white_block_2  // This makes yellow_block_1 on top of white_block_2 (the other part of constraint 17)
23. pickup green_block_1  // To move green_block_1
24. stack green_block_1 black_block_2  // This makes black_block_2 not clear (constraint 1)
```

Now, let's check if all constraints are satisfied:

1. "At some point, black_block_2 must not be clear": Satisfied in step 24.
2. "Before black_block_2 becomes not clear, red_block_1 must not be on top of green_block_1": red_block_1 is removed from green_block_1 in step 5, and black_block_2 becomes not clear in step 24, so this is satisfied.
3. "At some point, red_block_1 must not be clear": Satisfied in step 12.
4. "Before red_block_1 becomes not clear, yellow_block_1 must not be clear AND I must be holding white_block_1": yellow_block_1 becomes not clear in step 4 and I was holding white_block_1, which is before red_block_1 becomes not clear in step 12, so this is satisfied.
5. "At some point, red_block_1 must not be on top of green_block_1": Satisfied in step 5.
6. "At some point, white_block_1 must not be on the table": Satisfied in step 3.
7. "After white_block_1 is not on the table, at some point I must be holding green_block_1": white_block_1 becomes not on the table in step 3, and I hold green_block_1 in step 7, so this is satisfied.
8. "At some point, black_block_2 must not be on the table": Satisfied in step 11.
9. "After black_block_2 is not on the table, at some point yellow_block_1 must not be clear": black_block_2 becomes not on the table in step 11, and yellow_block_1 becomes not clear (again) in step 16, so this is satisfied.
10. "At some point, white_block_2 must not be clear": Satisfied in step 22 when yellow_block_1 is stacked on top of it.
11. "At some point, either I must be holding white_block_2 OR white_block_1 must be on the table": Satisfied in step 13 (holding white_block_2) and also in step 18 (white_block_1 on the table).
12. "At some point, green_block_1 must not be clear": Satisfied in step 10.
13. "After green_block_1 becomes not clear, at some point black_block_1 must be on top of yellow_block_1": green_block_1 becomes not clear in step 10, and black_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1 in step 16, so this is satisfied.
14. "At some point, white_block_2 must not be on top of green_block_1": This is already satisfied in the initial state.
15. "After white_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1, at some point green_block_1 must be clear": green_block_1 is initially clear, then not clear in step 10, then clear again in step 15. So this is satisfied.
16. "At some point, black_block_2 must not be on top of white_block_1": This is already satisfied in the initial state.
17. "After black_block_2 is not on top of white_block_1, at some point yellow_block_1 must be on top of white_block_2 AND white_block_1 must be on the table": yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_2 in step 22, and white_block_1 is on the table in step 18, so this is satisfied.

I believe all constraints are now satisfied. The goal is achieved in step 12.

Let me double-check for any mistakes...

There's a potential issue in step 14: We're stacking white_block_2 on green_block_1, but green_block_1 already has black_block_1 on top of it from step 10.

Let me correct this:

```
1. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1  // Now white_block_1 is clear
2. putdown white_block_2  // white_block_2 is now on the table
3. unstack white_block_1 black_block_1  // Now white_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 6) and I'm holding it
4. stack white_block_1 yellow_block_1  // This makes yellow_block_1 not clear AND I was holding white_block_1 (constraint 4)
5. unstack red_block_1 green_block_1  // This satisfies constraint 5
6. putdown red_block_1  // red_block_1 is now on the table and clear
7. pickup green_block_1  // Now I'm holding green_block_1 (constraint 7)
8. putdown green_block_1  // green_block_1 is back on the table
9. pickup black_block_1  // To move black_block_1
10. stack black_block_1 green_block_1  // This makes green_block_1 not clear (constraint 12)
11. pickup black_block_2  // black_block_2 is now not on the table (constraint 8)
12. stack black_block_2 red_block_1  // This makes red_block_1 not clear (constraint 3) and achieves the goal
13. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1  // To clear green_block_1 (constraint 15)
14. stack black_block_1 yellow_block_1  // black_block_1 is now on top of yellow_block_1 (constraint 13), and this makes yellow_block_1 not clear (constraint 9)
15. pickup white_block_2  // This satisfies constraint 11
16. stack white_block_2 green_block_1  // This makes white_block_2 not on the table
17. pickup white_block_1  // To move white_block_1
18. putdown white_block_1  // white_block_1 is now on the table (part of constraint 17)
19. unstack black_block_1 yellow_block_1  // To clear yellow_block_1
20. putdown black_block_1  // black_block_1 is now on the table
21. pickup yellow_block_1  // To move yellow_block_1
22. stack yellow_block_1 white_block_2  // This makes yellow_block_1 on top of white_block_2 (the other part of constraint 17)
23. pickup green_block_1  // To move green_block_1
24. stack green_block_1 black_block_2  // This makes black_block_2 not clear (constraint 1)
```

Now, let's check if steps 13-24 make sense:

13. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1  // This clears green_block_1
14. stack black_block_1 yellow_block_1  // But yellow_block_1 already has white_block_1 on top of it from step 4.

Let me re-rethink the steps:

```
1. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1  // Now white_block_1 is clear
2. putdown white_block_2  // white_block_2 is now on the table
3. unstack white_block_1 black_block_1  // Now white_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 6) and I'm holding it
4. stack white_block_1 yellow_block_1  // This makes yellow_block_1 not clear AND I was holding white_block_1 (constraint 4)
5. unstack red_block_1 green_block_1  // This satisfies constraint 5
6. putdown red_block_1  // red_block_1 is now on the table and clear
7. pickup green_block_1  // Now I'm holding green_block_1 (constraint 7)
8. putdown green_block_1  // green_block_1 is back on the table
9. pickup black_block_1  // To move black_block_1
10. stack black_block_1 green_block_1  // This makes green_block_1 not clear (constraint 12)
11. pickup black_block_2  // black_block_2 is now not on the table (constraint 8)
12. stack black_block_2 red_block_1  // This makes red_block_1 not clear (constraint 3) and achieves the goal
13. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1  // To clear green_block_1 (constraint 15)
14. unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1  // To clear yellow_block_1
15. putdown white_block_1  // white_block_1 is now on the table (part of constraint 17)
16. stack black_block_1 yellow_block_1  // black_block_1 is now on top of yellow_block_1 (constraint 13), and this makes yellow_block_1 not clear (constraint 9)
17. pickup white_block_2  // This satisfies constraint 11
18. stack white_block_2 green_block_1  // This makes white_block_2 not on the table
19. unstack black_block_1 yellow_block_1  // To clear yellow_block_1
20. putdown black_block_1  // black_block_1 is now on the table
21. pickup yellow_block_1  // To move yellow_block_1
22. stack yellow_block_1 white_block_2  // This makes yellow_block_1 on top of white_block_2 (the other part of constraint 17)
23. pickup green_block_1  // To move green_block_1
24. stack green_block_1 black_block_2  // This makes black_block_2 not clear (constraint 1)
```

Ok, now I believe the steps are consistent. Let's check that this plan satisfies all the constraints again:

1. "At some point, black_block_2 must not be clear": Satisfied in step 24.
2. "Before black_block_2 becomes not clear, red_block_1 must not be on top of green_block_1": red_block_1 is removed from green_block_1 in step 5, and black_block_2 becomes not clear in step 24, so this is satisfied.
3. "At some point, red_block_1 must not be clear": Satisfied in step 12.
4. "Before red_block_1 becomes not clear, yellow_block_1 must not be clear AND I must be holding white_block_1": yellow_block_1 becomes not clear in step 4 and I'm holding white_block_1, which is before red_block_1 becomes not clear in step 12, so this is satisfied.
5. "At some point, red_block_1 must not be on top of green_block_1": Satisfied in step 5.
6. "At some point, white_block_1 must not be on the table": Satisfied in step 3.
7. "After white_block_1 is not on the table, at some point I must be holding green_block_1": white_block_1 becomes not on the table in step 3, and I hold green_block_1 in step 7, so this is satisfied.
8. "At some point, black_block_2 must not be on the table": Satisfied in step 11.
9. "After black_block_2 is not on the table, at some point yellow_block_1 must not be clear": black_block_2 becomes not on the table in step 11, and yellow_block_1 becomes not clear (again) in step 16, so this is satisfied.
10. "At some point, white_block_2 must not be clear": Satisfied in step 22 when yellow_block_1 is stacked on top of it.
11. "At some point, either I must be holding white_block_2 OR white_block_1 must be on the table": Satisfied in step 17 (holding white_block_2) and also in step 15 (white_block_1 on the table).
12. "At some point, green_block_1 must not be clear": Satisfied in step 10.
13. "After green_block_1 becomes not clear, at some point black_block_1 must be on top of yellow_block_1": green_block_1 becomes not clear in step 10, and black_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1 in step 16, so this is satisfied.
14. "At some point, white_block_2 must not be on top of green_block_1": This is already satisfied in the initial state.
15. "After white_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1, at some point green_block_1 must be clear": green_block_1 is initially clear, then not clear in step 10, then clear again in step 13. So this is satisfied.
16. "At some point, black_block_2 must not be on top of white_block_1": This is already satisfied in the initial state.
17. "After black_block_2 is not on top of white_block_1, at some point yellow_block_1 must be on top of white_block_2 AND white_block_1 must be on the table": yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_2 in step 22, and white_block_1 is on the table in step 15, so this is satisfied.

I believe the plan is correct and satisfies all the constraints.

To summarize, our plan is:

```
1. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1  // Now white_block_1 is clear
2. putdown white_block_2  // white_block_2 is now on the table
3. unstack white_block_1 black_block_1  // Now white_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 6) and I'm holding it
4. stack white_block_1 yellow_block_1  // This makes yellow_block_1 not clear AND I was holding white_block_1 (constraint 4)
5. unstack red_block_1 green_block_1  // This satisfies constraint 5
6. putdown red_block_1  // red_block_1 is now on the table and clear
7. pickup green_block_1  // Now I'm holding green_block_1 (constraint 7)
8. putdown green_block_1  // green_block_1 is back on the table
9. pickup black_block_1  // To move black_block_1
10. stack black_block_1 green_block_1  // This makes green_block_1 not clear (constraint 12)
11. pickup black_block_2  // black_block_2 is now not on the table (constraint 8)
12. stack black_block_2 red_block_1  // This makes red_block_1 not clear (constraint 3) and achieves the goal
13. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1  // To clear green_block_1 (constraint 15)
14. unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1  // To clear yellow_block_1
15. putdown white_block_1  // white_block_1 is now on the table (part of constraint 17)
16. stack black_block_1 yellow_block_1  // black_block_1 is now on top of yellow_block_1 (constraint 13), and this makes yellow_block_1 not clear (constraint 9)
17. pickup white_block_2  // This satisfies constraint 11
18. stack white_block_2 green_block_1  // This makes white_block_2 not on the table
19. unstack black_block_1 yellow_block_1  // To clear yellow_block_1
20. putdown black_block_1  // black_block_1 is now on the table
21. pickup yellow_block_1  // To move yellow_block_1
22. stack yellow_block_1 white_block_2  // This makes yellow_block_1 on top of white_block_2 (the other part of constraint 17)
23. pickup green_block_1  // To move green_block_1
24. stack green_block_1 black_block_2  // This makes black_block_2 not clear (constraint 1)
```

This plan achieves the goal (black_block_2 on top of red_block_1) and satisfies all the constraints.

Actually, let me double-check this plan once more to be sure:

1. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1: This is valid. In the initial state, white_block_2 is on top of white_block_1, and white_block_2 is clear, and I'm not holding any block.
2. putdown white_block_2: This is valid. I'm holding white_block_2 after step 1.
3. unstack white_block_1 black_block_1: This is valid. white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, white_block_1 is clear, and I'm not holding any block.
4. stack white_block_1 yellow_block_1: This is valid. I'm holding white_block_1 after step 3, and yellow_block_1 is clear.
5. unstack red_block_1 green_block_1: This is valid. red_block_1 is on top of green_block_1, red_block_1 is clear, and I'm not holding any block.
6. putdown red_block_1: This is valid. I'm holding red_block_1 after step 5.
7. pickup green_block_1: This is valid. green_block_1 is clear and on the table, and I'm not holding any block.
8. putdown green_block_1: This is valid. I'm holding green_block_1 after step 7.
9. pickup black_block_1: This is valid. black_block_1 is clear and on the table, and I'm not holding any block.
10. stack black_block_1 green_block_1: This is valid. I'm holding black_block_1 after step 9, and green_block_1 is clear.
11. pickup black_block_2: This is valid. black_block_2 is clear and on the table, and I'm not holding any block.
12. stack black_block_2 red_block_1: This is valid. I'm holding black_block_2 after step 11, and red_block_1 is clear.
13. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1: This is valid. black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1, black_block_1 is clear, and I'm not holding any block.
14. unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1: This is valid. white_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, white_block_1 is clear, and I'm not holding any block.
15. putdown white_block_1: This is valid. I'm holding white_block_1 after step 14.
16. stack black_block_1 yellow_block_1: This is valid. I'm holding black_block_1 after step 13, and yellow_block_1 is clear after step 14.
17. pickup white_block_2: This is valid. white_block_2 is clear and on the table, and I'm not holding any block.
18. stack white_block_2 green_block_1: This is valid. I'm holding white_block_2 after step 17, and green_block_1 is clear after step 13.
19. unstack black_block_1 yellow_block_1: This is valid. black_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, black_block_1 is clear, and I'm not holding any block.
20. putdown black_block_1: This is valid. I'm holding black_block_1 after step 19.
21. pickup yellow_block_1: This is valid. yellow_block_1 is clear after step 19, and I'm not holding any block.
22. stack yellow_block_1 white_block_2: This is valid. I'm holding yellow_block_1 after step 21, and white_block_2 is clear.
23. pickup green_block_1: This is valid. green_block_1 is clear and on the table, and I'm not holding any block.
24. stack green_block_1 black_block_2: This is valid. I'm holding green_block_1 after step 23, and black_block_2 is clear.

OK. The plan is valid. Let me finally double-check that all the constraints are satisfied by recounting them:

1. "At some point, black_block_2 must not be clear": Satisfied in step 24.
2. "Before black_block_2 becomes not clear, red_block_1 must not be on top of green_block_1": red_block_1 is removed from green_block_1 in step 5, and black_block_2 becomes not clear in step 24, so this is satisfied.
3. "At some point, red_block_1 must not be clear": Satisfied in step 12.
4. "Before red_block_1 becomes not clear, yellow_block_1 must not be clear AND I must be holding white_block_1": yellow_block_1 becomes not clear in step 4 when white_block_1 is stacked on it, and at that point, I was just holding white_block_1. This is before red_block_1 becomes not clear in step 12, so this constraint is satisfied.
5. "At some point, red_block_1 must not be on top of green_block_1": Satisfied in step 5.
6. "At some point, white_block_1 must not be on the table": Satisfied in steps 3 and 4, when white_block_1 is unstacked and then stacked elsewhere.
7. "After white_block_1 is not on the table, at some point I must be holding green_block_1": white_block_1 becomes not on the table in step 3, and I hold green_block_1 in step 7, so this is satisfied.
8. "At some point, black_block_2 must not be on the table": Satisfied in steps 11 and 12, when black_block_2 is picked up and stacked on red_block_1.
9. "After black_block_2 is not on the table, at some point yellow_block_1 must not be clear": black_block_2 becomes not on the table in step 11, and yellow_block_1 becomes not clear (again) in step 16 when black_block_1 is stacked on it, so this is satisfied.
10. "At some point, white_block_2 must not be clear": Satisfied in step 22 when yellow_block_1 is stacked on top of it.
11. "At some point, either I must be holding white_block_2 OR white_block_1 must be on the table": Satisfied in step 17 (holding white_block_2) and also in step 15 (white_block_1 on the table).
12. "At some point, green_block_1 must not be clear": Satisfied in step 10 when black_block_1 is stacked on it.
13. "After green_block_1 becomes not clear, at some point black_block_1 must be on top of yellow_block_1": green_block_1 becomes not clear in step 10, and black_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1 in step 16, so this is satisfied.
14. "At some point, white_block_2 must not be on top of green_block_1": This is already satisfied in the initial state.
15. "After white_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1, at some point green_block_1 must be clear": green_block_1 is initially clear, then not clear in step 10, then clear again in step 13. So this is satisfied.
16. "At some point, black_block_2 must not be on top of white_block_1": This is already satisfied in the initial state.
17. "After black_block_2 is not on top of white_block_1, at some point yellow_block_1 must be on top of white_block_2 AND white_block_1 must be on the table": yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_2 in step 22, and white_block_1 is on the table in step 15, so this is satisfied.

Great, the plan is valid and all constraints are satisfied!

Let me double-check once more if this is the optimal (i.e., shortest) valid plan. Are there any steps we can remove or simplify?

Given the complexity of the constraints, it's hard to know for sure if there's a shorter valid plan. But if we examine our current plan, nearly every step is there to satisfy a specific constraint, and the goal itself requires at least a stack operation for black_block_2 onto red_block_1, so the length seems reasonable. I believe this plan is optimal or close to optimal.

```
1. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
2. putdown white_block_2
3. unstack white_block_1 black_block_1
4. stack white_block_1 yellow_block_1
5. unstack red_block_1 green_block_1
6. putdown red_block_1
7. pickup green_block_1
8. putdown green_block_1
9. pickup black_block_1
10. stack black_block_1 green_block_1
11. pickup black_block_2
12. stack black_block_2 red_block_1
13. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1
14. unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1
15. putdown white_block_1
16. stack black_block_1 yellow_block_1
17. pickup white_block_2
18. stack white_block_2 green_block_1
19. unstack black_block_1 yellow_block_1
20. putdown black_block_1
21. pickup yellow_block_1
22. stack yellow_block_1 white_block_2
23. pickup green_block_1
24. stack green_block_1 black_block_2
```

That's our final plan!
