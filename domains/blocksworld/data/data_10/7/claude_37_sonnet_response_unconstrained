So I'm given a blocksworld problem, and I need to find an optimal plan to reach a specific goal. Let me first make sure I understand the current state of the world and the goal.

Current state:
- black_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- white_block_2 is on top of white_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on the table and clear
- green_block_1 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 and clear
- black_block_2 is on the table and clear
- you are not holding any block

Goal state:
- black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1

Let me visualize the starting state and the goal state:

Starting state:
```
      white_block_2      red_block_1      black_block_2   yellow_block_1
      white_block_1      green_block_1
      black_block_1
      _______________TABLE_______________
```

Goal state:
```
                        black_block_2
                        red_block_1
                        green_block_1
      _______________TABLE_______________
```

(Note that I'm not showing what happens to other blocks in the goal state, since they're not specified. Only that black_block_2 should be on top of red_block_1.)

Now, to reach the goal state:
1. We need to pick up black_block_2 from the table. 
2. Then we need to stack it on top of red_block_1.

Let's make sure this plan works:

Step 1: "pickup black_block_2"
Preconditions: 
- Black_block_2 is clear (satisfied)
- Black_block_2 is on the table (satisfied)
- You are not holding any block (satisfied)

Effects: 
- You are holding black_block_2
- Black_block_2 is no longer on the table

Step 2: "stack black_block_2 red_block_1"
Preconditions: 
- You are holding black_block_2 (satisfied after step 1)
- Red_block_1 is clear (satisfied)

Effects: 
- Black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- Black_block_2 is clear
- Red_block_1 is no longer clear
- You are no longer holding black_block_2

So the plan would be:
```
pickup black_block_2
stack black_block_2 red_block_1
```

Let me double check: 
- The goal is to have "black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1", and this state is achieved after step 2.
- All the preconditions for each action are satisfied.
- The constraints...

Wait, there are no constraints specified in the problem statement. So the plan above is valid and optimal (since it has only two steps, which is the minimum number of steps required to move a block from one location to another in the Blocksworld domain).

So the optimal plan is:
```
pickup black_block_2
stack black_block_2 red_block_1
```
