Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to get black_block_2 on top of red_block_1. Let's start by looking at the initial state and the goal.

In the initial state, black_block_2 is on the table and clear. Red_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 and is also clear. So, the goal is to have black_block_2 stacked on red_block_1.

First, I need to check the preconditions for stacking. To stack black_block_2 onto red_block_1, I need to have black_block_2 in the robotic arm's grip, and red_block_1 must be clear. Red_block_1 is currently clear, so that's good. But black_block_2 is on the table, so I need to pick it up. Wait, but to pick up a block, it needs to be clear and on the table. Black_block_2 is clear and on the table, so that's possible. So the steps would be: pickup black_block_2, then stack it onto red_block_1. But wait, after picking up black_block_2, I'm holding it. Then stacking requires that red_block_1 is clear, which it is. So stacking should work. So the plan would be:

1. pickup black_block_2
2. stack black_block_2 red_block_1

But wait, let's check the preconditions again for each action. For the pickup action, the block must be on the table, clear, and the arm is empty. Yes, black_block_2 is on the table, clear, and the arm is initially empty. Then, after pickup, the arm is holding black_block_2. Then, for stack, the arm must be holding the first block (black_block_2) and the second block (red_block_1) must be clear. Red_block_1 is clear initially. So yes. Then stacking would place black_block_2 on red_block_1. So that seems straightforward. But wait, let me check if there's any interference from other blocks. For example, is red_block_1 on the table? No, it's on top of green_block_1. Does that matter? No, because stack just requires that the target block is clear. So stacking on red_block_1 is allowed even if it's on another block, as long as it's clear. So this plan should work. But wait, is there any reason why this isn't possible? Let me verify again.

Wait, the initial state has red_block_1 on green_block_1. So when stacking black_block_2 onto red_block_1, the red_block_1 is clear. So after stacking, red_block_1 will have black_block_2 on top, making it not clear anymore. The action's effects are correct. So the two steps should be enough. But why would the problem be presented here? Maybe I'm missing something. Let's check again the initial setup.

Looking back: The initial state lists "red_block_1 is on top of green_block_1" and "there is no block on top of red_block_1". So red_block_1 is clear. So yes, stacking black_block_2 on red_block_1 is possible. Therefore, the optimal plan is two steps. But maybe there's a catch. Let me think again. Are there any blocks on top of black_block_2 initially? No, it's on the table and clear. So the steps are valid. Therefore, the plan should be:

pickup black_block_2
stack black_block_2 red_block_1

But wait, the problem states that the plan must be optimal, so no unnecessary steps. Since this is two steps, which is the minimum required, this should be correct. But let me check if there are any other constraints I missed. The problem mentions that the plan must abide by the action preconditions. So let's make sure each action's preconditions are met.

For the pickup action: black_block_2 is on the table, clear, and the arm is empty. All conditions met.

For the stack action: The arm is holding black_block_2 (after pickup), and red_block_1 is clear. Yes. So the stack is allowed.

Therefore, the optimal plan is two actions. I think that's it. There's no need for any other steps. Let me think if there's any possible obstacle. For example, is red_block_1 under another block? No, it's on top of green_block_1, but itself is clear. So stacking is allowed. Therefore, this plan should work.
