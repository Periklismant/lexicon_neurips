Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to get black_block_2 on top of red_block_1. But there are a bunch of constraints we need to satisfy along the way. Let me start by understanding the initial state and then all the constraints.

First, the initial state. Let me list out the blocks and their positions:

- black_block_1 is on the table, with white_block_1 on top, and then white_block_2 on top of white_block_1. So the tower is black_block_1 → white_block_1 → white_block_2. And white_block_2 is clear.

- yellow_block_1 is on the table and clear.

- green_block_1 is on the table with red_block_1 on top. Red_block_1 is clear.

- black_block_2 is on the table and clear.

So the initial setup has a few stacks. The main goal is to get black_block_2 onto red_block_1. But red_block_1 is currently on green_block_1. So we need to move red_block_1 first? Wait, no, the goal is to put black_block_2 on red_block_1. So red_block_1 is where it is, on green_block_1. So maybe we can stack black_block_2 onto red_block_1 directly once red_block_1 is clear. But red_block_1 is clear initially. Wait, no. Wait, in the initial state, red_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 and is clear. So that's good. So if we can just pickup black_block_2 and stack it on red_block_1. But wait, black_block_2 is on the table, clear. So the action would be "stack black_block_2 red_block_1". But to do that, the robotic arm needs to pick up black_block_2, which is possible because it's on the table and clear. Then stack it on red_block_1, which is clear. So that's two actions: pickup black_block_2 and stack it on red_block_1. But wait, but the constraints might complicate things.

But let's check the constraints. There are several constraints here. Let's go through them one by one.

Constraint 1: At least one state where black_block_2 is not clear (i.e., something is on top of it). So during the plan, black_block_2 must have a block on top at some point.

Constraint 2: If black_block_2 is not clear in some state, there must be an earlier state where red_block_1 is not on green_block_1. Wait, red_block_1 starts on green_block_1. So "red_block_1 not on green_block_1" would require moving it. So if we need to have a state where black_block_2 has something on top, then before that, we must have moved red_block_1 off green_block_1. But our goal is to stack black_block_2 on red_block_1 which is on green_block_1. Wait, but the goal is black_block_2 on red_block_1. So red_block_1 remains on green_block_1. So unless the plan requires moving red_block_1. Wait, the goal is to have black_block_2 on red_block_1. So red_block_1 is still on green_block_1. So in that case, red_block_1 is still on green_block_1 in the final state, so the condition "red_block_1 is not on green_block_1" would be false. Therefore, to satisfy constraint 2, if we have a state where black_block_2 is not clear (has a block on top), we need to have an earlier state where red_block_1 was not on green_block_1. But since the final state has red_block_1 on green_block_1 (since we stack black_block_2 on it), how can we have a state where red_block_1 is not on green_block_1? So this suggests that we must move red_block_1 off green_block_1 at some point, and then put it back? Because in the final state, it's back on green_block_1. Hmm, that complicates things.

So for constraint 2, if during the plan we have black_block_2 not clear (something on top of it), then there must be a prior state where red_block_1 was not on green_block_1. But how can we achieve that? Because the final state requires red_block_1 to be under black_block_2, so red_block_1 must be on green_block_1 in the end. So perhaps we need to unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1, do something else, then put it back, then stack black_block_2 on it. But that seems like extra steps. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe during the process of stacking something on black_block_2 (to make it not clear), we first need to have moved red_block_1 off green_block_1. But that would require moving red_block_1, which is on green_block_1. Let's see. So, for example, suppose we unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1, put it down, then later stack it back. But that would create a state where red_block_1 is not on green_block_1. So then, if later we have black_block_2 with a block on top, that would satisfy constraint 2 because we had an earlier state where red_block_1 was not on green_block_1.

But how does that affect the rest of the plan? Let's see.

But the goal is black_block_2 on red_block_1. So if red_block_1 is moved, we need to have it back on green_block_1, then stack black_block_2 on it. But moving red_block_1 would require unstacking it, which is possible since it's clear. Then put it down. Then stack it back on green_block_1. Then stack black_block_2 on it. But that's more steps. But perhaps necessary to satisfy the constraints.

But this is getting complicated. Let's look at other constraints.

Constraint 3: At least one state where red_block_1 is not clear (something on top). The final state has black_block_2 on top of red_block_1, so in the final state, red_block_1 is not clear. So that's satisfied in the final state. But maybe this is already covered by the goal. Wait, the goal is only that black_block_2 is on red_block_1. So the final state would have red_block_1 not clear, but according to the problem statement, the goal is just that specific condition, but other things can be as they are. But in the initial state, red_block_1 is clear. So in the final state, red_block_1 is not clear (since black_block_2 is on it), so constraint 3 is satisfied in the final state. So perhaps that's okay.

Constraint 4: If red_block_1 is not clear in some state, then there must be an earlier state where (yellow_block_1 is not clear AND holding white_block_1). So the final state has red_block_1 not clear. Therefore, before that, there must be a state where yellow_block_1 is not clear and the arm is holding white_block_1.

So how to achieve that? Yellow_block_1 is initially clear. So to make it not clear, we need to stack something on it. Maybe stack white_block_1 on it. But white_block_1 is under white_block_2. So we have to unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1, then unstack white_block_1 from black_block_1, then stack white_block_1 onto yellow_block_1. Then, when yellow_block_1 is not clear (has white_block_1 on top), and while doing that, perhaps the arm is holding white_block_1. Then, during that process, that state exists. Then, later, when we stack black_block_2 onto red_block_1, which makes red_block_1 not clear, the condition is satisfied.

But this seems like a lot of steps. Let's note that.

Constraint 5: At least one state where red_block_1 is not on green_block_1. So we need to have a state where red_block_1 is moved from its initial position. Which would require unstacking it, putting it somewhere else. Then, perhaps putting it back. But as per the goal, red_block_1 needs to be on green_block_1 with black_block_2 on top. So if we move it away and then put it back, that's possible. But how?

Constraint 6: At least one state where white_block_1 is not on the table. But initially, white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1. So it's not on the table. Wait, the initial state says "white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1", so it's not on the table. So this condition is already true in the initial state. So that's automatically satisfied. Wait, but the constraint says "must hold in at least one state", which includes the initial state. So constraint 6 is already satisfied. So no action needed here.

Wait, let me check. The original state: white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1. So white_block_1 is not on the table. So the initial state satisfies "white_block_1 is not on the table". Therefore, constraint 6 is already satisfied. So that's one constraint we don't need to worry about.

Constraint 7: If white_block_1 is not on the table in state s, then at s or after, the arm is holding green_block_1. But in the initial state, white_block_1 is not on the table. So the constraint requires that in the initial state or any state after, the arm holds green_block_1 at some point. So during the plan, the arm must pick up green_block_1 at least once. Because initially, the arm is not holding anything, so the initial state doesn't satisfy holding green_block_1. So the arm needs to hold green_block_1 at some point after the initial state.

Hmm, okay. So we need to include an action where the arm picks up green_block_1. But green_block_1 has red_block_1 on top. So to pick up green_block_1, we need to first clear it. But red_block_1 is on top. So to clear green_block_1, we have to unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1. Which also relates to constraint 2 and 5.

So, moving red_block_1 off green_block_1 would satisfy constraint 5 (since red is not on green), and also allows us to pick up green_block_1 to satisfy constraint 7.

But then we need to put red_block_1 back on green_block_1 to stack black_block_2 on it. So let's see:

1. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1. This requires that red_block_1 is clear (which it is), and the arm is empty. Then, after unstacking, the arm holds red_block_1, and green_block_1 becomes clear.

2. Then, we can putdown red_block_1 on the table. Now, red_block_1 is on the table, and green_block_1 is clear. Then, we can pickup green_block_1 (since it's on table and clear). Then, putdown green_block_1 again? But why? Because we need to have held green_block_1 to satisfy constraint 7. So after putting down green_block_1, but then how do we get red_block_1 back on top? Hmm.

Alternatively, after unstacking red_block_1, put it down. Then pickup green_block_1 (since it's clear now), then put it down again. That way, we have held green_block_1, satisfying constraint 7. Then stack red_block_1 back on green_block_1. Then stack black_block_2 on red_block_1. But this seems like a lot of steps, but maybe necessary.

But let's see. Let's outline a possible plan:

- Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1. Now holding red_block_1.

- Putdown red_block_1 on table. Now red is on table, green is clear.

- Pickup green_block_1. Now holding green_block_1. This action's preconditions: green is on table and clear. Yes. So this satisfies constraint 7 because after the initial state (where white_block_1 is not on table), we hold green_block_1 in this step.

- Then, putdown green_block_1. Now green is back on table, clear.

- Then, stack red_block_1 onto green_block_1. Now red is on green again.

- Then, stack black_block_2 onto red_block_1. Which is the goal.

But wait, after stacking red_block_1 back on green, then red is clear again. So stacking black_block_2 is possible.

But let's check the constraints:

- Constraint 1: black_block_2 must have a block on top at some state. But in the final state, black_block_2 is on red_block_1, so it's not on top of anything else. Wait, no. black_block_2 is on red_block_1, so black_block_2 is clear in the final state. Wait, no. Wait, if black_block_2 is on red_block_1, then red_block_1 has black_block_2 on top, so red_block_1 is not clear. But black_block_2 is on top, so unless there's something on top of black_block_2, it's clear. So the final state has black_block_2 clear. So constraint 1 requires that in some state, there's a block on top of black_block_2. But in the final plan I just outlined, there's no step where black_block_2 has something on top. So that's a problem. So the plan would violate constraint 1.

Therefore, we need to have a state where black_block_2 has a block on top. So perhaps after moving black_block_2 onto red_block_1, we need to stack something else on it. But the goal is only to have black_block_2 on red_block_1. So any block on top of black_block_2 would need to be moved again. But that complicates the plan. So maybe we need to stack another block on black_block_2 and then unstack it.

But how? Let's think. Suppose we do the following:

- Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1.

- Putdown red_block_1.

- Pickup green_block_1 (satisfy constraint 7).

- Putdown green_block_1.

- Stack red_block_1 back onto green_block_1.

- Then, pickup black_block_2 and stack it onto red_block_1. Now, black_block_2 is on red_block_1 (goal achieved), but black_block_2 is clear. But constraint 1 requires a state where black_block_2 is not clear. So we need to stack something on top of black_block_2. Let's choose, say, white_block_2. But white_block_2 is currently on top of white_block_1, which is on black_block_1. So to get white_block_2, we need to unstack it.

So steps after stacking black_block_2 onto red_block_1:

- Unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1.

- Stack white_block_2 onto black_block_2. Now black_block_2 is not clear (satisfies constraint 1), and then maybe unstack it again.

But then, we have to make sure that in the final state, black_block_2 is on red_block_1 and is clear. So perhaps stack white_block_2 onto black_block_2, then unstack it again. But that's two more steps. Let's see.

So the plan would be:

1. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1. (Now holding red_block_1, green_block_1 is clear.)

2. Putdown red_block_1. (red on table.)

3. Pickup green_block_1. (Holding green_block_1, which satisfies constraint 7.)

4. Putdown green_block_1. (Green back on table.)

5. Pickup red_block_1. (Holding red_block_1.)

6. Stack red_block_1 onto green_block_1. (Now red is back on green, which is needed for the goal.)

7. Pickup black_block_2. (Holding it.)

8. Stack black_block_2 onto red_block_1. (Goal achieved. Now black_block_2 is clear.)

But this plan doesn't satisfy constraint 1 (black_block_2 must have something on top in some state). So we need to add steps.

So after step 8, stack something on black_block_2. Let's choose white_block_2.

But white_block_2 is on white_block_1, which is on black_block_1. So steps:

9. Unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1. (But to do that, need to unstack white_block_2 first. White_block_2 is clear in the initial state. So we can unstack it: unstack white_block_2 white_block_1. Now holding white_block_2.)

10. Stack white_block_2 onto black_block_2. (Now black_block_2 has white_block_2 on top. This satisfies constraint 1.)

11. Now, but we need to have the final state with black_block_2 on red_block_1. So we need to unstack white_block_2 from black_block_2 and put it somewhere else.

But that's adding more steps. So steps 9-11 would be:

9. Unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1.

10. Stack white_block_2 onto black_block_2. (Now black_block_2 is not clear, satisfying constraint 1.)

11. Unstack white_block_2 from black_block_2. (Now holding white_block_2 again.)

12. Putdown white_block_2. (Now it's on the table.)

But this makes the plan longer, but necessary to satisfy the constraint.

But now, let's check other constraints. For example, constraint 2: If black_block_2 is not clear (in step 10), then there must be an earlier state where red_block_1 is not on green_block_1. Which in this plan, step 2 (putdown red_block_1) satisfies that. So that's okay.

Constraint 3 is satisfied in the final state (red_block_1 has black_block_2 on top).

Constraint 4: If red_block_1 is not clear (which it is in step 6 onwards), there must be an earlier state where yellow_block_1 is not clear and the arm is holding white_block_1. Wait, in this plan, have we made yellow_block_1 not clear? Because in the initial state, yellow_block_1 is clear. So we need to stack something on it. For example, we need to stack a block on yellow_block_1 at some point, and while doing that, the arm is holding white_block_1.

Hmm, this is another constraint. So constraint 4 says that whenever red_block_1 is not clear (like in steps 6,7,8,10, etc.), there must have been an earlier state where yellow_block_1 is not clear and the arm is holding white_block_1.

But in the current plan, we haven't done anything with yellow_block_1. So this constraint is not satisfied. So we need to add steps to stack something on yellow_block_1 and also have the arm holding white_block_1 at some point.

So how to achieve that. Let's think.

We need to have a state where yellow_block_1 has a block on top (so it's not clear), and the arm is holding white_block_1. So perhaps unstack white_block_1 from black_block_1 (but white_block_1 has white_block_2 on top initially. So first, unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1, then unstack white_block_1 from black_block_1, then stack white_block_1 onto yellow_block_1. Then, while holding white_block_1, we can stack it onto yellow_block_1, which would make yellow_block_1 not clear. So during that process, the arm is holding white_block_1, and yellow_block_1 is not clear after stacking.

So inserting these steps into the plan.

Let's adjust the plan.

Let's start by dealing with the white_block_2 and white_block_1.

Original initial state:

black_block_1 has white_block_1, which has white_block_2.

So steps:

1. Unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1. (Now holding white_block_2.)

2. Putdown white_block_2. (On table. Now white_block_1 is clear.)

3. Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_1. (Holding white_block_1.)

4. Stack white_block_1 onto yellow_block_1. (Now yellow_block_1 has white_block_1 on top. So yellow_block_1 is not clear. And during step 3, the arm is holding white_block_1. So step 3 and 4 create the required state for constraint 4: yellow_block_1 not clear and holding white_block_1.

Then proceed with the previous steps for red_block_1 and green_block_1.

So after step 4:

5. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1. (Holding red_block_1.)

6. Putdown red_block_1. (Now red is on table. This satisfies constraint 5.)

7. Pickup green_block_1. (Holding green_block_1. Satisfies constraint 7.)

8. Putdown green_block_1. (Green is back on table.)

9. Pickup red_block_1. (Holding red_block_1.)

10. Stack red_block_1 onto green_block_1. (Now red is back on green.)

11. Pickup black_block_2. (Holding it.)

12. Stack black_block_2 onto red_block_1. (Goal achieved. But black_block_2 is clear.)

13. Now, need to have something on top of black_block_2. So unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1. Wait, but white_block_1 is on yellow_block_1. So to get something to stack on black_block_2.

Wait, after step 4, white_block_1 is on yellow_block_1. So to use that block, perhaps:

13. Unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (Holding white_block_1.)

14. Stack white_block_1 onto black_block_2. (Now black_block_2 has white_block_1 on top. So constraint 1 is satisfied.)

But then, the final state would have black_block_2 on red_block_1 and white_block_1 on black_block_2. But the goal only requires black_block_2 on red_block_1. So that's acceptable. But do we need to remove white_block_1 from black_block_2? The problem statement says the final goal is only "black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1", so other blocks can be wherever. But the user hasn't specified that other blocks must be in certain positions, so as long as black_block_2 is on red_block_1, the goal is satisfied.

But then, the final state would have white_block_1 on black_block_2. But that's okay. However, this adds steps. Let's check constraints.

But this plan now includes:

- Step 3: Holding white_block_1.

- Step 4: Stack white_block_1 on yellow_block_1, making yellow_block_1 not clear. So when red_block_1 is not clear (steps 10 onwards), there was an earlier state (step 4) where yellow_block_1 was not clear and step 3 where the arm was holding white_block_1. So constraint 4 is satisfied.

Constraint 1 is satisfied in step 14 where black_block_2 has white_block_1 on top.

Constraint 2: When black_block_2 is not clear (step 14), there must be an earlier state where red_block_1 was not on green_block_1. That's step 6 (red_block_1 on table). So that's satisfied.

Other constraints:

Constraint 8: black_block_2 must not be on the table in some state. That's satisfied once we stack it on red_block_1 (step 12). Then in step 14, it's still not on the table. So constraint 8 is satisfied.

Constraint 9: At least one state where there's a block on top of yellow_block_1. Step 4: white_block_1 is on yellow_block_1. So satisfied.

Constraint 10: At least one state where either holding white_block_2 or white_block_1 is on the table. Initially, white_block_1 is not on the table. But in step 2, we put white_block_2 on the table. So in step 2 and after, white_block_2 is on the table. Wait, no: in step 2, we putdown white_block_2. So after step 2, white_block_2 is on the table. So the condition "you are holding white_block_2" is true during step 1, and "white_block_2 is on the table" is true from step 2 onwards. So constraint 10 is satisfied because white_block_2 is on the table in step 2 and beyond.

Constraint 11: At least one state where green_block_1 is not clear. Steps 10 onwards: red_block_1 is on green_block_1, so green_block_1 is not clear. So that's satisfied.

Constraint 12: If green_block_1 is not clear (step 10 onwards), then black_block_1 must be on yellow_block_1 at s or after. Wait, in step 4, white_block_1 is on yellow_block_1. So black_block_1 is on the table. So this constraint would require that when green_block_1 is not clear (step 10), there must be a state where black_block_1 is on yellow_block_1. But in our plan, black_block_1 is on the table. So this is a problem.

Ah, this is another constraint. Let me recheck.

Constraint 12: If green_block_1 is not clear in state s, then black_block_1 must be on yellow_block_1 at s or after. So whenever green_block_1 has a block on it (which is from step 10 onwards), there must be a state (current or later) where black_block_1 is on yellow_block_1.

In our current plan, from step 10 onwards, green_block_1 has red_block_1 on it. So we need to have black_block_1 on yellow_block_1 at some point from step 10 onwards. But currently, black_block_1 is on the table. So we need to stack black_block_1 on yellow_block_1.

So how to achieve that. Let's adjust the plan.

After step 12 (stack black_block_2 on red_block_1), perhaps:

13. Pickup black_block_1. (It's on the table and clear.)

14. Stack black_block_1 on yellow_block_1. (Now yellow_block_1 has black_block_1 on top.)

This satisfies the constraint: when green_block_1 is not clear (from step 10 onwards), we have black_block_1 on yellow_block_1 in step 14.

But then, we have to do this after step 10. So this adds steps.

But after step 14, what about the other steps? Let's see.

So updated plan steps:

1. Unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1.

2. Putdown white_block_2.

3. Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_1.

4. Stack white_block_1 onto yellow_block_1.

5. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1.

6. Putdown red_block_1.

7. Pickup green_block_1.

8. Putdown green_block_1.

9. Pickup red_block_1.

10. Stack red_block_1 onto green_block_1.

11. Pickup black_block_2.

12. Stack black_block_2 onto red_block_1.

13. Pickup black_block_1.

14. Stack black_block_1 onto yellow_block_1.

15. Unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (But yellow_block_1 now has black_block_1. So white_block_1 is on yellow_block_1, but after step 14, yellow_block_1 has black_block_1. Wait, no. Step 4: white_block_1 is stacked on yellow_block_1. Then step 14: stack black_block_1 on yellow_block_1. But to stack black_block_1 on yellow_block_1, yellow_block_1 must be clear. But after step 4, yellow_block_1 has white_block_1 on it. So step 14 is not possible unless we first unstack white_block_1.

Wait, this is a problem. Because after step 4, yellow_block_1 has white_block_1. So to stack black_block_1 on yellow_block_1 (step 14), we need to first clear yellow_block_1. So:

After step 4:

5. Unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (Holding white_block_1.)

6. Putdown white_block_1. (Now white_block_1 is on table.)

Then proceed with unstacking red_block_1.

But this complicates the plan. Let me reorganize.

Alternative approach to satisfy constraint 12:

After step 10 (stack red_block_1 onto green_block_1), we need to have black_block_1 on yellow_block_1 at some point. So perhaps:

After step 10:

11. Unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (Holding white_block_1.)

12. Putdown white_block_1. (Now white_block_1 is on table.)

13. Pickup black_block_1. (On table, clear.)

14. Stack black_block_1 onto yellow_block_1. (Now yellow_block_1 has black_block_1, satisfying constraint 12.)

Then continue with stacking black_block_2 on red_block_1.

But this adds steps. Let's outline:

1. Unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1.

2. Putdown white_block_2.

3. Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_1.

4. Stack white_block_1 onto yellow_block_1. (Now yellow_block_1 has white_block_1.)

5. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1.

6. Putdown red_block_1.

7. Pickup green_block_1.

8. Putdown green_block_1.

9. Pickup red_block_1.

10. Stack red_block_1 onto green_block_1.

11. Unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (Now holding white_block_1.)

12. Putdown white_block_1. (On table.)

13. Pickup black_block_1.

14. Stack black_block_1 onto yellow_block_1. (Now yellow_block_1 has black_block_1.)

15. Pickup black_block_2.

16. Stack black_block_2 onto red_block_1. (Goal achieved.)

Now, after step 14, black_block_1 is on yellow_block_1. So from step 10 (when green_block_1 is not clear) onwards, we have step 14 where black_block_1 is on yellow_block_1. So constraint 12 is satisfied.

Now, let's check other constraints.

Constraint 13: At least one state where white_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1. In our plan, white_block_2 is on the table (step 2). So white_block_2 is not on green_block_1. So this is satisfied in steps 2 and beyond. So constraint 13 is satisfied.

Constraint 14: If white_block_2 is not on green_block_1 (which is always true after step 2), then at that state or after, green_block_1 is clear. But after step 10, green_block_1 has red_block_1, so it's not clear. So this violates constraint 14. Because whenever white_block_2 is not on green_block_1 (which is true from step 2 onwards), in every state, green_block_1 must be clear either at that state or after. But after step 10, green_block_1 has red_block_1 on it, so it's not clear. So this is a problem.

So how to satisfy constraint 14. The constraint says that if white_block_2 is not on green_block_1 in state s, then in s or after, green_block_1 must be clear.

But in our plan, after step 10, green_block_1 has red_block_1, so it's not clear. But from step 2 onwards, white_block_2 is not on green_block_1. So in steps 10 onwards, green_block_1 is not clear. So this violates constraint 14. Therefore, we need to ensure that whenever white_block_2 is not on green_block_1, green_block_1 is clear either at that state or after. But after step 10, green_block_1 is not clear, which violates this.

So to satisfy constraint 14, we need to ensure that after moving white_block_2 off green_block_1 (if it ever was there), green_block_1 is cleared at some point. But in the initial state, white_block_2 is on white_block_1, not on green_block_1. So white_block_2 is not on green_block_1 from the start. So the condition applies to all states. Therefore, in every state where white_block_2 is not on green_block_1 (which is always true in the entire plan), green_block_1 must be clear at some point after that state.

Wait, the constraint says: If expression "white_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1" holds in some state s, then expression "green_block_1 is clear" must hold at s or after.

Since white_block_2 is never on green_block_1 in any state of the plan, the antecedent is true for all states. Therefore, in every state s in the plan, the expression "white_block_2 is not on green_block_1" holds, so we must have that in each such state s, green_block_1 is clear either at s or after.

But in our plan, after step 10, green_block_1 has red_block_1 on it. So for states after step 10, the condition "white_block_2 is not on green_block_1" holds, but green_block_1 is not clear. So we need to ensure that after step 10, green_block_1 is cleared at some point. But the goal requires red_block_1 to be on green_block_1. So we can't clear it. This is a contradiction.

Hmm, this seems like a problem. How to resolve this?

Wait, perhaps I misread the constraint. Let me check again.

Constraint 14: If "white_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1" holds in some state s, then "green_block_1 is clear" must hold at s or after.

But the initial state has white_block_2 not on green_block_1. So for all states in the plan, since white_block_2 is never moved to green_block_1, the antecedent is always true. So in every state s, the consequent must hold in s or after. That is, for every state in the plan, green_block_1 must be clear either at that state or at some state after.

But in our plan, after step 10, green_block_1 has red_block_1 on it, so it's not clear. So from step 10 onwards, in all those states, the condition requires that green_block_1 becomes clear again. But the goal requires red_block_1 to be on green_block_1. So we can't clear it in the final state. Therefore, the plan must ensure that after step 10 (stack red_block_1 on green_block_1), there's a step where green_block_1 is cleared again, but then the goal requires red_block_1 to be on green_block_1. This is impossible unless we move red_block_1 again, which complicates the plan.

This is a major issue. So the constraints make the problem very challenging.

Let me think of another approach. Maybe instead of stacking red_block_1 back on green_block_1, we leave it somewhere else and find another way to achieve the goal. But the goal is to have black_block_2 on red_block_1. If red_block_1 is not on green_block_1, where would it be? For example, can we stack red_block_1 on another block and then stack black_block_2 on top?

But then, the goal requires black_block_2 to be on red_block_1, which is not on green_block_1. But according to the problem statement, the goal is only that black_block_2 is on red_block_1, regardless of where red_block_1 is. Wait, but the initial state and the problem's goal don't specify where red_block_1 is. The goal is only about black_block_2 being on red_block_1. So maybe red_block_1 can be on another block, and then black_block_2 is stacked on it.

But let's read the problem's goal again: "black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1". There's no mention of where red_block_1 is. So red_block_1 can be on any block or the table as long as black_block_2 is on it.

But in the initial state, red_block_1 is on green_block_1. So if we can move red_block_1 to another location and stack black_block_2 on it, that would satisfy the goal. However, the constraints complicate things.

But let's explore this possibility. Suppose we don't stack red_block_1 back on green_block_1, but instead leave it on the table and stack black_block_2 on it. Then red_block_1 is on the table, and black_block_2 is on red_block_1. This satisfies the goal. But does this violate any constraints?

Let's check constraint 14 again. If we leave red_block_1 on the table, then green_block_1 is clear. So in that case, after moving red_block_1 to the table, green_block_1 is clear. So during the steps after moving red_block_1 to the table, green_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint 14. But then the problem is that the goal requires black_block_2 to be on red_block_1, which is on the table. But the goal doesn't specify where red_block_1 is, so that's acceptable.

But let's see if this approach can work.

Alternative plan:

1. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1. (Holding red_block_1.)

2. Putdown red_block_1 on the table.

3. Pickup green_block_1. (Holding green_block_1. Satisfies constraint 7.)

4. Putdown green_block_1. (Now green_block_1 is clear.)

5. Pickup black_block_2. (Holding it.)

6. Stack black_block_2 onto red_block_1. (Now black_block_2 is on red_block_1, which is on the table. Goal achieved.)

But then, we need to satisfy all other constraints.

Constraint 1: black_block_2 must have a block on top in some state. In this plan, black_block_2 is clear in the final state. So need to stack something on it and then remove it.

So steps 7-9:

7. Unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1. (Holding white_block_2.)

8. Stack white_block_2 onto black_block_2. (Now black_block_2 is not clear. Satisfies constraint 1.)

9. Unstack white_block_2 from black_block_2. (Holding white_block_2.)

10. Putdown white_block_2.

But this adds steps, but necessary.

Now, check other constraints.

Constraint 2: When black_block_2 is not clear (step 8), there must be an earlier state where red_block_1 is not on green_block_1. Step 2 (red on table) satisfies that.

Constraint 3: red_block_1 not clear in some state. In step 6, red_block_1 has black_block_2 on top. So satisfied.

Constraint 4: When red_block_1 is not clear (step 6 onwards), there must be an earlier state with yellow_block_1 not clear and holding white_block_1. But in this plan, we haven't done anything with yellow_block_1 or white_block_1. So this constraint is not satisfied. Therefore, this approach is invalid.

So this approach fails constraint 4.

So we need to handle yellow_block_1 and white_block_1 as well.

This suggests that the only way to satisfy all constraints is to have a rather long plan that involves moving several blocks around to meet all the conditions.

Let's try to outline such a plan.

1. Unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1. (Holding white_block_2.)

2. Putdown white_block_2. (On table. Now white_block_1 is clear.)

3. Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_1. (Holding white_block_1.)

4. Stack white_block_1 onto yellow_block_1. (Now yellow_block_1 is not clear. This helps with constraint 4.)

5. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1. (Holding red_block_1.)

6. Putdown red_block_1. (On table. Now green_block_1 is clear. Satisfies constraint 5.)

7. Pickup green_block_1. (Holding green_block_1. Satisfies constraint 7.)

8. Putdown green_block_1. (Back on table. Now green_block_1 is clear.)

9. Pickup red_block_1. (Holding red_block_1.)

10. Stack red_block_1 onto green_block_1. (Now green_block_1 has red_block_1. Not clear.)

11. Unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (Holding white_block_1. Now yellow_block_1 is clear.)

12. Putdown white_block_1. (On table.)

13. Pickup black_block_1. (Holding it.)

14. Stack black_block_1 onto yellow_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 12: when green_block_1 is not clear (step 10 onwards), black_block_1 is on yellow_block_1 now.)

15. Pickup black_block_2. (Holding it.)

16. Stack black_block_2 onto red_block_1. (Goal achieved. Now red_block_1 is not clear.)

17. Unstack white_block_2 from table (wait, white_block_2 was put down in step 2.)

18. Pickup white_block_2. (Holding it.)

19. Stack white_block_2 onto black_block_2. (Satisfies constraint 1: black_block_2 not clear.)

20. Unstack white_block_2 from black_block_2. (Holding white_block_2.)

21. Putdown white_block_2. (Back on table.)

But this plan is getting very long, but let's check constraints.

Constraint 1: Satisfied in step 19.

Constraint 2: In step 19, black_block_2 is not clear. Earlier state step 6 where red_block_1 is not on green_block_1 (it's on table).

Constraint 3: Satisfied in step 16 onwards.

Constraint 4: When red_block_1 is not clear (step 16), there must be an earlier state with yellow_block_1 not clear (step 4) and holding white_block_1 (step 3 and 4). So yes.

Constraint 5: Satisfied in step 6.

Constraint 6: Already satisfied initially.

Constraint 7: Satisfied in step 7.

Constraint 8: Satisfied when black_block_2 is stacked in step 16.

Constraint 9: At least one state where yellow_block_1 is not clear. Steps 4 and 14.

Constraint 10: At least one state holding white_block_2 (steps 1, 18-20) or white_block_1 on table (step 12 onwards). Both conditions are true.

Constraint 11: At least one state where green_block_1 is not clear (steps 10 onwards).

Constraint 12: When green_block_1 is not clear (steps 10 onwards), black_block_1 is on yellow_block_1 in step 14 onwards.

Constraint 13: white_block_2 is not on green_block_1 in any state. Satisfied.

Constraint 14: In every state where white_block_2 is not on green_block_1 (which is all states), green_block_1 must be clear in that state or after. But after step 10, green_block_1 is not clear. However, after step 6, green_block_1 is clear (step 6 is after step 5 where red_block_1 is put down). Then in step 9, when red_block_1 is picked up, green_block_1 is clear in step 8 (after putdown). But after step 10, green_block_1 is not clear. So for states after step 10, green_block_1 is not clear. So according to constraint 14, in each of those states, green_block_1 must become clear again. But after step 10, green_block_1 has red_block_1 and remains so until the end. So this violates constraint 14.

Ah, this is a problem again. So how to resolve this?

Perhaps we need to unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1 again after step 10, then put it back. But that's adding even more steps.

Let's try:

After step 16:

17. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1. (Holding red_block_1.)

18. Putdown red_block_1. (Green_block_1 is clear again.)

19. Pickup red_block_1. (Holding it.)

20. Stack red_block_1 onto green_block_1. (Now green_block_1 is not clear.)

21. Now, stack black_block_2 onto red_block_1. (But black_block_2 is already on red_block_1 in step 16. So this is redundant. So perhaps after step 16, we can't do that.)

This approach doesn't work.

Alternative idea: After step 10, stack red_block_1 on green_block_1, but then unstack it again to clear green_block_1, and then put it back.

But this would require:

After step 10 (red_block_1 on green_block_1):

11. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1. (Holding red_block_1.)

12. Putdown red_block_1. (Green_block_1 is clear.)

13. Pickup red_block_1. (Holding it.)

14. Stack red_block_1 onto green_block_1. (Now green_block_1 is not clear.)

But this is redundant and doesn't help.

Alternatively, after step 10, unstack red_block_1 and leave it on the table, then stack black_block_2 on it. But that would require moving black_block_2 onto red_block_1 on the table, which is allowed.

But then, the goal is satisfied, but green_block_1 is clear in the final state, satisfying constraint 14.

Let me outline this:

Steps up to step 10:

1. Unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1.

2. Putdown white_block_2.

3. Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_1.

4. Stack white_block_1 onto yellow_block_1.

5. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1.

6. Putdown red_block_1.

7. Pickup green_block_1.

8. Putdown green_block_1.

9. Pickup red_block_1.

10. Stack red_block_1 onto green_block_1.

11. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1. (Holding red_block_1.)

12. Putdown red_block_1. (On table. Green_block_1 is clear.)

13. Pickup black_block_2.

14. Stack black_block_2 onto red_block_1. (Goal achieved. Now red_block_1 is on table, black_block_2 is on it.)

15. Now, to satisfy constraint 1, stack something on black_block_2.

16. Pickup white_block_2.

17. Stack white_block_2 onto black_block_2. (Now black_block_2 is not clear.)

18. Unstack white_block_2 from black_block_2.

19. Putdown white_block_2.

Now, check constraints:

Constraint 14: In every state s where white_block_2 is not on green_block_1 (all states), green_block_1 must be clear at s or after. After step 12, green_block_1 is clear. So for states after step 12, green_block_1 is clear. So constraint 14 is satisfied. For states before step 12, such as steps 10-11, green_block_1 is not clear. So during those steps, we need to ensure that after step 12, green_block_1 becomes clear. Which it does. So for example, in step 10, green_block_1 is not clear, but after step 12, it becomes clear. So constraint 14 is satisfied.

Constraint 12: When green_block_1 is not clear (steps 5-6, 9-11), there must be a state where black_block_1 is on yellow_block_1. In this plan, after step 4, white_block_1 is on yellow_block_1, but black_block_1 is on the table. So to satisfy constraint 12, we need to stack black_block_1 on yellow_block_1 during the steps when green_block_1 is not clear.

So perhaps after step 4, we need to stack black_block_1 on yellow_block_1.

Let's adjust the plan:

After step 4:

5. Unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (Holding white_block_1.)

6. Putdown white_block_1. (On table.)

7. Pickup black_block_1.

8. Stack black_block_1 onto yellow_block_1. (Now yellow_block_1 has black_block_1.)

Then proceed with unstacking red_block_1.

But this adds steps. So updated plan:

1. Unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1.

2. Putdown white_block_2.

3. Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_1.

4. Stack white_block_1 onto yellow_block_1.

5. Unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (Holding white_block_1.)

6. Putdown white_block_1.

7. Pickup black_block_1.

8. Stack black_block_1 onto yellow_block_1. (Now yellow_block_1 has black_block_1.)

9. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1.

10. Putdown red_block_1.

11. Pickup green_block_1.

12. Putdown green_block_1.

13. Pickup red_block_1.

14. Stack red_block_1 onto green_block_1.

15. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1.

16. Putdown red_block_1.

17. Pickup black_block_2.

18. Stack black_block_2 onto red_block_1.

19. Pickup white_block_2.

20. Stack white_block_2 onto black_block_2.

21. Unstack white_block_2 from black_block_2.

22. Putdown white_block_2.

Now, let's check constraints:

Constraint 12: When green_block_1 is not clear (steps 9-10, 13-15), black_block_1 is on yellow_block_1 from step 8 onwards. So satisfied.

Constraint 14: After step 16, green_block_1 is clear. So for states before step 16 where green_block_1 is not clear (steps 14-15), after step 16, green_block_1 is clear. For states after step 16, green_block_1 is clear. So constraint 14 is satisfied.

Other constraints:

Constraint 4: When red_block_1 is not clear (step 18 onwards), there must be an earlier state where yellow_block_1 is not clear and holding white_block_1. Steps 4-5: white_block_1 was on yellow_block_1 (step 4), and during step 3-4, holding white_block_1. So this is satisfied.

This seems to satisfy all constraints. However, this plan is very long, but given the complexity of the constraints, it's necessary.

Finally, let's check if the plan is optimal. Are there any redundant steps? For example, steps 5 and 6 (unstack and putdown white_block_1) are needed to clear yellow_block_1 to stack black_block_1. But this is necessary for constraint 12.

So this seems to be the minimal plan given the constraints. However, I might have missed a more optimal approach, but given the time constraints, this seems like a feasible solution.
