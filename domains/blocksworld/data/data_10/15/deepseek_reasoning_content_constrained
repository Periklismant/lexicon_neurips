Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld problem. The goal is to get green_block_2 on top of orange_block_1. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy along the way. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the required goal.

Initial State:
- orange_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_1 on top of it (and purple is clear).
- brown_block_1 has red_block_1 on top (red is clear).
- green_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top (grey is clear).
- green_block_2 is on the table and clear.
- The arm is empty.

Goal:
- green_block_2 must be on orange_block_1.

Constraints:
There are several constraints here. Let me list them to make sure I address each one.

1. At some point, purple_block_1 must have a block on it. Also, whenever that happens, before that state, either brown_block_1 is clear or green_block_2 is on purple_block_1.

2. Purple_block_1 must be on the table at some point. And before that, either orange_block_1 is on grey_block_1 or the arm is holding orange_block_1.

3. Green_block_2 must have a block on top at some point. Before that, either the arm is holding green_block_1 or grey_block_1 is on orange_block_1.

4. The arm must hold green_block_2 at some point, and after that, it must hold purple_block_1 at the same time or later.

5. The arm must hold purple_block_1 at some point, and before that, it must have held red_block_1.

6. Brown_block_1 must have a block on top at some point. When that happens, either grey_block_1 is on orange_block_1 or orange_block_1 is not on the table (i.e., moved).

7. Green_block_1 is not on brown_block_1 at some point. Then, either green_block_1 is not on the table or brown_block_1 isn't either.

8. Red_block_1 must be on grey_block_1 at some point.

9. Either orange_block_1 is on grey_block_1 or green_block_1 is clear in some state.

10. Green_block_1 must be on grey_block_1 at some point.

This is a lot. Let's see how to approach this.

First, the main goal is green_block_2 on orange_block_1. To do that, we need to stack green_block_2 onto orange_block_1. But orange_block_1 currently has purple_block_1 on top. So, we need to move purple_block_1 first.

But moving purple_block_1 requires unstacking it from orange_block_1. So, action unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1. Then put it down or stack it somewhere else.

Wait, but the constraints require that purple_block_1 must be on the table at some point. So, maybe after unstacking, we put it down. That would satisfy the constraint of purple_block_1 being on the table. But when we do that, according to constraint 2, before that state, either orange_block_1 is on grey_block_1 or the arm is holding orange_block_1. But in the initial state, orange_block_1 is on the table. To make orange_block_1 be on grey_block_1, we'd need to stack it there, but that's not part of the goal. Alternatively, the arm could be holding orange_block_1. But to hold orange_block_1, we need to pick it up from the table. However, orange_block_1 currently has purple_block_1 on top. Wait, no. The initial state says orange_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_1 on top. So orange_block_1 is on the table, and purple is on top. So orange_block_1 is not clear. Therefore, you can't pick up orange_block_1 because there's a block (purple) on top of it. So, the only way to make orange_block_1 clear is to remove purple_block_1. So, the first step would be unstack purple_block_1 from orange_block_1.

But before that, let's check the constraints. When we unstack purple_block_1 from orange_block_1, the preconditions are that purple_block_1 is clear (which it is), and the arm is empty (which it is). After unstacking, the arm is holding purple_block_1, orange_block_1 becomes clear.

But constraint 2 says that when purple_block_1 is put on the table (which would be after putting it down), there must be an earlier state where either orange_block_1 is on grey_block_1 or the arm is holding orange_block_1. But in this case, if we unstack purple_block_1 and put it down, then when we putdown purple_block_1, we need to have in an earlier state that either orange is on grey or the arm is holding orange. But in the process of unstacking purple, the arm is holding purple, not orange. So that might not satisfy constraint 2. Therefore, we need to make sure that before putting purple on the table, either orange is on grey_block_1 or the arm holds orange_block_1.

But how can we hold orange_block_1? To pick it up, it must be clear. But initially, it's under purple. So after moving purple_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear. Then we can pick up orange_block_1. But why would we need to? Because constraint 2 requires that when we put purple on the table, in an earlier state, we have to have held orange or have orange on grey. So, maybe after moving purple, we can pick up orange and put it down again? But that's unnecessary steps. Alternatively, perhaps we can stack orange on grey_block_1. But that's not required for the goal. But the constraint just requires that in some state, either orange is on grey or the arm holds orange. So, maybe during the process, after moving purple, we can pick up orange and then put it back. Let's see.

Wait, the constraint says: If purple is on the table in some state, then there must be an earlier state where either orange is on grey or the arm is holding orange. So, if we put purple on the table, then before that, we need to have either held orange or have orange on grey. But in the process of moving purple, the first step is to unstack purple (arm holds purple), then put it down. So, when we putdown purple, the previous state before that would have the arm holding purple. But how to get a state where the arm is holding orange before putting purple down? That's not possible unless we do something else. Hmm. So maybe we need to, after unstacking purple, instead of putting it down immediately, we stack it somewhere else. But where? For example, stack purple on brown_block_1. But brown_block_1 has red_block_1 on top, which is clear. Wait, brown_block_1 has red_block_1 on it. So brown_block_1 is not clear. So we can't stack on brown_block_1 unless we remove red_block_1 first.

Alternatively, stack purple on green_block_2. But green_block_2 is clear, so that's possible. Then, after stacking purple on green_block_2, we can then pick up green_block_2. Wait, but the goal is green_block_2 on orange_block_1. So if we stack purple on green_block_2, then green_block_2 has purple on top, which would need to be moved again. That complicates things. Alternatively, maybe stack purple on grey_block_1. But grey_block_1 is on green_block_1. So, after stacking purple on grey_block_1, the green_block_1 has grey and purple. But maybe that's okay. Let me think.

But perhaps there's a better way. Let's see the constraints again. We need to have purple on the table at some point. So maybe after unstacking purple from orange, put it down. But that would require that before that state, either orange is on grey or the arm is holding orange. Since in the process of putting purple down, the arm was holding purple, not orange, then we need to have a prior state where the arm held orange. How can we do that?

Wait, perhaps after unstacking purple, we need to do something else before putting it down. For example, after unstacking purple, we can put it down, but then we need to handle constraint 2. So, if we putdown purple_block_1, then the constraint requires that in an earlier state, either orange is on grey or the arm is holding orange. But since we haven't done anything with orange yet, perhaps we need to pick up orange_block_1 after putting purple down. Wait, but after putting purple down, orange_block_1 is clear. So we can pick up orange_block_1. Then, if we hold orange_block_1, that would satisfy the condition for the earlier state. So, perhaps:

1. unstack purple_block_1 from orange_block_1 (now holding purple)
2. putdown purple_block_1 (now purple is on the table. But at this point, the state where purple is on the table (step 2) needs to have an earlier state where either orange is on grey or the arm is holding orange. But in step 1, the arm was holding purple, not orange. So this doesn't satisfy the constraint. Therefore, putting down purple after unstacking would not satisfy constraint 2. Therefore, we need another approach.

Alternative approach: After unstacking purple, instead of putting it down, maybe stack it on another block. For example, stack purple on green_block_2. Then, to stack purple on green_block_2, green_block_2 must be clear (which it is). So:

1. unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1
2. stack purple_block_1 green_block_2

Now, after stacking, purple is on green_block_2. Then, green_block_2 is not clear. But the goal is to put green_block_2 on orange_block_1. So we need to move green_block_2. But green_block_2 is on the table, so we can pick it up if it's clear. But after stacking purple on it, green_block_2 is not clear. So we would need to unstack purple from green_block_2 first. That adds steps. Not ideal.

Alternatively, stack purple_block_1 on red_block_1. But red_block_1 is on brown_block_1 and is clear. So stacking purple on red would make red not clear. Then, to get red, we'd need to unstack purple first. But maybe that's acceptable. Let's see:

1. unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1
2. stack purple_block_1 red_block_1

Now, purple is on red, which is on brown. Then, when we need to get green_block_2 on orange, orange is clear. But this may complicate other steps.

But the main point is that we need to satisfy constraint 2: when purple is on the table, there must have been a prior state where orange is on grey or the arm held orange. So maybe instead of putting purple on the table, we need to find a way to have purple on the table later, after ensuring that orange was held or on grey.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving purple, we can pick up orange_block_1. Let's think:

Steps:

1. unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1 (arm holds purple)
2. putdown purple_block_1 (now purple is on table)
3. pickup orange_block_1 (since it's clear now)
4. ... then do something with orange_block_1.

But step 2 (putdown purple) requires that before that, either orange was on grey or the arm held orange. But in this sequence, step 2 is after step 1 and before step 3. So step 3 (holding orange) is after step 2. Therefore, step 2 (putdown purple) doesn't have a prior state where the arm held orange. Therefore, this violates constraint 2.

So, this approach won't work. Therefore, perhaps we need to, after unstacking purple, instead of putting it down, we need to hold it and then do something else that allows us to hold orange_block_1 before putting purple down.

Wait, but how? If we unstack purple, we're holding it. To hold orange_block_1, we need to putdown purple first. But then we can pick up orange_block_1. But that brings us back to the previous problem where putting purple down requires that before that, we had held orange or placed it on grey.

Alternative idea: Maybe after unstacking purple, we stack it on another block, and then later put it on the table. Let's say:

1. unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1 (hold purple)
2. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1 (grey is on green_block_1, which is clear)
   - Now, purple is on grey. But green_block_1 has grey, which has purple. Then, to get purple on the table later, we need to unstack it. But this adds steps. But maybe during that process, we can satisfy the constraints.

Wait, but constraint 2 requires that purple is on the table at some point. So even if we stack it on grey, we need to eventually put it down. Let's say:

1. unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1
2. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1
3. unstack purple_block_1 grey_block_1
4. putdown purple_block_1

But then, when we putdown purple (step 4), we need to have in an earlier state (before step 4) that either orange is on grey or the arm held orange. Let's check the steps:

In step 4, purple is put down. Before step 4, in step 3, we unstack purple from grey. So before step 4, the arm holds purple. But in step 3, the arm is holding purple after unstacking. Then in step 4, we put it down. The only prior states are steps 1-3. So how to satisfy the condition for step 4?

We need to have a state before step 4 where either orange is on grey or the arm holds orange. So perhaps between steps 3 and 4, we need to pick up orange_block_1. But after step 3, the arm is holding purple. So we need to put it down first. Wait, this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can manipulate orange_block_1 before moving purple. But orange_block_1 is under purple, so we can't pick it up until purple is moved. So the first step must be unstacking purple.

Alternative plan: Let's consider that constraint 2 requires that when purple is on the table, there must be an earlier state where the arm held orange or orange is on grey. So perhaps, after unstacking purple and before putting it down, we need to have the arm hold orange. But how? Let's see:

1. unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1 (hold purple)
2. putdown purple_block_1 (now purple on table)
3. pickup orange_block_1 (since it's clear now)
4. stack orange_block_1 grey_block_1 (now orange is on grey)
5. ... then proceed to move green_block_2 onto orange_block_1.

But step 2 (putdown purple) occurs before step 3. So in step 2, we need to have an earlier state where orange is on grey or the arm held orange. But prior to step 2, the only step is step 1 (holding purple). So this doesn't satisfy the constraint. Therefore, step 2 (putdown purple) would violate constraint 2.

Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe we need to first move purple to a temporary location, then move orange to grey, then put purple on the table. Let's try:

1. unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1 (hold purple)
2. stack purple_block_1 green_block_2 (purple on green_block_2)
3. pickup orange_block_1 (now orange is clear)
4. stack orange_block_1 grey_block_1 (orange on grey)
5. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2 (hold purple)
6. putdown purple_block_1 (now purple is on table)

Now, step 6 is when purple is on the table. Before that, in step 4, orange is stacked on grey. So the condition for step 6 is satisfied because there's an earlier state (step 4) where orange is on grey. So constraint 2 is satisfied.

Then, after step 6, purple is on the table. Now, we can proceed to work on the main goal. But the goal is green_block_2 on orange_block_1. However, in step 4, orange is on grey_block_1, which is on green_block_1. So orange is not on the table. To get green_block_2 on orange_block_1, we need orange_block_1 to be on the table? Or can it be on top of another block? The goal doesn't specify, just that green_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1, regardless of where orange is. So if orange is on grey_block_1 (which is on green_block_1), then stacking green_block_2 on orange would be possible as long as orange is clear.

But after step 4, orange is on grey_block_1. So we need to have green_block_2 on orange. But green_block_2 is under purple in step 2. Wait, no: in step 2, we stacked purple on green_block_2. So after step 2, green_block_2 has purple on top, so it's not clear. Then in step 5, we unstack purple from green_block_2, making green_block_2 clear again. Then, after step 6, green_block_2 is clear (since we unstacked purple and put it down). So green_block_2 is on the table and clear. Then, we can proceed to pick up green_block_2 and stack it on orange_block_1, which is on grey_block_1.

But the goal is just green_block_2 on orange_block_1; the position of orange_block_1 doesn't matter. So after step 4, orange is on grey_block_1. Then, steps 7-9 would be:

7. pickup green_block_2 (since it's clear)
8. stack green_block_2 orange_block_1

But to stack, orange_block_1 must be clear. After step 4, orange is on grey, and no blocks are on top of orange. So yes, orange is clear. So steps 7-8 would work.

But let's check the constraints again. Let's go through all the constraints to make sure.

Constraint 1: At some state, purple_block_1 is not clear (has a block on top). When does this happen? In step 2, purple is stacked on green_block_2. Then, green_block_2 has purple on top, so purple is not clear (wait, no: when you stack purple on green_block_2, the effect is that purple is on green_block_2, purple is clear (since it's the top block), and green_block_2 is not clear. So in step 2, after stacking, purple is clear, green_block_2 is not. So purple_block_1 is clear. Then, when we unstack purple in step 5, we pick it up, so green_block_2 becomes clear again. So when is purple_block_1 not clear? Maybe when we stack something on top of it. But in this plan, purple is on green_block_2 (step 2), then unstacked (step 5), then put down (step 6). So in step 2, purple is on green_block_2 and is clear. So there's no state where purple_block_1 has a block on top. Therefore, this violates constraint 1.

So we need to have a state where there's a block on top of purple_block_1. So, perhaps after stacking purple on green_block_2, we need to stack another block on top of purple. But there's no block available except the ones on other stacks. Let's see: initial blocks are orange, brown, green, purple, red, grey, green2.

After step 2 (purple on green2), the available blocks that are clear are red, grey, green2 (but green2 has purple on top), and green_block_2 is not clear. Wait, red is on brown, grey is on green1. So to get a block on purple, we need to move another block. For example, stack red_block_1 on purple_block_1. But red is on brown_block_1. To stack red on purple, we need to unstack red from brown, then stack on purple.

But red is on brown_block_1. So steps would be:

3. unstack red_block_1 brown_block_1
4. stack red_block_1 purple_block_1 (now red is on purple, which is on green2)
Now, purple has red on top, so purple is not clear. That satisfies constraint 1. Then, when we proceed.

But this adds steps. Also, we need to ensure that when purple is not clear (red on top), then before that state, either brown_block_1 is clear (which it would be after unstacking red) or green2 is on purple. Since after step 3, brown_block_1 is clear (red was removed), then the condition is satisfied because brown_block_1 is clear.

So integrating this into the plan:

Let me outline a possible plan:

1. unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1 (hold purple)
2. stack purple_block_1 green_block_2 (purple on green2, green2 not clear)
3. unstack red_block_1 brown_block_1 (hold red)
4. stack red_block_1 purple_block_1 (red on purple; now purple is not clear)
   - This satisfies constraint 1 (purple not clear in state 4). And before that, in state 3, brown_block_1 is clear (after unstacking red), so the condition holds.

Then, proceed to move orange_block_1 to grey_block_1 to satisfy constraint 2 when we later put purple on the table.

5. pickup orange_block_1 (orange is clear after step 1)
6. stack orange_block_1 grey_block_1 (now orange is on grey)
7. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2 (but wait, purple is under red in step 4. So after step 4, purple is under red. So to unstack purple, we need to unstack red first.

Wait, after step 4, red is on purple. So to get purple, we need to unstack red first.

7. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1 (hold red)
8. putdown red_block_1 (red on table)
9. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2 (hold purple)
10. putdown purple_block_1 (now purple is on table. Before this, step 6 has orange on grey, satisfying constraint 2)

Then, proceed to stack green_block_2 on orange_block_1:

11. pickup green_block_2 (now green2 is clear after step 9)
12. stack green_block_2 orange_block_1 (goal achieved)

But this is getting complicated. Let's check all constraints step by step.

Constraint 1: There must be a state where purple is not clear. That's satisfied in step 4 (red on purple).

Constraint 2: Purple is on table in step 10. Before that, in step 6, orange is on grey, so condition satisfied.

Constraint 3: Green_block_2 must have a block on top at some point. That happens in step 2 (purple on green2), and step 4 (red on purple on green2). So green2 has blocks on top in steps 2-9. So constraint 3 is satisfied.

Constraint 4: When green2 has a block on top (step 2 or 4), before that state, either arm is holding green_block_1 or grey_block_1 is on orange. But in step 2, before that, step 1 (unstack purple). So before step 2, the arm was holding purple. So no. How to satisfy this?

Wait, constraint 3 requires that when green2 has a block on top (step 2), there must be an earlier state where the arm is holding green_block_1 or grey is on orange. But in this plan, grey is on green1, and orange is on grey in step 6. So in step 2, when we stack purple on green2, the earlier states are step 1 (unstack purple). At that point, grey is on green1. So if the condition is that before green2 is not clear (step 2), the arm must have held green1 or grey is on orange. But in step 2, before it, the arm was holding purple. So this doesn't satisfy the constraint. So we need to adjust the plan to have either held green1 or have grey on orange before stacking purple on green2.

Hmm. So perhaps we need to move grey_block_1 first. Let's see. Initially, grey is on green1. To move grey, we can unstack it.

Let me try modifying the plan:

1. unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1 (hold grey)
2. stack grey_block_1 orange_block_1 (grey on orange)
   - Now, orange has grey on top. Purple is on orange initially, so need to adjust.

Wait, initial state: purple is on orange, grey is on green1. So if we first unstack purple from orange, then unstack grey from green1.

Wait, no. The initial state is:

- purple on orange (orange is on table)
- grey on green1 (green1 on table)
- red on brown (brown on table)
- green2 on table.

So perhaps before moving purple, we need to move grey to orange. But to unstack grey from green1, we need to do:

1. unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1 (hold grey)
2. stack grey_block_1 orange_block_1 (but orange has purple on top, so can't stack grey on orange unless we first unstack purple.

So this approach won't work. Therefore, perhaps we need to first unstack purple, then move grey.

Alternative approach: To satisfy constraint 4 (when green2 has a block on top, before that, arm held green1 or grey is on orange), we can arrange for grey to be on orange before stacking anything on green2.

But in the initial state, purple is on orange. So first, unstack purple from orange.

1. unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1 (hold purple)
2. putdown purple_block_1 (purple on table)
3. unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1 (hold grey)
4. stack grey_block_1 orange_block_1 (grey on orange)
   - Now, orange has grey on top. This satisfies the condition that grey is on orange, which would help with constraint 4 when we later stack something on green2.

But after step 4, to stack something on green2, let's say purple:

5. pickup purple_block_1 (now purple is clear)
6. stack purple_block_1 green_block_2 (purple on green2)
   - Now, green2 has purple on top. So constraint 3 is satisfied. Before this, in step 4, grey is on orange. So in step 6, before green2 is not clear, the condition is satisfied (grey on orange). So constraint 4 is satisfied.

But we also need to handle other constraints.

Constraint 1: purple must have a block on top at some point. But in this plan, purple is on green2, and is clear. So no. So need to stack something on purple.

After step 6:

7. unstack red_block_1 brown_block_1 (hold red)
8. stack red_block_1 purple_block_1 (red on purple)
   - Now, purple has red on top (not clear). This satisfies constraint 1.

Constraint 2: purple must be on table at some point. In step 2, purple is put down. So that's satisfied. Before step 2, in step 1, the arm is holding purple, not orange. But constraint 2 says when purple is on table, before that, either orange is on grey or arm holds orange. In this plan, when purple is put down (step 2), the prior state is step 1 (arm holding purple). So how to satisfy constraint 2? Because there's no step where orange is on grey or arm holds orange before step 2.

Thus, this approach fails constraint 2. Therefore, we need to adjust.

Alternative idea: After unstacking purple (step 1), stack it somewhere else, then put it on the table after ensuring that orange is on grey or held.

Let's try:

1. unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1 (hold purple)
2. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1 (but brown has red on top, so we can't stack on brown. Need to unstack red first.)
So:

1. unstack red_block_1 brown_block_1 (hold red)
2. putdown red_block_1
3. unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1
4. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1 (now brown has purple)
5. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1 (hold purple)
6. putdown purple_block_1 (now purple on table. Before this, we need to have held orange or orange on grey. But haven't done that yet.)

No, this isn't working.

Alternatively, after unstacking purple, stack it on grey_block_1.

1. unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1 (hold purple)
2. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1 (grey is on green1)
   - Now, purple is on grey. Then, to put purple on the table later, we need to unstack it.
3. unstack purple_block_1 grey_block_1 (hold purple)
4. putdown purple_block_1 (now purple on table. Before this, in step 2, purple is on grey. So to satisfy constraint 2, we need to have held orange or orange on grey before step 4. If we can have orange on grey before step 4.

But how? Orange is initially on the table. To stack orange on grey, we need to pick it up. After step 2, orange is clear. So:

5. pickup orange_block_1
6. stack orange_block_1 grey_block_1 (now orange is on grey, which is on green1)
   - Now, before step 4 (putdown purple), step 6 has orange on grey. So constraint 2 is satisfied for step 4.

But step 4 is before step 5-6. So this doesn't work. So the sequence is wrong.

Alternatively, after step 2 (purple on grey), unstack grey from green1 and stack orange on grey.

But step 2: purple is on grey (which is on green1). So to unstack grey, we need to first unstack purple.

So:

3. unstack purple_block_1 grey_block_1 (hold purple)
4. putdown purple_block_1 (now purple on table)
5. unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1 (hold grey)
6. stack grey_block_1 orange_block_1 (grey on orange)
   - Now, orange has grey on top.

But step 4 (putdown purple) needs to have before that a state where orange is on grey or held. But before step 4, in step 3, the arm is holding purple. So no. Therefore, this approach fails constraint 2.

This is getting quite complicated. Let's try to re-prioritize the constraints and see which ones are interdependent.

Let's list all the constraints and see which ones require certain actions:

- Must hold green_block_2 and later hold purple_block_1.
- Must hold purple_block_1 after holding red_block_1.
- Must have red_block_1 on grey_block_1 at some point.
- Must have green_block_1 on grey_block_1 at some point.
- Must have green_block_1 not on brown_block_1, which implies moving green_block_1 if it's on brown. But initially, green_block_1 is on table with grey on top. So maybe moving green_block_1 would require unstacking grey first.
- Must have brown_block_1 have a block on top at some point. Currently, red is on brown. So maybe leave it as is? But the constraint is that when brown has a block on top, then in that state or later, either grey is on orange or orange is not on table. So if red is on brown, then during that state, we need to have either grey on orange or orange not on table.

But initially, red is on brown. So if we leave red on brown, then the state where brown has a block on top (red) is already present. So the constraint would require that in that state or later, either grey is on orange or orange is not on table. So during the initial state, red is on brown. But in the initial state, orange is on table. So to satisfy the constraint, either we need to move orange off the table or stack grey on orange at some point after the initial state.

But the initial state already has brown_block_1 not clear. However, the constraint says that if brown_block_1 is not clear in some state s, then in s or later, either grey is on orange or orange is not on table. So in the initial state, brown is not clear. So we need to ensure that in the initial state or later, grey is on orange or orange is not on table. But in the initial state, grey is on green_block_1, and orange is on table. So we need to, at some point, have either grey on orange or move orange off the table.

Since the goal requires green_block_2 on orange_block_1, which can be on the table or on another block. So if we stack green_block_2 on orange_block_1 while orange is on the table, then orange remains on the table. But then, to satisfy the constraint related to brown_block_1, we need to either move orange off the table or stack grey on orange.

But if we stack green_block_2 on orange_block_1 while it's on the table, then orange is still on the table, which would require that in some state after the initial, grey is on orange. So perhaps we need to stack grey on orange_block_1.

But grey is initially on green_block_1. So we'd need to unstack grey, then stack on orange.

But that adds steps. Let's see:

1. unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1 (hold grey)
2. stack grey_block_1 orange_block_1 (but orange has purple on top. So can't stack unless we unstack purple first.

So first, unstack purple:

1. unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1 (hold purple)
2. putdown purple_block_1
3. unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1 (hold grey)
4. stack grey_block_1 orange_block_1 (now orange has grey)
   - Now, in the initial state, brown_block_1 has red on top. So the constraint for brown_block_1 requires that in the state where brown has a block on top (initial state), either grey is on orange or orange is not on table. But in the initial state, grey is on green_block_1, and orange is on table. So this violates the constraint. Therefore, we need to ensure that after the initial state, whenever brown has a block on top (which it does until we move red), either grey is on orange or orange is not on table.

So during the plan, after moving red off brown_block_1, brown_block_1 becomes clear. But the constraint requires that in any state where brown has a block on top, which initially it does, but once red is removed, it's clear. So the only state where brown has a block on top is the initial state and until red is moved. So to satisfy the constraint related to brown_block_1, we need to ensure that either during the initial state or after, grey is on orange or orange is not on table. But in the initial state, neither is true. So we must, after the initial state, before moving red from brown, have either grey on orange or move orange.

But moving orange requires unstacking purple first. So:

1. unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1 (hold purple)
2. putdown purple_block_1
3. pickup orange_block_1
4. stack orange_block_1 grey_block_1 (now orange is on grey, which is on green_block_1)
   - Now, orange is not on the table. So when brown_block_1 has red on top (initial state), in some later state (step 4), orange is not on the table. So the constraint is satisfied.

But this requires moving orange, which may complicate the goal of putting green2 on orange. Because if orange is on grey, then to stack green2 on orange, we need to have orange clear. Which it would be after step 4.

But this seems manageable. Let's outline the steps:

1. unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1 (hold purple)
2. putdown purple_block_1 (purple on table)
   - Need to satisfy constraint 2: before step 2, either orange is on grey or arm holds orange. But in step 1, arm holds purple, so no. Thus, this violates constraint 2. So this approach is invalid.

Hmm. This is really challenging. Let's try to find a path that satisfies all constraints step by step.

Constraints that require specific actions:

- Must hold red_block_1 before holding purple_block_1 (due to constraint 5).

- Must hold green_block_2 and then hold purple_block_1 later.

- Must have red_block_1 on grey_block_1 at some point.

- Must have green_block_1 on grey_block_1 at some point.

- Must have green_block_1 not on brown_block_1, but green_block_1 is on table, so this is already true unless we move it to brown. But we shouldn't do that.

Let me try to build a plan incrementally, ensuring each constraint is met.

Start with the main goal: green_block_2 on orange_block_1. To do this, we need to clear orange_block_1 first by removing purple_block_1. So first action is unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1.

After unstacking, we hold purple. Now, we need to eventually putdown purple to satisfy constraint 2 (purple on table). But putting down purple requires that before that, orange is on grey or held. So perhaps after unstacking purple, we move orange.

But to move orange, we need to pick it up. So:

1. unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1 (hold purple)
2. putdown purple_block_1 (purple on table) [violates constraint 2, since no prior hold of orange or orange on grey]
3. pickup orange_block_1 (now possible)
4. stack orange_block_1 grey_block_1
   - Now, orange is on grey. So when we putdown purple in step 2, we didn't have the prior condition. Thus, invalid.

Alternative approach: Instead of putting down purple immediately after unstacking, we need to first manipulate orange or grey.

Let's try:

1. unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1 (hold purple)
2. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1 (grey is on green_block_1)
   - Now, purple is on grey.
3. unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1 (hold grey, but grey has purple on top. So can't unstack grey until purple is moved.
Thus, this is invalid.

Alternative:

1. unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1
2. stack purple_block_1 green_block_2
3. unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1 (hold grey)
4. stack grey_block_1 orange_block_1 (now orange has grey)
   - Now, when we need to put purple on the table later, we have to unstack it from green2, but before that, step 4 has orange on grey, which satisfies constraint 2.

Then:

5. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2 (hold purple)
6. putdown purple_block_1 (now purple on table. Before this, step 4 has orange on grey. So constraint 2 satisfied)
7. pickup green_block_2 (now clear)
8. stack green_block_2 orange_block_1 (goal achieved)

But now, check other constraints.

Constraint 1: purple must have a block on top at some point. When is that? In step 2, purple is on green2, which is clear. So no. So need to stack something on purple.

After step 2, we could stack another block on purple.

But what blocks are available? The red_block_1 is on brown. So:

3. unstack red_block_1 brown_block_1 (hold red)
4. stack red_block_1 purple_block_1 (now red on purple, which is on green2)
   - Now, purple is not clear (constraint 1 satisfied). Before this step, brown_block_1 is clear (step 3), satisfying the condition for constraint 1.

Then proceed:

5. unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1 (hold grey)
6. stack grey_block_1 orange_block_1 (orange has grey)
7. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1 (hold red)
8. putdown red_block_1
9. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2 (hold purple)
10. putdown purple_block_1
11. pickup green_block_2
12. stack green_block_2 orange_block_1

This seems to cover more constraints. Let's verify:

Constraint 1: Purple has red on top (step 4), so satisfied.

Constraint 2: Purple is put down in step 10. Before that, in step 6, orange is on grey. Satisfied.

Constraint 3: Green_block_2 has purple on top (steps 2-9), and red on top (steps 4-7). So satisfied.

Constraint 4: When green_block_2 is not clear (steps 2-9), before that, either held green_block_1 or grey on orange. Step 5-6: grey is on orange. So before step 2 (stacking purple on green2), we need to have that. But step 6 is after step 2. So this approach doesn't work. The order is wrong.

So steps are:

1. unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1
2. stack purple_block_1 green_block_2
3. unstack red_block_1 brown_block_1
4. stack red_block_1 purple_block_1
5. unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
6. stack grey_block_1 orange_block_1
...

But in this order, step 2 (stacking purple on green2) occurs before step 6 (grey on orange). So when green2 is not clear in step 2, before that, there's no state where grey is on orange or holding green1. Thus, constraint 4 is violated.

So we need to have grey on orange or holding green1 before stacking on green2.

So perhaps we need to first move grey to orange, then stack purple on green2.

But to move grey to orange, we need to unstack grey from green1, which is possible:

1. unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
2. stack grey_block_1 orange_block_1 (but orange has purple on top. So can't do that until purple is moved.

So:

1. unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1 (hold purple)
2. putdown purple_block_1
3. unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1 (hold grey)
4. stack grey_block_1 orange_block_1 (now orange has grey)
5. pickup purple_block_1
6. stack purple_block_1 green_block_2 (now green2 has purple)
7. unstack red_block_1 brown_block_1 (hold red)
8. stack red_block_1 purple_block_1 (red on purple)
   - Now, constraint 1: purple has red on top.
   - Before step 8, in step 7, brown_block_1 is clear. So satisfies constraint 1's condition.
   - Constraint 3: green2 has purple and red on top.

But in this plan, when we stack purple on green2 (step 6), before that, in step 4, grey is on orange. So constraint 4 is satisfied.

Then, proceed to put purple on the table:

9. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1 (hold red)
10. putdown red_block_1
11. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2 (hold purple)
12. putdown purple_block_1 (now purple on table. Before this, step 4 has grey on orange. Satisfies constraint 2.)

Then, stack green2 on orange:

13. pickup green_block_2
14. stack green_block_2 orange_block_1 (now green2 is on orange, which is on grey)

This seems to satisfy several constraints.

Check other constraints:

Constraint 5: Must hold purple_block_1 after holding red_block_1. In this plan, we hold red in steps 7,9. Hold purple in steps 1,5,11. So step 11 (hold purple) occurs after step 7 (hold red). So constraint 5 is satisfied.

Constraint 6: When brown_block_1 has a block on top (initially red). In any state where brown has a block on top (initially true), then in that state or later, either grey on orange or orange not on table. In the initial state, grey is on green1, orange is on table. So need to, in some later state, have grey on orange or move orange. In this plan, step 4 moves grey to orange. So after step 4, whenever brown has a block on top (which is until step 7 when red is moved), grey is on orange. So satisfies constraint 6.

Constraint 7: green_block_1 is not on brown_block_1. Initially, green1 is on table, so this is true. So constraint satisfied.

Constraint 8: red must be on grey_block_1 at some point. In this plan, red is on purple (step8), then on table (step10). So this constraint isn't met. Need to address.

Ah, right. We need to have red_block_1 on grey_block_1 at some point. So in this plan, we need to move red to grey.

Modify the plan:

After step 8 (red on purple), we need to move red to grey.

But grey is on orange. So:

9. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1 (hold red)
10. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1 (now red is on grey, which is on orange)
   - This satisfies constraint 8.
11. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2 (hold purple)
12. putdown purple_block_1 (now purple on table. Before this, step4 has grey on orange.)
13. pickup green_block_2
14. stack green_block_2 orange_block_1

Now, check constraints:

Constraint 8: red on grey in step10. Satisfied.

Constraint 9: At least one of orange on grey or green1 clear. In step4, orange has grey on top. So in step4, green1 is clear (grey was moved). So in step4, green1 is clear. So this satisfies constraint9.

Constraint10: green_block_1 on grey_block_1. In the plan, after step3, green1 is clear. So never. Thus, we need to stack green_block_1 on grey_block_1 at some point.

But green_block_1 is on the table. To stack it on grey_block_1, which is on orange_block_1. So:

After step4 (grey on orange), we need to pick up green_block_1 and stack it on grey_block_1.

But green_block_1 is clear after step3 (unstacked grey). So:

5. pickup green_block_1
6. stack green_block_1 grey_block_1 (now green1 is on grey, which is on orange)
   - Now, green1 is on grey. This satisfies constraint10.

But this changes the plan structure. Let's integrate this:

Revised plan:

1. unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1 (hold purple)
2. putdown purple_block_1
3. unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1 (hold grey)
4. stack grey_block_1 orange_block_1 (grey on orange)
5. pickup green_block_1 (clear after step3)
6. stack green_block_1 grey_block_1 (green1 on grey)
   - Now, constraint10 is satisfied.
7. pickup purple_block_1
8. stack purple_block_1 green_block_2 (purple on green2)
9. unstack red_block_1 brown_block_1 (hold red)
10. stack red_block_1 purple_block_1 (red on purple)
11. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1 (hold red)
12. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1 (red on grey, which is on orange)
13. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2 (hold purple)
14. putdown purple_block_1
15. pickup green_block_2
16. stack green_block_2 orange_block_1

Now, check all constraints:

Constraint 1: purple has red on top (step10). Satisfied.

Constraint 2: purple on table (step14). Before that, step4 has grey on orange. Satisfied.

Constraint3: green2 has purple (step8) and red (step10). Satisfied.

Constraint4: when green2 has block (step8), before that, step6 has green1 on grey. So condition is met.

Constraint5: hold purple after red. In step7, hold purple after step9 (hold red). Yes.

Constraint6: when brown has red (step9), in step9, brown becomes clear. But after step9, brown is clear. So the only state where brown has a block on top is initially until step9. In step4, grey is on orange, so during initial to step9, after step4, grey is on orange. So constraint6 satisfied.

Constraint7: green1 not on brown_block_1. It's on grey_block_1. Satisfied.

Constraint8: red on grey (step12). Satisfied.

Constraint9: in step3, after unstacking grey, green1 is clear. So in step3, green1 is clear. So there's a state where green1 is clear. Thus, constraint9 satisfied.

Constraint10: green1 on grey (step6). Satisfied.

Other constraints:

- Must hold green_block_2 at some point (step15).

- After holding green_block_2 (step15), must hold purple_block_1 at same time or later. In step14, putdown purple. So after step15, we don't hold purple. But before step15, step13-14: we hold purple. So after holding green_block_2, we need to hold purple. So this is not satisfied. Thus, this plan violates constraint4 (the holding green2 and later purple).

Ah, right. The constraint says if you hold green_block_2 in some state s, then you must hold purple_block_1 in s or later. In this plan, when we hold green_block_2 (step15), after that, we don't hold purple. But before step15, we held purple in step13 (unstack purple), then put it down in step14. So after step15, no purple holding. So this violates the constraint. Thus, the plan is invalid.

So, need to ensure that after holding green_block_2, we hold purple again. So perhaps after stacking green2 on orange, pick up purple again.

But after step16 (stack green2 on orange), the arm is empty. So:

17. pickup purple_block_1 (purple is on table in step14. So need to pick it up again.)

But this adds an extra step. So the plan becomes longer, but necessary to satisfy the constraint.

So revised steps after step16:

17. pickup purple_block_1 (now holding purple)

This satisfies the constraint that after holding green2 (step15), we hold purple (step17). Thus, constraint4 is met.

But this adds a step. Also, we need to ensure that we hold purple after green2. But in the plan, after stacking green2 (step16), we pick up purple (step17). So this meets the requirement.

Now, check all constraints again.

Constraint4: after holding green2 (step15), hold purple in step17. Satisfied.

Other constraints remain satisfied.

Now, let's check constraint9: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "orange_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1", "there is no block on top of green_block_1, i.e., green_block_1 is clear""

In this plan, green_block_1 is on grey_block_1 (step6). So green_block_1 is not clear. But in step3, after unstacking grey from green1, green1 is clear. So there's at least one state (step3) where green_block_1 is clear. Thus, constraint9 is satisfied.

Finally, constraint11: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "green_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1"" which is step6. Satisfied.

This seems to satisfy all constraints. Now, let's write out the entire plan:

1. unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1
2. putdown purple_block_1
3. unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
4. stack grey_block_1 orange_block_1
5. pickup green_block_1
6. stack green_block_1 grey_block_1
7. pickup purple_block_1
8. stack purple_block_1 green_block_2
9. unstack red_block_1 brown_block_1
10. stack red_block_1 purple_block_1
11. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
12. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1
13. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2
14. putdown purple_block_1
15. pickup green_block_2
16. stack green_block_2 orange_block_1
17. pickup purple_block_1

But wait, after step14, purple is on the table. Then step17 picks up purple again. But why? Because the constraint says that after holding green_block_2 (step15), we must hold purple in the same state or later. So after step15 (hold green2), we stack it in step16, then pick up purple in step17. So this satisfies the constraint.

But is this the shortest plan? Are there redundant steps?

For example, after step12 (stack red on grey), we need to unstack purple from green_block_2 (step13), put it down (14), then pickup green2 (15), stack (16), then pickup purple again (17). Steps 17 is only to satisfy the constraint that after holding green2, we hold purple. But perhaps we can find a way to hold purple earlier.

Alternatively, maybe after stacking green2 on orange (step16), we can immediately pickup purple. But purple is on the table (step14). So yes.

But this plan is quite long. Is there a way to optimize?

Alternatively, after step10 (stack red on purple), instead of unstacking red and putting it on grey, perhaps leave it there. But then we need to have red on grey at some point. So step10 would stack red on purple, but then we need to move red to grey later.

Alternatively, after step8 (stack purple on green2), perhaps unstack purple and stack on grey. But not sure.

Alternatively, after step7 (pickup purple), stack it on grey_block_1 (which is on orange_block_1). Then red can be stacked on purple there. But this may complicate things.

This is getting quite involved, but given the time constraints, perhaps the plan outlined above is the best possible, even if it's long. Let's verify each step's preconditions.

Step-by-step verification:

1. unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1: Preconditions: purple is on orange, clear, arm empty. Initial state: yes. Valid.

2. putdown purple_block_1: Holding purple. Valid.

3. unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1: Grey is on green1, clear. Arm empty. Valid.

4. stack grey_block_1 orange_block_1: Holding grey. Orange is clear (after step1). Valid.

5. pickup green_block_1: Green1 is on table, clear (after step3). Arm empty. Valid.

6. stack green_block_1 grey_block_1: Holding green1. Grey is clear (after step4, grey is on orange and has nothing on top). Valid.

7. pickup purple_block_1: Purple is on table, clear. Arm empty. Valid.

8. stack purple_block_1 green_block_2: Holding purple. Green2 is clear. Valid.

9. unstack red_block_1 brown_block_1: Red is on brown, clear. Arm empty. Valid.

10. stack red_block_1 purple_block_1: Holding red. Purple is clear. Valid.

11. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1: Red is on purple, clear. Arm empty. Valid.

12. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1: Holding red. Grey is clear (after step6, green1 is on grey, but step6 stacked green1 on grey, so grey is not clear. Wait, no. Step6: stack green1 on grey. So grey is under green1. So grey is not clear. So stack red on grey_block_1 would require that grey is clear. But in step12, grey has green1 on top. So this is invalid.

Ah, here's a mistake. After step6, green_block_1 is on grey_block_1. So grey_block_1 is not clear. Thus, step12 (stack red on grey) is invalid because grey is not clear. Thus, this plan is invalid.

This is a critical error. So need to adjust.

Alternative approach: To stack red on grey_block_1, grey must be clear. But after step6, green1 is on grey. So we need to unstack green1 from grey first.

Insert steps after step6:

7. unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1 (hold green1)
8. putdown green_block_1
9. pickup purple_block_1 (from step2)
10. stack purple_block_1 green_block_2
11. unstack red_block_1 brown_block_1
12. stack red_block_1 purple_block_1
13. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
14. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1 (now grey is clear)
15. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2
16. putdown purple_block_1
17. pickup green_block_2
18. stack green_block_2 orange_block_1
19. pickup purple_block_1

But this adds more steps. Let's check:

After step6 (green1 on grey), step7 unstack green1, step8 putdown. Then, grey is clear.

Then proceed:

9. pickup purple (from step2)
10. stack purple on green2
11. unstack red
12. stack red on purple
13. unstack red
14. stack red on grey (now grey is clear)
15. unstack purple from green2
16. putdown purple
17. pickup green2
18. stack on orange
19. pickup purple

This satisfies the constraint for step14 (stack red on grey). But this makes the plan even longer. However, it's necessary for correctness.

But now, checking constraint10: green_block_1 must be on grey_block_1 at some point. In step6, green1 is on grey. Then unstacked in step7. So the state in step6 satisfies constraint10. Step7 removes it, but as long as it was true in some state, it's okay.

Thus, the plan becomes:

1. unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1
2. putdown purple_block_1
3. unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
4. stack grey_block_1 orange_block_1
5. pickup green_block_1
6. stack green_block_1 grey_block_1
7. unstack green_block_1 grey_block_1
8. putdown green_block_1
9. pickup purple_block_1
10. stack purple_block_1 green_block_2
11. unstack red_block_1 brown_block_1
12. stack red_block_1 purple_block_1
13. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
14. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1
15. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2
16. putdown purple_block_1
17. pickup green_block_2
18. stack green_block_2 orange_block_1
19. pickup purple_block_1

Now, step14 (stack red on grey) is valid because grey is clear after step7-8.

This plan is quite long, but it seems to satisfy all constraints. However, it's possible that there's a shorter path. But given the complexity of the constraints, this might be the optimal plan.
