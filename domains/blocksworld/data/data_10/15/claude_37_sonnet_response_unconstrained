Alright, I'm given a blocksworld planning problem. Let me break down the initial state and the goal state and then plan a sequence of actions to solve it.

Initial State:
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- red_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
- green_block_2 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is clear
- grey_block_1 is clear
- green_block_2 is clear
- I am not holding any block

Goal State:
- green_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1

To achieve the goal state, I need to place green_block_2 on top of orange_block_1. But currently, purple_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1, so I need to move purple_block_1 first. Since purple_block_1 is clear and I'm not holding any block, I can unstack it from orange_block_1. Then I can pick up green_block_2 from the table and stack it on orange_block_1.

So, here's the plan:

1. `unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1` - This will pick up purple_block_1 from orange_block_1, making orange_block_1 clear.
2. `putdown purple_block_1` - This will put purple_block_1 on the table, freeing my hand.
3. `pickup green_block_2` - This will pick up green_block_2 from the table.
4. `stack green_block_2 orange_block_1` - This will place green_block_2 on top of orange_block_1, achieving the goal.

Let me double-check this plan:

1. `unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1`
   - Preconditions: purple_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1, purple_block_1 is clear, I'm not holding any block. These are all satisfied.
   - Effects: purple_block_1 is no longer on top of orange_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear, I'm holding purple_block_1.

2. `putdown purple_block_1`
   - Preconditions: I'm holding purple_block_1. This is satisfied after the previous action.
   - Effects: purple_block_1 is on the table, purple_block_1 is clear, I'm not holding any block.

3. `pickup green_block_2`
   - Preconditions: green_block_2 is clear, green_block_2 is on the table, I'm not holding any block. These are all satisfied after the previous actions.
   - Effects: I'm holding green_block_2, green_block_2 is no longer on the table.

4. `stack green_block_2 orange_block_1`
   - Preconditions: I'm holding green_block_2, orange_block_1 is clear. These are both satisfied after the previous actions.
   - Effects: green_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1, green_block_2 is clear, orange_block_1 is no longer clear, I'm not holding any block.

After this sequence of actions, green_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1, which is the goal state. So this plan works, and it seems to be optimal as there's no shorter way to achieve the goal.

Thus, the optimal plan is:
```
unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1
putdown purple_block_1
pickup green_block_2
stack green_block_2 orange_block_1
```
