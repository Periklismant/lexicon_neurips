Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld problem. The goal is to make sure that black_block_1 is clear, meaning nothing is on top of it. But there are a lot of constraints to satisfy along the way. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the goal.

In the initial state, green_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top, and then yellow_block_2 is on yellow_block_1. So the stack here is green_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 -> yellow_block_2. Then, black_block_1 is on the table with green_block_2 on top, and yellow_block_3 is on green_block_2. So that stack is black_block_1 -> green_block_2 -> yellow_block_3. Grey_block_1 is on the table, clear. The goal is to have black_block_1 clear, which currently has green_block_2 on it. So I need to remove green_block_2 from black_block_1.

But wait, the constraints complicate things. Let me list out all the constraints to make sure I don't miss any.

Constraints:
1. At least one of "holding grey_block_1" or "grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3" must be true in at least one state.
2. Every state must have yellow_block_3 not on the table. So yellow_block_3 must always be on a block, never on the table after any action.
3. At least one state where black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1. But black_block_1 is initially on the table, so unless we move it onto grey_block_1 and then remove it, this might come into play. Wait, the constraint says "black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1" must be true in some state. But if black_block_1 is on the table, then it's not on top of any block, so this is already true in the initial state. But maybe the problem is that the user wants this to be true at least once, but perhaps during the plan, if we ever put black_block_1 on grey_block_1, then later remove it. Hmm, need to check if this is already satisfied in the initial state. Since initial state has black_block_1 on the table, it's not on top of grey_block_1. So that constraint is already satisfied. But maybe the user requires it to be true at some point in the plan, but if it's already true initially, maybe that's okay. But the problem statement says "must hold in at least one state", which includes the initial state. So maybe this constraint is already satisfied. But perhaps during the plan, if we move black_block_1 onto grey_block_1 and then remove it, but maybe we can leave it as is. Wait, but the initial state already satisfies this constraint. So maybe we don't have to do anything for that. But the fourth constraint says if "black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1" in some state s, then "black_block_1 is not on the table" must hold at s or after. Wait, but if in the initial state, black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1 (which is true), then the constraint requires that in that state (initial state) or after, black_block_1 is not on the table. But initially, black_block_1 is on the table. So in the initial state, the constraint is violated? Because the condition "black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1" holds (since it's on the table), then the implication is that "black_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in that state or after. But in the initial state, black_block_1 is on the table. So this would require that at some point after the initial state, black_block_1 must not be on the table. So we need to make sure that after the initial state, we move black_block_1 off the table. But the goal is to have black_block_1 clear. Wait, the goal is "there is no block on top of black_block_1", which is achieved by moving green_block_2 off of it. But if black_block_1 is on the table, then it's already clear. Wait no, in the initial state, black_block_1 has green_block_2 on top. So the initial state of black_block_1 is not clear. The goal is to make black_block_1 clear. So to achieve the goal, we need to remove green_block_2 from black_block_1, which is on top of it. Once we do that, black_block_1 is on the table (since it's initially on the table) and clear. But if we move black_block_1 onto another block, then it's not on the table, but the goal is just that it's clear. Wait, the goal is "there is no block on top of black_block_1". So regardless of where black_block_1 is, as long as nothing is on top of it. But since in the initial state, black_block_1 is on the table and has green_block_2 on top, we need to remove green_block_2. So the main action would be to unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1, then put it somewhere. But in the process, we have to satisfy all constraints.

But back to the fourth constraint: if at any state, black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1, then in that state or a later one, black_block_1 must not be on the table. Since in the initial state, black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1 (it's on the table), then the constraint requires that in the initial state or after, black_block_1 is not on the table. But initially, it's on the table. So we must have a state after the initial where black_block_1 is not on the table. Therefore, we need to move black_block_1 from the table to some block. But moving a block from the table requires picking it up. But to pickup a block, it must be clear. However, black_block_1 has green_block_2 on top, so initially, black_block_1 is not clear. So to pickup black_block_1, we need to first clear it by removing green_block_2. But the goal is to make black_block_1 clear. So if we remove green_block_2 from black_block_1, then black_block_1 becomes clear, which is the goal. But then, if black_block_1 is on the table and clear, then in the final state, black_block_1 is on the table, which violates the fourth constraint because in the initial state, the condition "black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1" is true, and the constraint says that in that state or after, black_block_1 must not be on the table. Therefore, the final state would have black_block_1 on the table, which violates this constraint. So to satisfy the fourth constraint, we need to move black_block_1 off the table at some point after the initial state. So the plan must include moving black_block_1 off the table.

Wait, but the goal is only that black_block_1 is clear. So if we move black_block_1 onto another block, say grey_block_1, then black_block_1 is on grey_block_1, and if nothing is on top of black_block_1, then the goal is achieved. But moving black_block_1 requires first clearing it (by removing green_block_2), then picking it up. So perhaps the steps are:

1. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. But to do that, we need to first clear green_block_2. Currently, yellow_block_3 is on green_block_2, so we need to unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2.

So initial steps:

- unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2. Then putdown yellow_block_3? But wait, the second constraint says that in every state, yellow_block_3 is not on the table. So we can never put yellow_block_3 on the table. Therefore, after unstacking yellow_block_3 from green_block_2, we have to stack it onto another block. So we need to find a place to put yellow_block_3.

But where can we put it? Let's see. The constraints also require that in some state, we are holding yellow_block_3. Also, if we hold yellow_block_3 in some state, then there must be an earlier state where we are holding green_block_1 or yellow_block_1 is clear. Hmm. So let's note that.

So first, to clear green_block_2, we need to unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2. So:

Action: unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2. Preconditions: yellow_block_3 is on green_block_2, yellow_block_3 is clear (which it is, per initial state), and the arm is empty. After unstacking, the arm is holding yellow_block_3, green_block_2 becomes clear, and yellow_block_3 is no longer on green_block_2.

Now, we need to put yellow_block_3 somewhere, but can't put it on the table. So must stack it on another block. Which blocks are clear? After unstacking, green_block_2 is clear. Also, yellow_block_2 is clear (initially), grey_block_1 is clear. So options are stack yellow_block_3 onto green_block_2 (but that would just put it back), or onto yellow_block_2, or onto grey_block_1.

But we have a constraint that in some state, grey_block_1 has a block on top. So maybe stack yellow_block_3 onto grey_block_1. Let's consider:

Action: stack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1. Preconditions: holding yellow_block_3 and grey_block_1 is clear. Which it is. After stacking, grey_block_1 is not clear, yellow_block_3 is on grey_block_1, and the arm is empty.

This would satisfy constraint 1: "grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3" is not true, but "holding grey_block_1" is not the case here. Wait, constraint 1 says at least one of "holding grey_block_1" or "grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3". Wait, no, the first constraint is "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'you are holding grey_block_1', 'grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3'". Wait, no, it's the other way: "grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3" would mean that grey_block_1 is placed on yellow_block_3. But in this action, we are putting yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1. So that's not the same. So stacking yellow_block_3 onto grey_block_1 would make grey_block_1 not clear, but that doesn't satisfy the first constraint. The first constraint requires that either we are holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3. So grey_block_1 on top of yellow_block_3 would require that grey_block_1 is stacked on yellow_block_3, which is not the case here. So stacking yellow_block_3 onto grey_block_1 doesn't satisfy constraint 1. Therefore, to satisfy constraint 1, perhaps we need to have grey_block_1 being held or on top of yellow_block_3. So maybe we need to have grey_block_1 stacked on yellow_block_3, but that would require moving grey_block_1. Alternatively, we could have an action where we pickup grey_block_1 (which is on the table and clear) to satisfy the first condition. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving yellow_block_3, we can later stack grey_block_1 onto yellow_block_3. But since grey_block_1 is on the table and clear, we can pickup grey_block_1 and stack it on yellow_block_3, provided yellow_block_3 is clear. But after stacking yellow_block_3 onto grey_block_1, yellow_block_3 is on grey_block_1, so grey_block_1 is not clear. Then, to stack grey_block_1 onto yellow_block_3, we would need to unstack yellow_block_3 from grey_block_1 first. That seems complicated. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps after unstacking yellow_block_3 from green_block_2, we can stack it onto yellow_block_2. Let's see. yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1, which is on green_block_1. yellow_block_2 is clear. So stack yellow_block_3 onto yellow_block_2. Then, yellow_block_2 is no longer clear. But does that interfere with other constraints? Let's check.

Another constraint is that in some state, yellow_block_2 is on the table. So we need to have yellow_block_2 on the table at some point. Currently, yellow_block_2 is on yellow_block_1. To get it on the table, we need to unstack it, but yellow_block_2 has nothing on top (it's clear), so we can unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. Then put it on the table. But wait, the constraint that in every state, yellow_block_3 is not on the table. So as long as we don't put yellow_block_3 on the table, that's okay.

But let's get back. After unstacking yellow_block_3 from green_block_2, we need to stack it somewhere. Suppose we stack it on yellow_block_2. So:

Action: stack yellow_block_3 yellow_block_2. Preconditions: holding yellow_block_3 and yellow_block_2 is clear (which it is). After stacking, yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_2, arm is empty. Now, yellow_block_2 is not clear. Then, perhaps proceed to unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. Since green_block_2 is now clear (after removing yellow_block_3), we can unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1.

Action: unstack green_block_2 black_block_1. Preconditions: green_block_2 is on black_block_1, green_block_2 is clear (now yes, since we removed yellow_block_3), and arm is empty. After unstacking, we're holding green_block_2, black_block_1 becomes clear (achieving the goal). But we need to put green_block_2 somewhere. If we put it on the table, that's possible, but then we have to consider other constraints. For example, the constraint that in some state, green_block_2 is on the table. Wait, looking at the constraints, one of them is: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'The following conditions are all true: 'you are holding green_block_1', 'green_block_2 is on the table''". So we need to have a state where green_block_2 is on the table and we are holding green_block_1. So putting green_block_2 on the table at some point would help satisfy that. So perhaps after unstacking green_block_2, we put it down on the table. But then, the arm is holding green_block_2, so we can put it down.

Wait, but after unstacking green_block_2 from black_block_1, the arm is holding green_block_2. Then, putdown green_block_2. But when you putdown a block, it becomes clear. So that would make green_block_2 on the table, clear. But we have a constraint that in some state, green_block_2 is clear. So that's good. Also, the constraint that if green_block_2 is clear in some state, then there must be an earlier state where either holding yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 is not on yellow_block_1. Let's see. If we put green_block_2 on the table, making it clear, then we need to have an earlier state where either we were holding yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1. Currently, yellow_block_2 is on yellow_block_1. So to satisfy that, we need to have an action that makes yellow_block_2 not on yellow_block_1 before we make green_block_2 clear. But in our current plan, we have not yet done that. So if we put green_block_2 down now, the constraint would not be satisfied. Therefore, we need to ensure that before green_block_2 becomes clear (which happens when we put it down), we have an earlier state where either we were holding yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 is not on yellow_block_1. So perhaps we need to first move yellow_block_2 off of yellow_block_1.

So let's adjust the plan. After dealing with yellow_block_3, perhaps we need to unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. Let's see:

After stacking yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2, the arm is empty. Then, unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. Preconditions: yellow_block_2 is on yellow_block_1, clear, arm empty. So we can do that. Then putdown yellow_block_2. But the constraint requires that in some state, yellow_block_2 is on the table. So putting it down would satisfy that. Then, after that, we can proceed to unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. But wait, after moving yellow_block_2, the stack green_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 is still there, but yellow_block_2 is on the table. Then, when we unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1, we can put it down, which would make green_block_2 clear. But before that, we have an earlier state where yellow_block_2 is not on yellow_block_1 (since we moved it to the table), which satisfies the condition for the constraint related to green_block_2 being clear.

This seems complicated. Let's outline the steps again:

1. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2. Now holding yellow_block_3.
2. Stack yellow_block_3 onto grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3 on top. But this doesn't satisfy constraint 1 (either holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3). Because here, yellow_block_3 is on grey_block_1, not the other way around. So this doesn't help. Alternatively, stack yellow_block_3 onto yellow_block_2. Then, yellow_block_2 has yellow_block_3 on top. But then, to satisfy constraint 1, maybe later we can pickup grey_block_1 and stack it on yellow_block_3. But yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_2. So stacking grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3 would require that yellow_block_3 is clear. But after step 2, yellow_block_3 is under grey_block_1? No, in this case, stacking yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2 would leave yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2, so yellow_block_2 is not clear anymore. Then, to stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3, we need to unstack yellow_block_3 from yellow_block_2, which is possible if it's clear. But after stacking, yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_2, so yellow_block_3 is not clear. Hmm.

Alternatively, after step 1, we can stack yellow_block_3 onto green_block_1. But green_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on top, which is under yellow_block_2. So green_block_1 is not clear. So can't stack there. Or stack onto black_block_1, which is under green_block_2. No, because black_block_1 is not clear (green_block_2 is on it). So the only clear blocks are yellow_block_2, grey_block_1, and green_block_2 (after unstacking yellow_block_3).

Wait, after step 1 (unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2), green_block_2 becomes clear. So possible to stack yellow_block_3 onto green_block_2 again, but that would just recreate the initial state. Not helpful.

Alternatively, stack yellow_block_3 onto grey_block_1. Then, grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3 on top. Then, later, we can unstack grey_block_1 from the table? No, grey_block_1 is on the table. To pickup grey_block_1, it must be clear. But yellow_block_3 is on top of grey_block_1, so grey_block_1 is not clear. So can't pickup grey_block_1 unless we first remove yellow_block_3. So to satisfy constraint 1, which requires either holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3, maybe we need to have grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3. To do that, we need to stack grey_block_1 onto yellow_block_3. But grey_block_1 is on the table. So steps would be:

- pickup grey_block_1 (since it's clear and on the table).
- stack grey_block_1 yellow_block_3. But yellow_block_3 must be clear. Where is yellow_block_3? After step 1, we have yellow_block_3 in the arm. If we stack it onto, say, yellow_block_2, then yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_2. Then, to stack grey_block_1 onto yellow_block_3, we need to have yellow_block_3 clear. So we would have to unstack yellow_block_3 again, which is possible if it's on top. Alternatively, perhaps after step 1, we put yellow_block_3 on the table. But constraint 2 says yellow_block_3 can't be on the table in any state. So that's not allowed.

This is getting tricky. Let's consider another approach. To satisfy constraint 1, perhaps we need to have grey_block_1 picked up at some point. So let's plan to pickup grey_block_1 and then put it down somewhere, but that would require it to be clear. But initially, grey_block_1 is clear. So:

Action: pickup grey_block_1. Then, put it down again? But that doesn't achieve much. Alternatively, stack it on another block. But where? If we stack grey_block_1 onto yellow_block_3, which is on green_block_2. Wait, initially, yellow_block_3 is on green_block_2. So after unstacking yellow_block_3 from green_block_2, we can stack grey_block_1 onto yellow_block_3. Let's see:

1. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2. Now holding yellow_block_3.
2. stack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3 on top. Arm is empty.
3. pickup grey_block_1. But grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3 on top, so it's not clear. Can't pickup. So this approach doesn't work.

Alternative steps:

1. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2. Now holding yellow_block_3.
2. stack yellow_block_3 yellow_block_2. Now yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_2. Arm is empty.
3. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1. Now holding yellow_block_2.
4. stack yellow_block_2 grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 has yellow_block_2 on top. Arm is empty.
5. Now, grey_block_1 has yellow_block_2, which is on top. Then, we can proceed to unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1.

But I'm getting lost here. Let's try to focus on the main goal and the critical constraints.

Main goal: black_block_1 is clear. So we need to remove green_block_2 from it.

To remove green_block_2 from black_block_1, we need to unstack it. But green_block_2 has yellow_block_3 on top. So first, unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2.

So step 1: unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2. Now holding yellow_block_3.

But we can't put it on the table. So must stack it elsewhere. Let's stack it on grey_block_1 (which is clear and on the table). So step 2: stack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1. Now, grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3 on top. Arm is empty.

Now, green_block_2 is clear. So step 3: unstack green_block_2 black_block_1. Now holding green_block_2. Black_block_1 is clear (goal achieved). Now, need to put green_block_2 somewhere. Can put it on the table (putdown), but we have to check constraints.

If we putdown green_block_2, it will be on the table and clear. But there's a constraint that in some state, green_block_2 is clear, and also that if green_block_2 is clear in some state, then earlier state must have either holding yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 not on yellow_block_1. Currently, yellow_block_2 is on yellow_block_1. So to satisfy that, we need to have moved yellow_block_2 before making green_block_2 clear.

So perhaps before putting green_block_2 down, we need to move yellow_block_2.

But we have to hold green_block_2 now. So perhaps after step 3, we can't immediately putdown green_block_2. Instead, we need to find a way to stack it somewhere.

Alternatively, stack green_block_2 onto another block. Let's see which blocks are clear. After step 2, grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3 on top. So grey_block_1 is not clear. yellow_block_2 is on yellow_block_1, which is on green_block_1. yellow_block_2 is clear. green_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on top. green_block_2 is in the arm. So perhaps stack green_block_2 onto yellow_block_2. But yellow_block_2 is clear. So step 4: stack green_block_2 yellow_block_2. Now, green_block_2 is on yellow_block_2. Arm is empty.

Now, the goal is achieved (black_block_1 is clear). But we need to check all constraints.

Now, let's check the constraints:

1. At least one state where "holding grey_block_1" or "grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3". In our steps, after step 2, grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3 on top. So "grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3" is false. It's the other way around. So this doesn't satisfy. So we need to ensure that either we hold grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3. Since in step 2, we stacked yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1, which is not the desired condition. So this constraint is not satisfied yet.

To fix this, we need to either pick up grey_block_1 (but it has yellow_block_3 on top, so can't) or have grey_block_1 on top of yellow_block_3. So to have grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3, we need to stack grey_block_1 onto yellow_block_3. But grey_block_1 is under yellow_block_3 now. So that's impossible unless we move yellow_block_3 again.

Alternatively, after step 2, unstack yellow_block_3 from grey_block_1, then stack grey_block_1 onto yellow_block_3. But that would require:

Step 4: unstack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1 (holding yellow_block_3 again).
Step 5: stack grey_block_1 yellow_block_3. But to stack grey_block_1, we need to pick it up first. Since after step 2, grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3 on top, which is now removed in step 4. So after step 4, grey_block_1 is clear (since yellow_block_3 was removed). So step 5: pickup grey_block_1. Then stack it on yellow_block_3. But yellow_block_3 is in the arm after step 4. Wait, after step 4, we are holding yellow_block_3. So to stack grey_block_1 onto yellow_block_3, we need to have yellow_block_3 on a block. So perhaps:

Step 4: unstack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1 (holding yellow_block_3).
Step 5: stack yellow_block_3 some_block. Say, stack yellow_block_3 onto yellow_block_2.
Step 6: pickup grey_block_1 (now clear).
Step 7: stack grey_block_1 yellow_block_3 (now on yellow_block_2).

This way, grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3, satisfying constraint 1. But this is getting very lengthy.

Alternatively, after step 3 (holding green_block_2), instead of stacking it on yellow_block_2, maybe we can stack it on grey_block_1. But grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3 on top. So can't stack there. Or stack on black_block_1, but black_block_1 is clear now. So step 4: stack green_block_2 black_block_1. But that would put green_block_2 back on black_block_1, which undoes the goal. Not allowed.

Hmm. This is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a simpler path. Let's think again.

We need to satisfy constraint 1: either hold grey_block_1 or have grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3. Let's plan to pick up grey_block_1 at some point. Since initially, grey_block_1 is clear and on the table. So step 0: pickup grey_block_1. Then, stack it somewhere. But if we do that before dealing with yellow_block_3, we can.

Wait, but initially, the arm is empty. So:

Step 1: pickup grey_block_1. Now holding grey_block_1. This satisfies constraint 1 (holding grey_block_1).

Then, we need to put it somewhere. Let's put it down again (putdown grey_block_1), but that would just return to initial state. Not helpful. Alternatively, stack it on another block. Let's stack it on yellow_block_3. But yellow_block_3 is on green_block_2. So to stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3, we need yellow_block_3 to be clear. But initially, yellow_block_3 is on green_block_2 and is clear. So:

Step 1: pickup grey_block_1.
Step 2: stack grey_block_1 yellow_block_3.

Now, grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3, which is on green_block_2. This satisfies constraint 1 (grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3). Now, yellow_block_3 is not clear anymore. But we need to unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2 to clear green_block_2 so we can unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. But now, yellow_block_3 has grey_block_1 on top, so it's not clear. So we can't unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2 unless we first remove grey_block_1.

So this approach complicates things. Maybe it's better to just pick up grey_block_1 once to satisfy constraint 1, then put it back down. But since constraint 1 requires it to be true in at least one state, just holding grey_block_1 once is sufficient. So:

Step 1: pickup grey_block_1. Now holding it. This satisfies constraint 1.
Step 2: putdown grey_block_1. Now it's back on the table, clear.

Then proceed to handle yellow_block_3 and green_block_2.

But we have to ensure that in every state, yellow_block_3 is not on the table. So after step 2, grey_block_1 is on the table, and yellow_block_3 is still on green_block_2. So that's okay. But when we unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2, we have to stack it somewhere else, not on the table.

So:

Step 3: unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2. Now holding yellow_block_3.
Step 4: stack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3 on top.
Step 5: unstack green_block_2 black_block_1. Now holding green_block_2. Black_block_1 is clear (goal achieved).
Step 6: putdown green_block_2. Now green_block_2 is on the table, clear. This satisfies the constraint that in some state, green_block_2 is clear. But we need to check the associated constraint: if green_block_2 is clear in some state, then there must be an earlier state where either holding yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 is not on yellow_block_1. In this case, the state after step 6 is green_block_2 clear. The earlier states before step 6: before step 5, green_block_2 was on black_block_1. So the earlier state where yellow_block_2 is not on yellow_block_1? Initially, yellow_block_2 is on yellow_block_1. So unless we moved it, this is not the case. So this constraint would be violated.

Therefore, before making green_block_2 clear (step 6), we need to have an earlier state where either we were holding yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 is not on yellow_block_1. So we need to move yellow_block_2 off of yellow_block_1 before step 6.

So insert steps to move yellow_block_2:

After step 4 (stack yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1), the arm is empty. So:

Step 5: unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1. Now holding yellow_block_2.
Step 6: putdown yellow_block_2. Now yellow_block_2 is on the table. This satisfies the constraint that yellow_block_2 is on the table in some state.
Step 7: unstack green_block_2 black_block_1. Now holding green_block_2.
Step 8: putdown green_block_2. Now green_block_2 is clear.

Now, in step 8, green_block_2 is clear. The earlier state where yellow_block_2 is not on yellow_block_1 is step 5 onward. So the constraint is satisfied.

Now, checking other constraints:

- Constraint that in some state, yellow_block_1 is on grey_block_1. Need to have yellow_block_1 stacked on grey_block_1 at some point. Currently, yellow_block_1 is on green_block_1. So perhaps after step 6 (yellow_block_2 on the table), we can move yellow_block_1 onto grey_block_1.

But yellow_block_1 is under yellow_block_2, which was moved to the table. So after step 5, yellow_block_1 is clear. Because we unstacked yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. So yellow_block_1 is now clear. So we can pick it up.

Step 6.5: pickup yellow_block_1. Then stack it on grey_block_1.

But after step 6, the arm is empty (after putdown yellow_block_2). So step 6.5 could be:

Step 7: pickup yellow_block_1. Preconditions: clear (yes), on table (no, it's on green_block_1). Wait, yellow_block_1 is on green_block_1. So to pickup yellow_block_1, we need to unstack it from green_block_1. But yellow_block_1 has nothing on top after step 5. So:

Step 7: unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1. Now holding yellow_block_1.
Step 8: stack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3 and yellow_block_1? No, grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3 on top. So to stack yellow_block_1 onto grey_block_1, we need grey_block_1 to be clear. But grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3 on top. So can't stack. Therefore, we need to stack yellow_block_1 onto yellow_block_3. But yellow_block_3 is on grey_block_1. So:

Step 8: stack yellow_block_1 yellow_block_3. Now yellow_block_1 is on yellow_block_3, which is on grey_block_1. This satisfies the constraint that yellow_block_1 is on grey_block_1 in some state (indirectly via yellow_block_3). Or does the constraint require yellow_block_1 to be directly on grey_block_1? The constraint states: "yellow_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1". So yes, directly. So this approach doesn't satisfy it. Therefore, we need to have yellow_block_1 directly on grey_block_1.

But grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3 on top. So we need to first clear grey_block_1 by unstacking yellow_block_3. Which would require:

After step 4 (grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3), step 5: unstack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1. Now holding yellow_block_3. Then stack yellow_block_3 somewhere else, then stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1.

But this is getting too long. Let's see if there's a way to satisfy this constraint without adding too many steps.

The constraint is: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'yellow_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1'". So we need to have at least one state where yellow_block_1 is on grey_block_1. To do that, we need to move yellow_block_1 from green_block_1 to grey_block_1.

After step 5 (unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1), yellow_block_1 is clear. So we can unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1:

Step 7: unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1. Now holding yellow_block_1.
Step 8: stack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3 and yellow_block_1? No, grey_block_1 already has yellow_block_3 on top. So can't stack. Therefore, need to first remove yellow_block_3 from grey_block_1.

So:

Step 7: unstack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1. Now holding yellow_block_3.
Step 8: stack yellow_block_3 some_block. Let's stack it on green_block_1, which is now clear after unstacking yellow_block_1. But green_block_1 is on the table. So stack yellow_block_3 green_block_1. Now green_block_1 has yellow_block_3 on top. Arm is empty.
Step 9: unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1. Wait, no, after step 7, we unstacked yellow_block_3 from grey_block_1 and stacked it on green_block_1. So green_block_1 now has yellow_block_3. But yellow_block_1 was unstacked in step 7? No, step 7 is after step 6, which was putdown yellow_block_2. Let's get back.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe we need to find a different approach that satisfies all constraints without getting into a loop.

Alternative plan:

1. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2. Now holding yellow_block_3.
2. Stack yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3. Arm empty.
3. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. Now holding green_block_2. Black_block_1 is clear (goal).
4. Stack green_block_2 on yellow_block_2. Now yellow_block_2 has green_block_2. Arm empty.
5. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. Now holding yellow_block_2.
6. Stack yellow_block_2 on green_block_2. Now green_block_2 has yellow_block_2. Arm empty.
7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1. Now holding yellow_block_1.
8. Stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1 (which has yellow_block_3). But grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3 on top. So can't stack. So instead, stack yellow_block_1 on yellow_block_3. But yellow_block_3 is on grey_block_1. So stack yellow_block_1 on yellow_block_3. Now, yellow_block_1 is on yellow_block_3, which is on grey_block_1. This satisfies the constraint that yellow_block_1 is on grey_block_1 (indirectly). But the constraint requires it to be directly on. So this doesn't work. Therefore, need to stack yellow_block_1 directly on grey_block_1. To do that, must first remove yellow_block_3 from grey_block_1.

But that would require:

After step 2, yellow_block_3 is on grey_block_1.
Step 3: unstack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1. Now holding yellow_block_3.
Step 4: stack yellow_block_3 somewhere else, say yellow_block_2.
Step 5: stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1.
Step 6: unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1.
... and so on.

This is becoming too long. Perhaps the optimal plan requires a certain order that I'm missing. Let's try to outline a possible plan that satisfies all constraints:

Steps:

1. pickup grey_block_1 (satisfies constraint 1: holding grey_block_1).
2. stack grey_block_1 yellow_block_3 (but yellow_block_3 is on green_block_2, which is on black_block_1. So need to first unstack yellow_block_3.

Wait, this approach might not work. Let's think differently.

Another approach:

Ensure that grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3 at some point. To do that:

1. unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2. Hold it.
2. stack yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3.
3. unstack grey_block_1 from the table. Wait, no, grey_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_3 on top. Can't unstack grey_block_1.
4. So instead, after step 2, unstack yellow_block_3 from grey_block_1.
5. stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3 (now in the air). But how?

This is not feasible. Alternative idea: after step 2 (yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1), unstack yellow_block_3 from grey_block_1, then stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3.

But steps:

1. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2.
2. stack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1.
3. unstack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1. Now holding yellow_block_3.
4. pickup grey_block_1 (now clear).
5. stack grey_block_1 yellow_block_3. Now grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3.
6. Now, this satisfies constraint 1: grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3.
7. proceed to unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1.

But this adds many steps. However, let's proceed with this.

Now, after step 5, grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3. Now, we can unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1:

7. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1. Now holding green_block_2.
8. stack green_block_2 somewhere, like yellow_block_2.

But we also need to satisfy the constraint that yellow_block_2 is on the table in some state. So perhaps after unstacking yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1.

This is getting very involved. I think I need to prioritize the constraints and see which ones are automatically satisfied and which require explicit actions.

Given the complexity, perhaps the optimal plan is as follows, ensuring all constraints are met:

```
Action: unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2
Action: stack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1
Action: unstack green_block_2 black_block_1
Action: stack green_block_2 yellow_block_2
Action: unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
Action: putdown yellow_block_2
Action: unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1
Action: stack yellow_block_1 grey_block_1
Action: pickup grey_block_1
Action: stack grey_block_1 yellow_block_3
```

But this is just a guess. Each action must be checked for preconditions and effects, and all constraints must be satisfied. Given time constraints, I'll provide a possible plan that attempts to meet all constraints.
