Let me analyze the initial state, the goal, and the given constraints to find a valid plan.

**Initial State**:
- green_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
- black_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1
- yellow_block_3 is on top of green_block_2
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_2, yellow_block_3, and grey_block_1 are all clear
- not holding any block

We can visualize the initial state as follows:
```
   y2     y3     g1
   |      |
   y1     g2
   |      |
   g1     b1    
```
where y2, y3, and g1 are clear, and g1, b1, and g1 are on the table.

**Goal**:
- black_block_1 is clear

Looking at the initial state, black_block_1 has green_block_2 on it, and green_block_2 has yellow_block_3 on it. So to make black_block_1 clear, we need to remove all blocks from it.

**Constraints**:
Let me first identify key constraints that directly affect the structure of my plan:

1. At some point, we need to either hold grey_block_1 or place grey_block_1 on top of yellow_block_3.
2. yellow_block_3 can never be on the table.
3. At some point, black_block_1 should not be on top of grey_block_1. (This constraint seems a bit confusing since in the initial state, black_block_1 is on the table, not on any other block).
4. If black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1, then at that state or some later state, black_block_1 should not be on the table.
5. At some point, yellow_block_1 should be on top of grey_block_1.
6. At some point, green_block_2 should be clear.
7. Before green_block_2 becomes clear, either I need to hold yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 should not be on top of yellow_block_1.
8. At some point, grey_block_1 should have a block on it, and yellow_block_2 should be on the table.
9. At some point, green_block_1 should not be clear (i.e., have a block on it).
10. If green_block_1 is not clear, then I should hold yellow_block_2 at that state or some later state.
11. At some point, I need to hold green_block_1, and green_block_2 should be on the table.
12. At some point, green_block_1 should be on top of black_block_1, and black_block_1 should not be on the table.
13. At some point, I need to hold yellow_block_3.
14. Before I hold yellow_block_3, I should either hold green_block_1 or yellow_block_1 should be clear.

Given the complexity of these constraints, I'll work backwards from the goal to construct a plan:

1. The goal is to have black_block_1 clear.
2. In the initial state, black_block_1 has green_block_2 on it, and green_block_2 has yellow_block_3 on it.
3. So, I need to remove yellow_block_3 and green_block_2 from top of black_block_1.

Let's start formulating a plan. I'll try to satisfy all the constraints while working towards the goal:

First, I need to unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2. However, before doing that, I need to satisfy the constraint that says before holding yellow_block_3, I must either hold green_block_1 or ensure yellow_block_1 is clear. In the initial state, yellow_block_1 is not clear, so I might need to hold green_block_1 first.

Let's work through a possible plan:

1. Initially, the tower with yellow_block_2 on top of yellow_block_1 on top of green_block_1 is on the table. I'll start by unstacking yellow_block_2.
2. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1.
3. I now have yellow_block_2 in my hand. I want to ensure that "there is no block on top of green_block_2, i.e., green_block_2 is clear" holds at some point. Since I've already unstacked yellow_block_2, the constraint "Before green_block_2 becomes clear, either I need to hold yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 should not be on top of yellow_block_1" is satisfied because yellow_block_2 is no longer on top of yellow_block_1.
4. Now, I need to find a place for yellow_block_2. Let's place it on the table to satisfy the constraint "At some point, grey_block_1 should have a block on it, and yellow_block_2 should be on the table".
5. Put down yellow_block_2 on the table.
6. Now, I need to unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.
7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.
8. I now have yellow_block_1 in my hand. I want to ensure that "yellow_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1" holds at some point.
9. Stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1. This satisfies the constraint "At some point, yellow_block_1 should be on top of grey_block_1" and the constraint "At some point, grey_block_1 should have a block on it, and yellow_block_2 should be on the table".
10. Now, I need to either hold grey_block_1 or place grey_block_1 on top of yellow_block_3 at some point. Since I can't hold two blocks at once and yellow_block_1 is on grey_block_1, I might need to pick up green_block_1 first.
11. Pick up green_block_1 from the table. This might satisfy the constraint "At some point, I need to hold green_block_1, and green_block_2 should be on the table", but green_block_2 is not on the table in the initial state.
12. I need to place green_block_1 somewhere. Let's stack it on yellow_block_2, which is on the table.
13. Stack green_block_1 on yellow_block_2. This satisfies the constraint "At some point, green_block_1 should not be clear (i.e., have a block on it)" since it now has a block on it (itself).
14. I now need to ensure that "you are holding yellow_block_2" holds at some point after green_block_1 is not clear, as per the constraint. Let's unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_2.
15. Unstack green_block_1 from yellow_block_2.
16. Now, I'll place green_block_1 somewhere else. Let's put it on the table for now.
17. Put down green_block_1 on the table.
18. Now, I need to pick up yellow_block_2 to satisfy the constraint.
19. Pick up yellow_block_2 from the table.
20. I need to place yellow_block_2 somewhere. Let's stack it on green_block_1, which is on the table.
21. Stack yellow_block_2 on green_block_1.
22. Now, I need to work on satisfying the constraint "At some point, green_block_1 should be on top of black_block_1, and black_block_1 should not be on the table". This means I need to move black_block_1 from the table and place green_block_1 on it. First, I need to move yellow_block_2 from green_block_1.
23. Unstack yellow_block_2 from green_block_1.
24. I need to place yellow_block_2 somewhere. Let's put it on the table.
25. Put down yellow_block_2 on the table.
26. Now, I can pick up green_block_1.
27. Pick up green_block_1 from the table.
28. I also need to move black_block_1 from the table. First, I need to remove green_block_2 and yellow_block_3 from it.
29. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2. This satisfies the constraint "At some point, I need to hold yellow_block_3".
30. I need to ensure that "grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3" holds at some point or I need to hold grey_block_1. Let's place yellow_block_3 somewhere for now.
31. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2. This keeps yellow_block_3 off the table, satisfying the constraint "yellow_block_3 is never on the table".
32. Now, I can unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1.
33. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1.
34. I need to place green_block_2 somewhere. Let's put it on the table. This satisfies the constraint "At some point, I need to hold green_block_1, and green_block_2 should be on the table".
35. Put down green_block_2 on the table.
36. Now, I can pick up black_block_1.
37. Pick up black_block_1 from the table. This satisfies the constraint "If black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1, then at that state or some later state, black_block_1 should not be on the table".
38. I need to place black_block_1 somewhere. Let's stack it on one of the blocks, say grey_block_1.
39. Wait, I can't stack black_block_1 on grey_block_1 because grey_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on it. Let's stack it on another clear block, say green_block_2.
40. Stack black_block_1 on green_block_2. Now, black_block_1 is not on the table.
41. I need to pick up green_block_1 and place it on black_block_1 to satisfy the constraint "At some point, green_block_1 should be on top of black_block_1, and black_block_1 should not be on the table". But I can't immediately place green_block_1 on black_block_1 because green_block_1 is already in my hand (from step 27). Let's place it on black_block_1.
42. Stack green_block_1 on black_block_1. This satisfies the constraint.
43. Now, we need to ensure that black_block_1 is clear, which is our goal. Let's unstack green_block_1 from black_block_1.
44. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_1.
45. I need to place green_block_1 somewhere. Let's put it on the table.
46. Put down green_block_1 on the table.

Wait, there's a constraint I'm missing: "At some point, I need to either hold grey_block_1 or place grey_block_1 on top of yellow_block_3". I need to satisfy this before completing the plan. Let's backtrack a bit and adjust:

Let's backtrack to step 30. Instead of stacking yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2, let's try a different approach:

30. I need to ensure that "grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3" holds at some point or I need to hold grey_block_1. Let's try to set up a situation where grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3. First, I need to place yellow_block_3 somewhere.
31. Stack yellow_block_3 on green_block_2. This keeps yellow_block_3 off the table, satisfying the constraint "yellow_block_3 is never on the table".
32. Now, I need to free up grey_block_1. I'll unstack yellow_block_1 from grey_block_1.
33. Unstack yellow_block_1 from grey_block_1.
34. I need to place yellow_block_1 somewhere. Let's put it on the table.
35. Put down yellow_block_1 on the table.
36. Now, I can pick up grey_block_1.
37. Pick up grey_block_1 from the table. This satisfies one of the constraint options: "At some point, I need to either hold grey_block_1 or place grey_block_1 on top of yellow_block_3".
38. I need to place grey_block_1 somewhere. Let's stack it on yellow_block_3. This satisfies the alternative constraint option.
39. Stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3.

Now, we need to continue with the plan to ensure the goal is met and all constraints are satisfied.

But actually, I realize I made a mistake in my planning. In step 30 (original numbering), I was holding yellow_block_3, and in step (original) 34, I planned to pick up green_block_1. But I can only hold one block at a time. Let me redo the plan, keeping track of what block I'm holding at each step.

Actually, let's say I'm going to start over. I want to check the state, the goal again, and have a more systematic approach that takes all the constraints into account.

**Initial State**:
- green_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
- black_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1
- yellow_block_3 is on top of green_block_2
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_2, yellow_block_3, and grey_block_1 are all clear
- not holding any block

**Goal**:
- black_block_1 is clear

Let's try to devise a clearer plan:

1. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2. I now have yellow_block_3 in my hand. This satisfies the constraint "At some point, I need to hold yellow_block_3". However, this also has a constraint: before I hold yellow_block_3, I should either hold green_block_1 or yellow_block_1 should be clear. In the initial state, none of these conditions are met, so I need to rethink.

Let's start by making yellow_block_1 clear:

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. I now have yellow_block_2 in my hand.
2. Put down yellow_block_2 on the table. This satisfies part of the constraint "At some point, grey_block_1 should have a block on it, and yellow_block_2 should be on the table".
3. Now, I can unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2, as the constraint for holding yellow_block_3 is now met (yellow_block_1 is clear). I now have yellow_block_3 in my hand.
4. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2. This keeps yellow_block_3 off the table, satisfying the constraint "yellow_block_3 is never on the table".
5. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. I now have green_block_2 in my hand. This also makes black_block_1 clear, which is our goal.

But we still have several constraints to satisfy:
- At some point, I need to either hold grey_block_1 or place grey_block_1 on top of yellow_block_3.
- At some point, yellow_block_1 should be on top of grey_block_1.
- At some point, green_block_1 should be on top of black_block_1, and black_block_1 should not be on the table.
- ...and more.

I think I need to continue with this plan:

6. Put down green_block_2 on the table. This makes green_block_2 clear, satisfying the constraint "At some point, green_block_2 should be clear".
7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1. I now have yellow_block_1 in my hand.
8. Stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1. This satisfies the constraint "At some point, yellow_block_1 should be on top of grey_block_1". It also satisfies the remainder of the constraint "At some point, grey_block_1 should have a block on it, and yellow_block_2 should be on the table".
9. Pick up green_block_1 from the table. I now have green_block_1 in my hand. This also satisfies the constraint "At some point, I need to hold green_block_1, and green_block_2 should be on the table".
10. Stack green_block_1 on black_block_1. This means green_block_1 is not clear, which satisfies the constraint "At some point, green_block_1 should not be clear (i.e., have a block on it)". It also satisfies the constraint "At some point, green_block_1 should be on top of black_block_1, and black_block_1 should not be on the table" if we lift black_block_1 off the table in the next steps.
11. Pick up yellow_block_2 from the table. I now have yellow_block_2 in my hand. This satisfies the constraint "If green_block_1 is not clear, then I should hold yellow_block_2 at that state or some later state".
12. Stack yellow_block_2 on green_block_1.
13. Unstack yellow_block_2 from green_block_1. I now have yellow_block_2 in my hand again.
14. Put down yellow_block_2 on the table.
15. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_1. I now have green_block_1 in my hand.
16. Put down green_block_1 on the table.

At this point, black_block_1 is clear, which is our goal. However, we still have a few constraints to check:

- The constraint "At some point, I need to either hold grey_block_1 or place grey_block_1 on top of yellow_block_3" hasn't been met yet.
- The constraint "If black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1, then at that state or some later state, black_block_1 should not be on the table" is tricky. In the initial state, black_block_1 is on the table, not on top of grey_block_1. So, based on the constraint, black_block_1 should be lifted off the table at some point.

Let's continue:

17. Pick up black_block_1 from the table. I now have black_block_1 in my hand. This satisfies the constraint "If black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1, then at that state or some later state, black_block_1 should not be on the table".
18. Unstack yellow_block_1 from grey_block_1. I now have yellow_block_1 in my hand. (Wait, I can't do this since I'm holding black_block_1. Let's redo this part).

17. Pick up black_block_1 from the table. I now have black_block_1 in my hand.
18. Stack black_block_1 on green_block_1. This makes black_block_1 not on the table.
19. Unstack yellow_block_1 from grey_block_1. I now have yellow_block_1 in my hand.
20. Put down yellow_block_1 on the table.
21. Pick up grey_block_1 from the table. I now have grey_block_1 in my hand. This satisfies the constraint "At some point, I need to either hold grey_block_1 or place grey_block_1 on top of yellow_block_3".
22. Stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3. This also satisfies the alternative constraint option.
23. Unstack black_block_1 from green_block_1. I now have black_block_1 in my hand.
24. Put down black_block_1 on the table.

At this point, black_block_1 is clear, which is our goal, and all constraints have been met.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me redo the plan with a clearer strategy. We need to satisfy all constraints and end with black_block_1 being clear.

I think the key to this problem is to temporarily satisfy the constraints during the execution of the plan, and then possibly undo some of these satisfied constraints (if doing so doesn't invalidate the constraint) to achieve the goal of making black_block_1 clear.

Let's first identify all the constraints that involve block positions:

1. yellow_block_3 is never on the table.
2. At some point, yellow_block_1 should be on top of grey_block_1.
3. At some point, grey_block_1 should have a block on it, and yellow_block_2 should be on the table.
4. At some point, green_block_1 should be on top of black_block_1, and black_block_1 should not be on the table.
5. At some point, I need to either hold grey_block_1 or place grey_block_1 on top of yellow_block_3.

Ok, let's take a more systematic approach by working through all the constraints and figuring out what order makes most sense:

1. I need to unstack yellow_block_3 at some point. The condition for this is that at an earlier state, I need to hold green_block_1 or yellow_block_1 is clear.
2. I need to make green_block_2 clear at some point. The condition for this is that at an earlier state, I need to hold yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1.
3. I need to make green_block_1 not clear at some point. After this, I need to hold yellow_block_2 at that state or later.
4. I need to hold green_block_1 at some point, and green_block_2 is on the table at that point.
5. I need to make green_block_1 on top of black_block_1, and black_block_1 not on the table, at some point.
6. If black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1, then at that state or some later state, black_block_1 should not be on the table.

Let me create a systematic plan:

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. I now have yellow_block_2 in my hand. This satisfies the condition for making green_block_2 clear, i.e., "yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1".
2. Put down yellow_block_2 on the table. This partially satisfies the constraint "At some point, grey_block_1 should have a block on it, and yellow_block_2 should be on the table".
3. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1. I now have yellow_block_1 in my hand.
4. Stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1. This satisfies the constraint "At some point, yellow_block_1 should be on top of grey_block_1". It also fully satisfies the constraint "At some point, grey_block_1 should have a block on it, and yellow_block_2 should be on the table".
5. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2. I now have yellow_block_3 in my hand. This satisfies the constraint "At some point, I need to hold yellow_block_3". It also makes green_block_2 clear, satisfying the constraint "At some point, there is no block on top of green_block_2, i.e., green_block_2 is clear".
6. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2. This keeps yellow_block_3 off the table, satisfying the constraint "yellow_block_3 is never on the table".
7. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. I now have green_block_2 in my hand. This makes black_block_1 clear, which is our goal. But we need to continue to ensure all constraints are met.
8. Put down green_block_2 on the table. This satisfies part of the constraint "At some point, I need to hold green_block_1, and green_block_2 should be on the table".
9. Pick up green_block_1 from the table. I now have green_block_1 in my hand. This fully satisfies the constraint "At some point, I need to hold green_block_1, and green_block_2 should be on the table".
10. Stack green_block_1 on black_block_1. This means green_block_1 is not clear, which satisfies the constraint "At some point, green_block_1 should not be clear (i.e., have a block on it)".
11. Pick up yellow_block_2 from the table. I now have yellow_block_2 in my hand. This satisfies the constraint "If green_block_1 is not clear, then I should hold yellow_block_2 at that state or some later state".
12. Put down yellow_block_2 on the table.
13. Unstack yellow_block_1 from grey_block_1. I now have yellow_block_1 in my hand.
14. Put down yellow_block_1 on the table.
15. Pick up grey_block_1 from the table. I now have grey_block_1 in my hand. This satisfies part of the constraint "At some point, I need to either hold grey_block_1 or place grey_block_1 on top of yellow_block_3".
16. Stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3. This fully satisfies the constraint.
17. Pick up black_block_1 from the table. I now have black_block_1 in my hand. This satisfies the constraint "If black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1, then at that state or some later state, black_block_1 should not be on the table".
18. Stack black_block_1 on yellow_block_1. This makes black_block_1 not on the table.
19. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_1. I now have green_block_1 in my hand. This makes black_block_1 clear, which is our goal.
20. Put down green_block_1 on the table.

Wait, in step 19, I'm unstacking green_block_1 from black_block_1, but in the previous step, I've stacked black_block_1 on yellow_block_1. There's an error in my plan due to trying to keep track of too many things at once. Let me redo it:

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. I now have yellow_block_2 in my hand. This satisfies the condition for making green_block_2 clear, i.e., "yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1".
2. Put down yellow_block_2 on the table. This partially satisfies the constraint "At some point, grey_block_1 should have a block on it, and yellow_block_2 should be on the table".
3. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1. I now have yellow_block_1 in my hand.
4. Stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1. This satisfies the constraint "At some point, yellow_block_1 should be on top of grey_block_1". It also fully satisfies the constraint "At some point, grey_block_1 should have a block on it, and yellow_block_2 should be on the table".
5. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2. I now have yellow_block_3 in my hand. This satisfies the constraint "At some point, I need to hold yellow_block_3". It also makes green_block_2 clear, satisfying the constraint "At some point, there is no block on top of green_block_2, i.e., green_block_2 is clear".
6. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2. This keeps yellow_block_3 off the table, satisfying the constraint "yellow_block_3 is never on the table".
7. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. I now have green_block_2 in my hand. This makes black_block_1 clear, which is our goal. But we need to continue to ensure all constraints are met.
8. Put down green_block_2 on the table. This satisfies part of the constraint "At some point, I need to hold green_block_1, and green_block_2 should be on the table".
9. Pick up green_block_1 from the table. I now have green_block_1 in my hand. This fully satisfies the constraint "At some point, I need to hold green_block_1, and green_block_2 should be on the table".
10. Pick up black_block_1 from the table. Wait, I can't do this because I'm holding green_block_1. This part of the plan is incorrect.

I think I need to be more visual about this. Let me list the initial configuration again:

Initial configuration:
```
     y2      y3      g1
     |       |
     y1      g2
     |       |
     g1      b1      
```
where y2, y3, and g1 are all clear, and g1, b1, and g1 are on the table.

Let me try to plan step by step, ensuring I track the state correctly. I'll set up the initial state, which looks like:

```
   y2     y3     g1
   |      |
   y1     g2
   |      |
   g1     b1    
```

1. unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1
```
        y3     g1
        |
   y2   g2     y1
        |      |
        b1     g1
```

2. putdown yellow_block_2
```
        y3     g1
        |
   y2   g2     y1
        |      |
        b1     g1
```

3. unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
```
        y3     g1
        |
   y2   g2     y1
        |
        b1     g1
```

4. stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1
```
        y3
        |
   y2   g2     y1
        |      |
        b1     g1
```

5. unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2
```
        y3
   y2   g2
        |
        b1     g1
```

6. stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2
```
   y3
   |
   y2   g2
        |
        b1     g1
```

This satisfies the constraint "At some point, green_block_1 should be on top of black_block_1, and black_block_1 should not be on the table".

```

13. unstack yellow_block_3 from yellow_block_1 (Wait, this isn't right, yellow_block_3 is not on yellow_block_1).

Let me re-examine the constraints and current state. I'm finding it hard to get an ordering that satisfies all constraints, so let's try a different approach. 

Let's re-examine the constraints. I notice that several of the constraints don't specify the order explicitly. For instance, the constraint "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "The following conditions are all true: "there is a block on top of grey_block_1, i.e., grey_block_1 is not clear", "yellow_block_2 is on the table""" just says this should hold at some point during the plan, but doesn't specify when.

I'm going to list out the constraints and try to devise a plan more systematically:

1. At some point, we need to either hold grey_block_1 or place grey_block_1 on top of yellow_block_3.
2. yellow_block_3 is never on the table.
3. At some point, black_block_1 should not be on top of grey_block_1. (This seems to be already true in the initial state)
4. If black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1, then black_block_1 should not be on the table at that state or some later state.
5. At some point, yellow_block_1 should be on top of grey_block_1.
6. At some point, green_block_2 should be clear.
7. If green_block_2 is clear, then there must be an earlier state where I'm holding yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1.
8. At some point, grey_block_1 should have a block on it and yellow_block_2 should be on the table.
9. At some point, green_block_1 should not be clear (i.e., have a block on it).
10. If green_block_1 is not clear, then I should hold yellow_block_2 at that state or some later state.
11. At some point, I need to hold green_block_1, and green_block_2 should be on the table.
12. At some point, green_block_1 should be on top of black_block_1, and black_block_1 should not be on the table.
13. At some point, I need to hold yellow_block_3.
14. If I hold yellow_block_3, there must be an earlier state where I hold green_block_1 or yellow_block_1 is clear.

Let me see if I can derive some order from these constraints. For example, constraint 14 suggests that we need to make yellow_block_1 clear or hold green_block_1 before we hold yellow_block_3.

Additionally, the goal is to make black_block_1 clear, which means we need to remove green_block_2 and yellow_block_3 from on top of it.

Let's try a new strategy:

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. I now have yellow_block_2 in my hand.
2. Put down yellow_block_2 on the table. This helps satisfy constraint 8.
3. Now, yellow_block_1 is clear, which satisfies the condition for constraint 14.
4. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2. I now have yellow_block_3 in my hand. This satisfies constraint 13.
5. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2. This ensures yellow_block_3 is never on the table, satisfying constraint 2.
6. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1. I now have yellow_block_1 in my hand.
7. Stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1. This satisfies constraint 5 and constraint 8.
8. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. I now have green_block_2 in my hand. This makes black_block_1 clear, which is our goal.
9. Put down green_block_2 on the table. This helps satisfy constraint 11.
10. Pick up green_block_1 from the table. I now have green_block_1 in my hand. This, combined with the previous step, satisfies constraint 11.
11. Stack green_block_1 on black_block_1. This satisfies constraint 9 and constraing 12.
12. Pick up yellow_block_2 from the table. I now have yellow_block_2 in my hand. This, combined with the previous step, satisfies constraint 10.
13. Put down yellow_block_2 on the table.
14. Pick up black_block_1 from the table. I now have black_block_1 in my hand. This satisfies constraint 4.
15. Stack black_block_1 on green_block_2. This ensures black_block_1 is not on the table.
16. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_1. Hmm, but black_block_1 is on green_block_2 now, so it doesn't have green_block_1 on it.

I think I'm confusing myself by trying to track the state in my head. Let's take a step back from this plan and continue using the visual method:

We're starting from this configuration:

                b1

                |
   y2    b1     g1
         |
         g2
```

19. pickup grey_block_1
```
   y3           y1
                
   y2    b1     g1
         |
         g2
```

20. stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3
```
   g1
   |
   y3           y1
                
   y2    b1     g1

21. unstack black_block_1 from green_block_2

   g1
   |
   y3           y1
                
   y2    b1     g1
         
         g2
```

22. putdown black_block_1
```
   g1

   y3           y1
                
   y2    b1     g1
         
         g2
```

Now, let's check all the constraints to ensure they're met:

1. At some point, we need to either hold grey_block_1 or place grey_block_1 on top of yellow_block_3. This is satisfied by steps 19 and 20.
2. yellow_block_3 is never on the table. This is satisfied throughout.
3. At some point, black_block_1 should not be on top of grey_block_1. This is true throughout the plan.
4. If black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1, then black_block_1 should not be on the table at that state or some later state. This is satisfied by steps 17 and 18.
5. At some point, yellow_block_1 should be on top of grey_block_1. This is not met, in the plan yellow_block_1 is on the table. (actually it looks like in step 4 I moved yellow_block_1 to grey_block_1, so this is satisfied).
6. At some point, green_block_2 should be clear. This is satisfied by step 5 onwards.
7. If green_block_2 is clear, then there must be an earlier state where I'm holding yellow_block_1 or yellow_block_2 is not on top of yellow_block_1. This is satisfied by steps 1 and 3.
8. At some point, grey_block_1 should have a block on it and yellow_block_2 should be on the table. This is satisfied by steps 4 and 2.
9. At some point, green_block_1 should not be clear (i.e., have a block on it). This is satisfied by step 12.
10. If green_block_1 is not clear, then I should hold yellow_block_2 at that state or some later state. This is satisfied by steps 12 and 13.
11. At some point, I need to hold green_block_1, and green_block_2 should be on the table. This is satisfied by steps 9 and 8.
12. At some point, green_block_1 should be on top of black_block_1, and black_block_1 should not be on the table. This is satisfied by step 10.
13. At some point, I need to hold yellow_block_3. This is satisfied by step 5.
14. If I hold yellow_block_3, there must be an earlier state where I hold green_block_1 or yellow_block_1 is clear. This is satisfied by step 3.

So, I think all the constraints are satisfied, and the goal of making black_block_1 clear is achieved. The final plan is:

1. unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_2
3. unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
4. stack yellow_block_1 on grey_block_1
5. unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2
6. stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2
7. unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1
8. putdown green_block_2
9. pickup green_block_1
10. stack green_block_1 on black_block_1
11. pickup yellow_block_2
12. stack yellow_block_2 on green_block_1
13. unstack yellow_block_2 from green_block_1
14. putdown yellow_block_2
15. unstack green_block_1 from black_block_1
16. putdown green_block_1
17. pickup black_block_1
18. stack black_block_1 on green_block_2
19. pickup grey_block_1
20. stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3
21. unstack black_block_1 from green_block_2
22. putdown black_block_1
