Let's analyze the problem:

We have a blocksworld scenario with the following objects:
- green_block_1
- yellow_block_1
- black_block_1
- green_block_2
- yellow_block_2
- yellow_block_3
- grey_block_1

The initial state is as follows:
- green_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
- black_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1
- yellow_block_3 is on top of green_block_2
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_2 is clear
- yellow_block_3 is clear
- grey_block_1 is clear
- The arm is not holding any block

The goal is to make black_block_1 clear, i.e., there should be no block on top of black_block_1.

Given the initial state, black_block_1 has green_block_2 on top of it, and yellow_block_3 is on top of green_block_2. So to make black_block_1 clear, we need to remove both green_block_2 and yellow_block_3 from their current positions.

Let's think about a plan to achieve the goal:

1. First, I need to unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2 (since yellow_block_3 is clear and I'm not holding any block, this action is valid).
2. Then, I need to put yellow_block_3 somewhere. I'll put it on the table.
3. Now, I can unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1 (since green_block_2 is now clear and I'm not holding any block).
4. Finally, I'll put green_block_2 somewhere. I'll put it on the table.

After these steps, black_block_1 will be clear, which is the goal. Let's formalize this plan:

1. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2
2. putdown yellow_block_3
3. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1
4. putdown green_block_2

Now, let's check if each action's preconditions are met:

Action 1: unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2
Preconditions:
- yellow_block_3 is on top of green_block_2 (satisfied)
- yellow_block_3 is clear (satisfied)
- arm is not holding any block (satisfied)

Action 2: putdown yellow_block_3
Preconditions:
- arm is holding yellow_block_3 (satisfied after Action 1)

Action 3: unstack green_block_2 black_block_1
Preconditions:
- green_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 (satisfied)
- green_block_2 is clear (satisfied after Action 1)
- arm is not holding any block (satisfied after Action 2)

Action 4: putdown green_block_2
Preconditions:
- arm is holding green_block_2 (satisfied after Action 3)

The plan seems valid. Let's double-check the effects of each action to ensure the goal is achieved:

After Action 1 (unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2):
- yellow_block_3 is no longer on top of green_block_2
- green_block_2 is clear
- arm is holding yellow_block_3

After Action 2 (putdown yellow_block_3):
- yellow_block_3 is on the table
- yellow_block_3 is clear
- arm is not holding any block

After Action 3 (unstack green_block_2 black_block_1):
- green_block_2 is no longer on top of black_block_1
- black_block_1 is clear
- arm is holding green_block_2

After Action 4 (putdown green_block_2):
- green_block_2 is on the table
- green_block_2 is clear
- arm is not holding any block

Indeed, after Action 3, black_block_1 becomes clear, achieving the goal. The plan is:

1. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2
2. putdown yellow_block_3
3. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1
4. putdown green_block_2

This is an optimal plan for the given problem. Alternatively, instead of putting the blocks on the table, I could stack them on other blocks (like grey_block_1), but the length of the plan would remain the same.

Actually, let me make sure there isn't a shorter plan. The goal is to make black_block_1 clear. Given the initial state, this means I need to remove green_block_2 (which has yellow_block_3 on top) from black_block_1. To remove green_block_2, I first need to remove yellow_block_3. So, the minimum number of actions needed is:
- Remove yellow_block_3 from green_block_2
- Put yellow_block_3 somewhere
- Remove green_block_2 from black_block_1
- Put green_block_2 somewhere

That's 4 actions at a minimum, which matches our plan. So, the plan is optimal.
