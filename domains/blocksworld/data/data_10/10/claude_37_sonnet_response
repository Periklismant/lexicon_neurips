Let's break down this problem step by step.

First, let's understand the initial state:
- green_block_1 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
- red_block_2 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on top of red_block_2
- green_block_2 is on the table
- yellow_block_2 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2
- red_block_1, yellow_block_1, green_block_2, and blue_block_1 are clear
- you are not holding any block

The goal is to have:
- you are holding green_block_1

Now, let's understand the constraints:

1. "green_block_2 is on top of red_block_2" must hold in at least one state.
2. "you are holding red_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
3. If "you are holding red_block_1" holds, then there must be an earlier state where either "red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1" or "red_block_2 is on top of green_block_2".
4. "yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1 and red_block_2 is not on the table" must hold in at least one state.
5. "green_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in at least one state.
6. If "green_block_1 is not on the table" holds in some state s, then "blue_block_1 is not clear" must hold at s or some state after s.
7. "red_block_1 is on the table" must hold in at least one state.
8. If "red_block_1 is on the table" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state where "green_block_1 is not on the table".
9. "red_block_1 is not clear" must hold in at least one state.
10. If "red_block_1 is not clear" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state where "you are holding yellow_block_2".
11. "you are holding green_block_2" must hold in at least one state.
12. At least one of "you are holding yellow_block_2" or "yellow_block_1 is on the table" must hold in at least one state.
13. "yellow_block_2 is not clear" must hold in at least one state.
14. If "yellow_block_2 is not clear" holds in some state s, then "you are holding green_block_2" must hold at s or some state after s.
15. "green_block_1 is clear" must hold in at least one state.
16. If "green_block_1 is clear" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state where "yellow_block_2 is clear" and "yellow_block_1 is not clear".

Let's think about this:

Constraint 15 says we need green_block_1 to be clear at some point. Currently, red_block_1 is on top of green_block_1, so we'll need to move red_block_1 at some point.

Constraint 5 says green_block_1 must not be on the table at some point. That means we need to pick up green_block_1, which is currently at the bottom of a stack. To pick it up, we need to clear it by removing red_block_1.

Constraint 16 says if green_block_1 is clear, there must be an earlier state where yellow_block_2 is clear and yellow_block_1 is not clear. Currently, yellow_block_2 has blue_block_1 on top of it, so it's not clear. And yellow_block_1 is clear. We need to reverse these conditions.

Constraint 6 says if green_block_1 is not on the table, blue_block_1 is not clear. This means when we're holding green_block_1 (which is the goal and means it's not on the table), blue_block_1 should have something on it.

Constraint 9 and 10 say red_block_1 must not be clear at some point, and before that, we must be holding yellow_block_2. This means we need to place something on top of red_block_1, and before that, we need to pick up yellow_block_2.

Let's start building a plan:

1. First, we need to make yellow_block_2 clear so that we can pick it up. Currently, blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2, so we need to move blue_block_1.
   - unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2

2. Now, to satisfy constraint 16, we need to make yellow_block_1 not clear. We can put blue_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1.
   - stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1

3. Now, yellow_block_2 is clear and yellow_block_1 is not clear. According to constraint 16, we can now make green_block_1 clear. But before that, let's pick up yellow_block_2 to satisfy constraint 10.
   - pickup yellow_block_2

4. Now we're holding yellow_block_2, which satisfies part of constraint 12. To satisfy constraint 10, we need to make red_block_1 not clear, which means putting something on top of red_block_1. We can use yellow_block_2 for this.
   - stack yellow_block_2 red_block_1

5. Now, red_block_1 is not clear (constraint 9 satisfied). According to constraint 3, if we want to hold red_block_1 (constraint 2), we need to have either "red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1" or "red_block_2 is on top of green_block_2". Let's aim for the second condition. But first, we need to clear red_block_1.
   - unstack yellow_block_2 red_block_1

6. We're now holding yellow_block_2. Let's put it aside for now.
   - putdown yellow_block_2

7. Now, let's move red_block_2. To do this, we first need to unstack yellow_block_1 from red_block_2.
   - unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_2

8. We're holding yellow_block_1. Let's put it on the table for now.
   - putdown yellow_block_1
   (This satisfies the other part of constraint 12: "yellow_block_1 is on the table")

9. Now, we can pick up red_block_2 and put it on green_block_2.
   - pickup red_block_2
   - stack red_block_2 green_block_2
   (This partially satisfies constraint 3)

10. Now, let's unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1 to make green_block_1 clear (constraint 15).
    - unstack red_block_1 green_block_1
    (Now we're holding red_block_1, which satisfies constraint 2)

11. Let's put red_block_1 on the table (constraint 7).
    - putdown red_block_1

12. Now, let's check the constraints we haven't addressed yet:
    - Constraint 1: "green_block_2 is on top of red_block_2". We need to move green_block_2 onto red_block_2, but red_block_2 is on green_block_2 currently.
    - Constraint 4: "yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1 and red_block_2 is not on the table". We need to move yellow_block_1 onto blue_block_1, and red_block_2 should not be on the table (which is already the case).
    - Constraint 11: "you are holding green_block_2". We need to pick up green_block_2.
    - Constraint 13 and 14: "yellow_block_2 is not clear" and "you are holding green_block_2". We need to put something on top of yellow_block_2, and hold green_block_2.

Let's continue:

13. Let's pick up green_block_1 (working towards the goal).
    - pickup green_block_1
    (This satisfies constraint 5: "green_block_1 is not on the table")

14. According to constraint 6, when green_block_1 is not on the table, blue_block_1 should not be clear. Currently, blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, so it's clear. We need to put something on top of blue_block_1. Let's put green_block_1 on top of blue_block_1.
    - stack green_block_1 blue_block_1

15. Now, we need to unstack green_block_2 to put it on top of red_block_2, but first, we need to unstack red_block_2 from green_block_2.
    - unstack red_block_2 green_block_2

16. We're holding red_block_2. Let's put it aside for now.
    - putdown red_block_2

17. Now, let's pick up green_block_2 (constraint 11).
    - pickup green_block_2

18. According to constraint 14, if yellow_block_2 is not clear, we should be holding green_block_2. Let's put green_block_2 on top of yellow_block_2.
    - stack green_block_2 yellow_block_2
    (This satisfies constraint 13 and 14)

19. Now, we need to pick up red_block_2 and put it on the table.
    - pickup red_block_2
    - putdown red_block_2

20. Now, let's unstack green_block_2 from yellow_block_2.
    - unstack green_block_2 yellow_block_2

21. We're holding green_block_2. Let's pick up red_block_2 again to satisfy constraint 1.
    - putdown green_block_2
    - pickup red_block_2
    - putdown red_block_2
    - pickup green_block_2
    - stack green_block_2 red_block_2
    (This satisfies constraint 1)

But I noticed an issue. We need to satisfy constraint 4 by putting yellow_block_1 on top of blue_block_1, but blue_block_1 has green_block_1 on top of it. Let me revisit the plan.

Actually, there's a bigger issue. We need to satisfy constraint 8, which says if red_block_1 is on the table, there must be an earlier state where green_block_1 is not on the table. However, our plan first moves red_block_1 to the table, and then picks up green_block_1. We need to reverse this.

Let's start again:

1. First, we need to make yellow_block_2 clear so that we can pick it up. Currently, blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2, so we need to move blue_block_1.
   - unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2

2. We're holding blue_block_1. Let's put it on yellow_block_1 to make yellow_block_1 not clear.
   - stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1
   (Now, yellow_block_2 is clear and yellow_block_1 is not clear, which sets up for constraint 16)

3. Now, let's pick up yellow_block_2 to satisfy constraint 10 and part of constraint 12.
   - pickup yellow_block_2

4. We're holding yellow_block_2. Let's put it on red_block_1 to make red_block_1 not clear (satisfying constraint 9 and 10).
   - stack yellow_block_2 red_block_1

5. Now, yellow_block_2 is on top of red_block_1. Let's unstack it.
   - unstack yellow_block_2 red_block_1

6. We're holding yellow_block_2. Let's put it on the table for now.
   - putdown yellow_block_2

7. Now, let's unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1 to make green_block_1 clear (constraint 15).
   - unstack red_block_1 green_block_1
   (We're holding red_block_1, which satisfies constraint 2 and "green_block_1 is clear" satisfies constraint 15)

8. Now, according to constraint 3, before holding red_block_1, we need to have either "red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1" or "red_block_2 is on top of green_block_2". But we're already holding red_block_1. Let's putdown red_block_1 and retry.

Actually, I think I'm making this more complex than it needs to be. Let's re-read the constraint 3:

"If expression "you are holding red_block_1" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1", "red_block_2 is on top of green_block_2"""

This means that before we hold red_block_1, one of those two conditions must be true. Let's set up one of those conditions, and then unstack red_block_1.

Alright, let's start again:

1. First, let's unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_2.
   - unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2

2. We're holding blue_block_1. Let's put it on the table for now.
   - putdown blue_block_1

3. Now, let's unstack yellow_block_1 from red_block_2.
   - unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_2

4. We're holding yellow_block_1. Let's put it on the table for now.
   - putdown yellow_block_1
   (This satisfies part of constraint 12: "yellow_block_1 is on the table")

5. Now, let's pick up red_block_2 and put it on green_block_2.
   - pickup red_block_2
   - stack red_block_2 green_block_2
   (Now we have "red_block_2 is on top of green_block_2", which is part of constraint 3)

6. Now, we can unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1.
   - unstack red_block_1 green_block_1
   (We're holding red_block_1, which satisfies constraint 2, and green_block_1 is clear, which satisfies constraint 15)

7. We're holding red_block_1. Let's put it on blue_block_1.
   - stack red_block_1 blue_block_1

8. Now, let's pick up green_block_1.
   - pickup green_block_1
   (This satisfies constraint 5: "green_block_1 is not on the table")

9. According to constraint 6, when green_block_1 is not on the table, blue_block_1 should not be clear. Currently, red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1, so blue_block_1 is not clear. We're good.

10. Now, let's put green_block_1 on the table.
    - putdown green_block_1

11. Let's put yellow_block_1 on top of blue_block_1, but first we need to move red_block_1.
    - unstack red_block_1 blue_block_1
    - putdown red_block_1
    (This satisfies constraint 7: "red_block_1 is on the table")

12. Now, let's pick up yellow_block_1 and put it on blue_block_1.
    - pickup yellow_block_1
    - stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
    (Now we have "yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1" and "red_block_2 is not on the table", which satisfies constraint 4)

13. Now, let's pick up green_block_2 (working towards constraint 11).
    - pickup green_block_2
    (This satisfies constraint 11: "you are holding green_block_2")

14. According to constraint 14, if yellow_block_2 is not clear, we should be holding green_block_2. Let's put green_block_2 on top of yellow_block_2.
    - stack green_block_2 yellow_block_2
    (This satisfies constraint 13: "yellow_block_2 is not clear")

15. Now, let's pick up yellow_block_2 to satisfy constraint 12, but first we need to remove green_block_2.
    - unstack green_block_2 yellow_block_2
    - putdown green_block_2
    - pickup yellow_block_2
    (This satisfies part of constraint 12: "you are holding yellow_block_2")

16. Now, let's put yellow_block_2 on top of red_block_1.
    - stack yellow_block_2 red_block_1
    (This satisfies constraint 9: "red_block_1 is not clear")

17. Now, let's unstack green_block_2 from red_block_2 to satisfy constraint 1.
    - pickup green_block_2
    - stack green_block_2 red_block_2
    (This satisfies constraint 1: "green_block_2 is on top of red_block_2")

18. Finally, let's pick up green_block_1 (the goal).
    - pickup green_block_1

But wait, I just noticed I made a mistake. I said we stack green_block_2 on red_block_2, but I hadn't unstack green_block_2 yet. Let me check my plan again.

Ok I think I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. Let's plan very carefully:

Initial state:
- green_block_1 is on the table.
- red_block_1 is on top of green_block_1.
- red_block_2 is on the table.
- yellow_block_1 is on top of red_block_2.
- green_block_2 is on the table.
- yellow_block_2 is on the table.
- blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2.
- red_block_1, yellow_block_1, green_block_2, and blue_block_1 are clear.
- you are not holding any block.

Goal: "you are holding green_block_1"

Constraints (in order of discussion):
1. At some point, green_block_2 is on top of red_block_2.
2. At some point, you are holding red_block_1.
3. Before you hold red_block_1, either "red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1" or "red_block_2 is on top of green_block_2" must be true.
4. At some point, yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1 and red_block_2 is not on the table.
5. At some point, green_block_1 is not on the table.
6. When green_block_1 is not on the table, blue_block_1 should not be clear at that point or later.
7. At some point, red_block_1 is on the table.
8. Before red_block_1 is on the table, green_block_1 must be not on the table.
9. At some point, red_block_1 is not clear.
10. Before red_block_1 is not clear, you must be holding yellow_block_2.
11. At some point, you are holding green_block_2.
12. At some point, either you are holding yellow_block_2 or yellow_block_1 is on the table.
13. At some point, yellow_block_2 is not clear.
14. When yellow_block_2 is not clear, you should be holding green_block_2 at that point or later.
15. At some point, green_block_1 is clear.
16. Before green_block_1 is clear, yellow_block_2 must be clear and yellow_block_1 must not be clear.

Let's think through a plan:

1. First, let's unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_2.
   - unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2
   (Now, yellow_block_2 is clear, which is needed for constraint 16)

2. We're holding blue_block_1. Let's put it on top of yellow_block_1 to make yellow_block_1 not clear.
   - stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1
   (Now, yellow_block_1 is not clear, which is the second part of constraint 16)

3. Now, let's unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1 to make green_block_1 clear.
   - unstack red_block_1 green_block_1
   (This satisfies constraint 15 (green_block_1 is clear) and constraint 2 (you are holding red_block_1))

4. Before moving red_block_1, we need to satisfy constraint 3. Let's stack red_block_1 on blue_block_1.
   - stack red_block_1 blue_block_1

5. Now, let's pick up red_block_2 and put it on green_block_2.
   - unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_2
   - stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1 (This doesn't work since blue_block_1 already has red_block_1 on it)

Wait, we don't need to do this immediately. Let's try a different approach.

1. First, let's unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_2.
   - unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2
   (Now, yellow_block_2 is clear, which is needed for constraint 16)

2. We're holding blue_block_1. Let's put it on top of yellow_block_1 to make yellow_block_1 not clear.
   - stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1
   (Now, yellow_block_1 is not clear, which is the second part of constraint 16)

3. Now, let's pick up yellow_block_2 to satisfy constraint 10.
   - pickup yellow_block_2
   (This also satisfies part of constraint 12: "you are holding yellow_block_2")

4. Let's put yellow_block_2 on the table for now.
   - putdown yellow_block_2

5. Let's pick up red_block_2 and put it on green_block_2.
   - unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_2
   Hmm, but we just put blue_block_1 on yellow_block_1, so unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_2 wouldn't work because yellow_block_1 is not the top block of the stack.

This is getting too complex. Let me restart and organize our plan better.

Let's first understand the key requirements:
1. green_block_1 is on the table with red_block_1 on top of it.
2. To pick up green_block_1 (the goal), we need to move red_block_1 first.
3. Before red_block_1 is on the table, green_block_1 must not be on the table (constraint 8).
4. Before red_block_1 is not clear, we must hold yellow_block_2 (constraint 10).

Let's try a straightforward approach:

1. Unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_2.
   - unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2

2. Stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_1 (making yellow_block_1 not clear for constraint 16).
   - stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1

3. Pick up yellow_block_2 (for constraint 10 and 12).
   - pickup yellow_block_2

4. Stack yellow_block_2 on red_block_1 (making red_block_1 not clear for constraint 9).
   - stack yellow_block_2 red_block_1

5. Unstack yellow_block_2 from red_block_1.
   - unstack yellow_block_2 red_block_1

6. Put yellow_block_2 on the table.
   - putdown yellow_block_2

7. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1 (making green_block_1 clear for constraint 15 and holding red_block_1 for constraint 2).
   - unstack red_block_1 green_block_1

8. Before putting red_block_1 on the table (constraint 7), we need to ensure green_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 8). So, let's put red_block_1 on yellow_block_2.
   - stack red_block_1 yellow_block_2

9. Pick up green_block_1 (satisfying constraint 5).
   - pickup green_block_1

10. According to constraint 6, when green_block_1 is not on the table, blue_block_1 should not be clear at that point or later. Currently, blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, so it's clear. We need to put something on top of blue_block_1.
    - stack green_block_1 blue_block_1
    (This makes blue_block_1 not clear, satisfying constraint 6)

11. Unstack red_block_1 from yellow_block_2.
    - unstack red_block_1 yellow_block_2

12. Put red_block_1 on the table (satisfying constraint 7).
    - putdown red_block_1

13. Now, for constraint 4, we need yellow_block_1 on top of blue_block_1. But blue_block_1 currently has green_block_1 on top of it. So, first unstack green_block_1.
    - unstack green_block_1 blue_block_1

14. Put green_block_1 on the table.
    - putdown green_block_1

15. Unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1.
    - unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1

16. Put blue_block_1 on the table.
    - putdown blue_block_1

17. Pick up yellow_block_1.
    - pickup yellow_block_1

18. Stack yellow_block_1 on blue_block_1 (satisfying part of constraint 4).
    - stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1

19. Now we need to make sure red_block_2 is not on the table (the second part of constraint 4).
    - unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_2 (But this doesn't work because yellow_block_1 is now on blue_block_1, not on red_block_2)

Hmm, there's a mistake in my understanding. Let me reread the initial state.

Initial state (corrected):
- green_block_1 is on the table.
- red_block_1 is on top of green_block_1.
- red_block_2 is on the table.
- yellow_block_1 is on top of red_block_2.
- green_block_2 is on the table.
- yellow_block_2 is on the table.
- blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2.
- red_block_1, yellow_block_1, green_block_2, and blue_block_1 are clear.
- you are not holding any block.

So, yellow_block_1 is on top of red_block_2 and blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2. Let's restart.

1. First, unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_2 (making yellow_block_2 clear for constraint 16).
   - unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2

2. Put blue_block_1 on the table for now.
   - putdown blue_block_1

3. Pick up yellow_block_1 from red_block_2.
   - unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_2

4. Stack yellow_block_1 on blue_block_1 (making yellow_block_1 not clear, which we need for constraint 16).
   - stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1

5. Pick up yellow_block_2 (for constraint 10 and 12).
   - pickup yellow_block_2

6. Stack yellow_block_2 on red_block_1 (making red_block_1 not clear for constraint 9).
   - stack yellow_block_2 red_block_1

7. Pick up red_block_2 (to get it off the table for constraint 4).
   - pickup red_block_2

8. Stack red_block_2 on green_block_2 (satisfying part of constraint 3).
   - stack red_block_2 green_block_2

9. Unstack yellow_block_2 from red_block_1.
   - unstack yellow_block_2 red_block_1

10. Put yellow_block_2 on the table.
    - putdown yellow_block_2

11. Unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1 (making green_block_1 clear for constraint 15 and holding red_block_1 for constraint 2).
    - unstack red_block_1 green_block_1

12. Before putting red_block_1 on the table (constraint 7), we need to ensure green_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 8). Let's put red_block_1 on yellow_block_2.
    - stack red_block_1 yellow_block_2

13. Pick up green_block_1 (satisfying constraint 5).
    - pickup green_block_1

14. According to constraint 6, when green_block_1 is not on the table, blue_block_1 should not be clear. But blue_block_1 currently has yellow_block_1 on top of it, so it's already not clear.

15. Put green_block_1 on the table.
    - putdown green_block_1

16. Unstack red_block_1 from yellow_block_2.
    - unstack red_block_1 yellow_block_2

17. Put red_block_1 on the table (satisfying constraint 7).
    - putdown red_block_1

18. Now, we need to satisfy constraint 1 (green_block_2 on top of red_block_2) and constraint 11 (holding green_block_2). But red_block_2 is on top of green_block_2. Let's unstack red_block_2.
    - unstack red_block_2 green_block_2

19. Put red_block_2 on the table.
    - putdown red_block_2

20. Pick up green_block_2 (satisfying constraint 11).
    - pickup green_block_2

21. Stack green_block_2 on red_block_2 (satisfying constraint 1).
    - stack green_block_2 red_block_2

22. For constraint 13 and 14, we need yellow_block_2 to not be clear, and after that, we need to hold green_block_2. Let's pick up green_block_2 again.
    - unstack green_block_2 red_block_2
    - stack green_block_2 yellow_block_2

    (This satisfies constraint 13, and we've already held green_block_2 (constraint 11), so constraint 14 is satisfied)

23. Finally, pick up green_block_1 (the goal).
    - pickup green_block_1

So the plan is:
1. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2
2. putdown blue_block_1
3. unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_2
4. stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
5. pickup yellow_block_2
6. stack yellow_block_2 red_block_1
7. pickup red_block_2
8. stack red_block_2 green_block_2
9. unstack yellow_block_2 red_block_1
10. putdown yellow_block_2
11. unstack red_block_1 green_block_1
12. stack red_block_1 yellow_block_2
13. pickup green_block_1
14. putdown green_block_1
15. unstack red_block_1 yellow_block_2
16. putdown red_block_1
17. unstack red_block_2 green_block_2
18. putdown red_block_2
19. pickup green_block_2
20. stack green_block_2 red_block_2
21. unstack green_block_2 red_block_2
22. stack green_block_2 yellow_block_2
23. pickup green_block_1

Let's double-check each constraint again:
1. green_block_2 is on top of red_block_2: Satisfied in step 20.
2. Holding red_block_1: Satisfied in step 11.
3. Before holding red_block_1, either "red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1" or "red_block_2 is on top of green_block_2": Satisfied in step 8, before step 11.
4. Yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1 and red_block_2 is not on the table: Satisfied in step 4 and step 7 onwards.
5. green_block_1 is not on the table: Satisfied in step 13.
6. When green_block_1 is not on the table, blue_block_1 should not be clear at that point or later: Satisfied since yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1 from step 4 onwards.
7. red_block_1 is on the table: Satisfied in step 16.
8. Before red_block_1 is on the table, green_block_1 must be not on the table: Satisfied in step 13 (before step 16).
9. red_block_1 is not clear: Satisfied in step 6.
10. Before red_block_1 is not clear, you must be holding yellow_block_2: Satisfied in step 5 (before step 6).
11. Holding green_block_2: Satisfied in step 19.
12. Either holding yellow_block_2 or yellow_block_1 is on the table: Satisfied in step 5.
13. yellow_block_2 is not clear: Satisfied in step 22.
14. When yellow_block_2 is not clear, you should be holding green_block_2 at that point or later: Satisfied since we've already held green_block_2 (step 19) before making yellow_block_2 not clear (step 22).
15. green_block_1 is clear: Satisfied in step 11.
16. Before green_block_1 is clear, yellow_block_2 must be clear and yellow_block_1 must not be clear: Satisfied in steps 1 and 4 (before step 11).

Ok, I think all constraints are satisfied. The plan starts at the initial state and end with the goal state. But let me see if I can optimize it a bit more.

Actually, I think we can make a few simplifications, specifically:

1. We don't need to put green_block_1 down in step 14 and pick it up again in step 23. We can just keep holding it.

Let's rewrite the plan with this optimization:

1. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2
2. putdown blue_block_1
3. unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_2
4. stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
5. pickup yellow_block_2
6. stack yellow_block_2 red_block_1
7. pickup red_block_2
8. stack red_block_2 green_block_2
9. unstack yellow_block_2 red_block_1
10. putdown yellow_block_2
11. unstack red_block_1 green_block_1
12. stack red_block_1 yellow_block_2
13. pickup green_block_1
14. putdown green_block_1
15. unstack red_block_1 yellow_block_2
16. putdown red_block_1
17. unstack red_block_2 green_block_2
18. putdown red_block_2
19. pickup green_block_2
20. stack green_block_2 red_block_2
21. unstack green_block_2 red_block_2
22. stack green_block_2 yellow_block_2
23. pickup green_block_1

But then again, I do think we need to put green_block_1 down in step 14. We need to ensure red_block_1 is on the table (constraint 7), and to do this, we need to unstack red_block_1. Until step 12, our hands are never free.

However, I realized that the constraint that caused us to stack red_block_1 on yellow_block_2 (constraint 8) simply says that green_block_1 must be not on the table before red_block_1 is on the table. It doesn't specify any constraint about how directly a cause red_block_1 is on the table. We can satisfy this constraint by ensuring at some point green_block_1 is not on the table before red_block_1 is on the table.

So, we can simplify steps 11-17:

11. unstack red_block_1 green_block_1 (making green_block_1 clear for constraint 15 and holding red_block_1 for constraint 2, and green_block_1 is now not on the table, satisfying constraint 5)
12. putdown red_block_1 (satisfying constraint 7, and since green_block_1 was not on the table in the previous step, constraint 8 is satisfied)
13. pickup green_block_1

So our simplified plan is:
1. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2
2. putdown blue_block_1
3. unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_2
4. stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
5. pickup yellow_block_2
6. stack yellow_block_2 red_block_1
7. pickup red_block_2
8. stack red_block_2 green_block_2
9. unstack yellow_block_2 red_block_1
10. putdown yellow_block_2
11. unstack red_block_1 green_block_1
12. putdown red_block_1
13. pickup green_block_1
14. putdown green_block_1
15. unstack red_block_2 green_block_2
16. putdown red_block_2
17. pickup green_block_2
18. stack green_block_2 red_block_2
19. unstack green_block_2 red_block_2
20. stack green_block_2 yellow_block_2
21. pickup green_block_1

Hold up. I made a mistake again. I said in step 11 red_block_1 was on green_block_1, which is correct based on the initial state. I somehow imagined we moved it.

Ok let's redo the plan as follows:

1. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2
2. putdown blue_block_1
3. unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_2
4. stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
5. pickup yellow_block_2
6. stack yellow_block_2 red_block_1
7. pickup red_block_2
8. stack red_block_2 green_block_2
9. unstack yellow_block_2 red_block_1
10. putdown yellow_block_2
11. unstack red_block_1 green_block_1
12. putdown red_block_1
13. pickup green_block_1
14. putdown green_block_1
15. unstack red_block_2 green_block_2
16. putdown red_block_2
17. pickup green_block_2
18. stack green_block_2 red_block_2
19. unstack green_block_2 red_block_2
20. stack green_block_2 yellow_block_2
21. pickup green_block_1

Also wait, I'm not sure if I need to putdown green_block_1 at step 14. I already have green_block_1 in hand, so I can just hold onto it, unless there's a constraint that's going to mess with this. Let me check. But actually, I'm going to put down green_block_1, because we already planned out the execution and double checked the constraints, and nothing that comes after step 13 requires green_block_1 to not be on the table.

Let me just verify that the plan properly addresses all constraints:
1. green_block_2 is on top of red_block_2: Satisfied in step 18.
2. Holding red_block_1: Satisfied in step 11.
3. Before holding red_block_1, either "red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1" or "red_block_2 is on top of green_block_2": Satisfied in step 8, before step 11.
4. Yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1 and red_block_2 is not on the table: Satisfied in step 4 and step 7 onwards.
5. green_block_1 is not on the table: Satisfied in step 13.
6. When green_block_1 is not on the table, blue_block_1 should not be clear at that point or later: Satisfied since yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1 from step 4 onwards.
7. red_block_1 is on the table: Satisfied in step 12.
8. Before red_block_1 is on the table, green_block_1 must be not on the table: Satisfied in step 11 and 12, where green_block_1 is not on the table (because it's being unstacked) at the same time red_block_1 is on the table. But since the constraint requires it to be "an earlier state", I'm not 100% sure this this satisfies this.

Let me think through constraint 8 again: "If expression 'red_block_1 is on the table' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'green_block_1 is not on the table'".

Step 11 we unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1, so at the end of that step, we are holding red_block_1, and green_block_1 is on the table.
Step 12 we putdown red_block_1, so now red_block_1 is on the table.
step 13 we pickup green_block_1, so now green_block_1 is not on the table.
But this doesn't satisfy constraint 8 because the state where green_block_1 is not on the table is after, not before, the state where red_block_1 is on the table.

Let's update the plan. After step 11, we should put red_block_1 on blue_block_1, not on the table. Then we can pick up green_block_1, and then put red_block_1 on the table. 

1. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2
2. putdown blue_block_1
3. unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_2
4. stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1

Hmm, but blue_block_1 already has yellow_block_1 on top of it. So we can't stack red_block_1 there. This is a dilemma...

Let's rethink. Maybe we need to change our plan significantly.

1. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2
2. putdown blue_block_1
3. unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_2
4. stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
5. pickup yellow_block_2
6. stack yellow_block_2 red_block_1
7. pickup red_block_2
8. stack red_block_2 green_block_2
9. unstack yellow_block_2 red_block_1
10. putdown yellow_block_2
11. unstack red_block_1 green_block_1
12. stack red_block_1 yellow_block_2 (now red_block_1 is on yellow_block_2, not on the table)
13. pickup green_block_1 (green_block_1 is not on the table, satisfying constraint 5)
14. putdown green_block_1 (green_block_1 is back on the table)
15. unstack red_block_1 yellow_block_2
16. putdown red_block_1 (now red_block_1 is on the table, satisfying constraint 7, and before this, green_block_1 was not on the table (in step 13), satisfying constraint 8)
17. unstack red_block_2 green_block_2
18. putdown red_block_2
19. pickup green_block_2
20. stack green_block_2 red_block_2
21. unstack green_block_2 red_block_2
22. stack green_block_2 yellow_block_2
23. pickup green_block_1

I'm just going to double-check the plan to make sure it works and adderesss the constraints properly.

1. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2
2. putdown blue_block_1
3. unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_2
4. stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
5. pickup yellow_block_2
6. stack yellow_block_2 red_block_1
7. pickup red_block_2
8. stack red_block_2 green_block_2
9. unstack yellow_block_2 red_block_1
10. putdown yellow_block_2
11. unstack red_block_1 green_block_1
12. stack red_block_1 yellow_block_2
13. pickup green_block_1
14. putdown green_block_1
15. unstack red_block_1 yellow_block_2
16. putdown red_block_1
17. unstack red_block_2 green_block_2
18. putdown red_block_2
19. pickup green_block_2
20. stack green_block_2 red_block_2
21. unstack green_block_2 red_block_2
22. stack green_block_2 yellow_block_2
23. pickup green_block_1

1. green_block_2 is on top of red_block_2: Satisfied in step 20.
2. Holding red_block_1: Satisfied in step 11.
3. Before holding red_block_1, either "red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1" or "red_block_2 is on top of green_block_2": Satisfied in step 8, before step 11.
4. Yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1 and red_block_2 is not on the table: Satisfied in step 4 and step 7 onwards.
5. green_block_1 is not on the table: Satisfied in step 13.
6. When green_block_1 is not on the table, blue_block_1 should not be clear at that point or later: Satisfied since yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1 from step 4 onwards.
7. red_block_1 is on the table: Satisfied in step 16.
8. Before red_block_1 is on the table, green_block_1 must be not on the table: Satisfied in step 13 (before step 16).
9. red_block_1 is not clear: Satisfied in step 6.
10. Before red_block_1 is not clear, you must be holding yellow_block_2: Satisfied in step 5 (before step 6).
11. Holding green_block_2: Satisfied in step 19.
12. Either holding yellow_block_2 or yellow_block_1 is on the table: Satisfied in step 5.
13. yellow_block_2 is not clear: Satisfied in step 22.
14. When yellow_block_2 is not clear, you should be holding green_block_2 at that point or later: Satisfied since we've already held green_block_2 (step 19) before making yellow_block_2 not clear (step 22).
15. green_block_1 is clear: Satisfied in step 11.
16. Before green_block_1 is clear, yellow_block_2 must be clear and yellow_block_1 must not be clear: Satisfied in steps 1 and 4 (before step 11).

Ok, this checks out. We actually have 23 steps in our plan and I think it's a 100% valid plan that satisfies the conditions.

Let me re-read the problem statement once to make sure we have the goal state:
- Goal: "you are holding green_block_1"

Step 23 in the plan above is "pickup green_block_1", which leaves us holding green_block_1. So the goal state is achieved.

So our final plan is:
1. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2
2. putdown blue_block_1
3. unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_2
4. stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
5. pickup yellow_block_2
6. stack yellow_block_2 red_block_1
7. pickup red_block_2
8. stack red_block_2 green_block_2
9. unstack yellow_block_2 red_block_1
10. putdown yellow_block_2
11. unstack red_block_1 green_block_1
12. stack red_block_1 yellow_block_2
13. pickup green_block_1
14. putdown green_block_1
15. unstack red_block_1 yellow_block_2
16. putdown red_block_1
17. unstack red_block_2 green_block_2
18. putdown red_block_2
19. pickup green_block_2
20. stack green_block_2 red_block_2
21. unstack green_block_2 red_block_2
22. stack green_block_2 yellow_block_2
23. pickup green_block_1
