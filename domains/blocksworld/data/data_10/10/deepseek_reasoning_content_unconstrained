Okay, let's see. The goal is to have the robotic arm holding green_block_1. So I need to figure out how to get from the initial state to that. Let me start by looking at the initial setup.

In the initial state, green_block_1 is on the table, and red_block_1 is on top of it. Red_block_1 is clear, so nothing is on it. So to pick up green_block_1, it needs to be clear and on the table. But right now, red_block_1 is on top of it, which means green_block_1 is not clear. So the first thing I need to do is remove red_block_1 from green_block_1.

To remove red_block_1, since it's on green_block_1 and it's clear, I can unstack it. The unstack action requires that the block (red_block_1) is on top of another block (green_block_1), is clear, and the arm isn't holding anything. All those conditions are met. So unstack red_block_1 from green_block_1. After that, the arm is holding red_block_1, and green_block_1 becomes clear. Then I need to put down red_block_1 somewhere so that the arm is free to pick up green_block_1.

Wait, but after unstacking red_block_1, I'm holding it. So the next step would be to put it down on the table. So putdown red_block_1. Then, green_block_1 is on the table and clear, so I can pickup green_block_1. That should achieve the goal.

But wait, let me check the preconditions again. After unstacking red_block_1 from green_block_1, the effects are: red_block_1 is no longer on green_block_1, green_block_1 becomes clear, and the arm is holding red_block_1. So then, to putdown red_block_1, the precondition is that the arm is holding it. So that's allowed. Then after putdown, the arm is free again. Then pickup green_block_1: since it's on the table and clear, and the arm is empty, so that works.

So the plan would be:

1. unstack red_block_1 green_block_1
2. putdown red_block_1
3. pickup green_block_1

That's three actions. Is there a shorter way? Let's think. Suppose instead of putting red_block_1 on the table, could I stack it somewhere else? But the goal is only to hold green_block_1. So once red_block_1 is off, the next action is to pick up green_block_1. So no, the steps I outlined seem necessary. Because you can't pickup green_block_1 until red_block_1 is removed, and you can't just unstack and then immediately pick up, because after unstack, you're holding red_block_1. So you have to put it down first.

Therefore, the optimal plan is three steps. Let me make sure there are no other blocks in the way. Let's check the initial state again. The other blocks: red_block_2 has yellow_block_1 on it, which is clear. yellow_block_2 has blue_block_1 on it, which is clear. So those stacks are separate. The other blocks on the table are green_block_2, which is clear. But the goal is only about green_block_1. So the other blocks don't interfere. Therefore, the three steps are correct.
