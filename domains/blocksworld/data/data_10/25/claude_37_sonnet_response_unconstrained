Let me represent the initial state:
- green_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
- black_block_2 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- black_block_1 is clear
- black_block_2 is clear
- brown_block_1 is clear
- You are not holding any block

And the goal state is:
- You are holding green_block_1

So, we need to pick up green_block_1 from the table. But we need to make sure the preconditions are satisfied. Let's check the preconditions for "pickup green_block_1":
1. green_block_1 must be clear (i.e., there is no block on top of it) - NOT SATISFIED, grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
2. green_block_1 must be on the table - SATISFIED
3. You must not be holding any block - SATISFIED

So, we need to make green_block_1 clear before we can pick it up. This means we need to remove grey_block_2 from the top of green_block_1.

But to do that, we need to remove black_block_1 from the top of grey_block_2 first.

Let's check the preconditions for "unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2":
1. black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2 - SATISFIED
2. black_block_1 is clear - SATISFIED
3. You are not holding any block - SATISFIED

So, we can perform "unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2". After this action, we would be holding black_block_1 and grey_block_2 would be clear.

Next, we need to put black_block_1 somewhere. We can either put it on the table or stack it on another block. For simplicity, let's put it on the table.

Let's check the preconditions for "putdown black_block_1":
1. You are holding black_block_1 - SATISFIED (after the unstack action)

So, we can perform "putdown black_block_1". After this action, black_block_1 would be on the table, clear, and you wouldn't be holding any block.

Now, let's check the preconditions for "unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1":
1. grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1 - SATISFIED
2. grey_block_2 is clear - SATISFIED (after removing black_block_1)
3. You are not holding any block - SATISFIED (after putting down black_block_1)

So, we can perform "unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1". After this action, we would be holding grey_block_2 and green_block_1 would be clear.

Next, we need to put grey_block_2 somewhere. Let's put it on the table.

Let's check the preconditions for "putdown grey_block_2":
1. You are holding grey_block_2 - SATISFIED (after the unstack action)

So, we can perform "putdown grey_block_2". After this action, grey_block_2 would be on the table, clear, and you wouldn't be holding any block.

Finally, we can pick up green_block_1.

Let's check the preconditions for "pickup green_block_1":
1. green_block_1 is clear - SATISFIED (after removing grey_block_2)
2. green_block_1 is on the table - SATISFIED
3. You are not holding any block - SATISFIED (after putting down grey_block_2)

So, we can perform "pickup green_block_1". After this action, you would be holding green_block_1, which is the goal.

Let's summarize the plan:
1. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2
2. putdown black_block_1
3. unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1
4. putdown grey_block_2
5. pickup green_block_1

This plan achieves the goal of holding green_block_1 while satisfying all the preconditions for each action. 

I need to double-check that this is the optimal plan - the shortest possible.

I believe this is already the optimal plan, because in order to pick up green_block_1, we first need to make it clear. To make green_block_1 clear, we need to remove grey_block_2 from the top of it. To remove grey_block_2, we need to first remove black_block_1 from the top of grey_block_2. And once we've unstacked a block, we need to put it somewhere (either on the table or on another block) before we can proceed. So, the minimum number of actions required to achieve the goal is 5, which is what our plan has.

We need to confirm:
- unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2
  - Preconditions: (1) black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2, (2) black_block_1 is clear, (3) you're not holding any block.
  - All satisfied.
  - Post-condition: You're holding black_block_1, grey_block_2 is clear.
- putdown black_block_1
  - Preconditions: You're holding black_block_1.
  - Satisfied.
  - Post-condition: black_block_1 is on the table, black_block_1 is clear, you're not holding any block.
- unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1
  - Preconditions: (1) grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1, (2) grey_block_2 is clear, (3) you're not holding any block.
  - All satisfied.
  - Post-condition: You're holding grey_block_2, green_block_1 is clear.
- putdown grey_block_2
  - Preconditions: You're holding grey_block_2.
  - Satisfied.
  - Post-condition: grey_block_2 is on the table, grey_block_2 is clear, you're not holding any block.
- pickup green_block_1
  - Preconditions: (1) green_block_1 is clear, (2) green_block_1 is on the table, (3) you're not holding any block.
  - All satisfied.
  - Post-condition: You're holding green_block_1. (Goal achieved)

Yes, this seems correct and optimal.

Wait, let me check if we have any other way of removing the blocks on top of green_block_1 more efficiently, since I'm unsure if this is the optimal plan.

First, we explore the action of unstacking black_block_1 from grey_block_2, leading to holding black_block_1. We have several options from here:
1. "putdown black_block_1" (put it on the table, as in our plan)
2. "stack black_block_1 black_block_2" (place black_block_1 on top of black_block_2, since black_block_2 is clear)
3. "stack black_block_1 brown_block_1" (place black_block_1 on top of brown_block_1, since brown_block_1 is clear)

Next, we unstack grey_block_2 from green_block_1, leading to holding grey_block_2. Again, we have options:
1. "putdown grey_block_2" (put it on the table, as in our plan)
2. "stack grey_block_2 black_block_1" (place grey_block_2 on top of black_block_1, since black_block_1 is clear after the putdown)
3. "stack grey_block_2 black_block_2" (place grey_block_2 on top of black_block_2, since black_block_2 is clear)
4. "stack grey_block_2 brown_block_1" (place grey_block_2 on top of brown_block_1, since brown_block_1 is clear)

But regardless of where we place black_block_1 and grey_block_2, we still need to perform the same number of actions: unstack, [place somewhere], unstack, [place somewhere], pickup. So, our original plan remains optimal with a length of 5 actions.

So, the optimal plan is:
1. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2
2. putdown black_block_1
3. unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1
4. putdown grey_block_2
5. pickup green_block_1
