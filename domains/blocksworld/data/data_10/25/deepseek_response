**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **pickup brown_block_1**: Since brown_block_1 is initially clear and on orange_block_1, the robot can pick it up. This action starts addressing constraints 10 (brown_block_1 on table later) and 11 (needs brown_block_1 not clear).

2. **stack brown_block_1 black_block_2**: Places brown_block_1 on black_block_2, satisfying part of constraint 1 (black_block_2 has a block). Also, brown_block_1 is no longer clear, aiding constraint 11.

3. **unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2**: Removes black_block_1 from grey_block_2, preparing to clear green_block_1. Ensures constraint 4 (black_block_1 never on table).

4. **stack black_block_1 brown_block_1**: Places black_block_1 on brown_block_1 (now on black_block_2), making black_block_1 not clear (satisfies constraint 2). Also fulfills constraint 3 via prior brown_block_1 placement.

5. **unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1**: Clears green_block_1, satisfying constraint 12. Constraint 13 is met via earlier brown_block_1 placement.

6. **stack grey_block_2 black_block_2**: Directly satisfies constraint 6 (grey_block_2 on black_block_2).

7. **unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1**: Picks up orange_block_1, which is now clear after removing brown_block_1. Satisfies part of constraint 1 (holding orange_block_1).

8. **stack orange_block_1 grey_block_2**: Places orange_block_1 on grey_block_2 (now on black_block_2), fulfilling the rest of constraint 11 (orange_block_1 on black_block_2 via grey_block_2).

9. **unstack brown_block_1 black_block_1**: Prepares to reset brown_block_1 to meet constraint 10 (brown_block_1 on table).

10. **putdown brown_block_1**: Places brown_block_1 on the table, satisfying constraint 10.

11. **unstack grey_block_2 orange_block_1**: Addresses constraint 8 (grey_block_2 not on orange_block_1 at this step). Constraint 9 is later satisfied by stacking brown_block_1 on grey_block_2.

12. **stack grey_block_2 black_block_2**: Finalizes grey_block_2's position to meet constraint 6.

13. **unstack green_block_1 table**: Finally picks up green_block_1, which is now clear and meets all constraints.
