This is a complex Blocksworld planning problem with various constraints. Let me start by understanding the current state and the goal.

Initial State:
- green_block_1 is on the table with grey_block_2 on top of it, and black_block_1 on top of grey_block_2. black_block_1 is clear (nothing on top).
- grey_block_1 is on the table with orange_block_1 on top of it, and brown_block_1 on top of orange_block_1. brown_block_1 is clear.
- black_block_2 is on the table and clear.
- The arm is empty.

Visual representation:
```
  black_block_1   brown_block_1   black_block_2
       |               |
  grey_block_2    orange_block_1
       |               |
  green_block_1   grey_block_1
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

Goal:
- You are holding green_block_1

To achieve the goal, I need to:
1. Clear green_block_1 by removing the blocks above it (grey_block_2 and black_block_1)
2. Pick up green_block_1

However, there are many constraints that I need to satisfy along the way. Let me analyze these constraints:

1. **At least one state where**: "you are holding orange_block_1" AND "black_block_2 is not clear" (has something on top)
2. **At least one state where**: "black_block_1 is not clear"
3. **Conditional constraint**: If "black_block_1 is not clear", then earlier "brown_block_1 is on the table" OR "grey_block_1 is not on the table"
4. **Always true**: "black_block_1 is not on the table"
5. **At least one state where**: "grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1"
6. **Conditional constraint**: If "grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1", then later "grey_block_2 is on top of black_block_2"
7. **Always true**: "grey_block_2 is not on the table"
8. **At least one state where**: "grey_block_2 is not on top of orange_block_1"
9. **Conditional constraint**: If "grey_block_2 is not on top of orange_block_1", then "brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2" at the same state or later
10. **At least one state where**: "brown_block_1 is on the table" OR "you are holding grey_block_1"
11. **At least one state where**: "brown_block_1 is not clear" AND "orange_block_1 is on top of black_block_2"
12. **At least one state where**: "green_block_1 is clear"
13. **Conditional constraint**: If "green_block_1 is clear", then earlier "orange_block_1 is clear" OR "brown_block_1 is on the table"
14. **At least one state where**: "grey_block_1 is clear"

In the initial state, constraint #2 (black_block_1 is not clear) is not satisfied because black_block_1 is clear. Constraint #5 (grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1) is already satisfied.

Let me think through a plan to satisfy all constraints and reach the goal:

1. First, I need to ensure that black_block_1 becomes not clear. This means I need to stack something on it.
2. According to constraint #3, before making black_block_1 not clear, I need to either have brown_block_1 on the table or grey_block_1 not on the table.
3. I also need to make green_block_1 clear to be able to pick it up. But according to constraint #13, before making green_block_1 clear, I need to either have orange_block_1 clear or brown_block_1 on the table.
4. Constraint #6 says if grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1 (which it is initially), then later grey_block_2 must be on top of black_block_2.
5. Constraint #10 requires that at some point, either brown_block_1 is on the table or I'm holding grey_block_1.
6. Constraint #11 requires that at some point, brown_block_1 has something on top AND orange_block_1 is on top of black_block_2.

This is quite complex, so let me start building a tentative plan and adjust it as needed to satisfy all constraints:

Initial decision: I need to satisfy constraint #3 first (before making black_block_1 not clear). I can either put brown_block_1 on the table or move grey_block_1 from the table. Let me choose to move brown_block_1 to the table.

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1

Now brown_block_1 is on the table, satisfying the condition in constraint #3 and part of constraint #10.

Now I need to make black_block_1 not clear (constraint #2). I can stack something on it.

3. unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1  
4. stack orange_block_1 black_block_1

Now black_block_1 is not clear, satisfying constraint #2.

According to constraint #1, I need to hold orange_block_1 and have something on black_block_2 at the same time. Let me continue:

5. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2
6. stack black_block_1 black_block_2

Now I need to be holding orange_block_1 while black_block_2 is not clear:

7. unstack orange_block_1 black_block_1

At this point, I'm holding orange_block_1 and black_block_2 is not clear (has black_block_1 on top), satisfying constraint #1.

According to constraint #6, if grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1 (which was true initially), then grey_block_2 must be on top of black_block_2 at some later state. I'll do that next:

8. stack orange_block_1 brown_block_1
9. unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1
10. stack grey_block_2 black_block_1

Now grey_block_2 is on top of black_block_1, which is on top of black_block_2, satisfying constraint #6.

Constraint #9 says if grey_block_2 is not on top of orange_block_1 (which is true now), then brown_block_1 must be on top of grey_block_2 later.

11. unstack orange_block_1 brown_block_1
12. stack orange_block_1 grey_block_2

For constraint #11, I need brown_block_1 to be not clear and orange_block_1 to be on top of black_block_2. First, I'll move orange_block_1 to black_block_2:

13. unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_2  
14. unstack grey_block_2 black_block_1
15. unstack black_block_1 black_block_2
16. stack orange_block_1 black_block_2
17. stack black_block_1 orange_block_1

Now to make brown_block_1 not clear:

18. stack grey_block_2 brown_block_1

Now brown_block_1 is not clear and orange_block_1 is on top of black_block_2, satisfying constraint #11.

For constraint #9, I need brown_block_1 on top of grey_block_2, which is not the case currently. Let me rearrange:

19. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
20. unstack black_block_1 orange_block_1
21. stack black_block_1 grey_block_1
22. stack brown_block_1 black_block_1

Now grey_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint #14.

Now I need to make green_block_1 clear (constraint #12) and then pick it up (the goal):

23. unstack brown_block_1 black_block_1
24. stack brown_block_1 grey_block_2
25. unstack grey_block_2 black_block_1
26. stack grey_block_2 orange_block_1

Now I satisfy constraint #9 (brown_block_1 on top of grey_block_2).

27. pickup green_block_1

Now I'm holding green_block_1, achieving the goal.

Wait, let me double-check this plan against all constraints:
- Constraint #1 (holding orange_block_1 and black_block_2 not clear): Met at step 7
- Constraint #2 (black_block_1 not clear): Met at step 4
- Constraint #3 (before black_block_1 not clear, brown_block_1 on table OR grey_block_1 not on table): Met by putting brown_block_1 on table in step 2 before making black_block_1 not clear in step 4
- Constraint #4 (black_block_1 never on table): black_block_1 is never put on the table in my plan
- Constraint #5 (grey_block_2 on top of green_block_1): Already true in initial state
- Constraint #6 (if grey_block_2 on green_block_1, then later grey_block_2 on black_block_2): Satisfied by step 10
- Constraint #7 (grey_block_2 never on table): grey_block_2 is never put on the table in my plan
- Constraint #8 (grey_block_2 not on top of orange_block_1): Met in steps after step 2
- Constraint #9 (if grey_block_2 not on orange_block_1, then brown_block_1 on grey_block_2): Satisfied by step 24
- Constraint #10 (brown_block_1 on table OR holding grey_block_1): Satisfied by step 2 (brown_block_1 on table)
- Constraint #11 (brown_block_1 not clear AND orange_block_1 on black_block_2): Satisfied by step 18
- Constraint #12 (green_block_1 clear): Satisfied before step 27
- Constraint #13 (before green_block_1 clear, orange_block_1 clear OR brown_block_1 on table): Satisfied by step 2 (brown_block_1 on table)
- Constraint #14 (grey_block_1 clear): Satisfied before step 21

Wait, I see several issues with my plan:
1. In step 27, I try to pickup green_block_1, but green_block_1 isn't clear yet.
2. I need to ensure I clear green_block_1 before picking it up.

Let me correct my plan:

I see that there's a contradiction in my planning - I can't have green_block_1 clear (to pick it up) while maintaining constraints like grey_block_2 never being on the table. Let me rethink this more carefully.

Actually, let me carefully trace the state of the world through each step of my plan to ensure it's valid.

Wait, my plan has another issue. At step 25, black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1, so I can't unstack it. I need to revise my plan significantly.

Let me try again with a fresh approach. I'll start with the initial state:
```
  black_block_1   brown_block_1   black_block_2
       |               |
  grey_block_2    orange_block_1
       |               |
  green_block_1   grey_block_1
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1

Now brown_block_1 is on the table, satisfying part of constraint #10 and the condition for constraint #13.

3. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2
4. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1

Now black_block_1 is not clear (with something on top), satisfying constraint #2. Also, the condition in constraint #3 was satisfied before this (brown_block_1 on the table).

5. unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1
6. stack orange_block_1 black_block_2

Now constraint #8 is satisfied (grey_block_2 not on top of orange_block_1).

7. unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1
8. stack grey_block_2 black_block_1

Now grey_block_2 is on top of black_block_1, which satisfies part of constraint #9. At this point:
- green_block_1 is clear (constraint #12)
- grey_block_1 is clear (constraint #14)

Since constraint #6 requires that if grey_block_2 is on green_block_1, then later grey_block_2 must be on black_block_2, I need to ensure this happens. But grey_block_2 is currently on black_block_1, not black_block_2.

Let me continue:

9. stack grey_block_1 orange_block_1

This helps with constraint #11, but I made an error - I can't just "stack grey_block_1" because I'm not holding it. Let me fix this:

9. pickup grey_block_1
10. stack grey_block_1 orange_block_1

At this point, I'm satisfying constraint #10 (holding grey_block_1).

Now I need to satisfy constraint #1 (holding orange_block_1 and black_block_2 not clear). orange_block_1 is under grey_block_1, so I need to reorganize.

Let me try again. I'm getting confused with all these constraints. Let me approach this more systematically.

Let's start with the initial state:
```
  black_block_1   brown_block_1   black_block_2
       |               |
  grey_block_2    orange_block_1
       |               |
  green_block_1   grey_block_1
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1

Now brown_block_1 is on the table, satisfying part of constraint #10 and the condition for constraint #13. The world looks like:
```
  black_block_1              black_block_2    brown_block_1
       |                
  grey_block_2    orange_block_1
       |               |
  green_block_1   grey_block_1
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

3. unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1
4. stack orange_block_1 black_block_2

Now orange_block_1 is on black_block_2, which will help with constraint #11. The world looks like:
```
  black_block_1                   orange_block_1   brown_block_1
       |                               |
  grey_block_2                    black_block_2
       |               
  green_block_1   grey_block_1
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

5. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2
6. stack black_block_1 orange_block_1

Now black_block_1 is not clear (it wasn't clear before due to having grey_block_2 on top of it), and now it's on top of orange_block_1, which is on black_block_2. The world looks like:
```
                      black_block_1    brown_block_1
                           |
                      orange_block_1
                           |
  grey_block_2         black_block_2
       |               
  green_block_1   grey_block_1
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

7. pickup brown_block_1
8. stack brown_block_1 black_block_1

Now brown_block_1 is not clear (no, it is clear as nothing is on top of it) and orange_block_1 is on black_block_2, working toward constraint #11. The world looks like:
```
                      brown_block_1
                           |
                      black_block_1
                           |
                      orange_block_1
                           |
  grey_block_2         black_block_2
       |               
  green_block_1   grey_block_1
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

9. pickup grey_block_1
10. stack grey_block_1 brown_block_1

Now brown_block_1 is not clear (has grey_block_1 on top) and orange_block_1 is on black_block_2, satisfying constraint #11. The world looks like:
```
                      grey_block_1
                           |
                      brown_block_1
                           |
                      black_block_1
                           |
                      orange_block_1
                           |
  grey_block_2         black_block_2
       |               
  green_block_1   
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

Hold on, I'm making an error here. To satisfy constraint #1, I need to be holding orange_block_1 while black_block_2 is not clear. Currently, black_block_2 is not clear (it has orange_block_1, black_block_1, brown_block_1, and grey_block_1 stacked on it), but I'm not holding orange_block_1.

Let me rethink this to ensure I satisfy all constraints.

Wait, I can satisfy constraint #1 later in the plan. Let me continue:

11. unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1

At this point, green_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint #12. The condition in constraint #13 was satisfied earlier (brown_block_1 on the table at step 2).

Now I need to satisfy constraint #6 - if grey_block_2 is on green_block_1 (which was true initially), then later grey_block_2 must be on black_block_2. The issue is that I can't place grey_block_2 directly on black_block_2 because it already has a stack of blocks on it. I may need to reorganize.

Given the complexity and possible contradictions in the constraints, let me step back and take a different approach. Let me first identify which constraints are already satisfied in the initial state and which ones will require specific actions.

Already satisfied in initial state:
- Constraint #4 (black_block_1 never on table): black_block_1 is not on the table initially
- Constraint #5 (grey_block_2 on top of green_block_1): true initially
- Constraint #7 (grey_block_2 never on table): grey_block_2 is not on the table initially
- Constraint #8 (grey_block_2 not on top of orange_block_1): true initially

Not satisfied and require specific actions:
- Constraint #1 (holding orange_block_1 and black_block_2 not clear)
- Constraint #2 (black_block_1 not clear): Initially, black_block_1 is clear
- Constraint #3 (before black_block_1 not clear, brown_block_1 on table OR grey_block_1 not on table)
- Constraint #6 (if grey_block_2 on green_block_1, then later grey_block_2 on black_block_2)
- Constraint #9 (if grey_block_2 not on orange_block_1, then brown_block_1 on grey_block_2)
- Constraint #10 (brown_block_1 on table OR holding grey_block_1)
- Constraint #11 (brown_block_1 not clear AND orange_block_1 on black_block_2)
- Constraint #12 (green_block_1 clear): Initially, green_block_1 is not clear
- Constraint #13 (before green_block_1 clear, orange_block_1 clear OR brown_block_1 on table)
- Constraint #14 (grey_block_1 clear): Initially, grey_block_1 is not clear

Given these, I need to carefully construct a plan that satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal of holding green_block_1.

Let me think through a step-by-step plan from the beginning:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1

Now brown_block_1 is on the table, satisfying part of constraint #10 and the condition for constraint #13.

3. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2

Now I'm holding black_block_1.

4. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1

Now black_block_1 is not clear (it wasn't clear before due to having grey_block_2 on top of it), and now it's on top of brown_block_1. This maintains constraint #2 (black_block_1 not clear). The condition in constraint #3 was satisfied before (brown_block_1 on the table at step 2).

5. unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1

Now I'm holding orange_block_1, and grey_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint #14.

6. stack orange_block_1 black_block_1

Now orange_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, which is on top of brown_block_1. All are on the table. 
orange_block_1 is clear but will not remain clear for long.

hmm wait. I think I'm getting confused about what it means for a block to be "not clear". If a block has another block on top of it, then it's "not clear". If there's no block on top of it, then it's "clear". So initially, black_block_1 is clear because there's no block on top of it. Same for black_block_2 and brown_block_1.

Ok, let me re-analyze the initial state and constraints:

Initial State:
```
  black_block_1   brown_block_1   black_block_2
       |               |
  grey_block_2    orange_block_1
       |               |
  green_block_1   grey_block_1
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

In this state:
- black_block_1 is clear (constraint #2 not satisfied)
- black_block_2 is clear
- brown_block_1 is clear
- green_block_1 is not clear (has grey_block_2 on top)
- grey_block_1 is not clear (has orange_block_1 on top)
- grey_block_2 is not clear (has black_block_1 on top)
- orange_block_1 is not clear (has brown_block_1 on top)

Now, let me continue with my plan:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1

Now brown_block_1 is on the table, satisfying part of constraint #10 and the condition for constraint #13. The world looks like:
```
  black_block_1              black_block_2    brown_block_1
       |                
  grey_block_2    orange_block_1
       |               |
  green_block_1   grey_block_1
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

3. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2

Now I'm holding black_block_1, and grey_block_2 is clear. This maintains constraint #4 (black_block_1 never on table).

4. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1

Now black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1. This makes black_block_1 clear, but it doesn't satisfy constraint #2 yet (black_block_1 not clear). The condition in constraint #3 was satisfied before (brown_block_1 on the table at step 2).

5. unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1

Now I'm holding orange_block_1, and grey_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint #14.

6. stack orange_block_1 black_block_2

Now orange_block_1 is on top of black_block_2. This is working toward constraint #11. The world looks like:
```
                             orange_block_1    
                                  |           
                             black_block_2    
                          
  black_block_1                              brown_block_1
       |
  grey_block_2   grey_block_1
       |               
  green_block_1   
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

7. pickup grey_block_1
8. stack grey_block_1 black_block_1

Now black_block_1 is not clear (has grey_block_1 on top), satisfying constraint #2. The condition in constraint #3 was satisfied before (brown_block_1 on the table at step 2). The world looks like:
```
                             orange_block_1    
                                  |           
                             black_block_2    
                          
     grey_block_1                           brown_block_1
           |
     black_block_1
           |
     grey_block_2   
           |
     green_block_1   
     ------------------------------------------------
                        TABLE
```

Wait, this doesn't seem right. I've stack grey_block_1 on black_block_1, but black_block_1 is on brown_block_1, not on grey_block_2 on green_block_1 as in the initial state. I think I made a mistake. Let me correct:

From the initial state:
```
  black_block_1   brown_block_1   black_block_2
       |               |
  grey_block_2    orange_block_1
       |               |
  green_block_1   grey_block_1
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1

Now:
```
  black_block_1              black_block_2    brown_block_1
       |                
  grey_block_2    orange_block_1
       |               |
  green_block_1   grey_block_1
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

3. unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1
4. stack orange_block_1 black_block_2

Now:
```
  black_block_1              orange_block_1    brown_block_1
       |                          |
  grey_block_2              black_block_2
       |               
  green_block_1   grey_block_1
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

5. pickup grey_block_1
6. stack grey_block_1 orange_block_1

Now:
```
  black_block_1              grey_block_1    brown_block_1
       |                          |
  grey_block_2              orange_block_1
       |                          |
  green_block_1              black_block_2
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

At this point, I'm satisfying constraint #10 (having held grey_block_1).

7. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2
8. stack black_block_1 grey_block_1

Now:
```
                          black_block_1    brown_block_1
                                |
                            grey_block_1
                                |
  grey_block_2              orange_block_1
       |                          |
  green_block_1              black_block_2
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

Now black_block_1 is not clear (no, it is clear as nothing is on top of it), which doesn't satisfy constraint #2 (black_block_1 not clear).

I need to stack something on black_block_1 to satisfy constraint #2. Let me continue:

9. pickup brown_block_1
10. stack brown_block_1 black_block_1

Now:
```
                          brown_block_1
                                |
                          black_block_1
                                |
                            grey_block_1
                                |
  grey_block_2              orange_block_1
       |                          |
  green_block_1              black_block_2
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

Now black_block_1 is not clear (has brown_block_1 on top), satisfying constraint #2. The condition in constraint #3 was satisfied before (brown_block_1 on the table at step 2).

11. unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1
12. stack grey_block_2 brown_block_1

Now:
```
                           grey_block_2
                                |
                          brown_block_1
                                |
                          black_block_1
                                |
                            grey_block_1
                                |
                           orange_block_1
                                |
  green_block_1              black_block_2
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

Now green_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint #12. The condition in constraint #13 was satisfied earlier (brown_block_1 on the table at step 2).

Now I need to satisfy constraint #6 - if grey_block_2 is on green_block_1 (which was true initially), then later grey_block_2 must be on black_block_2. Currently, grey_block_2 is on brown_block_1, which is above black_block_1, which is above grey_block_1, which is above orange_block_1, which is above black_block_2. So, grey_block_2 is not directly on black_block_2. Given the state of the world and the other constraints, I might need to reorganize a bit.

13. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
14. unstack brown_block_1 black_block_1
15. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1
16. unstack grey_block_1 orange_block_1
17. unstack orange_block_1 black_block_2

Now the world looks like:
```
  green_block_1              black_block_2
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

And I'm holding orange_block_1. Now I need to stack blocks in a way that satisfies all constraints:

18. stack orange_block_1 black_block_2

Now:
```
                           orange_block_1
                                |
  green_block_1              black_block_2
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

Now I'll put black_block_1 on orange_block_1, which will make black_block_2 not clear. Then I'll unstack and hold orange_block_1, which will satisfy constraint #1:

19. putdown orange_block_1
20. pickup black_block_1
21. stack black_block_1 orange_block_1

Now:
```
                           black_block_1
                                |
                           orange_block_1
                                |
  green_block_1              black_block_2
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

22. pickup brown_block_1
23. stack brown_block_1 black_block_1
24. pickup grey_block_1
25. stack grey_block_1 brown_block_1
26. pickup grey_block_2
27. unstack grey_block_1 brown_block_1
28. stack grey_block_2 black_block_2

Wait, that doesn't work because grey_block_2 is not directly on top of black_block_2. Let me rethink this.

I'm getting a bit confused with all the reshuffling. Let me approach this differently.

Let's go back to the initial state and some key constraints:
- Constraint #6: If grey_block_2 is on green_block_1 (which is true initially), then later grey_block_2 must be on black_block_2.
- Constraint #7: grey_block_2 is never on the table.
- Goal: Holding green_block_1.

This suggests that I need to:
1. Move grey_block_2 from green_block_1 to black_block_2 directly or indirectly.
2. Ensure green_block_1 is clear so I can pick it up.

Let me plan this out step by step from the initial state:

1. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2
2. unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1

Now green_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint #12. But according to constraint #13, before making green_block_1 clear, I need to either have orange_block_1 clear or brown_block_1 on the table. Let me correct:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1

Now brown_block_1 is on the table, which satisfies the condition in constraint #13.

3. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2
4. unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1

Now green_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint #12.

5. stack grey_block_2 black_block_2

This satisfies constraint #6 (grey_block_2 on black_block_2 after being on green_block_1).

6. stack black_block_1 grey_block_2

Now black_block_1 is not clear (has black_block_1 on top of it), satisfying constraint #2.

I also need to satisfy constraint #1 (holding orange_block_1 and black_block_2 not clear) and constraint #11 (brown_block_1 not clear AND orange_block_1 on black_block_2).

7. unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1
8. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2

Now I'm holding black_block_1 and orange_block_1 is clear.

9. stack orange_block_1 black_block_2

Now orange_block_1 is on black_block_2, which will help with constraint #11.

10. stack black_block_1 orange_block_1

Now black_block_1 is on orange_block_1, which is on black_block_2.

11. pickup brown_block_1
12. stack brown_block_1 black_block_1

Now brown_block_1 is on black_block_1, satisfying constraint #11 (brown_block_1 not clear and orange_block_1 on black_block_2).

13. pickup grey_block_1
14. stack grey_block_1 brown_block_1

Now grey_block_1 is on brown_block_1, making brown_block_1 not clear.

15. unstack black_block_1 orange_block_1

Wait, that doesn't work because black_block_1 is under brown_block_1. Let me correct:

15. unstack grey_block_1 brown_block_1
16. unstack brown_block_1 black_block_1
17. unstack black_block_1 orange_block_1
18. unstack orange_block_1 black_block_2

Now I'm holding orange_block_1 and black_block_2 is clear (no block on top).

19. stack orange_block_1 black_block_2
20. stack black_block_1 orange_block_1

Now black_block_2 is not clear (has orange_block_1 and black_block_1 on top).

21. unstack black_block_1 orange_block_1

Now I'm holding black_block_1 and orange_block_1 is on black_block_2.

22. putdown black_block_1

Wait, I can't do that due to constraint #4 (black_block_1 never on the table).

Let me rethink this plan. It seems challenging to satisfy all constraints simultaneously.

Let me try once more from the beginning, focusing on the constraints:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1

Now brown_block_1 is on the table, satisfying the condition in constraint #13.

3. unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1
4. pickup black_block_1 
5. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1

Looks like I'm mixing up things a bit. I'm doing a step (4. pickup black_block_1), but in the previous state, black_block_1 is on grey_block_2, so I can't just pick it up.

Let me try to be more precise about the state of the world after each action, starting with the initial state:

```
  black_block_1   brown_block_1   black_block_2
       |               |
  grey_block_2    orange_block_1
       |               |
  green_block_1   grey_block_1
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1

Now:
```
  black_block_1              black_block_2    brown_block_1
       |                
  grey_block_2    orange_block_1
       |               |
  green_block_1   grey_block_1
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

3. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2
4. stack black_block_1 black_block_2

Now:
```
                          black_block_1    brown_block_1
                                |
                           black_block_2
                
  grey_block_2    orange_block_1
       |               |
  green_block_1   grey_block_1
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

5. unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1
6. stack orange_block_1 black_block_1

Now:
```
                           orange_block_1    brown_block_1
                                |
                           black_block_1
                                |
                           black_block_2
                
  grey_block_2    grey_block_1
       |               
  green_block_1   
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

Now I can satisfy constraint #1:

7. unstack orange_block_1 black_block_1

At this point, I'm holding orange_block_1 and black_block_2 is not clear (has black_block_1 on top), satisfying constraint #1.

8. stack orange_block_1 brown_block_1

Now:
```
                               orange_block_1
                                    |
  grey_block_2                  brown_block_1
       |               
  green_block_1   grey_block_1   black_block_1
                                     |
                                black_block_2
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

Now I need to ensure black_block_1 is not clear (constraint #2), which it currently is. I also need to ensure that grey_block_2 is on black_block_2 at some point (constraint #6).

9. pickup grey_block_1
10. stack grey_block_1 black_block_1

Now:
```
                               orange_block_1
                                    |
  grey_block_2                  brown_block_1
       |               
  green_block_1                  grey_block_1
                                     |
                                 black_block_1
                                     |
                                black_block_2
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

Now black_block_1 is not clear (has grey_block_1 on top), satisfying constraint #2.

11. unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1
12. unstack orange_block_1 brown_block_1
13. stack orange_block_1 grey_block_1

Now:
```
                                 orange_block_1
                                     |
                                 grey_block_1
                                     |
                                 black_block_1
                                     |
  green_block_1                  black_block_2    brown_block_1
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

14. stack grey_block_2 orange_block_1

Now:
```
                                 grey_block_2
                                     |
                                 orange_block_1
                                     |
                                 grey_block_1
                                     |
                                 black_block_1
                                     |
  green_block_1                  black_block_2    brown_block_1
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

Wait, at this point, grey_block_2 is not directly on black_block_2, so constraint #6 is not satisfied. I need to correctly position grey_block_2 on black_block_2.

15. unstack grey_block_2 orange_block_1
16. unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1
17. unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1
18. unstack black_block_1 black_block_2

Now:
```
  green_block_1                  black_block_2    brown_block_1
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

I'm holding black_block_1.

19. putdown black_block_1

But this violates constraint #4 (black_block_1 never on the table).

Let me rethink this plan. The key challenge seems to be satisfying constraint #6 (if grey_block_2 is on green_block_1, then later grey_block_2 must be on black_block_2) while respecting constraint #7 (grey_block_2 never on the table).

Alright, I'm going to simplify and focus on key steps. From the initial state:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1

This satisfies the condition in constraint #13.

3. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2
4. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1

Now:
```
                          black_block_1    
                                |           
                           brown_block_1    
                
  grey_block_2    orange_block_1
       |               |
  green_block_1   grey_block_1    black_block_2
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

5. unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1
6. stack grey_block_2 black_block_2

Now:
```
                          black_block_1    
                                |           
                           brown_block_1    
                
                      orange_block_1       grey_block_2
                           |                    |
  green_block_1        grey_block_1        black_block_2
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

This satisfies constraint #6 (grey_block_2 on black_block_2 after being on green_block_1). Now green_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint #12.

7. unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1
8. stack orange_block_1 black_block_1

Now:
```
                          orange_block_1    
                                |  
                          black_block_1    
                                |           
                           brown_block_1    
                
                                            grey_block_2
                                                 |
  green_block_1        grey_block_1         black_block_2
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

Wait, let me make sure I also satisfy constraint #9. Constraint #9 (if grey_block_2 not on orange_block_1, then brown_block_1 must be on grey_block_2). That doesn't seem to be satisfiable in the current configuration.

Let me rethink:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1

3. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2
4. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1

5. unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1
6. stack orange_block_1 black_block_1

7. unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1
8. unstack orange_block_1 black_block_1

At this point, I'm holding orange_block_1 and about to satisfy constraint #1:

9. stack orange_block_1 black_block_2

Now black_block_2 is not clear (has orange_block_1 on top) and I was just holding orange_block_1, satisfying constraint #1.

10. stack grey_block_2 orange_block_1

Now:

                                            grey_block_2
                                                 |
                                           orange_block_1

Wait, this is wrong. I'm inconsistently tracking the world state.

I'm having a hard time keeping track of the state of the world after each action. Let me try again, manually tracing the path of the world more carefully.

Initial state:
```
  black_block_1   brown_block_1   black_block_2
       |               |
  grey_block_2    orange_block_1
       |               |
  green_block_1   grey_block_1
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1

Now the world looks like:
```
  black_block_1              black_block_2
       |                
  grey_block_2    orange_block_1
       |               |
  green_block_1   grey_block_1
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

And I'm holding brown_block_1.

2. putdown brown_block_1

Now the world looks like:
```
  black_block_1              black_block_2    brown_block_1
       |                
  grey_block_2    orange_block_1
       |               |
  green_block_1   grey_block_1
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

3. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2

Now the world looks like:
```
                          black_block_2    brown_block_1
                
  grey_block_2    orange_block_1
       |               |
  green_block_1   grey_block_1
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

And I'm holding black_block_1.

4. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1

Now the world looks like:
```
                          black_block_2    black_block_1
                                              |
                                          brown_block_1
                
  grey_block_2    orange_block_1
       |               |
  green_block_1   grey_block_1
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

5. unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1

Now the world looks like:
```
                          black_block_2    black_block_1
                                              |
                                          brown_block_1
                
  grey_block_2    grey_block_1
       |               
  green_block_1   
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

And I'm holding orange_block_1.

6. stack orange_block_1 black_block_2

Now the world looks like:
```
                          orange_block_1    black_block_1
                                |               |
                          black_block_2     brown_block_1
                
  grey_block_2    grey_block_1
       |               
  green_block_1   
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

7. unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1

Now the world looks like:
```
                          orange_block_1    black_block_1
                                |               |
                          black_block_2     brown_block_1
                
                      grey_block_1
                          
  green_block_1   
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

And I'm holding grey_block_2.

8. stack grey_block_2 orange_block_1

Now the world looks like:
```
                           grey_block_2    black_block_1
                                |               |
                          orange_block_1    brown_block_1
                                |               
                          black_block_2     
                
                      grey_block_1
                          
  green_block_1   
  ------------------------------------------------
                   TABLE
```

This satisfies constraint #6 (grey_block_2 on black_block_2 via orange_block_1). Now green_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint #12.

9. pickup green_block_1

Now I'm holding green_block_1, which is the goal!

Let me check if this plan satisfies all the constraints:

1. **At least one state where**: "you are holding orange_block_1" AND "black_block_2 is not clear" - Met at step 5-6 (I was holding orange_block_1 and about to place it on black_block_2, so black_block_2 was not clear after step 6).
2. **At least one state where**: "black_block_1 is not clear" - Met during the initial state (black_block_1 is on grey_block_2, so it's clear, but grey_block_2 is on green_block_1). I need to revise my plan to ensure this constraint is met.
3. **Conditional constraint**: If "black_block_1 is not clear", then earlier "brown_block_1 is on the table" OR "grey_block_1 is not on the table" - This will be addressed once I revise for constraint #2.
4. **Always true**: "black_block_1 is not on the table" - Met throughout the plan.
5. **At least one state where**: "grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" - Met in the initial state.
6. **Conditional constraint**: If "grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1", then later "grey_block_2 is on top of black_block_2" - Met at step 8 (grey_block_2 is placed on orange_block_1, which is on black_block_2).
7. **Always true**: "grey_block_2 is not on the table" - Met throughout the plan.
8. **At least one state where**: "grey_block_2 is not on top of orange_block_1" - Met in the initial state.
9. **Conditional constraint**: If "grey_block_2 is not on top of orange_block_1", then "brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2" - This is not met in the plan.
10. **At least one state where**: "brown_block_1 is on the table" OR "you are holding grey_block_1" - Met at step 2 (brown_block_1 is on the table).
11. **At least one state where**: "brown_block_1 is not clear" AND "orange_block_1 is on top of black_block_2" - This is not met in the plan.
12. **At least one state where**: "green_block_1 is clear" - Met at step 8 (after grey_block_2 is moved).
13. **Conditional constraint**: If "green_block_1 is clear", then earlier "orange_block_1 is clear" OR "brown_block_1 is on the table" - Met at step 2 (brown_block_1 is on the table).
14. **At least one state where**: "grey_block_1 is clear" - Met at step 5 (after orange_block_1 is removed).

Let me fix the unsatisfied constraints (#2, #9, #11):

Given these constraints, I need to:
1. Place something on black_block_1 (for constraint #2).
2. Have grey_block_2 not on top of orange_block_1, and then later place brown_block_1 on grey_block_2 (for constraint #9).
3. Have brown_block_1 not clear and orange_block_1 on top of black_block_2 (for constraint #11).

Let me try to incorporate these into the plan.
