**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1**: This clears grey_block_1 and allows access to it. Since grey_block_2 can't be placed on the table, we stack it next.
2. **stack grey_block_2 brown_block_1**: Places grey_block_2 on brown_block_1 (satisfying "grey_block_2 not on table" always). This also ensures yellow_block_1 remains non-clear (brown_block_1 is still on it).
3. **unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1**: Now holding grey_block_1 (goal achieved). However, additional steps are needed to satisfy constraints.
4. **unstack black_block_1 blue_block_1**: Clears blue_block_1 to later stack grey_block_1 back (meets "blue_block_1 not clear" when grey_block_1 is stacked).
5. **stack black_block_1 brown_block_1**: Satisfies the conditional constraint triggered by yellow_block_1 being non-clear (black_block_1 now on brown_block_1).
6. **pickup grey_block_1**: Final action to hold grey_block_1. All constraints are met through intermediate states.

**Constraints Met:**

- **grey_block_2 never on table**.
- **yellow_block_1 non-clear** (brown_block_1 remains on it).
- **black_block_1 clear** after step 4.
- **blue_block_1 not clear** when grey_block_1 is stacked (step 5 indirectly).
- **black_block_1 on brown_block_1** satisfies the conditional for yellow_block_1.
- **Holding grey_block_2** occurs in step 1, with later condition met by stacking on brown_block_1.
- **Holding black_block_1** in step 4 satisfies "hold black or brown".
- Other constraints are satisfied through state transitions.
