Let's analyze this problem step by step.

First, I'll understand the initial state:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2, brown_block_1, and red_block_1 are clear
- The arm is not holding any block

Visualizing this, we have:
```
  grey_block_2         brown_block_1     red_block_1
       |                    |                |
  grey_block_1         yellow_block_1     (table)
       |
  black_block_1
       |
  blue_block_1
       |
    (table)
```

The goal is simply: "you are holding grey_block_1".

To achieve this goal, we need to:
1. Remove grey_block_2 from the top of grey_block_1
2. Pick up grey_block_1 from black_block_1

However, there are numerous constraints that need to be satisfied along the way. Let me go through them one by one:

1. "grey_block_2 is not on the table" must hold in every state. This means we can never put grey_block_2 on the table.

2. "There is a block on top of yellow_block_1" must hold in at least one state. Currently, brown_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, so this constraint is already satisfied.

3. If "There is a block on top of yellow_block_1" holds in some state s, then "black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1" OR "you are holding black_block_1" must hold at s or some state after s. Since brown_block_1 is already on top of yellow_block_1, we'll need to ensure that at some point, black_block_1 is either on top of brown_block_1 or being held.

4. "There is no block on top of black_block_1" must hold in at least one state. Currently, grey_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, so we'll need to remove it at some point.

5. If "There is no block on top of black_block_1" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which "yellow_block_1 is not on the table" OR "blue_block_1 is clear" is true. This means before we make black_block_1 clear, we need to either move yellow_block_1 or clear blue_block_1.

6. "There is a block on top of blue_block_1" must hold in at least one state. Currently, black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1, so this constraint is already satisfied.

7. If "There is a block on top of blue_block_1" holds in some state s, then "grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1" must hold at s or some state after s. This means we need to put grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_1 at some point.

8. "blue_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1" must hold in at least one state. Currently, blue_block_1 is on the table, not on top of brown_block_1, so this constraint is already satisfied.

9. If "blue_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1" holds in some state s, then "black_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1" OR "red_block_1 is not clear" must hold at s or some state after s. Since blue_block_1 is indeed not on top of brown_block_1, we need to ensure that either black_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1 or red_block_1 has something on top of it.

10. "yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" OR "red_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in at least one state. We'll need to ensure one of these conditions is met at some point.

11. "There is a block on top of grey_block_1" must hold in at least one state. Currently, grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1, so this constraint is already satisfied.

12. If "There is a block on top of grey_block_1" holds in some state s, then "you are holding red_block_1" OR "red_block_1 is not on the table" must hold at s or some state after s. Since grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1, we need to ensure that at some point, either the arm is holding red_block_1 or red_block_1 is not on the table.

13. "You are holding brown_block_1" AND "blue_block_1 is on top of red_block_1" must hold in at least one state. We'll need to configure the blocks in this manner at some point.

14. "You are holding black_block_1" OR "you are holding brown_block_1" must hold in at least one state. We'll need to pick up one of these blocks at some point.

15. "You are holding grey_block_2" must hold in at least one state. We'll need to pick up grey_block_2 at some point.

16. If "you are holding grey_block_2" holds in some state s, then "grey_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1" OR "you are holding red_block_1" must hold at s or some state after s. After we pick up grey_block_2, we need to ensure that at some point, either grey_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 or the arm is holding red_block_1.

Now, let's sketch a plan to satisfy all these constraints:

First, we need to pick up grey_block_2 from grey_block_1, as it's blocking us from accessing grey_block_1, which is our ultimate goal.

```
unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
```

This satisfies constraint 15, as we are holding grey_block_2. But, according to constraint 16, we need to ensure that after we pick up grey_block_2, at some point either "grey_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1" or "you are holding red_block_1". Let's plan for the latter for now.

We can't put grey_block_2 on the table due to constraint 1. So, we need to stack it on some clear block. Currently, the clear blocks are brown_block_1 and red_block_1.

```
stack grey_block_2 red_block_1
```

Next, we need to unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1:

```
unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1
```

According to constraint 7, if there's a block on top of blue_block_1 (which is the case), we need to ensure that at some point, grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1. Let's plan for that.

Before we place grey_block_1 on blue_block_1, we need to ensure constraints 13 and 14 are met. Constraint 14 requires us to hold either black_block_1 or brown_block_1 at some point, and constraint 13 requires us to hold brown_block_1 while blue_block_1 is on top of red_block_1.

Let's place grey_block_1 somewhere temporarily. We can't put it on the table (as it's not the final position), and the clear blocks are brown_block_1 and grey_block_2. Let's try brown_block_1:

```
stack grey_block_1 brown_block_1
```

This satisfies constraint 16 (since we were holding grey_block_2 and now grey_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1). It also satisfies constraint 3 (since there is a block on top of yellow_block_1 and now grey_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1, which is itself on top of yellow_block_1).

Next, we can unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1:

```
unstack black_block_1 blue_block_1
```

This satisfies constraint 4 (black_block_1 is clear) and constraint 14 (we are holding black_block_1). However, according to constraint 5, before we make black_block_1 clear, we need to ensure that at some point, either yellow_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_1 is clear. We just made blue_block_1 clear, so this constraint is satisfied.

Let's stack black_block_1 on grey_block_2:

```
stack black_block_1 grey_block_2
```

Now, to satisfy constraint 13, we need to have brown_block_1 in our hand and blue_block_1 on top of red_block_1. Let's unstack grey_block_1 from brown_block_1:

```
unstack grey_block_1 brown_block_1
```

We now have grey_block_1 in our hand. Before we proceed, let's check if we've satisfied all the constraints:

- Constraint 1: grey_block_2 has never been on the table.
- Constraint 2: brown_block_1 was on top of yellow_block_1, so a block has been on top of yellow_block_1.
- Constraint 3: A block was on top of yellow_block_1, and we've held black_block_1.
- Constraint 4: black_block_1 is now clear.
- Constraint 5: Before black_block_1 became clear, blue_block_1 was also clear.
- Constraint 6: black_block_1 was on top of blue_block_1, so a block has been on top of blue_block_1.
- Constraint 7: We haven't placed grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_1 yet, so this constraint isn't satisfied.
- Constraint 8: blue_block_1 has never been on top of brown_block_1.
- Constraint 9: Since blue_block_1 isn't on top of brown_block_1, either black_block_1 isn't on top of blue_block_1 or red_block_1 isn't clear. Currently, black_block_1 isn't on top of blue_block_1, so this constraint is satisfied.
- Constraint 10: We haven't placed yellow_block_1 on top of black_block_1 or moved red_block_1 off the table, so this constraint isn't satisfied.
- Constraint 11: grey_block_2 was on top of grey_block_1, so a block has been on top of grey_block_1.
- Constraint 12: Since there was a block on top of grey_block_1, we need to ensure that at some point, either we're holding red_block_1 or red_block_1 isn't on the table. We haven't done this yet.
- Constraint 13: We haven't met the condition of holding brown_block_1 while blue_block_1 is on top of red_block_1.
- Constraint 14: We've held black_block_1, so this constraint is satisfied.
- Constraint 15: We've held grey_block_2, so this constraint is satisfied.
- Constraint 16: After holding grey_block_2, we've had grey_block_1 on top of brown_block_1, so this constraint is satisfied.

We still need to satisfy constraints 7, 10, 12, and 13.

Let's continue our plan:

Let's place grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_1 to satisfy constraint 7:

```
stack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
```

Now, we need to pick up brown_block_1 from yellow_block_1:

```
unstack brown_block_1 yellow_block_1
```

This makes us hold brown_block_1, partially satisfying constraint 13. To fully satisfy it, we need to move blue_block_1 on top of red_block_1.

But there's a problem: blue_block_1 currently has grey_block_1 on top of it, and we can't move it. We need to revise our plan.

Actually, let's try a different approach. If we pick up red_block_1 and move it off the table, we'll satisfy constraint 12. And if we place red_block_1 under blue_block_1, we can then pick up brown_block_1 and satisfy constraint 13.

So, let's backtrack a bit. After unstacking grey_block_1 from black_block_1, instead of stacking grey_block_1 on brown_block_1, let's try placing it on red_block_1:

```
unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
stack grey_block_2 red_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1
```

Now, I have grey_block_1 in our hand. Let's place it temporarily:

```
stack grey_block_1 brown_block_1
```

Next, we'll unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1:

```
unstack black_block_1 blue_block_1
```

Let's stack black_block_1 on grey_block_2:

```
stack black_block_1 grey_block_2
```

Now, we need to pick up brown_block_1, but grey_block_1 is on top of it. Let's unstack grey_block_1:

```
unstack grey_block_1 brown_block_1
```

But we need a place to put grey_block_1. I'm considering putting it on blue_block_1 to satisfy constraint 7:

```
stack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
```

Next, we need to pick up red_block_1, but grey_block_2 and black_block_1 are on top of it. Let's remove them:

```
unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2
stack black_block_1 yellow_block_1
unstack grey_block_2 red_block_1
```

We can stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1:

```
stack grey_block_2 black_block_1
```

Now, we can pick up red_block_1:

```
pickup red_block_1
```

This satisfies constraint 12 (since there was a block on top of grey_block_1 and now we're holding red_block_1). It also partially satisfies constraint 10 (red_block_1 is not on the table). Let's place red_block_1 somewhere:

```
putdown red_block_1
```

Now, red_block_1 is back on the table, which isn't ideal. Let's adjust our plan.

I'm realizing that the constraints are quite intricate and ensuring they're all satisfied is complex. Let me approach this differently.

Let's start by unstacking grey_block_2 from grey_block_1:

```
unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
```

This satisfies constraint 15 (we're holding grey_block_2). We can't put grey_block_2 on the table due to constraint 1. Let's place it on red_block_1:

```
stack grey_block_2 red_block_1
```

Now, let's unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1:

```
unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1
```

At this point, we need to ensure we satisfy constraint 7 (if there's a block on top of blue_block_1, then grey_block_1 should be on top of blue_block_1 at some point). Let's stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_1:

```
stack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
```

This ensures we satisfy constraint 7.

Now, black_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint 4. We also need to satisfy constraint 5, which states that before black_block_1 is clear, either yellow_block_1 should not be on the table or blue_block_1 should be clear. In our case, blue_block_1 is now clear (before black_block_1 became clear), so this constraint is satisfied.

Let's pick up black_block_1:

```
pickup black_block_1
```

This satisfies constraint 14 (we're holding black_block_1). Now, to satisfy constraint 10, we need to place yellow_block_1 on top of black_block_1 or move red_block_1 off the table. Let's do the latter.

But first, let's place black_block_1 on brown_block_1:

```
stack black_block_1 brown_block_1
```

This also partially satisfies constraint 3 (black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1).

Now, to manage red_block_1, we need to remove grey_block_2 from it. Let's pick up grey_block_2:

```
unstack grey_block_2 red_block_1
```

I'll stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1:

```
stack grey_block_2 black_block_1
```

Now, we can pick up red_block_1:

```
pickup red_block_1
```

This satisfies constraint 12 (we're holding red_block_1).

Let's place red_block_1 underneath blue_block_1 to prepare for constraint 13:

```
stack red_block_1 blue_block_1
```

Oops, this is wrong. Blue_block_1 already has grey_block_1 on top of it, so we can't stack red_block_1 on top of it. Let's adjust:

```
putdown red_block_1
```

This places red_block_1 on the table. But constraint 10 required red_block_1 to be off the table, which it was briefly when we were holding it. So, constraint 10 is satisfied.

Let's continue planning:

Now, to satisfy constraint 13, we need to hold brown_block_1 while blue_block_1 is on top of red_block_1. But brown_block_1 has black_block_1 and grey_block_2 on top of it. Let's remove them:

```
unstack grey_block_2 black_block_1
stack grey_block_2 red_block_1
unstack black_block_1 brown_block_1
stack black_block_1 grey_block_2
```

Now, we can unstack brown_block_1 from yellow_block_1:

```
unstack brown_block_1 yellow_block_1
```

This gives us brown_block_1 in our hand. Next, to ensure blue_block_1 is on top of red_block_1, we need to move grey_block_1 from blue_block_1:

```
unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
```

Now, we're holding grey_block_1. At this point, our goal is to hold grey_block_1, and that's satisfied. But we still need to ensure all other constraints are met.

To ensure constraint 13 is met, we need to place grey_block_1 somewhere temporarily (not on brown_block_1 or blue_block_1), pick up blue_block_1, place it on red_block_1, and then pick up brown_block_1 again.

But here's a caveat: constraint 7 states that if there's a block on blue_block_1, then grey_block_1 should be on blue_block_1 at some point. Since black_block_1 was on blue_block_1, and we've already placed grey_block_1 on blue_block_1, constraint 7 is satisfied.

So, let's revise our final actions:

```
putdown grey_block_1
pickup blue_block_1
stack blue_block_1 red_block_1
pickup brown_block_1
```

This ensures we satisfy constraint 13 (holding brown_block_1 while blue_block_1 is on top of red_block_1).

Finally, we need to pick up grey_block_1 again to satisfy our goal:

```
putdown brown_block_1
pickup grey_block_1
```

Now, let's ensure all constraints are satisfied:

1. grey_block_2 has never been on the table. ✓
2. There has been a block on top of yellow_block_1 (brown_block_1). ✓
3. When there was a block on top of yellow_block_1, either black_block_1 was on top of brown_block_1 or we were holding black_block_1. (Partially satisfied, as black_block_1 was on top of brown_block_1 at some point). ✓
4. There has been a state where black_block_1 is clear. ✓
5. Before black_block_1 became clear, blue_block_1 was clear. ✓
6. There has been a block on top of blue_block_1 (black_block_1, and later grey_block_1). ✓
7. Since there was a block on top of blue_block_1, grey_block_1 was on top of blue_block_1 at some point. ✓
8. blue_block_1 has not been on top of brown_block_1. ✓
9. Since blue_block_1 isn't on top of brown_block_1, either black_block_1 isn't on top of blue_block_1 or red_block_1 isn't clear. Currently, black_block_1 isn't on top of blue_block_1. ✓
10. yellow_block_1 has not been on top of black_block_1, but red_block_1 has been off the table when we were holding it. ✓
11. There has been a block on top of grey_block_1 (grey_block_2). ✓
12. Since there was a block on top of grey_block_1, we've held red_block_1. ✓
13. We've held brown_block_1 while blue_block_1 was on top of red_block_1. ✓
14. We've held black_block_1 and brown_block_1. ✓
15. We've held grey_block_2. ✓
16. After holding grey_block_2, grey_block_1 was on top of brown_block_1. ✓

It seems all constraints are satisfied. Let's summarize the plan:

```
unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
stack grey_block_2 red_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1
stack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
pickup black_block_1
stack black_block_1 brown_block_1
unstack grey_block_2 red_block_1
stack grey_block_2 black_block_1
pickup red_block_1
putdown red_block_1
unstack grey_block_2 black_block_1
stack grey_block_2 red_block_1
unstack black_block_1 brown_block_1
stack black_block_1 grey_block_2
unstack brown_block_1 yellow_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
pickup blue_block_1
stack blue_block_1 red_block_1
pickup brown_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
pickup grey_block_1
```

Let me check to ensure that the plan is valid based on the state transitions.

Initial state:
```
  grey_block_2         brown_block_1     red_block_1
       |                    |                |
  grey_block_1         yellow_block_1     (table)
       |
  black_block_1
       |
  blue_block_1
       |
    (table)
```

After `unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1`, I'm holding grey_block_2 and the rest of the state is:
```
                      brown_block_1     red_block_1
                           |                |
  grey_block_1         yellow_block_1     (table)
       |
  black_block_1
       |
  blue_block_1
       |
    (table)
```

After `stack grey_block_2 red_block_1`, I'm not holding any block and the state is:
```
                      brown_block_1     grey_block_2
                           |                |
  grey_block_1         yellow_block_1     red_block_1
       |                                      |
  black_block_1                            (table)
       |
  blue_block_1
       |
    (table)
```

After `unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1`, I'm holding grey_block_1 and the state is:
```
                      brown_block_1     grey_block_2
                           |                |
                      yellow_block_1     red_block_1
                           |                |
  black_block_1                          (table)
       |
  blue_block_1
       |
    (table)
```

After `stack grey_block_1 blue_block_1`, I'm not holding any block and the state is:
```
                      brown_block_1     grey_block_2
                           |                |
                      yellow_block_1     red_block_1
                           |                |
  black_block_1                          (table)
       |
  blue_block_1
       |
  grey_block_1
       |
    (table)
```

Wait, grey_block_1 can't be under blue_block_1. It should be:

```
                      brown_block_1     grey_block_2
                           |                |
                      yellow_block_1     red_block_1
                           |                |
  black_block_1                          (table)
       |
  blue_block_1
       |
    (table)

  grey_block_1
       |
    (table)
```

But this can't be right. Let me re-examine the action `stack grey_block_1 blue_block_1`. If I'm holding grey_block_1 and stack it on blue_block_1, the result should be:

```
                      brown_block_1     grey_block_2
                           |                |
                      yellow_block_1     red_block_1
                           |                |
  black_block_1                          (table)
       |
  blue_block_1
       |
    (table)

  grey_block_1
       |
  blue_block_1
```

But that means blue_block_1 is in two places, which is impossible. My representation is getting confusing. Let me restart with a clearer representation.

Stack visualization:
1. grey_block_2 on grey_block_1 on black_block_1 on blue_block_1 on the table
2. brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table
3. red_block_1 on the table

Arm: empty

After `unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1`:
1. grey_block_1 on black_block_1 on blue_block_1 on the table
2. brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table
3. red_block_1 on the table

Arm: grey_block_2

After `stack grey_block_2 red_block_1`:
1. grey_block_1 on black_block_1 on blue_block_1 on the table
2. brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table
3. grey_block_2 on red_block_1 on the table

Arm: empty

After `unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1`:
1. black_block_1 on blue_block_1 on the table
2. brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table
3. grey_block_2 on red_block_1 on the table

Arm: grey_block_1

After `stack grey_block_1 blue_block_1`:
Wait, blue_block_1 has black_block_1 on top of it. I can't stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_1 because blue_block_1 is not clear.

Let me re-adjust my plan. After I unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1, I can't immediately stack it on blue_block_1. I need to find a different place for grey_block_1 temporarily.

Stacks:
1. grey_block_1 on black_block_1 on blue_block_1 on the table
2. brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table
3. grey_block_2 on red_block_1 on the table

Arm: empty

After `unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1`:
1. black_block_1 on blue_block_1 on the table
2. brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table
3. grey_block_2 on red_block_1 on the table

Arm: grey_block_1

I can stack grey_block_1 on brown_block_1:

```
stack grey_block_1 brown_block_1
```

Stacks:
1. black_block_1 on blue_block_1 on the table
2. grey_block_1 on brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table
3. grey_block_2 on red_block_1 on the table

Arm: empty

Now, I need to ensure black_block_1 is clear, which it is. Next, I can unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1:

```
unstack black_block_1 blue_block_1
```

Stacks:
1. blue_block_1 on the table
2. grey_block_1 on brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table
3. grey_block_2 on red_block_1 on the table

Arm: black_block_1

I can stack black_block_1 on grey_block_1:

```
stack black_block_1 grey_block_1
```

Stacks:
1. blue_block_1 on the table
2. black_block_1 on grey_block_1 on brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table
3. grey_block_2 on red_block_1 on the table

Arm: empty

Now, I need to ensure I place grey_block_1 on blue_block_1 at some point to satisfy constraint 7. But to do that, I need to unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_1 first.

```
unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1
```

Stacks:
1. blue_block_1 on the table
2. grey_block_1 on brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table
3. grey_block_2 on red_block_1 on the table

Arm: black_block_1

I'll stack black_block_1 on grey_block_2:

```
stack black_block_1 grey_block_2
```

Stacks:
1. blue_block_1 on the table
2. grey_block_1 on brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table
3. black_block_1 on grey_block_2 on red_block_1 on the table

Arm: empty

Next, I'll unstack grey_block_1 from brown_block_1:

```
unstack grey_block_1 brown_block_1
```

Stacks:
1. blue_block_1 on the table
2. brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table
3. black_block_1 on grey_block_2 on red_block_1 on the table

Arm: grey_block_1

Now, I can stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_1 to satisfy constraint 7:

```
stack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
```

Stacks:
1. grey_block_1 on blue_block_1 on the table
2. brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table
3. black_block_1 on grey_block_2 on red_block_1 on the table

Arm: empty

I need to hold red_block_1 at some point to satisfy constraint 12. But red_block_1 has grey_block_2 and black_block_1 on top of it. Let me unstack them first:

```
unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2
```

Stacks:
1. grey_block_1 on blue_block_1 on the table
2. brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table
3. grey_block_2 on red_block_1 on the table

Arm: black_block_1

I'll stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1 to satisfy constraint 3:

```
stack black_block_1 brown_block_1
```

Stacks:
1. grey_block_1 on blue_block_1 on the table
2. black_block_1 on brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table
3. grey_block_2 on red_block_1 on the table

Arm: empty

Next, I'll unstack grey_block_2 from red_block_1:

```
unstack grey_block_2 red_block_1
```

Stacks:
1. grey_block_1 on blue_block_1 on the table
2. black_block_1 on brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table
3. red_block_1 on the table

Arm: grey_block_2

I'll stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1:

```
stack grey_block_2 black_block_1
```

Stacks:
1. grey_block_1 on blue_block_1 on the table
2. grey_block_2 on black_block_1 on brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table
3. red_block_1 on the table

Arm: empty

Now, I can pick up red_block_1 to satisfy constraint 12:

```
pickup red_block_1
```

Stacks:
1. grey_block_1 on blue_block_1 on the table
2. grey_block_2 on black_block_1 on brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table

Arm: red_block_1

I'll put red_block_1 back on the table temporarily:

```
putdown red_block_1
```

Stacks:
1. grey_block_1 on blue_block_1 on the table
2. grey_block_2 on black_block_1 on brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table
3. red_block_1 on the table

Arm: empty

To satisfy constraint 13, I need to have blue_block_1 on top of red_block_1 and hold brown_block_1 simultaneously. But to place blue_block_1 on red_block_1, I need to remove grey_block_1 from it:

```
unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
```

Stacks:
1. blue_block_1 on the table
2. grey_block_2 on black_block_1 on brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table
3. red_block_1 on the table

Arm: grey_block_1

I'll put grey_block_1 on the table temporarily:

```
putdown grey_block_1
```

Stacks:
1. blue_block_1 on the table
2. grey_block_2 on black_block_1 on brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table
3. red_block_1 on the table
4. grey_block_1 on the table

Arm: empty

Next, I'll pick up blue_block_1:

```
pickup blue_block_1
```

Stacks:
1. grey_block_2 on black_block_1 on brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table
2. red_block_1 on the table
3. grey_block_1 on the table

Arm: blue_block_1

I'll stack blue_block_1 on red_block_1:

```
stack blue_block_1 red_block_1
```

Stacks:
1. grey_block_2 on black_block_1 on brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table
2. blue_block_1 on red_block_1 on the table
3. grey_block_1 on the table

Arm: empty

Now, I need to pick up brown_block_1 to satisfy constraint 13. But I have several blocks on top of it. I need to remove them first:

```
unstack grey_block_2 black_block_1
```

Stacks:
1. black_block_1 on brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table
2. blue_block_1 on red_block_1 on the table
3. grey_block_1 on the table

Arm: grey_block_2

I'll stack grey_block_2 on blue_block_1:

```
stack grey_block_2 blue_block_1
```

Stacks:
1. black_block_1 on brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table
2. grey_block_2 on blue_block_1 on red_block_1 on the table
3. grey_block_1 on the table

Arm: empty

Next, I'll unstack black_block_1 from brown_block_1:

```
unstack black_block_1 brown_block_1
```

Stacks:
1. brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table
2. grey_block_2 on blue_block_1 on red_block_1 on the table
3. grey_block_1 on the table

Arm: black_block_1

I'll stack black_block_1 on grey_block_1:

```
stack black_block_1 grey_block_1
```

Stacks:
1. brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table
2. grey_block_2 on blue_block_1 on red_block_1 on the table
3. black_block_1 on grey_block_1 on the table

Arm: empty

Now, I can pick up brown_block_1 to satisfy constraint 13:

```
unstack brown_block_1 yellow_block_1
```

Stacks:
1. yellow_block_1 on the table
2. grey_block_2 on blue_block_1 on red_block_1 on the table
3. black_block_1 on grey_block_1 on the table

Arm: brown_block_1

This satisfies constraint 13. I'll put brown_block_1 on the table temporarily:

```
putdown brown_block_1
```

Stacks:
1. yellow_block_1 on the table
2. grey_block_2 on blue_block_1 on red_block_1 on the table
3. black_block_1 on grey_block_1 on the table
4. brown_block_1 on the table

Arm: empty

Finally, to satisfy our goal, I need to pick up grey_block_1. But it has black_block_1 on top of it:

```
unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1
```

Stacks:
1. yellow_block_1 on the table
2. grey_block_2 on blue_block_1 on red_block_1 on the table
3. grey_block_1 on the table
4. brown_block_1 on the table

Arm: black_block_1

I'll stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1:

```
stack black_block_1 brown_block_1
```

Stacks:
1. yellow_block_1 on the table
2. grey_block_2 on blue_block_1 on red_block_1 on the table
3. grey_block_1 on the table
4. black_block_1 on brown_block_1 on the table

Arm: empty

Now, I can pick up grey_block_1 to satisfy our goal:

```
pickup grey_block_1
```

Stacks:
1. yellow_block_1 on the table
2. grey_block_2 on blue_block_1 on red_block_1 on the table
3. black_block_1 on brown_block_1 on the table

Arm: grey_block_1

And we've reached our goal state. Let's verify that all constraints are satisfied:

1. grey_block_2 has never been on the table. ✓
2. There has been a block on top of yellow_block_1 (brown_block_1). ✓
3. When there was a block on top of yellow_block_1, black_block_1 was on top of brown_block_1. ✓
4. There has been a state where black_block_1 is clear. ✓
5. Before black_block_1 became clear, blue_block_1 was clear. ✓
6. There has been a block on top of blue_block_1 (grey_block_1, and later grey_block_2). ✓
7. Since there was a block on top of blue_block_1, grey_block_1 was on top of blue_block_1 at some point. ✓
8. blue_block_1 has not been on top of brown_block_1. ✓
9. Since blue_block_1 isn't on top of brown_block_1, either black_block_1 isn't on top of blue_block_1 or red_block_1 isn't clear. (Both conditions are satisfied: black_block_1 isn't on top of blue_block_1, and red_block_1 isn't clear). ✓
10. yellow_block_1 hasn't been on top of black_block_1, but red_block_1 has been off the table at some point. ✓
11. There has been a block on top of grey_block_1 (black_block_1). ✓
12. Since there was a block on top of grey_block_1, we've held red_block_1. ✓
13. We've held brown_block_1 while blue_block_1 was on top of red_block_1. ✓
14. We've held black_block_1 and brown_block_1. ✓
15. We've held grey_block_2. ✓
16. After holding grey_block_2, we've had grey_block_1 on top of brown_block_1. ✓

All constraints are satisfied. Let's summarize the plan:

```
unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
stack grey_block_2 red_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1
stack grey_block_1 brown_block_1
unstack black_block_1 blue_block_1
stack black_block_1 grey_block_1
unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1
stack black_block_1 grey_block_2
unstack grey_block_1 brown_block_1
stack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2
stack black_block_1 brown_block_1
unstack grey_block_2 red_block_1
stack grey_block_2 black_block_1
pickup red_block_1
putdown red_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
pickup blue_block_1
stack blue_block_1 red_block_1
unstack grey_block_2 black_block_1
stack grey_block_2 blue_block_1
unstack black_block_1 brown_block_1
stack black_block_1 grey_block_1
unstack brown_block_1 yellow_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1
stack black_block_1 brown_block_1
pickup grey_block_1
```

Oh, I should check the "unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1" and "stack black_block_1 grey_block_2" actions. From the resulting state, it doesn't seem like black_block_1 was on grey_block_1, but on grey_block_2. Let me review this part of the plan.

After "stack black_block_1 grey_block_1", the stacks are:
1. blue_block_1 on the table
2. black_block_1 on grey_block_1 on brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table
3. grey_block_2 on red_block_1 on the table

So, the next action should be "unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1" (not grey_block_2), which is correct. Let me double-check the rest of the plan. I think the main issue was right here.

Actually, I'm a bit confused, so let me double check the sequence of states more carefully.

After "unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1", the stacks are:
1. black_block_1 on blue_block_1 on the table
2. brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table
3. grey_block_2 on red_block_1 on the table

Arm: grey_block_1

After "stack grey_block_1 brown_block_1", the stacks are:
1. black_block_1 on blue_block_1 on the table
2. grey_block_1 on brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table
3. grey_block_2 on red_block_1 on the table

Arm: empty

After "unstack black_block_1 blue_block_1", the stacks are:
1. blue_block_1 on the table
2. grey_block_1 on brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table
3. grey_block_2 on red_block_1 on the table

Arm: black_block_1

After "stack black_block_1 grey_block_1", the stacks are:
1. blue_block_1 on the table
2. black_block_1 on grey_block_1 on brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table
3. grey_block_2 on red_block_1 on the table

Arm: empty

After "unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1", the stacks are:
1. blue_block_1 on the table
2. grey_block_1 on brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table
3. grey_block_2 on red_block_1 on the table

Arm: black_block_1

After "stack black_block_1 grey_block_2", the stacks are:
1. blue_block_1 on the table
2. grey_block_1 on brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table
3. black_block_1 on grey_block_2 on red_block_1 on the table

Arm: empty

This sequence looks correct.

I have verified that the plan:

1. Satisfies all the constraints.
2. Achieves the goal of holding grey_block_1.
3. Consists of valid actions given the preconditions of each action.

The final plan is:

```
unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
stack grey_block_2 red_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1
stack grey_block_1 brown_block_1
unstack black_block_1 blue_block_1
stack black_block_1 grey_block_1
unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1
stack black_block_1 grey_block_2
unstack grey_block_1 brown_block_1
stack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2
stack black_block_1 brown_block_1
unstack grey_block_2 red_block_1
stack grey_block_2 black_block_1
pickup red_block_1
putdown red_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
pickup blue_block_1
stack blue_block_1 red_block_1
unstack grey_block_2 black_block_1
stack grey_block_2 blue_block_1
unstack black_block_1 brown_block_1
stack black_block_1 grey_block_1
unstack brown_block_1 yellow_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1
stack black_block_1 brown_block_1
pickup grey_block_1
```

But before I settle on this, let me try to optimize it a bit. Let me see if I can find a shorter valid plan.

Looking at the core goal, we just need to hold grey_block_1. To do that, we need to:
1. Remove grey_block_2 from grey_block_1.
2. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1.

But we have all these other constraints to satisfy. Let's see if we can optimize.

Actually, I'm realizing that some of our actions might be redundant and we might be able to simplify the plan. Let me revisit the constraints:

1. grey_block_2 is never on the table.
2. There is a block on top of yellow_block_1 at some point (already satisfied initially).
3. If there's a block on top of yellow_block_1, black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 or we're holding black_block_1 at some point afterward.
4. black_block_1 is clear at some point.
5. Before black_block_1 is clear, yellow_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_1 is clear.
6. There's a block on top of blue_block_1 at some point (already satisfied initially).
7. If there's a block on top of blue_block_1, grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1 at some point afterward.
8. blue_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1 at some point (already satisfied initially).
9. If blue_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1, black_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1 or red_block_1 is not clear at some point afterward.
10. yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1 or red_block_1 is not on the table at some point.
11. There's a block on top of grey_block_1 at some point (already satisfied initially).
12. If there's a block on top of grey_block_1, we're holding red_block_1 or red_block_1 is not on the table at some point afterward.
13. We are holding brown_block_1 and blue_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 at some point.
14. We are holding black_block_1 or brown_block_1 at some point.
15. We are holding grey_block_2 at some point.
16. If we are holding grey_block_2, grey_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 or we are holding red_block_1 at some point afterward.

Starting from the initial state, I need to unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1:

```
unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
```

This satisfies constraint 15. Now, I have grey_block_2 in my hand. According to constraint 16, I need to ensure that after I hold grey_block_2, at some point either grey_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 or I am holding red_block_1. I'll plan for the former.

I can't put grey_block_2 on the table due to constraint 1, so I'll stack it on a clear block. The clear blocks currently are grey_block_2 (which I'm holding), brown_block_1, and red_block_1. I'll choose red_block_1:

```
stack grey_block_2 red_block_1
```

Now, I need to unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1:

```
unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1
```

I want to place grey_block_1 on brown_block_1 to satisfy constraint 16:

```
stack grey_block_1 brown_block_1
```

This satisfies constraint 16. Now, I can unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1 to start satisfying constraint 4:

```
unstack black_block_1 blue_block_1
```

This satisfies constraint 14 (I'm holding black_block_1) and constraint 4 (black_block_1 is clear).

To satisfy constraint 5, I need to ensure that before black_block_1 is clear, either yellow_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_1 is clear. Currently, yellow_block_1 is on the table, but blue_block_1 just became clear. So, constraint 5 is satisfied.

To satisfy constraint 3, I need to ensure that since there's a block on top of yellow_block_1 (brown_block_1), at some point black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 or I'm holding black_block_1. I'm currently holding black_block_1, so constraint 3 is satisfied.

To satisfy constraint 9, I need to ensure that since blue_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1, at some point either black_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1 or red_block_1 is not clear. Currently, black_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1 (I'm holding it), so constraint 9 is satisfied.

I'll stack black_block_1 on grey_block_1:

```
stack black_block_1 grey_block_1
```

This ensures constraint 11 is satisfied (there's a block on top of grey_block_1).

To satisfy constraint 12, I need to ensure that since there's a block on top of grey_block_1, at some point I'm holding red_block_1 or red_block_1 is not on the table. I'll plan for the former.

To access red_block_1, I need to remove grey_block_2 from it:

```
unstack grey_block_2 red_block_1
```

I'll stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1:

```
stack grey_block_2 black_block_1
```

Now, I can pick up red_block_1:

```
pickup red_block_1
```

This satisfies constraint 12 and constraint 10 (since red_block_1 is not on the table). I'll put red_block_1 back on the table:

```
putdown red_block_1
```

To satisfy constraint 7, I need to ensure that since there was a block on top of blue_block_1 (black_block_1), at some point grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1. However, grey_block_1 currently has black_block_1 and grey_block_2 on top of it, preventing me from moving it.

I'll unstack the blocks:

```
unstack grey_block_2 black_block_1
stack grey_block_2 red_block_1
unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1
```

Now I can unstack grey_block_1 from brown_block_1:

```
unstack grey_block_1 brown_block_1
```

I'll stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_1 to satisfy constraint 7:

```
stack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
```

To satisfy constraint 13, I need to hold brown_block_1 while blue_block_1 is on top of red_block_1. Currently, blue_block_1 is on the table with grey_block_1 on top of it, and brown_block_1 is on yellow_block_1.

First, I'll place black_block_1 somewhere so I can track it:

```
stack black_block_1 brown_block_1
```

Next, I'll unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1:

```
unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
```

I'll put grey_block_1 on the table temporarily:

```
putdown grey_block_1
```

Now, I can pick up blue_block_1:

```
pickup blue_block_1
```

I'll stack blue_block_1 on red_block_1:

```
stack blue_block_1 red_block_1
```

To hold brown_block_1, I need to remove black_block_1 from it:

```
unstack black_block_1 brown_block_1
```

I'll stack black_block_1 on grey_block_1:

```
stack black_block_1 grey_block_1
```

Finally, I can unstack brown_block_1 from yellow_block_1:

```
unstack brown_block_1 yellow_block_1
```

This satisfies constraint 13 (I'm holding brown_block_1 and blue_block_1 is on top of red_block_1).

I'll put brown_block_1 on the table temporarily:

```
putdown brown_block_1
```

To achieve our goal, I need to pick up grey_block_1, but it's covered by black_block_1:

```
unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1
```

I'll stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1:

```
stack black_block_1 brown_block_1
```

Finally, I can pick up grey_block_1:

```
pickup grey_block_1
```

So, the final optimized plan is:

```
unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
stack grey_block_2 red_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1
stack grey_block_1 brown_block_1
unstack black_block_1 blue_block_1
stack black_block_1 grey_block_1
unstack grey_block_2 red_block_1
stack grey_block_2 black_block_1
pickup red_block_1
putdown red_block_1
unstack grey_block_2 black_block_1
stack grey_block_2 red_block_1
unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 brown_block_1
stack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
stack black_block_1 brown_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
pickup blue_block_1
stack blue_block_1 red_block_1
unstack black_block_1 brown_block_1
stack black_block_1 grey_block_1
unstack brown_block_1 yellow_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1
stack black_block_1 brown_block_1
pickup grey_block_1
```

This plan has a length of 27 actions. Let me check if it satisfies all the constraints:

1. grey_block_2 has never been on the table. ✓
2. There has been a block on top of yellow_block_1 (brown_block_1). ✓
3. When there was a block on top of yellow_block_1, I was holding black_block_1. ✓
4. There has been a state where black_block_1 is clear. ✓
5. Before black_block_1 became clear, blue_block_1 was clear. ✓
6. There has been a block on top of blue_block_1 (black_block_1, and later grey_block_1). ✓
7. Since there was a block on top of blue_block_1, grey_block_1 was on top of blue_block_1 at some point. ✓
8. blue_block_1 has not been on top of brown_block_1. ✓
9. Since blue_block_1 isn't on top of brown_block_1, black_block_1 isn't on top of blue_block_1. ✓
10. red_block_1 has been off the table when I was holding it. ✓
11. There has been a block on top of grey_block_1 (black_block_1). ✓
12. Since there was a block on top of grey_block_1, I've held red_block_1. ✓
13. I've held brown_block_1 while blue_block_1 was on top of red_block_1. ✓
14. I've held black_block_1 and brown_block_1. ✓
15. I've held grey_block_2. ✓
16. After holding grey_block_2, grey_block_1 was on top of brown_block_1. ✓

All constraints are satisfied, and the length of our optimized plan is 27 actions. Let's proceed with this plan.
