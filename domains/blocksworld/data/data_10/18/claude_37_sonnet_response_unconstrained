I need to find an optimal plan to bring about the situation "you are holding grey_block_1". Let's analyze the initial state of the world:

The blocks are arranged as follows:
```
  grey_block_2     brown_block_1   red_block_1
  grey_block_1      yellow_block_1
  black_block_1
  blue_block_1
  -------------table----------------
```

The blocks that are clear (have no blocks on top) are:
- grey_block_2
- brown_block_1
- red_block_1

I am not holding any block initially.

Now, to reach the goal "you are holding grey_block_1", I need to:
1. First, remove any blocks that are on top of grey_block_1 (in this case, grey_block_2)
2. Then, pick up grey_block_1 from whatever it's on top of (in this case, black_block_1)

Let's work through this:

1. grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1, and grey_block_2 is clear, so I can unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1:
   - Action: unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1

2. Now, I'm holding grey_block_2, but I need to put it down somewhere to free my hand:
   - Action: putdown grey_block_2

3. Now, grey_block_1 is clear, and it's on top of black_block_1, so I can unstack it:
   - Action: unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1

At this point, I'm holding grey_block_1, which is the goal.

So the plan is:
1. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
2. putdown grey_block_2
3. unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1

Let me verify that this plan meets all the preconditions and achieves the goal:

Initial state:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is clear
- brown_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is clear
- not holding any block

Action 1: unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
Preconditions:
- grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1 (satisfied)
- grey_block_2 is clear (satisfied)
- not holding any block (satisfied)
Effects:
- grey_block_2 is not on top of grey_block_1
- grey_block_1 is clear
- holding grey_block_2

After Action 1:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is clear
- brown_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is clear
- holding grey_block_2

Action 2: putdown grey_block_2
Preconditions:
- holding grey_block_2 (satisfied)
Effects:
- grey_block_2 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is clear
- not holding any block

After Action 2:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is clear
- brown_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is clear
- grey_block_2 is clear
- not holding any block

Action 3: unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1
Preconditions:
- grey_block_1 is on top of black_block_1 (satisfied)
- grey_block_1 is clear (satisfied)
- not holding any block (satisfied)
Effects:
- grey_block_1 is not on top of black_block_1
- black_block_1 is clear
- holding grey_block_1

After Action 3:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on the table
- black_block_1 is clear
- brown_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is clear
- grey_block_2 is clear
- holding grey_block_1

Goal: you are holding grey_block_1 (satisfied)

The plan satisfies all preconditions and achieves the goal. And since each action is necessary to achieve the goal, this is an optimal plan with a length of 3 actions.

So the final plan is:
1. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
2. putdown grey_block_2
3. unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1
