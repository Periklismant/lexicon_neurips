Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld problem. The goal is to get the robotic arm to hold grey_block_1. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

First, looking at the initial setup. The blocks are arranged as follows:

- blue_block_1 is on the table with black_block_1 on top of it, then grey_block_1, and grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1. So the stack here is blue -> black -> grey_1 -> grey_2. And grey_2 is clear.

- yellow_block_1 is on the table with brown_block_1 on top, and brown is clear.

- red_block_1 is on the table and clear.

The robot is holding nothing initially.

The goal is to have the robot holding grey_block_1. So, I need to figure out the sequence of actions to get there.

First, since grey_block_1 is under grey_block_2 in the initial state, I need to unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1 before I can access grey_block_1. But to unstack grey_block_2, the preconditions are: grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1, grey_block_2 is clear, and the robot isn't holding anything. All these are true initially. So first action could be unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1. That would put the robot holding grey_block_2 and leave grey_block_1 clear.

After that, I need to put down grey_block_2 somewhere so I can free the arm to work on the next block. So putdown grey_block_2 on the table. Now, grey_block_2 is on the table, clear, and the arm is free.

Now, with grey_block_1 clear (since we removed grey_block_2), the next step is to unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1. Wait, but in the initial state, grey_block_1 is on top of black_block_1. So to unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1, the preconditions are: grey_block_1 is on black_block_1, it's clear (which it is now after the first unstack), and the arm is empty. After the putdown, the arm is empty. So yes, we can unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1. That would make the robot hold grey_block_1, which is the goal. So that's two steps after the initial actions.

Wait, wait. Let me check again. The initial stack is blue_block_1 (on table) -> black_block_1 -> grey_block_1 -> grey_block_2. So after unstacking grey_block_2 from grey_block_1, the arm holds grey_block_2. Then put it down. Now, the arm is empty again. Then, the next step is to unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1. Because after removing grey_block_2, grey_block_1 is clear. So unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1. That would make the arm hold grey_block_1, achieving the goal. So the plan would be:

1. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
2. putdown grey_block_2
3. unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1

Wait, but after step 3, the arm is holding grey_block_1, which is the goal. So that's three actions. Is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, is there a way to avoid putting down grey_block_2? Let me think. Suppose after unstacking grey_block_2, instead of putting it down, can I stack it somewhere else? But to stack it, I need a clear block. The available clear blocks after unstacking grey_block_2 are grey_block_1 (now clear), brown_block_1, red_block_1. So maybe stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_1? But brown_block_1 is on yellow_block_1. Stacking grey_block_2 there would require that brown_block_1 is clear, which it is. So:

After unstacking grey_block_2 grey_block_1, stack grey_block_2 brown_block_1. That way, the arm is free again. Then unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1. That would be three actions as well. But maybe that's better than putting down. But the plan length is the same. However, the problem states to provide an optimal plan with the shortest possible steps. So both approaches are three steps. Let's check which is valid.

First approach:

1. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 (arm holds grey_2)
2. putdown grey_2 (arm empty, grey_2 on table)
3. unstack grey_1 black_1 (arm holds grey_1)

Second approach:

1. unstack grey_2 grey_1
2. stack grey_2 brown_1 (arm empty)
3. unstack grey_1 black_1

Both are three steps. So either is acceptable. But the problem doesn't specify any constraints other than the actions' preconditions. Are there any constraints given that I missed? The user mentioned "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then there's nothing listed. Wait, maybe I need to check the original problem statement again. Oh, the user provided the problem with constraints, but in the copy here, after "The task is to bring about the following situation...", the constraints section is empty. So maybe there are no additional constraints beyond the usual action preconditions.

So either plan is acceptable. But perhaps putting down grey_block_2 on the table is simpler. Let's verify the steps.

First approach:

1. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1. Preconditions: grey_2 is on grey_1, grey_2 is clear (yes), arm empty (yes). After this, the arm holds grey_2, grey_1 is clear.

2. putdown grey_2. Precondition: arm is holding grey_2. Yes. After this, grey_2 is on table, arm empty.

3. unstack grey_1 black_1. Preconditions: grey_1 is on black_1 (yes), grey_1 is clear (yes, after step 1), arm is empty (yes). So this works. After this, arm holds grey_1, which is the goal.

That's three steps. Is there a shorter way? Let's see.

Is there a way to get grey_1 without moving grey_2? No, because in the initial state, grey_1 has grey_2 on top. So grey_2 must be moved first.

Alternatively, could we unstack grey_1 from black_1 first? But initially, grey_1 has grey_2 on top, so grey_1 is not clear. Therefore, you can't unstack grey_1 until grey_2 is removed. So step 1 is necessary.

So the minimal plan is three actions. Therefore, the answer should be:

```
unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
putdown grey_block_2
unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1
```

Alternatively, using stack instead of putdown, but that's same number of steps. But maybe the first approach is shorter in terms of actions. Both are valid. But since the problem asks for an optimal plan, any of them is acceptable as long as the steps are minimal. However, putting down might be more straightforward as it doesn't require finding another block to stack on, but the problem doesn't have constraints against stacking. Either way, three steps is the minimal.

Wait, wait. Let me check if there's another approach. Suppose after unstacking grey_2, can we unstack grey_1 immediately? No, because after unstacking grey_2, the arm is holding it. So we need to put it down or stack it somewhere else first to free the arm. So steps 1 and 2 are necessary. Then step 3. So three steps is the minimum.
