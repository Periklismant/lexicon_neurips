```
unstack orange_block_2 purple_block_1
```
``` 

The optimal plan is to directly unstack orange_block_2 from purple_block_1. Since orange_block_2 is clear and on purple_block_1 in the initial state, and the robotic arm is empty, this action meets all preconditions. Its effect makes the arm hold orange_block_2, achieving the goal in 1 action. No shorter plan exists.
