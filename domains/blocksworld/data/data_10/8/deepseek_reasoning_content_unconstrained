Okay, so I need to figure out how to get the robotic arm to hold orange_block_2. Let me start by looking at the initial state.

First, let's list out where all the blocks are:

- yellow_block_1 is on the table.
- purple_block_1 is on the table, and orange_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1. Also, orange_block_2 is clear.
- black_block_1 is on the table, and orange_block_1 is on black_block_1. Then white_block_1 is on orange_block_1, and white_block_1 is clear.
- yellow_block_2 is on yellow_block_1, and it's clear.

The goal is to have the arm holding orange_block_2. So, I need to find a sequence of actions that allows the arm to pick up orange_block_2.

Looking at the current position of orange_block_2: it's on top of purple_block_1. So, to pick it up, the arm needs to unstack it from purple_block_1. But to do that, the preconditions for unstack must be met. The preconditions for unstack x y are: x is on y, x is clear, and the arm isn't holding anything.

In this case, orange_block_2 is on purple_block_1, and it's clear. Also, the arm is not holding anything initially. So the unstack action should be possible here.

Wait, so maybe the first action is unstack orange_block_2 purple_block_1. That would make the arm hold orange_block_2, which is the goal. Then the plan would just be that one action. But wait, is that allowed?

Let me check the effects of unstack. When you unstack x y, you pick up x from y. So after unstacking, the arm is holding x. So if the goal is to be holding orange_block_2, then unstacking it from purple_block_1 would achieve that in one step. That seems too easy. Is there any reason why that's not possible?

Wait, looking back at the initial state: orange_block_2 is on purple_block_1, and it's clear. The arm isn't holding anything. So the preconditions for unstack orange_block_2 purple_block_1 are all satisfied. Therefore, performing that action would immediately satisfy the goal. So the plan would just be that single action. But maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check.

The action is "unstack x y", which requires x is on y, x is clear, and the arm is empty. Yes, all true here. So the action is valid, and after performing it, the arm is holding orange_block_2. That's exactly the goal. So the optimal plan is just one step: unstack orange_block_2 purple_block_1. There's no need for any other actions because the goal is achieved immediately. Therefore, the answer should be that single action.
