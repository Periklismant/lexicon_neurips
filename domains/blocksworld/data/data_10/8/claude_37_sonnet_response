In this problem, I need to find a valid sequence of actions to achieve the goal:
"you are holding orange_block_2"

Starting from the initial state:
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table
- orange_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1
- white_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- orange_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is clear
- white_block_1 is clear
- orange_block_2 is clear
- you are not holding any block

I also need to satisfy numerous constraints:

1. At some point: yellow_block_2 is not clear AND you are holding black_block_1
2. At some point: you are holding orange_block_1
3. At some point: purple_block_1 is clear
4. If purple_block_1 becomes clear, then earlier black_block_1 must be clear OR not on the table
5. At some point: you are holding purple_block_1
6. At some point: orange_block_1 is on the table OR yellow_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1
7. At some point: orange_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
8. At some point: purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
9. At some point: orange_block_2 is not clear
10. If orange_block_2 becomes not clear, then earlier yellow_block_2 is on the table OR purple_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2
11. At some point: black_block_1 is clear
12. At some point: purple_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2 OR yellow_block_1 is clear

Let me visualize the initial state:
```
  yellow_block_2    white_block_1    orange_block_2
       |                 |                |
  yellow_block_1    orange_block_1    purple_block_1
                         |
                    black_block_1
       
       TABLE
```

And the goal state is simply: (you are holding orange_block_2)

Now let's carefully plan the sequence of actions, ensuring all constraints are met. I'll need to:
1. Unstack orange_block_2 from purple_block_1 to reach the goal, but I need to do a lot more to satisfy the constraints.

Let me think through a plan that satisfies all constraints:

First, let's try to free up black_block_1 so that we can hold it at some point.
1. To get to black_block_1, I need to remove orange_block_1 from it, but orange_block_1 has white_block_1 on top.
2. So I first unstack white_block_1 from orange_block_1
3. Then unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_1
4. Now I can pickup black_block_1

At this point, I need to make sure yellow_block_2 is not clear (constraint 1).
5. I can stack something on yellow_block_2 (which is currently clear)

Now, other constraints:
- I need to hold orange_block_1 (constraint 2) - already done
- I need purple_block_1 to be clear (constraint 3) - it will be if I unstack orange_block_2
- I need to hold purple_block_1 (constraint 5)
- I need orange_block_2 on top of black_block_1 (constraint 7)
- I need purple_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1 (constraint 8)
- I need orange_block_2 to not be clear (constraint 9)

Let me draft a potential plan and then check constraints:

1. unstack white_block_1 orange_block_1
2. unstack orange_block_1 black_block_1
3. pickup black_block_1
4. stack black_block_1 yellow_block_2 (satisfies constraint 1)
5. putdown black_block_1
6. pickup orange_block_1 (satisfies constraint 2)
7. putdown orange_block_1
8. unstack orange_block_2 purple_block_1 (this makes purple_block_1 clear, satisfying constraint 3)
9. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1 (satisfies constraint 7)
10. pickup purple_block_1 (satisfies constraint 5)
11. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1 (satisfies constraint 8)
12. pickup white_block_1
13. stack white_block_1 orange_block_2 (makes orange_block_2 not clear, satisfying constraint 9)
14. unstack white_block_1 orange_block_2
15. putdown white_block_1
16. unstack orange_block_2 black_block_1 (makes black_block_1 clear, satisfying constraint 11)
17. This is our goal state: holding orange_block_2

Now I need to check if all constraints are satisfied:

1. ✓ yellow_block_2 is not clear and you are holding black_block_1 (after step 4)
2. ✓ you are holding orange_block_1 (after step 6)
3. ✓ purple_block_1 is clear (after step 8)
4. ? If purple_block_1 becomes clear, then earlier black_block_1 must be clear OR not on the table.
   This would be satisfied if black_block_1 becomes clear before purple_block_1 becomes clear, which 
   is satisfied since we make black_block_1 clear in step 2 before purple_block_1 becomes clear in step 8.
5. ✓ you are holding purple_block_1 (after step 10)
6. ✓ orange_block_1 is on the table (after step 7)
7. ✓ orange_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 (after step 9)
8. ✓ purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1 (after step 11)
9. ✓ orange_block_2 is not clear (after step 13)
10. ? If orange_block_2 becomes not clear, then earlier yellow_block_2 must be on the table OR purple_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2.
    We don't satisfy this with our current plan since yellow_block_2 is never on the table and purple_block_1 is never on top of orange_block_2.
11. ✓ black_block_1 is clear (after step 16)
12. ? purple_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2 OR yellow_block_1 is clear.
    yellow_block_1 would become clear after we unstack yellow_block_2, but we never do that in our plan.

Let me adjust the plan to satisfy constraints 10 and 12:

1. unstack white_block_1 orange_block_1
2. unstack orange_block_1 black_block_1
3. pickup black_block_1
4. stack black_block_1 yellow_block_2 (satisfies constraint 1)
5. putdown black_block_1
6. pickup orange_block_1 (satisfies constraint 2)
7. putdown orange_block_1
8. unstack orange_block_2 purple_block_1 (this makes purple_block_1 clear, satisfying constraint 3)
9. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1 (satisfies constraint 7)
10. pickup purple_block_1 (satisfies constraint 5)
11. stack purple_block_1 orange_block_2 (satisfies constraint 10 pre-requirement and constraint 12)
   - Now orange_block_2 is not clear (constraint 9)
12. unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_2
13. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1 (satisfies constraint 8)
14. unstack orange_block_2 black_block_1
15. This is our goal state: holding orange_block_2

Let me review this revised plan against all constraints:

1. ✓ yellow_block_2 is not clear and you are holding black_block_1 (after step 4)
2. ✓ you are holding orange_block_1 (after step 6)
3. ✓ purple_block_1 is clear (after step 8)
4. ✓ If purple_block_1 becomes clear, then earlier black_block_1 must be clear OR not on the table.
   This would be satisfied since we make black_block_1 clear in step 2 before purple_block_1 becomes clear in step 8.
5. ✓ you are holding purple_block_1 (after step 10)
6. ✓ orange_block_1 is on the table (after step 7)
7. ✓ orange_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 (after step 9)
8. ✓ purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1 (after step 13)
9. ✓ orange_block_2 is not clear (after step 11)
10. ✓ If orange_block_2 becomes not clear, then earlier yellow_block_2 must be on the table OR purple_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2.
    Satisfied because we put purple_block_1 on top of orange_block_2 in step 11.
11. ✓ black_block_1 is clear (after step 14)
12. ✓ purple_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2 OR yellow_block_1 is clear.
    Satisfied because we stack purple_block_1 on orange_block_2 in step 11.

Wait, I notice constraint 11 requires black_block_1 to be clear at some point, but after step 14, black_block_1 isn't necessarily clear - I'd need to explicitly check. Let me review the steps again:

1. unstack white_block_1 orange_block_1 (white_block_1 is now in hand, orange_block_1 is clear)
2. unstack orange_block_1 black_block_1 (orange_block_1 is in hand, black_block_1 is clear) - This satisfies constraint 11
3. pickup black_block_1 (black_block_1 is in hand)
4. stack black_block_1 yellow_block_2 (satisfies constraint 1, black_block_1 is on yellow_block_2)
5. putdown black_block_1 (black_block_1 is on table, clear)

Hmm, there seems to be a mistake in my reasoning. Let me re-think the physical layout at step 4. I want to stack black_block_1 on yellow_block_2, but note that yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1 in the initial state. So after stacking black_block_1 on yellow_block_2, yellow_block_2 would NOT be clear, which satisfies constraint 1.

I need to redo the plan more carefully:

Initial state recap:
```
  yellow_block_2    white_block_1    orange_block_2
       |                 |                |
  yellow_block_1    orange_block_1    purple_block_1
                         |
                    black_block_1
       
       TABLE
```

Let's try again:

1. unstack white_block_1 orange_block_1 
   - Now holding white_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear
2. putdown white_block_1
   - white_block_1 is on table and clear, not holding anything
3. unstack orange_block_1 black_block_1
   - Now holding orange_block_1, black_block_1 is clear (satisfies constraint 11)
4. putdown orange_block_1 
   - orange_block_1 is on table and clear (satisfies constraint 6), not holding anything
5. pickup black_block_1
   - Now holding black_block_1
6. stack black_block_1 yellow_block_2
   - black_block_1 is on yellow_block_2, which makes yellow_block_2 not clear
   - This satisfies constraint 1 (yellow_block_2 not clear AND holding black_block_1)
7. unstack black_block_1 yellow_block_2
   - Now holding black_block_1, yellow_block_2 is clear
8. putdown black_block_1
   - black_block_1 is on table and clear, not holding anything
9. pickup orange_block_1
   - Now holding orange_block_1 (satisfies constraint 2)
10. putdown orange_block_1
    - orange_block_1 is on table and clear, not holding anything
11. unstack orange_block_2 purple_block_1
    - Now holding orange_block_2, purple_block_1 is clear (satisfies constraint 3)
12. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1
    - orange_block_2 is on black_block_1 (satisfies constraint 7), not holding anything
13. pickup purple_block_1
    - Now holding purple_block_1 (satisfies constraint 5)
14. stack purple_block_1 orange_block_2
    - purple_block_1 is on orange_block_2, making orange_block_2 not clear
    - This satisfies constraint 9 and the prerequisite for constraint 10
    - This also satisfies constraint 12 (purple_block_1 on orange_block_2)
15. unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_2
    - Now holding purple_block_1, orange_block_2 is clear
16. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
    - purple_block_1 is on yellow_block_1 (satisfies constraint 8), not holding anything
17. unstack orange_block_2 black_block_1
    - Now holding orange_block_2, which is our goal

Now let's verify all constraints are met:

1. ✓ yellow_block_2 is not clear and you are holding black_block_1 (at step 6)
2. ✓ you are holding orange_block_1 (at step 9)
3. ✓ purple_block_1 is clear (at step 11)
4. ✓ If purple_block_1 becomes clear, then earlier black_block_1 must be clear OR not on the table.
   This is satisfied because black_block_1 is clear at step 3, which is before purple_block_1 becomes clear at step 11.
5. ✓ you are holding purple_block_1 (at steps 13 and 15)
6. ✓ orange_block_1 is on the table (at step 10)
7. ✓ orange_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 (at step 12)
8. ✓ purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1 (at step 16)
9. ✓ orange_block_2 is not clear (at step 14)
10. ✓ If orange_block_2 becomes not clear, then earlier yellow_block_2 must be on the table OR purple_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2.
    This is satisfied because purple_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2 at step 14.
11. ✓ black_block_1 is clear (at step 3)
12. ✓ purple_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2 OR yellow_block_1 is clear.
    This is satisfied because purple_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2 at step 14.

The final plan looks good! All constraints are satisfied, and we end up with the goal of holding orange_block_2.

Let's double-check the plan for optimality. The plan has 17 steps. I don't immediately see how to make it shorter while still satisfying all constraints. There are a lot of elaborate constraints to satisfy, which necessitates quite a few steps.

Here's the final plan:
1. unstack white_block_1 orange_block_1 
2. putdown white_block_1
3. unstack orange_block_1 black_block_1
4. putdown orange_block_1 
5. pickup black_block_1
6. stack black_block_1 yellow_block_2
7. unstack black_block_1 yellow_block_2
8. putdown black_block_1
9. pickup orange_block_1
10. putdown orange_block_1
11. unstack orange_block_2 purple_block_1
12. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1
13. pickup purple_block_1
14. stack purple_block_1 orange_block_2
15. unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_2
16. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
17. unstack orange_block_2 black_block_1
