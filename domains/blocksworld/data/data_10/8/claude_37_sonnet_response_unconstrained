Let's analyze the problem:

We have 7 blocks: yellow_block_1, purple_block_1, black_block_1, orange_block_1, yellow_block_2, white_block_1, and orange_block_2.

The current state is:
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table
- orange_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1
- white_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- orange_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1
- yellow_block_2, white_block_1, and orange_block_2 are clear
- you are not holding any block

The goal is to be holding orange_block_2.

To do this, we need to use the "unstack" action, as orange_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1.

Let's check the preconditions for "unstack orange_block_2 purple_block_1":
1. orange_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1 - Yes, this is true
2. orange_block_2 is clear - Yes, this is true
3. you are not holding any block - Yes, this is true

So, all preconditions are met, and we can perform the action "unstack orange_block_2 purple_block_1".

The effects of this action will be:
1. orange_block_2 is no longer on top of purple_block_1
2. purple_block_1 is now clear
3. you are holding orange_block_2

This achieves our goal of "you are holding orange_block_2".

So, the plan is simply:
```
unstack orange_block_2 purple_block_1
```

Let's double-check that this satisfies the goal and all constraints.

After executing "unstack orange_block_2 purple_block_1", we have:
- you are holding orange_block_2

Which matches our goal. There are no additional constraints mentioned, so this plan is valid.

Actually, let me check if the optimal plan is really just one action. Given the initial state and goal, we want to be holding orange_block_2, which is initially on top of purple_block_1. Since orange_block_2 is clear and we're not holding any block, we can directly unstack it from purple_block_1, which is the action we've identified. There's no way to achieve the goal in fewer steps, so this is indeed the optimal plan.

```
unstack orange_block_2 purple_block_1
```
