I'll solve this planning problem step by step.

First, let me understand the initial state:
- Grey_block_1 is on the table with brown_block_1 on top of it, and grey_block_2 on top of brown_block_1
- Purple_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top of it, and yellow_block_2 on top of yellow_block_1
- Purple_block_2 is on the table and clear
- Grey_block_2, yellow_block_2, and purple_block_2 are clear
- The arm is empty

The goal is to have yellow_block_1 on top of brown_block_1.

There's also a constraint: at some point, we need to have both purple_block_1 on top of brown_block_1 AND grey_block_2 on top of grey_block_1.

Let me plan this out:
1. First, I need to disassemble the current stacks to free up the blocks
2. Create the intermediate state required by the constraint
3. Then create the final goal state

Here's the optimal plan:

```
unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
putdown grey_block_2
unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
putdown yellow_block_2
unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
putdown yellow_block_1
pickup purple_block_1
stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
pickup grey_block_2
stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
putdown purple_block_1
pickup yellow_block_1
stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1
```
