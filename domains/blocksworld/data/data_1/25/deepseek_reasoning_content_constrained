Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this Blocksworld problem. The goal is to get yellow_block_1 on top of brown_block_1. The initial state is a bit complex, so I need to map it out first.

Starting with the initial state:

- grey_block_1 is on the table, with brown_block_1 on top of it, and then grey_block_2 on top of brown_block_1. Since grey_block_2 is clear, that's the top of that stack.
- purple_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on it, and yellow_block_2 on top of yellow_block_1. Both yellow_block_2 and purple_block_2 are clear.
- purple_block_2 is alone on the table and clear.

The constraints require that at some point, purple_block_1 is on brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1. Wait, but in the initial state, grey_block_2 is already on brown_block_1, right? Wait no. Let me check again. Initial state says brown_block_1 is on grey_block_1, then grey_block_2 is on brown_block_1. So the stack is grey_block_1 (table), brown_block_1, grey_block_2. So grey_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1. But the constraint needs purple_block_1 on brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 on grey_block_1. So that means moving grey_block_2 from brown_block_1 to grey_block_1, and putting purple_block_1 onto brown_block_1. But that has to happen at some point in the plan.

But the final goal is yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1. So perhaps after moving grey_block_2 and brown_block_1 around, we can place yellow_block_1 there.

Let me outline the steps needed:

First, to achieve the goal, yellow_block_1 needs to be on brown_block_1. Currently, yellow_block_1 is under yellow_block_2. So to get yellow_block_1, we need to unstack yellow_block_2 from it. Then, we can pick up yellow_block_1 and place it on brown_block_1. But brown_block_1 currently has grey_block_2 on top. So we need to remove grey_block_2 from brown_block_1 first.

But also, the constraint requires that at some point, purple_block_1 is on brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1. So maybe during the process, when we move grey_block_2 from brown_block_1 to grey_block_1 (which is on the table), that satisfies the grey_block_2 part. Then, putting purple_block_1 on brown_block_1 would be another step. But then, perhaps we have to do that and then undo it to get the final state.

Wait, the final goal is just yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1, so the constraint is that in some state along the plan, purple_block_1 is on brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1. So maybe after moving grey_block_2 to grey_block_1 and placing purple_block_1 on brown_block_1, that state is part of the plan. Then, we can move purple_block_1 off again to place yellow_block_1 there.

Let's break it down step by step.

Current stack for brown_block_1:

grey_block_1 (table) -> brown_block_1 -> grey_block_2 (clear)

To move grey_block_2 to grey_block_1: Since grey_block_1 is on the table, and grey_block_2 is on brown_block_1, which is on grey_block_1. Wait, no: brown_block_1 is on grey_block_1, and grey_block_2 is on brown_block_1. So to unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1, we can do unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1. Then put it down on the table? But the constraint needs grey_block_2 on grey_block_1. So after unstacking grey_block_2, we need to stack it on grey_block_1. But grey_block_1 is under brown_block_1. Wait, grey_block_1 is on the table, and brown_block_1 is on grey_block_1. So grey_block_1 has brown_block_1 on top. Therefore, grey_block_1 is not clear. So we can't stack anything onto it unless we first remove brown_block_1. But that's part of the initial structure. Hmm, this complicates things.

Wait, the constraint requires that in some state, grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1. So how can we do that? Because currently, grey_block_1 has brown_block_1 on it, which is supporting grey_block_2. So to put grey_block_2 on grey_block_1, we need to move brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 out of the way first.

Alternatively, maybe we can unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1, but that's not possible because brown_block_1 has grey_block_2 on top. So to unstack brown_block_1, we first need to clear it by removing grey_block_2. So:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1. Then the arm is holding grey_block_2. Then, put it down somewhere, maybe on the table. Then, unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1. Then, stack grey_block_2 onto grey_block_1. But then brown_block_1 is free, and we can place purple_block_1 on brown_block_1 to satisfy the constraint. But this is getting complicated. Let's think step by step.

But the final goal is yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1. So maybe after moving grey_block_2, we can place yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1. However, the constraint requires that at some point, purple_block_1 is on brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1. So perhaps during the process, after moving grey_block_2 to grey_block_1 and placing purple_block_1 on brown_block_1, and then moving them again.

But how can we arrange that?

Let me try to outline the steps:

First, handle the yellow_block_1. To get yellow_block_1, we need to remove yellow_block_2 from it. So:

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. Now holding yellow_block_2. Put it down on the table (putdown yellow_block_2). Now yellow_block_1 is clear.

Then, to get yellow_block_1 onto brown_block_1, we need to have brown_block_1 clear. But brown_block_1 currently has grey_block_2 on it. So we need to move grey_block_2. But moving grey_block_2 would involve unstacking it from brown_block_1. So:

2. Unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1. Now holding grey_block_2. Then, where to put it? To satisfy the constraint, we need to have grey_block_2 on grey_block_1 at some point. So maybe stack it on grey_block_1. But wait, grey_block_1 is under brown_block_1, which is under grey_block_2. Wait, no. Initially, grey_block_1 is on the table, brown_block_1 is on grey_block_1, grey_block_2 is on brown_block_1. So grey_block_1's current stack is brown_block_1 and grey_block_2. So to put grey_block_2 onto grey_block_1, we need to move brown_block_1 out of the way.

Alternatively, perhaps after removing grey_block_2 from brown_block_1, we can stack it on grey_block_1. But grey_block_1 currently has brown_block_1 on it, so it's not clear. Therefore, that's not possible. So perhaps we need to first unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1. But brown_block_1 is under grey_block_2. So first, unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1 (step 2), then putdown grey_block_2. Then, unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1. Now, brown_block_1 is free. Then, stack grey_block_2 onto grey_block_1. That way, grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1, satisfying part of the constraint.

Then, we can stack purple_block_1 onto brown_block_1 (since brown_block_1 is now clear), which would satisfy the other part of the constraint. Then, after that, we can move purple_block_1 off brown_block_1 to make room for yellow_block_1.

But this seems like a lot of steps. Let's outline this:

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1 → holding yellow_block_2.
2. Putdown yellow_block_2 → yellow_block_2 is on table.
3. Unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1 → holding grey_block_2.
4. Putdown grey_block_2 → grey_block_2 is on table.
5. Unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1 → holding brown_block_1.
6. Stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 → now grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1. At this point, the constraint's grey_block_2 on grey_block_1 is satisfied.
7. Stack brown_block_1 purple_block_1 → wait, no. Wait, the constraint also requires purple_block_1 on brown_block_1. Wait, the constraint says "purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1" and "grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1". So after step 6, grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1. Then, we need to put purple_block_1 on brown_block_1. But brown_block_1 is currently being held after step 5. Wait, step 5 unstacked brown_block_1 from grey_block_1, so after step 5, the arm is holding brown_block_1. Then, step 6 is stack grey_block_2 (which was put down in step 4) onto grey_block_1. But wait, step 4 puts grey_block_2 on the table, so to stack it on grey_block_1, we need to pick it up again. So maybe the steps need to be adjusted.

Wait, let's re-examine the steps:

After step 3: unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1 → holding grey_block_2.

Step 4: putdown grey_block_2.

Step 5: unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1 → now holding brown_block_1.

Now, to stack grey_block_2 onto grey_block_1, since grey_block_1 is clear (after step 5 removed brown_block_1 from it), we can do:

Step 6: pickup grey_block_2 (which is on the table, clear).

Step 7: stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1.

Now, grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1. That satisfies part of the constraint.

Then, to get purple_block_1 onto brown_block_1, we can:

Step 8: stack brown_block_1 purple_block_1? Wait, no. We have brown_block_1 in hand after step 5, but step 8 would be after step 7. Wait, no. After step 5, we have brown_block_1 in hand. Then step 6 is pickup grey_block_2, which requires putting down brown_block_1 first. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me correct the steps.

Wait, after step 5: holding brown_block_1. To stack grey_block_2 on grey_block_1, the arm needs to hold grey_block_2, but currently it's holding brown_block_1. So we need to put down brown_block_1 first.

So step 5: unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1 → holding brown_block_1.

Step 6: putdown brown_block_1 → brown_block_1 is on table, clear.

Now, step 7: pickup grey_block_2 (which is on the table, clear).

Step 8: stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1.

Now, grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1, satisfying that part.

Then, to get purple_block_1 onto brown_block_1:

Step 9: pickup purple_block_1 (which is on the table, clear).

Step 10: stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1 (since brown_block_1 is on the table and clear).

Now, in this state, purple_block_1 is on brown_block_1, which is on the table, and grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1. So the constraint is satisfied here.

Then, to proceed towards the goal of yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1, we need to move purple_block_1 off brown_block_1.

Step 11: unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1 → holding purple_block_1.

Step 12: putdown purple_block_1.

Now, brown_block_1 is clear again.

Then, pick up yellow_block_1 (which was cleared earlier when we removed yellow_block_2).

Step 13: pickup yellow_block_1.

Step 14: stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1.

This would achieve the goal. But let's check if all these steps are valid.

But this seems like a lot of steps. Also, perhaps there's a more optimal path.

Alternatively, after step 5 (holding brown_block_1), instead of putting it down, maybe we can stack it onto purple_block_1 to get purple_block_1 under it, but that doesn't help. Wait, the constraint needs purple_block_1 on top of brown_block_1. So perhaps if after step 5, we stack brown_block_1 onto purple_block_1, but that would put brown_block_1 on top of purple_block_1, which is the opposite of what the constraint needs. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, after moving grey_block_2 and brown_block_1, maybe there's a way to achieve the constraint in fewer steps.

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe during the process of moving grey_block_2 and brown_block_1, we can create the required state.

For example:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1 → holding grey_block_2.

2. Stack grey_block_2 onto grey_block_1 → but grey_block_1 has brown_block_1 on it. So to do this, we need to clear grey_block_1. Which requires moving brown_block_1.

But how? To clear grey_block_1, we need to remove brown_block_1. But brown_block_1 is under grey_block_2 in the initial state, but after step 1, grey_block_2 is in hand. Then, brown_block_1 is clear (since grey_block_2 was removed). So then, we can unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1.

So:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1 → holding grey_block_2.

2. Putdown grey_block_2.

3. Unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1 → holding brown_block_1.

4. Stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 → now grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1 (constraint part satisfied).

Now, brown_block_1 is in hand. To satisfy the other part of the constraint (purple_block_1 on brown_block_1), we can stack brown_block_1 onto purple_block_1? No, because the constraint requires purple_block_1 on brown_block_1. So perhaps:

5. Putdown brown_block_1 (so it's on the table, clear).

6. Pickup purple_block_1 (which is on the table, clear).

7. Stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1 → now purple_block_1 is on brown_block_1 (constraint satisfied).

At this point, the constraint conditions are met (grey_block_2 on grey_block_1, purple_block_1 on brown_block_1).

Now, to proceed towards the goal, we need to move purple_block_1 off brown_block_1 so we can place yellow_block_1 there.

8. Unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1 → holding purple_block_1.

9. Putdown purple_block_1.

Now, brown_block_1 is clear. Then, we need to move yellow_block_1 to brown_block_1. But yellow_block_1 is under yellow_block_2. So:

10. Unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1 → holding yellow_block_2.

11. Putdown yellow_block_2.

12. Pickup yellow_block_1.

13. Stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1 → goal achieved.

So total steps would be 13. But maybe there's a shorter path.

Wait, let's check if step 4 (stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1) is possible. After step 3, brown_block_1 was unstacked from grey_block_1, so grey_block_1 is clear. So yes, we can stack grey_block_2 onto grey_block_1.

Then, after step 7, the constraint is met. Then proceed to unstack purple_block_1 and place yellow_block_1.

But let's count the steps again:

1. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1

2. putdown grey_block_2

3. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1

4. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1

5. putdown brown_block_1

6. pickup purple_block_1

7. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1

8. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1

9. putdown purple_block_1

10. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1

11. putdown yellow_block_2

12. pickup yellow_block_1

13. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1

That's 13 actions. But maybe some steps can be optimized.

For example, after step 3, the arm is holding brown_block_1. Instead of putting it down (step 5), can we stack it onto purple_block_1 (to satisfy the constraint in a different way)? But the constraint requires purple_block_1 on brown_block_1. So stacking brown_block_1 on purple_block_1 would make purple_block_1 under brown_block_1, not on top.

Alternatively, after step 3, holding brown_block_1, perhaps we can stack purple_block_1 onto brown_block_1. But to do that, we need to have purple_block_1 in hand. So maybe after step 3:

4. putdown brown_block_1

5. pickup purple_block_1

6. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1 → now purple_block_1 is on brown_block_1.

But then, grey_block_2 is still on the table (from step 2). So we need to move it to grey_block_1.

7. pickup grey_block_2

8. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 → now the constraint is met.

But this changes the order. So after step 3, the arm is holding brown_block_1. We put it down (step4). Then pick up purple_block_1 (step5) and stack on brown_block_1 (step6). Then pick up grey_block_2 (step7) and stack on grey_block_1 (step8). Now, the constraint is met. Then, proceed as before.

This way, steps are:

1. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1

2. putdown grey_block_2

3. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1

4. putdown brown_block_1

5. pickup purple_block_1

6. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1

7. pickup grey_block_2

8. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1

Then, unstack purple_block_1, etc.

But this may add more steps. Let's count:

1-8 steps to meet the constraint, then steps 9-13 to reach the goal. That would be 8 + 5 = 13 steps again. Not shorter.

Alternative approach: When handling yellow_block_1 first. For example:

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1 → hold yellow_block_2, putdown.

Then, we have yellow_block_1 clear. But to place it on brown_block_1, which is under grey_block_2. So:

2. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1 → hold grey_block_2, stack it on grey_block_1 (if possible).

But again, grey_block_1 has brown_block_1 on it, so can't stack until brown_block_1 is moved.

Hmm. Maybe the steps are unavoidable. Let's try to see if there's a way to combine steps.

Wait, after unstacking grey_block_2 from brown_block_1, we can stack it on grey_block_1 only after moving brown_block_1. So perhaps:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1 → hold grey_block_2.

2. Unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1 → but to do that, the arm must be empty. So we need to put down grey_block_2 first.

So:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1 → hold grey_block_2.

2. Putdown grey_block_2.

3. Unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold brown_block_1.

4. Stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 → now grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1.

5. Putdown brown_block_1 → now brown_block_1 is on table, clear.

6. Pickup purple_block_1 → hold it.

7. Stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1 → constraint met.

8. Now, unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1 → hold purple_block_1.

9. Putdown purple_block_1.

10. Pickup yellow_block_1 → but yellow_block_1 is under yellow_block_2. So need to unstack yellow_block_2 first.

11. Unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1 → hold yellow_block_2.

12. Putdown yellow_block_2.

13. Pickup yellow_block_1.

14. Stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1.

That's 14 steps. Wait, but earlier plan was 13. Hmm, maybe I missed something.

Alternatively, after step 7 (stack purple_block_1 on brown_block_1), the constraint is satisfied. Then, we can proceed to unstack purple_block_1 and move yellow_block_1. But perhaps there's a way to do this with fewer steps.

Wait, the key steps are:

- Clear yellow_block_1 by moving yellow_block_2.

- Clear brown_block_1 by moving grey_block_2 and brown_block_1.

- Satisfy the constraint by placing grey_block_2 on grey_block_1 and purple_block_1 on brown_block_1.

- Then move purple_block_1 off and place yellow_block_1.

Let me see if there's a way to interleave these steps.

For example, after unstacking yellow_block_2 and putting it down, then dealing with the grey_block_2 and brown_block_1.

But this may not save steps. Alternatively, after stacking purple_block_1 on brown_block_1, can we use that block to help in some way? Probably not.

Another angle: The constraint requires that the state occurs at least once. So maybe during the plan, after moving grey_block_2 and purple_block_1, but then moving them again. The plan doesn't need to maintain that state, just pass through it.

So, maybe the optimal plan is:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1.

2. Stack grey_block_2 on grey_block_1. (But to do this, grey_block_1 must be clear. So first, need to unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1.)

But how?

Alternative approach:

First, unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1 (hold grey_block_2).

Then, unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1 (hold brown_block_1).

Stack grey_block_2 on grey_block_1 → now grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1.

Putdown brown_block_1.

Pickup purple_block_1 and stack on brown_block_1 → constraint met.

Unstack purple_block_1 and putdown.

Proceed to handle yellow_block_1.

But let's write this as steps:

1. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1 → hold g2.

2. putdown g2.

3. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold b1.

4. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 → hold g2.

Wait, no. Wait, after step 2, g2 is on the table. To stack it on grey_block_1, which is now clear (since brown_block_1 was removed in step3).

Wait, step3 is unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1 → which requires that brown_block_1 is clear. But after step1, brown_block_1 is clear (since grey_block_2 was removed). So step3 is possible.

So:

1. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1 → hold g2.

2. putdown g2.

3. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold b1.

4. stack g2 grey_block_1 → requires picking up g2.

But after step3, the arm is holding b1. So step4 is not possible. Need to putdown b1 first.

So:

1. unstack g2 b1 → hold g2.

2. putdown g2.

3. unstack b1 grey_block_1 → hold b1.

4. putdown b1.

5. pickup g2.

6. stack g2 grey_block_1.

7. pickup b1.

8. stack b1 purple_block_1 → no, but we need purple_block_1 on b1. So:

Wait, to get purple_block_1 on b1 (brown_block_1), after step4, b1 is on table. So:

7. pickup purple_block_1.

8. stack purple_block_1 b1 → now purple_block_1 is on brown_block_1, which is on table.

At this point, the constraint is met (g2 on grey_block_1, purple on b1).

Then, unstack purple_block_1 from b1.

9. unstack purple_block_1 b1 → hold purple.

10. putdown purple.

Now, b1 is clear. Then, handle yellow_block_1.

11. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1 → hold y2.

12. putdown y2.

13. pickup y1.

14. stack y1 b1.

That's 14 steps. But maybe there's a way to optimize.

Alternatively, after step8 (stack purple_block_1 on b1), the constraint is met. Then, we can proceed to stack y1 on b1 after moving purple_block_1.

But this seems necessary.

Wait, but perhaps after step6 (stack g2 on grey_block_1), then step7: pickup b1 and stack purple_block_1 on b1.

Wait, no. To stack purple_block_1 on b1, we need to hold purple_block_1 and b1 is clear. So:

After step6: g2 is on grey_block_1. Then:

7. pickup b1 (which is on the table, clear).

8. stack b1 purple_block_1 → now b1 is on purple_block_1, which is not what the constraint needs. The constraint needs purple on b1. So that's incorrect.

So correct approach is:

After step6: grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1. Then:

7. pickup purple_block_1 (clear on table).

8. stack purple_block_1 b1 (which is on the table, clear).

Now, purple_block_1 is on brown_block_1. Then, we can unstack it.

So steps:

1. unstack g2 b1.

2. putdown g2.

3. unstack b1 grey_block_1.

4. putdown b1.

5. pickup g2.

6. stack g2 grey_block_1.

7. pickup purple_block_1.

8. stack purple_block_1 b1.

9. unstack purple_block_1 b1.

10. putdown purple_block_1.

11. unstack y2 y1.

12. putdown y2.

13. pickup y1.

14. stack y1 b1.

That's 14 steps. But earlier approach had 13. Maybe the difference is in when we handle the yellow blocks.

Wait, in the earlier plan where we handle yellow_block_2 first, maybe that can save steps. Let's see:

Alternative plan:

1. unstack y2 y1 → hold y2.

2. putdown y2.

3. unstack g2 b1 → hold g2.

4. putdown g2.

5. unstack b1 grey_block_1 → hold b1.

6. stack g2 grey_block_1 → need to pickup g2 first.

After step5, holding b1. So:

6. putdown b1.

7. pickup g2.

8. stack g2 grey_block_1.

9. pickup purple_block_1.

10. stack purple_block_1 b1.

11. unstack purple_block_1 b1.

12. putdown purple_block_1.

13. pickup y1.

14. stack y1 b1.

Total steps: 14.

But if we handle the yellow_block_2 first, perhaps we can interleave some steps.

Another approach: When handling the constraint, perhaps the steps to meet it can be part of the main plan.

For example:

- After moving grey_block_2 and brown_block_1, stack grey_block_2 on grey_block_1 and purple_block_1 on brown_block_1, then immediately unstack purple_block_1 and proceed.

But regardless, the steps needed to meet the constraint and then achieve the goal seem to require around 14 steps. However, the problem states that the plan must be optimal, so the shortest possible.

Is there a way to have a shorter plan?

Let me think again.

The goal is to have yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1. The current state of brown_block_1 has grey_block_2 on it. So to free brown_block_1, we need to move grey_block_2. But also, the constraint requires that at some point, grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1 and purple_block_1 is on brown_block_1.

So perhaps after moving grey_block_2 to grey_block_1 and putting purple_block_1 on brown_block_1, we can leave purple_block_1 there and place yellow_block_1 on top of it. But the goal requires yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1, not on purple_block_1. So that's not possible.

Wait, no. The goal is yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1. So even if purple_block_1 is on brown_block_1 in a previous step, we need to remove it to place yellow_block_1 directly on brown_block_1.

Alternatively, perhaps we can stack yellow_block_1 on top of purple_block_1 which is on brown_block_1, but that would not satisfy the goal.

So, the steps seem necessary.

Let me try to write the optimal plan.

The shortest possible plan I can think of is:

1. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1

2. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1

But to stack grey_block_2 on grey_block_1, grey_block_1 must be clear. But grey_block_1 has brown_block_1 on it. So first, need to unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1. But brown_block_1 is under grey_block_2, so need to unstack grey_block_2 first.

Thus:

1. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1 → holding g2.

2. putdown g2.

3. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1 → holding b1.

4. stack g2 grey_block_1 → need to pick up g2 again.

But after step3, the arm is holding b1, so step4 is impossible. Thus, steps must be:

1. unstack g2 b1 → hold g2.

2. putdown g2.

3. unstack b1 grey_block_1 → hold b1.

4. putdown b1.

5. pickup g2.

6. stack g2 grey_block_1.

7. pickup purple_block_1.

8. stack purple_block_1 b1.

9. unstack purple_block_1 b1 → hold purple.

10. putdown purple.

11. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1 → hold y2.

12. putdown y2.

13. pickup yellow_block_1.

14. stack yellow_block_1 b1.

This is 14 steps. But is there a way to shorten this?

Wait, after step6 (grey_block_2 is stacked on grey_block_1), step7 is pickup purple_block_1 and stack on b1 (which is on the table). So steps7 and 8 are necessary.

But after step8, purple_block_1 is on b1, satisfying the constraint. Then steps9 and 10 to remove it. Then steps11-14 to place y1 on b1.

But what if instead of putting down purple_block_1 after unstacking, we stack it somewhere else? Not helpful.

Alternatively, after step8 (purple_block_1 on b1), can we directly unstack it and use the arm to pickup y1, but y1 is under y2.

Another idea: Can we move yellow_block_2 and y1 earlier in the plan?

For example:

1. unstack y2 y1 → hold y2.

2. putdown y2.

3. unstack g2 b1 → hold g2.

4. stack g2 grey_block_1 → but grey_block_1 has b1 on it. So can't do this yet.

No, need to first unstack b1 from grey_block_1.

So:

1. unstack y2 y1 → hold y2.

2. putdown y2.

3. unstack g2 b1 → hold g2.

4. putdown g2.

5. unstack b1 grey_block_1 → hold b1.

6. stack g2 grey_block_1.

7. putdown b1.

8. pickup purple_block_1.

9. stack purple_block_1 b1.

10. unstack purple_block_1 b1 → hold purple.

11. putdown purple.

12. pickup y1.

13. stack y1 b1.

This would be 13 steps. Wait, but after step5, we're holding b1. Then step6 requires picking up g2. So this sequence is not possible.

Wait, no. After step5, we're holding b1. To stack g2 on grey_block_1, we need to put down b1 first.

So:

After step5:

6. putdown b1.

7. pickup g2.

8. stack g2 grey_block_1.

9. pickup purple_block_1.

10. stack purple_block_1 b1.

11. unstack purple_block_1 b1 → hold purple.

12. putdown purple.

13. pickup y1.

14. stack y1 b1.

That's 14 steps. Including the initial steps of moving y2.

But this is the same as before. So perhaps the minimal plan is 14 steps. But the problem asks for an optimal plan, which may be shorter.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. For example, after moving grey_block_2 to grey_block_1 and putting purple_block_1 on brown_block_1, can we use the same steps to place y1 on brown_block_1 without moving purple_block_1 again? No, because the goal requires y1 directly on brown_block_1.

Alternatively, maybe during the process of moving purple_block_1 onto brown_block_1, we can have y1 on top of purple_block_1, but that doesn't satisfy the goal.

Alternatively, after placing purple_block_1 on brown_block_1 (step8), can we stack y1 on purple_block_1? But the goal is to have y1 on brown_block_1. So that's not allowed.

Another thought: What if we don't put down brown_block_1 after unstacking it from grey_block_1, but instead stack it on purple_block_1. Then, purple_block_1 would be under brown_block_1. But the constraint requires purple_block_1 on brown_block_1. So that's the opposite.

So perhaps the initial steps are unavoidable.

Given that, the minimal plan likely has 14 steps. But perhaps I'm missing a smarter way.

Wait, what if after step3 (unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1), instead of putting it down, we stack it somewhere else to avoid extra steps. For example:

After step3: holding brown_block_1.

Step4: stack brown_block_1 purple_block_1. But this would put brown_block_1 on purple_block_1. Then, to get purple_block_1 on brown_block_1, we need to swap them. But that would require more steps.

Alternatively, after step3, we can stack brown_block_1 onto yellow_block_1, but yellow_block_1 has yellow_block_2 on it. So we need to move yellow_block_2 first.

But this is getting too convoluted.

I think the minimal plan requires 14 actions, but perhaps there's a way to reduce it. Let's check the sample steps again.

Wait, in the initial plan where we first unstack yellow_block_2:

1. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1 → hold y2.

2. putdown y2.

3. unstack g2 b1 → hold g2.

4. stack g2 grey_block_1 → but grey_block_1 has b1 on it. So this is impossible. So we need to unstack b1 from grey_block_1 first.

Thus, after step3, putdown g2.

4. unstack b1 grey_block_1 → hold b1.

5. stack g2 grey_block_1 → need to pickup g2.

But after step4, holding b1. So need to putdown b1 first.

5. putdown b1.

6. pickup g2.

7. stack g2 grey_block_1.

8. pickup purple_block_1.

9. stack purple_block_1 b1.

10. unstack purple_block_1 b1 → hold purple.

11. putdown purple.

12. pickup y1.

13. stack y1 b1.

This gives 13 steps. Wait, steps:

1. unstack y2 y1 → hold y2.

2. putdown y2.

3. unstack g2 b1 → hold g2.

4. putdown g2.

5. unstack b1 grey_block_1 → hold b1.

6. putdown b1.

7. pickup g2.

8. stack g2 grey_block_1.

9. pickup purple_block_1.

10. stack purple_block_1 b1.

11. unstack purple_block_1 b1 → hold purple.

12. putdown purple.

13. pickup y1.

14. stack y1 b1.

But this is 14 steps. Because step1-14.

Alternatively, after step5 (holding b1), can we stack purple_block_1 on b1 directly?

After step5: holding b1.

6. stack purple_block_1 b1 → but purple_block_1 is on the table. To stack purple_block_1 onto b1, we need to hold purple_block_1. So this is impossible.

Hmm. No. So steps are still required.

Another angle: Can we avoid putting down grey_block_2 and brown_block_1 multiple times?

After unstacking grey_block_2 from brown_block_1 (step1), instead of putting it down, can we stack it directly on grey_block_1? But grey_block_1 has brown_block_1 on it, so grey_block_1 is not clear. So no.

Thus, the steps seem unavoidable.

Therefore, the optimal plan likely has 14 steps. But I need to ensure that each action's preconditions are met.

Let me verify each step:

1. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1

Preconditions: yellow_block_2 is on yellow_block_1, clear, arm empty. Yes.

Effect: arm holds y2.

2. putdown yellow_block_2

Preconditions: holding y2. Yes.

Effect: y2 on table, arm empty.

3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1

Preconditions: grey_block_2 is on brown_block_1, clear, arm empty. Yes.

Effect: arm holds grey_block_2.

4. putdown grey_block_2

Preconditions: holding grey_block_2. Yes.

Effect: grey_block_2 on table, arm empty.

5. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1

Preconditions: brown_block_1 is on grey_block_1, clear (since grey_block_2 was removed), arm empty. Yes.

Effect: arm holds brown_block_1.

6. putdown brown_block_1

Preconditions: holding brown_block_1. Yes.

Effect: brown_block_1 on table, arm empty.

7. pickup grey_block_2

Preconditions: grey_block_2 on table, clear, arm empty. Yes.

Effect: arm holds grey_block_2.

8. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1

Preconditions: holding grey_block_2, grey_block_1 is clear (after brown_block_1 was removed). Yes.

Effect: grey_block_2 on grey_block_1, arm empty.

9. pickup purple_block_1

Preconditions: purple_block_1 on table, clear, arm empty. Yes.

Effect: arm holds purple_block_1.

10. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1

Preconditions: holding purple_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear (on table). Yes.

Effect: purple_block_1 on brown_block_1, arm empty.

11. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1

Preconditions: purple_block_1 on brown_block_1, clear, arm empty. Yes.

Effect: arm holds purple_block_1.

12. putdown purple_block_1

Preconditions: holding purple_block_1. Yes.

Effect: purple_block_1 on table, arm empty.

13. pickup yellow_block_1

Preconditions: yellow_block_1 on table, clear (since y2 was removed), arm empty. Yes.

Effect: arm holds yellow_block_1.

14. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1

Preconditions: holding yellow_block_1, brown_block_1 clear (after purple_block_1 was removed). Yes.

Effect: yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1, arm empty.

This satisfies all preconditions and effects. So this is a valid plan of 14 steps.

But the problem says to provide an optimal plan, which may be shorter. However, I can't find a shorter path. Therefore, this is likely the optimal plan.
