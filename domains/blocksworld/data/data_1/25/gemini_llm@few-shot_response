Okay, let's break this down. We need to get yellow_block_1 on top of brown_block_1. Currently, yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1, and brown_block_1 has grey_block_2 on top of it. We also have a constraint that at some point purple_block_1 must be on brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 must be on grey_block_1.

Here's the plan:

1.  Clear brown_block_1: unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1, putdown grey_block_2
2.  Clear purple_block_1: unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1, putdown yellow_block_2
3.  Move yellow_block_1 to the table: unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1, putdown yellow_block_1
4.  Move purple_block_1 to brown_block_1: pickup purple_block_1, stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1 (Constraint part 1 satisfied)
5.  Move grey_block_2 to grey_block_1: pickup grey_block_2, stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 (Constraint part 2 satisfied)
6.  Move yellow_block_1 to brown_block_1: pickup yellow_block_1, stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1 (Goal satisfied)

```
```
unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
putdown grey_block_2
unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
putdown yellow_block_2
unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
putdown yellow_block_1
pickup purple_block_1
stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
pickup grey_block_2
stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
pickup yellow_block_1
stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1
```
