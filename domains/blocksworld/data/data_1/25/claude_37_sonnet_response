Alright, so we have a Blocksworld problem. Let's first understand the current state of the world and the goal state, and then plan a sequence of actions to reach the goal state while respecting the constraints.

**Current State:**
1. grey_block_1 is on the table
2. brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
3. purple_block_1 is on the table
4. yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1
5. grey_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1
6. yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1
7. purple_block_2 is on the table
8. grey_block_2 is clear
9. yellow_block_2 is clear
10. purple_block_2 is clear
11. The arm is not holding any block

Visually, we have:
```
     grey_block_2     yellow_block_2     purple_block_2
         |                  |                  |
   brown_block_1      yellow_block_1
         |                  |
   grey_block_1       purple_block_1
         |                  |
     TABLE            TABLE            TABLE
```

**Goal State:**
1. yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1

**Constraint:**
1. At some point in the plan, the following conditions must all be true:
   - purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
   - grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1

Let's start planning:

First, let's identify what needs to change for us to reach the goal state:
1. yellow_block_1 needs to be moved from on top of purple_block_1 to on top of brown_block_1
2. But brown_block_1 currently has grey_block_2 on top of it, so grey_block_2 needs to be removed first.

Additionally, to satisfy the constraint, at some point during our plan, purple_block_1 should be on top of brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 should be on top of grey_block_1.

Given the constraint, we'd need to:
1. Remove yellow_block_2 from on top of yellow_block_1
2. Move yellow_block_1 from on top of purple_block_1 to a temporary location (the table or on top of purple_block_2, for example)
3. Move grey_block_2 from on top of brown_block_1 to on top of grey_block_1 (to satisfy part of the constraint)
4. Move purple_block_1 to on top of brown_block_1 (to satisfy the other part of the constraint)
5. Move purple_block_1 back to its original position or somewhere else
6. Place yellow_block_1 on top of brown_block_1 (to satisfy the goal)

Let's implement this plan step by step:

Step 1: Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1
Preconditions:
- yellow_block_2 is clear (true)
- The arm is not holding any block (true)
Effects:
- The arm is holding yellow_block_2
- yellow_block_1 is clear

Step 2: Putdown yellow_block_2 on the table
Preconditions:
- The arm is holding yellow_block_2 (true after Step 1)
Effects:
- yellow_block_2 is on the table
- yellow_block_2 is clear
- The arm is not holding any block

Step 3: Unstack yellow_block_1 from purple_block_1
Preconditions:
- yellow_block_1 is clear (true after Step 1)
- The arm is not holding any block (true after Step 2)
Effects:
- The arm is holding yellow_block_1
- purple_block_1 is clear

Step 4: Putdown yellow_block_1 on the table
Preconditions:
- The arm is holding yellow_block_1 (true after Step 3)
Effects:
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- The arm is not holding any block

Step 5: Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1
Preconditions:
- grey_block_2 is clear (true)
- The arm is not holding any block (true after Step 4)
Effects:
- The arm is holding grey_block_2
- brown_block_1 is clear

Step 6: Stack grey_block_2 on grey_block_1
Preconditions:
- The arm is holding grey_block_2 (true after Step 5)
- grey_block_1 is clear (false currently since brown_block_1 is on top of it)

Wait, we have a problem here. grey_block_1 is not clear because brown_block_1 is on top of it. We need to modify our plan.

Let's go back to our visual representation and rethink:

```
     grey_block_2     yellow_block_2     purple_block_2
         |                  |                  |
   brown_block_1      yellow_block_1
         |                  |
   grey_block_1       purple_block_1
         |                  |
     TABLE            TABLE            TABLE
```

To satisfy the constraint:
- We need to move grey_block_2 to on top of grey_block_1
- And purple_block_1 to on top of brown_block_1

But brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1. We need to:
1. Move grey_block_2 from on top of brown_block_1 to somewhere else
2. Move brown_block_1 from on top of grey_block_1 to somewhere else
3. Stack grey_block_2 on top of grey_block_1
4. Move purple_block_1 to on top of brown_block_1

But then we'd need to move purple_block_1 away and place yellow_block_1 on top of brown_block_1 to satisfy the goal.

Let's rethink our approach:

1. Remove yellow_block_2 from on top of yellow_block_1
2. Move yellow_block_1 from on top of purple_block_1 to a temporary location
3. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1
4. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1
5. Stack grey_block_2 on top of grey_block_1 (to satisfy part of the constraint)
6. Stack purple_block_1 on top of brown_block_1 (to satisfy the other part of the constraint)
7. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_1
8. Stack yellow_block_1 on top of brown_block_1 (to satisfy the goal)

Let's implement this revised plan:

Step 1: Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1
Preconditions:
- yellow_block_2 is clear (true)
- The arm is not holding any block (true)
Effects:
- The arm is holding yellow_block_2
- yellow_block_1 is clear

Step 2: Putdown yellow_block_2 on the table
Preconditions:
- The arm is holding yellow_block_2 (true after Step 1)
Effects:
- yellow_block_2 is on the table
- yellow_block_2 is clear
- The arm is not holding any block

Step 3: Unstack yellow_block_1 from purple_block_1
Preconditions:
- yellow_block_1 is clear (true after Step 1)
- The arm is not holding any block (true after Step 2)
Effects:
- The arm is holding yellow_block_1
- purple_block_1 is clear

Step 4: Putdown yellow_block_1 on the table
Preconditions:
- The arm is holding yellow_block_1 (true after Step 3)
Effects:
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- The arm is not holding any block

Step 5: Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1
Preconditions:
- grey_block_2 is clear (true)
- The arm is not holding any block (true after Step 4)
Effects:
- The arm is holding grey_block_2
- brown_block_1 is clear

Step 6: Putdown grey_block_2 on the table
Preconditions:
- The arm is holding grey_block_2 (true after Step 5)
Effects:
- grey_block_2 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is clear
- The arm is not holding any block

Step 7: Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1
Preconditions:
- brown_block_1 is clear (true after Step 5)
- The arm is not holding any block (true after Step 6)
Effects:
- The arm is holding brown_block_1
- grey_block_1 is clear

Step 8: Putdown brown_block_1 on the table
Preconditions:
- The arm is holding brown_block_1 (true after Step 7)
Effects:
- brown_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is clear
- The arm is not holding any block

Step 9: Pickup grey_block_2 from the table
Preconditions:
- grey_block_2 is clear (true after Step 6)
- grey_block_2 is on the table (true after Step 6)
- The arm is not holding any block (true after Step 8)
Effects:
- The arm is holding grey_block_2
- grey_block_2 is not on the table

Step 10: Stack grey_block_2 on top of grey_block_1
Preconditions:
- The arm is holding grey_block_2 (true after Step 9)
- grey_block_1 is clear (true after Step 7)
Effects:
- grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1
- grey_block_2 is clear
- grey_block_1 is not clear
- The arm is not holding any block

Step 11: Pickup purple_block_1 from the table
Preconditions:
- purple_block_1 is clear (true after Step 3)
- purple_block_1 is on the table (true from initial state)
- The arm is not holding any block (true after Step 10)
Effects:
- The arm is holding purple_block_1
- purple_block_1 is not on the table

Step 12: Stack purple_block_1 on top of brown_block_1
Preconditions:
- The arm is holding purple_block_1 (true after Step 11)
- brown_block_1 is clear (true after Step 8)
Effects:
- purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
- purple_block_1 is clear
- brown_block_1 is not clear
- The arm is not holding any block

At this point, the constraint is satisfied: purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1.

Now we need to move purple_block_1 away and place yellow_block_1 on top of brown_block_1:

Step 13: Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_1
Preconditions:
- purple_block_1 is clear (true after Step 12)
- The arm is not holding any block (true after Step 12)
Effects:
- The arm is holding purple_block_1
- brown_block_1 is clear

Step 14: Putdown purple_block_1 on the table
Preconditions:
- The arm is holding purple_block_1 (true after Step 13)
Effects:
- purple_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is clear
- The arm is not holding any block

Step 15: Pickup yellow_block_1 from the table
Preconditions:
- yellow_block_1 is clear (true after Step 4)
- yellow_block_1 is on the table (true after Step 4)
- The arm is not holding any block (true after Step 14)
Effects:
- The arm is holding yellow_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is not on the table

Step 16: Stack yellow_block_1 on top of brown_block_1
Preconditions:
- The arm is holding yellow_block_1 (true after Step 15)
- brown_block_1 is clear (true after Step 13)
Effects:
- yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- brown_block_1 is not clear
- The arm is not holding any block

With Step 16, we've achieved the goal: yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1.

Let's list the plan:

1. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_2
3. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1
5. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
6. putdown grey_block_2
7. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
8. putdown brown_block_1
9. pickup grey_block_2
10. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
11. pickup purple_block_1
12. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
13. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
14. putdown purple_block_1
15. pickup yellow_block_1
16. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1

Wait, I might have missed something. Let me check if there's a more optimal plan.

One consideration: Maybe we could have moved yellow_block_1 to brown_block_1 directly after satisfying the constraint, without putting purple_block_1 back on the table. let me check:

After Step 12, we have:
- purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
- grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1

And the constraint is satisfied. Now, we need to replace purple_block_1 with yellow_block_1.

Step 13: Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_1
Preconditions:
- purple_block_1 is clear (true after Step 12)
- The arm is not holding any block (true after Step 12)
Effects:
- The arm is holding purple_block_1
- brown_block_1 is clear

But now, we can't directly stack yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1 because we're holding purple_block_1. We need to put down purple_block_1 first. So the steps are correct.

So, our optimal plan remains as stated.

Actually, let's see if there's a way to combine some steps here.

From our initial state, we have:
```
     grey_block_2     yellow_block_2     purple_block_2
         |                  |                  |
   brown_block_1      yellow_block_1
         |                  |
   grey_block_1       purple_block_1
         |                  |
     TABLE            TABLE            TABLE
```

We want to satisfy the constraint:
- purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
- grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1

And the goal:
- yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1

To put grey_block_2 on grey_block_1, we need to:
1. Remove grey_block_2 from brown_block_1
2. Remove brown_block_1 from grey_block_1
3. Put grey_block_2 on grey_block_1

To put purple_block_1 on brown_block_1, we need:
1. Remove yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1
2. Remove yellow_block_1 from purple_block_1
3. Free up brown_block_1 (which we've already done)
4. Put purple_block_1 on brown_block_1

To put yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1, we need:
1. Remove purple_block_1 from brown_block_1
2. Put yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1

It seems like the sequence of steps we outlined is the most direct way to achieve both the constraint and the goal. I don't see a way to further optimize the plan, so the list of 16 steps I provided earlier remains our optimal plan.

Actually, I think there's one step that's not optimal in the sense of minimizing the number of actions. After Steps 5 and 6, we've moved grey_block_2 to the table. Then in Steps 9 and 10, we pick it up again to stack it on grey_block_1. We might be able to optimize a bit by stacking grey_block_2 directly on grey_block_1 after unstacking it from brown_block_1. But the issue is that grey_block_1 is not clear at that point; it has brown_block_1 on top of it.

Actually, checking the state again, the plan as presented is correct as is. So our optimal plan is:

1. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_2
3. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1
5. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
6. putdown grey_block_2
7. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
8. putdown brown_block_1
9. pickup grey_block_2
10. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
11. pickup purple_block_1
12. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
13. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
14. putdown purple_block_1
15. pickup yellow_block_1
16. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1

Actually, let me calculate the minimum number of steps needed to achieve our goal and constraint. this should help us check if our solution is optimal:

1. To satisfy the constraint:
   - grey_block_2 needs to be on grey_block_1
   - purple_block_1 needs to be on brown_block_1

2. To satisfy the goal:
   - yellow_block_1 needs to be on brown_block_1

To move grey_block_2 to grey_block_1:
   - Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1 (1 step)
   - Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1 (1 step)
   - Stack grey_block_2 on grey_block_1 (1 step)
   Total: 3 steps (plus we might need to temporarily putdown blocks, which would add more steps)

To move purple_block_1 to brown_block_1:
   - Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1 (1 step)
   - Unstack yellow_block_1 from purple_block_1 (1 step)
   - Stack purple_block_1 on brown_block_1 (1 step)
   Total: 3 steps (plus putdowns)

To move yellow_block_1 to brown_block_1:
   - Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_1 (1 step)
   - Stack yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1 (1 step)
   Total: 2 steps (plus putdowns)

So, in the most optimal case, we'd need at least 8 unstack/stack operations. But, because we can only hold one block at a time and have to respect the constraints, we also need putdown operations. so the plan should be atleast 8 + putdowns steps long.

I think our plan is fairly optimal. Let's double-check it:

1. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1 (1 unstack)
2. putdown yellow_block_2 (1 putdown)
3. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1 (1 unstack)
4. putdown yellow_block_1 (1 putdown)
5. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1 (1 unstack)
6. putdown grey_block_2 (1 putdown)
7. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1 (1 unstack)
8. putdown brown_block_1 (1 putdown)
9. pickup grey_block_2 (1 pickup)
10. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 (1 stack)
11. pickup purple_block_1 (1 pickup)
12. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1 (1 stack)
13. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1 (1 unstack)
14. putdown purple_block_1 (1 putdown)
15. pickup yellow_block_1 (1 pickup)
16. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1 (1 stack)

That's 6 unstacks, 5 putdowns, 3 pickups, and 3 stacks, for a total of 16 steps. I don't see an obvious way to reduce this further given the constraints of the problem. So, our plan of 16 steps as provided earlier is our optimal solution.

Actually, now that I think about it, I'm not sure if our plan is optimal. Let's see if there's a more direct path.

Let me try to visualize the state transitions better:

Initial State:
```
     grey_block_2     yellow_block_2     purple_block_2
         |                  |                  |
   brown_block_1      yellow_block_1
         |                  |
   grey_block_1       purple_block_1
         |                  |
     TABLE            TABLE            TABLE
```

Intermediate State (Constraint Satisfied):
```
   grey_block_2      purple_block_1      yellow_block_2    purple_block_2    yellow_block_1
         |                  |                  |                 |                 |
   grey_block_1       brown_block_1
         |                  |
     TABLE             TABLE               TABLE            TABLE            TABLE
```

Goal State:
```
   grey_block_2      yellow_block_1      yellow_block_2    purple_block_2    purple_block_1
         |                  |                  |                 |                 |
   grey_block_1       brown_block_1
         |                  |
     TABLE             TABLE               TABLE            TABLE            TABLE
```

Now, let's try to come up with the most direct path from the initial state to the intermediate state (constraint satisfied), and then to the goal state.

Let's start again from scratch.

**Initial State:**
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- purple_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1
- grey_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1
- purple_block_2 is on the table
- grey_block_2, yellow_block_2, and purple_block_2 are clear
- The arm is not holding any block

**Constraint to Satisfy (Intermediate State):**
- purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
- grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1

**Goal State:**
- yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1

Path to Intermediate State (Constraint Satisfied):

We need to clear the path for grey_block_2 to be on top of grey_block_1 and for purple_block_1 to be on top of brown_block_1.

1. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1
2. Putdown yellow_block_2
3. Unstack yellow_block_1 from purple_block_1
4. Putdown yellow_block_1
5. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1
6. Putdown grey_block_2
7. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1
8. Putdown brown_block_1
9. Pickup grey_block_2
10. Stack grey_block_2 on grey_block_1
11. Pickup purple_block_1
12. Stack purple_block_1 on brown_block_1

At this point, the constraint is satisfied.

Path from Intermediate State to Goal State:

1. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_1
2. Putdown purple_block_1
3. Pickup yellow_block_1
4. Stack yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1

The total plan is the concatenation of both:

1. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_2
3. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1
5. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
6. putdown grey_block_2
7. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
8. putdown brown_block_1
9. pickup grey_block_2
10. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
11. pickup purple_block_1
12. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
13. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
14. putdown purple_block_1
15. pickup yellow_block_1
16. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1

This is the same plan I had before, which makes me more confident that it's optimal.

Let's check one more time: is there any way to reduce the number of steps? 

Let's think if there are any operations we can skip or combine:

1. Can we avoid moving yellow_block_2 and yellow_block_1 initially? No, because we need to free up purple_block_1 to satisfy the constraint.
2. Can we avoid moving grey_block_2 to the table (steps 5-6) and then picking it up again (step 9)? No, because we need to access grey_block_1, which is below brown_block_1, which is below grey_block_2.
3. Can we avoid moving brown_block_1 to the table (steps 7-8)? No, because it's on top of grey_block_1 and we need to put grey_block_2 on top of grey_block_1.
4. Can we avoid moving purple_block_1 to brown_block_1 and then removing it? No, because we need to satisfy the constraint before achieving the goal.

It seems like the plan we have is already as optimized as it can be, given the constraints of the problem.

Let me just double-check one more thing: Before stacking grey_block_2 on grey_block_1, we've already unstacked brown_block_1 from grey_block_1. So grey_block_1 is clear at this point. This is correct.

Alright, our final optimal plan is:

1. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_2
3. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1
5. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
6. putdown grey_block_2
7. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
8. putdown brown_block_1
9. pickup grey_block_2
10. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
11. pickup purple_block_1
12. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
13. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
14. putdown purple_block_1
15. pickup yellow_block_1
16. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1

Hmm. Actually, just to be sure. Let me try one more time to see if there's any way to reduce the steps.

Here's the intial state again:

```
     grey_block_2     yellow_block_2     purple_block_2
         |                  |                  |
   brown_block_1      yellow_block_1
         |                  |
   grey_block_1       purple_block_1
         |                  |
     TABLE            TABLE            TABLE
```

Constraint:
- purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
- grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1

Goal State:
- yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1


Wait, there is a subtle issue here. When we place grey_block_2 on grey_block_1 and purple_block_1 on brown_block_1, if we had placed brown_block_1 back on the table, we can actually reuse step 1-8, which involve clearing purple_block_1 and moving brown_block_1 on the table.

Let me restate the minimal path to satisfy the constraint as clearly as possible:

1. First, we need to free grey_block_1 from beneath brown_block_1 and grey_block_2.
2. Then, we need to stack grey_block_2 on top of grey_block_1.
3. Then, we need to stack purple_block_1 on top of brown_block_1 (which, by this point, is already on the table).

Steps 1-8 above accomplish the first goal, steps 9-10 accomplish the second, and steps 11-12 accomplish the third.

After satisfying the constraint, we need to move yellow_block_1 to brown_block_1, which requires removing purple_block_1 first. That's steps 13-16.

There's no redundancy in this, so the 16-step plan is indeed optimal.

Actually, since our goal state is to just have yellow_block_1 on top of brown_block_1, rather then ending up with:

```
   grey_block_2      yellow_block_1      yellow_block_2    purple_block_2    purple_block_1
         |                  |                  |                 |                 |
   grey_block_1       brown_block_1
         |                  |
     TABLE             TABLE               TABLE            TABLE            TABLE
```

We don't care what happens to grey_block_1 and grey_block_2 after we've used them to satisfy the constraint.

Hmm, let me think a bit. Actually, the constraint says "The following expression must hold in at least one state...", which we interpret as "at some point in the execution, the constraint must be true, but it doesn't have to remain true".

Initially, we have:
```
     grey_block_2     yellow_block_2     purple_block_2
         |                  |                  |
   brown_block_1      yellow_block_1
         |                  |
   grey_block_1       purple_block_1
         |                  |
     TABLE            TABLE            TABLE
```

Constraint Satisfied State:
```
   grey_block_2      purple_block_1      yellow_block_2    purple_block_2    yellow_block_1
         |                  |                  |                 |                 |
   grey_block_1       brown_block_1
         |                  |
     TABLE             TABLE               TABLE            TABLE            TABLE
```

Goal State:
```
   grey_block_2      yellow_block_1      yellow_block_2    purple_block_2    purple_block_1
         |                  |                  |                 |                 |
   grey_block_1       brown_block_1
         |                  |
     TABLE             TABLE               TABLE            TABLE            TABLE
```

When we reach the "Constraint Satisfied State" and are about to execute steps 13-16, could we avoid having to move purple_block_1 to the table first? Let's check.

Step 13: Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_1
After this, the arm is holding purple_block_1.

Step 15: Pickup yellow_block_1
But we can't do this immediately after step 13 because the arm is already holding purple_block_1. So it seems like we do need to putdown purple_block_1 before we can pickup yellow_block_1.

Actually, since purple_block_1 and brown_block_1 are both on the table in the initial state, we technically don't have to pickup brown_block_1 at any point. We can just stack purple_block_1 on top of brown_block_1 and then replace it with yellow_block_1.

So, given the arm's constraint of holding only one block at a time, our 16-step plan does seem optimal.

To be sure, let me compare our 16-step plan to what we would do if we were unconstrained (i.e., what's the absolute minimum number of steps needed to go from the initial state to the goal state).

In an unconstrained scenario, to get yellow_block_1 on top of brown_block_1, we would need to:
1. Remove yellow_block_2 from on top of yellow_block_1.
2. Remove yellow_block_1 from on top of purple_block_1.
3. Remove grey_block_2 from on top of brown_block_1.
4. Stack yellow_block_1 on top of brown_block_1.

That's 4 operations. But we also need to satisfy the constraint, which means we need to have grey_block_2 on top of grey_block_1 and purple_block_1 on top of brown_block_1 at some point.

These additional operations are:
1. Remove brown_block_1 from on top of grey_block_1.
2. Stack grey_block_2 on top of grey_block_1.
3. Stack purple_block_1 on top of brown_block_1.
4. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_1.

That's 4 more operations, bringing us to 8 operations in an unconstrained scenario.

In our actual scenario, we also have to putdown blocks we've unstacked because the arm can only hold one block at a time. Let's count:
- In the unconstrained scenario, we had 4 unstack operations (removing blocks from other blocks). After each unstack, we would need a putdown, giving us 4 putdowns.
- We also had 2 stack operations (moving blocks onto blocks). Before each stack, we would need a pickup, giving us 2 pickups.
- We had 2 more unstack operations for the constraint. After each, we'd need a putdown, giving us 2 more putdowns.

That's 4 unstacks + 4 putdowns + 2 stacks + 2 pickups + 2 unstacks + 2 putdowns = 16 operations, which aligns with our 16-step plan.

So, our 16-step plan is indeed optimal:

1. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_2
3. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1
5. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
6. putdown grey_block_2
7. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
8. putdown brown_block_1
9. pickup grey_block_2
10. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
11. pickup purple_block_1
12. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
13. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
14. putdown purple_block_1
15. pickup yellow_block_1
16. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1
