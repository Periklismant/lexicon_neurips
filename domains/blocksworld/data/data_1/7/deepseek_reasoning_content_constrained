Okay, let's see. I need to figure out a plan to get red_block_2 onto the table while satisfying the constraints. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the goal.

The initial state has several blocks stacked. Let me list them out:

- black_block_1 is on the table with white_block_1 on top, then black_block_2 on top of white_block_1. And black_block_2 is clear.
- red_block_1 is on the table with white_block_2 on top, then red_block_2 on top of white_block_2, and orange_block_1 on top of red_block_2. Orange_block_1 is clear.

The goal is to have red_block_2 on the table. So, red_block_2 is currently on white_block_2, which is on red_block_1. To get red_block_2 to the table, I need to move it down. But there's orange_block_1 on top of red_block_2. So first, I need to remove orange_block_1.

Constraints: At some point, orange_block_1 must be on the table. Also, whenever orange_block_1 is on the table, there must have been an earlier state where either red_block_1 is clear or I was holding white_block_2.

Wait, the constraint is that if orange_block_1 is on the table in some state, then in an earlier state, either red_block_1 is clear or I was holding white_block_2. So to satisfy this, when I put orange_block_1 on the table, I need to ensure that before that, either red_block_1 was clear or I had white_block_2 in hand.

Let me outline the steps. To get red_block_2 on the table:

1. Remove orange_block_1 from red_block_2. Since orange_block_1 is clear, I can unstack it. So unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2. Then put it down. But putting it down would satisfy the constraint that orange_block_1 is on the table at some point. But I need to check the other part of the constraint: when I put orange_block_1 on the table, the prior state must have had red_block_1 clear or holding white_block_2.

Wait, when I unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2, I would be holding orange_block_1. Then I put it down. So the putdown action would make orange_block_1 on the table. At that point, the constraint is that in the state where orange_block_1 is on the table (after putdown), there must have been a prior state where either red_block_1 was clear or I was holding white_block_2.

But when I unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2, before that, what's the state? The initial state has red_block_1 with white_block_2 on top, which has red_block_2 and then orange_block_1. So red_block_1 is not clear initially. So if I unstack orange_block_1, then before that, red_block_1 was not clear. So after unstacking orange_block_1, I hold it, and then put it down. At that point, the constraint is satisfied because orange_block_1 is on the table, and in the prior step (when I unstacked orange_block_1), was there a state where either red_block_1 was clear or I was holding white_block_2?

Wait, when I unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2, the preconditions are that orange_block_1 is on red_block_2, which it is, and that the arm is empty. After unstacking, I hold orange_block_1, and red_block_2 becomes clear. Then I put it down. So in the state where orange_block_1 is on the table (after putdown), the prior state (during the unstack action) didn't have me holding white_block_2, and red_block_1 was not clear. So that violates the constraint.

Therefore, putting orange_block_1 on the table directly after unstacking might not satisfy the constraint. Because the constraint requires that in the state where orange_block_1 is on the table, there must have been an earlier state where either red_block_1 was clear or I was holding white_block_2. But in the process of unstacking orange_block_1 and putting it down, the prior states don't meet that condition.

So maybe I need to first create a situation where either red_block_1 is clear or I hold white_block_2 before moving orange_block_1.

Let's see. Let me think of another approach.

Alternatively, maybe after moving orange_block_1, but to satisfy the constraint, before putting orange_block_1 on the table, I need to have a state where red_block_1 is clear or I hold white_block_2.

Wait, the constraint is: if in any state S, orange_block_1 is on the table, then there exists a state before S where either red_block_1 is clear or I was holding white_block_2.

So suppose I first do something that causes red_block_1 to be clear. How can I make red_block_1 clear? Because initially, white_block_2 is on red_block_1. To make red_block_1 clear, I need to remove white_block_2. But white_block_2 is under red_block_2 and orange_block_1. So to remove white_block_2, I need to first remove everything on top of it. That is, remove orange_block_1 and red_block_2 from white_block_2. But that's part of the process of getting red_block_2 on the table. So maybe the steps would be:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. Then put it down. But as before, this would require that when I put orange_block_1 down, the prior state (unstack) must have met the condition. But during the unstack, red_block_1 is not clear (since white_block_2 is still on it), and I'm not holding white_block_2. So that would not satisfy the constraint.

Alternatively, maybe I need to first move white_block_2. But white_block_2 is under red_block_2. So to move white_block_2, I need to unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. But red_block_2 is under orange_block_1. So first, I have to remove orange_block_1. Which brings me back to the same problem.

Wait, this seems like a loop. Let me try to outline the steps again:

Goal: red_block_2 on table.

Current stack for red_block_2: red_block_1 has white_block_2, which has red_block_2, which has orange_block_1. So to get red_block_2 down, I need to remove orange_block_1 first. Then unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2, then put it down.

So steps:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. This requires that orange_block_1 is clear (it is) and the arm is empty (it is). After this, I'm holding orange_block_1, and red_block_2 is clear.

2. Then putdown orange_block_1. Now orange_block_1 is on the table. But according to the constraint, this action (putdown) results in orange_block_1 on the table. So in the state after putdown, we need to check if there was a prior state where red_block_1 was clear or I held white_block_2.

But when did that happen? The prior state was step 1 (unstack), during which red_block_1 was not clear (still has white_block_2 on it), and I wasn't holding white_block_2. So the constraint isn't satisfied. So this plan would violate the constraint.

Therefore, putting orange_block_1 on the table via these two steps doesn't satisfy the constraint. Hence, the plan is invalid.

So I need to find a way to have, before putting orange_block_1 on the table, either red_block_1 is clear or I'm holding white_block_2.

So perhaps instead of putting orange_block_1 on the table directly, I need to first make sure that either red_block_1 is clear or I hold white_block_2 before moving orange_block_1. But how?

Alternatively, maybe I need to move white_block_2 first. But white_block_2 is under red_block_2. So to get white_block_2, I need to first remove red_block_2 and orange_block_1. But that's the same problem again.

Wait, perhaps the solution is to stack orange_block_1 somewhere else where, after moving it, we can satisfy the constraint.

Wait, another approach: after unstacking orange_block_1 from red_block_2, instead of putting it down immediately, maybe stack it on another block. But then that doesn't put it on the table, so the constraint requires that at some state it is on the table. So maybe we have to put it down eventually, but perhaps during that process, we can create a situation where the prior condition holds.

Wait, let me think. Suppose I unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2 (step 1). Then, instead of putting it down, stack it onto a different block, say black_block_2. Then, later, I unstack it again and put it down. But that would require more steps, but maybe in that case, when I finally put orange_block_1 on the table, the prior state where I unstacked it from black_block_2 may have met the required condition.

But this seems complicated. Let me try to outline:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. Now holding orange_block_1.

2. Stack orange_block_1 onto black_block_2 (which is clear). Now, black_block_2 has orange_block_1. Then, to get orange_block_1 on the table, I need to unstack it from black_block_2. But when I unstack it, I need to have black_block_2 clear, which it is. Then, after unstacking, I can putdown orange_block_1. Now, in the state where orange_block_1 is on the table (after putdown), the prior state was unstacking it from black_block_2. But in that prior state, was red_block_1 clear or was I holding white_block_2? No. So that still doesn't satisfy the constraint.

Hmm. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, after unstacking orange_block_1 from red_block_2 and holding it, perhaps I can put it down after ensuring that either red_block_1 is clear or I held white_block_2 at some point before.

Wait, maybe before moving orange_block_1, I first do something that makes red_block_1 clear. But red_block_1 has white_block_2 on top. To make red_block_1 clear, I need to remove white_block_2. But white_block_2 is under red_block_2 and orange_block_1. So to remove white_block_2, I need to first remove red_block_2 and orange_block_1. Which brings me back to the same problem.

Alternatively, maybe I can unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. But white_block_2 is currently under red_block_2. So to unstack white_block_2, I need red_block_2 to be clear. But red_block_2 is under orange_block_1. So first, unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. Then unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. Now, white_block_2 is clear. Then I can unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1, which would make red_block_1 clear. Then, perhaps during this process, after making red_block_1 clear, I can proceed to handle orange_block_1.

Let me outline this:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. Now holding orange_block_1. Then putdown orange_block_1. But again, when we put it down, the prior state (unstack) didn't satisfy the constraint. So this is a problem.

Alternatively, after unstacking orange_block_1, instead of putting it down, stack it onto another block, say white_block_1. Wait, but white_block_1 is under black_block_2, so white_block_1 is not clear. So can't stack there.

Alternatively, stack orange_block_1 onto black_block_2. Then, after that, we can unstack black_block_2 from white_block_1, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the solution is to first move white_block_2. But how? Let's see.

Another approach: To satisfy the constraint that when orange_block_1 is on the table, there was an earlier state where either red_block_1 is clear or I held white_block_2. So maybe during the process of moving orange_block_1, I can first hold white_block_2, then put it down, and then proceed to move orange_block_1. But how?

Let me try to think of a different path. Let's say:

First, unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. Then, stack orange_block_1 on some other block. Then, after that, unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. Wait, but white_block_2 is under red_block_2. So to unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1, I need to first remove red_block_2. Which is on top of white_block_2. So red_block_2 is on white_block_2. To unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2, I need to have red_block_2 clear, which it is after removing orange_block_1.

So steps:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. Now holding orange_block_1.

2. Putdown orange_block_1. Now orange_block_1 is on the table. But this violates the constraint, because before this step, when we unstacked orange_block_1, red_block_1 wasn't clear and we weren't holding white_block_2.

So this approach fails.

Alternative steps:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. Hold orange_block_1.

2. Now, instead of putting it down, stack it on black_block_2. Stack orange_block_1 black_block_2. Now, black_block_2 has orange_block_1.

3. Now, unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. Because red_block_2 is clear (since orange_block_1 was moved). Then, putdown red_block_2. This achieves the goal. But in this case, orange_block_1 is on black_block_2, not on the table, so the constraint isn't satisfied. So we need to have orange_block_1 on the table at some point.

So we need to add steps to put orange_block_1 on the table. For example:

After step 2 (stack orange_block_1 on black_block_2), then later:

4. Unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_2. Then put it down. Now, when we putdown orange_block_1, we need to check if in some prior state, either red_block_1 was clear or we were holding white_block_2.

So in step 4, when we putdown orange_block_1, the prior state was unstacking it from black_block_2. In that state, were we holding white_block_2? No. Was red_block_1 clear? At that point, white_block_2 is still on red_block_1. So red_block_1 is not clear. So again, the constraint is not met.

Hmm. So perhaps the only way to satisfy the constraint is to have a state where we hold white_block_2 before putting orange_block_1 on the table.

How can we hold white_block_2? To do that, we need to unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. But white_block_2 has red_block_2 on top. So first, we need to unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. To unstack red_block_2, we need to have it clear. But initially, it's under orange_block_1. So first, unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. Then unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. Then unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. Now, we can hold white_block_2.

Let's outline this:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. Hold orange_block_1.

2. Putdown orange_block_1. Now orange_block_1 is on the table. But this step violates the constraint as before.

Alternatively:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. Hold orange_block_1.

2. Stack orange_block_1 somewhere else. Let's say on black_block_2.

3. Unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. Now hold red_block_2.

4. Putdown red_block_2. Now red_block_2 is on the table. Goal achieved.

But in this case, orange_block_1 is on black_block_2, not on the table. So the constraint of having orange_block_1 on the table at some state isn't met. So we need to put it on the table later.

So steps 5 and 6:

5. Unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_2. Hold it.

6. Putdown orange_block_1. Now it's on the table. But when we put it down, we need to check that prior to this, either red_block_1 was clear or we held white_block_2.

At step 5, when we unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_2, red_block_1 still has white_block_2 on it. So red_block_1 is not clear. And we were holding orange_block_1, not white_block_2. So this would violate the constraint.

Hmm. So the problem is that whenever we put orange_block_1 on the table, we need to have a prior state where red_block_1 was clear or we held white_block_2. 

So perhaps the solution is to first move white_block_2 to a position where when we eventually put orange_block_1 on the table, we had held white_block_2 earlier.

Let's try:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. Hold orange_block_1.

2. Putdown orange_block_1. But this violates the constraint. So instead of putting it down, maybe stack it on another block. Let's say black_block_2.

3. Unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. Now hold red_block_2.

4. Putdown red_block_2. Now the goal is achieved.

But orange_block_1 is still on black_block_2, so we need to move it to the table to satisfy the constraint. Let's proceed:

5. Unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_2. Hold it.

6. Now, before putting it down, perhaps we can unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. But white_block_2 is currently on red_block_1 and has nothing on top (since red_block_2 was moved). So:

5. Unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. Now hold white_block_2.

6. Now, stack white_block_2 somewhere else. But that's optional. Now, since I'm holding white_block_2, this satisfies the condition for the constraint. Then, when I putdown orange_block_1, the prior state (step 5) involved holding white_block_2, which satisfies the constraint.

Wait, but in this approach:

Steps:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2.

2. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_2.

3. Unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2.

4. Putdown red_block_2. (Goal achieved)

5. Unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. (Now holding white_block_2)

6. Putdown white_block_2. (Optional, but not necessary for the goal)

7. Unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_2. Now holding orange_block_1.

8. Putdown orange_block_1. Now, in this step, when we putdown orange_block_1, the prior state was unstacking from black_block_2. But in step 5, we were holding white_block_2. So does that count as an earlier state where we were holding white_block_2 before step 8? Yes. Because step 5 is before step 8.

So the constraint says that in the state where orange_block_1 is on the table (step 8), there must be an earlier state (like step 5) where we were holding white_block_2. That would satisfy the constraint.

Thus, this plan would satisfy the constraint.

So the full steps would be:

1. unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2

2. stack orange_block_1 black_block_2

3. unstack red_block_2 white_block_2

4. putdown red_block_2

5. unstack white_block_2 red_block_1

6. putdown white_block_2

7. unstack orange_block_1 black_block_2

8. putdown orange_block_1

But wait, step 4 already achieves the goal. The rest of the steps are to satisfy the constraint. However, the constraint only requires that in at least one state, orange_block_1 is on the table. So steps 7 and 8 are needed to have orange_block_1 on the table. But in step 8, when we putdown orange_block_1, the prior step (7) was unstacking it from black_block_2. But earlier in step 5, we were holding white_block_2. Since step 5 is before step 8, the constraint is satisfied because there's an earlier state (step 5) where we were holding white_block_2, and in step 8, orange_block_1 is on the table.

Thus, this plan would work.

But let's check the steps for validity.

Step 1: unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2. Preconditions: orange_block_1 is on red_block_2, clear, and arm is empty. Yes. Then stack orange_block_1 onto black_block_2. Preconditions: holding orange_block_1, and black_block_2 is clear. Initially, black_block_2 is clear. Yes. So step 2 is valid.

Step 3: unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. Preconditions: red_block_2 is on white_block_2, red_block_2 is clear (after step 2, orange_block_1 is stacked on black_block_2, so red_block_2 is now clear). Yes. So unstack red_block_2 and hold it.

Step 4: putdown red_block_2. Now it's on the table. Goal achieved.

Step 5: unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. Since after step 3, white_block_2 is clear (because red_block_2 was removed). So yes. So unstack white_block_2, now holding it.

Step 6: putdown white_block_2. Now it's on the table.

Step 7: unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_2. Black_block_2 has orange_block_1, which is clear. Arm is empty. So yes.

Step 8: putdown orange_block_1. Now on table. 

This plan has orange_block_1 on the table in step 8. The earlier step 5 had us holding white_block_2. So the constraint is satisfied: in step 8, orange_block_1 is on the table, and there's an earlier state (step 5) where we held white_block_2. 

But the problem is that the goal is only to have red_block_2 on the table. The rest of the steps are not necessary for the goal but are required to meet the constraint. However, the plan must be optimal (shortest possible). So maybe there's a shorter plan.

Wait, but the initial plan where we just move orange_block_1 to the table directly doesn't meet the constraint. So the steps above are necessary. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternative approach: after moving red_block_2 to the table, but before putting orange_block_1 on the table, we can hold white_block_2. For example:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2.

2. Putdown orange_block_1. (But this violates the constraint, as before.)

Alternative idea: After unstacking orange_block_1 and before putting it down, do something else that involves holding white_block_2.

But how?

Let's think again. To meet the constraint, when orange_block_1 is on the table, there must be an earlier state where either red_block_1 was clear or I held white_block_2. So perhaps after moving orange_block_1, but before putting it down, I can hold white_block_2.

Wait, but orange_block_1 is in the arm after unstacking. To hold white_block_2, I need to put down orange_block_1 first. So:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2. Hold it.

2. Putdown orange_block_1. Now, in this state, orange_block_1 is on the table, but the constraint requires that before this step, there was a state where either red_block_1 was clear or holding white_block_2. But before step 2 (step 1), red_block_1 wasn't clear and I wasn't holding white_block_2. So this is invalid.

Alternative steps:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2.

2. Stack orange_block_1 onto another block (like black_block_2).

3. Unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2.

4. Putdown red_block_2. (Goal achieved)

5. Now, unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. Now holding white_block_2.

6. Now, unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_2. Requires holding nothing. So putdown white_block_2 first.

Wait:

5. Unstack white_block_2 red_block_1. Now holding white_block_2.

6. Putdown white_block_2.

7. Unstack orange_block_1 black_block_2. Now holding orange_block_1.

8. Putdown orange_block_1.

Now, in step 8, orange_block_1 is on the table, and in step 5, I was holding white_block_2. So the constraint is satisfied. This is the same as before, but requires 8 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternative plan:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2.

2. Stack orange_block_1 black_block_2.

3. Unstack red_block_2 white_block_2.

4. Putdown red_block_2.

5. Unstack white_block_2 red_block_1.

6. Stack orange_block_1 white_block_2. (But white_block_2 is on the table after step 5?)

Wait, step 5: unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1, so white_block_2 is held. Then put it down (step 6: putdown white_block_2). Then unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_2 (step 7), then putdown orange_block_1 (step 8). So that's 8 steps. 

Alternatively, after step 5 (holding white_block_2), can we stack orange_block_1 on white_block_2?

Wait, after step 2: orange_block_1 is on black_block_2. To stack orange_block_1 on white_block_2, we need to unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_2, which requires step 7. So perhaps no shortcut.

Is there a way to have fewer steps?

Let me try:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2.

2. Unstack red_block_2 white_block_2. (But after step 1, red_block_2 is clear. So yes.)

3. Putdown red_block_2. (Goal achieved)

4. Unstack white_block_2 red_block_1. (Now, white_block_2 is clear.)

5. Putdown white_block_2. 

6. Now, putdown orange_block_1. Wait, after step 1, we were holding orange_block_1. But in step 2, to unstack red_block_2, we need to have the arm empty. So this sequence is invalid.

Ah, right. After step 1, we are holding orange_block_1. So step 2 (unstack red_block_2) can't be done unless we putdown orange_block_1 first. So steps would be:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2. Hold orange_block_1.

2. Putdown orange_block_1. Now, orange_block_1 is on table. But this violates the constraint.

So no. So the only valid way is to first move orange_block_1 to another block, then proceed.

So the previous plan of 8 steps seems necessary. But maybe there's a shorter path.

Wait, let's consider:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2.

2. Stack orange_block_1 black_block_2.

3. Unstack red_block_2 white_block_2.

4. Putdown red_block_2.

5. Unstack white_block_2 red_block_1.

6. Now, I'm holding white_block_2. At this point, the constraint for orange_block_1 being on the table would require that when we put it down, there was an earlier state where we held white_block_2. But orange_block_1 is still on black_block_2. So to put it on the table:

7. Unstack orange_block_1 black_block_2.

8. Putdown orange_block_1.

Now, in step 8, orange_block_1 is on the table. The earlier state in step 5, we were holding white_block_2. So this satisfies the constraint.

But steps 5 and 7 are necessary.

So the plan is 8 steps. Is there a shorter plan?

Wait, what if after step 5 (holding white_block_2), we stack it somewhere, then unstack orange_block_1 and put it down. Let's see:

After step 5: holding white_block_2.

6. Stack white_block_2 on some block, say red_block_1 (which is now clear).

7. Unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_2.

8. Putdown orange_block_1.

This is also 8 steps. So same length.

Alternatively, can we stack white_block_2 on orange_block_1? Not sure. But regardless, the number of steps remains the same.

So perhaps this is the optimal plan. Let's check the constraints again.

In the final plan:

Steps:

1. unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2

2. stack orange_block_1 black_block_2

3. unstack red_block_2 white_block_2

4. putdown red_block_2 (goal achieved)

5. unstack white_block_2 red_block_1

6. putdown white_block_2

7. unstack orange_block_1 black_block_2

8. putdown orange_block_1

Now, step 8: orange_block_1 is on the table. The earlier step 5 has us holding white_block_2. So the constraint is satisfied. Also, orange_block_1 is on the table in step 8, so the constraint of "at least one state where orange_block_1 is on table" is met.

This plan has 8 actions. Is there a way to do it in fewer steps?

Let me think again. Maybe after unstacking red_block_2, I can use it to satisfy the constraint. Wait, but no. The constraint requires that when orange_block_1 is on the table, there's a prior state with red_block_1 clear or holding white_block_2.

Alternatively, perhaps after unstacking orange_block_1 and stacking it, then unstacking red_block_2 and putting it down, then we can unstack orange_block_1 and put it down without needing to unstack white_block_2. But in that case, when we putdown orange_block_1, the prior step would be unstacking from black_block_2. At that time, red_block_1 still has white_block_2 on it. So the constraint isn't met.

So perhaps the only way is to include the steps to unstack white_block_2 and hold it, thereby creating the prior state where we held white_block_2 before putting orange_block_1 down.

Thus, the 8-step plan seems to be the minimal possible. Let me check if there's a shorter way.

Wait, after step 2: orange_block_1 is on black_block_2. Then steps 3 and 4 achieve the goal. Then, to satisfy the constraint, we need to have orange_block_1 on the table. So steps 7 and 8 are needed. But steps 5 and 6 are for holding white_block_2. However, maybe we can avoid steps 5 and 6 by instead using a different approach.

Wait, after step 4 (goal achieved), orange_block_1 is on black_block_2. To put it on the table, steps 7 and 8 are needed. But before step 7, can we have a state where we hold white_block_2? For example, after step 4, can we unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1?

Yes, after step 4, red_block_1 has white_block_2 (since red_block_2 was moved). But white_block_2 is clear because red_block_2 was removed. So step 5: unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. Now holding white_block_2.

Then step 6: putdown white_block_2. Then step 7: unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_2. Step 8: putdown. 

So steps 5-8 are needed to put orange_block_1 on the table and meet the constraint. So yes, it's 8 steps.

Alternatively, if we can find a way to have orange_block_1 on the table without needing to unstack white_block_2, but that seems impossible due to the constraint.

Therefore, the minimal plan is 8 steps. Let me verify each action's preconditions.

Step 1: unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2. Orange is on red_block_2, clear, and arm empty. Correct.

Step 2: stack orange_block_1 black_block_2. Arm holds orange_block_1, black_block_2 is clear. Yes.

Step 3: unstack red_block_2 white_block_2. Red_block_2 is on white_block_2, clear. Arm is empty. Yes.

Step 4: putdown red_block_2. Arm holds red_block_2. Yes.

Step 5: unstack white_block_2 red_block_1. White_block_2 is on red_block_1, clear. Arm is empty. Yes.

Step 6: putdown white_block_2. Arm holds white_block_2. Yes.

Step 7: unstack orange_block_1 black_block_2. Orange_block_1 is on black_block_2, clear. Arm is empty. Yes.

Step 8: putdown orange_block_1. Arm holds orange_block_1. Yes.

All steps are valid, and the plan achieves the goal while satisfying the constraints.
