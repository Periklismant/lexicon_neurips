Let's break down the problem:

Initial State:
- black_block_1 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- white_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- black_block_2 is on top of white_block_1
- red_block_2 is on top of white_block_2
- orange_block_1 is on top of red_block_2
- black_block_2 is clear
- orange_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Goal: 
- red_block_2 is on the table

Constraints:
1. The expression "orange_block_1 is on the table" must hold in at least one state.
2. If "orange_block_1 is on the table" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which either "red_block_1 is clear" or "you are holding white_block_2" is true.

Let's think about the block arrangements initially. 

We have two towers:
- Tower 1: black_block_1 (bottom), white_block_1, black_block_2 (top)
- Tower 2: red_block_1 (bottom), white_block_2, red_block_2, orange_block_1 (top)

To achieve the goal, we need to place red_block_2 on the table. Currently, red_block_2 is in Tower 2, and it's covered by orange_block_1.

Let's also consider the constraints:
- We need to place orange_block_1 on the table at some point.
- Before placing orange_block_1 on the table, we need to ensure that either red_block_1 is clear or we are holding white_block_2.

Initially, red_block_1 is not clear (it has white_block_2 on top), and we are not holding white_block_2. 

So, to satisfy the constraint, we must first make red_block_1 clear or hold white_block_2 before placing orange_block_1 on the table.

Here's a plan:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2.
2. Putdown orange_block_1 on the table. (This violates the constraint because we haven't yet made red_block_1 clear or held white_block_2)

Let's redo it:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2.
2. Unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. (Now we're holding red_block_2)
3. Putdown red_block_2 on the table. (Goal achieved)

But this doesn't satisfy the constraint about orange_block_1 being on the table. So let's adjust:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2.
2. Putdown orange_block_1 on the table. (But we still need to satisfy the other constraint)

We need to unstack the entire Tower 2 to make red_block_1 clear. Let's try again:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2.
2. Unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2.
3. Unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. (Now red_block_1 is clear)
4. Putdown white_block_2 on the table.
5. Pickup orange_block_1 from the table.
6. Putdown orange_block_1 on the table. (Now the constraint is satisfied because red_block_1 is clear)
7. Pickup red_block_2.
8. Putdown red_block_2 on the table. (Goal achieved)

But actually this plan is inefficient. I can be more economical:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2.
2. Unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2.
3. Unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. (Now red_block_1 is clear)
4. Putdown white_block_2 on the table.
5. Putdown orange_block_1 on the table. (Now the constraint is satisfied because red_block_1 is clear)
6. Putdown red_block_2 on the table. (Goal achieved)

But wait, I just realized that in steps 4 and 5, I'm holding one block and then putting down a different block. That's not possible. I can only hold one block at a time.

Let me revise the plan:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2.
2. Putdown orange_block_1 on the table. (But this still violates the constraint because red_block_1 isn't clear yet and we aren't holding white_block_2)

But come to think of it, the constraint requires that if orange_block_1 is on the table, there must be a PREVIOUS state where red_block_1 is clear or we are holding white_block_2. It doesn't require that we place orange_block_1 on the table immediately after one of these conditions is true.

So, if we place orange_block_1 on the table, we need to make sure that at some earlier point in our plan, one of those conditions was true.

Let's try again:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. (We're holding orange_block_1)
2. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_2. (orange_block_1 is now on black_block_2)
3. Unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. (We're holding red_block_2)
4. Putdown red_block_2 on the table. (Goal achieved, but we still need to satisfy the constraint)

Wait, we haven't satisfied the constraint yet. I'd be better off trying a strategy that first achieves the constraint.

Let's directly try to make red_block_1 clear or hold white_block_2:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. (We're holding orange_block_1)
2. Putdown orange_block_1 on the table. (Temporarily, to free up our hand. But we're going to take it again)
3. Unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. (We're holding red_block_2)
4. Putdown red_block_2 on the table. (We've achieved our goal of having red_block_2 on the table, but we still need to satisfy the constraint)
5. Unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. (We're holding white_block_2 now. This is one of the conditions from the constraint!)
6. Putdown white_block_2 on the table.
7. Pickup orange_block_1 from the table.
8. Putdown orange_block_1 on the table. (Now the constraint is satisfied because there was a previous state where we were holding white_block_2)

However, I want to be more efficient. I'm aiming for a shorter plan:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. (We're holding orange_block_1)
2. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_2.
3. Unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. (We're holding red_block_2)
4. Putdown red_block_2 on the table. (We've achieved our goal of having red_block_2 on the table)
5. Unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. (We're holding white_block_2. This is one of the conditions from the constraint!)
6. Putdown white_block_2 on the table.
7. Unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_2. (We're holding orange_block_1)
8. Putdown orange_block_1 on the table. (Now the constraint is satisfied because there was a previous state where we were holding white_block_2)

Actually, I think I can make the plan even more efficient. The order of operations is key. Let me think step by step.

Actually, let me re-read the constraint more carefully. I think I misunderstood it initially. The constraint states:

"If expression 'orange_block_1 is on the table' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which either 'red_block_1 is clear' or 'you are holding white_block_2' is true."

So, the constraint is triggered only if we place orange_block_1 on the table. It doesn't mandate that we must place orange_block_1 on the table at some point; it's saying if we do, then certain conditions must have been true in an earlier state.

Now, the first part of the constraint is:

"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'orange_block_1 is on the table'."

This does mandate that we place orange_block_1 on the table at some point.

Combined, these constraints mean we must place orange_block_1 on the table at some point, and before we do, we need to ensure that either red_block_1 is clear or we are holding white_block_2 at an earlier state.

Let's reconsider our plan with this understanding.

Initial state:
- Tower 1: black_block_1 (bottom), white_block_1, black_block_2 (top)
- Tower 2: red_block_1 (bottom), white_block_2, red_block_2, orange_block_1 (top)

Our goal is to place red_block_2 on the table, and we need to ensure that before placing orange_block_1 on the table, either red_block_1 is clear or we are holding white_block_2.

Rather than trying to satisfy the constraint inefficiently, let's focus on a plan that achieves our goal and then checks if the constraint is implicitly satisfied.

Here's a more direct plan:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. (We're holding orange_block_1)
2. Putdown orange_block_1 on the table. (Now orange_block_1 is on the table. But we need to ensure that red_block_1 is clear or we're holding white_block_2 before this state. Let's see. Neither condition was met in the initial state. We'll have to revise this plan.)

Let's try a different approach. Since we need to have orange_block_1 on the table at some point, and we also need red_block_1 to be clear or be holding white_block_2 before that, let's structure our plan accordingly:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. (We're holding orange_block_1)
2. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_2. (This is a temporary placement for orange_block_1, so we can free our hand)
3. Unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. (We're holding red_block_2)
4. Putdown red_block_2 on the table. (We've achieved our goal of having red_block_2 on the table, but we still need to satisfy the constraint)
5. Unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. (Now red_block_1 is clear. This is one of the conditions from the constraint!)
6. Putdown white_block_2 on the table.
7. Unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_2. (We're holding orange_block_1)
8. Putdown orange_block_1 on the table. (Now the constraint is satisfied because there was a previous state where red_block_1 was clear)

Actually, wait. Let's think about efficient plans for our goal (getting red_block_2 on the table):

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2.
2. Unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2.
3. Putdown red_block_2 on the table.

These three steps achieve the goal. Now, we need to see if we can satisfy the constraint.

For the constraint, we need to:
1. Place orange_block_1 on the table at some point.
2. Before doing that, either have red_block_1 clear or be holding white_block_2.

Now, if we simply follow the above plan and also place orange_block_1 on the table (step 2), neither of the conditions for the constraint are met before step 2. So, we need to adjust the plan.

A possible adjustment is:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. (We're holding orange_block_1)
2. Stack orange_block_1 somewhere else (e.g., on black_block_2). (This is a temporary placement for orange_block_1, so we can free our hand)
3. Unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. (We're holding red_block_2)
4. Putdown red_block_2 on the table. (Goal achieved)
5. [Additional steps to satisfy the constraint...]

For the constraint, we need to make red_block_1 clear or be holding white_block_2 before placing orange_block_1 on the table.

Continuing from step 4:

5. Unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. (Now red_block_1 is clear. This is one of the conditions from the constraint!)
6. Putdown white_block_2 on the table.
7. Unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_2. (We're holding orange_block_1)
8. Putdown orange_block_1 on the table. (Now the constraint is satisfied because there was a previous state where red_block_1 was clear)

This plan satisfies both the goal and the constraint. Let's review it once more:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. (We're holding orange_block_1)
2. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_2. (This is a temporary placement for orange_block_1)
3. Unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. (We're holding red_block_2)
4. Putdown red_block_2 on the table. (Goal achieved)
5. Unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. (Now red_block_1 is clear, satisfying one of the conditions for the constraint!)
6. Putdown white_block_2 on the table.
7. Unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_2. (We're holding orange_block_1)
8. Putdown orange_block_1 on the table. (Constraint satisfied because red_block_1 was clear in a previous state)

However I'm not sure that the placing of orange_block_1 on top of black_block_2 is valid, since the instructions say that if orange_block_1 is on the table, it's necessary to PREVIOUSLY have either red_block_1 clear or to be holding white_block_2. Let's check if this is still true.

But wait, I'm getting confused. So the constraint requires that if orange_block_1 is ever on the table, then previously red_block_1 should have been cleared, or we should have been holding white_block_2. So I have to guarantee that one of these things happens before orange_block_1 is put on the table. And separately, we need to make sure orange_block_1 is on the table at some point.

So let me check the above plan: in step 8 we have orange_block_1 on the table, and in step 5, red_block_1 becomes clear. So the constraint is satisfied in the plan. Let me double-check it's correct:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. (We're holding orange_block_1)
2. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_2. (This is a temporary placement for orange_block_1)
3. Unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. (We're holding red_block_2)
4. Putdown red_block_2 on the table. (Goal achieved)
5. Unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. (Now red_block_1 is clear, satisfying one of the conditions for the constraint!)
6. Putdown white_block_2 on the table.
7. Unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_2. (We're holding orange_block_1)
8. Putdown orange_block_1 on the table. (Constraint satisfied because red_block_1 was clear in a previous state)

Is the constraint satisfied? Let me check:
- orange_block_1 is on the table in the end? Yes, after step 8.
- Before orange_block_1 is on the table, is red_block_1 clear or do we hold white_block_2? Yes, red_block_1 is clear after step 5.

So, the plan satisfies both the goal and the constraint, and it's an 8-step plan.

Actually, wait. I'm checking for other options.

If, instead of temporarily placing orange_block_1 on black_block_2, we just putdown orange_block_1 on the table immediately, then we'd have:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. (We're holding orange_block_1)
2. Putdown orange_block_1 on the table. (We need to have red_block_1 clear or be holding white_block_2 before this, but we don't. So this plan doesn't work.)

Let me try using a helper plan:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. (We're holding orange_block_1)
2. [Put orange_block_1 somewhere other than the table]. (We've freed our hand)
3. Unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. (We're holding red_block_2)
4. Putdown red_block_2 on the table. (Goal achieved)
5. [Get red_block_1 clear or hold white_block_2]
6. [Put orange_block_1 on the table]

Now, to clear red_block_1, we'd need to unstack white_block_2 from it. But since we've already removed red_block_2 and orange_block_1 from tower 2, the only thing left is white_block_2 on red_block_1. So steps 5 and 6 would simply be:

5. Unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. (We're holding white_block_2, and red_block_1 is clear). Right here: at this stage we have red_block_1 is clear, and so we've satisfied the requirement for step 7 below.
6. Stack white_block_2 somewhere/or put it on the table.
7. [Retrieve orange_block_1 from wherever we put it]
8. Putdown orange_block_1 on the table.

If we putdown white_block_2 on the table in step 6, we'd have:

5. Unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. (We're holding white_block_2, and red_block_1 is clear)
6. Putdown white_block_2 on the table.
7. Unstack [orange_block_1] from [wherever we put it]
8. Putdown orange_block_1 on the table.

Now, we need to decide where to place orange_block_1 in step 2.
We could stack it on black_block_2 (which is clear in the initial state):

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. (We're holding orange_block_1)
2. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_2. (orange_block_1 is on black_block_2)
3. Unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. (We're holding red_block_2)
4. Putdown red_block_2 on the table. (Goal achieved)
5. Unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. (We're holding white_block_2, and red_block_1 is clear)
6. Putdown white_block_2 on the table.
7. Unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_2. (We're holding orange_block_1)
8. Putdown orange_block_1 on the table. (Constraint satisfied because red_block_1 was clear in a previous state, in step 5)

This gives us an 8-step plan.

Actually, I can't think of a shorter plan. Our goal (red_block_2 on the table) requires steps 1, 3, and 4 at a minimum. The constraint requires orange_block_1 to be on the table at some point. To meet the condition for the constraint (red_block_1 clear before orange_block_1 is on the table), we'd need steps 5 and 8 at a minimum. The rest (2, 6, and 7) are necessary intermediary steps.

So, my final answer is the 8-step plan described above.

Let me double-check one more time that the plan is valid and satisfies both the goal and the constraint:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. (We're holding orange_block_1)
2. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_2. (orange_block_1 is on black_block_2)
3. Unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. (We're holding red_block_2)
4. Putdown red_block_2 on the table. (Goal achieved)
5. Unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1. (We're holding white_block_2, and red_block_1 is clear)
6. Putdown white_block_2 on the table.
7. Unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_2. (We're holding orange_block_1)
8. Putdown orange_block_1 on the table. (Constraint satisfied because red_block_1 was clear in a previous state, in step 5)

After step 4, we have achieved our goal: red_block_2 is on the table. After step 8, we have satisfied the constraint: orange_block_1 is on the table at some point, and before that (in step 5), red_block_1 was clear.

Actually wait, I wonder if we could avoid using black_block_2 here. Let me just check that to put orange_block_1 on black_block_2, we do end up with a valid state. So black_block_2 is on top of white_block_1, which is on top of black_block_1. So the setup works.

I think we have a valid plan. Let's summarize it more explicitly to make sure it's all valid:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2: This is valid because orange_block_1 is clear and the arm is empty.
2. Stack orange_block_1 on black_block_2: This is valid because the arm is holding orange_block_1 and black_block_2 is clear.
3. Unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2: This is valid because red_block_2 is clear and the arm is empty.
4. Putdown red_block_2 on the table: This is valid because the arm is holding red_block_2.
5. Unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1: This is valid because white_block_2 is clear and the arm is empty.
6. Putdown white_block_2 on the table: This is valid because the arm is holding white_block_2.
7. Unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_2: This is valid because orange_block_1 is clear and the arm is empty.
8. Putdown orange_block_1 on the table: This is valid because the arm is holding orange_block_1.

So, the 8-step plan is valid and satisfies both the goal and the constraint.

Let me triple-check: we are aiming to get red_block_2 on the table (done after step 4). There is a constraint requiring that if orange_block_1 is on the table, either red_block_1 is clear or we are holding white_block_2 previously. After step 5, red_block_1 is clear. And after step 8, orange_block_1 is on the table. So the constraint is satisfied. 

We're done!
