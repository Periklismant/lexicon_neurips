Let's break down the problem step by step to find an optimal plan that satisfies all the given conditions.

### Initial State:
- black_block_1 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- white_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- black_block_2 is on top of white_block_1
- red_block_2 is on top of white_block_2
- orange_block_1 is on top of red_block_2
- black_block_2 is clear
- orange_block_1 is clear
- The robotic arm is not holding any block.

### Goal:
- red_block_2 is on the table.

### Constraints:
1. At some point, "orange_block_1 is on the table" must hold.
2. If "orange_block_1 is on the table" holds, then earlier either:
   - "red_block_1 is clear" must hold, or
   - "you are holding white_block_2" must hold.

### Analysis:
To get red_block_2 on the table, we need to unstack it from white_block_2. However, orange_block_1 is on top of red_block_2, so we must first unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2 and put it down on the table (to satisfy the first constraint). 

After putting orange_block_1 on the table, we can unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2 and put it on the table to achieve the goal. 

Now, let's check the second constraint: when orange_block_1 is on the table, earlier either "red_block_1 is clear" or "you are holding white_block_2" must hold. 
- Initially, red_block_1 is not clear (white_block_2 is on top of it).
- To satisfy the constraint, we must ensure that before orange_block_1 is on the table, we are holding white_block_2. 

Thus, the plan must include picking up white_block_2 before putting orange_block_1 on the table.

### Plan:
1. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2 (this requires red_block_2 to be clear, which it is, and the arm is empty).
   - After this, the arm is holding orange_block_1, and red_block_2 is clear.
2. Putdown orange_block_1 on the table (now orange_block_1 is on the table, satisfying the first constraint).
   - Now, the arm is empty, and orange_block_1 is on the table.
3. Unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2 (red_block_2 is clear, and the arm is empty).
   - Now, the arm is holding red_block_2.
4. Putdown red_block_2 on the table (goal achieved).

However, this plan does not satisfy the second constraint because before orange_block_1 is on the table (step 2), neither "red_block_1 is clear" nor "you are holding white_block_2" holds. 

To satisfy the second constraint, we need to modify the plan to ensure that before orange_block_1 is on the table, we are holding white_block_2. Here's the corrected plan:

### Corrected Plan:
1. Unstack white_block_2 from red_block_1 (white_block_2 is clear, and the arm is empty).
   - Now, the arm is holding white_block_2, and red_block_1 is clear.
2. Unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2 (red_block_2 is clear, and the arm is empty).
   - Now, the arm is holding orange_block_1, and red_block_2 is clear.
3. Putdown orange_block_1 on the table (now orange_block_1 is on the table, satisfying the first constraint).
   - Now, the arm is empty, and orange_block_1 is on the table.
   - Before this step, the arm was holding white_block_2 (in step 1), satisfying the second constraint.
4. Putdown white_block_2 on the table (to free the arm for the next steps).
   - Now, the arm is empty, and white_block_2 is on the table.
5. Unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2 (red_block_2 is clear, and the arm is empty).
   - Now, the arm is holding red_block_2.
6. Putdown red_block_2 on the table (goal achieved).

This plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal in 6 steps. 

### Final Plan:
```
```
unstack white_block_2 red_block_1
unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2
putdown orange_block_1
putdown white_block_2
unstack red_block_2 white_block_2
putdown red_block_2
```
```
