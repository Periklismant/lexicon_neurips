Okay, let's see. I need to get red_block_2 onto the table. Let me first look at the initial state to figure out where everything is. 

So, starting from the initial setup: 

- black_block_1 is on the table, with white_block_1 on top of it, and then black_block_2 on top of white_block_1. Black_block_2 is clear.
- red_block_1 is on the table, with white_block_2 on top of it. Then red_block_2 is on white_block_2, and orange_block_1 is on red_block_2. Both orange_block_1 and black_block_2 are clear.

The goal is to have red_block_2 on the table. Right now, red_block_2 is under orange_block_1. So to get red_block_2 down, I first need to remove whatever is on top of it. Orange_block_1 is on red_block_2, so I need to unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. But to do that, the arm must be empty, which it is initially.

So the first step would be to unstack orange_block_1 from red_block_2. After that, the arm is holding orange_block_1, and red_block_2 becomes clear. Then I need to put down orange_block_1 somewhere. Let's put it on the table. So putdown orange_block_1.

Now, with red_block_2 clear, I can unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. Wait, but red_block_2 is on white_block_2. To unstack red_block_2, the arm is empty, so unstack red_block_2 white_block_2. Then the arm is holding red_block_2, and white_block_2 becomes clear. Then I can putdown red_block_2 on the table. That would achieve the goal.

Wait, but let me check the preconditions for each step.

First, unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2. Preconditions: orange_block_1 is on red_block_2, orange_block_1 is clear, and the arm is empty. Yes, in the initial state, orange_block_1 is clear and on red_block_2, and the arm is empty. So that's valid. After unstacking, the arm holds orange_block_1, red_block_2 becomes clear.

Then, putdown orange_block_1. That requires holding it, which we are. Putting it on the table. So after that, orange_block_1 is on the table, clear, and arm is empty.

Next, unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2. Wait, red_block_2 is on white_block_2. So to unstack red_block_2, we need that red_block_2 is clear (which it is now, since we removed orange_block_1) and that the arm is empty. So yes, after putting down orange_block_1, the arm is empty. So unstack red_block_2 white_block_2. Now holding red_block_2. Then putdown red_block_2. That's the goal.

So the steps would be:

1. unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2
2. putdown orange_block_1
3. unstack red_block_2 white_block_2
4. putdown red_block_2

Wait, but when you putdown red_block_2, you achieve the goal. Let me verify if that's correct. Yes, because after step 4, red_block_2 is on the table. So that's the plan. Let's check if each action is possible.

Another thing to consider: when you unstack red_block_2 from white_block_2, after that, white_block_2 becomes clear. Then putting red_block_2 down is possible. The order of steps seems correct. Are there any blocks that need to be moved first? Let me think. Suppose after moving orange_block_1 and putting it down, then red_block_2 is clear. So the unstack is possible. Then putting it down. That's four actions. Is there a shorter way? Let me see.

Is there any alternative path? Suppose instead of putting orange_block_1 on the table, maybe stack it somewhere else. But since the goal only requires red_block_2 on the table, maybe that's unnecessary. The minimal steps would be the four actions I listed. Let me check again.

Alternative approach: Could I instead pick up red_block_2 directly? Wait, red_block_2 is under orange_block_1. So no, you can't pick it up until orange_block_1 is removed. So steps 1 and 2 are necessary. Then steps 3 and 4. So four actions. That's the minimal, right? Because you can't avoid moving orange_block_1 first. So the plan should be four steps. Let me confirm each action's preconditions again.

1. unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2: yes, orange is on red_2, clear, arm empty.

2. putdown orange_block_1: holding it.

3. unstack red_block_2 white_block_2: red_2 is on white_2, red_2 is clear (after step 2, orange is on table, so red_2 is clear), arm empty (after putdown, arm is empty). So yes.

4. putdown red_block_2: holding it.

Yes, this seems correct. So the optimal plan is four steps.
