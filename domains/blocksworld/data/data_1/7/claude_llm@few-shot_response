I'll solve this planning problem step by step.

First, let me understand the initial state:
- black_block_1 is on the table with white_block_1 on top of it, and black_block_2 on top of white_block_1. black_block_2 is clear.
- red_block_1 is on the table with white_block_2 on top of it, red_block_2 on top of white_block_2, and orange_block_1 on top of red_block_2. orange_block_1 is clear.
- The arm is not holding any block.

The goal is to have red_block_2 on the table.

The constraints require:
1. At some point, orange_block_1 must be on the table
2. Before orange_block_1 is on the table, either red_block_1 must be clear or we must be holding white_block_2

To reach the goal, I need to get red_block_2 to the table. Currently, it's under orange_block_1, so I need to remove orange_block_1 first.

Let me plan the sequence:

```
unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2
putdown orange_block_1
unstack red_block_2 white_block_2
putdown red_block_2
```

This plan satisfies all requirements:
- It achieves the goal of having red_block_2 on the table
- It places orange_block_1 on the table
- Before orange_block_1 is on the table, we unstack it from red_block_2, which means we're holding it (satisfying the constraint)
