To solve this planning problem, we need to find a sequence of actions that results in the robotic arm holding `brown_block_1` while satisfying the given constraints. Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

### Initial State:
- `brown_block_1` is on the table with `brown_block_3` on top of it.
- `red_block_1` is on the table with `grey_block_1` on top of it, and `blue_block_1` on top of `grey_block_1`, and `brown_block_2` on top of `blue_block_1`.
- `red_block_2` is on the table and clear.
- The arm is not holding any block.

### Goal:
- The arm is holding `brown_block_1`.

### Constraints:
1. At some point, `grey_block_1` must not be on top of `brown_block_3` (this is trivially true initially since `grey_block_1` is on `red_block_1`).
2. If `grey_block_1` is not on top of `brown_block_3` in some state, then either:
   - `red_block_2` is on top of `brown_block_1`, or
   - `grey_block_1` is clear (no block on top of it) must hold at that state or a later state.

### Plan:
To achieve the goal, we need to unstack `brown_block_3` from `brown_block_1` and then pick up `brown_block_1`. However, we must also ensure the constraints are satisfied. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. **Unstack `brown_block_2` from `blue_block_1`**: This will make `blue_block_1` clear, allowing us to unstack it later.
2. **Putdown `brown_block_2` on the table**: This frees the arm to pick up another block.
3. **Unstack `blue_block_1` from `grey_block_1`**: This makes `grey_block_1` clear, satisfying the second part of the constraint (since `grey_block_1` is clear).
4. **Stack `blue_block_1` on `red_block_2`**: This ensures `red_block_2` is not clear, but it's not directly relevant to the constraints.
5. **Unstack `brown_block_3` from `brown_block_1`**: This is necessary to eventually pick up `brown_block_1`.
6. **Putdown `brown_block_3` on the table**: This frees the arm to pick up `brown_block_1`.
7. **Pickup `brown_block_1`**: This achieves the goal.

### Verification of Constraints:
- The constraint `grey_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_3` holds in all states (since `grey_block_1` is never on `brown_block_3`).
- After step 3, `grey_block_1` is clear, satisfying the second part of the constraint.

### Final Plan:
```
```
unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1
putdown brown_block_2
unstack blue_block_1 grey_block_1
stack blue_block_1 red_block_2
unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1
putdown brown_block_3
pickup brown_block_1
```
```
