Okay, let's break this down. We need to pick up brown_block_1, but it has brown_block_3 on top of it. We also have some constraints to satisfy along the way.

Here's the plan:

1.  Unstack brown_block_3 from brown_block_1.
2.  Putdown brown_block_3 on the table.
3.  Pickup brown_block_1.

This plan is optimal because it directly addresses the goal with the fewest possible steps. Now let's check if it satisfies the constraints.

*   The constraint "grey_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_3" must hold in at least one state. This will be true after we putdown brown_block_3.
*   The constraint "If grey_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_3, then either red_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1 or grey_block_1 is clear" must hold after the first constraint is met. After we putdown brown_block_3, grey_block_1 is still not clear, and red_block_2 is not on top of brown_block_1. However, after we unstack brown_block_3 from brown_block_1, and putdown brown_block_3, grey_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_3. In this state, grey_block_1 is not clear, and red_block_2 is not on top of brown_block_1. But after we pickup brown_block_1, we are holding brown_block_1, and grey_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_3. In this state, grey_block_1 is not clear, and red_block_2 is not on top of brown_block_1.
