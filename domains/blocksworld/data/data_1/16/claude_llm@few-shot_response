I'll solve this planning problem step by step.

First, let me analyze the initial state:
- white_block_1 is on the table with red_block_1 on top of it
- brown_block_1 is on the table and clear
- yellow_block_1 is on the table with blue_block_1 on top, and brown_block_2 on top of blue_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on the table and clear
- The robot arm is not holding anything

The goal is to hold red_block_1.

The constraints require:
1. At some point, grey_block_1 must not be on top of blue_block_1 (this is already true in the initial state)
2. If grey_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1, then yellow_block_1 must be on top of blue_block_1 at that state or later

Since grey_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1 in the initial state, we need to ensure that yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1 at some point.

To reach the goal of holding red_block_1, I need to:
1. Unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1

But I also need to satisfy the constraint about yellow_block_1 being on top of blue_block_1. Currently, brown_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1, so I need to:
1. Unstack brown_block_2 from blue_block_1
2. Place yellow_block_1 on top of blue_block_1
3. Then unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1

Here's the optimal plan:

```
unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1
putdown brown_block_2
pickup yellow_block_1
stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
```
