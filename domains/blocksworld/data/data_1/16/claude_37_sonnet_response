Let's analyze this problem:

Given:
- We have 7 blocks: white_block_1, red_block_1, brown_block_1, yellow_block_1, grey_block_1, blue_block_1, brown_block_2
- Initial state:
  - white_block_1 is on the table
  - red_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
  - brown_block_1 is on the table
  - yellow_block_1 is on the table
  - grey_block_1 is on the table
  - blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
  - brown_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
  - red_block_1, brown_block_1, grey_block_1, brown_block_2 are clear
  - no block is being held

- Goal: you are holding red_block_1

- Constraints:
  1. "grey_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1" must hold at least in one state
  2. If "grey_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1" holds in a state, then "yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1" must hold in that state or later.

First, let's analyze the constraints:
- grey_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1 in the initial state (it's on the table), so the first constraint is satisfied
- Since grey_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1 in the initial state, by the second constraint, we need to ensure that yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1 at some point (either in the initial state or a future state).
- In the initial state, blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, and brown_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1. This doesn't satisfy the second part of the second constraint.

So, we need to rearrange the blocks to put yellow_block_1 on top of blue_block_1 at some point.

Now let's think about the goal. We need to hold red_block_1, which is currently on top of white_block_1. This will require us to unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1, which we can do because red_block_1 is already clear.

Let's solve the problem:

1. We need to satisfy the constraint that yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1 at some point.
2. Currently, yellow_block_1 is on the table, and brown_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1, which is on top of yellow_block_1. 
3. To satisfy this constraint, we'd need to remove brown_block_2 from blue_block_1, and then move yellow_block_1 to be on top of blue_block_1.
4. Then, we can proceed to our goal of holding red_block_1.

Let's plan our actions:

1. Unstack brown_block_2 from blue_block_1 (making blue_block_1 clear).
2. Unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (making yellow_block_1 clear and holding blue_block_1).
3. Put down blue_block_1 on the table.
4. Pick up yellow_block_1 from the table.
5. Stack yellow_block_1 on top of blue_block_1 (satisfying the constraint).
6. Unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1 (achieving the goal).

Wait, I need to be careful here. After I perform steps 1-5, I won't have a free hand to unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1. Let's reconsider.

Let's plan our actions again:

1. Unstack brown_block_2 from blue_block_1.
2. Put down brown_block_2 on the table.
3. Unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1.
4. Put down blue_block_1 on the table.
5. Pick up yellow_block_1 from the table.
6. Stack yellow_block_1 on top of blue_block_1 (satisfying the constraint).
7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1.
8. Put down yellow_block_1 on the table.
9. Unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1 (achieving the goal).

Ok, let's verify the validity and optimality of this plan (from the problem definition, an optimal plan is a valid plan with the shortest length):

Validating steps:
1. Can I unstack brown_block_2 from blue_block_1? Yes, brown_block_2 is clear, and I have no block in hand.
2. Can I put down brown_block_2? Yes, I'm holding it.
3. Can I unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1? Yes, blue_block_1 is clear and I don't have any block in hand.
4. Can I put down blue_block_1? Yes, I'm holding it.
5. Can I pick up yellow_block_1? Yes, it's clear and on the table, and I have no block in hand.
6. Can I stack yellow_block_1 on top of blue_block_1? Yes, I'm holding yellow_block_1 and blue_block_1 is clear.
7. Can I unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1? Yes, yellow_block_1 is clear and I have no block in hand.
8. Can I put down yellow_block_1? Yes, I'm holding it.
9. Can I unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1? Yes, red_block_1 is clear and I have no block in hand.

Hmm, but I just realized we might be able to make the plan more efficient. We can remove some unnecessary steps. Let's try again:

My optimized plan:
1. Unstack brown_block_2 from blue_block_1 (brown_block_2 is clear and I have no block in hand)
2. Put down brown_block_2 on the table (I'm holding brown_block_2)
3. Unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (blue_block_1 is clear and I have no block in hand)
4. Put down blue_block_1 on the table (I'm holding blue_block_1)
5. Pick up yellow_block_1 from the table (yellow_block_1 is clear, on the table, and I have no block in hand)
6. Stack yellow_block_1 on top of blue_block_1 (I'm holding yellow_block_1 and blue_block_1 is clear)
7. Unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1 (I need to unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1 first. But wait, that's not possible because I'm still holding a block after stacking yellow_block_1 on blue_block_1).

Ok, I need to go back and think about this more carefully.

After step 6, I'm no longer holding any block (as per the effects of the stack action). So, I can unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1 immediately after step 6.

My corrected optimized plan:
1. Unstack brown_block_2 from blue_block_1
2. Put down brown_block_2 on the table
3. Unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1
4. Put down blue_block_1 on the table
5. Pick up yellow_block_1 from the table
6. Stack yellow_block_1 on top of blue_block_1
7. Unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1

This gives us 7 steps. But I'm worried about the constraint. Let's double-check:
- grey_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1 in the initial state and throughout the execution (it remains on the table)
- yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1 after step 6, satisfying the second part of the second constraint

I think our plan is valid and that's an optimal plan with 7 steps. Let's finalize it:

```
unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1
putdown brown_block_2
unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
pickup yellow_block_1
stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
```

Oh, one more check. I realized that I don't necessarily have to swap the positions of blue_block_1 and yellow_block_1. I just need to ensure that yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1 at some point, after which I can put them anywhere (or just leave them be). Let's see if that reduces our steps:

1. Unstack brown_block_2 from blue_block_1
2. Put down brown_block_2 on the table
3. Unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1
4. Stack blue_block_1 on top of some other clear block, let's say brown_block_1
5. Pick up yellow_block_1 from the table
6. Stack yellow_block_1 on top of blue_block_1
7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1
8. Put down yellow_block_1 on the table
9. Unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1

This gives us 9 steps, which is worse than our previous plan. So let's stick with the 7-step plan.

The constraint says `"If expression "grey_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1" holds in some state s, then expression "yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1" must hold at s or at some state after s"`.

I think our plan satisfies this constraint because:
1. "grey_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1" holds in the initial state.
2. "yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1" holds after we execute step 6 of our plan.

So, our 7-step plan is valid and optimal.

Okay, let's double-check the plan one more time:

1. Unstack brown_block_2 from blue_block_1 (brown_block_2 is clear and I have no block in hand)
2. Put down brown_block_2 on the table (I'm holding brown_block_2)
3. Unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (blue_block_1 is clear and I have no block in hand)
4. Put down blue_block_1 on the table (I'm holding blue_block_1)
5. Pick up yellow_block_1 from the table (yellow_block_1 is clear, on the table, and I have no block in hand)
6. Stack yellow_block_1 on top of blue_block_1 (I'm holding yellow_block_1 and blue_block_1 is clear)
7. Unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1 (red_block_1 is clear and I have no block in hand)

This gives us 7 steps and satisfies the constraint because "yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1" holds after we execute step 6.

Actually, I am thinking more carefully about the constraint, and I'm not sure if I interpreted it correctly. 

Let's restate the constraint:
"If expression 'grey_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1' must hold at s or at some state after s."

Given that in our initial state, grey_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1, the constraint requires that yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1 either in the initial state or in some state after. However, in the initial state, brown_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1, and blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, so we don't satisfy the constraint in the initial state. This means we must ensure that yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1 at some point during execution.

I think our plan does ensure this. Let's evaluate what's happening in the plan step by step:

Initial state:
- white_block_1 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- brown_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
- red_block_1, brown_block_1, grey_block_1, brown_block_2 are clear
- no block is being held

Step 1: Unstack brown_block_2 from blue_block_1
- Now I am holding brown_block_2
- blue_block_1 is clear
- Everything else remains the same

Step 2: Putdown brown_block_2
- Now brown_block_2 is on the table
- I am not holding any block
- Everything else remains the same

Step 3: Unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1
- Now I am holding blue_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- Everything else remains the same

Step 4: Putdown blue_block_1
- Now blue_block_1 is on the table
- I am not holding any block
- Everything else remains the same

Step 5: Pickup yellow_block_1
- Now I am holding yellow_block_1
- Everything else remains the same

Step 6: Stack yellow_block_1 on blue_block_1
- Now yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1 (satisfying the constraint)
- I am not holding any block
- Everything else remains the same

Step 7: Unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1
- Now I am holding red_block_1 (achieving the goal)
- white_block_1 is clear
- Everything else remains the same

So, our 7-step plan is valid and satisfies the constraint. I believe it's the optimal plan for this problem.

Actually, is this really the optimal plan? Let's double-check by seeing if there's a shorter valid plan.

Is there any shorter way to achieve the goal of holding red_block_1 while satisfying the constraint that yellow_block_1 must be on top of blue_block_1 at some point?

Let's think about it. In the initial state, red_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and is clear, so we could directly unstack it. But that would not satisfy the constraint since we need yellow_block_1 to be on top of blue_block_1 at some point.

Could we unstack red_block_1 first, then satisfy the constraint? Let's see:

1. Unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1 (Now I am holding red_block_1)
2. Putdown red_block_1 (Now red_block_1 is on the table and I am not holding any block)
3. Unstack brown_block_2 from blue_block_1 (Now I am holding brown_block_2 and blue_block_1 is clear)
4. Putdown brown_block_2 (Now brown_block_2 is on the table and I am not holding any block)
5. Unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (Now I am holding blue_block_1 and yellow_block_1 is clear)
6. Putdown blue_block_1 (Now blue_block_1 is on the table and I am not holding any block)
7. Pickup yellow_block_1 (Now I am holding yellow_block_1)
8. Stack yellow_block_1 on blue_block_1 (Now yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1, satisfying the constraint, and I am not holding any block)
9. Pickup red_block_1 (Now I am holding red_block_1, achieving the goal)

This gives us 9 steps, which is worse than our 7-step plan.

Let's try another approach:

1. Unstack brown_block_2 from blue_block_1 (Now I am holding brown_block_2 and blue_block_1 is clear)
2. Putdown brown_block_2 (Now brown_block_2 is on the table and I am not holding any block)
3. Unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (Now I am holding blue_block_1 and yellow_block_1 is clear)
4. Putdown blue_block_1 (Now blue_block_1 is on the table and I am not holding any block)
5. Pickup yellow_block_1 (Now I am holding yellow_block_1)
6. Stack yellow_block_1 on blue_block_1 (Now yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1, satisfying the constraint, and I am not holding any block)
7. Unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1 (Now I am holding red_block_1, achieving the goal)

This gives us 7 steps, which matches our previously determined optimal plan.

I will now double-check if there's any way to further optimize this. 

Actually, let's reconsider the constraint:
"If expression 'grey_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1' must hold at s or at some state after s."

In our initial state, grey_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1, so the constraint requires that yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1 either in the initial state or in some state after. However, in the initial state, yellow_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1. This means we must ensure that yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1 at some point during execution.

Given that we need to satisfy the constraint and achieve the goal of holding red_block_1, I think our 7-step plan is the optimal one. Here's the final plan:

```
unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1
putdown brown_block_2
unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
pickup yellow_block_1
stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
```

But wait, there's another solution I'd like to check: placing grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_1. This would negate the first part of the conditional constraint, effectively making the second part irrelevant. Let's see if this approach yields a shorter plan.

Actually, I realize this approach doesn't work. The constraint states:
"If expression 'grey_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1' must hold at s or at some state after s."

Given that 'grey_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1' holds in the initial state (since grey_block_1 is on the table and not on top of blue_block_1), we must ensure that 'yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1' holds at some point during the execution. Even if we were to place grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_1 at a later state, we would still need to satisfy the constraint because of the initial state.

So, our 7-step plan is the optimal solution for this problem:

```
unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1
putdown brown_block_2
unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
pickup yellow_block_1
stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
```

Actually, now that I think more about it, I realize I have been misunderstanding the constraint. The constraint says:

"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'grey_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1'"

This means there must be at least one state where grey_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1. This is trivially satisfied since in the initial state, grey_block_1 is on the table and not on top of blue_block_1.

"If expression 'grey_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1' must hold at s or at some state after s."

This means that for every state where 'grey_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1' holds, there must be a state (either the same state or a later one) where 'yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1' holds.

Given that 'grey_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1' holds in the initial state, we must ensure that 'yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1' holds at some point during the execution.

Our 7-step plan ensures this, so it's valid. And I believe it's also the optimal plan for this problem.

Let's double-check the plan one more time:

1. Unstack brown_block_2 from blue_block_1 (brown_block_2 is clear and I have no block in hand)
2. Put down brown_block_2 on the table (I'm holding brown_block_2)
3. Unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (blue_block_1 is clear and I have no block in hand)
4. Put down blue_block_1 on the table (I'm holding blue_block_1)
5. Pick up yellow_block_1 from the table (yellow_block_1 is clear, on the table, and I have no block in hand)
6. Stack yellow_block_1 on top of blue_block_1 (I'm holding yellow_block_1 and blue_block_1 is clear)
7. Unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1 (red_block_1 is clear and I have no block in hand)

This gives us 7 steps and satisfies the constraint because "yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1" holds after we execute step 6.

I think we're good to go with our 7-step plan.

Let's just double-check from scratch one more time if this plan is correct and that we haven't missed anything.

Initial state:
- white_block_1 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- brown_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
- red_block_1, brown_block_1, grey_block_1, brown_block_2 are clear
- no block is being held

Goal: you are holding red_block_1

Constraint:
"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'grey_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1'"

"If expression 'grey_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1' must hold at s or at some state after s."

Our plan:

1. Unstack brown_block_2 from blue_block_1
2. Putdown brown_block_2
3. Unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1
4. Putdown blue_block_1
5. Pickup yellow_block_1
6. Stack yellow_block_1 on blue_block_1
7. Unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1

Let's validate this plan:

1. Can I unstack brown_block_2 from blue_block_1? Yes, brown_block_2 is clear, it's on top of blue_block_1, and I have no block in hand.
2. Can I putdown brown_block_2? Yes, I'm holding it.
3. Can I unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1? Yes, blue_block_1 is clear, it's on top of yellow_block_1, and I have no block in hand.
4. Can I putdown blue_block_1? Yes, I'm holding it.
5. Can I pickup yellow_block_1? Yes, it's clear, on the table, and I have no block in hand.
6. Can I stack yellow_block_1 on blue_block_1? Yes, I'm holding yellow_block_1 and blue_block_1 is clear.
7. Can I unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1? Yes, red_block_1 is clear, it's on top of white_block_1, and I have no block in hand.

Does this plan satisfy the constraint?
- grey_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1 in the initial state, so the first part of the constraint is satisfied.
- Since grey_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1 in the initial state, we need to ensure that yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1 at some point. This happens after step 6, so the second part of the constraint is also satisfied.

Does this plan achieve the goal?
- After step 7, I am holding red_block_1, so the goal is achieved.

So yes, our 7-step plan is valid. Let's check if there's any way to further optimize it:

Can I directly unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1 without satisfying the constraint? No, because the constraint requires that yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1 at some point, which isn't satisfied in the initial state.

Can I place grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_1 to negate the constraint? No, that would still require us to modify the state, and the constraint would still be in effect due to the initial state.

Can I achieve the goal with fewer steps? I don't think so, given the constraint.

So, our 7-step plan is the optimal solution for this problem:

```
unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1
putdown brown_block_2
unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
pickup yellow_block_1
stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
```

Let me see if I can optimize the plan even further. Actually, I wonder if I can just pick up and place grey_block_1 on blue_block_1 to make the constraint inapplicable. But I realize that this isn't correct because the constraint "if P then Q" means that for every state where P is true, Q must also be true (either in that state or a later one). In the initial state, P is true (grey_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1), so Q must also be true at some point (yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1). Even if we make P false in a later state (by placing grey_block_1 on top of blue_block_1), the constraint would still be in effect due to the initial state.

I think our 7-step plan is the optimal solution for this problem:

```
unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1
putdown brown_block_2
unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
pickup yellow_block_1
stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
```

I've checked and validated it multiple times, and I'm quite confident it's the correct optimal plan.
