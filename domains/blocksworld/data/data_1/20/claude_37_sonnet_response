Alright, I have a Blocksworld planning problem with specific blocks and actions. Let me break down the problem:

**Initial State:**
- green_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- red_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1
- purple_block_3 is on top of red_block_1
- blue_block_1 is clear
- purple_block_2 is clear
- purple_block_3 is clear
- I'm not holding any block

Visualized:
```
   purple_block_2      blue_block_1      purple_block_3
        |                   |                 |
   purple_block_1      white_block_1      red_block_1
        |
   green_block_1
```

**Goal:**
- red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_3

**Constraint:**
- At some point in the plan, I must hold blue_block_1

To achieve the goal, I need to rearrange the blocks. 

First, to move red_block_1 on top of purple_block_3, I need to unstack purple_block_3 from red_block_1, and then place red_block_1 on purple_block_3 (which requires first picking up red_block_1 from the table). But because of the constraint, I also need to pick up blue_block_1 at some point in my plan.

Let's plan step by step:

1. First, I need to unstack purple_block_3 from red_block_1. This will make red_block_1 clear and I will be holding purple_block_3.
2. I need to put purple_block_3 somewhere (on the table or on another block) before I can pickup red_block_1.
3. At some point, I need to unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 and hold it (to satisfy the constraint).

Let's create a plan:

1. Unstack purple_block_3 from red_block_1.
2. Putdown purple_block_3 on the table.
3. Pickup red_block_1 from the table.
4. Stack red_block_1 on purple_block_3.

Hmm, but I still need to satisfy the constraint of holding blue_block_1 at some point. Let's adjust the plan:

1. Unstack purple_block_3 from red_block_1.
2. Putdown purple_block_3 on the table.
3. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1.
4. Putdown blue_block_1 on the table.
5. Pickup red_block_1 from the table.
6. Stack red_block_1 on purple_block_3.

This plan ensures that I hold blue_block_1 at some point (after step 3).

Actually, let me check if this plan works:

**Step 1:** Unstack purple_block_3 from red_block_1.
- Preconditions: 
  - purple_block_3 is on top of red_block_1 ✓
  - purple_block_3 is clear ✓
  - I'm not holding any block ✓
- Effects: 
  - I'm holding purple_block_3
  - red_block_1 is clear

**Step 2:** Putdown purple_block_3 on the table.
- Preconditions:
  - I'm holding purple_block_3 ✓
- Effects:
  - purple_block_3 is on the table
  - purple_block_3 is clear
  - I'm not holding any block

**Step 3:** Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1.
- Preconditions:
  - blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 ✓
  - blue_block_1 is clear ✓
  - I'm not holding any block ✓
- Effects:
  - I'm holding blue_block_1
  - white_block_1 is clear

**Step 4:** Putdown blue_block_1 on the table.
- Preconditions:
  - I'm holding blue_block_1 ✓
- Effects:
  - blue_block_1 is on the table
  - blue_block_1 is clear
  - I'm not holding any block

**Step 5:** Pickup red_block_1 from the table.
- Preconditions:
  - red_block_1 is on the table ✓
  - red_block_1 is clear ✓
  - I'm not holding any block ✓
- Effects:
  - I'm holding red_block_1
  - red_block_1 is not on the table

**Step 6:** Stack red_block_1 on purple_block_3.
- Preconditions:
  - I'm holding red_block_1 ✓
  - purple_block_3 is clear ✓
- Effects:
  - red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_3
  - red_block_1 is clear
  - purple_block_3 is not clear
  - I'm not holding any block

Great! The plan seems to work. Let me summarize the final plan:

```
unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
putdown purple_block_3
unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
pickup red_block_1
stack red_block_1 purple_block_3
```

Let me double-check what the preconditions and effects are for each action:

1. "pickup x": Pick up block x from the table.
   - Preconditions: 
     - Block x is clear (no block on top of it).
     - Block x is on the table.
     - I'm not holding any block.
   - Effects:
     - I'm holding block x.
     - Block x is no longer on the table.

2. "putdown x": Place block x on the table.
   - Preconditions:
     - I'm currently holding block x.
   - Effects:
     - Block x is on the table.
     - Block x is clear.
     - I'm no longer holding any block.

3. "stack x y": Place block x on top of block y.
   - Preconditions:
     - I'm currently holding block x.
     - Block y is clear.
   - Effects:
     - Block x is on top of block y.
     - Block x is clear.
     - Block y is no longer clear.
     - I'm no longer holding any block.

4. "unstack x y": Pick up block x from the top of block y.
   - Preconditions:
     - Block x is on top of block y.
     - Block x is clear.
     - I'm not currently holding any block.
   - Effects:
     - I'm holding block x.
     - Block x is no longer on top of block y.
     - Block y is clear.

Yes, the plan still seems valid, and it satisfies both the goal (getting red_block_1 on top of purple_block_3) and the constraint (at some point, I hold blue_block_1). I'm confident this is an optimal plan, as I can't see any way to achieve both the goal and the constraint in fewer steps.

Actually, I just realized that this might not be the most optimal plan. Let me rethink.

To achieve the goal (red_block_1 on top of purple_block_3), I need at least these steps:
1. Unstack purple_block_3 from red_block_1.
2. Putdown/Stack purple_block_3 somewhere.
3. Pickup red_block_1.
4. Stack red_block_1 on purple_block_3.

That's a minimum of 4 steps, but I also need to handle blue_block_1 to satisfy the constraint. If I can integrate the steps for blue_block_1 with those for achieving the goal, I might get a more optimal plan. Let's see:

Wait, if I place red_block_1 on top of blue_block_1 (temporarily), and then unstack red_block_1 from blue_block_1 as an intermediate step, I would have held blue_block_1 at some point. That doesn't seem correct; the constraint requires that I hold blue_block_1, not that red_block_1 be on blue_block_1.

I think my original plan is optimal. Let's double-check the exact wording of the constraint.

"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are holding blue_block_1'"

Yes, the constraint requires that I hold blue_block_1 at some point during the execution of the plan.

But can I further optimize the original plan?

Let's consider another approach: what if, after unstacking purple_block_3 from red_block_1 and putting it down, I pick up blue_block_1 and stack it on red_block_1 (instead of putting it down on the table)? Then I would still need to unstack blue_block_1 from red_block_1 before picking up red_block_1. That would result in:

1. Unstack purple_block_3, red_block_1
2. Putdown purple_block_3
3. Unstack blue_block_1, white_block_1
4. Stack blue_block_1, red_block_1
5. Unstack blue_block_1, red_block_1
6. Putdown blue_block_1
7. Pickup red_block_1
8. Stack red_block_1, purple_block_3

That's 8 steps, which is more than the 6 steps in my original plan. So stacking blue_block_1 on red_block_1 doesn't lead to a more optimal plan.

What about skipping the putdown for blue_block_1 and directly stacking it somewhere else? Let's see:

1. Unstack purple_block_3, red_block_1
2. Putdown purple_block_3
3. Unstack blue_block_1, white_block_1
4. Stack blue_block_1, purple_block_3
5. Pickup red_block_1
6. Stack red_block_1, blue_block_1

This is 6 steps, but now red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1 which is on top of purple_block_3. The goal wants red_block_1 directly on top of purple_block_3. So this doesn't achieve the desired goal.

Instead, what if I stack blue_block_1 on another block after unstacking it and then continue with the plan?

1. Unstack purple_block_3, red_block_1
2. Putdown purple_block_3
3. Unstack blue_block_1, white_block_1
4. Stack blue_block_1, green_block_1 (or any other clear block)
5. Pickup red_block_1
6. Stack red_block_1, purple_block_3

This is still 6 steps, so not more optimal, though it achieves the goal and the constraint. However, let's ensure green_block_1 (or any other block I choose) is actually clear.

In the initial state, green_block_1 is supporting purple_block_1, which in turn supports purple_block_2. So green_block_1 is not clear. Let's stick with the original plan, where after unstacking blue_block_1, I put it down on the table.

Another idea: what if I stack purple_block_3 on blue_block_1 after I putdown purple_block_3?

1. Unstack purple_block_3, red_block_1
2. Putdown purple_block_3
3. Unstack blue_block_1, white_block_1
4. Stack blue_block_1, purple_block_3
5. Pickup red_block_1
6. Stack red_block_1, blue_block_1

But this doesn't achieve the goal either (red_block_1 would be on top of blue_block_1, not purple_block_3).

Let's try another approach. What if I stack red_block_1 on blue_block_1 temporarily, then unstack red_block_1 and then stack it on purple_block_3?

1. Unstack purple_block_3, red_block_1
2. Putdown purple_block_3
3. Unstack blue_block_1, white_block_1
4. Putdown blue_block_1
5. Pickup red_block_1
6. Stack red_block_1, blue_block_1
7. Unstack red_block_1, blue_block_1
8. Stack red_block_1, purple_block_3

But this is 8 steps, which is more than the original 6 steps.

I'm convinced that the original plan is optimal:

```
unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
putdown purple_block_3
unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
pickup red_block_1
stack red_block_1 purple_block_3
```

But wait, there's another approach that might work. What if, after unstacking purple_block_3 and blue_block_1, I pick up red_block_1 and stack it on purple_block_3 without putting down blue_block_1? That would require fewer steps:

1. Unstack purple_block_3, red_block_1
2. Putdown purple_block_3
3. Unstack blue_block_1, white_block_1

No, I realized this doesn't make sense. After step 3, I'm already holding blue_block_1, so I can't pick up red_block_1 unless I first put down blue_block_1. The original plan is correct.

Actually, let me try a different approach. What if I first unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 and hold it, then put it down, and then proceed with the remaining steps?

1. Unstack blue_block_1, white_block_1
2. Putdown blue_block_1
3. Unstack purple_block_3, red_block_1
4. Putdown purple_block_3
5. Pickup red_block_1
6. Stack red_block_1, purple_block_3

Still the same number of steps, but in a different order. I don't think I can reduce the number of steps further, but are there other ways to satisfy the goal and constraint? Let's think.

OK, let's step back. The basic steps for achieving the goal (red_block_1 on top of purple_block_3) are:

1. Remove purple_block_3 from red_block_1.
2. Place purple_block_3 somewhere (other than on red_block_1).
3. Pick up red_block_1.
4. Stack red_block_1 on purple_block_3.

These are 4 steps. To satisfy the constraint, I need to hold blue_block_1 at some point. That requires:

5. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1.
6. Either putdown blue_block_1 or stack it somewhere.

That's 2 more steps, for a total of 6. I can't see any way to reduce this number. The optimal number of steps to achieve the goal and satisfy the constraint is 6. The different variants I explored all require 6 steps.

Therefore, my original plan is optimal:

```
unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
putdown purple_block_3
unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
pickup red_block_1
stack red_block_1 purple_block_3
```

Wait, let me see if there might be a different plan I failed to consider:

1. First, I unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 and hold it. This ensures the constraint is met.
2. I could stack blue_block_1 on some (clear) block, or put it down on the table. Let's say I putdown blue_block_1 for simplicity.
3. Then I unstack purple_block_3 from red_block_1 and either putdown purple_block_3 or stack it on some (clear) block (not red_block_1, as that wouldn't change the state of the world, thus creating a loop). Let's say I putdown purple_block_3 for simplicity.
4. Next, I pickup red_block_1 from the table.
5. Finally, I stack red_block_1 on purple_block_3 to achieve the goal.

This is still 5 steps (not counting the first unstack step, which I've already determined is necessary to satisfy the constraint), so 6 steps in total. I believe 6 steps is the optimal solution.

Let's finalize the plan in the format requested:

```
unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
putdown purple_block_3
unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
pickup red_block_1
stack red_block_1 purple_block_3
```

Or, if we choose to start with blue_block_1:

```
unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
putdown purple_block_3
pickup red_block_1
stack red_block_1 purple_block_3
```

Both plans are optimal.

Actually, let me check one more thing. I've been assuming that the minimum number of steps to satisfy the goal alone is 4, and the minimum number of steps to satisfy the constraint alone is 2, which is a total of 6. But maybe there's a more interleaved plan that requires fewer steps.

After I unstack purple_block_3 from red_block_1 and putdown purple_block_3, I unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1. At this point, I can't stack blue_block_1 directly onto red_block_1, as the immediate next step would be to pick up red_block_1 to stack it on purple_block_3. But that would mean blue_block_1 is in the way.

So it seems like I can't interleave the steps for the goal and the constraint in a more efficient way. I stand by the 6-step plans above:

Option 1:
```
unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
putdown purple_block_3
unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
pickup red_block_1
stack red_block_1 purple_block_3
```

Option 2:
```
unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
putdown purple_block_3
pickup red_block_1
stack red_block_1 purple_block_3
```

Since both are 6 steps, both are optimal. I'll go with Option 1, as it was the first one I devised.

```
unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
putdown purple_block_3
unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
pickup red_block_1
stack red_block_1 purple_block_3
```

This is the optimal plan. It achieves the goal (red_block_1 on top of purple_block_3) and satisfies the constraint (hold blue_block_1 at some point) in 6 steps, which is the minimum number of steps required.
