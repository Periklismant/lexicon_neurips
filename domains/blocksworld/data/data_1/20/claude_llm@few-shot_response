I'll solve this planning problem step by step.

First, let me analyze the initial state and goal:

Initial state:
- green_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_1 on it and purple_block_2 on top
- white_block_1 is on the table with blue_block_1 on it
- red_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_3 on it
- blue_block_1, purple_block_2, and purple_block_3 are clear
- The arm is empty

Goal:
- red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_3

Constraint:
- At some point, I must be holding blue_block_1

To achieve the goal, I need to:
1. Pick up red_block_1 from the table
2. Stack it on purple_block_3

But I also need to satisfy the constraint of holding blue_block_1 at some point. Since blue_block_1 is clear in the initial state, I can unstack it, hold it, and then put it back.

Here's my plan:

```
unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
pickup red_block_1
stack red_block_1 purple_block_3
```

This plan:
1. Unstacks blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (satisfying the constraint of holding blue_block_1)
2. Puts blue_block_1 on the table
3. Unstacks purple_block_3 from red_block_1
4. Picks up red_block_1 from the table
5. Stacks red_block_1 on purple_block_3 (achieving the goal)

This is an optimal plan with 5 actions.
