Let's break down the problem step by step to find an optimal plan that satisfies the goal and the constraints.

### Initial State:
- green_block_1: on table, has purple_block_1 on top, which in turn has purple_block_2 on top (purple_block_2 is clear).
- white_block_1: on table, has blue_block_1 on top (blue_block_1 is clear).
- red_block_1: on table, has purple_block_3 on top (purple_block_3 is clear).
- The arm is empty.

### Goal:
- red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_3.

### Constraints:
- At least one state must have "you are holding blue_block_1".

### Observations:
1. The goal requires moving red_block_1 on top of purple_block_3. Currently, purple_block_3 is on top of red_block_1, so we need to unstack purple_block_3 from red_block_1 first.
2. The constraint requires holding blue_block_1 at some point. Since blue_block_1 is currently on white_block_1 and is clear, we can unstack it.

### Plan:
1. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 to satisfy the constraint (now holding blue_block_1).
2. Put down blue_block_1 on the table to free the arm.
3. Unstack purple_block_3 from red_block_1 (now holding purple_block_3).
4. Put down purple_block_3 on the table to free the arm.
5. Pick up red_block_1 from the table (now holding red_block_1).
6. Stack red_block_1 on purple_block_3 (goal achieved).

### Final Plan:
```
```
unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
putdown purple_block_3
pickup red_block_1
stack red_block_1 purple_block_3
```
```
