Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld problem. So, the initial state has several blocks arranged in specific ways, and the goal is to get red_block_1 on top of purple_block_3. Plus, there's a constraint that the robot must be holding blue_block_1 at least once in the plan.

First, let me visualize the initial setup. From the description:

- green_block_1 is on the table, with purple_block_1 on top of it, and then purple_block_2 on top of purple_block_1. Purple_block_2 is clear.
- white_block_1 is on the table with blue_block_1 on top, and blue_block_1 is clear.
- red_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_3 on top of it, and purple_block_3 is clear.

The goal is to have red_block_1 on top of purple_block_3. Wait, but initially, purple_block_3 is on red_block_1. So the goal is to reverse their positions. So we need to move red_block_1 from the table to be on top of purple_block_3. But currently, purple_block_3 is on red_block_1. So first, we need to remove purple_block_3 from red_block_1 to place red_block_1 on top of it.

So steps needed:

1. Unstack purple_block_3 from red_block_1. But to unstack, the robotic arm must be free. Since initially, the arm is empty, we can do unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1. That will make the arm hold purple_block_3, and red_block_1 becomes clear.

After unstacking, red_block_1 is clear and on the table, and we have purple_block_3 in the arm. Then, we need to putdown purple_block_3 somewhere so that we can pick up red_block_1 and stack it on purple_block_3.

Wait, but the goal is red_block_1 on top of purple_block_3. So after moving purple_block_3 off red_block_1, we need to place purple_block_3 somewhere else, then pick up red_block_1 and stack it onto purple_block_3. So perhaps:

- Unstack purple_block_3 from red_block_1.
- Putdown purple_block_3 on the table.
- Pickup red_block_1 (which is now clear).
- Stack red_block_1 on purple_block_3 (which is on the table and clear after putdown).

But wait, stacking red_block_1 on purple_block_3 requires that purple_block_3 is clear. After putting down purple_block_3, it's clear. So that's possible.

But there's also the constraint that the plan must include holding blue_block_1 at least once. Blue_block_1 is initially on top of white_block_1 and is clear. So the robot needs to pick it up at some point. So we need to include an action where the arm is holding blue_block_1. But how can we fit that into the plan without adding unnecessary steps?

Wait, the constraint is that in at least one state in the plan, the arm is holding blue_block_1. So we can do that by picking up blue_block_1 and then putting it back, but that adds steps. But the plan needs to be optimal, i.e., as short as possible. So we need to see if there's a way to incorporate that action without making the plan longer than necessary.

Let me think. The main steps needed for the goal are:

1. Remove purple_block_3 from red_block_1.
2. Place purple_block_3 somewhere (table or another block).
3. Pick up red_block_1 and stack it on purple_block_3.

So steps 1-3. But during this process, we can maybe pick up blue_block_1, hold it, and then put it back. But how to insert that without making the plan longer.

Alternatively, perhaps after handling purple_block_3, we can do something with blue_block_1 as part of the process. But that might complicate things.

Wait, let's outline the initial steps:

Current initial state:

- green_block_1: purple_block_1, purple_block_2 (clear)
- white_block_1: blue_block_1 (clear)
- red_block_1: purple_block_3 (clear)
- Arm is empty.

Goal:

- red_block_1 on purple_block_3.

So first, unstack purple_block_3 from red_block_1. Then put it down. Then pickup red_block_1 and stack onto purple_block_3.

But after unstacking purple_block_3 and putting it down, the arm is free to pick up red_block_1. But to stack red_block_1 on purple_block_3, we need to have purple_block_3 on the table and clear. So after putting down purple_block_3, that's the case.

But then, the steps would be:

1. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
2. putdown purple_block_3
3. pickup red_block_1
4. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

That's four actions, but we need to include holding blue_block_1. So where can we insert that?

The constraint requires that at least one state in the plan has the arm holding blue_block_1. So in the plan, at some point, the arm must perform pickup blue_block_1 or unstack it. But since blue_block_1 is on white_block_1 and is clear, we can pickup blue_block_1. However, if we do that, we need to put it down again, which would add two steps. But since the plan must be optimal (shortest possible), perhaps there's a way to do this without adding steps.

Wait, maybe during the process of moving purple_block_3 and red_block_1, we can hold blue_block_1 in between. Let's see.

Alternative approach:

After step 2 (putdown purple_block_3), instead of immediately picking up red_block_1, perhaps we can pick up blue_block_1, then put it down again, then proceed. But that would add two steps (pickup blue, putdown blue), making the total steps 6. But maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, after step 1 (unstack purple_block_3), can we stack it somewhere else, which requires holding it. Wait, after unstacking, we have purple_block_3 in the arm. Instead of putting it down, maybe stack it onto blue_block_1? But blue_block_1 is on white_block_1 and is clear. So we could do:

1. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
2. stack purple_block_3 blue_block_1
   - This requires that blue_block_1 is clear, which it is. Then stacking purple_block_3 on blue_block_1 would make purple_block_3 clear, and blue_block_1 not clear. Then, to get red_block_1 on purple_block_3, we need to move purple_block_3 again, which might complicate things.

Alternatively, after stacking purple_block_3 on blue_block_1, to then move red_block_1 onto purple_block_3, we need to unstack purple_block_3 from blue_block_1 again, which would require two more steps (unstack and putdown). That would make the plan longer. So that's not optimal.

Alternatively, after step 2 (stack purple_block_3 blue_block_1), then we can proceed to pick up red_block_1. But red_block_1 is on the table and clear. So steps:

3. pickup red_block_1
4. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3 (but purple_block_3 is on blue_block_1, which is on white_block_1. So stacking red_block_1 on purple_block_3 would require that purple_block_3 is clear. But after step 2, purple_block_3 is on blue_block_1 and is clear (since stacking sets the top block as clear). Wait, when you stack x on y, x becomes clear, and y is not. So after stacking purple_block_3 on blue_block_1, purple_block_3 is clear. Then, stacking red_block_1 on purple_block_3 would be possible.

Wait, but to stack red_block_1 on purple_block_3, we need to be holding red_block_1 and have purple_block_3 clear. After step 2, purple_block_3 is on blue_block_1 and is clear. So step 3: pickup red_block_1, then stack red_block_1 on purple_block_3.

But then, the final state would have red_block_1 on purple_block_3, which is on blue_block_1, which is on white_block_1. That's okay. But the goal is just red_block_1 on purple_block_3, regardless of where purple_block_3 is. So that would satisfy the goal. So this approach might work.

But in this case, the steps would be:

1. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
2. stack purple_block_3 blue_block_1
3. pickup red_block_1
4. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

But in step 2, when stacking purple_block_3 on blue_block_1, the arm is holding purple_block_3, and blue_block_1 is clear. So that's allowed. Then, after stacking, the arm is empty. Then step 3: pickup red_block_1 (which is on table and clear), stack it on purple_block_3 (which is now on blue_block_1 and clear). So that would work. And in this plan, when do we hold blue_block_1? We don't. So the constraint isn't met yet.

Ah, right. So in this approach, the constraint of holding blue_block_1 isn't met. So we need to include that. So perhaps we need to adjust the plan.

Alternative approach: Let's consider the initial plan (steps 1-4 as before) and then find a way to include holding blue_block_1.

Original plan without constraint:

1. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
2. putdown purple_block_3
3. pickup red_block_1
4. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

This gets the goal in 4 steps, but doesn't satisfy the constraint. So we need to insert steps where the arm holds blue_block_1. How?

Perhaps after step 2 (putdown purple_block_3), instead of picking up red_block_1 right away, we can:

3. pickup blue_block_1 (since it's on white_block_1 and clear)
4. putdown blue_block_1 (now blue_block_1 is back on table, clear)
5. pickup red_block_1
6. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

But this adds two steps (steps 3 and 4), making the total steps 6. But is there a way to do it in fewer steps?

Wait, maybe after step 1 (unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1), we can:

2. stack purple_block_3 blue_block_1 (as before)
3. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1 (but blue_block_1 has purple_block_3 on top now, so it's not clear. So can't unstack. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, after step 2 (stack purple_block_3 blue_block_1), we can:

3. unstack purple_block_3 blue_block_1 (but that requires the arm is empty. After step 2, the arm is empty. So step 3: unstack purple_block_3 blue_block_1 (since purple_block_3 is on blue_block_1 and clear). Then, holding purple_block_3 again. Then putdown, and proceed. But that's adding steps again.

Alternatively, after the initial plan steps 1-4, maybe we can insert the blue_block_1 pickup somewhere else. But that would require backtracking.

Wait, another idea: during the process, when we have the arm empty after step 2 (putdown purple_block_3), we can pickup blue_block_1, then immediately put it down again. Then proceed. That adds two steps but satisfies the constraint. However, the plan length would be 6, but maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, maybe during step 3 (pickup red_block_1), but before that, we need to hold blue_block_1. So let's see:

After step 2 (putdown purple_block_3), the arm is empty. Then:

3. pickup blue_block_1 (possible, since it's on white_block_1 and clear)
4. putdown blue_block_1 (now blue_block_1 is back on table, clear)
5. pickup red_block_1
6. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

That's six steps, which is longer than the original 4. But maybe there's a way to use the blue_block_1 in a way that's necessary for the plan. For example, if blue_block_1 is moved to allow stacking red_block_1 on purple_block_3. But I don't see how, since purple_block_3 is on the table in the original plan.

Alternatively, maybe after unstacking purple_block_3 and before putting it down, we can use the arm to hold blue_block_1. Let's see:

1. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
   - Arm is holding purple_block_3
2. stack purple_block_3 blue_block_1
   - Now, purple_block_3 is on blue_block_1, arm is empty
3. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
   - Can't do this because blue_block_1 has purple_block_3 on top, so it's not clear. So this action is invalid.
Hmm, that's not possible.

Alternative approach: Instead of moving purple_block_3 first, what if we first handle blue_block_1 to satisfy the constraint.

For example:

1. pickup blue_block_1 (from white_block_1, which is clear)
   - Now holding blue_block_1
2. putdown blue_block_1 (on table)
   - Now blue_block_1 is on table, clear. White_block_1 is still on table, but now clear (since blue_block_1 was removed)
3. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
4. putdown purple_block_3
5. pickup red_block_1
6. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

This plan has six steps. But the original plan without the constraint was four steps. But now, by including steps 1 and 2, we satisfy the constraint (holding blue_block_1 in step 1). But this plan is longer. However, maybe there's a way to optimize this.

Wait, after step 1 (pickup blue_block_1), instead of putting it down, can we use it in some way? For example, stack it somewhere else. But where? Maybe stack it on the table, which is just putdown. But that's the same as step 2. Alternatively, stack it on another block. Let's see.

After step 1 (pickup blue_block_1), the arm is holding it. Then:

2. stack blue_block_1 green_block_1 (if green_block_1 is clear. Wait, green_block_1 has purple_block_1 and purple_block_2 on top. So green_block_1 is not clear. Can't stack on it.

Alternatively, stack blue_block_1 on white_block_1 again. But that's where it was. But after picking it up, white_block_1 is clear. So stacking blue_block_1 back on white_block_1 would require that white_block_1 is clear, which it is. So:

1. pickup blue_block_1
2. stack blue_block_1 white_block_1
   - Now blue_block_1 is back where it was, so no change. But this would allow us to hold blue_block_1 in step 1, satisfying the constraint. Then steps 3-6 as before.

So the plan would be:

1. pickup blue_block_1
2. stack blue_block_1 white_block_1
3. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
4. putdown purple_block_3
5. pickup red_block_1
6. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

This is six steps. But steps 1 and 2 cancel each other, effectively putting blue_block_1 back where it was. But this satisfies the constraint of holding blue_block_1. But this plan is longer than necessary. Is there a way to do it in fewer steps?

Alternative idea: Use the unstack action to hold blue_block_1. Wait, blue_block_1 is on white_block_1. To unstack it, since blue_block_1 is clear (initial state), and the arm is empty, we can:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
   - Now holding blue_block_1
2. putdown blue_block_1
3. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
4. putdown purple_block_3
5. pickup red_block_1
6. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

Again, six steps, same as before. But maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, after unstacking blue_block_1 (step 1), instead of putting it down, maybe use it in a way that helps the plan. For example, stack it somewhere else. But where? Let's see:

After step 1: holding blue_block_1.

Step 2: stack blue_block_1 purple_block_3 (purple_block_3 is on red_block_1 and clear). So stacking blue_block_1 on purple_block_3 would require that purple_block_3 is clear. But purple_block_3 is on red_block_1 and is clear. So stacking is allowed. Then, after stacking, blue_block_1 is on purple_block_3, and the arm is empty.

Then, to proceed, we need to move purple_block_3. But now, purple_block_3 has blue_block_1 on top. So to unstack purple_block_3 from red_block_1, we need to first remove blue_block_1. So:

3. unstack blue_block_1 purple_block_3
4. putdown blue_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
6. putdown purple_block_3
7. pickup red_block_1
8. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

That's eight steps, which is worse. Not good.

Hmm. So the problem is that inserting the constraint requires additional steps, but the plan must be optimal. So maybe the minimal plan with the constraint is six steps. But wait, let's think again.

What if we can hold blue_block_1 during the process of moving purple_block_3. For example:

Original steps (without constraint):

1. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
2. putdown purple_block_3
3. pickup red_block_1
4. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

Now, after step 1, the arm is holding purple_block_3. If we can, instead of putting it down immediately, use it to stack on blue_block_1, but then need to unstack later. But that complicates things. Alternatively, after step 1, maybe pickup blue_block_1 while holding purple_block_3? No, because the arm can only hold one block. So that's impossible.

Alternatively, after step 2 (putdown purple_block_3), the arm is empty. Then, before step 3 (pickup red_block_1), we can:

3. pickup blue_block_1
4. putdown blue_block_1
5. pickup red_block_1
6. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

This is six steps, which includes holding blue_block_1. But maybe there's a way to combine steps. For example, after step 1 (unstack purple_block_3), instead of putting it down, can we stack it on blue_block_1, then pickup blue_block_1 (which now has purple_block_3 on top). But no, because blue_block_1 would not be clear.

Wait, after step 1: holding purple_block_3. Then step 2: stack purple_block_3 blue_block_1. Then step 3: unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1. But blue_block_1 now has purple_block_3 on top, so it's not clear. So can't unstack. So that's invalid.

Alternatively, after stacking purple_block_3 on blue_block_1, then pickup blue_block_1 is impossible because it's under purple_block_3. So no.

Another idea: Instead of moving purple_block_3 first, move blue_block_1 to satisfy the constraint early.

Plan:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1 (arm now holds blue_block_1)
2. stack blue_block_1 white_block_1 (put it back)
3. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
4. putdown purple_block_3
5. pickup red_block_1
6. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

This plan has six steps, and in step 1, the arm is holding blue_block_1, satisfying the constraint. But steps 1 and 2 are redundant, just to hold and put back. But maybe this is the minimal way to include the constraint. However, the user wants an optimal plan, which is as short as possible. So perhaps there's a way to do it in five steps.

Wait, let me check again. Maybe after unstacking purple_block_3 (step 1), we put it down (step 2), then pickup blue_block_1 (step 3), put it down (step 4), then pickup red_block_1 and stack (steps 5 and 6). That's six steps. But what if after step 3 (pickup blue_block_1), instead of putting it down, we stack it on purple_block_3, which is on the table. Then:

1. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
2. putdown purple_block_3
3. pickup blue_block_1
4. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_3
5. pickup red_block_1
6. stack red_block_1 blue_block_1

Wait, no. The goal is red_block_1 on purple_block_3. So after step 4, blue_block_1 is on purple_block_3. Then we need to move red_block_1 onto purple_block_3, but purple_block_3 has blue_block_1 on top. So that's not possible. So this approach doesn't work.

Alternatively, after step 3 (pickup blue_block_1), stack it elsewhere, but that would require more steps.

Hmm. It's looking like the minimal plan with the constraint is six steps. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, what if we integrate the constraint into the main steps. For example:

1. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
   - Hold purple_block_3
2. stack purple_block_3 blue_block_1
   - Now, blue_block_1 has purple_block_3 on top. Then, to satisfy the goal, we need to move red_block_1 onto purple_block_3. But purple_block_3 is on blue_block_1, which is on white_block_1. So to stack red_block_1 on purple_block_3, we need purple_block_3 to be clear, which it is after stacking. So:

3. pickup red_block_1
4. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

But this would place red_block_1 on purple_block_3, which is on blue_block_1. That satisfies the goal. So the steps are:

1. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
2. stack purple_block_3 blue_block_1
3. pickup red_block_1
4. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

This is four steps. But does this plan satisfy the constraint of holding blue_block_1? In this plan, the arm never holds blue_block_1. So the constraint is not met. So this plan is invalid.

So, we need to include holding blue_block_1. But in this plan, the arm holds purple_block_3 and red_block_1, but not blue_block_1.

Another approach: After stacking purple_block_3 on blue_block_1 (step 2), we can unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1. Wait, but blue_block_1 now has purple_block_3 on top, so it's not clear. So we can't unstack it. Thus, that's not possible.

Hmm. Maybe we can unstack blue_block_1 before stacking purple_block_3 on it. But that would require:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1 (holding blue_block_1)
2. putdown blue_block_1
3. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
4. stack purple_block_3 blue_block_1
5. pickup red_block_1
6. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

This plan has six steps. In step 1, the arm holds blue_block_1, satisfying the constraint. But after step 2, blue_block_1 is on the table. Then, step 4 stacks purple_block_3 on blue_block_1. Then, step 5 picks up red_block_1 and stacks on purple_block_3. This would result in red_block_1 on purple_block_3, which is on blue_block_1, which is on the table. That's acceptable, as the goal is just red_block_1 on purple_block_3. So the goal is achieved.

But wait, the initial position of blue_block_1 was on white_block_1, but after step 2, it's on the table. So the final state has blue_block_1 on the table. Does that matter? The problem's goal doesn't specify anything about blue_block_1's position, only about red_block_1 and purple_block_3. So that's acceptable.

This plan has six steps. But is there a shorter way?

Alternative plan:

1. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
2. stack purple_block_3 blue_block_1
3. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1 (invalid, since blue_block_1 has purple_block_3 on top)
So can't do that.

Alternative idea: After step 1 (unstack purple_block_3), instead of stacking it on blue_block_1, can we stack it elsewhere, like on green_block_1's tower. But green_block_1 has purple_block_1 and purple_block_2. The top is purple_block_2, which is clear. So:

1. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
2. stack purple_block_3 purple_block_2
   - Now, purple_block_3 is on purple_block_2, which is on purple_block_1, etc.
3. pickup red_block_1
4. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

But in this case, purple_block_3 is on purple_block_2 and is clear. Stacking red_block_1 on it is possible. But then, the goal is achieved. But where does the constraint come in? We need to hold blue_block_1. So in this plan, the arm never holds blue_block_1. So we need to add steps to pick it up.

So this plan is invalid.

Another idea: Let's combine moving blue_block_1 with the main steps. For example:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1 (holding blue_block_1)
2. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_3 (purple_block_3 is on red_block_1 and clear)
   - Now, blue_block_1 is on purple_block_3, which is on red_block_1.
3. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1 (but purple_block_3 has blue_block_1 on top, so not clear. Can't unstack.

So this doesn't work.

Alternatively:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
2. putdown blue_block_1
3. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
4. stack purple_block_3 blue_block_1
5. pickup red_block_1
6. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

This plan has six steps, and step 1 holds blue_block_1. This works, and the final state has red_block_1 on purple_block_3, which is on blue_block_1 on the table. The goal is satisfied. So this is a valid plan, and the constraint is met in step 1.

But is there a shorter plan? Let's count the steps again.

Another possible approach: Use the unstack action for blue_block_1, then use it in the process.

Plan:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1 (hold blue_block_1)
2. stack blue_block_1 red_block_1 (red_block_1 is on table and clear after step 1)
   - Now, blue_block_1 is on red_block_1, which is on table. But we need to get red_block_1 on purple_block_3. So then:

3. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1 (but red_block_1 has blue_block_1 on top. So purple_block_3 is on red_block_1, but red_block_1 is not clear. So this is invalid. Can't unstack.

No, that doesn't work.

Alternative idea: After step 1 (unstack blue_block_1), put it down, then proceed.

But that's what we did earlier. So seems like six steps is the minimal.

Wait, but let's see the initial plan without the constraint is four steps. With the constraint, we have to add two steps. Is there a way to do it in five steps?

For example:

1. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
2. putdown purple_block_3
3. pickup blue_block_1 (holding blue_block_1 satisfies the constraint)
4. putdown blue_block_1
5. pickup red_block_1
6. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

This is six steps. But what if after step 3, instead of putting down blue_block_1, we use it somehow. But how?

After step 3 (pickup blue_block_1), we're holding it. We need to stack red_block_1 on purple_block_3. To do that, we need to put down blue_block_1 first. So we have to do steps 4 and 5.

So no, that's still six steps.

Wait, but what if after step 3 (pickup blue_block_1), we stack it on purple_block_3, which is on the table. Then:

4. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_3
   - Now, purple_block_3 has blue_block_1 on top. Then, to stack red_block_1 on purple_block_3, we need to unstack blue_block_1, which requires steps. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, after step 3 (holding blue_block_1), stack it on red_block_1 (which is clear):

4. stack blue_block_1 red_block_1
5. unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1
6. putdown blue_block_1
7. pickup red_block_1
8. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

This is eight steps, which is worse.

Hmm. It's looking like the minimal plan with the constraint is six steps. But let's think differently. Maybe during the process of moving purple_block_3 and red_block_1, we can pick up blue_block_1 without adding steps.

For example:

Original steps:

1. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
2. putdown purple_block_3
3. pickup red_block_1
4. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

Constraint requires holding blue_block_1. What if after step 2, before step 3, we pickup blue_block_1 and then immediately put it down again. But that would add two steps. But maybe there's a way to combine the pickup with another action.

Wait, after step 2, the arm is empty. So:

3. pickup blue_block_1 (now holding blue_block_1)
4. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_3 (since purple_block_3 is on table and clear)
5. pickup red_block_1
6. stack red_block_1 blue_block_1

But this would result in red_block_1 on blue_block_1, which is on purple_block_3. But the goal requires red_block_1 on purple_block_3. So this doesn't satisfy the goal.

Alternatively:

After step 3 (pickup blue_block_1), instead of stacking, put it down. Then proceed.

But again, that's six steps.

Alternatively, after step 3 (pickup blue_block_1), use it as a temporary holder. For example:

4. stack blue_block_1 red_block_1 (but red_block_1 is on table and clear)
   - Now, blue_block_1 is on red_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1 is not possible because red_block_1 has blue_block_1 on top.

No, that's not helpful.

I think I'm stuck. It seems that the minimal plan with the constraint is six steps. So the answer would be:

```
1. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
2. putdown purple_block_3
3. pickup blue_block_1
4. putdown blue_block_1
5. pickup red_block_1
6. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3
```

But let's check if this satisfies all the preconditions.

Step 1: unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1. Preconditions: purple_block_3 is on red_block_1, clear, and arm is empty. Yes. After this, arm holds purple_block_3, red_block_1 is clear.

Step 2: putdown purple_block_3. Pre: holding purple_block_3. After, purple_block_3 is on table, clear.

Step 3: pickup blue_block_1. Pre: blue_block_1 is on white_block_1, clear, arm empty. Yes. After, arm holds blue_block_1.

Step 4: putdown blue_block_1. Pre: holding blue_block_1. After, blue_block_1 is on table, clear.

Step 5: pickup red_block_1. Pre: red_block_1 is on table, clear, arm empty. Yes.

Step 6: stack red_block_1 purple_block_3. Pre: holding red_block_1 and purple_block_3 is clear. Yes. After, red_block_1 is on purple_block_3.

This plan works and satisfies the constraint (step 3 holds blue_block_1). The length is six steps. But is there a shorter plan?

Wait, what if after step 1 (unstack purple_block_3), we immediately pickup blue_block_1, but the arm is holding purple_block_3. So we can't do that. So steps must be sequential.

Alternatively, after step 2 (putdown purple_block_3), the arm is empty. Then:

3. pickup blue_block_1 (step 3)
4. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_3 (step 4)
   - Now, blue_block_1 is on purple_block_3, which is on table. Then, to stack red_block_1 on purple_block_3, we need to unstack blue_block_1, but that requires steps. So:

5. unstack blue_block_1 purple_block_3 (step 5)
6. putdown blue_block_1 (step 6)
7. pickup red_block_1 (step 7)
8. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3 (step 8)

That's eight steps, which is worse.

Hmm. So back to the six-step plan. Let me check if there's a way to avoid putting down blue_block_1. For example:

1. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
2. stack purple_block_3 blue_block_1
   - Now, purple_block_3 is on blue_block_1. Arm is empty.
3. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1 (can't, because blue_block_1 has purple_block_3 on top, not clear)
So no.

Alternatively, after step 2 (stack purple_block_3 blue_block_1), the arm is empty. Then:

3. pickup blue_block_1 (can't, since blue_block_1 is under purple_block_3. Not clear.)

No.

So the six-step plan seems necessary. Therefore, the optimal plan with the constraint is six actions.
