I'll solve this planning problem step by step, considering the initial state, goal, and constraints.

Initial state:
- Yellow_block_1 is on the table with brown_block_2 on top of it
- Brown_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_1 on top, black_block_1 on top of purple_block_1, and green_block_1 on top of black_block_1
- Orange_block_1 is on the table and clear
- Clear blocks: brown_block_2, orange_block_1, green_block_1
- Robot arm is empty

Goal:
- Brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1

Constraint:
- At some point, we must have both "holding brown_block_2" AND "orange_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1"

Planning:
1. First, I need to free brown_block_1 by removing the stack on top of it
2. Then I need to place orange_block_1 on top of brown_block_1 to satisfy part of the constraint
3. I also need to pick up brown_block_2 while orange_block_1 is on brown_block_1
4. Finally, I need to place brown_block_1 on top of orange_block_1 to achieve the goal

Let me create the plan:

```
unstack green_block_1 black_block_1
putdown green_block_1
unstack black_block_1 purple_block_1
putdown black_block_1
unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
putdown purple_block_1
pickup orange_block_1
stack orange_block_1 brown_block_1
unstack brown_block_2 yellow_block_1
putdown brown_block_2
pickup brown_block_1
stack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
```
