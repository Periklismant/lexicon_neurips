I need to find a sequence of actions to achieve the goal: "brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1".

Additionally, we have a constraint that at some point, we must have a state where both of these conditions are true:
1. "you are holding brown_block_2"
2. "orange_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1"

Let's start by analyzing the initial state and understanding how the world looks:

Initial state:
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1
- purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
- black_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1
- green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_2 is clear
- orange_block_1 is clear
- green_block_1 is clear
- You are not holding any block

Visualization:
```
    green_block_1        brown_block_2        orange_block_1
          |                    |
    black_block_1              |
          |                    |
    purple_block_1             |
          |                    |
    brown_block_1        yellow_block_1
    (on table)           (on table)        (on table)
```

Goal state:
- brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1

Constraint:
At some point, we must have:
- You are holding brown_block_2
- orange_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1

Let's think about this step by step.

1. To achieve the goal, we need to move brown_block_1 onto orange_block_1, but brown_block_1 has blocks stacked on it, so we need to clear it first.

2. For the constraint, we need to make sure that at some point, orange_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 while we are holding brown_block_2.

Let me plan this out:

First, let's handle getting to a state where orange_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1:
1. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_1
2. Putdown green_block_1
3. Unstack black_block_1 from purple_block_1
4. Putdown black_block_1
5. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_1
6. Putdown purple_block_1
7. Pickup orange_block_1
8. Stack orange_block_1 on brown_block_1

Now, to satisfy the constraint, we need to be holding brown_block_2 while orange_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1:
9. Unstack brown_block_2 from yellow_block_1 (Now we're holding brown_block_2 and orange_block_1 is on brown_block_1, satisfying the constraint)

Now, to achieve the final goal (brown_block_1 on orange_block_1), we need to:
10. Putdown brown_block_2
11. Unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_1
12. Putdown orange_block_1
13. Pickup brown_block_1
14. Stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_1

Let's ensure this plan is valid by checking each step:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_1
   Preconditions: green_block_1 is on black_block_1, green_block_1 is clear, not holding any block ✓
   Effects: Holding green_block_1, green_block_1 not on black_block_1, black_block_1 is clear ✓

2. Putdown green_block_1
   Preconditions: Holding green_block_1 ✓
   Effects: green_block_1 on table, green_block_1 is clear, not holding any block ✓

3. Unstack black_block_1 from purple_block_1
   Preconditions: black_block_1 is on purple_block_1, black_block_1 is clear, not holding any block ✓
   Effects: Holding black_block_1, black_block_1 not on purple_block_1, purple_block_1 is clear ✓

4. Putdown black_block_1
   Preconditions: Holding black_block_1 ✓
   Effects: black_block_1 on table, black_block_1 is clear, not holding any block ✓

5. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_1
   Preconditions: purple_block_1 is on brown_block_1, purple_block_1 is clear, not holding any block ✓
   Effects: Holding purple_block_1, purple_block_1 not on brown_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear ✓

6. Putdown purple_block_1
   Preconditions: Holding purple_block_1 ✓
   Effects: purple_block_1 on table, purple_block_1 is clear, not holding any block ✓

7. Pickup orange_block_1
   Preconditions: orange_block_1 is on table, orange_block_1 is clear, not holding any block ✓
   Effects: Holding orange_block_1, orange_block_1 not on table ✓

8. Stack orange_block_1 on brown_block_1
   Preconditions: Holding orange_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear ✓
   Effects: orange_block_1 on brown_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear, brown_block_1 is not clear, not holding any block ✓

9. Unstack brown_block_2 from yellow_block_1
   Preconditions: brown_block_2 is on yellow_block_1, brown_block_2 is clear, not holding any block ✓
   Effects: Holding brown_block_2, brown_block_2 not on yellow_block_1, yellow_block_1 is clear ✓

  At this point, we have:
  - orange_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
  - we are holding brown_block_2
  
  This satisfies our constraint.

10. Putdown brown_block_2
    Preconditions: Holding brown_block_2 ✓
    Effects: brown_block_2 on table, brown_block_2 is clear, not holding any block ✓

11. Unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_1
    Preconditions: orange_block_1 is on brown_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear, not holding any block ✓
    Effects: Holding orange_block_1, orange_block_1 not on brown_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear ✓

12. Putdown orange_block_1
    Preconditions: Holding orange_block_1 ✓
    Effects: orange_block_1 on table, orange_block_1 is clear, not holding any block ✓

13. Pickup brown_block_1
    Preconditions: brown_block_1 is on table, brown_block_1 is clear, not holding any block ✓
    Effects: Holding brown_block_1, brown_block_1 not on table ✓

14. Stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_1
    Preconditions: Holding brown_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear ✓
    Effects: brown_block_1 on orange_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear, orange_block_1 is not clear, not holding any block ✓

This plan seems to work and achieves the goal while respecting the constraint.

Let me check if there's a more optimal plan:

Actually, I realize we don't need to put orange_block_1 on brown_block_1 and then move it back again. We can satisfy the constraint in a shorter way.

Let's try another approach:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_1
2. Putdown green_block_1
3. Unstack black_block_1 from purple_block_1
4. Putdown black_block_1
5. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_1
6. Putdown purple_block_1
7. Unstack brown_block_2 from yellow_block_1

Now we're holding brown_block_2. Let's put orange_block_1 on brown_block_1:

8. Putdown brown_block_2
9. Pickup orange_block_1
10. Stack orange_block_1 on brown_block_1

At this point:
- We've satisfied the constraint by having orange_block_1 on brown_block_1.
- We need to pick brown_block_2 back up to satisfy the other part of the constraint.

11. Unstack brown_block_2 from the table
(Wait, that's not a valid action. We can only unstack from another block, not from the table. Let's correct this.)

11. Pickup brown_block_2

Now, we have:
- orange_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
- we are holding brown_block_2

This satisfies our constraint. Let's continue to achieve the goal:

12. Putdown brown_block_2
13. Unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_1
14. Putdown orange_block_1
15. Pickup brown_block_1
16. Stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_1

This plan is still quite long. Let me check if there's a shorter path to achieve the goal while respecting the constraint...

Actually, there's an issue with the step "Unstack brown_block_2 from the table". We can't unstack from the table, we can only pickup from the table. Let me rethink this.

Let's try a different, more direct approach:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_1
2. Putdown green_block_1
3. Unstack black_block_1 from purple_block_1
4. Putdown black_block_1
5. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_1
6. Putdown purple_block_1
7. Pickup orange_block_1
8. Stack orange_block_1 on brown_block_1

At this point, we have orange_block_1 on top of brown_block_1. To satisfy the constraint, we need to hold brown_block_2:

9. Unstack brown_block_2 from yellow_block_1

Now we have:
- orange_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
- we are holding brown_block_2

This satisfies our constraint. To achieve the goal, we need to put brown_block_1 on top of orange_block_1:

10. Putdown brown_block_2
11. Unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_1
12. Putdown orange_block_1
13. Pickup brown_block_1
14. Stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_1

Let's verify this plan again:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_1
   Preconditions: green_block_1 is on black_block_1, green_block_1 is clear, not holding any block ✓
   Effects: Holding green_block_1, green_block_1 not on black_block_1, black_block_1 is clear ✓

2. Putdown green_block_1
   Preconditions: Holding green_block_1 ✓
   Effects: green_block_1 on table, green_block_1 is clear, not holding any block ✓

3. Unstack black_block_1 from purple_block_1
   Preconditions: black_block_1 is on purple_block_1, black_block_1 is clear, not holding any block ✓
   Effects: Holding black_block_1, black_block_1 not on purple_block_1, purple_block_1 is clear ✓

4. Putdown black_block_1
   Preconditions: Holding black_block_1 ✓
   Effects: black_block_1 on table, black_block_1 is clear, not holding any block ✓

5. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_1
   Preconditions: purple_block_1 is on brown_block_1, purple_block_1 is clear, not holding any block ✓
   Effects: Holding purple_block_1, purple_block_1 not on brown_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear ✓

6. Putdown purple_block_1
   Preconditions: Holding purple_block_1 ✓
   Effects: purple_block_1 on table, purple_block_1 is clear, not holding any block ✓

7. Pickup orange_block_1
   Preconditions: orange_block_1 is on table, orange_block_1 is clear, not holding any block ✓
   Effects: Holding orange_block_1, orange_block_1 not on table ✓

8. Stack orange_block_1 on brown_block_1
   Preconditions: Holding orange_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear ✓
   Effects: orange_block_1 on brown_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear, brown_block_1 is not clear, not holding any block ✓

9. Unstack brown_block_2 from yellow_block_1
   Preconditions: brown_block_2 is on yellow_block_1, brown_block_2 is clear, not holding any block ✓
   Effects: Holding brown_block_2, brown_block_2 not on yellow_block_1, yellow_block_1 is clear ✓

  At this point, we have:
  - orange_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
  - we are holding brown_block_2
  
  This satisfies our constraint.

10. Putdown brown_block_2
    Preconditions: Holding brown_block_2 ✓
    Effects: brown_block_2 on table, brown_block_2 is clear, not holding any block ✓

11. Unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_1
    Preconditions: orange_block_1 is on brown_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear, not holding any block ✓
    Effects: Holding orange_block_1, orange_block_1 not on brown_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear ✓

12. Putdown orange_block_1
    Preconditions: Holding orange_block_1 ✓
    Effects: orange_block_1 on table, orange_block_1 is clear, not holding any block ✓

13. Pickup brown_block_1
    Preconditions: brown_block_1 is on table, brown_block_1 is clear, not holding any block ✓
    Effects: Holding brown_block_1, brown_block_1 not on table ✓

14. Stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_1
    Preconditions: Holding brown_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear ✓
    Effects: brown_block_1 on orange_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear, orange_block_1 is not clear, not holding any block ✓

This plan seems to work and achieves the goal while respecting the constraint.

Actually, I think there's a more optimal approach. I'm overthinking this. The goal is to place "brown_block_1 on top of orange_block_1". We need to clear brown_block_1 first, then move it onto orange_block_1. Along the way, we need to satisfy the constraint of having "orange_block_1 on top of brown_block_1" while "holding brown_block_2".

Let's try a more direct approach:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_1
2. Putdown green_block_1
3. Unstack black_block_1 from purple_block_1
4. Putdown black_block_1
5. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_1
6. Putdown purple_block_1

Now brown_block_1 is clear. To satisfy the constraint, we need:
- orange_block_1 on top of brown_block_1
- holding brown_block_2

7. Pickup orange_block_1
8. Stack orange_block_1 on brown_block_1
9. Unstack brown_block_2 from yellow_block_1

At this point, the constraint is satisfied.

10. Stack brown_block_2 on orange_block_1 (now we have a tower: brown_block_1 -> orange_block_1 -> brown_block_2)
11. Unstack brown_block_2 from orange_block_1
12. Putdown brown_block_2
13. Unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_1
14. Putdown orange_block_1
15. Pickup brown_block_1
16. Stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_1

This plan is 16 steps long. Let's verify if it works:

Actually, I realize that after stacking orange_block_1 on brown_block_1, we can't directly pick up brown_block_1 because it's no longer clear. So we need to first remove orange_block_1, then move brown_block_1.

Let's try to simplify and optimize the plan:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_1
2. Putdown green_block_1
3. Unstack black_block_1 from purple_block_1
4. Putdown black_block_1
5. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_1
6. Putdown purple_block_1
7. Pickup orange_block_1
8. Stack orange_block_1 on brown_block_1
9. Unstack brown_block_2 from yellow_block_1

At this point, the constraint is satisfied:
- orange_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
- We are holding brown_block_2

10. Putdown brown_block_2
11. Unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_1
12. Putdown orange_block_1
13. Pickup brown_block_1
14. Stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_1

This plan achieves the goal in 14 steps. Let's verify each step:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_1
   Preconditions: green_block_1 is on black_block_1, green_block_1 is clear, not holding any block ✓
   Effects: Holding green_block_1, green_block_1 not on black_block_1, black_block_1 is clear ✓

2. Putdown green_block_1
   Preconditions: Holding green_block_1 ✓
   Effects: green_block_1 on table, green_block_1 is clear, not holding any block ✓

3. Unstack black_block_1 from purple_block_1
   Preconditions: black_block_1 is on purple_block_1, black_block_1 is clear, not holding any block ✓
   Effects: Holding black_block_1, black_block_1 not on purple_block_1, purple_block_1 is clear ✓

4. Putdown black_block_1
   Preconditions: Holding black_block_1 ✓
   Effects: black_block_1 on table, black_block_1 is clear, not holding any block ✓

5. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_1
   Preconditions: purple_block_1 is on brown_block_1, purple_block_1 is clear, not holding any block ✓
   Effects: Holding purple_block_1, purple_block_1 not on brown_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear ✓

6. Putdown purple_block_1
   Preconditions: Holding purple_block_1 ✓
   Effects: purple_block_1 on table, purple_block_1 is clear, not holding any block ✓

7. Pickup orange_block_1
   Preconditions: orange_block_1 is on table, orange_block_1 is clear, not holding any block ✓
   Effects: Holding orange_block_1, orange_block_1 not on table ✓

8. Stack orange_block_1 on brown_block_1
   Preconditions: Holding orange_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear ✓
   Effects: orange_block_1 on brown_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear, brown_block_1 is not clear, not holding any block ✓

9. Unstack brown_block_2 from yellow_block_1
   Preconditions: brown_block_2 is on yellow_block_1, brown_block_2 is clear, not holding any block ✓
   Effects: Holding brown_block_2, brown_block_2 not on yellow_block_1, yellow_block_1 is clear ✓

  At this point, we have:
  - orange_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
  - we are holding brown_block_2
  
  This satisfies our constraint.

10. Putdown brown_block_2
    Preconditions: Holding brown_block_2 ✓
    Effects: brown_block_2 on table, brown_block_2 is clear, not holding any block ✓

11. Unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_1
    Preconditions: orange_block_1 is on brown_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear, not holding any block ✓
    Effects: Holding orange_block_1, orange_block_1 not on brown_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear ✓

12. Putdown orange_block_1
    Preconditions: Holding orange_block_1 ✓
    Effects: orange_block_1 on table, orange_block_1 is clear, not holding any block ✓

13. Pickup brown_block_1
    Preconditions: brown_block_1 is on table, brown_block_1 is clear, not holding any block ✓
    Effects: Holding brown_block_1, brown_block_1 not on table ✓

14. Stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_1
    Preconditions: Holding brown_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear ✓
    Effects: brown_block_1 on orange_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear, orange_block_1 is not clear, not holding any block ✓

This plan achieves the goal "brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1" and at one point satisfies the constraint that "you are holding brown_block_2" and "orange_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1".

Actually, I wonder if there is an even more optimal plan. Let's see if we can achieve the constraint and goal in fewer steps.

Come to think of it, we might be able to optimize further by placing brown_block_2 somewhere else instead of putting it down twice. But I think 14 steps is pretty optimal for this specific problem with the given constraint.

Let's finalize the plan:

```
unstack green_block_1 black_block_1
putdown green_block_1
unstack black_block_1 purple_block_1
putdown black_block_1
unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
putdown purple_block_1
pickup orange_block_1
stack orange_block_1 brown_block_1
unstack brown_block_2 yellow_block_1
putdown brown_block_2
unstack orange_block_1 brown_block_1
putdown orange_block_1
pickup brown_block_1
stack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
```

This plan achieves the goal while satisfying the constraint.
