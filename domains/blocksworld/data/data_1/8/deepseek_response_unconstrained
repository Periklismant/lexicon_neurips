```
pickup brown_block_1
stack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
```

Wait, that can't be right. Because in the initial state, brown_block_1 is under purple_block_1, so it's not clear. So the arm can't pick it up directly. The initial answer is incorrect. Let me correct this.

Ah, I see the mistake. The initial answer was wrong because brown_block_1 has purple_block_1 on top of it, so it's not clear. The correct plan involves removing the blocks above brown_block_1 first.

Here's the corrected plan:

```
unstack green_block_1 black_block_1
putdown green_block_1
unstack black_block_1 purple_block_1
putdown black_block_1
unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
putdown purple_block_1
pickup brown_block_1
stack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
```

Each step is necessary to clear brown_block_1 so it can be moved. This plan has 8 steps, which is the optimal length.

```
unstack green_block_1 black_block_1
putdown green_block_1
unstack black_block_1 purple_block_1
putdown black_block_1
unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
putdown purple_block_1
pickup brown_block_1
stack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
```
