I'll solve this planning problem step by step.

First, let me understand the initial state:
- orange_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_1 on top of it
- brown_block_1 is on the table with red_block_1 on top of it
- green_block_1 is on the table with grey_block_1 on top of it
- green_block_2 is on the table and clear
- purple_block_1, red_block_1, grey_block_1, and green_block_2 are clear
- The arm is not holding anything

The goal is to have green_block_2 on top of orange_block_1.

The constraints require:
1. At some point, purple_block_1 must have a block on top of it
2. Before putting a block on purple_block_1, either brown_block_1 must be clear OR green_block_2 must be on top of purple_block_1

Let's plan:
1. First, I need to remove purple_block_1 from orange_block_1
2. Then I need to satisfy the constraint by putting a block on purple_block_1
3. Finally, I need to place green_block_2 on orange_block_1

Here's my plan:

```
unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1
putdown purple_block_1
unstack red_block_1 brown_block_1
stack red_block_1 purple_block_1
pickup green_block_2
stack green_block_2 orange_block_1
```

This plan:
1. Removes purple_block_1 from orange_block_1
2. Makes brown_block_1 clear (satisfying the prerequisite for the constraint)
3. Places red_block_1 on purple_block_1 (satisfying the constraint that purple_block_1 must have a block on it)
4. Places green_block_2 on orange_block_1 (achieving the goal)
