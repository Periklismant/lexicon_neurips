Okay, let's break this down. We need to get green_block_2 on top of orange_block_1. We also have some constraints about purple_block_1 and brown_block_1.

Here's the plan:

1.  We need to free up orange_block_1 by removing purple_block_1.
2.  We need to pick up green_block_2.
3.  We need to stack green_block_2 on orange_block_1.
4.  We need to put purple_block_1 on brown_block_1.

```
```
unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1
putdown purple_block_1
pickup green_block_2
stack green_block_2 orange_block_1
```
