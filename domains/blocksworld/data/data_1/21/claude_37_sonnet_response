This is a blocks world planning problem. Let's analyze the initial state, goal, and constraints, and then create a plan to solve the problem.

**Initial State**:
- `orange_block_1` is on the table
- `brown_block_1` is on the table
- `green_block_1` is on the table
- `purple_block_1` is on top of `orange_block_1`
- `red_block_1` is on top of `brown_block_1`
- `grey_block_1` is on top of `green_block_1`
- `green_block_2` is on the table
- `purple_block_1` is clear
- `red_block_1` is clear
- `grey_block_1` is clear
- `green_block_2` is clear
- You are not holding any block

Let me visualize the initial configuration:
```
     purple_block_1      red_block_1      grey_block_1      green_block_2
           |                 |                 |
    orange_block_1      brown_block_1     green_block_1
         table                table             table            table
```

**Goal**:
- `green_block_2` is on top of `orange_block_1`

So we want to achieve:
```
        green_block_2
             |
        orange_block_1
            table
```

**Constraints**:
1. At some point, `purple_block_1` must have a block on top of it (i.e., not be clear).
2. If `purple_block_1` has a block on top of it in a state, then in an earlier state, at least one of the following must be true:
   - `brown_block_1` is clear
   - `green_block_2` is on top of `purple_block_1`

Let's think about the constraints. Constraint 1 means we need to put a block on top of `purple_block_1` at some point in our plan. According to constraint 2, before doing that, we need to ensure that either `brown_block_1` is clear (which means removing `red_block_1` from it) or we put `green_block_2` on top of `purple_block_1`.

Now, let's plan our solution:

1. Initially, `purple_block_1` is on top of `orange_block_1`, and we want `green_block_2` to be on top of `orange_block_1`. So we need to move `purple_block_1` somewhere else.
2. To satisfy the first constraint, we need to put a block on top of `purple_block_1` at some point. Let's choose to put `green_block_2` on top of `purple_block_1`. This would also satisfy the second condition of constraint 2.
3. After that, we'll move `green_block_2` from `purple_block_1` to `orange_block_1` to achieve our goal.

But wait, there's one more consideration. Constraint 2 states that before putting a block on `purple_block_1`, we need to ensure either `brown_block_1` is clear or `green_block_2` is on top of `purple_block_1`. But in this case, we're planning to put `green_block_2` on top of `purple_block_1`, which means the second condition would be true only after we put `green_block_2` there. So, we need to ensure `brown_block_1` is clear before putting any block on `purple_block_1`.

Alright, here's the revised plan:

1. Unstack `red_block_1` from `brown_block_1` to ensure `brown_block_1` is clear.
2. Move `purple_block_1` from `orange_block_1` to the table or to another block (let's say to the table).
3. Place `green_block_2` on top of `purple_block_1` to satisfy constraint 1.
4. Remove `green_block_2` from `purple_block_1`.
5. Place `green_block_2` on top of `orange_block_1` to achieve the goal.

Now, let's implement this step-by-step:

**Plan**:
1. Unstack `red_block_1` from `brown_block_1`.
2. Putdown `red_block_1` on the table.
3. Unstack `purple_block_1` from `orange_block_1`.
4. Putdown `purple_block_1` on the table.
5. Pickup `green_block_2` from the table.
6. Stack `green_block_2` on `purple_block_1`.
7. Unstack `green_block_2` from `purple_block_1`.
8. Stack `green_block_2` on `orange_block_1`.

Let's check if this plan works and satisfies the constraints:

- Initially, we have the configuration described in the initial state.
- After step 2, `brown_block_1` is clear. This satisfies the first condition of constraint 2.
- After step
6, `purple_block_1` has a block on top, which satisfies constraint 1.
- At the end, `green_block_2` is on top of `orange_block_1`, which satisfies the goal.

Wait, but I need to double-check something. Constraint 2 states that if `purple_block_1` is not clear in some state, then in an earlier state, either `brown_block_1` is clear or `green_block_2` is on top of `purple_block_1`. In our plan, we put `green_block_2` on top of `purple_block_1`, making `purple_block_1` not clear. Before doing this, we ensure `brown_block_1` is clear, which satisfies the constraint.

Let's double-check our plan one more time:

1. Unstack `red_block_1` from `brown_block_1`. After this action, `brown_block_1` is clear, and we're holding `red_block_1`.
2. Putdown `red_block_1` on the table. After this action, `red_block_1` is on the table and clear, and we're not holding any block.
3. Unstack `purple_block_1` from `orange_block_1`. After this action, `orange_block_1` is clear, and we're holding `purple_block_1`.
4. Putdown `purple_block_1` on the table. After this action, `purple_block_1` is on the table and clear, and we're not holding any block.
5. Pickup `green_block_2` from the table. After this action, we're holding `green_block_2`, and it's no longer on the table.
6. Stack `green_block_2` on `purple_block_1`. After this action, `green_block_2` is on top of `purple_block_1`, making `purple_block_1` not clear. This satisfies constraint 1. Also, before this action, `brown_block_1` is clear, which satisfies the condition in constraint 2.
7. Unstack `green_block_2` from `purple_block_1`. After this action, `purple_block_1` is clear, and we're holding `green_block_2`.
8. Stack `green_block_2` on `orange_block_1`. After this action, `green_block_2` is on top of `orange_block_1`, achieving the goal.

This plan should satisfy all the constraints and achieve the goal.

Actually I realize I'm overthinking this. Let's clarify the constraints:

1. At some point, `purple_block_1` must have a block on top of it (i.e., not be clear).
2. If `purple_block_1` has a block on top of it in a state, then in an earlier state, at least one of the following must be true:
   - `brown_block_1` is clear
   - `green_block_2` is on top of `purple_block_1`

Now looking at our initial state, `purple_block_1` is clear, and `brown_block_1` is not clear (it has `red_block_1` on top of it). According to constraint 2, before putting a block on top of `purple_block_1`, we need to ensure that either `brown_block_1` is clear or `green_block_2` is on top of `purple_block_1`. Since neither of these is true in the initial state, we need to first clear `brown_block_1` before putting a block on top of `purple_block_1`.

Let me recheck the plan step by step to ensure we adhere to the constraints, adding in our current state after each action:

1. Unstack `red_block_1` from `brown_block_1`. 
   - Current state: `orange_block_1` on table, `brown_block_1` on table and clear, `green_block_1` on table, `purple_block_1` on top of `orange_block_1` and clear, holding `red_block_1`, `grey_block_1` on top of `green_block_1` and clear, `green_block_2` on table and clear.

2. Putdown `red_block_1` on the table. 
   - Current state: `orange_block_1` on table, `brown_block_1` on table and clear, `green_block_1` on table, `purple_block_1` on top of `orange_block_1` and clear, `red_block_1` on table and clear, `grey_block_1` on top of `green_block_1` and clear, `green_block_2` on table and clear, not holding any block.

So at this point, `brown_block_1` is clear, which means we can now satisfy constraint 2. So now we can put a block on top of `purple_block_1` to satisfy constraint 1.

3. Unstack `purple_block_1` from `orange_block_1`. 
   - Current state: `orange_block_1` on table and clear, `brown_block_1` on table and clear, `green_block_1` on table, holding `purple_block_1`, `red_block_1` on table and clear, `grey_block_1` on top of `green_block_1` and clear, `green_block_2` on table and clear.

4. Putdown `purple_block_1` on the table. 
   - Current state: `orange_block_1` on table and clear, `brown_block_1` on table and clear, `green_block_1` on table, `purple_block_1` on table and clear, `red_block_1` on table and clear, `grey_block_1` on top of `green_block_1` and clear, `green_block_2` on table and clear, not holding any block.

Hmm, let me go back a bit. I think the real question is, how do we satisfy constraint 1 and 2 together? 

Constraint 1 says we need to have `purple_block_1` not clear at some point. This means we need to put a block on top of `purple_block_1`. But constraint 2 says before we do that, we need to ensure that either `brown_block_1` is clear or `green_block_2` is on top of `purple_block_1`. But we can't have `green_block_2` on top of `purple_block_1` before `purple_block_1` becomes not clear (because the act of putting `green_block_2` on top of `purple_block_1` makes it not clear). So we need to ensure `brown_block_1` is clear before we put a block on top of `purple_block_1`.

So, our plan so far:
1. Unstack `red_block_1` from `brown_block_1` to make `brown_block_1` clear (satisfying the condition for constraint 2).
2. Now we're allowed to make `purple_block_1` not clear.

Let's get back on track with our original plan:

3. Unstack `purple_block_1` from `orange_block_1`. 
4. Putdown `purple_block_1` on the table.
5. Pickup `red_block_1` from the table. (Choosing `red_block_1` to put on top of `purple_block_1` to satisfy constraint 1.)
6. Stack `red_block_1` on `purple_block_1`. (Now `purple_block_1` is not clear, satisfying constraint 1.)

At this point, we've satisfied constraint 1 (by putting `red_block_1` on top of `purple_block_1`, making it not clear), and we've satisfied constraint 2 (by ensuring `brown_block_1` is clear before making `purple_block_1` not clear).

Now we want to achieve the goal of putting `green_block_2` on top of `orange_block_1`:

7. Pickup `green_block_2` from the table.
8. Stack `green_block_2` on `orange_block_1`. (Goal achieved.)

Let me check our plan again:

Action 1: Unstack `red_block_1` from `brown_block_1`. 
- Before: We're not holding any block, `red_block_1` is on top of `brown_block_1` and clear. Preconditions are met.
- After: We're holding `red_block_1`, `brown_block_1` is clear.

Action 2: Putdown `red_block_1` on the table. 
- Before: We're holding `red_block_1`. Preconditions are met.
- After: `red_block_1` is on the table and clear, we're not holding any block.

Action 3: Unstack `purple_block_1` from `orange_block_1`. 
- Before: We're not holding any block, `purple_block_1` is on top of `orange_block_1` and clear. Preconditions are met.
- After: We're holding `purple_block_1`, `orange_block_1` is clear.

Action 4: Putdown `purple_block_1` on the table. 
- Before: We're holding `purple_block_1`. Preconditions are met.
- After: `purple_block_1` is on the table and clear, we're not holding any block.

Action 5: Pickup `red_block_1` from the table. 
- Before: We're not holding any block, `red_block_1` is on the table and clear. Preconditions are met.
- After: We're holding `red_block_1`, `red_block_1` is not on the table.

Action 6: Stack `red_block_1` on `purple_block_1`. 
- Before: We're holding `red_block_1`, `purple_block_1` is clear. Preconditions are met.
- After: `red_block_1` is on top of `purple_block_1` and clear, `purple_block_1` is not clear, we're not holding any block.

Action 7: Pickup `green_block_2` from the table. 
- Before: We're not holding any block, `green_block_2` is on the table and clear. Preconditions are met.
- After: We're holding `green_block_2`, `green_block_2` is not on the table.

Action 8: Stack `green_block_2` on `orange_block_1`. 
- Before: We're holding `green_block_2`, `orange_block_1` is clear. Preconditions are met.
- After: `green_block_2` is on top of `orange_block_1` and clear, `orange_block_1` is not clear, we're not holding any block.

The plan seems to satisfy all the constraints and achieve the goal!

But let me just double check if there's anything I'm missing about the constraints.

Constraint 1: At some point, `purple_block_1` must have a block on top of it (i.e., not be clear).
- After Action 6, `red_block_1` is on top of `purple_block_1`, making `purple_block_1` not clear. Constraint 1 is satisfied.

Constraint 2: If `purple_block_1` has a block on top of it in a state, then in an earlier state, at least one of the following must be true:
   - `brown_block_1` is clear
   - `green_block_2` is on top of `purple_block_1`
- Before Action 6 (where `purple_block_1` becomes not clear), `brown_block_1` is clear (after Action 1). Constraint 2 is satisfied.

Actually I think there's a minor optimization on our original plan. Since we're putting `green_block_2` on top of `orange_block_1` to achieve the goal, we need to move `purple_block_1` elsewhere. Instead of stacking `red_block_1` on `purple_block_1` to satisfy constraint 1, we could directly stack `green_block_2` on `purple_block_1`, satisfying both constraint 1 and the "or" part of constraint 2. Then, we'd unstack `green_block_2` from `purple_block_1` and stack it on `orange_block_1` to achieve the goal. This would save two actions (we wouldn't need to move `red_block_1`).

Here's the revised plan:

1. Unstack `red_block_1` from `brown_block_1`. (Making `brown_block_1` clear, satisfying the condition for constraint 2.)
2. Putdown `red_block_1` on the table.
3. Unstack `purple_block_1` from `orange_block_1`. (Clearing the space on `orange_block_1` for `green_block_2`.)
4. Putdown `purple_block_1` on the table.
5. Pickup `green_block_2` from the table.
6. Stack `green_block_2` on `purple_block_1`. (Now `purple_block_1` is not clear, satisfying constraint 1. Also, `green_block_2` is on top of `purple_block_1`, which is the "or" part of constraint 2.)
7. Unstack `green_block_2` from `purple_block_1`.
8. Stack `green_block_2` on `orange_block_1`. (Goal achieved.)

This plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal with the same number of steps. The advantage of this plan is that it's more direct: we don't need to move `red_block_1` around just to satisfy constraint 1; we can use `green_block_2` directly for that purpose.

Hmm but then I'm a bit confused. Does constraint 2 apply to any point where `purple_block_1` is not clear, or specifically the point that makes constraint 1 true? I think it applies to any point where `purple_block_1` is not clear. So before Action 6 in our revised plan, where we're about to stack `green_block_2` on `purple_block_1`, we need to ensure that either `brown_block_1` is clear or `green_block_2` is on top of `purple_block_1`. But `green_block_2` is not yet on top of `purple_block_1` (we're about to put it there), so we need to ensure `brown_block_1` is clear.

Actually, I think I had it right the first time. Constraint 2 says: If `purple_block_1` has a block on top of it in a state, then in an earlier state, either `brown_block_1` is clear or `green_block_2` is on top of `purple_block_1`.

When we stack `green_block_2` on `purple_block_1`, we're making `purple_block_1` not clear. For this state, constraint 2 says in an earlier state, either `brown_block_1` should be clear or `green_block_2` should be on top of `purple_block_1`. But the latter is not true, so `brown_block_1` must be clear in an earlier state.

Re-reading constraint 2, I think a clearer way to phrase it is: If `purple_block_1` is not clear in a state, then in a previous state, either `brown_block_1` should be clear or `green_block_2` should be on `purple_block_1`.

So our plan is:
1. Ensure `brown_block_1` is clear by unstacking `red_block_1`.
2. At some point, make `purple_block_1` not clear to satisfy constraint 1.
3. Achieve the goal by placing `green_block_2` on `orange_block_1`.

Our revised plan still works:
1. Unstack `red_block_1` from `brown_block_1`. (Making `brown_block_1` clear for constraint 2.)
2. Putdown `red_block_1` on the table.
3. Unstack `purple_block_1` from `orange_block_1`. (Clearing the space on `orange_block_1` for `green_block_2`.)
4. Putdown `purple_block_1` on the table.
5. Pickup `green_block_2` from the table.
6. Stack `green_block_2` on `purple_block_1`. (Satisfying constraint 1 by making `purple_block_1` not clear. We can do this because in an earlier state, `brown_block_1` is clear, satisfying constraint 2.)
7. Unstack `green_block_2` from `purple_block_1`.
8. Stack `green_block_2` on `orange_block_1`. (Goal achieved.)

I'm confident that this plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal efficiently.

Actually I'm not sure, I think I keep messing up on constraint 2. Let me re-read it:

"If expression 'there is a block on top of purple_block_1, i.e., purple_block_1 is not clear' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "there is no block on top of brown_block_1, i.e., brown_block_1 is clear", "green_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1"'"

This means if at any point we make `purple_block_1` not clear (by placing a block on top of it), then before that, we must have `brown_block_1` clear or `green_block_2` on top of `purple_block_1`.

Actually I think constraint 2 might be a bit more complex than I initially thought.
I think it says that if purple_block_1 is not clear (has a block on top) in some state, and before that it had to be clear (since we just stacked some block on it), then in an earlier state (earlier than the stack action), we need to have `brown_block_1` clear or `green_block_2` on top of `purple_block_1`. This is different from just saying "before purple_block_1 becomes not clear, ensure brown_block_1 is clear".

Hmm, so before making purple_block_1 not clear, I need to ensure at least one of the following:
- brown_block_1 is clear
- green_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1

But wait, the second condition doesn't make sense on its own. If we are going to place a block on purple_block_1 to make it not clear, it can't already have green_block_2 on top of it, or I wouldn't be able to place another block on it.

Let me re-read the constraint to ensure I don't make a mistake.

"If expression 'there is a block on top of purple_block_1, i.e., purple_block_1 is not clear' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "there is no block on top of brown_block_1, i.e., brown_block_1 is clear", "green_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1"'"

Actually, the constraint doesn't say "immediately before", just "in an earlier state". So it's possible that green_block_2 was on top of purple_block_1 in an earlier state, then was removed, and then another block was placed on purple_block_1 to make it not clear.

So, updated understanding:
1. We must have purple_block_1 not clear at some point for constraint 1.
2. Before making purple_block_1 not clear, we must have (in any previous state) either brown_block_1 clear or green_block_2 on top of purple_block_1.

In our original plan, we unstack red_block_1 from brown_block_1, making brown_block_1 clear. This satisfies the first part of constraint 2. Then we place red_block_1 on purple_block_1, making it not clear for constraint 1.

In our revised plan, we also unstack red_block_1 from brown_block_1, making brown_block_1 clear (satisfying the first part of constraint 2). Then we place green_block_2 on purple_block_1, making it not clear for constraint 1.

Actually, I think I see the confusion I am having. Let's set some terminology: Let's say T be the time that 'purple_block_1 is not clear' first becomes true. Then constraint 2 says that at some time T' < T, either 'brown_block_1 is clear' or 'green_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1'. Let's also say that in our initial state, T=0.

There's a way to make sure that 'green_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1' is never true, which means we must have 'brown_block_1 is clear' at some point before 'purple_block_1 is not clear'.

Another way to interpret constraint 2 is: If 'purple_block_1 is not clear' due to a block other than green_block_2 being on top of it, then 'brown_block_1 is clear' must be true at some point before. However, if 'purple_block_1 is not clear' due to green_block_2 being on top of it, then 'brown_block_1 is clear' doesn't need to be true at any point before.

Given this constraint, and the fact that constraint 1 requires 'purple_block_1' to be not clear at some point, we can place 'green_block_2' on top of 'purple_block_1' without having to clear 'brown_block_1' first. But if we want to place any other block on top of 'purple_block_1', we need to ensure 'brown_block_1' is clear beforehand.

Okay, I think the more efficient plan is:

1. Unstack `purple_block_1` from `orange_block_1`. (Clearing the space on `orange_block_1` for `green_block_2`.)
2. Putdown `purple_block_1` on the table.
3. Pickup `green_block_2` from the table.
4. Stack `green_block_2` on `purple_block_1`. (Satisfying constraint 1 by making `purple_block_1` not clear. This also satisfies constraint 2 because 'green_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1' is the second part of the constraint, which is now true.)
5. Unstack `green_block_2` from `purple_block_1`.
6. Stack `green_block_2` on `orange_block_1`. (Goal achieved.)

This 6-step plan is more efficient than our 8-step plan.

Let me double check the pre-conditions and post-conditions at each step:

Action 1: Unstack `purple_block_1` from `orange_block_1`. 
- Before: We're not holding any block, `purple_block_1` is on top of `orange_block_1` and clear. Preconditions are met.
- After: We're holding `purple_block_1`, `orange_block_1` is clear.

Action 2: Putdown `purple_block_1` on the table. 
- Before: We're holding `purple_block_1`. Preconditions are met.
- After: `purple_block_1` is on the table and clear, we're not holding any block.

Action 3: Pickup `green_block_2` from the table. 
- Before: We're not holding any block, `green_block_2` is on the table and clear. Preconditions are met.
- After: We're holding `green_block_2`, `green_block_2` is not on the table.

Action 4: Stack `green_block_2` on `purple_block_1`. 
- Before: We're holding `green_block_2`, `purple_block_1` is clear. Preconditions are met.
- After: `green_block_2` is on top of `purple_block_1` and clear, `purple_block_1` is not clear, we're not holding any block.

Action 5: Unstack `green_block_2` from `purple_block_1`. 
- Before: We're not holding any block, `green_block_2` is on top of `purple_block_1` and clear. Preconditions are met.
- After: We're holding `green_block_2`, `purple_block_1` is clear.

Action 6: Stack `green_block_2` on `orange_block_1`. 
- Before: We're holding `green_block_2`, `orange_block_1` is clear. Preconditions are met.
- After: `green_block_2` is on top of `orange_block_1` and clear, `orange_block_1` is not clear, we're not holding any block.

Constraint 1: At some point, `purple_block_1` must have a block on top of it (i.e., not be clear).
- After Action 4, `green_block_2` is on top of `purple_block_1`, making `purple_block_1` not clear. Constraint 1 is satisfied.

Constraint 2: If `purple_block_1` has a block on top of it in a state, then in an earlier state, at least one of the following must be true:
   - `brown_block_1` is clear
   - `green_block_2` is on top of `purple_block_1`
- The only state where `purple_block_1` has a block on top of it is after Action 4, and the block is `green_block_2`. This immediately satisfies the second part of constraint 2 ("green_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1"). So constraint 2 is satisfied.

Goal: `green_block_2` is on top of `orange_block_1`.
- After Action 6, `green_block_2` is on top of `orange_block_1`, achieving the goal.

All constraints are satisfied, and the goal is achieved in 6 steps.

Actually, there's a sanity check I'm not doing. Constraint 2 says if `purple_block_1` is not clear in some state, then in an *earlier* state, one of the two conditions must be true. Just stacking `green_block_2` on `purple_block_1` doesn't in itself satisfy the constraint, because "green_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1" is true after the stack operation, not in an earlier state. 

But then again, the constraint wording says if the "not clear" condition holds in some state, then in an *earlier* state, the conditions must hold. If we place `green_block_2` on top of `purple_block_1`, then in the resulting state, `purple_block_1` is not clear and the condition "green_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1" is also true. It's not in an earlier state.

Now I'm really confused, am I misreading this? Let's break it down properly:

"If expression 'there is a block on top of purple_block_1, i.e., purple_block_1 is not clear' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "there is no block on top of brown_block_1, i.e., brown_block_1 is clear", "green_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1"'"

This is saying if `purple_block_1` is not clear in state S, then in a state E (where E comes before S), either `brown_block_1` is clear or `green_block_2` is on top of `purple_block_1`.

If we place any block on top of `purple_block_1`, we need to ensure in a previous state, one of the two conditions holds.

If we place `green_block_2` on top of `purple_block_1`, we need to ensure that in a previous state, either `brown_block_1` is clear or `green_block_2` is on top of `purple_block_1`. The latter can't be true (since we're just now placing `green_block_2` on top of `purple_block_1`), so `brown_block_1` must be clear in a previous state.

This means we do need to unstack `red_block_1` from `brown_block_1` at the beginning of our plan to satisfy constraint 2.

So if we're just now placing `green_block_2` on top of `purple_block_1`, we need to ensure `brown_block_1` is clear in a previous state. It's not clear in the initial state (since it has `red_block_1` on top of it), so we need to clear it.

So I think the 8-step plan I had earlier is the correct solution:

1. Unstack `red_block_1` from `brown_block_1`. (Making `brown_block_1` clear for constraint 2.)
2. Putdown `red_block_1` on the table.
3. Unstack `purple_block_1` from `orange_block_1`. (Clearing the space on `orange_block_1` for `green_block_2`.)
4. Putdown `purple_block_1` on the table.
5. Pickup `green_block_2` from the table.
6. Stack `green_block_2` on `purple_block_1`. (Satisfying constraint 1 by making `purple_block_1` not clear. We can do this because in an earlier state, `brown_block_1` is clear, satisfying constraint 2.)
7. Unstack `green_block_2` from `purple_block_1`.
8. Stack `green_block_2` on `orange_block_1`. (Goal achieved.)

Actually, I think the constraint is making sure that we can show that "brown_block_1 is clear" happens before "there is a block on top of purple_block_1." 

Gosh, I don't think I was overthinking this, I wanted to make sure I fully got the constraint. But I do think you were right. I should simplify and take the original 8-step plan, which can be applied to our current blocksworld, and will work.

Let's give the answer. The optimal plan is:
1. Unstack `red_block_1` from `brown_block_1`. (Making `brown_block_1` clear for constraint 2.)
2. Putdown `red_block_1` on the table.
3. Unstack `purple_block_1` from `orange_block_1`. (Clearing the space on `orange_block_1` for `green_block_2`.)
4. Putdown `purple_block_1` on the table.
5. Pickup `green_block_2` from the table.
6. Stack `green_block_2` on `purple_block_1`. (Satisfying constraint 1 by making `purple_block_1` not clear. We can do this because in an earlier state, `brown_block_1` is clear, satisfying constraint 2.)
7. Unstack `green_block_2` from `purple_block_1`.
8. Stack `green_block_2` on `orange_block_1`. (Goal achieved.)

This 8-step plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal.

Actually, I think I'm still overthinking, but I've also convinced myself I'm right to address the constraint from the beginning. Since putting a block on top of purple_block_1 makes the constraint non-vacuously true, we need to satisfy the antecedent ahead of time. Let me format the solution more carefully.
