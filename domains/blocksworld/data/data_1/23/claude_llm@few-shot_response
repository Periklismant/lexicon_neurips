I'll solve this planning problem step by step.

First, let me understand the goal and constraints:
- Goal: "yellow_block_1 is on the table"
- Constraint 1: At some point, "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" must be true
- Constraint 2: After yellow_block_1 is no longer on white_block_1, we must ensure either white_block_2 is clear OR white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1

Initial state:
- yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- green_block_1 is on top of white_block_2
- white_block_1, white_block_2, orange_block_1, orange_block_2, and red_block_1 are on the table
- yellow_block_1, orange_block_1, green_block_1, orange_block_2, and red_block_1 are clear
- The arm is empty

To achieve the goal, I need to move yellow_block_1 to the table. This will also satisfy constraint 1. Then I need to ensure constraint 2 is satisfied.

Here's my plan:

```
unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
putdown yellow_block_1
```

Let's verify:
1. The goal "yellow_block_1 is on the table" is achieved
2. Constraint 1 is satisfied when we unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
3. Constraint 2 requires that after yellow_block_1 is not on white_block_1, either white_block_2 is clear OR white_block_2 is on green_block_1
   - In the initial state, green_block_1 is on white_block_2, so white_block_2 is not clear
   - We don't change the position of white_block_2 or green_block_1 in our plan

However, I need to ensure constraint 2 is satisfied. Since white_block_2 is not clear (green_block_1 is on it), I need to either make white_block_2 clear or put white_block_2 on green_block_1.

Let me revise my plan:

```
unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
putdown yellow_block_1
unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
stack white_block_2 green_block_1
```

This plan:
1. Achieves the goal of putting yellow_block_1 on the table
2. Satisfies constraint 1 by removing yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
3. Satisfies constraint 2 by placing white_block_2 on top of green_block_1
