Okay, let's break this down. We need to get yellow_block_1 onto the table. Currently, it's on white_block_1. We also have a constraint that yellow_block_1 must not be on white_block_1 at some point, and if that happens, then either white_block_2 must be clear or white_block_2 must be on top of green_block_1. Since white_block_2 currently has green_block_1 on top of it, we can satisfy the second part of the constraint by simply moving yellow_block_1.

Here's the plan:

```
```
unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
putdown yellow_block_1
```
