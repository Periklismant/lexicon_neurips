Alright, let's think through this problem carefully.

First, let's understand the initial state:
- white_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_2 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on top of white_block_2
- orange_block_2 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- orange_block_1 is clear
- green_block_1 is clear
- orange_block_2 is clear
- red_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

The goal is simply to have yellow_block_1 on the table.

But we also have two constraints:
1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1"
   This means that at some point in our plan, yellow_block_1 should not be on top of white_block_1. In the initial state, yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, so we need to move it.

2. "If expression 'yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "there is no block on top of white_block_2, i.e., white_block_2 is clear", "white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1"' must hold at s or at some state after s"
   This means that once we move yellow_block_1 from white_block_1, we must ensure that either white_block_2 becomes clear (which it's not initially because green_block_1 is on top of it) or white_block_2 is placed on top of green_block_1. Currently, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_2, so it's the opposite of what the constraint wants. So we'll likely need to move green_block_1 and reorganize.

Now, let's solve the problem:

The first constraint just requires us to move yellow_block_1 off white_block_1, which is part of our goal anyway. So we definitely need to do this.

The second constraint says that after doing so, we need to make sure either white_block_2 is clear or white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1. Initially, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_2. So, to satisfy this constraint, we need to either remove green_block_1 from white_block_2 and not place anything else on white_block_2, or invert the positions of green_block_1 and white_block_2 such that white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1.

Let's see how we could solve this:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1 on the table (this achieves our goal)

But we still need to satisfy the second constraint. If we do the above two actions, yellow_block_1 is no longer on top of white_block_1, but white_block_2 is not clear (green_block_1 is on top of it) and white_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1. 

So we need to modify our plan. Let's try:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
2. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2 (now white_block_2 is clear, satisfying the constraint)
3. putdown yellow_block_1 on the table (this achieves our goal)

This should satisfy both constraints, but let's double-check:
1. After step 1, "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is true.
2. After step 2, "there is no block on top of white_block_2, i.e., white_block_2 is clear" is true, which satisfies the second constraint.
3. After step 3, "yellow_block_1 is on the table" is true, which achieves our goal.

However, there's a problem with the plan I just constructed. After step, the robot arm is holding yellow_block_1. But to unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2 (step 2), the robot arm needs to be free. So, I need to modify the plan:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1 on the table (this achieves our goal)
3. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2 (now white_block_2 is clear, satisfying the constraint)

Wait, that's still not correct. After step 1, "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is true. So the constraint "#2 kicks in. But according to the plan, white_block_2 doesn't become clear until step 3, which is after the trigger condition. The constraint isn't satisfied.

Actually, let's re-read the constraint: "If yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 holds at state s, then one of the conditions must hold at s or at some state after s." The key is "or at some state after s". So even if we move yellow_block_1 first, we can still satisfy the constraint by making white_block_2 clear later in the plan.

So my plan is valid:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1 on the table (this achieves our goal)
3. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2 (now white_block_2 is clear, satisfying the constraint)

But let's think about optimality. Do we actually need step 3? The goal is just to have yellow_block_1 on the table. Let's verify the constraints:

1. After step 1, "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is true, so we satisfy constraint 1.
2. For constraint 2, after yellow_block_1 is no longer on top of white_block_1, we need to ensure that either white_block_2 is clear or white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1.

Since we need to check if we really need step 3, let's think about the second constraint. If we just did steps 1 and 2, would the constraint be satisfied?

After step 2, "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is true, triggering the constraint. But neither "white_block_2 is clear" nor "white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" is true, because green_block_1 is on top of white_block_2.

So, we definitely need to make some changes to the position of green_block_1 and white_block_2. Either we need to remove green_block_1 from white_block_2 or invert their positions.

Let's try both approaches:

Approach 1:
1. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1 on the table
3. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2
4. putdown green_block_1 on the table

Approach 2:
1. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1 on the table
3. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2
4. putdown green_block_1 on the table
5. pickup white_block_2
6. stack white_block_2 on green_block_1

Both approaches satisfy the constraints, but Approach 1 is shorter, so it's more optimal. However, do we really need to putdown green_block_1 after unstacking it? What if we just hold it?

Actually, the goal is just to have yellow_block_1 on the table. Once yellow_block_1 is on the table and we've satisfied all constraints, we're done. So, the optimal plan would be:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1 on the table (this achieves our goal)
3. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2 (this ensures white_block_2 is clear, satisfying the constraint)

But let's rethink this. I'm not sure if we need to check if a constraint is satisfied at the final state or at any state in the plan. Let's say a constraint needs to be satisfied during the plan execution, not necessarily at the final state.

So, after step 2 in our plan, "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is true. This triggers the check for the second constraint. The constraint requires that either "white_block_2 is clear" or "white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" is true at that point or at some point after.

If we just leave the plan with steps 1 and 2, then the constraint wouldn't be satisfied because green_block_1 is on top of white_block_2 and there's no point in the plan where white_block_2 becomes clear or gets placed on top of green_block_1.

So, we definitely need to do something with green_block_1 and white_block_2 to satisfy the constraint. We can either remove green_block_1 from white_block_2 or invert their positions.

Let's go with the first option, which is shorter:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1 on the table
3. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2

After step 3, white_block_2 is clear, satisfying the constraint. So, this is our optimal plan.

Wait, I'm being silly. Let's make sure the initial conditions are clear. In the initial state, white_block_2 is on the table, and green_block_1 is on top of white_block_2. So, white_block_2 is not clear in the initial state.

The goal is just to have yellow_block_1 on the table. So, ideally, we just want to unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1 and put it on the table. But the constraint says that once yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, either white_block_2 is clear or white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1.

Checking the plan:
1. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1 on the table

After step 2, "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is true. But white_block_2 is not clear (green_block_1 is on top of it) and white_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1. So, the constraint isn't satisfied.

We need to modify the plan:
1. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2 (now white_block_2 is clear)
2. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
3. putdown yellow_block_1 on the table

But wait, after step 1, the robot is holding green_block_1. We need to put it down somewhere before we can proceed.

1. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2 (now white_block_2 is clear)
2. putdown green_block_1 on the table
3. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1 on the table

This plan satisfies the constraints:
1. At step 3 and thereafter, "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is true.
2. At step 1 and thereafter, "white_block_2 is clear" is true.

But is this the most optimal plan? Let's think about an alternative approach:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
2. stack yellow_block_1 on top of green_block_1 (now it's not on top of white_block_1)
3. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2 (now white_block_2 is clear)
4. putdown green_block_1 on the table
5. unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
6. putdown yellow_block_1 on the table

That's 6 steps, which is longer than the 4-step plan. So, the first plan seems to be more optimal.

Let's re-read the constraints:
1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1"
2. "If expression 'yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "there is no block on top of white_block_2, i.e., white_block_2 is clear", "white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1"' must hold at s or at some state after s"

The way I understand it, at the first moment when yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, we need to make sure that either white_block_2 is clear or white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1. This could be in the same state or in a future state.

Let's reconsider our 4-step plan:
1. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2 (now white_block_2 is clear)
2. putdown green_block_1 on the table
3. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1 on the table

After step 3, "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is true. And at that point, "white_block_2 is clear" is also true. So, the constraint is satisfied, and the goal is achieved at step 4.

But what if we rearranged the steps?
1. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2 (white_block_2 is clear)
2. stack green_block_1 on top of another block, let's say orange_block_1 (to free the hand)
3. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, and white_block_2 is clear)
4. putdown yellow_block_1 on the table (achieving the goal)

That's still 4 steps, but we're stacking green_block_1 on another block instead of putting it on the table. Is that allowed? Yes, it is. Let's refine this plan to ensure it's valid:

1. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2 (white_block_2 is clear)
2. stack green_block_1 on orange_block_1 (freeing the hand)
3. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, and white_block_2 is clear)
4. putdown yellow_block_1 on the table (achieving the goal)

Is this plan valid? Let's check the preconditions for each action:

1. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2
   Preconditions: green_block_1 is on top of white_block_2, green_block_1 is clear, and you are not holding any block.
   All of these are true in the initial state.

2. stack green_block_1 on orange_block_1
   Preconditions: you are holding green_block_1, and orange_block_1 is clear.
   After step 1, both of these are true.

3. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
   Preconditions: yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, yellow_block_1 is clear, and you are not holding any block.
   After step 2, all of these are true.

4. putdown yellow_block_1 on the table
   Preconditions: you are holding yellow_block_1.
   After step 3, this is true.

So, the plan is valid, and it satisfies both constraints.

Let's double check:
1. After step 3 and thereafter, "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is true.
2. After step 1 and thereafter, "white_block_2 is clear" is true.

And the goal is achieved at step 4. So, the plan is optimal.

Actually I made an error above. The first plan I proposed is:
1. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2 (now white_block_2 is clear)
2. putdown green_block_1 on the table
3. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1 on the table

And the second plan is:
1. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2 (white_block_2 is clear)
2. stack green_block_1 on orange_block_1 (freeing the hand)
3. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, and white_block_2 is clear)
4. putdown yellow_block_1 on the table (achieving the goal)

Both plans have 4 steps, so they are both equally optimal. Let's check if we can make it even shorter.

What if we unstacked yellow_block_1 first and then we unstacked green_block_1?

1. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
2. stack yellow_block_1 on orange_block_1 (freeing the hand)
3. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2 (white_block_2 is clear)
4. unstack yellow_block_1 from orange_block_1
5. putdown yellow_block_1 on the table (achieving the goal)

This is 5 steps, which is longer.

What if we try to do something clever with stacking white_block_2 on green_block_1 to invert their positions?

1. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2 (freeing white_block_2)
2. putdown green_block_1 on the table
3. pickup white_block_2
4. stack white_block_2 on green_block_1 (now white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1)
5. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
6. putdown yellow_block_1 on the table (achieving the goal)

This is 6 steps, which is longer.

It seems like the two 4-step plans I provided earlier are the optimal ones. Let's reconsider them one more time:

Plan 1:
1. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2 (now white_block_2 is clear)
2. putdown green_block_1 on the table
3. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1 on the table

Plan 2:
1. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2 (white_block_2 is clear)
2. stack green_block_1 on orange_block_1 (freeing the hand)
3. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, and white_block_2 is clear)
4. putdown yellow_block_1 on the table (achieving the goal)

Both plans have 4 steps, and they are both valid and achieve the goal while satisfying the constraints. So, they are both optimal.

Actually, I think I misunderstood something. Let's try to be really specific. The goal is just to have yellow_block_1 on the table, but the initial position has yellow_block_1 on top of white_block_1. So, we need to move yellow_block_1.

The second constraint says that once yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, we need to make sure that either white_block_2 is clear or white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1. In the initial state, white_block_2 is not clear (green_block_1 is on top of it) and white_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1. So, we need to make one of these true.

Let's trace the plans once more:

Plan 1:
1. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2 (now white_block_2 is clear)
2. putdown green_block_1 on the table
3. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1 on the table

After step 3, "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is true. And at that point, "white_block_2 is clear" is also true. So, the constraint is satisfied, and the goal is achieved at step 4.

Plan 2:
1. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2 (white_block_2 is clear)
2. stack green_block_1 on orange_block_1 (freeing the hand)
3. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, and white_block_2 is clear)
4. putdown yellow_block_1 on the table (achieving the goal)

After step 3, "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is true. And at that point, "white_block_2 is clear" is also true. So, the constraint is satisfied, and the goal is achieved at step 4.

I think both plans are valid and optimal. But let's try one more plan to see if we can make it shorter:

Plan 3:
1. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, but white_block_2 is not clear)
2. putdown yellow_block_1 on the table (achieving the goal)
3. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2 (white_block_2 is clear)

After step 1, "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is true, triggering the constraint. But neither "white_block_2 is clear" nor "white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" is true. However, after step 3, "white_block_2 is clear" is true. So, the constraint is eventually satisfied.

This plan has 3 steps, which is shorter than the previous two plans, making it potentially more optimal. But wait, does the constraint allow for this? It says, "If expression 'yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1' holds in some state s, then expression [the conditions] must hold at s or at some state after s". The key is "or at some state after s". So, it seems like this plan is indeed valid. The constraint doesn't require "white_block_2 is clear" to be true at the exact same state when "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" becomes true.

So, the most optimal plan seems to be:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1 on the table
3. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2

This is a 3-step plan and is the most optimal. And it satisfies the constraint because, at step 3, white_block_2 becomes clear.

But, and thinking outside the box once more, can we achieve the goal with even fewer steps? Let's think:

The key is that the constraint says "IF yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1..." At the beginning, yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, so this isn't triggered yet.

The goal is to have yellow_block_1 on the table.

What if we just moved yellow_block_1 to another block and never put it on the table? For example:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
2. stack yellow_block_1 on orange_block_1

After step 2, yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, triggering the constraint. And neither "white_block_2 is clear" nor "white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1" is true. So, the constraint isn't satisfied.

We could do:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
2. stack yellow_block_1 on orange_block_1
3. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2

Now, white_block_2 is clear and the constraint is satisfied. But the goal is to have yellow_block_1 on the table, which this 3-step plan doesn't achieve.

Let's try a slightly different approach:

1. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2 (white_block_2 is clear)
2. putdown green_block_1 on the table
3. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1 on the table

This is 4 steps. But as I showed earlier, we can achieve the goal in 3 steps.

Actually, looking back at the 3-step plan:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1 on the table
3. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2

After step 2, the goal is achieved. So, the question is: do we really need to do step 3? Let's focus on the constraints:

Constraint 2 says that once yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, we need to make sure that either white_block_2 is clear or white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1. After step 2, yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, but white_block_2 is not clear (green_block_1 is on top of it) and white_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1. So, if we stop after step 2, the constraint isn't satisfied.

However, after step 3, white_block_2 is clear, satisfying the constraint. So, we can't simply stop after step 2. We need to take 3 steps to achieve the goal and satisfy the constraint.

So, the 3-step plan is the most optimal:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1 on the table
3. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2

But wait, I realized that I missed a key insight earlier. Let's read the goal again: "The task is to bring about the following situation: yellow_block_1 is on the table". That's it. The goal doesn't require that yellow_block_1 remains on the table in the final state. It just needs to be on the table at some point.

So, if we place yellow_block_1 on the table at step 2 of our 3-step plan, haven't we technically achieved the goal? The constraints must still be satisfied, sure, but the goal is just to have yellow_block_1 on the table at some point.

Let's reconsider. Oh, I see the issue. The goal says "bring about the following situation," which typically means the situation holds in the final state. So the goal is to have yellow_block_1 on the table at the end.

So, our 3-step plan achieves both the goal and satisfies all constraints:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1 on the table
3. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2

After step 3, yellow_block_1 is on the table (goal achieved), and white_block_2 is clear (constraint satisfied). And, during the execution of the plan, yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 at some point (from step 1 onward), satisfying the first constraint.

I think this is the most optimal plan.

Let's double-check if this is correct:

Goal: yellow_block_1 is on the table
Constraint 1: yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 must hold in at least one state.
Constraint 2: If yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 holds in some state s, then either white_block_2 is clear or white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1 must hold at s or at some state after s.

Initial state:
- white_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_2 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on top of white_block_2
- orange_block_2 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- orange_block_1 is clear
- green_block_1 is clear
- orange_block_2 is clear
- red_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Plan:
1. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1 on the table
3. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2

After step 1, you are holding yellow_block_1, and yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 (satisfying Constraint 1). This triggers Constraint 2, which requires that either white_block_2 is clear or white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1 must hold at this point or at some point in the future. After step 1, neither of these is true, but after step 3, white_block_2 is clear, satisfying Constraint 2.

After step 2, yellow_block_1 is on the table, which is the goal.

So, the 3-step plan achieves the goal and satisfies all constraints. It is the most optimal plan.

However, I realized I was confusing myself a bit. Let's be more precise:

Goal: yellow_block_1 is on the table
Constraint 1: yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 must hold in at least one state.
Constraint 2: If yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 holds in some state s, then either white_block_2 is clear or white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1 must hold at s or at some state after s.

In our 3-step plan:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1 on the table
3. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2

After step 1, yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, satisfying Constraint 1. This triggers Constraint 2, so either white_block_2 is clear or white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1 must be true now or in the future. Neither of these is true after step 1 or step 2, but after step 3, white_block_2 is clear.

After step 2, yellow_block_1 is on the table, which is the goal.

Now, do we truly need step 3? If we stopped after step 2, the goal would be achieved, but would the constraints be satisfied? Constraint 1 would be satisfied, as yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 after step 1. But Constraint 2, which is triggered from step 1 onwards, would not be satisfied if we stopped after step 2, because at that point, white_block_2 is not clear and white_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1.

So, step 3 is indeed necessary to satisfy the constraints.

The 3-step plan I provided is valid, achieves the goal, satisfies all constraints, and is the most optimal plan.

1. unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1 on the table
3. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2
