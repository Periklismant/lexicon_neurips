Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld problem. So, the initial state has several blocks arranged in certain ways, and the goal is to get yellow_block_1 onto the table. Plus, there are some constraints to satisfy. Let me start by understanding the initial setup and the goal.

First, the initial state:
- white_block_1 is on the table, with yellow_block_1 on top of it. Yellow_block_1 is clear.
- white_block_2 is on the table with green_block_1 on top, which is clear.
- orange_block_1, orange_block_2, and red_block_1 are all on the table and clear.
- The arm is empty.

Goal: yellow_block_1 must be on the table. That's straightforward. But the constraints complicate things.

Constraints:
1. At some state, yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1. Well, since the initial state has yellow on white_1, we need to remove it at least once. But the goal requires it to be on the table, so that's already covered. Because once we move yellow_block_1 to the table, that condition is met. So the plan must include moving yellow_block_1 off white_block_1, which is part of achieving the goal anyway.

2. If in some state s, yellow_block_1 is not on white_block_1, then either white_block_2 is clear or white_block_2 is on green_block_1 must hold in s or after. Wait, but white_block_2 is initially on the table with green_block_1 on top. So initially, white_block_2 is not clear (since green is on it). So, the condition after moving yellow_block_1 (which makes the first constraint true) requires that either white_block_2 becomes clear or white_block_2 is stacked on green_block_1. But white_block_2 is on the table, so stacking it on green_block_1 would require green_block_1 to be clear. However, green_block_1 is on white_block_2 and is clear in the initial state. So to stack white_block_2 on green_block_1, we need to pick up white_block_2, but it has green_block_1 on top. So first, we need to unstack green from white_2. Then put white_2 somewhere, maybe on green. Wait, but the constraint is that after moving yellow, either white_2 is clear or white_2 is on green. So let's think.

Possible plan steps:

First, to move yellow_block_1 to the table. Since it's on white_block_1, we need to unstack it. So the action would be unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1. Then putdown yellow_block_1. But wait, unstacking requires the arm to be empty, which it is. After unstack, the arm is holding yellow. Then putdown yellow. That achieves the goal. Now, during this process, the first constraint is satisfied when we unstack yellow from white_1, right? Because after that action, yellow is no longer on white_1. So the state after unstack would satisfy the constraint. Then, the second constraint comes into play: if in that state (s), which is after unstack, then in s or a subsequent state, white_block_2 must be clear or on green_block_1.

Wait, in state s (after unstack), what's the status of white_block_2? Initially, green_block_1 is on white_block_2, and green is clear. So white_block_2 is not clear. So in state s (after unstacking yellow), white_block_2 is still under green. So the condition is not met. So after s, we need to ensure that either white_block_2 becomes clear (by removing green_block_1 from it) or white_block_2 is stacked on green_block_1 (but that's impossible because green is on white_2; you can't stack white_2 on green unless green is on top of something else. Wait, stacking white_block_2 on green_block_1 would require moving white_block_2, but white_block_2 is under green. So first, we need to unstack green from white_2, then putdown green, then pick up white_2 and stack it on green. But that would take more steps, and maybe the plan is to do that after moving yellow.

But the constraint is that after the state where yellow is not on white_1 (which is after the unstack action), then in that state or later, white_block_2 must be clear or on green. So in the state after unstack, white_block_2 is not clear (green is on it). So the condition isn't met in s. Therefore, we need to take actions such that in some state after s (i.e., after the unstack), white_block_2 becomes clear or is stacked on green.

So after unstacking yellow, we have to handle white_block_2. Let's see:

Possible steps after unstack yellow:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1 → holding yellow.
2. putdown yellow_block_1 → yellow is on table. Now, the goal is achieved. But the constraint requires that after the state where yellow is not on white_1 (which is after step 1), in that state or later, white_block_2 must be clear or on green. But in the state after step 2, white_block_2 still has green on it. So the condition isn't met. Therefore, we need to do something else.

So perhaps after moving yellow, we need to do something with white_block_2 and green_block_1.

But the problem is that the goal only requires yellow to be on the table. So the minimal plan would be unstack and putdown. But that violates the second constraint because after unstack, we are in a state where the condition (white_block_2 clear or on green) is not met, and we need to ensure that it is met in some subsequent state.

Wait, the constraint says: if the first condition (yellow not on white_1) holds in some state s, then the second condition must hold at s or after. So in the state after unstack (s), the second condition must hold either in s or in a later state. So after step 1 (unstack), s is the state where yellow is not on white_1. In s, white_block_2 is still under green, so not clear. So the second condition requires that in s or after, white_block_2 is clear or on green. So after s, we need to make sure that either white_block_2 is clear (by removing green) or stack white_2 on green.

But how? Because white_2 is under green. To clear white_2, we need to unstack green from white_2 and put it somewhere. Let's think:

After step 1 (unstack yellow from white_1), the arm is holding yellow. Then step 2: putdown yellow. Now, we have yellow on table. Now, to address the constraint, we need to handle white_2 and green. Let's say we then unstack green from white_2. But to do that, the arm must be empty. After step 2, the arm is empty. So step 3: unstack green_block_1 white_block_2. Then step 4: putdown green_block_1. Now, white_block_2 is clear. So after step 4, the second condition (white_block_2 is clear) is satisfied. Therefore, the constraint is met because after s (state after step 1), in a later state (step 4), white_block_2 becomes clear.

But then, the plan would be:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1
3. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
4. putdown green_block_1

But this plan achieves the goal (yellow on table) and meets the constraints. Let's check:

- The first constraint requires that at least one state has yellow not on white_1. Step 1 achieves that. So that's covered.

- The second constraint: after state s (step 1), in some later state, white_block_2 is clear. That happens at step 4. So the constraint is satisfied.

But is this the minimal plan? Let's see. The goal is achieved at step 2. Steps 3 and 4 are needed to satisfy the constraints. But is there a shorter way?

Wait, another approach: maybe after unstacking yellow (step 1), instead of putting it down immediately, use the held yellow block to do something else that would allow us to satisfy the constraint. But the goal requires yellow to be on the table, so we have to put it down eventually. Alternatively, stack it somewhere else, but that would require another block. But the goal is to have yellow on the table, so stacking it would require unstacking again, leading to more steps. So perhaps the initial approach is better.

Wait, but another idea: after unstacking yellow (step 1), can we then stack it on another block and then put it down? But that would take more steps. Let's think.

Alternatively, after unstacking yellow (step 1), we have to put it down (step 2), but then we need to do steps 3 and 4. So total 4 steps.

But maybe there's a way to combine actions. For example, after unstacking yellow (step 1), instead of putting it down, could we stack it on some block, but that would require another clear block. Let's see the blocks available. The other blocks on the table are white_block_2 (with green on top), orange_block_1, orange_2, red_1. Wait, but white_block_2 has green on top. So to stack yellow on white_block_2, you need to have white_block_2 clear. Which it's not. So that's not possible. Alternatively, stack yellow on orange_1. But orange_1 is clear. So:

After step 1 (holding yellow), stack yellow orange_1. Then, unstack yellow orange_1 (since the goal requires yellow on table). But that would add steps.

Alternatively, after step 1 (holding yellow), put it down (step 2), then unstack green from white_2 (step3), then putdown green (step4). So that's four steps. But maybe there's a way to do it in fewer steps.

Wait, what if after step 1 (unstack yellow), instead of putting it down, we use the held yellow to do something that helps with the constraint. For example, stack yellow on green_block_1. Wait, green is on white_2. So stacking yellow on green would require green to be clear, which it is. So:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
2. stack yellow_block_1 green_block_1
3. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1

But this would result in yellow being on green, then moved to table. However, after step 2, yellow is on green. Then, in step 3, unstacking yellow from green would leave green clear. Then, putdown yellow. But during this process:

After step 1, yellow is not on white_1 (satisfies constraint 1). Then, after step 2, white_block_2 still has green on it. So the condition for constraint 2 would need to be met. But after step 3, when we unstack yellow from green, green is clear again. But white_block_2 is under green, so green is on white_2, and after step 3, green is clear. Wait, no: unstacking yellow from green would make green clear, but green is still on white_2. So white_block_2 is not clear. So in this scenario, after step 3, green is on white_2 and is clear. So white_block_2 is not clear. So the constraint requires that after step 1 (where yellow is not on white_1), in some subsequent state, white_block_2 must be clear or on green. In this case, after step 3, white_block_2 is not clear (green is on it), and green is clear. So that doesn't satisfy the constraint. Therefore, this approach might not work.

Hmm. Alternatively, after step 1, we could unstack green from white_2 while holding yellow. Wait, no. The arm can only hold one block. So to unstack green from white_2, the arm must be empty. So after step 1, the arm is holding yellow. So you can't unstack green unless you put down yellow first. So step 2: putdown yellow. Then step3: unstack green from white_2. Then step4: putdown green. So this brings us back to the original four-step plan.

So the minimal plan seems to be four steps. But let me check again.

Original plan:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1 → holding yellow, white_block_1 becomes clear.

2. putdown yellow_block_1 → yellow is on table. Arm empty.

3. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2 → holding green.

4. putdown green_block_1 → green is on table. White_block_2 is now clear.

This satisfies the goal (yellow on table), and the constraints:

- At step 1, yellow is not on white_1 (satisfies the first constraint).

- After step 1 (state s), we need white_block_2 to be clear or on green in s or later. At step 4, white_block_2 is clear. So it's satisfied.

So this plan is four steps. Is there a way to do it in three steps?

Wait, what if after unstacking green (step3), instead of putting it down, we stack it somewhere else. For example, stack green on orange_1. Then step4 would be stack green orange_1. But that would make orange_1 not clear. But that's not necessary. However, this doesn't save steps. It would still take four steps: unstack yellow, putdown, unstack green, stack green somewhere. But the constraint is satisfied when green is unstacked and putdown, making white_2 clear.

Alternatively, after step3 (unstack green), can we put it on another block in one step? Like stack green orange_1. Then step4: stack green orange_1. Then step5: putdown yellow. No, that's more steps. So the minimal seems to be four steps.

But wait, the problem says to provide an optimal plan, which is as short as possible. Let's see.

Alternative approach:

Is there a way to avoid having to move green? Because moving green adds two steps (unstack and putdown). If there's a way to satisfy the constraint without moving green.

The constraint says that after moving yellow off white_1, either white_2 is clear or white_2 is on green. White_2 is initially on the table with green on top. So white_2 is not clear. The only way to make white_2 be on green is to stack white_2 on green. But green is currently on white_2. To stack white_2 on green, you need to first move green somewhere else, then pick up white_2 and stack it on green. Which requires several steps. So that's more steps than the previous plan.

Alternatively, can we somehow stack white_2 on green while green is on white_2? No, because stacking white_2 on green would require white_2 to be picked up, but white_2 has green on top. So first, you need to unstack green from white_2, then put it somewhere, then pick up white_2 and stack it on green. That's three steps (unstack green, putdown green, pickup white_2, stack white_2 green). Then the constraint would be satisfied in the state where white_2 is on green. But this is longer than the initial plan.

So the initial four-step plan seems to be the minimal. Let's confirm.

Plan steps:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1 → holding yellow.

2. putdown yellow_block_1 → yellow on table. Now, the goal is achieved, but need to check constraints.

After step 1, constraint 1 is satisfied. Now, the second constraint requires that after step 1, white_block_2 must be clear or on green at some point. Since after step 2, white_block_2 still has green on it, we need to proceed.

3. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2 → holding green.

4. putdown green_block_1 → green on table, white_block_2 clear.

Thus, in step 4, white_block_2 is clear, satisfying the constraint. So this plan works in four steps.

Is there a way to do it in three steps? Let's think. Suppose after unstacking yellow (step1), we immediately unstack green. But the arm is holding yellow, so we can't unstack green. So no. Alternatively, after putting down yellow (step2), the arm is empty. Then unstack green (step3), putdown green (step4). So four steps. No way around it.

Therefore, the optimal plan is four steps.
