Let's break down the problem step by step to find an optimal plan that satisfies all the given constraints.

### Initial State:
- white_block_1 is on the table, with yellow_block_1 on top of it (and yellow_block_1 is clear).
- white_block_2 is on the table, with green_block_1 on top of it (and green_block_1 is clear).
- orange_block_1, orange_block_2, and red_block_1 are on the table and clear.
- The robotic arm is not holding any block.

### Goal:
- yellow_block_1 is on the table.

### Constraints:
1. At some point, yellow_block_1 must not be on top of white_block_1.
2. If yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 at some state, then either:
   - white_block_2 is clear, or
   - white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1 must hold at that state or a later state.

### Plan Steps:
1. To move yellow_block_1 to the table, we first need to unstack it from white_block_1.
   - Preconditions for "unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1":
     - yellow_block_1 is on white_block_1 (true).
     - yellow_block_1 is clear (true).
     - The arm is not holding any block (true).
   - Effects:
     - yellow_block_1 is no longer on white_block_1 (satisfies the first constraint).
     - white_block_1 becomes clear.
     - The arm is now holding yellow_block_1.

2. Now, we can put down yellow_block_1 on the table to achieve the goal.
   - Preconditions for "putdown yellow_block_1":
     - The arm is holding yellow_block_1 (true).
   - Effects:
     - yellow_block_1 is on the table (goal achieved).
     - yellow_block_1 is clear.
     - The arm is no longer holding any block.

### Checking Constraints:
- After the first action ("unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1"), yellow_block_1 is no longer on top of white_block_1 (first constraint satisfied).
- At this state, we check the second constraint:
  - white_block_2 is not clear (green_block_1 is on top of it).
  - white_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1 (white_block_2 is on the table).
  - However, after the next action ("putdown yellow_block_1"), the state does not change regarding white_block_2 or green_block_1. Thus, the second constraint is not satisfied yet.

To satisfy the second constraint, we need to ensure that either:
- white_block_2 is clear, or
- white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1 at some point after yellow_block_1 is not on white_block_1.

We can achieve this by adding an action to make white_block_2 clear (by unstacking green_block_1 from white_block_2) after unstacking yellow_block_1 but before putting it down.

### Revised Plan:
1. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is no longer on white_block_1; first constraint satisfied).
2. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2 (now white_block_2 is clear; second constraint satisfied).
3. putdown yellow_block_1 (goal achieved).
4. putdown green_block_1 (to leave the blocks in a valid state).

However, this plan is longer than necessary. Instead, we can satisfy the second constraint by ensuring that white_block_2 is clear after unstacking yellow_block_1. The simplest way is to unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2 after unstacking yellow_block_1, but this makes the plan longer. 

Alternatively, the second constraint is satisfied if white_block_2 is clear at any point after yellow_block_1 is not on white_block_1. Since the goal only requires yellow_block_1 to be on the table, we can leave green_block_1 on white_block_2, and the second constraint is not violated because it is not required to hold immediately. 

But the constraint says "must hold at s or at some state after s". Since the constraint is not required to hold immediately, the initial plan (unstack yellow_block_1, then putdown yellow_block_1) satisfies the constraints because the second constraint can be satisfied in a future state (even if not in the final state of the plan). 

However, to be safe, we can include the unstacking of green_block_1 to ensure the second constraint is satisfied within the plan.

### Final Optimal Plan:
The optimal plan that satisfies all constraints is:

```
unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
putdown yellow_block_1
```

This satisfies:
1. After the first action, yellow_block_1 is not on white_block_1 (first constraint).
2. The second constraint requires that at some point after yellow_block_1 is not on white_block_1, either white_block_2 is clear or white_block_2 is on green_block_1. In the final state, white_block_2 is not clear (green_block_1 is on it), and white_block_2 is not on green_block_1. However, the constraint allows this to hold at any state after the first constraint is satisfied, not necessarily in the final state. 

But to strictly satisfy the constraint, we need to ensure that at some point after yellow_block_1 is not on white_block_1, one of the two conditions holds. The simplest way is to unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2 after unstacking yellow_block_1, making white_block_2 clear. 

Thus, the correct optimal plan is:

```
unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
putdown yellow_block_1
putdown green_block_1
```

But this is longer. Alternatively, if the constraint is interpreted as "must hold at s or at some state after s", and "s" is the state where yellow_block_1 is not on white_block_1, then the initial plan satisfies it because the second constraint can be satisfied in a future state (even if not in the plan). 

Given the ambiguity, the safest plan that satisfies all constraints is:

```
unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
putdown yellow_block_1
```

This ensures:
1. After the first action, yellow_block_1 is not on white_block_1 (first constraint).
2. After the second action, white_block_2 is clear (second constraint).
3. The third action achieves the goal.

### Final Answer:
```
```
unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
putdown yellow_block_1
```
```
