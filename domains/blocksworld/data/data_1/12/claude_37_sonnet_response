Let's break down the problem:

We have several blocks in an initial configuration, and we need to reach a goal state. 

Initial configuration:
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1
- purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2
- purple_block_2 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- purple_block_1, purple_block_2, and brown_block_1 are clear
- No block is being held

And our goal is: you are holding yellow_block_2.

Additionally, we have a constraint: at some point during the execution of the plan, we must have both "you are holding grey_block_1" and "yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1".

Let's think about this: to hold yellow_block_2, we need to unstack it from its current position. But it has purple_block_1 on top, so we need to remove that first. On the other hand, to satisfy the constraint, we need to rearrange the blocks such that yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, and we need to hold grey_block_1. But black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1, and brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_1. So, we need to move these blocks first.

Here's how we might proceed:

1. Unstack brown_block_1 from black_block_1 (now we're holding brown_block_1).
2. Put brown_block_1 on the table (now we're not holding anything).
3. Unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_1 (now we're holding black_block_1).
4. Put black_block_1 on the table (now we're not holding anything).
5. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_2 (now we're holding purple_block_1).
6. Put purple_block_1 on the table (now we're not holding anything).
7. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1 (now we're holding yellow_block_2).
8. Put yellow_block_2 on the table (now we're not holding anything).
9. Pickup yellow_block_1 from the table (now we're holding yellow_block_1).
10. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1 (now we're not holding anything and yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1).
11. Pickup grey_block_1 from the table (now we're holding grey_block_1, and yellow_block_1 is still on top of black_block_1, satisfying the constraint).
12. Put grey_block_1 on the table (now we're not holding anything).
13. Pickup yellow_block_2 from the table (now we're holding yellow_block_2, which is our goal).

The plan should be valid, satisfying both the goal and the constraint.

But let me double-check the constraint again: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "The following conditions are all true: "you are holding grey_block_1", "yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1"""

This means that in at least one state, we must be holding grey_block_1 AND yellow_block_1 must be on top of black_block_1.

Checking my plan, at step 11, I have:
- We're holding grey_block_1.
- yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1.

So, the constraint is satisfied.

Let's now confirm the plan's optimality:

1. Unstack brown_block_1 from black_block_1 (holding brown_block_1)
2. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table
3. Unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_1 (holding black_block_1)
4. Putdown black_block_1 on the table
5. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_2 (holding purple_block_1)
6. Putdown purple_block_1 on the table
7. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1 (holding yellow_block_2)
8. Putdown yellow_block_2 on the table
9. Pickup yellow_block_1 from the table
10. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1
11. Pickup grey_block_1 from the table (holding grey_block_1, and yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1)
12. Putdown grey_block_1 on the table
13. Pickup yellow_block_2 from the table

Actually, upon further reflection, I think I can optimize the plan. Our goal is to be holding yellow_block_2, and we also need to satisfy the constraint. 

Here's a more optimized approach:

1. Unstack brown_block_1 from black_block_1 (holding brown_block_1)
2. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table
3. Unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_1 (holding black_block_1)
4. Putdown black_block_1 on the table
5. Pickup grey_block_1 from the table (holding grey_block_1)
6. Putdown grey_block_1 on the table (not holding anything)
7. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_2 (holding purple_block_1)
8. Putdown purple_block_1 on the table
9. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1 (holding yellow_block_2)
10. Putdown yellow_block_2 on the table
11. Pickup yellow_block_1 from the table (holding yellow_block_1)
12. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1)
13. Pickup grey_block_1 from the table (holding grey_block_1, and yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1)
14. Putdown grey_block_1 on the table
15. Pickup yellow_block_2 from the table (holding yellow_block_2)

This plan is actually 15 steps, which is not optimal. I need to think more about how to optimize it.

Let's re-inspect the initial configuration:
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1
- purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2
- purple_block_2 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- purple_block_1, purple_block_2, and brown_block_1 are clear
- No block is being held

And our goal is: you are holding yellow_block_2.

To clarify, the constraint doesn't have to hold in the final state; it just needs to hold at least once during the execution.

We need to clear yellow_block_2 first because it has purple_block_1 on top of it. From the constraint, we also need to manipulate yellow_block_1 and black_block_1 such that the former is on top of the latter, and we need to hold grey_block_1 at the same time. 

I realized there's an unnecessary step. I have grey_block_1 being picked up and put down without any purpose. Let's try a more streamlined approach:

1. Unstack brown_block_1 from black_block_1 (holding brown_block_1)
2. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table
3. Unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_1 (holding black_block_1)
4. Putdown black_block_1 on the table
5. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_2 (holding purple_block_1)
6. Putdown purple_block_1 on the table
7. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1 (holding yellow_block_2)
8. Stack yellow_block_2 on some other clear block, say purple_block_2 (not holding anything)
9. Pickup yellow_block_1 from the table (holding yellow_block_1)
10. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1 (not holding anything)
11. Pickup grey_block_1 from the table (holding grey_block_1, and yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1)
12. Putdown grey_block_1 on the table (not holding anything)
13. Unstack yellow_block_2 from purple_block_2 (holding yellow_block_2)

But wait, is it really necessary to stack yellow_block_2 on another block in step 8? We could just put it on the table:

1. Unstack brown_block_1 from black_block_1 (holding brown_block_1)
2. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table
3. Unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_1 (holding black_block_1)
4. Putdown black_block_1 on the table
5. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_2 (holding purple_block_1)
6. Putdown purple_block_1 on the table
7. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1 (holding yellow_block_2)
8. Putdown yellow_block_2 on the table (not holding anything)
9. Pickup yellow_block_1 from the table (holding yellow_block_1)
10. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1 (not holding anything)
11. Pickup grey_block_1 from the table (holding grey_block_1, and yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1)
12. Putdown grey_block_1 on the table (not holding anything)
13. Pickup yellow_block_2 from the table (holding yellow_block_2)

After reviewing, I think this is optimal. For clarity, let's add the exact action names according to your domain description:

1. unstack brown_block_1 black_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1
4. putdown black_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_2
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
8. putdown yellow_block_2
9. pickup yellow_block_1
10. stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1
11. pickup grey_block_1 (constraint is satisfied here)
12. putdown grey_block_1
13. pickup yellow_block_2

Actually, I need to double-check if there's a more optimal approach. For instance, maybe we don't need to rearrange all the blocks:

1. Unstack brown_block_1 from black_block_1.
2. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table.
3. Unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_1.
4. Putdown black_block_1 on the table.
5. Pickup grey_block_1 from the table.
6. Putdown grey_block_1 on the table.
7. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_2.
8. Putdown purple_block_1 on the table.
9. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1.
10. Putdown yellow_block_2 on the table.
11. Pickup yellow_block_1 from the table.
12. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1.
13. Pickup grey_block_1 from the table.
14. Putdown grey_block_1 on the table.
15. Pickup yellow_block_2 from the table.

But steps 5 and 6 here are redundant. I'm picking up grey_block_1 and immediately putting it back down. This doesn't serve any purpose, so I'd remove these steps.

Upon further reflection, I think the approach I came up with earlier is indeed the optimal one. Let's double-check:

1. unstack brown_block_1 black_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1
4. putdown black_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_2
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
8. putdown yellow_block_2
9. pickup yellow_block_1
10. stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1
11. pickup grey_block_1 (constraint is satisfied here)
12. putdown grey_block_1
13. pickup yellow_block_2

Wait, I'm slightly confused by the constraint: "The following conditions are all true: "you are holding grey_block_1", "yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1""
While the constraint says we need both conditions to be true, I need to ensure that they're both true in the same state. Looking at the plan above, at step 11, we're holding grey_block_1 AND yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1. So, the constraint is satisfied.

Let me make sure there's no way to get the same goal with fewer steps:

Our goal is to be holding yellow_block_2. In order to unstack yellow_block_2, we first need to unstack purple_block_1. So, the first part of our plan is definitely needed:

1. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_2
2. putdown purple_block_1
3. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1

Now, we're left with holding yellow_block_2, which is our goal. But wait, we haven't satisfied the constraint yet!

For the constraint, we need to have yellow_block_1 on top of black_block_1 AND be holding grey_block_1. Currently, black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1, and on top of black_block_1 is brown_block_1.

So, we need to rearrange things such that yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1. Given our current state (holding yellow_block_2), we'd need to put yellow_block_2 down, then continue with the rearrangement.

Actually, I think the plan I've laid out is a pretty good one given the constraints. Let's check one more time to ensure it works:

1. unstack brown_block_1 black_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1
4. putdown black_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_2
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
8. putdown yellow_block_2
9. pickup yellow_block_1
10. stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1
11. pickup grey_block_1 (constraint is satisfied here)
12. putdown grey_block_1
13. pickup yellow_block_2

And in the end, we're holding yellow_block_2, which is our goal.

But there might be a simpler route:

1. unstack brown_block_1 black_block_1 (holding brown_block_1)
2. putdown brown_block_1 (not holding anything)
3. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1 (holding black_block_1)
4. putdown black_block_1 (not holding anything)
5. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_2 (holding purple_block_1)
6. putdown purple_block_1 (not holding anything)
7. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1 (holding yellow_block_2)
8. putdown yellow_block_2 (not holding anything)
9. pickup yellow_block_1 (holding yellow_block_1)
10. stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1 (not holding anything, yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1)
11. pickup grey_block_1 (holding grey_block_1, and yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1)
12. putdown grey_block_1 (not holding anything)
13. pickup yellow_block_2 (holding yellow_block_2, our goal)

Alright, I think I've analyzed this enough. This plan should be optimal.

Actually, I think there is a more optimal plan. Instead of picking up and putting down grey_block_1, we could directly swap yellow_block_2 and grey_block_1:

1. unstack brown_block_1 black_block_1 (holding brown_block_1)
2. putdown brown_block_1 (not holding anything)
3. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1 (holding black_block_1)
4. putdown black_block_1 (not holding anything)
5. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_2 (holding purple_block_1)
6. putdown purple_block_1 (not holding anything)
7. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1 (holding yellow_block_2)
8. stack yellow_block_2 on some other clear block (maybe brown_block_1) (not holding anything)
9. pickup yellow_block_1 (holding yellow_block_1)
10. stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1 (not holding anything, yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1)
11. pickup grey_block_1 (holding grey_block_1, and yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1)
12. stack grey_block_1 on some clear block (not holding anything)
13. unstack yellow_block_2 from brown_block_1 (holding yellow_block_2, our goal)

But this is also the same length (13 steps), and there's some risk in assuming we can stack on arbitrary blocks without conflict.

Going back to our original approach, I'm confident it's a valid and optimal plan.

1. unstack brown_block_1 black_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1
4. putdown black_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_2
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
8. putdown yellow_block_2
9. pickup yellow_block_1
10. stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1
11. pickup grey_block_1 (constraint is satisfied here)
12. putdown grey_block_1
13. pickup yellow_block_2

Actually, there's one more optimization I can consider: I don't need to interact with yellow_block_1 at all unless I'm satisfying the constraint. This would save 2 more steps:

1. unstack brown_block_1 black_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1
4. putdown black_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_2
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
8. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2
9. pickup yellow_block_1
10. stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1
11. pickup grey_block_1 (constraint is satisfied here)
12. putdown grey_block_1
13. unstack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2

Or I could put yellow_block_2 on the table and then pickup, which would be the same length:

1. unstack brown_block_1 black_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1
4. putdown black_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_2
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
8. putdown yellow_block_2
9. pickup yellow_block_1
10. stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1
11. pickup grey_block_1 (constraint is satisfied here)
12. putdown grey_block_1
13. pickup yellow_block_2

OK, I'm overthinking this. The plan is valid and I'm pretty sure it's optimal.

Acutally, I can make a small change to make the plan 12 steps. Instead of picking up yellow_block_1 and stacking on black_block_1, I can stack black_block_1 on yellow_block_1. This saves a step:

1. unstack brown_block_1 black_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1
4. stack black_block_1 yellow_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_2
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack yellow_block_2 black_block_1
8. putdown yellow_block_2
9. unstack black_block_1 yellow_block_1
10. putdown black_block_1
11. pickup yellow_block_2 (not satisfying constraint)

Wait, that was a mistake, I thought I was getting a shorter plan, but I'm not, and I'm also not satisfying the constraint.

Actually, I can't see a way to get a shorter plan than 13 steps. Let's stick with our original plan.

Wait, I think I can make a shorter plan after all!

Initial configuration:
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1
- purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2
- purple_block_2 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- No block is being held

Goal: you are holding yellow_block_2.

Constraint: At least once, both "you are holding grey_block_1" and "yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1".

The big idea is to satisfy the constraint by placing yellow_block_1 on top of black_block_1, then picking up grey_block_1. Then, we need to get back to holding yellow_block_2. Here's how:

1. unstack brown_block_1 black_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1
4. putdown black_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_2
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
8. putdown yellow_block_2
9. pickup yellow_block_1
10. stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1
11. pickup grey_block_1 (constraint is satisfied here)
12. putdown grey_block_1
13. pickup yellow_block_2

I think stacking the blocks differently, like stacking yellow_block_2 on a block other than the table, doesn't save any steps, and assuming we can stack on arbitrary blocks may introduce issues.

OK, I'm convinced this is the best I can do. This is a plan with 13 steps that satisfies both the goal and the constraint.

Actually I'm not giving up yet. Can I find an 11 or 12 step plan?

The constraint is the challenging part. If we didn't have the constraint, the goal would be simple: just unstack blocks until we get to yellow_block_2 and then pick it up. But the constraint requires us to do some additional manipulation.

Let's think creatively:

Initial configuration (and the clear blocks are: purple_block_1, purple_block_2, and brown_block_1):
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1
- purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2
- purple_block_2 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- No block is being held

1. unstack brown_block_1 black_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1
4. putdown black_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_2
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
8. putdown yellow_block_2

At this point, I have:
- yellow_block_1, yellow_block_2, grey_block_1, black_block_1, purple_block_1, purple_block_2, and brown_block_1 are all on the table.
- No block is on top of any other block.
- No block is being held.

Let me see if I can arrange blocks to satisfy the constraint more efficiently:

9. pickup yellow_block_1
10. stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1
11. pickup grey_block_1 (constraint is satisfied here)
12. putdown grey_block_1
13. pickup yellow_block_2

I still end up with a 13-step plan. But let's try something different. Instead of restacking yellow_block_1 and black_block_1, what if I move yellow_block_2 back to yellow_block_1 and hold grey_block_1?

1. unstack brown_block_1 black_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1
4. stack black_block_1 yellow_block_1 (This way yellow_block_1 is not on top of black_block_1, but the reverse, which doesn't satisfy the constraint).

Ah, I was trying something, but it didn't work out.

Ok, no I'm convinced taht 13 steps is the minimum for this problem.

Let's re-validate our 13-step plan one more time to make sure it's correct:

1. unstack brown_block_1 black_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1
4. putdown black_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_2
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
8. putdown yellow_block_2
9. pickup yellow_block_1
10. stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1
11. pickup grey_block_1 (constraint is satisfied here)
12. putdown grey_block_1
13. pickup yellow_block_2

This plan ensures that "you are holding yellow_block_2" in the end and that there's at least one state where "you are holding grey_block_1" and "yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1".

Do I have anything else to check? Let's double-check the validity of the plan by walking through it step by step:

Initial configuration:
- yellow_block_1 is on the table, clear: No
- grey_block_1 is on the table, clear: No
- black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1, clear: No
- yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1, clear: No
- purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2, clear: Yes
- purple_block_2 is on the table, clear: Yes
- brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, clear: Yes
- No block is being held

1. unstack brown_block_1 black_block_1 (now holding brown_block_1, black_block_1 is clear)
2. putdown brown_block_1 (now not holding anything, brown_block_1 is on the table and clear)
3. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1 (now holding black_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear)
4. putdown black_block_1 (now not holding anything, black_block_1 is on the table and clear)
5. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_2 (now holding purple_block_1, yellow_block_2 is clear)
6. putdown purple_block_1 (now not holding anything, purple_block_1 is on the table and clear)
7. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1 (now holding yellow_block_2, yellow_block_1 is clear)
8. putdown yellow_block_2 (now not holding anything, yellow_block_2 is on the table and clear)
9. pickup yellow_block_1 (now holding yellow_block_1)
10. stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1 (now not holding anything, yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1 and yellow_block_1 is clear, black_block_1 is not clear)
11. pickup grey_block_1 (now holding grey_block_1, and yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1 => constraint is satisfied)
12. putdown grey_block_1 (now not holding anything, grey_block_1 is on the table and clear)
13. pickup yellow_block_2 (now holding yellow_block_2, which is the goal)

Everything checks out. This plan is valid and should fulfill all requirements.

But can it be shortened? Let me think one more time.

Actually, let me consider a scenario where I pick up grey_block_1 earlier in the plan.

Initial configuration:
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1
- purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2
- purple_block_2 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- No block is being held

For the constraint to be satisfied, we need to: (a) be holding grey_block_1 and (b) have yellow_block_1 on top of black_block_1. 

Currently, black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1, and there's a stack on top of that. We need to move those blocks before we can pick up grey_block_1.

And yellow_block_1 has yellow_block_2 and purple_block_1 on top of it, so we need to move those blocks before we can move yellow_block_1.

I still believe the 13-step plan is the shortest.

I think the 13-step plan we came up with is the optimal one.

Let's make sure our actions are correctly formatted:

1. unstack brown_block_1 black_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1
4. putdown black_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_2
