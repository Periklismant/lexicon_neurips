To solve this planning problem, we need to find a sequence of actions that results in the robotic arm holding `yellow_block_2`, while also ensuring that at some point during the execution of the plan, the conditions "you are holding grey_block_1" and "yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" are both true. 

### Initial State:
- `yellow_block_1` is on the table.
- `grey_block_1` is on the table.
- `black_block_1` is on top of `grey_block_1`.
- `yellow_block_2` is on top of `yellow_block_1`.
- `purple_block_1` is on top of `yellow_block_2`.
- `purple_block_2` is on the table.
- `brown_block_1` is on top of `black_block_1`.
- `purple_block_1`, `purple_block_2`, and `brown_block_1` are clear.
- The robotic arm is not holding any block.

### Goal:
- The robotic arm is holding `yellow_block_2`.

### Constraints:
- At some point, the robotic arm must be holding `grey_block_1` and `yellow_block_1` must be on top of `black_block_1`.

### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. **Unstack `brown_block_1` from `black_block_1`**: This is necessary to make `black_block_1` clear so that we can later place `yellow_block_1` on it.
   - Preconditions: `brown_block_1` is clear, `brown_block_1` is on `black_block_1`, arm is empty.
   - Effects: Arm holds `brown_block_1`, `black_block_1` becomes clear.

2. **Putdown `brown_block_1` on the table**: This frees the arm to pick up other blocks.
   - Preconditions: Arm is holding `brown_block_1`.
   - Effects: `brown_block_1` is on the table and clear, arm is empty.

3. **Unstack `black_block_1` from `grey_block_1`**: This is necessary to pick up `grey_block_1` later.
   - Preconditions: `black_block_1` is clear (after step 1), `black_block_1` is on `grey_block_1`, arm is empty.
   - Effects: Arm holds `black_block_1`, `grey_block_1` becomes clear.

4. **Stack `black_block_1` on `yellow_block_1`**: This satisfies the constraint that `yellow_block_1` is on top of `black_block_1`. However, `yellow_block_1` is currently under `yellow_block_2` and `purple_block_1`, so we need to first clear `yellow_block_1`.
   - But this step is not directly possible because `yellow_block_1` is not clear. We need to first unstack `purple_block_1` and `yellow_block_2` from `yellow_block_1`.

5. **Unstack `purple_block_1` from `yellow_block_2`**: This is necessary to access `yellow_block_2`.
   - Preconditions: `purple_block_1` is clear, `purple_block_1` is on `yellow_block_2`, arm is empty.
   - Effects: Arm holds `purple_block_1`, `yellow_block_2` becomes clear.

6. **Putdown `purple_block_1` on the table**: This frees the arm to pick up `yellow_block_2`.
   - Preconditions: Arm is holding `purple_block_1`.
   - Effects: `purple_block_1` is on the table and clear, arm is empty.

7. **Unstack `yellow_block_2` from `yellow_block_1`**: This is necessary to make `yellow_block_1` clear so we can stack `black_block_1` on it.
   - Preconditions: `yellow_block_2` is clear (after step 5), `yellow_block_2` is on `yellow_block_1`, arm is empty.
   - Effects: Arm holds `yellow_block_2`, `yellow_block_1` becomes clear.

8. **Stack `black_block_1` on `yellow_block_1`**: Now `yellow_block_1` is clear, so we can stack `black_block_1` on it.
   - Preconditions: Arm is holding `black_block_1`, `yellow_block_1` is clear.
   - Effects: `black_block_1` is on `yellow_block_1`, `yellow_block_1` is no longer clear, arm is empty.

   At this point, the constraint is satisfied: `yellow_block_1` is on top of `black_block_1` (from step 8), and we will next pick up `grey_block_1` to satisfy the other part of the constraint.

9. **Pickup `grey_block_1`**: Now `grey_block_1` is clear (from step 3), so we can pick it up.
   - Preconditions: `grey_block_1` is clear, `grey_block_1` is on the table, arm is empty.
   - Effects: Arm holds `grey_block_1`, `grey_block_1` is no longer on the table.

   Now the constraint is fully satisfied: the arm is holding `grey_block_1` and `yellow_block_1` is on top of `black_block_1`.

10. **Putdown `grey_block_1` on the table**: This frees the arm to pick up `yellow_block_2` again.
    - Preconditions: Arm is holding `grey_block_1`.
    - Effects: `grey_block_1` is on the table and clear, arm is empty.

11. **Pickup `yellow_block_2`**: Now `yellow_block_2` is on the table (from step 7), so we can pick it up to achieve the goal.
    - Preconditions: `yellow_block_2` is clear, `yellow_block_2` is on the table, arm is empty.
    - Effects: Arm holds `yellow_block_2`, `yellow_block_2` is no longer on the table.

### Final Plan:
```
```
unstack brown_block_1 black_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1
unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_2
putdown purple_block_1
unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
stack black_block_1 yellow_block_1
pickup grey_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
pickup yellow_block_2
```
