Okay, let's see. I need to figure out a plan to get the robotic arm holding yellow_block_2 in the end. But there's also this constraint that at some point, the arm is holding grey_block_1 and yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1. Hmm.

First, let me visualize the initial state. Let's list the blocks and their positions:

- yellow_block_1 is on the table.
- grey_block_1 is on the table with black_block_1 on top of it. But wait, no, wait. Wait the initial state says "black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1". So grey_block_1 is on the table, black_block_1 is on grey_block_1, and brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_1. So the stack is grey_block_1 -> black_block_1 -> brown_block_1. But brown_block_1 is clear. Then, yellow_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_2 on top of it, and purple_block_1 on top of yellow_block_2. So that's a stack of yellow_block_1 -> yellow_block_2 -> purple_block_1. Purple_block_1 is clear. Purple_block_2 is alone on the table. 

The goal is to have the arm holding yellow_block_2. But we need to have a state where the arm is holding grey_block_1 and yellow_block_1 is on black_block_1. So at some point in the plan, those two conditions must be true.

So first, the main goal is to hold yellow_block_2. Let's think about how to get that. In the initial state, yellow_block_2 is under purple_block_1. So to pick up yellow_block_2, we need to first unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_2. But to do that, the arm has to be empty, and purple_block_1 is clear, which it is. So unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_2. Then put it down somewhere. Then we can pick up yellow_block_2. Wait, but yellow_block_2 is on yellow_block_1. So to pick up yellow_block_2, since it's on the table? Wait no, yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1, which is on the table. So yellow_block_2 is not on the table. So to pick up yellow_block_2, you can't use pickup because it's not on the table. You have to unstack it from yellow_block_1. But to do that, it needs to be clear. However, in the initial state, purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2. So first, unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_2. Then putdown purple_block_1. Now yellow_block_2 is clear. Then unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. Then you're holding yellow_block_2. That would achieve the goal. But we need to satisfy the constraint that at some point, the arm is holding grey_block_1 and yellow_block_1 is on black_block_1.

Wait, but the constraint is that in at least one state during the plan, those two conditions must be true. So perhaps during the process, we need to make that happen. Let's see.

So the main steps to get yellow_block_2 would involve:

1. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_2 (since purple_block_1 is on top).
2. Putdown purple_block_1.
3. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1 (now that it's clear).
4. Now holding yellow_block_2. That's the goal. But wait, the goal is to bring about that the arm is holding yellow_block_2. So step 3 would achieve that. But we need to include the constraint.

But the problem is that during this process, we need to have a state where the arm is holding grey_block_1 and yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1.

So how can we get there?

First, let's see where grey_block_1 is. It's on the table, with black_block_1 on top of it, and brown_block_1 on top of black_block_1. So the stack is grey_block_1 -> black_block_1 -> brown_block_1. To hold grey_block_1, since it's on the table, but there's a block on top (black_block_1). Wait, no. Wait, in the initial state, grey_block_1 is on the table, and black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1. So grey_block_1 is under black_block_1. So to pick up grey_block_1, we need to clear it. But grey_block_1 has black_block_1 on top of it, so we can't pick it up unless black_block_1 is removed. So to hold grey_block_1, we need to first unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_1, then unstack brown_block_1 from black_block_1? Wait no. Wait the stack is grey_block_1 (table) -> black_block_1 -> brown_block_1. So brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, which is on grey_block_1. So grey_block_1 is on table, has black_block_1 on it, which in turn has brown_block_1. So grey_block_1 is not clear. So to get grey_block_1, you need to first remove the blocks on top of it. So first unstack brown_block_1 from black_block_1. Then put it down. Then unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_1. Then put down black_block_1. Now grey_block_1 is clear and on table. Then you can pickup grey_block_1. But that's a lot of steps. But how does that fit into the plan? Because the goal is to hold yellow_block_2. So perhaps we need to find a way to have the required state (holding grey_block_1 and yellow_block_1 on black_block_1) while moving towards the main goal.

But how to get yellow_block_1 on top of black_block_1? Currently, yellow_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_2 and purple_block_1 on top. So to move yellow_block_1 onto black_block_1, you'd need to first clear black_block_1. But black_block_1 is under brown_block_1. So to get black_block_1 clear, you need to remove brown_block_1. Then stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1. But yellow_block_1 is currently under yellow_block_2. So to move yellow_block_1, you need to first remove the blocks on top of it. So first, unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_2, put it down. Then unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. Now yellow_block_1 is clear. Then you can pick up yellow_block_1 and stack it on black_block_1 (if black_block_1 is clear). But to do that, black_block_1 needs to be clear. Currently, black_block_1 has brown_block_1 on top. So to clear black_block_1, you need to unstack brown_block_1. So steps would be:

1. Unstack brown_block_1 from black_block_1. Put it down.
2. Unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 is clear.
3. Pick up yellow_block_1. But wait, yellow_block_1 is under yellow_block_2. So first need to clear yellow_block_1 by removing yellow_block_2 and purple_block_1.

But this is getting complicated. Let's see.

The required condition for the constraint is that at some state, the arm is holding grey_block_1 and yellow_block_1 is on black_block_1.

So to get yellow_block_1 on black_block_1:

- Black_block_1 must be clear. So remove brown_block_1 (unstack brown_block_1 from black_block_1 and put it down).

- Then black_block_1 is clear. Then stack yellow_block_1 onto black_block_1.

But to stack yellow_block_1 onto black_block_1, you need to have yellow_block_1 in hand. But yellow_block_1 is under yellow_block_2. So:

- Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_2 (putdown purple_block_1).

- Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1 (putdown yellow_block_2).

Now yellow_block_1 is clear. Then pickup yellow_block_1 and stack it on black_block_1.

But then we have yellow_block_1 on black_block_1. Then, to get the arm holding grey_block_1, we need to have grey_block_1 clear. Since grey_block_1 initially has black_block_1 on it. But if black_block_1 was moved (stacked with yellow_block_1), then after unstacking black_block_1 from grey_block_1, then grey_block_1 is clear. Wait, no. If we first unstack brown_block_1, then unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_1, then putdown black_block_1. Then stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1. But black_block_1 is on the table. Wait, this is getting a bit tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving brown_block_1 and black_block_1, we can stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1. Let me try to outline steps that would achieve the required condition.

Let me approach this step by step. The main goal is to hold yellow_block_2. The constraint is that during the plan, at some point, the arm is holding grey_block_1 and yellow_block_1 is on black_block_1.

So the plan must include steps that achieve that intermediate state, and then proceed to the main goal.

So possible steps:

1. To get grey_block_1 into the arm, we need to first clear it. Currently, black_block_1 is on grey_block_1. So we need to remove black_block_1. But black_block_1 has brown_block_1 on top. So first, unstack brown_block_1 from black_block_1. Put it down.

2. Then unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_1. Put it down. Now grey_block_1 is clear and on the table.

3. Now, pickup grey_block_1. But at the same time, we need yellow_block_1 to be on black_block_1. So let's think: after moving black_block_1, perhaps stack yellow_block_1 on it.

But yellow_block_1 is under yellow_block_2 and purple_block_1. So first, unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_2. Put it down.

4. Then unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. Now yellow_block_1 is clear.

5. Now, pickup yellow_block_1.

6. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1 (which is now on the table). But wait, after step 2, black_block_1 was put down. So yes, it's on the table and clear.

So stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1. Now yellow_block_1 is on black_block_1.

At this point, we have yellow_block_1 on black_block_1, and the arm is empty. But we need the arm to be holding grey_block_1. So after step 3, the arm was holding grey_block_1? Wait, no. Let's see:

Wait, step 3 was pickup grey_block_1. But after step 2, after unstacking black_block_1 from grey_block_1 and putting it down, grey_block_1 is clear. So yes, step 3 would be pickup grey_block_1. At this point, the arm is holding grey_block_1. Then, before proceeding, we need to stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, maybe the steps are:

After unstacking brown_block_1 and black_block_1, and putting them down:

- Now, grey_block_1 is clear, black_block_1 is on table.

- Then, unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1 by first removing purple_block_1.

So:

3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_2 (putdown).

4. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1 (putdown).

5. Now, yellow_block_1 is clear. Pickup yellow_block_1.

6. Stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1. Now yellow_block_1 is on black_block_1.

7. Then, pickup grey_block_1.

At this point, the arm is holding grey_block_1, and yellow_block_1 is on black_block_1. That satisfies the constraint. Then, proceed to the main goal of picking up yellow_block_2.

So after step 7, the arm is holding grey_block_1. Then we need to put it down again, perhaps. But the goal is to have the arm holding yellow_block_2 at the end.

So after achieving the constraint state (arm holding grey_block_1 and yellow_block_1 on black_block_1), the next steps would be:

8. Putdown grey_block_1.

Then, to get yellow_block_2, which was put down in step 4. So:

9. Pickup yellow_block_2 (since it's on the table now, and clear).

So the plan would be:

1. unstack brown_block_1 black_block_1

2. putdown brown_block_1

3. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1

4. putdown black_block_1

5. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_2

6. putdown purple_block_1

7. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1

8. putdown yellow_block_2

9. pickup yellow_block_1

10. stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1

11. pickup grey_block_1

At this point, the constraint is met: holding grey_block_1 and yellow_block_1 is on black_block_1. Then:

12. putdown grey_block_1

13. pickup yellow_block_2

But wait, after step 7, yellow_block_2 was unstacked and putdown in step 8. So step 13 would be possible if yellow_block_2 is on the table and clear. But yes, after step 8, it's on the table and clear. So step 13 is to pick up yellow_block_2. So the plan would end here, achieving the goal.

But let's check if this is valid. Let's check each action's preconditions.

1. unstack brown_block_1 black_block_1: brown is on black_block_1, which is on grey_block_1. brown is clear, arm is empty. Preconditions met.

2. putdown brown_block_1: holding brown_block_1. Yes.

3. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1: black is on grey, which is on table. black is clear (after step 1 removed brown). Arm is empty. Preconditions met.

4. putdown black_block_1: holding black_block_1. Yes.

5. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_2: purple is on yellow_block_2, which is on yellow_block_1. Purple is clear. Arm is empty. Preconditions met.

6. putdown purple_block_1: yes.

7. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1: yellow_block_2 is on yellow_block_1. yellow_block_2 is clear (after removing purple). Arm is empty. Preconditions met.

8. putdown yellow_block_2: yes.

9. pickup yellow_block_1: it's on the table and clear. Arm is empty. Yes.

10. stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1: holding yellow_block_1, black_block_1 is clear (since it's on table and after step 4). So stack.

11. pickup grey_block_1: grey_block_1 is on table and clear (after step 3 unstacked black_block_1). Yes.

At this point, the arm is holding grey_block_1 and yellow_block_1 is on black_block_1. So the constraint is satisfied.

12. putdown grey_block_1: holding it, so yes.

13. pickup yellow_block_2: it's on the table and clear. Arm is empty. Yes. This achieves the goal.

So this plan has 13 steps. But is there a shorter way? Let's see.

Wait, maybe some steps can be combined or avoided. Let's think.

After step 7, unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. Then in step 8, we putdown yellow_block_2. Then step 13 is to pickup it again. But instead of putting it down, could we instead stack it somewhere else and then unstack? But that would complicate. Alternatively, can we avoid putting down yellow_block_2 and instead, after unstacking it, keep it in the arm? Let's see.

Wait, the goal is to have the arm holding yellow_block_2. So if after step 7 (unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1), we're holding yellow_block_2. Then, if we can achieve the constraint while holding it, but the constraint requires holding grey_block_1. So perhaps during the process, after we have yellow_block_2 in hand, but then need to let go of it to pick up grey_block_1. But that would mean putting it down again, which adds steps.

Alternatively, maybe the plan can be optimized. Let me think again.

Alternative approach:

Let's see the main steps needed for the constraint: hold grey_block_1 and have yellow_block_1 on black_block_1. Also, the main goal is to hold yellow_block_2.

Suppose we first work on the constraint:

To get yellow_block_1 on black_block_1:

- Need to move yellow_block_1 from under yellow_block_2 and purple_block_1. So unstack purple_block_1, then unstack yellow_block_2. Then move yellow_block_1.

But also, to get grey_block_1 in hand, need to clear it by moving black_block_1 and brown_block_1.

Alternatively, maybe combine some steps.

Let's try:

1. unstack brown_block_1 from black_block_1. Put it down.

2. unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_1. Put down.

3. Now, grey_block_1 is clear. Then, unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_2. Put down.

4. unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. Now holding yellow_block_2. But the goal is to end with this. But we need to satisfy the constraint. So we need to put down yellow_block_2, then do other steps.

Wait, but maybe if we hold yellow_block_2 now, but the constraint requires that at some point we hold grey_block_1. So maybe after achieving the constraint, we can pick up yellow_block_2 again.

But let's see:

If after step 4, we are holding yellow_block_2. Then we need to put it down to do other steps. So:

4. unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. Now holding yellow_block_2.

5. putdown yellow_block_2.

6. Now, pickup yellow_block_1 and stack it on black_block_1 (which is on the table, clear).

7. pickup grey_block_1. Now, the constraint is met.

8. putdown grey_block_1.

9. pickup yellow_block_2. Done.

This plan would have 9 steps. But let's check if all preconditions are met.

1. unstack brown_block_1 black_block_1: yes.

2. putdown brown_block_1: yes.

3. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1: yes.

4. putdown black_block_1: yes.

5. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_2: yes.

6. putdown purple_block_1: yes.

7. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1: now holding yellow_block_2.

8. putdown yellow_block_2.

9. pickup yellow_block_1: it's on table and clear.

10. stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1: holding yellow_block_1, black_block_1 is clear (on table).

11. pickup grey_block_1: now holding grey_block_1, and yellow_block_1 is on black_block_1. So constraint met.

12. putdown grey_block_1.

13. pickup yellow_block_2.

This is 13 steps again. Hmm. Maybe there's a way to avoid some steps.

Wait, perhaps after step 3 (unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_1), instead of putting down black_block_1, stack it somewhere else. But where?

Alternatively, after unstacking brown_block_1 and black_block_1, can we use them to build the stack for yellow_block_1?

Alternatively, during the process of moving yellow_block_1, we need to stack it on black_block_1. So after moving black_block_1 to the table, then stack yellow_block_1 on it.

But perhaps there's a shorter path. Let me think again.

Wait, the constraint requires that in some state, the arm is holding grey_block_1 and yellow_block_1 is on black_block_1. So maybe during the process of moving yellow_block_1 to black_block_1, we have to pickup grey_block_1. Let's see:

Suppose after unstacking brown_block_1, black_block_1, and then putting them down, then:

1. unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_2.

2. putdown purple_block_1.

3. unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. Now holding yellow_block_2.

4. putdown yellow_block_2.

5. pickup yellow_block_1.

6. stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1 (which is on table and clear).

7. pickup grey_block_1. Now the constraint is met.

8. putdown grey_block_1.

9. pickup yellow_block_2.

This gives 9 steps. Wait, but how do we get to step 1? Let's outline all steps.

Full steps:

Original initial state:

Stacks:

- grey_block_1 (table) → black_block_1 → brown_block_1.

- yellow_block_1 (table) → yellow_block_2 → purple_block_1.

- purple_block_2 (table).

Steps:

1. unstack brown_block_1 black_block_1: now holding brown_block_1.

2. putdown brown_block_1.

3. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1: now holding black_block_1.

4. putdown black_block_1.

5. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_2: holding purple_block_1.

6. putdown purple_block_1.

7. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1: holding yellow_block_2.

8. putdown yellow_block_2.

9. pickup yellow_block_1: now holding yellow_block_1.

10. stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1: now yellow_block_1 is on black_block_1.

11. pickup grey_block_1: now holding grey_block_1. At this state, yellow_block_1 is on black_block_1, and arm holds grey_block_1. Constraint met.

12. putdown grey_block_1.

13. pickup yellow_block_2: goal achieved.

Total steps: 13. But is there redundancy here?

Wait, after step 7, we are holding yellow_block_2. But the goal is to be holding it. So if we can achieve the constraint while holding yellow_block_2, but that's not possible because the constraint requires holding grey_block_1. So we have to put down yellow_block_2, do other steps, then pick it up again.

But this makes the plan longer. Alternatively, can we sequence the steps to meet the constraint without having to put down yellow_block_2 twice?

For example:

After unstacking yellow_block_2 (step 7), we have to put it down (step 8), then move yellow_block_1 (steps 9-10), then pickup grey_block_1 (step 11), then put it down (12), then pickup yellow_block_2 again (13). But this seems necessary.

Alternatively, is there a way to stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1 while holding yellow_block_2? No, because to stack, you need to be holding the block to stack. So you can't stack yellow_block_1 if you're holding yellow_block_2.

So the steps are necessary.

Alternatively, after stacking yellow_block_1 on black_block_1 (step 10), we can then pickup grey_block_1 (step 11). Then, while holding grey_block_1, put it down (step 12), then pick up yellow_block_2 again. But yellow_block_2 is already on the table from step 8.

So this seems to be the minimal steps. But is there a shorter way?

Wait, what if after step 10 (stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1), we immediately pickup grey_block_1. At that point, the constraint is met. Then, we need to put down grey_block_1 and pick up yellow_block_2. But yellow_block_2 is already on the table from step 8. So steps 11-13 are necessary.

But perhaps we can avoid some steps. Let's see.

Wait, after step 7 (unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1), we're holding yellow_block_2. The goal is to end with this. But we need to meet the constraint first. So we have to put down yellow_block_2, do other steps to meet the constraint, then pick it up again. So steps 8 and 13 are unavoidable. Unless there's another way to meet the constraint without putting down yellow_block_2.

But the constraint requires holding grey_block_1 and having yellow_block_1 on black_block_1. So if the arm is holding yellow_block_2, it can't also hold grey_block_1. So yes, we need to put down yellow_block_2, then do other steps, then pick it up again.

So the plan seems to be of length 13. Is there any shorter way?

Another approach: maybe during the process of unstacking blocks from grey_block_1, we can stack yellow_block_1 onto black_block_1 in a way that reduces steps.

Wait, after unstacking black_block_1 from grey_block_1, and putting it down, we have black_block_1 on the table. Then, when we unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1, we can use the arm to stack yellow_block_1 onto black_block_1 instead of putting it down. But wait, when you unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1, you're holding yellow_block_2. Then you need to put it down to free the arm to pick up yellow_block_1.

Alternatively, maybe stack yellow_block_2 onto another block. But that would require another block to be clear, and it's not necessary for the goal. So perhaps not.

Alternatively, after putting down yellow_block_2, you can pick up yellow_block_1 and stack it on black_block_1, then pick up grey_block_1. Then put down grey_block_1 and pick up yellow_block_2. That's what the previous plan does.

I think this is the minimal steps required. So the plan is as outlined earlier.
