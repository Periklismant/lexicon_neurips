I need to find an optimal plan to achieve the goal of holding yellow_block_2 while ensuring that at some point I'm holding grey_block_1 with yellow_block_1 on top of black_block_1.

Let me analyze the initial state:
- yellow_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_2 on top of it, and purple_block_1 on top of yellow_block_2
- grey_block_1 is on the table with black_block_1 on top of it, and brown_block_1 on top of black_block_1
- purple_block_2 is on the table
- purple_block_1, purple_block_2, and brown_block_1 are clear
- I'm not holding any block

To achieve the goal and satisfy the constraint, I need to:
1. Dismantle the tower with purple_block_1, yellow_block_2, and yellow_block_1
2. Dismantle the tower with brown_block_1, black_block_1, and grey_block_1
3. Place yellow_block_1 on top of black_block_1
4. Pick up grey_block_1 (satisfying the constraint)
5. Eventually pick up yellow_block_2

Here's my optimal plan:

```
unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_2
putdown purple_block_1
unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
putdown yellow_block_2
unstack brown_block_1 black_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1
pickup yellow_block_1
stack yellow_block_1 black_block_1
pickup grey_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
pickup yellow_block_2
```
