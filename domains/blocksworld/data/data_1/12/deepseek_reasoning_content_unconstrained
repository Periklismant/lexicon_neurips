Okay, let's see. The goal is to have the robotic arm holding yellow_block_2. So I need to figure out the steps to get there from the initial state. Let me start by visualizing the initial setup.

From the initial state:

- yellow_block_1 is on the table. On top of it is yellow_block_2, and on top of that is purple_block_1. So the stack here is yellow_block_1 (table), yellow_block_2, purple_block_1. And purple_block_1 is clear.

Another stack: grey_block_1 is on the table, with black_block_1 on top, and then brown_block_1 on top of black_block_1. Brown_block_1 is clear.

Then there's purple_block_2 on the table, clear.

So the blocks that are on top of others and clear are purple_block_1, brown_block_1, and purple_block_2. The blocks that are under others (not clear) are yellow_block_1 (has yellow_block_2 on it), grey_block_1 (has black_block_1), black_block_1 (has brown_block_1), and yellow_block_2 (has purple_block_1).

To get yellow_block_2 into the hand, we need to unstack it from whatever is on top of it and then pick it up. Wait, yellow_block_2 is under purple_block_1. So first, we need to remove purple_block_1 from yellow_block_2. But the robotic arm is not holding anything initially.

So the steps would be:

1. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_2. Wait, can we do that? Let's check preconditions for unstack. To unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_2, purple_block_1 must be on top of yellow_block_2 (which it is), purple_block_1 must be clear (yes, it's clear), and the arm is empty (yes). So yes, we can perform unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_2. After that, the arm is holding purple_block_1, and yellow_block_2 becomes clear.

Then, after that, we need to put down purple_block_1 somewhere so that the arm is free to pick up yellow_block_2. Wait, but after unstacking, the arm is holding purple_block_1. So next, we need to put it down. Putdown purple_block_1. That would place it on the table, clear. Then, the arm is free again.

Now, yellow_block_2 is on the table? Wait no, yellow_block_2 was on top of yellow_block_1. Wait, the initial state says yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1. So yellow_block_1 is on the table, yellow_block_2 is on yellow_block_1. Then purple_block_1 is on yellow_block_2. So when we unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_2, that leaves yellow_block_2 still on yellow_block_1, but now clear. Then, to get yellow_block_2, we need to pick it up from yellow_block_1. But pickup requires that the block is on the table. Wait, yellow_block_2 is on yellow_block_1, not on the table. So we can't use pickup. So we need to unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. But to unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1, we need to check the preconditions. Is yellow_block_2 clear? After removing purple_block_1, yes. So the arm is empty after putting down purple_block_1. So yes, we can unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. Then, the arm would be holding yellow_block_2, which is the goal.

Wait, let's check the steps again:

1. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_2. Preconditions: purple_block_1 is on yellow_block_2, clear, and arm is empty. Yes. After this, arm holds purple_block_1, and yellow_block_2 is clear.

2. Putdown purple_block_1. Now, purple_block_1 is on the table, clear. Arm is empty.

3. Now, we need to get yellow_block_2. Since yellow_block_2 is on yellow_block_1, which is on the table, we can unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. Wait, unstack requires that the block is on top of another block. So yes. To unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1: check that yellow_block_2 is clear (yes, after step 1), and the arm is empty (yes, after putdown). So perform unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1. Then the arm is holding yellow_block_2, which is the goal. So that's three steps. But wait, the initial plan could be:

- unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_2

- putdown purple_block_1

- unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1

But wait, after unstacking purple_block_1, the arm is holding it. Then putdown, then unstack yellow_block_2. That would achieve the goal. So three actions. But is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, can we unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1 without first moving purple_block_1? No, because purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2, making yellow_block_2 not clear. So we must first remove purple_block_1.

So the steps are necessary. So the plan would be:

unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_2

putdown purple_block_1

unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1

Then the arm is holding yellow_block_2. That's three steps. Let's check each action's preconditions and effects.

First action: unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_2. Pre: purple_block_1 is on yellow_block_2, purple_block_1 is clear, arm is empty. Correct. After this, arm holds purple_block_1, purple_block_1 is no longer on yellow_block_2, yellow_block_2 becomes clear.

Second action: putdown purple_block_1. Pre: arm is holding it. After putdown, purple_block_1 is on table, clear, and arm is empty.

Third action: unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. Pre: yellow_block_2 is on yellow_block_1, yellow_block_2 is clear (after step 1), arm is empty. Correct. After unstack, arm holds yellow_block_2, which is the goal.

So this plan works. Now, check if there's a shorter plan. Let's see. Suppose after unstacking purple_block_1, instead of putting it down, can we stack it somewhere else to save steps? But the goal is just to hold yellow_block_2, so we don't need to care about where purple_block_1 ends up. But the steps needed are to get rid of purple_block_1 so that we can access yellow_block_2.

Wait, but after unstacking purple_block_1, the arm is holding it. Then, could we stack it on another block instead of putting it down? Let's see. Suppose we stack purple_block_1 on purple_block_2. But purple_block_2 is clear. So stack purple_block_1 purple_block_2. Preconditions: holding purple_block_1, and purple_block_2 is clear. Yes. Then after stacking, the arm is empty. Then, we can proceed to unstack yellow_block_2. So that would be:

1. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_2

2. stack purple_block_1 purple_block_2

3. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1

That's also three steps. So same length. But does that work?

After step 2, stacking purple_block_1 on purple_block_2. Then, purple_block_2 is not clear anymore, but that's okay. Then step 3: unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. So this would also work. The plan length is the same, so either plan is optimal. Which one to choose?

The problem says to provide an optimal plan, so either is acceptable. Let's see which one is better. Maybe the first plan (putdown) is better because stacking requires that the target block is clear, which it is (purple_block_2 is clear). So either approach is valid.

But the initial state says purple_block_2 is on the table and clear. So stacking there is possible. However, the problem may have constraints. But the problem's constraints for a valid plan aren't given beyond the action preconditions and effects. So both are valid. However, the problem might require the minimal number of steps. Both are three steps. So either is acceptable.

But maybe the first plan (putdown) is simpler. Let me check again.

Original plan:

1. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_2 → holding purple_block_1

2. putdown purple_block_1 → on table, arm empty

3. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1 → holding yellow_block_2 (goal)

Alternative plan:

1. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_2 → holding purple_block_1

2. stack purple_block_1 purple_block_2 → arm empty

3. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1 → holding yellow_block_2 (goal)

Both are three steps. So either is optimal. Since the problem doesn't mention any other constraints, either plan is correct. But perhaps the first is better because it's more straightforward.

Wait, but let's check if step 2 in the alternative plan is possible. Stacking purple_block_1 onto purple_block_2: preconditions are holding purple_block_1 (yes) and purple_block_2 is clear (yes, initially). So yes. So after stacking, purple_block_1 is on purple_block_2. So then, the arm is free. Then step 3 is possible.

So both are valid. The plan length is the same. So either is optimal. But maybe the problem expects the first approach. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to do it in two steps. Let me think. Is there any way?

To hold yellow_block_2, we need to unstack it from yellow_block_1. But to do that, we need to first clear it, which requires removing purple_block_1. So that's two steps: remove purple_block_1, then unstack yellow_block_2. But how to do that in two actions?

Wait, if after unstacking purple_block_1, instead of putting it down or stacking it, can we just drop it (but the only way to put it down is putdown or stack). So after unstacking purple_block_1, the arm is holding it. Then, can we proceed to unstack yellow_block_2? No, because the arm is holding purple_block_1. So we need to put it down first. So two actions: unstack and putdown, then unstack. So three actions. There's no way around that. So the minimal plan is three steps.

Therefore, the answer should be three steps. Either using putdown or stack in step 2. Both are acceptable. Let me pick the first approach.
