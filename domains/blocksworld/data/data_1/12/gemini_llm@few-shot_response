Okay, let's break this down. We need to get to a state where I'm holding yellow_block_2. Also, at some point, I need to be holding grey_block_1 while yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1.

Here's the plan:

1.  Unstack brown_block_1 from black_block_1.
2.  Putdown brown_block_1.
3.  Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_2.
4.  Putdown purple_block_1.
5.  Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1.
6.  Pickup yellow_block_2.

```
```
unstack brown_block_1 black_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_2
putdown purple_block_1
unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
pickup yellow_block_2
```
