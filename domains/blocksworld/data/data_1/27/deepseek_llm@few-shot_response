Let's break down the problem step by step to find an optimal plan that satisfies the given constraints.

### Initial State:
- On table: yellow_block_1, black_block_1, grey_block_1, yellow_block_2, blue_block_1
- grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1
- white_block_1 is on yellow_block_1
- Clear blocks: black_block_1, grey_block_2, white_block_1, yellow_block_2, blue_block_1
- Not holding any block

### Goal:
- blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2

### Constraints:
- At some point in the plan, the following must hold:
  - You are holding grey_block_1
  - blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1

### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. First, we need to satisfy the constraint. To do this, we must:
   - Place blue_block_1 on black_block_1.
   - Pick up grey_block_1.

2. To place blue_block_1 on black_block_1:
   - Pick up blue_block_1 (since it's clear and on the table).
   - Stack blue_block_1 on black_block_1 (since black_block_1 is clear).

3. Now, to pick up grey_block_1:
   - grey_block_1 is under grey_block_2, so we must first unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1.
   - Then, we can pick up grey_block_1.

4. After satisfying the constraint, we need to achieve the goal:
   - Put down grey_block_1 (to free the hand).
   - Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1.
   - Stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_2 (goal).

### Optimal Plan:
```
```
pickup blue_block_1
stack blue_block_1 black_block_1
unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
putdown grey_block_2
pickup grey_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2
```
```

### Explanation:
1. `pickup blue_block_1`: Pick up blue_block_1 from the table.
2. `stack blue_block_1 black_block_1`: Place blue_block_1 on black_block_1 (satisfies part of the constraint).
3. `unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1`: Pick up grey_block_2 from grey_block_1 to make grey_block_1 clear.
4. `putdown grey_block_2`: Place grey_block_2 on the table.
5. `pickup grey_block_1`: Pick up grey_block_1 (now satisfies the full constraint).
6. `putdown grey_block_1`: Place grey_block_1 back on the table to free the hand.
7. `unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1`: Pick up blue_block_1 from black_block_1.
8. `stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2`: Place blue_block_1 on yellow_block_2 (goal achieved).

This plan is optimal (8 steps) and satisfies all constraints.
