First, let's break down the problem. We need to get blue_block_1 on top of yellow_block_2. We also have a constraint that at some point, we must be holding grey_block_1 while blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1.

Here's a plan to achieve this:

1.  Clear the table for stacking blue_block_1 on black_block_1 and to hold grey_block_1.
2.  Satisfy the constraint by stacking blue_block_1 on black_block_1 while holding grey_block_1.
3.  Clear yellow_block_2 to put blue_block_1 on top of it.
4.  Stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_2.

```
```
unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1
putdown white_block_1
unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
pickup grey_block_1
pickup blue_block_1
stack blue_block_1 black_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
pickup blue_block_1
stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2
```
