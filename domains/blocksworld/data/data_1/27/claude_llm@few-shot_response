I'll solve this planning problem step by step.

First, let me analyze the initial state and goal:
- Initial state: Several blocks on the table, with grey_block_2 on grey_block_1 and white_block_1 on yellow_block_1
- Goal: blue_block_1 on top of yellow_block_2
- Constraint: At some point, I must be holding grey_block_1 while blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1

To satisfy the constraint, I need to:
1. Stack blue_block_1 on black_block_1
2. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1
3. Pick up grey_block_1

Then I can complete the goal by:
4. Put down grey_block_1
5. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1
6. Stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_2

Here's the optimal plan:

```
pickup blue_block_1
stack blue_block_1 black_block_1
unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
putdown grey_block_2
pickup grey_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2
```
```
