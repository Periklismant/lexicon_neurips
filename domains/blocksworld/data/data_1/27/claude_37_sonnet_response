Let's analyze this problem step by step.

Initial state:
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1
- white_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is clear
- grey_block_2 is clear
- white_block_1 is clear
- yellow_block_2 is clear
- blue_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Goal state:
- blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2

Constraint:
- At some point, both of these must be true simultaneously:
  - you are holding grey_block_1
  - blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1

To achieve the goal, we need to place blue_block_1 on top of yellow_block_2. This can be done with the following actions:
1. pickup blue_block_1
2. stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2

However, we also need to satisfy the constraint that at some point:
- We are holding grey_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1

Let's think about how to satisfy this constraint. We need to:
1. Put blue_block_1 on top of black_block_1
2. Then unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1
3. Then pickup grey_block_1 while blue_block_1 is still on black_block_1

So our plan could be:
1. pickup blue_block_1
2. stack blue_block_1 black_block_1
3. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
4. putdown grey_block_2
5. pickup grey_block_1 (at this point, we satisfy the constraint)
6. putdown grey_block_1
7. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
8. stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2

However, there might be a more efficient way. Let me re-approach this.

Actually, I think the plan I outlined is already fairly efficient. The constraint forces us to have a state where blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, and we are holding grey_block_1. This means we need to move blue_block_1 at least once (to place it on black_block_1), and we need to free up grey_block_1 and pick it up. Then, to achieve the goal, we need to move blue_block_1 again to place it on yellow_block_2.

Given these constraints, it seems like 8 actions is the minimum number required.

Let me double-check the initial state:
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1

So grey_block_1 is not clear. We need to unstack grey_block_2 first.

Let me revise the plan:
1. pickup blue_block_1
2. stack blue_block_1 black_block_1
3. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
4. putdown grey_block_2
5. pickup grey_block_1 (at this point, we satisfy the constraint)
6. putdown grey_block_1
7. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
8. stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2

Let me verify that this plan is valid:

Initial state:
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1
- white_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is clear
- grey_block_2 is clear
- white_block_1 is clear
- yellow_block_2 is clear
- blue_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

After "pickup blue_block_1":
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1
- white_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is on the table
- black_block_1 is clear
- grey_block_2 is clear
- white_block_1 is clear
- yellow_block_2 is clear
- you are holding blue_block_1

After "stack blue_block_1 black_block_1":
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1
- white_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- grey_block_2 is clear
- white_block_1 is clear
- yellow_block_2 is clear
- blue_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

After "unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1":
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- grey_block_1 is clear
- white_block_1 is clear
- yellow_block_2 is clear
- blue_block_1 is clear
- you are holding grey_block_2

After "putdown grey_block_2":
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- grey_block_1 is clear
- grey_block_2 is clear
- white_block_1 is clear
- yellow_block_2 is clear
- blue_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

After "pickup grey_block_1":
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- grey_block_2 is clear
- white_block_1 is clear
- yellow_block_2 is clear
- blue_block_1 is clear
- you are holding grey_block_1

At this point, the constraint is satisfied: you are holding grey_block_1 and blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1.

After "putdown grey_block_1":
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- grey_block_1 is clear
- grey_block_2 is clear
- white_block_1 is clear
- yellow_block_2 is clear
- blue_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

After "unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1":
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is on the table
- black_block_1 is clear
- grey_block_1 is clear
- grey_block_2 is clear
- white_block_1 is clear
- yellow_block_2 is clear
- you are holding blue_block_1

After "stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2":
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2
- black_block_1 is clear
- grey_block_1 is clear
- grey_block_2 is clear
- white_block_1 is clear
- blue_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Goal achieved: blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2.

So, our plan is:
1. pickup blue_block_1
2. stack blue_block_1 black_block_1
3. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
4. putdown grey_block_2
5. pickup grey_block_1 (at this point, we satisfy the constraint)
6. putdown grey_block_1
7. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
8. stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2

Actually, let me confirm that this is indeed optimal. The constraint forces certain moves:
- We need to place blue_block_1 on black_block_1.
- We need to free up grey_block_1 and pick it up.
- We need to place blue_block_1 on yellow_block_2.

Given these constraints, it seems like 8 actions is the minimum number required. However, let me consider if there's a more direct route.

Could we pick up grey_block_1 first? No, because grey_block_2 is on top of it.

Alright, let's try another approach:
1. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
2. putdown grey_block_2
3. pickup blue_block_1
4. stack blue_block_1 black_block_1
5. pickup grey_block_1 (at this point, we satisfy the constraint)
6. putdown grey_block_1
7. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
8. stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2

Actually, this is still 8 actions. I don't think we can do better.

Hmm, what if we don't do step 6? We could do:
1. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
2. putdown grey_block_2
3. pickup blue_block_1
4. stack blue_block_1 black_block_1
5. pickup grey_block_1 (at this point, we satisfy the constraint)
6. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1 (but wait, we can't do this because we're holding grey_block_1)

So we definitely need to put down grey_block_1 first.

Ok, let me try again:
1. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
2. putdown grey_block_2
3. pickup blue_block_1
4. stack blue_block_1 black_block_1
5. pickup grey_block_1 (at this point, we satisfy the constraint)
6. putdown grey_block_1
7. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
8. stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2

This is still 8 actions. But actually, I'm making a mistake in thinking about optimality. The task is to provide an optimal plan, and the definition of optimality is clear from the problem statement: it's a valid plan whose length is equal or less than the length of any other valid plan.

So, is 8 actions the minimum required? I think so.

Let's take another approach. What's the minimum number of steps to satisfy the constraint?
1. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
2. putdown grey_block_2
3. pickup blue_block_1
4. stack blue_block_1 black_block_1
5. pickup grey_block_1

That's 5 steps. Now, what's the minimum number of steps to then achieve the goal?
1. putdown grey_block_1
2. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
3. stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2

That's 3 more steps, for a total of 8.

So, the best possible plan would be 8 steps long, and the plan I've sketched is 8 steps long. So it's optimal.

Actually, wait, can we do something smarter to avoid all the swapping? Let me restate our constraint and goal:
- Constraint: At some point, we need to be holding grey_block_1 while blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1.
- Goal: Place blue_block_1 on top of yellow_block_2.

Since the constraint requires us to move blue_block_1 onto black_block_1, and the goal requires us to move blue_block_1 onto yellow_block_2, we definitely need to move blue_block_1 twice. However, is it necessary to put down grey_block_1 after picking it up?

Actually, maybe we can do:

1. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
2. putdown grey_block_2
3. pickup blue_block_1
4. stack blue_block_1 black_block_1
5. pickup grey_block_1 (at this point, we satisfy the constraint)
6. putdown grey_block_1 (we need to put it down to free the arm)
7. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
8. stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2

Well, we are back to the same plan. I think this is optimal.

To conclude, the 8-step plan is:
1. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
2. putdown grey_block_2
3. pickup blue_block_1
4. stack blue_block_1 black_block_1
5. pickup grey_block_1 (at this point, we satisfy the constraint)
6. putdown grey_block_1
7. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
8. stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2
