Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. First, I need to understand the initial state and the goal. The goal is to have blue_block_1 on top of yellow_block_2. The constraints require that at some point in the plan, the robot is holding grey_block_1 and blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1.

Let me start by looking at the initial state. The blocks are arranged as follows:

- yellow_block_1 is on the table with white_block_1 on top (and white_block_1 is clear).
- grey_block_1 is on the table with grey_block_2 on top (grey_block_2 is clear).
- black_block_1, yellow_block_2, and blue_block_1 are on the table and clear.

So, blue_block_1 is initially clear on the table. To get it onto yellow_block_2, I need to pick up blue_block_1 and stack it on yellow_block_2. But wait, the constraints say that in some state, blue_block_1 must be on black_block_1 and the robot is holding grey_block_1. So the plan must include steps where blue_block_1 is temporarily placed on black_block_1 and then moved again.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Move blue_block_1 to black_block_1 to satisfy the constraint.
2. While doing that, at some point, the robot must hold grey_block_1. So maybe after moving blue_block_1 to black_block_1, we need to unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1, which would require picking up grey_block_2 (but that's not grey_block_1). Wait, grey_block_1 is under grey_block_2. So to hold grey_block_1, the robot would have to first remove grey_block_2 from it. Let's think:

Initial state: grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1. Both are on the table. So to get grey_block_1, you have to unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1. But grey_block_2 is clear, so unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1. Then put it down, then pick up grey_block_1. But that might not be necessary if the constraint is just that in some state, the robot is holding grey_block_1 and blue_block_1 is on black_block_1. So maybe after putting blue_block_1 on black_block_1, then the robot can unstack grey_block_2, put it down, then pick up grey_block_1. But how does that fit into the overall plan?

Wait, the constraint is that in at least one state, both conditions are true: holding grey_block_1 and blue_block_1 is on black_block_1. So at that exact moment, both must hold. So blue_block_1 must already be on black_block_1, and the robot is holding grey_block_1. So the steps could be:

- Stack blue_block_1 onto black_block_1. Then, to hold grey_block_1, we need to unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1, then put it down, then pick up grey_block_1. But when we pick up grey_block_1, blue_block_1 must still be on black_block_1. But after stacking blue_block_1 on black_block_1, to pick up grey_block_1, we need to make sure that grey_block_1 is clear. Initially, grey_block_1 has grey_block_2 on top. So we need to unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1 first. Then put grey_block_2 down. Then pick up grey_block_1. But during that time, blue_block_1 is on black_block_1. So the state where the robot is holding grey_block_1 and blue_block_1 is on black_block_1 occurs after the pickup of grey_block_1. Then, after that, the robot can putdown grey_block_1 and proceed to move blue_block_1 from black_block_1 to yellow_block_2.

So let's outline the steps:

1. Pickup blue_block_1 (since it's on the table and clear).
2. Stack blue_block_1 onto black_block_1 (since black_block_1 is clear). Now blue is on black.
3. Now, need to get to holding grey_block_1. So first, unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1. Since grey_block_2 is clear, we can unstack it. So unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1. Now the robot is holding grey_block_2. Then put it down (putdown grey_block_2). Now grey_block_1 is clear. Then pickup grey_block_1. Now the robot is holding grey_block_1, and blue_block_1 is on black_block_1. This satisfies the constraint. Then, putdown grey_block_1. Now, proceed to move blue_block_1 from black_block_1 to yellow_block_2. To do that, we need to unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1. But wait, blue_block_1 is on black_block_1. So unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1. Then stack it on yellow_block_2. But yellow_block_2 must be clear. Initially, it is. But after we put down grey_block_1, is there any block on yellow_block_2? Let me check the initial state. Initially, yellow_block_2 is on the table and clear. But after the steps above, when we putdown grey_block_1, that's on the table, so yellow_block_2 remains clear. So steps after the constraint:

4. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1 (since after step 2, blue is on black, and after step 3, we putdown grey_block_1, so black_block_1 has blue on it. To unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1, the robot needs to be empty. So after step 3, after putting down grey_block_1, the robot is empty. So then unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1. Now holding blue_block_1. Then stack it on yellow_block_2. Done.

So the steps would be:

1. pickup blue_block_1
2. stack blue_block_1 black_block_1
3. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
4. putdown grey_block_2
5. pickup grey_block_1
6. putdown grey_block_1
7. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
8. stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2

But wait, after step 5, the robot is holding grey_block_1, and blue_block_1 is on black_block_1. So that's the state where the constraint is satisfied. Then steps 6-8 are to achieve the final goal.

But is this the optimal plan? Let's check the number of steps. Are there any redundant steps?

Alternative approach: Maybe after stacking blue on black (step 2), then unstack grey_block_2 (step3), then instead of putting it down, stack it somewhere else? But that's not needed. But in the current plan, after unstacking grey_block_2, we put it down, then pick up grey_block_1. That's necessary because to pick up grey_block_1, it must be clear, which it becomes after removing grey_block_2. So steps 3-5 are necessary to satisfy the constraint.

Is there a shorter way? Let's think. Suppose after step 2 (blue on black), we unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1, then instead of putting it down, we could use it in some way. But to pick up grey_block_1, we need to have grey_block_2 off of it, so step3 and step4 (putdown grey_block_2) are needed. Then step5 (pickup grey_block_1). Then putdown (step6) to free the hand. Then steps7-8.

So that's 8 steps. Can we do it in fewer steps? Let's see. For example, after step5 (holding grey_block_1), instead of putting it down, maybe use it somewhere else. But the final goal doesn't involve grey_block_1. So putting it down is necessary to free the hand to unstack blue_block_1. So steps are necessary.

Alternatively, could we avoid putting down grey_block_1? Let's see. After step5, we have to putdown grey_block_1 to then unstack blue_block_1. Because to unstack blue, the robot must be empty. So yes, step6 is needed.

So total steps: 8.

Is there a way to combine some steps? Let's see. For example, after step3 (unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1), instead of putting it down, maybe stack it somewhere else. But that would require having a clear block to stack on, but where? If we stack it on another block that's clear, like yellow_block_2. But that would interfere with the final goal of putting blue_block_1 there. So we can't do that. So putting it down is better. So the plan as outlined seems necessary.

Another check: When we unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1 (step7), that's possible because after step2, blue is on black, and after step6, black_block_1 is clear (since blue was on it, but after step7, we unstack it). Wait, after step2, blue is on black. Then in step3, we unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1, which doesn't affect black_block_1. So in step7, black_block_1 has blue on it, which is clear (since nothing is on top of blue_block_1). Wait, after stacking blue on black_block_1 (step2), blue is on top of black, so black is not clear anymore. But blue_block_1 is clear. So in step7, to unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1, the preconditions are: blue is on black, blue is clear, and the robot is empty. Yes. Because after step6, the robot is empty.

So the plan is valid. Now, let's check if all preconditions are met in each step.

Step1: pickup blue_block_1. Preconditions: blue is on table, clear, and robot is empty. Yes.

Step2: stack blue_block_1 black_block_1. Preconditions: holding blue, black_block_1 is clear. After step1, robot is holding blue. Black_block_1 is initially clear. So yes.

Step3: unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1. Preconditions: grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1, grey_block_2 is clear, robot is empty. After step2, robot is empty. Initially, grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1 and clear. So yes.

Step4: putdown grey_block_2. Preconditions: holding grey_block_2. Yes, after step3.

Step5: pickup grey_block_1. Preconditions: grey_block_1 is on table, clear (since grey_block_2 was removed), robot is empty. After step4, robot is empty. Grey_block_1 is on table and clear now. Yes.

Step6: putdown grey_block_1. Preconditions: holding it. Yes.

Step7: unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1. Preconditions: blue is on black, blue is clear (after stacking, nothing is on top of blue), robot is empty. Yes, after step6.

Step8: stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2. Preconditions: holding blue, yellow_block_2 is clear. After step7, robot holds blue. Yellow_block_2 is still clear. Yes.

So all steps are valid. The constraint is satisfied in step5, where the robot is holding grey_block_1 and blue is on black_block_1. So that's covered.

Is there a shorter plan? Let's think. Suppose instead of moving grey_block_1, can we find another way to meet the constraint? The constraint requires that at some state, the robot is holding grey_block_1 and blue is on black. So perhaps during the process of moving blue to black and then to yellow, can we arrange the steps so that while moving grey_block_1, we meet the constraint?

Wait, another approach: Maybe after stacking blue on black, then immediately unstack grey_block_2, put it down, then pickup grey_block_1 (steps3-5). Then, instead of putting down grey_block_1, use it to do something else. But the final goal doesn't involve grey_block_1. So putting it down is necessary to free the hand. So no, the steps are necessary.

Alternatively, can we combine steps? For example, after step5 (holding grey_block_1), could we stack it somewhere to avoid putdown? But that's not needed. So no.

So the plan seems optimal with 8 steps. I don't see a shorter way.
