Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld problem. The goal is to make sure that white_block_1 is clear, and there's a constraint that at some point, the robotic arm must be holding green_block_2. Let's start by understanding the initial state and the desired goal.

In the initial state:
- blue_block_1 is on the table with red_block_1 on top of it. Red_block_1 is clear.
- green_block_1 is on the table with blue_block_2, then white_block_1, then purple_block_1 stacked on top. Purple_block_1 is clear.
- green_block_2 is on the table and clear.
- The arm is empty.

The goal is for white_block_1 to be clear. Currently, white_block_1 is under purple_block_1, so purple_block_1 is on top of it. To make white_block_1 clear, we need to remove purple_block_1 from on top of it.

Additionally, we must ensure that at some point, the arm is holding green_block_2. So, our plan has to include picking up green_block_2 at least once, even if we put it back down right away.

First, let's focus on clearing white_block_1. The stack on green_block_1 is green_block_1 (on table) -> blue_block_2 -> white_block_1 -> purple_block_1. To clear white_block_1, we need to move purple_block_1 somewhere else. Since purple_block_1 is clear, we can unstack it from white_block_1. But to do that, we need to unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1. However, the unstack action requires that the block being unstacked (purple_block_1) is on top of another block (white_block_1), and that the arm is empty. So the steps here would be:

1. Unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1. This requires that purple_block_1 is clear (which it is) and that the arm is empty (which it is). After unstacking, the arm is holding purple_block_1, white_block_1 becomes clear (which is our goal), and purple_block_1 is no longer on white_block_1.

But the problem is that after doing this, we need to put purple_block_1 somewhere. Let's say we put it on the table. So then:

2. Putdown purple_block_1. Now, purple_block_1 is on the table, clear, and the arm is empty. This achieves the goal of white_block_1 being clear. However, we also need to satisfy the constraint that at some point, the arm is holding green_block_2.

So we need to incorporate picking up green_block_2 into the plan. Since green_block_2 is initially on the table and clear, we can pick it up. But the constraint just needs it to be held at least once. So maybe after moving purple_block_1, we can pick up green_block_2 and then put it back down. But how to fit that into the optimal plan.

Wait, the optimal plan should be the shortest possible. So perhaps the steps would be:

1. Unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1 (arm now holds purple_block_1, white_block_1 is clear).
2. Putdown purple_block_1 (this completes the goal, but we haven't met the constraint yet).
3. So, we need to pick up green_block_2. Since after step 2, the arm is empty, and green_block_2 is on the table and clear, we can do:
3. Pickup green_block_2 (arm holds it, satisfying the constraint).
4. Then put it down again: Putdown green_block_2.

But steps 3 and 4 are extra steps. However, the problem says the plan must be optimal (as short as possible). So maybe there's a way to combine steps to meet the constraint without adding extra steps.

Alternatively, after unstacking purple_block_1, instead of putting it down, maybe we can stack it onto green_block_2. But green_block_2 is clear, so stacking purple_block_1 on green_block_2 would require that we're holding purple_block_1 (which we are after unstacking) and that green_block_2 is clear (which it is). So:

1. Unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1.
2. Stack purple_block_1 onto green_block_2. This would make green_block_2 no longer clear, and purple_block_1 is on top. But then we need to pick up green_block_2 later? Wait, no. To hold green_block_2, we need to unstack it from whatever is on top of it. But if purple_block_1 is on green_block_2, then we can't pick up green_block_2 unless we first remove purple_block_1. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe after stacking purple_block_1 on green_block_2, the arm is empty. Then we can pickup green_block_2. Wait, no, because green_block_2 is under purple_block_1 now. To pick up green_block_2, it has to be clear, but if purple_block_1 is on it, then it's not clear. So this approach might not work.

Alternative idea: After unstacking purple_block_1, instead of putting it down, we could use the arm to hold green_block_2. But how? The arm is holding purple_block_1 after step 1. So we need to put down purple_block_1 first, then pick up green_block_2.

So maybe:

1. Unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1. (arm holds purple_block_1, white_block_1 is clear)
2. Putdown purple_block_1. (purple is on table, arm empty)
3. Pickup green_block_2. (arm holds green_block_2, satisfying constraint)
4. Putdown green_block_2. (back to initial state for green_block_2)

But this adds steps 3 and 4. However, the goal is already achieved after step 2. But the constraint requires that in at least one state, the arm is holding green_block_2. So steps 3 and 4 are necessary. However, this makes the plan length 4. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, is there a way to combine moving purple_block_1 and using green_block_2 in a way that requires holding green_block_2 as part of the process?

Alternatively, after unstacking purple_block_1, can we stack it onto green_block_2, which would require holding purple_block_1, and then unstacking green_block_2 from somewhere else. Wait, but green_block_2 is on the table. So perhaps:

1. Unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1. (arm holds purple)
2. Stack purple_block_1 onto green_block_2. (purple is on green_block_2, arm empty)
3. Now, to hold green_block_2, we need to unstack purple_block_1 from green_block_2. But that would require the arm to be empty, which it is after step 2. So step 3: Unstack purple_block_1 from green_block_2. Now, arm holds purple again.
4. Putdown purple_block_1. (back to table)
But this way, we have steps 1-4, but the constraint is not met yet. We need to hold green_block_2. Alternatively, after stacking purple on green_block_2, maybe we can pick up green_block_2. But green_block_2 is under purple_block_1, so it's not clear. So we can't pick it up. Therefore, that approach won't work.

Another approach: Maybe after step 1 (unstack purple), instead of putting it down, we can put it on another block that is clear. For example, red_block_1 is clear. So:

1. Unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1.
2. Stack purple_block_1 onto red_block_1. Now, red_block_1 is under purple, which is clear. Then, the arm is empty. Then, we can pick up green_block_2.

But after stacking purple onto red, red is no longer clear. So if we need to pick up green_block_2, which is on the table and clear, we can do:

3. Pickup green_block_2 (arm holds it, constraint satisfied)
4. Putdown green_block_2.

But this way, the plan would have 4 steps. However, after step 2, white_block_1 is clear, which is the goal. So steps 3 and 4 are only to satisfy the constraint. But is there a way to do it in fewer steps?

Wait, what if after step 1 (unstack purple), we put it on green_block_2. Then, step 2: stack purple_block_1 on green_block_2. Then, step 3: unstack purple_block_1 from green_block_2. But that would require steps 1,2,3, and then we need to put down purple again. That's more steps. Not better.

Alternatively, after unstacking purple (step 1), we need to hold green_block_2. But the arm is holding purple, so we have to put it down first. So step 2: putdown purple. Step 3: pickup green_block_2. Step 4: putdown green_block_2. So total 4 steps. But is there a way to have the constraint met during the process of moving purple?

Wait, the constraint says that in at least one state, the arm is holding green_block_2. So even if we just pick it up and put it down immediately, that's sufficient. But how to integrate that into the minimal steps.

The minimal steps to achieve the goal are:

1. Unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1. (arm holds purple)
2. Putdown purple_block_1. (arm empty, white_block_1 is clear)

That's two steps. But this doesn't satisfy the constraint. So we need to add steps where the arm holds green_block_2. So perhaps:

1. Unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1.
2. Putdown purple_block_1.
3. Pickup green_block_2.
4. Putdown green_block_2.

This is four steps, but the goal is achieved after step 2. Steps 3 and 4 are just to satisfy the constraint. However, this is a valid plan but maybe there's a way to do it in three steps by combining steps.

Wait, what if after unstacking purple (step 1), instead of putting it down, we stack it onto green_block_2. Then:

1. Unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1. (arm holds purple)
2. Stack purple_block_1 on green_block_2. (arm empty, green_block_2 now has purple on top, which makes it not clear. But the constraint is that the arm holds green_block_2. To do that, we need to unstack purple from green_block_2. But that would be:

3. Unstack purple_block_1 from green_block_2. (arm holds purple)
4. Putdown purple_block_1. (arm empty)

But in this case, after step 2, the green_block_2 is under purple. So to hold green_block_2, we have to first remove purple. So steps 3 and 4 are needed. Then:

5. Pickup green_block_2. (arm holds it, constraint satisfied)
6. Putdown green_block_2.

This is six steps, which is worse than the previous approach. So that's not optimal.

Alternative idea: Can we do the constraint action (picking up green_block_2) before dealing with purple_block_1? Let's see:

Initial state: green_block_2 is on the table and clear. So we can pick it up.

1. Pickup green_block_2. (arm holds it)
2. Putdown green_block_2. (back to initial state)
3. Unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1.
4. Putdown purple_block_1.

Now, this is four steps. But steps 1 and 2 are just for the constraint. The goal is achieved in steps 3 and 4. This is four steps, same as the earlier approach.

But perhaps there's a way to do it in three steps. Let's think.

What if after unstacking purple (step 1), we need to hold green_block_2. But the arm is holding purple, so we can't. So we have to put down purple first (step 2), then pick up green (step 3), then put it down (step 4). But that's four steps.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the putdown action for purple in a way that allows us to pick up green_block_2 in the same steps. Not sure.

Wait, another angle: The goal is to have white_block_1 clear. The current state has purple on white. So the minimal steps to achieve the goal are two: unstack and putdown. But we need to include holding green_block_2. So the minimal plan would be two steps for the goal plus two steps for the constraint, totaling four. But maybe there's a way to have overlapping steps.

Wait, what if after unstacking purple, we put it on green_block_2. Then, we have to pick up green_block_2. But green_block_2 is under purple, so we can't. So that doesn't help.

Alternatively, after unstacking purple, we can stack it on green_block_2. Then, to hold green_block_2, we need to unstack purple first. So:

1. Unstack purple from white. (arm holds purple)
2. Stack purple on green_block_2. (arm empty)
3. Unstack purple from green_block_2. (arm holds purple)
4. Putdown purple. (arm empty)
5. Pickup green_block_2. (arm holds it)
6. Putdown green_block_2.

This is six steps, which is worse. So that's not optimal.

Another idea: What if we use the green_block_2 as part of the solution. For example, after moving purple, put it on green_block_2, but then pick up green_block_2. But again, that's not possible because it's under purple.

Alternatively, during the process of moving purple, we can hold green_block_2. But that would require the arm to be free. For instance:

1. Unstack purple from white. (arm holds purple)
2. Stack purple on green_block_2. (arm empty)
3. Pickup green_block_2. (can't, because green_block_2 is under purple now. So not possible.)

So that's not feasible.

Back to the initial approach: The minimal steps to achieve the goal are two (unstack and putdown). To satisfy the constraint, we need two more steps (pickup and putdown green_block_2). Total four steps.

But is there a way to satisfy the constraint during the process of solving the goal? For example, perhaps moving green_block_2 as part of the process. But the goal only requires white_block_1 to be clear. So moving green_block_2 isn't necessary for the goal. But the constraint requires that at some state, the arm holds green_block_2.

Wait, another possibility: After unstacking purple (step 1), we need to put it down. But instead of putting it on the table, can we stack it on green_block_2? Then, during that stacking action, the arm is holding purple, so no. But after stacking, the arm is empty, and green_block_2 has purple on it. So to hold green_block_2, we need to unstack purple first. Which would require unstacking (step 3), then pickup green (step 4). Then putdown green (step 5). So that's five steps. Worse than four.

Alternatively, after unstacking purple (step 1), put it on the table (step 2). Then pickup green (step 3), putdown (step 4). Total four steps. That's the same as before.

So the shortest possible plan seems to be four steps. Let's verify:

1. unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1. (arm holds purple)
2. putdown purple_block_1. (arm empty, white_block_1 is clear, goal achieved)
3. pickup green_block_2. (arm holds green, constraint satisfied)
4. putdown green_block_2. (arm empty)

This plan achieves the goal in step 2 and satisfies the constraint in step 3. However, the problem states that the plan must be optimal, i.e., no longer than any other valid plan. But maybe there's a way to do it in three steps. Wait, can we combine steps? For example, after unstacking purple, instead of putting it down, stack it on green_block_2. Then, the steps would be:

1. unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1.
2. stack purple_block_1 on green_block_2.
3. pickup green_block_2. (But green_block_2 now has purple on top, so it's not clear. So we can't pickup green_block_2.)

No, that doesn't work. So step 3 would be impossible.

Alternatively, after step 1 (unstack purple), we can stack it onto green_block_2 (step 2). Then, the arm is empty, but green_block_2 now has purple on it. Then, to hold green_block_2, we need to unstack purple first. So:

3. unstack purple_block_1 from green_block_2.
4. putdown purple_block_1.
5. pickup green_block_2.
6. putdown green_block_2.

That's six steps. Not better.

So the initial four-step plan seems to be the minimal. Let's check if there's any other way. What if the constraint is satisfied during the process of moving purple? For example, after unstacking purple (step 1), we put it on the table (step 2). Then, we need to pick up green (step 3), but then step 3 is needed. So total four steps.

Alternatively, maybe after step 1, before putting down purple, we can do something else. But the arm is holding purple, so we can't pick up green_block_2 until we put down purple. So after step 1, we must put down purple (step 2), then pickup green (step 3), putdown (step 4).

Yes, that's four steps. I think this is the optimal plan.
