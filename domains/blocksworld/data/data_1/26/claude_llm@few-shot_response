I need to find an optimal plan to make white_block_1 clear while ensuring that at some point I hold green_block_2.

Looking at the initial state:
- white_block_1 has purple_block_1 on top of it
- green_block_2 is on the table and clear

To make white_block_1 clear, I need to remove purple_block_1 from it. And to satisfy the constraint, I need to pick up green_block_2 at some point.

Let me plan the sequence of actions:

```
pickup green_block_2
putdown green_block_2
unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1
putdown purple_block_1
```

This plan:
1. Picks up green_block_2 (satisfying the constraint)
2. Puts it back down
3. Unstacks purple_block_1 from white_block_1
4. Puts purple_block_1 on the table

After these actions, white_block_1 will be clear, and I will have held green_block_2 during the plan.
