Let me first understand the problem:

Initial state:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- green_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
- white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2
- purple_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- green_block_2 is on the table
- red_block_1 is clear
- purple_block_1 is clear
- green_block_2 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Goal state:
- white_block_1 is clear

Additional constraint:
- At some point, you must be holding green_block_2

So the current configuration is:
```
        purple_block_1    red_block_1    green_block_2 
             |               |
        white_block_1        |
             |               |
        blue_block_2         |
             |               |
        green_block_1    blue_block_1
           table            table          table
```

Here, white_block_1 is not clear because purple_block_1 is on top of it. To make white_block_1 clear, we need to remove purple_block_1 from the top of white_block_1.

Also, at some point, we must be holding green_block_2. So we'll need to pickup green_block_2 at some point, and then do something with it.

Let's think about how to approach this. The simplest solution would be:
1. Unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1
2. Move purple_block_1 somewhere (either to the table or to another block)
3. Pickup green_block_2 (to satisfy the constraint)
4. Putdown green_block_2 or stack it on some other block

Let's go through the plan step by step:

Step 1: Unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1
Action: "unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1"
Preconditions:
- purple_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 (true)
- purple_block_1 is clear (true)
- you are not holding any block (true)
Effects:
- purple_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1
- white_block_1 is clear
- you are holding purple_block_1

Step 2: Put purple_block_1 on the table
Action: "putdown purple_block_1"
Preconditions:
- you are holding purple_block_1 (true after Step 1)
Effects:
- purple_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Step 3: Pickup green_block_2
Action: "pickup green_block_2"
Preconditions:
- green_block_2 is clear (true)
- green_block_2 is on the table (true)
- you are not holding any block (true after Step 2)
Effects:
- you are holding green_block_2
- green_block_2 is not on the table

Step 4: Put green_block_2 back on the table
Action: "putdown green_block_2"
Preconditions:
- you are holding green_block_2 (true after Step 3)
Effects:
- green_block_2 is on the table
- green_block_2 is clear
- you are not holding any block

So, the plan is:
```
unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1
putdown purple_block_1
pickup green_block_2
putdown green_block_2
```

Actually, have I achieved the goal? Let's check:
- white_block_1 is clear - yes, after removing purple_block_1 from it.

Have I satisfied the constraint?
- At some point, I was holding green_block_2 - yes, after step 3.

So this plan achieves the goal and satisfies the constraint.

But I notice that after the first action "unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1", we already have the goal satisfied: "white_block_1 is clear". So the rest of the actions might be unnecessary for achieving the goal. However, we need to satisfy the constraint that at some point, we are holding green_block_2. So we still need to perform steps 3 and 4.

But maybe we can optimize? Can we potentially take fewer actions while still achieving the goal and satisfying the constraint?

Actually, there's another approach:
1. Unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1
2. Stack purple_block_1 on green_block_2 (instead of putting it down)
3. Unstack purple_block_1 from green_block_2
4. Putdown purple_block_1

But that's more steps than our original plan. So the first plan seems better. However, I now notice that after Step 1, we could immediately stack purple_block_1 on another clear block (green_block_2 or red_block_1), which would save us one action:

1. Unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1
2. Stack purple_block_1 on green_block_2
3. Pickup green_block_2 (this won't work because green_block_2 is not clear after step 2)

OK the above won't work because after stacking purple_block_1 on green_block_2, green_block_2 is no longer clear, so we can't pick it up.

Are there other optimizations? The task is to bring about the following situation: "there is no block on top of white_block_1, i.e., white_block_1 is clear" and the constraint is "The following expression must hold in at least one state: you are holding green_block_2".

So, the goal is to make white_block_1 clear, and at some point in our plan, we must be holding green_block_2.

Actually, I realize that our goal is achieved after the very first action (white_block_1 is clear), but we still need to satisfy the constraint. So we could do just:

1. Unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1
2. Putdown purple_block_1 (or stack it somewhere, like on green_block_2)
3. Pickup green_block_2
4. Putdown green_block_2

This is our original plan, and it seems to be the most efficient way to achieve the goal and satisfy the constraint.

Actually, let me think about whether we need step 2. After step 1, we are holding purple_block_1, and our goal (white_block_1 is clear) is achieved. But to satisfy the constraint, we need to be holding green_block_2 at some point, and for that, we need to not be holding any block first, so we need to do something with purple_block_1. And since we're asked for the optimal solution, we should pick one that minimizes the number of steps. So steps 2, 3, and 4 are indeed necessary to satisfy the constraint in the most efficient way.

Actually, let's see if I need step 4. The goal is for white_block_1 to be clear, and the constraint is that we must, at some point, be holding green_block_2. After step 3, white_block_1 is clear, and we're holding green_block_2, so both the goal and the constraint are satisfied. Is there a reason to then putdown green_block_2? Well, if the goal is for white_block_1 to be clear at the end of the plan (which is the standard interpretation of a planning goal), then we would want to ensure that the goal is still satisfied at the end of the plan. But if all we're concerned about is that white_block_1 is clear at some point in the plan, and the constraint is satisfied at some point in the plan, then we could end after step 3.

Let me check the goal statement again: "The task is to bring about the following situation: 'there is no block on top of white_block_1, i.e., white_block_1 is clear'". This suggests to me that we want white_block_1 to be clear at the end of the plan. And since we've already established that the constraint needs to be satisfied at some point in the plan, we should probably putdown green_block_2 to finish the plan with white_block_1 being clear.

OK let's make sure our plan is correct:

Step 1: Unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1
Action: "unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1"
Preconditions:
- purple_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 (true)
- purple_block_1 is clear (true)
- you are not holding any block (true)
Effects:
- purple_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1
- white_block_1 is clear
- you are holding purple_block_1

Step 2: Put purple_block_1 on the table
Action: "putdown purple_block_1"
Preconditions:
- you are holding purple_block_1 (true after Step 1)
Effects:
- purple_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Step 3: Pickup green_block_2
Action: "pickup green_block_2"
Preconditions:
- green_block_2 is clear (true)
- green_block_2 is on the table (true)
- you are not holding any block (true after Step 2)
Effects:
- you are holding green_block_2
- green_block_2 is not on the table

Step 4: Put green_block_2 back on the table
Action: "putdown green_block_2"
Preconditions:
- you are holding green_block_2 (true after Step 3)
Effects:
- green_block_2 is on the table
- green_block_2 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Actually, I realize that there's an alternate plan. After we unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1, we could stack it on red_block_1 (or green_block_2) instead of putting it down. Then we could proceed with the rest of the plan. Let me check if this would reduce the number of steps:

Step 1: Unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1
Action: "unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1"
Preconditions:
- purple_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 (true)
- purple_block_1 is clear (true)
- you are not holding any block (true)
Effects:
- purple_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1
- white_block_1 is clear
- you are holding purple_block_1

Step 2: Stack purple_block_1 on red_block_1
Action: "stack purple_block_1 red_block_1"
Preconditions:
- you are holding purple_block_1 (true after Step 1)
- red_block_1 is clear (true)
Effects:
- purple_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- purple_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is not clear
- you are not holding any block

Step 3: Pickup green_block_2
Action: "pickup green_block_2"
Preconditions:
- green_block_2 is clear (true)
- green_block_2 is on the table (true)
- you are not holding any block (true after Step 2)
Effects:
- you are holding green_block_2
- green_block_2 is not on the table

Step 4: Put green_block_2 back on the table
Action: "putdown green_block_2"
Preconditions:
- you are holding green_block_2 (true after Step 3)
Effects:
- green_block_2 is on the table
- green_block_2 is clear
- you are not holding any block

So whether we putdown purple_block_1 or stack it on red_block_1 (or green_block_2), the number of steps remains the same. So I'm sticking with the first plan. Actually, there are 3 options for what to do with purple_block_1 after unstacking it from white_block_1:
1. Putdown purple_block_1 on the table
2. Stack purple_block_1 on red_block_1
3. Stack purple_block_1 on green_block_2

All three options require the same number of steps. For simplicity, I'll stick with option 1.

So the optimal plan is:
```
unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1
putdown purple_block_1
pickup green_block_2
putdown green_block_2
```

Actually, I'm still not 100% sure we need the last step. Let me think again.

Actually, I realize now that I was right the first time. The goal of the planning problem is to bring about a situation where white_block_1 is clear. And we need to satisfy the constraint that at some point, we are holding green_block_2. After step 3, we have achieved the goal (white_block_1 is clear) and satisfied the constraint (we are holding green_block_2). Would step 4 be necessary?

A standard planning problem only cares about the final state, not the intermediate states. If the goal is for white_block_1 to be clear in the final state, then it doesn't matter if it's clear in any intermediate state. Similarly, the constraint is that we are holding green_block_2 at some point in the plan, not that we're holding it in the final state.

Let's clarify the goal:
- white_block_1 must be clear in the final state.

After step 3, white_block_1 is clear and we're holding green_block_2. Is that the final state? If so, we've satisfied both the goal and the constraint. But if there's an expectation that the robotic arm should always end the plan not holding any block (which might be a domain constraint), then step 4 would be necessary.

Since the problem description doesn't seem to specify that the robotic arm should always end the plan not holding any block, it appears that step 3 is sufficient. Let me double check:

Step 1: Unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1
Action: "unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1"
After this, white_block_1 is clear, and we're holding purple_block_1.

Step 2: Put purple_block_1 on the table (or stack it on red_block_1 or green_block_2)
Action: "putdown purple_block_1"
After this, white_block_1 is still clear, and we're not holding any block.

Step 3: Pickup green_block_2
Action: "pickup green_block_2"
After this, white_block_1 is still clear, and we're holding green_block_2.

So, after step 3, we have achieved the goal (white_block_1 is clear) and satisfied the constraint (we have, at some point, been holding green_block_2). If there's no additional domain constraint that the robotic arm should always end the plan not holding any block, then step 3 is the end of the plan. But if there is such a constraint, then we'd need step 4.

Actually I don't need to be holding green_block_2 in the final state. But I also don't know that I should NOT be holding it, so I should lean towards the more conservative option, which is to putdown green_block_2 in the end.

So my final plan is:
```
unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1
putdown purple_block_1
pickup green_block_2
putdown green_block_2
```

But wait, I want to investigate the alternative once more to make sure this is indeed the optimal solution. Let me try once more to see if I can come up with a solution in three steps or fewer.

Actually, I realize there's another approach. Let's look at our goal: make white_block_1 clear. And the constraint: at some point, we should be holding green_block_2.

We just need to ensure that at the end of the plan, white_block_1 is clear, and at some point in the plan, we are holding green_block_2.

Here's an alternative approach:
1. Pickup green_block_2
2. Putdown green_block_2 (or stack it somewhere like red_block_1, which is clear)
3. Unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1

This would also achieve the goal and satisfy the constraint. Let's check if this is correct:

Step 1: Pickup green_block_2
Action: "pickup green_block_2"
Preconditions:
- green_block_2 is clear (true)
- green_block_2 is on the table (true)
- you are not holding any block (true)
Effects:
- you are holding green_block_2
- green_block_2 is not on the table

Step 2: Putdown green_block_2
Action: "putdown green_block_2"
Preconditions:
- you are holding green_block_2 (true after Step 1)
Effects:
- green_block_2 is on the table
- green_block_2 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Step 3: Unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1
Action: "unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1"
Preconditions:
- purple_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 (true)
- purple_block_1 is clear (true)
- you are not holding any block (true after Step 2)
Effects:
- purple_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1
- white_block_1 is clear
- you are holding purple_block_1

So, after step 3, we have achieved the goal (white_block_1 is clear) and satisfied the constraint (we have, at some point, been holding green_block_2).

But wait... in this alternative plan, after step 3, we're holding purple_block_1, so the final state has us holding a block. Is that an issue? It depends on whether there's an implicit constraint that the robotic arm should always end the plan not holding any block.

Again, let's look at the goal statement: "The task is to bring about the following situation: 'there is no block on top of white_block_1, i.e., white_block_1 is clear'". This does not explicitly specify that the robotic arm should not be holding any block at the end.

However, I think it's generally good planning practice to finish the plan with the robotic arm not holding any block, because that's a more versatile final state. That being said, the problem just says the goal is white_block_1 is clear, and it doesn't say anything about the robot arm not holding anything. So this is a valid 3-step plan.

Actually I think you should bring back down the blocks that you pick up. If I were to end at Step 3, I would be left holding purple_block_1. We'd need one more action to put that block somewhere. But also, I'm not sure if "white_block_1 is clear" is true if we're holding the block that was on top of it. 

OK let's think. In our alternative plan, after unstacking purple_block_1 from white_block_1, we're holding purple_block_1. Is the goal "white_block_1 is clear" still achieved in this state?

The definition of "clear" in the problem is "there is no block on top of white_block_1". After unstacking purple_block_1 from white_block_1, there is indeed no block on top of white_block_1, so it is clear. The fact that we're holding purple_block_1 doesn't change this fact. So, I think the goal is still achieved.

But I'm still cautious because we brought purple_block_1 up and not put it down, which is going to be a little strange for a robotic arm to just finish like that. So, if there's room for interpretation, I'd go with the original 4-step plan to be safe.

Let's compare:
Original Plan (4 steps):
```
unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1
putdown purple_block_1
pickup green_block_2
putdown green_block_2
```

Alternative Plan (3 steps):
```
pickup green_block_2
putdown green_block_2
unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1
```

This alternative plan does actually address the goal and the constraint, and it's one step shorter. So it appears to be the optimal solution! Wait, I might be confusing myself. Let me think...

OK for the alternative plan, after step 3, we are left in a state where we are holding purple_block_1 and white_block_1 is clear. So I've achieved the goal (white_block_1 is clear), and at some point in the plan, I held green_block_2 (after step 1), which is the constraint. So I've achieved both goal and constraint in 3 steps. That is fewer steps than my original 4-step plan, so the alternative plan is more optimal!

Actually, there's one more alternative plan:
1. Pickup green_block_2
2. Stack green_block_2 on red_block_1 (or some other clear block)
3. Unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1

Let's check if this is correct:

Step 1: Pickup green_block_2
Action: "pickup green_block_2"
Preconditions:
- green_block_2 is clear (true)
- green_block_2 is on the table (true)
- you are not holding any block (true)
Effects:
- you are holding green_block_2
- green_block_2 is not on the table

Step 2: Stack green_block_2 on red_block_1
Action: "stack green_block_2 red_block_1"
Preconditions:
- you are holding green_block_2 (true after Step 1)
- red_block_1 is clear (true)
Effects:
- green_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- green_block_2 is clear
- red_block_1 is not clear
- you are not holding any block

Step 3: Unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1
Action: "unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1"
Preconditions:
- purple_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 (true)
- purple_block_1 is clear (true)
- you are not holding any block (true after Step 2)
Effects:
- purple_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1
- white_block_1 is clear
- you are holding purple_block_1

The number of steps is the same as the alternative plan, so both are equally optimal.

So I think our optimal solution is either:
```
pickup green_block_2
putdown green_block_2
unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1
```

OR

```
pickup green_block_2
stack green_block_2 red_block_1
unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1
```

Both are 3-step solutions that achieve the goal and satisfy the constraint.

Since we're still holding purple_block_1 at the end, there would be a 4th step to put it down, and in that case, the number of steps would be the same as our original solution.

So I think there are multiple valid 3-step optimal solutions:
1. pickup green_block_2, putdown green_block_2, unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1
2. pickup green_block_2, stack green_block_2 red_block_1, unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1

Ok I need to make a decision. The problem says that the goal is "'there is no block on top of white_block_1, i.e., white_block_1 is clear'". Then there is only one constraint: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are holding green_block_2'". 

I think this 3-step plan achieves what was asked for, and no more:

```
pickup green_block_2
putdown green_block_2
unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1
```

This achieves the goal (white_block_1 is clear) and satisfies the constraint (at one point, we're holding green_block_2).

So this plan seems optimal:
```
pickup green_block_2
putdown green_block_2
unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1
```
