Okay, let's break this down. The goal is to make white_block_1 clear. Currently, purple_block_1 is on top of it. So, we need to remove purple_block_1. The constraint is that we must hold green_block_2 at some point.

Here's the plan:

```
```
unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1
putdown purple_block_1
pickup green_block_2
```
