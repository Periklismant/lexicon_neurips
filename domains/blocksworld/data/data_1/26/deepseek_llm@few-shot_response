Let's break down the problem step by step to find an optimal plan that satisfies the given constraints.

### Initial State:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- green_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
- white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2
- purple_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- green_block_2 is on the table
- red_block_1, purple_block_1, and green_block_2 are clear
- The robotic arm is not holding any block

### Goal:
- white_block_1 is clear (i.e., no block on top of white_block_1)

### Constraints:
- At least one state in the plan must have "you are holding green_block_2"

### Analysis:
Currently, purple_block_1 is on top of white_block_1. To make white_block_1 clear, we need to remove purple_block_1 from its top. This involves unstacking purple_block_1 from white_block_1. 

However, before we can unstack purple_block_1, we need to ensure that the robotic arm is not holding any block (which it isn't initially) and that purple_block_1 is clear (which it is). 

After unstacking purple_block_1, we will be holding it. We can then put it down on the table or stack it elsewhere. 

The constraint requires that at some point, we must hold green_block_2. Since green_block_2 is initially on the table and clear, we can pick it up at any point when the arm is free. 

### Plan:
1. First, unstack purple_block_1 from white_block_1 to make white_block_1 clear. This achieves the goal, but we still need to satisfy the constraint.
2. After unstacking, we are holding purple_block_1. We need to put it down to free the arm.
3. Now, we can pick up green_block_2 to satisfy the constraint.
4. Finally, we can put down green_block_2 to return to a stable state.

### Optimal Plan:
```
```
unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1
putdown purple_block_1
pickup green_block_2
putdown green_block_2
```
```

### Explanation:
1. "unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1": This removes purple_block_1 from white_block_1, making white_block_1 clear (goal achieved). Now holding purple_block_1.
2. "putdown purple_block_1": Places purple_block_1 on the table, freeing the arm.
3. "pickup green_block_2": Picks up green_block_2 to satisfy the constraint. Now holding green_block_2.
4. "putdown green_block_2": Places green_block_2 back on the table to return to a stable state.

This plan is optimal because it achieves the goal in the fewest steps (4 actions) while satisfying the constraint. No shorter plan can satisfy both the goal and the constraint.
