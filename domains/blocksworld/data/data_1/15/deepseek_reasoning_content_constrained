Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. The goal is to get orange_block_2 on the table. But there are some constraints: at some point, blue_block_2 must have a block on top (so it's not clear), and yellow_block_1 must be on the table. So the plan needs to include steps that achieve these conditions at least once.

First, let me look at the initial state. The blocks are arranged as follows:

- blue_block_1 has white_block_1 on it, which in turn has yellow_block_1. On yellow_block_1 is orange_block_2. So the tower here is blue_block_1 -> white_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 -> orange_block_2. Orange_block_2 is clear.

Then, orange_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_1 and blue_block_2 stacked: orange_block_1 -> purple_block_1 -> blue_block_2. Blue_block_2 is clear.

The goal is to have orange_block_2 on the table. So we need to move orange_block_2 from its current position (on top of yellow_block_1) to the table. To do that, we need to unstack it. But since orange_block_2 is currently clear, we can unstack it directly if we're holding nothing. Wait, no, the unstack action requires that the block is on top of another. So orange_block_2 is on yellow_block_1. So to unstack orange_block_2 from yellow_block_1, we can do that as long as we're not holding anything. So the first step might be unstack orange_block_2 yellow_block_1. Then put it down. But wait, unstacking would pick up orange_block_2, then we can put it down. But that would immediately achieve the goal. However, we also have to satisfy the constraints: at some point, blue_block_2 must have a block on top (so it's not clear), and yellow_block_1 must be on the table. 

Wait, the initial state of yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, which is on blue_block_1. So yellow_block_1 is not on the table initially. So to make yellow_block_1 be on the table, we need to move it there. But yellow_block_1 is under orange_block_2. So first, we need to move orange_block_2 off, then move yellow_block_1 to the table. But maybe the constraints require that in some state, both blue_block_2 is not clear (has a block on top) and yellow_block_1 is on the table. So perhaps after moving yellow_block_1 to the table, and then placing a block on blue_block_2. Let's see.

But the main goal is to get orange_block_2 on the table, so the steps might involve:

1. Unstack orange_block_2 from yellow_block_1.
2. Putdown orange_block_2. But this would immediately achieve the goal. However, this plan would be too short and wouldn't satisfy the constraints. So we need to do more steps to meet the constraints.

Wait, the constraints say that at least one state in the plan must have both blue_block_2 not clear and yellow_block_1 on the table. So after we move orange_block_2, we need to handle the other blocks to create that state.

Let's think. To get yellow_block_1 on the table, we need to unstack it from white_block_1. But yellow_block_1 is currently under orange_block_2. So we can't unstack yellow_block_1 until we remove orange_block_2. So first, we need to unstack orange_block_2 and put it somewhere. Then unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1 and put it on the table. Then, for blue_block_2, which is initially clear, we need to place a block on top of it. Blue_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1, which is on orange_block_1. So blue_block_2 is currently on purple_block_1, and it's clear. To put something on blue_block_2, we need to pick up a block and stack it on blue_block_2. But which block can we use?

Possible approach:

1. Unstack orange_block_2 from yellow_block_1. Now holding orange_block_2.
2. Putdown orange_block_2. Now orange_block_2 is on the table. But this achieves the goal. However, this plan doesn't meet the constraints. So we need to do more steps.

Wait, the constraints require that in at least one state during the plan, both conditions are met. So maybe after moving orange_block_2, but before putting it down, we can do some steps that create the required conditions. Let's think again.

Alternative plan:

First, unstack orange_block_2 from yellow_block_1. Then, instead of putting it down immediately, use it to stack on blue_block_2. That way, blue_block_2 would have orange_block_2 on top (so not clear), and then later move it to the table. But also, we need to get yellow_block_1 on the table.

But after unstacking orange_block_2, we are holding it. Then stack it on blue_block_2. That would make blue_block_2 not clear. Then, to get yellow_block_1 on the table, we need to unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1. But to do that, we need to have nothing on top of yellow_block_1. But after moving orange_block_2, yellow_block_1 is clear. So we can then unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1 and put it on the table. Then, unstack orange_block_2 from blue_block_2 and put it on the table. That would satisfy the constraints during the steps where orange_block_2 is on blue_block_2 and yellow_block_1 is on the table.

Let me outline this:

1. unstack orange_block_2 yellow_block_1 → holding orange_block_2
2. stack orange_block_2 blue_block_2 → now blue_block_2 has orange_block_2 on top (not clear)
3. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1 → need to pick up yellow_block_1. But after step 1, yellow_block_1 is clear. So preconditions for unstacking yellow_block_1 from white_block_1: since yellow_block_1 is on white_block_1, and clear. The robotic arm is not holding anything after step 2. So step 3 is possible.
   So step 3: unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1 → holding yellow_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1 → now yellow_block_1 is on the table. At this point, in this state, blue_block_2 is not clear (orange_block_2 is on it), and yellow_block_1 is on the table. So the constraints are met here.
5. Now, we need to get orange_block_2 back. So unstack orange_block_2 blue_block_2 → holding orange_block_2
6. putdown orange_block_2 → done.

But let's check each step's preconditions.

Step 1: unstack orange_block_2 yellow_block_1. Preconditions: orange_block_2 is on yellow_block_1 (yes), orange_block_2 is clear (yes, initial state), and not holding anything (yes, initial state). So valid.

After step 1, holding orange_block_2, yellow_block_1 is clear.

Step 2: stack orange_block_2 blue_block_2. Preconditions: holding orange_block_2 (yes), and blue_block_2 is clear (yes, initially blue_block_2 is clear). So stack is allowed. After stacking, blue_block_2 is not clear, orange_block_2 is on blue_block_2. Robotic arm is empty.

Step 3: unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1. Preconditions: yellow_block_1 is on white_block_1 (yes), yellow_block_1 is clear (yes, after step 1), and arm is empty (yes). So valid. After this, holding yellow_block_1, white_block_1 is clear.

Step 4: putdown yellow_block_1. Preconditions: holding it. Yes. So yellow_block_1 is on the table. Now, in this state, the constraints are met: blue_block_2 has orange_block_2 on it (so not clear) and yellow_block_1 is on table.

Step 5: unstack orange_block_2 blue_block_2. Preconditions: orange_block_2 is on blue_block_2 (yes), orange_block_2 is clear (after step 2, when stacked, stack action makes the top block clear. Wait, the effects of stack x y: x is on y, x is clear (so the top block is clear), y is not clear. Wait, no. Let me recheck the effects.

When you stack x on y, the effects are:

- x is on y (yes)
- x is clear (so x's top is clear)
- y is not clear (since x is on top)
- you are not holding x.

So after stacking orange_block_2 on blue_block_2, orange_block_2 is clear (so nothing is on top of it), and blue_block_2 is not clear. So in step 5, to unstack orange_block_2 from blue_block_2, we need to check if orange_block_2 is clear. Since after step 2, orange_block_2 is on blue_block_2 and is clear. So yes, orange_block_2 is clear. So step 5: unstack orange_block_2 blue_block_2. Preconditions: orange_block_2 is on blue_block_2 (yes), orange_block_2 is clear (yes), and arm is empty (yes, after step 4). So valid.

Step 5: unstack orange_block_2 blue_block_2 → holding orange_block_2.

Step 6: putdown orange_block_2 → done.

So the plan would be:

1. unstack orange_block_2 yellow_block_1
2. stack orange_block_2 blue_block_2
3. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1
5. unstack orange_block_2 blue_block_2
6. putdown orange_block_2

This achieves the goal and meets the constraints. Let's check if there's a shorter plan. For example, can we combine steps?

Alternative approach: After step 1 (holding orange_block_2), stack it on blue_block_2 (step 2). Then unstack yellow_block_1 and putdown. Then unstack orange_block_2 and putdown. That's 6 steps. Is there a way to do it in fewer steps? Let's see.

Suppose after step 4 (yellow on table), can we do something else? Let's see. Maybe not. The constraints are met in step 4. Then proceed to move orange_block_2.

Alternatively, after stacking orange_block_2 on blue_block_2 (step 2), maybe we can directly move it from there to the table. But that requires unstacking (step5) and putdown (step6). So the steps are necessary. So the plan length is 6.

Is there a way to have a shorter plan that still meets the constraints? For example, can we stack orange_block_2 on another block to satisfy the constraints?

Wait, the constraints require that in some state, blue_block_2 is not clear and yellow_block_1 is on the table. Suppose we first move yellow_block_1 to the table, then stack something on blue_block_2. But moving yellow_block_1 requires moving orange_block_2 first. So the steps would be similar.

Alternatively, can we use another block to stack on blue_block_2? For example, take purple_block_1 from orange_block_1 and stack it on blue_block_2. Let's see:

Initial state: purple_block_1 is on orange_block_1, and blue_block_2 is on purple_block_1. Wait, no. The initial state says:

- orange_block_1 is on the table.

- purple_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1.

- blue_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1.

So the tower is orange_block_1 -> purple_block_1 -> blue_block_2. All clear except blue_block_2 is clear (since nothing is on top).

So to stack something on blue_block_2, we can take a block from elsewhere. For example, take purple_block_1 (but it's under blue_block_2). No, can't do that unless we first unstack blue_block_2. Wait, blue_block_2 is on purple_block_1. So to unstack blue_block_2, we need to pick it up (since it's clear). Let's say we unstack blue_block_2 from purple_block_1. Then, we can stack it somewhere else. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe use the white_block_1 or blue_block_1. But that's part of the other tower.

But perhaps using purple_block_1 to stack on blue_block_2. Let's think:

But blue_block_2 is on purple_block_1. So to stack something on blue_block_2, we need to have blue_block_2 clear, which it is initially. Suppose after moving orange_block_2 to blue_block_2, then blue_block_2 is not clear. But then if we unstack blue_block_2 from purple_block_1, but wait, blue_block_2 is on purple_block_1. So to unstack blue_block_2, we can do that as it's clear. Then, if we unstack blue_block_2 and put it somewhere, then stack something on purple_block_1. But this seems longer.

Alternatively, let's consider another path. Maybe stack yellow_block_1 on blue_block_2 after moving it. But I think the initial plan is the most straightforward.

So the steps outlined earlier (6 steps) would work. Let's verify each action:

1. unstack orange_block_2 yellow_block_1 → valid (preconditions met)
2. stack orange_block_2 blue_block_2 → valid (blue_block_2 is clear)
3. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1 → valid (yellow is on white, clear, arm empty)
4. putdown yellow_block_1 → valid
5. unstack orange_block_2 blue_block_2 → valid (orange is on blue, clear, arm empty)
6. putdown orange_block_2 → valid

And during step4, after putting down yellow_block_1, the state has yellow_block_1 on table and blue_block_2 has orange_block_2 on top (not clear). So the constraints are met here. So this plan is valid and meets all conditions. Also, it's 6 steps. Can there be a shorter plan? Let's see.

Suppose after stacking orange_block_2 on blue_block_2 (step2), can we then directly unstack it and put it down? But that would be steps 2, then unstack, then putdown. But then the yellow_block_1 is still on white_block_1, not on the table. So the constraints require yellow_block_1 to be on the table. So we need to move it. So steps 3 and 4 are necessary. Therefore, the plan must be at least 6 steps. So the initial plan is optimal.
