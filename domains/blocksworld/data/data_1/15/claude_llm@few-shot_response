I'll solve this planning problem step by step.

First, let me understand the initial state:
- Stack 1: blue_block_1 (bottom) -> white_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 -> orange_block_2 (top, clear)
- Stack 2: orange_block_1 (bottom) -> purple_block_1 -> blue_block_2 (top, clear)
- The arm is empty

The goal is to have orange_block_2 on the table.

The constraint requires that at some point, blue_block_2 must have something on top of it AND yellow_block_1 must be on the table.

Let me plan the solution:

```
unstack orange_block_2 yellow_block_1
putdown orange_block_2
unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
putdown yellow_block_1
unstack blue_block_2 purple_block_1
stack blue_block_2 yellow_block_1
```

This plan:
1. Removes orange_block_2 from yellow_block_1 and puts it on the table (achieving the goal)
2. Puts yellow_block_1 on the table
3. Moves blue_block_2 on top of yellow_block_1

After these steps, we have:
- orange_block_2 on the table (goal achieved)
- yellow_block_1 on the table with blue_block_2 on top of it (constraint satisfied)
