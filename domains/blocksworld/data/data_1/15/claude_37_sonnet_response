I need to find an optimal plan to reach the goal state where "orange_block_2 is on the table." Let's start by understanding the initial state and the goal.

Initial state:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- orange_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1
- purple_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- blue_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1
- orange_block_2 is clear
- blue_block_2 is clear
- you are not holding any block

This can be visualized as follows:
```
orange_block_2    blue_block_2
yellow_block_1    purple_block_1
white_block_1     orange_block_1
blue_block_1      table
table
```

Goal state:
- orange_block_2 is on the table

Additional constraint:
- At some point in the plan, blue_block_2 must not be clear (i.e., there must be a block on top of it) AND yellow_block_1 must be on the table.

So, I need to find a way to get orange_block_2 from the top of yellow_block_1 to the table, and somewhere in the process, I need to have a state where blue_block_2 is not clear and yellow_block_1 is on the table.

Let's think about how to satisfy the constraint. Initially, yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, and blue_block_2 is clear. So I need to:
1. Get yellow_block_1 to the table
2. Put some block on top of blue_block_2

Now, let's think about how to get orange_block_2 to the table. It's on top of yellow_block_1 and it's clear, so I can unstack it, then put it down on the table.

Here's a plan:

1. Unstack orange_block_2 from yellow_block_1 (now I'm holding orange_block_2, and yellow_block_1 is clear)
2. Stack orange_block_2 on blue_block_2 (now orange_block_2 is on blue_block_2, and blue_block_2 is not clear)
3. Unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1 (now I'm holding yellow_block_1, and white_block_1 is clear)
4. Putdown yellow_block_1 (now yellow_block_1 is on the table)
   * At this point, blue_block_2 is not clear (orange_block_2 is on it) and yellow_block_1 is on the table, satisfying the constraint
5. Unstack orange_block_2 from blue_block_2 (now I'm holding orange_block_2, and blue_block_2 is clear)
6. Putdown orange_block_2 (now orange_block_2 is on the table, achieving the goal)

Let's check if this plan is valid by simulating the actions:

Initial state:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- orange_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1
- purple_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- blue_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1
- orange_block_2 is clear
- blue_block_2 is clear
- you are not holding any block

After action 1: Unstack orange_block_2 from yellow_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- blue_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- blue_block_2 is clear
- you are holding orange_block_2

After action 2: Stack orange_block_2 on blue_block_2
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- blue_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1
- orange_block_2 is on top of blue_block_2
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- orange_block_2 is clear
- you are not holding any block

After action 3: Unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- blue_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1
- orange_block_2 is on top of blue_block_2
- white_block_1 is clear
- orange_block_2 is clear
- you are holding yellow_block_1

After action 4: Putdown yellow_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- blue_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1
- orange_block_2 is on top of blue_block_2
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is clear
- orange_block_2 is clear
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

After action 5: Unstack orange_block_2 from blue_block_2
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- blue_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is clear
- blue_block_2 is clear
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- you are holding orange_block_2

After action 6: Putdown orange_block_2
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- blue_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- orange_block_2 is on the table
- white_block_1 is clear
- blue_block_2 is clear
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- orange_block_2 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Great! In the final state, orange_block_2 is on the table, which is our goal. And at one point (after action 4), blue_block_2 is not clear (because orange_block_2 is on it) and yellow_block_1 is on the table, satisfying the constraint.

Actually, wait. Let me double check the constraint satisfaction: "there is a block on top of blue_block_2, i.e., blue_block_2 is not clear", "yellow_block_1 is on the table".

After action 4:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- blue_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1
- orange_block_2 is on top of blue_block_2
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is clear
- orange_block_2 is clear
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Yes, blue_block_2 is not clear because orange_block_2 is on top of it, and yellow_block_1 is on the table. So the constraint is satisfied.

However, I want to double check the validity of the action sequence again, making sure the preconditions of each action are met.

Initial state:
```
orange_block_2    blue_block_2
yellow_block_1    purple_block_1
white_block_1     orange_block_1
blue_block_1      table
table
```

1. Unstack orange_block_2 from yellow_block_1: 
   - Preconditions: orange_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1, orange_block_2 is clear, and I'm not holding any block.
   - These are all true in the initial state.

After action 1:
```
              blue_block_2
yellow_block_1    purple_block_1
white_block_1     orange_block_1
blue_block_1      table
table
```
I'm holding orange_block_2.

2. Stack orange_block_2 on blue_block_2: 
   - Preconditions: I'm holding orange_block_2, and blue_block_2 is clear.
   - Both are true after action 1.

After action 2:
```
orange_block_2
blue_block_2
yellow_block_1    purple_block_1
white_block_1     orange_block_1
blue_block_1      table
table
```
I'm not holding any block.

Wait... I need to re-think this. I think I've been visualizing the blocks incorrectly. Let's reconstruct the initial state more carefully.

Initial state:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- orange_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1
- purple_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- blue_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1
- orange_block_2 is clear
- blue_block_2 is clear
- you are not holding any block

So the blocks are arranged in two stacks:
Stack 1: blue_block_1 (bottom), white_block_1, yellow_block_1, orange_block_2 (top)
Stack 2: orange_block_1 (bottom), purple_block_1, blue_block_2 (top)

Visually:
```
orange_block_2    blue_block_2
yellow_block_1    purple_block_1
white_block_1     orange_block_1
blue_block_1      table
table
```

Now let me verify my plan again:

1. Unstack orange_block_2 from yellow_block_1: 
   - Preconditions: orange_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1, orange_block_2 is clear, and I'm not holding any block.
   - All true in the initial state.

After action 1:
```
                 blue_block_2
yellow_block_1   purple_block_1
white_block_1    orange_block_1
blue_block_1     table
table
```
I'm holding orange_block_2.

2. Stack orange_block_2 on blue_block_2: 
   - Preconditions: I'm holding orange_block_2, and blue_block_2 is clear.
   - Both are true after action 1.

After action 2:
```
                 orange_block_2
                 blue_block_2
yellow_block_1   purple_block_1
white_block_1    orange_block_1
blue_block_1     table
table
```
I'm not holding any block.

3. Unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1: 
   - Preconditions: yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, yellow_block_1 is clear, and I'm not holding any block.
   - All true after action 2.

After action 3:
```
                 orange_block_2
                 blue_block_2
                 purple_block_1
white_block_1    orange_block_1
blue_block_1     table
table
```
I'm holding yellow_block_1.

4. Putdown yellow_block_1: 
   - Precondition: I'm holding yellow_block_1.
   - True after action 3.

After action 4:
```
                 orange_block_2
                 blue_block_2
yellow_block_1   purple_block_1
white_block_1    orange_block_1
blue_block_1     table
table
```
I'm not holding any block.

At this point, blue_block_2 is not clear (orange_block_2 is on it) and yellow_block_1 is on the table, satisfying the constraint.

5. Unstack orange_block_2 from blue_block_2: 
   - Preconditions: orange_block_2 is on top of blue_block_2, orange_block_2 is clear, and I'm not holding any block.
   - All true after action 4.

After action 5:
```
                 
                 blue_block_2
yellow_block_1   purple_block_1
white_block_1    orange_block_1
blue_block_1     table
table
```
I'm holding orange_block_2.

6. Putdown orange_block_2: 
   - Precondition: I'm holding orange_block_2.
   - True after action 5.

After action 6:
```
                 
orange_block_2   blue_block_2
yellow_block_1   purple_block_1
white_block_1    orange_block_1
blue_block_1     table
table
```
I'm not holding any block, and orange_block_2 is on the table, which is our goal.

Great, the plan is valid and achieves the goal while satisfying the constraint. Let's format it as requested:

```
unstack orange_block_2 yellow_block_1
stack orange_block_2 blue_block_2
unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
putdown yellow_block_1
unstack orange_block_2 blue_block_2
putdown orange_block_2
```

Actually, let me make sure that this is indeed the optimal (shortest) plan. Let's think about other possibilities.

The goal is to get orange_block_2 to the table. Initially, orange_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1, so we need to unstack it. After that, we have two choices:
1. Put orange_block_2 directly on the table
2. Stack orange_block_2 somewhere else, which we did in our plan to satisfy the constraint

If we put orange_block_2 directly on the table, we would still need to satisfy the constraint. This would involve unstacking yellow_block_1 and putting it on the table, as well as putting some block on top of blue_block_2. This would be:

1. Unstack orange_block_2 from yellow_block_1 (I'm holding orange_block_2, yellow_block_1 is clear)
2. Putdown orange_block_2 (orange_block_2 is on the table, I'm not holding anything)
3. Unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1 (I'm holding yellow_block_1, white_block_1 is clear)
4. Putdown yellow_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is on the table, I'm not holding anything)
5. Pickup yellow_block_1 (I'm holding yellow_block_1)
6. Stack yellow_block_1 on blue_block_2 (yellow_block_1 is on blue_block_2, blue_block_2 is not clear, I'm not holding anything)

This is 6 actions, the same as our original plan. However, I see that the fifth action (picking up yellow_block_1 just after we put it down) seems redundant, we should be able to do better.

Let's try this alternate plan:

1. Unstack orange_block_2 from yellow_block_1 (I'm holding orange_block_2, yellow_block_1 is clear)
2. Putdown orange_block_2 (orange_block_2 is on the table, I'm not holding anything)
3. Unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1 (I'm holding yellow_block_1, white_block_1 is clear)
4. Stack yellow_block_1 on blue_block_2 (yellow_block_1 is on blue_block_2, blue_block_2 is not clear, I'm not holding anything)

This is only 4 actions, but it doesn't satisfy the constraint, because we need to have a state where both blue_block_2 is not clear and yellow_block_1 is on the table. In this plan, yellow_block_1 is never on the table; it goes from white_block_1 to blue_block_2.

Actually, we need to be more careful with the constraint. So, I need a point where both of the following are true at the same time:
1. There is a block on top of blue_block_2.
2. Yellow_block_1 is on the table.

In our original plan, after action 4, both of these conditions are met.

Let's consider another approach:

1. Unstack orange_block_2 from yellow_block_1 (I'm holding orange_block_2, yellow_block_1 is clear)
2. Putdown orange_block_2 (orange_block_2 is on the table, I'm not holding anything)
3. Unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1 (I'm holding yellow_block_1, white_block_1 is clear)
4. Putdown yellow_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is on the table, I'm not holding anything)
5. Pickup some block and stack it on blue_block_2 to make blue_block_2 not clear

This would also satisfy the goal and constraint, but it would take at least 5 actions, and it's not clear which block we should pick up to stack on blue_block_2.

Let's consider yet another approach:

1. Unstack orange_block_2 from yellow_block_1 (I'm holding orange_block_2, yellow_block_1 is clear)
2. Stack orange_block_2 on blue_block_2 (orange_block_2 is on blue_block_2, I'm not holding anything)
3. Unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1 (I'm holding yellow_block_1, white_block_1 is clear)
4. Putdown yellow_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is on the table, I'm not holding anything)
   * At this point, blue_block_2 is not clear (orange_block_2 is on it) and yellow_block_1 is on the table, satisfying the constraint.
5. Unstack orange_block_2 from blue_block_2 (I'm holding orange_block_2, blue_block_2 is clear)
6. Putdown orange_block_2 (orange_block_2 is on the table, I'm not holding anything)

This is also 6 actions. This is the same plan I had initially. I don't see a way to do this in fewer than 6 actions if we need to satisfy the constraint.

Actually, wait. Let's go through the constraint again:

```
"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 
"The following conditions are all true: "there is a block on top of blue_block_2, i.e., blue_block_2 is not clear", "yellow_block_1 is on the table"""
```

The constraint requires that at some point during the execution of our plan, blue_block_2 must not be clear (i.e., there must be a block on top of it) AND yellow_block_1 must be on the table.

Let's optimize the plan and see if we can find a shorter path:

1. Unstack orange_block_2 from yellow_block_1 (I'm holding orange_block_2, yellow_block_1 is clear)
2. Putdown orange_block_2 (orange_block_2 is on the table, I'm not holding anything)

In just these two actions, we've already achieved our goal of having orange_block_2 on the table. But this doesn't satisfy the constraint, since blue_block_2 is still clear and yellow_block_1 is not on the table. So we need to continue.

3. Unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1 (I'm holding yellow_block_1, white_block_1 is clear)
4. Putdown yellow_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is on the table, I'm not holding anything)
   * At this point, yellow_block_1 is on the table, but blue_block_2 is still clear, so we don't yet satisfy the constraint.
5. Pickup yellow_block_1 (I'm holding yellow_block_1)
6. Stack yellow_block_1 on blue_block_2 (yellow_block_1 is on blue_block_2, blue_block_2 is not clear, I'm not holding anything)
7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_2 (I'm holding yellow_block_1, blue_block_2 is clear)
8. Putdown yellow_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is on the table, I'm not holding anything)
   * At this point, yellok_block_1 is on the table and blue_block_2 is clear.

So we made two iterations of moving yellow_block_1 around, and we never satisfied the constraint (having blue_block_2 not clear AND yellow_block_1 on the table at the same time).

OK, now going back to our original plan:

1. Unstack orange_block_2 from yellow_block_1
2. Stack orange_block_2 on blue_block_2
3. Unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
4. Putdown yellow_block_1
   * Here, the constraint is satisfied: blue_block_2 is not clear (orange_block_2 is on it) and yellow_block_1 is on the table.
5. Unstack orange_block_2 from blue_block_2
6. Putdown orange_block_2

This achieves the goal in 6 steps. But I'm wondering if we really need to satisfy the constraint at the same time as we achieve the goal. Let's review the problem specification again.

The problem statement says:

"A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:
'The following expression must hold in at least one state: "The following conditions are all true: "there is a block on top of blue_block_2, i.e., blue_block_2 is not clear", "yellow_block_1 is on the table"""'"

This means that at some point during the execution of our plan, both of these conditions must be true. But it doesn't say that the goal (orange_block_2 is on the table) must be true at the same time. So we could potentially have a state where the constraint is satisfied, and a later state where the goal is achieved.

Let's try to optimize our plan again:

1. Unstack orange_block_2 from yellow_block_1 (I'm holding orange_block_2, yellow_block_1 is clear)
2. Stack orange_block_2 on blue_block_2 (orange_block_2 is on blue_block_2, I'm not holding anything)
3. Unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1 (I'm holding yellow_block_1, white_block_1 is clear)
4. Putdown yellow_block_1 (yellow_block_1 is on the table, I'm not holding anything)
   * At this point, the constraint is satisfied: blue_block_2 is not clear (orange_block_2 is on it) and yellow_block_1 is on the table.
5. Unstack orange_block_2 from blue_block_2 (I'm holding orange_block_2, blue_block_2 is clear)
6. Putdown orange_block_2 (orange_block_2 is on the table, I'm not holding anything)
   * At this point, the goal is achieved: orange_block_2 is on the table.

This seems to be the best we can do.

Let's double check the validity of this plan one last time:

Final verification:
- Goal: orange_block_2 is on the table. This is satisfied.
- Constraint: At some point, both "there is a block on top of blue_block_2" and "yellow_block_1 is on the table" were true. This was satisfied after action 4.

Great, so the plan is valid and achieves the goal while satisfying the constraint. I believe this is the optimal (shortest) plan, with 6 actions.

Here's the plan in the requested format:

unstack orange_block_2 yellow_block_1
stack orange_block_2 blue_block_2
unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
putdown yellow_block_1
unstack orange_block_2 blue_block_2
putdown orange_block_2
