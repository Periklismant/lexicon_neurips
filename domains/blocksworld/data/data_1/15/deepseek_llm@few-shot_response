Let's break down the problem step by step to find an optimal plan that satisfies the given constraints.

### Initial State:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- orange_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1
- purple_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- blue_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1
- orange_block_2 is clear
- blue_block_2 is clear
- The robotic arm is not holding any block.

### Goal:
- orange_block_2 is on the table.

### Constraints:
1. At least one state in the plan must satisfy:
   - blue_block_2 is not clear (i.e., there is a block on top of blue_block_2).
   - yellow_block_1 is on the table.

### Plan Construction:
To achieve the goal, we need to move orange_block_2 to the table. Since orange_block_2 is currently on top of yellow_block_1, we need to unstack it. However, yellow_block_1 is not on the table initially, so we need to first move yellow_block_1 to the table. 

Additionally, we need to ensure that at some point in the plan, blue_block_2 is not clear and yellow_block_1 is on the table. 

Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. **Unstack orange_block_2 from yellow_block_1**: This will make orange_block_2 held by the robotic arm and yellow_block_1 clear.
2. **Putdown orange_block_2 on the table**: This achieves the goal, but we haven't satisfied the constraints yet.
3. To satisfy the constraints, we need to have a state where blue_block_2 is not clear and yellow_block_1 is on the table. We can achieve this by:
   - Moving yellow_block_1 to the table (which requires unstacking it from white_block_1).
   - Placing some block on top of blue_block_2 (e.g., white_block_1).

However, since the goal is only to have orange_block_2 on the table, we can rearrange the steps to satisfy the constraints while achieving the goal.

### Optimal Plan:
Here's the optimal plan that satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal:

```
```
unstack orange_block_2 yellow_block_1
putdown orange_block_2
unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
putdown yellow_block_1
unstack white_block_1 blue_block_1
stack white_block_1 blue_block_2
```
```

### Explanation:
1. **unstack orange_block_2 yellow_block_1**: This moves orange_block_2 to the robotic arm, making yellow_block_1 clear.
2. **putdown orange_block_2**: This places orange_block_2 on the table, achieving the goal.
3. **unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1**: This moves yellow_block_1 to the robotic arm, making white_block_1 clear.
4. **putdown yellow_block_1**: This places yellow_block_1 on the table, satisfying one part of the constraint (yellow_block_1 is on the table).
5. **unstack white_block_1 blue_block_1**: This moves white_block_1 to the robotic arm, making blue_block_1 clear.
6. **stack white_block_1 blue_block_2**: This places white_block_1 on top of blue_block_2, making blue_block_2 not clear, thus satisfying the other part of the constraint.

At the end of step 6, the constraints are satisfied (blue_block_2 is not clear and yellow_block_1 is on the table), and the goal is achieved (orange_block_2 is on the table). The plan is optimal because it achieves the goal and satisfies the constraints in the minimal number of steps.
