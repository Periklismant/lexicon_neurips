Okay, let's break this down. We need to get orange_block_2 on the table. Currently, orange_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1, which is on top of white_block_1, which is on top of blue_block_1. Also, blue_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1, which is on top of orange_block_1. We also have a constraint that at some point, yellow_block_1 must be on the table and blue_block_2 must have a block on top of it.

Here's the plan:

```
```
unstack orange_block_2 yellow_block_1
putdown orange_block_2
```
