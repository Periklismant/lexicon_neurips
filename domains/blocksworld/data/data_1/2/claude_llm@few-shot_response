I'll solve this planning problem step by step.

First, let me analyze the initial state and goal:
- Initial state: yellow_block_1 is on red_block_1, white_block_1 is on blue_block_1, purple_block_2 is on purple_block_1, green_block_1 is on the table
- Goal: green_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- Constraints: 
  1. At some point, I must be holding green_block_1
  2. After holding green_block_1, yellow_block_1 must be on top of purple_block_1 (either at that moment or later)

To achieve the goal, I need to:
1. Pick up green_block_1 (satisfying the first constraint)
2. Make yellow_block_1 available to stack green_block_1 on it
3. Ensure yellow_block_1 is on purple_block_1 (for the second constraint)

Let's plan this out:

```
unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_1
stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
pickup green_block_1
stack green_block_1 yellow_block_1
```

This plan:
1. Unstacks yellow_block_1 from red_block_1
2. Stacks yellow_block_1 on purple_block_1 (satisfying the second constraint)
3. Picks up green_block_1 (satisfying the first constraint)
4. Stacks green_block_1 on yellow_block_1 (achieving the goal)

The plan is optimal with 4 actions and satisfies all constraints.
