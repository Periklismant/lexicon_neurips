Let's break down the problem and analyze what we need to do. 

We have the initial state:
- red_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- purple_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- white_block_1 is clear
- green_block_1 is clear
- purple_block_2 is clear
- you are not holding any block

And the goal state:
- green_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1

We also have these constraints:
1. At some point, "you are holding green_block_1" must be true.
2. If "you are holding green_block_1" is true at state s, then at state s or at some state after s, "yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1" must be true.

Let's think step by step:

- First, we need to pick up green_block_1 at some point to satisfy constraint 1.
- Then, according to constraint 2, once we're holding green_block_1, we need to ensure that yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1 either immediately or in a future state.
- Finally, we need to ensure that green_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1 to meet the goal.

So, let's check the blocks' current positions:
- yellow_block_1 is on top of red_block_1, and we need it to be on top of purple_block_1 at some point after picking up green_block_1.
- purple_block_1 is on the table, but it has purple_block_2 on top of it, so it's not clear.

We need to do the following:
1. Pick up green_block_1 from the table.
2. Temporarily put down green_block_1 somewhere.
3. Make purple_block_1 clear by removing purple_block_2.
4. Move yellow_block_1 from red_block_1 to purple_block_1.
5. Pick up green_block_1 again.
6. Stack green_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1.

But, no, this plan doesn't satisfy the constraints. The problem is that we have to pick up green_block_1 and then ensure yellow_block_1 is on purple_block_1 either immediately or in the future.

Let's rethink.

I think we can do the following:
1. Clear purple_block_1 by removing purple_block_2.
2. Move yellow_block_1 from red_block_1 to some temporary position (either on the table or on another block).
3. Pick up green_block_1 from the table. This satisfies constraint 1.
4. Place green_block_1 on the table or somewhere temporarily.
5. Move yellow_block_1 from its temporary position to purple_block_1. This, along with steps 3-4, satisfies constraint 2.
6. Pick up green_block_1 again.
7. Stack green_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1. This satisfies the goal.

Alternatively, we could do these steps:
1. Clear purple_block_1 by removing purple_block_2.
2. Pick up green_block_1 from the table. This satisfies constraint 1.
3. Place green_block_1 on the table temporarily or somewhere else.
4. Move yellow_block_1 from red_block_1 to purple_block_1. This, along with steps 2-3, satisfies constraint 2.
5. Pick up green_block_1 again.
6. Stack green_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1. This satisfies the goal.

Let's go with the second approach:

1. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
2. putdown purple_block_2
3. pickup green_block_1
4. putdown green_block_1
5. unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_1
6. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
7. pickup green_block_1
8. stack green_block_1 yellow_block_1

Hmm, actually, I see that after picking up green_block_1, we also need to immediately have yellow_block_1 on top of purple_block_1, or ensure it happens afterwards. In this case, after picking up green_block_1 and then putting it down, we'd move yellow_block_1 to purple_block_1.

But we need to think more:

Actually, the constraint doesn't necessarily mean that we need to put down green_block_1 after picking it up. We could also directly stack green_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1 (our goal) after yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1.

So, here's another approach:
1. Clear purple_block_1 by removing purple_block_2.
2. Move yellow_block_1 from red_block_1 to purple_block_1.
3. Pick up green_block_1 from the table. This satisfies constraint 1.
4. Stack green_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1. This satisfies constraint 2 and the goal.

This would be:
1. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
2. putdown purple_block_2
3. unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_1
4. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
5. pickup green_block_1
6. stack green_block_1 yellow_block_1

Wait, this approach doesn't work. Let's reread the constraint. 

The constraint says: "If 'you are holding green_block_1' holds in some state s, then 'yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1' must hold at s or at some state after s."

This means that once we're holding green_block_1, we need to either have yellow_block_1 on top of purple_block_1 immediately or ensure it happens afterwards.

Actually, in both of the plans I sketched, we do satisfy this constraint.

In the second plan:
- Step 5: We pick up green_block_1.
- Step 6: We stack green_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1. At this point, yellow_block_1 is already on top of purple_block_1.

So, constraint 2 is satisfied because "yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1" holds at the same time as "you are holding green_block_1".

Actually, wait. The constraint is precise: "If 'you are holding green_block_1' holds in some state s, then 'yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1' must hold at s or at some state after s."

This means that the state in which we're holding green_block_1 or a state that comes after it must have yellow_block_1 on top of purple_block_1.

In the second plan:
- Step 5: We pick up green_block_1.
- Steps after 5: We stack green_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1. At this point, yellow_block_1 is already on top of purple_block_1.

So, constraint 2 is satisfied.

I think the second plan I sketched is valid and I'll go with it for now.

1. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
2. putdown purple_block_2
3. unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_1
4. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
5. pickup green_block_1
6. stack green_block_1 yellow_block_1

However, let's think again.

Actually, I think I've been overcomplicating this. Let's reread the constraints carefully:

1. At some point, "you are holding green_block_1" must be true.
2. If "you are holding green_block_1" is true at state s, then at state s or at some state after s, "yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1" must be true.

This can be simplified to: We need to pick up green_block_1 at some point, and after (or at the same time as) we pick it up, yellow_block_1 needs to be on top of purple_block_1.

This suggests a simple strategy:
1. First, position yellow_block_1 on top of purple_block_1.
2. Then, pick up green_block_1. Now we're holding green_block_1 and yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1, satisfying both constraints.
3. Finally, put green_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1, satisfying the goal.

So, the plan would be:
1. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1 (to make purple_block_1 clear)
2. putdown purple_block_2
3. unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_1 (to get yellow_block_1)
4. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1 (positioning yellow_block_1 on top of purple_block_1)
5. pickup green_block_1 (satisfying constraint 1, and with constraint 2 satisfied already)
6. stack green_block_1 yellow_block_1 (satisfying the goal)

Actually, let's reconsider again. I might be overthinking.

Let's get back to the basic constraints:
1. At some point, we need to hold green_block_1.
2. If (or when) we're holding green_block_1, yellow_block_1 should be on top of purple_block_1 (either at that moment or at some point afterward).

And the goal is to have green_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1.

One approach could be:
1. First, arrange yellow_block_1 on top of purple_block_1.
2. Then, pick up green_block_1 (satisfying constraint 1). At this moment, or later, yellow_block_1 needs to be on top of purple_block_1 (which it is, satisfying constraint 2).
3. Stack green_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1 (satisfying the goal).

The plan would be:
1. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
2. putdown purple_block_2
3. unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_1
4. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
5. pickup green_block_1
6. stack green_block_1 yellow_block_1

This plan does satisfy all the constraints and goals.

Alright, the plan is valid, so let's stick with it:
1. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
2. putdown purple_block_2
3. unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_1
4. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
5. pickup green_block_1
6. stack green_block_1 yellow_block_1

But wait, let me think a bit more. The constraints require: "If expression 'you are holding green_block_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1' must hold at s or at some state after s."

Hmm, there's actually another approach we could take. Instead of arranging yellow_block_1 on top of purple_block_1 first, we could pick up green_block_1 first. This would satisfy constraint 1. Then, we'd need to ensure that yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1 either at that moment or later (which currently isn't the case). So, we'd put down green_block_1 somewhere, arrange yellow_block_1 on top of purple_block_1, then pick up green_block_1 again and put it on top of yellow_block_1.

This would be:
1. pickup green_block_1 (satisfying constraint 1)
2. putdown green_block_1
3. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
4. putdown purple_block_2
5. unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_1
6. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1 (satisfying constraint 2)
7. pickup green_block_1
8. stack green_block_1 yellow_block_1 (satisfying the goal)

Both plans satisfy the constraints and goal. But let's count the number of steps:
- First approach: 6 steps.
- Second approach: 8 steps.

The first approach is shorter and thus more optimal. But wait, let's quickly check if there's an even more efficient way.

Could we make the first approach shorter? We're using all necessary steps to move blocks and achieve the goal, so I don't think we can shorten it.

What about the second approach? We added steps to pick up and put down green_block_1 at the beginning, which were extra. The rest is the same as the first approach.

So, the first approach with 6 steps is more optimal. Let's go with:
1. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
2. putdown purple_block_2
3. unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_1
4. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
5. pickup green_block_1
6. stack green_block_1 yellow_block_1

I realize there might be yet another approach. Let's see if we can make it shorter by manipulating the blocks in a different order.

Thinking about the constraints:
1. green_block_1 must be held at some point.
2. After (or at the same time as) green_block_1 is held, yellow_block_1 must be on top of purple_block_1.

And the goal is to have green_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1.

Let's see if we can be clever and combine some operations.

Actually, let's check one more approach. What if we try this:
1. pickup green_block_1 (satisfying constraint 1)
2. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1 (with one hand holding green_block_1)
3. ... wait, this doesn't work because we can only hold one block at a time.

So, I think our first approach was the most efficient.

Actually, the very first approach I sketched was the most optimal:
1. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
2. putdown purple_block_2
3. unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_1
4. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
5. pickup green_block_1
6. stack green_block_1 yellow_block_1

Wait, there's another possibility: what if we achieve the goal and then make yellow_block_1 on top of purple_block_1 afterwards?

Actually, we can't do that. The goal is to have green_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1, so yellow_block_1 would have a block on top of it. This would conflict with trying to place yellow_block_1 on top of purple_block_1 later.

Alright, I'm convinced that the 6-step plan is the most optimal.

1. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1 (Removing purple_block_2 from purple_block_1 to make purple_block_1 clear)
2. putdown purple_block_2 (Placing purple_block_2 on the table)
3. unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_1 (Removing yellow_block_1 from red_block_1)
4. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1 (Placing yellow_block_1 on top of purple_block_1, satisfying constraint 2 in the future)
5. pickup green_block_1 (Picking up green_block_1, satisfying constraint 1. At this point, yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1, satisfying constraint 2)
6. stack green_block_1 yellow_block_1 (Placing green_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1, satisfying the goal)
