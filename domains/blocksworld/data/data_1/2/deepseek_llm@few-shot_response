To solve this planning problem, we need to achieve the goal of having `green_block_1` on top of `yellow_block_1` while satisfying the given constraints. Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `red_block_1` is on the table with `yellow_block_1` on top (and `yellow_block_1` is clear).
- `blue_block_1` is on the table with `white_block_1` on top (and `white_block_1` is clear).
- `purple_block_1` is on the table with `purple_block_2` on top (and `purple_block_2` is clear).
- `green_block_1` is on the table (and clear).
- The robotic arm is not holding any block.

### Goal:
- `green_block_1` is on top of `yellow_block_1`.

### Constraints:
1. At some point, the robotic arm must be holding `green_block_1`.
2. If the robotic arm is holding `green_block_1` in some state, then `yellow_block_1` must be on top of `purple_block_1` either at that state or a subsequent state.

### Plan:
1. To satisfy the first constraint, we must pick up `green_block_1` at some point.
2. To satisfy the second constraint, after picking up `green_block_1`, we must ensure that `yellow_block_1` is on top of `purple_block_1` either at that state or later. This means we need to move `yellow_block_1` from `red_block_1` to `purple_block_1` before or after picking up `green_block_1`.
3. Finally, we need to stack `green_block_1` on top of `yellow_block_1`.

### Optimal Plan:
Here is the step-by-step optimal plan that satisfies all constraints:

```
```
unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_1
putdown yellow_block_1
pickup green_block_1
stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
stack green_block_1 yellow_block_1
```
```

### Explanation:
1. `unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_1`: This action picks up `yellow_block_1` from `red_block_1` (since `yellow_block_1` is clear and the arm is empty).
2. `putdown yellow_block_1`: This places `yellow_block_1` on the table temporarily to free the arm for picking up `green_block_1`.
3. `pickup green_block_1`: This picks up `green_block_1` from the table (satisfying the first constraint).
4. `stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1`: This stacks `yellow_block_1` on top of `purple_block_1` (satisfying the second constraint, as `yellow_block_1` is now on `purple_block_1` after the arm holds `green_block_1`).
5. `stack green_block_1 yellow_block_1`: This stacks `green_block_1` on top of `yellow_block_1`, achieving the goal.

This plan is optimal because it achieves the goal in 5 actions while satisfying all constraints. No shorter valid plan exists that meets all requirements.
