Okay, let's break this down. We need to get green_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1. We also have two constraints: 1) We must hold green_block_1 at some point. 2) When we hold green_block_1, or after that, yellow_block_1 must be on top of purple_block_1.

Here's the plan:

1.  Clear yellow_block_1: Since yellow_block_1 is already clear, we don't need to do anything.
2.  Clear the table for green_block_1: We need to move blocks that are on the table.
3.  Unstack white_block_1 from blue_block_1: This makes blue_block_1 clear.
4.  Putdown white_block_1: This puts white_block_1 on the table.
5.  Unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1: This makes purple_block_1 clear.
6.  Putdown purple_block_2: This puts purple_block_2 on the table.
7.  Pickup green_block_1: Now we are holding green_block_1, satisfying the first constraint.
8.  Stack green_block_1 yellow_block_1: This puts green_block_1 on yellow_block_1.
9.  Pickup yellow_block_1: Now we are holding yellow_block_1.
10. Stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1: Now yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1, satisfying the second constraint.
