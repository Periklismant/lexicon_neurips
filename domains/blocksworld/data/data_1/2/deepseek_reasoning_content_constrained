Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld problem. So, the initial state has several blocks arranged in specific ways. The goal is to get green_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1. But there are some constraints to consider. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the initial state. Red_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top of it, and yellow is clear. Blue_block_1 is on the table with white_block_1 on top, and white is clear. Purple_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_2 on top, and purple_block_2 is clear. Green_block_1 is alone on the table and clear. The robot isn't holding anything.

The goal is green on yellow. So, I need to move green_block_1 to yellow_block_1. But how?

Constraints: The plan must include holding green_block_1 at least once. Also, whenever green is held, either yellow is on purple at that state or in a subsequent state. So, if I pick up green, I need to ensure that either when I pick it up, yellow is already on purple, or after picking it up, I make yellow be on purple at some point.

Let me think about the order. To stack green on yellow, I need yellow to be clear. Currently, yellow is under red_block_1. Wait, no, initial state says yellow is on red, and yellow is clear. So yellow is on red, and nothing is on yellow. So, to stack green on yellow, I need to have yellow clear, which it already is. So I can pick up green and stack it on yellow. But wait, yellow is on red, so stacking green on yellow would require that yellow is clear (which it is) and that the robot is holding green.

But the constraint says that when I hold green, either at that moment or later, yellow must be on purple. So I need to ensure that after picking up green, at some point, yellow is moved from red to purple.

Wait, that's a problem. Because initially, yellow is on red. To move yellow to purple, I need to unstack yellow from red. But yellow is on red, and yellow is clear. So the robot can unstack yellow from red. Then put it down, but where? To put it on purple, maybe. But which purple? There's purple_block_1 and purple_block_2. Purple_block_2 is on purple_1. So, if I want to stack yellow on purple_block_1, I need to clear purple_block_1. But purple_block_2 is on top of purple_1. So first, I need to unstack purple_block_2 from purple_1, put it down, then stack yellow on purple_1.

But that's a lot of steps. Let's outline the steps needed:

1. To get yellow onto purple_1, first, unstack purple_block_2 from purple_1 (since purple_1 has purple_2 on it). But purple_2 is clear, so we can unstack it. So unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1, then putdown purple_block_2. Now purple_1 is clear. Then, unstack yellow from red, then stack yellow onto purple_1. But wait, after unstacking yellow from red, the robot is holding yellow. Then, to stack it on purple_1, which is clear. So stack yellow purple_1. Then, we can proceed to stack green on yellow, but yellow would now be on purple_1. 

But when do we hold green? The plan must have at least one state where the robot is holding green. Also, whenever the robot holds green, either at that state or after, yellow must be on purple_1. So the holding of green must happen either after yellow is on purple_1 or before, but if before, then in the subsequent steps, we have to move yellow to purple_1.

But let's see. The goal is green on yellow. But if we first move yellow to purple_1, then green can be stacked on yellow (which is on purple_1). But then the goal is achieved. But the initial goal is just green on yellow, regardless of where yellow is. Wait, no. The goal is "green_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1". So regardless of where yellow is. So if yellow is on red, but then moved to purple_1, then green can be on yellow in either position. But in the initial state, yellow is on red. So the goal is to have green on yellow, wherever yellow is. So the problem is that after moving yellow to purple_1, the green can be placed on it. But the constraint says that when you hold green, either at that state or later, yellow is on purple. So if I first move yellow to purple, then hold green and stack it, that's okay. But if I first hold green (without moving yellow), then I must later move yellow to purple.

So possible plans:

Option 1:

- Unstack yellow from red, put it on purple_1. Then, stack green on yellow. But to stack green on yellow, need to pick up green. So the steps would be:

1. Unstack purple_block_2 from purple_1 (so that purple_1 is clear)
2. Putdown purple_block_2
3. Unstack yellow from red (since yellow is clear)
4. Stack yellow on purple_1 (now yellow is on purple_1)
5. Pickup green (now holding green, and in this state, yellow is already on purple_1, satisfying the constraint)
6. Stack green on yellow (since yellow is clear)

But wait, after stacking yellow on purple_1, yellow is on top of purple_1 and is clear. So when we pick up green, the constraint requires that at that state (s) or after, yellow is on purple_1. Since in step 5, yellow is already on purple_1, that satisfies the constraint. So this plan would work.

But let's check the steps:

After step 4: yellow is on purple_1. Then step 5: pickup green. At this state, we are holding green, and yellow is on purple_1. So the constraint is satisfied. Then stack green on yellow.

But also, the initial purple_block_2 is on purple_1. So steps 1 and 2 are moving purple_2 to the table. Then steps 3 and 4 move yellow to purple_1. Then steps 5 and 6 move green to yellow.

But the initial state of purple_1 has purple_2 on it. So to move yellow to purple_1, we need to clear purple_1 first. Hence steps 1 and 2.

Is this the minimal plan? Let's count the steps: 6 actions. Let's see if there's a shorter way.

Alternative approach: What if instead of moving yellow to purple_1, we move purple_1 under yellow? Wait, yellow is on red. So to stack yellow on purple_1, we need to have purple_1 clear. But purple_1 has purple_2 on it. So steps 1 and 2 are necessary.

Alternatively, after moving purple_2, stack yellow on purple_1, then stack green on yellow. So yes, that's 6 steps.

But maybe there's a way to hold green first and then move yellow to purple_1 after. Let's see.

Another option:

1. Pickup green_block_1. But wait, can we? In the initial state, green is on the table and clear. So yes, if we pickup green, then we have to satisfy the constraint. At that moment, yellow is on red. So the constraint says that if we hold green, then either in that state or after, yellow must be on purple. So after picking up green, we need to make sure that at some point, yellow is moved to purple. But then, after holding green, we can put it down, then proceed to move yellow to purple, then pick up green again. But that would add steps. Let's try:

1. Pickup green (hold green; constraint requires that yellow is on purple in this state or later. Currently, yellow is on red. So after this, we need to move yellow to purple_1. So after step 1, we must do something to get yellow onto purple.

But if we hold green now, we can't do other actions until we put it down. So:

2. Putdown green (now green is back on the table. Then proceed to move purple_2, move yellow to purple_1. Then pick up green again and stack. But this adds more steps: steps 1 (pickup green), 2 (putdown), 3 (unstack purple_2), 4 (putdown), 5 (unstack yellow), 6 (stack yellow on purple_1), 7 (pickup green), 8 (stack green on yellow). That's 8 steps, which is longer than the previous 6. So the first approach is better.

Thus, the optimal plan is likely the first approach: 6 steps.

But let's check each action's preconditions.

Step 1: Unstack purple_block_2 from purple_1.

Check preconditions: purple_block_2 is on purple_1, purple_block_2 is clear (yes), robot not holding anything (yes). So unstack is allowed.

Step 2: Putdown purple_block_2. Because after unstacking, the robot is holding purple_block_2. So putdown is allowed.

Step 3: Unstack yellow from red_block_1.

Preconditions: yellow is on red, yellow is clear (yes), robot not holding anything (after step 2, putdown, so yes). So unstack.

Step 4: Stack yellow on purple_1.

Preconditions: holding yellow (yes), purple_1 is clear (after steps 1 and 2, purple_1 is clear). So stack.

After stacking, robot is empty.

Step 5: Pickup green_block_1.

Preconditions: green is on table and clear (yes), robot not holding anything (yes). So pickup.

Now, we are holding green. The constraint requires that in this state or later, yellow is on purple. In this state (after step 4), yellow is on purple_1. So condition satisfied.

Step 6: Stack green_block_1 on yellow_block_1.

Preconditions: holding green, yellow is clear (since after step 4, yellow is on purple_1 and has nothing on top). So stack green on yellow.

That's six actions, which should be optimal.

Let me verify if there's any shorter path. Suppose we can skip moving purple_2. But to stack yellow on purple_1, purple_1 must be clear. Initially, purple_1 has purple_2 on it. So we need to unstack purple_2 first. So steps 1 and 2 are necessary. Then steps 3-4 move yellow to purple_1. Then steps 5-6 move green. So total 6 steps.

Is there a way to combine some steps? For example, when moving purple_2, maybe stack it somewhere else to avoid putting it down. But where? Let's see.

Alternatively, after unstacking purple_2, maybe stack it on another block. But all other blocks are either on the table or have something on top. Let's check:

After step 1: unstack purple_2 from purple_1. Then, we need to put it somewhere. If we can stack it on another block that's clear. For example, stack purple_2 on green_block_1. But green is clear. So step 2: stack purple_2 green_block_1. Then, purple_2 is on green. But then, green is not clear, which would prevent us from picking it up later. So that's a problem. Because we need to pick up green in step 5. So stacking purple_2 on green would make green not clear, so step 5's pickup would fail. Therefore, putting purple_2 on the table is better.

Alternatively, stack purple_2 on another block that's not needed. For example, white_block_1 is on blue_block_1. If we stack purple_2 on white_block_1, but white is clear. So we can stack purple_2 on white_block_1. Then, white would have purple_2 on top. But then, when we need to move white_block_1 later? But in this problem, the goal only involves green and yellow. So maybe stacking purple_2 on white_block_1 would work. Let's see:

Step 1: unstack purple_2 purple_1.

Step 2: stack purple_2 white_block_1. Now, white_block_1 has purple_2 on top. But white was clear before. So after stacking, white is not clear. But in the initial state, white is on blue. So after stacking, white is still on blue, but has purple_2 on top. Then, when we need to unstack yellow from red (step 3), that's okay. Then stack yellow on purple_1 (step4). Then pickup green (step5) as before. Stack green on yellow (step6). So that's still 6 steps, but using stack instead of putdown. However, the problem is that when stacking purple_2 on white, we need white to be clear. Because the preconditions for stack are that you're holding the block to stack (purple_2), and the target block (white) is clear. In the initial state, white is clear. So step 2 would be allowed. Then, after step 2, white is not clear. But that's okay because we don't need to interact with white again. So this could save a step? Wait, no. Because step 2 would be stack instead of putdown, but it's still one action. So steps are the same number. So no difference in plan length.

But using stack instead of putdown might allow for other optimizations. Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe we can find a way to avoid moving purple_2. Suppose we want to stack yellow on purple_2 instead of purple_1. Then, we wouldn't need to move purple_2. Let's think:

The goal is to have green on yellow. So if we stack yellow on purple_2 (which is on purple_1), then yellow is on purple_2. Then, stack green on yellow. But the constraint says that when we hold green, yellow must be on purple (either purple_1 or purple_2). Since purple_2 is a block, but the problem refers to "purple_block_1" and "purple_block_2" as separate. The constraint is "yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1". So the constraint requires that yellow is on purple_block_1, not any purple block. So stacking yellow on purple_2 wouldn't satisfy the constraint. Therefore, the only way to satisfy the constraint is to have yellow on purple_block_1. So steps 1 and 2 are necessary to clear purple_1.

Thus, the initial plan of 6 steps is necessary.

Another check: is there a way to hold green before moving yellow to purple_1, but then move yellow to purple_1 afterward. For example:

1. Pickup green (hold it; then, since the constraint requires that in this state or later, yellow is on purple_1. So after this, we need to move yellow to purple_1. But we can't do that while holding green. So we have to put it down first.

So:

2. Putdown green.

3. Unstack purple_2 from purple_1.

4. Putdown purple_2.

5. Unstack yellow from red.

6. Stack yellow on purple_1.

7. Pickup green again.

8. Stack green on yellow.

That's 8 steps, which is longer. So the initial plan is better.

Therefore, the optimal plan is the six-step plan.

Now, let's write the plan step by step:

1. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
2. putdown purple_block_2
3. unstack yellow_block_1 red_block_1
4. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
5. pickup green_block_1
6. stack green_block_1 yellow_block_1

Each step checks the preconditions and effects. Also, the constraints are satisfied: in step 5, when holding green_block_1, yellow_block_1 is already on purple_block_1 (from step 4), so the constraint is satisfied.
