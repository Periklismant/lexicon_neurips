Okay, let's break this down. We need to end up holding brown_block_1. Brown_block_1 currently has white_block_1 on top of it. So, we need to move white_block_1 first. The constraint tells us that once brown_block_1 is not on the table, white_block_1 must not be clear and red_block_1 must not be on the table. This means we need to put white_block_1 on red_block_1.

Here's the plan:

```
```
unstack white_block_2 black_block_1
putdown white_block_2
unstack black_block_1 grey_block_1
putdown black_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 yellow_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1
stack white_block_1 red_block_1
pickup brown_block_1
```
