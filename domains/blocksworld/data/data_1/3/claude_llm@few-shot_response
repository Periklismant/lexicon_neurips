I'll solve this planning problem step by step.

First, let me analyze the initial state and goal:
- Initial state: brown_block_1 is on the table with white_block_1 on top of it
- Goal: holding brown_block_1

The constraints require:
1. At some point, brown_block_1 must not be on the table
2. If brown_block_1 is not on the table, then at that state or later, white_block_1 must not be clear AND red_block_1 must not be on the table

Let me plan the solution:
1. First, I need to unstack white_block_1 from brown_block_1
2. To satisfy the constraints, I need to place something on white_block_1 and move red_block_1 off the table
3. Then I can pick up brown_block_1

Here's the optimal plan:

```
unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1
stack white_block_1 red_block_1
pickup brown_block_1
```
