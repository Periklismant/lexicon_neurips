Okay, let me try to figure out how to get the robotic arm to hold the brown_block_1. So, the initial state has several blocks arranged in different stacks. Let's start by looking at where brown_block_1 is. The initial state says that brown_block_1 is on the table, and white_block_1 is on top of it. Also, white_block_1 is clear, so nothing is on top of it. 

My goal is to have the arm hold brown_block_1. But right now, there's a block (white_block_1) on top of it, which means brown_block_1 isn't clear. The pickup action requires the block to be clear and on the table. So before I can pick up brown_block_1, I need to remove the white_block_1 that's on top of it.

So first, I need to unstack white_block_1 from brown_block_1. To do that, the preconditions for unstack are: white_block_1 is on brown_block_1, white_block_1 is clear, and the arm is empty. All these are true because initially, the arm is not holding anything, white_block_1 is clear, and it's on top of brown_block_1. So unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1 should work.

After unstacking, the effects would be: white_block_1 is no longer on brown_block_1, brown_block_1 becomes clear, and the arm is now holding white_block_1. Then, I need to put down white_block_1 somewhere to free up the arm. Let's use putdown white_block_1. Now, brown_block_1 is on the table and clear, so I can pick it up with pickup brown_block_1. That should achieve the goal.

Wait, but let's check the steps again. After unstacking, the arm is holding white_block_1. Then putdown places it on the table. Then, since brown_block_1 is now clear and on the table, the arm can pick it up. So the plan would be:

1. unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1
2. putdown white_block_1
3. pickup brown_block_1

Is there a shorter way? Let's see. The initial stack is brown_block_1 has white_block_1 on top. To get to brown_block_1, you have to remove white_block_1. There's no other block on white_block_1, so you can just unstack it. Then put it down. Then pick up brown. That's three steps. I don't think you can do it in fewer steps because each action is necessary. You can't pickup brown_block_1 while it has a block on top. So yes, three steps. That seems optimal.
