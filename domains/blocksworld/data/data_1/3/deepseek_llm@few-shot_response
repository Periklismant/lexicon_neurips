To solve this planning problem, we need to find a sequence of actions that results in the robotic arm holding `brown_block_1` while satisfying the given constraints. Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

### Initial State:
- `brown_block_1` is on the table with `white_block_1` on top of it.
- `yellow_block_1` is on the table with `grey_block_1` on top of it, which in turn has `black_block_1` on top, and `white_block_2` on top of `black_block_1`.
- `red_block_1` is on the table and clear.
- The arm is not holding any block.

### Goal:
- The arm is holding `brown_block_1`.

### Constraints:
1. At some point, `brown_block_1` must not be on the table.
2. If `brown_block_1` is not on the table at some state, then either at that state or a subsequent state:
   - `white_block_1` must not be clear (i.e., there is a block on top of it).
   - `red_block_1` must not be on the table.

### Plan:
To achieve the goal, we need to pick up `brown_block_1`. However, `brown_block_1` has `white_block_1` on top of it, so we first need to clear `brown_block_1` by removing `white_block_1`. 

Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. **Unstack `white_block_1` from `brown_block_1`**: This clears `brown_block_1` and allows us to pick it up. After this action, `brown_block_1` is on the table and clear, and the arm is holding `white_block_1`.
   - Now, `brown_block_1` is not on the table (constraint 1 is satisfied at this state because `brown_block_1` is being held by the arm).
   - To satisfy constraint 2, we need to ensure that either at this state or a subsequent state:
     - `white_block_1` is not clear (but it is currently being held by the arm, so it is clear when placed down).
     - `red_block_1` is not on the table (we can achieve this by picking it up later).

2. **Putdown `white_block_1` on `red_block_1`**: This stacks `white_block_1` on `red_block_1`, making `white_block_1` not clear (since it is now under `white_block_1`) and `red_block_1` not on the table (since it now has `white_block_1` on top). This satisfies constraint 2.

3. **Pickup `brown_block_1`**: Now that `brown_block_1` is clear and on the table, we can pick it up to achieve the goal.

### Final Plan:
```
```
unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1
stack white_block_1 red_block_1
pickup brown_block_1
```
