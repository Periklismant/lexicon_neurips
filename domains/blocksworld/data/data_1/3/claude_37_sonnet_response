Let me break down the problem:

1. We have 7 blocks: brown_block_1, yellow_block_1, white_block_1, grey_block_1, black_block_1, red_block_1, white_block_2.

2. The initial state is:
   - brown_block_1 is on the table
   - yellow_block_1 is on the table
   - white_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
   - grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
   - black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
   - red_block_1 is on the table
   - white_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
   - white_block_1 is clear
   - red_block_1 is clear
   - white_block_2 is clear
   - hand is empty

This configuration looks like:
```
        white_block_2
           |
      black_block_1
           |
       grey_block_1           white_block_1         red_block_1
           |                      |                     
     yellow_block_1          brown_block_1
```

3. The goal is to have "you are holding brown_block_1."

4. Constraints:
   a. At some point, brown_block_1 must not be on the table.
   b. If brown_block_1 is not on the table, then both of the following must be true at that state or a later state:
      - white_block_1 is not clear (i.e., there's a block on top of white_block_1)
      - red_block_1 is not on the table

Let's trace through a plan:

First, to hold brown_block_1, we need to remove white_block_1 from on top of it. 

1. unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1
   After this, we have:
   - brown_block_1 is on the table
   - yellow_block_1 is on the table
   - white_block_1 is in hand
   - grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
   - black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
   - red_block_1 is on the table
   - white_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
   - brown_block_1 is clear
   - red_block_1 is clear
   - white_block_2 is clear
   - hand is holding white_block_1

2. Now, we need to place white_block_1 somewhere so we can pick up brown_block_1. One option is to stack white_block_1 on top of red_block_1, which would make red_block_1's state consistent with the constraint.
   
   stack white_block_1 red_block_1
   After this, we have:
   - brown_block_1 is on the table
   - yellow_block_1 is on the table
   - white_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
   - grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
   - black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
   - red_block_1 is on the table
   - white_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
   - brown_block_1 is clear
   - white_block_1 is clear
   - white_block_2 is clear
   - hand is empty

3. Now we can pick up brown_block_1.
   
   pickup brown_block_1
   After this, we have:
   - hand is holding brown_block_1
   - brown_block_1 is not on the table (satisfying constraint a)
   - yellow_block_1 is on the table
   - white_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
   - grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
   - black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
   - red_block_1 is on the table
   - white_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
   - white_block_1 is clear
   - white_block_2 is clear

Wait, at this point, we've satisfied the goal (holding brown_block_1), but the constraint says that when brown_block_1 is not on the table, white_block_1 should not be clear and red_block_1 should not be on the table. In our current state, white_block_1 is clear, which doesn't meet the constraint.

We need to revise our plan:

1. unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1
   After this, we have:
   - brown_block_1 is on the table
   - yellow_block_1 is on the table
   - white_block_1 is in hand
   - grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
   - black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
   - red_block_1 is on the table
   - white_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
   - brown_block_1 is clear
   - red_block_1 is clear
   - white_block_2 is clear
   - hand is holding white_block_1

2. Now, we need to place white_block_1 somewhere so we can pick up brown_block_1. 
   
   putdown white_block_1
   After this, we have:
   - brown_block_1 is on the table
   - yellow_block_1 is on the table
   - white_block_1 is on the table
   - grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
   - black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
   - red_block_1 is on the table
   - white_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
   - brown_block_1 is clear
   - white_block_1 is clear
   - red_block_1 is clear
   - white_block_2 is clear
   - hand is empty

3. We want to pick up red_block_1 to stack it somewhere, so it's no longer on the table.
   
   pickup red_block_1
   After this, we have:
   - brown_block_1 is on the table
   - yellow_block_1 is on the table
   - white_block_1 is on the table
   - grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
   - black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
   - red_block_1 is in hand
   - white_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
   - brown_block_1 is clear
   - white_block_1 is clear
   - white_block_2 is clear
   - hand is holding red_block_1

4. Stack red_block_1 on top of white_block_1.
   
   stack red_block_1 white_block_1
   After this, we have:
   - brown_block_1 is on the table
   - yellow_block_1 is on the table
   - white_block_1 is on the table
   - grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
   - black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
   - red_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
   - white_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
   - brown_block_1 is clear
   - red_block_1 is clear
   - white_block_2 is clear
   - hand is empty

5. Now we can pick up brown_block_1.
   
   pickup brown_block_1
   After this, we have:
   - hand is holding brown_block_1
   - brown_block_1 is not on the table (satisfying constraint a)
   - yellow_block_1 is on the table
   - white_block_1 is on the table
   - grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
   - black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
   - red_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
   - white_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
   - red_block_1 is clear
   - white_block_2 is clear

At this point, we've satisfied the goal (holding brown_block_1) and the constraint (brown_block_1 is not on the table, white_block_1 is not clear, and red_block_1 is not on the table).

Let me double-check the constraints one more time to ensure our solution is valid.

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'brown_block_1 is not on the table'"
   In our final state, brown_block_1 is in our hand, so it's not on the table. This constraint is satisfied.

2. "If expression 'brown_block_1 is not on the table' holds in some state s, then expression 'The following conditions are all true: "there is a block on top of white_block_1, i.e., white_block_1 is not clear", "red_block_1 is not on the table"' must hold at s or at some state after s"
   
   In our final state (where brown_block_1 is not on the table), we have:
   - red_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 (so white_block_1 is not clear)
   - red_block_1 is not on the table
   
   Both conditions of the second constraint are met. So, this constraint is also satisfied.

Therefore, our plan is valid:

1. unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1
2. putdown white_block_1
3. pickup red_block_1
4. stack red_block_1 white_block_1
5. pickup brown_block_1

Wait, it seems like I messed up in some detail. Let me reconsider the problem from scratch.

The initial state is:
- brown_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- red_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
- white_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is clear
- white_block_2 is clear
- hand is empty

This is what the configuration looks like:
```
        white_block_2
           |
      black_block_1
           |
       grey_block_1           white_block_1         red_block_1
           |                      |                     
     yellow_block_1          brown_block_1
```
Actually, in my original representation, white_block_1 should be on top of brown_block_1, not next to it. Let me fix the representation:
```
                            white_block_2
                               |
                          black_block_1
                               |
                           grey_block_1
                               |     
     white_block_1          yellow_block_1          red_block_1
          |                     
     brown_block_1          
```
Hmm, I'm still making an error. Let me just read the initial state again:

```
- brown_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- red_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
```

So the initial state should look like:
```
                white_block_2
                     |
                black_block_1
                     |
                grey_block_1        white_block_1      red_block_1
                     |                   |
                yellow_block_1      brown_block_1
```

Great, I think I've got the initial state right now.

Now, let's trace through the plan again:

1. unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1
   After this, we have:
   - brown_block_1 is on the table
   - yellow_block_1 is on the table
   - white_block_1 is in hand
   - grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
   - black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
   - red_block_1 is on the table
   - white_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
   - brown_block_1 is clear
   - red_block_1 is clear
   - white_block_2 is clear
   - hand is holding white_block_1

2. Now, we need to place white_block_1 somewhere so we can pick up brown_block_1.
   
   stack white_block_1 red_block_1
   After this, we have:
   - brown_block_1 is on the table
   - yellow_block_1 is on the table
   - white_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
   - grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
   - black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
   - red_block_1 is on the table
   - white_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
   - brown_block_1 is clear
   - white_block_1 is clear
   - white_block_2 is clear
   - hand is empty

3. Now we can pick up brown_block_1.
   
   pickup brown_block_1
   After this, we have (as our final state):
   - hand is holding brown_block_1
   - brown_block_1 is not on the table
   - yellow_block_1 is on the table
   - white_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
   - grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
   - black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
   - red_block_1 is on the table
   - white_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
   - white_block_1 is clear
   - white_block_2 is clear

Wait, in the final state, we have white_block_1 is clear and red_block_1 is on the table, but this doesn't satisfy the constraint that says when brown_block_1 is not on the table, white_block_1 should not be clear and red_block_1 should not be on the table.

Let me think about this again. The constraint says:

"If expression 'brown_block_1 is not on the table' holds in some state s, then expression 'The following conditions are all true: "there is a block on top of white_block_1, i.e., white_block_1 is not clear", "red_block_1 is not on the table"' must hold at s or at some state after s"

This means that once brown_block_1 is not on the table, at that state or in some future state, both conditions (white_block_1 not clear and red_block_1 not on the table) must be true.

So, the idea is to remove white_block_1 from brown_block_1, place it somewhere (like the table), and then pick up red_block_1 and place it on top of white_block_1. After that, we can pick up brown_block_1. This seems reasonable.

Let me trace it again:

1. unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1
   After this, we have:
   - brown_block_1 is on the table
   - yellow_block_1 is on the table
   - hand is holding white_block_1
   - grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
   - black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
   - red_block_1 is on the table
   - white_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
   - brown_block_1 is clear
   - red_block_1 is clear
   - white_block_2 is clear

2. putdown white_block_1
   After this, we have:
   - brown_block_1 is on the table
   - yellow_block_1 is on the table
   - white_block_1 is on the table
   - grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
   - black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
   - red_block_1 is on the table
   - white_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
   - brown_block_1 is clear
   - white_block_1 is clear
   - red_block_1 is clear
   - white_block_2 is clear
   - hand is empty

3. pickup red_block_1
   After this, we have:
   - brown_block_1 is on the table
   - yellow_block_1 is on the table
   - white_block_1 is on the table
   - grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
   - black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
   - hand is holding red_block_1
   - white_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
   - brown_block_1 is clear
   - white_block_1 is clear
   - white_block_2 is clear

4. stack red_block_1 white_block_1
   After this, we have:
   - brown_block_1 is on the table
   - yellow_block_1 is on the table
   - white_block_1 is on the table
   - grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
   - black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
   - red_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
   - white_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
   - brown_block_1 is clear
   - red_block_1 is clear
   - white_block_2 is clear
   - hand is empty

5. pickup brown_block_1
   After this, we have:
   - hand is holding brown_block_1
   - brown_block_1 is not on the table
   - yellow_block_1 is on the table
   - white_block_1 is on the table
   - grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
   - black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
   - red_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
   - white_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
   - red_block_1 is clear
   - white_block_2 is clear

Hmm, in our final state, we have:
- brown_block_1 is not on the table (it's in our hand)
- white_block_1 is not clear (because red_block_1 is on top of it)
- red_block_1 is not on the table (it's on top of white_block_1)

But I think I'm causing some confusion. The constraint says "if brown_block_1 is not on the table in state s, then the conditions (white_block_1 not clear and red_block_1 not on the table) must hold at s or at some state after s." 

Actually, reading the constraint again, the language of "at s or at some state after s" means that the conditions don't have to hold at the same time brown_block_1 is not on the table; they just need to hold at that time or later. In our plan, as soon as brown_block_1 is picked up (and is not on the table), the conditions already hold, so we're good.

Let me double-check again:

1. In state 5, after we execute "pickup brown_block_1", we have brown_block_1 not on the table (it's in our hand).
2. At the same time, we also have white_block_1 not clear (because red_block_1 is on top of it) and red_block_1 not on the table (it's on top of white_block_1).

So, the two conditions (white_block_1 not clear and red_block_1 not on the table) hold in the same state where brown_block_1 is not on the table.

Therefore, our constraint is satisfied. Our final plan is:

1. unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1
2. putdown white_block_1
3. pickup red_block_1
4. stack red_block_1 white_block_1
5. pickup brown_block_1

But wait, I think I've made a mistake on constraint 2. The constraint specifically says:

"If expression 'brown_block_1 is not on the table' holds in some state s, then expression 'The following conditions are all true: "there is a block on top of white_block_1, i.e., white_block_1 is not clear", "red_block_1 is not on the table"' must hold at s or at some state after s"

This means that if brown_block_1 is ever not on the table, then at that same time OR later, white_block_1 must not be clear and red_block_1 must not be on the table.

In our execution plan, we pick up brown_block_1 from the table, immediately satisfying the "not on the table" part of the condition. At that same time, we've already stackec red_block_1 on top of white_block_1, which means white_block_1 is not clear and red_block_1 is not on the table. So, the constraint is satisfied.

Let me trace through one more time to be 100% certain:

1. unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1
   After this, we have:
   - brown_block_1 is on the table
   - yellow_block_1 is on the table
   - hand is holding white_block_1
   - grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
   - black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
   - red_block_1 is on the table
   - white_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
   - brown_block_1 is clear
   - red_block_1 is clear
   - white_block_2 is clear

2. putdown white_block_1
   After this, we have:
   - brown_block_1 is on the table
   - yellow_block_1 is on the table
   - white_block_1 is on the table
   - grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
   - black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
   - red_block_1 is on the table
   - white_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
   - brown_block_1 is clear
   - white_block_1 is clear
   - red_block_1 is clear
   - white_block_2 is clear
   - hand is empty

3. pickup red_block_1
   After this, we have:
   - brown_block_1 is on the table
   - yellow_block_1 is on the table
   - white_block_1 is on the table
   - grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
   - black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
   - hand is holding red_block_1
   - white_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
   - brown_block_1 is clear
   - white_block_1 is clear
   - white_block_2 is clear

4. stack red_block_1 white_block_1
   After this, we have:
   - brown_block_1 is on the table
   - yellow_block_1 is on the table
   - white_block_1 is on the table
   - grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
   - black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
   - red_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
   - white_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
   - brown_block_1 is clear
   - red_block_1 is clear
   - white_block_2 is clear
   - hand is empty

5. pickup brown_block_1
   After this, we have:
   - hand is holding brown_block_1
   - brown_block_1 is not on the table
   - yellow_block_1 is on the table
   - white_block_1 is on the table
   - grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
   - black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
   - red_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
   - white_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
   - red_block_1 is clear
   - white_block_2 is clear

In step 5, we have:
- brown_block_1 is not on the table.
- There's a block on top of white_block_1 (red_block_1), so white_block_1 is not clear.
- red_block_1 is not on the table (it's on top of white_block_1).

Both the goal and the constraint are satisfied, so our plan seems valid and optimal (since it's just 5 steps).

Let's check again the goal and constraints:

Goal: "you are holding brown_block_1"
After step 5, we are holding brown_block_1, so the goal is satisfied.

Constraint 1: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'brown_block_1 is not on the table'"
After step 5, brown_block_1 is not on the table (it's in our hand), so this constraint is satisfied.

Constraint 2: "If expression 'brown_block_1 is not on the table' holds in some state s, then expression 'The following conditions are all true: "there is a block on top of white_block_1, i.e., white_block_1 is not clear", "red_block_1 is not on the table"' must hold at s or at some state after s"
After step 5, brown_block_1 is not on the table AND white_block_1 is not clear (because red_block_1 is on top of it) AND red_block_1 is not on the table (it's on top of white_block_1). So, this constraint is also satisfied.

Therefore, our plan is valid and optimal:

1. unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1
2. putdown white_block_1
3. pickup red_block_1
4. stack red_block_1 white_block_1
5. pickup brown_block_1
