Okay, let's break this down. We need to be holding black_block_3 at the end. black_block_3 is currently on brown_block_1. We also have a constraint that black_block_3 must not be on brown_block_1 at some point, and before that happens, we must be holding brown_block_2.

Here's the plan:

1.  Unstack grey_block_1 from green_block_1.
2.  Putdown grey_block_1.
3.  Unstack green_block_1 from brown_block_2.
4.  Putdown green_block_1.
5.  Pickup brown_block_2.
6.  Unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1.
7.  Putdown brown_block_2.
8.  Pickup black_block_3.

This plan satisfies all the conditions:

*   We end up holding black_block_3.
*   black_block_3 is not on brown_block_1 after step 6.
*   We are holding brown_block_2 in step 5, which is before black_block_3 is no longer on brown_block_1.
