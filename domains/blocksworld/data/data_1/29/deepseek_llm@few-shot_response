To solve this planning problem, we need to find a sequence of actions that results in the robotic arm holding `black_block_3` while satisfying the given constraints. Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

### Initial State:
- `brown_block_1` is on the table with `black_block_3` on top of it.
- `brown_block_2` is on the table with `green_block_1` on top of it, and `grey_block_1` on top of `green_block_1`.
- `black_block_1` is on the table with `black_block_2` on top of it.
- The arm is not holding any block.

### Goal:
- The arm is holding `black_block_3`.

### Constraints:
1. At some point, `black_block_3` must not be on top of `brown_block_1`.
2. Before `black_block_3` is not on top of `brown_block_1`, the arm must have held `brown_block_2`.

### Plan:
1. First, we need to satisfy the constraint that the arm must hold `brown_block_2` before `black_block_3` is not on top of `brown_block_1`. To do this, we'll pick up `brown_block_2` (after clearing the blocks on top of it).
2. Then, we'll put down `brown_block_2` to free the arm for other actions.
3. Next, we'll unstack `black_block_3` from `brown_block_1` (this satisfies the first constraint that `black_block_3` is not on top of `brown_block_1` at some point).
4. Finally, we'll have the arm holding `black_block_3`, which is our goal.

### Step-by-Step Actions:
1. **Unstack `grey_block_1` from `green_block_1`**: This clears `green_block_1` so we can pick up `brown_block_2`.
2. **Putdown `grey_block_1`**: Place `grey_block_1` on the table to free the arm.
3. **Unstack `green_block_1` from `brown_block_2`**: This clears `brown_block_2` so we can pick it up.
4. **Putdown `green_block_1`**: Place `green_block_1` on the table to free the arm.
5. **Pickup `brown_block_2`**: Now the arm is holding `brown_block_2`, satisfying the second constraint.
6. **Putdown `brown_block_2`**: Place `brown_block_2` back on the table to free the arm for other actions.
7. **Unstack `black_block_3` from `brown_block_1`**: Now `black_block_3` is not on top of `brown_block_1`, satisfying the first constraint, and the arm is holding `black_block_3`, which is our goal.

### Final Plan:
```
```
unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2
putdown green_block_1
pickup brown_block_2
putdown brown_block_2
unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1
```
