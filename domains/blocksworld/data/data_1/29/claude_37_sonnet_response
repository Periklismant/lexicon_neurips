Let's analyze this blocksworld problem step by step.

First, let's understand the initial state:
- brown_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_2 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2
- black_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
- black_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
- black_block_2 is clear
- black_block_3 is clear
- grey_block_1 is clear
- hand is empty

The goal is:
- we are holding black_block_3

The constraints are:
1. At some point, "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1" should be true
2. If "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1" ever becomes true, there must be an earlier state where "you are holding brown_block_2" is true

The second constraint means that we must pick up brown_block_2 before we remove black_block_3 from brown_block_1.

Let's think about how to approach this:

1. In the initial state, black_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1.
2. To achieve our goal of holding black_block_3, we need to unstack it from brown_block_1.
3. But before we can do that, due to constraint 2, we need to have held brown_block_2 at some point.
4. To pick up brown_block_2, we first need to clear it by removing green_block_1 and grey_block_1 from it.

So here's a plan:

1. Unstack grey_block_1 from green_block_1
2. Put down grey_block_1 on the table
3. Unstack green_block_1 from brown_block_2
4. Put down green_block_1 on the table
5. Pick up brown_block_2 from the table (to satisfy constraint 2)
6. Put down brown_block_2 on the table
7. Unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1

This plan should satisfy both constraints and achieve the goal. Let's verify:

- After step 6, "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1" is not yet true.
- After step 7, "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1" becomes true, and there was an earlier state (after step 5) where "you are holding brown_block_2" was true.
- The goal of holding black_block_3 is achieved after step 7.

Wait, I just realized I had a mistake in my logic. Let me rethink this.

After step 6, black_block_3 is still on top of brown_block_1. The condition "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1" becomes true in step 7 when we unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1. At this point, we satisfy constraint 1. For constraint 2, we need to have held brown_block_2 before this, which we did in step 5. So, we do satisfy both constraints.

Let's formalize each step and ensure it's consistent with the domain:

1. "unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1" -> hand holding grey_block_1, green_block_1 clear
2. "putdown grey_block_1" -> grey_block_1 on table and clear, hand empty
3. "unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2" -> hand holding green_block_1, brown_block_2 clear
4. "putdown green_block_1" -> green_block_1 on table and clear, hand empty
5. "pickup brown_block_2" -> hand holding brown_block_2
6. "putdown brown_block_2" -> brown_block_2 on table and clear, hand empty
7. "unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1" -> hand holding black_block_3, brown_block_1 clear

At this point, we've achieved our goal (hand holding black_block_3), and we've met the constraints (we picked up brown_block_2 before unstacking black_block_3).

Wait, I'm having a doubt. Let's think through this again.

I'm not sure I'm correctly interpreting constraint 2:
"If 'black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which 'you are holding brown_block_2' is true"

The way I interpret this is that we need to hold brown_block_2 before removing black_block_3 from brown_block_1. But it's possible there's another interpretation I'm missing.

If I'm understanding it right, then the steps I've outlined should work. Let's double-check each step and see if the preconditions are met.

#### Step 1: "unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1"
Preconditions:
- grey_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 ✓
- grey_block_1 is clear ✓
- hand is empty ✓

#### Step 2: "putdown grey_block_1"
Preconditions:
- hand is holding grey_block_1 ✓

#### Step 3: "unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2"
Preconditions:
- green_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2 ✓
- green_block_1 is clear ✓
- hand is empty ✓

#### Step 4: "putdown green_block_1"
Preconditions:
- hand is holding green_block_1 ✓

#### Step 5: "pickup brown_block_2"
Preconditions:
- brown_block_2 is on the table ✓
- brown_block_2 is clear ✓
- hand is empty ✓

#### Step 6: "putdown brown_block_2"
Preconditions:
- hand is holding brown_block_2 ✓

#### Step 7: "unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1"
Preconditions:
- black_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1 ✓
- black_block_3 is clear ✓
- hand is empty ✓

All the preconditions are met at each step, and the goals and constraints are satisfied at the end. So, the plan is valid.

Actually, I just realized, based on the constraints, we need at some point to have black_block_3 not on top of brown_block_1, and the way to achieve that is by unstaking black_block_3. But we need to pick up brown_block_2 before we do so. However, to pick up brown_block_2, we need to clear it by removing green_block_1 and grey_block_1. So let's rewrite the plan:

1. "unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1"
2. "putdown grey_block_1"  (grey_block_1 is now on the table)
3. "unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2"
4. "putdown green_block_1"  (green_block_1 is now on the table)
5. "pickup brown_block_2"  (This satisfies the condition for constraint 2)
6. "putdown brown_block_2"  (We don't actually need to do anything with brown_block_2)
7. "unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1"  (This satisfies constraint 1 and is the goal)

So this plan satisfies both constraints: we pick up brown_block_2 at step 5, and we have black_block_3 not on top of brown_block_1 after step 7. And we also achieve the goal of holding black_block_3 after step 7.

But, I'm not sure if this is the optimal (shortest) plan. Let me think again and see if there's a shorter way.

For the goal of holding black_block_3, we need to unstack it from brown_block_1. For constraint 2, we need to pick up brown_block_2 before unstacking black_block_3 from brown_block_1. But to pick up brown_block_2, we need to clear it by removing green_block_1 and grey_block_1.

That seems to give us a minimum of 7 steps, as outlined above. I don't see a way to reduce the number of steps further while still satisfying the constraints.

But let me check again by analyzing the problem statement more carefully. Maybe I'm missing something.

Constraint 1: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1"
Constraint 2: "If expression black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1 holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: you are holding brown_block_2"

So, for the goal, we need to unstack black_block_3, which will satisfy constraint 1. And before doing that, we need to have held brown_block_2 (constraint 2).

Actually, I think I was overthinking this. We just need to hold brown_block_2 before we unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1. The plan I've outlined above does exactly that. It's the minimum set of steps, and it satisfies all the given constraints.

1. "unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1"
2. "putdown grey_block_1"  (grey_block_1 is now on the table)
3. "unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2"
4. "putdown green_block_1"  (green_block_1 is now on the table)
5. "pickup brown_block_2"  (This satisfies the condition for constraint 2)
6. "putdown brown_block_2"  (To free the hand)
7. "unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1"  (This satisfies constraint 1 and is the goal)

This is a valid and optimal plan for the given problem.

Actually, let's double check. I realized we should check if we can accomplish the task with fewer steps. For example, maybe there's a way to satisfy constraint 2 without using steps to clear brown_block_2.

Looking at the initial state, brown_block_2 has green_block_1 on top of it, and green_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top of it. The only way to pick up brown_block_2 is to first remove both green_block_1 and grey_block_1 from it.

So, we indeed need the steps to clear brown_block_2 before we can pick it up.

Therefore, the 7-step plan I've outlined is the optimal solution for this problem.

Actually, to be extremely careful, let me review the effects of each action, to make sure that our plan satisfies the constraints and leads to the goal.

1. "unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1" -> We are holding grey_block_1, green_block_1 is clear, and grey_block_1 is no longer on top of green_block_1.
2. "putdown grey_block_1" -> Grey_block_1 is on the table and clear, and we're not holding any block.
3. "unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2" -> We are holding green_block_1, brown_block_2 is clear, and green_block_1 is no longer on top of brown_block_2.
4. "putdown green_block_1" -> Green_block_1 is on the table and clear, and we're not holding any block.
5. "pickup brown_block_2" -> We are holding brown_block_2, and brown_block_2 is not on the table.
6. "putdown brown_block_2" -> Brown_block_2 is on the table and clear, and we're not holding any block.
7. "unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1" -> We are holding black_block_3, brown_block_1 is clear, and black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1.

After these steps, we've satisfied constraint 1 (after step 7, black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1) and constraint 2 (we held brown_block_2 in step 5, before we had black_block_3 not on top of brown_block_1 in step 7). We've also achieved the goal of holding black_block_3.

Alright, our solution is:

1. "unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1"
2. "putdown grey_block_1"
3. "unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2"
4. "putdown green_block_1"
5. "pickup brown_block_2"
6. "putdown brown_block_2"
7. "unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1"

This gives us a 7-step solution for the problem.

I just want to make sure I didn't miss anything. 

The constraint is that "If expression black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1 holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: you are holding brown_block_2". We need to pick up brown_block_2 before we make "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1" true, which happens after we unstack black_block_3.

Everything checks out, and our solution is correct and optimal.
