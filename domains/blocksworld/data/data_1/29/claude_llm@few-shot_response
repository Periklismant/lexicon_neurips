I'll solve this planning problem step by step.

First, let me analyze the initial state and goal:
- Initial state: black_block_3 is on brown_block_1, and we're not holding any block
- Goal: hold black_block_3
- Constraints: 
  1. At some point, black_block_3 must not be on brown_block_1
  2. Before black_block_3 is removed from brown_block_1, we must have held brown_block_2

To hold black_block_3, I need to unstack it from brown_block_1. But before I can do that, I need to satisfy the constraint by holding brown_block_2 first. However, brown_block_2 has green_block_1 on it, which in turn has grey_block_1 on it.

Here's my plan:

```
unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2
putdown green_block_1
pickup brown_block_2
putdown brown_block_2
unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1
```

This plan:
1. First clears brown_block_2 by removing grey_block_1 and green_block_1
2. Picks up brown_block_2 (satisfying the constraint)
3. Puts down brown_block_2
4. Finally unstacks black_block_3 from brown_block_1 (satisfying both the constraint and the goal)
