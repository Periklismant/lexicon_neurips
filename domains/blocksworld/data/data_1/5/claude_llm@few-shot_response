I'll solve this planning problem step by step.

First, let me understand the goal and constraints:
- Goal: "you are holding yellow_block_2"
- Constraints: 
  1. "yellow_block_2 is not on the table" must be true at some point
  2. Before "yellow_block_2 is not on the table" becomes true, "you are holding red_block_2" must be true

Let me analyze the initial state:
- yellow_block_2 is on the table and clear
- red_block_2 is on the table with green_block_1 on top of it

To satisfy the constraints, I need to:
1. First pick up red_block_2 (but I need to unstack green_block_1 first)
2. Then make yellow_block_2 not be on the table (by picking it up or stacking something on it)
3. Finally end with holding yellow_block_2

Here's my plan:

```
unstack green_block_1 red_block_2
putdown green_block_1
pickup red_block_2
putdown red_block_2
pickup yellow_block_2
```

This plan:
1. First unstacks green_block_1 from red_block_2
2. Puts down green_block_1 to free the hand
3. Picks up red_block_2 (satisfying the second constraint)
4. Puts down red_block_2 to free the hand
5. Picks up yellow_block_2 (making it not on the table and satisfying the first constraint)
6. Ends with holding yellow_block_2 (achieving the goal)
