Okay, let's see. The goal is to have the robotic arm holding yellow_block_2. The initial state has yellow_block_2 on the table and clear, right? So I need to figure out the steps to pick it up.

First, check the preconditions for picking up yellow_block_2. The pickup action requires that the block is on the table, clear, and the arm is empty. Since yellow_block_2 is on the table and clear in the initial state, and the arm isn't holding anything, can I just do pickup yellow_block_2 directly?

Wait, the initial state says "there is no block on top of yellow_block_2", so it's clear. And it's on the table. And the arm is empty. So yes, the first action should be pickup yellow_block_2. That would achieve the goal in one step. But let me double-check if there's any other blocks on top of it. The initial state lists yellow_block_2 as being on the table and clear, so no. So the plan would just be to pick it up. That's the optimal plan, right? Only one action needed. I think that's correct. No other steps needed because the preconditions are already met. So the answer is just that single action.
