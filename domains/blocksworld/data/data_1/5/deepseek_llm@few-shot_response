To solve this planning problem, we need to achieve the goal of holding `yellow_block_2` while satisfying the given constraints. Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

### Constraints:
1. **Constraint 1**: At some point, `yellow_block_2` must not be on the table.
2. **Constraint 2**: If `yellow_block_2` is not on the table at some point, then there must have been an earlier state where you were holding `red_block_2`.

### Initial State:
- `red_block_1` is on the table with `purple_block_1` on top.
- `yellow_block_1`, `yellow_block_2`, `grey_block_1`, and `red_block_2` are on the table.
- `green_block_1` is on top of `red_block_2`.
- All blocks on the table are clear except `red_block_1` (has `purple_block_1` on top) and `red_block_2` (has `green_block_1` on top).
- The arm is not holding any block.

### Goal:
- You are holding `yellow_block_2`.

### Plan:
1. To satisfy Constraint 1, we need to move `yellow_block_2` from the table to another block at some point. However, since the goal is to hold `yellow_block_2`, we can directly pick it up from the table (which would make it not on the table while being held). But we must also satisfy Constraint 2, which requires that before `yellow_block_2` is not on the table, we must have held `red_block_2`.

2. To hold `red_block_2`, we first need to unstack `green_block_1` from `red_block_2` because `red_block_2` is not clear initially.

3. After holding `red_block_2`, we can put it down or stack it somewhere, but since the goal is to hold `yellow_block_2`, we can proceed to pick up `yellow_block_2` after holding `red_block_2`.

### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. **Unstack `green_block_1` from `red_block_2`**: This makes `red_block_2` clear and allows us to pick it up.
2. **Pickup `red_block_2`**: Now we are holding `red_block_2`, satisfying the condition for Constraint 2.
3. **Putdown `red_block_2`**: We don't need `red_block_2` anymore, so we can put it back on the table.
4. **Pickup `yellow_block_2`**: Now we are holding `yellow_block_2`, achieving the goal. At this point, `yellow_block_2` is not on the table (it's being held), and we previously held `red_block_2`, satisfying both constraints.

### Final Plan:
```
```
unstack green_block_1 red_block_2
pickup red_block_2
putdown red_block_2
pickup yellow_block_2
```
```
