Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to have the robotic arm holding yellow_block_2, and there are some constraints to satisfy. Let's break down the problem.

First, the initial state. Let me list out where each block is:

- red_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_1 on top of it. Purple_block_1 is clear.
- yellow_block_1 and yellow_block_2 are both on the table and clear.
- grey_block_1 is on the table and clear.
- red_block_2 is on the table with green_block_1 on top, and green_block_1 is clear.
- The arm is empty.

The goal is to be holding yellow_block_2. But there are constraints:

1. At some point, yellow_block_2 must not be on the table. So, we have to move it off the table, probably by stacking it somewhere or picking it up and putting it down again. Wait, but if we just pick it up and put it back, that would satisfy the constraint. But maybe the optimal plan would have to do that. Alternatively, perhaps stacking it on another block and then unstacking it again. Hmm.

2. The second constraint is that if yellow_block_2 is not on the table in any state, there must be an earlier state where the arm was holding red_block_2. So, we need to ensure that whenever yellow_block_2 is not on the table (which would happen when we pick it up, or stack it somewhere), there was a prior step where the arm held red_block_2.

Wait, the constraint is a conditional: if at any state yellow_block_2 is not on the table, then there must have been an earlier state where the arm held red_block_2. So, the earliest time when yellow_block_2 is not on the table would be when we pick it up. So before that, we need to have held red_block_2.

But in the initial state, red_block_2 is under green_block_1. To hold red_block_2, we need to unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2. Because red_block_2 is on the table, but green_block_1 is on top of it. So, to get red_block_2, first, we have to unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2. Wait, no: unstack is for picking up the top block. So to get red_block_2, which is under green_block_1, we can't pick it up directly because there's a block on top. So red_block_2 is not clear. Therefore, to make red_block_2 clear, we need to remove green_block_1 from it. So first, unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2. That would allow us to then pick up red_block_2.

Wait, but the action "pickup" requires that the block is on the table and clear. So red_block_2 is on the table, but it's not clear because green_block_1 is on top. Therefore, to pick up red_block_2, we need to first remove green_block_1. But green_block_1 is clear. So we can unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2. That would make red_block_2 clear. Then, we can pick up red_block_2.

But wait, the constraint says that whenever yellow_block_2 is not on the table, there must be an earlier state where the arm held red_block_2. So, if we first handle red_block_2, then later handle yellow_block_2, that would satisfy the constraint.

So the plan needs to include steps where:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2. This makes green_block_1 held, and red_block_2 clear.

2. Put down green_block_1 somewhere (maybe on the table) so that the arm is free.

3. Pick up red_block_2 (since it's now clear and on the table). Then put it down again (to satisfy that the arm held it earlier). But wait, the constraint says that in some state before yellow_block_2 is not on the table, the arm held red_block_2. So even if we just pick up red_block_2 and then put it down again, that would create a state where the arm held it. Then, later, when we pick up yellow_block_2, which would be not on the table, the prior step of holding red_block_2 is there.

But let's think: The earliest possible time when yellow_block_2 is not on the table is when we pick it up. So before that step, we need to have held red_block_2.

So the steps would be:

- Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2. (Now holding green_block_1)
- Putdown green_block_1. (Now arm is empty, red_block_2 is clear)
- Pickup red_block_2. (Now holding red_block_2)
- Putdown red_block_2. (Now arm is empty, red_block_2 is on table, clear)
- Then, pickup yellow_block_2. (Now holding yellow_block_2, which is the goal)

But wait, the goal is to have the arm holding yellow_block_2. So the last action would be to pickup yellow_block_2, and that's the goal. But according to the initial state, yellow_block_2 is on the table and clear, so we can just pick it up. But according to the constraints, we need to have held red_block_2 before.

Wait, but when we pick up yellow_block_2, that action's precondition is that the arm is empty. So in the steps above, after putting down red_block_2, the arm is empty. Then we can pick up yellow_block_2. But during the pickup, the yellow_block_2 is no longer on the table (since pickup's effect is that it's not on the table anymore). So in the state after the pickup, yellow_block_2 is not on the table. The constraint requires that in that case, there must have been an earlier state where the arm held red_block_2. Which in this plan, the step where we held red_block_2 is before the pickup of yellow_block_2. So that satisfies the constraint.

Additionally, the first constraint is that there's at least one state where yellow_block_2 is not on the table. That would be after the pickup, which is part of the plan.

So this plan would satisfy both constraints.

But wait, the problem is that the goal is to have the arm holding yellow_block_2, so the final action is pickup yellow_block_2, and that's the goal state. So the plan would end there. However, the constraints are satisfied.

But let's check the steps again:

1. unstack green_block_1 red_block_2: Now holding green_block_1, red_block_2 is clear.

2. putdown green_block_1: green_block_1 is on the table, arm empty.

3. pickup red_block_2: Now holding red_block_2, which is not on the table anymore.

4. putdown red_block_2: Now red_block_2 is back on the table, clear, arm empty.

5. pickup yellow_block_2: Now holding yellow_block_2, which is the goal.

In this plan, the step where yellow_block_2 is not on the table is step 5 (after pickup). The earlier steps where the arm held red_block_2 are steps 3 and 4. So step 3 (holding red_block_2) is before step 5 (yellow_block_2 not on table). Therefore, the constraints are satisfied.

But wait, the first constraint is that "yellow_block_2 is not on the table" must hold in at least one state. That's satisfied in step 5.

The second constraint is that if in any state yellow_block_2 is not on the table, then there must be an earlier state where the arm held red_block_2. In this case, the only state where yellow_block_2 is not on the table is step 5. The earlier state (step 3) is holding red_block_2. So that's satisfied.

But maybe there's a shorter plan. Let's see.

Alternative approach: Suppose we unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2, then put it down. Then pickup red_block_2, then put it down. Then pickup yellow_block_2. That's 5 steps. But maybe there's a way to avoid putting down red_block_2, but the goal is to hold yellow_block_2. Wait, but if after holding red_block_2, we put it down, then we can pick up yellow_block_2. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, what if instead of putting down red_block_2, we use it to stack yellow_block_2 on top of it. Then, after stacking, the arm is empty, and then we can unstack yellow_block_2 from red_block_2. But that would require more steps. Let's see:

1. unstack green_block_1 red_block_2.

2. putdown green_block_1.

3. pickup red_block_2. (Now holding red_block_2)

4. stack red_block_2 yellow_block_2. Wait, no. Wait, stack requires that the arm is holding the first block (red_block_2), and the second block (yellow_block_2) is clear. But yellow_block_2 is on the table and clear. So stacking red_block_2 on yellow_block_2 would place red_block_2 on yellow_block_2. Then, after that, yellow_block_2 is not on the table (since red_block_2 is on top of it? No, yellow_block_2 is on the table, and red_block_2 is stacked on it. So yellow_block_2 remains on the table. Wait, stacking a block on another block doesn't take the bottom block off the table. So stacking red_block_2 on yellow_block_2 would have red_block_2 on yellow_block_2, which is on the table. So after stacking, yellow_block_2 is still on the table, but now has red_block_2 on top. So in that case, yellow_block_2 is still on the table, but not clear. So the constraint that yellow_block_2 is not on the table is not satisfied here. So that approach doesn't help with the first constraint.

Alternatively, if we stack yellow_block_2 on another block. Let's see:

Suppose after holding red_block_2, we can stack yellow_block_2 on some other block. But to do that, we need to first pick up yellow_block_2. But if we pick up yellow_block_2, that's the goal. So maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps after holding red_block_2, we put it down, then pick up yellow_block_2. That's the initial plan.

Another idea: After unstacking green_block_1 and putting it down, we could then pickup red_block_2, and then immediately stack it somewhere else. But how would that help? Let's see:

1. unstack green_block_1 red_block_2.

2. putdown green_block_1.

3. pickup red_block_2.

4. stack red_block_2 yellow_block_1. Now, red_block_2 is on yellow_block_1, which is on the table. So yellow_block_2 is still on the table. Then, the arm is empty.

Now, the next step would be to pickup yellow_block_2, which is possible because it's on the table and clear. But then, when we pick it up, yellow_block_2 is not on the table, which triggers the constraint. The earlier step where we held red_block_2 is step 3. So this plan would have 4 steps: unstack, putdown, pickup red, stack red, then pickup yellow. Wait, but that's 5 actions: unstack green from red, putdown green, pickup red, stack red on yellow_block_1, then pickup yellow_block_2. So steps 1-5. But the original plan was 5 steps. So same length.

But maybe there's a way to avoid putting down red_block_2. For example, after holding red_block_2, could we stack it on another block, then unstack it again. But that would add steps. Not helpful.

Alternatively, could we hold red_block_2 and then put it down again. That's steps 3 and 4 in the original plan. But maybe we can skip putting it down if we can somehow use it directly. But since the goal is to hold yellow_block_2, we need to have the arm empty to pick it up. So after holding red_block_2, we have to put it down to free the arm for picking up yellow_block_2.

So the original plan of 5 steps seems necessary. Let's verify:

Another alternative: What if we unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2, then putdown green_block_1. Then pickup red_block_2 and put it down. Then pickup yellow_block_2. That's five steps. But maybe there's a way to combine some steps.

Wait, but in the initial state, green_block_1 is on red_block_2. So first, unstack green_block_1 red_block_2. Then, putdown green_block_1. Now, red_block_2 is clear. Then, pickup red_block_2 (step 3), putdown red_block_2 (step 4), then pickup yellow_block_2 (step5). So the steps are:

1. unstack green_block_1 red_block_2

2. putdown green_block_1

3. pickup red_block_2

4. putdown red_block_2

5. pickup yellow_block_2

That's 5 steps. Now, the constraints are satisfied. Because in step 5, yellow_block_2 is not on the table, and in step3, the arm was holding red_block_2, which is before step5. So this plan meets the constraints.

But is this the optimal? Let's see if there's a shorter way.

Wait, what if after step3 (holding red_block_2), instead of putting it down (step4), can we directly proceed to pickup yellow_block_2? No, because the arm is holding red_block_2 and can't pickup another block. So we need to put down red_block_2 first.

Alternatively, can we stack red_block_2 on another block, freeing the arm. For example:

After step3, stack red_block_2 on yellow_block_1. Then, the arm is free. Then, pickup yellow_block_2. That would be:

1. unstack green_block_1 red_block_2

2. putdown green_block_1

3. pickup red_block_2

4. stack red_block_2 yellow_block_1

5. pickup yellow_block_2

This is 5 steps as well. But in this case, when we pickup yellow_block_2 (step5), yellow_block_2 is not on the table. The prior step where the arm held red_block_2 is step3, which is before. So this also satisfies the constraints. The length is the same as the previous plan. So both plans are 5 steps.

But which one is better? Both have the same length. So either is acceptable.

But wait, the first plan (putdown red_block_2) requires that after putting down, red_block_2 is back on the table. The second plan (stacking it on yellow_block_1) leaves it there. But for the problem's goal, the final state just needs the arm to hold yellow_block_2. So both are acceptable.

However, the problem requires the plan to be optimal, i.e., the shortest possible. Both plans have 5 steps. So perhaps there's a way to do it in fewer steps.

Let me think again. Let's see.

Alternative approach: Do we need to handle green_block_1 at all? Because the constraints involve red_block_2 and yellow_block_2. The initial state has green_block_1 on red_block_2. So to hold red_block_2, we need to remove green_block_1. So that's unavoidable.

But what if instead of putting down green_block_1, we use it to stack somewhere else. For example, after unstacking green_block_1 from red_block_2, stack it on another block. But that would require another step, which might not help.

Alternatively, after unstacking green_block_1, we could put it down, which is necessary to free the arm to pick up red_block_2. So steps 1 and 2 are unavoidable.

Then, steps 3 and 4: pickup red_block_2 and put it down. Or stack it somewhere.

Alternatively, after step3 (holding red_block_2), can we stack it on itself? No. Can we stack it on another block that's clear. For example, grey_block_1 is clear. So stack red_block_2 on grey_block_1. Then, we can unstack it later. But that adds steps.

Alternatively, after stacking red_block_2 on grey_block_1, the arm is free. Then, we can pickup yellow_block_2. That's step4: stack red_block_2 grey_block_1, step5: pickup yellow_block_2. So total steps: unstack green, putdown green, pickup red, stack red grey, pickup yellow. 5 steps. Same as before.

So no improvement.

Wait, maybe there's a way to have fewer steps by combining actions.

Wait, what if after unstacking green_block_1 from red_block_2, we don't put it down but use it to stack on another block. Let's think:

1. unstack green_block_1 red_block_2 (arm holds green_block_1)

2. stack green_block_1 some_block. For example, stack green_block_1 on grey_block_1. But to stack, the target block (grey_block_1) must be clear. Which it is. So step2: stack green_block_1 grey_block_1. Now, grey_block_1 has green_block_1 on top. The arm is empty.

3. pickup red_block_2 (now possible because it's clear)

4. putdown red_block_2 (arm is empty again)

5. pickup yellow_block_2.

That's 5 steps. Same as before.

No improvement.

Alternative idea: After step1 (unstack green_block_1), instead of putting it down or stacking, can we use it to help in another way? For example, unstack green_block_1, then put it on yellow_block_2. Then, yellow_block_2 is not on the table? No, because stacking green_block_1 on yellow_block_2 would mean yellow_block_2 is under green_block_1, but still on the table. So the constraint that yellow_block_2 is not on the table isn't met. So that doesn't help.

Alternatively, stack green_block_1 on yellow_block_2. Then, yellow_block_2 is still on the table, but now has a block on top. So the constraint is not satisfied.

Hmm.

Alternatively, after unstacking green_block_1 and stacking it elsewhere, the arm is free to pick up red_block_2. Then, holding red_block_2 satisfies the constraint when we later pick up yellow_block_2. But the steps are still the same.

So, all possible approaches seem to require 5 steps. Let's confirm:

Another approach: Can we avoid putting down red_block_2? For example:

After unstacking green_block_1, put it down. Then pickup red_block_2, then stack red_block_2 on yellow_block_2. Then unstack red_block_2 from yellow_block_2, but that would require steps.

But stacking red_block_2 on yellow_block_2 would make yellow_block_2 not clear, but the arm is free. Then, to get yellow_block_2, we need to unstack red_block_2 from yellow_block_2, but that would require red_block_2 to be clear. But after stacking, red_block_2 is on yellow_block_2, so red_block_2 is clear. So we could unstack red_block_2 from yellow_block_2. But that adds steps. Let's see:

1. unstack green_block_1 red_block_2 (holding green)
2. putdown green_block_1
3. pickup red_block_2
4. stack red_block_2 yellow_block_2
5. unstack red_block_2 yellow_block_2 (holding red)
6. putdown red_block_2
7. pickup yellow_block_2

That's 7 steps, which is longer. So not optimal.

Therefore, the initial plan of 5 steps seems optimal.

But wait, another idea: Can we use the unstack action on yellow_block_2 if it's on the table? No, because unstack requires that the first block is on top of the second. If yellow_block_2 is on the table, we can't unstack it. So to get yellow_block_2 into the arm, we have to use pickup.

So the shortest path is indeed 5 steps.

But wait, what if we don't need to putdown red_block_2? Let's see:

After step3: pickup red_block_2, then immediately stack it somewhere else. For example, stack red_block_2 on grey_block_1. Then, the arm is free. Then pickup yellow_block_2. So steps:

1. unstack green_block_1 red_block_2
2. putdown green_block_1
3. pickup red_block_2
4. stack red_block_2 grey_block_1
5. pickup yellow_block_2

That's 5 steps. So same as previous plans. And satisfies the constraints.

In this plan, the step where yellow_block_2 is not on the table is step5. The arm held red_block_2 in step3. So this is valid.

But the final state is holding yellow_block_2, which is the goal. So this plan works and is also 5 steps.

So which plan is better? Both have the same number of steps. So either is acceptable.

But the problem says to provide an optimal plan, so as long as the plan is valid and has the minimal steps (5), either is okay.

But let's check if the initial plan (putdown red_block_2) is possible.

In the initial plan, after pickup red_block_2 (step3), we put it down (step4). Then pickup yellow_block_2. But when we putdown red_block_2, it's placed on the table, and becomes clear. Then, yellow_block_2 is clear and on the table, so we can pick it up.

Yes, that works.

In the alternative plan, after stacking red_block_2 on grey_block_1 (step4), the grey_block_1 is no longer clear. But that doesn't affect the rest of the plan.

So both plans are valid and same length.

Therefore, the answer can be either.

But let's write one of them.

Let's choose the stacking version, which might look more efficient, but in reality, both are same length.

Wait, but the problem says to provide an optimal plan, which is the same or shorter than any other valid plan. Since both plans are 5 steps, either is correct. However, perhaps there's a way to do it in fewer steps.

Wait, let me think again.

Is there a way to avoid puttingdown or stacking red_block_2 after picking it up? For example, after picking up red_block_2, can we putdown something else? No, because the arm is holding red_block_2.

Alternatively, after unstacking green_block_1 and putting it down, maybe pickup red_block_2, then stack it on yellow_block_2. Then, yellow_block_2 has red_block_2 on top. So yellow_block_2 is still on the table. Then, to get yellow_block_2, we need to unstack red_block_2 from it, but that requires red_block_2 to be clear. Which it is after stacking. So:

1. unstack green_block_1 red_block_2
2. putdown green_block_1
3. pickup red_block_2
4. stack red_block_2 yellow_block_2
5. unstack red_block_2 yellow_block_2 (now holding red_block_2)
6. putdown red_block_2
7. pickup yellow_block_2

This is 7 steps, which is longer. So not better.

Hmm. So back to the original plan. Seems like 5 steps is the minimum.

Another angle: The constraints require that when yellow_block_2 is not on the table, there must have been a previous state where the arm held red_block_2. So the earliest time the arm can hold red_block_2 is after unstacking green_block_1. So the steps must include holding red_block_2 before picking up yellow_block_2.

So the minimal steps would be:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2 (to make red_block_2 clear)
2. Putdown green_block_1 (to free the arm)
3. Pickup red_block_2 (now holding red_block_2)
4. Putdown red_block_2 (to free the arm)
5. Pickup yellow_block_2 (goal)

Alternatively, steps 3 and 4 could be replaced with stacking red_block_2 somewhere else. But steps remain the same.

Thus, the plan has to be 5 steps. I think that's the minimal.
