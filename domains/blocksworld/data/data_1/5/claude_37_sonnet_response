Let's break down the problem. In this Blocksworld problem, I have several blocks, and I need to get to a state where "I am holding yellow_block_2". Additionally, there are two constraints:
1. In at least one state, "yellow_block_2 is not on the table"
2. If "yellow_block_2 is not on the table" in some state, then earlier I must have been "holding red_block_2"

Let's think about the second constraint: if "yellow_block_2 is not on the table" at some point, then earlier I must have been "holding red_block_2." This means before I can move yellow_block_2 from the table, I need to have picked up red_block_2 at some point.

So I think a plan might look something like:
1. First make sure to hold red_block_2 at some point (to satisfy the second constraint)
2. Then, move yellow_block_2 off the table (satisfying the first constraint)
3. Finally, hold yellow_block_2 (satisfying the goal)

Now, let's look at the initial state of the world:
- red_block_1 is on the table, with purple_block_1 on top of it
- yellow_block_1, yellow_block_2, grey_block_1 are all on the table and clear
- red_block_2 is on the table, with green_block_1 on top of it
- I'm not holding anything

To hold red_block_2, I first need to remove green_block_1 from on top of it. Then I can pick up red_block_2. Then I need to put it down somewhere.

Next, I need to pick up yellow_block_2 and put it down on some other block (to satisfy the first constraint).

Then I can pick up yellow_block_2 again (satisfying the goal).

Let's formalize the plan:

1. unstack green_block_1 red_block_2
2. putdown green_block_1
3. pickup red_block_2
4. putdown red_block_2
5. pickup yellow_block_2
6. stack yellow_block_2 green_block_1
7. unstack yellow_block_2 green_block_1

Let me trace through this plan and see if it fits the constraints and goal.

Initial state:
- red_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_1 on top
- yellow_block_1, yellow_block_2, grey_block_1 are on the table and clear
- red_block_2 is on the table with green_block_1 on top
- I'm not holding anything

Action 1: unstack green_block_1 red_block_2
Preconditions: 
- green_block_1 is on top of red_block_2 (true)
- green_block_1 is clear (true)
- I'm not holding anything (true)

Effects after action 1:
- green_block_1 is not on top of red_block_2
- red_block_2 is clear
- I'm holding green_block_1

Action 2: putdown green_block_1
Preconditions:
- I'm holding green_block_1 (true)

Effects after action 2:
- green_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_1 is clear
- I'm not holding anything

Action 3: pickup red_block_2
Preconditions:
- red_block_2 is clear (true)
- red_block_2 is on the table (true)
- I'm not holding anything (true)

Effects after action 3:
- I'm holding red_block_2
- red_block_2 is not on the table

This satisfies the requirement that "I must have been holding red_block_2" at an earlier state.

Action 4: putdown red_block_2
Preconditions:
- I'm holding red_block_2 (true)

Effects after action 4:
- red_block_2 is on the table
- red_block_2 is clear
- I'm not holding anything

Action 5: pickup yellow_block_2
Preconditions:
- yellow_block_2 is clear (true)
- yellow_block_2 is on the table (true)
- I'm not holding anything (true)

Effects after action 5:
- I'm holding yellow_block_2
- yellow_block_2 is not on the table

Action 6: stack yellow_block_2 green_block_1
Preconditions:
- I'm holding yellow_block_2 (true)
- green_block_1 is clear (true)

Effects after action 6:
- yellow_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is clear
- green_block_1 is not clear
- I'm not holding anything

The state after action 6 has "yellow_block_2 is not on the table", satisfying the first constraint. And we previously held red_block_2, satisfying the second constraint's condition.

Action 7: unstack yellow_block_2 green_block_1
Preconditions:
- yellow_block_2 is on top of green_block_1 (true)
- yellow_block_2 is clear (true)
- I'm not holding anything (true)

Effects after action 7:
- yellow_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1
- green_block_1 is clear
- I'm holding yellow_block_2

This satisfies the goal of "I'm holding yellow_block_2"

So our final plan is:

1. unstack green_block_1 red_block_2
2. putdown green_block_1
3. pickup red_block_2
4. putdown red_block_2
5. pickup yellow_block_2
6. stack yellow_block_2 green_block_1
7. unstack yellow_block_2 green_block_1

Let me check if this plan is optimal (shortest valid plan).

Actually, I think the plan above is not optimal, since I put red_block_2 back on the table and then pick up yellow_block_2. This is essentially a detour.

Let's see if I can optimize it. Another approach might be:

1. unstack green_block_1 red_block_2
2. putdown green_block_1
3. pickup red_block_2
4. putdown red_block_2
5. pickup yellow_block_2

This satisfies the constraints too: I held red_block_2 at one point (step 3), and yellow_block_2 is not on the table in step 5. And after step 5, I'm holding yellow_block_2, which is the goal.

Wait, I think I misunderstood the problem. Let me review the constraints again.

First constraint: "yellow_block_2 is not on the table" must hold in at least one state.
Second constraint: If "yellow_block_2 is not on the table" in some state, then earlier I must have been "holding red_block_2."

It seems like I understood the constraints correctly. But upon further reflection, it seems like the plan:

1. unstack green_block_1 red_block_2
2. putdown green_block_1
3. pickup red_block_2
4. putdown red_block_2
5. pickup yellow_block_2

is optimal. 

Let me check if this plan meets all the requirements:

Initial state:
- red_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_1 on top
- yellow_block_1, yellow_block_2, grey_block_1 are on the table and clear
- red_block_2 is on the table with green_block_1 on top
- I'm not holding anything

Action 1: unstack green_block_1 red_block_2
Preconditions: 
- green_block_1 is on top of red_block_2 (true)
- green_block_1 is clear (true)
- I'm not holding anything (true)

Effects after action 1:
- green_block_1 is not on top of red_block_2
- red_block_2 is clear
- I'm holding green_block_1

Action 2: putdown green_block_1
Preconditions:
- I'm holding green_block_1 (true)

Effects after action 2:
- green_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_1 is clear
- I'm not holding anything

Action 3: pickup red_block_2
Preconditions:
- red_block_2 is clear (true)
- red_block_2 is on the table (true)
- I'm not holding anything (true)

Effects after action 3:
- I'm holding red_block_2
- red_block_2 is not on the table

This satisfies the requirement that "I must have been holding red_block_2" at an earlier state.

Action 4: putdown red_block_2
Preconditions:
- I'm holding red_block_2 (true)

Effects after action 4:
- red_block_2 is on the table
- red_block_2 is clear
- I'm not holding anything

Action 5: pickup yellow_block_2
Preconditions:
- yellow_block_2 is clear (true)
- yellow_block_2 is on the table (true)
- I'm not holding anything (true)

Effects after action 5:
- I'm holding yellow_block_2
- yellow_block_2 is not on the table

The state after action 5 satisfies both the first constraint ("yellow_block_2 is not on the table") and the goal ("I'm holding yellow_block_2"). And the second constraint is satisfied because we held red_block_2 earlier (step 3).

So the plan:

1. unstack green_block_1 red_block_2
2. putdown green_block_1
3. pickup red_block_2
4. putdown red_block_2
5. pickup yellow_block_2

is optimal and satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal.

Actually, I realize I've been thinking about the constraints incorrectly. The second constraint is: If "yellow_block_2 is not on the table" in some state, then earlier I must have been "holding red_block_2." So, for any state in which yellow_block_2 is not on the table, I must have held red_block_2 at an earlier point.

In the plan I provided, yellow_block_2 is not on the table after step 5 (since I'm holding it), and I held red_block_2 at step 3. So the constraint is satisfied.

Hmm, let me think about it again to make sure. The constraint says: "If expression 'yellow_block_2 is not on the table' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are holding red_block_2'". 

So, if at any point yellow_block_2 is not on the table, then at some earlier point I must have been holding red_block_2.

In the plan I proposed, yellow_block_2 is not on the table at step 5, because I'm holding it. And at step 3, I was holding red_block_2, which is earlier. So the constraint is satisfied.

Hmm wait, I think we can actually optimize the plan further. From the initial state, we can directly pick up red_block_2 by first unstacking green_block_1. Then we can put down red_block_2 and pick up yellow_block_2. But now that I think about it, we could also just pick up green_block_1, put it down, pick up red_block_2, put it down, and then pick up yellow_block_2. So our plan is:

1. unstack green_block_1 red_block_2
2. putdown green_block_1
3. pickup red_block_2
4. putdown red_block_2
5. pickup yellow_block_2

And I think this is optimal.

Actually, let's check to see if there is a constraint in the problem that requires yellow_block_2 to be already off the table before the goal state. If not, to reach the goal "I am holding yellow_block_2", we might have other optimal plans.

Hmm, I think there's a way to optimize this plan further. The first constraint says that there must be at least one state where "yellow_block_2 is not on the table", and the second constraint says that if this is the case, I must have been holding red_block_2 earlier. Interestingly, the goal also achieves the first constraint: when I'm holding yellow_block_2, by definition, it's not on the table. So, the most optimized plan to reach the goal while satisfying the constraints is:

1. unstack green_block_1 red_block_2
2. putdown green_block_1
3. pickup red_block_2
4. putdown red_block_2
5. pickup yellow_block_2

Yes, this is indeed my current plan, and I feel confident this is the most optimal plan. Let's verify once more:

The goal: "I am holding yellow_block_2".
Constraints:
1. In at least one state, "yellow_block_2 is not on the table".
2. If "yellow_block_2 is not on the table" in some state, then earlier I must have been "holding red_block_2".

In this plan, the goal is achieved after step 5. After step 5, yellow_block_2 is also not on the table (since I'm holding it), satisfying the first constraint. And I held red_block_2 at step 3, before yellow_block_2 was off the table, satisfying the second constraint.

So the optimal plan is:

1. unstack green_block_1 red_block_2
2. putdown green_block_1
3. pickup red_block_2
4. putdown red_block_2
5. pickup yellow_block_2
