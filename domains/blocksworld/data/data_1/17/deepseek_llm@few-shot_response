To solve this planning problem, we need to achieve the goal of making "yellow_block_1" clear (i.e., no block on top of it) while satisfying the given constraints. The current state shows that "purple_block_1" is on top of "yellow_block_1", so we need to remove "purple_block_1" from "yellow_block_1". 

### Constraints Analysis:
1. **Constraint 1**: "you are holding purple_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
2. **Constraint 2**: If "you are holding purple_block_1" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state where "black_block_2 is on the table".

### Current State:
- "blue_block_1" is on "black_block_1".
- "yellow_block_1" is on "blue_block_1".
- "purple_block_1" is on "yellow_block_1".
- "black_block_2" is on "red_block_1" (not on the table initially).
- "black_block_3" is on the table.
- The arm is empty.

### Goal:
- "yellow_block_1" is clear (no block on top of it).

### Steps:
1. To satisfy Constraint 2, we first need to make "black_block_2" be on the table. Currently, "black_block_2" is on "red_block_1", so we must unstack "black_block_2" from "red_block_1".
2. After "black_block_2" is on the table, we can proceed to unstack "purple_block_1" from "yellow_block_1" to satisfy Constraint 1 and achieve the goal.

### Plan:
```
```
unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
putdown black_block_2
unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
```
```

### Explanation:
1. **unstack black_block_2 red_block_1**: This action unstacks "black_block_2" from "red_block_1", making "black_block_2" held by the arm and "red_block_1" clear. This satisfies the precondition for Constraint 2 ("black_block_2 is on the table" in the next step).
2. **putdown black_block_2**: This puts "black_block_2" on the table, satisfying Constraint 2 ("black_block_2 is on the table").
3. **unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1**: This unstacks "purple_block_1" from "yellow_block_1", making "yellow_block_1" clear (goal achieved) and the arm holds "purple_block_1" (satisfying Constraint 1).

This plan is optimal as it achieves the goal in the minimum number of steps (3) while satisfying all constraints.
