Okay, let's see. I need to find a plan to make sure that yellow_block_1 is clear in the end. The initial state has purple_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1, so I need to remove that. Also, there are constraints: at some point, I must be holding purple_block_1, and whenever I'm holding it, there must have been a previous state where black_block_2 was on the table.

First, the goal is to have nothing on yellow_block_1. So, the purple_block_1 is currently on yellow_block_1. To clear yellow_block_1, I need to remove purple_block_1. That means I need to unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1. But unstack requires that purple_block_1 is clear (which it is), and that I'm not holding anything. Then, after unstacking, I would be holding purple_block_1, which satisfies the first constraint. But the second constraint says that if I'm holding purple_block_1, there must have been a prior state where black_block_2 was on the table. 

Looking at the initial state: black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1, which is on the table. So black_block_2 isn't on the table initially. So to satisfy the constraint, before I hold purple_block_1, I need to have black_block_2 on the table at some point. That means I need to move black_block_2 from red_block_1 to the table. 

So steps would be:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. But wait, can I do that? Let's check preconditions for unstack. To unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1, black_block_2 must be clear (it is, since initial state says black_block_2 is clear), and I'm not holding anything (which is true initially). So yes, unstack black_block_2 red_block_1. Then, after unstacking, I'm holding black_block_2. Then I need to put it down. So putdown black_block_2. Now black_block_2 is on the table. That satisfies the condition that in a prior state, black_block_2 was on the table before I hold purple_block_1.

Now, after that, I can proceed to unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1. But let's check the stack structure. Currently, the initial setup is:

- black_block_1 on table, blue_block_1 on black_block_1, yellow_block_1 on blue_block_1, purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1.

So to get to purple_block_1, I need to unstack it. But to do that, I need to make sure that purple_block_1 is clear (which it is), and I'm not holding anything. But after putting down black_block_2, I can go to pick up purple_block_1. Wait, no. Because to get to purple_block_1, which is on top of yellow_block_1, which is on blue_block_1, which is on black_block_1. So the current stack is black_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 -> purple_block_1. So to unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1, I need to make sure that yellow_block_1 is clear (which it is not, since purple is on it). Wait, no. The unstack action's preconditions are: b1 is on top of b2, b1 is clear, and not holding anything. Purple is on yellow, and purple is clear. So unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1 is possible. So after unstacking, I hold purple_block_1. Then, I can put it down somewhere else. But the goal is just to have yellow_block_1 clear, so once purple is removed, the goal is achieved. But perhaps I need to put purple_block_1 somewhere else, but the problem doesn't specify where, as long as yellow_block_1 is clear.

Wait, the goal is only that there's no block on yellow_block_1. So once purple is moved off, the goal is satisfied. So the plan would be:

- Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. Then putdown black_block_2. Now black_block_2 is on the table. Then, unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1. Then, putdown purple_block_1. That would make yellow_block_1 clear. But wait, after unstacking purple, you are holding it. To put it down, you can do putdown. But then the problem is solved. Let me check the constraints.

The constraint says that if in any state you are holding purple, then in an earlier state, black_block_2 was on the table. So when you unstack purple, you are holding it. So before that, the putdown of black_block_2 must have happened. So putting black_block_2 on the table before unstacking purple satisfies that. So the steps would be:

1. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
2. putdown black_block_2
3. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
4. putdown purple_block_1

But wait, after step 3, you are holding purple. Then step 4 puts it down. So the state where you're holding purple is step 3, and step 2 ensures that black_block_2 is on the table. So this satisfies the constraint. Then the goal is achieved because after step 3, purple is no longer on yellow. Wait, no. When you unstack purple from yellow, purple is in your hand, so yellow is clear. Then putting down purple doesn't affect that. So the goal is achieved after step 3. But the problem says the final goal is that yellow_block_1 is clear, which is true once you unstack purple. So the plan could be just steps 1-3? Wait, but after unstacking, you are holding purple. The problem doesn't say anything about needing to put it down. But the problem's goal is only about yellow_block_1 being clear, not about any other blocks. So maybe the plan can stop after step 3. Wait, but the problem says "bring about the goal of the problem while satisfying all constraints". So the final state needs to have yellow_block_1 clear. So after unstacking, purple is in the hand, so yellow is clear. But then the action putdown is needed to put purple somewhere, but that's optional for the goal. Wait, no. The goal is just that in the final state, yellow is clear. So if after step 3, you have purple in hand, then in the final state, yellow is clear. But the problem requires that the sequence of actions brings about the goal. So the final state after the last action must satisfy the goal. So if the last action is unstack, then in the state after that, yellow is clear, but you're holding purple. But the problem doesn't require that you are not holding anything, just that the goal is achieved. So maybe the plan can be shorter. However, the problem might require that the robotic arm is free (not holding anything) as part of the final state, but the problem statement doesn't specify that. The original problem's goal is only "there is no block on top of yellow_block_1", so the final state just needs that. So the plan could be:

1. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
2. putdown black_block_2
3. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1

But then, after step 3, the robotic arm is holding purple_block_1. But the goal is satisfied. However, perhaps the problem requires that the arm is not holding anything, but the problem statement does not mention that. The original problem's goal is only the yellow block being clear. So perhaps that's acceptable. However, in the Blocksworld, usually, the standard assumption is that the plan should end with the arm empty, but the problem here doesn't state that. So I need to check the problem's goal again. The goal is just that "there is no block on top of yellow_block_1". So even if the arm is holding purple_block_1, as long as yellow is clear, the goal is met. But perhaps the putdown is needed to complete the action sequence. Let me check the problem statement again. The problem says "bring about the goal of the problem while satisfying all constraints". The constraints are that in at least one state, you are holding purple, and whenever you hold purple, there was a prior state with black_block_2 on table. The first part is satisfied in step 3. The second part is satisfied by step 2. So the plan could be steps 1-3. However, in the initial state, the arm is empty, and after step 3, the arm is holding purple. But the problem doesn't require the arm to be empty. So perhaps that's acceptable. But maybe the problem expects the arm to be empty, but it's not specified. However, to make sure the plan is valid, perhaps it's better to putdown purple_block_1. Let's see: if I add step 4: putdown purple_block_1, then the final state has purple on the table, and yellow is clear. The constraints are still satisfied. But is this necessary? The problem says "valid plan that solves the planning problem, i.e., bringing about the goal of the problem while satisfying all constraints". So putting down the purple is optional. However, the plan needs to be optimal (shortest possible). So if the plan can end at step 3, it's shorter (3 steps) than 4 steps. But in step 3, the arm is holding the purple block. Does that affect anything? Since the problem doesn't say anything about the arm's state in the goal, it's acceptable. But in Blocksworld, sometimes the unstated assumption is that the arm is not holding anything, but since the problem doesn't specify that, maybe it's okay. However, some actions may not be allowed if preconditions aren't met. Wait, after step 3, the arm is holding purple, but the next action (if any) would need to be putdown or stack. But if the plan ends there, then it's okay. So the optimal plan would be 3 actions. But let's check the preconditions again.

Let me go through each action:

Step 1: unstack black_block_2 red_block_1. Preconditions: black_block_2 is on red_block_1 (yes), black_block_2 is clear (yes, initial state says black_block_2 is clear), and arm is empty (yes). So valid. After this, the arm is holding black_block_2. The effect is that black_block_2 is no longer on red_block_1, red_block_1 becomes clear.

Step 2: putdown black_block_2. Precondition: arm is holding black_block_2 (yes). So valid. After this, black_block_2 is on the table, clear. Arm is empty.

Step 3: unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1. Preconditions: purple is on yellow (yes), purple is clear (yes, initial state says purple is clear), arm is empty (yes, after step 2). So valid. After this, purple is in the arm, yellow is clear. The goal is achieved. The constraints are satisfied: in step 3, we are holding purple, and step 2 putdown black_block_2 which was on the table, so prior state where black_block_2 is on table exists. So this plan satisfies everything. The length is 3. Is there a shorter plan? Let's see. Maybe there's a way to avoid moving black_block_2. But according to the constraints, whenever we hold purple, there must have been a prior state where black_block_2 was on the table. So if the first action is to unstack purple, but then in that step, we're holding purple, but we need a prior state where black_block_2 was on the table. But initially, black_block_2 is on red_block_1, not on table. So we need to have an action that puts black_block_2 on the table before unstacking purple. So steps 1 and 2 are necessary. So the minimal plan must include those steps. Hence, 3 actions: unstack black_block_2, putdown, unstack purple. That's 3 steps. Putting down purple would be a fourth step but is unnecessary for the goal. So the optimal plan is 3 steps. So the plan would be:

```
unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
putdown black_block_2
unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
```

But wait, after unstacking purple_block_1, the yellow_block_1 is clear. So the goal is achieved. The constraints are satisfied. So this should be a valid plan. Let me verify again.

Constraints:
1. Must have a state where holding purple. Step 3 does that.
2. Whenever holding purple, prior state with black_block_2 on table. The prior state is step 2 (putdown black_block_2), which makes black_block_2 on table. Then step 3 is after that. So yes.

Yes, this plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal in 3 steps. Is there a shorter plan? Let's think. Suppose there's a way to unstack purple_block_1 first, but that's not possible unless we first put black_block_2 on the table. Because initially, black_block_2 is on red_block_1, not on table. So to satisfy the constraint that when you hold purple (step 3), there was a prior state where black_block_2 is on table. So you need to first move black_block_2 to table. So the steps are necessary. Hence, 3 steps is the minimal.
