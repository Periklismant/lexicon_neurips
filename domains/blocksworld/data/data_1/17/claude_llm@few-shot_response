I'll solve this planning problem step by step.

First, let me analyze the initial state and goal:

Initial state:
- Tower 1: black_block_1 (bottom), blue_block_1, yellow_block_1, purple_block_1 (top)
- Tower 2: red_block_1 (bottom), black_block_2 (top)
- Tower 3: black_block_3 (alone)
- All clear blocks: black_block_2, black_block_3, purple_block_1
- Arm is empty

Goal: yellow_block_1 is clear

Constraints:
1. At some point, I must be holding purple_block_1
2. Before holding purple_block_1, black_block_2 must be on the table

To make yellow_block_1 clear, I need to remove purple_block_1 from it.
To satisfy constraint 2, I need to put black_block_2 on the table before picking up purple_block_1.

Here's my plan:

```
unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
putdown black_block_2
unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
putdown purple_block_1
```

This plan:
1. Removes black_block_2 from red_block_1 and puts it on the table
2. Then removes purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1 and puts it on the table
3. Satisfies both constraints: black_block_2 is on the table before purple_block_1 is held
4. Achieves the goal of making yellow_block_1 clear
5. Is optimal (minimum number of actions needed)
