Let's start by analyzing the problem.

Initial state:
- black_block_1 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- black_block_3 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- black_block_2 is clear
- black_block_3 is clear
- purple_block_1 is clear
- The arm is not holding any block

The goal is to have yellow_block_1 be clear, which means there is no block on top of yellow_block_1.

Constraints:
1. At some point in the plan, we must hold purple_block_1
2. Before holding purple_block_1, black_block_2 must be on the table

Let's visualize the initial state:
```
    purple_block_1      black_block_2      black_block_3
    yellow_block_1      red_block_1
    blue_block_1
    black_block_1        table
```

And the goal state:
```
    yellow_block_1 (clear)
    ...
```

In the initial state, purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, so to make yellow_block_1 clear, we need to remove purple_block_1 from it.

Let's see if we can satisfy the constraints:
1. At some point, we need to hold purple_block_1. This is needed anyway to make yellow_block_1 clear.
2. Before we hold purple_block_1, black_block_2 must be on the table. In the initial state, black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1, so we need to move it to the table before we touch purple_block_1.

Now, let's plan our actions:

First, we need to put black_block_2 on the table. We can do this by:
1. unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1
2. putdown black_block_2

Then, we can handle purple_block_1 to make yellow_block_1 clear:
3. unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1
4. putdown purple_block_1 (or stack it on any clear block)

Let's check this plan:

1. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
   Preconditions:
   - black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1 ✓
   - black_block_2 is clear ✓
   - The arm is not holding any block ✓
   Effects:
   - black_block_2 is not on top of red_block_1
   - red_block_1 is clear
   - The arm is holding black_block_2

2. putdown black_block_2
   Preconditions:
   - The arm is holding black_block_2 ✓
   Effects:
   - black_block_2 is on the table
   - black_block_2 is clear
   - The arm is not holding any block

3. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
   Preconditions:
   - purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1 ✓
   - purple_block_1 is clear ✓
   - The arm is not holding any block ✓
   Effects:
   - purple_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1
   - yellow_block_1 is clear
   - The arm is holding purple_block_1

4. putdown purple_block_1
   Preconditions:
   - The arm is holding purple_block_1 ✓
   Effects:
   - purple_block_1 is on the table
   - purple_block_1 is clear
   - The arm is not holding any block

This plan should work! Let's sequence it out:

1. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
2. putdown black_block_2
3. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
4. putdown purple_block_1

This satisfies both the goal and the constraints. Let's double-check the constraints:

1. At some point in the plan, we hold purple_block_1. This happens after step 3.
2. Before holding purple_block_1, black_block_2 must be on the table. After step 2, black_block_2 is on the table, and we don't hold purple_block_1 until step 3. 

Yep, the constraints are satisfied. Let's check that the plan is actually optimal (that is, it uses the minimum number of steps).

To achieve the goal of making yellow_block_1 clear, we need to remove purple_block_1 from it, which requires at least two actions: unstack purple_block_1 and then we have to do something with it. The constraint 1 says we should have a step where we're holding purple_block_1, and that's satisfied just by unstacking it. The constraint 2 says we need to put black_block_2 on the table before holding purple_block_1, which requires two more actions: unstack black_block_2 and putdown black_block_2. So in total, we need at least 4 actions, which is the length of our plan. Thus, the plan is optimal.

So the final plan is:
1. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
2. putdown black_block_2
3. unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
4. putdown purple_block_1
