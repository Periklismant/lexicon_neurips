Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld problem. Hmm, the goal is to get white_block_1 onto the table. Let's see the initial state first.

So, looking at the initial setup: green_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top. Black_block_2 is on the table with white_block_1, then black_block_3, then black_block_4 stacked on top. Black_block_1 is clear on the table. The robot isn't holding anything.

The target is to have white_block_1 on the table. Right now, white_block_1 is under black_block_3 and black_block_4. So to get white_block_1 down, I need to unstack the blocks above it. That means first unstacking black_block_4 from black_block_3, then unstacking black_block_3 from white_block_1. Once those are removed, I can pick up white_block_1 and put it down. But wait, white_block_1 is on black_block_2. So after unstacking black_block_3 and black_block_4, white_block_1 is on black_block_2. So to get white_block_1 to the table, I need to unstack it from black_block_2. But since white_block_1 is under black_block_3 and black_block_4, those need to be moved first.

Wait, initial state says: black_block_4 is on top of black_block_3, which is on white_block_1, which is on black_block_2. So the stack is black_block_2 (on table) -> white_block_1 -> black_block_3 -> black_block_4. So to get white_block_1 to the table, I need to first remove black_block_4 and black_block_3. Let's break that down.

Starting with the arm empty. So first, unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3. Preconditions: black_block_4 is on black_block_3, both are clear, and the arm is empty. But in the initial state, black_block_4 is clear (since there's nothing on top of it). So we can do unstack black_block_4 black_block_3. That action would have the arm holding black_block_4, and black_block_3 becomes clear. Then, we can put down black_block_4. Then, unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1. Now, black_block_3 is clear. After unstacking, hold black_block_3, then put it down. Then, white_block_1 is clear, so we can unstack it from black_block_2. Wait, but white_block_1 is on black_block_2, which is on the table. So to move white_block_1, we can just pick it up if it's on the table. Wait, no. Wait, white_block_1 is on top of black_block_2. So to pick up white_block_1, we can't use pickup because it's on another block, not the table. So we have to unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2. But in the initial state, white_block_1 is under black_block_3 and 4, so after removing those, white_block_1 is clear. So after removing black_block_4 and 3, white_block_1 is on black_block_2. So then, we can unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2. Then put it down on the table. That would achieve the goal.

But wait, the constraints require that in at least one state, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, and the robot is holding black_block_1. So this condition must be true at some point in the plan. Hmm, so the plan needs to include a state where these two things are true. Let's see.

So how can we have green_block_1 on white_block_1? Initially, green_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top. So to put green_block_1 on white_block_1, we need to stack green_block_1 onto white_block_1. But for stacking, we need to have green_block_1 in hand and white_block_1 clear. Also, white_block_1 must be clear. But in the process of moving white_block_1 to the table, after we've unstuck it from black_block_2, we could perhaps stack green_block_1 onto it before putting it down. Wait, but the goal is white_block_1 on the table. So if we stack green_block_1 on white_block_1, then white_block_1 is under green_block_1. But the goal requires white_block_1 to be on the table, so that would not satisfy the goal. Therefore, perhaps the constraint needs to be met in an intermediate step, not in the final state.

So maybe after moving white_block_1 to the table, we can then pick up green_block_1 (after moving yellow_block_1 off it), and stack it on white_block_1, but then perhaps need to unstack it again. But that's complicating things. Alternatively, maybe during the process of moving white_block_1, we can stack green_block_1 onto it temporarily. Let's think.

Alternatively, the constraint requires that at some point in the plan, two things are true: green_block_1 is on white_block_1, and the robot is holding black_block_1. So perhaps we can arrange to have green_block_1 stacked on white_block_1, then pick up black_block_1. Let's see.

But how to do that. Let's outline the steps again. The main steps to achieve the goal are:

1. Remove black_block_4 from black_block_3.
2. Remove black_block_3 from white_block_1.
3. Remove white_block_1 from black_block_2 and put it on the table.

After step 3, white_block_1 is on the table. So the constraint must happen during these steps.

Wait, but after step 3, the goal is achieved. So perhaps the constraint must be met before the final action. So maybe during the process, we have to stack green_block_1 onto white_block_1 and have the arm hold black_block_1. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe after moving white_block_1 to the table, but before the plan ends, we can do some extra steps. For example, stack green_block_1 on white_block_1 (now on table) and then unstack it again, and also pick up black_block_1. But that would add unnecessary steps, making the plan longer. However, the problem requires the optimal plan (shortest possible). So perhaps the constraint can be integrated into the necessary steps.

Wait, let's think: The initial state has black_block_1 on the table and clear. So black_block_1 can be picked up at any time when the arm is empty. So maybe during the process of moving the blocks, we can pick up black_block_1 and stack green_block_1 onto white_block_1 at some point.

Let me outline a possible plan:

First, unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3.

Action: unstack black_block_4 black_block_3. Now holding black_block_4, black_block_3 is clear.

Then putdown black_block_4.

Action: putdown black_block_4. Now black_block_4 is on table, arm is empty.

Next, unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1.

Action: unstack black_block_3 white_block_1. Now holding black_block_3.

Putdown black_block_3.

Action: putdown black_block_3. Now black_block_3 is on table.

Now, white_block_1 is clear. So unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2.

Action: unstack white_block_1 black_block_2. Now holding white_block_1.

But the goal is to put white_block_1 on the table, so putdown.

Wait, but if we do putdown white_block_1, then the goal is achieved. But we need to have a state where green_block_1 is on white_block_1 and the arm is holding black_block_1. So perhaps before putting white_block_1 down, we can stack it with green_block_1. Wait, but the arm is holding white_block_1. To stack green_block_1 on white_block_1, the arm would need to hold green_block_1. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe after moving white_block_1 to the table, we can then pick up green_block_1 (but it has yellow_block_1 on top). So to pick up green_block_1, we need to unstack yellow_block_1 first.

Wait, initial state: yellow_block_1 is on green_block_1. So to pick up green_block_1, we need to unstack yellow_block_1. So:

After step where white_block_1 is on the table, but perhaps before putting it there, perhaps we need to do:

Wait, let's backtrack.

Alternative approach: After unstacking white_block_1 from black_block_2, we have white_block_1 in hand. Instead of putting it down immediately, maybe we can put it somewhere else, then do some steps to meet the constraint.

But the goal requires white_block_1 to be on the table, so it must end up there. Let's see.

Suppose after unstacking white_block_1 from black_block_2, we need to put it on the table. So:

Action: putdown white_block_1. Now it's on the table. Goal achieved.

But we need to meet the constraint. So maybe during the process, before putting white_block_1 down, we can do something else. But how?

Alternatively, after putting white_block_1 on the table, then we can stack green_block_1 on it, but then we have to unstack again. But that's extra steps.

Alternatively, maybe after unsticking white_block_1, instead of putting it down, we stack it onto green_block_1. Wait, but green_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on top. So green_block_1 is not clear. So we can't stack onto it. Hmm.

So, to stack something onto green_block_1, we first need to clear it by moving yellow_block_1. So, steps would be:

Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.

Then, putdown yellow_block_1.

Now, green_block_1 is clear and on table. Then, stack white_block_1 onto green_block_1. But wait, the arm is holding white_block_1. So stack white_block_1 green_block_1. Then, after that, the arm is empty, and white_block_1 is on green_block_1. Then, to get white_block_1 back to the table, we have to unstack it. But that's adding steps. However, this would create a state where green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1? Wait, no. Stacking white_block_1 onto green_block_1 would place white_block_1 on green_block_1. So green_block_1 is under white_block_1. The constraint says green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, which would require white_block_1 to be under green_block_1. So that's the opposite. So to satisfy the constraint, green_block_1 must be on top of white_block_1. So white_block_1 is under green_block_1. So how to achieve that?

So we need to have green_block_1 stacked on white_block_1. That requires that white_block_1 is clear and on the table or on a block. But initially, white_block_1 is under black_block_3 and 4, but after moving them, white_block_1 is on black_block_2. Once we move white_block_1 to the table, then it's on the table. So perhaps after that, we can stack green_block_1 on it. But then the goal requires white_block_1 to be on the table, which is already the case, but stacking green_block_1 on it would place it on top, which is allowed as long as the final state has white_block_1 on the table. Wait, no. The goal is "white_block_1 is on the table". If we stack green_block_1 on top of white_block_1, then white_block_1 is still on the table, but has green_block_1 on top. So that's allowed. Wait, no. Because the goal requires that white_block_1 is on the table. It doesn't say anything about other blocks on top. Wait, but the problem statement says the task is to bring about the situation where "white_block_1 is on the table". So even if there's a block on top, white_block_1 is still on the table. But the usual Blocksworld interpretation is that being on the table means that the block is directly on the table with nothing underneath. So perhaps the goal requires that white_block_1 is on the table and clear. But the problem statement just says "white_block_1 is on the table". So as per the problem description, the goal is satisfied as long as white_block_1 is on the table, regardless of other blocks on top. Wait, but in the initial state, white_block_1 is on black_block_2. So the goal is to get it to the table. So even if after putting it on the table, and then stacking another block on it, the goal is still achieved. So perhaps the constraint can be met after achieving the goal. However, the plan must include actions that result in the constraint being true at some state, possibly after the goal is achieved. But the problem requires to bring about the goal and satisfy the constraints. So the plan must end with the goal achieved, but the constraint can be met in any intermediate state.

So perhaps, after putting white_block_1 on the table, we can stack green_block_1 onto it, and also pick up black_block_1. But then the constraint is met in that state. Then, we can unstack green_block_1 from white_block_1 and put it back. But this adds steps. However, the problem requires the plan to be optimal, meaning the shortest possible. So adding steps would make it longer, which is not allowed. So we need to find a way to meet the constraint during the necessary steps.

Alternative approach: Let's see the constraints again. The constraint is that in at least one state, both conditions must hold: green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, and the arm is holding black_block_1. So perhaps during the process of moving blocks, we can arrange for these conditions to be true.

Let's think of when the arm is holding black_block_1. So when can that happen? Since black_block_1 is initially on the table and clear. So the arm can pick it up whenever it's empty. For example, after putting down some other block.

So here's an idea:

1. Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3. Now holding black_block_4. Put it down.

2. Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1. Now holding black_block_3. Put it down.

3. Now, white_block_1 is on black_block_2 and clear. Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2. Now holding white_block_1.

4. At this point, instead of putting white_block_1 down, perhaps we can stack it onto green_block_1. But wait, green_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on top. So green_block_1 is not clear. So we need to unstack yellow_block_1 first.

So, before step 4, we need to unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1. Let's adjust the steps:

3a. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1. Now holding yellow_block_1.

3b. Putdown yellow_block_1.

Now, green_block_1 is clear. Then:

4. Stack white_block_1 onto green_block_1. Now, white_block_1 is on green_block_1. The arm is empty.

But the goal requires white_block_1 to be on the table. So after this, we need to unstack white_block_1 from green_block_1 and put it down. So:

5. Unstack white_block_1 from green_block_1. Now holding white_block_1.

6. Putdown white_block_1. Now the goal is achieved.

But during step 4, we have white_block_1 on green_block_1, so green_block_1 is under white_block_1. But the constraint requires green_block_1 to be on top of white_block_1, which is the opposite. So that's not helpful.

Wait, the constraint is "green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1", which means white_block_1 is under green_block_1. So we need to stack green_block_1 on top of white_block_1.

But to do that, green_block_1 must be picked up. But initially, green_block_1 is under yellow_block_1. So to pick up green_block_1, we need to first unstack yellow_block_1.

So steps could be:

After step 3 (holding white_block_1 from black_block_2):

4. Putdown white_block_1. Now white_block_1 is on the table. Goal is achieved.

5. Now, to meet the constraint: Need to stack green_block_1 on white_block_1 and hold black_block_1. So:

5a. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.

5b. Putdown yellow_block_1.

5c. Pickup green_block_1 (now clear on table).

5d. Stack green_block_1 on white_block_1 (which is on table and clear).

5e. Now, green_block_1 is on white_block_1. Then, pickup black_block_1 (since it's on table and clear). Now, the arm is holding black_block_1, and green_block_1 is on white_block_1. This satisfies the constraint. Then, to return to the goal, we have to unstack green_block_1 from white_block_1 and put it back, but that would require additional steps. However, since the goal is already achieved (white_block_1 is on table), but the constraint just needs to be true in at least one state. So after step 5e, the constraint is met. But then, the plan would end here, but the goal is already achieved. Wait, no. After step 4, the goal is achieved. Steps 5a-5e are after the goal is achieved, but the problem states to bring about the goal, so the plan must end with the goal achieved, but during the steps, the constraint must be met. So the constraint can be met after the goal is achieved, as long as the goal remains achieved. However, stacking green_block_1 on white_block_1 would mean white_block_1 is still on the table (with green_block_1 on top). So the goal remains achieved. Then, perhaps the plan can end after step 5e. However, this would add steps after the goal is achieved, which might be unnecessary. Also, the problem requires an optimal plan, so the minimal number of steps. But this approach would require many steps beyond the necessary ones.

Alternative plan:

After unstacking white_block_1 from black_block_2, the arm is holding white_block_1. Now, instead of putting it down immediately, can we stack it somewhere else to meet the constraint?

For example:

After step 3 (holding white_block_1), we need to stack green_block_1 on white_block_1, but green_block_1 is under yellow_block_1. So first, unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1. Let's try:

3. Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2. Holding white_block_1.

4. Putdown white_block_1. Now it's on the table. Goal achieved.

5. Now, need to stack green_block_1 on it. So:

5a. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.

5b. Putdown yellow_block_1.

5c. Pickup green_block_1.

5d. Stack green_block_1 on white_block_1.

6. Now, pick up black_block_1. Action: pickup black_block_1.

At this point, the arm is holding black_block_1, and green_block_1 is on white_block_1. So the constraint is met. Then, putdown black_block_1 again to complete the plan. But this adds steps 5a-5d and 6. But the goal is already achieved at step 4. So the total steps would be:

1. unstack black_block_4 black_block_3

2. putdown black_block_4

3. unstack black_block_3 white_block_1

4. putdown black_block_3

5. unstack white_block_1 black_block_2

6. putdown white_block_1

7. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1

8. putdown yellow_block_1

9. pickup green_block_1

10. stack green_block_1 white_block_1

11. pickup black_block_1

12. putdown black_block_1

That's 12 steps. But the minimal plan without considering the constraint would be steps 1-6 (6 steps). So this approach adds 6 steps, which is not optimal. So we need a way to meet the constraint while minimizing steps.

Alternative idea: Use the steps where black_block_1 is being picked up and green_block_1 is stacked on white_block_1 during the necessary steps. For example, during the process of moving the blocks, we can pick up black_block_1 and stack green_block_1 on white_block_1.

Let me try to interleave the steps:

Original steps to achieve the goal:

1. unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3.

2. putdown black_block_4.

3. unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1.

4. putdown black_block_3.

5. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2.

6. putdown white_block_1. (goal achieved)

Now, to meet the constraint, we need to have green_block_1 on white_block_1 and the arm holding black_block_1 at some state. So perhaps after step 6, we can do:

7. unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.

8. putdown yellow_block_1.

9. pickup green_block_1.

10. stack green_block_1 white_block_1.

11. pickup black_block_1.

But then, the arm is holding black_block_1. Now, the constraint is met in step 11 (green_block_1 is on white_block_1 and holding black_block_1). Then, to finish, we need to putdown black_block_1. But this adds steps 7-11 and 12. Again, 6 steps added.

But the problem requires the optimal plan. So there must be a way to meet the constraint without adding too many steps. Let's see.

Alternative approach: After putting down white_block_1 (step 6), the goal is achieved. Then, the robot can do the following:

7. pickup black_block_1 (since it's on table and clear).

Now, the arm is holding black_block_1. Then, stack green_block_1 onto white_block_1. But green_block_1 is under yellow_block_1. So first, need to unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.

But the robot is holding black_block_1. So can't unstack yellow_block_1 until it puts down black_block_1.

So steps would be:

7. pickup black_block_1. Now holding it.

8. putdown black_block_1. Now arm is empty.

9. unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.

10. putdown yellow_block_1.

11. pickup green_block_1.

12. stack green_block_1 white_block_1.

13. pickup black_block_1.

Now, in step 13, the arm is holding black_block_1 and green_block_1 is on white_block_1. So constraint is met. Then, putdown black_block_1 again. But this adds 7 steps. Not optimal.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a way to interleave the necessary steps with the constraint steps. Let's think differently.

What if after step 5 (unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2), instead of putting it down immediately, we use it to satisfy the constraint.

So:

5. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2. Now holding white_block_1.

6. stack white_block_1 onto green_block_1. But green_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on top. So we can't stack anything on green_block_1 until yellow_block_1 is removed.

So, first, unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.

But the arm is holding white_block_1. So we need to put down white_block_1 first.

6. putdown white_block_1.

7. unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.

8. putdown yellow_block_1.

9. pickup green_block_1.

10. stack green_block_1 white_block_1. Now green_block_1 is on white_block_1.

11. pickup black_block_1. Now, the arm is holding black_block_1 and green_block_1 is on white_block_1. So constraint is met.

12. putdown black_block_1.

13. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_1.

14. putdown green_block_1.

15. pickup white_block_1.

16. putdown white_block_1.

This is way too many steps and not optimal.

Another angle: The constraint requires that at some state, two conditions are true: green_block_1 is on white_block_1, and the arm is holding black_block_1. So perhaps these two can happen in different steps, but overlapping. For example, during the process of stacking green_block_1 on white_block_1, the arm may be holding green_block_1, and then later pick up black_block_1. But the two conditions need to be true at the same time.

So, in a single state, both must hold. So the arm must be holding black_block_1 while green_block_1 is on white_block_1.

So perhaps after stacking green_block_1 on white_block_1, the arm is empty. Then, the arm picks up black_block_1. At that moment, green_block_1 is on white_block_1 and the arm is holding black_block_1. That would satisfy the constraint.

So steps would be:

After achieving the goal (white_block_1 on table):

- Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.

- Putdown yellow_block_1.

- Pickup green_block_1.

- Stack green_block_1 on white_block_1.

- Pickup black_block_1.

Now, in the state after stacking green_block_1 on white_block_1 and before picking up black_block_1, green_block_1 is on white_block_1 and the arm is empty. Then, after pickup black_block_1, the arm is holding it. So the state after pickup is when the constraint is met.

So in this case, the steps would be:

1. unstack black_block_4 black_block_3

2. putdown black_block_4

3. unstack black_block_3 white_block_1

4. putdown black_block_3

5. unstack white_block_1 black_block_2

6. putdown white_block_1

7. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1

8. putdown yellow_block_1

9. pickup green_block_1

10. stack green_block_1 white_block_1

11. pickup black_block_1

12. putdown black_block_1

This results in the goal achieved (step 6) and the constraint met in step 11. But this adds 6 steps after achieving the goal, which is not optimal. The minimal plan would be 6 steps, but this is 12 steps, which is not optimal.

So perhaps there's a smarter way to meet the constraint during the necessary steps.

Let me think: Maybe during the process of moving black_block_3 and 4, we can also manipulate green_block_1 and black_block_1.

For example:

After unstacking black_block_4 and putting it down, then unstack black_block_3 and put it down. Now, the arm is empty.

Then, instead of unstacking white_block_1, maybe pick up black_block_1, stack it somewhere, and then proceed.

Wait, but the goal requires white_block_1 to be on the table. So we can't avoid moving white_block_1.

Alternative idea: Use black_block_1 in the stack that we're building.

For example:

After unstacking black_block_3 from white_block_1 and putting it down, the arm is empty. Then, pick up black_block_1.

But why? Let's see:

Steps:

1. unstack black_block_4 black_block_3

2. putdown black_block_4

3. unstack black_block_3 white_block_1

4. putdown black_block_3

5. pickup black_block_1. Now holding black_block_1.

But then, to stack green_block_1 on white_block_1, we need to have the arm hold green_block_1, but currently holding black_block_1. So we need to put it down first.

6. putdown black_block_1.

7. unstack white_block_1 black_block_2.

8. putdown white_block_1. Goal achieved.

Then, proceed to stack green_block_1 on white_block_1 and pick up black_block_1 again. But this again adds steps.

Not helpful.

Alternatively, during the unstacking of black_block_3, after putting it down, we can pick up black_block_1, then use it in some way. But how?

Alternatively, during the unstacking of white_block_1, after picking it up, stack it onto black_block_1. But the arm is holding white_block_1. So stack white_block_1 black_block_1. But black_block_1 is clear. So that's possible. Then, white_block_1 is on black_block_1. But the goal requires white_block_1 to be on the table. So then we need to unstack it and put it down. But this would allow us to meet the constraint.

Wait, no. The constraint requires green_block_1 to be on white_block_1. So this approach doesn't help.

Hmm, this is challenging. Let's try to find a way to meet the constraint with minimal steps.

The constraint requires:

- green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1.

- The arm is holding black_block_1.

So, these two must be true at the same time.

To get green_block_1 on white_block_1, we need to:

1. Clear green_block_1 by removing yellow_block_1.

2. Clear white_block_1.

3. Stack green_block_1 on white_block_1.

Then, pick up black_block_1.

But when is white_block_1 clear? After moving the blocks on top of it (black_block_3 and 4) and moving white_block_1 itself.

Wait, if we stack green_block_1 on white_block_1 after moving white_block_1 to the table, then white_block_1 is on the table and clear. So steps:

After achieving the goal (white_block_1 on table), do:

- Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.

- Putdown yellow_block_1.

- Pickup green_block_1.

- Stack green_block_1 white_block_1.

- Pickup black_block_1.

At this point, the arm is holding black_block_1 and green_block_1 is on white_block_1. Constraint met.

Then, to put everything back, but since the goal is already achieved, maybe we can leave it there. However, the problem doesn't require other blocks to be in any particular state except white_block_1 on the table. So stacking green_block_1 on white_block_1 is allowed, as the goal is already met.

So the steps would be:

Original steps (6 steps) plus:

7. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1

8. putdown yellow_block_1

9. pickup green_block_1

10. stack green_block_1 white_block_1

11. pickup black_block_1

Then, perhaps putdown black_block_1 (step 12). But the plan can end here as the goal is achieved, but the problem requires the plan to end when the goal is achieved. However, steps 7-11 are after the goal is achieved. So is that allowed?

The problem states: "bring about the goal of the problem while satisfying all constraints." The constraints require that the condition holds in at least one state during the plan. So the plan can continue after the goal is achieved as long as the goal remains true. But stacking green_block_1 on white_block_1 after it's on the table would mean white_block_1 is still on the table. So the goal remains satisfied.

But this adds steps, making the plan longer. So for the optimal plan, we need to find a way to incorporate the constraint steps into the necessary steps to achieve the goal.

Wait, perhaps during the process of moving white_block_1, we can meet the constraint. For example:

After unstacking white_block_1 from black_block_2 (step 5), the arm is holding white_block_1. Instead of putting it down immediately, maybe we can stack it onto green_block_1. But green_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on top. So first, unstack yellow_block_1.

So:

5. unstack white_block_1 black_block_2. Hold white_block_1.

6. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1. Wait, can't do that while holding white_block_1. So need to put down white_block_1 first.

6. putdown white_block_1.

7. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1.

8. putdown yellow_block_1.

9. pickup green_block_1.

10. stack green_block_1 white_block_1.

11. pickup black_block_1.

Now, during step 11, the constraint is met. Then, we need to put white_block_1 back on the table. But white_block_1 is under green_block_1. So:

12. unstack green_block_1 white_block_1.

13. putdown green_block_1.

14. pickup white_block_1.

15. putdown white_block_1.

This results in the goal being achieved again. But this adds 10 steps, which is not optimal.

This is getting frustrating. Let's think again about the minimal steps required to achieve the goal and meet the constraint.

The minimal steps to achieve the goal are:

1. unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3.

2. putdown black_block_4.

3. unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1.

4. putdown black_block_3.

5. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2.

6. putdown white_block_1.

Now, the constraint must be met in at least one of these steps or during these steps.

But none of these steps involve green_block_1 or black_block_1. So the constraint is not met. So we need to add steps.

The challenge is to add the minimal number of steps to meet the constraint.

Perhaps after step 6, we can do:

7. pickup black_block_1. Now holding black_block_1.

8. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1. Can't do this while holding black_block_1. So putdown black_block_1.

9. putdown black_block_1.

10. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1.

11. putdown yellow_block_1.

12. pickup green_block_1.

13. stack green_block_1 white_block_1.

14. pickup black_block_1.

Now, at step 14, the arm is holding black_block_1 and green_block_1 is on white_block_1. Constraint met.

But this adds 8 steps. So total of 14 steps, which is not optimal.

Alternatively, during the initial steps, when the arm is empty after putting down a block, maybe we can pick up black_block_1 and stack it somewhere to meet the constraint.

But how?

After step 2 (putdown black_block_4), the arm is empty. Could we:

3. pickup black_block_1. Now holding it.

But then, unstacking black_block_3 from white_block_1 requires the arm to be empty. So can't do that while holding black_block_1. So putdown black_block_1.

4. putdown black_block_1.

5. unstack black_block_3 white_block_1.

This would add steps, but then later we can pick up black_block_1 again.

But this approach seems to add steps without meeting the constraint.

Another idea: When the arm is empty after step 4 (putdown black_block_3), perhaps pick up black_block_1 and do something with it.

Steps:

1. unstack B4 B3

2. putdown B4

3. unstack B3 W1

4. putdown B3

5. pickup B1 (black_block_1)

Now, holding B1. But to unstack W1 from B2, the arm must be empty. So can't proceed. So putdown B1.

6. putdown B1.

7. unstack W1 B2.

8. putdown W1. Goal achieved.

Now, to meet the constraint:

9. unstack Y1 G1.

10. putdown Y1.

11. pickup G1.

12. stack G1 W1.

13. pickup B1.

Now, constraint met. Steps 9-13. Total steps: 13.

Still too long.

Is there any way to meet the constraint without adding so many steps?

Wait, perhaps during the process of moving white_block_1, we can temporarily stack it on black_block_1, then unstack it. But this would require:

After step 5 (holding W1):

6. stack W1 B1. Now B1 has W1 on top. Then, to get W1 to the table, unstack W1 from B1.

But this adds steps. However, during the stacking of W1 on B1, B1 is under W1. Then, when unstacking, B1 is clear. But this allows us to meet the constraint?

No, because the constraint requires green_block_1 on W1. So this approach doesn't help.

Another angle: The constraint requires that green_block_1 is on W1 and the arm is holding B1. So, perhaps during the stacking of green_block_1 on W1, the arm is holding B1. But how?

To stack green_block_1 on W1, the arm must be holding green_block_1. So to meet the constraint, the arm must be holding B1 while green_block_1 is on W1. This can't happen during the same action. So the arm must have already stacked green_block_1 on W1, then pick up B1. So in the state after stacking, the arm is empty, then pick up B1. So that's two separate actions.

So the minimal steps to meet the constraint after achieving the goal would be:

- Unstack Y1 G1 (to clear G1).

- Putdown Y1.

- Pickup G1.

- Stack G1 W1.

- Pickup B1.

This is 5 steps added after achieving the goal. So total steps would be 11.

But is there a way to combine some of these steps with the main plan?

For example, after step 5 (holding W1), perhaps put it down, then unstack Y1 G1, etc.

But this still requires adding steps.

Alternatively, during the main plan, after unstacking W1 from B2 and putting it down, we can immediately unstack Y1 from G1, stack G1 on W1, and pick up B1. This would be steps 6-9.

But this adds steps 6-9, making the total 9 steps. But the minimal plan without constraints is 6 steps. So the optimal plan would need to have these steps in the minimal way.

But according to the problem statement, the plan must be optimal, i.e., the shortest possible. Therefore, there must be a way to meet the constraint within the necessary steps or with minimal additions.

Wait, perhaps the constraint can be met during the process of achieving the goal. For example, after unstacking W1 from B2, instead of putting it down, stack it on green_block_1. But to do that, green_block_1 must be clear. So unstack Y1 first.

So:

Original steps:

1. unstack B4 B3

2. putdown B4

3. unstack B3 W1

4. putdown B3

5. unstack W1 B2. Now holding W1.

6. unstack Y1 G1. Can't, because arm is holding W1.

So need to putdown W1 first.

6. putdown W1. Now, goal is achieved.

7. unstack Y1 G1.

8. putdown Y1.

9. pickup G1.

10. stack G1 W1.

11. pickup B1.

Now, steps 7-11 are after the goal is achieved, making the total steps 11. But perhaps during step 10, the arm is holding G1, then stacks it on W1. Then, step 11 picks up B1.

At step 11, the constraint is met: G1 is on W1 (stacked), and arm holds B1.

So this is the required state. Then, the plan can end here, even though there's an extra block on W1. But the goal is already achieved. So steps would be:

1. unstack B4 B3

2. putdown B4

3. unstack B3 W1

4. putdown B3

5. unstack W1 B2

6. putdown W1

7. unstack Y1 G1

8. putdown Y1

9. pickup G1

10. stack G1 W1

11. pickup B1

This is 11 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, what if after unstacking W1 from B2 (step 5), instead of putting it down, we use it in a way that satisfies the constraint.

But to stack G1 on W1, the arm must be holding G1, not W1.

So:

After step 5: holding W1.

6. putdown W1.

7. unstack Y1 G1.

8. putdown Y1.

9. pickup G1.

10. stack G1 W1.

11. pickup B1.

So steps 6-11 are added, total 11 steps.

Alternatively, is there a way to interleave steps?

For example, after step 5 (unstack W1 B2), the arm is holding W1.

Then, unstack Y1 G1. But can't do that while holding W1. So putdown W1 (step 6), then unstack Y1 G1 (step 7). Then proceed as before.

This doesn't save steps.

Alternatively, after step 4 (putdown B3), the arm is empty. Then, unstack Y1 G1.

But then:

5. unstack Y1 G1.

6. putdown Y1.

7. pickup G1.

8. stack G1 W1. But W1 is on B2, and there's B3 and B4 on top. No, W1 is on B2, but B3 and B4 have been moved.

Wait, after step 4, B3 is on the table, B4 is on the table. W1 is on B2, and B3 was previously on W1. After step 3 and 4, B3 is on table. So W1 is still on B2, with B3 and B4 moved. So after step 4, W1 is on B2, and clear (since B3 and B4 are on table). So to stack G1 on W1, W1 is still on B2. So after step 4, steps would be:

5. unstack Y1 G1.

6. putdown Y1.

7. pickup G1.

8. stack G1 W1. But W1 is on B2. So this would stack G1 on W1, which is on B2. Then, W1 is under G1. Then, to get W1 to the table, we'd need to unstack G1 from W1, then unstack W1 from B2.

But this complicates things. But let's see:

Steps:

1. unstack B4 B3

2. putdown B4

3. unstack B3 W1

4. putdown B3

5. unstack Y1 G1

6. putdown Y1

7. pickup G1

8. stack G1 W1 (W1 is on B2)

Now, G1 is on W1, which is on B2.

Then, we need to get W1 to the table. So:

9. unstack G1 W1. Now holding G1.

10. putdown G1.

11. unstack W1 B2. Now holding W1.

12. putdown W1. Goal achieved.

13. pickup B1. Now holding B1.

At this point, the constraint is met in step 8 (G1 on W1) and step 13 (arm holding B1). But these are separate steps, so the state where both are true is step 13, after step 8, but in step 13, G1 is not on W1 anymore. So this approach doesn't work.

This is really tricky. Maybe there's no way to meet the constraint without adding steps, but the problem requires the optimal plan. So perhaps the minimal plan is 11 steps as outlined earlier. But I need to confirm.

Alternatively, maybe during the main steps, after unstacking W1 from B2 and holding it, we can stack it on green_block_1. But that would require moving Y1 first. Let's try:

1. unstack B4 B3

2. putdown B4

3. unstack B3 W1

4. putdown B3

5. unstack Y1 G1

6. putdown Y1

7. pickup G1

8. stack G1 W1 (W1 is on B2)

But W1 is on B2, so stacking G1 on W1 is allowed. Then, G1 is on W1, W1 is on B2.

Then, unstack W1 from B2 (requires W1 to be clear, but G1 is on it. So can't do that. So this approach is invalid.

So that's not possible.

Another idea: During the unstacking of W1 from B2, after holding W1, we can stack it on green_block_1. But green_block_1 is under Y1. So we need to first unstack Y1.

But the arm is holding W1, so:

5. unstack W1 B2. Hold W1.

6. unstack Y1 G1. Can't, arm is holding W1.

So putdown W1 first.

6. putdown W1.

7. unstack Y1 G1.

8. putdown Y1.

9. pickup G1.

10. stack G1 W1.

11. pickup B1.

But this is the same as before, leading to 11 steps.

I think this is the minimal way. So the plan would be:

```
unstack black_block_4 black_block_3
putdown black_block_4
unstack black_block_3 white_block_1
putdown black_block_3
unstack white_block_1 black_block_2
putdown white_block_1
unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1
putdown yellow_block_1
pickup green_block_1
stack green_block_1 white_block_1
pickup black_block_1
```

After step 11 (pickup black_block_1), the constraint is met: green_block_1 is on white_block_1, and the arm is holding black_block_1. The goal is achieved at step 6 (putdown white_block_1). The remaining steps ensure the constraint is met. However, the problem requires the plan to end with the goal achieved. But steps after the goal is achieved are allowed as long as the goal remains satisfied. In this case, white_block_1 remains on the table with green_block_1 stacked on top. So the goal is still achieved. Thus, the total steps are 11. But maybe there's a shorter plan.

Wait, another thought: After step 6 (putdown white_block_1), the goal is achieved. Then, steps 7-11 can be done to meet the constraint. But the plan must end with the goal achieved, but it's allowed to have additional actions after the goal is achieved as long as they don't undo the goal. So the minimal plan would have 11 steps. But maybe there's a way to meet the constraint in fewer steps.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 5 (unstack white_block_1 from B2), instead of putting it down, use it to meet the constraint. For example:

After step 5 (holding W1):

6. unstack Y1 G1. Can't, arm is holding W1.

So putdown W1 (step 6), then unstack Y1 G1 (step7), putdown Y1 (step8), pickup G1 (step9), stack G1 W1 (step10), pickup B1 (step11). So steps 6-11 are added.

This is the same as before.

Alternatively, after step 5 (holding W1), can we stack it on B1 (which is on the table). Then:

6. stack W1 B1. Now W1 is on B1.

Then, unstack W1 from B1 to put it down. But then:

7. unstack W1 B1.

8. putdown W1. Now W1 is on the table. Goal achieved.

During this process, the arm is holding W1 and B1 is clear. But how does this help with the constraint? It doesn't involve green_block_1.

So this approach doesn't help.

I think the minimal way is to have 11 steps. But I'm not sure. Let's check again.

The original minimal steps to achieve the goal are 6. To meet the constraint, we need to perform additional steps:

7. unstack Y1 G1.

8. putdown Y1.

9. pickup G1.

10. stack G1 W1.

11. pickup B1.

Total steps: 11. However, perhaps the constraint can be met during these steps.

But the problem requires the plan to be optimal, meaning no other valid plan is shorter. So perhaps there's a way to meet the constraint in fewer steps.

Wait, another idea: When unstacking black_block_3 from white_block_1, after putting it down, the arm is empty. So perhaps after step 4 (putdown black_block_3), instead of moving to unstack white_block_1, we can first pick up black_block_1, then proceed.

But how does that help? Let's see:

After step 4:

5. pickup black_block_1. Now holding B1.

6. unstack white_block_1 B2. Can't, arm is holding B1. So need to putdown B1.

7. putdown B1.

8. unstack white_block_1 B2. Hold W1.

9. putdown W1. Goal achieved.

10. pickup B1. Now holding B1.

But then, we need to stack green_block_1 on W1.

11. unstack Y1 G1.

12. putdown Y1.

13. pickup G1.

14. stack G1 W1.

Now, in step 14, G1 is on W1 and arm is empty. Then, step 10 is holding B1. So the only state where both conditions are met is step 14 and step 10? No, because they are separate steps. So the arm is holding B1 in step 10, but G1 is not on W1 until step 14. So no state where both are true.

This approach doesn't work.

Another angle: During the unstacking of black_block_3 from white_block_1 (step3), after putting down B3 (step4), the arm is empty. Then, pick up B1 and stack it somewhere.

For example:

4. putdown B3.

5. pickup B1.

6. stack B1 B2. Now B1 is on B2.

7. unstack B1 B2. Now holding B1.

8. putdown B1.

But this doesn't help with the constraint.

Alternatively, stack B1 on green_block_1. But green_block_1 has Y1 on top.

So:

5. unstack Y1 G1.

6. putdown Y1.

7. pickup G1.

8. stack G1 B1.

9. unstack G1 B1.

10. putdown G1.

This is also not helpful.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. The only way to meet the constraint is to add the steps after achieving the goal, resulting in a total of 11 steps. But is there a way to do it in fewer steps?

Wait, another idea: When the arm is holding black_block_4 after step1, instead of putting it down, use it to stack on green_block_1. But how?

After step1: holding B4.

2. stack B4 green_block_1. But green_block_1 has Y1 on top. Can't.

So need to unstack Y1 first. But arm is holding B4. So putdown B4 first.

2. putdown B4.

3. unstack Y1 G1.

4. putdown Y1.

5. pickup B4.

6. stack B4 G1.

But this doesn't help with the constraint.

Alternatively, after unstacking B4, put it down, then unstack Y1 G1, stack G1 on B4.

But this also doesn't help.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the analysis, the minimal plan that meets the constraint requires 11 steps. However, maybe there's a shorter plan I'm missing.

Wait, another approach: Can the constraint be met during the process of unstacking B3 from W1?

Let's see:

Original steps:

1. unstack B4 B3

2. putdown B4

3. unstack B3 W1

4. putdown B3

5. unstack W1 B2

6. putdown W1

Then, after step6, white_block_1 is on the table. Then, the steps to meet the constraint:

7. unstack Y1 G1

8. putdown Y1

9. pickup G1

10. stack G1 W1

11. pickup B1

But during step 10, G1 is on W1. During step 11, arm is holding B1. So the state after step 11 meets the constraint. Then, the plan ends here.

This is 11 steps. But is there a way to combine steps 7-11 into fewer actions?

No, because each action requires specific preconditions. For example, unstacking Y1 from G1 requires the arm to be empty. So after step6, the arm is empty. So steps:

7. unstack Y1 G1.

8. putdown Y1.

9. pickup G1.

10. stack G1 W1.

11. pickup B1.

Each of these steps is necessary.

Alternatively, after step10 (stack G1 W1), the arm is empty. Then, pickup B1.

Yes, which is step11.

So this is the minimal steps to meet the constraint after achieving the goal.

Therefore, the optimal plan must include these steps. Thus, the final plan is:

```
unstack black_block_4 black_block_3
putdown black_block_4
unstack black_block_3 white_block_1
putdown black_block_3
unstack white_block_1 black_block_2
putdown white_block_1
unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1
putdown yellow_block_1
pickup green_block_1
stack green_block_1 white_block_1
pickup black_block_1
```

This plan has 11 steps. But the problem states that the plan must be optimal, i.e., the shortest possible. However, perhaps there's a way to interleave some steps.

Wait, after step5 (unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2), the arm is holding white_block_1. Then, step6 is putdown white_block_1. Then, the next steps are to unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1, which requires the arm to be empty. So steps are sequential.

Alternatively, after step5, instead of putting down white_block_1 immediately, use it to meet the constraint. But I don't see how.

Another idea: During step7 (unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1), after putting down yellow_block_1 (step8), pickup green_block_1 (step9), then stack green_block_1 on white_block_1 (step10), then pickup black_block_1 (step11). These steps are necessary.

Thus, I think this is the minimal plan, with 11 steps.
