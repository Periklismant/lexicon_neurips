I need to plan a sequence of actions to achieve the goal "white_block_1 is on the table" while satisfying the constraint that at some point "green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" and "you are holding black_block_1".

Let me analyze the initial state:
- white_block_1 is on top of black_block_2, with black_block_3 on top of white_block_1, and black_block_4 on top of black_block_3
- green_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top of it
- black_block_1 is on the table and clear

To achieve the goal and constraint, I need to:
1. Clear white_block_1 by removing blocks above it
2. Move white_block_1 to the table
3. At some point, have green_block_1 on top of white_block_1 while holding black_block_1

Here's my plan:

```
unstack black_block_4 black_block_3
putdown black_block_4
unstack black_block_3 white_block_1
putdown black_block_3
unstack white_block_1 black_block_2
putdown white_block_1
unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1
putdown yellow_block_1
pickup green_block_1
stack green_block_1 white_block_1
pickup black_block_1
putdown black_block_1
pickup green_block_1
putdown green_block_1
```
