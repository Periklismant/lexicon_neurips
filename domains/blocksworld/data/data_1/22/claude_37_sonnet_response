Let's break down this problem:

1. We have 7 blocks: green_block_1, black_block_1, black_block_2, yellow_block_1, white_block_1, black_block_3, black_block_4.
2. The initial configuration is:
   - green_block_1 is on the table
   - black_block_1 is on the table
   - black_block_2 is on the table
   - yellow_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
   - white_block_1 is on top of black_block_2
   - black_block_3 is on top of white_block_1
   - black_block_4 is on top of black_block_3
   - black_block_1, yellow_block_1, and black_block_4 are clear
   - The robot arm is not holding any block.

This initial configuration can be visualized as:
```
       black_block_4
       black_block_3
       white_block_1      yellow_block_1
       black_block_2      green_block_1     black_block_1
          table              table            table
```

3. The goal is to have white_block_1 on the table.
4. But there's a constraint: in at least one state during the execution, green_block_1 must be on top of white_block_1 while the robot arm is holding black_block_1.

Let's think about how to achieve this:

First, we need to get white_block_1 from its current position. It's currently under black_block_3, which is under black_block_4. So, we need to unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3, then unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1, then unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2, and finally put white_block_1 on the table. But we also need to satisfy the constraint.

For the constraint, we need to have green_block_1 on top of white_block_1 at some point, and at the same time, the robot arm should be holding black_block_1. Currently, green_block_1 is under yellow_block_1.

Let's plan out the sequence:

1. First, let's get white_block_1 on the table:
   - Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3
   - Putdown black_block_4 on the table
   - Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1
   - Putdown black_block_3 on the table
   - Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2
   - Putdown white_block_1 on the table

2. Now, white_block_1 is on the table (satisfying the goal). But we still need to satisfy the constraint. We need to get green_block_1 free and place it on top of white_block_1, and we need to have black_block_1 in the robot's hand.
   - Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
   - Putdown yellow_block_1 on the table
   - Pickup green_block_1 from the table
   - Stack green_block_1 on white_block_1
   - Pickup black_block_1 from the table

Now, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, and the robot is holding black_block_1, satisfying the constraint. And since white_block_1 is on the table, we've also achieved the goal.

Actually, let's double-check our plan to ensure it's valid:

1. Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3
   - Preconditions: black_block_4 is clear, black_block_4 is on top of black_block_3, robot isn't holding a block. ✓
   - Effects: The robot is holding black_block_4, black_block_3 is clear. ✓

2. Putdown black_block_4
   - Preconditions: The robot is holding black_block_4. ✓
   - Effects: black_block_4 is on the table, black_block_4 is clear, the robot isn't holding a block. ✓

3. Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1
   - Preconditions: black_block_3 is clear, black_block_3 is on top of white_block_1, robot isn't holding a block. ✓
   - Effects: The robot is holding black_block_3, white_block_1 is clear. ✓

4. Putdown black_block_3
   - Preconditions: The robot is holding black_block_3. ✓
   - Effects: black_block_3 is on the table, black_block_3 is clear, the robot isn't holding a block. ✓

5. Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2
   - Preconditions: white_block_1 is clear, white_block_1 is on top of black_block_2, robot isn't holding a block. ✓
   - Effects: The robot is holding white_block_1, black_block_2 is clear. ✓

6. Putdown white_block_1
   - Preconditions: The robot is holding white_block_1. ✓
   - Effects: white_block_1 is on the table, white_block_1 is clear, the robot isn't holding a block. ✓

7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
   - Preconditions: yellow_block_1 is clear, yellow_block_1 is on top of green_block_1, robot isn't holding a block. ✓
   - Effects: The robot is holding yellow_block_1, green_block_1 is clear. ✓

8. Putdown yellow_block_1
   - Preconditions: The robot is holding yellow_block_1. ✓
   - Effects: yellow_block_1 is on the table, yellow_block_1 is clear, the robot isn't holding a block. ✓

9. Pickup green_block_1 from the table
   - Preconditions: green_block_1 is clear, green_block_1 is on the table, robot isn't holding a block. ✓
   - Effects: The robot is holding green_block_1, green_block_1 is not on the table. ✓

10. Stack green_block_1 on white_block_1
    - Preconditions: The robot is holding green_block_1, white_block_1 is clear. ✓
    - Effects: green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, green_block_1 is clear, white_block_1 is not clear, the robot isn't holding a block. ✓

11. Pickup black_block_1 from the table
    - Preconditions: black_block_1 is clear, black_block_1 is on the table, robot isn't holding a block. ✓
    - Effects: The robot is holding black_block_1, black_block_1 is not on the table. ✓

At the end of this plan, white_block_1 is on the table (satisfying the goal), and at state 11, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and the robot is holding black_block_1 (satisfying the constraint).

But wait, there's an issue here.  When we Stacked green_block_1 on white_block_1 and then Pickup black_block_1, the white_block_1 would still be on the table.  If white_block_1 is on the table after green_block_1 is stacked on it, we achieve our goal. I think actually this is OK.

But let's double-check the goal. The goal is "white_block_1 is on the table". So, at the end of the plan, white_block_1 should be on the table, which it is. And the constraint is that at some point, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and the robot is holding black_block_1, which is satisfied after steps 10 and 11.

I think the plan is correct. It achieves the goal and satisfies the constraint.

Actually, let's consider if we could optimize the plan further. We want to minimize the number of steps.

Since the goal is just to have white_block_1 on the table, we can accomplish this in a more direct way:
1. Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3
2. Putdown black_block_4
3. Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1
4. Putdown black_block_3
5. Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2
6. Putdown white_block_1

But we also need to satisfy the constraint that at some point, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 while the robot is holding black_block_1. Given the initial arrangement, green_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top of it.

Thinking a bit more, if we just want to have white_block_1 on the table (as the goal) but also at some point have green_block_1 on top of white_block_1 and the robot holding black_block_1 (as the constraint), then the plan I outlined seems to be the shortest.

But actually, it seems I wasn't specifying the plan properly.

Here's the plan in the proper format:

```
unstack black_block_4 black_block_3
putdown black_block_4
unstack black_block_3 white_block_1
putdown black_block_3
unstack white_block_1 black_block_2
putdown white_block_1
unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1
putdown yellow_block_1
pickup green_block_1
stack green_block_1 white_block_1
pickup black_block_1
```

After this, the goal is achieved (white_block_1 is on the table) and the constraint is satisfied (at the last state, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and the robot is holding black_block_1).

Actually, let's go back to our plan once more. After Putdown white_block_1, white_block_1 is on the table. Our goal is to have white_block_1 on the table, so we've achieved the goal at this point. But the problem is, we also need to ensure the constraint (at some point, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and the robot is holding black_block_1) is satisfied.

Actually, let's consider a shorter plan:

1. Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3
2. Putdown black_block_4
3. Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1
4. Putdown black_block_3
5. Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2
6. Putdown white_block_1
7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
8. Putdown yellow_block_1
9. Pickup green_block_1
10. Stack green_block_1 white_block_1
11. Pickup black_block_1

At this point, white_block_1 is on the table (our goal), and green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 while the robot is holding black_block_1 (our constraint).

However, we can't just stop here. Once we pick up black_block_1, we can't just leave it in the robot's hand. We need to complete the plan by putting it down somewhere. But that doesn't necessarily make the plan shorter. And actually I think it's fine to end with the robot holding black_block_1.

Let's address another concern: are there any simpler ways to get green_block_1 on top of white_block_1 while the robot is holding black_block_1?

If we look at the initial configuration, green_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top of it, and white_block_1 is in a stack with other blocks. So, to get green_block_1 on top of white_block_1, we need to first unstack everything to get white_block_1 free, and then place green_block_1 on top of it. There's no simpler way.

Ok, let's rethink this from the beginning. the constraint is : "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "The following conditions are all true: "green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1", "you are holding black_block_1"". 

This means, at some point during the execution of the plan, green_block_1 should be on top of white_block_1 and the robot should be holding black_block_1. The goal is to have white_block_1 on the table, which should be the state at the end of the plan.

Given the initial state, we can see that green_block_1 is already on the table, which is a good starting point. But white_block_1 is part of a stack, so we need to free it.

Let's think about the plan step by step:

1. We first want to free white_block_1 from the stack it's in:
   - Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3
   - Putdown black_block_4
   - Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1
   - Putdown black_block_3
   - Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2
   - Putdown white_block_1

2. Then, we want to get yellow_block_1 off of green_block_1 so that we can use green_block_1:
   - Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
   - Putdown yellow_block_1

3. Now, we want to place green_block_1 on top of white_block_1, and then pick up black_block_1, satisfying the constraint:
   - Pickup green_block_1
   - Stack green_block_1 white_block_1
   - Pickup black_block_1

At this point, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, the robot is holding black_block_1, and white_block_1 is on the table. This satisfies both the constraint and the goal.

However, if we want to ensure that the robot is not holding any block at the end, we can add:
   - Putdown black_block_1

For completeness, I'll now write down the full plan step-by-step, without commentary:

```
unstack black_block_4 black_block_3
putdown black_block_4
unstack black_block_3 white_block_1
putdown black_block_3
unstack white_block_1 black_block_2
putdown white_block_1
unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1
putdown yellow_block_1
pickup green_block_1
stack green_block_1 white_block_1
pickup black_block_1
putdown black_block_1
```

Wait, I think I misunderstood the goal and the constraint:

- The goal is to have white_block_1 on the table.
- The constraint is that there should be at least one state during the execution of the plan where green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and the robot is holding black_block_1.

Given this understanding, it's possible that the planner is allowed to have a state where green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and the robot is holding black_block_1, but then to achieve the goal of having white_block_1 on the table, we might need to move green_block_1 off of white_block_1 at a later state.

I think my plan is still valid, though. If we have white_block_1 on the table and then place green_block_1 on top of it, white_block_1 is still on the table. So, the goal is satisfied.

Alright, here's our optimal plan:

```
unstack black_block_4 black_block_3
putdown black_block_4
unstack black_block_3 white_block_1
putdown black_block_3
unstack white_block_1 black_block_2
putdown white_block_1
unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1
putdown yellow_block_1
pickup green_block_1
stack green_block_1 white_block_1
pickup black_block_1
```

I believe this is the optimal plan for the given problem. It satisfies the goal at the end, and it also satisfies the constraint at some point during the execution.

Actually, I'm going to double-check the goal again. "The task is to bring about the following situation: white_block_1 is on the table". The goal wants for white_block_1 to be on the table. In our plan, we've got white_block_1 on the table after step 6. But we continue on to satisfy the constraint. However, after step 10, white_block_1 still has one block on top of it (green_block_1), so it's not clear to me. Let's reread the problem statement.

Okay, after rereading, I'm convinced that the goal is just for white_block_1 to be on the table. I got confused because when we say a block is on the table, we're saying that the table is directly supporting the block, not that the block is in a stack that's on the table.

But in the context of blocksworld, "white_block_1 is on the table" means that white_block_1 is directly on the table, regardless of what's on top of white_block_1. So, even if green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, as long as white_block_1 is directly on the table, the goal is satisfied.

so our plan should be good, we first get white_block_1 on the table, then stack green_block_1 on top of it, then pick up black_block_1:

```
unstack black_block_4 black_block_3
putdown black_block_4
unstack black_block_3 white_block_1
putdown black_block_3
unstack white_block_1 black_block_2
putdown white_block_1
unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1
putdown yellow_block_1
pickup green_block_1
stack green_block_1 white_block_1
pickup black_block_1
```
