Okay, let's break this down. We need to get white_block_1 on the table, and at some point, we need green_block_1 to be on top of white_block_1 while we are holding black_block_1.

Here's the plan:

1.  Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3.
2.  Putdown black_block_4.
3.  Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1.
4.  Putdown black_block_3.
5.  Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2.
6.  Putdown white_block_1.
7.  Pickup black_block_1.
8.  Pickup white_block_1.
9.  Stack green_block_1 white_block_1.
10. Putdown black_block_1.

```
```
unstack black_block_4 black_block_3
putdown black_block_4
unstack black_block_3 white_block_1
putdown black_block_3
unstack white_block_1 black_block_2
putdown white_block_1
pickup black_block_1
pickup green_block_1
stack green_block_1 white_block_1
putdown black_block_1
