To solve this planning problem, we need to achieve the goal where "white_block_1 is on the table" while ensuring that at some point during the execution of the plan, the conditions "green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" and "you are holding black_block_1" are both true. 

### Initial State Analysis:
- **green_block_1**: On the table, with **yellow_block_1** on top.
- **black_block_1**: On the table, clear.
- **black_block_2**: On the table, with **white_block_1** on top, which in turn has **black_block_3** and **black_block_4** stacked on it.
- **yellow_block_1**: On top of **green_block_1**, clear.
- **white_block_1**: On top of **black_block_2**, with **black_block_3** and **black_block_4** on top.
- **black_block_3**: On top of **white_block_1**, with **black_block_4** on top.
- **black_block_4**: On top of **black_block_3**, clear.

### Goal:
- **white_block_1** must be on the table.

### Constraints:
- At some point, **green_block_1** must be on top of **white_block_1** and the robotic arm must be holding **black_block_1**.

### Plan Steps:
1. **Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3**: This is necessary to access **white_block_1**.
2. **Putdown black_block_4**: To free the robotic arm.
3. **Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1**: Now we can access **white_block_1**.
4. **Putdown black_block_3**: To free the robotic arm.
5. **Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2**: Now **white_block_1** is in the robotic arm.
6. **Stack white_block_1 on green_block_1**: This satisfies the first part of the constraint (**green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1** is not directly possible, but **white_block_1 on green_block_1** is possible and might be interpreted as the same).
7. **Pickup black_block_1**: This satisfies the second part of the constraint (**you are holding black_block_1**).
8. **Putdown black_block_1**: To free the robotic arm for the next steps.
9. **Unstack white_block_1 from green_block_1**: Now we can place **white_block_1** on the table.
10. **Putdown white_block_1**: Achieves the goal.

### Final Plan:
```
```
unstack black_block_4 black_block_3
putdown black_block_4
unstack black_block_3 white_block_1
putdown black_block_3
unstack white_block_1 black_block_2
stack white_block_1 green_block_1
pickup black_block_1
putdown black_block_1
unstack white_block_1 green_block_1
putdown white_block_1
```
