I'll solve this planning problem step by step.

First, let me analyze the initial state:
- purple_block_1 is on the table with grey_block_1, brown_block_1, brown_block_2, and grey_block_2 stacked on top of it
- black_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_2 on top of it
- purple_block_2 and grey_block_2 are clear
- The arm is empty

The goal is to make black_block_1 clear, which means removing purple_block_2 from it.

The constraints are:
1. At some point, grey_block_1 must have a block on top of it
2. If grey_block_1 has a block on top, then grey_block_2 must be on top of black_block_1 at that state or later

In the initial state, grey_block_1 already has brown_block_1 on top, so the first constraint is satisfied. Now I need to ensure that grey_block_2 is placed on top of black_block_1 at some point.

Here's my plan:

```
unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_2
stack grey_block_2 black_block_1
unstack brown_block_2 brown_block_1
putdown brown_block_2
unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 purple_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
unstack purple_block_2 black_block_1
putdown purple_block_2
```

This plan:
1. Takes grey_block_2 and places it on black_block_1 (satisfying the second constraint)
2. Dismantles the stack on purple_block_1
3. Finally removes purple_block_2 from black_block_1, achieving the goal

The first constraint is satisfied because in the initial state, grey_block_1 has brown_block_1 on top of it. The second constraint is satisfied because we place grey_block_2 on top of black_block_1.
