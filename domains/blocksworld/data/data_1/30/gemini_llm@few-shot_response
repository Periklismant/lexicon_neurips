Okay, let's break this down. The goal is to have black_block_1 clear. Currently, purple_block_2 is on black_block_1. To achieve the goal, we need to remove purple_block_2 from black_block_1.

Here's the plan, keeping the constraints in mind:

1.  Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2.
2.  Putdown grey_block_2 onto the table.
3.  Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1.
4.  Putdown brown_block_2 onto the table.
5.  Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1.
6.  Putdown brown_block_1 onto the table.
7.  Unstack grey_block_1 from purple_block_1.
8.  Putdown grey_block_1 onto the table.
9.  Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1.
10. Stack grey_block_2 onto black_block_1. This satisfies the second constraint, since grey_block_1 is not clear at the previous state.
11. Putdown purple_block_2 onto the table.
