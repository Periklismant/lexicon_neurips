Let's break down the problem step by step to find an optimal plan that satisfies all the given conditions.

### Initial State:
- purple_block_1 is on the table.
- black_block_1 is on the table, with purple_block_2 on top of it (so black_block_1 is not clear).
- purple_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top, which in turn has brown_block_1, brown_block_2, and grey_block_2 stacked on top.
- purple_block_2 and grey_block_2 are clear (no blocks on top of them).
- The arm is not holding any block.

### Goal:
- black_block_1 is clear (no block on top of it).

### Constraints:
1. At some point, grey_block_1 must not be clear (i.e., there must be a block on top of grey_block_1).
2. If grey_block_1 is not clear at some state, then grey_block_2 must be on top of black_block_1 at that state or a later state.

### Plan:
To achieve the goal, we need to remove purple_block_2 from black_block_1. However, we must also satisfy the constraints. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. First, we need to unstack the tower on purple_block_1 to make grey_block_1 not clear (to satisfy the first constraint). This involves unstacking grey_block_2 from brown_block_2, then brown_block_2 from brown_block_1, and so on.
2. After grey_block_1 is not clear (i.e., when brown_block_1 is on grey_block_1), we can then stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1 (to satisfy the second constraint).
3. Finally, we can unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1 to make black_block_1 clear (achieving the goal).

### Optimal Plan:
```
```
unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_2
putdown grey_block_2
unstack brown_block_2 brown_block_1
stack grey_block_2 black_block_1
unstack purple_block_2 black_block_1
putdown purple_block_2
```
