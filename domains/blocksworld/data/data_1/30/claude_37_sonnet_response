Let's start by understanding the initial state:

- purple_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- brown_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1
- grey_block_2 is on top of brown_block_2
- purple_block_2 is clear
- grey_block_2 is clear
- I'm not holding any block

So initially the stacks look like:
- Stack 1: purple_block_1, grey_block_1, brown_block_1, brown_block_2, grey_block_2
- Stack 2: black_block_1, purple_block_2

And the goal is:
- black_block_1 is clear

With the constraints:
1. "there is a block on top of grey_block_1, i.e., grey_block_1 is not clear" must hold in at least one state.
2. If "there is a block on top of grey_block_1, i.e., grey_block_1 is not clear" holds in some state s, then "grey_block_2 is on top of black_block_1" must hold at s or at some state after s.

Let's analyze the constraints:
- Constraint 1 is already satisfied in the initial state, because brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1.
- Constraint 2 means that once grey_block_1 has a block on top of it, we must ensure that at that point or later, grey_block_2 is on top of black_block_1.

To achieve the goal, we need to make black_block_1 clear, which means removing purple_block_2 from it.

Here's a plan I'm thinking of:
1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2
2. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1
4. Unstack grey_block_1 from purple_block_1
5. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1
6. Stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1 (to satisfy the constraint)
7. Put down grey_block_2 (to make black_block_1 clear again)

But there's a problem with this plan. After step 4, I'll be holding grey_block_1, and the constraint "there is a block on top of grey_block_1" will no longer be true. Also, grey_block_2 is not yet on top of black_block_1, which violates constraint 2.

Let me step back and think more carefully.

Constraint 2 says that once grey_block_1 has a block on top of it, we must ensure that at that point or later, grey_block_2 is on top of black_block_1. This is already the case in the initial state: grey_block_1 has a block on top of it (brown_block_1), but grey_block_2 is not on top of black_block_1. 

So we need to put grey_block_2 on top of black_block_1 at some point, and then we can make black_block_1 clear by removing all blocks from it.

Let's revise the plan:
1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2
2. Stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1 (satisfying constraint 2)
3. Unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1
4. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1
5. Put down purple_block_2 (achieving the goal: black_block_1 is clear)

Actually, I realize there's a problem with this plan too. After step 1, I'll be holding grey_block_2, so I won't be able to unstack purple_block_2 directly in step 4.

Let me try again with a more carefully designed plan:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2
2. Stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1 (this satisfies constraint 2, since grey_block_1 still has brown_block_1 on top of it)
3. Unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1
4. Put down grey_block_2
5. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1
6. Put down purple_block_2

This should work. After this sequence, black_block_1 will be clear, which is our goal. And we've satisfied both constraints:
1. grey_block_1 had a block on top of it during steps 1-4 (satisfying constraint 1)
2. During steps 2, grey_block_2 was on top of black_block_1, while grey_block_1 still had a block on top of it (satisfying constraint 2)

Let me check this plan step by step to make sure it's valid:

Initial state:
- Stack 1: purple_block_1, grey_block_1, brown_block_1, brown_block_2, grey_block_2
- Stack 2: black_block_1, purple_block_2

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2
   - Valid because grey_block_2 is clear, it's on top of brown_block_2, and I'm not holding any block.
   - After: I'm holding grey_block_2, brown_block_2 is clear.

2. Stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1
   - But wait, this is not valid! black_block_1 is not clear, as purple_block_2 is on top of it.

I need to rethink this plan. Let's start by making black_block_1 clear, and then figure out how to satisfy the constraints.

1. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1
   - Valid because purple_block_2 is clear, it's on top of black_block_1, and I'm not holding any block.
   - After: I'm holding purple_block_2, black_block_1 is clear.

But now I can't put grey_block_2 on top of black_block_1 while grey_block_1 still has a block on top of it, because I'm already holding purple_block_2. 

Let me go back to the beginning. I need to understand the constraints better.

Constraint 1: "there is a block on top of grey_block_1, i.e., grey_block_1 is not clear" must hold in at least one state.
- This is already satisfied in the initial state.

Constraint 2: If "there is a block on top of grey_block_1, i.e., grey_block_1 is not clear" holds in some state s, then "grey_block_2 is on top of black_block_1" must hold at s or at some state after s.
- This means that once grey_block_1 has a block on top of it, we need to ensure that grey_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 at that point or later.

In the initial state, grey_block_1 has a block on top of it (brown_block_1), but grey_block_2 is not on top of black_block_1. So we need to place grey_block_2 on top of black_block_1 at some point to satisfy constraint 2.

But before we can put grey_block_2 on top of black_block_1, we need to ensure black_block_1 is clear, which means removing purple_block_2 from it. And to place grey_block_2 on black_block_1, we need to get grey_block_2 from its current position.

Let's try again:

Initial state:
- Stack 1: purple_block_1, grey_block_1, brown_block_1, brown_block_2, grey_block_2
- Stack 2: black_block_1, purple_block_2

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2
   - Valid because grey_block_2 is clear, it's on top of brown_block_2, and I'm not holding any block.
   - After: I'm holding grey_block_2, brown_block_2 is clear.

2. Put down grey_block_2
   - Valid because I'm holding grey_block_2.
   - After: grey_block_2 is on the table and clear, I'm not holding any block.

3. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1
   - Valid because purple_block_2 is clear, it's on top of black_block_1, and I'm not holding any block.
   - After: I'm holding purple_block_2, black_block_1 is clear.

4. Put down purple_block_2
   - Valid because I'm holding purple_block_2.
   - After: purple_block_2 is on the table and clear, I'm not holding any block.

5. Pickup grey_block_2
   - Valid because grey_block_2 is clear, it's on the table, and I'm not holding any block.
   - After: I'm holding grey_block_2, grey_block_2 is no longer on the table.

6. Stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1
   - Valid because I'm holding grey_block_2 and black_block_1 is clear.
   - After: grey_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 and clear, black_block_1 is not clear, I'm not holding any block.

But at this point, black_block_1 is not clear, which doesn't achieve our goal. We need to remove grey_block_2 from black_block_1.

7. Unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1
   - Valid because grey_block_2 is clear, it's on top of black_block_1, and I'm not holding any block.
   - After: I'm holding grey_block_2, black_block_1 is clear.

8. Put down grey_block_2
   - Valid because I'm holding grey_block_2.
   - After: grey_block_2 is on the table and clear, I'm not holding any block.

Great! After this sequence, black_block_1 is clear, which is our goal. Let's check if all constraints are satisfied.

Constraint 1: "there is a block on top of grey_block_1, i.e., grey_block_1 is not clear" must hold in at least one state.
- This is satisfied in the initial state, where brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1, and this remains true throughout the sequence.

Constraint 2: If "there is a block on top of grey_block_1, i.e., grey_block_1 is not clear" holds in some state s, then "grey_block_2 is on top of black_block_1" must hold at s or at some state after s.
- This is satisfied at step 6, where grey_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 and grey_block_1 still has brown_block_1 on top of it.

I think this plan works. Let me double-check the sequence of steps and the states after each step:

0. Initial state:
   - Stack 1: purple_block_1, grey_block_1, brown_block_1, brown_block_2, grey_block_2
   - Stack 2: black_block_1, purple_block_2
   - I'm not holding any block.

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2:
   - After: I'm holding grey_block_2, brown_block_2 is clear.
   - Stack 1: purple_block_1, grey_block_1, brown_block_1, brown_block_2
   - Stack 2: black_block_1, purple_block_2

2. Put down grey_block_2:
   - After: grey_block_2 is on the table and clear, I'm not holding any block.
   - Stack 1: purple_block_1, grey_block_1, brown_block_1, brown_block_2
   - Stack 2: black_block_1, purple_block_2
   - Table: grey_block_2

3. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1:
   - After: I'm holding purple_block_2, black_block_1 is clear.
   - Stack 1: purple_block_1, grey_block_1, brown_block_1, brown_block_2
   - Stack 2: black_block_1
   - Table: grey_block_2

4. Put down purple_block_2:
   - After: purple_block_2 is on the table and clear, I'm not holding any block.
   - Stack 1: purple_block_1, grey_block_1, brown_block_1, brown_block_2
   - Stack 2: black_block_1
   - Table: grey_block_2, purple_block_2

5. Pickup grey_block_2:
   - After: I'm holding grey_block_2, grey_block_2 is no longer on the table.
   - Stack 1: purple_block_1, grey_block_1, brown_block_1, brown_block_2
   - Stack 2: black_block_1
   - Table: purple_block_2

6. Stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1:
   - After: grey_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 and clear, black_block_1 is not clear, I'm not holding any block.
   - Stack 1: purple_block_1, grey_block_1, brown_block_1, brown_block_2
   - Stack 2: black_block_1, grey_block_2
   - Table: purple_block_2

7. Unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1:
   - After: I'm holding grey_block_2, black_block_1 is clear.
   - Stack 1: purple_block_1, grey_block_1, brown_block_1, brown_block_2
   - Stack 2: black_block_1
   - Table: purple_block_2

8. Put down grey_block_2:
   - After: grey_block_2 is on the table and clear, I'm not holding any block.
   - Stack 1: purple_block_1, grey_block_1, brown_block_1, brown_block_2
   - Stack 2: black_block_1
   - Table: purple_block_2, grey_block_2

But wait, I notice a potential issue with my understanding of constraint 2. Let me re-read it again:

Constraint 2: If "there is a block on top of grey_block_1, i.e., grey_block_1 is not clear" holds in some state s, then "grey_block_2 is on top of black_block_1" must hold at s or at some state after s.

The constraint says that if grey_block_1 has a block on top of it in a state (s), then grey_block_2 should be on top of black_block_1 in that state or in a later state. In the initial state, grey_block_1 already has a block on top of it (brown_block_1), which means constraint 2 requires grey_block_2 to be on top of black_block_1 at some point. And indeed, at step 6, we place grey_block_2 on top of black_block_1, which satisfies the constraint.

Actually, I think I previously misunderstood the constraint. The constraint is not saying that we need to maintain "grey_block_2 on top of black_block_1" as long as "grey_block_1 has a block on top of it". It's saying that once "grey_block_1 has a block on top of it" happens, then at that point or later, "grey_block_2 on top of black_block_1" should happen. This is a weaker constraint than I initially thought.

So the plan I worked out (steps 1-8) should satisfy both constraints and achieve the goal.

Let me try to summarize the plan:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2
2. Put down grey_block_2
3. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1
4. Put down purple_block_2
5. Pickup grey_block_2
6. Stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1
7. Unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1
8. Put down grey_block_2

But now I'm wondering if we can optimize this plan.

Actually, let's think about the constraints again:

Constraint 1: "there is a block on top of grey_block_1, i.e., grey_block_1 is not clear" must hold in at least one state.
- This is already satisfied in the initial state.

Constraint 2: If "there is a block on top of grey_block_1, i.e., grey_block_1 is not clear" holds in some state s, then "grey_block_2 is on top of black_block_1" must hold at s or at some state after s.
- Since grey_block_1 has a block on top of it in the initial state, we need to place grey_block_2 on top of black_block_1 at some point.

I notice that constraint 2 does not specify that grey_block_1 needs to continue having a block on top of it when grey_block_2 is on top of black_block_1.

So here's a more direct plan:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2
2. Put down grey_block_2
3. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1
4. Put down purple_block_2
5. Pickup grey_block_2
6. Stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1
7. Unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1
8. Put down grey_block_2

I think this plan is already minimal. The goal is to make black_block_1 clear, and constraint 2 requires that grey_block_2 be on top of black_block_1 at some point. The most direct way to achieve this is to first remove purple_block_2 from black_block_1, then place grey_block_2 on black_block_1, and finally remove grey_block_2 from black_block_1.

Actually, I thought about it more, and I think we can optimize this plan a bit more. Let's consider:

Initial state:
- Stack 1: purple_block_1, grey_block_1, brown_block_1, brown_block_2, grey_block_2
- Stack 2: black_block_1, purple_block_2

Our goal is to make black_block_1 clear. Due to constraint 2, we need to ensure that grey_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 at some point.

Let's break down the plan:

1. We need to unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2.
2. We need to clear black_block_1 by unstacking purple_block_2 from it.
3. We need to stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1 to satisfy constraint 2.
4. We need to unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1 to make black_block_1 clear (goal).

Here's a more direct plan:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2
2. Put down grey_block_2 (we need to free our hand to unstack purple_block_2)
3. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1
4. Put down purple_block_2 (we need to free our hand to pick up grey_block_2)
5. Pickup grey_block_2
6. Stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1 (satisfying constraint 2)
7. Unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1
8. Put down grey_block_2 (achieving the goal: black_block_1 is clear)

This is the same plan I outlined before. I believe this plan is already minimal. We could swap the order of some steps, but we'd still need the same number of actions.

Actually, let's think about swapping the order. What if we first unstack purple_block_2, and then deal with grey_block_2?

1. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1
2. Put down purple_block_2 (freeing our hand)
3. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2
4. Stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1 (satisfying constraint 2)
5. Unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1
6. Put down grey_block_2 (achieving the goal: black_block_1 is clear)

This plan has 6 steps instead of 8. I think this is the optimal plan.

Let me check this plan step by step:

0. Initial state:
   - Stack 1: purple_block_1, grey_block_1, brown_block_1, brown_block_2, grey_block_2
   - Stack 2: black_block_1, purple_block_2
   - I'm not holding any block.

1. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1:
   - Valid because purple_block_2 is clear, it's on top of black_block_1, and I'm not holding any block.
   - After: I'm holding purple_block_2, black_block_1 is clear.
   - Stack 1: purple_block_1, grey_block_1, brown_block_1, brown_block_2, grey_block_2
   - Stack 2: black_block_1

2. Put down purple_block_2:
   - Valid because I'm holding purple_block_2.
   - After: purple_block_2 is on the table and clear, I'm not holding any block.
   - Stack 1: purple_block_1, grey_block_1, brown_block_1, brown_block_2, grey_block_2
   - Stack 2: black_block_1
   - Table: purple_block_2

3. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2:
   - Valid because grey_block_2 is clear, it's on top of brown_block_2, and I'm not holding any block.
   - After: I'm holding grey_block_2, brown_block_2 is clear.
   - Stack 1: purple_block_1, grey_block_1, brown_block_1, brown_block_2
   - Stack 2: black_block_1
   - Table: purple_block_2

4. Stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1:
   - Valid because I'm holding grey_block_2 and black_block_1 is clear.
   - After: grey_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 and clear, black_block_1 is not clear, I'm not holding any block.
   - Stack 1: purple_block_1, grey_block_1, brown_block_1, brown_block_2
   - Stack 2: black_block_1, grey_block_2
   - Table: purple_block_2

5. Unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1:
   - Valid because grey_block_2 is clear, it's on top of black_block_1, and I'm not holding any block.
   - After: I'm holding grey_block_2, black_block_1 is clear.
   - Stack 1: purple_block_1, grey_block_1, brown_block_1, brown_block_2
   - Stack 2: black_block_1
   - Table: purple_block_2

6. Put down grey_block_2:
   - Valid because I'm holding grey_block_2.
   - After: grey_block_2 is on the table and clear, I'm not holding any block.
   - Stack 1: purple_block_1, grey_block_1, brown_block_1, brown_block_2
   - Stack 2: black_block_1
   - Table: purple_block_2, grey_block_2

So after this sequence, black_block_1 is clear, which is our goal, and we've satisfied both constraints (since brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 throughout, and grey_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 at one point).

I believe this is the optimal plan.

Let me double check the satisfaction of the constraints:

Constraint 1: "there is a block on top of grey_block_1, i.e., grey_block_1 is not clear" must hold in at least one state.
- This constraint is satisfied because grey_block_1 has brown_block_1 on top of it throughout the sequence.

Constraint 2: If "there is a block on top of grey_block_1, i.e., grey_block_1 is not clear" holds in some state s, then "grey_block_2 is on top of black_block_1" must hold at s or at some state after s.
- This constraint is satisfied because at step 4, grey_block_2 is on top of black_block_1, and at that point, grey_block_1 still has brown_block_1 on top of it.

Yes, I'm confident that the plan I outlined is correct and optimal.
