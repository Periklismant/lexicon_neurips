Okay, let's see. I need to figure out a plan to get green_block_1 on top of purple_block_1. But there's a constraint that at some point, I have to be holding purple_block_1. Hmm. Let's start by understanding the initial state.

In the initial state:

- yellow_block_1 is on the table and clear.
- blue_block_1 is on the table, but green_block_1 is on top of it. And green_block_1 is clear.
- purple_block_1 is on the table. On top of purple_block_1 is brown_block_1, then grey_block_1, then white_block_1. So the stack is purple -> brown -> grey -> white. All except white are not clear. White is clear.
- The other blocks (yellow, blue, etc.) are in their positions.

The goal is to have green_block_1 on purple_block_1. So I need to move green_block_1 from blue_block_1 to purple_block_1. But first, purple_block_1 currently has a stack on it (purple, brown, grey, white). So to stack green on purple, I need to clear purple. That means I need to move the stack on top of purple (brown, grey, white) somewhere else.

But there's a constraint: at least one state must have me holding purple_block_1. Wait, but purple_block_1 is on the table in the initial state. To hold it, I can just pickup purple_block_1. But if purple_block_1 is under brown_block_1, I can't pick it up until the blocks above it are moved. Oh wait, in the initial state, purple_block_1 is on the table, and brown is on top of it. So purple is not clear. So I can't pick up purple_block_1 until brown is removed. Because to pickup a block, it needs to be clear and on the table. So brown is on purple, so purple is not clear, so can't pick up purple_block_1 until brown is moved.

So the constraint requires that at some point, I hold purple_block_1. So to do that, I need to first clear purple_block_1 by moving the blocks above it. The stack is purple -> brown -> grey -> white. So to clear purple, I need to unstack brown from purple. But brown is under grey and white. So I need to unstack white from grey, then unstack grey from brown, then unstack brown from purple. Then purple is clear, so I can pickup purple. Then maybe put it back down, but the constraint just requires that I hold it at least once.

But the main goal is to get green on purple. So let's think. The steps might be:

1. Remove the stack from purple (brown, grey, white) to somewhere else.
2. Then, move green_block_1 from blue to purple.
3. Also, the constraint: during this process, make sure to pick up purple_block_1 at some point.

Wait, but after moving brown, grey, and white off purple, then purple is clear and on the table. So I can pickup purple. But why would I need to do that? Because the goal is to have green on purple. So perhaps after moving the stack from purple, I can put purple somewhere else, but no, the goal is green on purple. So purple needs to stay on the table. Wait, but if purple is on the table and clear, then green can be stacked on it.

Wait, the initial state has purple on the table. But brown is on top of purple. So after moving brown, grey, white off, purple is back on the table and clear. Then green can be stacked on it.

But the constraint says that in at least one state, I'm holding purple. So maybe after moving the stack off purple, I have to pick up purple and then put it down again. But why? Because the goal requires that green is on purple, so purple must be on the table (or on another block, but the goal doesn't specify where purple is, except that green is on it). Wait, the goal is "green_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1". So purple_block_1 can be on the table or on another block. But in the initial state, purple is on the table. So if we leave purple on the table, then stacking green on it is possible. But the problem is that the stack on purple (brown, grey, white) needs to be removed first.

So steps:

First, unstack white from grey. To do that, since white is clear, and grey is under white. So unstack white grey. Then put white on the table. Then unstack grey from brown. Then put grey on the table. Then unstack brown from purple. Then put brown on the table. Now purple is clear and on the table. Now, to satisfy the constraint, we need to pick up purple. So perhaps after that, pickup purple and then put it down again. Then stack green on purple. But why pick up purple? Because the constraint requires that at some point, the robotic arm is holding purple_block_1. So maybe after clearing purple, we can do:

pickup purple_block_1 (since it's on the table and clear), then put it down again. Then stack green on it. That would satisfy the constraint. Because during that process, the arm holds purple.

But is there a more efficient way? Let's see. The main steps needed:

1. Remove brown, grey, white from purple.
2. Move green from blue to purple.

But during step 1, when we unstack brown from purple, maybe we can handle the constraint. Wait, but unstack brown from purple would require that brown is on purple, and brown is clear (since unstack requires the block to be unstacked is clear). In the initial state, brown has grey on top, so brown is not clear. So first, we have to unstack grey from brown. But grey has white on top. So first, unstack white from grey. Let's outline the steps:

Initial stack on purple: purple has brown, which has grey, which has white. All not clear except white.

So:

Action 1: unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1

Now, the arm is holding white. Then put it down:

Action 2: putdown white_block_1

Now white is on the table. Next, unstack grey_block_1 from brown_block_1. But grey is now on brown, and after putting white down, grey is clear. So:

Action 3: unstack grey_block_1 brown_block_1

Arm is holding grey. Put it down:

Action 4: putdown grey_block_1

Now, brown is clear. So we can unstack brown from purple:

Action 5: unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1

Arm holds brown. Then putdown:

Action 6: putdown brown_block_1

Now, purple is clear and on the table. Now, to satisfy the constraint, we need to pick up purple. So:

Action 7: pickup purple_block_1

Then put it down:

Action 8: putdown purple_block_1

Now purple is on the table and clear. Now, we need to move green_block_1 from blue_block_1 to purple. So first, unstack green from blue:

Action 9: unstack green_block_1 blue_block_1

Arm holds green. Then stack it on purple:

Action 10: stack green_block_1 purple_block_1

That would achieve the goal. But the plan would be 10 actions. But is there a shorter way?

Wait, after step 5 (unstack brown from purple), we have purple clear. Then instead of putting brown down, perhaps we can put it somewhere else, but maybe that's not necessary. Alternatively, after step 5, we can immediately proceed to pickup purple. Because after unstack brown, purple is clear and on the table. So step 6: pickup purple_block_1. Then put it down (step7). Then proceed to move green.

But perhaps we can combine steps. Let's see:

After unstack brown from purple (action5), the arm is holding brown. Then we need to put it down. So action6: putdown brown. Now, purple is clear. Then action7: pickup purple. Action8: putdown purple. Then action9: unstack green from blue. Action10: stack green on purple. That's 10 steps. But maybe we can avoid some steps.

Wait, after unstack brown (action5), the arm is holding brown. Can we stack brown somewhere else instead of putting it down? But where? Maybe stack brown on the table. But stacking is putting on another block. Wait, putdown is to put on the table. So action6 is putdown brown. Then after that, purple is clear, so we can pick up purple. Then putdown purple. But putting down purple again is redundant unless we have to. Wait, why do we need to putdown purple? Because after picking up purple, we need to put it down to stack green on it. Because to stack green on purple, purple must be on the table? No, stacking can be on any block. Wait, no. The stack action requires that the destination block (y) is clear and that the robotic arm is holding the block to be stacked (x). So when we pickup purple, we can then stack it on another block, but the goal is to have green on purple. So purple needs to be a base for green. If after picking up purple, we put it down, then purple is on the table and clear. Then we can stack green on it. Alternatively, if we stack purple on some other block, but then green would need to be on top of purple. But that would require that purple is on another block. The goal doesn't specify where purple is, only that green is on top of it. So perhaps, after moving the stack off purple, we can leave purple on the table, then stack green on it. So after steps 1-6 (unstacking white, grey, brown), purple is clear. Then, to satisfy the constraint, we have to pick up purple. So action7: pickup purple. Then action8: putdown purple. Then unstack green from blue (action9), stack green on purple (action10). But maybe there's a way to avoid putting purple back down. Wait, if we pickup purple (action7) and then immediately put it down (action8), then it's back to the same state. But the constraint is satisfied because we held it. So that's necessary. So steps 7 and 8 are necessary for the constraint.

Alternatively, could we stack green on purple while holding purple? Let's see. Suppose after action5 (unstack brown from purple, arm holds brown), putdown brown (action6). Then action7: pickup purple. Now, the arm is holding purple. Then action8: stack purple on some block. But where? The goal is green on purple, so if we stack purple on, say, yellow_block_1, then purple would be on yellow. Then we can stack green on purple. But that would meet the goal. But the problem is that after stacking purple on yellow, we need to have green on purple, which is now on yellow. But the goal doesn't care where purple is, as long as green is on top of it. So maybe that's possible. Let's think:

Action7: stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1

But wait, to stack purple on yellow, we need yellow to be clear. In the initial state, yellow is clear and on the table. So after action7: stack purple on yellow. Then, we need to get green on top of purple. So first, unstack green from blue (action8), then stack green on purple (action9). But after stacking purple on yellow, purple is on yellow and clear. So stacking green on purple would require that the arm is holding green and purple is clear. That's possible. But in this case, the steps would be:

After action6 (putdown brown), we do:

7. pickup purple (since it's clear and on table)
8. stack purple yellow
9. unstack green blue
10. stack green purple

But this saves a step (since we don't have to putdown purple). But the total steps are 10 in the previous plan and 10 here. Wait, but in this case, steps 7-10 would be 4 steps, making total steps 10. But maybe this is more efficient. Let's count:

Original plan steps:

1. unstack white grey
2. putdown white
3. unstack grey brown
4. putdown grey
5. unstack brown purple
6. putdown brown
7. pickup purple
8. putdown purple
9. unstack green blue
10. stack green purple

Total 10 steps.

Alternative plan:

Steps 1-6 same.

7. pickup purple
8. stack purple yellow
9. unstack green blue
10. stack green purple

That's 10 steps as well. But in this case, step8 stacks purple on yellow, and step10 stacks green on purple. But this satisfies the goal. And also satisfies the constraint of holding purple. So in this case, the plan is 10 steps as well. So same length.

But maybe there's a shorter way. Let me see.

Alternatively, after moving the stack off purple, can I use the blocks I've moved to hold purple in some way that reduces steps? Let's think.

Wait, the constraint is that the arm must hold purple at least once. So in the alternative plan, when we pickup purple (step7) and stack it on yellow (step8), we do hold it, satisfying the constraint. So that plan is valid. But is there a way to do it in fewer steps?

Another idea: After unstacking brown from purple (action5), the arm is holding brown. Then, instead of putting brown down, can I stack brown on some other block? For example, stack brown on yellow. Then, purple is clear, and we can proceed to pick up purple. But let's see:

Action5: unstack brown from purple (arm holds brown)
Action6: stack brown yellow_block_1 (since yellow is clear)
Now, brown is on yellow, which is allowed. Then action7: pickup purple (since it's clear and on table)
Action8: stack purple somewhere, maybe on brown? But that's possible. Then action9: unstack green from blue, action10: stack green on purple.

But in this case, steps would be:

1. unstack white grey
2. putdown white
3. unstack grey brown
4. putdown grey
5. unstack brown purple
6. stack brown yellow
7. pickup purple
8. stack purple brown
9. unstack green blue
10. stack green purple

This is also 10 steps. So same as before. But perhaps stacking brown on yellow allows us to have a shorter path. Not sure.

Alternatively, after unstacking brown, can we put brown on the table, then pick up purple, then stack purple on brown. Then green on purple. But then, after stacking purple on brown, brown is under purple. But then, when stacking green on purple, that's okay.

But in that case, the steps would be:

1. unstack white grey
2. putdown white
3. unstack grey brown
4. putdown grey
5. unstack brown purple
6. putdown brown
7. pickup purple
8. stack purple brown
9. unstack green blue
10. stack green purple

Same 10 steps. But in this case, after step8, purple is on brown, which is on the table. Then stack green on purple. The goal is satisfied because green is on purple. So the plan is valid. And the constraint is met because step7 holds purple.

So either way, the plan is 10 steps. Hmm. But maybe there's a shorter way. Let's think again.

Wait, what if after unstacking white, grey, and brown, and then instead of putting them all on the table, we stack them somewhere else. For example, stack white on yellow, then grey on white, etc. But maybe that's not helpful. Let's see:

Alternative approach:

Original stack on purple: purple, brown, grey, white.

We need to move all these off. Suppose after unstacking white from grey (action1), instead of putting it down, stack it on yellow.

Action1: unstack white grey
Action2: stack white yellow
Then, unstack grey from brown (action3)
Action3: unstack grey brown
Action4: stack grey white
Then, unstack brown from purple (action5)
Action5: unstack brown purple
Action6: stack brown grey
Now, the stack on yellow is white, grey, brown. Then, purple is clear. Now, to satisfy the constraint, pickup purple (action7), putdown (action8). Then unstack green (action9), stack on purple (action10). Total steps 10. Same as before. No improvement.

But perhaps this way, we have a taller stack on yellow, but it doesn't affect the plan length.

Alternatively, is there a way to avoid some steps? Let's think.

Wait, the initial state has green on blue. To move green to purple, we need to unstack green from blue. Then stack it on purple. So that's two actions: unstack and stack.

But to unstack green from blue, blue must be clear. Wait, in the initial state, green is on blue, and green is clear. So yes, we can unstack green from blue. But blue is on the table. So unstack green from blue. Then stack green on purple.

But the problem is that purple has a stack on it. So first, we need to clear purple. So the steps to clear purple are the ones we discussed earlier. So regardless, the steps to clear purple require unstacking the blocks above it. So the minimal steps would be 3 unstack actions (white, grey, brown) and putting them down, then moving green. Then the constraint of holding purple requires two more steps (pickup and putdown). So total steps would be 3*2 (unstack and putdown each) for the stack on purple (6 steps), plus 2 steps for handling purple (pickup and putdown), plus 2 steps for moving green (unstack and stack). Total 10 steps. So maybe that's the minimal.

Is there a way to combine any steps? For example, after unstacking brown, instead of putting it down, use it for something else. But I don't see how.

Alternatively, when handling the constraint, could we stack purple on a different block instead of putting it down? For example, after picking up purple (step7), stack it on blue. Then unstack green from blue would require moving purple first. But that complicates things. Let's see:

After step7: pickup purple. Then step8: stack purple blue. Then step9: unstack green blue (but blue now has purple on top, so green is not there anymore. Wait, no. Initially, green is on blue. After step8, purple is stacked on blue. So blue now has purple on top, and green is under purple? No, stacking purple on blue would require that blue is clear. But blue initially has green on top. So you can't stack purple on blue until green is removed. So that's not possible. So this approach is invalid.

So perhaps the initial plan is the only way. So the minimal plan is 10 steps.

But wait, maybe there's a way to hold purple while doing other steps. For example, after unstacking brown, the arm is holding brown. Then, instead of putting brown down, can we use it to help in some way. But I don't see how.

Alternatively, when unstacking white from grey, put white on the table, then unstack grey from brown, put grey on the table. Then unstack brown from purple, put brown on the table. Now, purple is clear. Then, pickup purple (to satisfy the constraint), then putdown. Then, unstack green from blue and stack on purple.

But that's 10 steps.

Alternatively, when unstacking brown from purple, can we stack brown on another block that's already been moved. For example, stack brown on grey. But grey is on the table. So action5: unstack brown from purple. Action6: stack brown grey. Now, brown is on grey. Then, purple is clear. Then, pickup purple (action7), putdown (action8). Then unstack green (action9), stack on purple (action10). But this requires that grey is clear. After step3 and 4: grey is putdown on the table. So in step6, grey is clear, so stacking brown on grey is possible. So steps:

1. unstack white grey
2. putdown white
3. unstack grey brown
4. putdown grey
5. unstack brown purple
6. stack brown grey
7. pickup purple
8. putdown purple
9. unstack green blue
10. stack green purple

Still 10 steps. No improvement.

Is there any way to reduce the number of steps? Let me think again.

Wait, the constraint is that in at least one state, the arm is holding purple_block_1. So maybe during the process of moving the stack on purple, we can have a step where the arm is holding purple. For example, after moving all the blocks off purple, we have to pick it up. But perhaps there's a way to pick it up earlier.

Wait, during the unstacking of brown from purple, after that action, the arm is holding brown. Then, to get purple, we have to put brown down first. So that's unavoidable. So after putting brown down, we can pickup purple. So that's two steps (putdown brown, pickup purple). So that's two steps. So the minimal steps for the constraint are those two steps. So I don't think we can avoid that.

So the minimal plan is 10 steps. So the answer is the sequence of actions as described.
