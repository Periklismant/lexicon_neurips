I'll solve this planning problem step by step, considering the constraints and finding an optimal plan.

First, let me analyze the initial state:
- Yellow_block_1 is on the table and clear
- Blue_block_1 is on the table with green_block_1 on top
- Purple_block_1 is on the table with a stack: brown_block_1, grey_block_1, white_block_1
- Green_block_1 and white_block_1 are clear
- No block is being held

The goal is to have green_block_1 on top of purple_block_1.

The constraint requires that at some point I must be holding purple_block_1, which means I need to clear purple_block_1 first by removing the stack on top of it.

Here's my plan:

```
unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1
putdown white_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 brown_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
pickup purple_block_1
putdown purple_block_1
unstack green_block_1 blue_block_1
stack green_block_1 purple_block_1
```

This plan:
1. Dismantles the stack on top of purple_block_1
2. Picks up purple_block_1 (satisfying the constraint)
3. Puts purple_block_1 back on the table
4. Takes green_block_1 from blue_block_1
5. Places green_block_1 on top of purple_block_1 (achieving the goal)
