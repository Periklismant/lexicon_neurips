Let's break down the problem step by step to find an optimal plan that satisfies the goal and the constraints.

### Initial State:
- yellow_block_1: on table, clear
- blue_block_1: on table, green_block_1 on top (green_block_1 is clear)
- purple_block_1: on table, brown_block_1 on top (brown_block_1 is not clear, grey_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1, white_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1, white_block_1 is clear)
- brown_block_1: on purple_block_1, grey_block_1 on top
- grey_block_1: on brown_block_1, white_block_1 on top
- green_block_1: on blue_block_1, clear
- white_block_1: on grey_block_1, clear
- Holding: nothing

### Goal:
- green_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1

### Constraints:
- At least one state where "you are holding purple_block_1" must hold.

### Steps to Achieve the Goal:
1. To move green_block_1 to purple_block_1, we first need to clear purple_block_1. Currently, purple_block_1 has brown_block_1 on it, which in turn has grey_block_1 and white_block_1 on top. So, we need to unstack this tower.
2. The constraint requires that we hold purple_block_1 at some point. Since purple_block_1 is on the table, we can pick it up (but only if it's clear). Currently, it's not clear (brown_block_1 is on it), so we need to clear it first.
3. To clear purple_block_1, we need to unstack the tower on top of it: white_block_1, grey_block_1, brown_block_1.

### Plan:
1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1 (since white_block_1 is clear).
   - Now holding white_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear.
2. Putdown white_block_1 on the table.
   - white_block_1 is on the table, clear; holding nothing.
3. Unstack grey_block_1 from brown_block_1 (grey_block_1 is now clear).
   - Now holding grey_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear.
4. Putdown grey_block_1 on the table.
   - grey_block_1 is on the table, clear; holding nothing.
5. Unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_1 (brown_block_1 is now clear).
   - Now holding brown_block_1, purple_block_1 is clear.
6. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table.
   - brown_block_1 is on the table, clear; holding nothing.
7. Now purple_block_1 is clear and on the table. Pickup purple_block_1 to satisfy the constraint.
   - Now holding purple_block_1, purple_block_1 is not on the table.
8. Putdown purple_block_1 back on the table (to allow stacking green_block_1 on it later).
   - purple_block_1 is on the table, clear; holding nothing.
9. Now, green_block_1 is on blue_block_1 and clear. Unstack green_block_1 from blue_block_1.
   - Now holding green_block_1, blue_block_1 is clear.
10. Stack green_block_1 on purple_block_1 (purple_block_1 is clear).
    - green_block_1 is on purple_block_1, green_block_1 is clear; holding nothing.

### Final Plan:
```
```
pickup white_block_1
putdown white_block_1
pickup grey_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
pickup brown_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
pickup purple_block_1
putdown purple_block_1
pickup green_block_1
stack green_block_1 purple_block_1
```
