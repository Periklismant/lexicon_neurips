Let's analyze this Blocksworld planning problem:

Original State:
- yellow_block_1 is on the table and clear
- blue_block_1 is on the table with green_block_1 on top
- purple_block_1 is on the table with brown_block_1 on top, then grey_block_1 on top of brown_block_1, and white_block_1 on top of grey_block_1
- you're not holding any block

Goal:
- green_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1

Constraint:
- At some point we must be holding purple_block_1

First, let's understand what we need to do:
1. We need to move green_block_1 from blue_block_1 to purple_block_1
2. To do this, purple_block_1 must be clear (no blocks on top)
3. We also need to satisfy the constraint of holding purple_block_1 at some point

Let me draw the initial state for clarity:

```
     W
     |
     G          G
     |          |
     B          B
     |          |
     P          Y
    table     table
```

Where:
- W = white_block_1
- G = grey_block_1
- B = brown_block_1
- P = purple_block_1
- G = green_block_1
- B = blue_block_1
- Y = yellow_block_1

And the goal state would be:
```
                G
                |
     W          P
     |         
     G         B
     |          |
     B          Y
    table     table
```

Now, to develop a plan:

1. First, we need to clear purple_block_1 by removing the stack of blocks on top of it
2. Once purple_block_1 is clear, we need to pick it up (to satisfy our constraint)
3. Then put purple_block_1 back down
4. Finally, move green_block_1 onto purple_block_1

Let's create the plan step by step:

1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1
2. Put white_block_1 on the table
3. Unstack grey_block_1 from brown_block_1
4. Put grey_block_1 on the table
5. Unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_1
6. Put brown_block_1 on the table
7. Pickup purple_block_1 (fulfilling our constraint)
8. Putdown purple_block_1
9. Unstack green_block_1 from blue_block_1
10. Stack green_block_1 on purple_block_1

Let me double-check that this plan is valid and satisfies our constraint:

- We clear purple_block_1 by steps 1-6
- We pick up purple_block_1 in step 7, satisfying our constraint
- We put it back down to prepare for the final goal
- We move green_block_1 to purple_block_1

This looks correct. Let me prepare the formal plan:

```
unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1
putdown white_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 brown_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
pickup purple_block_1
putdown purple_block_1
unstack green_block_1 blue_block_1
stack green_block_1 purple_block_1
```

But wait, I need to check again if this is optimal. The constraint is that we need to hold purple_block_1 at some point, but we might not need to put it back down immediately.

Let's revise:

1. We need to clear purple_block_1
2. We need to pick up purple_block_1 at some point (for the constraint)
3. We need to move green_block_1 onto purple_block_1

Actually, after purple_block_1 is cleared, we could:
1. Unstack green_block_1
2. Put green_block_1 on the table
3. Pickup purple_block_1
4. Putdown purple_block_1
5. Pickup green_block_1
6. Stack green_block_1 on purple_block_1

Or we could:
1. Pickup purple_block_1
2. Putdown purple_block_1
3. Unstack green_block_1
4. Stack green_block_1 on purple_block_1

Both would work, but the second is more efficient.

Actually, let me go through everything again one more time to make sure the plan is optimal. 

Initial state:
- yellow_block_1 is on the table and clear
- blue_block_1 is on the table with green_block_1 on top
- purple_block_1 is on the table with brown_block_1 on top, then grey_block_1 on top of brown_block_1, and white_block_1 on top of grey_block_1
- you're not holding any block

Let's reconsider the tower:
```
white_block_1
grey_block_1
brown_block_1
purple_block_1
table
```

And:
```
green_block_1
blue_block_1
table
```

And:
```
yellow_block_1
table
```

To achieve our goal and satisfy the constraint:
1. We need to clear purple_block_1 (by removing 3 blocks)
2. We need to pick up purple_block_1 (for the constraint)
3. We need to place green_block_1 on purple_block_1

Let's see, if we want an optimal plan:

1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1
2. Putdown white_block_1
3. Unstack grey_block_1 from brown_block_1
4. Putdown grey_block_1
5. Unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_1
6. Putdown brown_block_1
7. Pickup purple_block_1 (satisfying constraint)
8. Putdown purple_block_1
9. Unstack green_block_1 from blue_block_1
10. Stack green_block_1 on purple_block_1

Actually I think there's an even more efficient solution. Let's see if we can find a shorter plan:

1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1
2. Putdown white_block_1
3. Unstack grey_block_1 from brown_block_1
4. Putdown grey_block_1
5. Unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_1
6. Putdown brown_block_1
7. Unstack green_block_1 from blue_block_1
8. Putdown green_block_1
9. Pickup purple_block_1 (satisfying constraint)
10. Putdown purple_block_1
11. Pickup green_block_1
12. Stack green_block_1 on purple_block_1

Wait, that's longer. Let me reconsider:

1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1
2. Putdown white_block_1
3. Unstack grey_block_1 from brown_block_1
4. Putdown grey_block_1
5. Unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_1
6. Putdown brown_block_1
7. Unstack green_block_1 from blue_block_1
8. Stack green_block_1 on purple_block_1

But this doesn't satisfy the constraint of holding purple_block_1. Let me try something else:

1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1
2. Putdown white_block_1
3. Unstack grey_block_1 from brown_block_1
4. Putdown grey_block_1
5. Unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_1
6. Putdown brown_block_1
7. Pickup purple_block_1 (satisfying constraint)
8. Putdown purple_block_1
9. Unstack green_block_1 from blue_block_1
10. Stack green_block_1 on purple_block_1

Ok, this is a bit more complicated than I thought. Let me carefully trace through the execution of this plan and see if it's optimal:

1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1
   - Now holding white_block_1
2. Putdown white_block_1
   - white_block_1 on table, not holding anything
3. Unstack grey_block_1 from brown_block_1
   - Now holding grey_block_1
4. Putdown grey_block_1
   - grey_block_1 on table, not holding anything
5. Unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_1
   - Now holding brown_block_1
6. Putdown brown_block_1
   - brown_block_1 on table, not holding anything
7. Pickup purple_block_1
   - Now holding purple_block_1, satisfying our constraint
8. Putdown purple_block_1
   - purple_block_1 on table, not holding anything
9. Unstack green_block_1 from blue_block_1
   - Now holding green_block_1
10. Stack green_block_1 on purple_block_1
    - green_block_1 on purple_block_1, goal achieved

This seems to be the optimal plan. Let's double-check:

- We need to clear purple_block_1 first, which takes 6 steps (3 unstacks and 3 putdowns)
- We need to satisfy the constraint of holding purple_block_1, which takes 2 steps (pickup and putdown)
- We need to move green_block_1 onto purple_block_1, which takes 2 steps (unstack and stack)

Total: 10 steps, which seems optimal.

Therefore, the final plan is:

```
unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1
putdown white_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 brown_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
pickup purple_block_1
putdown purple_block_1
unstack green_block_1 blue_block_1
stack green_block_1 purple_block_1
```

I think this plan is correct and optimal.

Actually, let me check whether the pickup/putdown of purple_block_1 is necessary. Let's see:

If we don't pickup/putdown purple_block_1, our plan would be:
1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1
2. Putdown white_block_1
3. Unstack grey_block_1 from brown_block_1
4. Putdown grey_block_1
5. Unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_1
6. Putdown brown_block_1
7. Unstack green_block_1 from blue_block_1
8. Stack green_block_1 on purple_block_1

That would be 8 steps, which is shorter than our 10-step plan. However, this plan doesn't satisfy the constraint that at some point, we must be holding purple_block_1.

Actually, there's another option:

1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1
2. Putdown white_block_1
3. Unstack grey_block_1 from brown_block_1
4. Putdown grey_block_1
5. Unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_1
6. Putdown brown_block_1
7. Pickup purple_block_1 (satisfying constraint)
8. Stack purple_block_1 on [some block, perhaps blue_block_1]
9. Unstack green_block_1 from blue_block_1
10. Putdown green_block_1
11. Unstack purple_block_1 from [the block we stacked it on]
12. Putdown purple_block_1
13. Pickup green_block_1
14. Stack green_block_1 on purple_block_1

That's 14 steps, which is worse than our 10-step plan.

Let me consider one more option. What if we:
1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1
2. Putdown white_block_1
3. Unstack grey_block_1 from brown_block_1
4. Putdown grey_block_1
5. Unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_1
6. Putdown brown_block_1
7. Unstack green_block_1 from blue_block_1
8. Putdown green_block_1
9. Pickup purple_block_1 (satisfying constraint)
10. Hold purple_block_1 while figuring out next step...

But at this point we're holding purple_block_1 and we need to put green_block_1 on top of it, which we can't do while holding purple_block_1. So we'd need to put purple_block_1 down, pick up green_block_1, and then stack it.

1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1
2. Putdown white_block_1
3. Unstack grey_block_1 from brown_block_1
4. Putdown grey_block_1
5. Unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_1
6. Putdown brown_block_1
7. Unstack green_block_1 from blue_block_1
8. Putdown green_block_1
9. Pickup purple_block_1 (satisfying constraint)
10. Putdown purple_block_1
11. Pickup green_block_1
12. Stack green_block_1 on purple_block_1

That's 12 steps, worse than the 10-step plan above.

Ok, so I believe the 10-step plan I outlined earlier is the most optimal solution:

```
unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1
putdown white_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 brown_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
pickup purple_block_1
putdown purple_block_1
unstack green_block_1 blue_block_1
stack green_block_1 purple_block_1
```

But actually, wait, let me think a bit more. Maybe there's a more efficient way. Since we need to hold purple_block_1 at some point, what if we do that at the very end?

1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1
2. Putdown white_block_1
3. Unstack grey_block_1 from brown_block_1
4. Putdown grey_block_1
5. Unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_1
6. Putdown brown_block_1
7. Unstack green_block_1 from blue_block_1
8. Stack green_block_1 on purple_block_1
9. Unstack green_block_1 from purple_block_1
10. Putdown green_block_1
11. Pickup purple_block_1 (satisfying constraint)
12. Putdown purple_block_1
13. Pickup green_block_1
14. Stack green_block_1 on purple_block_1

Hmm, that's 14 steps, which is worse.

Ok, I think the 10-step plan is indeed optimal. Let me one final sanity check it:

1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1
2. Putdown white_block_1
3. Unstack grey_block_1 from brown_block_1
4. Putdown grey_block_1
5. Unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_1
6. Putdown brown_block_1
7. Pickup purple_block_1 (satisfying constraint)
8. Putdown purple_block_1
9. Unstack green_block_1 from blue_block_1
10. Stack green_block_1 on purple_block_1

This plan is valid and satisfies all constraints. The initial 6 steps are necessary to clear purple_block_1. Steps 7-8 satisfy our constraint. Steps 9-10 achieve our goal. I don't see a more efficient way to solve this problem.

Therefore, the plan is:
```
unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1
putdown white_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 brown_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
pickup purple_block_1
putdown purple_block_1
unstack green_block_1 blue_block_1
stack green_block_1 purple_block_1
```
