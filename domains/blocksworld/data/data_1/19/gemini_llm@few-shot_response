Okay, let's break this down. We need to get green_block_1 on top of purple_block_1. Here's the initial state:

*   yellow_block_1 is on the table
*   blue_block_1 is on the table
*   purple_block_1 is on the table
*   brown_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1
*   grey_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
*   green_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
*   white_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
*   yellow_block_1 is clear
*   green_block_1 is clear
*   white_block_1 is clear
*   hand is empty

And the goal:

*   green_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1

We also have a constraint: At some point, we must be holding purple_block_1.

Here's the plan:

```
```
unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1
putdown white_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 brown_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
pickup purple_block_1
unstack green_block_1 blue_block_1
putdown green_block_1
stack green_block_1 purple_block_1
```
