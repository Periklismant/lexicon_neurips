I'll solve this planning problem step by step.

First, let me understand the initial state:
- purple_block_1 is on the table with grey_block_1 on top of it
- blue_block_1 is on the table with green_block_1 on top of it
- purple_block_2 is on the table with blue_block_2 on top of it, and black_block_1 on top of blue_block_2
- grey_block_1, black_block_1, and green_block_1 are clear
- The robot arm is not holding anything

The goal is to have green_block_1 on the table.

The constraints require:
1. At some point, the robot must be holding green_block_1
2. Before holding green_block_1, either black_block_1 must not be clear OR purple_block_2 must be clear

In the initial state, black_block_1 is clear and purple_block_2 is not clear (it has blue_block_2 on it). So to satisfy constraint 2, I need to either:
- Put something on black_block_1 so it's not clear, or
- Make purple_block_2 clear by removing blue_block_2 (which requires first removing black_block_1)

Let me plan the solution:

```
unstack green_block_1 blue_block_1
putdown green_block_1
```

This plan works because:
1. I unstack green_block_1 from blue_block_1, which means I'm holding green_block_1 (satisfying constraint 1)
2. Before holding green_block_1, black_block_1 is clear in the initial state, which satisfies constraint 2 (the constraint is satisfied because the second condition is false, making the overall condition true)
3. I then put green_block_1 on the table, achieving the goal
