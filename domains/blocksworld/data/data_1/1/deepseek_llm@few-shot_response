Let's break down the problem step by step to find an optimal plan that satisfies all the given conditions and constraints.

### Initial State:
- **On Table**: purple_block_1, blue_block_1, purple_block_2
- **On purple_block_1**: grey_block_1 (clear)
- **On purple_block_2**: blue_block_2, then black_block_1 (clear)
- **On blue_block_1**: green_block_1 (clear)
- **Holding**: nothing

### Goal:
- **green_block_1 is on the table**

### Constraints:
1. At some point, "you are holding green_block_1" must be true.
2. Before holding green_block_1, at least one of the following must be true:
   - "black_block_1 is not clear" (i.e., something is on top of it), or
   - "purple_block_2 is clear" (i.e., nothing is on top of it).

### Analysis:
- To move green_block_1 to the table, we need to pick it up from blue_block_1 and then put it down.
- To pick up green_block_1, it must be clear (which it is), and the arm must not be holding anything (which it isn't).
- However, before holding green_block_1, one of the two conditions involving black_block_1 or purple_block_2 must be met.
  - Currently, black_block_1 is clear (nothing on top), and purple_block_2 is not clear (blue_block_2 is on it).
  - So, the condition "purple_block_2 is clear" is not currently true, and "black_block_1 is not clear" is also not true.
  - Therefore, we need to make one of these conditions true before picking up green_block_1.

### Possible Actions to Satisfy Constraints:
1. Make "black_block_1 not clear":
   - To do this, we'd need to place a block on top of black_block_1. However, black_block_1 is currently on top of blue_block_2, and the only clear blocks are grey_block_1 and green_block_1.
   - Moving grey_block_1 or green_block_1 onto black_block_1 would satisfy this, but moving green_block_1 would directly help with the goal.
   - But we cannot move green_block_1 before satisfying the constraint, so this seems circular.

2. Make "purple_block_2 clear":
   - purple_block_2 currently has blue_block_2 on it, which in turn has black_block_1 on it.
   - To make purple_block_2 clear, we'd need to remove blue_block_2 from it.
   - To remove blue_block_2, we'd need to unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_2, then put down black_block_1, then unstack blue_block_2 from purple_block_2.
   - This would make purple_block_2 clear, satisfying the constraint before picking up green_block_1.

### Plan:
1. Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_2 (since black_block_1 is clear and the arm is empty).
   - Now holding black_block_1, blue_block_2 is clear.
2. Put down black_block_1 on the table.
   - Now black_block_1 is on the table, arm is empty.
3. Unstack blue_block_2 from purple_block_2 (since blue_block_2 is clear and the arm is empty).
   - Now holding blue_block_2, purple_block_2 is clear.
   - At this point, "purple_block_2 is clear" is true, satisfying the constraint for the next step.
4. Put down blue_block_2 on the table.
   - Now blue_block_2 is on the table, arm is empty.
5. Pick up green_block_1 from blue_block_1 (since green_block_1 is clear and the arm is empty).
   - Now holding green_block_1, blue_block_1 is clear.
6. Put down green_block_1 on the table.
   - Now green_block_1 is on the table, arm is empty, goal achieved.

### Final Plan:
```
```
unstack black_block_1 blue_block_2
putdown black_block_1
unstack blue_block_2 purple_block_2
putdown blue_block_2
pickup green_block_1
putdown green_block_1
```
