To solve this planning problem, we need to achieve the goal where "black_block_1 is clear" (i.e., there is no block on top of black_block_1). Currently, green_block_2 is on top of black_block_1, and yellow_block_3 is on top of green_block_2. 

Additionally, we must satisfy the constraint that at least one of the following conditions must hold in at least one state during the execution of the plan:
1. "you are holding grey_block_1", or
2. "grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3".

### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. **Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2**: This will make green_block_2 clear, and we will be holding yellow_block_3.
2. **Putdown yellow_block_3 on the table**: This will free the robotic arm and place yellow_block_3 on the table.
3. **Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1**: This will achieve the goal of making black_block_1 clear. However, we must also satisfy the constraint.
4. **Pickup grey_block_1**: This satisfies the constraint ("you are holding grey_block_1").
5. **Stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3**: This also satisfies the constraint ("grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3"), though the constraint is already satisfied by the previous action.

Here is the optimal plan that achieves the goal and satisfies the constraint:

```
```
unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2
putdown yellow_block_3
unstack green_block_2 black_block_1
pickup grey_block_1
stack grey_block_1 yellow_block_3
```
```
