Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to make sure that black_block_1 is clear in the final state. Right now, green_block_2 is on top of black_block_1. So to clear black_block_1, we need to remove green_block_2 from it. But there's also yellow_block_3 on top of green_block_2. So first, I need to handle yellow_block_3. 

Looking at the initial state, yellow_block_3 is on green_block_2 and is clear. So to move yellow_block_3, I can unstack it from green_block_2. But wait, the unstack action requires that I'm not holding anything, which I am not initially. So the first step would be to unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2. That gives me yellow_block_3 in hand. Then, I need to put it somewhere. The constraints require that in at least one state, either I'm holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3. Hmm, so maybe after moving yellow_block_3, I can place it on the table, but then I need to involve grey_block_1 somehow. Alternatively, maybe stack grey_block_1 on top of yellow_block_3 at some point.

Wait, let's break it down. The main goal is to clear black_block_1. So steps needed:

1. Remove yellow_block_3 from green_block_2.
   - Action: unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2. But wait, unstack requires that the block to be unstacked (yellow_block_3) is on top of green_block_2, which it is. Also, yellow_block_3 is clear, which it is. And the arm is empty. So that's possible. After this, the arm is holding yellow_block_3, and green_block_2 becomes clear.

2. Then, we need to remove green_block_2 from black_block_1. But green_block_2 is now clear (since we removed yellow_block_3). So we can unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. But wait, unstacking green_block_2 from black_block_1 would require that green_block_2 is on black_block_1, which it is, and that green_block_2 is clear, which it now is after step 1. So step 2: unstack green_block_2 black_block_1. Now the arm is holding green_block_2. Then, we can put it down on the table, which would make black_block_1 clear. But putting down green_block_2 would satisfy the goal once we put it down. Wait, but after step 2, after unstacking green_block_2, black_block_1 becomes clear. Wait, no. The effect of unstacking green_block_2 from black_block_1 is that green_block_2 is no longer on black_block_1, and black_block_1 becomes clear. Wait, the effects of unstack are: b1 is no longer on b2, b2 becomes clear, and you're holding b1. So after unstacking green_block_2 from black_block_1, black_block_1 is clear. So actually, once we perform the unstack action on green_block_2 and black_block_1, the goal is achieved immediately. But then we need to make sure that the plan satisfies the constraints.

Wait, the constraints say that in at least one state of the plan, either the arm is holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3. So the plan must include an action where either the grey_block is picked up or placed on yellow_block_3.

So let's think. The initial plan would be:

1. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2
2. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1 → this makes black_block_1 clear, achieving the goal.

But then, we need to satisfy the constraint. In this plan, there's no action involving grey_block_1. So this plan would not satisfy the constraints. Therefore, we need to include an action that either picks up grey_block_1 or stacks grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3.

So perhaps after step 1, when we have yellow_block_3 in hand, we can stack it onto grey_block_1? Wait, but grey_block_1 is on the table and clear. So if we stack yellow_block_3 onto grey_block_1, but then we need to hold yellow_block_3. Wait, step 1: after unstacking yellow_block_3 from green_block_2, we are holding it. Then, we could stack it onto grey_block_1. But stacking requires that grey_block_1 is clear, which it is. So step 2: stack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1. Then, we need to proceed to unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. But after stacking, the arm is empty again. So step 3: unstack green_block_2 black_block_1. Then, putdown green_block_2. But wait, after unstacking green_block_2, black_block_1 is already clear, so that's the goal. But the problem is whether the constraint is met. When we stack yellow_block_3 onto grey_block_1, the state after that action would have grey_block_1 with yellow_block_3 on top. But the constraint requires that in at least one state, either "holding grey_block_1" or "grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3". Wait, the constraint is that in at least one state, either of those is true. But stacking yellow_block_3 onto grey_block_1 would make yellow_block_3 on top of grey_block_1, not the other way around. So that's not meeting the constraint. The constraint needs grey_block_1 on top of yellow_block_3. So perhaps we need to stack grey_block_1 onto yellow_block_3. But to do that, we need to pick up grey_block_1. Let's see:

Alternative approach:

1. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2 → hold yellow_block_3.
2. putdown yellow_block_3 → now it's on the table, clear.
3. pickup grey_block_1 → since it's on the table and clear, and arm is empty.
4. stack grey_block_1 yellow_block_3 → but yellow_block_3 is on the table and clear. So stacking grey on top of yellow_block_3. Then, after this, grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3. That would satisfy the constraint's second condition (grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3). Then proceed to unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1.

But after step 4, the arm is empty. Then step 5: unstack green_block_2 black_block_1 → which achieves the goal.

So in this plan, step 4 would make grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3, which satisfies the constraint. Let's check the steps:

1. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2 → holding yellow_block_3.
2. putdown yellow_block_3 → on table. Now yellow_block_3 is clear.
3. pickup grey_block_1 → since it's on table and clear.
4. stack grey_block_1 yellow_block_3 → now grey is on yellow_block_3. This satisfies the constraint.
5. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1 → now black_block_1 is clear.

So the plan has 5 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way. Let's see. After step 1, we have yellow_block_3 in hand. Instead of putting it down, could we stack it onto grey_block_1? Then step 2 would be stack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1. But then, after that, grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3 on top. But the constraint requires grey_block_1 to be on top of yellow_block_3, which is not the case here. So that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe after step 1, we can pickup grey_block_1. But we can't, because we are already holding yellow_block_3. So we need to putdown yellow_block_3 first. Then pickup grey_block_1, then stack it on yellow_block_3. So steps:

1. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2
2. putdown yellow_block_3
3. pickup grey_block_1
4. stack grey_block_1 yellow_block_3 → satisfies the constraint
5. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1

But another approach: after step 1, when we have yellow_block_3 in hand, maybe stack it on some other block. But how would that help with the constraint? Unless we can use grey_block_1 in another way. Alternatively, maybe after moving green_block_2, but that's required for the goal.

Alternatively, maybe after unstacking green_block_2 from black_block_1 (which would immediately satisfy the goal), but then we need to handle the constraint. Wait, but if we do that first, then the constraint would not be met in the plan. Let me think.

Original initial state:

green_block_1 has yellow_block_1, which has yellow_block_2. black_block_1 has green_block_2, which has yellow_block_3. Grey_block_1 is alone.

To make black_block_1 clear, we need to remove green_block_2. To remove green_block_2, we need to first remove yellow_block_3 from it. So steps:

1. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2 → hold yellow_block_3. Now green_block_2 is clear.
2. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1 → now black_block_1 is clear. Goal achieved. Now the arm holds green_block_2.
3. Now, we need to meet the constraint. The plan's steps so far are 2 actions. But the constraint requires that in at least one state, either the arm is holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3. But in this plan, those actions don't involve grey_block_1. So we need to include an action that satisfies the constraint. So perhaps after achieving the goal, we can perform an action that involves grey_block_1. But since the problem requires the final state to have black_block_1 clear, but other blocks can be in any state as long as the constraints are met. So after step 2, the goal is achieved. Then, we can putdown green_block_2 somewhere, but that's not necessary. But the constraint needs to be met in at least one state. So maybe during the plan, after step 1, we could do something with grey_block_1.

Wait, but step 1: after unstacking yellow_block_3, we can put it down, then pickup grey_block_1. Then stack it on yellow_block_3, then proceed. Let's see:

Alternative plan:

1. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2 → hold Y3.
2. putdown Y3 → on table, clear.
3. pickup grey_block_1 → now holding G1.
4. stack grey_block_1 Y3 → G1 on Y3. Now, the constraint is satisfied here (state after step 4).
5. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1 → now black_block_1 is clear. Done.

This plan has 5 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way. Let me check another possibility.

After step 1: holding Y3. Instead of putting it down, can I stack it on grey_block_1? Then:

1. unstack Y3 green_block_2 → hold Y3.
2. stack Y3 grey_block_1 → Now Y3 is on grey_block_1. But grey_block_1 was on the table. So after this, grey_block_1 has Y3 on top, and the arm is empty. Then, unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. But the constraint requires that either the arm is holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 is on Y3. In this case, grey_block_1 is under Y3, so the constraint isn't met. So this doesn't help.

Alternatively, after step 1, can we pickup grey_block_1? No, because we are already holding Y3. So we need to putdown Y3 first.

So the steps I thought of earlier, with 5 actions, might be necessary. But let's see if there's a way to do it in fewer steps.

Wait, what if after unstacking Y3 from green_block_2 (step 1), we then stack Y3 onto grey_block_1 (step 2). That would make Y3 on grey_block_1. Then, the next step is to unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1 (step3). Now, the constraint requires that in some state, either holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 is on Y3. In this plan, after step2, grey_block_1 has Y3 on it, but the constraint is about grey being on Y3. So not met. So that doesn't satisfy the constraint.

Another idea: after unstacking Y3 from green_block_2 (step1), instead of putting it down, use it to stack grey_block_1 on top of Y3. But to stack grey_block_1 on Y3, we need to have grey_block_1 in hand. So:

1. unstack Y3 green_block_2 → hold Y3.
2. putdown Y3 → on table.
3. pickup grey_block_1 → now holding G1.
4. stack G1 Y3 → G1 on Y3. Now, in this state, G1 is on Y3. So the constraint is met here.
5. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1 → clears black_block_1.

So this is 5 steps. But maybe there's a way to combine steps.

Wait, what if after step1 (holding Y3), we putdown Y3 (step2), then pickup G1 (step3), stack G1 on Y3 (step4), then unstack green_block_2 (step5). So 5 steps.

Alternatively, can we do something after unstacking green_block_2 to involve grey_block_1? Suppose after unstacking green_block_2 (step2), we then put it down (step3), then pickup grey_block_1 (step4), and put it down again. But this would add steps without meeting the constraint.

Alternatively, maybe during the plan, after unstacking green_block_2, we can stack it on grey_block_1. But that's unnecessary and adds steps.

Hmm, maybe the optimal plan is 5 steps. Let's check if that's the minimal possible.

Alternatively, after step1 (unstack Y3), can we stack it on a different block where we can then involve grey_block_1? For example, stack Y3 on G1 (grey_block_1). Wait, no, Y3 is in hand after step1. If we stack Y3 on grey_block_1, that would place Y3 on grey_block_1. But the constraint requires grey_block_1 to be on Y3. So that's the reverse. So not helpful.

Another approach: Maybe after step1, instead of putting Y3 on the table, we can put it on top of another block that's already in a tower. But I don't see how that would help with the constraint.

Alternatively, perhaps after unstacking green_block_2, we can then pickup grey_block_1 and stack it somewhere. But after unstacking green_block_2, we're holding it. So:

Plan:

1. unstack Y3 green_block_2 → hold Y3.
2. stack Y3 grey_block_1 → Y3 on grey. Now grey is under Y3. Not helpful for constraint.
3. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1 → hold green_block_2. Now black is clear.
4. putdown green_block_2 → done.

But in this plan, the constraint isn't met. So no.

Alternatively:

1. unstack Y3 green_block_2 → hold Y3.
2. putdown Y3 → on table.
3. pickup grey_block_1 → hold G1.
4. stack G1 Y3 → G1 on Y3. Now constraint is met.
5. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1 → goal achieved.

This is 5 steps. But can we make it shorter?

What if after step1 (holding Y3), we do:

2. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1 → but can we do this? Because green_block_2 is clear now (after step1). Yes. So step1: unstack Y3 green_block_2 → hold Y3. Then step2: unstack green_block_2 black_block_1 → hold green_block_2. Now black_block_1 is clear. Goal achieved. Then, step3: putdown green_block_2. Then step4: stack Y3 grey_block_1. But this doesn't meet the constraint. Alternatively, step4: pickup grey_block_1. Then step5: stack grey_block_1 Y3. So in this plan, steps:

1. unstack Y3 green_block_2
2. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1 → goal achieved here.
3. putdown green_block_2
4. pickup grey_block_1
5. stack grey_block_1 Y3

This would satisfy the constraint in step5, but the plan is 5 steps. However, after step2, the goal is already achieved, but we need to include the constraint. But in this case, the steps after step2 are unnecessary for the goal but required to satisfy the constraint. Wait, but the problem states that the plan must bring about the goal and satisfy the constraints. So the constraints need to hold in at least one state during the plan execution. So the plan's steps after achieving the goal could still include actions that meet the constraint. But in this case, steps 4 and 5 would satisfy the constraint. However, this plan is longer than necessary. But maybe there's a way to meet the constraint earlier.

Wait, after step1, the arm is holding Y3. Then in step2, we unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. Then, we need to putdown green_block_2 (step3). Now, the arm is empty. Then in step4, we can pickup grey_block_1 (step4), then stack it on Y3 (step5). So in this plan, the constraint is met in step5. But the goal was already achieved in step2. So the plan length is 5. But perhaps there's a shorter way.

Wait, what if after step1 (holding Y3), we do step2: stack Y3 grey_block_1. Then, we have Y3 on grey_block_1. Then step3: unstack green_block_2 black_block_1. This gives a plan of 3 steps. But does the constraint hold in any state? The constraint is that in at least one state, either holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 is on Y3. In this plan, after step2, grey_block_1 has Y3 on top. So the constraint is not met. So this plan would not satisfy the constraint.

Another idea: After step1 (holding Y3), we putdown Y3 (step2). Then, pickup grey_block_1 (step3). Then, stack grey_block_1 on Y3 (step4). Then, unstack green_block_2 (step5). So this is 5 steps. But maybe after step4, we can unstack green_block_2 (step5). But after step4, we're empty-handed, so we can unstack green_block_2.

Alternatively, after step4, grey_block_1 is on Y3. Then, unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1 (step5). So plan steps:

1. unstack Y3 green_block_2 → hold Y3.
2. putdown Y3 → on table.
3. pickup grey_block_1 → hold G1.
4. stack G1 Y3 → G1 on Y3.
5. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1 → goal achieved.

This is 5 steps. The constraint is met at step4. So this plan is valid.

Is there a way to do it in 4 steps? Let's see:

1. unstack Y3 green_block_2 → hold Y3.
2. stack Y3 grey_block_1 → Y3 on G1. But this doesn't satisfy the constraint.
3. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1 → goal achieved.
4. pickup grey_block_1 → but after step3, we're holding green_block_2, so cannot pickup.

No, that's not possible. Another approach:

Wait, maybe after step1 (unstack Y3), we can unstack green_block_2 (step2), then putdown green_block_2 (step3), then pickup grey_block_1 (step4), and stack it on Y3 (step5). But again 5 steps.

Alternatively, after unstacking green_block_2 (step2), can we use it to stack grey_block_1? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the minimal plan is 5 steps. Because the constraint requires an additional action involving grey_block_1. So the initial steps needed to clear black_block_1 are 2 (unstack Y3, unstack green_block_2), but the constraint requires two more actions (pickup grey_block_1 and stack it on Y3), making total 4, but wait:

Wait, unstack Y3 green_block_2 (1), then unstack green_block_2 black_block_1 (2). Then, the goal is achieved. Now, to meet the constraint, we need to do something with grey_block_1. But in this case, the arm is holding green_block_2. So we can putdown green_block_2 (3), then pickup grey_block_1 (4), then stack it on Y3 (5). So total 5 steps. But in this plan, step5 is where the constraint is met.

Alternatively, after step2 (unstack green_block_2), can we stack it on grey_block_1? That would require grey_block_1 to be clear. Which it is. So step3: stack green_block_2 grey_block_1. Now, black_block_1 is clear (goal), and green_block_2 is on grey_block_1. But the constraint is not met. So we still need to do something else.

So perhaps the minimal plan is 5 steps. Therefore, the optimal plan would be:

```
unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2
putdown yellow_block_3
pickup grey_block_1
stack grey_block_1 yellow_block_3
unstack green_block_2 black_block_1
```
This is 5 steps. Let's check each step's preconditions and effects.

1. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2: preconditions are that yellow_block_3 is on green_block_2, clear, and arm is empty. All true initially. After this, arm holds yellow_block_3, green_block_2 is clear.

2. putdown yellow_block_3: since holding it, place it on table. Now yellow_block_3 is on table, clear.

3. pickup grey_block_1: grey is on table and clear, arm is empty. Valid. Now holding grey_block_1.

4. stack grey_block_1 yellow_block_3: holding grey, yellow_block_3 is clear. Stacking it. Now grey is on yellow_block_3. So in this state, the constraint is met (grey is on yellow_block_3).

5. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1: green_block_2 is on black_block_1, clear (since we unstacked yellow_block_3 earlier). Arm is empty. After unstacking, black_block_1 is clear (goal achieved).

Yes, this plan works. The constraint is satisfied during step4. The goal is achieved in step5. And the plan has 5 steps. Is there a shorter plan?

What if after step1 (unstack Y3), instead of putting it down, we pickup grey_block_1. But we can't, since we're holding Y3. So no.

Alternatively, after step1, stack Y3 on grey_block_1. Then, unstack green_block_2. But that doesn't help with the constraint.

Another way: After step1, putdown Y3, then unstack green_block_2. But then, after that, the goal is achieved. Then, to meet the constraint, we need to involve grey_block_1. So steps would be:

1. unstack Y3 green_block_2
2. putdown Y3
3. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1 → goal achieved
4. pickup grey_block_1 → arm empty before pickup, so valid.
5. stack grey_block_1 Y3 → meets constraint.

So this is also 5 steps. Same length as before.

Is there a way to do it in 4 steps? Let's think:

Suppose after step1 (unstack Y3), we do:

2. stack Y3 grey_block_1 → now Y3 is on grey_block_1. Then, step3: unstack green_block_2. But this doesn't meet the constraint. So no.

Alternatively:

1. unstack Y3 green_block_2
2. pickup grey_block_1 → but can't, because holding Y3. So no.

Hmm. So it seems that 5 steps is the minimal. Therefore, the plan provided earlier is optimal.
