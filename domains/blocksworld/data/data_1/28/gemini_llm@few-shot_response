Okay, let's break this down. The goal is to make black_block_1 clear. Currently, green_block_2 is on black_block_1, and yellow_block_3 is on green_block_2. So, we need to unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2, then unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. We also need to satisfy the constraint about grey_block_1.

Here's the plan:

```
```
unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2
putdown yellow_block_3
unstack green_block_2 black_block_1
putdown green_block_2
pickup grey_block_1
stack grey_block_1 yellow_block_3
```
