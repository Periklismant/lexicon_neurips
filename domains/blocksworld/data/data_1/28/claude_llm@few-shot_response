I'll solve this planning problem step by step.

First, let me understand the initial state:
- green_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top of it, and yellow_block_2 on top of yellow_block_1
- black_block_1 is on the table with green_block_2 on top of it, and yellow_block_3 on top of green_block_2
- grey_block_1 is on the table and clear
- yellow_block_2, yellow_block_3, and grey_block_1 are clear
- The robot arm is not holding anything

The goal is to make black_block_1 clear, which means removing green_block_2 and yellow_block_3 from it.

The constraint requires that at some point either:
- The robot arm holds grey_block_1, or
- grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3

Let me plan the solution:

```
pickup grey_block_1
stack grey_block_1 yellow_block_3
unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2
putdown yellow_block_3
unstack green_block_2 black_block_1
putdown green_block_2
```

This plan:
1. Picks up grey_block_1 from the table (satisfying part of the constraint)
2. Stacks grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3 (satisfying the other part of the constraint)
3. Unstacks yellow_block_3 (with grey_block_1 on top) from green_block_2
4. Puts down yellow_block_3 (with grey_block_1 still on top)
5. Unstacks green_block_2 from black_block_1
6. Puts down green_block_2

After these steps, black_block_1 is clear, which achieves our goal, and we've satisfied the constraint by both holding grey_block_1 and placing it on top of yellow_block_3.
