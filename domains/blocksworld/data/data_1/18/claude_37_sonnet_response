Alright, let's break down the problem:

We have a Blocksworld problem with a set of blocks. The initial state is:
- white_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
- blue_block_2 is on top of white_block_2
- red_block_1, grey_block_1, and blue_block_2 are clear
- no block is being held

The goal is simple: get blue_block_2 on the table.

But there are constraints:
1. At some point in the plan, red_block_1 should not be on top of white_block_1.
2. If, at any point, red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, then from that point onwards, white_block_2 should be on the table.

Let's visualize the initial state:

```
    blue_block_2
       /
  white_block_2
       /
   blue_block_1     red_block_1
       /               /
white_block_1    purple_block_1    grey_block_1
       |               |               |
    TABLE           TABLE           TABLE
```

And the goal state is:

```
blue_block_2
    |
  TABLE
```

The main objective is to get blue_block_2 on the table. However, the constraints mentioned suggest we need to be careful about the order of actions.

Let's think about the first constraint: at some point, "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" should hold. Looking at the initial state, red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1, not white_block_1. So, this condition already holds in the initial state.

The second constraint is: if "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" holds at some state, then "white_block_2 is on the table" must hold at that state or at some state after it. Since the first condition already holds in the initial state, we need to ensure white_block_2 is on the table at some point.

Given our goal to get blue_block_2 on the table, we would naturally need to unstack the blocks above it. So, let's start by coming up with a plan:

1. Unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2.
2. Putdown blue_block_2 on the table.

Wait, but this doesn't ensure white_block_2 is on the table, which we need because red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 from the very beginning. So, we need to ensure white_block_2 is on the table at some point.

Let's refine our plan:
1. Unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2.
2. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1.
3. Putdown white_block_2 on the table.
4. Putdown blue_block_2 on the table.

Wait, I realized I made a mistake. I said "From the beginning, red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1."  But I should be more precise. 

Let's define the initial configuration more precisely:

- white_block_1 is on the table.
- blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1.
- white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1.
- blue_block_2 is on top of white_block_2.
- purple_block_1 is on the table.
- red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1.
- grey_block_1 is on the table.

So:
- The tower 1: blue_block_2 on white_block_2 on blue_block_1 on white_block_1 on table.
- The tower 2: red_block_1 on purple_block_1 on table.
- The tower 3: grey_block_1 on table.

From the original state, the condition "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is indeed true, because red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1, not white_block_1.

Since that condition is true from the beginning, we need to ensure that "white_block_2 is on the table" at some point. Additionally, our ultimate goal is to have "blue_block_2 is on the table".

Now, let's plan:

1. Unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2.
2. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1.
3. Putdown white_block_2 on the table.
4. Putdown blue_block_2 on the table.

This satisfies both constraints and achieves our goal.

But actually, I just realized I can't execute this plan. When I unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2, I'm holding blue_block_2. I'd need to do something with it before I can unstack white_block_2.

Let's reconsider our options:
1. Unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2.
2. Putdown blue_block_2.
3. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1.
4. Putdown white_block_2.

This seems to satisfy our constraints and goal. 

Let's check:
- Constraint 1: "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" - This is true from the beginning, and throughout the plan, red_block_1 remains on top of purple_block_1.
- Constraint 2: "If red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, then white_block_2 should be on the table" - At the end of step 4, white_block_2 is on the table, satisfying this constraint.
- Goal: "blue_block_2 is on the table" - After step 2, blue_block_2 is on the table, achieving our goal.

Actually let me double check the details. Let's try to execute the plan:

1. Unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2. (Now, we're holding blue_block_2.)
2. Put down blue_block_2 on the table. (Now, we're not holding anything, and blue_block_2 is on the table.)
3. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1. (Now, we're holding white_block_2.)
4. Put down white_block_2 on the table. (Now, we're not holding anything, and white_block_2 is on the table.)

Great, this works, and our goal is met. blue_block_2 is on the table, satisfying our goal. At the same time, the constraint "If red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, then white_block_2 should be on the table" is fulfilled because, after the plan, white_block_2 is on the table.

In fact, we could have an even shorter plan, where we only do the first two steps, since our goal is only to get blue_block_2 on the table. But that would violate the constraint 2, which requires white_block_2 to be on the table if red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1. Since red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 from the initial state, white_block_2 needs to be on the table at some point.

So, the optimal plan for this problem is:

1. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2
2. putdown blue_block_2
3. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1
4. putdown white_block_2

Actually, let's double check constraint 2 to see if we're interpreting it correctly. It says: "If expression "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" holds in some state s, then expression "white_block_2 is on the table" must hold at s or at some state after s."

This means that whenever "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is true (which it is from the start), then from that state onwards, white_block_2 needs to be on the table at some point.

With our current plan, after step 4, white_block_2 is on the table, which satisfies the constraint.

So, the optimal plan for this problem is:

1. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2 
2. putdown blue_block_2  
3. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1  
4. putdown white_block_2  

Is this the most optimal way? Let's check if we can achieve our goal in fewer than 4 steps.

Given the initial state, to have blue_block_2 on the table, we need to at least:
1. Unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2.
2. Putdown blue_block_2 on the table.

But this would only satisfy the goal, and not the additional constraint of having white_block_2 on the table. So, we also need:
3. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1.
4. Putdown white_block_2 on the table.

So, the minimum number of steps required is 4, and our plan achieves that.

Actually, I just realized that I'm interpreting constraint 2 incorrectly. Let me see exactly what it is again: "If expression "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" holds in some state s, then expression "white_block_2 is on the table" must hold at s or at some state after s."

Given this constraint, since "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is true from the beginning, we need to ensure "white_block_2 is on the table" at some state during or after the plan. This is satisfied by our 4-step plan, as white_block_2 is on the table after step 4.

Wait, I am confused. Let me check:
White block 2 is on the table after step 4 of our plan.
Is the condition "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" true in the initial state? Yes, in the initial state, red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1, not white_block_1.

So, from the beginning, the condition for Constraint 2 is met. This means we must have white_block_2 on the table at some point in the plan. Our 4-step plan ensures this, so it's compliant.

The optimal plan for this problem is:

1. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2
2. putdown blue_block_2
3. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1
4. putdown white_block_2

This plan achieves the goal (blue_block_2 on the table) and satisfies the constraint (white_block_2 on the table).

Actually, let me look at constraint 1 again: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1""

Ah, the constraint says "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" must hold in at least one state during the execution of the plan. If that's the case, then we should check if this condition holds in our initial state or during the execution of our plan.

The initial state says:
- "red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1"

So in the initial state, red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 (it's on top of purple_block_1).

This means the first condition is already met in the initial state. Therefore, for the second condition, we need to ensure white_block_2 is on the table at some point, as we've derived. Our 4-step plan ensures this, so it's compliant.

The optimal plan remains the same.

Actually, I just realize I'm still a bit confused about constraint 1. Let's re-read it: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1""

This seems to be a requirement that, at some point during our plan's execution, red_block_1 should not be on top of white_block_1. Given the initial state, this condition is already satisfied (since red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1). So Constraint 1 is satisfied from the start and throughout our plan.

And just to be sure about Constraint 2: "If expression "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" holds in some state s, then expression "white_block_2 is on the table" must hold at s or at some state after s."

Since "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is true from the beginning, as per Constraint 2, we need to ensure white_block_2 is on the table at some state during or after our plan. Our 4-step plan ensures this, so it's also compliant with Constraint 2.

Therefore, our plan works. Let's summarize the plan in the specified format.

Actually, wait. I need to double check the initial state to make sure I'm not making any mistakes:

- white_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
- blue_block_2 is on top of white_block_2
- red_block_1, grey_block_1, and blue_block_2 are clear
- no block is being held

So, in the initial state, red_block_1 is sitting on top of purple_block_1. The only relevant point for constraint 1 is that red_block_1 is NOT on top of white_block_1 in the initial state (because it's on top of purple_block_1). So, constraint 1 is immediately satisfied.

The visual from before is accurate:

```
    blue_block_2
       /
  white_block_2
       /
   blue_block_1     red_block_1
       /               /
white_block_1    purple_block_1    grey_block_1
       |               |               |
    TABLE           TABLE           TABLE
```

For constraint 2: Since "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" from the start (it's on purple_block_1), we need to ensure "white_block_2 is on the table" at some point in the plan. Our 4-step plan achieves this.

So, our optimal plan is:

1. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2
2. putdown blue_block_2
3. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1
4. putdown white_block_2

And our goal of having blue_block_2 on the table is achieved.
