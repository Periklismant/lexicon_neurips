Okay, let's break this down. We need to get blue_block_2 on the table. Currently, blue_block_2 is on top of white_block_2, which is on top of blue_block_1, which is on top of white_block_1. Also, red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1. We have two constraints to satisfy. The first one requires that at some point red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1. The second one requires that if red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, then white_block_2 must be on the table at that state or some state after that.

Here's the plan:

```
```
unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2
putdown blue_block_2
```
