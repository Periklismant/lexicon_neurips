Let's break down the problem step by step to find an optimal plan that satisfies all the given constraints.

### Initial State:
- **On Table**: white_block_1, purple_block_1, grey_block_1
- **On white_block_1**: blue_block_1
- **On blue_block_1**: white_block_2
- **On white_block_2**: blue_block_2
- **On purple_block_1**: red_block_1 (clear)
- **Clear**: red_block_1, grey_block_1, blue_block_2
- **Holding**: nothing

### Goal:
- blue_block_2 is on the table.

### Constraints:
1. At least once, "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" must hold. Currently, red_block_1 is on purple_block_1, so this is already true initially. However, we must ensure that if this condition is ever made false (i.e., red_block_1 is moved to white_block_1), then white_block_2 must be on the table at that state or later.
2. Since the condition is already true initially, we don't need to worry about making it false, but we must ensure that if it becomes false at any point, the second part of the constraint is satisfied.

### Plan to achieve the goal:
To get blue_block_2 on the table, we need to unstack it from white_block_2. But white_block_2 is under blue_block_2, so we can directly unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2 and then put it down on the table.

However, we must also ensure that the constraints are satisfied. Since the first constraint is already satisfied initially (red_block_1 is not on white_block_1), we don't need to do anything extra unless we move red_block_1 to white_block_1, which we don't need to do for this goal. Thus, the simplest plan is to just unstack blue_block_2 and put it down.

### Optimal Plan:
```
```
unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2
putdown blue_block_2
```
```

### Verification:
1. **Initial State**: red_block_1 is not on white_block_1 (constraint satisfied).
2. **After unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2**: 
   - Holding: blue_block_2
   - white_block_2 is clear.
   - red_block_1 is still not on white_block_1.
3. **After putdown blue_block_2**:
   - blue_block_2 is on the table (goal achieved).
   - red_block_1 is still not on white_block_1.
   - white_block_2 is not on the table, but since we didn't make "red_block_1 is not on white_block_1" false, the second part of the constraint doesn't need to be enforced.

Thus, the plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal optimally.
