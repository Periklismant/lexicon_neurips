I'll solve this planning problem step by step.

First, let me analyze the initial state and goal:
- Initial state: blue_block_2 is on top of white_block_2, which is on top of blue_block_1, which is on top of white_block_1
- Goal: blue_block_2 is on the table

I also need to consider the constraints:
1. "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" must hold in at least one state
2. If "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" holds, then "white_block_2 is on the table" must hold in that state or a later state

Looking at the initial state, red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1, not on white_block_1, so the first constraint is already satisfied. For the second constraint, I need to ensure white_block_2 is on the table at some point.

Let me plan the steps to get blue_block_2 to the table:

```
unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2
putdown blue_block_2
```

This achieves our goal of having blue_block_2 on the table. However, I still need to satisfy the second constraint by putting white_block_2 on the table. Since I've already removed blue_block_2 from white_block_2, I can continue:

```
unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2
putdown blue_block_2
unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1
putdown white_block_2
```

This plan achieves the goal and satisfies both constraints. The plan is optimal as it uses the minimum number of actions needed to get blue_block_2 to the table while ensuring white_block_2 is also on the table.
