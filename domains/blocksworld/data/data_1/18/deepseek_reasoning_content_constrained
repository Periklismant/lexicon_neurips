Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld planning problem. The goal is to get blue_block_2 onto the table. But there are some constraints to consider. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the goal, then figure out the steps needed while respecting the constraints.

First, the initial state: 

- white_block_1 is on the table with blue_block_1 on it, then white_block_2 on blue_block_1, and blue_block_2 on top of white_block_2. So that's a stack: white_block_1 (table) → blue_block_1 → white_block_2 → blue_block_2.
- purple_block_1 is on the table with red_block_1 on top. Both are clear because nothing is on red_block_1 or purple_block_1.
- grey_block_1 is alone on the table, clear.
- The arm is empty.

The goal is to have blue_block_2 on the table. So, we need to move blue_block_2 down. But blue_block_2 is currently on white_block_2, which is on blue_block_1. So to get blue_block_2 to the table, we have to unstack it. But before that, we need to make sure that blue_block_2 is clear. Wait, in the initial state, it's stated that blue_block_2 is clear. So we can unstack it immediately? Wait, no. To unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2, the preconditions are that blue_block_2 is on white_block_2, blue_block_2 is clear (which it is), and the arm is empty. So maybe the first action is unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2. Then put it down. But let's check.

Wait, unstacking blue_block_2 from white_block_2 would require that blue_block_2 is on white_block_2, which it is, and that blue_block_2 is clear (which it is), and the arm is empty (which it is). So yes, first action could be unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2. Then putdown blue_block_2. That would achieve the goal in two steps. But wait, the constraints might complicate things.

Constraints:

1. The first constraint is that in at least one state, red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1. Initially, red_block_1 is on purple_block_1, so it's not on white_block_1. Wait, the initial state says red_block_1 is on purple_block_1. So in the initial state, "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is already true. Does that satisfy the first constraint? Wait, the initial state already meets the condition. But maybe the problem requires that this condition holds in at least one state during the plan. But if the initial state already satisfies it, then the constraint is automatically satisfied. However, maybe the problem is that the plan must include an action that causes this condition, but if it's already true, maybe we don't need to do anything. Wait, but the problem says "must hold in at least one state". If the initial state already satisfies that, then any plan that doesn't undo it would be okay. But wait, if the plan doesn't involve moving red_block_1, then red_block_1 remains on purple_block_1, so the condition remains true. But maybe the problem's initial state has red_block_1 on top of purple_block_1, so it's not on white_block_1. So the initial state already meets the first constraint. Therefore, any valid plan would automatically satisfy the first constraint as long as the initial state is considered. But perhaps the problem is designed so that the initial state does not meet the first constraint, but in this case, the initial state does meet it. Wait, let's recheck the problem statement.

The original state says: red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1. So "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is true in the initial state. Therefore, the first constraint is already satisfied in the initial state. So the plan just needs to not violate the second constraint. Wait, the second constraint is: If "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" holds in some state s, then "white_block_2 is on the table" must hold at s or some state after s. Since the initial state s0 has "red_block_1 not on white_block_1" (it's on purple_block_1), then we must ensure that in s0 or any state after s0, white_block_2 is on the table. But the initial state has white_block_2 on top of blue_block_1. So white_block_2 is not on the table in s0. Therefore, the constraint requires that after s0 (since in s0, the condition holds), white_block_2 must be on the table at some state after s0. Therefore, even if the plan only moves blue_block_2, we have to make sure that white_block_2 is placed on the table at some point after the initial state. Because the condition is triggered by the initial state. Because in s0, "red not on white" is true, and in s0, white_block_2 is not on the table, so the constraint requires that white_block_2 is on the table in some state after s0. So even if the original plan would be to just unstack and putdown blue_block_2, that plan would not satisfy the constraint because white_block_2 is never put on the table. Therefore, we have to include steps that put white_block_2 on the table.

So the problem is that even though the initial state meets the first constraint, because of the second constraint, we need to make sure that white_block_2 is on the table at some point after the initial state.

Therefore, the plan must include moving white_block_2 to the table. But how?

Let's outline the steps needed to get blue_block_2 on the table. Blue_block_2 is on white_block_2. To move blue_block_2 to the table, we can unstack it and put it down. But white_block_2 is under blue_block_2. After moving blue_block_2, white_block_2 remains on blue_block_1. But according to the constraint, we need to have white_block_2 on the table at some point. So maybe after moving blue_block_2, we have to move white_block_2 to the table. But that would require unstacking white_block_2 from blue_block_1, which is possible if blue_block_1 is clear. But blue_block_1 initially has white_block_2 on top, which is under blue_block_2. Wait, initial stack is white_block_1 (table) → blue_block_1 → white_block_2 → blue_block_2. So blue_block_1 has white_block_2 on top. To unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1, we need to first remove blue_block_2. But if blue_block_2 is already on the table, then white_block_2 would be clear. Wait, but in the initial plan, if we unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2, then blue_block_2 is in the arm, then we put it down. Then white_block_2 is clear. So white_block_2 is on blue_block_1. Then we can unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1, then put it down. That would satisfy the constraint that white_block_2 is on the table at some state after the initial state. But is that necessary?

So, let's see. The constraint says: If in some state s, red_block_1 is not on white_block_1, then in s or a subsequent state, white_block_2 must be on the table. Since the initial state s0 already has red_block_1 not on white_block_1, we must have white_block_2 on the table in s0 or later. s0: white_block_2 is not on the table, so the plan must include a state where white_block_2 is on the table. Therefore, the plan must include moving white_block_2 to the table. So even if the goal is only to get blue_block_2 on the table, we have to also put white_block_2 on the table to satisfy the constraint.

So the plan must have steps to unstack blue_block_2, put it down, then unstack white_block_2 and put it down. But let's see if that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe moving white_block_2 after moving blue_block_2. Let's think through:

1. Unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2. Now, holding blue_block_2. White_block_2 is clear.
2. Putdown blue_block_2. Now, blue_block_2 is on the table. This achieves the goal. But then, we need to move white_block_2. So next steps would be:
3. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1. Because now white_block_2 is clear. Then put it down. Now white_block_2 is on the table. So in this plan, after step 3, white_block_2 is on the table. So the constraint is satisfied because after the initial state (s0), there is a state (after step 3) where white_block_2 is on the table. So that's good.

But wait, the goal is only to have blue_block_2 on the table. So steps 1 and 2 achieve the goal. But the problem requires that the plan satisfies all constraints. So even though steps 1 and 2 achieve the goal, they don't satisfy the constraint unless white_block_2 is put on the table in some subsequent state. Therefore, the plan must include moving white_block_2 to the table. So the minimal plan would be steps 1, 2, 3, 4 (putdown white_block_2). So four actions. But let's check if that's the case.

Alternatively, could there be a shorter plan that also satisfies the constraints? Let's see. For example, if in the process of moving blue_block_2, white_block_2 is also moved. But how? Let me think.

Wait, another approach: Maybe stack blue_block_2 onto some other block, but the goal is to have it on the table. So that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps moving red_block_1 onto white_block_1 would violate the first constraint? Wait, but the first constraint requires that in at least one state, red_block_1 is not on white_block_1. But if we move red_block_1 onto white_block_1, then in that state, the condition would not hold. But since the initial state already satisfies the constraint, the plan can include moving red_block_1, but as long as there is at least one state where the condition holds. However, moving red_block_1 onto white_block_1 would create a state where the condition doesn't hold, but the constraint is that there must be at least one state where it does. Since the initial state is part of the plan, the constraint is already satisfied. Wait, no. The constraint says that the expression must hold in at least one state during the plan. So even if later you move red_block_1 to white_block_1, as long as in some state (like the initial state) the condition holds, it's okay. So maybe that's allowed, but we need to make sure that the second constraint is met.

But in this problem, since the initial state already satisfies the first constraint, maybe we don't need to do anything else regarding the first constraint. However, the second constraint says that whenever the condition (red not on white) holds in a state s, then white_block_2 must be on the table in s or after. So in the initial state, the condition holds (red is not on white), so in s0, white_block_2 is not on the table, so the plan must have white_block_2 on the table in some state after s0. Therefore, regardless of other actions, the plan must include moving white_block_2 to the table. So even if the goal is achieved in two steps, we need two more steps to move white_block_2. So the minimal plan length would be four steps.

Wait, but what if during the process of moving blue_block_2, we also end up moving white_block_2? Let's see. Suppose we unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2 (step 1). Then, instead of putting it down, maybe stack it somewhere else. But the goal requires it to be on the table. So we need to put it down. So steps 1 and 2 are necessary. Then steps 3 and 4 to move white_block_2. So total of four steps.

Alternatively, is there a way to combine actions to get white_block_2 on the table while doing other things? For example, after unstacking blue_block_2, can we unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1 before putting down blue_block_2? Let's see:

1. Unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2. Now holding blue_block_2.
2. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1. Wait, can't do that because the arm is holding blue_block_2. So we need to put down blue_block_2 first.

So step 1: unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2 (arm holds blue_block_2)
step 2: putdown blue_block_2 (now blue_block_2 is on table, arm is empty)
step 3: unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1 (arm holds white_block_2)
step 4: putdown white_block_2.

So that's four steps. This satisfies the goal (blue_block_2 is on table) and the constraints. Because after the initial state (s0), white_block_2 is moved to the table in step 4.

Alternatively, is there a shorter plan? Let's think. Suppose we can stack blue_block_2 onto another block, but the goal requires it on the table. So no. Or maybe we can unstack white_block_2 first. But initially, white_block_2 is under blue_block_2. So to unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1, we need to first remove blue_block_2. So steps 1 and 2 must come before steps 3 and 4.

Another angle: The constraints don't require that white_block_2 stays on the table, just that at some point after the initial state, it is on the table. So even if we put it down and then move it again, that's okay. But the minimal plan would be to put it down once.

Therefore, the plan would be:

unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2
putdown blue_block_2
unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1
putdown white_block_2

This is four actions. Let's check if each action is valid.

Step 1: unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2. Preconditions: blue_block_2 is on white_block_2, blue_block_2 is clear (it is), arm is empty (yes). So valid. Effect: arm holds blue_block_2, white_block_2 is clear.

Step 2: putdown blue_block_2. Precondition: holding it. Yes. Effect: blue_block_2 is on table, clear, arm empty.

Step 3: unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1. Preconditions: white_block_2 is on blue_block_1 (yes, after step 1, blue_block_2 was removed), white_block_2 is clear (yes, after step 1), arm is empty (yes, after step 2). So valid. Effect: arm holds white_block_2, blue_block_1 becomes clear.

Step 4: putdown white_block_2. Precondition: holding it. Yes. Effect: white_block_2 is on table, clear, arm empty.

This plan satisfies the goal (blue_block_2 is on table) and the constraints. The first constraint is satisfied because in the initial state, red_block_1 is not on white_block_1. The second constraint requires that whenever red_block_1 is not on white_block_1 (which is true in all states here, since red_block_1 is on purple_block_1 throughout the plan), then white_block_2 must be on the table in some state after. In this plan, after step 4, white_block_2 is on the table, so the constraint is satisfied.

Is there a shorter plan? Let's see. Suppose we can combine steps. For example, after unstacking blue_block_2, can we stack it somewhere else? No, because the goal is to have it on the table. So putdown is necessary. Alternatively, after unstacking white_block_2, can we put it down immediately. Yes, which is what the plan does. So four steps seems minimal. Any fewer steps would not achieve both the goal and the constraints. For example, three steps: unstack, putdown, unstack. But then white_block_2 is in the arm and not on the table. So the third step would be unstack, but then you need to put it down. So four steps is necessary.

Therefore, the optimal plan is four actions as outlined.
