I'll solve this planning problem step by step.

First, let me understand the initial state:
- Tower 1: purple_block_1 (bottom), brown_block_1, yellow_block_1, white_block_1 (top)
- purple_block_2 is alone on the table and clear
- black_block_1 is alone on the table and clear
- orange_block_1 is alone on the table and clear
- The arm is empty

The goal is to be holding orange_block_1.

The constraints require:
1. At some point, orange_block_1 must not be on the table
2. Before orange_block_1 leaves the table, either yellow_block_1 must be on top of white_block_1 OR black_block_1 must not be on the table

Let me plan this:

1. First, I need to satisfy the second constraint by either:
   - Placing yellow_block_1 on top of white_block_1, or
   - Picking up black_block_1 from the table

2. Then I can pick up orange_block_1 to achieve the goal

The most efficient approach is to pick up black_block_1 first:

```
pickup black_block_1
putdown black_block_1
pickup orange_block_1
```

This plan works because:
1. We first pick up black_block_1, satisfying "black_block_1 is not on the table"
2. We put it back down (this step is technically optional but maintains the constraint)
3. We pick up orange_block_1, which satisfies both the goal and the constraint that "orange_block_1 is not on the table"
