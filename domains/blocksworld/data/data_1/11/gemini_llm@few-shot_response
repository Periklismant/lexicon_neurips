Okay, let's break this down. We need to be holding `orange_block_1`. The constraints tell us that `orange_block_1` must be picked up at some point, and before that happens, either `yellow_block_1` must be on `white_block_1` or `black_block_1` must not be on the table. `yellow_block_1` is already on top of `white_block_1` in the initial state, so we can proceed with picking up `orange_block_1`.

Here's the plan:

```
pickup orange_block_1
