Okay, let's see. The problem is to get the robotic arm to hold the orange_block_1. The initial state has several blocks arranged in different places. Let me start by understanding the initial setup.

So, looking at the original state:

- purple_block_1 is on the table with brown_block_1 on top of it, then yellow_block_1 on brown, and white_block_1 on yellow. So there's a stack: purple_block_1 -> brown_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 -> white_block_1. But wait, the white_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, and white is clear. So the top of that stack is white_block_1, which is clear. Then, purple_block_2, black_block_1, and orange_block_1 are all on the table and clear. Also, the arm is empty.

The goal is to have the arm holding orange_block_1. So the plan needs to end with the arm holding that block. Since orange_block_1 is on the table and clear initially, the simplest way is to perform a pickup action on it. But wait, are there any blocks on top of orange_block_1? No, the initial state says orange_block_1 is clear. So the preconditions for picking it up should be met. Let me check the preconditions for "pickup x": 

1. x is on the table. Orange_block_1 is on the table. Check.
2. x is clear. Yes, since nothing is on top of it. Check.
3. The arm is not holding anything. The initial state says the arm is empty. Check.

So, in theory, the arm can just do "pickup orange_block_1" directly. But wait, is there any reason that's not possible? Let me double-check the initial state. The orange_block_1 is on the table and clear, and the arm is empty. So yes, "pickup orange_block_1" should be the only action needed. That would make the arm hold it, satisfying the goal. 

But wait, the problem says "provide an optimal plan, i.e., a valid plan whose length is equal or less than the length of any other valid plan." So the optimal plan here is just one action: pickup orange_block_1. That seems too straightforward, but maybe that's correct. Let me confirm.

Is there any hidden issue? For example, maybe orange_block_1 is under another block? No, the initial state says it's on the table and clear. So nothing is on top of it. So the preconditions for pickup are met. Therefore, the plan is just one step. So the answer should be:

```
pickup orange_block_1
```

But let me make sure there are no typos in the block's name. The problem states the blocks include "orange_block_1", so the action should be exactly "pickup orange_block_1". Yep. So that's the optimal plan.
