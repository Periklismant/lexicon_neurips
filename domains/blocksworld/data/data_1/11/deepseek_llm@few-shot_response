Let's break down the problem step by step to find an optimal plan that meets all the given conditions.

### Initial State:
- **Blocks on the table**: purple_block_1, purple_block_2, black_block_1, orange_block_1
- **Tower 1**: purple_block_1 (on table) -> brown_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 -> white_block_1
- **Clear blocks**: purple_block_2, black_block_1, orange_block_1, white_block_1
- **Holding**: nothing

### Goal:
- **Holding**: orange_block_1

### Constraints:
1. At some point, "orange_block_1 is not on the table" must hold.
2. If "orange_block_1 is not on the table" holds, then earlier there must be a state where either:
   - "yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" or
   - "black_block_1 is not on the table".

### Plan:
To satisfy the constraints, we need to ensure that at some point, orange_block_1 is not on the table (i.e., it is being held or stacked on another block). Additionally, before this happens, one of the two conditions must be met.

#### Step 1: Satisfy the precondition for the constraint.
We need to ensure that either "yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" or "black_block_1 is not on the table" holds before orange_block_1 is not on the table.

- "yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" is not true initially (white_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1).
- "black_block_1 is not on the table" can be achieved by picking up black_block_1.

So, let's pick up black_block_1 first to satisfy the constraint precondition.

#### Step 2: Make orange_block_1 not on the table.
After picking up black_block_1, we can put it down or stack it somewhere. To make orange_block_1 not on the table, we can pick it up.

However, we need to ensure that the constraint precondition is met before orange_block_1 is not on the table. Picking up black_block_1 satisfies this.

#### Final Plan:
1. Pick up black_block_1 (satisfies the constraint precondition: "black_block_1 is not on the table").
2. Put down black_block_1 (optional, but we don't need it for the goal).
3. Pick up orange_block_1 (now "orange_block_1 is not on the table" holds, and the precondition was met earlier).

However, the goal is just to hold orange_block_1, so we can skip putting down black_block_1 if we don't need to. But since the constraint requires "orange_block_1 is not on the table" at some point, and picking it up satisfies that, we can directly pick it up after picking up black_block_1.

But the optimal plan would be to pick up black_block_1 (satisfying the constraint precondition) and then pick up orange_block_1 (satisfying the goal and the constraint).

However, the constraint says that the precondition must hold in an earlier state, not necessarily immediately before. So the minimal plan is:

1. Pick up black_block_1 (satisfies the constraint precondition).
2. Put down black_block_1 (optional, but keeps the world tidy).
3. Pick up orange_block_1 (goal).

But since the goal is just to hold orange_block_1, and the constraint is satisfied by picking up black_block_1, we can also consider:

1. Pick up black_block_1 (satisfies the constraint precondition).
2. Pick up orange_block_1 (goal).

But we can't pick up orange_block_1 while holding black_block_1, so this is invalid. Thus, the correct minimal plan is:

1. Pick up black_block_1 (satisfies the constraint precondition).
2. Put down black_block_1.
3. Pick up orange_block_1 (goal).

This satisfies all constraints and is optimal (3 actions).

### Final Plan:
```
```
pickup black_block_1
putdown black_block_1
pickup orange_block_1
```
```
