Let's break down the problem:

1. We have a blocksworld scenario with 7 blocks: `purple_block_1`, `brown_block_1`, `yellow_block_1`, `purple_block_2`, `black_block_1`, `orange_block_1`, and `white_block_1`.

2. The initial state is:
   - `purple_block_1` is on the table.
   - `brown_block_1` is on top of `purple_block_1`.
   - `yellow_block_1` is on top of `brown_block_1`.
   - `white_block_1` is on top of `yellow_block_1`.
   - `purple_block_2` is on the table and is clear.
   - `black_block_1` is on the table and is clear.
   - `orange_block_1` is on the table and is clear.
   - The arm is not holding any block.

3. The goal is to have the arm holding `orange_block_1`.

4. There are additional constraints:
   - At some point, `orange_block_1` should not be on the table.
   - Before `orange_block_1` is not on the table, either `yellow_block_1` should be on top of `white_block_1` OR `black_block_1` should not be on the table.

Given the constraints, we need to execute a plan where:
1. We ensure either `yellow_block_1` is on top of `white_block_1` OR `black_block_1` is not on the table.
2. Then, we ensure `orange_block_1` is not on the table.
3. Finally, we ensure the arm is holding `orange_block_1`.

Let's think about how to satisfy the first constraint. Initially, `yellow_block_1` is on top of `brown_block_1` and `white_block_1` is on top of `yellow_block_1`. We need to reposition them such that `yellow_block_1` is on top of `white_block_1`, or we need to ensure `black_block_1` is not on the table.

Let's go for the simplest solution. We can satisfy the first constraint by picking up `black_block_1` from the table:

1. `unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1` (to pick up `white_block_1` from `yellow_block_1`)
2. `putdown white_block_1` (to place `white_block_1` on the table)
3. `pickup black_block_1` (to pick up `black_block_1` from the table, which ensures it's not on the table)
4. `putdown black_block_1` (to place `black_block_1` back on the table)

After step 3, the constraint "if `orange_block_1` is not on the table, then there was an earlier state where `yellow_block_1` is on top of `white_block_1` OR `black_block_1` is not on the table" is satisfied because `black_block_1` is not on the table (it's in the arm).

Now, we need to ensure `orange_block_1` is not on the table at some point:

5. `pickup orange_block_1` (to pick up `orange_block_1` from the table, ensuring it's not on the table)

At this point, `orange_block_1` is not on the table (it's in the arm), and the constraint "if `orange_block_1` is not on the table, then there was an earlier state where `yellow_block_1` is on top of `white_block_1` OR `black_block_1` is not on the table" is satisfied because there was an earlier state (after step 3) where `black_block_1` was not on the table.

And with step 5, we've also achieved the goal of having the arm hold `orange_block_1`.

Wait, let me double-check this plan to make sure it's valid according to the preconditions and effects of the actions:

Step 1: `unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1`
Preconditions: 
- `white_block_1` is on top of `yellow_block_1` (true in the initial state)
- `white_block_1` is clear (true in the initial state)
- Arm is not holding any block (true in the initial state)
Effects:
- `white_block_1` is no longer on top of `yellow_block_1`
- `yellow_block_1` is clear
- Arm is holding `white_block_1`

Step 2: `putdown white_block_1`
Preconditions:
- Arm is holding `white_block_1` (true after step 1)
Effects:
- `white_block_1` is on the table
- `white_block_1` is clear
- Arm is not holding any block

Step 3: `pickup black_block_1`
Preconditions:
- `black_block_1` is clear (true in the initial state and maintained)
- `black_block_1` is on the table (true in the initial state and maintained)
- Arm is not holding any block (true after step 2)
Effects:
- Arm is holding `black_block_1`
- `black_block_1` is not on the table

Step 4: `putdown black_block_1`
Preconditions:
- Arm is holding `black_block_1` (true after step 3)
Effects:
- `black_block_1` is on the table
- `black_block_1` is clear
- Arm is not holding any block

Step 5: `pickup orange_block_1`
Preconditions:
- `orange_block_1` is clear (true in the initial state and maintained)
- `orange_block_1` is on the table (true in the initial state and maintained)
- Arm is not holding any block (true after step 4)
Effects:
- Arm is holding `orange_block_1`
- `orange_block_1` is not on the table

All preconditions are satisfied for each action. The goal is achieved (arm holding `orange_block_1`). The constraint about `orange_block_1` not being on the table is satisfied at step 5. The constraint about an earlier state where `black_block_1` is not on the table is satisfied at step 3.

But do we even need steps 2 and 4? I think they're unnecessary:

1. `unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1` (to pick up `white_block_1` from `yellow_block_1`)
2. `putdown white_block_1` (to place `white_block_1` on the table)
3. `pickup black_block_1` (to pick up `black_block_1` from the table, which ensures it's not on the table)
4. `putdown black_block_1` (to place `black_block_1` back on the table)
5. `pickup orange_block_1` (to pick up `orange_block_1` from the table, ensuring it's not on the table)

Actually, looking at it, step 1 and 2 were also unnecessary. Let's simplify:

1. `pickup black_block_1` (to pick up `black_block_1` from the table, which ensures it's not on the table)
2. `putdown black_block_1` (to place `black_block_1` back on the table)
3. `pickup orange_block_1` (to pick up `orange_block_1` from the table, ensuring it's not on the table)

But do we even need steps 1 and 2? Let's check the constraint more carefully: "If expression `orange_block_1 is not on the table` holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: `At least one of the following conditions is true: "yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1", "black_block_1 is not on the table"`"

If I directly pick up `orange_block_1` without satisfying the predecessor conditions, I'd violate the constraint. So let's check if one of the predecessor conditions is already satisfied in the initial state:

- "yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1": This is not true in the initial state. In fact, `white_block_1` is on top of `yellow_block_1`.
- "black_block_1 is not on the table": This is not true in the initial state, as `black_block_1` is on the table.

So, I need to ensure one of these conditions is true before making `orange_block_1` not on the table.

Let's review the plan again:

1. `pickup black_block_1` (to pick up `black_block_1` from the table, making it "not on the table")
2. `putdown black_block_1` (to place `black_block_1` back on the table - this isn't necessary for the constraint, so I'll skip it)
3. `pickup orange_block_1` (to pick up `orange_block_1` from the table, ensuring it's not on the table)

Actually, step 2 is unnecessary for satisfying the constraint. But after step 1, I'm holding `black_block_1`, so I can't directly perform step 3 (picking up `orange_block_1`). I need to put `black_block_1` down first.

So, the minimal valid plan is:

1. `pickup black_block_1` (to pick up `black_block_1` from the table, making it "not on the table")
2. `putdown black_block_1` (to place `black_block_1` back on the table, freeing the arm)
3. `pickup orange_block_1` (to pick up `orange_block_1` from the table, ensuring it's not on the table and achieving the goal)

But there's another approach. Instead of using `black_block_1`, I could satisfy the constraint by making `yellow_block_1` be on top of `white_block_1`. Looking at the initial state:

```
"purple_block_1 is on the table"
"brown_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1"
"yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1"
"white_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1"
```

We need to rearrange to get `yellow_block_1` on top of `white_block_1`. This would require several steps:

1. `unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1` (picking up `white_block_1` from `yellow_block_1`)
2. `putdown white_block_1` (placing `white_block_1` on the table)
3. `pickup white_block_1` (picking up `white_block_1` from the table)
4. `stack white_block_1 <some block>` (stacking `white_block_1` on another block to get it out of the way)
5. `unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1` (picking up `yellow_block_1` from `brown_block_1`)
6. `stack yellow_block_1 white_block_1` (stacking `yellow_block_1` on `white_block_1` to satisfy the constraint)
7. `pickup orange_block_1` (to pick up `orange_block_1` from the table, ensuring it's not on the table and achieving the goal)

But steps 3-4 aren't necessary if we can place `white_block_1` on a clear block after step 2. Since `purple_block_2`, `black_block_1`, and `orange_block_1` are all clear in the initial state, I can place `white_block_1` on any of them.

1. `unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1` (picking up `white_block_1` from `yellow_block_1`)
2. `stack white_block_1 purple_block_2` (stacking `white_block_1` on `purple_block_2`, a clear block)
3. `unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1` (picking up `yellow_block_1` from `brown_block_1`)
4. `stack yellow_block_1 white_block_1` (stacking `yellow_block_1` on `white_block_1` to satisfy the constraint)
5. `pickup orange_block_1` (to pick up `orange_block_1` from the table, ensuring it's not on the table and achieving the goal)

This plan also works, and it may be the only alternative to the first plan. Let's check if there are any other ways to satisfy the constraint.

Another thought: what if we just directly stack `orange_block_1` on another block, which would make it "not on the table"?

1. `pickup orange_block_1` (to pick up `orange_block_1` from the table)
2. `stack orange_block_1 purple_block_2` (to place `orange_block_1` on top of `purple_block_2`, making it "not on the table")
3. `unstack orange_block_1 purple_block_2` (to pick up `orange_block_1` from `purple_block_2`, achieving the goal)

But this wouldn't work for the constraint because I need to ensure `yellow_block_1` is on top of `white_block_1` OR `black_block_1` is not on the table BEFORE `orange_block_1` is not on the table. In this plan, `orange_block_1` becomes not on the table at step 1, but the constraint conditions aren't satisfied.

Now, comparing the two valid plans:

Plan 1:
1. `pickup black_block_1` (to pick up `black_block_1` from the table, making it "not on the table")
2. `putdown black_block_1` (to place `black_block_1` back on the table, freeing the arm)
3. `pickup orange_block_1` (to pick up `orange_block_1` from the table, ensuring it's not on the table and achieving the goal)

Plan 2:
1. `unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1` (picking up `white_block_1` from `yellow_block_1`)
2. `stack white_block_1 purple_block_2` (stacking `white_block_1` on `purple_block_2`, a clear block)
3. `unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1` (picking up `yellow_block_1` from `brown_block_1`)
4. `stack yellow_block_1 white_block_1` (stacking `yellow_block_1` on `white_block_1` to satisfy the constraint)
5. `pickup orange_block_1` (to pick up `orange_block_1` from the table, ensuring it's not on the table and achieving the goal)

Plan a is shorter (3 steps vs. 5 steps), so it's probably the more optimal one. Let's double-check the preconditions and effects again:

Plan 1:

Step 1: `pickup black_block_1`
Preconditions: 
- `black_block_1` is clear (true in the initial state)
- `black_block_1` is on the table (true in the initial state)
- Arm is not holding any block (true in the initial state)
Effects:
- Arm is holding `black_block_1`
- `black_block_1` is not on the table

Step 2: `putdown black_block_1`
Preconditions:
- Arm is holding `black_block_1` (true after step 1)
Effects:
- `black_block_1` is on the table
- `black_block_1` is clear
- Arm is not holding any block

Step 3: `pickup orange_block_1`
Preconditions:
- `orange_block_1` is clear (true in the initial state and maintained)
- `orange_block_1` is on the table (true in the initial state and maintained)
- Arm is not holding any block (true after step 2)
Effects:
- Arm is holding `orange_block_1`
- `orange_block_1` is not on the table

All preconditions are satisfied for each action. The goal is achieved (arm holding `orange_block_1`). The constraint about `orange_block_1` not being on the table is satisfied at step 3. The constraint about an earlier state where `black_block_1` is not on the table is satisfied at step 1.

Actually, I think I've been misinterpreting the constraint slightly. It's not about `black_block_1` being not on the table specifically at step 1. Rather, it's about `black_block_1` not being on the table in any state before `orange_block_1` is not on the table. And `black_block_1` is not on the table at step 1.

So, the final plan is:

1. `pickup black_block_1` (to pick up `black_block_1` from the table, making it "not on the table")
2. `putdown black_block_1` (to place `black_block_1` back on the table, freeing the arm)
3. `pickup orange_block_1` (to pick up `orange_block_1` from the table, ensuring it's not on the table and achieving the goal)

And this looks like the most optimal valid plan for the given problem.

I should check, is there a constraint saying that orange_block_1 must be not on the table other than at the goal state?

The first constraint is: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: `orange_block_1 is not on the table`"

This means that, at some point in the execution of the plan, `orange_block_1` should not be on the table. This is satisfied at step 3 (and in the goal state) where the arm is holding `orange_block_1`.

The second constraint is: "If expression `orange_block_1 is not on the table` holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: `At least one of the following conditions is true: "yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1", "black_block_1 is not on the table"`"

This means that, if there's a state where `orange_block_1` is not on the table, then there must be a previous state where either `yellow_block_1` is on top of `white_block_1` OR `black_block_1` is not on the table.

In my plan, `orange_block_1` is not on the table at step 3. And at step 1, `black_block_1` is not on the table. So, the constraint is satisfied.

Actually, I don't think I'm misinterpreting the constraint. The 2nd constraint just requires that if `orange_block_1` is not on the table at some point, then prior to this, either `yellow_block_1` is on `white_block_1` or `black_block_1` is not on the table.

My plan ensures this by having `black_block_1` not on the table (in the arm) at step 1, and later (at step 3), `orange_block_1` is not on the table (also in the arm).

So, to reiterate, I believe the following plan is the most optimal valid plan for the given problem:

1. `pickup black_block_1` (to pick up `black_block_1` from the table, making it "not on the table")
2. `putdown black_block_1` (to place `black_block_1` back on the table, freeing the arm)
3. `pickup orange_block_1` (to pick up `orange_block_1` from the table, ensuring it's not on the table and achieving the goal)

All preconditions are satisfied, the goal is achieved, and the constraints are met.

Actually I want to triple check if there's a more optimal version of the plan I provided. In particular, I could place the black_block_1 onto some other block rather than onto the table, but I can't see how that helps us; if anything, it would add unnecessary steps to reach our goal state.

Actually, hold on, I've been thinking too much about the constraint. The goal is simply to have the arm hold `orange_block_1`. And there's a constraint that `orange_block_1` should be "not on the table" in at least one state, and before it's not on the table, either `yellow_block_1` is on `white_block_1` or `black_block_1` is not on the table.

Since the goal requires the arm to hold `orange_block_1`, and when the arm holds a block, it's not on the table, the first part of the constraint is automatically satisfied by the goal.

For the second part, we need to make sure that before the arm holds `orange_block_1` (which makes it not on the table), either `yellow_block_1` is on `white_block_1` or `black_block_1` is not on the table.

The initial state already has `black_block_1` on the table, so to satisfy this constraint, we could:
1. Make `black_block_1` not on the table (by picking it up)
2. Then later pick up `orange_block_1`

Or:
1. Make `yellow_block_1` be on `white_block_1`
2. Then later pick up `orange_block_1`

The first approach seems simpler and requires fewer steps (since it doesn't involve rearranging a tower of blocks). So, the optimal plan is:

1. `pickup black_block_1` (to pick up `black_block_1` from the table, making it "not on the table")
2. `putdown black_block_1` (to place `black_block_1` back on the table, freeing the arm)
3. `pickup orange_block_1` (to pick up `orange_block_1` from the table, achieving the goal)

I'm confident this is the most optimal valid plan for the given problem.

Hmm, but do we actually need step 2? If we don't need to place `black_block_1` on the table, we could:

1. `pickup black_block_1` (to pick up `black_block_1` from the table, making it "not on the table")
2. `stack black_block_1 <some clear block>` (to place `black_block_1` on top of another block, freeing the arm)
3. `pickup orange_block_1` (to pick up `orange_block_1` from the table, achieving the goal)

But this wouldn't be shorter, and there's no specific requirement to place `black_block_1` on another block. So, the previous plan is still optimal.

Actually, I was wrong before. If we have to go from holding black_block_1 to holding orange_block_1, we can't directly hold orange_block_1 without dropping the block we're holding. So we do need step 2. I believe the optimal plan is:

1. `pickup black_block_1` (to pick up `black_block_1` from the table, making it "not on the table")
2. `putdown black_block_1` (to place `black_block_1` back on the table, freeing the arm)
3. `pickup orange_block_1` (to pick up `orange_block_1` from the table, achieving the goal)

Or more specifically,

```
pickup black_block_1
putdown black_block_1
pickup orange_block_1
```
