Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to have the robotic arm holding the orange_block_1. The initial state has several blocks arranged in towers. Let me first visualize the initial setup.

From the initial state:

- purple_block_1 is on the table with brown_block_1 on top, then yellow_block_1, and white_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1. So the tower is purple_block_1 -> brown_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 -> white_block_1.

- purple_block_2, black_block_1, and orange_block_1 are on the table, each clear.

The constraints are:

1. At some point, orange_block_1 must not be on the table. So, we have to pick it up and maybe stack it somewhere else or hold it. But since the final goal is to hold it, maybe we just need to pick it up and keep holding it, but let's check.

Wait, the goal is "you are holding orange_block_1". So the final action must be either a pickup or an unstack that results in holding orange_block_1. But the orange_block_1 is initially on the table and clear, so we can pickup directly. However, there's a constraint that orange_block_1 must not be on the table in at least one state. If we just pick it up, then during the action, after pickup, orange_block_1 is no longer on the table. So that would satisfy the first constraint. But then there's the second constraint: if orange_block_1 is not on the table (which would be after pickup), then there must be an earlier state where either yellow_block_1 is on white_block_1 or black_block_1 is not on the table.

Wait, the second constraint is a conditional. So whenever orange_block_1 is not on the table in any state, there must have been an earlier state where either yellow is on white (which isn't the case initially) or black_block_1 is not on the table. So we need to make sure that before we remove orange_block_1 from the table (i.e., pick it up), there was a state where either yellow is on white or black is not on the table.

Looking at the initial state: black_block_1 is on the table and clear. So initially, black is on the table. The other option is yellow on white. Initially, white is on top of yellow, not the other way around. So neither condition is true initially. Therefore, before we pick up orange_block_1, we need to have a state where either yellow is on white or black is not on the table.

So, how can we achieve that? Let's think. The actions we can take involve moving blocks. Since we need to satisfy one of the two conditions before picking up orange_block_1, let's consider which is easier.

Option 1: Make yellow on top of white. But initially, white is on yellow. To put yellow on white, we'd have to unstack white from yellow, put it down, then pick up yellow and stack it on white. But that's a bit involved. Let's see.

Alternatively, Option 2: Make black_block_1 not on the table. Since black is on the table initially, to make it not on the table, we can pick it up and maybe stack it somewhere else. For example, we could stack it on another block, but we have to make sure that block is clear. Let's look at the blocks on the table: purple_block_1 has a tower, so it's not clear. purple_block_2 is clear. So maybe stack black_block_1 on purple_block_2. Then, after stacking, black is not on the table, which would satisfy the condition. Then, after that, we can proceed to pick up orange_block_1.

So the plan would be:

1. pickup black_block_1 (since it's on the table and clear)
2. stack black_block_1 on purple_block_2 (which is clear)
3. Then, pickup orange_block_1 (now, since black is not on the table in step 2, when we pick up orange, the state where orange is not on the table (step 3) will have had an earlier state (step 2) where black is not on the table. That satisfies the constraint.

But wait, let's check the steps:

Step 1: pickup black_block_1. Preconditions: black is on table, clear, and arm is empty. Yes. After pickup, we're holding black_block_1.

Step 2: stack black_block_1 on purple_block_2. Preconditions: holding black, and purple_block_2 is clear. Initially, purple_block_2 is clear, so after step 1, it's still clear. So stack is possible. After stacking, black is on purple_block_2, and we're empty.

Then, step 3: pickup orange_block_1. Since orange is on table and clear. That's possible. Now, after step 3, orange is not on the table. The constraint requires that in at least one state, orange is not on table (which is step 3), and for that state, there's an earlier state (step 2) where black was not on table (since it's stacked on purple_block_2). So that satisfies the constraints.

But the goal is to have the arm holding orange_block_1. So step 3 is the final action. The plan would be:

pickup black_block_1

stack black_block_1 purple_block_2

pickup orange_block_1

But let's verify:

After step 3, the arm is holding orange_block_1, which is the goal. The constraints are satisfied: in step 3, orange is not on table, and step 2 (earlier) has black not on table. So that's valid.

But wait, what's the state after step 2? After stacking black on purple_block_2, black is not on the table. So in the state after step 2, black is not on the table. Then step 3 is pickup orange, which is allowed because orange is on table and clear.

But is there a shorter plan? Let's see. Suppose instead of moving black_block_1, we do something else. For example, unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1, then stack yellow_block_1 on white_block_1. That would make yellow on white, satisfying one of the conditions. But that would take more steps.

Let me outline that approach:

1. unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1 (requires white is on yellow, and clear. Since white is on top, and arm is empty. So possible.)

2. putdown white_block_1 (now white is on table, clear)

3. pickup yellow_block_1 (since it's clear now, on brown_block_1. Wait, wait: the initial tower is purple_block_1 (table) -> brown_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 -> white_block_1. After unstacking white from yellow, yellow becomes clear. So step 3: pickup yellow_block_1. Preconditions: yellow is on table? No, yellow is on brown_block_1. So we can't pickup yellow_block_1 from brown_block_1 unless we unstack it. So step 3 would be unstack yellow_block_1 from brown_block_1. Wait, but in the initial state, yellow is on brown. So after unstacking white, yellow is clear. Then:

Wait, after step 1: unstack white from yellow. Now, white is in the arm, then step 2: putdown white. Now, white is on table. Then, yellow_block_1 is on brown_block_1 and clear. So step 3: unstack yellow_block_1 from brown_block_1. Then step 4: stack yellow on white. Then step 5: pickup orange.

That's 5 steps, which is longer than the previous approach of 3 steps. So the first approach is better.

So the optimal plan is 3 actions: pickup black, stack black on purple2, then pickup orange. That satisfies all constraints.

But wait, let's check if stacking black on purple2 is allowed. purple2 is initially clear. So yes, after pickup black, we can stack on purple2. Then, after stacking, black is on purple2, which is not on the table. So the condition in the constraint is met.

Therefore, the plan is:

pickup black_block_1

stack black_block_1 purple_block_2

pickup orange_block_1

Each action is valid. Let's check each precondition:

1. pickup black_block_1: black is on table, clear, arm empty. Yes.

2. stack black_block_1 purple_block_2: holding black_block_1, purple_block_2 is clear. Yes.

3. pickup orange_block_1: orange is on table, clear, arm is empty (after stack). Yes.

After these steps, the arm is holding orange_block_1, which is the goal. The constraints are satisfied: in the state after step 3, orange is not on table. The earlier state after step 2 has black not on table. So the conditional is satisfied.

Therefore, this is a valid and optimal plan with 3 steps. I don't think a shorter plan is possible because we need to satisfy the constraints. If we just do pickup orange_block_1 directly, that's one step, but then the constraint requires that in that state (orange not on table), there must be an earlier state where either yellow is on white or black is not on table. But the initial state doesn't satisfy that. So the first action is pickup orange, which leads to orange not on table. But there's no earlier state (since it's the first action), so the constraint would fail. Therefore, we must have at least two actions before picking up orange. Wait, no. Wait, the plan I proposed has three actions, but maybe there's a way to do it in two steps. For example, if we can make black not on table in one step, then pickup orange.

Wait, to make black not on table, we need to pickup and stack. So that's two actions. Then pickup orange is third. So total three. But can we do it in two? Let me think. Suppose we have a single action that affects the required condition. But no, because to move black off the table, you need to pickup and stack (or putdown, but putdown places it on table). So to get black off the table, you must stack it on another block, which requires two actions: pickup and stack. Then, the third action is pickup orange. So three steps. Alternatively, perhaps unstack some other block to make black not on table? No, black is initially on the table. The only way to move it is to pick it up and stack it.

So I think the three-step plan is the shortest possible. Therefore, that's the optimal plan.
