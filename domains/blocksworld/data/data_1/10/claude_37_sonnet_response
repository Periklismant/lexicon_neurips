Alright, I have a blocksworld problem to solve. Let me break down the initial state, the goal, and the constraints, and then I'll work towards a solution.

**Initial State**:
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- black_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- black_block_2 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2
- black_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is clear
- blue_block_1 is clear
- The robotic arm is not holding any block

**Goal**:
- You are holding blue_block_1

**Constraints**:
1. "there is a block on top of blue_block_1, i.e., blue_block_1 is not clear" must hold in at least one state of the plan.
2. If constraint 1 holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which "red_block_1 is on the table" is true.

Let's develop a plan that achieves the goal and satisfies the given constraints.

First, to satisfy constraint 1, at some point there must be a block on top of blue_block_1, making it "not clear". Once blue_block_1 is not clear, we need to make it clear again to be able to pick it up (as "unstack" requires the block to be clear).

Second, to satisfy constraint 2, before making blue_block_1 not clear, we need to ensure that red_block_1 is on the table.

In the initial state, red_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, not on the table. So, we need to move red_block_1 to the table before we put any block on top of blue_block_1.

Let's sketch a plan:

1. First, we need to get red_block_1 on the table. Since red_block_1 is initially on top of white_block_1, we need to pick it up with "unstack red_block_1 white_block_1" and then put it down on the table with "putdown red_block_1".
2. After red_block_1 is on the table, we need to place a block on top of blue_block_1 to satisfy constraint 1. We can do this with any clear block (e.g., black_block_1 or red_block_1). Let's use "unstack black_block_1 yellow_block_1" followed by "stack black_block_1 blue_block_1".
3. Now blue_block_1 is not clear. We need to make it clear again to be able to pick it up. So, we can use "unstack black_block_1 blue_block_1" followed by "putdown black_block_1".
4. Finally, to achieve the goal, we pick up blue_block_1 with "unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2".

Let's check the plan:

```
unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
putdown red_block_1
unstack black_block_1 yellow_block_1
stack black_block_1 blue_block_1
unstack black_block_1 blue_block_1
putdown black_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2
```

Wait, I see some issues with my plan. On step 4, we need to stack black_block_1 on blue_block_1. But I didn't consider that blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2, so it's not on the table.

Let me revise the plan:

```
unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
putdown red_block_1
unstack black_block_1 yellow_block_1
stack black_block_1 blue_block_1
unstack black_block_1 blue_block_1
putdown black_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2
```

Actually, this should still work. We're unstacking black_block_1 from yellow_block_1, then stacking it on blue_block_1, which is at the top of another stack (on top of black_block_2). Then we're unstacking black_block_1 from blue_block_1, and putting it down on the table. Finally, we're unstacking blue_block_1 from black_block_2.

Let's double-check this with the available actions:

1. "unstack red_block_1 white_block_1": This is valid because red_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, red_block_1 is clear, and we're not holding any block.
2. "putdown red_block_1": This is valid because we're holding red_block_1.
3. "unstack black_block_1 yellow_block_1": This is valid because black_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, black_block_1 is clear, and we're not holding any block.
4. "stack black_block_1 blue_block_1": This is valid because we're holding black_block_1 and blue_block_1 is clear.
5. "unstack black_block_1 blue_block_1": This is valid because black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1, black_block_1 is clear, and we're not holding any block.
6. "putdown black_block_1": This is valid because we're holding black_block_1.
7. "unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2": This is valid because blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2, blue_block_1 is clear, and we're not holding any block.

After step 7, we achieve the goal of holding blue_block_1.

Now, let's check the constraints:
1. "there is a block on top of blue_block_1, i.e., blue_block_1 is not clear" holds after step 4 (stack black_block_1 blue_block_1).
2. "red_block_1 is on the table" holds after step 2 (putdown red_block_1), which is before we make blue_block_1 not clear in step 4.

So, the constraints are satisfied. The plan is valid.

Wait, I realized I made a mistake in my analysis. I was thinking of the "unstack" action incorrectly. After unstacking blue_block_1 from black_block_2, we're holding blue_block_1, which is our goal. The plan is valid! Let's double check once more: 

```
unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
putdown red_block_1
unstack black_block_1 yellow_block_1
stack black_block_1 blue_block_1
unstack black_block_1 blue_block_1
putdown black_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2
```

Actually, I think there's a more optimal plan available. Let's try using red_block_1 directly from the initial state, since it's already clear:

```
unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
stack red_block_1 blue_block_1
unstack red_block_1 blue_block_1
putdown red_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2
```

Let me check if this is valid:

1. "unstack red_block_1 white_block_1": This is valid because red_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, red_block_1 is clear, and we're not holding any block.
2. "stack red_block_1 blue_block_1": This is valid because we're holding red_block_1 and blue_block_1 is clear.
3. "unstack red_block_1 blue_block_1": This is valid because red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1, red_block_1 is clear, and we're not holding any block.
4. "putdown red_block_1": This is valid because we're holding red_block_1.
5. "unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2": This is valid because blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2, blue_block_1 is clear, and we're not holding any block.

After step 5, we achieve the goal of holding blue_block_1.

For the constraints:
1. "there is a block on top of blue_block_1, i.e., blue_block_1 is not clear" holds after step 2 (stack red_block_1 blue_block_1).
2. For constraint 2, the condition "there is a block on top of blue_block_1" holds after step 2. However, we need to check if "red_block_1 is on the table" is true at some earlier state. In the original state, red_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, not on the table. So, for this constraint to be satisfied, we would need to place red_block_1 on the table before placing it on blue_block_1. But in our current plan, we go straight from unstacking red_block_1 from white_block_1 to stacking it on blue_block_1.

So, this plan doesn't actually satisfy the second constraint. Let's correct it:

```
unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
putdown red_block_1
pickup red_block_1
stack red_block_1 blue_block_1
unstack red_block_1 blue_block_1
putdown red_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2
```

Let's review this:

1. "unstack red_block_1 white_block_1": Valid as before.
2. "putdown red_block_1": Valid, and now red_block_1 is on the table, satisfying the condition for constraint 2.
3. "pickup red_block_1": Valid because red_block_1 is clear, on the table, and we're not holding any block.
4. "stack red_block_1 blue_block_1": Valid, and now blue_block_1 is not clear, satisfying constraint 1.
5. "unstack red_block_1 blue_block_1": Valid.
6. "putdown red_block_1": Valid.
7. "unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2": Valid, and now we're holding blue_block_1, achieving the goal.

This seems to satisfy both constraints and achieve the goal.

I'm realizing the previous plan actually doesn't have to be modified. The constraint says that if "there is a block on top of blue_block_1" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which "red_block_1 is on the table" is true. 

In our plan:
```
unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
putdown red_block_1     # After this, red_block_1 is on the table
unstack black_block_1 yellow_block_1
stack black_block_1 blue_block_1  # After this, blue_block_1 is not clear
unstack black_block_1 blue_block_1
putdown black_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2  # Achieve goal
```

"red_block_1 is on the table" becomes true after step 2, and "there is a block on top of blue_block_1" becomes true after step 4. Since step 2 is before step 4, the constraint is satisfied.

Actually, I think we don't need steps 3-6. We can simply use red_block_1:

```
unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
putdown red_block_1     # After this, red_block_1 is on the table
pickup red_block_1
stack red_block_1 blue_block_1  # After this, blue_block_1 is not clear
unstack red_block_1 blue_block_1
putdown red_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2  # Achieve goal
```

Let's check if this is valid:

1. "unstack red_block_1 white_block_1": Valid. Effect: We're holding red_block_1.
2. "putdown red_block_1": Valid. Effect: red_block_1 is on the table.
3. "pickup red_block_1": Valid. Effect: We're holding red_block_1.
4. "stack red_block_1 blue_block_1": Valid. Effect: red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1.
5. "unstack red_block_1 blue_block_1": Valid. Effect: We're holding red_block_1.
6. "putdown red_block_1": Valid. Effect: red_block_1 is on the table.
7. "unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2": Valid. Effect: We're holding blue_block_1 (goal state).

This plan satisfies the goal and both constraints:
- "there is a block on top of blue_block_1" is true after step 4.
- "red_block_1 is on the table" is true after step 2, which is before step 4.

So, this plan is valid. 

But I'm thinking we can optimize this even further. After step 2, red_block_1 is on the table. We then pick it up, stack it, unstack it, and put it down again. We might be able to skip steps 3-6 and just directly pick up blue_block_1:

```
unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
putdown red_block_1     # After this, red_block_1 is on the table
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2  # Achieve goal
```

But wait, this doesn't satisfy constraint 1 ("there is a block on top of blue_block_1, i.e., blue_block_1 is not clear" must hold in at least one state of the plan). In this plan, blue_block_1 is always clear, so it doesn't work.

Actually, I'm now realizing that our plan from steps 1-7 is probably optimal because it involves all the necessary steps to satisfy both constraints and achieve the goal.

Let's review one final time to make sure it's the most efficient plan that satisfies all the constraints.

Constraint 1 requires that there be a block on top of blue_block_1 in at least one state, so we need to place some block on top of blue_block_1.

Constraint 2 specifies that if blue_block_1 is not clear (i.e., if there's a block on top of it), then "red_block_1 is on the table" must be true in an earlier state. This means we need to put red_block_1 on the table before placing any block on top of blue_block_1.

Initially, red_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, so we need to unstack it and put it on the table. Given these constraints and the initial setup, I believe our plan from steps 1-7 is the most efficient.

Let me check to ensure nothing can actually be removed:

Steps 1-2 are required to satisfy constraint 2. We need to put red_block_1 on the table before making blue_block_1 not clear.

Steps 3-4 are required to satisfy constraint 1. We need to place some block on top of blue_block_1.

Steps 5-6 are required because we need to clear blue_block_1 so that we can unstack it from black_block_2.

Step 7 is required to achieve the goal of holding blue_block_1.

I can't think of any way to remove or merge any of these steps, so I believe our plan is optimal.

Actually, since the goal is just to be holding blue_block_1, and we're given the constraint that there must be a block on top of blue_block_1 at some point, we can satisfy both constraints in a simpler way:

```
unstack red_block_1 white_block_1  # Picking up red_block_1
putdown red_block_1  # Putting red_block_1 on the table
pickup red_block_1  # Picking up red_block_1 from the table
stack red_block_1 blue_block_1  # Placing red_block_1 on top of blue_block_1 (making blue_block_1 not clear)
unstack red_block_1 blue_block_1  # Picking up red_block_1 from blue_block_1 (making blue_block_1 clear again)
putdown red_block_1  # Putting red_block_1 back on the table
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2  # Picking up blue_block_1 (achieving the goal)
```

Wait, this is more or less the same as our earlier plan after I reviewed again. Let's check if we can trim steps that don't help us achieive our goal or the two constraints.

Steps 1-2 are required for constraint 2.
Steps 3-4 are required for constraint 1.
Steps 5-6 are required to make blue_block_1 clear again.
Step 7 is required to achieve the goal.

I believe our plan is optimal. Let me give the optimal plan with explanations:

```
unstack red_block_1 white_block_1  # Picking up red_block_1
putdown red_block_1                # Putting red_block_1 on the table
pickup red_block_1                 # Picking up red_block_1 from the table
stack red_block_1 blue_block_1     # Placing red_block_1 on top of blue_block_1 (making blue_block_1 not clear)
unstack red_block_1 blue_block_1   # Picking up red_block_1 from blue_block_1 (making blue_block_1 clear again)
putdown red_block_1                # Putting red_block_1 back on the table
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2 # Picking up blue_block_1 (achieving the goal)
```

This plan:
1. Achieves the goal of holding blue_block_1.
2. Satisfies constraint 1 by ensuring that there is a block (red_block_1) on top of blue_block_1 at some state (after step 4).
3. Satisfies constraint 2 because before blue_block_1 becomes not clear (after step 4), red_block_1 is already on the table (after step 2).

Considering that we need to:
- Put red_block_1 on the table.
- Stack a block on top of blue_block_1.
- Unstack that block from blue_block_1.
- Pick up blue_block_1.

This seems to be the most efficient way to achieve the goal while satisfying all constraints.

Actually I think the most optimal plan would use black_block_1 instead of red_block_1 to make blue_block_1 not clear

```
unstack red_block_1 white_block_1  # Picking up red_block_1
putdown red_block_1                # Putting red_block_1 on the table (for constraint 2)
unstack black_block_1 yellow_block_1 # Picking up black_block_1
stack black_block_1 blue_block_1   # Placing black_block_1 on top of blue_block_1 (for constraint 1)
unstack black_block_1 blue_block_1 # Picking up black_block_1 (making blue_block_1 clear again)
putdown black_block_1             # Putting black_block_1 on the table
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2 # Picking up blue_block_1 (achieving the goal)
```

But then again, this doesn't seem more optimal, as it has the same number of steps. It doesn't matter which block we put on top of blue_block_1, as long as we satisfy the constraints.

Let's check if we can use any other block, perhaps a clear one from the initial state, to make it more efficient. In the initial state, the clear blocks are black_block_1, red_block_1, and blue_block_1.

Blue_block_1 is the one we're trying to pick up, so we won't use it. Red_block_1 is the one we need to put on the table for constraint 2, so if we use it, we'd have to pick it up and stack it, as we did.

Black_block_1 is already clear and on top of yellow_block_1, but constraint 2 requires that "red_block_1 is on the table" must be true in an earlier state if there's a block on top of blue_block_1. So, we'd still need to put red_block_1 on the table before using black_block_1 to stack on blue_block_1, which is what our current plan does.

I'm inclined to believe our current plan with seven steps is optimal. Let's finalize it:

```
unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
putdown red_block_1
pickup red_block_1
stack red_block_1 blue_block_1
unstack red_block_1 blue_block_1
putdown red_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2
```

Ok, let me double-check if using red_block_1 vs. black_block_1 for making blue_block_1 not clear changes the number of steps. If we use red_block_1, as in our current plan:

```
unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
putdown red_block_1
pickup red_block_1
stack red_block_1 blue_block_1
unstack red_block_1 blue_block_1
putdown red_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2
```

And if we use black_block_1:

```
unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
putdown red_block_1
unstack black_block_1 yellow_block_1
stack black_block_1 blue_block_1
unstack black_block_1 blue_block_1
putdown black_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2
```

Both sequences have the same number of steps, so either is valid and optimal. Perhaps a cleaner approach would be to use red_block_1 since we're already manipulating it to meet constraint 2.

Actually, wait. Let me double-check constraint 2:

"If expression 'there is a block on top of blue_block_1, i.e., blue_block_1 is not clear' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'red_block_1 is on the table'"

This only requires that red_block_1 be on the table at some point before we make blue_block_1 not clear. I think we were right in the first place, both approaches using red_block_1 or black_block_1 are equally optimal.

Let's check once more. Whether use use the red block_1 again, or we use another block like black_block_1, we still need to perform 7 steps to achieve the goal since the two contraints. 

Constraint 1 requires placing a block on top of blue_block_1, and we have a few choices for this (e.g., red_block_1, black_block_1).

Constraint 2 requires putting red_block_1 on the table before making blue_block_1 not clear. So, we need to unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1 and put it on the table before we do anything with blue_block_1.

Given the initial state and these constraints, it seems like we need 7 steps regardless of whether we use red_block_1 or another block (like black_block_1) to make blue_block_1.

In summary, the optimal plan requires 7 steps, and there are at least the two we found that work and. Let me use the plan with red_block_1 because we're already manipulating it:

```
unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
putdown red_block_1
pickup red_block_1
stack red_block_1 blue_block_1
unstack red_block_1 blue_block_1
putdown red_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2
```

This achieves the goal of holding blue_block_1 and satisfies both constraints in a concise manner.
