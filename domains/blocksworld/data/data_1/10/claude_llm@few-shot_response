I'll solve this planning problem step by step.

First, let me understand the initial state:
- orange_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top of it and black_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1
- black_block_2 is on the table with blue_block_1 on top of it
- white_block_1 is on the table with red_block_1 on top of it
- black_block_1, red_block_1, and blue_block_1 are clear
- The robot arm is not holding anything

The goal is to be holding blue_block_1.

The constraints are:
1. At some point, blue_block_1 must not be clear (something must be on top of it)
2. Before blue_block_1 becomes not clear, red_block_1 must be on the table

Let me plan this:

1. First, I need to put red_block_1 on the table (it's already there)
2. Then I need to put something on top of blue_block_1 to make it not clear
3. Finally, I need to unstack that block and then unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2

Since red_block_1 is already clear, I can use it to place on top of blue_block_1:

```
unstack red_block_1 white_block_1
stack red_block_1 blue_block_1
unstack red_block_1 blue_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2
```
