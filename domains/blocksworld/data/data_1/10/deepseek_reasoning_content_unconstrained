Okay, let's see. I need to find a plan to get the robotic arm to hold the blue_block_1. The initial state has blue_block_1 on top of black_block_2, and it's clear. So the first thing I need to do is unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2. But wait, the unstack action requires that the block (blue_block_1) is on top of another block (black_block_2), that blue_block_1 is clear, and the arm isn't holding anything. All those conditions are met initially. So the first action should be unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2. After that, the arm is holding blue_block_1, which is exactly the goal. Wait, but is there anything else required? The goal is just to be holding blue_block_1. So maybe that's the only action needed. Let me check the initial state again.

Original state: blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2, and it's clear. The arm is not holding anything. So performing unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2 would make the arm hold it. That's the only step needed. So the plan would be just that one action. But wait, are there any constraints I missed? The problem says to provide a valid plan that brings about the goal. The goal is holding blue_block_1. So unstacking it directly achieves the goal. But maybe there's a possibility that another block is on top of blue_block_1? But no, the initial state says blue_block_1 is clear. So yes, unstack is possible. Therefore, the optimal plan is just one action: unstack blue_block_1 black_block_2.
