Okay, let's break this down. We need to be holding `blue_block_1` at the end. Currently, `blue_block_1` is on `black_block_2`. We also have two constraints: 1) At some point, `blue_block_1` must have a block on top of it. 2) Before `blue_block_1` has a block on top of it, `red_block_1` must be on the table.

Here's the plan:

1.  Put `red_block_1` on the table.
2.  Stack `red_block_1` on `blue_block_1`. This satisfies the first constraint, and the second constraint is already satisfied.
3.  Unstack `red_block_1` from `blue_block_1`.
4.  Pick up `blue_block_1`.

```
```
putdown red_block_1
stack red_block_1 blue_block_1
unstack red_block_1 blue_block_1
pickup blue_block_1
