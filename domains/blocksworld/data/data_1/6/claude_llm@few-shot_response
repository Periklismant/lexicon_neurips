I'll solve this planning problem step by step.

First, let me analyze the initial state:
- brown_block_1 is on the table with grey_block_1 on top of it, and blue_block_1 on top of grey_block_1
- brown_block_2 is on the table with orange_block_1 on top of it
- red_block_1 is on the table and clear
- white_block_1 is on the table and clear
- blue_block_1, red_block_1, orange_block_1, and white_block_1 are clear
- The arm is empty

The goal is to be holding brown_block_2.

Constraints:
1. At some point, brown_block_2 must be clear
2. If brown_block_2 becomes clear, then at that state or a later state, grey_block_1 must be on top of orange_block_1

To pick up brown_block_2, it must first be clear. Currently, orange_block_1 is on top of it, so I need to remove orange_block_1.

Plan:
1. First, I need to unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_2
2. Before I can pick up brown_block_2, I must satisfy the constraint by placing grey_block_1 on top of orange_block_1
3. To get grey_block_1, I need to unstack blue_block_1 first, then unstack grey_block_1
4. Then I can stack grey_block_1 on orange_block_1
5. Finally, I can pick up brown_block_2

```
unstack orange_block_1 brown_block_2
putdown orange_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 grey_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 brown_block_1
stack grey_block_1 orange_block_1
pickup brown_block_2
```
