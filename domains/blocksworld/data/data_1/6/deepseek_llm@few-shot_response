To solve this planning problem, we need to find a sequence of actions that results in the robotic arm holding `brown_block_2` while satisfying the given constraints. Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

### Initial State:
- `brown_block_1` is on the table.
- `grey_block_1` is on top of `brown_block_1`.
- `brown_block_2` is on the table.
- `blue_block_1` is on top of `grey_block_1`.
- `red_block_1` is on the table.
- `orange_block_1` is on top of `brown_block_2`.
- `white_block_1` is on the table.
- `blue_block_1`, `red_block_1`, `orange_block_1`, and `white_block_1` are clear (no blocks on top of them).
- The robotic arm is not holding any block.

### Goal:
- The robotic arm is holding `brown_block_2`.

### Constraints:
1. At some point, `brown_block_2` must be clear (no block on top of it).
2. If `brown_block_2` is clear at some state, then `grey_block_1` must be on top of `orange_block_1` either at that state or later.

### Plan:
1. First, we need to make `brown_block_2` clear by removing `orange_block_1` from it. This satisfies the first constraint.
2. Then, we must ensure that `grey_block_1` is on top of `orange_block_1` at some point after `brown_block_2` is clear. This satisfies the second constraint.
3. Finally, we can pick up `brown_block_2` since it will be clear.

### Step-by-Step Actions:
1. **Unstack `orange_block_1` from `brown_block_2`**: This makes `brown_block_2` clear (satisfying the first constraint) and holds `orange_block_1`.
2. **Putdown `orange_block_1` on the table**: This frees the robotic arm to perform other actions.
3. **Unstack `blue_block_1` from `grey_block_1`**: This is necessary to later stack `grey_block_1` on `orange_block_1`.
4. **Putdown `blue_block_1` on the table**: Frees the robotic arm.
5. **Unstack `grey_block_1` from `brown_block_1`**: Now we can stack `grey_block_1` on `orange_block_1`.
6. **Stack `grey_block_1` on `orange_block_1`**: This satisfies the second constraint (`grey_block_1` is on top of `orange_block_1` after `brown_block_2` is clear).
7. **Pickup `brown_block_2`**: Now `brown_block_2` is clear (from step 1), and the goal is achieved.

### Final Plan:
```
```
unstack orange_block_1 brown_block_2
putdown orange_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 grey_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 brown_block_1
stack grey_block_1 orange_block_1
pickup brown_block_2
```
