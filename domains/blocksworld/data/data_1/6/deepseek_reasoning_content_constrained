Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to have the robotic arm holding brown_block_2. The initial state has several blocks arranged in specific ways, and there are some constraints to consider.

First, let's look at the initial setup. The brown_block_2 is on the table with orange_block_1 on top of it. Since orange_block_1 is clear in the initial state, maybe we can unstack it from brown_block_2. But wait, the constraints require that at some point, brown_block_2 must be clear. Also, if brown_block_2 is ever clear, then grey_block_1 must be on orange_block_1 either at that state or later.

So the plan must include a state where brown_block_2 is clear. Let's see: to get brown_block_2 clear, we need to remove whatever is on top of it. Right now, orange_block_1 is on brown_block_2. So first, we need to unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_2. That would make brown_block_2 clear. But after unstacking, we're holding orange_block_1. Then, we have to put it down somewhere or stack it on another block.

But the constraint says that if brown_block_2 is clear at any point, then grey_block_1 must be on orange_block_1 either at that state or later. So after we unstack orange_block_1, making brown_block_2 clear, we need to ensure that eventually grey_block_1 is on orange_block_1. But currently, grey_block_1 is on brown_block_1, and blue_block_1 is on grey_block_1. So to get grey_block_1, we need to unstack blue_block_1 first, then unstack grey_block_1 from brown_block_1, then stack grey_block_1 onto orange_block_1.

Wait, but how does that fit into the plan? Let's outline the steps:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_2. This makes brown_block_2 clear (satisfying the first constraint). Then, we're holding orange_block_1. Now, after this step, the constraint requires that grey_block_1 is on orange_block_1 at some point. So perhaps we need to stack grey_block_1 onto orange_block_1 later.

But first, we need to handle the blocks on brown_block_1. Since grey_block_1 is under blue_block_1, we need to move blue_block_1 first. Let's see:

Current stack on brown_block_1: grey_block_1 has blue_block_1 on top. Both blue and grey are clear? Wait, initial state says blue_block_1 is on grey_block_1 and there's nothing on blue_block_1 (blue is clear). So to get grey_block_1, we need to unstack blue_block_1 first.

So steps could be:

- Unstack blue_block_1 from grey_block_1. Now holding blue_block_1, put it down on the table. Then unstack grey_block_1 from brown_block_1. Then stack grey_block_1 onto orange_block_1 (which we previously unstacked). But orange_block_1 is currently being held after the first unstack. Wait, no. Let's retrace.

Wait, initial plan steps:

First, unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_2. Then, put it down. Then, unstack blue_block_1 from grey_block_1. Then, put down blue_block_1. Then, unstack grey_block_1 from brown_block_1. Then, stack grey_block_1 onto orange_block_1. But orange_block_1 is on the table at that point. Wait, no. After unstacking orange_block_1 from brown_block_2, we're holding it. If we put it down, then it's on the table. Then, to stack grey_block_1 onto orange_block_1, we need to have orange_block_1 on the table and clear. So if we put down orange_block_1, then later stack grey_block_1 on it. But we need to handle the blocks in order.

Alternatively, perhaps after unstacking orange_block_1 from brown_block_2 (making brown_block_2 clear, which triggers the constraint), we can stack it somewhere else, but the constraint requires that grey_block_1 ends up on orange_block_1. So maybe after moving orange_block_1, we need to place grey_block_1 on top of it.

But let's think step by step.

Initial steps:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_2. This requires that orange_block_1 is clear (which it is), and we're not holding anything. After this, brown_block_2 is clear (satisfies the first constraint). Now holding orange_block_1.

But now, the constraint says that if brown_block_2 is clear in some state, then in that state or a later one, grey_block_1 must be on orange_block_1. So after step 1, the state has brown_block_2 clear. So we need to ensure that either in this state or a subsequent one, grey_block_1 is on orange_block_1.

But in the current state after step 1, we are holding orange_block_1. So grey_block_1 is on brown_block_1, with blue_block_1 on top. So to get grey_block_1 onto orange_block_1, we need to first unstack blue_block_1, then unstack grey_block_1, then stack grey_block_1 onto orange_block_1.

But orange_block_1 is currently in the arm. So maybe after step 1, we put down orange_block_1, then proceed to move blue and grey blocks.

Let's outline:

1. Unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_2. (Now holding orange_block_1, brown_block_2 is clear. This triggers the constraint, so we need to make sure that eventually grey_block_1 is on orange_block_1.)

2. Putdown orange_block_1. (Now orange_block_1 is on the table and clear.)

3. Now, to get grey_block_1, we need to unstack blue_block_1 from grey_block_1 first. So unstack blue_block_1 from grey_block_1. (Holding blue_block_1.)

4. Putdown blue_block_1. (Now blue is on table, clear.)

5. Unstack grey_block_1 from brown_block_1. (Holding grey_block_1.)

6. Stack grey_block_1 onto orange_block_1. (Now grey is on orange, which is on table. This satisfies the constraint because after step 1, brown_block_2 was clear, and in step 6, grey is on orange.)

So after these steps, the constraint is satisfied. Now, the goal is to hold brown_block_2. Currently, brown_block_2 is on the table and clear (after step 1). So we can just pick it up. But wait, after step 6, the arm is empty again. So step 7: pickup brown_block_2.

But wait, let's check the preconditions for each action:

Step 1: unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_2. Preconditions: orange is on brown_block_2, orange is clear, arm is empty. Yes, initial state has orange on brown_block_2, and orange is clear (since nothing is on top). So that's okay.

After step 1, brown_block_2 is clear.

Step 2: putdown orange_block_1. Precondition: holding it. Yes. Then orange is on table, clear.

Step 3: unstack blue_block_1 from grey_block_1. Preconditions: blue is on grey, blue is clear (initially, blue is clear). Arm is empty. After step 2, arm is empty. So yes. Unstack blue_block_1 from grey_block_1.

Step 4: putdown blue_block_1. Now arm is holding blue, put it down.

Step 5: unstack grey_block_1 from brown_block_1. Preconditions: grey is on brown_block_1, grey is clear (after step 3, grey was under blue, but after unstacking blue, grey becomes clear). So yes. Unstack grey_block_1.

Step 6: stack grey_block_1 onto orange_block_1. Preconditions: holding grey, and orange is clear. Orange was put down in step 2 and is clear. So yes. Stack grey on orange.

Now, after step 6, the arm is empty. Then, step 7: pickup brown_block_2. Preconditions: brown_block_2 is on table, clear (after step 1, yes), arm is empty. So yes.

So the plan would be:

unstack orange_block_1 brown_block_2
putdown orange_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 grey_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 brown_block_1
stack grey_block_1 orange_block_1
pickup brown_block_2

Wait, but in step 6, after stacking grey on orange, orange is now under grey, so orange is not clear anymore. But in step 2, we put orange on the table, which is clear. Then after stacking grey on it, orange is not clear, but that's okay. The constraint is satisfied because after step 1, brown_block_2 is clear, and in step 6, grey is on orange. So the constraint is met.

So this plan would achieve the goal of holding brown_block_2, and satisfy the constraints.

Let me check each step again for preconditions and effects:

1. unstack orange_block_1 brown_block_2:
   - Pre: orange is on brown_block_2, orange is clear, arm empty. Correct.
   - Effect: brown_block_2 is clear, arm holds orange.

2. putdown orange_block_1:
   - Pre: holding orange. Correct.
   - Effect: orange on table, clear, arm empty.

3. unstack blue_block_1 grey_block_1:
   - Pre: blue is on grey, blue is clear (after initial steps, blue was on grey and clear). Arm empty. Correct.
   - Effect: blue is held, grey_block_1 becomes clear.

4. putdown blue_block_1:
   - Pre: holding blue. Correct.
   - Effect: blue on table, clear, arm empty.

5. unstack grey_block_1 brown_block_1:
   - Pre: grey is on brown_block_1, grey is clear (since blue was unstacked, so yes). Arm empty. Correct.
   - Effect: grey is held, brown_block_1 becomes clear.

6. stack grey_block_1 orange_block_1:
   - Pre: holding grey, orange is clear (orange was put on table in step 2, and is clear). Correct.
   - Effect: grey is on orange, orange is not clear. Arm empty.

7. pickup brown_block_2:
   - Pre: brown_block_2 is on table, clear (from step 1), arm empty. Correct.
   - Effect: holding brown_block_2, which is the goal.

This plan has 7 steps. Let's check if there's a shorter way.

Wait, after unstacking orange_block_1 from brown_block_2 (step 1), brown_block_2 is clear. The constraint requires that whenever brown_block_2 is clear, then in that state or a future one, grey is on orange. So in step 1, after unstacking, the state is s1 where brown_block_2 is clear. Then, in the plan, we later stack grey on orange (step 6), so that's after s1, which satisfies the constraint.

Now, can we combine some steps? For example, after step 1, instead of putting down orange_block_1, can we stack it somewhere else, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe stack grey_block_1 onto orange_block_1 while holding orange_block_1. But no, because stacking requires holding the block to stack. So we have to put down orange_block_1 first, then handle the other blocks.

Alternatively, after step 1 (holding orange), instead of putting it down, can we stack it on another block? For example, stack orange_block_1 on some other block, but that would require that the other block is clear. Let's see. The other blocks on the table initially are brown_block_1 (with grey and blue on top), brown_block_2 (now clear), red_block_1 (clear), white_block_1 (clear). So if we stack orange_block_1 on red_block_1, which is clear. Then, after step 1, stack orange on red. But then, when do we stack grey on orange? Because orange would be on red, so to stack grey on orange, we need orange to be clear. But after stacking orange on red, orange is not clear. So that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 1, stack orange_block_1 onto brown_block_2 (which is now clear). But that would require that brown_block_2 is clear (which it is). So step 1: unstack orange from brown_block_2. Step 2: stack orange on brown_block_2. Then, brown_block_2 is not clear anymore. But this would negate the constraint, because we need brown_block_2 to be clear in at least one state. Well, it already was clear in step 1, so that's okay. But then we have to make sure that grey is on orange. But if orange is on brown_block_2, then we need to have grey on orange. But then, we would have to stack grey on orange, which is on brown_block_2. But for that, we need to first move the blocks again. This seems to complicate things and may require more steps.

Alternatively, after step 1 (holding orange), stack it on brown_block_2 again. But then, we need to unstack it again later, which would add steps. Probably not better.

So the original plan with 7 steps seems optimal. Let me see if any steps can be skipped.

Wait, after step 5, we unstack grey_block_1 from brown_block_1. Then, in step 6, stack grey on orange. But maybe instead of putting down blue_block_1 (step 4), can we stack blue_block_1 onto another block, but that would require moving it again. Not sure. Let's see.

Alternative approach:

1. unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_2. (arm has orange)
2. stack orange_block_1 on some block that is clear. For example, red_block_1 is clear. So stack orange on red. Now, orange is on red, and not clear. Then, to stack grey on orange, we need to have orange clear. But that's not possible. So this approach might not work.

Alternatively, after step 1, put down orange, then proceed to move blue and grey.

Another alternative: after step 1, instead of putting down orange_block_1, can we stack it directly on grey_block_1? But grey_block_1 is under blue_block_1, so it's not clear. So we can't stack anything on grey_block_1 until blue_block_1 is moved.

So the original plan seems necessary.

Therefore, the optimal plan is 7 steps.
