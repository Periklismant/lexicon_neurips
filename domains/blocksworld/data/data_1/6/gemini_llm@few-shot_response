Okay, let's break this down. We need to be holding brown_block_2 at the end. Currently, orange_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2. We also have a constraint that brown_block_2 must be clear at some point, and if it is, then grey_block_1 must be on top of orange_block_1 at that point or later.

Here's the plan:

1.  Unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_2. This makes brown_block_2 clear.
2.  Stack grey_block_1 on orange_block_1.
3.  Pickup brown_block_2.

```
```
unstack orange_block_1 brown_block_2
stack grey_block_1 orange_block_1
pickup brown_block_2
```
