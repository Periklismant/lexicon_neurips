I need to find an optimal plan to make white_block_1 clear, while ensuring that at some point orange_block_2 has a block on top of it.

Initial state:
- red_block_1 is on the table with grey_block_1 on top, which has brown_block_1 on top (clear)
- white_block_1 is on the table with blue_block_1 on top (clear)
- orange_block_1 is on the table (clear)
- orange_block_2 is on the table (clear)
- The arm is empty

Goal:
- white_block_1 is clear

Constraint:
- At some point, orange_block_2 must have a block on top of it

Since white_block_1 currently has blue_block_1 on top, I need to remove blue_block_1. To satisfy the constraint, I should place blue_block_1 on orange_block_2 at some point.

Here's the optimal plan:

```
unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
stack blue_block_1 orange_block_2
```

This plan:
1. Removes blue_block_1 from white_block_1, making white_block_1 clear (achieving the goal)
2. Places blue_block_1 on orange_block_2, satisfying the constraint that orange_block_2 must have a block on top of it at some point
