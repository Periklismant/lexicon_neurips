To solve this planning problem, we need to achieve the goal of making `white_block_1` clear while ensuring that at some point in the plan, `orange_block_2` is not clear (i.e., there is a block on top of it). 

### Initial State Analysis:
- `grey_block_1` is on top of `red_block_1`.
- `brown_block_1` is on top of `grey_block_1`.
- `blue_block_1` is on top of `white_block_1`.
- `orange_block_1` and `orange_block_2` are on the table and clear.
- The arm is not holding any block.

### Goal:
- `white_block_1` must be clear (no block on top of it).

### Constraints:
- At some point, `orange_block_2` must not be clear (i.e., a block must be placed on it).

### Plan:
1. To make `white_block_1` clear, we need to remove `blue_block_1` from it. This can be done by picking up `blue_block_1` (since it is clear) and placing it somewhere else.
2. To satisfy the constraint, we need to place a block on `orange_block_2` at some point. The only blocks that can be moved are `blue_block_1` (from `white_block_1`) and `brown_block_1` (from `grey_block_1`), since these are the clear blocks not on the table.
3. The optimal plan is to first unstack `brown_block_1` from `grey_block_1`, then stack it on `orange_block_2` (satisfying the constraint), then unstack `blue_block_1` from `white_block_1` and put it down on the table (achieving the goal).

### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. Unstack `brown_block_1` from `grey_block_1` (since `brown_block_1` is clear and the arm is empty).
   - Effect: Arm holds `brown_block_1`, `grey_block_1` becomes clear.
2. Stack `brown_block_1` on `orange_block_2` (since `orange_block_2` is clear and the arm holds `brown_block_1`).
   - Effect: `brown_block_1` is on `orange_block_2`, `orange_block_2` is not clear (constraint satisfied), arm is empty.
3. Unstack `blue_block_1` from `white_block_1` (since `blue_block_1` is clear and the arm is empty).
   - Effect: Arm holds `blue_block_1`, `white_block_1` becomes clear (goal achieved).
4. Putdown `blue_block_1` on the table (since the arm holds `blue_block_1`).
   - Effect: `blue_block_1` is on the table, arm is empty.

### Final Plan:
```
```
unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
stack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
```
