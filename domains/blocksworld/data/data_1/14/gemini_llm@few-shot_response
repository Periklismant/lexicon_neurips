Okay, let's break this down. The goal is to make white_block_1 clear. Currently, blue_block_1 is on top of it. So, we need to remove blue_block_1. Also, we need to satisfy the constraint that orange_block_2 must have a block on top of it at some point.

Here's the plan:

1.  Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1.
2.  Putdown blue_block_1 on the table.
3.  Pickup orange_block_1.
4.  Stack orange_block_1 orange_block_2.
5.  Unstack orange_block_1 orange_block_2.
6.  Putdown orange_block_1.

```
```
unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
pickup orange_block_1
stack orange_block_1 orange_block_2
unstack orange_block_1 orange_block_2
putdown orange_block_1
```
