Let me analyze the planning problem:

Initial state:
- red_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- orange_block_2 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is clear
- blue_block_1 is clear
- orange_block_1 is clear
- orange_block_2 is clear
- hand is empty

Goal state:
- white_block_1 is clear

Constraint:
- At some point, orange_block_2 must have a block on top of it (i.e., it must not be clear)

The initial configuration can be visualized as:
```
    brown_block_1     blue_block_1
    grey_block_1      white_block_1    orange_block_1  orange_block_2
    red_block_1       
    -------------------------------------------------TABLE-------------------------------------------------
```

In the initial state, white_block_1 is not clear because blue_block_1 is on top of it. So to achieve the goal, we need to remove blue_block_1 from white_block_1.

Also, at some point during our plan, we need to place a block on top of orange_block_2. 

Let's use blue_block_1 (the one we need to remove anyway) and stack it on orange_block_2 to satisfy the constraint:

1. "unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1" - This picks up blue_block_1 from white_block_1
2. "stack blue_block_1 orange_block_2" - This puts blue_block_1 on top of orange_block_2, satisfying our constraint

At this point, white_block_1 is clear (our goal), and orange_block_2 has a block on top of it (satisfying our constraint). So the plan is:

```
unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
stack blue_block_1 orange_block_2
```

Actually, let me double-check if this plan satisfies all requirements by going through it step-by-step and verifying the state after each action:

Initial state:
- red_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- orange_block_2 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is clear
- blue_block_1 is clear
- orange_block_1 is clear
- orange_block_2 is clear
- hand is empty

Action 1: "unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1"
Preconditions: blue_block_1 is on white_block_1, blue_block_1 is clear, hand is empty
Effects: blue_block_1 is being held, blue_block_1 is no longer on white_block_1, white_block_1 is clear

State after Action 1:
- red_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- blue_block_1 is being held
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- orange_block_2 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is clear
- white_block_1 is clear
- orange_block_1 is clear
- orange_block_2 is clear
- hand is holding blue_block_1

Action 2: "stack blue_block_1 orange_block_2"
Preconditions: blue_block_1 is being held, orange_block_2 is clear
Effects: blue_block_1 is on orange_block_2, blue_block_1 is clear, orange_block_2 is not clear, hand is empty

State after Action 2:
- red_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- orange_block_2 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is clear
- white_block_1 is clear
- orange_block_1 is clear
- blue_block_1 is clear
- hand is empty

At this point, white_block_1 is clear (our goal), and orange_block_2 has a block on top of it (satisfying our constraint). So the plan is valid and achieves both the goal and satisfies the constraint.

So the optimal plan is:
```
unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
stack blue_block_1 orange_block_2
```

This plan has 2 actions, which I believe is the minimum possible to achieve the goal while satisfying the constraint.

Actually, let me triple-check the preconditions of the "unstack" action again:

"unstack" preconditions:
(i) block b1 is on top of block b2
(ii) block b1 does not have any block on top of it, i.e., b1 is "clear"
(iii) you are not currently holding any block.

For "unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1":
- blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 ✓
- blue_block_1 is clear ✓
- hand is empty ✓

So yes, the preconditions for the "unstack" action are met. 

The plan is valid and optimal:
```
unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
stack blue_block_1 orange_block_2
```
