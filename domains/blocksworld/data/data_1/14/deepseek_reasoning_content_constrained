Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to make sure white_block_1 is clear. In the initial state, blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, so I need to remove that. But there's a constraint that at some point, orange_block_2 must have a block on top of it. So the plan must include stacking something onto orange_block_2.

First, let's see the initial state. The blocks on the table are red_block_1 (with grey and brown on it), white_block_1 (with blue on it), orange_block_1, and orange_block_2. So blue_block_1 is on white_block_1, making white_block_1 not clear. To make white_block_1 clear, I need to remove blue_block_1. How?

The possible actions are to unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1. But to do that, blue_block_1 must be clear, which it is. So unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1. Then, after that, I can put it down somewhere. But wait, the constraint requires that orange_block_2 has a block on top in at least one state. So maybe after picking up blue_block_1, I can stack it onto orange_block_2. That would satisfy the constraint.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1. This requires that blue_block_1 is clear (it is), and the arm is empty (it is). After unstacking, I'm holding blue_block_1, and white_block_1 becomes clear. But the goal is already achieved here, but we need to check if the plan meets all constraints. However, the constraint is that orange_block_2 must have a block on top at some point. So if I just put down blue_block_1 on the table, that doesn't satisfy the constraint. So I need to stack it onto orange_block_2.

So the steps would be:

- Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1. Now holding blue_block_1.
- Stack blue_block_1 onto orange_block_2. Now orange_block_2 has blue_block_1 on top, meeting the constraint.

After stacking, white_block_1 is clear (since blue is removed), and orange_block_2 is not clear. So this would satisfy both the goal and the constraint. Let's check preconditions for each action.

Unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1: blue is on white, blue is clear, arm is empty. Yes.

Stack blue_block_1 orange_block_2: need to be holding blue and orange_block_2 is clear. Orange_block_2 is initially clear. After unstacking, arm is holding blue. So stack blue onto orange_block_2. That works.

So the plan would be:

unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
stack blue_block_1 orange_block_2

But wait, after stacking, the arm is empty again, and the goal is achieved. That's two actions. Let me check if this is optimal. Any shorter plan? Well, the goal is to have white_block_1 clear, which happens after the first action. But the constraint requires that in at least one state, orange_block_2 has a block on top. If the plan ends after the first action, then the constraint isn't met. So we need to perform the stack. So the two actions are necessary.

Is there any other way? Maybe putting down blue_block_1 and then picking it up again to stack on orange_block_2, but that's longer. So the optimal plan is the two steps. Let me verify the effects.

After unstacking blue from white: blue is held, white is clear. Then stack blue onto orange_block_2: blue is on orange_block_2, orange_block_2 is not clear. This meets the constraint. The final state has white_block_1 clear (from the first action) and the constraint is met during the stack action (in the state after stacking, orange_block_2 has a block on top). So yes, this plan works.
