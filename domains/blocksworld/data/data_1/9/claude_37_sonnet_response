Let's analyze the problem:

1. Initial State:
   - green_block_1 is on the table
   - blue_block_1 is on the table
   - purple_block_1 is on the table
   - orange_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
   - purple_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1
   - yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
   - blue_block_2 is on the table
   - orange_block_1 is clear
   - purple_block_2 is clear
   - yellow_block_1 is clear
   - blue_block_2 is clear
   - The robot arm is not holding any block

2. Goal:
   - purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1

3. Additional Constraint:
   - At least one of: "blue_block_1 is not on the table" or "blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1" must be true at some point in the plan.

Let's visualize the initial configuration:

```
    orange_block_1  yellow_block_1  purple_block_2   blue_block_2
    green_block_1    blue_block_1   purple_block_1     (table)
        (table)        (table)         (table)
```

And the goal configuration:

```
                    purple_block_1
                    yellow_block_1
                    (some block or the table)
```

Now, let's think about how to achieve the goal while satisfying the constraint.

To get purple_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1, we first need to pick up yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1. But before that, we need to ensure purple_block_1 is clear, which means we need to remove purple_block_2 from purple_block_1.

The constraint says that at some point in our plan, either blue_block_1 must not be on the table, or blue_block_2 must be on top of orange_block_1. 

Let's think about the easier constraint to satisfy: putting blue_block_2 on top of orange_block_1. To do this, we need orange_block_1 to be clear (which it already is in the initial state) and the robot arm not holding any block (which is also true in the initial state). We simply need to pickup blue_block_2 and stack it on orange_block_1.

Here's a plan that achieves the goal while satisfying the constraint:

1. First, let's satisfy the constraint by putting blue_block_2 on top of orange_block_1:
   - pickup blue_block_2 (from the table)
   - stack blue_block_2 orange_block_1

   Now blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1, which satisfies the constraint.

2. Now, let's make purple_block_1 clear by removing purple_block_2:
   - unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
   - putdown purple_block_2 (onto the table)

3. Now, let's get yellow_block_1:
   - unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
   - putdown yellow_block_1 (onto the table)

4. Finally, let's place purple_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1:
   - pickup purple_block_1 (from the table)
   - stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1

This plan should achieve the goal and satisfy the constraint. Let me quickly review it:

1. pickup blue_block_2
2. stack blue_block_2 orange_block_1
   (Constraint satisfied: blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1)
3. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
4. putdown purple_block_2
5. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
6. putdown yellow_block_1
7. pickup purple_block_1
8. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
   (Goal achieved: purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1)

Let me verify that this plan is valid:

Starting from the initial state:
1. "pickup blue_block_2" - This is valid since blue_block_2 is on the table, it's clear, and the arm is not holding anything.
2. "stack blue_block_2 orange_block_1" - This is valid since the arm is holding blue_block_2, and orange_block_1 is clear.
3. "unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1" - This is valid since purple_block_2 is clear, it's on top of purple_block_1, and the arm is not holding anything.
4. "putdown purple_block_2" - This is valid since the arm is holding purple_block_2.
5. "unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1" - This is valid since yellow_block_1 is clear, it's on top of blue_block_1, and the arm is not holding anything.
6. "putdown yellow_block_1" - This is valid since the arm is holding yellow_block_1.
7. "pickup purple_block_1" - This is valid since purple_block_1 is now on the table and clear (after purple_block_2, which was on top of it, was removed), and the arm is not holding anything.
8. "stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1" - This is valid since the arm is holding purple_block_1, and yellow_block_1 is clear.

So the plan is valid. Let me check if it's optimal.

Actually, I'm not sure if the plan is optimal. Let's think about an alternative plan:

An alternative approach could be to satisfy the constraint by moving blue_block_1 off the table.

1. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
   (now yellow_block_1 is clear, and we can directly put purple_block_1 on it)
2. putdown yellow_block_1
3. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
4. stack purple_block_2 blue_block_1
   (Constraint satisfied: blue_block_1 is not on the table, as purple_block_2 is on top of it)
5. pickup purple_block_1
6. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
   (Goal achieved: purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1)

This plan has 6 steps, compared to our original plan with 8 steps. So this seems more optimal. 

Let me verify this plan:

Starting from the initial state:
1. "unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1" - This is valid since yellow_block_1 is clear, it's on top of blue_block_1, and the arm is not holding anything.
2. "putdown yellow_block_1" - This is valid since the arm is holding yellow_block_1.
3. "unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1" - This is valid since purple_block_2 is clear, it's on top of purple_block_1, and the arm is not holding anything.
4. "stack purple_block_2 blue_block_1" - This is valid since the arm is holding purple_block_2, and blue_block_1 is clear (after yellow_block_1, which was on top of it, was removed).
   (Constraint satisfied: blue_block_1 is not on the table, because purple_block_2 is on top of it)
5. "pickup purple_block_1" - This is valid since purple_block_1 is on the table and clear (after purple_block_2, which was on top of it, was removed), and the arm is not holding anything.
6. "stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1" - This is valid since the arm is holding purple_block_1, and yellow_block_1 is clear.

This plan is valid and more optimal than the original one.

Wait, I need to double check step 4:
4. "stack purple_block_2 blue_block_1"

The preconditions for this action are:
1. You are holding purple_block_2 (which is true after step 3)
2. blue_block_1 is clear (which is true after step 1)

So this step is valid. And after this step, the constraint is satisfied because blue_block_1 is not on the table (purple_block_2 is now on top of it).

Actually, let me recheck the problem statement to see if the constraint must be true at some point during the execution of the plan or in the final state. 

Looking at the constraint:
"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "blue_block_1 is not on the table", "blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1"'"

This constraint requires that at some state (not necessarily the final state) either blue_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1.

So, both of our plans satisfy this constraint at some point:
- In the original plan, blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1 after step 2.
- In the alternative plan, blue_block_1 is not on the table after step 4.

So the alternative plan with 6 steps should be more optimal.

Actually, let me re-think the alternative plan again. The goal here is to get purple_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1. Let me trace the state of the world after each action to make sure it works correctly.

Initial state:
   - green_block_1 is on the table
   - blue_block_1 is on the table
   - purple_block_1 is on the table
   - orange_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
   - purple_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1
   - yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
   - blue_block_2 is on the table
   - orange_block_1 is clear
   - purple_block_2 is clear
   - yellow_block_1 is clear
   - blue_block_2 is clear
   - The robot arm is not holding any block

After unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1:
   - green_block_1 is on the table
   - blue_block_1 is on the table
   - purple_block_1 is on the table
   - orange_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
   - purple_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1
   - The robot arm is holding yellow_block_1
   - blue_block_2 is on the table
   - orange_block_1 is clear
   - purple_block_2 is clear
   - blue_block_1 is clear
   - blue_block_2 is clear

After putdown yellow_block_1:
   - green_block_1 is on the table
   - blue_block_1 is on the table
   - purple_block_1 is on the table
   - orange_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
   - purple_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1
   - yellow_block_1 is on the table
   - blue_block_2 is on the table
   - orange_block_1 is clear
   - purple_block_2 is clear
   - blue_block_1 is clear
   - blue_block_2 is clear
   - yellow_block_1 is clear
   - The robot arm is not holding any block

After unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1:
   - green_block_1 is on the table
   - blue_block_1 is on the table
   - purple_block_1 is on the table
   - orange_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
   - The robot arm is holding purple_block_2
   - yellow_block_1 is on the table
   - blue_block_2 is on the table
   - orange_block_1 is clear
   - blue_block_1 is clear
   - blue_block_2 is clear
   - yellow_block_1 is clear
   - purple_block_1 is clear

After stack purple_block_2 blue_block_1:
   - green_block_1 is on the table
   - blue_block_1 is on the table
   - purple_block_1 is on the table
   - orange_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
   - purple_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
   - yellow_block_1 is on the table
   - blue_block_2 is on the table
   - orange_block_1 is clear
   - purple_block_2 is clear
   - blue_block_2 is clear
   - yellow_block_1 is clear
   - purple_block_1 is clear
   - The robot arm is not holding any block

After pickup purple_block_1:
   - green_block_1 is on the table
   - blue_block_1 is on the table
   - orange_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
   - purple_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
   - yellow_block_1 is on the table
   - blue_block_2 is on the table
   - The robot arm is holding purple_block_1
   - orange_block_1 is clear
   - purple_block_2 is clear
   - blue_block_2 is clear
   - yellow_block_1 is clear

After stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1:
   - green_block_1 is on the table
   - blue_block_1 is on the table
   - orange_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
   - purple_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
   - yellow_block_1 is on the table
   - blue_block_2 is on the table
   - purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
   - orange_block_1 is clear
   - purple_block_2 is clear
   - blue_block_2 is clear
   - purple_block_1 is clear
   - The robot arm is not holding any block

So the final state has purple_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1, which is our goal.

But wait, I need to double check if this plan is valid. 

In particular, I said that after step 4 (stack purple_block_2 blue_block_1), blue_block_1 is not on the table. But the problem statement doesn't say that if a block has another block on top of it, then it's not on the table. It only says we can place a block directly on the table or on top of another block.

So, the statement "blue_block_1 is not on the table" might not be correct if blue_block_1 is still on the table with purple_block_2 on top of it. Let me reconsider the problem statement.

Ok, so the initial state says that blue_block_1 is on the table, and that yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1. So in the initial state, blue_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top of it.

Let me try to better understand the constraint. The constraint requires that at some state, either blue_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1.

If blue_block_1 is on the table in the initial state, even with yellow_block_1 on top of it, then the only way for blue_block_1 to be "not on the table" is if we pick it up.

So, with this understanding, our alternative plan may not satisfy the constraint after all. Let's reconsider.

For the constraint to be satisfied, we need to either:
1. Pick up blue_block_1 (so it's not on the table)
2. Stack blue_block_2 on top of orange_block_1

Let's try option 1:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1
3. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
4. putdown purple_block_2
5. pickup blue_block_1
   (Constraint satisfied: blue_block_1 is not on the table, because the robot arm is holding it)
6. putdown blue_block_1
7. pickup purple_block_1
8. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
   (Goal achieved: purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1)

This plan has 8 steps.

Let's try option 2:

1. pickup blue_block_2
2. stack blue_block_2 orange_block_1
   (Constraint satisfied: blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1)
3. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
6. putdown purple_block_2
7. pickup purple_block_1
8. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
   (Goal achieved: purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1)

This plan also has 8 steps.

Actually, I realize i've been misinterpreting the problem statement. When the constraint says "blue_block_1 is not on the table", it means blue_block_1 is not directly on the table. If blue_block_1 has a block on top of it, it could still be on the table.

Let me go back to the initial state of the problem. In the initial state, we're told "blue_block_1 is on the table", even though we're also told "yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1". So a block can be on the table and have another block on top of it.

So for the constraint "blue_block_1 is not on the table" to be true, blue_block_1 needs to be not directly on the table. This could be achieved by picking up blue_block_1, or by placing blue_block_1 on top of another block.

Given that, let's reconsider our plans.

Let's try a new plan:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1
3. pickup blue_block_1
4. stack blue_block_1 blue_block_2
   (Constraint satisfied: blue_block_1 is not on the table, because it's on top of blue_block_2)
5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
6. putdown purple_block_2
7. pickup purple_block_1
8. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
   (Goal achieved: purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1)

This plan has 8 steps.

Let's try another plan, directly satisfying the constraint with blue_block_2 on top of orange_block_1:

1. pickup blue_block_2
2. stack blue_block_2 orange_block_1
   (Constraint satisfied: blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1)
3. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
4. putdown purple_block_2
5. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
6. putdown yellow_block_1
7. pickup purple_block_1
8. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
   (Goal achieved: purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1)

This plan also has 8 steps.

Oh wait, we can also satisfy the constraint by putting blue_block_1 on top of another block. Let's try:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1
3. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
4. putdown purple_block_2
5. pickup blue_block_1
6. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_2
   (Constraint satisfied: blue_block_1 is not on the table, because it's on top of purple_block_2)
7. pickup purple_block_1
8. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
   (Goal achieved: purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1)

This plan also has 8 steps.

Hmm, any other optimizations possible?

Actually, let me double-check the plan where we tried to satisfy the constraint by putting purple_block_2 on top of blue_block_1, but I was unsure if this would make blue_block_1 "not on the table":

1. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1
3. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
4. stack purple_block_2 blue_block_1

After these steps, if we consider "blue_block_1 is not on the table" to mean "blue_block_1 does not have direct contact with the table", then this is not achieved since blue_block_1 is still on the table, just with purple_block_2 on top of it. Blue_block_1 doesn't get lifted for the constraint to be satisfied.

So this plan doesn't satisfy the constraint. 

Actually, let me go back and more carefully read the problem statement:

"blue_block_1 is on the table" and "yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1"

So an object can be both on the table and have another object on top of it.

The constraint says that we need to have a state where either "blue_block_1 is not on the table" or "blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1".

For blue_block_1 to not be on the table, it would need to be either picked up by the arm or stacked on top of another block.

Let's try a different plan:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1
3. pickup blue_block_1
4. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_2
   (Constraint satisfied: blue_block_1 is not on the table, because it's on top of purple_block_2)
5. pickup purple_block_1
6. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
   (Goal achieved: purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1)

Hmm, this is only 6 steps. 

But wait, I need to double-check if this plan is valid.

Let me trace the state of the world after each action:

Initial state:
   - green_block_1 is on the table
   - blue_block_1 is on the table
   - purple_block_1 is on the table
   - orange_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
   - purple_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1
   - yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
   - blue_block_2 is on the table
   - orange_block_1 is clear
   - purple_block_2 is clear
   - yellow_block_1 is clear
   - blue_block_2 is clear
   - The robot arm is not holding any block

After unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1:
   - green_block_1 is on the table
   - blue_block_1 is on the table
   - purple_block_1 is on the table
   - orange_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
   - purple_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1
   - The robot arm is holding yellow_block_1
   - blue_block_2 is on the table
   - orange_block_1 is clear
   - purple_block_2 is clear
   - blue_block_1 is clear
   - blue_block_2 is clear

After putdown yellow_block_1:
   - green_block_1 is on the table
   - blue_block_1 is on the table
   - purple_block_1 is on the table
   - orange_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
   - purple_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1
   - yellow_block_1 is on the table
   - blue_block_2 is on the table
   - orange_block_1 is clear
   - purple_block_2 is clear
   - blue_block_1 is clear
   - blue_block_2 is clear
   - yellow_block_1 is clear
   - The robot arm is not holding any block

After pickup blue_block_1:
   - green_block_1 is on the table
   - purple_block_1 is on the table
   - orange_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
   - purple_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1
   - yellow_block_1 is on the table
   - blue_block_2 is on the table
   - The robot arm is holding blue_block_1
   - orange_block_1 is clear
   - purple_block_2 is clear
   - blue_block_2 is clear
   - yellow_block_1 is clear

After stack blue_block_1 purple_block_2:
   - Wait, this is not valid because purple_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1, so it's not available to be stacked upon.

So that plan is not valid. Let me reconsider.

Let's try a different approach:

1. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
2. putdown purple_block_2
3. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
4. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2
   (This is to put yellow_block_1 safely while we manipulate other blocks)
5. pickup blue_block_1
6. stack blue_block_1 blue_block_2
   (Constraint satisfied: blue_block_1 is not on the table, because it's on top of blue_block_2)
7. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2
8. putdown yellow_block_1
9. pickup purple_block_1
10. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
    (Goal achieved: purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1)

This plan has 10 steps, which is not optimal.

Let's try a new approach:

Initial state:
   - green_block_1 is on the table
   - blue_block_1 is on the table
   - purple_block_1 is on the table
   - orange_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
   - purple_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1
   - yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
   - blue_block_2 is on the table
   - orange_block_1 is clear
   - purple_block_2 is clear
   - yellow_block_1 is clear
   - blue_block_2 is clear
   - The robot arm is not holding any block

One approach is to move blue_block_1 to be on top of blue_block_2 (to satisfy the constraint).

1. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1
3. pickup blue_block_1
4. stack blue_block_1 blue_block_2
   (Constraint satisfied: blue_block_1 is not on the table, because it's on top of blue_block_2)
5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
6. putdown purple_block_2
7. pickup purple_block_1
8. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
   (Goal achieved: purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1)

This plan has 8 steps.

Another approach would be to directly pick up blue_block_1, as holding it also satisfies the constraint.

1. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1
3. pickup blue_block_1
   (Constraint satisfied: blue_block_1 is not on the table, because the robot arm is holding it)
4. putdown blue_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
6. putdown purple_block_2
7. pickup purple_block_1
8. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
   (Goal achieved: purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1)

This plan also has 8 steps.

A third approach is to place blue_block_2 on top of orange_block_1 to satisfy the constraint.

1. pickup blue_block_2
2. stack blue_block_2 orange_block_1
   (Constraint satisfied: blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1)
3. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
4. putdown purple_block_2
5. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
6. putdown yellow_block_1
7. pickup purple_block_1
8. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
   (Goal achieved: purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1)

This plan also has 8 steps.

All three plans have 8 steps. Let's check if there's any other way to optimize:

Another approach would be to directly satisfy the constraint by stacking blue_block_1 on top of something.

1. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1
3. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
4. putdown purple_block_2
5. pickup blue_block_1
6. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_2
   (Constraint satisfied: blue_block_1 is not on the table, because it's on top of purple_block_2)
7. pickup purple_block_1
8. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
   (Goal achieved: purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1)

This plan also has 8 steps.

What if we try a different ordering?

1. pickup blue_block_2
2. stack blue_block_2 orange_block_1
   (Constraint satisfied: blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1)
3. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
6. putdown purple_block_2
7. pickup purple_block_1
8. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
   (Goal achieved: purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1)

This plan also has 8 steps.

Actually, the constraint actually helps us here. Initially I was assuming the constraint would add more steps to our solution to achieve the goal. But as the constraint says we need to be in a state where either "blue_block_1 is not on the table" or "blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1" at some moment, we can easily pick the one that corresponds to the most efficient and direct path to achieving our goal.

Since we need to place purple_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1, we need to make sure:
1. purple_block_1 is clear (currently, it has purple_block_2 on top, so we need to remove that)
2. yellow_block_1 is clear (it's already clear initially)
3. We don't have a block in the arm (initially, we don't have a block in the arm)

Now, to place purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1, we need to unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1, and then unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1. After completing these two actions, we would have placed yellow_block_1 on the table and unstacked purple_block_2 from purple_block_1. Then, we can pick up purple_block_1 and place it on top of yellow_block_1.

This would be:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1
3. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
4. putdown purple_block_2 (or do something else with it to satisfy the constraint)
5. pickup purple_block_1
6. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1

If we stick with this approach, we have 6 steps. But we still need to satisfy the constraint, which may require additional steps. The constraint requires that at some point, either "blue_block_1 is not on the table" or "blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1".

Since blue_block_1 is the one we've just exposed by removing yellow_block_1, and we need to satisfy the constraint, one efficient approach would be to pick up blue_block_1 after unstacking yellow_block_1. This would satisfy the constraint.

Let's see:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1
3. pickup blue_block_1
   (Constraint satisfied: blue_block_1 is not on the table, because the robot arm is holding it)
4. putdown blue_block_1 (or stack it somewhere)
5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
6. putdown purple_block_2
7. pickup purple_block_1
8. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
   (Goal achieved: purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1)

This plan has 8 steps.

Alternatively, we could try to satisfy the constraint right away by placing blue_block_2 on top of orange_block_1:

1. pickup blue_block_2
2. stack blue_block_2 orange_block_1
   (Constraint satisfied: blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1)
3. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
6. putdown purple_block_2
7. pickup purple_block_1
8. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
   (Goal achieved: purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1)

This also has 8 steps. 

Actually, what if we tried to optimize by combining the steps to satisfy the constraint and achieve the goal? For instance, after we unstack yellow_block_1, we can directly stack it on top of another block (instead of putting it down on the table), to clear up the arm for the next manipulation, similar to what I tried earlier. 

Let me verify the preconditions for the stack action first. We can stack block x on block y if:
1. We are holding block x
2. Block y is clear

So, after unstacking yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1, we can directly stack it on another clear block.

Let's try this:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
   (Now we're holding yellow_block_1, and blue_block_1 is exposed on the table)
2. stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_2
   (Now yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2, and our arm is empty)
3. pickup blue_block_1
   (Constraint satisfied: blue_block_1 is not on the table, because the robot arm is holding it)
4. putdown blue_block_1 (to free up the arm)
5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
6. putdown purple_block_2 (to free up the arm)
7. pickup purple_block_1
8. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_2
   (Now we need to undo what we did in step 2 to get yellow_block_1 back)
9. putdown yellow_block_1
10. pickup purple_block_1
11. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
    (Goal achieved: purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1)

This plan has 11 steps, which is not optimal.

After trying various approaches, it seems like the most straightforward approach is the following:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1
3. pickup blue_block_1
   (Constraint satisfied: blue_block_1 is not on the table, because the robot arm is holding it)
4. putdown blue_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
6. putdown purple_block_2
7. pickup purple_block_1
8. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
   (Goal achieved: purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1)

But I've been making a mistake throughout: blue_block_1 is on the table for all of the plans above, even when it's removed from the table. This is a specific state that changes. It's "on the table" in the initial state, but after "pickup blue_block_1", it's no longer on the table. It's in the arm.

So, for the constraint to be satisfied, blue_block_1 should not be on the table at some point in the plan OR blue_block_2 should be on top of orange_block_1 at some point in the plan.

In the latest plan, after step 3, blue_block_1 is not on the table (it's in the arm), which satisfies the constraint.

So, I believe the plan I outlined above (with 8 steps) is optimal. Let me double check it:

1. First, we need to clear yellow_block_1 and purple_block_1. Yellow_block_1 is already clear, but is on top of blue_block_1. Purple_block_1 has purple_block_2 on top.
2. We need to unstack yellow_block_1 to expose blue_block_1. After that, to satisfy the constraint, we can pick up blue_block_1 (which will make it not on the table).
3. Then, we need to unstack purple_block_2 to make purple_block_1 clear.
4. Finally, we can pick up purple_block_1 and stack it on top of yellow_block_1.

This gives us the 8-step plan I outlined, which I believe is optimal for this problem.

Actually, let's try a different approach, just to make sure.

1. pickup blue_block_2
2. stack blue_block_2 orange_block_1
   (Constraint satisfied: blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1)
3. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
6. putdown purple_block_2
7. pickup purple_block_1
8. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
   (Goal achieved: purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1)

This plan also has 8 steps and seems reasonable. The key is to satisfy the constraint (using either of the two options) and then proceed with clearing both yellow_block_1 and purple_block_1 before stacking them.

I'm pretty confident that 8 steps is the optimal plan's length for this problem.

Let me finalize the plan and ensure it's fully valid:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1
3. pickup blue_block_1
   (Constraint satisfied: blue_block_1 is not on the table, because the robot arm is holding it)
4. putdown blue_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
6. putdown purple_block_2
7. pickup purple_block_1
8. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
   (Goal achieved: purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1)

This plan is valid, satisfies the constraint, and has 8 steps. I believe it's an optimal plan for this problem.

Actually, let's do one more check. Intuitively, the minimal number of steps to achieve the goal would be:
1. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
2. putdown purple_block_2
3. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
4. putdown yellow_block_1
5. pickup purple_block_1
6. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1

That's 6 steps. And the minimal number of additional steps to satisfy the constraint "blue_block_1 is not on the table" would be 2 steps: pickup blue_block_1 and putdown blue_block_1. Alternatively, to satisfy "blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1", it would also take 2 steps: pickup blue_block_2 and stack blue_block_2 orange_block_1.

So, 8 steps seems like the optimal plan's length for this problem.

Checking once more, here are the plans we've considered:

1. Plan where we pick up blue_block_1 to satisfy the constraint:
   - unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
   - putdown yellow_block_1
   - pickup blue_block_1
   - putdown blue_block_1
   - unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
   - putdown purple_block_2
   - pickup purple_block_1
   - stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1

2. Plan where we stack blue_block_2 on orange_block_1 to satisfy the constraint:
   - pickup blue_block_2
   - stack blue_block_2 orange_block_1
   - unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
   - putdown yellow_block_1
   - unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
   - putdown purple_block_2
   - pickup purple_block_1
   - stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1

Both plans have 8 steps and both are valid. They both achieve the goal and satisfy the constraint. So, I believe 8 steps is indeed the optimal plan's length for this problem.

But actually, let me think if there's any other approach we can try. 

Let's try manipulating the blocks in a different order:

1. pickup blue_block_2
2. stack blue_block_2 orange_block_1
   (Constraint satisfied: blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1)
3. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
4. putdown purple_block_2
5. pickup purple_block_1
6. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
   Oops, this step is not valid because the arm is already holding purple_block_1.

So, the order from the plan where we clear blue_block_1 first, then clear purple_block_1, seems to be the best approach.

I believe 8 steps is the optimal plan's length for this problem, and the two plans I've outlined are both valid and optimal. Let's stick with the first one, where we pick up blue_block_1 to satisfy the constraint.

For clarity, here's the final valid and optimal plan:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1
3. pickup blue_block_1
   (Constraint satisfied: blue_block_1 is not on the table, because the robot arm is holding it)
4. putdown blue_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
6. putdown purple_block_2
7. pickup purple_block_1
8. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
   (Goal achieved: purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1)
