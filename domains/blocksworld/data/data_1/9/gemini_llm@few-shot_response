Okay, let's break this down. The goal is to get purple_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1. We need to consider the initial state and the constraints. The constraint requires either blue_block_1 to be off the table or blue_block_2 to be on top of orange_block_1 at some point.

Here's the plan:

1.  Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1. This gets yellow_block_1 clear and satisfies the preconditions for stacking purple_block_1 on it later.
2.  Putdown yellow_block_1 on the table.
3.  Unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1.
4.  Putdown purple_block_2 on the table.
5.  Pickup purple_block_1.
6.  Pickup yellow_block_1.
7.  Stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1. This achieves the goal.
8. Pickup blue_block_2.
9. Stack blue_block_2 orange_block_1. This satisfies the constraint.

```
```
unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
putdown yellow_block_1
unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
putdown purple_block_2
pickup purple_block_1
pickup yellow_block_1
stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
pickup blue_block_2
stack blue_block_2 orange_block_1
```
