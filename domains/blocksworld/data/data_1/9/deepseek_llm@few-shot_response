Let's break down the problem step by step to find an optimal plan that achieves the goal while satisfying the given constraint.

### Initial State:
- green_block_1 is on the table, with orange_block_1 on top (orange_block_1 is clear).
- blue_block_1 is on the table, with yellow_block_1 on top (yellow_block_1 is clear).
- purple_block_1 is on the table, with purple_block_2 on top (purple_block_2 is clear).
- blue_block_2 is on the table (clear).
- The arm is empty.

### Goal:
- purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1.

### Constraint:
- At least one of the following must hold in some state:
  - "blue_block_1 is not on the table", or
  - "blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1".

### Plan Steps:
1. To move purple_block_1 onto yellow_block_1, we first need to clear purple_block_1 (i.e., remove purple_block_2 from it).
2. Then, we need to clear yellow_block_1 (it's already clear).
3. Finally, we can stack purple_block_1 onto yellow_block_1.

However, we must also ensure the constraint is satisfied at some point. The constraint can be satisfied by either:
- Moving blue_block_1 (making it not on the table), or
- Stacking blue_block_2 onto orange_block_1.

Let's choose the second option (stacking blue_block_2 onto orange_block_1) because it seems more straightforward and can be done early in the plan.

### Optimal Plan:
```
```
unstack orange_block_1 green_block_1
putdown orange_block_1
pickup blue_block_2
stack blue_block_2 orange_block_1
pickup purple_block_2
putdown purple_block_2
pickup purple_block_1
stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
```

### Explanation:
1. **unstack orange_block_1 green_block_1**: This clears green_block_1 and allows us to later stack blue_block_2 onto orange_block_1.
2. **putdown orange_block_1**: Place orange_block_1 on the table to free the arm.
3. **pickup blue_block_2**: Pick up blue_block_2 to stack it onto orange_block_1.
4. **stack blue_block_2 orange_block_1**: This satisfies the constraint ("blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1").
5. **pickup purple_block_2**: Clear purple_block_1 by removing purple_block_2.
6. **putdown purple_block_2**: Place purple_block_2 on the table to free the arm.
7. **pickup purple_block_1**: Pick up purple_block_1 to stack it onto yellow_block_1.
8. **stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1**: Achieve the goal.

This plan is optimal (8 steps) and satisfies the constraint at step 4. No shorter plan exists that achieves the goal while satisfying the constraint.

### Alternative Approach:
Another way to satisfy the constraint is to move blue_block_1 (making it not on the table). However, this would require more steps (e.g., unstacking yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1, then moving blue_block_1, then proceeding with the goal). This would lead to a longer plan, so the above plan is indeed optimal.
