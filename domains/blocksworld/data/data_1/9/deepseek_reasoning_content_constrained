Okay, let's try to figure out this Blocksworld problem. So, the initial state has several blocks arranged in specific ways, and the goal is to get purple_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1. Plus, there's a constraint that in at least one state of the plan, either blue_block_1 isn't on the table or blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1. Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, let's look at the initial state. From what's given:

- green_block_1 is on the table, with orange_block_1 on top of it. Orange is clear.
- blue_block_1 is on the table, with yellow_block_1 on top. Yellow is clear.
- purple_block_1 is on the table, with purple_block_2 on top. Purple_block_2 is clear.
- blue_block_2 is on the table and clear.
- The other blocks (like purple_block_2, yellow, etc.) are clear, so nothing is on top of them.

The goal is to have purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1. So, right now, yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1, which is on the table. To put purple_block_1 on yellow, we need to first clear yellow_block_1. Wait, but yellow is already clear. Wait, no: in the initial state, yellow_block_1 is on blue_block_1, and it's clear. So to stack something on yellow_block_1, we can do that directly, as long as we're holding the block to stack. But purple_block_1 is currently under purple_block_2. So we need to move purple_block_2 off of purple_block_1 first.

So steps needed:

1. Unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1 and put it down somewhere. Then we can pick up purple_block_1.

But wait, after unstacking purple_block_2, we need to put it down. Then, we can pick up purple_block_1. Then stack it on yellow_block_1. But yellow is under yellow_block_1, which is on blue_block_1. Wait, no: the goal is to have purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1. Wait, but yellow is on blue_block_1. So after stacking purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1, the structure would be blue_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 -> purple_block_1. That's acceptable, right?

Wait, but to stack purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1, we need to have purple_block_1 in hand, which requires that purple_block_1 is clear. But currently, purple_block_1 has purple_block_2 on top. So first, we need to remove purple_block_2.

So steps:

- Unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1. Then put it down. Then pick up purple_block_1 and stack it on yellow_block_1.

But wait, after unstacking purple_block_2, the arm is holding it. So we need to put it down. Then pick up purple_block_1, which is now clear. Then stack it on yellow_block_1.

But let's check the preconditions for each step.

First, unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1:

Preconditions: purple_block_2 is on purple_block_1, purple_block_2 is clear, and the arm is not holding anything. Which is true in the initial state. So that's possible. After unstacking, the arm is holding purple_block_2, purple_block_1 becomes clear, and purple_block_2 is no longer on purple_block_1.

Then, we can putdown purple_block_2. Putdown requires holding it, which we are. So that's possible. After putdown, purple_block_2 is on the table, clear, and the arm is empty.

Then, we can pickup purple_block_1. Since it's on the table and clear (after unstacking the purple_block_2), and the arm is empty. So that's possible. Then, we are holding purple_block_1.

Now, we need to stack it on yellow_block_1. Stack requires that we are holding purple_block_1 and that yellow_block_1 is clear. Yellow_block_1 is clear in the initial state. But after any steps, does anything change that? Let's see. The steps so far are unstack, putdown, pickup. So yellow_block_1 remains on blue_block_1 and clear. So stacking purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1 is possible. Then, after stacking, purple_block_1 is on yellow, and the arm is empty. That achieves the goal.

So the plan would be:

unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1

putdown purple_block_2

pickup purple_block_1

stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1

But wait, let's check the constraints. The constraints say that in at least one state of the plan, either blue_block_1 is not on the table, or blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1.

In the current plan, blue_block_1 is still on the table throughout. And blue_block_2 is on the table the entire time. So the constraint is not satisfied. Therefore, the plan as is would be invalid because it doesn't meet the constraints. So we need to make sure that at some point in the plan, either blue_block_1 is moved (so it's not on the table) or blue_block_2 is stacked on orange_block_1.

So how can we incorporate this into the plan? Let's see. The constraint must be true in at least one state. So the plan must include an action that causes either blue_block_1 to be moved (e.g., unstack yellow_block_1 from it) or stack blue_block_2 onto orange_block_1.

But in the current plan, the only actions are unstacking purple_block_2, putting it down, picking up purple_block_1, and stacking it on yellow. None of these actions affect blue_block_1 or blue_block_2. Therefore, the constraint is not met.

So we need to modify the plan to include an action that satisfies the constraint. Let's see. Let's think of possible ways.

Option 1: Move blue_block_1. Since blue_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on top. To move blue_block_1, we would first need to unstack yellow_block_1. But wait, blue_block_1 is on the table, and yellow is on top of it. To pick up blue_block_1, it must be clear and on the table. But blue_block_1 has yellow on top. So we can't pick it up. Therefore, the only way to move blue_block_1 is to first remove yellow_block_1. Which would involve unstacking yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1, putting it down, then pickup blue_block_1. But this complicates the plan.

Alternatively, Option 2: Stack blue_block_2 onto orange_block_1. Orange_block_1 is on green_block_1 and is clear. So to stack blue_block_2 on orange, we need to pick up blue_block_2 (which is on the table and clear), then stack it on orange_block_1 (which is clear). So that would require:

pickup blue_block_2

stack blue_block_2 orange_block_1

But doing this would satisfy the constraint because blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1. So even if we later remove it, as long as it's done once in the plan, the constraint is met.

But how can we fit this into the existing plan? The problem is that the existing plan's goal is to get purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1. So maybe we can insert the stacking of blue_block_2 onto orange_block_1 somewhere in the plan, then perhaps unstack it again if needed.

But we need to make sure that the final state meets the goal. So the goal is only about purple_block_1 and yellow_block_1; other blocks can be in any state as long as the constraints are met.

Wait, the constraints are about the plan's intermediate states, not the final state. So the plan must have at least one state where either blue_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1.

So perhaps, during the plan, we can stack blue_block_2 on orange_block_1 and then unstack it again. But that might add unnecessary steps, but since we need an optimal plan (shortest possible), we need to see if we can do this in a way that doesn't increase the number of steps beyond necessary.

Alternatively, maybe we can combine moving purple_block_1 with stacking blue_block_2 in a way that satisfies the constraint.

Let me think. Let's first outline the original plan steps:

1. unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1

2. putdown purple_block_2

3. pickup purple_block_1

4. stack purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1

This is four actions, but doesn't meet the constraint. So to meet the constraint, perhaps during step 3 or 4, we can insert an action that satisfies the constraint.

Alternatively, perhaps after unstacking purple_block_2, instead of putting it down immediately, we could use it to satisfy the constraint. But how?

Wait, after unstacking purple_block_2, we're holding it. Then, maybe stack it on blue_block_1 or something else. But that's not part of the goal. Alternatively, we could stack it on orange_block_1, but that would require that orange_block_1 is clear. Which it is. So:

Alternative plan:

1. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1

2. stack purple_block_2 orange_block_1 â†’ Now, purple_block_2 is on orange_block_1, which is on green_block_1. Then, we need to get purple_block_1 and stack it on yellow_block_1.

But after stacking purple_block_2 on orange_block_1, the arm is empty. Then, we can pickup purple_block_1 (since it's now clear) and stack it on yellow_block_1.

But then, the constraint is satisfied because blue_block_2 is not on orange_block_1, but in this case, purple_block_2 is on orange. Hmm, the constraint requires that either blue_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_2 is on orange. So stacking purple_block_2 on orange_block_1 doesn't satisfy the constraint. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, after unstacking purple_block_2, maybe stack it on blue_block_2. Then, during that step, blue_block_2 is not on the table (it's under purple_block_2). Wait, no: stacking purple_block_2 onto blue_block_2 would make blue_block_2 have a block on top. But blue_block_2 is on the table. So after stacking, blue_block_2 is still on the table. So that's not changing the fact that blue_block_1 is on the table. So this doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps the only way to satisfy the constraint is to either move blue_block_1 (which requires moving yellow_block_1) or stack blue_block_2 on orange_block_1.

Let's think of the minimal way to do this. Let's say we stack blue_block_2 on orange_block_1. That requires:

pickup blue_block_2 (since it's on the table and clear)

stack blue_block_2 orange_block_1 (since orange is clear)

But after that, blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1, which would satisfy the constraint. So if we do this in the plan, then even if we later unstack it, the constraint is met as long as during the plan, that state exists.

So integrating this into the original plan:

Original plan steps are 4 actions. To add these two steps (pickup blue_block_2 and stack), that's two more actions, making it 6 steps. But maybe there's a way to do this without adding steps. Wait, but maybe the blue_block_2 can be moved in a way that helps with the main goal.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use blue_block_2 as part of the process. Let's think.

But the main goal requires purple_block_1 to be on yellow_block_1. The purple_block_1 is under purple_block_2. So the original steps are necessary. So maybe we have to add the steps for the constraint.

But how to do it with minimal steps.

Alternatively, maybe after stacking purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1, we can do something with blue_block_2. But the goal only requires that purple_block_1 is on yellow, so other blocks can be anywhere. But in the initial plan, after stacking, the plan is done. So adding steps after that would not be optimal.

Alternatively, maybe during the process of achieving the goal, we can satisfy the constraint.

Wait, if we can stack blue_block_2 on orange_block_1 before moving purple_block_1, then the constraint is satisfied. Let's see:

Plan:

1. pickup blue_block_2 (it's on table and clear)

2. stack blue_block_2 orange_block_1 (orange is clear)

Now, the constraint is satisfied here.

3. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1

4. putdown purple_block_2

5. pickup purple_block_1

6. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1

That's six steps. But the original plan was four steps. But is there a way to combine these actions to make it shorter?

Alternatively, maybe after stacking blue_block_2 on orange_block_1, we can use that block to hold purple_block_2, but that's not necessary. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps after stacking blue_block_2 on orange, we can unstack it later. But that's adding more steps.

Alternatively, let's think of whether there's a way to achieve the constraint without adding steps. For example, during the process of moving purple_block_1, maybe we can use blue_block_2 in a way that satisfies the constraint.

Wait, after unstacking purple_block_2 from purple_block_1, we could stack it onto blue_block_1. But blue_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on top. So to stack on blue_block_1, we need to unstack yellow_block_1 first. Which complicates the plan.

Alternatively, after unstacking purple_block_2, can we stack it on blue_block_2? Then, blue_block_2 is under purple_block_2, but blue_block_2 is still on the table. So that doesn't change the fact that blue_block_1 is on the table. So that doesn't satisfy the constraint.

Alternatively, if during the plan, we move blue_block_1. But blue_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on it. To move blue_block_1, we need to first unstack yellow_block_1. Let's think:

Suppose after the initial steps of moving purple_block_2 and purple_block_1, we have to handle blue_block_1.

But this seems to complicate things. The minimal plan would require adding steps to handle the constraint.

Alternatively, maybe the constraint can be satisfied during the original plan's steps. Let's look at the original plan's states.

Original plan:

1. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1 â†’ Arm is holding purple_block_2. purple_block_1 is clear.

State after step 1: Holding purple_block_2; purple_block_1 clear. Other blocks as initial except purple_block_2 is not on purple_block_1.

In this state, blue_block_1 is still on the table with yellow on top. blue_block_2 is on table. So constraint not met.

2. putdown purple_block_2 â†’ purple_block_2 is on table, clear. Arm empty.

State after step 2: purple_block_2 on table. Still, blue_block_1 is on table; blue_block_2 on table. Constraint not met.

3. pickup purple_block_1 â†’ Arm holds purple_block_1.

State: blue_block_1 still on table; blue_block_2 on table. Constraint not met.

4. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1 â†’ purple_block_1 is on yellow, which is on blue_block_1. Arm empty.

Final state: constraint not met.

So in none of these steps is the constraint satisfied. Therefore, the original plan is invalid due to the constraint.

So we need to find a way to meet the constraint. Let's think of inserting steps that satisfy the constraint.

The minimal way is to do an action that either moves blue_block_1 or stacks blue_block_2 on orange.

Stacking blue_block_2 on orange requires two actions: pickup and stack. So adding two steps. But can we combine this with the existing plan?

Suppose we first stack blue_block_2 on orange_block_1, then proceed with the original plan.

So the steps would be:

1. pickup blue_block_2

2. stack blue_block_2 orange_block_1

3. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1

4. putdown purple_block_2

5. pickup purple_block_1

6. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1

This plan has six steps. But is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, perhaps after stacking blue_block_2 on orange, we can use that block to hold purple_block_2 instead of putting it on the table. Let's see.

After step 2, blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1. Then step 3: unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1. Arm has purple_block_2. Then step 4: stack purple_block_2 on blue_block_2 (which is on orange). But blue_block_2 is clear? After step 2, blue_block_2 is on orange, so it's under blue_block_2. Wait, no. Stacking blue_block_2 on orange_block_1 makes blue_block_2 on top of orange_block_1. So blue_block_2 is clear. Then, step 3: unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1. Then step 4: stack purple_block_2 on blue_block_2 (since blue_block_2 is clear). That way, we don't have to putdown purple_block_2. Then step 5: pickup purple_block_1 and stack on yellow.

So steps would be:

1. pickup blue_block_2

2. stack blue_block_2 orange_block_1

3. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1

4. stack purple_block_2 blue_block_2

5. pickup purple_block_1

6. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1

This is six steps. But the original plan required four steps. So this adds two steps. But is there a way to do it with fewer?

Alternatively, can we stack purple_block_2 on blue_block_2 during the initial unstacking, but that would require blue_block_2 to be clear. Which it is, initially. So:

Original plan with modification:

1. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1

2. stack purple_block_2 blue_block_2 â†’ instead of putdown

Then:

3. pickup purple_block_1

4. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1

But does this satisfy the constraint?

After step 2, blue_block_2 has purple_block_2 on top, so blue_block_2 is not clear. But the constraint requires either blue_block_1 not on table or blue_block_2 on orange. So stacking purple_block_2 on blue_block_2 doesn't help. So the constraint isn't met in this plan.

Alternatively, after step 2, stack purple_block_2 on orange_block_1. But to do that, we need to have orange_block_1 clear. Initially, orange_block_1 is clear. So:

1. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1

2. stack purple_block_2 orange_block_1 â†’ arm is empty

Then:

3. pickup purple_block_1

4. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1

But this is four steps. Now, during step 2, purple_block_2 is stacked on orange_block_1, but the constraint requires blue_block_2 to be on orange_block_1. So this doesn't satisfy the constraint. So this approach doesn't work.

Wait, the constraint requires that "blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1" in at least one state. So unless blue_block_2 is stacked on orange, that part of the constraint isn't met. So perhaps we need to stack blue_block_2 on orange.

So back to the six-step plan:

1. pickup blue_block_2

2. stack blue_block_2 orange_block_1 â†’ satisfies constraint

3. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1

4. putdown purple_block_2

5. pickup purple_block_1

6. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1

This plan has six steps. But is there a shorter way?

Wait, after stacking blue_block_2 on orange (steps 1 and 2), perhaps we can then unstack it later. But that would add more steps. Alternatively, after stacking blue_block_2 on orange, can we use that block to hold purple_block_2?

But let's see: after step 2, blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1, and is clear. Then, unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1 (step 3), then stack purple_block_2 on blue_block_2 (step 4), which is on orange. Then, pickup purple_block_1 (step 5) and stack (step 6). So that's six steps again.

But this way, we don't need to putdown purple_block_2, so steps are:

1. pickup blue_block_2

2. stack blue_block_2 orange_block_1

3. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1

4. stack purple_block_2 blue_block_2

5. pickup purple_block_1

6. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1

But this is still six steps. Is there a way to reduce this?

Alternatively, can we stack purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1 first, but that's not possible because purple_block_1 is under purple_block_2.

Alternatively, if after stacking blue_block_2 on orange, we unstack it again. But that would require more steps.

Hmm. It seems that satisfying the constraint adds two steps. So the minimal plan would be six steps.

But wait, maybe there's a way to achieve the constraint with only one additional step. Let's think: Suppose after unstacking purple_block_2 and putting it down, we then pickup blue_block_2 and stack it on orange, then proceed. But that would be inserting two steps (pickup and stack) after step 2 of the original plan. So steps would be:

1. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1

2. putdown purple_block_2

3. pickup blue_block_2

4. stack blue_block_2 orange_block_1

5. pickup purple_block_1

6. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1

This is six steps again. Same as before.

Alternatively, if we can use the block we're holding after unstacking purple_block_2 (which is purple_block_2) to stack onto blue_block_1, but blue_block_1 has yellow on it. So can't stack there. Or stack onto blue_block_2? That wouldn't help the constraint.

Wait, if during step 2, instead of putting down purple_block_2, we stack it on blue_block_1. But blue_block_1 has yellow on top. So we can't stack purple_block_2 on blue_block_1 because yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1 and is clear. So to stack on blue_block_1, we need to first unstack yellow_block_1. Which complicates things further.

Hmm. Maybe the minimal plan is six steps. Let's check if there's a shorter way.

Wait, what if we unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1, then put it down, then stack blue_block_1 somewhere else? That would make blue_block_1 not on the table, satisfying the constraint. Let's see:

Original goal is to have purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1. If we move yellow_block_1, then we need to adjust.

But the goal is purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1, regardless of where yellow is. So yellow could be on the table or on another block. So if we unstack yellow from blue_block_1 and put it down, then blue_block_1 is clear. Then, we can stack purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1 on the table. But that would meet the goal.

But this approach would require:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1

2. putdown yellow_block_1

3. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1

4. putdown purple_block_2

5. pickup purple_block_1

6. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1

But this is six steps. Also, during step 1, we unstack yellow, which makes blue_block_1 clear. Then, after step 2, blue_block_1 is on the table and clear. But in this case, during step 1, blue_block_1 is not on the table? No, blue_block_1 remains on the table. Unstacking yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1 only removes yellow from on top of blue_block_1. So blue_block_1 is still on the table. So the constraint is not met. So this doesn't help.

Alternatively, after unstacking yellow_block_1, we could stack blue_block_1 somewhere else. But blue_block_1 is on the table, so to pick it up, it must be clear. After unstacking yellow_block_1, blue_block_1 is clear. So:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1

2. putdown yellow_block_1

3. pickup blue_block_1

4. stack blue_block_1 ... where? Maybe on the table again, but that's useless. Or on another block. If we stack it on another block, then blue_block_1 is not on the table. But that would require a clear target. For example, stack blue_block_1 on green_block_1. But green_block_1 has orange_block_1 on top. So to stack blue_block_1 on green_block_1, we need to unstack orange_block_1 first. Which adds more steps.

This seems to be getting too complicated and adding more steps. So perhaps this approach isn't better.

So returning to the original idea, the only way to satisfy the constraint is to stack blue_block_2 on orange_block_1, which requires two steps. Thus, the minimal plan would be six steps.

But wait, what if we can do something else. Let's think of the constraint again: "At least one of the following conditions is true: blue_block_1 is not on the table, blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1". So if we can make blue_block_1 not on the table even temporarily.

But blue_block_1 is on the table, with yellow_block_1 on top. To make blue_block_1 not on the table, we need to pick it up. To pick it up, it must be clear. But yellow is on top. So we need to first unstack yellow. So:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1

2. putdown yellow_block_1

3. pickup blue_block_1

4. putdown blue_block_1 (somewhere else)

But even if we do that, blue_block_1 is now on the table again. So that doesn't help. Alternatively, stack blue_block_1 on another block. For example:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1 â†’ arm holds yellow

2. putdown yellow_block_1

3. pickup blue_block_1 â†’ now, blue_block_1 is held.

4. stack blue_block_1 green_block_1 â†’ but green has orange on top. So to stack on green, green must be clear. But orange is on green. So we can't stack here.

Alternatively, stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_1. Orange is clear. So:

4. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1 â†’ now, blue_block_1 is on orange, which is on green. So blue_block_1 is not on the table, satisfying the constraint.

So the steps would be:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1

2. putdown yellow_block_1

3. pickup blue_block_1

4. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1

5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1

6. putdown purple_block_2

7. pickup purple_block_1

8. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1

This is eight steps. But this is longer than the previous six-step plan. So this is not optimal.

Therefore, the best approach seems to be the six-step plan where we stack blue_block_2 on orange_block_1 to satisfy the constraint.

But let's check whether this plan is valid and satisfies the constraints.

Plan steps:

1. pickup blue_block_2

Preconditions: blue_block_2 is on table, clear, and arm is empty. Which is true.

2. stack blue_block_2 orange_block_1

Preconditions: holding blue_block_2 and orange_block_1 is clear. Orange_block_1 is clear initially. So this is possible. After stacking, blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1. So the constraint is met here.

3. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1

Preconditions: purple_block_2 is on purple_block_1, clear, and arm is empty. After step 2, arm is empty. purple_block_2 is still on purple_block_1, and clear? No, wait. Initially, purple_block_2 is on purple_block_1. After step 1 and 2, we moved blue_block_2 but not purple_block_2. So in step 3, unstacking purple_block_2 from purple_block_1 is still possible, as their state hasn't changed.

Yes, because the first two steps involve blue_block_2 and orange_block_1, not affecting the purple blocks. So step 3 is valid.

4. putdown purple_block_2

Arm is holding purple_block_2 after unstacking. Putdown is possible.

5. pickup purple_block_1

Now, purple_block_1 is on table and clear.

6. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1

Yellow_block_1 is on blue_block_1 (still on table), and is clear. So stacking is possible.

Final state: purple_block_1 is on yellow_block_1. Goal achieved.

The constraint is satisfied in step 2, where blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1. So this plan is valid.

But is there a shorter plan? Let's see.

What if we can do the constraint and the main goal in fewer steps. For example, can we use blue_block_2 in a way that satisfies the constraint without adding two steps?

Alternatively, maybe stack blue_block_2 on orange_block_1 after moving purple_block_2. Let's see:

Plan:

1. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1

2. stack purple_block_2 blue_block_2 â†’ instead of putting it down.

But blue_block_2 is on the table and clear. So stacking purple_block_2 on blue_block_2 is possible. Then, pickup purple_block_1 and stack it on yellow.

But this plan would be:

1. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1

2. stack purple_block_2 blue_block_2

3. pickup purple_block_1

4. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1

But does this satisfy the constraint? The constraint requires that either blue_block_1 is not on the table (which it still is) or blue_block_2 is on orange_block_1 (which it's not; it's under purple_block_2). So this doesn't satisfy the constraint. Thus, invalid.

Alternatively, after stacking purple_block_2 on blue_block_2, can we then move blue_block_2 onto orange_block_1?

But that would require:

1. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1

2. stack purple_block_2 blue_block_2

3. pickup blue_block_2 (but it's under purple_block_2, which is on top. So can't pickup blue_block_2. So this is impossible.

So that approach won't work.

Another idea: After unstacking purple_block_2, instead of putting it down, use it to stack on orange_block_1. Then, blue_block_2 is not involved. But stacking purple_block_2 on orange_block_1 would not satisfy the constraint, which requires blue_block_2 to be on orange.

So this is not helpful.

Therefore, the six-step plan seems to be the minimal valid plan that satisfies the constraint.

But wait, let's check again: the six-step plan is:

1. pickup blue_block_2

2. stack blue_block_2 orange_block_1 â†’ constraint met here

3. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1

4. putdown purple_block_2

5. pickup purple_block_1

6. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1

Yes, this satisfies the constraint. Now, is this plan optimal? Are there any shorter plans?

Wait, perhaps there's a way to stack blue_block_2 on orange_block_1 while in the process of moving purple_block_2. Let me think.

Suppose after unstacking purple_block_2, we stack it on blue_block_2. Then, blue_block_2 is on the table but has purple_block_2 on top. But this doesn't satisfy the constraint.

Alternatively, after unstacking purple_block_2, we stack it on blue_block_1. But blue_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on top. So we can't stack there.

Alternatively, after unstacking purple_block_2, we can stack it on orange_block_1. That way, we have purple_block_2 on orange_block_1. But the constraint requires blue_block_2 on orange. So that's not helpful.

So no, that doesn't help.

Therefore, the six-step plan is the minimal one that meets all requirements.
