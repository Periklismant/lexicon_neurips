Okay, let's see. I need to find a plan to get purple_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1. The initial state has some blocks arranged in certain ways. Let me first visualize the initial setup.

From the initial state:

- green_block_1 is on the table, with orange_block_1 on top (and orange is clear).
- blue_block_1 is on the table, with yellow_block_1 on top (yellow is clear).
- purple_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_2 on top (purple_block_2 is clear).
- blue_block_2 is alone on the table, clear.
  
So, the goal is to have purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1. Currently, yellow_block_1 is on blue_block_1. So, I need to move purple_block_1 from the table to yellow_block_1. But first, purple_block_1 has purple_block_2 on it. So, to move purple_block_1, I need to first remove purple_block_2.

Wait, wait. Wait, in the initial state, purple_block_1 is on the table, and purple_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1. So purple_block_1 is under purple_block_2. So to access purple_block_1, I need to unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1, right?

So the steps might be:

1. Unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1. That requires that purple_block_2 is clear (which it is, according to the initial state). So perform unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1. Then, the robotic arm is holding purple_block_2, and purple_block_1 becomes clear.

2. Then, put down purple_block_2 somewhere. Maybe on the table. So putdown purple_block_2. Now, purple_block_1 is clear and on the table. Then, I can pick up purple_block_1, but wait, to pick up a block from the table, it needs to be clear. After putting down purple_block_2, purple_block_1 is clear. So yes.

3. Pick up purple_block_1. Then, stack it onto yellow_block_1. But yellow_block_1 is currently under purple_block_1? Wait, no. Wait, yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1. So yellow_block_1 is clear. So to stack purple_block_1 on yellow_block_1, the preconditions are that the robotic arm is holding purple_block_1, and yellow_block_1 is clear. Which it is. So after stacking, purple_block_1 is on yellow_block_1, which is the goal.

But wait, let me check the steps again.

Wait, after unstacking purple_block_2 from purple_block_1, the arm is holding purple_block_2. Then, I need to put it down. So:

Action 1: unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
Now, holding purple_block_2. Then:

Action 2: putdown purple_block_2
Now, purple_block_2 is on the table, clear. Purple_block_1 is on the table, clear.

Then, pickup purple_block_1. But wait, the initial state says purple_block_1 is on the table, but in the initial state, purple_block_1 has purple_block_2 on top. Wait, no: the initial state says "purple_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1". So purple_block_1 is on the table, with purple_block_2 on it. So after unstacking and putting down purple_block_2, purple_block_1 is on the table, clear. So yes, we can pick it up.

Action 3: pickup purple_block_1
Now, holding purple_block_1.

Then, stack it onto yellow_block_1. Since yellow_block_1 is clear (as per initial state, and since no action has affected it yet), we can stack.

Action 4: stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1

This should achieve the goal. So the plan would be those four actions. Let me check for any possible issues.

Wait, but after stacking, the effect is that purple_block_1 is on yellow_block_1, and yellow_block_1 is no longer clear. The goal is only that purple_block_1 is on yellow_block_1, which is satisfied.

But wait, are there any blocks that need to be moved aside? Let's see. For example, when we pickup purple_block_1, is there any block on top of it? No, because we removed purple_block_2 first.

Another possible issue: after unstacking purple_block_2 and putting it down, when we pick up purple_block_1, is there any other block on the table that's on top of it? No. So the steps seem okay.

But let me check the preconditions for each action.

1. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1:

Preconditions: purple_block_2 is on purple_block_1, purple_block_2 is clear (yes, initial state says purple_block_2 is clear), and the arm is not holding anything (initial state says arm is empty). So this is valid.

2. putdown purple_block_2:

The arm is holding purple_block_2, so putdown is allowed.

3. pickup purple_block_1:

After putdown, the arm is empty. purple_block_1 is on the table, and clear (since we removed the block on top). So yes, pickup is allowed.

4. stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1:

Arm is holding purple_block_1. yellow_block_1 is clear (yes, in initial state, and no actions have moved anything on top of it). So stack is allowed.

Yes, this seems to work. The plan has 4 actions. Is there a shorter plan?

Wait, maybe there's a way to not putdown purple_block_2 but use it differently. But the goal only requires moving purple_block_1. So perhaps the 4 steps are the minimum. Let me think: the steps needed are to remove the block on top (purple_block_2), move purple_block_1. So that's two moves for purple_block_2 (unstack and putdown), and two moves for purple_block_1 (pickup and stack). That's four steps. I don't see a way to do it in fewer steps. Because you have to unstack, putdown, pickup, stack. So four actions. So that's optimal.
