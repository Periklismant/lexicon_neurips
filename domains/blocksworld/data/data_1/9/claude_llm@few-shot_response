I'll solve this planning problem step by step.

First, let me analyze the initial state and goal:

Initial state:
- green_block_1 is on the table with orange_block_1 on top of it
- blue_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top of it
- purple_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_2 on top of it
- blue_block_2 is on the table
- orange_block_1, purple_block_2, yellow_block_1, and blue_block_2 are clear
- The arm is empty

Goal:
- purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1

Constraint:
- At some point, either blue_block_1 is not on the table OR blue_block_2 is on top of orange_block_1

To achieve the goal, I need to:
1. Move purple_block_2 from purple_block_1
2. Move purple_block_1 onto yellow_block_1

To satisfy the constraint, I'll either:
- Pick up blue_block_1 at some point, or
- Stack blue_block_2 on orange_block_1

Let me create a plan:

```
unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
putdown purple_block_2
unstack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1
putdown yellow_block_1
pickup blue_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
pickup purple_block_1
stack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
```

This plan satisfies the constraint because at one point blue_block_1 is not on the table (when I pick it up). The plan achieves the goal by placing purple_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1.
