To solve this planning problem, we need to achieve the goal of having "brown_block_2 on the table" while ensuring that at some point in the plan, "green_block_2 is on top of green_block_3". 

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **Tower 1**: green_block_1 (table) -> brown_block_1 -> grey_block_1 (clear)
2. **Tower 2**: green_block_2 (table) -> white_block_1 -> brown_block_2 -> green_block_3 (clear)
3. The arm is empty.

### Goal:
- brown_block_2 must be on the table.

### Constraints:
- At some point, green_block_2 must be on top of green_block_3.

### Approach:
1. To get brown_block_2 on the table, we need to unstack it from white_block_1. However, green_block_3 is on top of brown_block_2, so we must first unstack green_block_3 from brown_block_2.
2. After unstacking green_block_3, we can unstack brown_block_2 and put it on the table.
3. To satisfy the constraint, we need to stack green_block_2 on top of green_block_3 at some point. This can be done after green_block_3 is on the table (after unstacking it from brown_block_2).

### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. **unstack green_block_3 brown_block_2**: This is necessary to clear brown_block_2 so it can be unstacked.
   - Preconditions: green_block_3 is clear, on brown_block_2; arm is empty.
   - Effects: arm holds green_block_3; brown_block_2 is clear.
2. **putdown green_block_3**: Place green_block_3 on the table to free the arm.
   - Preconditions: arm holds green_block_3.
   - Effects: green_block_3 is on the table; arm is empty.
3. **unstack brown_block_2 white_block_1**: Now brown_block_2 is clear and can be unstacked.
   - Preconditions: brown_block_2 is clear, on white_block_1; arm is empty.
   - Effects: arm holds brown_block_2; white_block_1 is clear.
4. **putdown brown_block_2**: Place brown_block_2 on the table to achieve the goal.
   - Preconditions: arm holds brown_block_2.
   - Effects: brown_block_2 is on the table; arm is empty.
5. **pickup green_block_2**: To satisfy the constraint, we need to stack green_block_2 on green_block_3. First, pick up green_block_2.
   - Preconditions: green_block_2 is on the table, clear; arm is empty.
   - Effects: arm holds green_block_2; green_block_2 is not on the table.
6. **stack green_block_2 green_block_3**: Stack green_block_2 on green_block_3 to satisfy the constraint.
   - Preconditions: arm holds green_block_2; green_block_3 is clear.
   - Effects: green_block_2 is on green_block_3; arm is empty.

### Final Plan:
```
```
unstack green_block_3 brown_block_2
putdown green_block_3
unstack brown_block_2 white_block_1
putdown brown_block_2
pickup green_block_2
stack green_block_2 green_block_3
```
