Okay, let's break this down. We need to get brown_block_2 on the table, and at some point, green_block_2 must be on top of green_block_3. Here's the plan:

1.  **Clear the tower containing brown_block_2:** This means moving green_block_3, brown_block_2, and white_block_1.
2.  **Put brown_block_2 on the table.**
3.  **Create the stack with green_block_2 on top of green_block_3.**

Here's the plan:

```
```
unstack green_block_3 brown_block_2
putdown green_block_3
unstack brown_block_2 white_block_1
putdown brown_block_2
unstack white_block_1 green_block_2
putdown white_block_1
pickup green_block_2
stack green_block_2 green_block_3
```
