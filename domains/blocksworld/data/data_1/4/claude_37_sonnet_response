Alright, so I'm given a blocksworld problem. Let me first understand the initial state, the goal state, and the constraint.

Initial state:
- green_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
- green_block_2 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on top of green_block_2
- brown_block_2 is on top of white_block_1
- green_block_3 is on top of brown_block_2
- grey_block_1 is clear
- green_block_3 is clear
- Hand is empty

The initial state can be visualized as:
```
    grey_block_1       green_block_3
    brown_block_1      brown_block_2
    green_block_1      white_block_1
        table          green_block_2
                           table
```

Goal state:
- brown_block_2 is on the table

Constraint:
- At some point in the plan, green_block_2 must be on top of green_block_3

Let me think about how to achieve the goal while satisfying the constraint. 

The goal is to have brown_block_2 on the table. Currently, brown_block_2 is part of the right stack, with green_block_3 on top of it. 

To get brown_block_2 on the table, I'll need to remove green_block_3 from the top of brown_block_2 and then move brown_block_2 to the table. But I also need to satisfy the constraint, which means at some point, green_block_2 (which is currently at the bottom of the right stack) must be on top of green_block_3.

To satisfy the constraint, I'll need to rearrange the blocks such that green_block_2 is placed on top of green_block_3. Let's figure out a way to do this.

First, I'll need to clear green_block_2. This means I need to remove white_block_1, brown_block_2, and green_block_3 from the stack. I'll put them all on the table for simplicity. Then, I'll need to place green_block_3 on the table, and then place green_block_2 on top of green_block_3.

Here's a plan:

1. Unstack green_block_3 from brown_block_2. Now I'm holding green_block_3.
2. Put down green_block_3 on the table. Now brown_block_2 is clear.
3. Unstack brown_block_2 from white_block_1. Now I'm holding brown_block_2.
4. Put down brown_block_2 on the table. Now white_block_1 is clear.
5. Unstack white_block_1 from green_block_2. Now I'm holding white_block_1.
6. Put down white_block_1 on the table. Now green_block_2 is clear.
7. Pickup green_block_2 from the table. Now I'm holding green_block_2.
8. Stack green_block_2 on top of green_block_3. This satisfies the constraint.
9. Unstack green_block_2 from green_block_3. Now I'm holding green_block_2.
10. Put down green_block_2 on the table.

At this point, brown_block_2 is already on the table, so the goal is met and the constraint is satisfied (green_block_2 was on top of green_block_3 after step 8).

But something feels odd here. Let's double-check to ensure we're not missing anything.

Actually, wait. I just realized that the constraint only needs to hold in one of the states. It doesn't have to be the final state. 

Actually, let me directly verify that my plan works:

Initial state:
```
    grey_block_1       green_block_3
    brown_block_1      brown_block_2
    green_block_1      white_block_1
        table          green_block_2
                           table
```

1. Unstack green_block_3 from brown_block_2. Now I'm holding green_block_3.
```
    grey_block_1       
    brown_block_1      brown_block_2
    green_block_1      white_block_1
        table          green_block_2
                           table
                       
                       Holding: green_block_3
```

2. Put down green_block_3 on the table. Now brown_block_2 is clear.
```
    grey_block_1       
    brown_block_1      brown_block_2
    green_block_1      white_block_1
        table          green_block_2       green_block_3
                           table              table
                       
                       Holding: nothing
```

3. Unstack brown_block_2 from white_block_1. Now I'm holding brown_block_2.
```
    grey_block_1       
    brown_block_1      
    green_block_1      white_block_1
        table          green_block_2       green_block_3
                           table              table
                       
                       Holding: brown_block_2
```

4. Put down brown_block_2 on the table. Now white_block_1 is clear.
```
    grey_block_1       
    brown_block_1      
    green_block_1      white_block_1                         brown_block_2
        table          green_block_2       green_block_3        table
                           table              table
                       
                       Holding: nothing
```

5. Unstack white_block_1 from green_block_2. Now I'm holding white_block_1.
```
    grey_block_1       
    brown_block_1      
    green_block_1                                             brown_block_2
        table          green_block_2       green_block_3        table
                           table              table
                       
                       Holding: white_block_1
```

6. Put down white_block_1 on the table. Now green_block_2 is clear.
```
    grey_block_1       
    brown_block_1      
    green_block_1                                             brown_block_2     white_block_1
        table          green_block_2       green_block_3        table             table
                           table              table
                       
                       Holding: nothing
```

7. Pickup green_block_2 from the table. Now I'm holding green_block_2.
```
    grey_block_1       
    brown_block_1      
    green_block_1                                             brown_block_2     white_block_1
        table                             green_block_3        table             table
                                             table
                       
                       Holding: green_block_2
```

8. Stack green_block_2 on top of green_block_3. This satisfies the constraint.
```
    grey_block_1       
    brown_block_1      
    green_block_1                           green_block_2     brown_block_2     white_block_1
        table                              green_block_3        table             table
                                             table
                       
                       Holding: nothing
```

Now, brown_block_2 is on the table, and at one point in the plan (specifically, after step 8), green_block_2 is on top of green_block_3. The goal state and the constraint are both satisfied.

Actually, we're done at this step. We've achieved the goal (brown_block_2 is on the table) and satisfied the constraint (green_block_2 is on top of green_block_3). There's no need for steps 9 and 10.

Let me restate the final plan:

1. Unstack green_block_3 from brown_block_2
2. Put down green_block_3 on the table
3. Unstack brown_block_2 from white_block_1
4. Put down brown_block_2 on the table
5. Unstack white_block_1 from green_block_2
6. Put down white_block_1 on the table
7. Pickup green_block_2 from the table
8. Stack green_block_2 on top of green_block_3

But I need to make sure this is the optimal (shortest) valid plan. Let me see if we can find a shorter plan.

We need to get brown_block_2 on the table and at some point, green_block_2 must be on top of green_block_3.

brown_block_2 is initially under green_block_3. So we need to unstack green_block_3, then unstack brown_block_2 and put it on the table. Then, to satisfy the constraint, we need to place green_block_2 on top of green_block_3. green_block_2 is at the bottom of the stack, so we need to unstack blocks on top of it, pick it up, and then stack it on green_block_3.

So, the steps to achieve both the goal and constraint seem to be at minimum:
1. Unstack green_block_3 from brown_block_2
2. Putdown green_block_3 on the table
3. Unstack brown_block_2 from white_block_1
4. Putdown brown_block_2 on the table
5. Unstack white_block_1 from green_block_2
6. Putdown white_block_1 on the table
7. Pickup green_block_2 from the table
8. Stack green_block_2 on top of green_block_3

That's 8 steps, and I don't think we can reduce it further, so our plan with 8 steps seems optimal.

Let's finalize the plan:

1. unstack green_block_3 brown_block_2
2. putdown green_block_3
3. unstack brown_block_2 white_block_1
4. putdown brown_block_2
5. unstack white_block_1 green_block_2
6. putdown white_block_1
7. pickup green_block_2
8. stack green_block_2 green_block_3
