I'll solve this planning problem step by step.

First, let me analyze the initial state:
- We have 3 towers: (green_block_1, brown_block_1, grey_block_1), (green_block_2, white_block_1, brown_block_2, green_block_3), and no blocks being held.
- The goal is to have brown_block_2 on the table.
- We also have a constraint that at some point green_block_2 must be on top of green_block_3.

Currently, brown_block_2 is in the middle of the second tower with green_block_3 on top of it. To get brown_block_2 to the table, we need to first remove green_block_3. Then, to satisfy the constraint, we need to place green_block_2 on top of green_block_3 at some point.

Here's my plan:

```
unstack green_block_3 brown_block_2
putdown green_block_3
unstack brown_block_2 white_block_1
putdown brown_block_2
unstack white_block_1 green_block_2
putdown white_block_1
pickup green_block_2
stack green_block_2 green_block_3
```

This plan:
1. Removes green_block_3 from the top of brown_block_2
2. Puts green_block_3 on the table
3. Removes brown_block_2 from white_block_1
4. Puts brown_block_2 on the table (achieving our goal)
5. Removes white_block_1 from green_block_2
6. Puts white_block_1 on the table
7. Picks up green_block_2 from the table
8. Stacks green_block_2 on green_block_3 (satisfying our constraint)

The goal of having brown_block_2 on the table is achieved, and the constraint of having green_block_2 on top of green_block_3 at some point is also satisfied.
