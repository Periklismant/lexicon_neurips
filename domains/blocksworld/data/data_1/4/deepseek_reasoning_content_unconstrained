Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to get brown_block_2 onto the table. Let me start by understanding the initial state.

So, looking at the initial setup:

- green_block_1 is on the table, with brown_block_1 on top, and then grey_block_1 on top of that. So there's a tower of three blocks here: green_block_1, brown_block_1, grey_block_1. Grey_block_1 is clear.

Then there's another tower starting with green_block_2 on the table. On top of that is white_block_1, then brown_block_2, and finally green_block_3. The top block green_block_3 is clear.

The goal is to have brown_block_2 on the table. Right now, brown_block_2 is under green_block_3 and on top of white_block_1. So to get brown_block_2 onto the table, I need to move green_block_3 off of it first. But green_block_3 is clear, so I can pick it up if possible.

Wait, the actions are pickup, putdown, stack, unstack. Let's think about the steps.

First, brown_block_2 is currently under green_block_3. So to get brown_block_2, I need to unstack green_block_3 from brown_block_2. But to do that, green_block_3 must be clear, which it is. Also, the arm must be empty. So the first action would be unstack green_block_3 brown_block_2. That would make the arm hold green_block_3, and brown_block_2 becomes clear.

Then, I need to put green_block_3 somewhere. Since the goal doesn't specify where, maybe just put it on the table. So putdown green_block_3.

Now, brown_block_2 is clear. So I can pick it up. Wait, no, brown_block_2 is on top of white_block_1. So brown_block_2 is on white_block_1, which is on green_block_2. To get brown_block_2 to the table, I need to unstack it from white_block_1. Wait, but to unstack, the block (brown_block_2) must be on top of another block (white_block_1). So the action would be unstack brown_block_2 white_block_1. But wait, is brown_block_2 clear? After moving green_block_3, yes. So after putting down green_block_3, brown_block_2 is now the top of its stack. So then unstack brown_block_2 white_block_1. But wait, the arm is empty after putting down green_block_3. So yes, that's possible.

Wait, after unstacking green_block_3 from brown_block_2, the arm is holding green_block_3. Then putdown green_block_3. Now, the arm is empty again. Then, unstack brown_block_2 from white_block_1. But wait, brown_block_2 is on white_block_1. So unstack brown_block_2 white_block_1. The preconditions for unstack are: brown_block_2 is on white_block_1, brown_block_2 is clear (which it is now), and the arm is empty. So that's possible. After unstacking, the arm is holding brown_block_2. Then, to put it on the table, we can putdown brown_block_2. That would achieve the goal.

So the steps would be:

1. Unstack green_block_3 from brown_block_2. Then put it down.
2. Unstack brown_block_2 from white_block_1. Then put it down.

Wait, but after unstacking brown_block_2, we can directly put it on the table. So the steps:

- unstack green_block_3 brown_block_2
- putdown green_block_3
- unstack brown_block_2 white_block_1
- putdown brown_block_2

But wait, when we unstack green_block_3 from brown_block_2, after that, brown_block_2 becomes clear. Then we can unstack brown_block_2 from white_block_1. Then putdown. That seems right.

So the plan would be four actions. Let me check if each action's preconditions are met.

First action: unstack green_block_3 brown_block_2. Preconditions:

- green_block_3 is on brown_block_2 → yes.
- green_block_3 is clear → yes, as per initial state.
- arm is empty → yes, initial state.

After unstacking, arm holds green_block_3, and brown_block_2 is clear.

Second action: putdown green_block_3. Preconditions: holding green_block_3 → yes. After putdown, green_block_3 is on table, clear, and arm is empty.

Third action: unstack brown_block_2 white_block_1. Preconditions:

- brown_block_2 is on white_block_1 → yes.
- brown_block_2 is clear → yes, since after putting down green_block_3, no blocks are on brown_block_2.
- arm is empty → yes.

After unstacking, arm holds brown_block_2, and white_block_1 becomes clear.

Fourth action: putdown brown_block_2. Preconditions: holding brown_block_2 → yes. After putdown, brown_block_2 is on table, clear, arm empty.

That's the goal. So this plan should work. Are there any shorter plans?

Wait, maybe there's a way to not putdown green_block_3 but instead stack it somewhere else. But the goal doesn't care where the other blocks are. So the minimal steps would be the four steps above. I don't think you can do it in fewer steps. Let's check alternative approaches.

Alternative approach: After unstacking green_block_3, instead of putting it down, stack it on another block. But stacking requires that the target block is clear. For example, stack green_block_3 on grey_block_1. But is grey_block_1 clear? Initially, yes. So after unstacking green_block_3, if we stack it on grey_block_1, that's possible. Let's see:

1. unstack green_block_3 brown_block_2 → holding green_block_3
2. stack green_block_3 grey_block_1 → now green_block_3 is on grey_block_1. This would make grey_block_1 not clear anymore. Then, proceed to unstack brown_block_2.

But then, after stacking green_block_3 on grey_block_1, the steps would be:

1. unstack green_block_3 brown_block_2
2. stack green_block_3 grey_block_1
3. unstack brown_block_2 white_block_1
4. putdown brown_block_2 → that's four steps as well, same length. So whether we putdown or stack the green_block_3 doesn't change the number of steps.

But maybe stacking is better. Wait, in the first plan, after putting down green_block_3, it's on the table, clear. In the second plan, stacking on grey_block_1, which might affect other blocks, but since the goal only requires brown_block_2 on the table, either way is fine. So both plans are valid and same length.

But the optimal plan is the minimal steps. Both approaches have four steps. So either way is acceptable. But perhaps the first approach is simpler.

But the problem states that the plan should be optimal. So whichever plan has the minimal steps. Since both are four steps, either is okay. However, perhaps the first approach (putdown green_block_3) is more straightforward.

Wait, in the first approach, the steps are:

unstack green_block_3 brown_block_2

putdown green_block_3

unstack brown_block_2 white_block_1

putdown brown_block_2

Yes, that's four steps. The second approach:

unstack green_block_3 brown_block_2

stack green_block_3 grey_block_1

unstack brown_block_2 white_block_1

putdown brown_block_2

Also four steps. So same length.

But in the first approach, putting down green_block_3 requires two actions (unstack and putdown). The second approach uses stack, but requires the same number of steps. Either way, four steps. So both are optimal.

But maybe the problem expects the first approach. Let me check if there's any other possible shorter plan.

Alternatively, can we unstack brown_block_2 first? But in the initial state, brown_block_2 is under green_block_3. So to unstack brown_block_2, it must be clear. But initially, green_block_3 is on top of it. So you have to first remove green_block_3. So no way around that. So the first step must involve moving green_block_3.

Thus, the minimal plan is four steps. The two possible plans are both correct and optimal. So I'll present one of them.
