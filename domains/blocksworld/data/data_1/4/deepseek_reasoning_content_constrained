Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld problem. The goal is to get brown_block_2 onto the table. But there's a constraint that at some point, green_block_2 must be on top of green_block_3. Hmm, so I need to make sure that happens during the plan. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the goal.

In the initial state, there are two towers. The first tower has green_block_1 with brown_block_1 on it, then grey_block_1 on top. The second tower starts with green_block_2, then white_block_1, brown_block_2, and finally green_block_3. Both grey_block_1 and green_block_3 are clear. The robot isn't holding anything.

The goal is to have brown_block_2 on the table. So I need to move brown_block_2 from being on top of white_block_1 to the table. But brown_block_2 is currently under green_block_3. That means I need to unstack green_block_3 from brown_block_2 first. But before I can unstack green_block_3, I need to make sure that there's nothing on top of it. Since green_block_3 is clear, I can unstack it.

Wait, the action "unstack x y" requires that x is on top of y, x is clear, and the arm is empty. So first, unstack green_block_3 from brown_block_2. Then put it down. Then I can pick up brown_block_2 and put it on the table. But wait, brown_block_2 is under green_block_3 initially. So the steps would be:

1. Unstack green_block_3 from brown_block_2. Now, the arm is holding green_block_3, and brown_block_2 is clear.
2. Put down green_block_3 somewhere. Let's say on the table. But then, after that, I can pick up brown_block_2 and put it down. But putting it down directly would achieve the goal. However, the constraint requires that at some point green_block_2 is on top of green_block_3. So maybe after putting green_block_3 on the table, we need to stack green_block_2 onto green_block_3 at some point.

Wait, but how do I do that? Green_block_2 is part of the initial tower. The initial state of green_block_2 is on the table, with white_block_1 on it, then brown_block_2, then green_block_3. So to get green_block_2 on top of green_block_3, I need to move green_block_2 from the table to on top of green_block_3. But green_block_2 is currently under white_block_1. So first, I need to dismantle that tower to free up green_block_2.

So maybe the plan involves moving the upper blocks of the second tower (white_block_1, brown_block_2, green_block_3) to the table or elsewhere so that green_block_2 is clear. Then, pick up green_block_2 and stack it onto green_block_3. Let's think step by step.

The initial second tower: green_block_2 (on table), white_block_1 on green_block_2, brown_block_2 on white_block_1, green_block_3 on brown_block_2. So to get green_block_2 clear, we need to remove white_block_1. But white_block_1 is under brown_block_2. So first, we need to unstack green_block_3 from brown_block_2, then unstack brown_block_2 from white_block_1, then unstack white_block_1 from green_block_2. Then green_block_2 is clear and can be picked up.

But the goal is to have brown_block_2 on the table, so after moving green_block_3 and brown_block_2, perhaps we can put brown_block_2 down. But let's see.

But the constraint is that at some state, green_block_2 is on green_block_3. So maybe after moving green_block_3 to the table, we can stack green_block_2 onto it. But green_block_2 is on the table, so to stack it onto green_block_3, we need to pick up green_block_2, which requires that it's clear. So first, we need to remove everything on top of green_block_2. Which means moving white_block_1, brown_block_2, and green_block_3. Wait, but initially, green_block_3 is on brown_block_2. So the order might be:

Unstack green_block_3 from brown_block_2 → putdown green_block_3.

Then unstack brown_block_2 from white_block_1 → putdown brown_block_2. But wait, the goal is to have brown_block_2 on the table, so putting it down would achieve that. But then the plan would be done. However, the constraint requires that green_block_2 is on green_block_3 at some point. So perhaps after putting down green_block_3, we can stack green_block_2 onto it, but that would require moving white_block_1 first.

Wait, maybe the steps are:

1. Unstack green_block_3 from brown_block_2. Now holding green_block_3.

2. Putdown green_block_3 on table. Now green_block_3 is on table, clear.

3. Unstack brown_block_2 from white_block_1. Now holding brown_block_2. But to do this, brown_block_2 must be clear. After step 1, brown_block_2 is clear because green_block_3 was removed. So yes, can unstack brown_block_2 from white_block_1.

4. Putdown brown_block_2. Now the goal is achieved. But we haven't met the constraint yet. So we need to perform additional steps to have green_block_2 on green_block_3.

But how? Because after step 4, the brown_block_2 is on the table, but the white_block_1 is still on green_block_2. So to get green_block_2 clear, we need to move white_block_1. But since the goal is already achieved, maybe we can do that after putting down brown_block_2? But that would make the plan longer than necessary. Wait, the problem says the plan must be optimal, so the shortest possible. So we need to find a way to achieve the goal and the constraint with minimal steps.

Alternative approach: Perhaps during the process of moving brown_block_2 to the table, we can arrange for green_block_2 to be stacked on green_block_3. Let's think.

After step 1 (unstack green_block3 from brown_block2 and put it down), then unstack brown_block2 from white_block1, then stack brown_block2 somewhere else, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe after putting green_block3 on the table, we can stack green_block2 on top of green_block3. But green_block2 is under white_block1. So first, we need to unstack white_block1 from green_block2. To do that, we need to remove brown_block2 and green_block3 from above. Wait, the initial tower is green_block2 (table), white_block1 on green_block2, brown_block2 on white_block1, green_block3 on brown_block2. So to unstack white_block1 from green_block2, we need to first remove brown_block2 and green_block3. So steps:

1. Unstack green_block3 from brown_block2 → putdown.

2. Unstack brown_block2 from white_block1 → putdown. Now brown_block2 is on table (goal achieved), but we need to satisfy the constraint. So after step 2, maybe pick up green_block2 (but white_block1 is on it). Wait, no. After step 2, brown_block2 is on the table, but white_block1 is still on green_block2. So to pick up green_block2, which is on the table, it needs to be clear. But white_block1 is on it. So we need to unstack white_block1 from green_block2. To do that, since white_block1 is under brown_block2 (but brown_block2 was moved to table), wait, no. After step 2, brown_block2 is on the table, so white_block1 is now clear (since brown_block2 was on top of it). Wait, no: the initial setup after unstacking brown_block2 from white_block1 would leave white_block1 clear. Because when you unstack brown_block2 from white_block1, brown_block2 is no longer on white_block1. So white_block1 is now clear. So after step 2, white_block1 is on green_block2 and is clear. So step 3: unstack white_block1 from green_block2. Then putdown white_block1. Now green_block2 is clear.

4. Then pickup green_block2 and stack it on green_block3 (which is on the table from step 1). So stack green_block2 green_block3. Now, green_block2 is on green_block3, satisfying the constraint. Then, after that, do we need to do anything else? The goal is already achieved (brown_block2 is on table). But the constraint is that at some state, green_block2 is on green_block3. So adding these steps would satisfy the constraint. But does this plan achieve the goal?

Let me check:

After step 2, brown_block2 is on the table (goal met). Then steps 3-5 are moving white_block1 and stacking green_block2 on green_block3. So the total plan would be:

1. unstack green_block3 brown_block2

2. putdown green_block3

3. unstack brown_block2 white_block1

4. putdown brown_block2 (goal achieved here)

5. unstack white_block1 green_block2

6. putdown white_block1

7. pickup green_block2

8. stack green_block2 green_block3

But this plan is longer than necessary. However, the problem says the plan must be optimal, i.e., as short as possible. So maybe there's a shorter way to satisfy the constraint.

Wait, maybe after step 1 (unstack green_block3 from brown_block2 and put it down), then stack green_block2 onto green_block3. But green_block2 is under white_block1. So we need to first remove white_block1. To remove white_block1, we need to unstack brown_block2 from white_block1. But brown_block2 is under green_block3. Wait, no, after step 1, green_block3 is on the table, so brown_block2 is clear. So step 2: unstack brown_block2 from white_block1. Now holding brown_block2. Then putdown brown_block2 (step3). Now the goal is achieved. Then, to get green_block2 on green_block3, we need to unstack white_block1 from green_block2. Because after step3, white_block1 is on green_block2 and is clear (since brown_block2 was removed). So step4: unstack white_block1 from green_block2. Step5: putdown white_block1. Step6: pickup green_block2. Step7: stack green_block2 green_block3. So steps 1-7. But this plan is 7 actions. But maybe there's a way to combine steps.

Alternatively, during the process of moving brown_block2, can we stack green_block2 on green_block3 in between?

Wait, after step1: unstack green_block3 from brown_block2, putdown green_block3. Step2: unstack brown_block2 from white_block1. Now holding brown_block2. Instead of putting it down immediately, can we use it to stack somewhere else? But the goal requires it to be on the table. So we have to put it down. So step3: putdown brown_block2. Then we need to deal with white_block1 and green_block2.

Alternatively, after step2 (holding brown_block2), can we stack brown_block2 onto green_block3? Then brown_block2 is on green_block3. But the goal is for brown_block2 to be on the table, so that's not helpful. So no.

Wait, maybe after step1: unstack green_block3 from brown_block2. Then stack green_block3 onto green_block2. Wait, but green_block2 is under white_block1. So stacking green_block3 onto green_block2 would require that green_block2 is clear. But white_block1 is on it. So that's not possible. Alternatively, after unstacking green_block3, could we stack it on green_block2, but that's blocked by white_block1.

Hmm. Another approach: Perhaps the constraint can be satisfied before achieving the goal. For example, after moving green_block3 to the table, stack green_block2 on it. But to do that, we need to move white_block1, brown_block2, and green_block3 first.

Wait, let's try:

1. unstack green_block3 from brown_block2 → putdown green_block3.

2. unstack brown_block2 from white_block1 → putdown brown_block2 (goal achieved here).

3. unstack white_block1 from green_block2 → putdown white_block1.

4. pickup green_block2.

5. stack green_block2 green_block3.

This way, the constraint is satisfied in step5. But this adds steps 3-5 after achieving the goal, making the plan longer. But since the problem requires the plan to be optimal (shortest possible), this approach may not be optimal because there might be a way to combine steps.

Alternatively, maybe during the process of unstacking, we can stack green_block2 onto green_block3 before moving brown_block2. Let's see.

But how? Let's think again. The initial state:

Tower 1: green_block1 (table) → brown_block1 → grey_block1.

Tower 2: green_block2 (table) → white_block1 → brown_block2 → green_block3.

Goal: brown_block2 on table.

Constraint: green_block2 on green_block3 at some state.

So perhaps after moving green_block3 off brown_block2 and putting it on the table, we can then move white_block1 and brown_block2 off green_block2, allowing us to stack green_block2 on green_block3. But that's adding steps.

Wait, let's consider a different sequence. What if:

1. unstack green_block3 from brown_block2 → putdown green_block3.

2. unstack brown_block2 from white_block1 → stack brown_block2 green_block3.

Now, brown_block2 is on green_block3, but the goal requires it to be on the table. So that's not helpful. Also, stacking brown_block2 on green_block3 would make green_block3 not clear, which might complicate things.

Alternatively, after step1, instead of putting green_block3 on the table, stack it somewhere else where it's available for green_block2 to be stacked on top. But where?

Alternatively, after putting green_block3 on the table, can we then stack green_block2 on it? But green_block2 is under white_block1. So we need to first unstack white_block1 from green_block2, which requires unstacking brown_block2 from white_block1 first.

Wait, let's try:

1. unstack green_block3 from brown_block2 → putdown green_block3.

2. unstack brown_block2 from white_block1 → putdown brown_block2 (achieves goal).

3. unstack white_block1 from green_block2 → putdown white_block1.

4. pickup green_block2 → stack green_block2 green_block3.

This satisfies the constraint in step4. The plan length is 7 actions. But is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, can we stack green_block2 on green_block3 before moving brown_block2? Let's see. To do that, we need to clear green_block2, which is under white_block1. To clear green_block2, we need to move white_block1. But white_block1 is under brown_block2. So we need to unstack brown_block2, but brown_block2 is under green_block3. So the sequence would be:

1. unstack green_block3 from brown_block2 → putdown.

2. unstack brown_block2 from white_block1 → putdown (achieve goal).

3. unstack white_block1 from green_block2 → putdown.

4. pickup green_block2 → stack on green_block3.

But this is the same as before, 7 steps. Is there a way to achieve the constraint with fewer steps?

Wait, what if after unstacking green_block3, we use it to stack on green_block2, but how? Because green_block2 is under white_block1. So that's not possible. Unless we first move white_block1.

Alternatively, after unstacking green_block3 and putting it on the table, then unstack white_block1 from green_block2. But white_block1 is under brown_block2. So to unstack white_block1, we need to first unstack brown_block2 from white_block1. Which requires unstacking green_block3 first. So steps:

1. unstack green_block3 from brown_block2 → putdown.

2. unstack brown_block2 from white_block1 → putdown (goal done).

3. unstack white_block1 from green_block2 → putdown.

4. pickup green_block2 → stack on green_block3.

So steps 1-4 are 7 actions. Is there a way to reduce this?

Alternatively, after step1 (unstack green_block3 and putdown), then unstack white_block1 from green_block2. But wait, white_block1 is under brown_block2, so you can't unstack white_block1 unless brown_block2 is removed. So steps must be:

1. unstack green_block3 from brown_block2 → putdown.

2. unstack brown_block2 from white_block1 → putdown.

3. unstack white_block1 from green_block2 → putdown.

4. pickup green_block2 → stack on green_block3.

So steps 1-4 plus the initial unstack and putdown. So that's 6 actions? Let me recount:

1. unstack green_block3 brown_block2

2. putdown green_block3

3. unstack brown_block2 white_block1

4. putdown brown_block2

5. unstack white_block1 green_block2

6. putdown white_block1

7. pickup green_block2

8. stack green_block2 green_block3

That's 8 actions. Hmm, that's a lot. But maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, maybe after unstacking brown_block2, instead of putting it down immediately, use it to stack on something else. But the goal requires it to be on the table, so eventually it has to be put down. But what if we put it down after stacking green_block2 on green_block3? Let me see:

Alternative plan:

1. unstack green_block3 from brown_block2 → putdown.

2. unstack brown_block2 from white_block1 → now holding brown_block2.

3. unstack white_block1 from green_block2 → can't do that because you're holding brown_block2. So need to putdown brown_block2 first.

Wait, no. While holding brown_block2, you can't unstack white_block1 because you're already holding a block. So steps:

1. unstack green_block3 from brown_block2 → putdown.

2. unstack brown_block2 from white_block1 → holding brown_block2.

3. putdown brown_block2 → goal achieved.

4. unstack white_block1 from green_block2 → now possible because white_block1 is clear.

5. putdown white_block1.

6. pickup green_block2.

7. stack green_block2 green_block3.

That's 7 actions. But is there a way to combine steps to reduce the number?

Alternatively, after step2 (holding brown_block2), instead of putting it down, use it in some way. But I can't stack it on anything unless there's a clear block. Maybe stack it on green_block3, but that's on the table and clear. So:

1. unstack green_block3 from brown_block2 → putdown.

2. unstack brown_block2 from white_block1 → holding brown_block2.

3. stack brown_block2 green_block3. Now brown_block2 is on green_block3. But the goal is to have it on the table, so this doesn't help. So then I would have to unstack it again, which adds steps. Not optimal.

So perhaps the initial plan of 7 actions is the shortest possible. But wait, maybe there's a different order. For example:

Instead of moving green_block3 first, perhaps unstack the entire tower starting from the top. But since the goal is to get brown_block2 on the table, we need to remove green_block3 first.

Another idea: The constraint requires green_block2 to be on green_block3 at least once. Maybe we can stack green_block2 on green_block3 during the process of moving brown_block2. For example, after moving green_block3 to the table, then stack green_block2 on green_block3, then continue moving brown_block2. But how?

Let's try:

1. unstack green_block3 from brown_block2 → putdown.

2. unstack white_block1 from green_block2 → can't do this yet, because brown_block2 is on white_block1. So first need to move brown_block2.

Wait, after step1, brown_block2 is clear. So step2: unstack brown_block2 from white_block1 → holding brown_block2.

3. stack brown_block2 green_block3 → now brown_block2 is on green_block3. But goal is to have it on the table. So this is bad. So step4: unstack brown_block2 from green_block3 → but this requires brown_block2 to be clear. Which it is not if anything is stacked on it. But if we just stacked it, then it's clear. So step4: unstack brown_block2 green_block3 → now holding brown_block2, and green_block3 is clear.

5. putdown brown_block2 → achieves goal.

But now, during this process, green_block2 hasn't been touched. So the constraint hasn't been met. Also, green_block2 is still under white_block1. So this approach doesn't help.

Alternative approach: After step1 (unstack green_block3 and putdown), then stack green_block3 on green_block2. But green_block2 is under white_block1, which is under brown_block2. So to stack green_block3 on green_block2, green_block2 must be clear. So we need to remove white_block1 and brown_block2 first. But that's back to the original problem.

Hmm. Maybe there's no way around it. The minimal plan requires moving green_block3, brown_block2, white_block1, and then stacking green_block2 on green_block3. That would be 7 steps: unstack green_block3, putdown, unstack brown_block2, putdown, unstack white_block1, putdown, pickup green_block2, stack on green_block3. But wait, that's 8 actions. Or maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let's count again:

1. unstack green_block3 from brown_block2 → arm holds green_block3.

2. putdown green_block3 → green_block3 on table.

3. unstack brown_block2 from white_block1 → arm holds brown_block2.

4. putdown brown_block2 → goal achieved.

5. unstack white_block1 from green_block2 → arm holds white_block1.

6. putdown white_block1.

7. pickup green_block2 → arm holds green_block2.

8. stack green_block2 green_block3 → now green_block2 is on green_block3.

So 8 actions. But maybe steps 5 and 6 can be merged into one? No, because you have to unstack white_block1 and then put it down. So two steps. Is there a way to avoid moving white_block1? Like, instead of putting down white_block1, stack it somewhere else. But why? The goal is to have brown_block2 on the table. Moving white_block1 elsewhere doesn't help, but stacking it on another block might not save steps.

Alternatively, after step4, brown_block2 is on the table. Then, to stack green_block2 on green_block3, we can unstack white_block1 from green_block2 and stack it on the table, then pickup green_block2 and stack it. But that still requires the same number of steps.

Wait, maybe after step5 (unstack white_block1 from green_block2), instead of putting it down, stack it on another block. For example, stack white_block1 on green_block3. Then, step6: stack white_block1 green_block3. But then, step7: pickup green_block2. But green_block2 is clear. Then stack it on green_block3. Wait, but green_block3 now has white_block1 on it. So stacking green_block2 on green_block3 would require moving white_block1 again. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, after step5, holding white_block1, stack it on green_block3. Then, green_block3 is no longer clear. So steps:

5. stack white_block1 green_block3 → requires that green_block3 is clear. Yes, after step2, green_block3 is on table and clear. So step5: stack white_block1 green_block3. Now, white_block1 is on green_block3, and green_block3 is not clear. Then, step6: pickup green_block2 → possible because green_block2 is clear (after step5, green_block2 is clear since white_block1 was removed).

7. stack green_block2 green_block3 → but green_block3 now has white_block1 on it. So to stack green_block2 on green_block3, you need to stack on white_block1? No, because the stack action requires stacking onto a clear block. Since white_block1 is on green_block3, and white_block1 is clear (if nothing is on it). But after step5, white_block1 is on green_block3, and green_block3 is not clear. So white_block1 is clear? Yes, because nothing is on top of it. So step7: stack green_block2 white_block1. Then, green_block2 is on white_block1, which is on green_block3. This would satisfy the constraint that green_block2 is on green_block3? No, because it's on white_block1, which is on green_block3. So the constraint requires green_block2 to be directly on green_block3. So this approach doesn't satisfy the constraint.

Therefore, the only way to satisfy the constraint is to have green_block2 directly stacked on green_block3. So the steps must be:

After moving white_block1 off green_block2, pickup green_block2 and stack on green_block3.

So this requires moving white_block1, which is under brown_block2, which requires moving brown_block2 first, which requires moving green_block3 first.

So the minimal steps would be:

1. unstack green_block3 brown_block2 → putdown.

2. unstack brown_block2 white_block1 → putdown (goal achieved).

3. unstack white_block1 green_block2 → putdown.

4. pickup green_block2 → stack green_block3.

But wait, step4 is stack green_block2 green_block3. So the total steps are 7 actions:

1. unstack green_block3 brown_block2

2. putdown green_block3

3. unstack brown_block2 white_block1

4. putdown brown_block2

5. unstack white_block1 green_block2

6. putdown white_block1

7. pickup green_block2

8. stack green_block2 green_block3

Wait, that's 8 steps. But maybe there's a smarter way. What if after step3 (unstack brown_block2 and holding it), instead of putting it down, use it to satisfy the constraint? For example:

After step3: holding brown_block2. Then stack brown_block2 on green_block3. Now brown_block2 is on green_block3, but the goal requires it on the table. So this is not helpful. Then, we'd have to unstack it again, leading to more steps.

Alternatively, after step1 and step2 (green_block3 on table), then unstack white_block1 from green_block2 (but white_block1 is under brown_block2). So I can't do that until brown_block2 is moved. So no.

Hmm. Maybe the minimal plan is 8 steps. But I need to check if there's a way to avoid moving white_block1. For example, if we can somehow stack green_block2 on green_block3 without moving white_block1. But how?

Wait, green_block2 is on the table with white_block1 on it. To stack green_block2 on green_block3, we need to pick up green_block2, but it's under white_block1. So we can't pick it up unless it's clear. So white_block1 must be moved. Therefore, steps to move white_block1 are unavoidable.

Another idea: What if after moving green_block3 and brown_block2, we then move white_block1 by stacking it on green_block3. Then, green_block2 is clear. Then, stack green_block2 on green_block3. So steps:

1. unstack green_block3 brown_block2 → putdown.

2. unstack brown_block2 white_block1 → putdown.

3. unstack white_block1 green_block2 → stack white_block1 green_block3.

4. pickup green_block2 → stack green_block2 green_block3.

This would be steps 1-4, but let's count:

1. unstack g3 b2 → putdown.

2. unstack b2 w1 → putdown.

3. unstack w1 g2 → stack w1 g3.

4. pickup g2 → stack g2 g3.

So that's 6 actions. But step3 is two actions: unstack and stack. Wait, unstack w1 g2 requires that w1 is clear (which it is after step2, since brown_block2 was on top of w1 but now moved). So yes.

So step3: unstack white_block1 from green_block2 (since brown_block2 is gone, white_block1 is clear). Then stack white_block1 on green_block3. Now, green_block3 has white_block1 on it. Then, green_block2 is clear. So step4: pickup green_block2 and stack on green_block3 (but green_block3 now has white_block1 on it). Wait, to stack green_block2 on green_block3, green_block3 must be clear. But after step3, green_block3 has white_block1 on it. So stack green_block2 on white_block1. But then green_block2 is on white_block1, which is on green_block3. So the constraint is that green_block2 is on green_block3. But in this case, it's on white_block1, so the constraint isn't satisfied. So this approach doesn't work.

So this approach fails to meet the constraint. Therefore, the only way to meet the constraint is to have green_block2 directly on green_block3, which requires that green_block3 is clear when green_block2 is stacked. So green_block3 must be on the table and clear.

So the steps would be:

1. unstack green_block3 from brown_block2 → putdown.

2. unstack brown_block2 from white_block1 → putdown.

3. unstack white_block1 from green_block2 → putdown.

4. pickup green_block2 → stack green_block3.

So steps 1-4, which is 8 actions. But this seems long. Maybe there's a way to combine some steps.

Wait, after step2, brown_block2 is on the table (goal achieved). Then, steps3-6 are for moving white_block1 and stacking green_block2. But is there a way to avoid putting down white_block1 and instead stack it on green_block3 directly, thereby freeing green_block2 earlier?

Let's see:

After step3: unstack white_block1 from green_block2 → holding white_block1.

Instead of putting it down, stack it on green_block3. Then, green_block3 has white_block1, but then green_block2 is clear. So steps:

1. unstack g3 b2 → putdown.

2. unstack b2 w1 → putdown.

3. unstack w1 g2 → stack w1 g3.

4. pickup g2 → stack g2 g3.

Wait, step3: stack w1 g3. Now, green_block3 has white_block1. Step4: pickup g2 and stack on g3. But g3 is not clear (has w1 on it). So you can't stack g2 on g3 unless g3 is clear. So this approach doesn't work.

Therefore, the only way is to put down white_block1, then pickup green_block2 and stack on green_block3. So steps:

1. unstack g3 b2 → putdown.

2. unstack b2 w1 → putdown.

3. unstack w1 g2 → putdown w1.

4. pickup g2 → stack g2 g3.

That's 7 actions. Wait, let's count:

1. unstack green_block3 brown_block2

2. putdown green_block3

3. unstack brown_block2 white_block1

4. putdown brown_block2

5. unstack white_block1 green_block2

6. putdown white_block1

7. pickup green_block2

8. stack green_block2 green_block3

No, that's 8 steps. But wait, step5 and 6 are unstack and putdown. Then step7 and 8 are pickup and stack. So 8 steps. Is there any way to reduce this?

Alternatively, after step5 (unstack white_block1 from green_block2), instead of putting it down, can we stack it somewhere else where it's needed? Not really, since the goal is already achieved. But perhaps we can stack it on green_block3. So:

5. stack white_block1 green_block3

6. pickup green_block2

7. stack green_block2 green_block3

But step7 requires that green_block3 is clear, but it has white_block1 on it. So this is not possible. Therefore, step5 must be putdown white_block1.

Thus, the minimal plan is 8 actions. But wait, the problem requires the optimal plan, which is as short as possible. Is there a shorter way?

Wait, what if after unstacking green_block3 and brown_block2, we stack green_block2 on green_block3 before putting down brown_block2? Let's see:

1. unstack green_block3 brown_block2 → putdown.

2. unstack brown_block2 white_block1 → holding brown_block2.

3. unstack white_block1 green_block2 → can't do this while holding brown_block2. So step3: putdown brown_block2.

4. unstack white_block1 green_block2 → putdown.

5. pickup green_block2 → stack on green_block3.

So steps:

1. unstack g3 b2 → putdown.

2. unstack b2 w1 → putdown.

3. unstack w1 g2 → putdown.

4. pickup g2 → stack g3.

So this is the same as before. Still 8 steps.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps stack green_block2 on green_block3 while green_block3 is still on top of brown_block2. But in the initial state, green_block3 is on brown_block2. So can we unstack green_block3, then stack green_block2 on green_block3, then put green_block3 back on brown_block2? But that would be extra steps.

For example:

1. unstack green_block3 brown_block2 → holding g3.

2. stack green_block2 g3 → but green_block2 is under white_block1. Can't do this.

No. So this is impossible.

Another idea: Use the first tower (with grey_block1) to temporarily place blocks. For example, after unstacking green_block3, put it on the first tower's top. Then, proceed. But this might not help.

But perhaps:

1. unstack green_block3 from brown_block2 → stack green_block3 grey_block1 (the top of the first tower).

Now, green_block3 is on grey_block1.

2. unstack brown_block2 from white_block1 → putdown.

3. unstack white_block1 from green_block2 → putdown.

4. pickup green_block2 → stack on green_block3.

Now, green_block2 is on green_block3, which is on grey_block1. This satisfies the constraint. Then, perhaps we can move green_block3 back. But the goal is already achieved (brown_block2 is on the table), so these extra steps aren't needed. But the constraint is satisfied when green_block2 is on green_block3, regardless of where green_block3 is.

So this plan would be:

1. unstack green_block3 brown_block2

2. stack green_block3 grey_block1

3. unstack brown_block2 white_block1

4. putdown brown_block2

5. unstack white_block1 green_block2

6. putdown white_block1

7. pickup green_block2

8. stack green_block2 green_block3

This is 8 steps. But maybe steps 2 is better than putting green_block3 on the table, but it doesn't reduce the total number of steps.

Alternatively, after step1 (unstack green_block3), stack it on green_block2. But green_block2 is under white_block1. So that's not possible. Unless you can unstack white_block1 first. Which you can't because brown_block2 is on top of it.

Hmm. I think I've exhausted all possibilities, and the minimal plan is 8 actions. But wait, let me check if there's a way to satisfy the constraint without moving white_block1.

Wait, the constraint is that green_block2 is on green_block3 in at least one state. Suppose that after moving green_block3 to the table, and before moving brown_block2, we stack green_block2 on green_block3. But green_block2 is under white_block1. So we can't do that. Unless we move white_block1 first. Which requires moving brown_block2. So this brings us back to the same steps.

Alternatively, is there a way to stack green_block2 on green_block3 while green_block3 is in mid-air? No, because the robotic arm can only hold one block at a time. So to stack green_block2 on green_block3, you need to have green_block3 on a block or table, and clear.

Another Idea: After unstacking green_block3, instead of putting it down, use it as the base for green_block2. But you need to have green_block3 on the table or another block. So steps:

1. unstack green_block3 brown_block2 → holding g3.

2. putdown g3 → now g3 is on table.

3. unstack brown_block2 white_block1 → holding b2.

4. putdown b2 → goal achieved.

5. unstack white_block1 green_block2 → putdown.

6. pickup green_block2 → stack on g3.

This is 6 steps. Wait, steps 1-6:

1. unstack g3 b2 → putdown.

2. unstack b2 w1 → putdown.

3. unstack w1 g2 → putdown.

4. pickup g2 → stack g3.

But steps 1-4 would be:

1. unstack g3 b2 → putdown g3.

2. unstack b2 w1 → putdown b2.

3. unstack w1 g2 → putdown w1.

4. pickup g2 → stack g2 g3.

That's 8 actions. Wait, no. Each action is a separate step. So the total is 8 steps. But why did I think it's 6 earlier? Because I miscounted.

So the conclusion is that the minimal plan requires 8 actions. But the user expects an optimal plan, which is as short as possible. However, maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think again.

Wait, what if after unstacking brown_block2 from white_block1, instead of putting it down immediately, we stack it on the table. Wait, putting it down is the same as putdown. So that's necessary.

Alternatively, after unstacking green_block3 and brown_block2, can we use the arm's actions in a different order to save steps.

For example:

1. unstack green_block3 brown_block2 → putdown.

2. unstack brown_block2 white_block1 → putdown.

Now the goal is achieved. Then, to meet the constraint:

3. unstack white_block1 green_block2 → putdown.

4. pickup green_block2 → stack green_block3.

But steps 3 and 4 are two actions. So total steps are 6. Wait, no:

Wait, step1: unstack g3 b2 → step2: putdown g3.

Step3: unstack b2 w1 → step4: putdown b2.

Step5: unstack w1 g2 → step6: putdown w1.

Step7: pickup g2 → step8: stack g2 g3.

Total 8 steps. So no saving.

But perhaps there's a way to combine unstack and stack actions. For example, after unstacking white_block1 from green_block2, instead of putting it down, stack it on green_block3. Then, pickup green_block2 and stack it on green_block3. But as discussed earlier, this would require green_block3 to be clear, which it isn't if white_block1 is stacked on it. So that doesn't work.

Another Idea: Maybe after unstacking green_block3 and putting it down, then unstack white_block1 from green_block2. But white_block1 is under brown_block2, which is under green_block3. So until brown_block2 is moved, white_block1 is not clear. So no.

So I think the minimal plan is 8 actions. However, the user expects the plan to be optimal, so perhaps there's a shorter way. Let me think once more.

Ah! Maybe the constraint can be satisfied during the process, not after achieving the goal. For example, after moving green_block3 to the table, and before moving brown_block2, can we somehow stack green_block2 on green_block3. But green_block2 is under white_block1 and brown_block2. So we need to move those first. Which requires the same steps.

Alternatively, after moving green_block3 to the table, can we stack brown_block2 on green_block3, then unstack it again. But this adds steps. So not helpful.

Wait, here's a different approach:

The constraint is that at least once during the plan, green_block2 is on green_block3. So maybe after moving green_block3 to the table, we can stack green_block2 on green_block3, then unstack it to proceed with moving brown_block2. But this requires:

1. unstack green_block3 brown_block2 → putdown.

2. unstack white_block1 green_block2 → can't do this yet because brown_block2 is on white_block1.

So first, unstack brown_block2 from white_block1 → putdown.

3. unstack white_block1 green_block2 → putdown.

4. pickup green_block2 → stack green_block3.

5. unstack green_block2 green_block3 → putdown.

6. pickup brown_block2 → putdown.

But this is way more steps and doesn't help.

Another Idea: After moving green_block3 to the table, stack green_block2 on green_block3, then unstack it to continue. But to stack green_block2 on green_block3, we need to clear green_block2 first, which requires moving white_block1 and brown_block2. Which brings us back to the same steps.

I think I'm going in circles. The conclusion is that the minimal plan requires 8 actions. But wait, the user's problem might have a shorter solution. Let's check the initial state again.

Wait, the initial state of the second tower is:

green_block2 (table) → white_block1 → brown_block2 → green_block3.

The goal is to have brown_block2 on the table. So the steps needed are:

1. unstack green_block3 from brown_block2 → putdown.

2. unstack brown_block2 from white_block1 → putdown.

These two steps achieve the goal. But the constraint requires that at some state, green_block2 is on green_block3. So how can we satisfy that without additional steps? It's impossible. So we need to add steps to make green_block2 be on green_block3. But those steps require moving white_block1 off green_block2, which requires unstacking it. So the minimal steps are:

1. unstack g3 b2 → putdown.

2. unstack b2 w1 → putdown.

3. unstack w1 g2 → putdown.

4. pickup g2 → stack g3.

Thus, 8 actions. However, perhaps there's a way to satisfy the constraint during the process. For example, after step1, green_block3 is on the table. Then, stack green_block2 on green_block3. But green_block2 is under white_block1 and brown_block2. So this is not possible. So no.

Therefore, the minimal valid plan that achieves the goal and satisfies the constraint is 8 actions. But let's verify:

After step8 (stack green_block2 green_block3), the constraint is met. The goal was achieved at step4. So the plan is valid.

So the steps are:

```
unstack green_block_3 brown_block_2
putdown green_block_3
unstack brown_block_2 white_block_1
putdown brown_block_2
unstack white_block_1 green_block_2
putdown white_block_1
pickup green_block_2
stack green_block_2 green_block_3
```

But wait, after step7 (pickup green_block_2), to stack it on green_block_3, green_block_3 must be clear. Since green_block_3 was putdown in step2, it's on the table and clear. So yes.

Yes, this plan achieves the goal and satisfies the constraint. The length is 8 actions. Is there a shorter plan? I don't think so. Therefore, this is the optimal plan.
