I'll solve this planning problem step by step.

First, let me understand the initial state:
- purple_block_1 is on the table with red_block_1 on top of it and purple_block_2 on top of red_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on the table with white_block_1 on top of it
- purple_block_3 is on the table with brown_block_1 on top of it
- purple_block_2, brown_block_1, and white_block_1 are clear
- The robot arm is not holding anything

The goal is to have brown_block_1 on the table.

The constraints require:
1. At some point, brown_block_1 must have a block on top of it (not be clear)
2. Before brown_block_1 has a block on top of it, either purple_block_3 or grey_block_1 must not be on the table

Let's plan:
1. First, I need to unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_3
2. Then, I need to pick up another block and stack it on brown_block_1 to satisfy constraint #1
3. But before doing that, I need to ensure either purple_block_3 or grey_block_1 is not on the table (constraint #2)

Here's my plan:

```
unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3
putdown brown_block_1
unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1
pickup grey_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
stack white_block_1 brown_block_1
unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1
putdown white_block_1
```

This plan:
1. Takes brown_block_1 off purple_block_3 and puts it on the table
2. Unstacks white_block_1 from grey_block_1
3. Picks up grey_block_1 (making it not on the table, satisfying constraint #2)
4. Puts grey_block_1 back on the table
5. Stacks white_block_1 on brown_block_1 (making brown_block_1 not clear, satisfying constraint #1)
6. Finally, unstacks white_block_1 from brown_block_1 and puts it on the table
7. Ends with brown_block_1 on the table (the goal)
