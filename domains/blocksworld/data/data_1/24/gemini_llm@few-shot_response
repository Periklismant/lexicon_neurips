Okay, let's break this down. We need to get brown_block_1 on the table. Currently, it's on purple_block_3. We also have a constraint that brown_block_1 must be stacked on something at some point, and before that happens, either purple_block_3 or grey_block_1 must not be on the table.

Here's the plan:

1.  Unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_3. This satisfies the precondition for the constraint.
2.  Putdown brown_block_1.
3.  Pickup purple_block_3.
4.  Stack purple_block_3 brown_block_1. This satisfies the constraint that brown_block_1 is stacked on something.
5.  Unstack purple_block_3 brown_block_1.
6.  Putdown brown_block_1.

```
```
unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3
putdown brown_block_1
pickup purple_block_3
stack purple_block_3 brown_block_1
unstack purple_block_3 brown_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
```
