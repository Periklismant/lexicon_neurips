Let's break down the problem step by step to find an optimal plan that satisfies all the given constraints.

### Initial State:
- purple_block_1 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1
- purple_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_3 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of purple_block_3
- white_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- purple_block_2, brown_block_1, and white_block_1 are clear (no blocks on top)
- The robotic arm is not holding any block.

### Goal:
- brown_block_1 is on the table.

### Constraints:
1. At some point in the plan, brown_block_1 must not be clear (i.e., there must be a block on top of it).
2. Before brown_block_1 is not clear, at least one of the following must be true:
   - purple_block_3 is not on the table, or
   - grey_block_1 is not on the table.

### Analysis:
- Currently, brown_block_1 is on top of purple_block_3 and is clear. To satisfy the first constraint, we need to place a block on top of brown_block_1 at some point.
- The second constraint requires that before placing a block on brown_block_1, either purple_block_3 or grey_block_1 must not be on the table. Currently, both are on the table, so we need to move one of them first.

### Possible Steps:
1. To satisfy the second constraint, we can move grey_block_1 or purple_block_3. Moving grey_block_1 is easier because it has white_block_1 on top, which can be unstacked.
2. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1. This makes grey_block_1 not on the table (since it's being held by the arm temporarily), satisfying the second constraint.
3. Now, we can place a block on brown_block_1. The only block available to place on brown_block_1 is white_block_1 (since it's the one we're holding).
4. Stack white_block_1 on brown_block_1. This satisfies the first constraint (brown_block_1 is not clear now).
5. Now, we can proceed to put brown_block_1 on the table. First, we need to unstack brown_block_1 from purple_block_3.
6. Finally, putdown brown_block_1 on the table to achieve the goal.

### Plan:
```
```
unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1
stack white_block_1 brown_block_1
unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3
putdown brown_block_1
```
```

### Explanation:
1. `unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1`: This moves white_block_1 from grey_block_1, making grey_block_1 not on the table (since it's being held by the arm temporarily). This satisfies the second constraint.
2. `stack white_block_1 brown_block_1`: This places white_block_1 on brown_block_1, making brown_block_1 not clear. This satisfies the first constraint.
3. `unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3`: This picks up brown_block_1 from purple_block_3 so it can be placed on the table.
4. `putdown brown_block_1`: This places brown_block_1 on the table, achieving the goal.

This plan is optimal because it has the minimum number of steps (4) required to achieve the goal while satisfying all constraints. No shorter plan can satisfy both constraints and the goal.
