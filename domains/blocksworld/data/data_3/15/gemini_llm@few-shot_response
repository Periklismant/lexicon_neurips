Okay, let's break this down. We need to get blue_block_1 on top of yellow_block_2. We also have some constraints we need to satisfy along the way.

Here's the plan:

1.  **Satisfy "grey_block_1 is clear"**: We need to move grey_block_2 off of grey_block_1.
2.  **Satisfy "you are holding grey_block_1" and "blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1"**: We need to get blue_block_1 on top of black_block_1, and then pick up grey_block_1.
3.  **Satisfy "grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" or "yellow_block_1 is clear"**: We can satisfy "yellow_block_1 is clear" by moving white_block_1 off of it.
4.  **Get blue_block_1 on top of yellow_block_2**: We need to put blue_block_1 on top of yellow_block_2.

Here's the plan:

```
```
unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
putdown grey_block_2
pickup blue_block_1
stack blue_block_1 black_block_1
pickup grey_block_1
unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1
putdown white_block_1
pickup blue_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
pickup blue_block_1
stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2
```
