Okay, let's see. I need to find a plan to get blue_block_1 on top of yellow_block_2, but there are some constraints to meet along the way. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the goal.

Initial state:

- yellow_block_1 is on the table, with white_block_1 on top of it. So white_block_1 is clear.
- grey_block_1 is on the table, with grey_block_2 on top. So grey_block_2 is clear.
- black_block_1, yellow_block_2, and blue_block_1 are all on the table and clear.
- The arm is empty.

Goal: blue_block_1 is on yellow_block_2.

Constraints:

1. At some point, the arm must be holding grey_block_1 while blue_block_1 is on black_block_1.
2. At some point, grey_block_1 must be clear.
3. At some point, either grey_block_1 is on white_block_1 or yellow_block_1 is clear.

Hmm, let's tackle the main goal first. To stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_2, we need to pick up blue_block_1 and then stack it on yellow_block_2. But both are on the table and clear, so that's straightforward: pickup blue_block_1, stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2. But wait, maybe there are constraints that require intermediate steps.

Now the constraints. Let's look at constraint 1: must have a state where holding grey_block_1 and blue_block_1 is on black_block_1. So at some point, blue_block_1 has to be stacked on black_block_1, and the arm is holding grey_block_1. So to do that, we need to first put blue_block_1 on black_block_1. Then, later, we might have to move it again to yellow_block_2. But that would require unstacking it, which might complicate things. Also, during the process when we are holding grey_block_1, blue_block_1 must already be on black_block_1.

Constraint 2: grey_block_1 must be clear at some point. Initially, grey_block_1 has grey_block_2 on it, so it's not clear. To make it clear, we need to remove grey_block_2. So maybe unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1 and put it down. Then grey_block_1 becomes clear. That would satisfy constraint 2.

Constraint 3: Either grey_block_1 is on white_block_1 or yellow_block_1 is clear. Initially, yellow_block_1 has white_block_1 on top, so it's not clear. To make it clear, we need to remove white_block_1. Alternatively, we can place grey_block_1 on white_block_1. But placing grey_block_1 on white_block_1 would require first picking up grey_block_1 (but initially, it has grey_block_2 on it, so we can't pick it up until we remove grey_block_2). So maybe to satisfy constraint 3, we can either move white_block_1 off yellow_block_1 (making yellow_block_1 clear) or stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1. However, stacking grey_block_1 on white_block_1 would require moving grey_block_2 first.

Let me think step by step.

First, the main goal is blue on yellow_2. So steps needed for that: pickup blue, stack on yellow_2. But blue is on table, clear. So those two steps. But we have to satisfy the constraints along the way.

But the constraints require certain states. Let's see:

For constraint 1, we need a state where blue is on black_1 and the arm is holding grey_1. So that means at some point, blue is stacked on black_1, and then while that is true, the arm picks up grey_1. But to stack blue on black_1, we need to pickup blue and stack it on black_1. Then later, we need to unstack it and move it to yellow_2. But then, how does the arm hold grey_1 while blue is on black_1?

Wait, the constraint is that in at least one state, both conditions hold: holding grey_1 and blue is on black_1. So the same state must have both. So during the same time, the arm is holding grey_1 and blue is on black_1. So how can that happen? Because once blue is on black_1, to pick up grey_1, the arm must not be holding anything. Let's see:

Suppose we stack blue on black_1 (so blue is on black_1, and the arm is empty). Then, to hold grey_1, we need to pick it up. But grey_1 initially has grey_2 on top. So to pick up grey_1, we need to first remove grey_2. So steps:

1. unstack grey_2 from grey_1 (since grey_2 is on grey_1 and clear). So unstack grey_2 grey_1. Then putdown grey_2. Now grey_1 is clear. Then pickup grey_1. But when we pickup grey_1, blue is on black_1. So during the step where the arm is holding grey_1, blue is on black_1. So that would satisfy constraint 1. But wait, when we stack blue on black_1, that happens earlier. Let's outline:

- stack blue_block_1 on black_block_1 (so after this, blue is on black, and black is not clear anymore. Then, to get grey_1 into the arm, we need to first unstack grey_2 from grey_1, put it down, then pickup grey_1. So during the pickup of grey_1, blue is on black_1, so that would satisfy the first constraint.

But the main goal is to have blue on yellow_2. So after stacking blue on black_1, we need to unstack it again. That complicates the plan, but maybe necessary to satisfy the constraints.

So possible steps:

1. Stack blue on black_1 (so now blue is on black_1, which is part of constraint 1. Then, later, unstack it and move to yellow_2.

But let's think of the sequence:

Original plan without constraints would be:

pickup blue_block_1

stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2

But with constraints, need to insert steps.

Let's outline steps considering the constraints:

To satisfy constraint 1: need to have blue on black_1 and arm holding grey_1.

So steps:

First, stack blue on black_1.

Then, unstack grey_2 from grey_1 (since grey_2 is on grey_1 initially). Then putdown grey_2.

Then, pickup grey_1. At this moment, blue is on black_1, and the arm is holding grey_1. So that's the state that meets constraint 1.

But then, what to do with grey_1? Maybe put it down again, but then we need to use it for other constraints.

Constraint 2: grey_1 must be clear in some state. After unstacking grey_2 and putting it down, grey_1 is clear. So that's satisfied in that state.

Constraint 3: Either grey_1 on white_block_1 or yellow_block_1 clear. So initially, yellow_block_1 has white_block_1 on it. So to make yellow_block_1 clear, we need to move white_block_1. Alternatively, stack grey_1 on white_block_1. But to do that, we need to have grey_1 clear (which we achieve after putting down grey_2) and white_block_1 clear. White_block_1 is on yellow_block_1 and is clear. So to stack grey_1 on white_block_1, we can pickup grey_1 (after putting down grey_2) and stack it on white_block_1. That would satisfy the third constraint's first option. Alternatively, if we move white_block_1, then yellow_block_1 becomes clear.

But perhaps stacking grey_1 on white_block_1 would be a way. Let's see.

So steps:

1. unstack grey_2 from grey_1. Preconditions: grey_2 is on grey_1, grey_2 is clear, arm is empty. So unstack grey_2 grey_1.

Effect: grey_2 is in the arm, grey_1 becomes clear.

2. putdown grey_2. Now grey_2 is on the table, clear. Grey_1 is clear (so constraint 2 is met here).

3. pickup blue_block_1. Preconditions: blue is on table and clear. Stack blue on black_1.

Wait, but initially, blue is on table. So to stack blue on black_1:

3. pickup blue_block_1.

4. stack blue_block_1 black_block_1. Now blue is on black_1, which is part of constraint 1.

Now, to get the arm holding grey_1 while blue is on black_1:

5. pickup grey_block_1 (since it's clear now). But after stacking blue on black_1, the arm is empty. So yes, we can pickup grey_1. Now, the arm is holding grey_1, and blue is on black_1. So this state satisfies constraint 1.

Then, we need to putdown or stack grey_1 somewhere. If we stack it on white_block_1, then that would satisfy the third constraint's first option.

6. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1. Preconditions: holding grey_1, white_block_1 is clear. White_block_1 is on yellow_block_1 and is clear. So stack grey_1 on white_block_1.

But after stacking, white_block_1 is no longer clear. So this would create a tower: yellow_block_1 -> white_block_1 -> grey_block_1. Then, when we need to get blue_block_1 from black_1 to yellow_2, but maybe that's okay.

But then, the main goal is to have blue on yellow_2. So after stacking blue on black_1, we need to unstack it again.

Wait, but in the current plan, blue is already on black_1. So we need to unstack it and put it on yellow_2.

So steps after step 6:

7. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1. Preconditions: blue is on black_1, blue is clear (since it's on top), arm is empty. So unstack.

8. stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2.

But what about the other blocks? Let's check if the steps make sense.

Wait, let me outline the entire plan step by step, considering all constraints:

1. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1 (arm is now holding grey_2)
2. putdown grey_block_2 (grey_2 is on table, grey_1 is clear) → constraint 2 met here
3. pickup blue_block_1 (blue is picked up)
4. stack blue_block_1 black_block_1 (blue is on black_1)
5. pickup grey_block_1 (now arm holds grey_1, blue is on black_1 → constraint 1 met here)
6. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1 (now grey_1 is on white_1 → satisfies constraint 3's first option)
7. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1 (arm holds blue)
8. stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2 (goal achieved)

This plan has 8 steps. Let's check if all constraints are met:

Constraint 1: During step 5, after stacking blue on black_1, the arm picks up grey_1. At that moment, blue is on black_1 and the arm is holding grey_1. So that state meets the first constraint.

Constraint 2: After step 2, grey_1 is clear. So that meets the second constraint.

Constraint 3: After step 6, grey_block_1 is on white_block_1. So that satisfies the third constraint.

Additionally, during step 5, when we pickup grey_1, the state after step 5 is holding grey_1. Then step 6 stacks it on white_1, which meets the third constraint.

Now, check if all preconditions are met for each action:

1. unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1: Initially, grey_2 is on grey_1 and clear. Arm is empty. So valid.

2. putdown grey_block_2: Arm is holding grey_2. Valid.

3. pickup blue_block_1: Blue is on table, clear. Arm empty. Valid.

4. stack blue_block_1 black_block_1: Arm holds blue, black_1 is clear (since initially, black_1 is on table and clear, and no action has moved it). So stack is valid.

5. pickup grey_block_1: After step 2, grey_1 is clear. It's on the table. Arm is empty after stacking blue. So valid.

6. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1: Arm holds grey_1. White_block_1 is on yellow_1 and is clear. So stack is allowed.

7. unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1: Blue is on black_1 and clear. Arm is empty. So unstack is valid.

8. stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2: Arm holds blue, yellow_2 is on table and clear. So valid.

This seems to work. But wait, after step 4 (stacking blue on black_1), black_block_1 is no longer clear. Then, in step 5, when we pick up grey_1, that's okay because black_block_1's state doesn't affect that action.

Also, after step 6, white_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top. So white_block_1 is no longer clear, but that's okay.

Is there a shorter plan? Let's see. Suppose we can combine some steps.

Alternative approach: Maybe when moving blue to black_1 and then to yellow_2, but the constraints require the intermediate steps.

Alternatively, after stacking blue on black_1 and then moving it again, but maybe there's a way to avoid some steps.

Wait, maybe after step 5 (holding grey_1), instead of stacking it on white_block_1, could we put it down somewhere else? But then constraint 3 requires either grey_1 on white or yellow_1 clear. If we put grey_1 down, then we have to make sure that either condition is met. For example, if we instead move white_block_1 off yellow_block_1, then yellow_block_1 becomes clear, which would satisfy constraint 3.

Alternative steps:

1. unstack grey_2 from grey_1 → putdown → grey_1 clear (constraint 2)
2. unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1 → putdown (now yellow_block_1 is clear → satisfies constraint 3)
3. pickup blue, stack on black_1 → then pickup grey_1 (constraint 1)
4. stack grey_1 somewhere, then unstack blue and stack on yellow_2.

But let's see:

1. unstack grey_2 grey_block_1 → putdown grey_2 (grey_1 clear)
2. unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1 → putdown white_block_1 (yellow_block_1 clear → constraint 3 met here)
3. pickup blue → stack blue on black_1 → now blue is on black_1
4. pickup grey_block_1 → now holding grey_1 while blue is on black_1 → constraint 1 met here
5. putdown grey_block_1 → then unstack blue from black_1, stack on yellow_2.

This would have steps:

1. unstack grey2 grey1
2. putdown grey2
3. unstack white1 yellow1
4. putdown white1
5. pickup blue
6. stack blue black1
7. pickup grey1
8. putdown grey1
9. unstack blue black1
10. stack blue yellow2

That's 10 steps. The previous plan was 8 steps. So the first approach is shorter.

But in the first plan, after step 6 (stacking grey_1 on white_1), the yellow_block_1 is still under white_1. But the third constraint requires that in some state, either grey_1 is on white_1 or yellow_1 is clear. By stacking grey_1 on white_1, the first condition is met. So that's okay.

So the first plan with 8 steps meets all constraints and is shorter. Let me check again if all actions are valid.

Step 1: unstack grey2 grey1 → valid (grey2 is on grey1, clear, arm empty).

Step 2: putdown grey2 → valid.

Step 3: pickup blue → blue is on table, clear, arm empty. Valid.

Step 4: stack blue black1 → arm holds blue, black1 is clear. Yes, black1 is initially clear. Valid.

Step 5: pickup grey1 → grey1 is on table, clear, arm empty. Valid.

Step 6: stack grey1 white1 → arm holds grey1, white1 is clear. White1 was on yellow1, and is clear. So valid.

Step 7: unstack blue black1 → blue is on black1 and clear. Arm empty. Valid.

Step 8: stack blue yellow2 → arm holds blue, yellow2 is clear. Valid.

Yes, all steps are valid. The constraints are met:

- Constraint 1: During step 5 (after step 5 is completed, the arm is holding grey1 and blue is on black1).

- Constraint 2: After step 2, grey1 is clear.

- Constraint 3: After step 6, grey1 is on white1.

So this plan works and is optimal as it's 8 steps. Can we make it shorter?

Let me think. Is there a way to avoid moving grey2 and still meet the constraints? Because moving grey2 is necessary to clear grey1 for constraint 2 and to allow pickup grey1 for constraint 1.

Alternatively, what if we move grey2 to yellow1 instead of putting it down? But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, after unstacking grey2, can we stack it somewhere else? Let me see.

If after step 1 (unstack grey2), instead of putting it down, stack it on another block. But that would require that block to be clear. For example, stack grey2 on yellow2. Then, when we need to stack blue on yellow2 later, we need to unstack grey2 first. That would add steps. So probably not better.

Alternatively, after step 5 (holding grey1), instead of stacking on white1, can we stack it on another block and then put it back? Not sure. It seems the first plan is the most efficient.

Another possible optimization: After step 4 (stack blue on black1), maybe instead of picking up grey1, can we do something else. But we need to satisfy constraint 1, which requires holding grey1 while blue is on black1. So step 5 is necessary.

Yes, I think the first plan is optimal. So the answer is:

```
unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
putdown grey_block_2
pickup blue_block_1
stack blue_block_1 black_block_1
pickup grey_block_1
stack grey_block_1 white_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2
```
