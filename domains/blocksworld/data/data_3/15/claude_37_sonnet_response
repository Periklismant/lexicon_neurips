Let's first analyze this blocksworld problem, think about the goal and constraints, and then plan a solution.

**Initial State:**
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1
- white_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is clear
- grey_block_2 is clear
- white_block_1 is clear
- yellow_block_2 is clear
- blue_block_1 is clear
- robot arm is not holding any block

**Goal State:**
- blue_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_2

**Constraints:**
1. At some point, the robot arm must be holding grey_block_1 AND blue_block_1 must be on top of black_block_1
2. At some point, grey_block_1 must be clear (no block on top)
3. At some point, EITHER grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 OR yellow_block_1 is clear

Let's visualize the initial state to better understand the problem:

Initial state:
```
     grey_block_2    white_block_1          black_block_1   blue_block_1   yellow_block_2
          |               |                      |               |               |
     grey_block_1    yellow_block_1             table           table           table
          |
         table
```

Goal state:
```
                                                                  blue_block_1
                                                                      |
                                                                yellow_block_2
                                                                      |
                                                                    table
```

Now, let's plan how to satisfy each constraint:

Constraint 1: "At some point, the robot arm must be holding grey_block_1 AND blue_block_1 must be on top of black_block_1"
- To pick up grey_block_1, we need to remove grey_block_2 from on top of it
- We need to place blue_block_1 on top of black_block_1

Constraint 2: "At some point, grey_block_1 must be clear"
- This means we need to have grey_block_2 removed from grey_block_1

Constraint 3: "At some point, EITHER grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 OR yellow_block_1 is clear"
- To make yellow_block_1 clear, we need to remove white_block_1 from on top of it
- To put grey_block_1 on top of white_block_1, we need to first clear grey_block_1 and then move it

Let's plan a sequence of actions:

1. First, let's satisfy Constraint 2 by clearing grey_block_1:
   - unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1 (this makes grey_block_1 clear, satisfying Constraint 2)
   - putdown grey_block_2

2. Next, let's work on Constraint 1:
   - pickup blue_block_1
   - stack blue_block_1 on black_block_1 (part of Constraint 1)
   - pickup grey_block_1 (completes Constraint 1)

3. For Constraint 3, let's choose to make yellow_block_1 clear:
   - putdown grey_block_1
   - unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (satisfies Constraint 3)
   - putdown white_block_1

4. Finally, to achieve the goal state:
   - pickup blue_block_1 from black_block_1
   - stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_2

Let's check if this plan works:

Wait, I need to be more careful with the constraints. Let's reanalyze:

Constraint 1: "At some point, the robot arm must be holding grey_block_1 AND blue_block_1 must be on top of black_block_1"
This means these two conditions need to be true simultaneously in the same state. So I need to:
1. First stack blue_block_1 on black_block_1
2. Then, with blue_block_1 still on black_block_1, pick up grey_block_1

Let me revise the plan:

1. Let's first clear grey_block_1 to satisfy Constraint 2:
   - unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1 (this makes grey_block_1 clear, satisfying Constraint 2)
   - putdown grey_block_2

2. For Constraint 3, let's choose to make yellow_block_1 clear:
   - unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (satisfies Constraint 3)
   - putdown white_block_1

3. Next, let's work on Constraint 1:
   - pickup blue_block_1
   - stack blue_block_1 on black_block_1 (part of Constraint 1)
   - pickup grey_block_1 (completes Constraint 1 when blue_block_1 is on black_block_1)

4. Then continue:
   - putdown grey_block_1
   - unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1
   - stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_2 (achieving the goal)

Let me verify this plan step by step:

Initial state:
- grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1
- white_block_1 is on yellow_block_1
- all other blocks on table
- all blocks except grey_block_1 and yellow_block_1 are clear
- arm is empty

Step 1: unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1
- arm holds grey_block_2
- grey_block_1 is clear (Constraint 2 satisfied)

Step 2: putdown grey_block_2
- grey_block_2 is on table
- arm is empty

Step 3: unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1
- arm holds white_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is clear (Constraint 3 satisfied)

Step 4: putdown white_block_1
- white_block_1 is on table
- arm is empty

Step 5: pickup blue_block_1
- arm holds blue_block_1
- blue_block_1 not on table

Step 6: stack blue_block_1 on black_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on black_block_1
- arm is empty

Step 7: pickup grey_block_1
- arm holds grey_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on black_block_1
(Constraint 1 satisfied: arm holds grey_block_1 AND blue_block_1 is on black_block_1)

Step 8: putdown grey_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on table
- arm is empty

Step 9: unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1
- arm holds blue_block_1
- black_block_1 is clear

Step 10: stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_2
- blue_block_1 is on yellow_block_2 (Goal satisfied)
- arm is empty

This plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal. Let's check if we can optimize it further:

Actually, I think this is already pretty optimal given the constraints we need to satisfy. Let's finalize the plan:

```
unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
putdown grey_block_2
unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1
putdown white_block_1
pickup blue_block_1
stack blue_block_1 black_block_1
pickup grey_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2
```

Let me check this one more time:

Wait, I don't think we absolutely need to make yellow_block_1 clear for Constraint 3. Constraint 3 says that "at some point, EITHER grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 OR yellow_block_1 is clear". So we could potentially satisfy this with either condition.

Let me see if we can make a more optimal plan by choosing to put grey_block_1 on top of white_block_1 instead:

1. Clear grey_block_1:
   - unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1
   - putdown grey_block_2

2. Move blue_block_1 to black_block_1 and pick up grey_block_1 (for Constraint 1):
   - pickup blue_block_1
   - stack blue_block_1 on black_block_1
   - pickup grey_block_1 

3. For Constraint 3, place grey_block_1 on white_block_1:
   - stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1 (satisfies Constraint 3)

4. Achieve goal:
   - unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1
   - stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_2

Let's verify:

Initial state:
- grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1
- white_block_1 is on yellow_block_1
- all other blocks on table
- all blocks except grey_block_1 and yellow_block_1 are clear
- arm is empty

Step 1: unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1
- arm holds grey_block_2
- grey_block_1 is clear (Constraint 2 satisfied)

Step 2: putdown grey_block_2
- grey_block_2 is on table
- arm is empty

Step 3: pickup blue_block_1
- arm holds blue_block_1

Step 4: stack blue_block_1 on black_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on black_block_1
- arm is empty

Step 5: pickup grey_block_1
- arm holds grey_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on black_block_1
(Constraint 1 satisfied: arm holds grey_block_1 AND blue_block_1 is on black_block_1)

Step 6: stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on white_block_1 (Constraint 3 satisfied)
- arm is empty

Step 7: unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1
- arm holds blue_block_1
- black_block_1 is clear

Step 8: stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_2
- blue_block_1 is on yellow_block_2 (Goal satisfied)
- arm is empty

This plan is more efficient, requiring 8 steps instead of 10. The final plan is:

```
unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
putdown grey_block_2
pickup blue_block_1
stack blue_block_1 black_block_1
pickup grey_block_1
stack grey_block_1 white_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2
```

Let me verify this one last time:

Hmm, there's a potential issue with this plan. When I reach step 5 to pick up grey_block_1, I need to make sure grey_block_1 is still on the table. The step sequence looks good, but let me double-check the state after each step to make sure the preconditions for each action are satisfied.

Step 1: unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
- Precondition: grey_block_2 is clear, grey_block_2 is on grey_block_1, arm is empty ✓
- Effect: arm holds grey_block_2, grey_block_1 is clear ✓

Step 2: putdown grey_block_2
- Precondition: arm holds grey_block_2 ✓
- Effect: grey_block_2 is on table, grey_block_2 is clear, arm is empty ✓

Step 3: pickup blue_block_1
- Precondition: blue_block_1 is clear, blue_block_1 is on table, arm is empty ✓
- Effect: arm holds blue_block_1, blue_block_1 not on table ✓

Step 4: stack blue_block_1 black_block_1
- Precondition: arm holds blue_block_1, black_block_1 is clear ✓
- Effect: blue_block_1 is on black_block_1, blue_block_1 is clear, black_block_1 is not clear, arm is empty ✓

Step 5: pickup grey_block_1
- Precondition: grey_block_1 is clear, grey_block_1 is on table, arm is empty ✓
- Effect: arm holds grey_block_1, grey_block_1 not on table ✓

Step 6: stack grey_block_1 white_block_1
- Precondition: arm holds grey_block_1, white_block_1 is clear ✓
- Effect: grey_block_1 is on white_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear, white_block_1 is not clear, arm is empty ✓

Step 7: unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
- Precondition: blue_block_1 is clear, blue_block_1 is on black_block_1, arm is empty ✓
- Effect: arm holds blue_block_1, blue_block_1 not on black_block_1, black_block_1 is clear ✓

Step 8: stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2
- Precondition: arm holds blue_block_1, yellow_block_2 is clear ✓
- Effect: blue_block_1 is on yellow_block_2, blue_block_1 is clear, yellow_block_2 is not clear, arm is empty ✓

This plan seems valid and satisfies all constraints:
- Constraint 1: At step 5, the arm is holding grey_block_1 AND blue_block_1 is on black_block_1 ✓
- Constraint 2: At step 1, grey_block_1 becomes clear ✓
- Constraint 3: At step 6, grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 ✓

And it achieves the goal of having blue_block_1 on top of yellow_block_2. This is a valid plan with 8 steps.

```
unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
putdown grey_block_2
pickup blue_block_1
stack blue_block_1 black_block_1
pickup grey_block_1
stack grey_block_1 white_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 black_block_1
stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_2
```

This plan is optimal given the constraints we need to satisfy.
