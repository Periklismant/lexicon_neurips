Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to make yellow_block_1 clear. Right now, purple_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1. So I need to remove purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1. But there are some constraints to satisfy too. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the initial state: purple_block_1 is on yellow_block_1, which is on blue_block_1, which is on black_block_1. Then, black_block_2 is on red_block_1, and black_block_3 is alone on the table. The constraints say that I must hold purple_block_1 at some point, and when I do, black_block_2 must have been on the table earlier. Also, there must be a state where something is on top of purple_block_1. Plus, another constraint about either holding yellow_block_1 or blue_block_1 being on the table at some point.

So, the main goal is to clear yellow_block_1. To do that, I need to unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1. But to unstack, I need to have the arm empty, and purple_block_1 must be clear. Wait, in the initial state, purple_block_1 is clear. So I can unstack it. Let me check: unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1. The preconditions are that purple is on yellow, purple is clear, and the arm is empty. All true initially. So that's possible. Then, after unstacking, the arm holds purple_block_1, yellow_block_1 becomes clear. That would achieve the goal. But wait, the constraints require that there's a state where purple is being held. That's satisfied here. Also, when I hold purple, there must be an earlier state where black_block_2 is on the table. But initially, black_block_2 is on red_block_1, not the table. So I need to get black_block_2 on the table before I unstack purple. So maybe I need to first put down black_block_2.

Wait, black_block_2 is on red_block_1. To put it on the table, I need to unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. Let's check: unstack black_block_2 red_block_1. Preconditions: black_block_2 is on red_block_1, black_block_2 is clear (which it is, according to initial state), and the arm is empty. Yes, possible. Then after unstacking, the arm holds black_block_2. Then I can put it down. So unstack black_block_2 red_block_1, then putdown black_block_2. Now black_block_2 is on the table. Then, when I later hold purple_block_1, the earlier state (putdown black_block_2) satisfies the constraint that black_block_2 was on the table earlier.

Another constraint: there must be a state where something is on top of purple_block_1. So after moving purple_block_1, maybe I need to stack something on it. But the goal is just to clear yellow_block_1. So perhaps after unstacking purple, I need to stack it somewhere else, but maybe on top of another block. Wait, but the goal doesn't require that. The goal is only about yellow_block_1 being clear. So perhaps after moving purple, I can put it down. But if I put it down, then it's on the table, but then there's nothing on top of it. So to satisfy the constraint that there's a state where purple is not clear (something on top), maybe I need to stack another block on purple. But which block? Let's see. Available blocks: after moving black_block_2 to the table, and then unstacking purple, I have purple in hand. Then perhaps stack purple on black_block_2. But then that would make purple not clear. Then, later, maybe unstack it again? But that might complicate things. Let's see.

Wait, the constraint says that if there's something on purple (i.e., purple is not clear), then in an earlier state, either I was holding purple or black_block_2 was not clear. So let's think. Suppose I stack purple on black_block_2. That makes purple not clear. So in that state, the condition must have been met in an earlier state. So before stacking purple on black_block_2, I must have either held purple (which I did when I unstacked it) or black_block_2 had a block on it. Since black_block_2 was on the table and clear after I put it down, then when I stack purple on it, the earlier state (when I was holding purple) satisfies the condition. So that's okay.

So the plan steps could be:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. (Arm holds black_block_2)
2. Putdown black_block_2. (Now black_block_2 is on table)
3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (Arm holds purple_block_1. This satisfies the first constraint that we hold purple. Also, step 2 made black_block_2 on table, which is earlier than step 3, satisfying the second constraint.)
4. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_2. (Now purple is on black_block_2, making it not clear. This satisfies the third constraint. Also, since in step 3 we were holding purple, which is an earlier state, the fourth constraint is satisfied.)
5. Now, the goal is already achieved (yellow is clear). But wait, after step 3, yellow is clear. So steps 4 and beyond may not be necessary for the goal. But we need to satisfy the constraints. Let's check.

The third constraint requires that in some state, purple is not clear. Stacking it on black_block_2 achieves that. The fourth constraint says that if purple is not clear, then in an earlier state, either holding purple or black_block_2 is not clear. Here, the earlier state is step 3 (holding purple), which satisfies the condition. So steps 1-4 would satisfy all constraints except the last one: "At least one of the following conditions is true: holding yellow_block_1 or blue_block_1 is on the table." In the initial state, blue_block_1 is under yellow_block_1. So blue_block_1 is not on the table. So in the plan, when is blue_block_1 on the table? Maybe if we unstack blue_block_1. Wait, but the goal is to have yellow_block_1 clear. If we unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1, that would require moving yellow and purple first. Wait, but in the initial setup, blue_block_1 is under yellow and purple. So to get blue_block_1 on the table, we need to remove yellow and purple. But the goal is to have yellow clear, which we achieve by removing purple. So perhaps after step 3, we could putdown purple, but then we don't need to stack it on black_block_2. But then we need to have a state where something is on top of purple. Hmm, this is conflicting. Let me re-examine.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 3 (holding purple), we can stack it on black_block_3. But black_block_3 is on the table and clear. So stacking purple on black_block_3 would make black_block_3 not clear, and purple is on it. Then, the constraint about something on purple would require that in some state, purple is not clear. Wait, no, the third constraint is that there is a state where purple is not clear (i.e., something is on top of it). If we stack another block on purple, but we don't have any blocks left except perhaps black_block_3. Wait, but we need to do that. Wait, the available blocks are black_block_1, red_block_1, blue_block_1, black_block_2, yellow_block_1, black_block_3, purple_block_1. After step 3, purple is in hand. If we stack it on black_block_3, then purple is on black_block_3, and then nothing is on purple (so it's clear). That doesn't help. To have something on purple, we need to place another block on it. But all blocks are already placed except maybe others. Wait, perhaps after stacking purple on black_block_2, then we can stack another block on top of purple. But which block? Let's see. After step 4, purple is on black_block_2. Then, we could pick up another block and stack it on purple. For example, black_block_3 is on the table. So steps could be:

4. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_2.
5. Pickup black_block_3 (which is on the table and clear).
6. Stack black_block_3 on purple_block_1.

Now, purple_block_1 has black_block_3 on top, making it not clear. But then, this would satisfy the third constraint (purple is not clear in step 6). Also, the fourth constraint requires that before that, either we were holding purple or black_block_2 was not clear. In this case, step 4 was stacking purple on black_block_2, which made black_block_2 not clear. So step 4 is before step 6, so that's okay. But this adds more steps. However, the problem requires an optimal plan, meaning the shortest possible. So adding steps 5 and 6 might not be optimal. Is there a way to satisfy the constraints with fewer steps?

Wait, the third constraint is that there exists at least one state where purple is not clear. If we stack purple on black_block_2 (step 4), then purple is on top of black_block_2. So purple is clear (since nothing is on it), but black_block_2 is not clear. Wait, no: when you stack x on y, x becomes clear (because nothing is on x), and y becomes not clear. So after stacking purple on black_block_2, purple is clear. So that doesn't make purple not clear. Therefore, stacking purple on black_block_2 doesn't satisfy the third constraint. Oh, right, the effect of stack is that x is clear. So stacking purple on black_block_2 would make purple clear, and black_block_2 not clear. So that doesn't help with the third constraint. So we need to have a state where purple is not clear, i.e., something is on top of it. So maybe after stacking purple on black_block_2, we need to stack another block on top of purple. But which block? Let's see available blocks.

After step 4, the blocks on the table are black_block_1 (with blue and yellow on top?), wait no. Let me re-express the initial state:

Initial state:

- black_block_1 is on table, with blue_block_1 on top of it, then yellow_block_1, then purple_block_1.

- red_block_1 is on table with black_block_2 on top.

- black_block_3 is on table.

So, after step 1: unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1, then putdown (step 2). Now black_block_2 is on table.

Step 3: unstack purple from yellow. Now, purple is in hand. Then, step 4: stack purple on black_block_2. Now, purple is on black_block_2, which is on table. Purple is clear (nothing on top). So to get something on top of purple, we need to place another block there. Let's see available blocks: black_block_3 is on table. Maybe pick up black_block_3 and stack it on purple. But black_block_3 is on table. So step 5: pickup black_block_3 (since it's clear and on table), then stack it on purple (step 6). Then, purple is not clear (has black_block_3 on top). This would satisfy the third constraint. Also, the fourth constraint: when purple is not clear (step 6), there must be an earlier state where either holding purple or black_block_2 is not clear. The earlier state where we held purple is step 3 and step 4 (when stacking). Also, black_block_2 was made not clear in step 4 (since purple is stacked on it). So that satisfies the fourth constraint.

But this adds steps 5 and 6. However, the problem requires the optimal (shortest) plan. So is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, after unstacking purple (step 3), instead of stacking it, perhaps put it on the table. Then, we need to satisfy the third constraint (something on top of purple). So maybe stack another block on purple. But to do that, we need to have a block to stack. Let's see, after step 3, purple is in hand. Put it down (step 4). Then, pick up another block and stack it on purple. But which block?

Available blocks on table after step 4 (assuming we putdown purple):

- black_block_2 is on table (from step 2).

- red_block_1 is on table (since black_block_2 was unstacked from it).

- black_block_3 is on table.

- purple is on table.

But in this case, to stack something on purple, we need to pick up, say, black_block_3 and stack it on purple. But that requires that black_block_3 is clear, which it is. So steps:

3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1.

4. Putdown purple_block_1.

5. Pickup black_block_3.

6. Stack black_block_3 on purple_block_1.

Now, in step 6, purple has black_block_3 on top, satisfying the third constraint. Also, when that happens, the fourth constraint requires that in an earlier state, either we held purple or black_block_2 wasn't clear. We did hold purple in step 3, which is earlier, so that's okay. Also, the second constraint is satisfied because when we hold purple in step 3, black_block_2 was put on table in step 2, which is earlier. But this adds steps 4,5,6. However, the initial plan without these steps would have the goal achieved in step 3. But we need to satisfy all constraints. So the minimal steps would need to include these.

But this seems longer. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think again.

The third constraint: there must be a state where purple is not clear. So we need to have a block on top of purple. The minimal way to achieve this is to stack something on purple. The shortest way would be to unstack purple, then stack it under another block. Wait, but stacking it under another block would require that block to be clear. Alternatively, after unstacking purple, stack another block on top of it. Wait, but how? Because to stack another block on purple, you need to pick up that block and stack it on purple. For example:

After unstacking purple (step3), put it down (step4). Then pickup black_block_3 (step5), stack it on purple (step6). Now, purple has black_block_3 on top. This satisfies the third constraint. But this adds three steps (4,5,6). But the initial goal was achieved at step3. So the total steps would be 6. But maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, after unstacking purple (step3), stack it on top of black_block_3. Then, purple is on black_block_3, which is clear. Then, purple is clear. That doesn't help. So we need to have something on purple. So maybe after stacking purple on black_block_3, we can stack another block on it. But that requires additional steps. Not sure.

Alternatively, after unstacking purple (step3), stack it on top of black_block_2 (step4). Then, stack black_block_3 on top of purple (step5). Now, purple has black_block_3 on top. This achieves the third constraint. So steps would be:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.

2. Putdown black_block_2.

3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1.

4. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_2.

5. Pickup black_block_3.

6. Stack black_block_3 on purple_block_1.

This makes purple not clear (step6). But step4 makes purple clear. So step6 is needed. But this adds more steps. However, the problem requires an optimal plan. Is there a way to achieve this with fewer steps?

Wait, maybe we can use the fact that when we stack purple on another block, but then unstack it again, but that might not help. Let's see.

Another angle: the fifth constraint requires that in some state, either we are holding yellow_block_1 or blue_block_1 is on the table. Currently, blue_block_1 is under yellow_block_1. So blue_block_1 is not on the table. So to satisfy this, we need to either pick up yellow_block_1 (which requires unstacking it from blue_block_1, which has purple on top initially) or get blue_block_1 on the table. To get blue_block_1 on the table, we need to unstack everything above it. Since purple is on yellow, which is on blue. So unstack purple, then unstack yellow, then putdown blue. But that's more steps. Let's check.

Original goal is to have yellow clear. If we unstack purple (step3), then yellow is clear. So the goal is achieved. But to satisfy the fifth constraint, we need either to hold yellow or have blue on table. But in the plan where we unstack purple and stack it elsewhere, maybe we can unstack yellow from blue_block_1. Let's see:

After step3 (holding purple), put it down (step4). Then unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1 (step5). That requires that yellow is clear, which it is after step3. So step5: unstack yellow from blue. Then putdown yellow (step6). Now blue is on table. This satisfies the fifth constraint (blue is on table). So steps:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.

2. Putdown black_block_2.

3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1.

4. Putdown purple_block_1.

5. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1.

6. Putdown yellow_block_1.

Now, blue_block_1 is on table. This satisfies the fifth constraint. Also, during step5, we hold yellow, which also satisfies the fifth constraint. But this adds steps 4-6. But this is longer. However, the fifth constraint only needs to be true in at least one state. So if during step5, we are holding yellow, then that satisfies the constraint. So maybe after step3, instead of stacking purple on black_block_2, we can unstack yellow from blue. Let's think:

Plan:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.

2. Putdown black_block_2.

3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1.

4. Putdown purple_block_1.

5. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1.

Now, at step5, we are holding yellow, which satisfies the fifth constraint. Then, putdown yellow (step6). Now, blue is on table. But this adds steps. Alternatively, after step3 (holding purple), can we stack purple somewhere and then unstack yellow?

But this is getting complicated. Let me list all constraints again:

Constraints:

1. Must hold purple in at least one state. (Satisfied by step3.)

2. When holding purple, there must be an earlier state where black_block_2 is on table. (Step2 satisfies this.)

3. Must have a state where purple is not clear. (Need to stack something on it.)

4. If purple is not clear, then in an earlier state, either held purple or black_block_2 was not clear.

5. Must have a state where either holding yellow or blue is on table.

So, the minimal steps would require satisfying all constraints with as few steps as possible.

Let's try to find a plan that satisfies all constraints with the fewest actions.

Here's a possible plan:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. (Arm holds black_block_2.)

2. Putdown black_block_2. (Now black_block_2 is on table. Satisfies the requirement for constraint2 when we later hold purple.)

3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (Now holding purple. Constraint1 satisfied.)

4. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_2. (Now purple is on black_block_2. Purple is clear, black_block_2 is not clear. This doesn't satisfy constraint3 yet.)

5. Pickup black_block_3. (From table.)

6. Stack black_block_3 on purple_block_1. (Now purple is not clear. Constraint3 satisfied. Also, for constraint4: when purple is not clear (step6), we earlier held purple (step3) and black_block_2 was not clear (from step4 onwards). So either condition holds.)

7. Now, for constraint5: need to have either hold yellow or blue on table. Currently, blue is still on black_block_1. So need to do something. Maybe after step3, before stacking purple, unstack yellow from blue. But wait, after step3, yellow is clear. So we can unstack yellow from blue.

Alternative plan after step3:

3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1.

4. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1. (Now holding yellow. This satisfies constraint5.)

5. Putdown yellow_block_1. (Yellow is on table.)

6. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_2. (Now, purple is on black_block_2, which is on table. Then, need to stack something on purple to make it not clear.)

7. Pickup black_block_3.

8. Stack black_block_3 on purple_block_1.

But this is getting longer. However, constraint5 is satisfied in step4 (holding yellow).

Alternatively, after step3, stack purple on black_block_3, then pickup black_block_2 and stack it on purple. But black_block_2 is on table. Wait, after step2, black_block_2 is on table. So step4: stack purple on black_block_2 (step4). Then step5: pickup black_block_3 and stack on purple (step5). Now purple is not clear. Then, step6: unstack yellow from blue. Now, blue is on table, satisfying constraint5. So steps:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.

2. Putdown black_block_2.

3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (Holding purple.)

4. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_2.

5. Pickup black_block_3.

6. Stack black_block_3 on purple_block_1. (Purple not clear.)

7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1. (Holds yellow, satisfying constraint5.)

8. Putdown yellow_block_1.

But this makes the plan 8 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, after step3 (holding purple), can we stack it on black_block_2 (step4), then pickup black_block_3 and stack on purple (step5). Now, constraint3 is satisfied. Then, unstack yellow from blue (step6), which holds yellow (satisfying constraint5). Then putdown yellow (step7). So total steps:7. But is there a way to avoid some steps?

Alternatively, after step6 (unstack yellow), do we need to put it down? Because the goal is to have yellow clear. If we unstack yellow from blue, then yellow is in the arm. Then, putting it down would make blue clear. But the goal is already achieved by step3. Wait, the goal is to have yellow_block_1 clear. Initially, yellow_block_1 has purple on top. After step3, purple is removed, so yellow is clear. So the goal is achieved after step3. All steps after that are for constraints. So steps 4-7 are for constraints. So the minimal plan would need to include steps to satisfy the constraints, but not affect the goal.

But how can we satisfy all constraints with the fewest steps after achieving the goal?

Let's think again. The goal is achieved at step3. The constraints are:

- Must hold purple (step3).

- When holding purple (step3), must have had black_block_2 on table earlier (step2).

- Must have a state where purple is not clear (requires stacking something on it).

- If purple is not clear, then in an earlier state, held purple or black_block_2 not clear. So stacking something on purple requires that prior to that, either held purple (step3) or black_block_2 was not clear (which would be after step4 if we stack purple on black_block_2).

- Must have a state where holding yellow or blue is on table.

So the minimal steps would be:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.

2. Putdown black_block_2.

3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (Goal achieved, constraints1 and2 satisfied.)

Now, to satisfy constraint3 (purple not clear), need to stack something on purple. But currently, purple is in hand. So we need to place it somewhere and then put something on it. So:

4. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_2. (Now, purple is clear, black_block_2 not clear.)

5. Pickup black_block_3.

6. Stack black_block_3 on purple_block_1. (Purple not clear. Constraint3 satisfied. Also, constraint4: in step3, we held purple, which is earlier.)

For constraint5, we need to have either hold yellow or blue on table. Currently, blue is still under yellow. So maybe after step3, unstack yellow from blue. But after step3, yellow is clear. So:

7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1. (Holding yellow, satisfies constraint5.)

8. Putdown yellow_block_1.

But this is 8 steps. However, perhaps there's a way to satisfy constraint5 without additional steps. For example, if blue_block_1 is on the table. To do that, we need to unstack yellow and blue. But yellow is under purple, which we've already removed. So after step3, yellow is clear. So we can unstack yellow from blue (step4), then putdown blue (no, blue is on black_block_1). Wait, to get blue on table, need to unstack blue from black_block_1. Which is possible after step3, since yellow is clear. So:

4. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1. (Holding yellow. This satisfies constraint5.)

5. Putdown yellow_block_1.

6. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1. (Holding blue.)

7. Putdown blue_block_1. (Now blue is on table. Also satisfies constraint5.)

But this adds steps. However, constraint5 is already satisfied by step4 (holding yellow). So maybe step4 is enough. So the plan could be:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.

2. Putdown black_block_2.

3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1.

4. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1. (Holding yellow. Satisfies constraint5.)

5. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_2. (Now purple is clear.)

6. Pickup black_block_3.

7. Stack black_block_3 on purple_block_1. (Purple not clear.)

But this is 7 steps. But wait, after step4, we have yellow in hand. To put it down, we need a step5. So:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.

2. Putdown black_block_2.

3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1.

4. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1.

5. Putdown yellow_block_1.

6. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_2.

7. Pickup black_block_3.

8. Stack black_block_3 on purple_block_1.

Now, constraint5 is satisfied at step4 (holding yellow). This plan has 8 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, after step3 (holding purple), can we stack it on black_block_3, then pickup black_block_2 and stack it on purple. But black_block_2 is on table. So:

3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1.

4. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_3. (Now purple is clear.)

5. Pickup black_block_2.

6. Stack black_block_2 on purple_block_1. (Now purple is not clear. Satisfies constraint3. Also, when stacking black_block_2 on purple, the condition for constraint4 is met because we held purple in step3, which is earlier.)

Additionally, constraint5: need to hold yellow or have blue on table. To do that, after step6, we can unstack yellow from blue:

7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1. (Holding yellow.)

8. Putdown yellow_block_1.

But this is 8 steps. Not better.

Alternatively, after step3, stack purple on black_block_2 (step4), then stack black_block_3 on purple (step5). Then, unstack yellow from blue (step6). So steps:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.

2. Putdown black_block_2.

3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1.

4. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_2.

5. Pickup black_block_3.

6. Stack black_block_3 on purple_block_1.

7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1.

8. Putdown yellow_block_1.

This is 8 steps. But maybe there's a way to avoid some steps.

Wait, after step3, if we stack purple on black_block_2 (step4), then pickup black_block_3 (step5) and stack it on purple (step6). This makes purple not clear. Then, in step7, unstack yellow from blue (which is possible because yellow is clear) and put it down (step8). But the fifth constraint is satisfied at step7 (holding yellow). So total steps:8.

But maybe there's a way to combine some steps. For example, after stacking purple on black_block_2, can we use another block to satisfy constraint5. Wait, after step4, purple is on black_block_2. Then, if we unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1, that would require unstacking yellow first. Which we can't do unless yellow is clear. Wait, after step3, yellow is clear. So:

After step3, yellow is clear. So step4 could be unstack yellow from blue_block_1. Then, putdown yellow (step5). Now, blue_block_1 is clear. Then, unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1 (step6). Putdown blue (step7). Now, blue is on table, satisfying constraint5.

But then, we still need to handle the purple constraints. So:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.

2. Putdown black_block_2.

3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (constraint1 and2 satisfied)

4. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1. (constraint5 satisfied)

5. Putdown yellow_block_1.

6. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1.

7. Putdown blue_block_1. (blue on table, constraint5 again satisfied)

8. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_2.

9. Pickup black_block_3.

10. Stack black_block_3 on purple_block_1. (constraint3)

This is 10 steps, which is longer. Not optimal.

So the minimal plan seems to require around 8 steps. But maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, what if after unstacking purple (step3), we stack it on black_block_3 (step4). Then, pickup black_block_2 (step5) and stack it on purple (step6). Now, purple has black_block_2 on top (so not clear). This satisfies constraint3. But black_block_2 was on table, so step5 requires unstacking black_block_2 from table. Wait, you can't unstack from table. You can only pickup from table. So to pickup black_block_2 from table, which is possible if it's clear (which it is after step2). So:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.

2. Putdown black_block_2.

3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1.

4. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_3.

5. Pickup black_block_2.

6. Stack black_block_2 on purple_block_1. (Now purple is not clear. Constraint3 satisfied.)

Now, in step6, purple has black_block_2 on top. So for constraint4, when purple is not clear (step6), the earlier states must have held purple (step3) or black_block_2 was not clear. But black_block_2 was put on table in step2 and picked up in step5. So before step6, black_block_2 was clear until step5. So the earlier state where we held purple (step3) satisfies constraint4. So this works.

Now, constraint5: need to have either hold yellow or blue on table. So in this plan, we haven't done anything with yellow or blue. Blue is still on black_block_1. So we need to address that. So maybe after step3, unstack yellow from blue.

So:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.

2. Putdown black_block_2.

3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1.

4. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1. (Holding yellow, satisfies constraint5.)

5. Putdown yellow_block_1.

6. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_3.

7. Pickup black_block_2.

8. Stack black_block_2 on purple_block_1.

Now, this is 8 steps. It satisfies all constraints:

- Constraint1: step3.

- Constraint2: step2 before step3.

- Constraint3: step8 (black_block_2 on purple).

- Constraint4: step3 (held purple) before step8.

- Constraint5: step4 (holding yellow).

This seems to work. But wait, step6 is stacking purple on black_block_3. But after step3, we are holding purple. So step4 would require putting down purple first. Wait no, step3: unstack purple, so holding purple. Step4: unstack yellow from blue requires that the arm is empty. But after step3, the arm is holding purple. So step4 can't be done unless we putdown purple first. So the plan has a mistake.

Ah, right! After step3, we're holding purple. To unstack yellow, we need the arm to be empty. So we need to putdown purple first. So corrected plan:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.

2. Putdown black_block_2.

3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1.

4. Putdown purple_block_1.

5. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1. (Now holding yellow, satisfies constraint5.)

6. Putdown yellow_block_1.

7. Pickup purple_block_1.

8. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_3.

9. Pickup black_block_2.

10. Stack black_block_2 on purple_block_1.

Now, this is 10 steps. Too long.

Alternatively, after step3, stack purple on black_block_2 (step4), then unstack yellow (step5). But to unstack yellow, the arm must be empty. So after step4, the arm is empty. So step5 is possible.

So:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.

2. Putdown black_block_2.

3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1.

4. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_2. (Arm is empty.)

5. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1. (Holding yellow, satisfies constraint5.)

6. Putdown yellow_block_1.

7. Pickup black_block_3.

8. Stack black_block_3 on purple_block_1. (Purple not clear, constraint3.)

Now, this is 8 steps. Let's check all constraints:

1. Held purple in step3. Yes.

2. When holding purple (step3), earlier step2 put black_block_2 on table. Yes.

3. Purple not clear in step8. Yes.

4. In step8, purple has block on top. Earlier state: step3 (held purple) and step4 (stacked on black_block_2, making black_block_2 not clear). So either condition holds. Yes.

5. Holding yellow in step5. Yes.

So this plan has 8 steps. But is there a shorter way?

Wait, after step4 (stacking purple on black_block_2), can we stack black_block_3 on purple without picking it up? No, because black_block_3 is on the table and clear. So need to pickup and stack. So steps7 and8 are needed.

Alternatively, after step5 (holding yellow), can we stack yellow on purple? Then purple would not be clear. But then we need to put yellow on purple. But after step5, we can:

5. Stack yellow_block_1 on purple_block_1. (But purple is on black_block_2. Stacking yellow on purple would require purple to be clear. After step4, purple is on black_block_2 and is clear. So yes. So step5: stack yellow on purple. Now, purple is not clear. So step5 would satisfy constraint3. Then step6: putdown not needed, because stacking is done. Wait, but stacking yellow on purple would require holding yellow. So after step5: unstack yellow from blue (step5), then stack yellow on purple (step6). But after step5, we are holding yellow. So:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.

2. Putdown black_block_2.

3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1.

4. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_2.

5. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1.

6. Stack yellow_block_1 on purple_block_1. (Now, purple is not clear. Constraint3 satisfied.)

Now, this is 6 steps. Let's check:

1. Holding purple in step3. Yes.

2. step2 before step3. Yes.

3. Purple not clear in step6. Yes.

4. For constraint4, when purple is not clear (step6), earlier state held purple (step3) or black_block_2 not clear (step4). Yes.

5. Holding yellow in step5 and step6. So constraint5 satisfied.

This seems to work. So the plan would be:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.

2. Putdown black_block_2.

3. Unstack purple_block_1 from yellow_block_1.

4. Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_2.

5. Unstack yellow_block_1 from blue_block_1.

6. Stack yellow_block_1 on purple_block_1.

Now, let's check the preconditions for each step:

Step1: unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. Preconditions: black_block_2 is on red_block_1, clear, and arm empty. Yes.

Step2: putdown black_block_2. Arm is holding it after step1. Yes.

Step3: unstack purple from yellow. Purple is on yellow, clear, arm empty (after step2). Yes.

Step4: stack purple on black_block_2. Need to be holding purple (step3) and black_block_2 is clear (after step2 putdown, black_block_2 is on table and clear). Yes.

Step5: unstack yellow from blue. Yellow is on blue, clear (since purple was removed in step3), arm empty (after step4). Yes.

Step6: stack yellow on purple. Holding yellow (step5), purple is clear (after step4, purple is on black_block_2 and clear). Yes.

Effects after step6: yellow is on purple, which is on black_block_2. Purple is not clear (has yellow on top). So constraint3 satisfied.

constraint5: holding yellow in steps5 and6, so satisfied.

This plan has 6 steps, which is better than previous attempts. Let's verify all constraints:

- Constraint1: step3 holds purple. Yes.

- Constraint2: step2 (black_block_2 on table) before step3. Yes.

- Constraint3: step6, purple has yellow on top. Yes.

- Constraint4: when purple is not clear (step6), earlier states include step3 (held purple) and step4 (black_block_2 not clear). Either condition satisfies the constraint. Yes.

- Constraint5: step5 and step6 hold yellow. Yes.

Yes, this plan satisfies all constraints and is shorter. Therefore, this is the optimal plan.
