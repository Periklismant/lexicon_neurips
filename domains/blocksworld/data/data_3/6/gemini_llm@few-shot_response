Okay, let's break this down. The goal is to make yellow_block_1 clear. Currently, purple_block_1 is on top of it. So, we need to move purple_block_1. We also have several constraints to satisfy.

1.  We must hold purple_block_1 at some point.
2.  Before holding purple_block_1, black_block_2 must be on the table.
3.  purple_block_1 must have a block on top of it at some point.
4.  Before purple_block_1 has a block on top of it, either we are holding purple_block_1 or black_block_2 is not clear.
5.  Either we are holding yellow_block_1 or blue_block_1 is on the table.

Here's a plan that addresses these requirements:

```
```
unstack purple_block_1 yellow_block_1
pickup purple_block_1
putdown purple_block_1
pickup black_block_2
putdown black_block_2
stack purple_block_1 black_block_2
unstack purple_block_1 black_block_2
putdown purple_block_1
```
