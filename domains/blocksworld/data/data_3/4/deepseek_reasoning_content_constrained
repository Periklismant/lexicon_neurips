Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to make sure that white_block_1 is clear in the final state. Also, there are some constraints that must be satisfied at some point during the plan. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the goal, then figure out the steps needed while incorporating the constraints.

First, the initial state. Let's list out where each block is:

- red_block_1 is on the table with grey_block_1 on top of it, and brown_block_1 on top of grey_block_1. So the stack here is red -> grey -> brown, and brown is clear.
- white_block_1 is on the table with blue_block_1 on top. Blue is clear.
- orange_block_1 and orange_block_2 are both on the table and clear.
- The arm is empty.

The goal is to have white_block_1 clear. That means blue_block_1, which is currently on white_block_1, needs to be moved somewhere else. So the main task is to move blue_block_1 off white_block_1.

But there are constraints:

1. At some state, orange_block_2 must not be clear (has a block on top).
2. At some state, orange_block_1 is not on the table (so it's on another block).
3. At some state, the arm is holding red_block_1 and orange_block_2 has a block on top.

So the plan needs to include actions that satisfy these constraints, in addition to achieving the main goal.

Let me think step by step.

First, the main goal: move blue_block_1 from white_block_1. Since blue_block_1 is on white_block_1 and is clear, we can unstack it. Wait, no. To unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1, the preconditions are that blue is on white, blue is clear, and the arm is empty. So yes, we can do that. So unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1, then put it down. But putting it down would make white_block_1 clear. Wait, but putting blue_block_1 on the table would satisfy the main goal. So maybe that's the straightforward approach. But then, after unstacking and putting down, white_block_1 is clear. But that might be too quick, and we need to check if the constraints are met.

But the problem is the constraints. Let's look at the constraints again.

Constraint 1: At some point, orange_block_2 has a block on top. So we need to place a block on orange_block_2 at some point.

Constraint 2: orange_block_1 is not on the table. So it must be stacked on another block at some point.

Constraint 3: At some state, the arm is holding red_block_1 and orange_block_2 is not clear. So during the plan, there's a moment where the arm has red_block_1 and there's a block on orange_block_2.

So how to incorporate these?

Let's see. The main goal is to clear white_block_1, which requires moving blue_block_1. Let's consider moving blue_block_1 to orange_block_2. That would satisfy constraint 1 (since orange_block_2 would have blue_block_1 on it), but wait, blue is on white, so to stack it on orange_block_2, we need to unstack it first. So:

1. unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1. Now holding blue_block_1.
2. stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2. Now orange_block_2 has blue on it (satisfies constraint 1), and white_block_1 is clear (goal achieved). But also, when stacking blue on orange_2, that action's effect is that orange_2 is not clear anymore. So that's good for constraint 1.

But then, we need to also handle the other constraints. Constraint 2 requires orange_block_1 to be not on the table. So we need to move orange_block_1 onto some block. Where? Maybe onto red_block_1's stack? But red_block_1 is part of a tower with grey and brown on top. Let's see.

But constraint 3 requires that at some point, the arm is holding red_block_1 and orange_block_2 is not clear. So we need to pick up red_block_1, and during that time, orange_block_2 has a block on top.

Wait, but red_block_1 is under grey and brown. So in the initial state, red_block_1 has grey on top. So to pick up red_block_1, we need to first remove grey and brown. Because the precondition for pickup is that the block is on the table and clear. But red_block_1 is on the table but has grey on top. So we can't pick it up directly. So to get red_block_1, we have to unstack the blocks above it.

So the stack is red -> grey -> brown. So to get red_block_1, we need to unstack brown from grey, then unstack grey from red, then we can pick up red. But that seems complicated. However, constraint 3 requires that in some state, the arm is holding red_block_1 while orange_block_2 is not clear. So maybe after stacking blue on orange_2 (making orange_2 not clear), we need to get red_block_1 into the arm. But red is under grey and brown. So perhaps that's a problem.

Alternative approach: Let's first deconstruct the red_block_1's tower. Unstack brown from grey, then unstack grey from red. Then we can pick up red_block_1. But doing all that just to hold red_block_1 might complicate the plan. However, the constraints require that at some point, the arm is holding red_block_1 and orange_block_2 is not clear. So perhaps after stacking blue on orange_2 (so orange_2 is not clear), we need to pick up red_block_1. But red is under grey and brown. So to pick up red, we need to first remove grey and brown.

So steps would be:

First, move blue to orange_2 (to satisfy constraint 1 and part of constraint 3).

But then, to pick up red, need to unstack brown and grey.

Wait, maybe there's another way. Let's consider that constraint 3 requires that in the same state, the arm is holding red_block_1 and orange_block_2 is not clear. So during the same state, both conditions must hold. That is, when the arm is holding red_block_1, there must be a block on orange_block_2.

So perhaps, after stacking a block on orange_block_2 (making it not clear), then while that block is still on orange_2, the arm picks up red_block_1. But red is under other blocks. So how can the arm hold red_block_1 while orange_2 has a block on it? Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe the steps would be:

1. Unstack blue from white and stack on orange_2. Now orange_2 has blue (satisfies constraint 1), white is clear (goal). But now need to handle the other constraints.

2. For constraint 2: need to move orange_block_1 from the table. Maybe stack it somewhere. Where? Perhaps on brown_block_1. But brown is on top of grey, which is on red. So brown is clear. So stack orange_1 on brown. Then orange_1 is not on the table (satisfies constraint 2). But to do that, need to pick up orange_1 (since it's on the table and clear). So:

Action: pickup orange_block_1 (preconditions: clear, on table, arm empty). Yes. Then stack orange_1 on brown. Now brown is under orange_1, so brown is not clear anymore. But that's okay. So that would satisfy constraint 2.

3. For constraint 3: need to have a state where arm is holding red_block_1 and orange_2 is not clear. So after stacking blue on orange_2 (so orange_2 is not clear), we need to have red_block_1 in hand. But red is under grey and brown. So to get red, need to unstack brown from grey, then unstack grey from red, then pickup red. But that's a lot. Let's see.

Wait, but maybe we can arrange the steps such that when we unstack brown and grey, we can put them somewhere else, then pick up red. Then, while holding red, check if orange_2 is still not clear. But after stacking blue on orange_2, unless we move it again, orange_2 remains not clear. So if we stack blue on orange_2, then proceed to unstack the red tower, then pickup red, then during that time, orange_2 still has blue on it. So that would satisfy constraint 3.

So let's outline this:

Steps:

1. unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1. Arm holds blue.

2. stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2. Now orange_2 is not clear (constraint 1 satisfied). White_block_1 is clear (goal achieved). But wait, the goal is the final state. So white_block_1 must be clear at the end. So if we stack blue on orange_2, then at the end, white is clear. So that's okay.

But now, the main goal is achieved. But the constraints must be met during the plan. So after step 2, the main goal is achieved, but we need to check the other constraints.

Constraint 2: orange_1 not on table. So we need to move orange_1.

Constraint 3: during some state, arm holds red and orange_2 is not clear.

So after step 2, orange_2 has blue. Now, need to perform steps that make orange_1 not on table and have a state where arm holds red and orange_2 is not clear.

But after step 2, orange_2 has blue. So in any steps after that, as long as we don't unstack blue from orange_2, orange_2 remains not clear. So if during that time, the arm can hold red, then constraint 3 is satisfied.

So steps could be:

3. pickup orange_block_1 (since it's on table and clear).

4. stack orange_block_1 on brown_block_1 (since brown is clear in the initial state, but after step 2, brown is still under orange_1 if we stack there. Wait, no. After step 2, the initial stack of red, grey, brown remains as it was. Because step 1 and 2 only moved blue. So brown is on grey, which is on red. So brown is clear. So stacking orange_1 on brown is possible.

After stacking orange_1 on brown, orange_1 is not on table (constraint 2 met).

Then, to meet constraint 3, we need to have the arm holding red_block_1 while orange_2 has blue (still). So how to get red into hand.

To pick up red, it must be on table and clear. But red is under grey, which is under brown, which is under orange_1 (after step 4). So the stack would be red, grey, brown, orange_1. Wait, no. Let me clarify:

Original stack: red_block_1 on table, grey_block_1 on red, brown_block_1 on grey. All initially.

After step 4: orange_block_1 is stacked on brown_block_1. So the stack is red -> grey -> brown -> orange_1.

So brown is no longer clear (orange_1 is on top). So to unstack brown from grey, we can't because brown has orange_1 on top. So the stack is now four blocks high.

So to get red, we need to disassemble this entire tower. Let's see.

If we need to hold red_block_1, the preconditions for pickup are that red is on the table and clear. But red is under grey, which is under brown, which is under orange_1. So red is not clear. So to make red clear, we need to remove all blocks above it.

So steps needed would be:

5. unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_1 (preconditions: orange_1 is on brown, orange_1 is clear, arm empty). After step 4, orange_1 is on brown and clear. So yes, we can unstack it. Then put it down or stack elsewhere.

6. unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1 (since after unstacking orange_1, brown is clear).

7. unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1.

8. pickup red_block_1.

At this point, the arm is holding red_block_1, and orange_block_2 still has blue on it (assuming we didn't move it). So this would satisfy constraint 3: holding red and orange_2 not clear.

But this is a lot of steps. However, the problem requires the plan to be optimal, i.e., as short as possible. So perhaps there's a more efficient way.

Alternative approach: Let's see if we can find a way to satisfy all constraints in fewer steps.

First, main goal is to make white_block_1 clear, which requires moving blue_block_1. Let's move it to orange_2. That takes two actions (unstack and stack). Then, to satisfy constraint 2, move orange_1 to some block. Let's say stack it on orange_2 (but orange_2 already has blue). Wait, but blue is on orange_2. So to stack orange_1 on orange_2, we need to unstack blue first. That complicates things. Alternatively, stack orange_1 on brown_block_1. That's possible because brown is clear initially.

So steps:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1

2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_2 (now orange_2 has blue, constraint 1 met, white is clear (goal))

3. pickup orange_block_1

4. stack orange_block_1 brown_block_1 (now orange_1 is not on table, constraint 2 met)

Now, for constraint 3: need to hold red_block_1 while orange_2 is not clear (which it is since blue is on it). So how to get red_block_1.

But red is under grey and brown. So to get red, we need to remove grey and brown. But after step 4, brown has orange_1 on it. So the stack is red -> grey -> brown -> orange_1. So to get red, we need to unstack orange_1, then brown, then grey.

So:

5. unstack orange_block_1 brown_block_1 (arm holds orange_1)

6. putdown orange_block_1 (put it on table, but then orange_1 is back on table, which may not be desired. But we just need to have orange_1 not on table at some point, which step 4 already satisfies. So even if we put it down later, as long as step 4 happened, constraint 2 is met.)

But after step 5, brown is clear again. Then:

7. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1 (arm holds brown)

8. putdown brown_block_1

9. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1 (arm holds grey)

10. putdown grey_block_1

11. pickup red_block_1 (now arm holds red, and orange_2 has blue (from step 2). So constraint 3 is satisfied here.)

Then, after this, we need to put red back somewhere? But the main goal is already achieved (white is clear). The constraints only require that at some state, the conditions hold. So even if we hold red_block_1 and then put it down, as long as during that time constraint 3 is met, it's okay.

But the problem is that the plan needs to end with the goal achieved. So after step 11, the arm is holding red, and white is clear. Then we can putdown red_block_1. But that adds steps. However, the plan needs to be optimal, so the steps should be as few as possible.

But this approach requires many steps. Let's count:

Steps 1-4: 4 steps.

Steps 5-11: 7 steps, plus putdown steps. That's 11 steps plus. That's way too long. There must be a smarter way.

Wait, maybe we can find a way to have the arm hold red_block_1 without needing to dismantle the entire tower. Let's think differently.

Constraint 3 requires that the arm is holding red_block_1 while orange_2 is not clear. Suppose we first stack blue on orange_2 (steps 1 and 2). Now, orange_2 is not clear. Then, we need to hold red_block_1. But red is under grey and brown. So unless we can remove those blocks, we can't pick up red. So perhaps we need to remove the blocks above red.

But that requires:

3. unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1. But brown is under orange_1 (after step 4). Wait, no. After step 4, orange_1 is stacked on brown. So after step 4, to unstack brown, we need to first unstack orange_1. So steps would be:

After step 4:

5. unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_1.

6. putdown orange_block_1.

7. unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1.

8. putdown brown_block_1.

9. unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1.

10. putdown grey_block_1.

11. pickup red_block_1.

Now, during step 11, the arm is holding red, and orange_2 has blue (from step 2), so constraint 3 is met. Then, after that, putdown red_block_1. That's step 12.

So total steps would be 12. That's a lot. But maybe there's a way to do it more efficiently.

Alternatively, instead of stacking orange_1 on brown, maybe stack it on orange_2. Wait, but orange_2 has blue from step 2. So if we stack orange_1 on blue, but blue is on orange_2. But to stack, the target block must be clear. Blue is on orange_2 and is clear (after step 2). So after step 2, blue is on orange_2 and clear. So we can stack another block on blue. So:

After step 2:

3. pickup orange_block_1 (since it's on table and clear).

4. stack orange_block_1 blue_block_1 (now orange_1 is on blue, which is on orange_2. So orange_1 is not on table (constraint 2 met), and orange_2 has blue and orange_1. But this requires that blue is clear. Which it is after step 2. So stacking orange_1 on blue is allowed. Then, blue is no longer clear. So after step 4, the stack is orange_2 -> blue -> orange_1.

This way, step 4 satisfies constraint 2 (orange_1 is not on table) and also keeps orange_2 not clear (since blue is on it). Now, to get red_block_1 into the arm, we still need to dismantle the original stack.

But maybe this approach saves steps. Let's see:

Steps:

1. unstack blue from white.

2. stack blue on orange_2 (constraint 1 met).

3. pickup orange_1.

4. stack orange_1 on blue (constraint 2 met).

Now, to get red, we need to unstack grey and brown. But the original stack is red -> grey -> brown. Brown is clear. So:

5. unstack brown from grey.

6. putdown brown.

7. unstack grey from red.

8. pickup red.

Now, at step 8, the arm is holding red, and orange_2 has blue and orange_1, so orange_2 is not clear. Thus, constraint 3 is met.

Then, we can putdown red (step 9), but that's not necessary unless the goal requires it. The goal is to have white_block_1 clear, which is already done in step 2. So the plan would be steps 1-8 plus putting red down? But the final state requires white_block_1 to be clear, which it is. The other blocks can be in any state as long as the constraints are met during the plan.

Wait, but putting down red would add another step. So steps 1-8, then putdown red (step 9). So total of 9 steps. But maybe we can skip putting down red. However, the problem states that the final goal is achieved (white is clear), but the other blocks can be anywhere. So if after step 8, the arm is holding red, then the plan is not finished because the arm is holding a block, which might not be allowed. Wait, the problem says "the task is to bring about the following situation", which is white_block_1 clear. The initial state says the arm is not holding any block, but the final state doesn't mention the arm. So perhaps it's acceptable for the arm to be holding a block at the end. But according to the problem's action effects, when you putdown a block, you are no longer holding it. So if the final action is holding red, that's okay as long as the goal is achieved. But I'm not sure. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says: "the task is to bring about the following situation: 'there is no block on top of white_block_1, i.e., white_block_1 is clear'". The other parts of the state are not mentioned, so they can be in any state. So if the arm is holding red_block_1 at the end, that's acceptable. So steps 1-8 would be the plan. But step 8 is pickup red_block_1, which requires that red is on table and clear. Wait, after step 7 (unstack grey from red), grey is in the arm, and red is on table and clear. So step 8 is pickup red_block_1. But pickup requires that the block is on table and clear. After unstacking grey from red, red is on table and clear. So pickup red is possible. So after step 8, arm holds red. Then the plan would end there. But is that allowed? The problem requires that the final state has white_block_1 clear, which it is. The arm can be holding a block. So perhaps the plan can end with the arm holding red. But I'm not sure if that's allowed. Let's check the problem's initial state: "you are not holding any block". The goal does not mention the arm's state, so it's acceptable.

But maybe the optimal plan would have the arm put down red_block_1 to minimize steps. Wait, but putting it down would take an extra step, making the plan longer. So if it's allowed to end with the arm holding a block, then the plan can be shorter. So steps 1-8: 8 actions.

Let me list the steps again:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_2
3. pickup orange_block_1
4. stack orange_block_1 blue_block_1
5. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
6. putdown brown_block_1
7. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1
8. pickup red_block_1

In step 8, arm is holding red_block_1, and orange_2 has blue and orange_1 (so not clear). So constraint 3 is satisfied (arm holds red and orange_2 not clear). Also, constraint 1 is met in step 2, constraint 2 in step 4. The main goal is achieved in step 2.

But after step 8, the arm is holding red_block_1. The problem doesn't require the arm to be empty at the end, so this is acceptable. Thus, the plan has 8 steps. But let's verify each action's preconditions.

Let's go through each step:

Step 1: unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1.

Preconditions: blue is on white, blue is clear, arm is empty. Initially, blue is on white and clear. Arm is empty. So yes.

After unstacking, arm holds blue, blue is no longer on white. White is now clear (but we need to keep it clear until the end).

Step 2: stack blue_block_1 orange_block_2.

Preconditions: arm holds blue, orange_2 is clear. Initially, orange_2 is clear. Yes. So stacking blue on orange_2. Now, orange_2 is not clear. Blue is on orange_2, and blue is clear (since stacked). Arm is empty.

Step 3: pickup orange_block_1.

Preconditions: orange_1 is on table, clear, arm empty. Yes. Now arm holds orange_1.

Step 4: stack orange_block_1 blue_block_1.

Preconditions: arm holds orange_1, blue is clear. After step 2, blue is on orange_2 and clear (since it's the top of its stack). So yes. Stacking orange_1 on blue. Now, blue is not clear (orange_1 is on top). Arm is empty.

Step 5: unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1.

Preconditions: brown is on grey, brown is clear (since in initial state, brown is on grey and clear). Arm is empty. Yes. After unstacking, arm holds brown. Grey is now clear.

Step 6: putdown brown_block_1.

Preconditions: arm holds brown. Yes. Put it on the table. Now, brown is on table and clear. Arm is empty.

Step 7: unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1.

Preconditions: grey is on red, grey is clear (after step 5, grey is clear). Arm is empty. Yes. Unstack grey from red. Arm holds grey.

Step 8: pickup red_block_1.

Preconditions: red is on table, red is clear (after unstacking grey, red is clear). Arm is empty (after step 7, arm holds grey, so need to put down grey first). Wait, here's a mistake. After step 7, the arm is holding grey_block_1. So step 7's effect is that the arm is holding grey. Then step 8 is pickup red_block_1, which requires the arm to be empty. So this is invalid.

Ah, right. So after step 7, the arm is holding grey. So step 8 can't be pickup red_block_1. Therefore, we need to put down grey first. So:

Step 8: putdown grey_block_1.

Then step 9: pickup red_block_1.

But this adds another step. So the steps would be:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1

2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_2

3. pickup orange_block_1

4. stack orange_block_1 blue_block_1

5. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1

6. putdown brown_block_1

7. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1

8. putdown grey_block_1

9. pickup red_block_1

Now, in step 9, the arm holds red. At this point, orange_2 has blue and orange_1 on it (so not clear). So constraint 3 is met. But the plan is now 9 steps.

But is there a way to avoid this? Let's think.

After step 7, arm holds grey. We need to put it down (step 8), then pick up red (step 9). So yes, those are necessary steps. So the plan is 9 steps.

But is there a shorter way?

Alternative approach: After step 5 (unstack brown from grey), instead of putting down brown, can we stack it somewhere else where it helps us meet a constraint or reduce steps.

But after step 5, arm holds brown. Suppose we stack brown on orange_2. Wait, but orange_2 has blue and orange_1. So to stack on orange_2, the target block must be clear. But after step 4, orange_1 is on top of blue, which is on orange_2. So orange_1 is clear. So stacking brown on orange_1 would be possible. So step 6: stack brown_block_1 orange_block_1. Then, after that:

- orange_1 is on blue, brown is on orange_1. So orange_2's stack is blue -> orange_1 -> brown.

- Then, to unstack grey from red, step 7: unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1 (arm holds grey).

- Then putdown grey (step 8).

- Then pickup red (step 9).

But this way, we avoid putting down brown, but we still need steps to stack and unstack. Let's see:

Steps:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1

2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_2

3. pickup orange_block_1

4. stack orange_block_1 blue_block_1

5. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1

6. stack brown_block_1 orange_block_1

7. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1

8. putdown grey_block_1

9. pickup red_block_1

This is also 9 steps. So no gain.

Alternatively, after step 5 (holding brown), can we stack brown on orange_2's stack? But orange_2 has blue and orange_1. To stack brown on orange_1 (which is on blue), we need orange_1 to be clear. But after step 4, orange_1 is on blue and clear. So yes.

So step 6: stack brown_block_1 orange_block_1.

Now, orange_1 has brown on top, so orange_1 is not clear. Then, to unstack grey from red, we need to do step 7-9 as before.

No, the number of steps remains the same.

So perhaps the minimal plan is 9 steps. But maybe there's a smarter way to satisfy the constraints with fewer steps.

Alternative idea: Use the unstack action to pick up grey from red, then use grey to satisfy one of the constraints. For example, stack grey on orange_2, which would satisfy constraint 1. Then, you can pick up red_block_1 after unstacking grey.

Let me try:

Main goal: move blue from white. But maybe we can do other things first.

Wait, but moving blue is necessary for the goal. Let's try:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1.

2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_2. (constraint 1 met)

3. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1. (requires grey is clear. Initially, grey is under brown, so not clear. So can't do this.)

Ah, no. Initially, grey has brown on top, so grey is not clear. So can't unstack grey from red until brown is removed.

So alternative plan:

1. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1. (possible since brown is on grey and clear. Arm empty.)

2. putdown brown_block_1.

3. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1.

4. putdown grey_block_1.

5. pickup red_block_1. (now arm holds red, and orange_2 is still clear. So constraint 3 not met.)

But we need to have orange_2 not clear when holding red. So during steps 1-5, after step 5, orange_2 is still clear. So this doesn't help.

Alternatively, after step 5, stack red on orange_2. But then orange_2 is not clear. So:

5. stack red_block_1 orange_block_2. (arm holds red. Preconditions: arm holds red and orange_2 is clear. But after step 5, arm holds red, and orange_2 is clear. So yes. After stacking, orange_2 has red. Now, during this step, orange_2 is not clear. But the arm is not holding red anymore. So constraint 3 requires that while holding red, orange_2 is not clear. So this doesn't meet it.

So this approach won't work.

Another approach: Perhaps satisfy constraint 3 by first stacking something on orange_2, then pickup red while orange_2 is not clear.

But to pickup red, it must be on table and clear, which requires removing grey and brown.

But if we have orange_2 not clear by stacking something else (like blue), then after moving blue, unstack grey and brown to get red.

But this seems similar to the previous plan.

Alternatively, use orange_block_1 to satisfy multiple constraints. For example, stack orange_1 on orange_2, making orange_2 not clear (constraint 1), then stack orange_1 on another block to get it off the table (constraint 2).

Wait, but that's conflicting. If you stack orange_1 on orange_2, then later move it, but constraint 2 requires that orange_1 is not on the table at some point. So even if you stack and then unstack, as long as at some point it's not on the table, it's okay.

But maybe:

1. pickup orange_block_1.

2. stack orange_block_1 orange_block_2. (constraint 1 and 2 met)

3. unstack orange_block_1 orange_block_2. (now orange_1 is back in hand)

4. putdown orange_block_1. (now back on table. But constraint 2 requires that at some point it's not on table. Step 2 satisfies that.)

Then proceed to handle the main goal and constraint 3.

But this adds steps. Let's see.

Main goal: move blue from white.

5. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1.

6. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_2. (now orange_2 has blue. So constraint 1 is already met in step 2, but now it's met again.)

But in this approach, steps 2 and 6 both make orange_2 not clear. Maybe this is redundant.

Then, to meet constraint 3: need to hold red while orange_2 is not clear. So after step 6, orange_2 has blue. Then need to pickup red. But red is under grey and brown. So steps 7-10 to unstack them.

This approach seems longer.

Alternatively, use orange_block_1 to meet constraint 2 and 3.

But I think the initial approach of moving blue to orange_2, then orange_1 to brown, then unstacking the red tower to pickup red is the way to go, even though it's 9 steps.

But let's verify all constraints are met.

- Constraint 1: orange_2 has blue after step 2, so it's not clear. Met.

- Constraint 2: orange_1 is stacked on brown after step 4, so not on table. Met.

- Constraint 3: during step 9, arm holds red and orange_2 has blue and orange_1 (since after step 4, orange_1 is stacked on blue, which is on orange_2). So orange_2 is not clear. So met.

So yes, all constraints are met.

Now, the steps:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1

2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_2

3. pickup orange_block_1

4. stack orange_block_1 brown_block_1

5. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1

6. putdown brown_block_1

7. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1

8. putdown grey_block_1

9. pickup red_block_1

Wait, no. In this case, step 4 is stacking orange_1 on brown. Then, brown is under orange_1, so in step 5, unstack brown from grey is possible only if brown is clear. But after step 4, brown has orange_1 on top, so brown is not clear. So step 5 (unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1) is not possible. Because unstack requires that brown is clear. So this is a mistake.

Ah, right. So after step 4, orange_1 is stacked on brown. So brown is not clear. Therefore, step 5 (unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1) is not possible because brown is not clear. So this approach is invalid.

So the previous plan was flawed. This means that after step 4, we cannot unstack brown from grey because brown has orange_1 on top. So the correct steps would be:

After step 4 (stack orange_1 on brown), we need to unstack orange_1 from brown first:

5. unstack orange_block_1 brown_block_1

6. putdown orange_block_1

7. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1

8. putdown brown_block_1

9. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1

10. putdown grey_block_1

11. pickup red_block_1

But this is now 11 steps. Which is longer.

So the previous mistake highlights the need to unstack orange_1 first before accessing brown.

This complicates the plan. So perhaps the correct steps are:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1

2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_2

3. pickup orange_block_1

4. stack orange_block_1 brown_block_1

5. unstack orange_block_1 brown_block_1

6. putdown orange_block_1

7. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1

8. putdown brown_block_1

9. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1

10. putdown grey_block_1

11. pickup red_block_1

This way, constraint 2 is met in step 4 (orange_1 not on table). Constraint 1 is met in step 2. Constraint 3 is met in step 11 (arm holds red, orange_2 has blue from step 2).

But this is 11 steps. However, perhaps there's a way to optimize.

Alternative idea: Instead of stacking orange_1 on brown, stack it on orange_2's stack. Let's try:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1

2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_2 (constraint 1 met)

3. pickup orange_block_1

4. stack orange_block_1 blue_block_1 (constraint 2 met, since orange_1 is not on table. Also, blue is now under orange_1, so orange_2 has blue and orange_1, making it not clear.)

Then, to get red:

5. unstack orange_block_1 blue_block_1 (arm holds orange_1)

6. putdown orange_block_1

7. unstack blue_block_1 orange_block_2 (arm holds blue)

8. putdown blue_block_1

Now, the original stack (red, grey, brown) is still there. To unstack brown from grey, since brown is clear (after initial steps):

9. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1

10. putdown brown_block_1

11. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1

12. putdown grey_block_1

13. pickup red_block_1

This is even longer. So not helpful.

Alternative approach: Let's think of a way to satisfy all constraints without having to dismantle the entire red tower.

Constraint 3 requires that the arm holds red_block_1 while orange_block_2 is not clear. So maybe during the process of moving blue to orange_2, we can have the arm hold red_block_1 at the same time. But how?

After moving blue to orange_2 (steps 1-2), orange_2 is not clear. So we need to pick up red_block_1 while orange_2 is not clear. But red is under grey and brown. So we can't pick up red unless we unstack those.

So the only way is to unstack them. Which takes steps.

Alternatively, is there a way to have the arm hold red_block_1 while orange_2 is not clear without needing to unstack grey and brown?

No, because red is under grey and brown. So the preconditions for pickup require that red is on the table and clear. Which it's not until grey and brown are removed.

So the conclusion is that we need to unstack grey and brown to pick up red.

Thus, the minimal plan would involve:

- Moving blue to orange_2 (2 steps)

- Moving orange_1 to a block (2 steps)

- Unstacking brown and grey (4 steps)

- Picking up red (1 step)

Total steps: 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 = 9 steps. But with the proper sequence.

Let me try to outline the correct steps:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1

2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_2 (constraint 1 met, goal met)

3. pickup orange_block_1

4. stack orange_block_1 brown_block_1 (constraint 2 met)

5. unstack orange_block_1 brown_block_1 (to access brown)

6. putdown orange_block_1

7. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1

8. putdown brown_block_1

9. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1

10. putdown grey_block_1

11. pickup red_block_1 (constraint 3 met)

But this is 11 steps. Is there a way to avoid some steps?

Wait, after step 4, orange_1 is on brown. So brown is not clear. So to unstack brown, we need to unstack orange_1 first (step 5 and 6).

Then unstack brown (step 7 and 8).

Then unstack grey (step 9 and 10).

Then pickup red (step 11).

So this is indeed 11 steps. But the problem requires an optimal plan with the least steps. Is there a shorter way?

Alternative idea: After moving blue to orange_2 (steps 1-2), move orange_1 to orange_2's stack (steps 3-4), then use brown from the original stack to satisfy constraint 3.

Wait, but brown is part of the original stack. Let's see:

After step 2, orange_2 has blue. Then:

3. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1. (preconditions: brown is on grey, clear, arm empty. Yes.)

4. stack brown_block_1 orange_block_2. (preconditions: arm holds brown, orange_2 is clear. Wait, orange_2 has blue, so not clear. Can't stack here.

Alternatively, stack brown on blue. After step 2, blue is on orange_2 and clear. So step 3: unstack brown from grey.

4. stack brown_block_1 blue_block_1. (arm holds brown, blue is clear. Yes.)

Now, orange_2 has blue and brown. So orange_2 is not clear (constraint 1 already met via step 2). Then:

5. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1. (preconditions: grey is on red, clear. After step 3, grey is on red and clear (since brown was removed). Yes.

6. stack grey_block_1 brown_block_1. (arm holds grey, brown is clear (on blue). Yes.

Now, grey is on brown, which is on blue, on orange_2.

7. pickup orange_block_1. (preconditions: on table and clear. Yes.)

8. stack orange_block_1 grey_block_1. (arm holds orange_1, grey is clear. Yes.)

Now, orange_1 is not on table (constraint 2 met).

At this point, to satisfy constraint 3: need to hold red_block_1 while orange_2 is not clear. Orange_2 has blue, brown, grey, orange_1. So it's not clear.

To pick up red_block_1, which is on table and clear after step 5.

So:

9. pickup red_block_1. (preconditions: red is on table, clear. After step 5, red is on table and clear. Yes.)

Now, arm holds red_block_1 and orange_2 is not clear. Constraint 3 met.

This plan has 9 steps:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1

2. stack blue_block_1 orange_block_2

3. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1

4. stack brown_block_1 blue_block_1

5. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1

6. stack grey_block_1 brown_block_1

7. pickup orange_block_1

8. stack orange_block_1 grey_block_1

9. pickup red_block_1

Let's check the preconditions for each step:

Step 1: unstack blue from white. Valid.

Step 2: stack blue on orange_2. Valid.

Step 3: unstack brown from grey. Valid (brown is clear, arm empty).

Step 4: stack brown on blue. Valid (arm holds brown, blue is clear).

Step 5: unstack grey from red. Valid (grey is clear, arm empty).

Step 6: stack grey on brown. Valid (arm holds grey, brown is clear (on blue)).

Step 7: pickup orange_1. Valid (on table, clear).

Step 8: stack orange_1 on grey. Valid (arm holds orange_1, grey is clear).

Step 9: pickup red. Valid (red is on table, clear).

At step 9, arm holds red and orange_2 has blue, brown, grey, orange_1 (so not clear). Constraints all met.

Main goal achieved at step 2.

This plan has 9 steps, which is shorter than the previous 11-step plan. And it satisfies all constraints.

Let's verify each constraint:

- Constraint 1: orange_2 has blue after step 2. Yes.

- Constraint 2: orange_1 is stacked on grey after step 8. Yes.

- Constraint 3: arm holds red_block_1 (step 9) and orange_2 is not clear (has blocks). Yes.

This seems valid. All actions are correctly ordered with preconditions met.

So this plan is valid and optimal with 9 steps.
