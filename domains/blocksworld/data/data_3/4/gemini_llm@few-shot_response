Okay, let's break this down. The goal is to make white_block_1 clear. Currently, blue_block_1 is on top of it. So, we need to remove blue_block_1. We also have some constraints to satisfy along the way.

Here's the plan:

```
```
unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
pickup orange_block_1
stack orange_block_1 orange_block_2
pickup red_block_1
putdown red_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
```
