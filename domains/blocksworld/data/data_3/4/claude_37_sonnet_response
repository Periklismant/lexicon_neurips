Let's first understand the problem and then create a plan step by step.

The current state of the world is:
1. red_block_1 is on the table
2. white_block_1 is on the table
3. grey_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
4. brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
5. blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
6. orange_block_1 is on the table
7. orange_block_2 is on the table
8. brown_block_1 is clear
9. blue_block_1 is clear
10. orange_block_1 is clear
11. orange_block_2 is clear
12. You are not holding any block

The goal is to bring about the situation where "white_block_1 is clear". Currently, blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, so we need to remove blue_block_1 from white_block_1.

The constraints are:
1. At some point, orange_block_2 should not be clear (i.e., there should be a block on top of it).
2. At some point, orange_block_1 should not be on the table.
3. At some point, we need to be holding red_block_1 and simultaneously orange_block_2 should not be clear.

Let's plan this out:

1. First, we need to achieve the goal of making white_block_1 clear. This means we need to remove blue_block_1 from white_block_1. We can do this by unstacking blue_block_1 from white_block_1 and then putting it somewhere.

2. To satisfy the first constraint, we need to place a block on top of orange_block_2 at some point. We could use blue_block_1 for this.

3. To satisfy the second constraint, we need to pick up orange_block_1 from the table at some point. We could either hold it or place it on top of another block.

4. The third constraint is the trickiest. We need to hold red_block_1 at the same time as orange_block_2 is not clear. Currently, red_block_1 has grey_block_1 and brown_block_1 on top of it. We need to remove those, then ensure that orange_block_2 has a block on top of it before we pick up red_block_1.

Let's try to come up with a plan:

1. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1 (now we're holding brown_block_1)
2. Stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_2 (now orange_block_2 is not clear, satisfying the first constraint)
3. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1 (now we're holding grey_block_1)
4. Stack grey_block_1 on orange_block_1 (now orange_block_1 is not clear, and we're not holding any block, satisfying the second constraint)
5. Pickup red_block_1 (now we're holding red_block_1, and orange_block_2 still has brown_block_1 on it, satisfying the third constraint)
6. Putdown red_block_1 (now we're not holding any block)
7. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (now we're holding blue_block_1)
8. Putdown blue_block_1 (now we're not holding any block, and white_block_1 is clear, satisfying the goal)

Actually, I think I might have an issue with step 4. Stack will place grey_block_1 on top of orange_block_1, which means orange_block_1 has a block on top of it. But I don't think that satisfies the constraint "orange_block_1 is not on the table", because orange_block_1 is still on the table, just with a block on top of it.

Let me reconsider this constraint. It says "orange_block_1 is not on the table". This means we need to pick up orange_block_1 from the table at some point.

Let's modify our plan:

1. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1 (now we're holding brown_block_1)
2. Stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_2 (now orange_block_2 is not clear, satisfying the first constraint)
3. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1 (now we're holding grey_block_1)
4. Putdown grey_block_1 (now we're not holding any block)
5. Pickup orange_block_1 (now we're holding orange_block_1, and it's not on the table, satisfying the second constraint)
6. Putdown orange_block_1 (now we're not holding any block)
7. Pickup red_block_1 (now we're holding red_block_1, and orange_block_2 still has brown_block_1 on it, satisfying the third constraint)
8. Putdown red_block_1 (now we're not holding any block)
9. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (now we're holding blue_block_1)
10. Putdown blue_block_1 (now we're not holding any block, and white_block_1 is clear, satisfying the goal)

Actually, it's possible to also make the plan more efficient by removing unnecessary steps. For example, we don't need to putdown red_block_1 and then unstack blue_block_1. We could just stack red_block_1 on top of another block, and then unstack blue_block_1.

But actually wait ... the goal is that white_block_1 is clear, which means we need to remove blue_block_1. But this is the very first structure we see in our world description: "blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1". So the most direct way to achieve our goal is just to unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1, then put it somewhere.

But we still have the constraints to fulfill. Let's see if we can use this more direct path:

1. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (now we're holding blue_block_1)
2. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2 (now orange_block_2 is not clear, satisfying the first constraint)
3. Pickup orange_block_1 (now we're holding orange_block_1, and it's not on the table, satisfying the second constraint)
4. Putdown orange_block_1 (now we're not holding any block)
5. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1 (now we're holding brown_block_1)
6. Putdown brown_block_1 (now we're not holding any block)
7. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1 (now we're holding grey_block_1)
8. Putdown grey_block_1 (now we're not holding any block)
9. Pickup red_block_1 (now we're holding red_block_1, and orange_block_2 still has blue_block_1 on it, satisfying the third constraint)

Wait, the third constraint is satisfied regardless of which block is on top of orange_block_2, as long as orange_block_2 is not clear when we're holding red_block_1.

So, our plan could be:

1. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (now we're holding blue_block_1)
2. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2 (now orange_block_2 is not clear, satisfying the first constraint)
3. Pickup orange_block_1 (now we're holding orange_block_1, and it's not on the table, satisfying the second constraint)
4. Putdown orange_block_1 (now we're not holding any block)
5. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1 (now we're holding brown_block_1)
6. Putdown brown_block_1 (now we're not holding any block)
7. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1 (now we're holding grey_block_1)
8. Putdown grey_block_1 (now we're not holding any block)
9. Pickup red_block_1 (now we're holding red_block_1, and orange_block_2 has blue_block_1 on it, so it's not clear, satisfying the third constraint)
10. Putdown red_block_1 (now we're not holding any block)

But wait, this plan doesn't need to be so complex. The goal is to make white_block_1 clear, and the constraints just need to be satisfied at some point in the plan, not necessarily at the end. Let me simplify the plan:

1. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (now we're holding blue_block_1)
2. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2 (now orange_block_2 is not clear, satisfying the first constraint)
3. Pickup orange_block_1 (now we're holding orange_block_1, and it's not on the table, satisfying the second constraint)
4. Putdown orange_block_1 (now we're not holding any block)
5. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1 (now we're holding brown_block_1)
6. Putdown brown_block_1 (now we're not holding any block)
7. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1 (now we're holding grey_block_1)
8. Putdown grey_block_1 (now we're not holding any block)
9. Pickup red_block_1 (now we're holding red_block_1, and orange_block_2 has blue_block_1 on it, so it's not clear, satisfying the third constraint)

Actually, let's see if we can optimize this further:

1. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (now we're holding blue_block_1, and white_block_1 is clear, satisfying the goal)
2. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2 (now orange_block_2 is not clear, satisfying the first constraint)
3. Pickup orange_block_1 (now we're holding orange_block_1, and it's not on the table, satisfying the second constraint)
4. Putdown orange_block_1 (now we're not holding any block)
5. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1 (now we're holding brown_block_1)
6. Putdown brown_block_1 (now we're not holding any block)
7. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1 (now we're holding grey_block_1)
8. Putdown grey_block_1 (now we're not holding any block)
9. Pickup red_block_1 (now we're holding red_block_1, and orange_block_2 has blue_block_1 on it, so it's not clear, satisfying the third constraint)

Wait, but this is a minimization problem, we need to minimize the number of steps in the plan. I think that I'm making this more complex than it needs to be. Let's focus on satisfying the goal and the constraints in the minimum number of steps. We need to:

1. Remove blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (to make white_block_1 clear)
2. Place a block on top of orange_block_2 (so it's not clear)
3. Pick up orange_block_1 (so it's not on the table)
4. Hold red_block_1 while orange_block_2 is not clear

Let's think about the most efficient way to do this:

1. We need to unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (goal).
2. We can then stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2 (constraint 1).
3. We need to unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1, then grey_block_1 from red_block_1 to be able to pick up red_block_1 (constraint 3).
4. We need to pick up orange_block_1 (constraint 2).

Let's combine these:

1. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (goal satisfied)
2. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2 (constraint 1 satisfied)
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1
4. Putdown brown_block_1
5. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1
6. Putdown grey_block_1
7. Pickup red_block_1 (constraint 3 satisfied, as orange_block_2 has blue_block_1 on it)
8. Putdown red_block_1
9. Pickup orange_block_1 (constraint 2 satisfied)

Actually, let's see if we can be even more efficient:

1. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (goal satisfied)
2. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2 (constraint 1 satisfied)
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1
4. Stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_1 (now we have more options)
5. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1
6. Putdown grey_block_1
7. Pickup red_block_1 (constraint 3 satisfied, as orange_block_2 has blue_block_1 on it)
8. Putdown red_block_1
9. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1
10. Putdown brown_block_1
11. Pickup orange_block_1 (constraint 2 satisfied)

No, this is more steps. Let's simplify again. What's the most efficient order to satisfy the constraints?

1. For the goal, we need to unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1.
2. For constraint 1, we need to place a block on top of orange_block_2. We could use blue_block_1.
3. For constraint 3, we need to hold red_block_1 while orange_block_2 is not clear. Before we can hold red_block_1, we need to remove grey_block_1 and brown_block_1 from it.
4. For constraint 2, we need to pick up orange_block_1 at some point.

Let's try to combine these efficiently:

1. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (goal satisfied)
2. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2 (constraint 1 satisfied)
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1
4. Putdown brown_block_1
5. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1
6. Putdown grey_block_1
7. Pickup red_block_1 (constraint 3 satisfied, as orange_block_2 has blue_block_1 on it)
8. Putdown red_block_1
9. Pickup orange_block_1 (constraint 2 satisfied)

But this is 9 steps. Let's see if there are other ways.

As a sanity check, I need to re-read and check if my understanding of the constraints is correct.

Constraint 1: At some point, orange_block_2 should not be clear (i.e., there should be a block on top of it).

Constraint 2: At some point, orange_block_1 should not be on the table.

Constraint 3: At some point, we need to be holding red_block_1 and simultaneously orange_block_2 should not be clear.

I'm trying to see if I can save some steps. For instance do I need to putdown red_block_1 before picking up orange_block_1? Can't I just stack red_block_1 on another block?

Let's try this:

1. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (goal satisfied)
2. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2 (constraint 1 satisfied)
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1
4. Putdown brown_block_1
5. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1
6. Putdown grey_block_1
7. Pickup red_block_1 (constraint 3 satisfied, as orange_block_2 has blue_block_1 on it)
8. Stack red_block_1 on brown_block_1
9. Pickup orange_block_1 (constraint 2 satisfied)

OK this is still 9 steps.

Actually, instead of putting down brown_block_1, can I stack it on orange_block_1?

1. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (goal satisfied)
2. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2 (constraint 1 satisfied)
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1
4. Stack brown_block_1 on orange_block_1
5. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1
6. Putdown grey_block_1
7. Pickup red_block_1 (constraint 3 satisfied, as orange_block_2 has blue_block_1 on it)
8. Unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1 
9. Stack brown_block_1 on grey_block_1
10. Pickup orange_block_1 (constraint 2 satisfied)

No, that's 10 steps, which is worse.

Let me check my constraints one more time:

Constraint 2 says "orange_block_1 is not on the table". This is true if orange_block_1 is either being held by the robot arm, or if it's on top of another block. So, I could satisfy this constraint by stacking orange_block_1 on another block, which might be more efficient.

Let's try a different approach:

1. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (goal satisfied)
2. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2 (constraint 1 satisfied)
3. Pickup orange_block_1 (now we're holding orange_block_1)
4. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1 (constraint 2 satisfied, as orange_block_1 is on white_block_1, not on the table)
5. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1
6. Putdown brown_block_1
7. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1
8. Putdown grey_block_1
9. Pickup red_block_1 (constraint 3 satisfied, as orange_block_2 has blue_block_1 on it)

Still 9 steps.

Wait, I'm losing track of the goal. The goal is to make white_block_1 clear. So I can't put orange_block_1 on white_block_1! So in fact I can't do exactly what I've described above.

Let's take a step back. Currently, blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, so we need to remove it. We also need to have orange_block_2 not be clear at some point, have red_block_1 being held while orange_block_2 is not clear at some point, and have orange_block_1 not be on the table at some point.

Let's try to be as efficient as possible:

1. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (goal satisfied)
2. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2 (constraint 1 satisfied)
3. Pickup orange_block_1
4. Stack orange_block_1 on brown_block_1 (constraint 2 satisfied)
5. Unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_1
6. Putdown orange_block_1
7. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1
8. Putdown brown_block_1
9. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1
10. Putdown grey_block_1
11. Pickup red_block_1 (constraint 3 satisfied)

But that's 11 steps.

I just realize that brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1, which is on top of red_block_1. To pick up red_block_1, I need to first remove brown_block_1 and grey_block_1 from it.

Actually, we need to think about this in a slightly different way. Let's go step by step:

1. We need to make white_block_1 clear, which means removing blue_block_1 from it.
2. We need to have orange_block_2 not be clear at some point.
3. We need to have red_block_1 being held while orange_block_2 is not clear at some point.
4. We need to have orange_block_1 not be on the table at some point.

For 1, we could unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1.
For 2, we could stack blue_block_1 (or any other block) on orange_block_2.
For 3, we would need to first clear red_block_1 (by removing grey_block_1 and brown_block_1), then pick it up while orange_block_2 is not clear.
For 4, we could either hold orange_block_1 or stack it on another block.

Let's break down the problem a bit more. Currently, the setup is:

- red_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- orange_block_2 is on the table

To pick up red_block_1, we need to first remove brown_block_1 and grey_block_1 from it. To make orange_block_2 not clear, we could stack a block (like blue_block_1) on it. To make orange_block_1 not on the table, we could pick it up or stack it on another block. And to make white_block_1 clear, we need to remove blue_block_1 from it.

Let's try to optimize the plan:

1. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (goal satisfied)
2. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2 (constraint 1 satisfied)
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1
4. Stack brown_block_1, let's say, on white_block_1 (we need to put it somewhere)
5. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1
6. Stack grey_block_1, let's say, on brown_block_1 (we need to put it somewhere)
7. Pickup red_block_1 (constraint 3 satisfied, as orange_block_2 has blue_block_1 on it)
8. Putdown red_block_1
9. Pickup orange_block_1 (constraint 2 satisfied)

That's 9 steps. I don't think we can reduce it further.

But wait, I'm not sure if stacking on white_block_1 is a good idea, since the goal is to make white_block_1 clear. Let's reconsider:

1. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (goal satisfied)
2. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2 (constraint 1 satisfied)
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1
4. Putdown brown_block_1
5. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1
6. Putdown grey_block_1
7. Pickup red_block_1 (constraint 3 satisfied, as orange_block_2 has blue_block_1 on it)
8. Putdown red_block_1
9. Pickup orange_block_1 (constraint 2 satisfied)

This seems like the most efficient plan.

Actually, another optimization we could do is not pick up orange_block_1 at the end, but instead stack red_block_1 on orange_block_1. This would reduce the plan to 8 steps:

1. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (goal satisfied)
2. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2 (constraint 1 satisfied)
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1
4. Putdown brown_block_1
5. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1
6. Putdown grey_block_1
7. Pickup red_block_1 (constraint 3 satisfied, as orange_block_2 has blue_block_1 on it)
8. Stack red_block_1 on orange_block_1 (constraint 2 satisfied, as orange_block_1 has red_block_1 on it)

Actually wait, I might be confused about constraint 2. It says "orange_block_1 is not on the table", not "orange_block_1 has a block on it". If we stack a block on orange_block_1, it is still on the table. So we need to pick up orange_block_1 at some point to satisfy this constraint.

Let me reconsider once more. The only way to have orange_block_1 not be on the table is to either hold it or stack it on another block. If we hold it, that's another action. If we stack it on another block, that's also another action.

Let's compare various approaches:

Option 1: Pick up orange_block_1 at the end.
1. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (goal satisfied)
2. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2 (constraint 1 satisfied)
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1
4. Putdown brown_block_1
5. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1
6. Putdown grey_block_1
7. Pickup red_block_1 (constraint 3 satisfied, as orange_block_2 has blue_block_1 on it)
8. Putdown red_block_1
9. Pickup orange_block_1 (constraint 2 satisfied)

Option 2: Stack red_block_1 on orange_block_1, then pick up orange_block_1.
1. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (goal satisfied)
2. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2 (constraint 1 satisfied)
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1
4. Putdown brown_block_1
5. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1
6. Putdown grey_block_1
7. Pickup red_block_1 (constraint 3 satisfied, as orange_block_2 has blue_block_1 on it)
8. Putdown red_block_1
9. Pickup orange_block_1 (constraint 2 satisfied)

Actually those are identical.

Let's double-check once more. Looking at the constraint again: "orange_block_1 is not on the table". This is true if orange_block_1 is either being held by the robot arm or if it is on top of another block. So, as I thought above, there are two ways to satisfy this constraint. But the way I said (that we could stack a block on orange_block_1 to satisfy this) isn't correct. That would make orange_block_1 have a block on it, but wouldn't make it not be on the table.

So, either we need to hold orange_block_1, or we need to stack it on another block. Let's compare these approaches:

Option 1: Hold orange_block_1.
1. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (goal satisfied)
2. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2 (constraint 1 satisfied)
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1
4. Putdown brown_block_1
5. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1
6. Putdown grey_block_1
7. Pickup red_block_1 (constraint 3 satisfied, as orange_block_2 has blue_block_1 on it)
8. Putdown red_block_1
9. Pickup orange_block_1 (constraint 2 satisfied)

Option 2: Stack orange_block_1 on another block.
1. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (goal satisfied)
2. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2 (constraint 1 satisfied)
3. Pickup orange_block_1
4. Stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1 (constraint 2 satisfied)
5. Unstack orange_block_1 from white_block_1
6. Putdown orange_block_1
7. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1
8. Putdown brown_block_1
9. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1
10. Putdown grey_block_1
11. Pickup red_block_1 (constraint 3 satisfied, as orange_block_2 has blue_block_1 on it)

The first option has 9 steps, the second has 11 steps. So the first option is more efficient.

I'm going to double-check if stacking orange_block_1 on white_block_1 is even allowed, given the goal is to have white_block_1 be clear. Actually the goal is to have "white_block_1 is clear" at the end of the plan. So, if we stack orange_block_1 on white_block_1 at some point, we would need to unstack it later. This is why option 2 has more steps.

Given that the goal is to have white_block_1 be clear at the end of the plan, and the constraints just need to be satisfied at some point during the execution of the plan, option 1 seems to be the most efficient:

1. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (goal satisfied)
2. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2 (constraint 1 satisfied)
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1
4. Putdown brown_block_1
5. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1
6. Putdown grey_block_1
7. Pickup red_block_1 (constraint 3 satisfied, as orange_block_2 has blue_block_1 on it)
8. Putdown red_block_1
9. Pickup orange_block_1 (constraint 2 satisfied)

Let's see if we can reduce the number of steps. In particular, do we need to put down red_block_1 before picking up orange_block_1? We can only hold one block at a time, so yes, we need to put down red_block_1 before picking up orange_block_1.

Actually, what if we pick up orange_block_1 before red_block_1?

1. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (goal satisfied)
2. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2 (constraint 1 satisfied)
3. Pickup orange_block_1 (constraint 2 satisfied)
4. Putdown orange_block_1
5. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1
6. Putdown brown_block_1
7. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1
8. Putdown grey_block_1
9. Pickup red_block_1 (constraint 3 satisfied, as orange_block_2 has blue_block_1 on it)

It still seems like 9 steps is the minimum for this problem.

Let me double-check if there's any other way to optimize this. 

The goal is to make white_block_1 clear, so we must unstack blue_block_1 from it. That's one step. We must also pick up red_block_1, which requires first unstacking brown_block_1 and grey_block_1 (3 more steps). And at some point, we need to make orange_block_2 not clear (at least while holding red_block_1), and make orange_block_1 not be on the table.

So, the minimum required steps seem to be:
1. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1
2. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1
3. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1
4. Pickup red_block_1
5. Make orange_block_2 not clear
6. Make orange_block_1 not be on the table

That's 6 steps minimum, not counting the steps to put down blocks, since we can only hold one block at a time. But there might be dependencies between these steps as well.

Let's see if we can optimize by carefully planning the order:

1. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (goal satisfied)
2. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2 (constraint 1 satisfied)
3. Pickup orange_block_1 (constraint 2 satisfied)
4. Putdown orange_block_1
5. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1
6. Putdown brown_block_1
7. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1
8. Putdown grey_block_1
9. Pickup red_block_1 (constraint 3 satisfied, as orange_block_2 has blue_block_1 on it)

That's 9 steps, which seems to be the minimum.

Let me see if we can do a different order:

1. Pickup orange_block_1 (constraint 2 satisfied)
2. Putdown orange_block_1
3. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (goal satisfied)
4. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2 (constraint 1 satisfied)
5. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1
6. Putdown brown_block_1
7. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1
8. Putdown grey_block_1
9. Pickup red_block_1 (constraint 3 satisfied, as orange_block_2 has blue_block_1 on it)

It still seems like 9 steps is the minimum.

Is there any way to combine some of these steps? For example, instead of putting down brown_block_1 and then picking up grey_block_1, can we stack brown_block_1 on another block?

1. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (goal satisfied)
2. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2 (constraint 1 satisfied)
3. Pickup orange_block_1 (constraint 2 satisfied)
4. Putdown orange_block_1
5. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1
6. Putdown brown_block_1
7. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1
8. Stack grey_block_1 on brown_block_1
9. Pickup red_block_1 (constraint 3 satisfied, as orange_block_2 has blue_block_1 on it)

Still 9 steps. What if we stack grey_block_1 on white_block_1 instead? That's not allowed because the goal is to have white_block_1 clear at the end.

What if we stack grey_block_1 on orange_block_1?

1. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (goal satisfied)
2. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2 (constraint 1 satisfied)
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1
4. Putdown brown_block_1
5. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1
6. Stack grey_block_1 on orange_block_1 (constraint 2 satisfied)
7. Pickup red_block_1 (constraint 3 satisfied, as orange_block_2 has blue_block_1 on it)

I believe that's 7 steps, which would be more efficient. Let me verify:

In step 6, we stack grey_block_1 on orange_block_1. This makes orange_block_1 not clear, but it's still on the table. The constraint is "orange_block_1 is not on the table", not "orange_block_1 is not clear", so this doesn't satisfy constraint 2.

Let me correct the plan:

1. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (goal satisfied)
2. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2 (constraint 1 satisfied)
3. Pickup orange_block_1 (constraint 2 satisfied)
4. Stack orange_block_1 on brown_block_1
5. Unstack orange_block_1 from brown_block_1
6. Putdown orange_block_1
7. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1
8. Putdown brown_block_1
9. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1
10. Putdown grey_block_1
11. Pickup red_block_1 (constraint 3 satisfied, as orange_block_2 has blue_block_1 on it)

That's 11 steps, which is worse.

Actually the plan I've been considering so far has a problem.

Step 3: Pickup orange_block_1. But we can't just pick up orange_block_1 because we're already holding blue_block_1 from step 1. So we must put it down or stack it first.

I think I've been making the problem more complicated than it needs to be. Let me simplify my approach:

1. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (now we're holding blue_block_1, goal satisfied)
2. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2 (now orange_block_2 is not clear, constraint 1 satisfied)
3. Pickup orange_block_1 (now we're holding orange_block_1, constraint 2 satisfied)
4. Putdown orange_block_1 (now we're not holding any block)
5. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1 (now we're holding brown_block_1)
6. Putdown brown_block_1 (now we're not holding any block)
7. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1 (now we're holding grey_block_1)
8. Putdown grey_block_1 (now we're not holding any block)
9. Pickup red_block_1 (now we're holding red_block_1, constraint 3 satisfied as orange_block_2 still has blue_block_1 on it)

That's 9 steps. If the goal is to have white_block_1 clear at the end, and the constraints just need to be satisfied at some point during the execution of the plan, I think this is optimal.

Let me do a final check of the plan and the constraints:

1. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (now we're holding blue_block_1, white_block_1 is clear, goal satisfied)
2. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2 (now orange_block_2 is not clear, constraint 1 satisfied)
3. Pickup orange_block_1 (now we're holding orange_block_1, orange_block_1 is not on the table, constraint 2 satisfied)
4. Putdown orange_block_1 (now we're not holding any block)
5. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1 (now we're holding brown_block_1)
6. Putdown brown_block_1 (now we're not holding any block)
7. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1 (now we're holding grey_block_1)
8. Putdown grey_block_1 (now we're not holding any block)
9. Pickup red_block_1 (now we're holding red_block_1, orange_block_2 still has blue_block_1 on it, so orange_block_2 is not clear, constraint 3 satisfied)

This seems like the most efficient plan that satisfies the goal and all constraints.

Let's be precise about our goal and constraints:

Goal: white_block_1 is clear.
Constraint 1: At some point, orange_block_2 is not clear.
Constraint 2: At some point, orange_block_1 is not on the table.
Constraint 3: At some point, you are holding red_block_1 and simultaneously orange_block_2 is not clear.

Our plan satisfies all of these. Note that the constraints need to be satisfied at some point during the execution of the plan, not necessarily at the end. The goal, on the other hand, needs to be satisfied at the end of the plan.

Seems like 9 steps is the optimal solution.

Actually, I see a way to reduce this to 8 steps. Let me be careful:

1. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (now we're holding blue_block_1, white_block_1 is clear, goal satisfied)
2. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2 (now orange_block_2 is not clear, constraint 1 satisfied)
3. Pickup orange_block_1 (now we're holding orange_block_1, orange_block_1 is not on the table, constraint 2 satisfied)
4. Putdown orange_block_1 (now we're not holding any block)
5. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1 (now we're holding brown_block_1)
6. Putdown brown_block_1 (now we're not holding any block)
7. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1 (now we're holding grey_block_1)
8. Putdown grey_block_1
9. Pickup red_block_1 (now we're holding red_block_1, orange_block_2 still has blue_block_1 on it, so orange_block_2 is not clear, constraint 3 satisfied)

Actually, that's 9 steps. I was counting wrong. I don't see a way to reduce this further. Since the constraints are satisfied at some point during the execution, and the goal is satisfied at the end, I believe this is optimal.

Actually, 9 steps is the minimum I can think of to satisfy the goal and all constraints. Here's the plan again:

1. Unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (now we're holding blue_block_1, white_block_1 is clear, goal satisfied)
2. Stack blue_block_1 on orange_block_2 (now orange_block_2 is not clear, constraint 1 satisfied)
3. Pickup orange_block_1 (now we're holding orange_block_1, orange_block_1 is not on the table, constraint 2 satisfied)
4. Putdown orange_block_1 (now we're not holding any block)
5. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1 (now we're holding brown_block_1)
6. Putdown brown_block_1 (now we're not holding any block)
7. Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1 (now we're holding grey_block_1)
8. Putdown grey_block_1 (now we're not holding any block)
9. Pickup red_block_1 (now we're holding red_block_1, orange_block_2 still has blue_block_1 on it, so orange_block_2 is not clear, constraint 3 satisfied)

The problem states that I need to provide an optimal plan, i.e., a valid plan whose length is equal or less than the length of any other valid plan. And the problem also says I need to write each action of the plan in a specific format: 'ActionName Argument1 ... ArgumentN', and I need to delineate the plan with one top line and one bottom line containing only 3 backtick characters.

So my final plan is:

```
unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
stack blue_block_1 orange_block_2
pickup orange_block_1
putdown orange_block_1
unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
pickup red_block_1
```
