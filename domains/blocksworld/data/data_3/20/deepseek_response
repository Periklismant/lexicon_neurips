**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Unstack purple_block_1 from red_block_1**: This allows us to hold purple, satisfying the constraint that we must hold it at some point.
2. **Stack purple_block_1 on black_block_1**: Ensures purple is never on the table.
3. **Pickup black_block_1**: Now holding black, preparing to move it off the table.
4. **Unstack black_block_1 from purple_block_1**: This is invalid because once purple is stacked on black, black is no longer clear. **This plan is incorrect due to this step. The correct steps are provided in the final answer below.**
