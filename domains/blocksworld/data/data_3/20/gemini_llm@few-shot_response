Okay, let's break this down. We need to get blue_block_1 on top of purple_block_1. We also have some constraints to keep in mind.

1.  purple_block_1 must never be on the table.
2.  We must hold purple_block_1 at some point.
3.  If we hold purple_block_1, then black_block_1 must not be on the table at that time or later.
4.  blue_block_1 must be on top of green_block_1 at some point.

Here's a plan that addresses these requirements:

```
```
unstack purple_block_1 red_block_1
putdown purple_block_1
unstack red_block_1 blue_block_2
putdown red_block_1
unstack blue_block_2 blue_block_1
putdown blue_block_2
pickup black_block_1
putdown black_block_1
pickup blue_block_1
stack blue_block_1 green_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 green_block_1
pickup purple_block_1
stack blue_block_1 purple_block_1
```
