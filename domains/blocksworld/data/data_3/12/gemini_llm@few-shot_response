Okay, let's break this down. We need to get to a state where we are holding grey_block_1. We have several constraints to satisfy along the way.

1.  **Initial State Analysis:** We start with grey_block_1 on top of black_block_1, which is on top of blue_block_1. Also, grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1. brown_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1. red_block_1 is on the table.

2.  **Goal State:** We need to be holding grey_block_1.

3.  **Constraints:**
    *   grey_block_2 must never be on the table.
    *   yellow_block_1 must be not clear at some point.
    *   If yellow_block_1 is not clear, then black_block_1 must be on top of brown_block_1 or we must be holding black_block_1 at that state or a later state.
    *   black_block_1 must be clear at some point.
    *   If black_block_1 is clear, then yellow_block_1 must not be on the table or blue_block_1 must be clear in an earlier state.

4.  **Plan Development:**

    *   To get grey_block_1, we need to unstack it. But first, we need to remove grey_block_2.
    *   To remove grey_block_2, we unstack it from grey_block_1 and put it down on the table. This violates the constraint that grey_block_2 is never on the table. So, we need to put it on another block. brown_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, so we can't stack it there. We can stack it on red_block_1.
    *   Before we can unstack grey_block_2, we need to make sure that red_block_1 is clear.
    *   We need to make black_block_1 clear at some point. To do this, we need to unstack grey_block_1.
    *   We need to make yellow_block_1 not clear at some point. It already isn't clear.
    *   If yellow_block_1 is not clear, then black_block_1 must be on top of brown_block_1 or we must be holding black_block_1 at that state or a later state.
    *   If black_block_1 is clear, then yellow_block_1 must not be on the table or blue_block_1 must be clear in an earlier state.

Here's the plan:

```
```
unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
pickup grey_block_2
stack grey_block_2 red_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1
```
