Let's start by understanding the initial state and the goal state.

Initial State:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is clear
- brown_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Goal State:
- you are holding grey_block_1

Clearly, we need to pick up grey_block_1, but we can't do that immediately because it has grey_block_2 on top of it. Let's understand the constraints next.

Constraints:
1. grey_block_2 is not on the table - This means grey_block_2 must always be on top of another block or held by the arm.
2. there is a block on top of yellow_block_1, i.e., yellow_block_1 is not clear - This means at some point we need to place a block on top of yellow_block_1. Currently, brown_block_1 is on yellow_block_1, so this constraint is already satisfied.
3. If yellow_block_1 is not clear, then at the same state or later, either black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 or we are holding black_block_1. This means if we have placed a block on yellow_block_1, we need to ensure that either black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 or we are holding black_block_1.
4. There is no block on top of black_block_1, i.e., black_block_1 is clear - This means at some point we need to make black_block_1 clear. Currently, grey_block_1 is on top of black_block_1.
5. If black_block_1 is clear, then there must be an earlier state where either yellow_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_1 is clear. This means before we make black_block_1 clear, we need to ensure that either yellow_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_1 is clear.

Now, let's think about the plan step by step.

Our goal is to pick up grey_block_1. However, grey_block_1 has grey_block_2 on top of it.

So, we first need to unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1. But grey_block_2 can't be placed on the table because of constraint 1. So we need to place grey_block_2 on top of another block. Potential choices include red_block_1 or brown_block_1 which are already clear. I'll choose brown_block_1 for now.

After we've done this, we get these states:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is clear (now)
- grey_block_2 is clear
- red_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Alright, now we need to discuss the constraints. 

Constraint 2 requires that there is a block on top of yellow_block_1 at some state. Currently, brown_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, so this constraint is already satisfied.

Constraint 3 says that if yellow_block_1 is not clear, then black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 or we are holding black_block_1. Currently, yellow_block_1 is not clear, so we need to ensure that black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 or we are holding black_block_1 at this state or a later state.

Constraint 4 requires that black_block_1 is clear at some state. Currently, grey_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, so this constraint is not yet satisfied.

Constraint 5 says that if black_block_1 is clear, then there must be an earlier state where yellow_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_1 is clear. We're about to make black_block_1 clear by picking up grey_block_1 (which is our ultimate goal). Currently, yellow_block_1 is on the table and blue_block_1 is not clear. But we haven't made black_block_1 clear yet, so we'll deal with this later.

Also, we need to keep in mind that grey_block_2 can't be on the table at any state.

Let's move forward with our plan:

Given the current arrangement, we need to unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1, which will make black_block_1 clear.

But before we do that, we need to ensure that one of the conditions from Constraint 5 is satisfied: either yellow_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_1 is clear.

Currently, yellow_block_1 is on the table. So, we need to make blue_block_1 clear. To do that, we'd need to remove black_block_1 from blue_block_1. But we can't remove black_block_1 directly because grey_block_1 is on top of it. And since grey_block_1 has grey_block_2 on top, we're in a bit of a loop.

Let's take a step back and think more carefully. 

Actually, wait. Let's reconsider the constraints. Constraint 5 says that if black_block_1 is clear, then there must be an earlier state where either yellow_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_1 is clear. So before we make black_block_1 clear, we need to ensure one of these conditions.

One approach is to lift yellow_block_1 off the table, which would require removing both brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 first. Alternatively, we can make blue_block_1 clear by removing both black_block_1 and grey_block_1.

Let's try the first approach:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1 (first we have to move it)
2. Stack grey_block_2 on red_block_1 (since grey_block_2 can't be on the table)
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from yellow_block_1
4. Stack brown_block_1 on grey_block_2 to keep the constraint that it can't be on the table
5. Pickup yellow_block_1
6. Putdown yellow_block_1 (or we can stack it somewhere, but we just need to ensure it's off the table at some point)

Now, with yellow_block_1 having been off the table, we can make black_block_1 clear and proceed with our goal:

7. Unstack grey_block_2 from red_block_1
8. Stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_1 (we need to keep grey_block_2 off the table)
9. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1
10. We now have grey_block_1 in our hand, which is our goal.

But wait, I'm overlooking constraints 2 and 3.

Constraint 2 says that there is a block on top of yellow_block_1 at some state. This is already satisfied at the initial state.

Constraint 3 says that if yellow_block_1 is not clear, then black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 or we are holding black_block_1 at this state or a later state.

So, after I ensure yellow_block_1 is not clear (which is the case in the initial state with brown_block_1 on top), I need to ensure that black_block_1 is either on top of brown_block_1 or in my hand.

This becomes tricky because black_block_1 is beneath grey_block_1, which is beneath grey_block_2. I'd need to reorganize quite a bit.

Let's reconsider the approach. I need to ensure the following:
1. yellow_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_1 is clear at some state before making black_block_1 clear.
2. After ensuring yellow_block_1 is not clear, I need to make sure black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 or I'm holding black_block_1.
3. grey_block_2 is not on the table at any state.
4. I end up holding grey_block_1.

Let's consider another approach:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1
2. Stack grey_block_2 on red_block_1 (to keep it off the table)
3. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1

Now black_block_1 is clear. For constraint 5, we need to ensure that yellow_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_1 is clear at an earlier state.

So, let's change the approach once more and make sure one of these conditions is satisfied first:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1
2. Stack grey_block_2 on red_block_1 (to keep it off the table)
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from yellow_block_1
4. Stack brown_block_1 on grey_block_2
5. Pickup yellow_block_1

Now, we've ensured that yellow_block_1 is not on the table. So, we can proceed with making black_block_1 clear:

6. Putdown yellow_block_1 (back on the table)
7. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1

At this point, Black_block_1 is clear. But to satisfy constraint 3, we need to place black_block_1 on top of brown_block_1 or hold it.

8. Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1
9. Stack black_block_1 on yellow_block_1

This also satisfies constraint 2, ensuring that yellow_block_1 is not clear at some point.

10. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_2
11. Stack brown_block_1 on black_block_1

Now, to satisfy constraint 3, since yellow_block_1 is not clear, we need to make sure black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 or we're holding black_block_1.

But we've just placed brown_block_1 on top of black_block_1, which is the opposite of what we need. Let me reconsider.

Actually, constraint 3 is a bit tricky. It says if yellow_block_1 is not clear at some state, then at that same state or a later state, black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 or we're holding black_block_1.

So, if we reapproach this:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1
2. Stack grey_block_2 on red_block_1 (to keep it off the table)
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from yellow_block_1
4. Stack brown_block_1 on grey_block_2 (to satisfy constraint 3 for the initial state, since brown_block_1 was on top of yellow_block_1)
5. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1

At this point, black_block_1 is clear. To satisfy constraint 5, we need to ensure that yellow_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_1 is clear at an earlier state. Since brown_block_1 is no longer on yellow_block_1, we should ensure one of these conditions.

6. Pickup yellow_block_1 (to ensure it's not on the table)
7. Stack yellow_block_1 on blue_block_1 (this might change the stacking but it's to ensure we maintain the constraints)

Now, let's continue with black_block_1:

8. Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1
9. Stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 3 for the state where yellow_block_1 is not clear)

And finally, we can pick up grey_block_1:

10. Pickup grey_block_1

This is our goal.

But wait, there's an error in the above plan. In step 5, we would need to have black_block_1 clear to unstack grey_block_1, which we haven't ensured yet. Let me redo this.

Wait, there's an additional complexity. In step 7, when we place yellow_block_1 on blue_block_1, blue_block_1 becomes not clear. This would mean that we'd need to unstack yellow_block_1 before we can unstack black_block_1. However, if we unstack yellow_block_1, we might break constraint 2. Let me reapproach this.

Ok actually let me check consistency of the planning up to each step to ensure I'm not missing anything:

Original state:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is clear
- brown_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Step 1: Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1
Preconditions: grey_block_2 is clear, grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1, you are not holding any block
Effects: grey_block_2 is not on top of grey_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear, you are holding grey_block_2

After step 1:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is clear (now)
- brown_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- red_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is clear
- you are holding grey_block_2

Step 2: Stack grey_block_2 on red_block_1
Preconditions: you are holding grey_block_2, red_block_1 is clear
Effects: grey_block_2 is on top of red_block_1, grey_block_2 is clear, red_block_1 is not clear, you are not holding any block

After step 2:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is clear
- brown_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- grey_block_2 is clear
- brown_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Step 3: Unstack brown_block_1 from yellow_block_1
Preconditions: brown_block_1 is clear, brown_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, you are not holding any block
Effects: brown_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1, yellow_block_1 is clear, you are holding brown_block_1

After step 3:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is clear
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- grey_block_2 is clear
- you are holding brown_block_1

Step 4: Stack brown_block_1 on grey_block_2
Preconditions: you are holding brown_block_1, grey_block_2 is clear
Effects: brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2, brown_block_1 is clear, grey_block_2 is not clear, you are not holding any block

After step 4:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is clear
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
- brown_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Step 5: Pickup yellow_block_1
Preconditions: yellow_block_1 is clear, yellow_block_1 is on the table, you are not holding any block
Effects: you are holding yellow_block_1, yellow_block_1 is not on the table

After step 5:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- grey_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
- brown_block_1 is clear
- you are holding yellow_block_1

Alright, at this point, constraint 5 is satisfied: yellow_block_1 is not on the table for step 5. So when we eventually make black_block_1 clear, constraint 5 will be satisfied.

Step 6: Stack yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1
Preconditions: you are holding yellow_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear
Effects: yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1, yellow_block_1 is clear, brown_block_1 is not clear, you are not holding any block

After step 6:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- grey_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
- yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

At this point, we need to proceed to make black_block_1 clear, which requires unstacking grey_block_1 from black_block_1:

Step 7: Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1
Preconditions: grey_block_1 is clear, grey_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, you are not holding any block
Effects: grey_block_1 is not on top of black_block_1, black_block_1 is clear, you are holding grey_block_1

After step 7:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- black_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
- yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- you are holding grey_block_1

At this point, we've achieved our goal of holding grey_block_1 and we've satisfied all the constraints:

Constraint 1: grey_block_2 is not on the table - Grey_block_2 is on top of red_block_1 throughout the entire plan.
Constraint 2: There is a block on top of yellow_block_1 at some state - This was satisfied in the initial state with brown_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1.
Constraint 3: If yellow_block_1 is not clear, then black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 or we are holding black_block_1 - This was the case in the initial state, where yellow_block_1 was not clear due to brown_block_1 on top of it. We'd need to ensure that black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 or we're holding black_block_1 at this state or a later state. But there isn't a way to place black_block_1 on top of brown_block_1 from the initial configuration without breaking other constraints.

Oh wait, there's a misunderstanding on my part for constraint 3. It's a temporal constraint: if at some state s, yellow_block_1 is not clear, then at state s or at a later state, black_block_1 should be on top of brown_block_1 or we should be holding black_block_1.

In the initial state (let's call it state 0), yellow_block_1 is not clear because brown_block_1 is on top of it. So, according to constraint 3, either at state 0 or a later state, black_block_1 should be on top of brown_block_1 or we should be holding black_block_1.

Let's adjust our plan to ensure this constraint is met:

After making black_block_1 clear (step 7 above), we can continue with:

Step 8: Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1
Preconditions: black_block_1 is clear, black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1, you are not holding any block
Effects: black_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1, blue_block_1 is clear, you are holding black_block_1

But this means we're no longer holding grey_block_1, which is our ultimate goal. So, let's try a slightly different approach.

Step 7: Stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_1
Preconditions: you are holding grey_block_1, yellow_block_1 is clear
Effects: grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear, yellow_block_1 is not clear, you are not holding any block

After step 7:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- black_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
- yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- grey_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Step 8: Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1
Preconditions: black_block_1 is clear, black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1, you are not holding any block
Effects: black_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1, blue_block_1 is clear, you are holding black_block_1

After step 8:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
- yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- grey_block_1 is clear
- you are holding black_block_1

At this point, constraint 3 is satisfied for state 0: yellow_block_1 was not clear in state 0, and now in a later state, we are holding black_block_1.

Step 9: Stack black_block_1 on grey_block_1
Preconditions: you are holding black_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear
Effects: black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1, black_block_1 is clear, grey_block_1 is not clear, you are not holding any block

After step 9:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
- yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- black_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Step 10: Unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_1
Preconditions: black_block_1 is clear, black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1, you are not holding any block
Effects: black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear, you are holding black_block_1

After step 10:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
- yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- grey_block_1 is clear
- you are holding black_block_1

Step 11: Stack black_block_1 on blue_block_1
Preconditions: you are holding black_block_1, blue_block_1 is clear
Effects: black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1, black_block_1 is clear, blue_block_1 is not clear, you are not holding any block

After step 11:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- black_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
- yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- grey_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Step 12: Unstack grey_block_1 from yellow_block_1
Preconditions: grey_block_1 is clear, grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, you are not holding any block
Effects: grey_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1, yellow_block_1 is clear, you are holding grey_block_1

After step 12:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- black_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
- yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- you are holding grey_block_1

And with step 12, we've achieved our goal of holding grey_block_1. Let's check if all constraints are satisfied:

Constraint 1: grey_block_2 is not on the table - Grey_block_2 is on top of red_block_1 throughout the entire plan.
Constraint 2: There is a block on top of yellow_block_1 at some state - This was satisfied in the initial state with brown_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1, and later with grey_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1.
Constraint 3: If yellow_block_1 is not clear, then black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 or we are holding black_block_1 - In the initial state, yellow_block_1 was not clear due to brown_block_1 on top of it, and later on, we are holding black_block_1, which satisfies the constraint.
Constraint 4: black_block_1 is clear at some state - This was satisfied after step 7.
Constraint 5: If black_block_1 is clear, then there must be an earlier state where yellow_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_1 is clear - This was satisfied in step 5 where yellow_block_1 was off the table.

Hmm, I actually made an error above. When we unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1, we're already holding grey_block_1, so we can directly achieve our goal. Let me revise the approach.

Approach 1:
1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1
2. Stack grey_block_2 on red_block_1 (to keep it off the table)
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (to prepare for making yellow_block_1 not on the table)
4. Stack brown_block_1 on grey_block_2
5. Pickup yellow_block_1 (to ensure it's not on the table, satisfying constraint 5)
6. Putdown yellow_block_1 (back on the table)
7. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1 (making black_block_1 clear and holding grey_block_1)

This approach satisfies all constraints:
- grey_block_2 is not on the table (constraint 1)
- Yellow_block_1 is not clear in the initial state, thus constraint 2 is satisfied.
- Constraint 3 is tricky: yellow_block_1 is not clear in the initial state, so we'd need to ensure that black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 or we're holding black_block_1 at this state or a later state.

Wait, let's clarify state 0 (the initial state):
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is clear
- brown_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

In state 0, yellow_block_1 is not clear because brown_block_1 is on top of it. So, constraint 3 implies that in state 0 or a later state, black_block_1 should be on top of brown_block_1 or we should be holding black_block_1.

In our plan so far, after step 7, black_block_1 is clear but not on top of brown_block_1, and we're not holding black_block_1; instead, we're holding grey_block_1. Therefore the constraint is not met. Let's revise it: 

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1
2. Stack grey_block_2 on red_block_1 (to keep it off the table)
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (to prepare for making yellow_block_1 not on the table)
4. Stack brown_block_1 on grey_block_2
5. Pickup yellow_block_1 (to ensure it's not on the table, satisfying constraint 5)
6. Putdown yellow_block_1 (back on the table)
7. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1 (making black_block_1 clear and holding grey_block_1)
8. Putdown grey_block_1 (temporarily)
9. Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1
10. Stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1 (satisfying constraint 3)
11. Pickup grey_block_1

But wait, there's an issue with step 8. After unstacking grey_block_1 from black_block_1, we're holding grey_block_1. If we putdown grey_block_1, we'd need to pick it up again, which would be our goal. But once we've achieved the goal, we should stop. So this doesn't work, and I need to retry.

Alright, let's consider a different approach:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1
2. Stack grey_block_2 on red_block_1 (to keep it off the table)
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from yellow_block_1
4. Stack brown_block_1 on blue_block_1 (to make brown_block_1 available for black_block_1 to be stacked on)
5. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1 (making black_block_1 clear, and holding grey_block_1)
6. Putdown grey_block_1 (temporarily)
7. Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1
8. Stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1 (satisfying constraint 3)
9. Pickup grey_block_1 (achieving our goal)

But again, I have the same issue with step 6. Once we've achieved the goal of holding grey_block_1, we should stop. We're not trying to complete a specific block configuration; we're just trying to get to the state where we're holding grey_block_1.

Hmm, yeah this seems a bit tricky. Let me read the constraints again just to make sure I'm understsanding them correctly:

1. grey_block_2 is not on the table - This is straightforward; grey_block_2 should never be on the table.
2. There is a block on top of yellow_block_1 at some state - Yellow_block_1 should not be clear at some state, which is already satisfied in the initial state.
3. If yellow_block_1 is not clear, then black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 or we are holding black_block_1 - This says that if yellow_block_1 has a block on top of it, then black_block_1 should be on top of brown_block_1 or we should be holding black_block_1.
4. black_block_1 is clear at some state - There should be a state where no block is on top of black_block_1.
5. If black_block_1 is clear, then there must be an earlier state where yellow_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_1 is clear - This says that before we make black_block_1 clear, we need to ensure that yellow_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_1 is clear.

Constraint 3 poses a challenge. At the initial state, yellow_block_1 is not clear because brown_block_1 is on top of it. So, according to the constraint, in the initial state or a later state, black_block_1 should be on top of brown_block_1 or we should be holding black_block_1. Given that we need to end up holding grey_block_1, we need to find a way to also satisfy this constraint.

Actually, I think I was misinterpreting constraint 3. It doesn't say that every state after yellow_block_1 is not clear should have black_block_1 on top of brown_block_1 or we're holding black_block_1. It says that at the state where yellow_block_1 is not clear, or at some later state, black_block_1 should be on top of brown_block_1 or we're holding black_block_1. So, it's more of a "at least once" condition.

This may still be challenging because, to hold grey_block_1, we need to unstack it from black_block_1. And to do that, black_block_1 would need to have grey_block_1 on top of it, which means black_block_1 would not be on top of brown_block_1 and we wouldn't be holding black_block_1 either.

But we can satisfy constraint 3 in a different way. Let's try a new approach:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1
2. Stack grey_block_2 on red_block_1 (to keep it off the table)
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from yellow_block_1
4. Stack brown_block_1 on grey_block_2 (to free up yellow_block_1)
5. Pickup yellow_block_1 (to ensure it's not on the table, satisfying constraint 5)
6. Stack yellow_block_1 on blue_block_1 (positioning it)
7. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1 (making black_block_1 clear, and holding grey_block_1)

At this point, we've achieved our goal of holding grey_block_1. Let's check if all constraints are satisfied:

Constraint 1: grey_block_2 is not on the table - Grey_block_2 is on top of red_block_1 throughout the plan.
Constraint 2: There is a block on top of yellow_block_1 at some state - This was satisfied in the initial state with brown_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1.
Constraint 3: If yellow_block_1 is not clear, then black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 or we are holding black_block_1 - Yellow_block_1 is not clear in the initial state due to brown_block_1 on top of it. So, at the initial state or a later state, black_block_1 should be on top of brown_block_1 or we should be holding black_block_1.

But after step 6, yellow_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1, and black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1, and we're not holding black_block_1. So, constraint 3 is not satisfied.

Let's address this by adding a step:

8. Put down grey_block_1 (temporarily)
9. Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1
10. Stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1 (satisfying constraint 3)
11. Pickup grey_block_1 (our goal)

But again, I have the issue with steps 8, 9, 10 and 11. Once I've achieved the goal of holding grey_block_1 after step 7, I should stop. I'm not supposed to perform additional steps to achieve a more general goal. So I need to find a way to achive the goal while respecting the constraints across the steps that I need to perform.

Wait actually, I think I'm not interpreting constraint 3 quite correctly. it says "If expression "there is a block on top of yellow_block_1, i.e., yellow_block_1 is not clear" holds in some state s, then expression "At least one of the following conditions is true: "black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1", "you are holding black_block_1"" must hold at s or at some state after s."

That means, if yellow_block_1 is not clear (i.e., there's a block on top of it) at some state, then at that state or a later state, black_block_1 should be on top of brown_block_1 or we should be holding black_block_1.

In the initial state, yellow_block_1 is not clear. So, at the initial state or a later state, black_block_1 should be on top of brown_block_1 or we should be holding black_block_1.

Following the approach outlined above:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1
2. Stack grey_block_2 on red_block_1
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from yellow_block_1
4. Stack brown_block_1 on grey_block_2
5. Pickup yellow_block_1
6. Stack yellow_block_1 on blue_block_1
7. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1 (at which point we're holding grey_block_1, which is our goal)

If I think about it step-by-step again, then after step 1, I have grey_block_2 in my hand. After step 2, I place grey_block_2 on red_block_1. After step 3, I have brown_block_1 in my hand. After step 4, I place brown_block_1 on grey_block_2. After step 5, I have yellow_block_1 in my hand. After step 6, I place yellow_block_1 on blue_block_1. After step 7, I unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1, so I have grey_block_1 in my hand, which is my goal.

So, the plan here is:
1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1 (now grey_block_1 is clear)
2. Stack grey_block_2 on red_block_1 (to keep it off the table)
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (this makes yellow_block_1 clear)
4. Stack brown_block_1 on grey_block_2 (to free up yellow_block_1)
5. Pickup yellow_block_1 (to ensure it's not on the table, satisfying constraint 5)
6. Stack yellow_block_1 on blue_block_1 (to hold yellow_block_1 somewhere, since it cannot be 'held' infinitely)
7. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1 (making black_block_1 clear, and holding grey_block_1, which is our goal)

Let's manually trace the state after each step to ensure I'm not missing anything:

Initial State:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is clear
- brown_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Step 1: Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1
Preconditions: grey_block_2 is clear, grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1, you are not holding any block
Effects: grey_block_2 is not on top of grey_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear, you are holding grey_block_2

After step 1:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- grey_block_1 is clear
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- red_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is clear
- you are holding grey_block_2

Step 2: Stack grey_block_2 on red_block_1
Preconditions: you are holding grey_block_2, red_block_1 is clear
Effects: grey_block_2 is on top of red_block_1, grey_block_2 is clear, red_block_1 is not clear, you are not holding any block

After step 2:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- grey_block_1 is clear
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- grey_block_2 is clear
- brown_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Step 3: Unstack brown_block_1 from yellow_block_1
Preconditions: brown_block_1 is clear, brown_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1, you are not holding any block
Effects: brown_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1, yellow_block_1 is clear, you are holding brown_block_1

After step 3:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- grey_block_1 is clear
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- grey_block_2 is clear
- you are holding brown_block_1

Step 4: Stack brown_block_1 on grey_block_2
Preconditions: you are holding brown_block_1, grey_block_2 is clear
Effects: brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2, brown_block_1 is clear, grey_block_2 is not clear, you are not holding any block

After step 4:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- grey_block_1 is clear
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
- brown_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Step 5: Pickup yellow_block_1
Preconditions: yellow_block_1 is clear, yellow_block_1 is on the table, you are not holding any block
Effects: you are holding yellow_block_1, yellow_block_1 is not on the table

After step 5:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- grey_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
- brown_block_1 is clear
- you are holding yellow_block_1

Step 6: Stack yellow_block_1 on blue_block_1
Wait this doesn't work, blue_block_1 has black_block_1 on top of it, so blue_block_1 is not clear. OK so I can't put yellow_block_1 on blue_block_1 at this point.

Let's adjust step 6:

Step 6: Stack yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1
Preconditions: you are holding yellow_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear
Effects: yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1, yellow_block_1 is clear, brown_block_1 is not clear, you are not holding any block

After step 6:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- grey_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
- yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Step 7: Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1
Preconditions: grey_block_1 is clear, grey_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, you are not holding any block
Effects: grey_block_1 is not on top of black_block_1, black_block_1 is clear, you are holding grey_block_1

After step 7:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- black_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
- yellow_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- you are holding grey_block_1

At this point, we've achieved our goal of holding grey_block_1. Let's check if all constraints are satisfied:

Constraint 1: grey_block_2 is not on the table - Grey_block_2 is on top of red_block_1 throughout the plan.
Constraint 2: There is a block on top of yellow_block_1 at some state - This was satisfied in the initial state with brown_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1.
Constraint 3: If yellow_block_1 is not clear, then black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 or we are holding black_block_1 - Yellow_block_1 is not clear in the initial state due to brown_block_1 on top of it. So, at the initial state or a later state, black_block_1 should be on top of brown_block_1 or we should be holding black_block_1. But this is not satisfied in our plan.
Constraint 4: black_block_1 is clear at some state - This is satisfied in the final state.
Constraint 5: If black_block_1 is clear, then there must be an earlier state where yellow_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_1 is clear - This is satisfied because, in step 5, yellow_block_1 is not on the table.

Alright, so constraint 3 is still not satisfied. Let's think again:

Yellow_block_1 is not clear in the initial state. So, at the initial state or a later state, black_block_1 should be on top of brown_block_1 or we should be holding black_block_1. Here's the issue: to achieve our goal of holding grey_block_1, we need to unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1. But before we do that, we need to ensure that yellow_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_1 is clear (constraint 5).

One approach is to unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1, which would make blue_block_1 clear. But this would mean we're holding black_block_1, which would satisfy constraint 3. However, we'd need to place black_block_1 somewhere before we can unstack grey_block_1.

Let's adjust our plan:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1
2. Stack grey_block_2 on red_block_1 (to keep it off the table)
3. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1 (making black_block_1 clear)
4. Stack grey_block_1 on brown_block_1 (to temporarily hold grey_block_1 somewhere)
5. Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1 (making blue_block_1 clear, thus satisfying Constraint 5)
6. Stack black_block_1 on grey_block_1 (temporarily)
7. Unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_1 (we're holding black_block_1, which satisfies Constraint 3)
8. Stack black_block_1 on blue_block_1 (back where it was)
9. Unstack grey_block_1 from brown_block_1 (finally, we're holding grey_block_1, which is our goal)

Let me manually trace the plan to ensure I don't miss any precondition:

Initial State:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is clear
- brown_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Wait, there's an error in my planning. In the initial state, grey_block_1 has grey_block_2 on top of it, so grey_block_1 is not clear. I can't unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1 directly. Let me recalibrate:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1
2. Stack grey_block_2 on red_block_1 (to keep it off the table)
3. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1 (making black_block_1 clear and holding grey_block_1)

And that's it. After step 3, we're holding grey_block_1, which is our goal. Let's check if all constraints are satisfied:

Constraint 1: grey_block_2 is not on the table - Grey_block_2 is on top of red_block_1 after step 2.
Constraint 2: There is a block on top of yellow_block_1 at some state - This was satisfied in the initial state with brown_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1.
Constraint 3: If yellow_block_1 is not clear, then black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 or we are holding black_block_1 - Yellow_block_1 is not clear in the initial state due to brown_block_1 on top of it. So, at the initial state or a later state, black_block_1 should be on top of brown_block_1 or we should be holding black_block_1. This isn't satisfied in our plan.
Constraint 4: black_block_1 is clear at some state - This is satisfied in the final state.
Constraint 5: If black_block_1 is clear, then there must be an earlier state where yellow_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_1 is clear - This isn't satisfied in our plan, because before black_block_1 is clear, yellow_block_1 remains on the table and blue_block_1 is not clear.


So, constraints 3 and 5 aren't satisfied. I actually can't satisfy constraint 3 after constraint 5, since once black_block_1 is clear, I'd need to ensure that one of the conditions from constraint 5 is satisfied before that state, but this is impossible from the initial configuration without breaking constraint 3.

Wait, I think I actually misinterpreted constraint 5. Let's reconsider it.
"If expression "there is no block on top of black_block_1, i.e., black_block_1 is clear" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "yellow_block_1 is not on the table", "there is no block on top of blue_block_1, i.e., blue_block_1 is clear""

So, my understanding is that if black_block_1 is clear at some state, then there must be a state earlier in the plan where yellow_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_1 is clear.

OK so I think I can satisfy this by unstacking brown_block_1, picking up yellow_block_1, and placing it back down, all before I make black_block_1 clear.

Now, let's revisit the plan:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1
2. Stack grey_block_2 on red_block_1 (to keep it off the table)
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from yellow_block_1 (to prepare for making yellow_block_1 not on the table)
4. Stack brown_block_1 on grey_block_2 (to clear the way for yellow_block_1)
5. Pickup yellow_block_1 (to ensure it's not on the table, satisfying constraint 5)
6. Putdown yellow_block_1 (back on the table)
7. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1 (making black_block_1 clear and holding grey_block_1)

Now, let's trace through the plan step by step:

Initial State:

Step 5: Pickup yellow_block_1
Preconditions: yellow_block_1 is clear, yellow_block_1 is on the table, you are not holding any block
Effects: you are holding yellow_block_1, yellow_block_1 is not on the table

After step 5:
- blue_block_1 is on the table

Step 7: Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1
Preconditions: grey_block_1 is clear, grey_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, you are not holding any block
Effects: grey_block_1 is not on top of black_block_1, black_block_1 is clear, you are holding grey_block_1

After step 7:

- yellow_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
- brown_block_1 is clear
- you are holding grey_block_1

And now, let's check if all constraints are satisfied:

Constraint 1: grey_block_2 is not on the table - Grey_block_2 is on top of red_block_1 throughout the plan after step 2.
Constraint 2: There is a block on top of yellow_block_1 at some state - This was satisfied in the initial state with brown_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1.
Constraint 3: If yellow_block_1 is not clear, then black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 or we are holding black_block_1 - Yellow_block_1 is not clear in the initial state due to brown_block_1 on top of it. So, at the initial state or a later state, black_block_1 should be on top of brown_block_1 or we should be holding black_block_1. This isn't satisfied in our plan.
Constraint 4: black_block_1 is clear at some state - This is satisfied in the final state.
Constraint 5: If black_block_1 is clear, then there must be an earlier state where yellow_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_1 is clear - This is satisfied in step 5, where yellow_block_1 is not on the table.

Constraint 3 is still not satisfied. Let's see if we can adjust the plan to satisfy it. OK the plan so far is fine, but I need to now satisfy constraint 3.

Actually, looking back at the initial state, yellow_block_1 was not clear because brown_block_1 was on top of it. So, constraint 3 requires that at this state or a later state, black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 or we're holding black_block_1.

In our plan, after we unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1, we can add the following steps:

8. Putdown grey_block_1 (temporarily)
9. Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1
10. Stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1 (satisfying constraint 3)
11. Pickup grey_block_1 (our goal)

Yes, I know I've previously said that this doesn't work, but I'm now realizing that the goal is for the output to end up with "you are holding grey_block_1", not for the end of the plan to simply be holding grey_block_1. In other words the goal state has to be the last state in the planner, but we're allowed to pick up grey_block_1 and put it down before we pick it up again for the final step.

Let's trace the plan again to ensure it's correct:

Initial State:
(same as before)

Steps 1-7:
(same as before)

After step 7:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- black_block_1 is clear
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
- brown_block_1 is clear
- you are holding grey_block_1

Step 8: Putdown grey_block_1
Preconditions: you are holding grey_block_1
Effects: grey_block_1 is on the table, grey_block_1 is clear, you are not holding any block

After step 8:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- black_block_1 is clear
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
- brown_block_1 is clear
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Step 9: Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1
Preconditions: black_block_1 is clear, black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1, you are not holding any block
Effects: black_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1, blue_block_1 is clear, you are holding black_block_1

After step 9:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is clear
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
- brown_block_1 is clear
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is clear
- you are holding black_block_1

Wait, brown_block_1 is already on top of grey_block_2 after step 4. I think I need to revise the later steps.

Actually, constraint 3 is about brown_block_1 and black_block_1. I need to pay attention to the logical relationship.

Let me revisit constraint 3: "If yellow_block_1 is not clear, then black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 or we are holding black_block_1."

In the initial state (state 0), yellow_block_1 is not clear. So, at state 0 or a later state, black_block_1 should be on top of brown_block_1 or we should be holding black_block_1.

But wait. If I try to place black_block_1 on top of brown_block_1 now, that would mean brown_block_1 would end up under black_block_1, which would mean black_block_1 would be on top of brown_block_1, not the other way around, which is what was requested?

No no wait, constraint 3 indeed states that black_block_1 should be on top of brown_block_1 (or we're holding black_block_1). So, I'm correct in trying to place black_block_1 on top of brown_block_1.

Let's continue from step a simplified step 9:

Step 9: Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1
Preconditions: black_block_1 is clear, black_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1, you are not holding any block
Effects: black_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1, blue_block_1 is clear, you are holding black_block_1

After step 9:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is clear
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
- brown_block_1 is clear
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is clear
- you are holding black_block_1

OK so far so good. Now we're holding black_block_1.

Step 10: Stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1
Preconditions: you are holding black_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear
Effects: black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1, black_block_1 is clear, brown_block_1 is not clear, you are not holding any block

After step 10:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is clear
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
- black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
- black_block_1 is clear
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is clear
- you are not holding any block

Step 11: Pickup grey_block_1
Preconditions: grey_block_1 is clear, grey_block_1 is on the table, you are not holding any block
Effects: you are holding grey_block_1, grey_block_1 is not on the table

After step 11:
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is clear
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
- black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
- black_block_1 is clear
- you are holding grey_block_1

And now, let's check if all constraints are satisfied:

Constraint 1: grey_block_2 is not on the table - Grey_block_2 is on top of red_block_1 throughout the plan after step 2.
Constraint 2: There is a block on top of yellow_block_1 at some state - This was satisfied in the initial state with brown_block_1 on top of yellow_block_1.
Constraint 3: If yellow_block_1 is not clear, then black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 or we are holding black_block_1 - Yellow_block_1 is not clear in the initial state due to brown_block_1 on top of it. In step 9 we are holding black_block_1, which in turn satisfies this constraint.
Constraint 4: black_block_1 is clear at some state - This is satisfied in several states (after step 7, 9 and at the end).
Constraint 5: If black_block_1 is clear, then there must be an earlier state where yellow_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_1 is clear - This is satisfied in step 5, where yellow_block_1 is not on the table.

Great, this plan satisfies all the constraints. Let me summarize the plan once more, just to get it all together:

First let's state the goal one more time: We want to end up holding grey_block_1.
1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1
2. Stack grey_block_2 on red_block_1
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from yellow_block_1
4. Stack brown_block_1 on grey_block_2
5. Pickup yellow_block_1
6. Putdown yellow_block_1
7. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1
8. Putdown grey_block_1
9. Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1
10. Stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1
11. Pickup grey_block_1

Now, we have a plan that satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal of holding grey_block_1.
