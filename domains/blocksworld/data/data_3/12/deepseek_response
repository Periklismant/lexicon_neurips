unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
stack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 black_block_1
```
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1**: This action is necessary to clear grey_block_1 so it can be picked up. The constraint that grey_block_2 is never on the table is satisfied since it's moved directly to another block.

2. **Stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_1**: This ensures grey_block_2 remains off the table. This also keeps yellow_block_1 non-clear (via brown_block_1), satisfying the "at least one state has yellow_block_1 not clear" constraint.

3. **Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1**: Achieves the goal of holding grey_block_1. This action makes black_block_1 clear, satisfying the "at least one state has black_block_1 clear" constraint. The fifth constraint is implicitly handled by the initial state’s conditions and the sequence’s logical flow, though this part remains ambiguous in the reasoning.
