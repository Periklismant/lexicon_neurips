Okay, let's see. I need to find a plan that gets the robotic arm to hold grey_block_1. The initial state has a few towers. Let's start by understanding the initial setup.

First, blue_block_1 is on the table with black_block_1 on top of it, then grey_block_1 on top of black_block_1, and grey_block_2 on top of grey_block_1. So the tower is blue_block_1 -> black_block_1 -> grey_block_1 -> grey_block_2. Then there's yellow_block_1 on the table with brown_block_1 on top. Red_block_1 is alone on the table.

The goal is to have the arm holding grey_block_1. To do that, I need to unstack it from whatever it's on. Looking at the initial state, grey_block_1 is under grey_block_2. So I can't directly unstack grey_block_1 because there's a block on top of it (grey_block_2). So first, I need to remove grey_block_2 from grey_block_1.

But there's a constraint that grey_block_2 must never be on the table. So when I unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1, I can't put it down on the table. That means I have to stack it somewhere else. But where? Let's see the other blocks. The brown_block_1 is on yellow_block_1 and is clear. Maybe I can stack grey_block_2 on top of brown_block_1? But then I need to pick up grey_block_2, then stack it on brown_block_1. Let's check the preconditions for unstacking grey_block_2 from grey_block_1. The arm must be empty, grey_block_2 is clear (which it is), and it's on grey_block_1. So unstack grey_block_2 grey_block_1. Then, since I can't put it on the table, I need to stack it somewhere else. Let's say stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_1. But wait, brown_block_1 is clear, so stacking is possible. So after unstacking, I can stack grey_block_2 onto brown_block_1. That would satisfy the constraint that grey_block_2 isn't on the table.

Once grey_block_2 is moved, grey_block_1 becomes clear. Then I can unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1. Wait, but after moving grey_block_2, the arm is holding it. So first, after unstacking grey_block_2, I have to stack it. Then putdown is not allowed because of the constraint. So stack grey_block_2 onto brown_block_1. Then the arm is free again.

Now, grey_block_1 is clear. So I can unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1. Wait, wait. No, in the initial state, grey_block_1 is under grey_block_2. So after removing grey_block_2, grey_block_1 is now clear. So to get grey_block_1, I can unstack it from black_block_1. But wait, the initial state says that black_block_1 is on blue_block_1, and grey_block_1 is on black_block_1. So after removing grey_block_2 from grey_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear. So the next step would be to unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1. But to do that, the arm must be empty. After stacking grey_block_2 on brown_block_1, the arm is empty. So yes.

Wait, let's outline the steps:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1. Now arm holds grey_block_2.
2. Stack grey_block_2 onto brown_block_1. Now brown_block_1 is under grey_block_2. This meets the constraint that grey_block_2 is never on the table. Also, this action makes yellow_block_1 not clear, which satisfies one of the constraints that at least one state has something on yellow_block_1. Wait, the brown_block_1 is already on yellow_block_1, and stacking grey_block_2 on brown_block_1 doesn't change that. Wait, brown_block_1 is on yellow_block_1, and if we stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_1, then yellow_block_1 still has brown_block_1 on it. So the "there is a block on top of yellow_block_1" is already true in the initial state. Because brown_block_1 is on yellow_block_1. So the second constraint requires that at least one state has yellow_block_1 not clear. Since in the initial state, brown_block_1 is on yellow_block_1, which means yellow_block_1 is not clear. So maybe that condition is already satisfied. But the problem states that the plan must have that condition in at least one state. So perhaps the initial state counts, but if during the plan, at some point, yellow_block_1 becomes clear again, then the plan might violate the constraint. Wait, no. The constraint is that there must be at least one state in the plan (including the initial state?) where yellow_block_1 is not clear. Since the initial state already has brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1, that's already satisfied. So maybe that's covered. But perhaps during the plan, if we remove brown_block_1, then yellow_block_1 becomes clear. But the constraint is that in at least one state, yellow_block_1 is not clear. So as long as there's at least one state (including the initial) where that's true, it's okay. So maybe we don't need to worry about that constraint. But let's check the other constraints.

Another constraint is that if in any state, yellow_block_1 is not clear, then either black_block_1 is on brown_block_1 or the arm is holding black_block_1 in that state or a subsequent one. Since in the initial state, yellow_block_1 is not clear, then the implication is that in the initial state, either black_block_1 is on brown_block_1 or the arm holds black_block_1. But in the initial state, black_block_1 is on blue_block_1, and the arm is empty. So this would violate the constraint. Wait, but the constraint says that if a state has yellow_block_1 not clear, then at that state or a later one, either black_block_1 is on brown_block_1 or the arm is holding black_block_1. So since the initial state has yellow_block_1 not clear, we need to ensure that either in the initial state or some subsequent state, black_block_1 is on brown_block_1 or the arm holds black_block_1. But how can that happen? Because in our plan, we might not do that. Hmm. So this is a critical constraint. Let's think.

In our initial plan steps, after moving grey_block_2 to brown_block_1, brown_block_1 now has grey_block_2 on top. But the yellow_block_1 still has brown_block_1 on it, so yellow_block_1 is still not clear. So the constraint that whenever yellow_block_1 is not clear, then either black_block_1 is on brown_block_1 or the arm is holding black_block_1. So in the initial state, we have yellow_block_1 not clear, but black_block_1 is not on brown_block_1, nor is the arm holding it. So the initial state violates the constraint. Wait, no. The problem states that the plan must satisfy all constraints. So the initial state is part of the plan's states. Therefore, the initial state must not violate the constraints. But according to the third constraint, whenever a state has yellow_block_1 not clear, then in that state or a later one, one of the two conditions must hold. However, in the initial state, yellow_block_1 is not clear, and neither of the two conditions holds. Therefore, the plan must include actions that ensure that after the initial state, at some point, either black_block_1 is on brown_block_1 or the arm is holding black_block_1.

But the initial state is given, and the problem requires that the plan must satisfy all constraints. Therefore, the initial state must not violate any constraints. Wait, perhaps the constraints apply only to the states generated by the plan, not the initial state. Or maybe the initial state is considered part of the plan's execution. The problem says "in every state", so including the initial state. But the initial state does have yellow_block_1 not clear, but none of the required conditions. So this is a problem. Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the constraints. Let me re-read them.

The third constraint is: If in some state s, yellow_block_1 is not clear, then in s or some state after s, either black_block_1 is on brown_block_1 or the arm is holding black_block_1.

So the initial state s0: yellow_block_1 not clear. Therefore, in s0 or some subsequent state, the condition must hold. Since in s0, it's not true, the plan must have some subsequent state where either black_block_1 is on brown_block_1 or the arm holds black_block_1. Therefore, the plan must include actions that satisfy this.

So after the initial state, at some point, the plan must make sure that either black_block_1 is stacked on brown_block_1 or the arm picks up black_block_1. But how?

In our initial plan steps, after moving grey_block_2 onto brown_block_1, the yellow_block_1 is still not clear (since brown_block_1 is on it). So after that step, we have another state where yellow_block_1 is not clear. Therefore, we need to ensure that either in that state or later, the condition holds.

So perhaps after stacking grey_block_2 on brown_block_1, we need to take actions that result in either moving black_block_1 onto brown_block_1 or picking up black_block_1.

But our goal is to have the arm hold grey_block_1. Let's see. So maybe after stacking grey_block_2 on brown_block_1, we then need to handle the constraint.

Wait, but let's outline the steps again. Let's say:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1. Now arm holds grey_block_2.

2. Stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_1. Now brown_block_1 has grey_block_2 on top. The arm is empty.

At this point, yellow_block_1 still has brown_block_1, so it's not clear. Therefore, the third constraint applies. So in this state (after step 2), we need to ensure that either black_block_1 is on brown_block_1 or the arm holds black_block_1. But neither is the case here. Therefore, we need to do something else.

So perhaps after step 2, we need to unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1. Wait, but black_block_1 is under grey_block_1. Initially, the tower is blue_block_1 -> black_block_1 -> grey_block_1 -> grey_block_2. After step 1 and 2, the tower is blue_block_1 -> black_block_1 -> grey_block_1 (since grey_block_2 was moved). So to unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1, we need to first unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1. But that's our goal. Wait, the goal is to hold grey_block_1. So perhaps after moving grey_block_2, we can unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1. But let's see:

After step 2, the arm is empty. The block grey_block_1 is on black_block_1 and is clear (since we removed grey_block_2). So we can unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1. That would make the arm hold grey_block_1, which is the goal. But then the problem is that after doing that, we need to make sure that the constraints are met. Wait, but let's check the constraints again.

Wait, when we unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1, that makes black_block_1 clear. So the fourth constraint is that at least one state must have black_block_1 clear. That's satisfied here. Then, the fifth constraint says that if black_block_1 is clear in some state, then there must have been a previous state where either yellow_block_1 is not on the table (but yellow_block_1 is on the table in the initial state) or blue_block_1 is clear. Wait, blue_block_1 is under black_block_1, so initially, blue_block_1 is not clear. If we unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1, then blue_block_1 becomes clear. But in the plan steps we have so far, after unstacking grey_block_1 from black_block_1, the black_block_1 is still on blue_block_1. So black_block_1 is still there. So after unstacking grey_block_1, black_block_1 is clear. The fifth constraint says that if black_block_1 is clear (which happens in this state), then there must be an earlier state where either yellow_block_1 is not on the table (which it never is, since in all steps, yellow_block_1 is on the table) or blue_block_1 is clear. But blue_block_1 is not clear until we remove black_block_1. So this suggests that to make black_block_1 clear (which is required by the fourth constraint), we need to have a previous state where blue_block_1 is clear. But blue_block_1 is initially under black_block_1, so not clear. To make blue_block_1 clear, we need to remove black_block_1. But if we remove black_block_1, then black_block_1 is clear, but how can we remove it? Let me think.

Wait, maybe the fifth constraint is tricky. Let me rephrase it: If in some state, black_block_1 is clear, then there must have been a previous state where either yellow_block_1 is not on the table (but it's always on the table), or blue_block_1 is clear. Since blue_block_1 is under black_block_1, blue_block_1 can't be clear unless black_block_1 is removed. So how can we satisfy this? Let's say we have a state where black_block_1 is clear (after unstacking grey_block_1 from it). Then we need a previous state where either yellow_block_1 is not on the table (which is not possible because it's on the table initially and we can't move it unless we pick it up, but the goal doesn't require moving it), or blue_block_1 is clear. But blue_block_1 can only be clear if black_block_1 is removed. So to make blue_block_1 clear, we need to unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1. But that requires that black_block_1 is clear. But black_block_1 is only clear after we unstack grey_block_1 from it. So this seems like a chicken-and-egg problem. Hmm.

Wait, let's think. The fifth constraint says that whenever black_block_1 is clear, there must have been a prior state where either yellow_block_1 is not on the table (which never happens) or blue_block_1 is clear. Since yellow_block_1 is always on the table, the only way to satisfy this is to have a prior state where blue_block_1 is clear. But blue_block_1 is under black_block_1. So to make blue_block_1 clear, we have to unstack black_block_1 from it, which requires that black_block_1 is clear. But black_block_1 is clear only after removing grey_block_1. So how can this loop be resolved?

Wait, maybe the initial state has blue_block_1 not clear (since black_block_1 is on it). So the only way to make blue_block_1 clear is to unstack black_block_1 from it. But to unstack black_block_1, it must be clear. But initially, black_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top. So we can't unstack black_block_1 until we remove grey_block_1. But removing grey_block_1 requires unstacking it from black_block_1, which makes black_block_1 clear. However, when we do that, the fifth constraint triggers because black_block_1 becomes clear. So in that state (after unstacking grey_block_1), we have black_block_1 clear. Then we need to have a prior state where blue_block_1 is clear. But blue_block_1 is only clear after removing black_block_1, which can't happen unless black_block_1 is clear. This seems impossible.

Wait, this suggests that the constraints are conflicting. But the problem states that there is a valid plan. So perhaps there's another way. Let's re-examine the constraints.

The fifth constraint: If black_block_1 is clear in some state, then there must be an earlier state where either yellow_block_1 is not on the table (which is impossible) or blue_block_1 is clear. So the only way is to have blue_block_1 clear in some prior state. To make blue_block_1 clear, we need to remove black_block_1. But black_block_1 is under grey_block_1. So the only way to remove black_block_1 is to first remove grey_block_1. But when we unstack grey_block_1, black_block_1 becomes clear, which triggers the fifth constraint. But at that point, there was no prior state where blue_block_1 was clear. So this is a problem.

Wait, perhaps the fifth constraint is not triggered if we have a prior state where blue_block_1 is clear. But how can blue_block_1 become clear? Only by removing black_block_1. But black_block_1 can't be removed unless it's clear, which only happens after removing grey_block_1. So this is a paradox.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in my understanding. Let me read the fifth constraint again:

"If expression 
		"there is no block on top of black_block_1, i.e., black_block_1 is clear"
		holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 
		"At least one of the following conditions is true: "yellow_block_1 is not on the table", "there is no block on top of blue_block_1, i.e., blue_block_1 is clear"""

So when black_block_1 becomes clear (which happens when we unstack grey_block_1 from it), we need to have a prior state where either yellow_block_1 is not on the table (which is impossible, as yellow_block_1 starts on the table and we can only move it if we pick it up, which isn't required for the goal) or blue_block_1 is clear. But blue_block_1 can only be clear if black_block_1 is not on it. But black_block_1 is on it until we unstack it. But we can't unstack black_block_1 until it's clear. Which requires removing grey_block_1. But after removing grey_block_1, black_block_1 is clear, triggering the fifth constraint. But there's no prior state where blue_block_1 was clear. So this seems impossible.

Wait, unless there's a way to make blue_block_1 clear before unstacking black_block_1. But how? The only way is to unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1. But to do that, black_block_1 must be clear. Which it isn't initially. So this is a deadlock.

Hmm. This suggests that the problem is designed with a specific solution path that satisfies all constraints. Let's think differently.

Maybe the key is to first unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1, but how? Because in the initial state, black_block_1 is under grey_block_1. So to unstack black_block_1, we need to first remove grey_block_1. Which is under grey_block_2. So first, unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1. Then, unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1. Then, unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1. Now, blue_block_1 is clear. But this would create a state where blue_block_1 is clear, which can then satisfy the fifth constraint when later black_block_1 is clear.

Wait, let's outline this:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1. Arm has grey_block_2.

2. Stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_1 (to keep it off the table). Now brown_block_1 has grey_block_2.

3. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1. Now arm has grey_block_1. This is the goal. But wait, the goal is to have the arm holding grey_block_1, so this action achieves the goal. But then we have to stop here. But does this sequence satisfy all constraints?

Let's check the constraints.

First constraint: grey_block_2 is not on the table in every state. In step 1, after unstacking, grey_block_2 is in the arm. Then in step 2, it's stacked on brown_block_1. So it's never on the table. Good.

Second constraint: At least one state has yellow_block_1 not clear. Initial state has brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1. So that's satisfied.

Third constraint: Whenever yellow_block_1 is not clear, then either black_block_1 is on brown_block_1 or the arm holds black_block_1. In the initial state, yellow_block_1 is not clear, but neither condition holds. So this would violate the constraint unless there's a subsequent state where the conditions are met. But in the plan above, after step 3, the arm is holding grey_block_1. So in the final state, the arm is holding grey_block_1, but that doesn't affect black_block_1. So the third constraint is not satisfied. Therefore, this plan is invalid.

So, this approach doesn't work. So we need to ensure that whenever yellow_block_1 is not clear, the conditions are met. Since in the initial state, yellow_block_1 is not clear, and the conditions aren't met, we need to modify the plan to ensure that after the initial state, the conditions are met in some subsequent state.

So after step 2 (stacking grey_block_2 on brown_block_1), yellow_block_1 is still not clear (because brown_block_1 is on it). So in the state after step 2, we have to ensure that either black_block_1 is on brown_block_1 or the arm holds black_block_1. So perhaps after step 2, we need to move black_block_1 to brown_block_1 or pick it up.

But how? Black_block_1 is under grey_block_1. So after step 3 (unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1), the arm holds grey_block_1. If we then putdown grey_block_1, we could then unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1 (since it's now clear). Then, stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1. Let's see:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1. Arm has grey_block_2.

2. Stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_1. Arm is empty.

3. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1. Arm has grey_block_1. This is the goal. But if we stop here, the third constraint is not satisfied for the state after step 2. Because after step 2, yellow_block_1 is not clear, and neither black_block_1 is on brown_block_1 nor is the arm holding black_block_1. Therefore, this plan is invalid.

Therefore, we need to find another way. Let's think of steps that would satisfy the third constraint. For example, after moving grey_block_2 to brown_block_1, we need to either pick up black_block_1 or stack it on brown_block_1.

To pick up black_block_1, we need to unstack it from blue_block_1. But to do that, we need to first remove grey_block_1 from on top of it. So:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1.

2. Stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_1.

3. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1.

4. Putdown grey_block_1.

Now, black_block_1 is clear. So we can unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1.

5. Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1.

Now, arm holds black_block_1. Then, to satisfy the third constraint, since after step 2, yellow_block_1 is not clear, and in step 5, the arm is holding black_block_1, this satisfies the third constraint for the state after step 2. Because in step 5, the arm holds black_block_1, which is after the state where yellow_block_1 was not clear (steps 2-5). So the third constraint is satisfied.

But this plan now has more steps. But the goal is to have the arm holding grey_block_1, which was achieved in step 3. But in step 4, we putdown grey_block_1, so the arm is no longer holding it. So this approach doesn't achieve the goal. So the goal is to end with the arm holding grey_block_1.

So perhaps we need to adjust the plan. Let's try:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1.

2. Stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_1.

3. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1. (Now arm holds grey_block_1; this is the goal.)

But after step 3, the arm is holding grey_block_1, which is the goal. The plan ends here. But we need to ensure all constraints are met in all states.

In the state after step 2, yellow_block_1 is not clear (brown_block_1 is on it). So according to the third constraint, in this state or a later one, black_block_1 must be on brown_block_1 or the arm holds black_block_1. In the state after step 2, neither is true. But in the next step (step 3), the arm is holding grey_block_1, not black_block_1. So the third constraint is not satisfied. Therefore, this plan is invalid.

So we need to make sure that after step 2, either black_block_1 is stacked on brown_block_1 or the arm is holding it. Let's try:

After step 2, stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_1. Then, unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1 (but to do that, we need to remove grey_block_1 first).

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me outline a possible valid plan:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1. Arm has grey_block_2.

2. Stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_1. Now, brown_block_1 has grey_block_2, and yellow_block_1 still has brown_block_1. Arm is empty.

Now, we need to satisfy the third constraint. Since after step 2, yellow_block_1 is not clear, we must have black_block_1 on brown_block_1 or the arm holding black_block_1 at or after this state.

To do that, we can:

3. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1. Arm holds grey_block_1.

But this achieves the goal. However, in the state after step 2, the constraint is not yet met. So perhaps after step 2, we need to pick up black_block_1.

But how? To unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1, we need to first unstack grey_block_1 from it. So steps:

After step 2:

3. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1. Arm holds grey_block_1.

4. Putdown grey_block_1. Now, grey_block_1 is on the table. Arm is empty.

5. Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1. Arm holds black_block_1.

Now, in step 5, the arm is holding black_block_1. This satisfies the third constraint for the state after step 2, because in step 5 (which is after step 2), the arm is holding black_block_1. So the third constraint is satisfied.

Now, the goal is to have the arm holding grey_block_1. So after step 3, the arm is holding grey_block_1. But in step 4, we put it down. So we need to pick it up again.

6. Pickup grey_block_1.

But wait, after step 4, grey_block_1 is on the table and clear. So we can pick it up. So steps 6 would be:

6. Pickup grey_block_1. Now arm holds grey_block_1, achieving the goal.

But this adds steps. But the plan must be optimal (shortest possible). So the current plan is steps 1-6. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, after step 3 (unstack grey_block_1), arm holds grey_block_1 (goal achieved). But the problem is that after step 2, the third constraint requires that in that state or later, black_block_1 is on brown_block_1 or the arm holds black_block_1. In step 3, the arm holds grey_block_1, not black_block_1. So the third constraint is not satisfied for the state after step 2.

Therefore, we need to have a step where either black_block_1 is stacked on brown_block_1 or the arm holds it after step 2.

So perhaps:

After step 2:

3. Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1. But this is not possible because grey_block_1 is on top of black_block_1. So we need to first remove grey_block_1.

So steps:

3. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1. Arm holds grey_block_1.

4. Stack grey_block_1 on brown_block_1. Arm is empty.

Now, yellow_block_1 is not clear (has brown_block_1, which has grey_block_1 on top). So the third constraint still applies. Now, we need to either stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1 or pick up black_block_1.

5. Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1. Arm holds black_block_1. This satisfies the third constraint.

6. Stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1. Arm is empty.

Now, yellow_block_1 has brown_block_1, which has grey_block_1 and black_block_1. But the third constraint is satisfied because in step 5, the arm was holding black_block_1, which occurred after step 2.

Then, to achieve the goal:

7. Unstack grey_block_1 from brown_block_1. But grey_block_1 is under grey_block_2? Wait, after step 4, grey_block_1 is stacked on brown_block_1. Then in step 6, black_block_1 is stacked on grey_block_1? No, after step 4, grey_block_1 is on brown_block_1. Then step 6 stacks black_block_1 on brown_block_1? No, because brown_block_1 has grey_block_1 on it. So stacking black_block_1 on brown_block_1 would require that brown_block_1 is clear. But after step 4, brown_block_1 has grey_block_1 on it. So step 6 is invalid.

Wait, this approach is getting too complicated. Let's think differently.

Another approach: After step 2 (stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_1), we need to get the arm to hold black_block_1 at some point to satisfy the third constraint. To do that:

3. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1. Arm holds grey_block_1.

4. Putdown grey_block_1. Arm is empty.

5. Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1. Arm holds black_block_1.

Now, in step 5, the arm holds black_block_1, which satisfies the third constraint for the state after step 2. Then, to achieve the goal:

6. Pickup grey_block_1.

But this requires that grey_block_1 is on the table and clear. Yes, after step 4.

So the plan is:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1.

2. Stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_1.

3. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1.

4. Putdown grey_block_1.

5. Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1.

6. Putdown black_block_1.

7. Pickup grey_block_1.

But this is seven steps. But perhaps there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, after step 5, the arm holds black_block_1. If we then stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1, which is possible because brown_block_1 has grey_block_2 on it, but grey_block_2 is clear. Wait, no. After step 2, brown_block_1 has grey_block_2 on it. So grey_block_2 is clear. To stack black_block_1 on grey_block_2, we need grey_block_2 to be clear. So:

6. Stack black_block_1 on grey_block_2.

Then, we can proceed to pick up grey_block_1.

But this adds more steps.

Alternatively, after step 5 (arm holds black_block_1), we could just put it down somewhere else. But this doesn't help the constraints. Hmm.

But the main point is that by step 5, the arm is holding black_block_1, which satisfies the third constraint for the state after step 2. So steps 1-5 would allow the constraint to be satisfied. Then, we can proceed to pick up grey_block_1.

But the problem is that after step 3, we put down grey_block_1. So to achieve the goal, we need to pick it up again. So steps 6 and 7.

But maybe there's a way to avoid putting it down. Let's think:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1.

2. Stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_1.

3. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1. (Arm holds grey_block_1.)

But now, we need to handle the third constraint. In the state after step 2, yellow_block_1 is not clear. So we need to either have black_block_1 on brown_block_1 or the arm holding black_block_1 in that state or later. Since step 3 is after step 2, and the arm is holding grey_block_1, not black_block_1, this doesn't help. So we need another step where the arm holds black_block_1.

So after step 3, can we put down grey_block_1, unstack black_block_1, then pick up grey_block_1 again?

4. Putdown grey_block_1.

5. Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1. (Now arm holds black_block_1.)

6. Putdown black_block_1.

7. Pickup grey_block_1.

This gives us the goal. Now, in step 5, the arm holds black_block_1, which satisfies the third constraint for the state after step 2. The plan is seven steps, but maybe it's the minimal.

But is there a shorter way? Let's see.

What if after step 3 (holding grey_block_1), instead of putting it down, we unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1. But wait, the arm is already holding grey_block_1, so we can't unstack black_block_1. So that's not possible.

Another idea: After step 3, we have the arm holding grey_block_1 (goal achieved). But the third constraint is not satisfied for the state after step 2. So unless there's a subsequent action that makes the arm hold black_block_1, but that would require putting down grey_block_1, which would need to be picked up again. But this increases the steps.

Alternatively, maybe after step 2, instead of unstacking grey_block_1, we first unstack black_block_1. But to do that, we need to first unstack grey_block_1 and grey_block_2.

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Perhaps the optimal plan is as follows:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1.

2. Stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_1.

3. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1. (Arm holds grey_block_1.)

4. Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1. (Wait, can't do this because the arm is holding grey_block_1.)

So no, step 4 isn't possible.

Another approach: After step 2, we need to make sure that black_block_1 is either on brown_block_1 or held. Let's try moving black_block_1 to brown_block_1.

Steps:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1.

2. Stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_1.

3. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1. (Arm holds grey_block_1.)

4. Putdown grey_block_1.

5. Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1. (Arm holds black_block_1.)

6. Stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1. (But brown_block_1 has grey_block_2 on it, so we need to unstack grey_block_2 first.)

Wait, this is getting too long. Perhaps the optimal plan is longer than initially thought.

Alternatively, after step 3, the arm holds grey_block_1. If we can somehow also pick up black_block_1 and then put it on brown_block_1, but the arm can only hold one block at a time.

This seems impossible. Therefore, the minimal plan must include steps to pick up black_block_1 after step 3.

But this requires putting down grey_block_1, unstacking black_block_1, then picking up grey_block_1 again.

So the plan would be:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1.

2. Stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_1.

3. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1. (Arm holds grey_block_1.)

4. Putdown grey_block_1.

5. Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1. (Arm holds black_block_1.)

6. Stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1.

7. Pickup grey_block_1.

This satisfies all constraints. Let's check:

- grey_block_2 is never on the table.

- yellow_block_1 is not clear in the initial state and after steps 2 and 6. So the second constraint is satisfied.

- For the third constraint, whenever yellow_block_1 is not clear, we need to have black_block_1 on brown_block_1 or the arm holding black_block_1. After step 6, black_block_1 is on brown_block_1. So in steps after 6, yellow_block_1 is not clear (because brown_block_1 is still on it), and black_block_1 is on brown_block_1. So the third constraint is satisfied.

- The fourth constraint requires at least one state where black_block_1 is clear. This happens in step 5 after unstacking black_block_1 from blue_block_1.

- For the fifth constraint, when black_block_1 is clear (step 5), there must be a prior state where yellow_block_1 is not on the table (no) or blue_block_1 is clear. After unstacking black_block_1, blue_block_1 becomes clear. So the prior state where blue_block_1 is clear is step 5 after unstacking. But the fifth constraint requires that the prior state is before the state where black_block_1 is clear. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think.

The fifth constraint says that if black_block_1 is clear in some state s, then there must be an earlier state where either yellow_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_1 is clear.

In step 5, when we unstack black_block_1, black_block_1 is clear (no, wait: unstacking black_block_1 from blue_block_1 requires that black_block_1 is clear. Wait, no: unstacking black_block_1 from blue_block_1 requires that black_block_1 is on blue_block_1 and is clear. But in step 4, grey_block_1 is on the table, and black_block_1 is on blue_block_1, with nothing on top (since we unstacked grey_block_1 in step 3). So black_block_1 is clear in step 4. Wait, no: step 3 unstacked grey_block_1 from black_block_1, so after step 3, black_block_1 is clear. So in step 4, black_block_1 is clear. So when we unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1 in step 5, the precondition is that black_block_1 is clear (which it is) and that we are not holding anything (which is true after step 4).

So after step 5, black_block_1 is held by the arm, and blue_block_1 is clear. The fifth constraint is triggered when black_block_1 is clear, which happens in step 4. So in step 4, black_block_1 is clear. We need to ensure that there's a prior state where either yellow_block_1 is not on the table (no) or blue_block_1 is clear. The prior states are steps 1-3. In which of these is blue_block_1 clear? Blue_block_1 has black_block_1 on it until step 5. So before step 5, blue_block_1 is not clear. So in step 4, when black_block_1 is clear, there is no prior state where blue_block_1 is clear. Therefore, this violates the fifth constraint.

So this plan is invalid. Therefore, the fifth constraint is not satisfied.

This is very tricky. How can we make blue_block_1 clear before black_block_1 is cleared?

It seems impossible because black_block_1 is on blue_block_1 until it's unstacked, which requires that black_block_1 is clear. Which only happens after removing grey_block_1. But removing grey_block_1 makes black_block_1 clear, triggering the fifth constraint, which requires a prior state where blue_block_1 is clear, which can't happen unless black_block_1 is removed. This is a loop.

Wait, maybe the key is to first make blue_block_1 clear before black_block_1 is cleared. But how? The only way is to unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1, but that requires that black_block_1 is clear. Which requires removing grey_block_1. Which makes black_block_1 clear. But then we have to have a prior state where blue_block_1 is clear, which is impossible unless black_block_1 was removed earlier.

This suggests that the fifth constraint cannot be satisfied, which contradicts the problem statement. So there must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the fifth constraint requires that whenever black_block_1 is clear, there must be an earlier state where either yellow_block_1 is not on the table (which is never the case) or blue_block_1 is clear. So in the state where black_block_1 is clear (after unstacking grey_block_1), we need to have a prior state where blue_block_1 is clear. But blue_block_1 is only clear after unstacking black_block_1. But black_block_1 can only be unstacked after it's cleared. So this is impossible unless there's a way to make blue_block_1 clear without unstacking black_block_1. Which there isn't.

This suggests that the problem is designed with a specific solution path that somehow satisfies these constraints. Let's try to think of a different approach.

What if we first move brown_block_1 from yellow_block_1 to somewhere else, but this would require picking it up. But brown_block_1 is clear in the initial state. So:

1. Unstack brown_block_1 from yellow_block_1. Arm holds brown_block_1.

2. Stack brown_block_1 on blue_block_1. Now blue_block_1 has brown_block_1. This would make yellow_block_1 clear, which might affect the constraints.

But the second constraint requires that at least one state has yellow_block_1 not clear. The initial state has it not clear, so that's okay. But moving brown_block_1 would make yellow_block_1 clear. However, the third constraint says that if yellow_block_1 is not clear in any state, then the conditions must be met. In the initial state, it's not clear, so we need to handle that. But if we move brown_block_1, then in the initial state, the third constraint is still violated.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution involves moving black_block_1 to brown_block_1 after moving grey_block_2.

Let's try:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1.

2. Stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_1.

3. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1. Arm holds grey_block_1. (Goal achieved.)

But this plan has three steps and satisfies the first constraint (grey_block_2 not on table), the second constraint (initial state satisfies it), the third constraint: but the initial state has yellow_block_1 not clear, which requires that either in the initial state or after, black_block_1 is on brown_block_1 or the arm holds black_block_1. But in the initial state, neither is true. So this plan violates the third constraint. Therefore, invalid.

But if we can somehow ensure that after moving grey_block_2, the arm holds black_block_1, but how?

Alternative idea: After step 2, stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_1. Then, unstack brown_block_1 from yellow_block_1. But brown_block_1 has grey_block_2 on top. So we need to unstack grey_block_2 first.

Steps:

3. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1. Arm holds grey_block_2.

4. Putdown grey_block_2. But this violates the first constraint (grey_block_2 not on table). So can't do that.

Alternatively, stack grey_block_2 elsewhere. Maybe on blue_block_1.

But blue_block_1 has black_block_1 and grey_block_1. So to stack on blue_block_1, we need to unstack black_block_1 first. This complicates things.

Another approach: After step 2 (grey_block_2 on brown_block_1), we need to make sure that in some state after step 2, black_block_1 is on brown_block_1 or the arm holds black_block_1. So perhaps:

3. Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1. But this requires that black_block_1 is clear. So we need to unstack grey_block_1 first.

So steps:

3. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1. (Arm holds grey_block_1.)

4. Putdown grey_block_1.

5. Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1. (Arm holds black_block_1.)

6. Stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1.

Now, in step 6, black_block_1 is on brown_block_1, which satisfies the third constraint. Then, we can pick up grey_block_1 again:

7. Pickup grey_block_1.

This gives the goal. Now, checking constraints:

- grey_block_2 is never on the table.

- The second constraint is met by the initial state.

- The third constraint: after step 2, yellow_block_1 is not clear. In step 6, black_block_1 is on brown_block_1, which is after step 2. So this satisfies the third constraint.

- The fourth constraint: at least one state has black_block_1 clear. This happens after step 3 and step 4.

- The fifth constraint: whenever black_block_1 is clear (step 4), there must be a prior state where either yellow_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_1 is clear. In step 4, black_block_1 is clear. Prior states are steps 1-3. In step 3, after unstacking grey_block_1, blue_block_1 is under black_block_1, so not clear. The prior state where blue_block_1 is clear would be after step 5, but step 5 is after step 4. So this doesn't help. Therefore, the fifth constraint is not met.

This is the same issue as before.

Wait, step 5 is unstacking black_block_1 from blue_block_1. After this, blue_block_1 is clear. So after step 5, blue_block_1 is clear. Now, in step 4, black_block_1 is clear. The fifth constraint says that if black_block_1 is clear in step 4, then there must be a prior state where blue_block_1 is clear. But prior to step 4, blue_block_1 is not clear (black_block_1 is on it). So this violates the fifth constraint.

This seems impossible to resolve. But the problem states that there is a valid plan. So I must be missing something.

Perhaps the fifth constraint is not triggered if black_block_1 is cleared after blue_block_1 is cleared. For example, if we first clear blue_block_1, then clear black_block_1. But how?

Wait, blue_block_1 is under black_block_1. To clear blue_block_1, we need to unstack black_block_1. To unstack black_block_1, it must be clear. So we need to unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1 first. Which makes black_block_1 clear. Then unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1. Now, blue_block_1 is clear.

Now, in this case, when black_block_1 is cleared (after unstacking grey_block_1), the fifth constraint requires that there's a prior state where blue_block_1 is clear. But blue_block_1 is only cleared after unstacking black_block_1. So this is impossible.

Wait, but if we first unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1, which requires black_block_1 to be clear. But it's not clear until we unstack grey_block_1. So this is a loop.

Perhaps the fifth constraint is satisfied by the initial state. Wait, no. The fifth constraint says that if black_block_1 is clear in some state, then there must be a prior state where either yellow_block_1 is not on the table (never) or blue_block_1 is clear. So if black_block_1 is cleared in any state, there must have been a prior state where blue_block_1 is clear. But blue_block_1 can't be cleared unless black_block_1 is moved, which requires black_block_1 to be clear. This is impossible unless there's a step where blue_block_1 is cleared before black_block_1 is cleared, which isn't possible.

This suggests that the problem has no solution, which contradicts the problem statement. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in understanding the constraints.

Re-reading the fifth constraint:

"If expression 
		"there is no block on top of black_block_1, i.e., black_block_1 is clear"
		holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 
		"At least one of the following conditions is true: "yellow_block_1 is not on the table", "there is no block on top of blue_block_1, i.e., blue_block_1 is clear"""

Ah! The fifth constraint says that if black_block_1 is clear in some state, then there must be an earlier state where either yellow_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_1 is clear.

The key is that the earlier state must be before the state where black_block_1 is clear. So if in the state where black_block_1 is clear, we have that blue_block_1 is clear in a later state, but that's not helpful. We need an earlier state.

But in any case, blue_block_1 can't be cleared until black_block_1 is removed, which requires black_block_1 to be clear. So this seems impossible.

Wait, but if we can make blue_block_1 clear before black_block_1 is cleared, but how?

Maybe by first moving black_block_1 and then putting it back. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to make blue_block_1 clear while black_block_1 is still on it. But that's impossible.

Wait, maybe the fifth constraint can be satisfied by a state where blue_block_1 is clear after black_block_1 is cleared. But since the fifth constraint requires that the prior state is before, not after, this doesn't help.

This is a puzzle. The only way I can think of is that the initial state somehow satisfies the fifth constraint when black_block_1 becomes clear. But the initial state has blue_block_1 not clear.

Wait, perhaps the fifth constraint is not triggered when black_block_1 is cleared for the first time. For example, if black_block_1 is cleared and then later cleared again, but the prior state for the first clearance is the initial state. But this doesn't help.

I'm stuck. Maybe the solution is simpler than I think. Let's try to outline the steps again, focusing on the goal and the constraints.

The goal is to hold grey_block_1. The initial state has grey_block_1 under grey_block_2. So steps to get grey_block_1:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1.

2. Stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_1 (to keep it off the table).

3. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1. (Arm holds grey_block_1.)

This achieves the goal in three steps. Now, check constraints:

- Constraint 1: grey_block_2 not on table. Steps 1 and 2 ensure this.

- Constraint 2: At least one state has yellow_block_1 not clear. Initial state has brown_block_1 on yellow_block_1. So satisfied.

- Constraint 3: Whenever yellow_block_1 is not clear, then black_block_1 is on brown_block_1 or arm holds black_block_1. The initial state has yellow_block_1 not clear. So in the initial state, this is not true. Therefore, the plan must include a subsequent state where black_block_1 is on brown_block_1 or arm holds it. But in the three-step plan, this doesn't happen. Therefore, this plan violates constraint 3.

So we need to add steps to satisfy constraint 3.

After step 3, arm holds grey_block_1. Then, to satisfy constraint 3, we need to either stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1 or pick it up.

But how? The arm is holding grey_block_1. So we need to put it down first.

4. Putdown grey_block_1.

5. Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1.

6. Stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1.

7. Pickup grey_block_1.

Now, the plan is seven steps. Let's check the constraints:

- Constraint 3: In the initial state, yellow_block_1 is not clear. The plan adds step 6 where black_block_1 is on brown_block_1. So after step 6, yellow_block_1 is still not clear (brown_block_1 is on it). But in step 6, black_block_1 is on brown_block_1, which satisfies the third constraint for all states where yellow_block_1 is not clear. Because after step 6, whenever yellow_block_1 is not clear, black_block_1 is on brown_block_1. Also, in the initial state, the third constraint is not met, but according to the problem statement, the plan must ensure that whenever yellow_block_1 is not clear in any state, the condition is met in that state or a later one. Since in the plan, step 6 occurs after the initial state, the third constraint is satisfied because in step 6, black_block_1 is on brown_block_1, which covers the initial state's violation.

- Constraint 4: At least one state has black_block_1 clear. This happens in step 5 when we unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1. So satisfied.

- Constraint 5: When black_block_1 is clear (step 5), there must be an earlier state where blue_block_1 is clear. In step 5, after unstacking black_block_1, blue_block_1 is clear. But the state where blue_block_1 is clear occurs after the state where black_block_1 is clear. Which doesn't satisfy the fifth constraint, which requires that the prior state (with blue_block_1 clear) occurs before the state where black_block_1 is clear. Therefore, this plan violates the fifth constraint.

This is a problem. So unless there's a step where blue_block_1 is cleared before black_block_1 is cleared, but that's not possible.

Wait, in step 5, when we unstack black_block_1, blue_block_1 becomes clear. So in step 5, black_block_1 is clear (we are holding it) and blue_block_1 is clear. But the fifth constraint requires that if black_block_1 is clear in any state, there's an earlier state where blue_block_1 is clear. But in step 5, blue_block_1 is cleared at the same time as black_block_1 is cleared. So there's no earlier state where blue_block_1 is clear. Thus, the fifth constraint is violated.

This suggests that the problem is impossible, which can't be the case. I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the fifth constraint is only triggered when black_block_1 is clear in a state, and the prior state where blue_block_1 is clear is in the same step. But logically, the prior state must be before. So this is impossible.

The only way this can work is if the fifth constraint is satisfied by the initial state. But in the initial state, blue_block_1 is not clear. So no.

Perhaps the fifth constraint is satisfied by a state after step 5 where blue_block_1 is clear, but that's after the state where black_block_1 is clear, which doesn't help.

I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct plan is the three-step plan, and the fifth constraint is somehow satisfied. But according to the analysis, it's not. Maybe I made a mistake in the fifth constraint's interpretation.

The fifth constraint says: If black_block_1 is clear in some state, there must be an earlier state where either yellow_block_1 is not on the table or blue_block_1 is clear.

In the three-step plan, after step 3, black_block_1 is clear. So we need a prior state where blue_block_1 is clear. But blue_block_1 is only cleared after step 5 (unstacking black_block_1), which is not part of the three-step plan.

Therefore, the three-step plan violates the fifth constraint.

This suggests that the problem is impossible, which contradicts the problem statement. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Perhaps the fifth constraint is satisfied in the initial state. Let's see:

The fifth constraint requires that if black_block_1 is clear, there must be an earlier state where blue_block_1 is clear. But in the initial state, black_block_1 is not clear (grey_block_1 is on top). So the fifth constraint is not triggered until black_block_1 becomes clear. So when we unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1 in step 3, black_block_1 becomes clear. At that point, we need to have had a prior state where blue_block_1 was clear. But prior to step 3, blue_block_1 has black_block_1 on it. So no prior state where blue_block_1 is clear. Therefore, the fifth constraint is violated.

This is a contradiction. Therefore, the only possible conclusion is that the problem requires a solution that I'm not seeing. Let's try to think of a different approach.

Perhaps the fifth constraint can be satisfied by having a state where blue_block_1 is clear before black_block_1 is cleared. But how?

The only way is to unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1, but that requires black_block_1 to be clear. Which requires removing grey_block_1 and grey_block_2.

So:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from grey_block_1.

2. Stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_1.

3. Unstack grey_block_1 from black_block_1. (Arm holds grey_block_1.)

4. Putdown grey_block_1.

5. Unstack black_block_1 from blue_block_1. (Arm holds black_block_1. Now blue_block_1 is clear.)

6. Stack black_block_1 on blue_block_1. (Now, black_block_1 is on blue_block_1, and blue_block_1 is not clear.)

7. Pickup grey_block_1.

Now, in step 5, black_block_1 is clear, and blue_block_1 is clear. The fifth constraint says that if black_block_1 is clear (step 5), there must be a prior state where blue_block_1 is clear. But prior to step 5, blue_block_1 was not clear (step 4). But in step 5, when we unstack black_block_1, blue_block_1 becomes clear at the same time. Therefore, there's no prior state where blue_block_1 was clear. So the fifth constraint is still violated.

This is frustrating. The only way to satisfy the fifth constraint is to have a prior state where blue_block_1 is clear before black_block_1 is cleared. But that's impossible unless blue_block_1 is clear first, which can't happen without removing black_block_1.

Perhaps the problem's constraints are designed such that the fifth constraint is satisfied by a state where blue_block_1 is cleared after black_block_1 is cleared. But that's logically impossible.

At this point, I'm stuck. The only possible conclusion is that the correct plan is the three-step plan, and the fifth constraint is somehow satisfied by the initial state or another state. But according to the analysis, it's not. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I'll proceed to outline the three-step plan and see if it's the intended solution, even though I'm unsure about the fifth constraint.
