Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld planning problem. Hmm, the initial state and the goal are given, along with some constraints. I need to find an optimal plan that achieves the goal while satisfying all the constraints. Let me start by understanding the initial setup and the desired final state.

First, the initial state:

- white_block_1 is on the table, with purple_block_1 on top of it, and red_block_1 on top of purple_block_1, then orange_block_1 on top of red_block_1. So that's a tower: white1, purple1, red1, orange1.
- white_block_2 is on the table with orange_block_2 on top. So another tower: white2, orange2.
- white_block_3 is alone on the table, clear.
- The arm is empty.

The goal is to have white_block_2 on top of purple_block_1. So in the end, white2 should be on purple1. Let's note that in the initial state, purple1 is on white1. So to get white2 onto purple1, we might need to move purple1 first if it's under other blocks. Wait, purple1 is currently under red1 and orange1. So to make purple1 clear, we need to unstack those blocks above it.

Wait, the current stack is white1 (table), then purple1 on white1, then red1 on purple1, then orange1 on red1. So to get purple1 clear, we need to remove red1 and orange1. But the goal is to place white2 on purple1. So after moving the blocks on top of purple1, we can stack white2 there.

But there's also constraints. Let me look at the constraints:

1. At least one state must have "white_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1". Wait, white1 is on the table initially, so it's not on top of anything. So this condition is already true in the initial state. But maybe after some actions, if white1 is moved on top of orange_block_1, then we need to ensure that in some state it's not. Wait, but the initial state already satisfies this. Wait, no, the initial state has white1 on the table, so it's not on top of orange1. So the first constraint might already be satisfied. But the problem says "must hold in at least one state". So perhaps the initial state counts, but maybe the plan must ensure that at some point, this is true. But if it's already true in the initial state, maybe that's sufficient. However, the second constraint linked to this is: If "white_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1" holds in some state s, then "you are holding purple_block_1" must hold at s or after. So since the initial state has "white_block_1 not on top of orange_block_1", we need that in the initial state or after, the arm is holding purple_block_1. But in the initial state, the arm is empty, so the constraint requires that at some point after the initial state, when this condition is true (which it is in the initial state), the arm must hold purple_block_1 either in that state or later. Wait, the constraint is a bit tricky. Let me parse it again.

The constraint says: If in some state s, the expression "white_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1" holds, then in s or in some state after s, "you are holding purple_block_1" must hold. Since the initial state already has "white1 not on orange1", then the arm must hold purple1 at some point from the initial state onwards. So in the plan, we must include an action where the arm picks up purple1. So that's a requirement.

Another constraint: "purple_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in at least one state. Initially, purple1 is on white1, so it's not on the table. So the initial state already satisfies this. But then, if during the plan, purple1 is moved to the table, then we have a state where purple1 is on the table. But the constraint says that there must be at least one state where it's not on the table. Since it's initially not on the table, that's already satisfied. But maybe the plan could move it to the table and then back, but the constraint just needs at least one state where it's not on the table. So that's already covered. But then the second part of this constraint is: If in some state s, "purple_block_1 is not on the table" holds, then in s or after, "white_block_2 is on top of red_block_1" must hold. Wait, the initial state has purple1 not on the table (since it's on white1). So the initial state s0 has "purple1 not on table", which triggers the requirement that white2 must be on red1 in s0 or after. But in the initial state, white2 is on the table with orange2 on top. So in the plan, at some point after s0, we need to have white2 on red1. But the goal is white2 on purple1. Wait, this seems conflicting. How can white2 be on red1 at some point, but the final goal is white2 on purple1? Hmm, perhaps the plan must include stacking white2 on red1 and then moving it again to purple1. But that would make the plan longer, but since the constraints require that if purple1 is not on the table (which is true in the initial state), then white2 must be on red1 at some point. So in the plan, we need to stack white2 on red1, and then later move it to purple1.

But wait, the initial state has purple1 not on the table, so the constraint is triggered. Therefore, in the plan, white2 must be on red1 at some state after s0. But the goal is white2 on purple1. So how to satisfy both?

Additionally, the third constraint: At least one state must have either "purple1 is on top of orange1" or "you are holding purple1". So that's another requirement. So we need to have in the plan either stacking purple1 on orange1 (which might not be part of the goal) or holding purple1. But holding purple1 is already required by the first constraint's implication. So perhaps the plan must include holding purple1, which would satisfy both the first constraint's implication and the third constraint.

Putting this all together:

The goal is white2 on purple1. To do that, we need to clear purple1. Currently, purple1 has red1 and orange1 on top. So we need to unstack orange1 from red1, then unstack red1 from purple1, making purple1 clear. Then, we can pick up white2 (but white2 has orange2 on top; so first, we need to clear white2 by unstacking orange2. Then putdown orange2 somewhere, then pickup white2 and stack on purple1.

But let's outline the steps:

1. Unstack orange1 from red1. Since orange1 is clear, we can do that. So unstack orange1 red1. Now, the arm is holding orange1. Then putdown orange1 on the table. Now, red1 is clear. Then unstack red1 from purple1. Then putdown red1. Now, purple1 is clear. Then, unstack orange2 from white2 (since orange2 is clear). Putdown orange2. Then pickup white2 and stack on purple1. But wait, after stacking white2 on purple1, the goal is achieved. But we also need to satisfy the constraints.

Wait, but according to the constraints, when purple1 is not on the table (which it isn't in the initial state and remains so unless we move it), then white2 must be on red1 at some point. But if we never move purple1 to the table, then the constraint that purple1 is not on the table is already true, but the implication is that white2 must be on red1 at some point. However, in the plan I outlined, white2 is moved to purple1, but never to red1. So that would violate the constraint. Therefore, the plan must include a step where white2 is stacked on red1 before moving it to purple1.

So perhaps:

After clearing purple1 (by removing red1 and orange1), we need to stack white2 on red1 first, then move it to purple1. But how?

Alternatively, during the process, perhaps after moving red1 to the table, stack white2 on red1 (which is on the table?), but red1 is on the table. Wait, stacking white2 on red1 when red1 is on the table would require that red1 is clear. So after putting red1 on the table, it's clear. Then we can stack white2 on red1. Then, to move white2 from red1 to purple1, we need to unstack white2 from red1, then stack on purple1. But that's more steps. Let me think.

Original plan steps:

1. Unstack orange1 from red1. Arm holds orange1. Then putdown orange1.

2. Unstack red1 from purple1. Arm holds red1. Then putdown red1.

3. Now, purple1 is clear. Then, unstack orange2 from white2. Arm holds orange2. Putdown orange2.

4. Now, white2 is clear. Pickup white2. Stack white2 on purple1. Done.

But this plan skips the constraint that requires white2 to be on red1 at some point. Because the constraint triggered by purple1 not being on the table (which is true in the initial state) requires that white2 is on red1 at some point. So in this plan, white2 is never on red1. Thus, the plan is invalid. Therefore, we need to adjust.

So perhaps, after step 2 (putdown red1 on the table), we need to stack white2 on red1, then later unstack and stack on purple1.

Let's adjust:

1. Unstack orange1 from red1. Putdown orange1.

2. Unstack red1 from purple1. Putdown red1.

3. Now, purple1 is clear. Then, unstack orange2 from white2. Putdown orange2.

4. Pickup white2. Stack white2 on red1 (which is on the table). Now, white2 is on red1.

5. Now, to move white2 to purple1, we need to unstack white2 from red1. But after step 4, red1 is under white2, so to unstack, we need to pick up white2. So:

5. Unstack white2 from red1. Now holding white2.

6. Stack white2 on purple1.

But in this case, step 4 satisfies the constraint that white2 is on red1. Then step 5 and 6 move it to purple1. So the plan includes white2 on red1, thus satisfying the constraint that if purple1 is not on the table (which is true in the initial state and all steps except if we move purple1 to table, which we don't), then white2 must be on red1 at some state after. So step 4 makes white2 on red1, which satisfies that.

Now, let's check the other constraints.

First constraint: "white_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1" must hold in at least one state. Since in the initial state, white1 is on the table, this is true. So that's covered. The linked constraint is that whenever "white1 not on orange1" holds (which is always in the plan except if we stack white1 on orange1), then "hold purple1" must happen at that state or after. So in the plan, since "white1 not on orange1" is true in the initial state, we must hold purple1 at some point. In the current plan steps, when do we hold purple1? Let's see. The current steps don't involve holding purple1. Because in the plan outlined, after clearing purple1 (steps 1-2), we move white2 to red1 (steps 3-4), then move white2 to purple1 (steps 5-6). But in none of these steps is purple1 being picked up. So this is a problem. Because the constraint requires that after the initial state (where white1 is not on orange1), we must hold purple1 at some point.

So the plan must include an action where the arm holds purple1. How can we do that?

Hmm. To pick up purple1, we need to have it clear. Initially, purple1 has red1 on top, but after steps 1 and 2, purple1 is clear. So after step 2, purple1 is clear. So perhaps after step 2, instead of moving white2 immediately, we can pickup purple1 and put it back down, but that would add unnecessary steps, but maybe necessary to satisfy the constraint.

Wait, but in the plan outlined above, after step 2, purple1 is clear. So we can add steps where we pickup purple1, then put it down again. But why would we do that? Because the constraint requires that at some point after the initial state, we hold purple1.

So perhaps:

After step 2, we have:

3. Pickup purple1. Then putdown purple1. Then proceed with steps 3-6 (original steps 3-6 would now be steps 5-8). But this adds steps, but maybe necessary.

But wait, why not hold purple1 when stacking white2 onto it? Because when we stack white2 onto purple1, we have to be holding white2, not purple1. So stacking white2 on purple1 requires that we are holding white2 and purple1 is clear. So during the stack action, we aren't holding purple1. Therefore, to satisfy the constraint that we must hold purple1 at some point after the initial state, we need to have an action where the arm is holding purple1. So perhaps we need to pick up purple1, then put it down again, even if it's not necessary for the goal. But that would add steps, making the plan longer. But the problem requires an optimal (shortest possible) plan, so this is not ideal.

Alternatively, is there a way to hold purple1 as part of the necessary steps to achieve the goal?

Wait, the goal is to have white2 on purple1. So after we clear purple1, we need to stack white2 onto it. But to stack white2, we need to be holding white2 and purple1 is clear. So perhaps during the process, we don't need to hold purple1. But the constraint says we must hold purple1 at some point. Therefore, we have to include an action where we hold purple1. So maybe in the plan, after step 2 (unstack red1 from purple1 and putdown red1), we can pick up purple1 and then put it back down, then proceed. But that adds two steps. But maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps we can stack white2 on red1, then unstack red1 from purple1, but wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the initial steps are:

1. Unstack orange1 from red1. Putdown.

2. Unstack red1 from purple1. Putdown. Now purple1 is clear.

3. Now, to hold purple1, we can do:

3. Pickup purple1. Then putdown purple1. Now, purple1 is on the table. Then stack white2 on purple1. But stacking on the table is done via putdown, but stack requires placing on another block. Wait, no: stack x y is placing x on y. If we put purple1 on the table, then we can stack white2 on purple1. Wait, no. Because stack x y requires that y is a block. To place a block on the table, we use putdown. So if we put purple1 on the table, then to stack white2 on purple1, we need to have purple1 on the table (so pickup white2, then stack on purple1 which is on the table. Wait, but stack x y requires that y is clear. If purple1 is on the table, then we can stack white2 on it if it's clear.

Wait, but initially, purple1 is on white1. If we move purple1 to the table (by unstacking it?), but in the initial state, purple1 is under red1 and orange1. So to unstack purple1 from white1, we need to have nothing on top of purple1. But initially, there's red1 on purple1. So we can't unstack purple1 until red1 is removed.

So after steps 1 and 2 (removing red1 and orange1), purple1 is clear. Then, to move purple1, we can pick it up (since it's on white1). So:

3. Unstack purple1 from white1. But wait, the action is unstack x y, which requires x is on top of y, and x is clear, and the arm is empty. In this case, after step 2, purple1 is on white1 and clear. So unstack purple1 white1. Then, the arm holds purple1. Then, we can putdown purple1 on the table. Then, stack white2 on purple1. But that would achieve the goal.

But this approach would move purple1 to the table. But the goal is to have white2 on purple1. So if purple1 is on the table, then stacking white2 on it is allowed. So that's possible. Let's see:

Alternative plan:

1. Unstack orange1 from red1. Putdown orange1.

2. Unstack red1 from purple1. Putdown red1.

3. Unstack purple1 from white1. Now holding purple1.

4. Putdown purple1 on the table. Now purple1 is on the table, clear.

5. Unstack orange2 from white2. Putdown orange2.

6. Pickup white2. Stack white2 on purple1. Done.

This plan has white2 on purple1 (which is on the table). But the goal is just white2 on purple1, regardless of where purple1 is. So this satisfies the goal. But in this plan, purple1 is on the table in the final state. But the initial constraint requires that in some state, purple1 is not on the table. Wait, the constraint says: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'purple_block_1 is not on the table'". In the initial state, purple1 is not on the table (it's on white1). In this plan, after step 3, purple1 is moved to the table (step 4), so from that point on, purple1 is on the table. So the constraint is satisfied in the initial state and steps before step 4. So that's okay.

But then the constraint that if purple1 is not on the table in some state s, then white2 must be on red1 in s or after. In the initial state, s0, purple1 is not on the table. So the constraint requires that white2 is on red1 at s0 or after. But in this plan, white2 is never on red1, so this constraint is violated. Therefore, this plan is invalid.

Ah, right. So the plan where we move purple1 to the table and stack white2 on it would not satisfy the second constraint, because in the initial state, purple1 is not on the table, so the constraint requires that white2 is on red1 at some point. Therefore, we must include white2 being on red1 in the plan.

This is getting complicated. Let's recap the constraints:

1. At least one state where white1 is not on orange1. This is satisfied initially.

2. Whenever white1 is not on orange1 (which is always true except if we stack white1 on orange1), then the arm must hold purple1 at that state or after.

3. At least one state where purple1 is not on the table. Initially true, but if we move purple1 to the table, then we need to have another state where it's not on the table again, but that may not be necessary if we can keep it not on the table.

4. Whenever purple1 is not on the table (which is true in the initial state and any state before moving it to the table), then white2 must be on red1 in that state or after.

5. At least one state where either purple1 is on orange1 or the arm is holding purple1. Since the arm must hold purple1 due to constraint 2, this is satisfied.

So to satisfy all constraints:

- The arm must hold purple1 at least once (due to constraint 2, triggered by the initial state).

- White2 must be on red1 at least once (due to constraint 4, triggered by the initial state where purple1 is not on the table).

- The plan must include at least one state where purple1 is not on the table (which is true initially and possibly others).

So how to achieve all this.

Let me try to outline a plan that includes:

- Moving white2 to red1.

- Holding purple1.

Here's a possible plan:

1. Unstack orange2 from white2. Putdown orange2. Now white2 is clear.

2. Pickup white2. Stack white2 on red1. (Now white2 is on red1, satisfying the constraint that white2 is on red1 after the initial state.)

3. Now, to proceed to the goal, we need to move white2 from red1 to purple1. But first, we need to clear purple1.

4. Unstack orange1 from red1. Putdown orange1.

5. Unstack red1 from purple1. Putdown red1. Now purple1 is clear.

6. Now, need to unstack white2 from red1. But after step 5, red1 is on the table. So white2 is on red1. So unstack white2 from red1. Now holding white2.

7. Stack white2 on purple1. Done.

But in this plan, when do we hold purple1? We haven't held it yet. So this violates constraint 2. Because the initial state has white1 not on orange1, so we must hold purple1 at some point. But in this plan, we never hold purple1. So we need to include an action where we hold purple1.

So perhaps between steps 5 and 6:

After step 5, purple1 is clear. So:

6. Pickup purple1. Now holding purple1. Then putdown purple1. Now, this satisfies the constraint that we held purple1.

7. Then unstack white2 from red1.

8. Stack white2 on purple1.

But this adds steps. So the plan becomes:

1. Unstack orange2 from white2. Putdown.

2. Pickup white2. Stack on red1.

3. Unstack orange1 from red1. Putdown.

4. Unstack red1 from purple1. Putdown.

5. Pickup purple1. Putdown. (Now holding purple1 satisfies constraint 2.)

6. Unstack white2 from red1. Stack on purple1.

But in step 5, we putdown purple1, so it's on the table. Then in step 6, we stack white2 on purple1, which is on the table. So white2 is on purple1 on the table. That's acceptable for the goal.

But does this plan meet all constraints?

Let's check:

- Constraint 1: At least one state where white1 is not on orange1. Initial state satisfies.

- Constraint 2: In the initial state (s0), white1 is not on orange1. Therefore, the arm must hold purple1 at s0 or after. In this plan, step 5 is when we hold purple1. So that's satisfied.

- Constraint 3: At least one state where purple1 is not on the table. Initially, it's not on the table. After step 5, we put it on the table. So up to step 4, it's not on the table. So satisfied.

- Constraint 4: Whenever purple1 is not on the table (s0 to step 4), white2 must be on red1 in s or after. In step 2, white2 is stacked on red1. So during steps 2-4, white2 is on red1. So in state after step 2, white2 is on red1, which satisfies the requirement.

- Constraint 5: At least one state where either purple1 is on orange1 or the arm holds purple1. Step 5 is when the arm holds purple1. So satisfied.

This plan seems to meet all constraints. Now let's check if it's optimal. The steps are:

1. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_2

2. putdown orange_block_2

3. pickup white_block_2

4. stack white_block_2 red_block_1

5. unstack orange_block_1 red_block_1

6. putdown orange_block_1

7. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1

8. putdown red_block_1

9. pickup purple_block_1

10. putdown purple_block_1

11. unstack white_block_2 red_block_1

12. stack white_block_2 purple_block_1

That's 12 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, can we combine some steps?

Alternative approach: After step 4 (stack white2 on red1), proceed to unstack red1 from purple1, but red1 has white2 on top. So we can't unstack red1 unless white2 is cleared. So we have to first unstack white2 from red1, but then we lose the white2 on red1 state required by the constraint. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe after stacking white2 on red1 (step 4), we unstack red1 from purple1. But red1 is under white2, so red1 is not clear. So we can't unstack red1 unless we first remove white2. Which would require unstacking white2, but then we lose the state where white2 is on red1. So this is necessary.

Hmm. So the steps seem necessary. But perhaps there's a smarter order.

Wait, let's think again. The goal is white2 on purple1. To do that, we need purple1 clear. Purple1 is under red1 and orange1. So steps to clear purple1:

Unstack orange1 from red1, then unstack red1 from purple1.

Then, to get white2 on purple1, white2 must be clear (orange2 is on it; so unstack orange2 first).

But also, the constraints require that white2 is on red1 at some point and that we hold purple1.

So perhaps the optimal plan would be:

1. Unstack orange2 from white2. Putdown orange2.

2. Pickup white2. Stack on red1. (This satisfies the constraint that white2 is on red1.)

3. Unstack orange1 from red1. Putdown.

4. Unstack red1 from purple1. Putdown.

5. Pickup purple1. Putdown. (To satisfy holding purple1.)

6. Unstack white2 from red1. Stack on purple1.

But that's 12 steps again. Wait, but maybe after step 4, when purple1 is clear, we can pickup purple1 and then stack white2 on it without putting it down. Wait, but to stack white2 on purple1, we need to be holding white2 and purple1 is clear. So if after step 4, we have:

4. Unstack red1 from purple1. Putdown red1.

5. Unstack orange2 from white2. Putdown orange2.

6. Pickup white2.

7. Stack white2 on purple1.

But this would not include stacking white2 on red1, thus violating the constraint. So this approach won't work.

Alternatively, perhaps we can hold purple1 while moving other blocks. For example:

After step 4 (unstack red1 from purple1 and putdown), we can pickup purple1, then stack it somewhere else, but that's unnecessary for the goal. But that would add steps. Not optimal.

Alternatively, can we hold purple1 and then use it in a way that meets the constraints?

Hmm, perhaps not. The optimal plan seems to require 12 steps. But maybe there's a shorter path.

Wait, let's think again. What if we move purple1 to a different block instead of the table. For example, after unstacking purple1 from white1, stack it on orange1. That way, purple1 is on orange1, which satisfies constraint 5 (either purple1 on orange1 or holding purple1). But that would require additional steps.

Let's try:

After unstacking red1 and orange1:

1. Unstack orange1 from red1. Putdown.

2. Unstack red1 from purple1. Putdown.

3. Now, purple1 is clear. Unstack orange2 from white2. Putdown.

4. Pickup white2. Stack on red1. Now white2 is on red1.

5. Unstack white2 from red1. Stack on purple1.

But again, we need to hold purple1. So in this case, steps 1-5:

1. unstack orange1 red1 → hold orange1.

2. putdown orange1.

3. unstack red1 purple1 → hold red1.

4. putdown red1.

5. unstack orange2 white2 → hold orange2.

6. putdown orange2.

7. pickup white2.

8. stack white2 red1.

9. unstack white2 red1.

10. stack white2 purple1.

But again, steps 10 steps, but missing the step where we hold purple1. So we need to include that.

So after step 4, perhaps:

5. pickup purple1. putdown. Then proceed.

That would add steps 5 and 6:

5. pickup purple1.

6. putdown purple1.

Then steps 7-12 as before. Now total steps are 12.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to hold purple1 while stacking or unstacking. For example, after unstacking red1 from purple1, we can pickup purple1 and then use it in a stack action. But how?

If we pickup purple1, then we can't stack anything else until we put it down. Because the arm can only hold one block. So to stack white2 on purple1, we need to have white2 in the arm and purple1 clear. So after putting down purple1, then pickup white2 and stack.

But this approach would require:

After unstacking red1:

1. unstack orange1 from red1. putdown.

2. unstack red1 from purple1. putdown.

3. unstack orange2 from white2. putdown.

4. pickup white2. stack on red1.

5. unstack white2 from red1. stack on purple1.

But again, missing the pickup of purple1.

Alternatively, after step 2 (purple1 is clear), instead of moving white2, we can:

3. pickup purple1. Then stack purple1 on orange1. Then proceed.

But then purple1 is on orange1, which satisfies constraint 5. Also, by holding purple1, satisfies constraint 2. Then, after that, we need to move white2 to purple1, which is now on orange1. So:

4. stack purple1 orange1.

5. unstack orange2 from white2. putdown.

6. pickup white2. stack on purple1.

But this results in white2 on purple1, which is on orange1. The goal is just white2 on purple1, regardless of where purple1 is. So this satisfies the goal. But now, we've stacked purple1 on orange1, which may affect other constraints.

Let's see:

- Constraint 4: whenever purple1 is not on the table (which is true in initial state and until step 3 when we stack it on orange1), then white2 must be on red1 in that state or after. But in this plan, white2 is never on red1, which violates constraint 4. So this approach is invalid.

Therefore, it seems the only way to satisfy all constraints is to include steps where white2 is stacked on red1, and also hold purple1. Hence, the 12-step plan is necessary.

But perhaps there's a shorter way. Let me try to find it.

Wait, what if we hold purple1 when we unstack red1 from purple1. For example:

After unstacking red1 from purple1, we are holding red1. Then putdown red1. Then, pickup purple1 (now clear). Then, putdown purple1. Then proceed. But this requires two steps (pickup and putdown purple1), which adds steps.

Alternatively, after unstacking red1, we can putdown red1, then pickup purple1 and stack it on red1. But then purple1 is on red1. Then, we can unstack purple1 later. But this may not help.

Alternatively, after unstacking red1, we can stack red1 on some other block, but that's not necessary.

Hmm. I'm starting to think that the minimal plan requires 12 steps, given the constraints. But maybe there's a way to optimize.

Wait, let's think about the order of actions. Perhaps we can unstack orange2 and orange1 in a different order to save steps.

For example:

1. Unstack orange2 from white2. Putdown.

2. Unstack orange1 from red1. Putdown.

3. Unstack red1 from purple1. Putdown.

Now purple1 is clear.

4. Pickup purple1. Putdown. (to satisfy holding purple1)

5. Pickup white2. Stack on red1. (satisfy constraint 4)

6. Unstack white2 from red1. Stack on purple1.

This is 8 steps. Wait, but steps 4 and 5:

After step 3, purple1 is clear. Step 4: pickup purple1, then putdown. Step 5: pickup white2. Stack on red1. Then unstack and stack.

But in this case, after step 3, purple1 is clear. But white2 is clear after step 1. So after step 3, we can do:

4. Pickup white2. Stack on red1. Now white2 is on red1.

5. Pickup purple1. Stack on white2. But this would require that white2 is clear. But white2 is under purple1. Wait, no. Stacking purple1 on white2 would require that white2 is clear. But white2 is on red1. So to stack purple1 on white2, we need to unstack white2 from red1 first. This is getting complicated.

Alternatively, after step 3 (purple1 clear), we can:

4. Pickup white2. Stack on red1. (Now white2 on red1)

5. Unstack white2 from red1. Stack on purple1.

But to do that, after step 4, we need to unstack white2 from red1. Then stack on purple1. But during this, when do we hold purple1? We need to hold purple1 at some point.

Ah, right, in this plan, we never hold purple1. So constraint 2 is violated.

Thus, we must include an action where we hold purple1.

So steps:

1. Unstack orange2 from white2. Putdown.

2. Unstack orange1 from red1. Putdown.

3. Unstack red1 from purple1. Putdown.

4. Pickup purple1. Putdown. (Hold purple1)

5. Pickup white2. Stack on red1.

6. Unstack white2 from red1. Stack on purple1.

This is 10 steps. But steps 4 requires two actions (pickup and putdown). So total steps are:

1. unstack orange2 white2

2. putdown orange2

3. unstack orange1 red1

4. putdown orange1

5. unstack red1 purple1

6. putdown red1

7. pickup purple1

8. putdown purple1

9. pickup white2

10. stack white2 red1

11. unstack white2 red1

12. stack white2 purple1

Still 12 steps.

Is there a way to avoid some putdowns? For example, when we pickup purple1 and then immediately stack it somewhere, but that would require having a clear block to stack on. Alternatively, perhaps after unstacking red1 from purple1, we can pickup purple1 and stack it somewhere else, but that's not necessary for the goal.

Alternatively, after unstacking red1, we can stack red1 on another block, but I don't see how that helps.

Another approach: Maybe we can use the unstack action to hold purple1. For example, if we can unstack purple1 from white1, but initially, purple1 is under red1 and orange1. So we need to first remove red1 and orange1.

Once purple1 is clear, we can unstack it from white1. So:

1. Unstack orange1 from red1. Putdown.

2. Unstack red1 from purple1. Putdown.

3. Unstack purple1 from white1. Now holding purple1.

4. Now, we are holding purple1. This satisfies the constraint that we must hold purple1 after the initial state.

5. Putdown purple1. (Now purple1 is on the table.)

6. Unstack orange2 from white2. Putdown.

7. Pickup white2. Stack on purple1. Done.

But this plan has white2 on purple1 (on the table). However, the constraint requires that white2 must be on red1 at some point. In this plan, white2 is never on red1, so it's invalid.

So this approach fails constraint 4.

Thus, the only way to satisfy all constraints is to have white2 on red1 at some point, which requires additional steps.

Therefore, the minimal plan likely requires 12 steps. Let's verify if each step is necessary and correct.

Step-by-step:

1. unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_2. Preconditions: orange2 is clear, arm empty. Yes, initial state has orange2 on white2 and clear. So valid.

2. putdown orange_block_2. Now orange2 is on the table.

3. pickup white_block_2. Pre: white2 is clear (after step1), on table, arm empty. Yes.

4. stack white_block_2 on red_block_1. Pre: holding white2, red1 is clear. Is red1 clear? Initially, red1 is under orange1. But after step1? No. Because step1 is unstacking orange2. Red1 is under orange1, which hasn't been moved yet. Wait, no. Wait, in step1, we unstack orange2 from white2. So white2 is now clear. But red1 is still under orange1. So in step3, when we pickup white2, red1 is still under orange1.

So the previous plan outline is incorrect. Because after step1 and step2 (unstack orange2 and putdown), white2 is clear. Then step3 is pickup white2. Then step4 is stack white2 on red1. But red1 is not clear. Red1 has orange1 on top. So stacking white2 on red1 is not possible because red1 is not clear.

Ah, this is a mistake. So the previous plan steps are invalid because red1 is not clear when we try to stack white2 on it.

This is a crucial error. So the steps need to be reordered.

Let me correct this. To stack white2 on red1, red1 must be clear. But red1 has orange1 on top. So we need to first unstack orange1 from red1, then putdown orange1, then unstack red1 from purple1, then putdown red1, then stack white2 on red1.

Wait, no. If red1 is under orange1, then to make red1 clear, we need to unstack orange1 from red1. But after that, red1 is clear. Then, to stack white2 on red1, we need to have red1 on the table or on a block. But after unstacking orange1, red1 is on purple1. So to stack white2 on red1, red1 must be clear. So after unstacking orange1 from red1, red1 is clear (no blocks on top), but it's on purple1. So red1 is not on the table. So to stack white2 on red1, we need to have red1 on the table? No, stack x y requires y to be clear and you're holding x. So red1 is on purple1. So stacking white2 on red1 would require red1 to be clear (which it is after unstacking orange1) and white2 is held. So yes, possible.

Wait, but red1 is on purple1. So stacking white2 on red1 would make a tower: purple1, red1, white2. Then, to unstack red1 from purple1 later, we need to first unstack white2 from red1. But this is possible.

So perhaps the corrected plan steps are:

1. Unstack orange2 from white2. Putdown.

2. Unstack orange1 from red1. Putdown.

3. Now, red1 is clear (no blocks on top). Pickup white2. Stack on red1. (Now, white2 is on red1, which is on purple1.)

4. Unstack red1 from purple1. But red1 has white2 on top. So cannot unstack. Therefore, this approach is invalid.

Ah, right. So after stacking white2 on red1 (which is on purple1), red1 has white2 on top. So to unstack red1 from purple1, we need to first remove white2. But that would undo the stacking, which was done to satisfy the constraint. But this complicates things.

Therefore, the correct order must be:

1. Unstack orange1 from red1. Putdown.

2. Unstack red1 from purple1. Putdown. Now, red1 is on the table, clear.

3. Unstack orange2 from white2. Putdown.

4. Pickup white2. Stack on red1. Now white2 is on red1, which is on the table. This satisfies the constraint that white2 is on red1.

5. Now, to move white2 to purple1, we need to unstack white2 from red1.

6. Pickup purple1. Putdown. (To satisfy holding purple1.)

7. Unstack white2 from red1. Stack on purple1.

But wait, after step 2, purple1 is on white1 and clear. So steps 6 would be:

6. Pickup purple1. Putdown.

Then stack white2 on purple1.

But in this case, steps are:

1. unstack orange1 red1 → hold orange1.

2. putdown orange1.

3. unstack red1 purple1 → hold red1.

4. putdown red1.

5. unstack orange2 white2 → hold orange2.

6. putdown orange2.

7. pickup white2.

8. stack white2 red1.

9. pickup purple1.

10. putdown purple1.

11. unstack white2 red1.

12. stack white2 purple1.

This is 12 steps again. And in step 8, stacking white2 on red1 requires that red1 is clear (which it is after step4). So that's valid.

But step9: pickup purple1 requires that purple1 is clear. After step4, purple1 is on white1 and clear. So yes.

This plan seems valid. Now, checking all constraints:

- Constraint 2: holding purple1 in step9. Satisfied.

- Constraint4: white2 on red1 in step8. Satisfied.

- Other constraints are satisfied.

Therefore, this is the correct plan. Now, let's write it in the required format with actions.
