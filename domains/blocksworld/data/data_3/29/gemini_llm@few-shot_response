Okay, let's break this down. The goal is to get white_block_2 on top of purple_block_1. We have several constraints to satisfy along the way.

Here's the initial state:
* white_block_1 is on the table
* white_block_2 is on the table
* purple_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
* red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1
* white_block_3 is on the table
* orange_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
* orange_block_2 is on top of white_block_2

Here's the plan:

```
```
unstack orange_block_1 red_block_1
putdown orange_block_1
unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
putdown red_block_1
unstack purple_block_1 white_block_1
pickup white_block_2
stack white_block_2 red_block_1
unstack white_block_2 red_block_1
stack white_block_2 purple_block_1
```
