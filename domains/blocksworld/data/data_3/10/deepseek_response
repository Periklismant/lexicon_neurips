This plan achieves the goal of placing white_block_1 on the table while satisfying all constraints:

1. **Constraints Met:**
   - **First Constraint:** `green_block_1 on white_block_1` and `holding black_block_1` are true after stacking green_block_1 and picking up black_block_1 (steps 9-11).
   - **Second Constraint:** `holding white_block_1` occurs when unstacking it (step 5).
   - **Third Constraint:** After holding white_block_1 (step 5), black_block_4 is not clear due to black_block_3 stacked on it (step 4).
   - **Fourth Constraint:** Initially true and maintained.
   - **Fifth Constraint:** Holding green_block_1 (step 9) satisfies the requirement after black_block_3 is moved.
