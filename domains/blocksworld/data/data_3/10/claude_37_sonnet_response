Alright, so we have a Blocksworld problem with several blocks, and we need to create a plan to achieve a goal state while respecting certain constraints. Let's first understand the problem by summarizing the elements:

**Objects:**
- green_block_1
- black_block_1
- black_block_2
- yellow_block_1
- white_block_1
- black_block_3
- black_block_4

**Initial State:**
- green_block_1 is on the table.
- black_block_1 is on the table and is clear.
- black_block_2 is on the table.
- yellow_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 and is clear.
- white_block_1 is on top of black_block_2.
- black_block_3 is on top of white_block_1.
- black_block_4 is on top of black_block_3 and is clear.
- You (the robotic arm) are not holding any block.

So, the initial configuration looks something like:

```
   black_block_4
   black_block_3     yellow_block_1    black_block_1
   white_block_1     green_block_1
   black_block_2        table
```

**Goal State:**
- white_block_1 is on the table

**Constraints:**
1. At some point, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, and you are holding black_block_1.
2. At some point, you are holding white_block_1.
3. If you are holding white_block_1 in state s, then at state s or some state after s, black_block_1 or black_block_4 must not be clear (i.e., there must be a block on top of one of them).
4. At some point, black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1.
5. If black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1 in state s, then at state s or some state after s, black_block_2 must not be on the table or you must be holding green_block_1.

Let's think about how to achieve the goal while satisfying the constraints:

To achieve the goal, we need to get white_block_1 on the table. Currently, white_block_1 is under black_block_3 and black_block_4 in a tower on top of black_block_2, so we need to remove those blocks.

However, we also have several constraints to satisfy. Let's see how we can meet them:

Constraint 1: At some point, green_block_1 must be on top of white_block_1, and I must be holding black_block_1.
Constraint 2: At some point, I must be holding white_block_1.
Constraint 3: If I am holding white_block_1, then at that state or later, black_block_1 or black_block_4 must not be clear.
Constraint 4: At some point, black_block_3 must not be on top of yellow_block_1.
Constraint 5: If black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1, then at that state or later, black_block_2 must not be on the table or I must be holding green_block_1.

Constraint 4 is trivially satisfied in the initial state since black_block_3 is on top of white_block_1, not on top of yellow_block_1. So we need to check if at that state, black_block_2 is not on the table or if we are holding green_block_1. In the initial state, black_block_2 is on the table and we are not holding green_block_1, so we need to make sure one of these conditions becomes true after we start moving blocks.

So, let me try to devise a plan:

1. First, we need to unstack all blocks from above white_block_1:
   - unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3.
   - Somewhere to put black_block_4, e.g., on the table with putdown.
   - unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1.
   - Somewhere to put black_block_3, e.g., on the table with putdown.

2. Now, to satisfy Constraint 1, we need to place green_block_1 on top of white_block_1 and hold black_block_1. But to do this, we need to free up green_block_1 by removing yellow_block_1:
   - unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.
   - Somewhere to put yellow_block_1, e.g., on the table with putdown.
   - Pick up black_block_1 from the table.
   - While holding black_block_1, we need to place green_block_1 on top of white_block_1. But we can't hold both black_block_1 and green_block_1 at the same time.

Actually, I made a mistake in the above reasoning. We can't have green_block_1 on top of white_block_1 and also be holding black_block_1 at the same time. We need to sequence these operations properly:

1. First, we need to unstack all blocks from above white_block_1.
2. Then, we need to place green_block_1 on top of white_block_1 (which requires moving yellow_block_1 first).
3. After that, we need to pick up black_block_1 to satisfy Constraint 1.

Actually, let's think of a plan that ensures all the constraints.

1. First, we need to unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3.
2. Then, we can unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1.
3. Next, unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2.
4. At this point, we're holding white_block_1, which satisfies Constraint 2. To satisfy Constraint 3, we need to make sure black_block_1 or black_block_4 is not clear. We can achieve this by placing a block on top of one of them. Let's, for instance, place white_block_1 on top of black_block_1.
5. Then, we need to unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.
6. We pick up green_block_1 from the table. This satisfies the second part of Constraint 5.
7. Place green_block_1 on top of white_block_1. This helps set up for Constraint 1.
8. We then unstack green_block_1 from white_block_1.
9. Place green_block_1 on the table.
10. Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_1.
11. Pick up black_block_1 from the table.
12. Stack green_block_1a on top of white_block_1.
   Now, we have green_block_1 on top of white_block_1 and we're holding black_block_1, which satisfies Constraint 1.
13. Stack black_block_1 on top of black_block_4. This maintains the condition that black_block_1 or black_block_4 is not clear, as required by Constraint 3.
14. Unstack green_block_1 from white_block_1.
15. Place green_block_1 on the table.
16. Pick up white_block_1 from the table and place it on the table (the desired goal state).

Wait, I'm confusing myself. Let's re-approach this systematically.

I think a more straightforward way to approach this is to start with the goal state and then ensure all the constraints are satisfied:

1. To get white_block_1 on the table, we first need to free it by removing all blocks on top of it.
2. Once white_block_1 is free, place it on the table to achieve the goal.
3. Now, we need to ensure all the constraints are satisfied. Let's check them one by one.

Hmm, actually the approach isn't working well. Let's take a different approach. I'll list the sequence of steps we need to achieve our goal and ensure all the constraints are satisfied:

1. unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3
2. putdown black_block_4
3. unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1
4. putdown black_block_3
5. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2
6. At this point, we're holding white_block_1, which satisfies Constraint 2.
7. stack white_block_1 on top of black_block_1
   This makes black_block_1 not clear, which satisfies Constraint 3.
8. unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
9. putdown yellow_block_1
10. pickup green_block_1 
   This satisfies the second part of Constraint 5.
11. stack green_block_1 on top of white_block_1
12. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_1
13. putdown green_block_1
14. pickup black_block_1
15. stack green_block_1 on top of white_block_1
   At this point, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and we're holding black_block_1, which satisfies Constraint 1.
16. putdown black_block_1
17. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_1
18. putdown green_block_1
19. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_1
20. putdown white_block_1
   Goal achieved.

Wait, sorry about that. I'm making this too complex. Since the goal is simply to have white_block_1 on the table, and there are several constraints to satisfy, I should take a more systematic approach.

Let's first identify the dependencies:

1. To get white_block_1 on the table, we need to clear it by removing black_block_3 and black_block_4 first.
2. To satisfy Constraint 1 (green_block_1 on top of white_block_1 and hold black_block_1), we need to first move yellow_block_1 off green_block_1.
3. To satisfy Constraint 2, we need to pick up white_block_1 at some point.
4. After satisfying Constraint 2, we need to ensure black_block_1 or black_block_4 is not clear.
5. Constraint 4 (black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1) is already satisfied in the initial state.
6. After satisfying Constraint 5, we need to either move black_block_2 off the table or pick up green_block_1.

I think I've been overcomplicating this. Let's lay out a clear plan:

1. unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3
2. putdown black_block_4
3. unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1
4. putdown black_block_3
5. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2
   Now, we're holding white_block_1, satisfying Constraint 2.
6. stack white_block_1 on top of black_block_1
   This ensures black_block_1 is not clear, satisfying Constraint 3.
7. unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
8. putdown yellow_block_1
9. pickup green_block_1 
   This satisfies the second part of Constraint 5.
10. stack green_block_1 on top of white_block_1
11. pickup black_block_1 
   This can't be done currently as white_block_1 is on top of black_block_1. 

Actually, I'm think I'm getting overly complex again. Let's take a more deliberate approach. I'll draw out a sequence of steps that achieves the goal and satisfies each constraint.

The goal is to have white_block_1 on the table. Currently, the setup is:

```
   black_block_4
   black_block_3     yellow_block_1    black_block_1
   white_block_1     green_block_1
   black_block_2        table
```

To get white_block_1 on the table, we need to:
1. unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3
2. putdown black_block_4
3. unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1
4. putdown black_block_3
5. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2

Now, we're holding white_block_1, which satisfies Constraint 2. According to Constraint 3, since we're holding white_block_1, we must ensure that at this point or later, black_block_1 or black_block_4 is not clear (i.e., it has a block on top of it). Let's address this by:

6. stack white_block_1 on top of black_block_1

Now, black_block_1 is not clear, which satisfies Constraint 3.

Now, we need to work on Constraint 1, which requires green_block_1 to be on top of white_block_1 and that we're holding black_block_1. First, we need to free up green_block_1:

7. unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
8. putdown yellow_block_1
9. pickup green_block_1

Actually, by picking up green_block_1, we've satisfied the second part of Constraint 5. So, that's taken care of.

10. stack green_block_1 on top of white_block_1

Now, we need to hold black_block_1 to satisfy Constraint 1. But black_block_1 is under white_block_1, so we can't pick it up yet. We need to move white_block_1:

Actually. I think I've got a good plan. I'll restate it from scratch:

1. unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3
2. putdown black_block_4
3. unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1
4. putdown black_block_3
5. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2
   Now, we're holding white_block_1, satisfying Constraint 2.
6. stack white_block_1 on black_block_1
   This ensures black_block_1 is not clear, satisfying Constraint 3.
7. unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
8. putdown yellow_block_1
9. pickup green_block_1 
   This satisfies the second part of Constraint 5.
10. stack green_block_1 on white_block_1
11. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_1
12. putdown green_block_1
13. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_1
14. putdown white_block_1
   Goal achieved: white_block_1 is on the table.
15. pickup black_block_1
16. pickup green_block_1
17. stack green_block_1 on white_block_1
   Now, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, but we need to hold black_block_1 to satisfy Constraint 1.

Actually I realize now that I'm being inconsistent with the actions. I don't think the "pickup" action here can be done if we're already holding a block. Let me re-examine the available actions, their preconditions, and effects:

1. "pickup x": Pick up block x from the table. Preconditions: block x is clear, is on the table, and you are not holding any block. Effects: You are holding block x, and block x is no longer on the table.

2. "putdown x": Place block x on the table. Preconditions: You are holding block x. Effects: Block x is on the table, block x is clear, and you are no longer holding any block.

3. "stack x y": Place block x on top of block y. Preconditions: You are holding block x, and block y is clear. Effects: Block x is on top of block y, block x is clear, block y is not clear, and you are not holding any block.

4. "unstack x y": Pick up block x from the top of block y. Preconditions: Block x is on top of block y, block x is clear, and you are not holding any block. Effects: You are holding block x, block x is no longer on top of block y, and block y is clear.

With this understanding, let me revise my plan.

1. unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3
2. putdown black_block_4
3. unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1
4. putdown black_block_3
5. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2
   Now, we're holding white_block_1, satisfying Constraint 2.
6. stack white_block_1 on black_block_1
   This ensures black_block_1 is not clear, satisfying Constraint 3.
7. unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
8. putdown yellow_block_1
9. pickup green_block_1 
   This satisfies the second part of Constraint 5.
10. stack green_block_1 on white_block_1
11. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_1
12. putdown green_block_1
13. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_1
14. pickup black_block_1
   Now, we're holding black_block_1.
15. putdown white_block_1
   Goal achieved: white_block_1 is on the table.
16. pickup green_block_1
17. stack green_block_1 on white_block_1
   Now, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, but we need to hold black_block_1 to satisfy Constraint 1.
   
But I can't do this step, because I'm holding black_block_1, and I can't also pick up green_block_1. So I need a different strategy.

Actually, I think it's easier to satisfy Constraint 1 earlier in the plan. Let's revise:

1. unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3
2. putdown black_block_4
3. unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1
4. putdown black_block_3
5. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2
   Now, we're holding white_block_1, satisfying Constraint 2.
6. stack white_block_1 on black_block_4
   This ensures black_block_4 is not clear, satisfying Constraint 3.
7. unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
8. putdown yellow_block_1
9. pickup green_block_1 
   This satisfies the second part of Constraint 5.
10. stack green_block_1 on white_block_1
11. pickup black_block_1
   Now, we have green_block_1 on top of white_block_1 and we're holding black_block_1, satisfying Constraint 1.
12. putdown black_block_1
13. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_1
14. putdown green_block_1
15. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_4
16. putdown white_block_1
   Goal achieved: white_block_1 is on the table.

Hold on, I'm facing a challenge in my reasoning. Let's slow down and think through this differently.

What if we try to satisfy the constraints in the order they are listed?

Initially, the setup is:
```
   black_block_4
   black_block_3     yellow_block_1    black_block_1
   white_block_1     green_block_1
   black_block_2        table
```

Constraint 1 requires green_block_1 on top of white_block_1 and holding black_block_1. Let's work towards that:

1. unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3
2. putdown black_block_4
3. unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1
4. putdown black_block_3
5. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2
6. putdown white_block_1

Now, white_block_1 is on the table (which is our goal), but let's continue to satisfy the constraints.

7. unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
8. putdown yellow_block_1
9. pickup green_block_1
10. stack green_block_1 on white_block_1
11. pickup black_block_1

Now, we have green_block_1 on top of white_block_1 and we're holding black_block_1, which satisfies Constraint 1.

Constraint 2 requires that at some point we're holding white_block_1. We'll ensure this towards the end, but we'll come back to it.

For Constraint 4, black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1 already, so that's satisfied. As per Constraint 5, we need to ensure that at that point or later, black_block_2 is not on the table or we're holding green_block_1. We have held green_block_1, so that constraint is satisfied.

Let's go back to Constraint 2 and 3. We need to hold white_block_1, and when we do, ensure that black_block_1 or black_block_4 is not clear.

12. putdown black_block_1
13. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_1
14. stack green_block_1 on black_block_1
15. pickup white_block_1

Now, we're holding white_block_1, which satisfies Constraint 2. At this point, black_block_1 is not clear (as green_block_1 is on top of it), which satisfies Constraint 3.

16. putdown white_block_1
   Goal achieved: white_block_1 is on the table.

Actually, I realized that I'm trying to satisfy the constraints in an individual state, but the constraint expresses the condition that "If expression X holds in some state s, then expression Y must hold at s or at some state after s." 

Let me re-analyze the constraints more carefully:

1. At some point, green_block_1 must be on top of white_block_1, and I must be holding black_block_1 at the same time.
2. At some point, I must be holding white_block_1.
3. If I'm holding white_block_1 in state s, then at s or at a future state, black_block_1 or black_block_4 must not be clear.
4. At some point, black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1.
5. If black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1 in state s, then at s or at a future state, black_block_2 must not be on the table or I must be holding green_block_1.

So, Constraint 3 means: After I've held white_block_1, I need to ensure at some point (which can be while I'm holding white_block_1 or after) that black_block_1 or black_block_4 has a block on top of it.

Similarly, for Constraint 5: After it's true that black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1, I need to ensure at some point (which can be at that time or after) that black_block_2 is not on the table or I'm holding green_block_1.

With this clearer understanding, let me revise my plan:

1. unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3
2. putdown black_block_4
3. unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1
4. putdown black_block_3

Now, at this point, black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1, which satisfies the first part of Constraint 5. As per the second part, I need to ensure that at this point or later, black_block_2 is not on the table or I'm holding green_block_1.

5. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2

Now, I'm holding white_block_1, which satisfies Constraint 2. According to Constraint 3, I need to ensure that at this point or later, black_block_1 or black_block_4 is not clear.

If I place white_block_1 on the table now, both black_block_1 and black_block_4 are clear, which would violate Constraint 3. So, I need to ensure one of them is not clear by placing a block on top of it.

6. stack white_block_1 on black_block_1
   Now, black_block_1 is not clear, which ensures Constraint 3 is satisfied.

7. unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
8. putdown yellow_block_1
9. pickup green_block_1 
   This ensures that the second part of Constraint 5 is satisfied because I'm holding green_block_1.

10. stack green_block_1 on white_block_1
11. pickup black_block_4

Since green_block_1 is now on white_block_1 but we're not holding black_block_1 (we're holding black_block_4), Constraint 1 isn't satisfied yet. And we can't immediately pick up black_block_1 because white_block_1 is on top of it. We need to move things around a bit more.

Actually, let's switch our approach:

1. unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3
2. putdown black_block_4
3. unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1
4. putdown black_block_3
5. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2
6. putdown white_block_1

At this point, white_block_1 is on the table (which is our goal), but we need to make sure all the constraints are satisfied.

For Constraint 5, we've made black_block_3 not on top of yellow_block_1, and now we need to ensure that black_block_2 is not on the table or we're holding green_block_1. Let's address this:

7. pickup black_block_2

Now, black_block_2 is not on the table, satisfying the second part of Constraint 5.

8. putdown black_block_2
9. unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
10. putdown yellow_block_1
11. pickup green_block_1
12. stack green_block_1 on white_block_1
13. pickup black_block_1

Now, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and we're holding black_block_1, which satisfies Constraint 1.

For Constraint 2, we've already held white_block_1 in step 5, so that's satisfied.

For Constraint 3, after holding white_block_1, we need to ensure at some point that black_block_1 or black_block_4 is not clear. In the state after step 13, black_block_1 is not clear because we're holding it, which satisfies Constraint 3.

For Constraint 4, black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1 throughout, so that's satisfied.

14. putdown black_block_1

So, our final plan is:

1. unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3
2. putdown black_block_4
3. unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1
4. putdown black_block_3
5. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2
6. putdown white_block_1
7. pickup black_block_2
8. putdown black_block_2
9. unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
10. putdown yellow_block_1
11. pickup green_block_1
12. stack green_block_1 on white_block_1
13. pickup black_block_1
14. putdown black_block_1

Wait, I think I misunderstood Constraint 3. It says: "If expression 'you are holding white_block_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "there is a block on top of black_block_1, i.e., black_block_1 is not clear", "there is a block on top of black_block_4, i.e., black_block_4 is not clear"' must hold at s or at some state after s."

This means that after I hold white_block_1, I need to make sure that at some point (during or after holding it), black_block_1 or black_block_4 has a block on top of it. Being held does not make a block "not clear" as per the description. A block is "not clear" only if there's a block on top of it.

In our plan, after holding white_block_1 in step 5, we do pu`tdown white_block_1` in step 6. At this point, neither black_block_1 nor black_block_4 has a block on top of it. We need to make sure one of them gets a block on top at some point.

Let's revise the plan:

1. unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3
2. putdown black_block_4
3. unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1
4. putdown black_block_3
5. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2
   Now, I'm holding white_block_1, which satisfies Constraint 2.

6. stack white_block_1 on black_block_1
   Now, black_block_1 has a block on top of it, ensuring it's not clear. This satisfies Constraint 3 because after holding white_block_1, we've made sure black_block_1 is not clear.

7. unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
8. putdown yellow_block_1
9. pickup green_block_1 
   This ensures that the second part of Constraint 5 is satisfied because I'm holding green_block_1.

10. stack green_block_1 on white_block_1
11. pickup black_block_2
   Note: green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 but we're not holding black_block_1 (we're holding black_block_2), so Constraint 1 isn't satisfied yet.

12. putdown black_block_2
13. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_1
14. putdown green_block_1
15. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_1
16. putdown white_block_1
   Goal achieved: white_block_1 is on the table.

17. pickup green_block_1
18. stack green_block_1 on white_block_1
19. pickup black_block_1
   Now, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and we're holding black_block_1, which satisfies Constraint 1.

20. putdown black_block_1

But I realize that this makes the plan unnecessarily long. Let's try to integrate the constraints more efficiently:

1. unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3
2. putdown black_block_4
3. unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1
4. putdown black_block_3
5. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2
   Now, I'm holding white_block_1, which satisfies Constraint 2.

6. stack white_block_1 on the table
   Goal achieved: white_block_1 is on the table.

For Constraint 3, after holding white_block_1, we need to ensure at some point that black_block_1 or black_block_4 is not clear. Let's address this:

7. unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
8. stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1
   Now, black_block_1 is not clear, which satisfies Constraint 3.

9. pickup green_block_1 
   This ensures that the second part of Constraint 5 is satisfied because I'm holding green_block_1.

10. stack green_block_1 on white_block_1
11. pickup black_block_1
   This can't be done because yellow_block_1 is on top of black_block_1. I need to move yellow_block_1 first.

Wait, this is getting complex. Let me think more systematically.

Actually. Let's look at the structure of the constraints and what they require:

Constraint 1 requires two things to be true at the same time: green_block_1 on top of white_block_1 and holding black_block_1.

Since I can only do one thing at a time, and placing green_block_1 on top of white_block_1 would use up one of those actions (and getting green_block_1 in position would also take several actions), I need to plan ahead.

1. First, I'll get white_block_1 on the table (our goal).
2. Then, I'll make sure black_block_1 is accessible.
3. Then, I'll make sure green_block_1 is accessible.
4. Place green_block_1 on top of white_block_1.
5. Pick up black_block_1.
   At this point, I'll have green_block_1 on top of white_block_1 and I'll be holding black_block_1, satisfying Constraint 1.

Now, let's address the other constraints:

Constraint 2 requires holding white_block_1 at some point.
Constraint 3 says: After holding white_block_1, make sure at some point black_block_1 or black_block_4 is not clear.
Constraint 4 requires black_block_3 to not be on top of yellow_block_1 at some point.
Constraint 5 says: After black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1, make sure at some point black_block_2 is not on the table or I'm holding green_block_1.

I'll try to satisfy all of these constraints in the most efficient way. Let's go step by step:

1. unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3
2. putdown black_block_4
3. unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1
4. putdown black_block_3

Now, black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1, which satisfies the first part of Constraint 5. As per the second part, I need to ensure that at this point or later, black_block_2 is not on the table or I'm holding green_block_1.

5. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2
   Now, I'm holding white_block_1, which satisfies Constraint 2.

6. stack white_block_1 on black_block_4
   This puts a block on top of black_block_4, ensuring it's not clear, which satisfies Constraint 3 because after holding white_block_1, I've made sure black_block_4 is not clear.

7. pickup black_block_2
   This ensures black_block_2 is not on the table, which satisfies the second part of Constraint 5.

8. putdown black_block_2
9. unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
10. putdown yellow_block_1
11. pickup green_block_1
12. stack green_block_1 on white_block_1
13. pickup black_block_1
   Now, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and I'm holding black_block_1, which satisfies Constraint 1.

14. putdown black_block_1
15. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_1
16. putdown green_block_1
17. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_4
18. putdown white_block_1
   Goal achieved: white_block_1 is on the table.

But no, I think the problem is I'm "putdown"-ing things too much. Actually, let me try to really optimize this.

In fact, it might be best to satisfy Constraint 1 earlier in the plan, so that we don't have to re-arrange blocks after meeting our goal:

1. unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3
2. putdown black_block_4
3. unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1
4. putdown black_block_3
5. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2
   Now, I'm holding white_block_1, which satisfies Constraint 2.

6. stack white_block_1 on the table
   Goal achieved: white_block_1 is on the table. However, we need to satisfy Constraint 3, so at some point, we need to make sure black_block_1 or black_block_4 is not clear.

7. pickup black_block_4
8. stack black_block_4 on black_block_1
   Now, black_block_1 is not clear, which satisfies Constraint 3 because after holding white_block_1, I've made sure black_block_1 is not clear.

9. pickup black_block_2
   This ensures black_block_2 is not on the table, which satisfies the second part of Constraint 5.

10. putdown black_block_2
11. unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
12. putdown yellow_block_1
13. pickup green_block_1
14. stack green_block_1 on white_block_1
15. unstack black_block_4 from black_block_1
16. putdown black_block_4
17. pickup black_block_1
   Now, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and I'm holding black_block_1, which satisfies Constraint 1.

18. putdown black_block_1

So, our optimized plan is:

1. unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3
2. putdown black_block_4
3. unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1
4. putdown black_block_3
5. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2
6. putdown white_block_1
7. pickup black_block_4
8. stack black_block_4 on black_block_1
9. pickup black_block_2
10. putdown black_block_2
11. unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
12. putdown yellow_block_1
13. pickup green_block_1
14. stack green_block_1 on white_block_1
15. unstack black_block_4 from black_block_1
16. putdown black_block_4
17. pickup black_block_1
18. putdown black_block_1

Wait, I just realized, I might be misinterpreting Constraint 3 again. It says if I'm holding white_block_1 at state s, then at state s or after, black_block_1 or black_block_4 should not be clear. In our plan, after holding white_block_1 (step 5), we are placing it on the table (step 6). At that step, both black_block_1 and black_block_4 are clear, which might violate Constraint 3.

Let's revise once more:

1. unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3
2. putdown black_block_4
3. unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1
4. putdown black_block_3
5. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2
   Now, I'm holding white_block_1, which satisfies Constraint 2. At this point, both black_block_1 and black_block_4 are clear, which means Constraint 3 isn't satisfied yet. By the constraint, we need to at this step or at a future step make sure either black_block_1 or black_block_4 is not clear.

6. stack white_block_1 on black_block_1 
   Now, black_block_1 is not clear, which satisfies Constraint 3.

7. pickup black_block_2
   This ensures black_block_2 is not on the table, which satisfies the second part of Constraint 5.

8. putdown black_block_2
9. unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
10. putdown yellow_block_1
11. pickup green_block_1
12. stack green_block_1 on white_block_1

At this point, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 but I need to be holding black_block_1 to satisfy Constraint 1. However, I can't pick up black_block_1 because white_block_1 is on top of it. We need to rearrange.

Wait, I think once again I'm overcomplicating this. Let's recall the constraints:

1. At some point, green_block_1 must be on top of white_block_1, and I must be holding black_block_1 at the same time.
2. At some point, I must be holding white_block_1.
3. If I'm holding white_block_1 in state s, then at s or at a future state, black_block_1 or black_block_4 must not be clear.
4. At some point, black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1.
5. If black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1 in state s, then at s or at a future state, black_block_2 must not be on the table or I must be holding green_block_1.

Given our initial state and the goal, there are no constraints on the temporal ordering, so I can satisfy these constraints in any order, and I should choose the order that minimizes the plan length.

It's crucial to note that some constraints have causal conditions. For instance, Constraint 3 only needs to be satisfied if I'm holding white_block_1 at some point. Given our goal is to have white_block_1 on the table, I'll be picking it up at some point. This means I need to ensure that after picking it up, at some point, either black_block_1 or black_block_4 is not clear.

Let me start by visualizing the problem again:

```
   black_block_4
   black_block_3     yellow_block_1    black_block_1
   white_block_1     green_block_1
   black_block_2        table
```

My goal: white_block_1 on the table.
I have to pick up white_block_1 from under black_block_3 and black_block_4, and place it on the table.

Let's plan efficiently:

1. unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3
2. putdown black_block_4
3. unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1
4. putdown black_block_3
   Now, I've satisfied Constraint 4 since black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1.
5. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2
   Now, I'm holding white_block_1, which satisfies Constraint 2.

At this point, Constraint 3 requires that at this point (or a later state), either black_block_1 or black_block_4 must not be clear. I have several options:

Option 1: Stack white_block_1 directly on the table. But then I need to ensure that at a later point, black_block_1 or black_block_4 is not clear.
Option 2: Stack white_block_1 on black_block_1, which will make black_block_1 not clear, satisfying Constraint 3 immediately. Then I'll later move it to the table.
Option 3: Stack white_block_1 on black_block_4, which will make black_block_4 not clear, satisfying Constraint 3 immediately. Then I'll later move it to the table.

Option 2 looks appealing, but the goal is to have white_block_1 on the table. So, if I need to lift it off black_block_1 later, I won't be able to pick up black_block_1 for Constraint 1 unless I move white_block_1 elsewhere first.

Option 3 also looks appealing, and it might be more direct for the Constraint 1.

Let's go with Option 3:

1. unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3
2. putdown black_block_4
3. unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1
4. putdown black_block_3
5. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2
6. stack white_block_1 on black_block_4
   Now, black_block_4 is not clear, which satisfies Constraint 3.

Constraint 5 requires that after black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1, either black_block_2 is not on the table or I'm holding green_block_1. Since I put black_block_3 on the table in step 4, I need to satisfy one of these conditions:

7. pickup black_block_2
   This ensures black_block_2 is not on the table, which satisfies the second part of Constraint 5.
8. putdown black_block_2
9. unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
10. putdown yellow_block_1
11. pickup green_block_1
12. stack green_block_1 on white_block_1
13. pickup black_block_1
   Now, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and I'm holding black_block_1, which satisfies Constraint 1.
14. putdown black_block_1
15. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_1
16. putdown green_block_1
17. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_4
18. putdown white_block_1
   Goal achieved: white_block_1 is on the table.

Actually, I think Constraint 5 is a bit different that I understood. It doesn't just require that black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1; it requires the transition. If it's already true in the initial state (as is the case), it doesn't trigger the constraint.

In our initial state, black_block_3 is on top of white_block_1, not on top of yellow_block_1, and I'm not holding green_block_1. It's already true that "black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1". So, this means Constraint 5 is already triggered from the initial state, and I need to ensure at some point that black_block_2 is not on the table or I'm holding green_block_1. Given our plan above, I've already satisfied this by having black_block_2 not on the table (steps 7 & 8) and also by holding green_block_1 (step 11).

So, I think our plan is on track.

Actually I wonder if I'm misinterpreting the other constraints. Let me go back to Constraint 4. It says: At some point, black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1. In the initial state, black_block_3 is already not on top of yellow_block_1, so that constraint is satisfied from the start.

I think it's still true theat Constraint 5 says: If it's ever true that black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1 (which it is in the initial state), then at that point or after, black_block_2 should not be on the table or I'm holding green_block_1. So I need to have black_block_2 off the table or I must hold green_block_1 at some point.

So, let me ensure the plan is efficient:

1. unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3
2. putdown black_block_4
3. unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1
4. putdown black_block_3
5. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2
   Now, I'm holding white_block_1, which satisfies Constraint 2. According to Constraint 3, at this point or a future state, black_block_1 or black_block_4 must not be clear.

6. stack white_block_1 on black_block_1
   This makes black_block_1 not clear, which satisfies Constraint 3.

7. pickup black_block_2
   This ensures black_block_2 is not on the table, which satisfies the second part of Constraint 5.

8. putdown black_block_2
9. unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
10. putdown yellow_block_1
11. pickup green_block_1
12. stack green_block_1 on white_block_1
13. unstack green_block_1 from white_block_1
14. stack green_block_1 on black_block_2
15. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_1
16. putdown white_block_1
   Goal achieved: white_block_1 is on the table.

17. pickup green_block_1
18. stack green_block_1 on white_block_1
19. pickup black_block_1
   Now, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and I'm holding black_block_1, which satisfies Constraint 1.

20. putdown black_block_1

OK this is a valid plan, but it seems like it's far from optimial. Let me try starting over, given that the constraints are clear to me now. 

The goal is to get white_block_1 on the table. I'll start by getting that done as quickly as possible:

1. unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3
2. putdown black_block_4
3. unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1
4. putdown black_block_3
5. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2
   Now, I'm holding white_block_1, which satisfies Constraint 2. 
   I need to make sure that at this point or later, black_block_1 or black_block_4 is not clear (Constraint 3).

But, instead of stacking white_block_1 onto another block, let me directly achieve the goal by putting it on the table. This means I still need to ensure that black_block_1 or black_block_4 will not be clear at some point after this.

6. putdown white_block_1
   Goal achieved! white_block_1 is on the table. But I still need to satisfy the other constraints.
   Constraint 3 requires that after holding white_block_1, at some point, black_block_1 or black_block_4 is not clear.
   
7. pickup green_block_1
   This also satisfies the second part of Constraint 5 (since we are holding green_block_1, and black_block_3 is not on yellow_block_1).

8. stack green_block_1 on white_block_1
9. pickup black_block_1
   Now, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and I'm holding black_block_1, which satisfies Constraint 1.

10. stack black_block_1 on black_block_4
   This makes black_block_4 not clear, which satisfies Constraint 3.

11. pickup black_block_2
   This ensures black_block_2 is not on the table, which provides an additional satisfaction for the second part of Constraint 5.

12. putdown black_block_2

OK, so the most efficient plan I can come up with is:

1. unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3
2. putdown black_block_4
3. unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1
4. putdown black_block_3
5. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2
6. putdown white_block_1
7. pickup green_block_1 
8. stack green_block_1 on white_block_1
9. pickup black_block_1
10. stack black_block_1 on black_block_4
11. pickup black_block_2
12. putdown black_block_2

But wait, I think I made a mistake. Constraint 1 didn't require the green_block to be on top of white_block_1 and to hold black_block_1 at separate times; it required both to be true at the same time. 

Let me check:

>The following expression must hold in at least one state: 
	"The following conditions are all true: "green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1", "you are holding black_block_1"""

Yes, it requires both to be the case in a single state. In the plan above, at step 9, we have green_block_1 on top of white_block_1 and we're holding black_block_1. This fulfills Constraint 1.

Let me go through the plan one more time to check that the other constraints are satisfied too.

Constraint 2: 
>The following expression must hold in at least one state: 
	"you are holding white_block_1""

In our plan, at step 5, we are holding white_block_1. This satisfies Constraint 2.

Constraint 3:
>If expression 
	"you are holding white_block_1"
	holds in some state s, then expression
	"At least one of the following conditions is true: "there is a block on top of black_block_1, i.e., black_block_1 is not clear", "there is a block on top of black_block_4, i.e., black_block_4 is not clear""
	must hold at s or at some state after s"

In our plan, we held white_block_1 at step 5. After this step, we made black_block_4 not clear by stacking black_block_1 on top of it in step 10. This satisfies Constraint 3.

Constraint 4:
>The following expression must hold in at least one state: 
	"black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1""

In our plan, black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1 at all times, including the initial state. So Constraint 4 is satisfied.

Constraint 5:
>If expression 
	"black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1"
	holds in some state s, then expression
	"At least one of the following conditions is true: "black_block_2 is not on the table", "you are holding green_block_1""
	must hold at s or at some state after s"

Since black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1 from the very beginning, and later in the plan we picked up green_block_1 (step 7) and also ensured black_block_2 is not on the table (step 11), Constraint 5 is satisfied.

The goal is achieved in step 6 when we putdown white_block_1 on the table. 

So, our final plan is:

```
1. unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3
2. putdown black_block_4
3. unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1
4. putdown black_block_3
5. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2
6. putdown white_block_1
7. unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
8. putdown yellow_block_1
9. pickup green_block_1
10. stack green_block_1 on white_block_1
11. pickup black_block_1
12. stack black_block_1 on black_block_4
13. pickup black_block_2
14. putdown black_block_2
```

Checking again, this fulfills all constraints. But I notice that step 7 and 8, where we unstack and then put down yellow_block_1, aren't necessary for achieving the goal or satisfying the constraints, since we can directly pick up green_block_1 without having to move yellow_block_1 first. Let me make sure that's right:

```
Initial state:
   black_block_4
   black_block_3     yellow_block_1    black_block_1
   white_block_1     green_block_1
   black_block_2        table
```

From the initial state I see that we would need to move yellow_block_1 before picking up green_block_1, since yellow_block_1 is on top of green_block_1. So steps 7 and 8 are necessary.

I think our most concise plan is:

```
1. unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3
2. putdown black_block_4
3. unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1
4. putdown black_block_3
5. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2
6. putdown white_block_1
7. unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
8. putdown yellow_block_1
9. pickup green_block_1
10. stack green_block_1 on white_block_1
11. pickup black_block_1
12. stack black_block_1 on black_block_4
```

Actually, I just realized constraint 5 might involve picking up black_block_2 from the table. The plan fulfills all the constraints already, so picking up black_block_2 is unnecessary.

Here's our final optimized plan:

```
1. unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3
2. putdown black_block_4
3. unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1
4. putdown black_block_3
5. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2
6. putdown white_block_1
7. unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1
8. putdown yellow_block_1
9. pickup green_block_1
10. stack green_block_1 on white_block_1
11. pickup black_block_1
12. stack black_block_1 on black_block_4
```

This plan fulfills the goal and all the constraints as discussed above. It's a concise 12-step plan, but I'll check if it's possible to further optimize it.

Actually, looking at it again, the plan is pretty straightforward and there's no redundancy. We need to first clear the path to white_block_1, then pick it up and place it on the table. Then, we need to manipulate the blocks to satisfy all the constraints. The steps are directly aligned with these requirements, so I believe this is the optimal plan.
