Okay, let's break this down. We need to get white_block_1 on the table. Currently, black_block_4 is on black_block_3, which is on white_block_1, which is on black_block_2. Also, yellow_block_1 is on green_block_1. We have several constraints to satisfy along the way.

Here's the plan:

```
```
unstack black_block_4 black_block_3
putdown black_block_4
unstack black_block_3 white_block_1
putdown black_block_3
unstack white_block_1 black_block_2
putdown white_block_1
```
