Okay, let's try to figure out this planning problem. The goal is to get the white_block_1 onto the table, but there are several constraints we need to satisfy along the way. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the goal.

In the initial state, the blocks are arranged as follows:

- green_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top of it.
- black_block_2 is on the table with white_block_1 on top, then black_block_3, and black_block_4 on top of that.
- black_block_1 is on the table and clear.
- The other blocks (yellow, black_block_4) are clear as well.
- The robot is not holding any block.

The goal is to have white_block_1 on the table. So, currently, white_block_1 is under black_block_3 and black_block_4. To get white_block_1 to the table, we need to unstack the blocks above it. That means we need to first unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3, then unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1, then put down white_block_1. Wait, but white_block_1 is already on black_block_2. Wait, no, the initial state says white_block_1 is on top of black_block_2, with black_block_3 and black_block_4 stacked on it. So the stack is black_block_2 (on table) -> white_block_1 -> black_block_3 -> black_block_4. So to get white_block_1 on the table, we need to remove black_block_4 and black_block_3 first.

So the steps would be:

1. Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3. But to do that, the robot must be empty. Since black_block_4 is clear, we can unstack it. Then hold it. Then put it down somewhere.

Wait, but after unstacking black_block_4 from black_block_3, we need to put it down. Then unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1, put that down, then unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2 and put it on the table. But the goal is to have white_block_1 on the table, which it already is on top of black_block_2. Wait no: white_block_1 is on black_block_2, which is on the table. So to get white_block_1 on the table, we need to move it from black_block_2 to the table. But since black_block_3 and black_block_4 are on top of white_block_1, we must first remove them.

So the initial plan might be:

- Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3 (requires that black_block_4 is clear and robot is empty). Then putdown black_block_4.

Then unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1 (but wait, after unstacking black_block_4, black_block_3 becomes clear, right? Because when you unstack black_block_4, black_block_3 is now clear. So then we can unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1, but wait, white_block_1 is under black_block_3. Wait, no: initial state says white_block_1 is on black_block_2, then black_block_3 is on white_block_1, and black_block_4 on black_block_3. So the stack is black_block_2 (table) -> white_block_1 -> black_block_3 -> black_block_4.

So to remove white_block_1 from black_block_2, we need to first remove black_block_4 and black_block_3.

So steps:

1. Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3. This requires that black_block_4 is clear (which it is) and the robot is empty (which it is). After unstacking, the robot is holding black_block_4, and black_block_3 is clear.

Then, putdown black_block_4.

2. Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1. Now, black_block_3 is clear. So we can unstack it. Then hold black_block_3. Put it down.

3. Now, white_block_1 is clear. We can unstack it from black_block_2. Then put it down on the table. That achieves the goal.

But wait, the constraints complicate things. Let's look at the constraints:

First constraint: At some state, both "green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1" and "you are holding black_block_1" must hold. So we need to have a state where green_block_1 is stacked on white_block_1 and the robot is holding black_block_1.

Second constraint: At some state, the robot is holding white_block_1.

Third constraint: Whenever the robot is holding white_block_1, then either black_block_1 is not clear (has a block on top) or black_block_4 is not clear (has a block on top), either in that state or a later one.

Fourth constraint: At some state, black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1. But initially, black_block_3 is on white_block_1, so that's already not on yellow_block_1. Wait, no: the initial state has yellow_block_1 on green_block_1. So black_block_3 is on white_block_1. So black_block_3 is not on yellow_block_1. So the initial state already satisfies the fourth constraint. But maybe during the plan, this might change. Wait, but the fourth constraint says that in at least one state, black_block_3 is not on yellow_block_1. Since that's already true in the initial state, perhaps that constraint is already satisfied. But the problem says "must hold in at least one state", which could be the initial state. But maybe the user expects us to make sure that even if during the plan, we might have a situation where black_block_3 is on yellow_block_1, but at least one state (maybe after some actions) it's not. But in the initial state, it's already not, so maybe the fourth constraint is already satisfied. Wait, but the fourth constraint says that the expression "black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1" must hold in at least one state. So the initial state satisfies this, so perhaps that's okay. However, the problem says that a valid plan must abide by the constraints. So maybe the fourth constraint is already satisfied by the initial state, but we need to ensure that during the plan, at some state (could be initial), it holds. So that's okay.

But then there's the fifth constraint: If in some state s, black_block_3 is not on top of yellow_block_1 (which is always true except if we stack it there), then in s or some state after, either black_block_2 is not on the table or the robot is holding green_block_1. So since black_block_3 is not on yellow_block_1 in the initial state, then in the initial state or some state after, either black_block_2 is not on the table (i.e., it's moved) or the robot is holding green_block_1. Since in the initial state, black_block_2 is on the table, so we need that in the plan, after the initial state, either black_block_2 is moved (so not on table) or the robot holds green_block_1 at some point.

But the goal is to have white_block_1 on the table. To do that, white_block_1 is currently on black_block_2, so to move white_block_1 to the table, we need to unstack it from black_block_2, which would leave black_block_2 on the table. So unless we move black_block_2, it remains on the table. Therefore, to satisfy the fifth constraint, since the initial state triggers the condition (black_block_3 not on yellow_block_1), then in the plan, we need to either move black_block_2 off the table or have the robot hold green_block_1 at some point.

But in the initial plan I was considering, the steps would involve moving white_block_1 from black_block_2 to table. So after that, black_block_2 is still on the table, but white_block_1 is on the table. So unless we move black_block_2, it remains on the table. Therefore, to satisfy the fifth constraint, we need to either move black_block_2 (so it's not on table) or have the robot hold green_block_1 at some point.

In the initial plan steps I thought of, after moving white_block_1, black_block_2 is still on the table. So to satisfy the fifth constraint, we need to either move black_block_2 (but that's not necessary for the goal) or have the robot hold green_block_1.

But the first constraint requires that in some state, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and the robot is holding black_block_1. So that suggests that we need to stack green_block_1 onto white_block_1. Which would require first moving yellow_block_1 off green_block_1.

Because in the initial state, green_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on top. So to stack green_block_1 on white_block_1, we need to first unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1, put it down, then pickup green_block_1 and stack it on white_block_1.

But the first constraint is that at some state, green_block_1 is on white_block_1 and the robot is holding black_block_1. So perhaps after stacking green_block_1 on white_block_1, and then picking up black_block_1, that would satisfy the first constraint. But that would require several steps.

But the problem is that stacking green_block_1 on white_block_1 would require moving yellow_block_1 first, which is on green_block_1. So let's think about that.

So steps to satisfy the first constraint:

- Unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1. But initially, yellow_block_1 is on green_block_1 and is clear. So robot can unstack it. Then put it down.

- Then pickup green_block_1 (since it's on the table and clear now) and stack it on white_block_1. But where is white_block_1 at that point? If we haven't moved white_block_1 yet, then white_block_1 is under black_block_3 and black_block_4. So to stack green_block_1 on white_block_1, we need to first clear white_block_1 by removing black_block_3 and 4. But that's part of the main goal. So perhaps the steps need to be interleaved.

Alternatively, after moving black_block_4 and 3, and white_block_1 is on black_block_2, then we can unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2, put it down, then stack green_block_1 on white_block_1. But then the goal is to have white_block_1 on the table, so after stacking green_block_1 on it, we would need to move it again. Hmm, this complicates things.

But the first constraint requires that in some state, green_block_1 is on white_block_1 and the robot is holding black_block_1. So perhaps after moving white_block_1 to the table (the goal), we can then stack green_block_1 on it (but that would require moving yellow_block_1 first). Then, after that, pick up black_block_1. But then we have to do that in the plan, even though it's not part of the goal. But the constraints must be satisfied during the plan.

So maybe the plan needs to include steps that temporarily stack green_block_1 on white_block_1 and hold black_block_1, even if that's undone later.

But the goal is only about the final state. So perhaps after achieving the goal, we can do some extra steps to satisfy the constraints. But the constraints require that the expressions hold in at least one state during the plan, not necessarily in the final state.

So for example, after moving white_block_1 to the table (achieving the goal), then do some other actions to satisfy the constraints.

But wait, the goal is to have white_block_1 on the table. So once we put white_block_1 on the table, that's the goal. The plan can have additional steps after that as long as the final state still meets the goal. Wait, no. The goal is the final state. So the plan must end with white_block_1 on the table. Any actions after that would change the state, possibly moving white_block_1 again. So no, the plan must end with white_block_1 on the table. Therefore, the constraints must be satisfied in some state before the final action.

So let's think again. To satisfy the first constraint (green on white and holding black_1), perhaps during the plan, after moving some blocks, we stack green on white, then pickup black_1, then proceed.

But let's outline the steps:

Main goal: Get white_block_1 to table.

Constraints:

1. At some state, green on white and holding black_1.

2. At some state, holding white.

3. Whenever holding white, then either black_1 is not clear or black_4 is not clear in that state or later.

4. At some state, black_3 is not on yellow (already true in initial state).

5. If black_3 is not on yellow (which is always true except if we stack it there), then in that state or later, either black_2 is not on table or holding green.

So let's start by trying to handle the constraints.

First, the second constraint requires that we hold white_block_1 at some point. That's necessary because to move white_block_1 to the table, we have to unstack it from black_block_2, which requires holding it. So that's covered in the main plan. So constraint 2 is satisfied when we unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2 (but wait, no: white_block_1 is under black_block_3 and 4. So we need to unstack black_block_4, then black_block_3, then white_block_1 can be unstacked. So when we unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2, we are holding it, which satisfies constraint 2. But then the third constraint says that whenever we hold white_block_1, in that state or later, either black_block_1 has a block on top or black_block_4 has a block on top.

So during the time we hold white_block_1, we need to ensure that either black_block_1 is not clear (has a block) or black_block_4 is not clear. But in the initial state, black_block_1 is clear. After some steps, maybe we can place a block on black_block_1 or on black_block_4.

But let's think: when we unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2, we are holding it. At that moment, if we can ensure that either black_block_1 or black_block_4 has a block on top, then the constraint is satisfied. Alternatively, after putting white_block_1 down, perhaps we place a block on one of them.

But how to handle this.

Let me outline the steps again, considering constraints:

1. Unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3. Then putdown black_block_4.

2. Unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1. Putdown black_block_3.

3. Now, white_block_1 is clear. Unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2. Now holding white_block_1 (satisfies constraint 2). At this point, we need to ensure that either black_block_1 has a block on top or black_block_4 has a block on top, either now or later.

But currently, black_block_1 is clear (on table), and black_block_4 is on the table (since we put it down earlier). So we need to place a block on one of them.

Perhaps after putting down white_block_1 (the goal), we can stack something on black_block_1 or black_block_4. But the goal is to have white_block_1 on the table, so after putting it down, we can't move it again. So perhaps before putting it down, we need to do something.

Wait, during the time we are holding white_block_1 (step 3), the third constraint requires that in that state or after, either black_block_1 is not clear or black_block_4 is not clear. So during step 3 (holding white_block_1), the robot is holding white_block_1, and the current state has black_block_1 clear and black_block_4 clear (since they are on the table). So to satisfy the constraint, we need to after this step, place a block on one of them.

So after putting down white_block_1 (step 4: putdown white_block_1), then maybe stack a block on black_block_1 or black_block_4.

But to stack on black_block_1, we need to have a block to place. For example, we can use black_block_1 itself, but it's on the table. Wait, no. To stack on black_block_1, we need to have another block. For example, pick up black_block_1 and stack something on it. But the robot can only hold one block at a time.

Alternatively, perhaps during the steps before putting down white_block_1, we can have already placed a block on black_block_1 or black_block_4.

Wait, let's think again. The third constraint says that if at any state s, the robot is holding white_block_1, then in s or some state after s, either black_block_1 has a block on top or black_block_4 has a block on top.

So in the scenario where we unstack white_block_1 (step 3), then put it down (step 4), then after that, we need to ensure that either black_block_1 or black_block_4 has a block on top.

But how? Because after step 4, white_block_1 is on the table. To place a block on black_block_1, we need to have another block available. For example, perhaps we can use yellow_block_1, which is initially on green_block_1. So maybe after step 4, we unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1, then stack it on black_block_1. Then, that would make black_block_1 not clear, satisfying the third constraint.

But this adds extra steps. Let's see:

Step 3: unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2 (holding it).

Step 4: putdown white_block_1. Now, the goal is achieved.

Then, to satisfy the third constraint, after step 3 (when we were holding white), we need to have in some state after that, black_block_1 or 4 not clear.

So after step 4, we can:

5. pickup yellow_block_1 (from green_block_1, which requires unstacking it first? Because yellow_block_1 is on green_block_1. To pickup yellow_block_1, it must be on the table. Wait, no. Wait, yellow_block_1 is on green_block_1. To pickup yellow_block_1, the robot would need to unstack it from green_block_1. So:

5. unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1. Then stack it on black_block_1.

So:

Step 5: unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.

Step 6: stack yellow_block_1 on black_block_1.

Now, black_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on top, so not clear. This would satisfy the third constraint, because after step 3 (holding white), in step 6, we make black_block_1 not clear.

So the third constraint is satisfied.

Now, the first constraint requires that in some state, green_block_1 is on white_block_1 and the robot is holding black_block_1.

So to achieve that, after step 4 (white_block_1 is on table), we can stack green_block_1 on white_block_1, then pickup black_block_1.

But green_block_1 is currently on the table (since we unstacked yellow_block_1 from it in step 5). So:

Step 7: pickup green_block_1.

Step 8: stack green_block_1 on white_block_1. Now, green is on white.

Step 9: pickup black_block_1. Now, the robot is holding black_block_1, and green is on white. So this state satisfies the first constraint.

Then, after that, we need to putdown black_block_1 somewhere, but that's extra steps. However, the problem allows the plan to end here as long as the goal is achieved. Wait, no. The goal is to have white_block_1 on the table. After step 4, white_block_1 is on the table. Steps 5-9 modify other blocks, but as long as white_block_1 remains on the table, the goal is maintained. However, when we stack green_block_1 on white_block_1 in step 8, that would move white_block_1 under green_block_1. But white_block_1 is on the table, right? No. If white_block_1 is on the table, stacking green_block_1 on it would require that green_block_1 is placed on white_block_1, which is on the table. So after step 8, green_block_1 is on white_block_1, which is on the table. Therefore, white_block_1 is still on the table, satisfying the goal. So that's acceptable.

But then the plan would end with green_block_1 on white_block_1, and the robot holding black_block_1. To end the plan, the robot must not be holding anything. So after step 9 (holding black_block_1), we need to put it down.

Step 10: putdown black_block_1.

But now, the final state has white_block_1 on the table with green_block_1 on top, which is okay because the goal only requires white_block_1 on the table. So the goal is still satisfied.

So this plan would satisfy all constraints, but it's quite long. Let's see if there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, maybe during the initial steps of moving black_block_4 and 3, we can satisfy some constraints.

Let me outline the plan step by step, considering all constraints:

1. unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3. Now holding black_block_4. Put it down.

2. unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1. Now holding black_block_3. Put it down.

3. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2. Now holding white_block_1 (satisfies constraint 2). At this point, we need to ensure that either black_block_1 or black_block_4 has a block on top in this state or later.

So, after step 3, we are holding white_block_1. We need to either:

a) Before putting down white_block_1, stack it on black_block_1 or black_block_4. But the goal is to put it on the table. So this would require that after stacking, we then unstack again, which is inefficient.

b) After putting down white_block_1, stack another block on black_block_1 or black_block_4.

So steps:

4. putdown white_block_1. Now goal is achieved.

5. Now, need to stack something on black_block_1 or black_block_4.

Let's use black_block_4. We can stack black_block_3 on black_block_4. But black_block_3 is on the table. So:

5. pickup black_block_3.

6. stack black_block_3 on black_block_4. Now, black_block_4 is not clear. This satisfies the third constraint, because after step 3 (holding white_block_1), we later stacked black_block_3 on black_block_4.

Now, the third constraint is satisfied.

Now, the first constraint: green_block_1 on white_block_1 and holding black_block_1.

After step 4, white_block_1 is on the table. So:

7. unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1. Then put it down.

8. pickup green_block_1.

9. stack green_block_1 on white_block_1. Now, green is on white.

10. pickup black_block_1. Now, holding black_block_1 and green is on white. This satisfies the first constraint.

11. putdown black_block_1.

This plan has 11 steps. But maybe we can optimize.

Wait, after step 6, we have black_block_3 stacked on black_block_4. Then, in step 7, we unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1. Then, step 8: pickup green_block_1 and stack on white_block_1.

But perhaps during these steps, we can combine some actions.

Alternatively, let's see if there's a way to satisfy the first constraint earlier.

After step 4 (white_block_1 on table), maybe stack green_block_1 on it, then pick up black_block_1.

But green_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on it. So to stack green_block_1 on white_block_1, we need to first remove yellow_block_1.

So steps 5-9 are necessary.

But perhaps there's a shorter way.

Alternative approach:

Instead of putting down white_block_1 immediately after unstacking, perhaps use it to satisfy the third constraint.

For example, when holding white_block_1 (step 3), we can stack it on black_block_1. That would make black_block_1 not clear, satisfying the third constraint. Then, we can unstack it again and put it down. But this adds steps.

Wait, but the goal is to have white_block_1 on the table. So if we stack it on black_block_1 and then unstack it again, that's two more steps. But maybe it's worth it to satisfy the constraint with fewer steps.

So:

3. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2 (holding it).

4. stack white_block_1 on black_block_1. Now, black_block_1 has white_block_1 on top (not clear). This satisfies the third constraint because during step 3 (holding white_block_1), we later stack it on black_block_1, making black_block_1 not clear.

But then the white_block_1 is on black_block_1, not on the table. So we need to unstack it again.

5. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_1.

6. putdown white_block_1. Now it's on the table.

This adds steps but may help with constraints.

But this would satisfy the third constraint during step 4. Also, during step 3, we were holding white_block_1, and in step 4, we stack it on black_block_1, making black_block_1 not clear. So the third constraint is satisfied.

This approach has more steps but might allow for other constraints to be satisfied more easily.

Additionally, during step 4, when we stack white_block_1 on black_block_1, we can then use that to satisfy the first constraint.

Wait, the first constraint requires that green_block_1 is on white_block_1 and the robot is holding black_block_1. So if white_block_1 is on black_block_1, then we can stack green_block_1 on white_block_1 (which is on black_block_1), and then pick up black_block_1.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, after step 6 (white_block_1 on table), proceed to stack green_block_1 on it and pick up black_block_1 as before.

But this might be longer.

Let me compare the two approaches.

First approach (original):

Steps:

1. unstack B4 from B3 → putdown.

2. unstack B3 from W1 → putdown.

3. unstack W1 from B2 (holding W1, constraint 2 met).

4. putdown W1 (goal met).

5. unstack Y1 from G1 → putdown.

6. pickup G1 → stack on W1.

7. pickup B1 → putdown.

This handles constraint 1.

But need to also handle the third constraint by stacking something on B1 or B4 after step 4.

Second approach:

Steps:

1. unstack B4 from B3 → putdown.

2. unstack B3 from W1 → putdown.

3. unstack W1 from B2 (holding W1).

4. stack W1 on B1 (now B1 has W1 → satisfies third constraint).

5. unstack W1 from B1 → putdown.

Now, steps 4 and 5 add two steps but satisfy the third constraint.

Then, to handle constraint 1:

6. unstack Y1 from G1 → putdown.

7. pickup G1 → stack on W1 (now on table).

8. pickup B1 → putdown.

This requires 8 steps, but also meets constraint 1.

But the first approach was longer but maybe more straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps we can combine steps.

Another idea: After step 3 (holding W1), instead of putting it down immediately, stack it on B1 (step 4), then unstack (step5), putdown (step6). Then proceed to handle constraint 1.

But this adds steps. However, maybe during these steps, we can also satisfy other constraints.

Now, the fifth constraint says that if in any state s, black_block_3 is not on yellow_block_1 (which is always true except if we stack it there), then in s or after, either B2 is not on table or holding G1.

In the initial plan where B2 remains on table, we need to ensure that after any state where B3 is not on Y1, we either move B2 or hold G1.

In the first approach, after step 4 (putdown W1), B2 is still on the table. So to satisfy the fifth constraint, since B3 is not on Y1 in all states, we need to have either B2 not on table or hold G1 at some point.

In the first approach, when we unstack Y1 from G1 (step5), then pickup G1 (step6), then we are holding G1. So during step6, the robot is holding G1. So after the state where B3 is not on Y1 (which is always), we have held G1 (step6). So this satisfies the fifth constraint.

Therefore, in the first approach, step6 (holding G1) satisfies the fifth constraint.

So putting it all together:

Plan steps:

1. unstack black_block_4 from black_block_3 → holding B4.

2. putdown black_block_4.

3. unstack black_block_3 from white_block_1 → holding B3.

4. putdown black_block_3.

5. unstack white_block_1 from black_block_2 → holding W1 (constraint2 met).

6. putdown white_block_1 (goal achieved).

Now, need to satisfy third constraint: after step5 (holding W1), ensure that in some later state, B1 or B4 is not clear.

Steps after step6:

7. unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1 → holding Y1.

8. putdown yellow_block_1.

9. pickup green_block_1 → holding G1.

10. stack green_block_1 on white_block_1 → G1 on W1.

11. pickup black_block_1 → holding B1 (now, constraint1 met: G1 on W1 and holding B1).

12. putdown black_block_1.

But also, after step5 (holding W1), we need to ensure that in some state after, B1 or B4 has a block. After step10, G1 is on W1, which is on the table. B1 is clear. B4 is on table. So that doesn't help. But after step11, when we pickup B1, B1 is not on the table anymore. Wait, no: pickup B1 requires that B1 is on the table and clear. So in step11, B1 is on table and clear. So pickup B1, then putdown. But this doesn't affect B1's clear status.

Wait, this approach doesn't satisfy the third constraint. Because after step5 (holding W1), we put it down in step6. Then, after that, we don't do anything to B1 or B4. So in this plan, after step5, there's no state where B1 or B4 is not clear. So the third constraint is not met.

So this approach is invalid.

Therefore, the third constraint requires that after step5 (holding W1), in some subsequent state, either B1 or B4 is not clear.

So after step6 (putdown W1), we need to place a block on B1 or B4.

So steps after step6:

7. pickup black_block_3 → which is on the table.

8. stack black_block_3 on black_block_1 → B1 now has B3 on top.

This makes B1 not clear, satisfying the third constraint.

Then proceed to handle the first constraint:

9. unstack yellow_block_1 from green_block_1.

10. putdown yellow_block_1.

11. pickup green_block_1.

12. stack green_block_1 on white_block_1.

13. pickup black_block_1 → now, G1 is on W1 and holding B1 (constraint1 met).

14. putdown black_block_1.

Now, this plan has 14 steps. But maybe we can optimize.

Alternatively, after step8 (B3 on B1), then we can use B3 for other purposes.

But this is getting complicated. Let's see:

The third constraint is satisfied in step8, where B1 has B3 on top.

The first constraint is satisfied in step13.

The second constraint is satisfied in step5.

The fourth constraint is satisfied in the initial state.

The fifth constraint: after any state where B3 is not on Y1 (which is all states), we have to either move B2 or hold G1. B2 is moved only if we unstack W1 from it. After step5, B2 is still on table. So to satisfy fifth constraint, we need to hold G1 at some point. In this plan, step11 holds G1, so that's satisfied.

So this plan meets all constraints.

But is there a shorter way?

Alternative plan:

1. unstack B4 from B3 → putdown B4.

2. unstack B3 from W1 → putdown B3.

3. unstack W1 from B2 → holding W1 (constraint2).

4. stack W1 on B1 → makes B1 not clear (satisfies third constraint).

5. unstack W1 from B1 → putdown W1 (goal).

6. unstack Y1 from G1 → putdown Y1.

7. pickup G1 → stack on W1.

8. pickup B1 → putdown B1.

Now, steps 4 and 5 add two steps but handle the third constraint.

This plan has 8 steps. Let's check the constraints:

Constraint1: In step8, when holding B1, is G1 on W1? After step7, G1 is stacked on W1. Then step7: stack G1 on W1. Then pickup B1. So yes, in step8, G1 is on W1 and holding B1. So constraint1 is met.

Constraint2: step3.

Constraint3: step4 (stack W1 on B1) happens after step3 (holding W1). So in step4, B1 has W1 on top, so not clear. So constraint3 is satisfied.

Constraint4: initial state.

Constraint5: after step6 (unstack Y1 from G1), B3 is not on Y1. Then in step7, pickup G1 (holding it). So constraint5 is satisfied.

So this plan has 8 steps. Is this valid?

Yes. Let's list the steps:

```
unstack black_block_4 black_block_3
putdown black_block_4
unstack black_block_3 white_block_1
putdown black_block_3
unstack white_block_1 black_block_2
stack white_block_1 black_block_1
unstack white_block_1 black_block_1
putdown white_block_1
unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1
putdown yellow_block_1
pickup green_block_1
stack green_block_1 white_block_1
pickup black_block_1
putdown black_block_1
```

Wait, but steps 6-7 involve stacking W1 on B1 and then unstacking it. After step5, we are holding W1. Then step6: stack W1 on B1. Then, step7: unstack W1 from B1 (requires that W1 is clear, which it is after stacking. Then putdown W1.

Yes, this works. Then steps 8-14 handle the first constraint.

But wait, in the alternative plan I thought of, after step5 (putdown W1), we need to do steps to satisfy constraint1.

Wait, let's count the steps again:

1. unstack B4 from B3 → putdown (step2).

2. unstack B3 from W1 → putdown (step4).

3. unstack W1 from B2 → holding W1 (step5).

4. stack W1 on B1 (step6).

5. unstack W1 from B1 → putdown (steps7-8).

Now, W1 is on table (step8).

Then, to satisfy constraint1:

9. unstack Y1 from G1 → putdown (steps9-10).

10. pickup G1 → stack on W1 (steps11-12).

11. pickup B1 → putdown (steps13-14).

So total steps: 14. But the alternative plan I thought of had 8 steps, but that seems incorrect.

Wait, no. Let's recount:

Alternative plan:

1. unstack B4 from B3.

2. putdown B4.

3. unstack B3 from W1.

4. putdown B3.

5. unstack W1 from B2 → holding W1 (constraint2).

6. stack W1 on B1 → B1 not clear (satisfies constraint3).

7. unstack W1 from B1 → putdown W1 (goal).

8. unstack Y1 from G1 → putdown Y1.

9. pickup G1 → stack on W1.

10. pickup B1 → putdown B1.

So steps: 10.

In step9, G1 is stacked on W1. Then step10: pickup B1. So during step10, G1 is on W1 and holding B1 → meets constraint1.

Yes. So this plan has 10 steps.

But perhaps even shorter.

Wait, after step7 (putdown W1), the goal is achieved. Then steps8-10 are to satisfy constraint1 and constraint5.

But in step8, unstack Y1 from G1. Then step9: stack G1 on W1. Then step10: pickup B1.

But perhaps we can combine some steps.

Wait, after step7 (W1 is on table), to stack G1 on W1, we need to unstack Y1 from G1 first. So steps8 and 9 are necessary.

Then, pickup B1 requires that B1 is clear. Since we stacked W1 on B1 earlier (step6), then unstacked W1 (step7), B1 is clear again. So in step10, pickup B1 is possible.

So the steps are:

1. unstack black_block_4 black_block_3

2. putdown black_block_4

3. unstack black_block_3 white_block_1

4. putdown black_block_3

5. unstack white_block_1 black_block_2

6. stack white_block_1 black_block_1

7. unstack white_block_1 black_block_1

8. putdown white_block_1

9. unstack yellow_block_1 green_block_1

10. putdown yellow_block_1

11. pickup green_block_1

12. stack green_block_1 white_block_1

13. pickup black_block_1

14. putdown black_block_1

This is 14 steps, but maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternative approach:

Can we use the action of stacking green_block_1 on white_block_1 before moving white_block_1 to the table?

But white_block_1 is under B3 and B4. So to stack green_block_1 on white_block_1, we need to clear white_block_1 first. Which requires moving B3 and B4. Which is part of the main plan.

But perhaps after moving B4 and B3, but before moving white_block_1, we can stack green_block_1 on white_block_1, then pickup black_block_1, then proceed to move white_block_1.

Let's try:

1. unstack B4 from B3 → putdown.

2. unstack B3 from W1 → putdown.

3. Now, W1 is clear.

4. unstack Y1 from G1 → putdown.

5. pickup G1 → stack on W1.

6. pickup B1 → now, constraint1 is met (G on W and holding B1).

7. putdown B1.

8. unstack W1 from B2 → holding W1 (constraint2).

9. putdown W1 (goal).

Now, after step6, constraint1 is satisfied.

Then step8-9: move W1 to table.

But during step8, when holding W1, we need to satisfy constraint3: in this state or after, B1 or B4 not clear.

In step6, we putdown B1, so B1 is clear. B4 is on the table and clear. So after step8 (holding W1), we need to make sure that in some later step, B1 or B4 has a block.

After step9 (putdown W1), we can stack something on B1 or B4.

For example:

10. pickup B3 → stack on B1.

This makes B1 not clear.

So steps:

10. pickup B3.

11. stack B3 on B1.

Now, constraint3 is satisfied.

But this adds steps. So total steps would be 11.

But let's see:

Steps:

1. unstack B4 from B3 → putdown (step2).

2. unstack B3 from W1 → putdown (step4).

3. unstack Y1 from G1 → putdown (step5).

4. pickup G1 → stack on W1 (step6).

5. pickup B1 → putdown (step7).

6. unstack W1 from B2 → putdown (steps8-9).

7. pickup B3 → stack on B1 (steps10-11).

This totals 11 steps.

But does this plan meet all constraints?

Constraint1: during step6, G1 is on W1 and robot is holding B1 (step6: pickup B1). Yes.

Constraint2: step8, holding W1.

Constraint3: during step8 (holding W1), after that, in step11, B1 has B3 on top. So satisfied.

Constraint4: already met.

Constraint5: after any state where B3 is not on Y1 (which is all states after step3), we need to either move B2 or hold G1. B2 is moved in step8 (unstack W1 from B2), which makes B2 have W1 on top? No, unstack W1 from B2 would leave B2 clear. Wait, no: unstack W1 from B2 leaves B2 on the table and clear. So B2 is still on the table. So to satisfy constraint5, we need to hold G1 at some point. In this plan, step4 (pickup G1). So yes.

So this plan has 11 steps.

Comparing to previous plan with 14 steps, this is better.

But let's check:

Step-by-step:

1. unstack B4 from B3 → B4 is clear, robot holds B4.

2. putdown B4.

3. unstack B3 from W1 → robot holds B3.

4. putdown B3.

5. unstack Y1 from G1 → robot holds Y1.

6. putdown Y1.

7. pickup G1 → robot holds G1.

8. stack G1 on W1 → G1 is on W1, which is on B2.

9. pickup B1 → robot holds B1. Now, constraint1 is met: G on W and holding B1.

10. putdown B1.

11. unstack W1 from B2 → robot holds W1 (constraint2).

12. putdown W1 (goal).

13. pickup B3 → robot holds B3.

14. stack B3 on B1 → B1 not clear (constraint3 satisfied).

This is 14 steps again. Wait, no. In this approach, steps are:

1. unstack B4 from B3.

2. putdown.

3. unstack B3 from W1.

4. putdown.

5. unstack Y1 from G1.

6. putdown.

7. pickup G1.

8. stack G1 on W1.

9. pickup B1.

10. putdown B1.

11. unstack W1 from B2.

12. putdown W1.

13. pickup B3.

14. stack B3 on B1.

So 14 steps. But in the previous alternative plan, steps were shorter.

Hmm. Maybe there's no way to avoid the extra steps. The optimal plan would be the shortest possible.

Another approach: Maybe satisfy constraint1 early by stacking G1 on W1 before moving W1.

But W1 is under B3 and B4. So after removing B3 and B4, W1 is clear. Then, stack G1 on W1, then pickup B1.

Let's try:

1. unstack B4 from B3 → putdown.

2. unstack B3 from W1 → putdown.

3. Now, W1 is clear.

4. unstack Y1 from G1 → putdown.

5. pickup G1 → stack on W1 (now W1 is on B2, G1 on W1).

6. pickup B1 → holding B1, G on W (constraint1 met).

7. putdown B1.

8. unstack W1 from B2 → but W1 has G1 on top. So you can't unstack W1 from B2 unless W1 is clear. So this approach fails here.

Ah, right. Because after stacking G1 on W1, W1 is not clear. So you can't unstack W1 from B2 unless you first unstack G1 from W1. Which adds more steps.

So this approach requires:

8. unstack G1 from W1 → putdown G1.

9. unstack W1 from B2 → putdown W1 (goal).

10. stack G1 on W1.

But this adds steps and complicates the plan.

Therefore, this approach is not efficient.

Given all these considerations, the most efficient plan seems to be the one where after moving B4 and B3, unstack W1 from B2, stack it on B1 to satisfy the third constraint, then unstack and putdown to achieve the goal, then handle the first constraint by stacking G1 on W1 and picking up B1.

This plan would have the following steps:

1. unstack B4 from B3.

2. putdown B4.

3. unstack B3 from W1.

4. putdown B3.

5. unstack W1 from B2 (holding W1, constraint2).

6. stack W1 on B1 (B1 not clear, satisfies constraint3).

7. unstack W1 from B1.

8. putdown W1 (goal).

9. unstack Y1 from G1.

10. putdown Y1.

11. pickup G1.

12. stack G1 on W1.

13. pickup B1 (constraint1).

14. putdown B1.

This plan has 14 steps. However, maybe there's a way to optimize further.

Wait, after step6 (stack W1 on B1), B1 has W1 on top. Then, in step7, we unstack W1 from B1 (since it's clear). Then putdown W1. So steps6-8 are three steps to move W1 to table, satisfying the goal.

But during step6, we satisfy the third constraint.

Then steps9-14 handle the first constraint and fifth constraint.

Alternatively, can we use B3 or B4 to satisfy the third constraint?

For example, after step5 (holding W1), stack W1 on B4 instead of B1.

Then:

6. stack W1 on B4 (B4 not clear).

7. unstack W1 from B4.

8. putdown W1 (goal).

This would also satisfy the third constraint.

Then proceed to handle constraint1.

But this requires the same number of steps.

Thus, the minimal steps are likely 14, but perhaps there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, during the process of moving B4 and B3, perhaps stack B3 on B1 or B4, which could satisfy the third constraint.

For example:

1. unstack B4 from B3 → putdown.

2. unstack B3 from W1 → stack B3 on B1.

This makes B1 not clear, satisfying the third constraint when we later hold W1.

Then proceed:

3. unstack W1 from B2 → putdown.

4. Now, white_block_1 is on table (goal).

5. handle constraint1: stack G1 on W1 and hold B1.

But steps:

1. unstack B4 from B3 → putdown.

2. unstack B3 from W1 → stack B3 on B1.

3. unstack W1 from B2 → putdown (goal).

Now, constraint3: when holding W1 (step3), after that, B1 has B3 on top (step2), so constraint3 is satisfied.

Then:

4. unstack Y1 from G1 → putdown.

5. pickup G1 → stack on W1.

6. pickup B1 → putdown.

This plan has 6 steps. Let's check:

Step1: unstack B4 from B3 → putdown.

Step2: unstack B3 from W1 → stack B3 on B1. Now, B1 has B3.

Step3: unstack W1 from B2 → putdown. Now, W1 is on table (goal).

Step4: unstack Y1 from G1 → putdown.

Step5: pickup G1 → stack on W1.

Step6: pickup B1 → putdown.

This plan has 6 steps. Let's check all constraints:

Constraint1: step6, holding B1, and step5 stacked G1 on W1. So yes.

Constraint2: step3, holding W1.

Constraint3: step3 (holding W1), after which B1 has B3 on top (step2), so constraint3 is satisfied.

Constraint4: initial state.

Constraint5: after any state where B3 is not on Y1 (which is always true), we need to either move B2 or hold G1. In this plan, step5 holds G1, so satisfied.

This seems to work. But is this valid?

Let's verify each action's preconditions.

Step1: unstack B4 from B3. Preconditions: B4 is on B3, clear, robot empty. Yes.

Step2: unstack B3 from W1. Preconditions: B3 is on W1, clear (yes, since we just unstacked B4 from B3 in step1, but B3 is on W1. Wait, no. After step1, B3 is on W1. So step2: unstack B3 from W1. B3 is on W1, and B3 is clear (since B4 was on top, but we unstacked B4, so B3 is clear). So yes. Robot is empty. So step2 is valid. Then stack B3 on B1. Preconditions: holding B3, and B1 is clear. Initially, B1 is on table and clear. So yes. So stack B3 on B1.

Step3: unstack W1 from B2. Preconditions: W1 is on B2, clear (since B3 was unstacked from W1 in step2, so W1 is clear). Robot is empty. So yes. Unstack W1 from B2 → holding W1. Then putdown W1 → on table. Goal achieved.

Step4: unstack Y1 from G1. Y1 is on G1, clear. Robot empty. Yes. Then putdown.

Step5: pickup G1. G1 is on table, clear (after unstacking Y1). Robot empty. Yes. Stack on W1 (which is on table). B1 is clear (no, B1 has B3 on top). Wait, stack G1 on W1. W1 is on table. Stacking G1 on W1 requires that W1 is clear. Yes, because after step3, W1 is on table and clear. So step5 is valid.

Step6: pickup B1. B1 is on table, but is it clear? B1 has B3 on top from step2. So B1 is not clear. Therefore, pickup B1 is not possible. Oops, this is a mistake.

So in step2, we stacked B3 on B1. So B1 has B3 on top. Therefore, in step6, B1 is not clear, so cannot pickup B1. This invalidates the plan.

Ah, right. So this approach fails because after step2, B1 has B3 on top, making it impossible to pickup B1 later.

Therefore, this plan is invalid.

So the mistake here is that stacking B3 on B1 in step2 makes B1 not clear, which prevents pickup B1 in step6.

Therefore, this approach doesn't work.

Thus, we need to find another way.

Another idea: stack B3 on B4 instead of B1.

Step1: unstack B4 from B3 → putdown.

Step2: unstack B3 from W1 → stack B3 on B4.

Now, B4 has B3 on top.

Step3: unstack W1 from B2 → putdown.

Now, W1 is on table.

Step4: unstack Y1 from G1 → putdown.

Step5: pickup G1 → stack on W1.

Step6: pickup B1 → putdown.

Now, in step6, B1 is clear (on table), so pickup is possible.

This plan has 6 steps.

Checking constraints:

Constraint1: step6 (holding B1) and step5 (G on W1).

Constraint2: step3 (holding W1).

Constraint3: step3 (holding W1), after that, B4 has B3 on top (step2), so not clear. So satisfied.

Constraint4: initial state.

Constraint5: step5 (holding G1) satisfies the fifth constraint.

Yes, this seems valid.

Let's verify each step:

Step1: unstack B4 from B3. Valid.

Step2: unstack B3 from W1. Valid, then stack B3 on B4. B4 is on table and clear (after step1). So stack B3 on B4.

Step3: unstack W1 from B2. W1 is clear (after step2 removed B3). Valid.

Step4: unstack Y1 from G1. Valid.

Step5: pickup G1 (now on table after step4). Stack on W1 (on table and clear). Valid.

Step6: pickup B1 (on table and clear). Valid. Putdown.

This plan works. Let's check constraint1: in step6, when holding B1, G1 is on W1. Yes. So constraint1 met.

Constraint3: during step3 (holding W1), after that, in step2, B4 has B3 on top. So B4 is not clear, satisfying constraint3.

Yes. This plan has 6 steps and meets all constraints.

So this is the optimal plan.
