Okay, let's break this down. The goal is to get yellow_block_1 on top of brown_block_1. We have several constraints to consider.

1.  **Constraint 1:** At some point, purple_block_1 must be on brown_block_1 AND grey_block_2 must be on grey_block_1.
2.  **Constraint 2:** yellow_block_2 must never be on the table.
3.  **Constraint 3:** At some point, we must be holding yellow_block_1.
4.  **Constraint 4:** If we are holding yellow_block_1, then there must be an earlier state where either purple_block_2 is not on the table OR we are holding purple_block_2.

Here's a plan that addresses these constraints:

```
```
unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
putdown grey_block_2
unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
putdown yellow_block_2
unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
putdown yellow_block_1
pickup purple_block_1
stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
pickup grey_block_2
stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
pickup yellow_block_1
stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1
```
