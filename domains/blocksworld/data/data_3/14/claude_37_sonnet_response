Let's break down the problem:

We have 7 blocks:
- grey_block_1
- brown_block_1
- purple_block_1
- yellow_block_1
- grey_block_2
- yellow_block_2
- purple_block_2

The initial state is:
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- purple_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1
- grey_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1
- purple_block_2 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is clear
- yellow_block_2 is clear
- purple_block_2 is clear
- The arm is not holding anything

We can visually represent the initial state as:

```
   grey_block_2         yellow_block_2       purple_block_2
        |                    |                    |
  brown_block_1         yellow_block_1             
        |                    |                    
  grey_block_1          purple_block_1             
        |                    |                    
      table               table                 table
```

The goal is to have yellow_block_1 on top of brown_block_1.

But we also have some constraints:
1. At some point, purple_block_1 must be on top of brown_block_1, and grey_block_2 must be on top of grey_block_1.
2. yellow_block_2 must never be placed on the table.
3. At some point, the arm must be holding yellow_block_1.
4. Before the arm can hold yellow_block_1, it must either have purple_block_2 not on the table or be holding purple_block_2.

Let's think about how to approach this:

First, to have yellow_block_1 on top of brown_block_1 in the final state, we need to:
- Remove grey_block_2 from brown_block_1 (as it's currently on top of brown_block_1).
- Move yellow_block_1 from purple_block_1 to brown_block_1.

To satisfy the constraints:
- At some point, we need to put purple_block_1 on top of brown_block_1. This means brown_block_1 must be clear. We can do this after removing grey_block_2.
- Also, we need to have grey_block_2 on top of grey_block_1. Since grey_block_1 is already on the table and grey_block_2 is initially on brown_block_1, we need to move grey_block_2 from brown_block_1 to grey_block_1.
- We must hold yellow_block_1 at some point. To do this, we'll first need to remove yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1.
- Before holding yellow_block_1, we need to either have purple_block_2 not on the table or hold purple_block_2. Since purple_block_2 is initially on the table, we can simply pick it up.
- yellow_block_2 should never be placed on the table. So, when we remove yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1, we need to place it directly on another block.

Now, let's think about a plan:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Stack grey_block_2 on grey_block_1. (This helps satisfy constraint 1)
3. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1.
   (We need to place yellow_block_2 somewhere, but not on the table due to constraint 2)
4. Stack yellow_block_2 on purple_block_2.
5. Pickup purple_block_2. (This satisfies the precondition for constraint 4)
6. Putdown purple_block_2. (Just to free the arm for the next step)
7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from purple_block_1. (This satisfies constraint 3)
8. Stack yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1. (This achieves the goal)
   But wait, this doesn't satisfy constraint 1 because we haven't put purple_block_1 on top of brown_block_1 yet.

Let's modify the plan:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Stack grey_block_2 on grey_block_1. (This partly satisfies constraint 1)
3. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1.
   (We need to place yellow_block_2 somewhere, but not on the table due to constraint 2)
4. Stack yellow_block_2 on purple_block_2.
5. Pickup purple_block_2. (This satisfies the precondition for constraint 4)
6. Putdown purple_block_2. (Just to free the arm for the next step)
7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from purple_block_1. (This satisfies constraint 3)
8. Pickup purple_block_1.
9. Stack purple_block_1 on brown_block_1. (This fully satisfies constraint 1)
10. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_1. (To make room for yellow_block_1)
11. Stack yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1. (This achieves the goal)

Wait, hold on. I think I see a more efficient solution. Let's revise:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Stack grey_block_2 on grey_block_1. (This partly satisfies constraint 1)
3. Pickup purple_block_2. (This satisfies the precondition for constraint 4)
4. Stack purple_block_2 on brown_block_1.
5. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1.
6. Stack yellow_block_2 on purple_block_2. (Keeps yellow_block_2 off the table, satisfying constraint 2)
7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from purple_block_1. (This satisfies constraint 3)
8. Pickup purple_block_1.
9. Stack purple_block_1 on brown_block_1. (This fully satisfies constraint 1, but wait, there's purple_block_2 already on brown_block_1)

Hmm, I think I'm making a mistake. Let's redraw the initial state and think through this more carefully:

```
   grey_block_2         yellow_block_2       purple_block_2
        |                    |                    |
  brown_block_1         yellow_block_1             
        |                    |                    
  grey_block_1          purple_block_1             
        |                    |                    
      table               table                 table
```

Let's revisit the constraints:
1. At some point, purple_block_1 must be on top of brown_block_1, and grey_block_2 must be on top of grey_block_1.
2. yellow_block_2 must never be placed on the table.
3. At some point, the arm must be holding yellow_block_1.
4. Before the arm can hold yellow_block_1, it must either have purple_block_2 not on the table or be holding purple_block_2.

Now, let's think of a plan:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Stack grey_block_2 on grey_block_1. (This partly satisfies constraint 1)
3. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. (To access yellow_block_1)
4. Stack yellow_block_2 on purple_block_2. (Keeps yellow_block_2 off the table, satisfying constraint 2)
5. Pickup purple_block_2. (This satisfies the precondition for constraint 4)
6. Putdown purple_block_2. (Free the arm)
7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from purple_block_1. (This satisfies constraint 3)
8. Putdown yellow_block_1. (Free the arm)
9. Pickup purple_block_1.
10. Stack purple_block_1 on brown_block_1. (This fully satisfies constraint 1)
11. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_1. (To make room for yellow_block_1)
12. Putdown purple_block_1. (Free the arm)
13. Pickup yellow_block_1.
14. Stack yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1. (This achieves the goal)

Wait, actually, this solution has a problem. When we remove yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1 and place it on purple_block_2, we're putting it on top of purple_block_2, which means purple_block_2 is no longer clear. But constraint 4 says we need to either have purple_block_2 not on the table or be holding purple_block_2 before we can hold yellow_block_1. Let's adjust the plan:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Stack grey_block_2 on grey_block_1. (This partly satisfies constraint 1)
3. Pickup purple_block_2. (This satisfies the precondition for constraint 4)
4. Putdown purple_block_2. (Now constraint 4 is satisfied because we held purple_block_2)
5. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. (To access yellow_block_1)
6. Stack yellow_block_2 on purple_block_2. (Keeps yellow_block_2 off the table, satisfying constraint 2)
7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from purple_block_1. (This satisfies constraint 3)
8. Putdown yellow_block_1. (Free the arm)
9. Pickup purple_block_1.
10. Stack purple_block_1 on brown_block_1. (This fully satisfies constraint 1)
11. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_1. (To make room for yellow_block_1)
12. Putdown purple_block_1. (Free the arm)
13. Pickup yellow_block_1.
14. Stack yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1. (This achieves the goal)

Hmm, this solution doesn't seem very efficient. Maybe there's a shorter way. 

Constraints 3 and 4 say we need to hold yellow_block_1, and before that, we need to either have purple_block_2 not on the table or hold purple_block_2. Constraint 1 says we need to, at some point, have purple_block_1 on brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 on grey_block_1.

Let's try to optimize:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Stack grey_block_2 on grey_block_1. (This partly satisfies constraint 1)
3. Pickup purple_block_2. (This satisfies the precondition for constraint 4)
4. Stack purple_block_2 on purple_block_1. (Keep purple_block_2 off the table)
5. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. (To access yellow_block_1)
6. Stack yellow_block_2 on purple_block_2. (Keeps yellow_block_2 off the table, satisfying constraint 2)
7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from purple_block_1. (This satisfies constraint 3)
8. Stack yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1. (This achieves the goal)

But wait, we haven't satisfied constraint 1 fully because we haven't put purple_block_1 on brown_block_1.

Let's try another approach. Since we need to have purple_block_1 on brown_block_1 at some point, let's do that first, and then achieve the goal.

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Stack grey_block_2 on grey_block_1. (This partly satisfies constraint 1)
3. Pickup purple_block_2. (This satisfies the precondition for constraint 4)
4. Stack purple_block_2 on purple_block_1.
5. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. (To access yellow_block_1)
6. Stack yellow_block_2 on purple_block_2. (Keeps yellow_block_2 off the table, satisfying constraint 2)
7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from purple_block_1. (This satisfies constraint 3)
8. Putdown yellow_block_1. (Free the arm)
9. Pickup purple_block_1.
10. Stack purple_block_1 on brown_block_1. (This fully satisfies constraint 1)
11. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_1. (To make room for yellow_block_1)
12. Putdown purple_block_1. (Free the arm)
13. Pickup yellow_block_1.
14. Stack yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1. (This achieves the goal)

But there's a problem here as well. When we stack purple_block_1 on brown_block_1 in step 10, it should have yellow_block_1 on top of it (from step 7), which would mean purple_block_1 is not clear. But to stack a block on another, the target block must be clear.

Let me redraw the state again after step 6:

```
  yellow_block_2
        |
   purple_block_2
        |
   purple_block_1
        |
       table
       
   yellow_block_1
        |
       table
       
   grey_block_2
        |
   grey_block_1
        |
       table
       
   brown_block_1
        |
       table
```

I think the previous approach seems right now. Let's continue from there:

7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from purple_block_1. (This satisfies constraint 3)
8. Putdown yellow_block_1. (Free the arm)
9. Unstack yellow_block_2 from purple_block_2. (To access purple_block_1)
10. Stack yellow_block_2 on yellow_block_1. (Keeps yellow_block_2 off the table, satisfying constraint 2)
11. Unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1. (To access purple_block_1)
12. Stack purple_block_2 on grey_block_2.
13. Pickup purple_block_1.
14. Stack purple_block_1 on brown_block_1. (This fully satisfies constraint 1)
15. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_1. (To make room for yellow_block_1)
16. Putdown purple_block_1. (Free the arm)
17. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. (To access yellow_block_1)
18. Stack yellow_block_2 on purple_block_1. (Keeps yellow_block_2 off the table, satisfying constraint 2)
19. Pickup yellow_block_1.
20. Stack yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1. (This achieves the goal)

Ok, wait. From the problem as given, I initially misunderstood the layout. Let me trace through the initial state from the problem description:

```
"grey_block_1 is on the table"
"brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1"
"purple_block_1 is on the table"
"yellow_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1"
"grey_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1"
"yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1"
"purple_block_2 is on the table"
```

So the initial state is:

```
   grey_block_2         yellow_block_2       
        |                     |                    
  brown_block_1         yellow_block_1       purple_block_2
        |                     |                    |
  grey_block_1          purple_block_1             
        |                     |                    
      table                 table                table
```

Now, with the correct initial state, let's revise our plan:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Stack grey_block_2 on grey_block_1. (This partly satisfies constraint 1)
3. Pickup purple_block_2. (This satisfies the precondition for constraint 4)
4. Stack purple_block_2 on brown_block_1.
5. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. (To access yellow_block_1)
6. Stack yellow_block_2 on purple_block_2. (Keeps yellow_block_2 off the table, satisfying constraint 2)
7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from purple_block_1. (This satisfies constraint 3)
8. Putdown yellow_block_1. (Free the arm)
9. Pickup purple_block_1.
10. Stack purple_block_1 on purple_block_2. (Now, at this moment, purple_block_1 is not on brown_block_1, so constraint 1 is not fully satisfied)

Let me redraw the state:

```
   purple_block_1
        |
   yellow_block_2
        |
   purple_block_2
        |
   brown_block_1
        |
      table
      
   yellow_block_1
        |
      table
      
   grey_block_2
        |
   grey_block_1
        |
      table
```

Oops, I made a mistake in step 10. Let's correct and continue:

10. Unstack yellow_block_2 from purple_block_2. (To access purple_block_2)
11. Stack yellow_block_2 on yellow_block_1. (Keeps yellow_block_2 off the table, satisfying constraint 2)
12. Unstack purple_block_2 from brown_block_1. (To make room for purple_block_1)
13. Stack purple_block_2 on yellow_block_2.
14. Pickup purple_block_1.
15. Stack purple_block_1 on brown_block_1. (This fully satisfies constraint 1)
16. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_1. (To make room for yellow_block_1)
17. Stack purple_block_1 on purple_block_2.
18. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. (To access yellow_block_1)
19. Stack yellow_block_2 on purple_block_1. (Keeps yellow_block_2 off the table, satisfying constraint 2)
20. Pickup yellow_block_1.
21. Stack yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1. (This achieves the goal)

Actually, let me check step 17, since I'm not sure if purple_block_1 can be stacked on purple_block_2 if purple_block_2 itself is not clear (it has yellow_block_2 on top). Let me trace the state again:

After step 16:

```
   yellow_block_2
        |
   purple_block_2
        |
     yellow_block_1
        |
      table
      
   brown_block_1
        |
      table
      
   grey_block_2
        |
   grey_block_1
        |
      table
      
    purple_block_1
        |
      table
```

So purple_block_2 is not clear, so we can't stack purple_block_1 on it. Let's revise:

17. Putdown purple_block_1. (Free the arm)
18. Unstack yellow_block_2 from purple_block_2. (To access yellow_block_1)
19. Stack yellow_block_2 on purple_block_1. (Keeps yellow_block_2 off the table, satisfying constraint 2)
20. Pickup yellow_block_1.
21. Stack yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1. (This achieves the goal)

This plan seems to work. However, it's quite long. Let's see if we can optimize it:

Since constraint 1 states that at some point, purple_block_1 must be on top of brown_block_1 and grey_block_2 must be on top of grey_block_1, we can first focus on achieving these intermediate goals before placing yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1.

Constraint 4 says that before we can hold yellow_block_1, we need to either have purple_block_2 not on the table or hold purple_block_2. So, we can start by addressing this constraint.

Let's try a different approach:

1. Pickup purple_block_2. (This satisfies the precondition for constraint 4)
2. Putdown purple_block_2. (Now constraint 4 is satisfied because we held purple_block_2)
3. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1.
4. Stack grey_block_2 on grey_block_1. (This partly satisfies constraint 1)
5. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. (To access yellow_block_1)
6. Stack yellow_block_2 on purple_block_2. (Keeps yellow_block_2 off the table, satisfying constraint 2)
7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from purple_block_1. (This satisfies constraint 3)
8. Putdown yellow_block_1. (Free the arm)
9. Pickup purple_block_1.
10. Stack purple_block_1 on brown_block_1. (This fully satisfies constraint 1)
11. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_1. (To make room for yellow_block_1)
12. Putdown purple_block_1. (Free the arm)
13. Pickup yellow_block_1.
14. Stack yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1. (This achieves the goal)

Yet, it's still lengthy. Let's analyze the constraints again and see if there's an even shorter plan:

Constraint 1: At some point, purple_block_1 must be on top of brown_block_1, and grey_block_2 must be on top of grey_block_1.
Constraint 2: yellow_block_2 must never be placed on the table.
Constraint 3: At some point, the arm must be holding yellow_block_1.
Constraint 4: Before the arm can hold yellow_block_1, it must either have purple_block_2 not on the table or be holding purple_block_2.

Given these constraints, to achieve the goal of having yellow_block_1 on top of brown_block_1, we minimally need:
1. Clear brown_block_1 by removing grey_block_2.
2. Satisfy constraint 1 by placing purple_block_1 on brown_block_1 at some point, and grey_block_2 on grey_block_1.
3. Satisfy constraint 4 by either holding or moving purple_block_2.
4. Satisfy constraint 3 by holding yellow_block_1.
5. Keep yellow_block_2 off the table throughout.

I'll now try to design a minimal plan:

1. Pickup purple_block_2. (This satisfies the precondition for constraint 4, as we're holding purple_block_2)
2. Stack purple_block_2 on brown_block_1.
3. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1.
4. Stack grey_block_2 on grey_block_1. (This partly satisfies constraint 1)
5. Unstack purple_block_2 from brown_block_1.
6. Stack purple_block_2 on grey_block_2.
7. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. (To access yellow_block_1)
8. Stack yellow_block_2 on purple_block_2. (Keeps yellow_block_2 off the table, satisfying constraint 2)
9. Unstack yellow_block_1 from purple_block_1. (This satisfies constraint 3)
10. Putdown yellow_block_1. (Free the arm)
11. Pickup purple_block_1.
12. Stack purple_block_1 on brown_block_1. (This fully satisfies constraint 1)
13. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_1. (To make room for yellow_block_1)
14. Putdown purple_block_1. (Free the arm)
15. Pickup yellow_block_1.
16. Stack yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1. (This achieves the goal)

Still quite long, but it avoids some redundant steps.

Wait, do we really need to place purple_block_1 on brown_block_1 and then remove it? Constraint 1 only requires these conditions to be true at some point, not necessarily in the final state.

Let's revise our plan focusing on minimizing steps:

1. Pickup purple_block_2. (This satisfies the precondition for constraint 4, as we're holding purple_block_2)
2. Stack purple_block_2 on grey_block_2.
3. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1.
4. Stack grey_block_2 on grey_block_1. (This partly satisfies constraint 1)
5. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. (To access yellow_block_1)
6. Stack yellow_block_2 on purple_block_2. (Keeps yellow_block_2 off the table, satisfying constraint 2)
7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from purple_block_1. (This satisfies constraint 3)
8. Putdown yellow_block_1. (Free the arm)
9. Pickup purple_block_1.
10. Stack purple_block_1 on brown_block_1. (This fully satisfies constraint 1)
11. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_1. (To make room for yellow_block_1)
12. Putdown purple_block_1. (Free the arm)
13. Pickup yellow_block_1.
14. Stack yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1. (This achieves the goal)

Actually, in step 2, purple_block_2 can't be stacked on grey_block_2 because grey_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1 at that point. I need to be more careful.

Let's try a slightly different approach:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Stack grey_block_2 on grey_block_1. (This partly satisfies constraint 1)
3. Pickup purple_block_2. (This satisfies the precondition for constraint 4)
4. Stack purple_block_2 on grey_block_2.
5. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. (To access yellow_block_1)
6. Stack yellow_block_2 on purple_block_2. (Keeps yellow_block_2 off the table, satisfying constraint 2)
7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from purple_block_1. (This satisfies constraint 3)
8. Putdown yellow_block_1. (Free the arm)
9. Pickup purple_block_1.
10. Stack purple_block_1 on brown_block_1. (This fully satisfies constraint 1)
11. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_1. (To make room for yellow_block_1)
12. Putdown purple_block_1. (Free the arm)
13. Pickup yellow_block_1.
14. Stack yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1. (This achieves the goal)

This plan seems to be pretty efficient and adheres to all constraints. Let's double-check for redundancy:

Steps 3-4: We need to (hold or move) purple_block_2 before holding yellow_block_1 (constraint 4).
Steps 5-6: We need to keep yellow_block_2 off the table (constraint 2).
Steps 7-8: We need to hold yellow_block_1 at some point (constraint 3).
Steps 9-10: We need to place purple_block_1 on brown_block_1 (constraint 1).
Steps 11-12: We need to make room for yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1.
Steps 13-14: We place yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1 (goal).

However, there's a potential issue with steps 9-10. At this point, brown_block_1 is clear, but purple_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on top of it, so it's not clear. However, in our trace, we had removed yellow_block_1 from purple_block_1 in steps 7-8.

Therefore, I think our plan is correct.

Actually, wait. Let me redraw our initial state for clarity:

```
   grey_block_2         yellow_block_2       
        |                     |                    
  brown_block_1         yellow_block_1        purple_block_2
        |                     |                    |
  grey_block_1          purple_block_1             
        |                     |                    
      table                 table                table
```

Starting from the initial state, let's trace through the plan step by step:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1.
   - Resulting state:
     ```
       grey_block_2          yellow_block_2       
           |                     |                    
           *               yellow_block_1        purple_block_2
                                |                    |
     brown_block_1        purple_block_1             
           |                    |                    
     grey_block_1              table                table
           |
         table
     ```
     (* means block in the robotic arm)

2. Stack grey_block_2 on grey_block_1. (This partly satisfies constraint 1)
   - Resulting state:
     ```
                         yellow_block_2       
                              |                    
                         yellow_block_1        purple_block_2
                              |                    |
     grey_block_2        purple_block_1             
           |                  |                    
     grey_block_1            table                table
           |
         table
         
     brown_block_1
           |
         table
     ```

3. Pickup purple_block_2. (This satisfies the precondition for constraint 4)
   - Resulting state:
     ```
                         yellow_block_2       
                              |                    
                         yellow_block_1        purple_block_2
                              |                    |
     grey_block_2        purple_block_1             *
           |                  |                    
     grey_block_1            table                
           |
         table
         
     brown_block_1
           |
         table
     ```

   - Resulting state:
     ```
                         yellow_block_2       
                              |                    
                         yellow_block_1        
                              |                    
     purple_block_2      purple_block_1             
           |                  |                    
     grey_block_2            table                
           |
     grey_block_1
           |
         table
         
     brown_block_1
           |
         table
     ```

5. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1. (To access yellow_block_1)
   - Resulting state:
     ```
                         yellow_block_2       
                              |                    
                              *            
                                                  
     purple_block_2      yellow_block_1             
           |                  |                    
     grey_block_2        purple_block_1                
           |                  |
     grey_block_1            table
           |
         table
         
     brown_block_1
           |

      grey_block_1            *                
            |                
          table            purple_block_1
                                 |
                               table
          
      brown_block_1
            |
          table
      ```

14. Stack yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1. (This achieves the goal)
    - Resulting state:
      ```
      yellow_block_2       
            |                    
      purple_block_2                  
            |                                        
      grey_block_2                  
            |                                   
      grey_block_1      purple_block_1                
            |                |
          table            table
          
      yellow_block_1
            |
      brown_block_1
            |
          table
      ```

The plan works, adheres to all constraints, and achieves the goal.

To recap the constraints:
1. At some point, purple_block_1 must be on top of brown_block_1, and grey_block_2 must be on top of grey_block_1.
   - Satisfied in step 10.
2. yellow_block_2 must never be placed on the table.
   - Satisfied throughout the plan.
3. At some point, the arm must be holding yellow_block_1.
   - Satisfied in step 7 and again in step 13.
4. Before the arm can hold yellow_block_1, it must either have purple_block_2 not on the table or be holding purple_block_2.
   - Satisfied in step 3, before step 7.

I believe this is the minimum number of steps needed to achieve the goal while satisfying all constraints. Let's double-check one more time to ensure there are no shortcuts.

I'm trying to see if there's a way to avoid removing purple_block_1 from brown_block_1, but I don't think it's possible, as purple_block_1 and yellow_block_1 can't be on brown_block_1 simultaneously.

Similarly, I don't see any way to reduce the number of times we move the blocks.

Ok, so the final plan:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_1.
2. Stack grey_block_2 on grey_block_1.
3. Pickup purple_block_2.
4. Stack purple_block_2 on grey_block_2.
5. Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1.
6. Stack yellow_block_2 on purple_block_2.
7. Unstack yellow_block_1 from purple_block_1.
8. Putdown yellow_block_1.
9. Pickup purple_block_1.
10. Stack purple_block_1 on brown_block_1.
11. Unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_1.
12. Putdown purple_block_1.
13. Pickup yellow_block_1.
14. Stack yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1.

In more formal notation:

1. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_1
2. stack grey_block_2 grey_block_1
3. pickup purple_block_2
4. stack purple_block_2 grey_block_2
5. unstack yellow_block_2 yellow_block_1
6. stack yellow_block_2 purple_block_2
7. unstack yellow_block_1 purple_block_1
8. putdown yellow_block_1
9. pickup purple_block_1
10. stack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
11. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_1
12. putdown purple_block_1
13. pickup yellow_block_1
14. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1
