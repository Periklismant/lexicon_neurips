Okay, let's see. I need to solve this Blocksworld planning problem with some specific constraints. The goal is to have green_block_2 on top of orange_block_1. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

First, the initial state:

- orange_block_1 is on the table, with purple_block_1 on top of it, and purple is clear.
- brown_block_1 is on the table with red_block_1 on top, red is clear.
- green_block_1 is on the table with grey_block_1 on top, grey is clear.
- green_block_2 is on the table and clear.
- The arm is empty.

The goal is green_block_2 on orange_block_1. So, I need to stack green_block_2 onto orange_block_1. But orange_block_1 currently has purple_block_1 on top. So first, I need to remove purple_block_1 from orange_block_1 to make orange_block_1 clear. Then, put green_block_2 on it.

But there are constraints to satisfy. Let's list them:

1. At some state, purple_block_1 must not be clear (something on top of it).
2. If purple_block_1 is not clear, then earlier there must be either brown_block_1 clear or green_block_2 on purple_block_1.
3. At some state, purple_block_1 must be on the table.
4. If purple_block_1 is on the table, then earlier either orange_block_1 is on grey_block_1 or the arm is holding orange_block_1.
5. At some state, green_block_2 must not be clear (something on top of it).
6. If green_block_2 is not clear, then earlier either holding green_block_1 or grey_block_1 is on orange_block_1.

So, the plan needs to include steps that satisfy these constraints.

Let's start with the main goal. To get green_block_2 onto orange_block_1, I need to:

1. Unstack purple_block_1 from orange_block_1 and put it down.
2. Then stack green_block_2 onto orange_block_1.

But let's check the constraints.

First, constraint 3: purple_block_1 must be on the table at some point. Well, if we unstack it and put it down, that's satisfied. But constraint 4 says that when purple is on the table, earlier either orange is on grey or holding orange. But initially, orange is on the table. So to have orange on grey, we'd have to stack orange on grey. But grey is on green_block_1. Alternatively, the arm could be holding orange_block_1. But how?

Wait, the initial state has orange_block_1 on table with purple on it. To unstack purple, we need to do unstack purple orange. But for that, purple must be clear (which it is). So unstack purple_block_1 from orange_block_1. Then put it down. That would make purple on table, satisfying constraint 3. But when we do that, constraint 4 requires that before purple is on the table, either orange is on grey or the arm is holding orange. But when we unstack purple from orange, the arm is holding purple. So after unstack, we put it down. So the state where purple is on the table is after the putdown. The earlier state (before putdown) would be when the arm is holding purple. So the state where the arm is holding purple is before the putdown. But constraint 4 says that when purple is on the table, there must be an earlier state where either orange is on grey or holding orange. But in that case, the earlier state would be when we unstacked purple. At that time, the arm is holding purple. So the condition would have to be met before the putdown. So during the unstack action, the arm is holding purple. But orange_block_1 is on the table. So neither of the conditions (orange on grey or holding orange) are true. Therefore, this plan would violate constraint 4.

Hmm, this is a problem. So just unstacking purple and putting it down would make purple on the table, but the condition for constraint 4 would not be met. Therefore, we need to satisfy that when purple is on the table, there was a prior state where either orange is on grey or holding orange.

So, how can we get either of those conditions true before putting purple on the table?

Option 1: Hold orange_block_1 at some point before putting purple on the table.

But to hold orange_block_1, we need to pick it up. But initially, there's purple on top of orange. So to pick up orange, we need to first remove purple. Wait, but that's a chicken and egg problem. So we can't pick up orange until purple is removed. But if we unstack purple from orange, then put it down, we can then pick up orange. But the putdown of purple would already have happened, so that's after the unstack. But the constraint requires that when purple is on the table, there was an earlier state (before that) where either orange is on grey or holding orange. So if after unstacking purple and before putting it down, the arm is holding purple. But during that time, the arm is holding purple, not orange. So that doesn't help.

Alternative approach: Maybe after unstacking purple from orange, instead of putting it down immediately, we need to stack it onto another block, but that might complicate things. But perhaps that's necessary to satisfy constraints.

Wait, let's think. Let's say after unstacking purple from orange, we need to stack it onto another block. Let's say we stack purple on, say, green_block_2. Then, that would make purple not clear (since something is on top of it? No, if we stack purple on green_block_2, then green_block_2 would have purple on top, so green_block_2 is not clear. But purple would be clear. Wait, no: when you stack x on y, x is placed on y, so y is no longer clear. So stacking purple on green_block_2 would make green_block_2 not clear, and purple is clear.

But then, if we stack purple on green_block_2, then in that state, purple is on green_block_2, which is on the table. Then later, we can unstack purple from green_block_2 and put it on the table. But that might complicate the steps.

Alternatively, maybe we need to have orange_block_1 be moved onto grey_block_1 at some point. So, let's consider that. To stack orange_block_1 onto grey_block_1, we need to pick up orange_block_1. But initially, purple is on orange. So first, unstack purple from orange, put purple down. Then pick up orange, stack on grey. Then, when we put purple on the table, after that, perhaps. Wait, but when do we need to have purple on the table? Let me think again.

The constraint 3 requires that purple is on the table at least once. So in the initial state, purple is on orange, not on table. So during the plan, we must have a state where purple is on the table. For example, when we unstack purple and put it down. So that would satisfy constraint 3. But then the condition for constraint 4 must be met: when purple is on the table, there must have been an earlier state where either orange is on grey or holding orange.

So, if after putting purple on the table, we then pick up orange and stack it on grey, that would not satisfy the condition because the state where purple is on the table occurs before orange is on grey. So the earlier state (before purple is on table) must have the condition. Therefore, the sequence must be:

1. Do something that makes orange on grey or hold orange, then put purple on the table.

But how?

Wait, initially, orange has purple on top. So to hold orange, you need to first remove purple. But if you unstack purple from orange and then put it down, then you can pick up orange. But the act of putting purple down (making it on the table) would be the state where constraint 3 is satisfied. However, at that point, the earlier state (before putting purple down) is when you are holding purple. So during that time, you're holding purple, not orange. Therefore, the condition for constraint 4 (either orange is on grey or holding orange) must be true before the state where purple is on the table.

So, perhaps before putting purple on the table, we need to have a state where orange is on grey or the arm is holding orange. But how?

Wait, perhaps after unstacking purple from orange (so holding purple), we need to stack purple somewhere else, then pick up orange and put it on grey, then put purple on the table. But let's outline that.

Sequence:

1. unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1 → holding purple.
2. stack purple_block_1 some_block (maybe green_block_2?), but need to check preconditions. To stack purple on another block, that block must be clear. Initially, green_block_2 is clear. So stack purple on green_block_2. Now, green_block_2 has purple on top. Now, purple is on green_block_2, which is on table. So purple is on table indirectly? No, green_block_2 is on table, purple is on green_block_2. So purple is not on the table. So constraint 3 (purple on table) is not yet satisfied. Then, later, we need to put purple on table.

But perhaps this is getting complicated. Alternatively, after unstacking purple from orange, put it down. Then, pick up orange and stack it on grey. Then, put purple back on the table. Wait, but putting purple on the table would be after stacking orange on grey. So when we put purple on the table, the earlier state (before that) would have orange on grey. So constraint 4 would be satisfied because in the earlier state (when we stacked orange on grey), orange is on grey, so the condition holds.

But let's see:

Step 1: unstack purple from orange → holding purple.
Step 2: putdown purple → purple is on table. Now, constraint 3 is satisfied (purple on table). But constraint 4 requires that before this, there was a state where orange is on grey or holding orange. But before step 2 (putdown purple), we have step 1: holding purple. So in step 1, after unstacking, the arm is holding purple. At that point, orange is on the table. So neither orange is on grey, nor is the arm holding orange. So constraint 4 is not met. Therefore, this approach doesn't work.

Hmm. So maybe we need to put purple on the table after having moved orange onto grey or holding orange. How?

Alternative approach: First, unstack purple from orange and hold it. Then, instead of putting it down immediately, we stack it onto another block, say brown_block_1. But brown_block_1 has red_block_1 on top. So to stack purple on brown_block_1, red must be clear. Wait, red is on brown_block_1 and is clear. So to stack purple on brown_block_1, we need to unstack red first. Wait, this is getting too complicated. Let's think differently.

Another constraint is constraint 1: at some state, purple_block_1 is not clear (something on top). So after moving purple from orange to another location, perhaps we need to put something on top of purple. But how?

Let's think of the steps needed for the main goal:

To stack green_block_2 on orange_block_1, we need orange_block_1 to be clear. Initially, purple is on orange. So steps:

1. unstack purple_block_1 from orange_block_1 → holding purple.
2. putdown purple_block_1 → purple on table. Now, orange is clear.
3. pickup green_block_2 → holding green_block_2.
4. stack green_block_2 orange_block_1 → done. Goal achieved.

But this plan doesn't satisfy the constraints.

Let's check constraints:

Constraint 1: purple must be not clear at some state. In this plan, purple is on table after step 2, and remains there. So it's clear (since nothing is on top). So constraint 1 is not satisfied.

Constraint 3: purple on table is achieved in step 2. So constraint 3 is satisfied. But constraint 4 requires that before step 2, there was a state where either orange is on grey or holding orange. In this plan, before step 2 (putdown purple), we have step 1 (unstack), after which the arm is holding purple. So during step 1, the arm is holding purple, not orange. And orange is on table. So no, that doesn't meet constraint 4. So this plan fails constraints 1 and 4.

So we need to adjust the plan to meet all constraints.

Let's tackle constraint 4 first. To satisfy constraint 4, when we put purple on the table (step 2 in previous plan), there must be an earlier state where either orange is on grey or the arm is holding orange. So perhaps after unstacking purple, instead of putting it down, we need to do something else that allows us to hold orange or stack it on grey.

But to hold orange, we need to pick it up. But after unstacking purple, orange is on the table and clear. So we can pick it up. Let's try:

1. unstack purple from orange → holding purple.
2. putdown purple → purple on table. (But this violates constraint 4, as before.)
Alternative step 2: stack purple on some other block, but then we need to make sure that later we put purple on the table.

Wait, perhaps:

1. unstack purple from orange → holding purple.
2. stack purple on green_block_2 → now purple is on green_block_2. Now, green_block_2 is not clear. This satisfies constraint 1 (purple is not clear? Wait, no. purple is on top of green_block_2, so purple is clear (since nothing is on top of it), and green_block_2 is not clear. So constraint 1 requires that purple is not clear (i.e., something is on top of purple). So this doesn't satisfy constraint 1. So this step doesn't help.

Alternatively, after stacking purple on green_block_2, we can put another block on top of purple. But that would require another block. Let's see available blocks: grey_block_1 is on green_block_1. If we unstack grey from green_block_1, then we can stack it on purple.

So steps:

1. unstack purple from orange → holding purple.
2. stack purple on green_block_2 → now green_block_2 has purple.
3. unstack grey from green_block_1 → holding grey.
4. stack grey on purple → now purple has grey on top, so purple is not clear. This satisfies constraint 1 (since there's a block on purple). Then, we need to ensure that when constraint 1 is met (grey on purple), the earlier state must have brown_block_1 clear or green_block_2 on purple. In this case, when we stack grey on purple (step 4), the earlier state (before step 4) would be after step 3 (holding grey). At that time, green_block_2 is on purple (step 2) → no, after step 2, purple is on green_block_2, so green_block_2 is under purple. So green_block_2 is on the table, with purple on top. Then, step 3 unstack grey from green_block_1. So at step 4, we stack grey on purple (which is on green_block_2). So the condition for constraint 2 (if purple is not clear, then earlier either brown_block_1 is clear or green_block_2 is on purple). In this case, when we stack grey on purple, the earlier state (before step 4) is after step 3, where we have purple on green_block_2. So green_block_2 is on purple? No, purple is on green_block_2. So the condition would require that in an earlier state, green_block_2 is on purple, but that's not the case. So maybe this approach doesn't satisfy constraint 2.

Alternatively, perhaps after stacking purple on green_block_2, we can stack green_block_2 on another block, but that might not help.

This is getting complex. Let's try to approach each constraint step by step.

Constraints:

1. Purple must be not clear at some point. So something must be on top of purple.
2. If purple is not clear, then earlier, brown_block_1 must be clear or green_block_2 is on purple.
3. Purple must be on the table at some point.
4. If purple is on the table, then earlier, orange is on grey or holding orange.
5. Green_block_2 must be not clear at some point.
6. If green_block_2 is not clear, then earlier, holding green_block_1 or grey is on orange.

Main goal: green_block_2 on orange_block_1.

Let's try to find a plan that satisfies all.

First, for constraint 3: purple must be on table. So at some point, we need to put purple on the table. Let's say we unstack purple from orange and put it down. Then, later, perhaps pick it up again and put it back. But we need to make sure that when we put it down, the condition for constraint 4 is met.

Constraint 4: When purple is on the table, earlier, either orange is on grey or holding orange.

So, to satisfy constraint 4, perhaps before putting purple on the table, we need to have orange on grey or hold orange. Let's see:

Option: After unstacking purple from orange, instead of putting it down immediately, we need to first do something else that makes orange be on grey or hold orange.

How can we hold orange? After unstacking purple, orange is clear. So we can pick up orange. But after unstacking purple, the arm is holding purple. So to pick up orange, we need to put down purple first. But if we put down purple, then we have to check constraint 4. Let's see:

Scenario:

1. unstack purple from orange → holding purple.
2. putdown purple → purple on table (constraint 3 met). Now, to satisfy constraint 4, before step 2, there must be a state where orange is on grey or holding orange. But before step 2, in step 1, the arm is holding purple. So no. So this violates constraint 4.

Therefore, we need to find a way to have orange on grey or hold orange before putting purple on the table.

Alternative approach:

After unstacking purple from orange (step 1: holding purple), we need to stack purple somewhere temporarily, then pick up orange, stack it on grey, and then put purple on the table.

So:

1. unstack purple from orange → holding purple.
2. stack purple on green_block_2 → now purple is on green_block_2. (green_block_2 is not clear anymore)
3. pickup orange_block_1 → now holding orange.
4. stack orange_block_1 on grey_block_1 → orange is on grey.
5. unstack purple from green_block_2 → holding purple.
6. putdown purple → purple on table (constraint 3 met).

Now, when step 6 (putdown purple) is done, the earlier state (step 4) has orange on grey. So constraint 4 is satisfied because before putting purple on the table, orange was on grey.

Then, proceed to achieve the main goal:

7. unstack orange_block_1 from grey_block_1 → holding orange.
8. putdown orange_block_1 → orange on table, clear.
9. pickup green_block_2 → holding green_block_2.
10. stack green_block_2 on orange_block_1 → goal achieved.

But wait, after step 2, green_block_2 has purple on top. So in step 9, we need to unstack purple from green_block_2 first. But in the current steps, after step 5, we unstack purple from green_block_2 and put it down. So green_block_2 would be clear again. So step 9: green_block_2 is clear. So pickup green_block_2 is possible.

But let's check the steps again:

1. unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1 → holding purple.
2. stack purple_block_1 green_block_2 → purple on green_block_2. Now, green_block_2 is not clear.
3. pickup orange_block_1 → needs orange to be clear and on table. After step 1, orange is on table and clear. So yes.
4. stack orange_block_1 grey_block_1 → orange on grey. Now, grey was on green_block_1. So grey is not clear anymore.
5. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2 → holding purple. Precondition: purple is on green_block_2 and clear. After step 2, purple is on green_block_2, and since nothing is stacked on it, purple is clear. Yes.
6. putdown purple_block_1 → purple on table. Now, constraint 3 satisfied. And before this step (step 6), step 4 had orange on grey, satisfying constraint 4.

Now, to achieve the main goal:

7. unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1 → holding orange. Precondition: orange is on grey and clear. After step 4, orange is on grey. Since nothing is stacked on orange, it's clear. Yes.
8. putdown orange_block_1 → orange on table.
9. pickup green_block_2 → possible since green_block_2 is on table and clear (after step 6, purple is on table, green_block_2 is clear).
10. stack green_block_2 orange_block_1 → goal achieved.

Now, check constraints:

Constraint 1: purple must be not clear at some state. When is purple not clear? In step 2, purple is on green_block_2 and is clear. After step 5, we unstack purple, so green_block_2 is clear again. So during step 2-5, purple is on green_block_2 and is clear. So no block is on top of purple. So constraint 1 is not satisfied. Therefore, this plan is missing that.

So we need to have a state where purple is not clear. How?

We need to have something on top of purple. So perhaps after stacking purple on green_block_2 (step 2), we need to stack another block on top of purple.

But which block? Available blocks: red_block_1 is on brown_block_1. grey is on green_block_1 with orange on top. So after step 4, orange is on grey. So grey is under orange. So grey is not clear. So to get another block, maybe use red_block_1.

Let's adjust the plan:

After step 2 (purple on green_block_2), stack red_block_1 on purple_block_1.

But to do that, we need to first unstack red_block_1 from brown_block_1.

So:

1. unstack purple from orange → holding purple.
2. stack purple on green_block_2 → purple on green_block_2.
3. unstack red_block_1 from brown_block_1 → holding red.
4. stack red_block_1 on purple_block_1 → red on purple. Now, purple is not clear (constraint 1 satisfied).
   Now, constraint 2: when purple is not clear (step 4), earlier state must have brown_block_1 clear or green_block_2 on purple. When we unstack red from brown_block_1 (step 3), brown_block_1 becomes clear. So before step 4 (when we stack red on purple), step 3 makes brown_block_1 clear. So constraint 2 is satisfied because in step 3, brown_block_1 is clear.

Then proceed:

5. pickup orange_block_1 → since orange is on table and clear.
6. stack orange_block_1 on grey_block_1 → orange on grey.
7. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2 → but purple has red on top. So cannot unstack purple unless red is clear. So need to unstack red first.

So:

5. unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1 → holding red.
6. putdown red_block_1 → red on table.
7. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2 → holding purple.
8. putdown purple_block_1 → purple on table (constraint 3). Before this, step 6 had orange on grey (from step 6?), wait:

Wait, the steps after step 4 (stack red on purple):

4. stack red on purple → purple not clear.
5. unstack red from purple → holding red.
6. putdown red.
7. unstack purple from green_block_2 → holding purple.
8. putdown purple → purple on table (constraint 3). Before step 8, step 7 is unstack purple, which requires purple to be clear. But after step 5, red is removed from purple, so purple is clear. So unstacking is possible.

But after step 8, purple is on table. Then, need to stack green_block_2 on orange_block_1. But orange is on grey. So:

9. unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1 → holding orange.
10. putdown orange_block_1 → on table.
11. pickup green_block_2 → needs to be clear. After step 8, green_block_2 is clear (since purple was unstacked in step 7).
12. stack green_block_2 orange_block_1 → goal.

Now, checking constraints:

Constraint 1: purple has red on top in step 4. Satisfied.

Constraint 2: when purple is not clear (step 4), earlier state (step 3: unstack red from brown_block_1) makes brown_block_1 clear. So condition met.

Constraint 3: step 8 puts purple on table. Satisfied.

Constraint 4: when purple is on table (step 8), earlier state (step 6: orange on grey via step 6?) Wait, in this plan, after step 4, we have:

Step 4: stack red on purple.
Step 5: unstack red from purple.
Step 6: putdown red.
Step 7: unstack purple from green_block_2.
Step 8: putdown purple.

But when does orange get stacked on grey? Oh, in this adjusted plan, we haven't done that yet. So the earlier steps after step 4 are:

We need to stack orange on grey before step 8.

So inserting steps to stack orange on grey:

After step 8, we have to pick up orange, but initially, after step 1, orange is on table. But in this current plan, after step 1, we did:

1. unstack purple from orange → holding purple.
2. stack purple on green_block_2.
3. unstack red from brown_block_1 → holding red.
4. stack red on purple.
5. unstack red from purple → holding red.
6. putdown red.
7. unstack purple from green_block_2 → holding purple.
8. putdown purple → purple on table.

At this point, orange is still on the table, clear. So we can:

9. pickup orange_block_1.
10. stack orange_block_1 on grey_block_1 → orange on grey.
Now, constraint 4 is triggered when purple is on table (step 8). Before step 8, we need a state where orange is on grey or holding orange. But step 10 (stacking orange on grey) comes after step 8. So this doesn't satisfy constraint 4. Because when we putdown purple in step 8, the earlier states (steps 1-7) do not have orange on grey or holding orange.

So this approach doesn't work. We need to stack orange on grey before putting purple on the table.

Let's reorganize:

1. unstack purple from orange → holding purple.
2. stack purple on green_block_2.
3. unstack red from brown_block_1 → holding red.
4. stack red on purple → purple not clear (constraint 1).
5. unstack red from purple → holding red.
6. putdown red.
7. pickup orange_block_1 → holding orange.
8. stack orange on grey → orange on grey.
9. unstack purple from green_block_2 → holding purple.
10. putdown purple → purple on table (constraint 3). Now, before step 10, step 8 has orange on grey. So constraint 4 is met.
11. unstack orange from grey → holding orange.
12. putdown orange → on table.
13. pickup green_block_2.
14. stack green_block_2 on orange → goal.

Now, check constraints:

Constraint 1: step 4 (red on purple) → purple not clear. Satisfied.

Constraint 2: when purple not clear (step 4), earlier state (step 3: unstack red from brown, making brown clear). Satisfied.

Constraint 3: step 10 puts purple on table. Satisfied.

Constraint 4: step 10 (purple on table) has step 8 (orange on grey) before it. Satisfied.

Constraint 5: green_block_2 must be not clear at some point. When? In step 2, green_block_2 has purple. So from step 2 until step 9 (when unstack purple), green_block_2 is not clear. So this satisfies constraint 5.

Constraint 6: when green_block_2 is not clear (step 2-9), earlier state must have holding green_block_1 or grey on orange. Let's see. When is green_block_2 not clear? From step 2 onwards. The earliest state where green_block_2 is not clear is step 2. Before that, the initial state has grey on green_block_1. So in the initial state, green_block_1 has grey on top. So to satisfy constraint 6: if green_block_2 is not clear (step 2), then before that, there must be a state where either holding green_block_1 or grey on orange. In the initial state, grey is on green_block_1. So before step 2, the only relevant state is step 1 (unstack purple from orange). At that time, grey is still on green_block_1. So does grey on green_block_1 count towards "grey_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1"? No. Because grey is on green_block_1, not orange. So no. So constraint 6 is not satisfied.

Hmm. So constraint 6 says that whenever green_block_2 is not clear, there must have been an earlier state where either holding green_block_1 or grey is on orange.

In the current plan, green_block_2 becomes not clear in step 2. Before step 2, the only action is step 1 (unstack purple from orange). At that point, grey is on green_block_1. So the condition for constraint 6 is not met, because neither holding green_block_1 nor grey is on orange.

So this plan violates constraint 6. Therefore, we need to adjust.

To satisfy constraint 6, when green_block_2 is not clear (from step 2 onwards), there must have been an earlier state where either holding green_block_1 or grey is on orange.

So before step 2 (stack purple on green_block_2), we need to have either held green_block_1 or stacked grey on orange.

Option: Stack grey on orange before step 2. But initially, grey is on green_block_1. So to stack grey on orange, we need to unstack grey from green_block_1, then stack on orange.

So steps:

Insert before step 2:

1. unstack grey_block_1 from green_block_1 → holding grey.
2. stack grey_block_1 on orange_block_1 → grey on orange. Now, constraint 6: when green_block_2 is not clear (later steps), the earlier state (step 2) has grey on orange. So this satisfies constraint 6.

But then, we have to handle the original steps. Let's try:

Original plan with modifications:

0. unstack grey_block_1 from green_block_1 → holding grey.
1. stack grey_block_1 on orange_block_1 → grey on orange.
2. unstack purple_block_1 from orange_block_1 → but wait, orange_block_1 now has grey on top. So to unstack purple from orange, purple must be on top of orange. But in the initial state, purple is on orange. But after step 0 and 1, grey is on orange. So the initial state has purple on orange, but after step 0 and 1, grey is stacked on orange. Wait, no: initial state has orange_block_1 on table with purple on top. So step 0: unstack grey from green_block_1. Then step 1: stack grey on orange. But orange has purple on top. So to stack grey on orange, orange must be clear. But initially, orange has purple on top. So stack grey on orange is not possible unless we first remove purple.

So this approach won't work. Therefore, we need to first remove purple from orange before stacking grey on orange.

But that brings us back to the original problem.

Alternative approach: To satisfy constraint 6 when green_block_2 is not clear, we need to have either held green_block_1 or have grey on orange before that.

So perhaps, after unstacking purple from orange, we can stack grey on orange.

But after unstacking purple from orange (step 1: holding purple), then:

1. unstack purple from orange → holding purple.
2. putdown purple → purple on table.
3. unstack grey from green_block_1 → holding grey.
4. stack grey on orange → now grey is on orange. This satisfies the condition for constraint 6 when green_block_2 is not clear (later steps).

But then, to make green_block_2 not clear, we need to stack something on it. For example, stack purple on green_block_2.

So:

5. pickup purple → holding purple.
6. stack purple on green_block_2 → green_block_2 not clear (constraint 5 met).

But now, when green_block_2 is not clear (step 6), the earlier state (step 4) has grey on orange. So constraint 6 is satisfied.

But now, the main goal is to stack green_block_2 on orange. Currently, orange has grey on top. So we need to clear orange.

So:

7. unstack grey from orange → holding grey.
8. putdown grey → grey on table.
9. pickup green_block_2 → holding green_block_2.
10. stack green_block_2 on orange → goal achieved.

But let's check constraints:

Constraint 1: purple must be not clear. In this plan, after step 6, purple is on green_block_2 and is clear. So no block is on top of purple. So constraint 1 not met.

So to meet constraint 1, we need to have something on top of purple. For example, stack red on purple.

Insert steps after step 6:

6. stack purple on green_block_2.
7. unstack red from brown_block_1 → holding red.
8. stack red on purple → purple not clear (constraint 1).
9. unstack red from purple → holding red.
10. putdown red.
11. unstack grey from orange → holding grey.
12. putdown grey → grey on table.
13. pickup green_block_2 → holding green_block_2.
14. stack green_block_2 on orange → goal.

Now, constraint 1 is met in step 8. Constraint 2: when purple is not clear (step 8), earlier state must have brown clear or green_block_2 on purple. In step 7, we unstack red from brown_block_1, making brown_block_1 clear. So constraint 2 is satisfied.

Constraint 3: purple is on table in step 2. So step 2: putdown purple. Yes. Constraint 4: when purple is on table (step 2), earlier state must have orange on grey or holding orange. Before step 2, step 1: holding purple. So no. So this violates constraint 4.

So this approach also fails.

This is really tricky. Let's try to find a path that satisfies all constraints.

Let's outline the steps needed, considering all constraints:

- To satisfy constraint 3: purple must be on table at some point.
- To satisfy constraint 4: when purple is on table, earlier state must have orange on grey or holding orange.
- To satisfy constraint 1: purple must not be clear (something on top) at some point.
- To satisfy constraint 2: when purple is not clear, earlier state must have brown clear or green_block_2 on purple.
- To satisfy constraint 5: green_block_2 must not be clear (something on top) at some point.
- To satisfy constraint 6: when green_block_2 is not clear, earlier state must have holding green_block_1 or grey on orange.

Main goal: green_block_2 on orange.

Possible plan steps:

1. unstack purple from orange → holding purple.
2. stack purple on green_block_2 → green_block_2 not clear (constraint 5). Before this step, initial state has grey on green_block_1. So to satisfy constraint 6, we need either holding green_block_1 or grey on orange before step 2. But in initial state, grey is on green_block_1. So if we can have grey on orange before step 2, that would satisfy constraint 6.

But to stack grey on orange, we need to unstack grey from green_block_1 first. So steps:

0. unstack grey_block_1 from green_block_1 → holding grey.
1. stack grey_block_1 on orange_block_1 → grey on orange (satisfies constraint 6 for when green_block_2 is not clear later).
2. unstack purple_block_1 from orange_block_1 → holding purple. But wait, after step 1, orange_block_1 has grey on top. So purple is no longer on orange. Initial state has purple on orange. So this is a contradiction. The initial state is:

purple_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1.

So after step 0 and 1, grey is on orange_block_1, which is on the table. But purple is still on orange_block_1. This is impossible because stacking grey on orange would require orange to be clear. But initially, purple is on orange. So this approach is invalid.

Therefore, we need to first remove purple from orange before stacking grey on orange.

So:

1. unstack purple from orange → holding purple.
2. putdown purple → purple on table. Now, orange is clear.
3. unstack grey from green_block_1 → holding grey.
4. stack grey on orange → grey on orange (satisfies condition for constraint 6 when green_block_2 is not clear later).
5. pickup purple from table → holding purple.
6. stack purple on green_block_2 → green_block_2 not clear (constraint 5). Now, before step 6, step 4 has grey on orange. So constraint 6 is satisfied.

But now, purple is on green_block_2 (step 6). To satisfy constraint 1 (purple not clear), we need to stack something on purple.

7. unstack red from brown_block_1 → holding red.
8. stack red on purple → purple not clear (constraint 1). Before this, step 7 unstack red from brown_block_1 makes brown_block_1 clear, satisfying constraint 2.

Now, purple is on green_block_2 with red on top. To satisfy constraint 3, purple must be on table. So we need to put purple on table after this.

9. unstack red from purple → holding red.
10. putdown red.
11. unstack purple from green_block_2 → holding purple.
12. putdown purple → constraint 3 met. Before step 12, step 4 (grey on orange) satisfies constraint 4.

Now, main goal: stack green_block_2 on orange. But orange has grey on top. So we need to unstack grey:

13. unstack grey from orange → holding grey.
14. putdown grey → grey on table.
15. pickup green_block_2 → holding green_block_2.
16. stack green_block_2 on orange → goal achieved.

Now, check all constraints:

Constraint 1: step 8 (red on purple) → purple not clear. Yes.

Constraint 2: when purple not clear (step 8), earlier step 7 made brown_block_1 clear. Yes.

Constraint 3: step 12 → purple on table. Yes.

Constraint 4: step 12 (purple on table) has step 4 (grey on orange) earlier. Yes.

Constraint 5: step 6 (purple on green_block_2) → green_block_2 not clear. Yes.

Constraint 6: step 6 (green_block_2 not clear) has step 4 (grey on orange) earlier. Yes.

Main goal achieved in step 16.

Now, check the actions:

Step 0: unstack grey_block_1 from green_block_1. Preconditions: grey is on green_block_1, clear (yes). Arm is empty (yes).

Step 1: stack grey on orange_block_1. Preconditions: holding grey, orange_block_1 is clear (after step 0, orange_block_1 has purple on top? Wait no: step 0 is unstack grey from green_block_1. Initial state: orange_block_1 has purple on top. So after step 0, orange_block_1 still has purple on top. So step 1 (stack grey on orange) is impossible because orange_block_1 has purple on top, not clear. So this approach is invalid.

Ah, here's the mistake. After step 0 (unstack grey from green_block_1), we have grey in hand. To stack grey on orange_block_1, orange must be clear. But in the initial state, orange_block_1 has purple on top. So even after step 0, orange_block_1 still has purple on top. So step 1 (stack grey on orange) is not possible. This plan is invalid.

So, need to unstack purple from orange before stacking grey on orange.

Revised steps:

1. unstack purple_block_1 from orange_block_1 → holding purple.
2. putdown purple → purple on table.
3. unstack grey_block_1 from green_block_1 → holding grey.
4. stack grey_block_1 on orange_block_1 → grey on orange.
5. pickup purple_block_1 → holding purple.
6. stack purple_block_1 on green_block_2 → green_block_2 not clear.
7. unstack red_block_1 from brown_block_1 → holding red.
8. stack red_block_1 on purple_block_1 → purple not clear.
9. unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1 → holding red.
10. putdown red_block_1 → red on table.
11. unstack purple_block_1 from green_block_2 → holding purple.
12. putdown purple_block_1 → purple on table (constraint 3).
13. unstack grey_block_1 from orange_block_1 → holding grey.
14. putdown grey_block_1 → grey on table.
15. pickup green_block_2 → holding green_block_2.
16. stack green_block_2 on orange_block_1 → goal.

Now, check constraints:

Constraint 1: step 8 (red on purple). Yes.

Constraint 2: step 7 (unstack red from brown_block_1 makes brown clear). Yes.

Constraint 3: step 12. Yes.

Constraint 4: step 12 (putdown purple) has step 4 (grey on orange) earlier. Yes.

Constraint 5: step 6 (purple on green_block_2). Yes.

Constraint 6: step 6 (green_block_2 not clear) has step 4 (grey on orange) earlier. Yes.

All constraints are met.

Now, check the preconditions for each action:

Step 1: unstack purple from orange. Preconditions: purple is on orange, purple is clear (yes), arm is empty (yes).

Step 2: putdown purple. Preconditions: holding purple (yes).

Step 3: unstack grey from green_block_1. Preconditions: grey is on green_block_1, grey is clear (yes), arm is empty (after step 2, arm is empty). Yes.

Step 4: stack grey on orange. Preconditions: holding grey (yes), orange is clear (after step 2, orange is on table and clear). Yes.

Step 5: pickup purple. Preconditions: purple is on table, clear (yes), arm is empty (after step 4, arm is empty). Yes.

Step 6: stack purple on green_block_2. Preconditions: holding purple (yes), green_block_2 is clear (after step 5, yes). Yes.

Step 7: unstack red from brown_block_1. Preconditions: red is on brown_block_1, red is clear (yes), arm is empty (after step 6, arm is empty). Yes.

Step 8: stack red on purple. Preconditions: holding red (yes), purple is clear (after step 6, purple is on green_block_2 and clear). Yes.

Step 9: unstack red from purple. Preconditions: red is on purple, red is clear (yes), arm is empty (after step 8, arm is empty). Wait, after stacking red on purple, the arm is empty. So step 9 is unstack red from purple: preconditions are met (red is on purple, red is clear, arm is empty). Yes.

Step 10: putdown red. Preconditions: holding red (yes).

Step 11: unstack purple from green_block_2. Preconditions: purple is on green_block_2, purple is clear (after step 9, red is putdown, so purple is clear). Arm is empty (after step 10). Yes.

Step 12: putdown purple. Preconditions: holding purple (yes).

Step 13: unstack grey from orange. Preconditions: grey is on orange, grey is clear (after step 4, nothing on grey). Arm is empty (after step 12). Yes.

Step 14: putdown grey. Preconditions: holding grey (yes).

Step 15: pickup green_block_2. Preconditions: green_block_2 is on table and clear (after step 11 and 12, yes). Arm is empty (yes).

Step 16: stack green_block_2 on orange. Preconditions: holding green_block_2 (yes), orange is clear (after step 13 and 14, orange is on table and clear). Yes.

All steps are valid.

This plan satisfies all constraints and the main goal.
