Okay, let's break this down. We need to get green_block_2 on top of orange_block_1. We also have several constraints to satisfy along the way. Here's a plan that addresses the goal and the constraints:

```
```
unstack purple_block_1 orange_block_1
putdown purple_block_1
unstack red_block_1 brown_block_1
putdown red_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
pickup green_block_2
stack green_block_2 orange_block_1
```
