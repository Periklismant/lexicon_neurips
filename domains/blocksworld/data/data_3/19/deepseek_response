**Explanation:**

1. **Move white_block_2** to satisfy constraint 2: `pickup white_block_2` and `stack white_block_2 brown_block_1` ensure white_block_2 isn't on the table after the initial state.

2. **Clear blue_block_1** to satisfy constraint 3: `unstack white_block_1` and `grey_block_1` from blue_block_1's tower.

3. **Satisfy constraint 5** by stacking `grey_block_1 blue_block_2`, providing the prerequisite for constraint 4.

4. **Hold blue_block_1** directly (`pickup blue_block_1`) to satisfy constraint 3.

5. **Stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_1** to make yellow_block_1 non-clear (constraint 4), leveraging the earlier grey_block_1 placement (constraint 5).

6. **Unstack blue_block_1** and **pickup yellow_block_1** to achieve the goal, maintaining optimality with 11 actions.
