Okay, let's break this down. We need to end up holding yellow_block_1. We have several constraints to satisfy along the way.

1.  **Hold yellow_block_1:** This is our ultimate goal.
2.  **yellow_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2:** This must be true at some point.
3.  **If yellow_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2, then white_block_2 is not on the table:** This means if we ever make yellow_block_1 not on top of blue_block_2, we must also remove white_block_2 from the table at the same time or later.
4.  **Hold blue_block_1:** We must hold blue_block_1 at some point.
5.  **yellow_block_1 is not clear:** Yellow_block_1 must have a block on top of it at some point.
6.  **If yellow_block_1 is not clear, then earlier "grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_2" or "you are holding blue_block_2":** This is a tricky one. Before we stack anything on yellow_block_1, either grey_block_1 must be on blue_block_2, or we must be holding blue_block_2. Since grey_block_1 starts on blue_block_1, and we need to hold blue_block_1 at some point, it seems easier to satisfy this condition by holding blue_block_2.

Here's a plan that addresses these constraints:

```
```
unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
pickup blue_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
pickup blue_block_2
stack white_block_1 yellow_block_1
putdown white_block_2
pickup yellow_block_1
```
