Okay, let's try to figure out this planning problem. So, the goal is to have the robotic arm holding the yellow_block_1. But there are several constraints we need to satisfy along the way. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, let's look at the initial state. The blocks are arranged as follows:

- blue_block_1 is on the table with grey_block_1 on top of it, and then white_block_1 on top of grey_block_1. So the stack is blue_block_1 → grey_block_1 → white_block_1, and white_block_1 is clear.
- white_block_2, blue_block_2, yellow_block_1, and brown_block_1 are all on the table and clear.

The constraints are a bit complex. Let's list them out:

1. At some state, yellow_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_2.
2. If in any state yellow_block_1 is not on blue_block_2, then white_block_2 must not be on the table either in that state or a subsequent one.
3. At some state, the arm must be holding blue_block_1.
4. At some state, yellow_block_1 must have a block on top (not clear).
5. If yellow_block_1 is not clear (i.e., has a block on top), then there must be an earlier state where either grey_block_1 is on blue_block_2 or the arm is holding blue_block_2.

So the main goal is to end up holding yellow_block_1, but we have to satisfy these constraints along the way.

Let's start by figuring out how to get the arm to hold yellow_block_1. Since yellow_block_1 is initially on the table and clear, the simplest way is to perform a pickup action. But wait, we need to check the preconditions for pickup: the block must be clear, on the table, and the arm is empty. All these are true initially for yellow_block_1. So the action 'pickup yellow_block_1' would directly achieve the goal. But we need to check if this satisfies all constraints.

But wait, the constraints must be met during the plan. Let's check each constraint:

1. The first constraint requires that at some state, yellow is not on blue2. Initially, yellow is on the table, so it's not on blue2. So maybe the initial state already satisfies this? But the initial state is before any actions are taken. However, the problem says the constraints must hold in the plan's states. Wait, the original state is the initial state, so if the initial state meets the condition, then that's fine. But in this case, the initial state has yellow_block_1 on the table, so it's not on blue_block_2. So the first constraint is satisfied by the initial state. But wait, the problem says the constraints must be met in at least one state of the plan. So if the initial state is part of the plan's states, then that's okay. But plans start from the initial state, then actions are applied. So the initial state is considered a state in the plan. So the first constraint is already satisfied.

But the second constraint says that if in any state s where yellow is not on blue2, then white_block_2 must not be on the table in s or a subsequent state. Since in the initial state, yellow is not on blue2, then in that state or after, white_block_2 must not be on the table. But in the initial state, white_block_2 is on the table. So the initial state violates the second constraint because s is the initial state (where yellow is not on blue2), but in s, white_block_2 is on the table. Therefore, the initial state doesn't satisfy the implication. Wait, the constraint is: whenever in a state s where yellow is not on blue2, then in s or a later state, white_block_2 is not on the table. So in the initial state, we have yellow not on blue2, but white_block_2 is on the table. So this triggers the need that in some state after the initial state, white_block_2 must not be on the table. Therefore, we need to have an action that moves white_block_2 off the table after the initial state.

But if we just do 'pickup yellow_block_1', that's one action. But then in the initial state, the constraint is violated. Therefore, the plan would not be valid. So we need to ensure that after the initial state (which is the first state where yellow isn't on blue2), we have a state where white_block_2 is not on the table.

So the plan must include moving white_block_2 from the table to somewhere else. But how?

Possible steps:

1. Move white_block_2 off the table. For example, stack it onto another block. Let's say we stack white_block_2 onto blue_block_2. Then, in that state, white_block_2 is not on the table. So after that action, in the state where white_block_2 is stacked, the constraint is satisfied.

But we need to do this after the initial state. So the plan must include moving white_block_2. But our main goal is to hold yellow_block_1, which is a single action. But we need to satisfy the constraints.

So perhaps the plan is:

- stack white_block_2 onto some block (like blue_block_2) to get it off the table.

But then we need to pick up white_block_2, which requires that it's clear (which it is). So:

Action: pickup white_block_2

Then stack it on blue_block_2 (since blue_block_2 is clear initially). So:

Action: stack white_block_2 blue_block_2

Now, after this, white_block_2 is on blue_block_2, so it's not on the table. Then, we can proceed to pickup yellow_block_1.

But wait, after stacking white_block_2, the arm is empty again, so we can then pickup yellow_block_1.

But then, the constraints:

- The first constraint is satisfied in the initial state.

- The second constraint: since in the initial state, yellow is not on blue2, we must have white_block_2 not on the table in that state or later. But in the initial state, it is on the table, so we need to make sure that in a later state (after stacking), white_block_2 is not on the table. Which is achieved by the stack action.

- The third constraint: at some state, the arm is holding blue_block_1. So we need to include an action where we pick up blue_block_1. But blue_block_1 is under grey_block_1. So to pick up blue_block_1, we need to unstack the blocks above it first. Wait, blue_block_1 is on the table, with grey_block_1 on top. So to pick up blue_block_1, it must be clear. But in the initial state, grey_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1, so blue_block_1 is not clear. Therefore, we need to first remove grey_block_1 and white_block_1 from on top of blue_block_1.

So steps to pick up blue_block_1:

1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1.

2. Putdown white_block_1.

3. Unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1.

4. Putdown grey_block_1.

Then, pickup blue_block_1.

But this adds several steps. However, the third constraint requires that at some state, the arm is holding blue_block_1. So this needs to be part of the plan.

Additionally, the fourth constraint requires that at some state, yellow_block_1 is not clear (i.e., has a block on top). So we need to place a block on top of yellow_block_1 at some point.

Moreover, the fifth constraint states that if yellow_block_1 is not clear (which happens when we place a block on it), then there must be an earlier state where either grey_block_1 is on blue_block_2 or the arm is holding blue_block_2.

So putting this all together, let's try to outline a plan:

1. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1. (This requires unstacking, since white_block_1 is on grey_block_1. Preconditions: white_block_1 is clear (it is), arm is empty (yes). After unstack, arm holds white_block_1, grey_block_1 becomes clear.)

2. Putdown white_block_1 on the table. Now white_block_1 is on the table, clear.

3. Unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1. Now arm holds grey_block_1.

4. Putdown grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 is on the table, clear.

5. Pickup blue_block_1. Now arm holds blue_block_1. This satisfies the third constraint.

But after this, we need to handle the other constraints. Let's remember that we need to get the arm to hold yellow_block_1 at the end.

But let's see:

We also need to stack something on yellow_block_1 (constraint 4). Let's say we stack white_block_1 on yellow_block_1. To do that, we need to pick up white_block_1 again (since we put it down earlier) and stack it on yellow_block_1.

But to stack on yellow_block_1, yellow_block_1 must be clear. Initially, it's clear. But after any action that affects it, we need to check.

Wait, after step 2, white_block_1 is on the table. So perhaps after step 5, we can put down blue_block_1, then work on stacking on yellow_block_1.

But let's also need to handle the fifth constraint: if we stack something on yellow_block_1 (making it not clear), we must have earlier either grey_block_1 on blue_block_2 or holding blue_block_2.

So perhaps before stacking on yellow_block_1, we need to have either grey_block_1 on blue_block_2 or have held blue_block_2.

Option: stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2. Let's see:

After step 4, grey_block_1 is on the table. So to stack it on blue_block_2, we can:

6. Pickup grey_block_1.

7. Stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2.

Now, grey_block_1 is on blue_block_2. This would satisfy the fifth constraint's condition (grey_block_1 is on blue_block_2), which is needed if we later stack something on yellow_block_1.

Then, proceed to stack something on yellow_block_1.

Let's continue:

8. Pickup white_block_1 (from the table, after step 2).

9. Stack white_block_1 on yellow_block_1. Now, yellow_block_1 is not clear (satisfies constraint 4).

But we need to check the fifth constraint: when we stack white_block_1 on yellow_block_1 (making yellow not clear), there must be an earlier state where grey_block_1 is on blue_block_2 or we held blue_block_2. Since step 7 stacked grey_block_1 on blue_block_2, which is earlier, this satisfies the fifth constraint.

Now, after these steps, we can proceed to the main goal of holding yellow_block_1. But wait, after step 9, yellow_block_1 has white_block_1 on top, so it's not clear. To pick up yellow_block_1, we need it to be clear. So we need to first remove white_block_1.

But that's a problem. Because the goal is to hold yellow_block_1, but if we've stacked something on it, we have to unstack that first.

Alternatively, maybe we can arrange the steps so that we stack something on yellow_block_1 and then later remove it to pick up yellow_block_1.

Wait, but the goal is to have the arm holding yellow_block_1 at the end. So the last action must be either picking up yellow_block_1 from the table or unstacking it from another block.

But if we have stacked something on yellow_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 4), then yellow_block_1 is under that block. So to pick it up, we need to first remove the block on top.

But that would add more steps. Let's see:

If after step 9 (stack white_block_1 on yellow_block_1), yellow_block_1 has white_block_1 on top. Then, to get yellow_block_1, we need to:

10. Unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1.

11. Putdown white_block_1.

12. Pickup yellow_block_1.

But that adds steps. However, the plan needs to be optimal (shortest possible). So maybe there's a way to avoid stacking on yellow_block_1 but still satisfy constraint 4.

Wait, constraint 4 requires that in at least one state, yellow_block_1 is not clear. So perhaps we can stack something on yellow_block_1 and then later unstack it, but that adds steps. Alternatively, maybe we can place a block on yellow_block_1 and leave it there, but then to pick up yellow_block_1, we need to remove that block first.

Alternatively, maybe we can stack a block on yellow_block_1 and then in the same plan, unstack it, but that might not be necessary if the goal is to hold yellow_block_1. Let's think.

Alternatively, maybe after we have stacked something on yellow_block_1 (satisfying constraint 4), we can proceed to unstack it and then pick up yellow_block_1. But that adds steps. Let's see:

But the problem requires the plan to be optimal. So perhaps the minimal steps would involve satisfying all constraints with the fewest actions.

Let me try to outline the plan again, integrating all constraints:

1. Handle constraint 3: pick up blue_block_1. To do this, we need to unstack the blocks above it.

   a. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1. (arm holds white_block_1)

   b. Putdown white_block_1. (arm empty, white_block_1 on table)

   c. Unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1. (arm holds grey_block_1)

   d. Putdown grey_block_1. (arm empty, grey_block_1 on table)

   e. Pickup blue_block_1. (arm holds blue_block_1; satisfies constraint 3)

   f. Putdown blue_block_1. (optional? Maybe not needed, but we need to proceed.)

Wait, but after e, we have to put it down if we need the arm to do other actions. But maybe we can use blue_block_1 for something else.

But let's proceed.

2. Handle constraint 5 and 4. We need to stack something on yellow_block_1, and before that, have either grey_block_1 on blue_block_2 or hold blue_block_2.

   Option: stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2.

   So:

   f. Pickup grey_block_1 (from table, after step d).

   g. Stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2. (Now, grey_block_1 is on blue_block_2; satisfies the condition for constraint 5)

3. Now, stack something on yellow_block_1.

   h. Pickup white_block_1 (from table, after step b).

   i. Stack white_block_1 on yellow_block_1. (Now yellow_block_1 is not clear; satisfies constraint 4)

4. Now, to pick up yellow_block_1, we need to unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1.

   j. Unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (arm holds white_block_1)

   k. Putdown white_block_1.

   l. Pickup yellow_block_1. (achieves the goal)

But this is getting quite long. Let's count the steps so far:

Steps a to l: 12 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, maybe there's a way to combine some steps. For example, after step e (holding blue_block_1), maybe we can stack it somewhere to satisfy other constraints.

Alternatively, let's think differently. Since we need to hold blue_block_1 at some point (constraint 3), we have to unstack the blocks above it, which requires steps a-d. Then pickup blue_block_1 (step e). Then put it down again (step f) if needed. But maybe we can use blue_block_1 for stacking.

But perhaps a better approach is to first handle the white_block_2 constraint. Because the second constraint says that whenever yellow is not on blue2, white_block_2 must not be on the table in that state or after. Since the initial state is such a state (yellow not on blue2, white_block_2 on table), we need to move white_block_2 off the table in some subsequent step.

So perhaps early in the plan, we move white_block_2. Let's try:

1. Move white_block_2 off the table. Let's stack it onto blue_block_2.

   a. Pickup white_block_2.

   b. Stack white_block_2 on blue_block_2.

Now, white_block_2 is not on the table. This handles the second constraint, because after the initial state (which is s where yellow not on blue2), we have a state (after step b) where white_block_2 is not on the table.

Now, proceed to other constraints.

But we still need to handle constraint 3 (hold blue_block_1), constraint 4 (yellow not clear), and constraint 5.

So next steps:

2. Unstack the blocks on blue_block_1 to pick it up.

   c. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1.

   d. Putdown white_block_1.

   e. Unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1.

   f. Putdown grey_block_1.

   g. Pickup blue_block_1. (satisfies constraint 3)

   h. Putdown blue_block_1. (if needed)

3. Now, to satisfy constraint 4 (yellow not clear), stack something on yellow_block_1. Let's use grey_block_1.

But to stack on yellow_block_1, we need to have a block to stack. Let's use grey_block_1, which is on the table after step f.

   i. Pickup grey_block_1.

   j. Stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_1. (now yellow is not clear; satisfies constraint 4)

But now, according to constraint 5, when we stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_1 (making yellow not clear), there must be an earlier state where either grey_block_1 is on blue_block_2 or we held blue_block_2.

But in step b, we stacked white_block_2 on blue_block_2. So blue_block_2 has white_block_2 on it. So grey_block_1 was never on blue_block_2, and we never held blue_block_2. So this would violate constraint 5.

Therefore, this approach doesn't work. We need to have either grey_block_1 on blue_block_2 or holding blue_block_2 before stacking on yellow_block_1.

So, perhaps before stacking on yellow_block_1, we need to either stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2 or hold blue_block_2.

Let's adjust:

After step b (stack white_block_2 on blue_block_2), blue_block_2 is not clear (has white_block_2 on top). So we can't stack anything else on it unless we unstack white_block_2.

Alternatively, if we hold blue_block_2, but initially, blue_block_2 is on the table and clear. So we could pick it up.

So let's try:

After step g (holding blue_block_1), perhaps we can put it down and then pick up blue_block_2 to satisfy the fifth constraint.

But this is getting complicated. Let's try to outline again:

1. Handle white_block_2 constraint:

   a. Pickup white_block_2.

   b. Stack white_block_2 on blue_block_2. Now, white_block_2 is not on the table. This addresses the second constraint.

2. Handle constraint 3 (hold blue_block_1):

   c. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1.

   d. Putdown white_block_1.

   e. Unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1.

   f. Putdown grey_block_1.

   g. Pickup blue_block_1. (satisfies constraint 3)

3. Now, need to stack something on yellow_block_1 (constraint 4). Let's use grey_block_1.

   h. Pickup grey_block_1.

   i. Stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_1. (now yellow is not clear)

But to satisfy constraint 5, before this, we need to have either grey_block_1 on blue_block_2 or hold blue_block_2.

So perhaps before step h, we need to do something with blue_block_2.

But after step b, blue_block_2 has white_block_2 on top. So to stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2, we need to first unstack white_block_2.

But that adds steps:

   j. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2.

   k. Putdown white_block_2.

   l. Pickup grey_block_1.

   m. Stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2.

But this would allow us to have grey_block_1 on blue_block_2, satisfying the fifth constraint's condition. Then, after that, we can stack something else on yellow_block_1.

But this is getting too long. Let's think of alternative approaches.

Alternative approach: instead of stacking white_block_2 on blue_block_2, maybe stack it somewhere else, and then stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2.

But how?

Alternatively, after step b (stack white_block_2 on blue_block_2), we could unstack it later. But this complicates the plan.

Alternatively, let's consider using blue_block_2 for something else. For example, pick up blue_block_2 and put it down again. But why?

Because the fifth constraint requires that before stacking on yellow_block_1, we either held blue_block_2 or have grey_block_1 on blue_block_2. So if we can hold blue_block_2 at some point before stacking on yellow, that satisfies the constraint.

So perhaps:

After step b (stack white_block_2 on blue_block_2), but then we need to hold blue_block_2. But blue_block_2 has white_block_2 on top. So we can't pick it up unless we first unstack white_block_2.

So:

   c. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2.

   d. Putdown white_block_2.

   e. Pickup blue_block_2. (now holding blue_block_2; satisfies the fifth constraint's condition)

Then proceed to handle blue_block_1.

But this adds steps. Let's see:

1. a. Pickup white_block_2.

   b. Stack white_block_2 on blue_block_2.

   c. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2.

   d. Putdown white_block_2.

   e. Pickup blue_block_2.

   f. Putdown blue_block_2.

Now, holding blue_block_2 (step e) satisfies the fifth constraint's condition (holding blue_block_2). Then, later when we stack on yellow_block_1, we have an earlier state where we held blue_block_2.

But this seems like extra steps. However, it allows us to satisfy the fifth constraint.

Then, after this, handle blue_block_1:

   g. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1.

   h. Putdown white_block_1.

   i. Unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1.

   j. Putdown grey_block_1.

   k. Pickup blue_block_1. (constraint 3)

Then stack something on yellow_block_1:

   l. Pickup grey_block_1.

   m. Stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_1. (constraint 4)

Now, since we held blue_block_2 in step e, which is before step m, this satisfies constraint 5.

Finally, to pick up yellow_block_1, we need to unstack grey_block_1:

   n. Unstack grey_block_1 from yellow_block_1.

   o. Putdown grey_block_1.

   p. Pickup yellow_block_1.

This gives a plan with 15 steps, which seems long. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternative idea: Can we use blue_block_1 in a way that also helps with the constraints? For example, after picking up blue_block_1 (step k), maybe stack it on yellow_block_1.

But then, we need to have an earlier state where either grey_block_1 is on blue_block_2 or we held blue_block_2. So if we stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_1, then we need to have held blue_block_2 before that.

But in this scenario, we did hold blue_block_2 in step e.

So steps:

After step k (holding blue_block_1):

   l. Stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_1. (now yellow is not clear; constraint 4)

But before that, we held blue_block_2 in step e, so constraint 5 is satisfied.

Then, to pick up yellow_block_1, we need to unstack blue_block_1:

   m. Unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1.

   n. Putdown blue_block_1.

   o. Pickup yellow_block_1.

This would reduce the steps compared to the previous approach.

So let's outline this plan:

1. Handle white_block_2 constraint:

   a. Pickup white_block_2.

   b. Stack white_block_2 on blue_block_2.

   c. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2.

   d. Putdown white_block_2.

   e. Pickup blue_block_2.

   f. Putdown blue_block_2. (Now, we've held blue_block_2, satisfying part of constraint 5)

2. Handle blue_block_1:

   g. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1.

   h. Putdown white_block_1.

   i. Unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1.

   j. Putdown grey_block_1.

   k. Pickup blue_block_1. (constraint 3)

3. Stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_1:

   l. Stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_1. (constraint 4)

4. Unstack blue_block_1 to get yellow_block_1:

   m. Unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1.

   n. Putdown blue_block_1.

   o. Pickup yellow_block_1.

This plan has 15 steps. But maybe there's a way to optimize.

Wait, steps c and d (unstack and putdown white_block_2) are only needed to hold blue_block_2. But perhaps there's a way to hold blue_block_2 without moving white_block_2.

Alternatively, instead of stacking white_block_2 on blue_block_2, maybe we can just pick up blue_block_2 first.

Wait, initially, blue_block_2 is on the table and clear. So we can pick it up directly.

But if we pickup blue_block_2 and put it down again, that would satisfy the fifth constraint's condition (holding blue_block_2) without needing to move white_block_2.

Wait, but the second constraint requires that whenever yellow is not on blue2, white_block_2 is not on the table in that state or after. So the initial state is such a state. So we need to move white_block_2 off the table at some point after the initial state.

So maybe steps:

1. Pickup blue_block_2. (satisfies holding blue_block_2 for constraint 5)

2. Putdown blue_block_2. (now, blue_block_2 is on the table again)

But this doesn't help. But during step 1, we are holding blue_block_2, which satisfies the condition for constraint 5. Then, later when we stack something on yellow_block_1, we have an earlier state where we held blue_block_2.

But we still need to handle the second constraint (moving white_block_2 off the table after the initial state). So after the initial state, we have to move white_block_2.

So steps:

1. Pickup white_block_2.

2. Stack white_block_2 somewhere (e.g., on blue_block_2).

3. Now, proceed to other steps.

But in this case, after step 2, white_block_2 is not on the table, satisfying the second constraint.

So integrating this:

Plan:

1. Pickup white_block_2.

2. Stack white_block_2 on blue_block_2. (now white_block_2 not on table)

3. Pickup blue_block_2. (now holding blue_block_2; satisfies constraint 5)

4. Putdown blue_block_2. (blue_block_2 is back on table, clear)

5. Now, handle blue_block_1:

   a. Unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1.

   b. Putdown white_block_1.

   c. Unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1.

   d. Putdown grey_block_1.

   e. Pickup blue_block_1. (constraint 3)

6. Stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_1. (constraint 4)

7. Unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1.

8. Putdown blue_block_1.

9. Pickup yellow_block_1. (goal)

This plan has 9 steps. Let's check the constraints:

- Constraint 1: yellow not on blue2 in some state. Initial state satisfies this.

- Constraint 2: in initial state, yellow not on blue2 and white_block_2 is on table. So we moved white_block_2 off in step 2.

- Constraint 3: step e.

- Constraint 4: step 6.

- Constraint 5: step 3 (held blue_block_2) is before step 6 (stack on yellow).

This seems to work.

Now, let's count the steps:

1. pickup white_block_2

2. stack white_block_2 blue_block_2

3. pickup blue_block_2

4. putdown blue_block_2

5. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1

6. putdown white_block_1

7. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1

8. putdown grey_block_1

9. pickup blue_block_1

10. stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1

11. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1

12. putdown blue_block_1

13. pickup yellow_block_1

Wait, that's 13 steps, but perhaps there's a way to shorten.

Wait, after step 2, blue_block_2 has white_block_2 on top. So to pickup blue_block_2 in step 3, we need to unstack white_block_2 first. Wait, no. Because blue_block_2 is under white_block_2. To pick up blue_block_2, there can't be anything on top of it. So after step 2, white_block_2 is on blue_block_2, so blue_block_2 is not clear. Therefore, step 3 (pickup blue_block_2) is invalid because its preconditions are not met (blue_block_2 is not clear). So this plan is incorrect.

Ah, right! So after stacking white_block_2 on blue_block_2, blue_block_2 is not clear. So we can't pick it up directly. Therefore, step 3 (pickup blue_block_2) is not possible. So this approach is invalid.

So we need to find another way to satisfy constraint 5. Let's rethink.

Alternative approach: after stacking white_block_2 on blue_block_2 (step 2), then to hold blue_block_2, we need to unstack white_block_2 first.

So steps:

1. pickup white_block_2

2. stack white_block_2 blue_block_2

3. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2

4. putdown white_block_2

5. pickup blue_block_2

6. putdown blue_block_2

Now, after step 5, we've held blue_block_2, satisfying constraint 5.

Then proceed to handle blue_block_1:

7. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1

8. putdown white_block_1

9. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1

10. putdown grey_block_1

11. pickup blue_block_1 (constraint 3)

12. stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1 (constraint 4)

13. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1

14. putdown blue_block_1

15. pickup yellow_block_1 (goal)

This plan has 15 steps. Let's verify the constraints:

- Constraint 1: satisfied in initial state.

- Constraint 2: after step 2, white_block_2 is not on table. So in the initial state, we have to move white_block_2, which is done in step 2.

- Constraint 3: step 11.

- Constraint 4: step 12.

- Constraint 5: step 5 (held blue_block_2) before step 12.

This works, but is there a shorter way?

Wait, perhaps after step 2 (stack white_block_2 on blue_block_2), we can use grey_block_1 to stack on blue_block_2. But grey_block_1 is on blue_block_1 initially. So we need to unstack grey_block_1 first.

But that would take steps. Let's try:

1. pickup white_block_2 → stack on blue_block_2 (steps 1-2).

2. unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1:

   a. unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1.

   b. putdown white_block_1.

   c. unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1.

   d. stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2. (now grey_block_1 is on blue_block_2, satisfying constraint 5's condition)

3. Now, stack something on yellow_block_1:

   e. pickup white_block_1.

   f. stack white_block_1 on yellow_block_1.

4. Then pickup yellow_block_1:

   g. unstack white_block_1 from yellow_block_1.

   h. putdown white_block_1.

   i. pickup yellow_block_1.

Also, need to pickup blue_block_1 for constraint 3:

   j. pickup blue_block_1 (after step d, since blue_block_1 is now clear).

So full plan:

1. pickup white_block_2

2. stack white_block_2 blue_block_2

3. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1

4. putdown white_block_1

5. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1

6. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2 (now grey_block_1 is on blue_block_2)

7. pickup white_block_1

8. stack white_block_1 yellow_block_1

9. unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1

10. putdown white_block_1

11. pickup blue_block_1 (constraint 3)

12. putdown blue_block_1

13. pickup yellow_block_1 (goal)

Now, check constraints:

- Constraint 1: initial state.

- Constraint 2: step 2 removes white_block_2 from table.

- Constraint 3: step 11.

- Constraint 4: step 8.

- Constraint 5: step 6 (grey_block_1 on blue_block_2) before step 8.

This plan has 13 steps, but let's see:

Steps 1-2: white_block_2 on blue_block_2.

Steps 3-5: unstack grey_block_1.

Step 6: stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2.

Step 7-8: stack white_block_1 on yellow.

Step 9-10: unstack white_block_1.

Steps 11-13: pickup blue_block_1 and yellow_block_1.

But step 11 (pickup blue_block_1) is possible because after step 5, blue_block_1 is on the table and clear.

This plan has 13 steps, but maybe we can optimize further.

Wait, after step 6 (grey_block_1 on blue_block_2), we need to stack something on yellow_block_1. If we stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2, then during step 6, we are holding grey_block_1 and stack it. So after that, grey_block_1 is on blue_block_2, and blue_block_2 has white_block_2 and grey_block_1? No, because stacking is placing a block on top of another. So blue_block_2 has white_block_2 from step 2, then grey_block_1 is stacked on white_block_2. Wait, no. The stack action places the block on top of the other. So after step 2, white_block_2 is on blue_block_2. Then step 6 stacks grey_block_1 on blue_block_2. Wait, no. Because blue_block_2 is not clear (has white_block_2 on top). So you can't stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2 unless blue_block_2 is clear. So step 6 is invalid because blue_block_2 has white_block_2 on top, so it's not clear. Therefore, this approach is invalid.

Ah, right! So after step 2, white_block_2 is on blue_block_2, making blue_block_2 not clear. So step 6 (stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2) is impossible because blue_block_2 is not clear. So this approach doesn't work.

Alternative idea: Instead of stacking white_block_2 on blue_block_2, stack it somewhere else, like on brown_block_1. Then blue_block_2 remains clear, and we can stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2.

So:

1. pickup white_block_2

2. stack white_block_2 brown_block_1 (now white_block_2 is not on table)

3. unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1:

   a. unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1.

   b. putdown white_block_1.

   c. unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1.

   d. stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2.

Now, grey_block_1 is on blue_block_2.

Then stack something on yellow_block_1:

   e. pickup white_block_1.

   f. stack white_block_1 yellow_block_1.

Then pickup blue_block_1 (constraint 3):

   g. pickup blue_block_1.

Then pickup yellow_block_1:

   h. unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1.

   i. putdown white_block_1.

   j. pickup yellow_block_1.

This plan:

Steps:

1. pickup white_block_2

2. stack white_block_2 brown_block_1

3. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1

4. putdown white_block_1

5. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1

6. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2

7. pickup white_block_1

8. stack white_block_1 yellow_block_1

9. pickup blue_block_1

10. unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1

11. putdown white_block_1

12. pickup yellow_block_1

That's 12 steps. Check constraints:

- Constraint 1: initial state.

- Constraint 2: step 2 removes white_block_2 from table.

- Constraint 3: step 9.

- Constraint 4: step 8.

- Constraint 5: step 6 (grey_block_1 on blue_block_2) before step 8.

This plan seems valid and shorter. Let's verify the steps:

After step 2, white_block_2 is on brown_block_1, which is allowed.

Step 6 stacks grey_block_1 on blue_block_2 (which is clear since blue_block_2 is initially clear and we didn't stack anything else on it yet).

Wait, no. Initially, blue_block_2 is on the table and clear. After step 2, white_block_2 is on brown_block_1. So blue_block_2 remains clear. Therefore, step 6 (stack grey_block_1 on blue_block_2) is valid because blue_block_2 is clear.

Then, step 8 stacks white_block_1 on yellow_block_1, making yellow not clear.

Constraint 5 is satisfied because step 6 is before step 8.

Now, to pick up yellow_block_1, we need to unstack white_block_1 (steps 10 and 11).

After step 9, the arm is holding blue_block_1. Then, to proceed to pick up yellow_block_1, we need to put down blue_block_1 first.

Wait, in step 9, after pickup blue_block_1, the arm is holding it. To then unstack white_block_1, the arm must be empty. So we need to put down blue_block_1 first:

Adjust steps:

9. pickup blue_block_1 (constraint 3)

10. putdown blue_block_1

11. unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1

12. putdown white_block_1

13. pickup yellow_block_1

Now, the plan is 13 steps. But this satisfies all constraints.

Alternatively, after step 8, we can immediately pickup blue_block_1, but then we need to put it down before unstacking white_block_1.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to avoid stacking white_block_1 on yellow_block_1. For example, use another block.

But let's proceed.

So the full valid plan is:

1. pickup white_block_2

2. stack white_block_2 brown_block_1

3. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1

4. putdown white_block_1

5. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1

6. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2

7. pickup white_block_1

8. stack white_block_1 yellow_block_1

9. pickup blue_block_1

10. putdown blue_block_1

11. unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1

12. putdown white_block_1

13. pickup yellow_block_1

But this is 13 steps. Can we optimize further?

Wait, after step 8 (stack white_block_1 on yellow_block_1), maybe instead of unstacking it, we can use another block. But the goal is to hold yellow_block_1, which requires that it's clear. So we must unstack white_block_1.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to avoid stacking on yellow_block_1 and instead use another block. But constraint 4 requires that yellow_block_1 is not clear in some state. So we have to stack something on it.

Another idea: after step 6 (grey_block_1 on blue_block_2), stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_1, which would satisfy constraint 4 and also allow us to hold blue_block_1 (constraint 3).

Let's try:

1. pickup white_block_2

2. stack white_block_2 brown_block_1

3. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1

4. putdown white_block_1

5. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1

6. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2

7. pickup blue_block_1 (constraint 3)

8. stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1 (constraint 4)

9. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1

10. putdown blue_block_1

11. pickup yellow_block_1

This plan has 11 steps. Check constraints:

- Constraint 1: initial state.

- Constraint 2: step 2 removes white_block_2 from table.

- Constraint 3: step 7.

- Constraint 4: step 8.

- Constraint 5: step 6 (grey_block_1 on blue_block_2) before step 8.

This works. Let's check the steps:

Step 1-2: handle white_block_2.

Steps 3-5: unstack grey_block_1 and stack on blue_block_2 (step 6).

Step 7: pickup blue_block_1 (now clear after step 5).

Step 8: stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_1 (now yellow not clear).

Step 9-11: unstack blue_block_1 and pick up yellow_block_1.

This plan has 11 steps, which is better.

Now, verify each action's preconditions:

1. pickup white_block_2: white_block_2 is clear, on table, arm empty. Yes.

2. stack white_block_2 brown_block_1: arm holds white_block_2, brown_block_1 is clear. Yes, initially brown_block_1 is clear.

3. unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1: white_block_1 is clear (yes), arm empty. Yes.

4. putdown white_block_1: arm holds white_block_1. Yes.

5. unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_1: grey_block_1 is on blue_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear (after step 3 unstack white_block_1), arm empty. Yes.

6. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2: arm holds grey_block_1, blue_block_2 is clear (after step 2, white_block_2 is on brown_block_1, blue_block_2 is clear). Yes.

7. pickup blue_block_1: blue_block_1 is clear (after step 5 unstack grey_block_1), on table, arm empty. Yes.

8. stack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1: arm holds blue_block_1, yellow_block_1 is clear (initially, and after step 6, no actions affect yellow_block_1). Yes.

9. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1: blue_block_1 is on yellow_block_1, blue_block_1 is clear, arm empty. Yes.

10. putdown blue_block_1: arm holds blue_block_1. Yes.

11. pickup yellow_block_1: yellow_block_1 is clear, on table, arm empty. Yes.

All preconditions are met.

Now, check constraints:

- Constraint 1: yellow not on blue_block_2 in initial state.

- Constraint 2: in initial state, white_block_2 is on table. After step 2, it's not. So in any state where yellow is not on blue_block_2 (like initial state), white_block_2 is not on table after step 2.

- Constraint 3: step 7.

- Constraint 4: step 8.

- Constraint 5: step 6 (grey_block_1 on blue_block_2) before step 8.

Yes, all constraints are satisfied.

This plan has 11 steps. Is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, after step 8 (stack blue_block_1 on yellow_block_1), can we directly unstack it and pick up yellow_block_1 without putting down blue_block_1?

Yes:

9. unstack blue_block_1 yellow_block_1

10. pickup yellow_block_1

Wait, no. After unstacking blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1, the arm is holding blue_block_1. To pick up yellow_block_1, the arm must be empty. So we need to put down blue_block_1 first.

So steps 9-11 are necessary.

Thus, the shortest plan we've found is 11 steps. Let's confirm if there's a way to reduce further.

Another idea: perhaps we can use the grey_block_1 for stacking on yellow_block_1 instead of blue_block_1. But that would require additional steps to unstack grey_block_1 from blue_block_2.

Alternatively, after step 6 (grey_block_1 on blue_block_2), use that for constraint 5 and stack something else on yellow_block_1.

But let's see:

After step 6, grey_block_1 is on blue_block_2. So to stack something on yellow_block_1, we can use white_block_1. Let's try:

1. pickup white_block_2

2. stack white_block_2 brown_block_1

3. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1

4. stack white_block_1 yellow_block_1 (now yellow is not clear)

But to stack white_block_1 on yellow_block_1, we need to pick it up first. Which is step 3.

Wait, step 3 is unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1. Then, step 4 is stack white_block_1 on yellow_block_1.

But after step 3, arm holds white_block_1. So step 4 is possible. Then:

5. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1

6. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2

7. pickup blue_block_1 (constraint 3)

8. unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1

9. putdown white_block_1

10. pickup yellow_block_1

This plan has 10 steps. Let's check:

Steps:

1. pickup white_block_2

2. stack white_block_2 brown_block_1

3. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1

4. stack white_block_1 yellow_block_1

5. unstack grey_block_1 blue_block_1

6. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_2

7. pickup blue_block_1

8. unstack white_block_1 yellow_block_1

9. putdown white_block_1

10. pickup yellow_block_1

Check constraints:

- Constraint 1: initial state.

- Constraint 2: step 2 removes white_block_2 from table.

- Constraint 3: step 7.

- Constraint 4: step 4.

- Constraint 5: step 6 (grey_block_1 on blue_block_2) is after step 4. Wait, no. Step 4 is stacking white_block_1 on yellow_block_1 (constraint 4) which requires that before step 4, there's an earlier state where grey_block_1 on blue_block_2 or holding blue_block_2.

But in this plan, step 6 (stacking grey_block_1 on blue_block_2) occurs after step 4. Therefore, constraint 5 is violated because the condition (stacking on yellow) happens before the required earlier state.

Therefore, this plan is invalid.

Thus, the earlier plan with 11 steps is the shortest valid one.
