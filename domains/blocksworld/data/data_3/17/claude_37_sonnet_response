Okay, let's break down the problem:

# Initial State:
- brown_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_2 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on top of brown_block_2
- black_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
- black_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
- black_block_2 is clear
- black_block_3 is clear
- grey_block_1 is clear
- the robotic arm is not holding any block

# Goal:
- the robotic arm is holding black_block_3

# Constraints:
1. At some point, "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1" must be true.
2. If "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1" becomes true, then "the robotic arm is holding brown_block_2" must have been true in an earlier state.
3. At some point, "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" must be true.
4. If "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" becomes true at state s, then either "the robotic arm is holding black_block_1" or "green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" must be true at state s or after.
5. At some point, either "green_block_1 is clear" or "brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" must be true.

Let's start by understanding the current structure:

Table:
- brown_block_1 (with black_block_3 on top)
- brown_block_2 (with green_block_1 on top, which has grey_block_1 on top)
- black_block_1 (with black_block_2 on top)

Clear blocks: black_block_2, black_block_3, grey_block_1

The goal is to have the arm hold black_block_3. For this, we need to unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1.

Looking at the constraints:

1. "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1" will be true after we unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1.
2. But, before we can do that, we need to have a state where "the robotic arm is holding brown_block_2". So, we need to make sure that brown_block_2 is free to pick up.
3. "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" is always true since a block can't be on top of itself. So, this constraint is trivially satisfied.
4. Since "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" is always true, we need to make sure that at some point, either "the robotic arm is holding black_block_1" or "green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" is true.
5. We need to ensure that at some point, either "green_block_1 is clear" or "brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" is true.

Wait, I think I need to clarify the 3rd constraint. It says "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" must be true in at least one state. But as I mentioned, a block can't be on top of itself, so this is always true in every state. I think this constraint is trivially satisfied.

For the 4th constraint, since the condition in the if-part ("green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1") is always true, the then-part (either "the robotic arm is holding black_block_1" or "green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1") must be true at some point.

The 5th constraint requires that at some point, either "green_block_1 is clear" or "brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" is true.

Let's start planning:

To pick up black_block_3 (which is the goal), we need to unstack it from brown_block_1. But, before we can unstack black_block_3, the constraint says we need to have a state where the arm is holding brown_block_2.

From the initial state, we can't directly pick up brown_block_2 because green_block_1 is on top of it, which has grey_block_1 on top.

So, our first step is to unstack grey_block_1 from green_block_1.

Initial State:
```
    grey_block_1
        |
    green_block_1
        |
    brown_block_2     black_block_2
        |                 |
    TABLE           black_block_1
                        |
                      TABLE
    black_block_3
        |
    brown_block_1
        |
      TABLE
```

Plan:
1. `unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1`: We unstack grey_block_1 from green_block_1.
   - Effects: grey_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1, green_block_1 is clear, we're holding grey_block_1.

2. We need to put grey_block_1 somewhere so that we can perform other actions. We can put it on the table or on another clear block. Let's put it on the table:
   `putdown grey_block_1`
   - Effects: grey_block_1 is on the table, grey_block_1 is clear, we're not holding any block.

3. Now we need to unstack green_block_1 from brown_block_2:
   `unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2`
   - Effects: green_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_2, brown_block_2 is clear, we're holding green_block_1.

4. We can put green_block_1 on black_block_1 to satisfy the 4th constraint. But black_block_1 is not clear; it has black_block_2 on top. So we first need to unstack black_block_2:
   `putdown green_block_1`
   - Effects: green_block_1 is on the table, green_block_1 is clear, we're not holding any block.

5. `unstack black_block_2 black_block_1`
   - Effects: black_block_2 is not on top of black_block_1, black_block_1 is clear, we're holding black_block_2.

6. `putdown black_block_2`
   - Effects: black_block_2 is on the table, black_block_2 is clear, we're not holding any block.

7. `pickup green_block_1`
   - Effects: we're holding green_block_1, green_block_1is not on the table.

8. `stack green_block_1 black_block_1`
   - Effects: green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, green_block_1 is clear, black_block_1 is not clear, we're not holding any block.

9. `pickup brown_block_2`
   - Effects: we're holding brown_block_2, brown_block_2 is not on the table.

Now, the constraint "if 'black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1' holds, then there must be an earlier state where 'you are holding brown_block_2'" is satisfied. We can proceed to unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1.

10. `putdown brown_block_2`
    - Effects: brown_block_2 is on the table, brown_block_2 is clear, we're not holding any block.

11. `unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1`
    - Effects: black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear, we're holding black_block_3.

At this point, we've achieved the goal: the arm is holding black_block_3.

Let me check if all the constraints are satisfied:

1. "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1" is true after step 11.
2. "the robotic arm is holding brown_block_2" is true in step 9, which is before step 11.
3. "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" is always true.
4. After step 8, "green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" is true.
5. Green_block_1 is clear after step 3 (and before we place anything on it again). Also, brown_block_1 is clear after step 11.

The plan seems to satisfy all the constraints!

But wait, let's double-check the 5th constraint: "At some point, either 'green_block_1 is clear' or 'brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_1' must be true."

In our plan, green_block_1 is clear after step 3, and before we place anything on it again. So this constraint is satisfied.

In fact, I think there's a simpler plan:

1. `unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1`
   - Effects: grey_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1, green_block_1 is clear, we're holding grey_block_1.

At this point, "green_block_1 is clear" is true, satisfying the 5th constraint.

2. `putdown grey_block_1`
   - Effects: grey_block_1 is on the table, grey_block_1 is clear, we're not holding any block.

3. `unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2`
   - Effects: green_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_2, brown_block_2 is clear, we're holding green_block_1.

4. `unstack black_block_2 black_block_1`
   - Wait, I can't do this while I'm holding green_block_1. Let me correct.

Actually, let's try again with a more methodical approach. Our goal is to have the arm holding black_block_3. Let's try to work backwards from that goal:

To have the arm hold black_block_3, we need to unstack it from brown_block_1. But, due to the constraint, before we do this, we need to have held brown_block_2 at some point.

To hold brown_block_2, we need to clear it, which means unstacking green_block_1 from it. But to unstack green_block_1, we need to clear it, which means unstacking grey_block_1 from it.

So, a tentative plan might look like:
1. Unstack grey_block_1 from green_block_1.
2. Put grey_block_1 somewhere (table or another clear block).
3. Unstack green_block_1 from brown_block_2.
4. Put green_block_1 somewhere, but to satisfy the 4th constraint, it should either be on black_block_1 or we should hold black_block_1 at some point.
5. Pickup brown_block_2 (to satisfy the 2nd constraint).
6. Put brown_block_2 back.
7. Unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1.

Now, I also need to check the 5th constraint: "At some point, either 'green_block_1 is clear' or 'brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_1' must be true."

Green_block_1 will be clear after we unstack grey_block_1 from it. So, that satisfies the 5th constraint. (Actually, the constraint will also be satisfied if we put brown_block_1 on top of black_block_1, but for this plan, we'll just use the fact that green_block_1 will be clear.)

Let's elaborate the plan:

1. `unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1`
   - Effects: grey_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1, green_block_1 is clear, we're holding grey_block_1.

2. `putdown grey_block_1`
   - Effects: grey_block_1 is on the table, grey_block_1 is clear, we're not holding any block.

3. `unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2`
   - Effects: green_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_2, brown_block_2 is clear, we're holding green_block_1.

Now, to satisfy the 4th constraint, we can either put green_block_1 on black_block_1 or ensure that we hold black_block_1 at some point. For simplicity, let's opt for the first option. But, black_block_1 is not clear; it has black_block_2 on top. So we first need to unstack black_block_2.

4. `putdown green_block_1`
   - Effects: green_block_1 is on the table, green_block_1 is clear, we're not holding any block.

5. `unstack black_block_2 black_block_1`
   - Effects: black_block_2 is not on top of black_block_1, black_block_1 is clear, we're holding black_block_2.

6. `putdown black_block_2`
   - Effects: black_block_2 is on the table, black_block_2 is clear, we're not holding any block.

7. `pickup green_block_1`
   - Effects: we're holding green_block_1, green_block_1 is not on the table.

8. `stack green_block_1 black_block_1`
   - Effects: green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, green_block_1 is clear, black_block_1 is not clear, we're not holding any block.

9. `pickup brown_block_2`
   - Effects: we're holding brown_block_2, brown_block_2 is not on the table.

10. `putdown brown_block_2`
    - Effects: brown_block_2 is on the table, brown_block_2 is clear, we're not holding any block.

11. `unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1`
    - Effects: black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear, we're holding black_block_3.

This plan achieves the goal and satisfies all the constraints:
1. "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1" is true after step 11.
2. "the robotic arm is holding brown_block_2" is true in step 9, which is before step 11.
3. "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" is always true.
4. After step 8, "green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" is true.
5. Green_block_1 is clear after unstacking grey_block_1 from it (step 1).

Hmm, on second thought, let me check if this is the shortest valid plan. Let's see if we can eliminate any steps.

1. Unstack grey_block_1 from green_block_1. (Necessary to clear green_block_1)
2. Putdown grey_block_1. (Necessary because we need to free the arm)
3. Unstack green_block_1 from brown_block_2. (Necessary to clear brown_block_2)
4. Putdown green_block_1. (Necessary because we need to free the arm)
5. Unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1. (Necessary to clear black_block_1)
6. Putdown black_block_2. (Necessary because we need to free the arm)
7. Pickup green_block_1. (Necessary to move green_block_1 to black_block_1)
8. Stack green_block_1 on black_block_1. (Necessary to satisfy the 4th constraint)
9. Pickup brown_block_2. (Necessary to satisfy the 2nd constraint)
10. Putdown brown_block_2. (Necessary because we need to free the arm)
11. Unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1. (Necessary to achieve the goal)

All steps seem necessary given the constraints and the goal. So, this plan seems to be the shortest valid plan.

Or is it? Let's be absolutely sure:

For the 4th constraint: "if 'green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1' holds, then either 'the robotic arm is holding black_block_1' or 'green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1' must hold at the same state or after."

Since "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" is always true, we need to make sure that at some point, either the arm is holding black_block_1 or green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1.

In our plan, we opted to put green_block_1 on top of black_block_1. But, we can also satisfy this constraint by holding black_block_1 at some point.

Let's see if we can simplify our plan by choosing to hold black_block_1 instead:

1. `unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1`
   - Effects: grey_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1, green_block_1 is clear, we're holding grey_block_1.

2. `putdown grey_block_1`
   - Effects: grey_block_1 is on the table, grey_block_1 is clear, we're not holding any block.

3. `unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2`
   - Effects: green_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_2, brown_block_2 is clear, we're holding green_block_1.

4. `putdown green_block_1`
   - Effects: green_block_1 is on the table, green_block_1 is clear, we're not holding any block.

5. `unstack black_block_2 black_block_1`
   - Effects: black_block_2 is not on top of black_block_1, black_block_1 is clear, we're holding black_block_2.

6. `putdown black_block_2`
   - Effects: black_block_2 is on the table, black_block_2 is clear, we're not holding any block.

7. `pickup black_block_1`
   - Effects: we're holding black_block_1, black_block_1 is not on the table.

8. `putdown black_block_1`
    - Effects: black_block_1 is on the table, black_block_1 is clear, we're not holding any block.

9. `pickup brown_block_2`
   - Effects: we're holding brown_block_2, brown_block_2 is not on the table.

10. `putdown brown_block_2`
    - Effects: brown_block_2 is on the table, brown_block_2 is clear, we're not holding any block.

11. `unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1`
    - Effects: black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear, we're holding black_block_3.

This plan has the same number of steps (11) as the previous one. Let's check if all the constraints are satisfied:

1. "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1" is true after step 11.
2. "the robotic arm is holding brown_block_2" is true in step 9, which is before step 11.
3. "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" is always true.
4. After step 7, "the robotic arm is holding black_block_1" is true.
5. Green_block_1 is clear after unstacking grey_block_1 from it (step 1).

All constraints are satisfied.

Wait, I think there's a shorter valid plan:

1. `unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1`
   - Effects: grey_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1, green_block_1 is clear, we're holding grey_block_1.

2. `putdown grey_block_1`
   - Effects: grey_block_1 is on the table, grey_block_1 is clear, we're not holding any block.

3. `unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2`
   - Effects: green_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_2, brown_block_2 is clear, we're holding green_block_1.

4. `putdown green_block_1`
   - Effects: green_block_1 is on the table, green_block_1 is clear, we're not holding any block.

5. `unstack black_block_2 black_block_1`
   - Effects: black_block_2 is not on top of black_block_1, black_block_1 is clear, we're holding black_block_2.

6. `putdown black_block_2`
   - Effects: black_block_2 is on the table, black_block_2 is clear, we're not holding any block.

7. `pickup black_block_1`
   - Effects: we're holding black_block_1, black_block_1 is not on the table.

Actually, that doesn't allow us to hold brown_block_2, which is a constraint. So let's focus on the original plans.

Let me think step by step again:

The goal is to hold black_block_3. To do this, we need to unstack it from brown_block_1. But first, due to the constraint, we need to hold brown_block_2. So, we have to clear brown_block_2 by unstacking green_block_1 from it. To unstack green_block_1, we first need to clear it by unstacking grey_block_1.

Going through the constraints again:

1. "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1" will be true after we unstack black_block_3, which will happen eventually.
2. Before "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1" becomes true, we need to have a state where "the robotic arm is holding brown_block_2". This means we need to pick up brown_block_2 at some point before unstacking black_block_3.
3. "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" is always true.
4. Since "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" is always true, we need to make sure that at some point, either "the robotic arm is holding black_block_1" or "green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" is true.
5. At some point, either "green_block_1 is clear" or "brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" must be true.

For the 4th constraint, if we hold black_block_1, we might save a step compared to stacking green_block_1 on black_block_1. Let's go with that.

For the 5th constraint, green_block_1 will be clear after we unstack grey_block_1 from it.

So, our plan seems to be:
1. Unstack grey_block_1 from green_block_1.
2. Put grey_block_1 somewhere.
3. Unstack green_block_1 from brown_block_2.
4. Put green_block_1 somewhere.
5. Hold black_block_1 (to satisfy the 4th constraint).
   - This requires unstacking black_block_2 from black_block_1 first.
6. Pick up brown_block_2 (to satisfy the 2nd constraint).
7. Unstack black_block_3 from brown_block_1.

Plan:
1. `unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1`
   - Effects: grey_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1, green_block_1 is clear, we're holding grey_block_1.

2. `putdown grey_block_1`
   - Effects: grey_block_1 is on the table, grey_block_1 is clear, we're not holding any block.

3. `unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2`
   - Effects: green_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_2, brown_block_2 is clear, we're holding green_block_1.

4. `putdown green_block_1`
   - Effects: green_block_1 is on the table, green_block_1 is clear, we're not holding any block.

At this point, the 5th constraint is satisfied because green_block_1 is clear.

5. `unstack black_block_2 black_block_1`
   - Effects: black_block_2 is not on top of black_block_1, black_block_1 is clear, we're holding black_block_2.

6. `putdown black_block_2`
   - Effects: black_block_2 is on the table, black_block_2 is clear, we're not holding any block.

7. `pickup black_block_1`
   - Effects: we're holding black_block_1, black_block_1 is not on the table.

At this point, the 4th constraint is satisfied because we're holding black_block_1.

8. `putdown black_block_1`
   - Effects: black_block_1 is on the table, black_block_1 is clear, we're not holding any block.

9. `pickup brown_block_2`
   - Effects: we're holding brown_block_2, brown_block_2 is not on the table.

At this point, we satisfy the condition "we're holding brown_block_2", which will later allow us to satisfy the 2nd constraint.

10. `putdown brown_block_2`
    - Effects: brown_block_2 is on the table, brown_block_2 is clear, we're not holding any block.

11. `unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1`
    - Effects: black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear, we're holding black_block_3.

At this point, we satisfy the 1st constraint ("black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1") and achieve the goal (we're holding black_block_3).

The 2nd constraint is satisfied because before "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1" becomes true, we had a state (step 9) where "the robotic arm is holding brown_block_2".

All constraints are satisfied, and this plan is of the same length as the previous one.

Wait, let me double-check.  Constraint 4 says that if "green_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" holds (which is always true), then "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'you are holding black_block_1', 'green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1'" must be true at some point. This constraint is satisfied in our plan because we pick up black_block_1 at some point.

Let me check if we can simplify our plan further:

1. `unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1`
2. `putdown grey_block_1`
3. `unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2`
4. `putdown green_block_1`
5. `unstack black_block_2 black_block_1`
6. `putdown black_block_2`
7. `pickup black_block_1`
8. `putdown black_block_1`
9. `pickup brown_block_2`
10. `putdown brown_block_2`
11. `unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1`

Upon counting, we have 11 steps. All constraints are satisfied.

Is it really the shortest?

Do we need to pick up brown_block_2 and then put it down? Actually, yes. This is to satisfy constraint 2, which says that before "black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1" becomes true, there must be a state where "the robotic arm is holding brown_block_2".

Could we combine the black_block_1 manipulation with the brown_block_2 manipulation? Could we skip some of the operations with green_block_1 or grey_block_1?

Actually, we do need to clear brown_block_2 to pick it up, which means we need to remove green_block_1. And we need to clear green_block_1 to remove it, which means we need to remove grey_block_1.

It seems like the current plan is the most direct way to achieve the goal while satisfying all the constraints.

Let's re-confirm the plan:

1. `unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1`
2. `putdown grey_block_1`
3. `unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2`
4. `putdown green_block_1`
5. `unstack black_block_2 black_block_1`
6. `putdown black_block_2`
7. `pickup black_block_1`
8. `putdown black_block_1`
9. `pickup brown_block_2`
10. `putdown brown_block_2`
11. `unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1`

I believe this is the optimal plan given the constraints.

Actually, let me check if we can substitute `pickup black_block_1` with something else to satisfy constraint 4. We used `pickup black_block_1` to satisfy the constraint that either "the robotic arm is holding black_block_1" or "green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1" is true.

One alternative is to stack green_block_1 on black_block_1 instead of picking up black_block_1. This would change the plan from step 7 onwards.

7. `pickup green_block_1`
   - Effects: we're holding green_block_1, green_block_1 is not on the table.

8. `stack green_block_1 black_block_1`
   - Effects: green_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, green_block_1 is clear, black_block_1 is not clear, we're not holding any block.

9. `pickup brown_block_2`
   - Effects: we're holding brown_block_2, brown_block_2 is not on the table.

10. `putdown brown_block_2`
    - Effects: brown_block_2 is on the table, brown_block_2 is clear, we're not holding any block.

11. `unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1`
    - Effects: black_block_3 is not on top of brown_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear, we're holding black_block_3.

This plan still has 11 steps, and it satisfies all the constraints. So, whether we pick up black_block_1 or stack green_block_1 on black_block_1, both plans are of the same length. Again, it doesn't change the length of the plan.

Let me think if there's any optimiation we can make:

- Skipping the retrieval of black_block_1 and green_block_1? No, we need to satisfy constraint 4.
- Skipping the picking up and putting down of brown_block_2? No, we need to satisfy constraint 2.
- Starting from a different order? No, we need to clear brown_block_2 first, which requires clearing green_block_1, which requires clearing grey_block_1.

It seems both plans are of the same length and satisfy all the constraints. Both can be considered optimal. But for simplicity, I'll go with the first plan which involves picking up black_block_1.

So, I think the optimal plan (the shortest valid plan) is
1. `unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1`
2. `putdown grey_block_1`
3. `unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2`
4. `putdown green_block_1`
5. `unstack black_block_2 black_block_1`
6. `putdown black_block_2`
7. `pickup black_block_1`
8. `putdown black_block_1`
9. `pickup brown_block_2`
10. `putdown brown_block_2`
11. `unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1`

This should achieve the goal and satisfy all the constraints in the least number of actions.

One final thing to check: the plan terminates when we've achieved the goal state (holding black_block_3), and all the constraints are satisfied. The goal is achieved at step 11, and we've already checked that all constraints are satisfied by that point.

In conclusion, the optimal plan is:
1. `unstack grey_block_1 green_block_1`
2. `putdown grey_block_1`
3. `unstack green_block_1 brown_block_2`
4. `putdown green_block_1`
5. `unstack black_block_2 black_block_1`
6. `putdown black_block_2`
7. `pickup black_block_1`
8. `putdown black_block_1`
9. `pickup brown_block_2`
10. `putdown brown_block_2`
11. `unstack black_block_3 brown_block_1`
