Alright, so I have a Blocksworld planning problem. Let me break it down:

**Initial State**:
- black_block_1 is on the table and clear
- red_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2 and clear
- brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- green_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1 and clear
- The agent is not holding any block

Visually, this looks like:
```
   green_block_1     green_block_2
        |                |
   black_block_2      brown_block_1
        |                |
    red_block_1      orange_block_1

   black_block_1     
```

**Goal**:
- red_block_1 is clear (no block on top of it)

**Constraints**:
1. At some point, the agent must be holding black_block_2.
2. If the agent is holding black_block_2, then in an earlier state either green_block_2 must have had a block on top of it, or the agent must have been holding orange_block_1.
3. At some point, either black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2, or red_block_1 is not on the table.
4. In every state, green_block_1 cannot be on the table.

Let's think through this:

1. In the initial state, red_block_1 has black_block_2 on top of it, and black_block_2 has green_block_1 on top of it. To make red_block_1 clear, I need to remove both black_block_2 and green_block_1 from above it.

2. To handle the constraint that at some point I must be holding black_block_2, I'll need to unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. But before doing that, I need to remove green_block_1 from on top of black_block_2.

3. To handle the constraint that if I am holding black_block_2, then in an earlier state either green_block_2 must not be clear or I must be holding orange_block_1, I have a choice:
   - Make green_block_2 not clear (put a block on top of it), or
   - Hold orange_block_1 before holding black_block_2.

4. To handle the constraint that at some point either black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2, or red_block_1 is not on the table, I have a choice:
   - Place black_block_2 on top of green_block_2, or
   - Move red_block_1 from the table to somewhere else.

5. To handle the constraint that green_block_1 cannot be on the table, I need to make sure that when I unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2, I don't put it on the table.

Let's try to formulate a plan:

1. First, I need to handle the second constraint. So, I'll first remove green_block_2 from on top of brown_block_1, put something on top of green_block_2 (to make it not clear), or hold orange_block_1. Let's go with the last option because it's most direct.
   - unstack green_block_2 brown_block_1
   - putdown green_block_2
   - unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
   - putdown brown_block_1
   - pickup orange_block_1
   - putdown orange_block_1

2. Now I can satisfy the constraint that I need to be holding black_block_2 at some point. But I first need to unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2.
   - unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
   But wait, I can't put green_block_1 on the table due to the fourth constraint. So I need to stack it somewhere. Let's stack it on green_block_2.
   - stack green_block_1 green_block_2
   - unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
   
3. Now I'm holding black_block_2. I need to decide where to place it. I can either put it on top of green_block_2 to satisfy the third constraint, or make red_block_1 not on the table. Let's go with the first option:
   But wait, I've already placed green_block_1 on top of green_block_2, so green_block_2 is no longer clear. I can either put black_block_2 on top of something else or remove green_block_1 from green_block_2 and then place black_block_2 on green_block_2.

Wait, this is getting complex. Let me rethink.

The goal is to have red_block_1 clear. In the initial state, black_block_2 and green_block_1 are above red_block_1. So we need to remove them.

Let's think about the constraints again:
1. At some point, the agent must be holding black_block_2.
2. If the agent is holding black_block_2, then in an earlier state either green_block_2 must have had a block on top of it, or the agent must have been holding orange_block_1.
3. At some point, either black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2, or red_block_1 is not on the table.
4. In every state, green_block_1 cannot be on the table.

I think the most direct way to approach this is:

1. First, I need to satisfy constraint 2. I can do this by either making green_block_2 not clear or by holding orange_block_1. Let's do the latter:
   - unstack green_block_2 brown_block_1
   - putdown green_block_2
   - unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
   - putdown brown_block_1
   - pickup orange_block_1
   - putdown orange_block_1

2. Now, I can work towards constraint 3. I need to either put black_block_2 on top of green_block_2 or move red_block_1 from the table. Let's aim for the first:
   - unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
   But I can't put green_block_1 on the table due to constraint 4.
   - stack green_block_1 black_block_1
   - unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
   Now I'm holding black_block_2, satisfying constraint 1.
   - stack black_block_2 green_block_2
   Now black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2, satisfying constraint 3.

3. At this point, red_block_1 is clear, which is the goal.

Let's double-check this plan against the constraints:
1. At some point, I am holding black_block_2. This is satisfied when I unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.
2. Before I held black_block_2, I held orange_block_1. This satisfies the condition that if I am holding black_block_2, then in an earlier state either green_block_2 must have had a block on top of it, or I must have been holding orange_block_1.
3. At some point, black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2. This is satisfied.
4. Green_block_1 is never on the table. It starts on top of black_block_2 and I move it to black_block_1. This is satisfied.

Now, let's also check if the plan is optimal, meaning it's the shortest possible plan that achieves the goal and satisfies all the constraints.

The goal is to have red_block_1 clear. We need to:
1. Remove green_block_1 and black_block_2 from the stack on top of red_block_1. This takes at least 2 unstack actions.
2. Place these blocks somewhere. This takes at least 2 stack actions.
3. To satisfy constraint 1, we need to hold black_block_2 at some point, which happens naturally as part of the unstacking process.
4. To satisfy constraint 2, we need to either hold orange_block_1 or make green_block_2 non-clear before holding black_block_2. The direct way to hold orange_block_1 involves unstack and putdown actions for green_block_2 and brown_block_1, plus a pickup and putdown for orange_block_1, which totals 6 actions.
5. To satisfy constraint 3, we chose to place black_block_2 on green_block_2, which happens as one of the stack actions mentioned in point 2.
6. Constraint 4 forces us to place green_block_1 somewhere other than the table, which is also covered in point 2.

So, the minimal number of actions seems to be: 2 (unstack) + 2 (stack) + 6 (handle orange_block_1) = 10 actions.

Let's re-count the actions in our plan:
1. unstack green_block_2 brown_block_1
2. putdown green_block_2
3. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
4. putdown brown_block_1
5. pickup orange_block_1
6. putdown orange_block_1
7. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
8. stack green_block_1 black_block_1
9. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
10. stack black_block_2 green_block_2

That's 10 actions, which matches our minimal count. But let's see if there's a more efficient way:

Actually, there might be a more direct way to satisfy constraint 2. Instead of the detour to hold orange_block_1, we can directly place a block on top of green_block_2. This would save us from having to manipulate the orange_block_1 tower.

Let's try a different approach:

1. First, I unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2 and place it on top of green_block_2 to make green_block_2 not clear. This satisfies part of constraint 2 (the part about green_block_2 not being clear).
   - unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
   - stack green_block_1 green_block_2

2. Now, I can unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. This satisfies constraint 1 (at some point, I'm holding black_block_2).
   - unstack black_block_2 red_block_1

3. At this point, the goal is already achieved (red_block_1 is clear). But I still need to place black_block_2 somewhere. Due to constraint 3, I need to either put black_block_2 on top of green_block_2 or move red_block_1 from the table. But I can't put black_block_2 on top of green_block_2 because green_block_1 is already there. So, I'll need to move red_block_1 off the table. Since I'm already holding black_block_2, I need to place it somewhere else first:
   - stack black_block_2 black_block_1
   - pickup red_block_1
   - putdown red_block_1 (or stack it somewhere)

But this doesn't actually satisfy constraint 3, since I'm just putting red_block_1 back on the table.

Let me rethink this. Constraint 3 requires that at some point, either black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2, or red_block_1 is not on the table. If I place green_block_1 on top of green_block_2, then I can't place black_block_2 on top of green_block_2. So, I need to make sure red_block_1 is off the table at some point.

Let's adjust our approach:

1. I unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2 and place it on black_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 4).
   - unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
   - stack green_block_1 black_block_1

2. Now, I can unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1. At this point, red_block_1 is clear (the goal).
   - unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
   
3. To satisfy constraint 3, I need to either place black_block_2 on top of green_block_2 or move red_block_1 off the table. Let's move red_block_1:
   - stack black_block_2 green_block_2
   - pickup red_block_1
   - stack red_block_1 brown_block_1
   
But wait, this doesn't work because I need to satisfy constraint 2 before constraint 1. That is, before I unstack black_block_2 (making me hold black_block_2), I need to ensure that green_block_2 is not clear or I've held orange_block_1.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me reapproach it:

1. First, I need to make green_block_2 not clear to satisfy part of constraint 2. I can do this by placing a block on top of green_block_2. I need to be strategic here:
   - unstack green_block_2 brown_block_1
   - putdown green_block_2
   - unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
   - stack brown_block_1 green_block_2
   
2. Now, I can work on removing the blocks on top of red_block_1:
   - unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
   - stack green_block_1 orange_block_1 (to keep green_block_1 off the table)
   
3. Now, I can unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1, which satisfies constraint 1:
   - unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
   
4. To satisfy constraint 3, I need to either place black_block_2 on top of green_block_2 or move red_block_1 off the table. I can't place black_block_2 on green_block_2 because brown_block_1 is already there. So, I'll move red_block_1:
   - stack black_block_2 black_block_1
   - pickup red_block_1
   - stack red_block_1 black_block_2
   
5. However, now red_block_1 is not clear anymore, which contradicts our goal. So, I need to adjust.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's break down the constraints once more:

1. At some point, the agent must be holding black_block_2. This will happen when I unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.
2. If the agent is holding black_block_2, then in an earlier state either green_block_2 must have had a block on top of it, or the agent must have been holding orange_block_1. This is an if-then constraint. It says that IF I'm holding black_block_2, THEN an earlier condition must have been met. I don't necessarily need to make the condition true; I just need to ensure that IF I hold black_block_2, the condition has been met.
3. At some point, either black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2, or red_block_1 is not on the table. This says that at some point in the plan, one of these two conditions must be true.
4. In every state, green_block_1 cannot be on the table. This is a universal constraint that must always be satisfied.

Given these interpretations, I think I can have a simpler plan than what I've been attempting.

The key insight is that constraint 2 doesn't mandate that I make green_block_2 non-clear or hold orange_block_1. It simply says that IF I'm holding black_block_2, THEN one of those conditions must have been met earlier.

However, since I need to hold black_block_2 to achieve the goal, and constraint 2 applies whenever I hold black_block_2, I do need to make one of those conditions true before holding black_block_2.

Let's try to address these constraints by manipulating green_block_2 first:

1. First, I need to ensure that constraint 2 is addressed before I unstack black_block_2:
   - unstack green_block_2 brown_block_1
   - putdown green_block_2
   - unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
   - stack brown_block_1 green_block_2
   
2. Now green_block_2 is not clear. I can proceed to unstacking the blocks on top of red_block_1:
   - unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
   - stack green_block_1 orange_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 4)
   
3. Now black_block_2 is clear, and I can unstack it:
   - unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
   
4. At this point, red_block_1 is clear (the goal). But I also need to satisfy constraint 3. I've already made green_block_2 not clear by placing brown_block_1 on it. To place black_block_2 on green_block_2, I'd need to remove brown_block_1 first. 

   Alternatively, I can move red_block_1 off the table:
   - stack black_block_2 black_block_1
   - pickup red_block_1
   - stack red_block_1 black_block_2
   
   But this would make red_block_1 not clear anymore.

Let's redo this by considering the third constraint.

Actually I think the key insight is that I need to make red_block_1 clear while also satisfying constraint 3. This means I need to decide if I'll put black_block_2 on green_block_2 after unstacking it, or if I'll move red_block_1 off the table at some point.

Let's proceed with the plan to place black_block_2 on green_block_2 after unstacking it:

1. First, I need to address constraint 2. I need to ensure green_block_2 is not clear or I've held orange_block_1 before holding black_block_2. But I'll need to put black_block_2 on green_block_2 later, so green_block_2 must be clear then.

   I can handle this by holding orange_block_1 first:
   - unstack green_block_2 brown_block_1
   - putdown green_block_2
   - unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
   - putdown brown_block_1
   - pickup orange_block_1
   - putdown orange_block_1
   
2. Now I need to unstack the blocks on top of red_block_1:
   - unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
   - stack green_block_1 black_block_1 (to keep green_block_1 off the table)
   
3. Now I can unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1:
   - unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
   
   At this point, red_block_1 is clear, satisfying the goal. I'm also holding black_block_2, which satisfies constraint 1.
   
4. To satisfy constraint 3, I place black_block_2 on green_block_2:
   - stack black_block_2 green_block_2

Let me check this plan against the constraints:
1. At some point, I'm holding black_block_2. This is satisfied after I unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.
2. If I'm holding black_block_2, then in an earlier state either green_block_2 had a block on top of it, or I was holding orange_block_1. This is satisfied because I've held orange_block_1 before.
3. At some point, black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2 or red_block_1 is not on the table. This is satisfied because I place black_block_2 on green_block_2.
4. Green_block_1 is never on the table. It starts on top of black_block_2 and I move it to black_block_1. This is satisfied.

The goal is also satisfied because red_block_1 becomes clear after I unstack black_block_2 from it, and it remains clear for the rest of the plan.

Let's recount the steps:
1. unstack green_block_2 brown_block_1
2. putdown green_block_2
3. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
4. putdown brown_block_1
5. pickup orange_block_1
6. putdown orange_block_1
7. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
8. stack green_block_1 black_block_1
9. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
10. stack black_block_2 green_block_2

We have 10 actions again, which seems optimal for the problem. It satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal.

But wait, I think there's a more efficient solution. Instead of manipulating the entire orange_block_1 tower to hold orange_block_1, I can simply make green_block_2 not clear after I've unstacked green_block_1 from black_block_2. This would require fewer actions:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2:
   - unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
   - stack green_block_1 green_block_2
   
   Now green_block_2 is not clear, which addresses part of constraint 2.
   
2. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1:
   - unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
   
   At this point, red_block_1 is clear (the goal). I've also satisfied constraint 1 by holding black_block_2.
   
3. I still need to place black_block_2 somewhere. Due to constraint 3, I need to either place black_block_2 on green_block_2 or move red_block_1 off the table. 

   I can't place black_block_2 on green_block_2 directly, because green_block_1 is already there.

   I could try rearranging:
   - stack black_block_2 black_block_1
   - unstack green_block_1 green_block_2
   - stack green_block_1 brown_block_1 (to keep green_block_1 off the table)
   - unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
   - stack black_block_2 green_block_2
   
   This would satisfy constraint 3, but it's more actions.

   Alternatively, I can move red_block_1 off the table:
   - stack black_block_2 black_block_1
   - pickup red_block_1
   - stack red_block_1 brown_block_1
   
   This also satisfies constraint 3 and takes fewer additional actions.

Let's go with the plan to move red_block_1 off the table:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2:
   - unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
   - stack green_block_1 green_block_2
   
2. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1:
   - unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
   
3. Move red_block_1 off the table to satisfy constraint 3:
   - stack black_block_2 black_block_1
   - pickup red_block_1
   - stack red_block_1 brown_block_1
   
But wait, if I move red_block_1 off the table and place a block on top of it, it's no longer clear, which contradicts the goal. So, I can't do that. I must ensure red_block_1 remains clear throughout the plan.

Let's approach it from another angle.

Actually I think the confusion arises from the goal. We are told the goal is `red_block_1 is clear` but we don't need to preserve this forever. Once we reach a state where red_block_1 is clear, we can do whatever (including stacking more blocks on it).

Let's reapproach:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2:
   - unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
   - stack green_block_1 green_block_2 (to satisfy constraint 4)
   Now green_block_2 has green_block_1, making it not clear. This satisfies part of constraint 2.
   
2. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1:
   - unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
   Now red_block_1 is clear, and I've satisfied the goal.
   I've also satisfied constraint 1 by holding black_block_2.
   
3. I can place black_block_2 anywhere. Since both constraint 2 and the goal are satisfied, I'll just continue with a simple action:
   - stack black_block_2 black_block_1

Let's check the constraints again:
1. At some point, I'm holding black_block_2. This is satisfied after I unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.
2. If I'm holding black_block_2, then in an earlier state either green_block_2 must have had a block on top of it, or I was holding orange_block_1. This is satisfied because green_block_2 had green_block_1 on top of it before I unstacked black_block_2.
3. At some point, black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2 or red_block_1 is not on the table. Hmm, this isn't satisfied in the above plan. Let's modify it.

If I can't place black_block_2 on green_block_2 directly (because green_block_1 is there), I need to ensure red_block_1 is off the table at some point. I need to adjust step 3:

3. Instead of placing black_block_2 on black_block_1, I'll place it on orange_block_1:
   - stack black_block_2 orange_block_1
   - pickup red_block_1
   - stack red_block_1 black_block_1
   
   Now red_block_1 is off the table, satisfying constraint 3.
   
But this violates the core goal. While red_block_1 was clear at some point, we need to ensure it's still clear at the end of the plan, as that's the goal.

Actually, I don't believe that's the case. We were simply asked to bring about the situation where red_block_1 is clear. We have satisfied this by unstacking black_block_2. The fact that the problem doesn't end immediately after the goal is achieved doesn't mean the goal has to be maintained throughout the entire plan. It just means there might be additional constraints that need to be satisfied.

Let's try to restructure the plan once more:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2:
   - unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
   - stack green_block_1 green_block_2
   
2. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1:
   - unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
   
   At this point, red_block_1 is clear (the goal). I've also satisfied constraint 1 by holding black_block_2 and constraint 2 because green_block_2 wasn't clear in an earlier state.
   
3. To satisfy constraint 3, I need to either place black_block_2 on green_block_2 or make red_block_1 not on the table. I'll go with the latter:
   - stack black_block_2 black_block_1
   - pickup red_block_1
   - stack red_block_1 orange_block_1
   
Let's check the constraints:
1. At some point, I'm holding black_block_2. This is satisfied after I unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.
2. If I'm holding black_block_2, then in an earlier state either green_block_2 had a block on top of it, or I was holding orange_block_1. This is satisfied because green_block_2 had green_block_1 on top of it before I unstacked black_block_2.
3. At some point, black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2 or red_block_1 is not on the table. This is satisfied because red_block_1 is not on the table in step 3.
4. Green_block_1 is never on the table. It starts on top of black_block_2 and is moved to green_block_2. This is satisfied.

However, I'm now uncertain if the goal of making red_block_1 clear is a terminal goal (it needs to be true at the end of the plan) or just a transient goal (it needs to be true at some point in the plan).

After rereading the problem, it seems like the task is to "bring about the following situation: 'red_block_1 is clear'". This sounds like the situation needs to be achieved but not necessarily maintained throughout the plan. Since I've achieved the goal by unstacking black_block_2 from red_block_1, and I've also satisfied all the constraints, the plan seems valid.

Let's count the steps:
1. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
2. stack green_block_1 green_block_2
3. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
4. stack black_block_2 black_block_1
5. pickup red_block_1
6. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1

That's 6 actions. Much fewer than our earlier plan with 10 actions.

Let's double-check constraints:
1. We satisfy constraint 1 after unstacking black_block_2.
2. We satisfy constraint 2 because green_block_2 was not clear in an earlier state (it had green_block_1 on top of it).
3. We satisfy constraint 3 because red_block_1 is not on the table in steps 5 and 6.
4. Green_block_1 is never on the table. It starts on top of black_block_2 and is moved to green_block_2. This is satisfied.

We satisfy the goal after step 3, where red_block_1 becomes clear. While it's not clear at the end of the plan, the goal is to "bring about the situation", which means making it happen at some point.

But on further reflection: Is the goal a state or an event? It is a state, so it makes more sense to try to maintain the goal throughout the rest of the plan.

Let's go back to my plan:
1. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
2. stack green_block_1 green_block_2
3. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
4. stack black_block_2 black_block_1
5. pickup red_block_1
6. stack red_block_1 orange_block_1

After step 3, I say that my goal of "red_block_1 is clear" is achieved. If the goal is to just bring about this situation once, then the rest of the steps serve only to satisfy the additional constraints. If however the goal is supposed to be true at the end of the execution, then I fail in my above plan because red_block_1 is no longer clear after I stack it on orange_block_1 (something is on top of orange_block_1).

But when I reread the problem statement, it says "The task is to bring about the following situation: 'red_block_1 is clear'". "Bring about" suggests making the situation happen, not necessarily maintaining it. But to be safe, let's ensure red_block_1 is clear at the end of the plan.

Revisiting the constraints, especially constraint 3, we need to ensure that at some point in the plan, either black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2 or red_block_1 is not on the table.

After I unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2, I placed it on green_block_2. To put black_block_2 on green_block_2, I'd need to first remove green_block_1. This would require more actions:

1. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2:
   - unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
   - stack green_block_1 brown_block_1 (or any other clear block except green_block_2)
   
2. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1:
   - unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
   - stack black_block_2 green_block_2
   
At this point, red_block_1 is clear, black_block_2 is on green_block_2, and all the constraints are satisfied.

Let's check the constraints:
1. At some point, I'm holding black_block_2. This is satisfied after I unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.
2. If I'm holding black_block_2, then in an earlier state either green_block_2 had a block on top of it, or I was holding orange_block_1. Wait, this might not be satisfied. Green_block_2 was always clear in this plan, and I've never held orange_block_1.

I need to revise. Let's start by making sure green_block_2 is not clear at some point before holding black_block_2:

1. Make green_block_2 not clear:
   - unstack green_block_2 brown_block_1
   - putdown green_block_2
   - unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
   - stack brown_block_1 green_block_2
   
2. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2:
   - unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
   - stack green_block_1 black_block_1 (to keep it off the table)
   
3. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1:
   - unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
   
4. To satisfy constraint 3, I need to either place black_block_2 on green_block_2 or move red_block_1 off the table. But green_block_2 has brown_block_1 on it, so I'd need to remove that first. Actually, let's go with the plan to place black_block_2 on green_block_2:
   - stack black_block_2 orange_block_1
   - unstack brown_block_1 green_block_2
   - stack brown_block_1 black_block_2
   - unstack black_block_2 orange_block_1
   - stack black_block_2 green_block_2
   
   I think this is too many actions. Let's try a different approach.

Let's go back to the drawing board. The simplest way to ensure red_block_1 is clear is to unstack black_block_2 and green_block_1 from on top of it. But before I unstack black_block_2, I need to satisfy constraint 2. This means either making green_block_2 not clear or holding orange_block_1.

Actually, maybe it's simpler to just satisfy constraint 2 by holding orange_block_1 first:

1. Manipulate the right-side tower to hold orange_block_1:
   - unstack green_block_2 brown_block_1
   - putdown green_block_2
   - unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
   - putdown brown_block_1
   - pickup orange_block_1
   - putdown orange_block_1
   
2. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2:
   - unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
   - stack green_block_1 brown_block_1 (to keep it off the table)
   
3. Unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1:
   - unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
   
4. To satisfy constraint 3, I need to either place black_block_2 on green_block_2 or move red_block_1 off the table. I'll place black_block_2 on green_block_2:
   - stack black_block_2 green_block_2
   
Let's check the constraints:
1. At some point, I'm holding black_block_2. This is satisfied after I unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.
2. If I'm holding black_block_2, then in an earlier state either green_block_2 had a block on top of it, or I was holding orange_block_1. This is satisfied because I held orange_block_1 before unstacking black_block_2.
3. At some point, black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2 or red_block_1 is not on the table. This is satisfied because I place black_block_2 on green_block_2.
4. Green_block_1 is never on the table. It starts on top of black_block_2 and is moved to brown_block_1. This is satisfied.

And the goal is still satisfied: red_block_1 is clear after I unstack black_block_2 from it.

But again, I notice that we use 10 actions:
1. unstack green_block_2 brown_block_1
2. putdown green_block_2
3. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
4. putdown brown_block_1
5. pickup orange_block_1
6. putdown orange_block_1
7. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
8. stack green_block_1 brown_block_1
9. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
10. stack black_block_2 green_block_2

Can we do better?

Maybe. Instead of just holding orange_block_1, I could try to satisfy constraint 2 by making green_block_2 not clear. But this involves manipulating the right-side tower as well, and I'd still have to move blocks around.

Let's try a different structure:
1. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
2. stack green_block_1 green_block_2
3. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
4. stack black_block_2 black_block_1

This satisfies the goal and constraints 1, 2 and 4. But it doesn't satisfy constraint 3 (at some point, black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2 or red_block_1 is not on the table).

To satisfy constraint 3, I'd need to either place black_block_2 on green_block_2 (which I can't do directly because green_block_1 is there) or move red_block_1 off the table.

Huh wait, I realize that the constraint also just says that this must hold in at least one state, not that it must be true at the end. So I could add additional steps to my plan to make one of those conditions true, and then return back to my current state.

Actually, I think there's a simpler approach. Let's start with the obvious steps:
1. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
2. stack green_block_1 green_block_2 (to keep it off the table)
3. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
At this point, red_block_1 is clear (the goal).

I've satisfied constraint 1 by holding black_block_2.
I've satisfied constraint 2 because green_block_2 had green_block_1 on top of it before I unstacked black_block_2.
I need to satisfy constraint 3 (at some point, black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2 or red_block_1 is not on the table).

I'll temporarily move red_block_1 off the table to satisfy constraint 3:
4. stack black_block_2 black_block_1
5. pickup red_block_1
6. stack red_block_1 black_block_2
7. unstack red_block_1 black_block_2
8. putdown red_block_1

This way, red_block_1 is back on the table and clear at the end.

Let's check the constraints again:
1. At some point, I'm holding black_block_2. This is satisfied after I unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.
2. If I'm holding black_block_2, then in an earlier state either green_block_2 had a block on top of it, or I was holding orange_block_1. This is satisfied because green_block_2 had green_block_1 on top of it before I unstacked black_block_2.
3. At some point, black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2 or red_block_1 is not on the table. This is satisfied because red_block_1 is not on the table after I pick it up.
4. Green_block_1 is never on the table. It starts on top of black_block_2 and is moved to green_block_2. This is satisfied.

And the goal is satisfied because red_block_1 is clear at the end.

But this is 8 steps:
1. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
2. stack green_block_1 green_block_2
3. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
4. stack black_block_2 black_block_1
5. pickup red_block_1
6. stack red_block_1 black_block_2
7. unstack red_block_1 black_block_2
8. putdown red_block_1

Let me check if I can optimize further. Hmm, actually if we interpret the goal to be true at some point, not at the end, we could actually just stop at step 7 -- we would have made red_block_1 clear at some point.

But let me try to optimize a bit more.

Aha, actually, we don't need to stack red_block_1 on black_block_2. We could also put it on anything else, like brown_block_1. This might be more efficient if for some reason we needed to manipulate red_block_1 again.

Actually, wait. Brown_block_1 has a whole tower on top of it. So it's not clear. I should pick a clear block to place red_block_1 on. Maybe black_block_1?

So here's a revised plan:
1. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
2. stack green_block_1 green_block_2
3. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
4. stack black_block_2 black_block_1
5. pickup red_block_1
6. stack red_block_1 green_block_1
7. unstack red_block_1 green_block_1
8. putdown red_block_1

But wait, I can't really stack red_block_1 on green_block_1, because green_block_1 has been stacked on green_block_2.

So, I guess the above plan is probably optimal:
1. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
2. stack green_block_1 green_block_2
3. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
4. stack black_block_2 black_block_1
5. pickup red_block_1
6. stack red_block_1 black_block_2
7. unstack red_block_1 black_block_2
8. putdown red_block_1

But actually, let me check once more if there's a simpler approach to the problem.

Ahhh wait! I should have actually looked at constraint 3 from the beginning. Constraint 3 says "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2", "red_block_1 is not on the table"'".

If I make sure that black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2, then I wouldn't need to move red_block_1 off the table!

So, a more concise plan would be:
1. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
2. stack green_block_1 black_block_1 (to keep green_block_1 off the table)
3. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1 (now red_block_1 is clear, satisfying the goal)
4. stack black_block_2 green_block_2 (satisfying constraint 3)

Let's check the constraints:
1. At some point, I'm holding black_block_2. This is satisfied after I unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1.
2. If I'm holding black_block_2, then in an earlier state either green_block_2 had a block on top of it, or I was holding orange_block_1. Wait, this might not be satisfied. Green_block_2 was always clear in this plan, and I've never held orange_block_1.

Ugh, let me remember to check all constraints for every plan. For constraint 2, if I'm holding black_block_2, I need to have either made green_block_2 not clear or held orange_block_1 before that.

Maybe I need to combine these approaches. Let me think freshly, starting from constraint 2, which I keep missing.

Actually constraint 2 says: "If expression "you are holding black_block_2" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "there is a block on top of green_block_2, i.e., green_block_2 is not clear", "you are holding orange_block_1""

So this means that before I unstack black_block_2 (which would make me hold black_block_2), I need to have satisfied one of these two conditions:
- green_block_2 had a block on top of it 
- I was holding orange_block_1

Let's go with the option of having a block on top of green_block_2. I could use green_block_1 for this, since I need to move it off black_block_2 anyway.

Here's a revised plan:
1. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
2. stack green_block_1 green_block_2
3. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1 (now red_block_1 is clear, satisfying the goal)
4. stack black_block_2 black_block_1

But wait, I also need to satisfy constraint 3: at some point, black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2 or red_block_1 is not on the table.

Since I can't directly place black_block_2 on green_block_2 after step 3 (because green_block_1 is there), I'd need to either move green_block_1 first or move red_block_1 off the table.

Let's try moving green_block_1 first:
5. unstack green_block_1 green_block_2
6. stack green_block_1 orange_block_1 (to keep green_block_1 off the table)
7. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
8. stack black_block_2 green_block_2

This should satisfy all the constraints and the goal.

But actually, I think I forgot to account for the fact that I placed green_block_1 on green_block_2 to satisfy constraint 2, and I'm kind of undoing that by unstacking it. I need to be more careful.

So, to satisfy constraint 2, before I hold black_block_2, either green_block_2 must have a block on it or I must have held orange_block_1. I'll go with the first option by placing green_block_1 on green_block_2.

To satisfy constraint 3, at some point, black_block_2 must be on green_block_2 or red_block_1 must be off the table. I'll go with the first option, but I'd need to remove green_block_1 from green_block_2 first.

Here's the integrated plan:
1. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
2. stack green_block_1 green_block_2
3. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1 (now red_block_1 is clear)
4. stack black_block_2 black_block_1
5. unstack green_block_1 green_block_2
6. stack green_block_1 brown_block_1 (to keep green_block_1 off the table)
7. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
8. stack black_block_2 green_block_2

Actually, I realize now that if I place black_block_2 on green_block_2, I'm satisfying both constraints 1 and 3:
1. I've held black_block_2 at some point (right after I unstacked it).
2. green_block_1 was on green_block_2 before I held black_block_2, satisfying the condition in constraint 2.
3. black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2 at the end, fulfilling constraint 3.
4. Green_block_1 is never on the table, satisfying constraint 4.

But this requires 8 steps:
1. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
2. stack green_block_1 green_block_2
3. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
4. stack black_block_2 black_block_1
5. unstack green_block_1 green_block_2
6. stack green_block_1 brown_block_1
7. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
8. stack black_block_2 green_block_2

I wonder if there's an even shorter plan. But actually I believe this is optimal.

Actually wait, I can shorten this.

If I want to place black_block_2 on green_block_2, I first need to clear both of them. But green_block_2 might be below green_block_1, so I need to move green_block_1 first. And black_block_2 might be below red_block_1, so I need to move red_block_1 first.

Let's build this from scratch.
1. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
2. stack green_block_1 black_block_1
3. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
4. stack black_block_2 green_block_2

This is only 4 steps and I'm still accomplishing the same stuff. Green_block_2 is clear when I unstack green_block_1, which means this plan would violate constraint 2 (if I'm holding black_block_2, green_block_2 must have had a block on it or I must have held orange_block_1 before).

Alright, let's try a completely different approach. I think it depends on constraint 2, which has been tricky to account for.

Constraint 2: "If expression "you are holding black_block_2" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "there is a block on top of green_block_2, i.e., green_block_2 is not clear", "you are holding orange_block_1""

If I look at the initial state, green_block_2 is clear. It doesn't have a block on top of it. Now, I'll need to hold black_block_2 to achieve the goal, so to satisfy constraint 2, I must either make green_block_2 not clear before holding black_block_2, or I must hold orange_block_1 before holding black_block_2.

If I try to make green_block_2 not clear:
1. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
2. stack green_block_1 green_block_2
3. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
and so on as I was thinking.

But this is still 8 steps. Instead let me do the other option:
If I hold orange_block_1 first:
1. unstack green_block_2 brown_block_1
2. putdown green_block_2
3. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
4. putdown brown_block_1
5. pickup orange_block_1
6. putdown orange_block_1
7. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
8. stack green_block_1 black_block_1
9. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
10. stack black_block_2 green_block_2

This is 10 steps. So yeah, the previous 8-step plan seems better.

Actually let me consider one more variation, a sort of middle version of these two:
1. unstack green_block_2 brown_block_1
2. stack green_block_2 black_block_1
3. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
4. stack green_block_1 green_block_2
5. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
6. stack black_block_2 brown_block_1
7. unstack green_block_1 green_block_2
8. stack green_block_1 black_block_2
9. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1
10. stack green_block_2 orange_block_1

Ugh no that's longer and doesn't even clearly satisfy the constraints. The issue is that any time I try to hold orange_block_1, I need to first get green_block_2 and brown_block_1 off of it.

So I think the best combination is this plan:
1. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
2. stack green_block_1 green_block_2
3. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
4. stack black_block_2 black_block_1
5. unstack green_block_1 green_block_2
6. stack green_block_1 brown_block_1
7. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
8. stack black_block_2 green_block_2

This satisfies:
1. Constraint 1: I hold black_block_2 after step 3.
2. Constraint 2: Before holding black_block_2, green_block_2 had green_block_1 on top of it.
3. Constraint 3: black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2 after step 8.
4. Constraint 4: green_block_1 is never on the table. It goes from black_block_2 to green_block_2 to brown_block_1.
5. The goal: red_block_1 becomes clear after step 3 and remains clear.

So it should be a valid plan, and I believe it's also optimal at 8 steps. On a side note, I think we could've potentially achieved the goal by just doing step 3 (unstack black_block_2 red_block_1), but that would have violated the constraints. The constraints forced us to perform additional steps to make sure they're all satisfied.

Let's do a quick sanity check for all constraints:
1. At some point, I'm holding black_block_2. I hold black_block_2 after step 3 and after step 7. So, constraint 1 is satisfied.
2. If I'm holding black_block_2, then in an earlier state either green_block_2 had a block on top of it or I was holding orange_block_1. At step 3, I hold black_block_2, and before that, green_block_2 had green_block_1 on top of it due to step 2.
3. At some point, black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2 or red_block_1 is not on the table. After step 8, black_block_2 is on top of green_block_2.
4. In every state, green_block_1 cannot be on the table. green_block_1 is never on the table in the plan; it goes from black_block_2 to green_block_2 to brown_block_1.

All the constraints are satisfied. I unstack black_block_2 from red_block_1 in step 3, which makes red_block_1 clear, and red_block_1 remains clear throughout the rest of the plan. So, the goal is also achieved.

I believe this is the optimal valid plan.

Here's the final plan:
1. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
2. stack green_block_1 green_block_2
3. unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
4. stack black_block_2 black_block_1
5. unstack green_block_1 green_block_2
6. stack green_block_1 brown_block_1
7. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
8. stack black_block_2 green_block_2
