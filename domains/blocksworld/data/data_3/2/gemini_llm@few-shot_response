Okay, let's break this down. The goal is to make red_block_1 clear. Currently, black_block_2 is on red_block_1, and green_block_1 is on black_block_2. So, we need to move green_block_1 and black_block_2. Also, we have constraints to satisfy.

Here's the plan:

```
```
unstack green_block_2 brown_block_1
pickup green_block_2
putdown green_block_2
unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
pickup brown_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
pickup green_block_1
putdown green_block_1
unstack black_block_2 red_block_1
pickup black_block_2
putdown black_block_2
```
