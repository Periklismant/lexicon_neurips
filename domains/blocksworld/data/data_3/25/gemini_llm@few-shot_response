Okay, this is a complex blocksworld problem with several constraints. Here's my plan to solve it, along with explanations of how it addresses each constraint:

**Understanding the Goal and Constraints**

*   **Goal:** Holding green_block_1.
*   **Constraint 1:** `blue_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1` must be true at some point.
*   **Constraint 2:** If `blue_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1` is true, then `black_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2` must be true at that state or a later state.
*   **Constraint 3:** `orange_block_1 is clear` must be true at some point.
*   **Constraint 4:** If `orange_block_1 is clear` is true, then `black_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1` or `you are holding black_block_1` must have been true in an earlier state.
*   **Constraint 5:** `orange_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1` must be true at some point.
*   **Constraint 6:** If `orange_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1` is true, then `you are holding black_block_1` or `brown_block_1 is on the table` must be true at that state or a later state.

**High-Level Strategy**

The key is to satisfy the constraints while working towards the goal. I'll need to move blocks around to make green_block_1 clear and then pick it up. The constraints involving `blue_block_1`, `orange_block_1`, `orange_block_2` and `black_block_1` will influence the order of operations.

**Plan**

```
```
unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
putdown brown_block_1
unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1
putdown orange_block_2
unstack red_block_1 blue_block_1
putdown red_block_1
pickup blue_block_1
stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1
pickup black_block_1
stack black_block_1 orange_block_2
unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1
pickup green_block_1
```

**Explanation of how the plan satisfies the constraints:**

1.  **Initial State:**
    *   `orange_block_1` has `green_block_1` on it.
    *   `blue_block_1` has `red_block_1` and `orange_block_2` and `brown_block_1` on it.
    *   `black_block_1` is on the table.

2.  **`unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2`:**
    *   `brown_block_1` is now held.

3.  **`putdown brown_block_1`:**
    *   `brown_block_1` is on the table.

4.  **`unstack orange_block_2 red_block_1`:**
    *   `orange_block_2` is now held.

5.  **`putdown orange_block_2`:**
    *   `orange_block_2` is on the table.

6.  **`unstack red_block_1 blue_block_1`:**
    *   `red_block_1` is now held.

7.  **`putdown red_block_1`:**
    *   `red_block_1` is on the table.

8.  **`pickup blue_block_1`:**
    *   `blue_block_1` is now held.

9.  **`stack blue_block_1 orange_block_1`:**
    *   `blue_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1` is now true.
    *   Constraint 1 is satisfied.
    *   `orange_block_1` is no longer clear.

10. **`pickup black_block_1`:**
    *   `black_block_1` is now held.

11. **`stack black_block_1 orange_block_2`:**
    *   `black_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2` is now true.
    *   Constraint 2 is satisfied because it requires `black_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2` to be true at the same state or a later state after `blue_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1` is true.

12. **`unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1`:**
    *   `orange_block_1 is clear` is now true.
    *   Constraint 3 is satisfied.
    *   Constraint 4 is satisfied because `black_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2` was true in an earlier state.
    *   `orange_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1` is now true.
    *   Constraint 5 is satisfied.
    *   Constraint 6 is satisfied because `you are holding black_block_1` was true in an earlier state.

13. **`pickup green_block_1`:**
    *   The goal `you are holding green_block_1` is achieved.

This plan is optimal because it directly addresses the constraints while minimizing the number of moves needed to free and pick up green_block_1.
