Let's analyze the planning problem.

Given Objects:
- orange_block_1
- green_block_1
- blue_block_1
- red_block_1
- black_block_1
- orange_block_2
- brown_block_1

Initial State:
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- black_block_1 is on the table
- orange_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2
- green_block_1 is clear
- black_block_1 is clear
- brown_block_1 is clear
- The robotic arm is not holding any block

To visualize the initial state:
```
      green_block_1   black_block_1    brown_block_1
           |                           |
     orange_block_1                orange_block_2
                                       |
                                  red_block_1
                                       |
                                  blue_block_1
     -------------TABLE------------------
```

Goal:
- The robotic arm is holding green_block_1

Constraints:
1. At some point, blue_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1 (This is already true in the initial state)
2. If 1 holds, then black_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2 at or after that state
   - Since 1 is true from the beginning, we need to put black_block_1 on top of orange_block_2 at some point before achieving the goal
3. At some point, orange_block_1 is clear (This is not true in the initial state, since green_block_1 is on top of it)
4. If 3 holds, then at an earlier state, black_block_1 must be on top of orange_block_1 or the arm must be holding black_block_1
   - This means before orange_block_1 becomes clear, we need to have black_block_1 on top of orange_block_1 or hold black_block_1
5. At some point, orange_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1 (This is already true in the initial state)
6. If 5, then at or after that state, the arm must be holding black_block_1 or brown_block_1 must be on the table
   - Since 5 is true from the beginning, we need to either hold black_block_1 or put brown_block_1 on the table at some point

Let's plan:

Constraints 1 and 5 are satisfied in the initial state. For constraint 2, we need to place black_block_1 on top of orange_block_2 at some point. For constraint 3, we need to make orange_block_1 clear, which means removing green_block_1 from orange_block_1. But before doing that, according to constraint 4, we need to either hold black_block_1 or place black_block_1 on top of orange_block_1.

For constraint 6, we need to either hold black_block_1 or put brown_block_1 on the table.

Let's try to come up with a plan:

1. First, let's satisfy constraint 4 by holding black_block_1, which will also help with constraint 6.
   - pickup black_block_1 (Now we're holding black_block_1)

2. Now we can make orange_block_1 clear by unstacking green_block_1 from orange_block_1. But we can't do this yet, because we're already holding black_block_1.

   We need to put black_block_1 somewhere. According to constraint 2, we should place black_block_1 on top of orange_block_2, but we can't do that directly because brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2. So we'll need to first remove brown_block_1.

   - putdown black_block_1
   - unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
   - putdown brown_block_1 (This satisfies constraint 6 as brown_block_1 is now on the table)
   - pickup black_block_1
   - stack black_block_1 orange_block_2 (This satisfies constraint 2)

3. Now we can make orange_block_1 clear (constraint 3) and then pick up green_block_1 (our goal).
   - putdown black_block_1 (we need to free our arm)
   - unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1 (This satisfies constraint 3)

But wait, we've now reached our goal by holding green_block_1. However, there's a problem with our plan. According to constraint 4, before making orange_block_1 clear, we should have black_block_1 on top of orange_block_1 or be holding black_block_1. In our plan, when we unstacked green_block_1 from orange_block_1, we were not holding black_block_1 and black_block_1 was not on top of orange_block_1.

Let's revise our plan:

1. First, let's satisfy constraint 4 by placing black_block_1 on top of orange_block_1, before orange_block_1 becomes clear.
   - pickup black_block_1
   - stack black_block_1 green_block_1
   - unstack black_block_1 green_block_1
   - stack black_block_1 orange_block_1 (Now black_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1, satisfying constraint 4)
   - unstack black_block_1 orange_block_1 (Now orange_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint 3)

2. But wait, I can't stack black_block_1 on orange_block_1 directly because green_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1.

Let me try another approach.

Actually, let me just try checking if we can execute our goal directly:

1. We need to unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_1 to hold it.
   - unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1

But wait, that would make orange_block_1 clear, which triggers constraint 4. According to constraint 4, before orange_block_1 becomes clear, we should have black_block_1 on top of orange_block_1 or be holding black_block_1.

Let's revise our plan again:

1. First, let's satisfy constraint 4 by holding black_block_1.
   - pickup black_block_1 (Now we're holding black_block_1, satisfying part of constraint 4)

2. Put black_block_1 somewhere to free our arm.
   - putdown black_block_1 (black_block_1 is on the table)

3. Now we can make orange_block_1 clear by unstacking green_block_1 from orange_block_1.
   - unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1 (This makes orange_block_1 clear, satisfying constraint 3)

But now we've reached our goal by holding green_block_1.

But this still doesn't satisfy constraint 2 (black_block_1 should be on top of orange_block_2) and constraint 6 (we should be holding black_block_1 or brown_block_1 should be on the table).

Actually, let's think about this differently. Our constraints are:

1. At some point, blue_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1 (This is already true in the initial state)
2. If 1 holds, then black_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2 at or after that state.
   - Since 1 is true from the beginning, we need to put black_block_1 on top of orange_block_2 at some point.
3. At some point, orange_block_1 is clear (We need to make this happen by removing green_block_1 from it).
4. If 3 holds, then at an earlier state, black_block_1 must be on top of orange_block_1 or the arm must be holding black_block_1.
   - This is tricky because green_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 initially, so we'd need to remove green_block_1, place black_block_1 on orange_block_1 (or hold black_block_1), and then make orange_block_1 clear.
5. At some point, orange_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1 (This is already true in the initial state).
6. If 5, then at or after that state, the arm must be holding black_block_1 or brown_block_1 must be on the table.
   - Since 5 is true from the beginning, we need to either hold black_block_1 or put brown_block_1 on the table.

Let me try to come up with a different plan:

1. First, let's satisfy constraint 6 by holding black_block_1.
   - pickup black_block_1 (Now we're holding black_block_1)

2. We can't proceed with stacking black_block_1 on orange_block_2 directly (to satisfy constraint 2) because brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2. So, let's clear orange_block_2 first.
   - putdown black_block_1 (we need to free our arm)
   - unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2 (Now orange_block_2 is clear)
   - putdown brown_block_1 (brown_block_1 is on the table, which also satisfies constraint 6)
   - pickup black_block_1
   - stack black_block_1 orange_block_2 (This satisfies constraint 2)

3. Now, to satisfy constraint 4, we need to unstacked black_block_1 and place it on orange_block_1, but before that, we need to make orange_block_1 clear by removing green_block_1. But if we remove green_block_1, orange_block_1 becomes clear, which triggers constraint 4!

Actually, that's not accurate. Constraint 4 says: "If orange_block_1 is clear, then at an earlier state, black_block_1 must be on top of orange_block_1 or the arm must be holding black_block_1." But the constraint doesn't say that black_block_1 must be in one of these positions at the *same* time as orange_block_1 becomes clear.

So, we can hold black_block_1 at some point, then make orange_block_1 clear at a later point. The constraint would still be satisfied because there was an earlier state where the arm was holding black_block_1.

So here's the revised plan:

1. First, to handle constraint 6, we'll pick up black_block_1.
   - pickup black_block_1 (Now we're holding black_block_1, which satisfies constraint 6)

2. To handle constraint 2, we need to put black_block_1 on top of orange_block_2, but orange_block_2 is not clear. So we need to clear it first.
   - putdown black_block_1 (we need to free our arm)
   - unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2 (Now orange_block_2 is clear)
   - putdown brown_block_1 (brown_block_1 is on the table, which also satisfies constraint 6)
   - pickup black_block_1
   - stack black_block_1 orange_block_2 (This satisfies constraint 2)

3. Now, to handle constraints 3 and 4, we need to make orange_block_1 clear, but before that, we need to hold black_block_1.
   - unstack black_block_1 orange_block_2 (Now we're holding black_block_1, which will work for constraint 4)
   - putdown black_block_1 (Now we're free to pick up green_block_1)
   - unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1 (Now orange_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint 3. And there was an earlier state where we were holding black_block_1, which satisfies constraint 4.)

And now, we are holding green_block_1, which achieves our goal!

Actually, let me look if this works for the constraints one more time:

1. At some point, blue_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1. This is true from the start.
2. If 1 holds, black_block_1 must be on top of orange_block_2 at or after that state. We fulfilled this by stacking black_block_1 on orange_block_2.
3. At some point, orange_block_1 is clear. We achieved this by unstacking green_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. If 3 holds, then at an earlier state, black_block_1 must be on top of orange_block_1 or the arm must be holding black_block_1. We satisfied this by holding black_block_1 before making orange_block_1 clear.
5. At some point, orange_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1. This is true from the start.
6. If 5 holds, then at or after that state, the arm must be holding black_block_1 or brown_block_1 must be on the table. We satisfied this by first holding black_block_1 and then putting brown_block_1 on the table.

So here's our final plan:

1. pickup black_block_1 (satisfy constraint 6)
2. putdown black_block_1
3. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
4. putdown brown_block_1 (additional satisfaction of constraint 6)
5. pickup black_block_1
6. stack black_block_1 orange_block_2 (satisfy constraint 2)
7. unstack black_block_1 orange_block_2 (now holding black_block_1 for constraint 4)
8. putdown black_block_1
9. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1 (satisfy constraint 3, with constraint 4 satisfied based on previous holding of black_block_1)

Actually, steps 7 and 8 (unstacking and putting down black_block_1) are unnecessary, since we can directly unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_1. So let's simplify:

1. pickup black_block_1
2. putdown black_block_1
3. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
4. putdown brown_block_1
5. pickup black_block_1
6. stack black_block_1 orange_block_2
7. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1

No wait, that's incorrect. When we remove black_block_1 from the stack, we need to be holding it, which means we need to unstack it from orange_block_2 before we can unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_1.

Let's revise again:

Actually, there's a problem with this plan. To unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_1, I need to be not holding any block. The problem is, in step 6, I stack black_block_1 on orange_block_2, this action leaves no blocks in my hand, but I need to ensure that constraint 4 is met.

Constraint 4 says: "If orange_block_1 is clear, then at an earlier state, black_block_1 must be on top of orange_block_1 or the arm must be holding black_block_1."

When I unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_1, I make orange_block_1 clear. But according to constraint 4, before making orange_block_1 clear, I must have held black_block_1 or placed black_block_1 on top of orange_block_1.

Let me revise the plan:

1. pickup black_block_1 (I'm holding black_block_1, which will be used for constraint 4)
2. putdown black_block_1 (I free my hand)
3. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2 (clear orange_block_2)
4. putdown brown_block_1 (brown_block_1 is on the table, which satisfies constraint 6)
5. pickup black_block_1
6. stack black_block_1 orange_block_2 (This satisfies constraint 2)
7. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1 (This makes orange_block_1 clear, satisfying constraint 3. And we previously held black_block_1, which satisfies constraint 4)

So our final plan that is optimized looks like:
1. pickup black_block_1 (satisfy constraint 4)
2. putdown black_block_1 (free our arm)
3. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2 (clear orange_block_2)
4. putdown brown_block_1 (satisfy constraint 6)
5. pickup black_block_1
6. stack black_block_1 orange_block_2 (satisfy constraint 2)
7. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1 (satisfy constraint 3)

This plan should satisfy all the constraints and achieve the goal.

Actually, let's double check that condition 4 is met. Condition 4 says:
"If expression 
		"there is no block on top of orange_block_1, i.e., orange_block_1 is clear"
		holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 
		"At least one of the following conditions is true: "black_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1", "you are holding black_block_1"""

In our plan, orange_block_1 becomes clear after we unstack green_block_1 in step 7. Now, at an earlier state (step 1), we had the arm holding black_block_1. So this checks out.

Let me check the constraints one more time:

1. At some point, blue_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1: This is true from the beginning.
2. If 1 holds, then black_block_1 must be on top of orange_block_2 at or after that state: This is satisfied in step 6 when we stack black_block_1 on orange_block_2.
3. At some point, orange_block_1 is clear: This is satisfied in step 7 when we unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. If 3 holds, then at an earlier state, black_block_1 must be on top of orange_block_1 or the arm must be holding black_block_1: This is satisfied by step 1 where we hold black_block_1.
5. At some point, orange_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1: This is true from the beginning.
6. If 5 holds, then at or after that state, the arm must be holding black_block_1 or brown_block_1 must be on the table: This is satisfied by step 1 where we hold black_block_1 and later reinforced in step 4 where we put brown_block_1 on the table.

Our plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal. This plan seems to be optimal in terms of the number of steps.

1. pickup black_block_1
2. putdown black_block_1
3. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
4. putdown brown_block_1
5. pickup black_block_1
6. stack black_block_1 orange_block_2
7. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1

But wait, I notice now in step 7, we complete our goal by holding green_block_1, but that means during step 7, the arm will not be holding any block initially, since step 6 left the arm empty. This isn't a problem with the plan, but I'm just double checking our sequence of steps is correct.

The preconditions for "unstack" are: (i) the first block is on top of the second block, (ii) the first block is clear, and (iii) the arm is not currently holding any block.

In our case, for step 7 (unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1), the preconditions are:
1. green_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 (true from the initial state)
2. green_block_1 is clear (true from the initial state)
3. The arm is not holding any block (true after step 6)

So, the unstack operation in step 7 is valid and will result in the arm holding green_block_1, which achieves our goal.

Thus, our optimal final plan is:

1. pickup black_block_1
2. putdown black_block_1
3. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
4. putdown brown_block_1
5. pickup black_block_1
6. stack black_block_1 orange_block_2
7. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1

Actually, wait. Looking at this again, I see that it can be optimized further. Steps 1 and 2 (pickup and putdown black_block_1) don't actually change the state of the world. They're just there to satisfy constraint 4, by ensuring that the arm held black_block_1 before orange_block_1 became clear. But we could just inline this and pickup black_block_1 before stacking it on orange_block_2, which would also satisfy constraint 4.

So, the more optimal plan would be:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. pickup black_block_1
4. stack black_block_1 orange_block_2
5. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1

Let's verify once again that this optimized plan meets all the constraints:

1. At some point, blue_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1: This is true from the beginning.
2. If 1 holds, then black_block_1 must be on top of orange_block_2 at or after that state: This is satisfied in step 4 when we stack black_block_1 on orange_block_2.
3. At some point, orange_block_1 is clear: This is satisfied in step 5 when we unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_1.
4. If 3 holds, then at an earlier state, black_block_1 must be on top of orange_block_1 or the arm must be holding black_block_1: This is satisfied by step 3 where we hold black_block_1.
5. At some point, orange_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1: This is true from the beginning.
6. If 5 holds, then at or after that state, the arm must be holding black_block_1 or brown_block_1 must be on the table: This is satisfied by step 3 where we hold black_block_1 and step 2 where we put brown_block_1 on the table.

This optimized plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal in fewer steps, making it more optimal.

Actually, I realize we can even tighten this up further. I'm not sure why I stacked black_block_1 on orange_block_2 for constraint 2. Let's check again what our constraints says: "If blue_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1, then black_block_1 must be on top of orange_block_2 at or after that state."

The challenge here is that "blue_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1" is true from the beginning, so we need to make "black_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2" true at some point.

But wait, we can't skip step 4 (stacking black_block_1 on orange_block_2), as this is needed for constraint 2. And we can't stack black_block_1 on orange_block_1 for constraint 4 because orange_block_1 is already occupied by green_block_1.

Taking a step back, the constraints are telling us that at any point of time in our plan (since constraint 1 holds from the beginning), we have to have "black_block_1 on top of orange_block_2" at some point, and "black_block_1 is being held or on top of orange_block_1" at some point (before orange_block_1 becomes clear).

In the previous plan, constrains 3 and 4 was handled by holding black_block_1 before clearing orange_block_1. 

5 constrains are telling us that at some point, we need to either hold black_block_1 or put brown_block_1 on the table (orange_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1 is also true from the beginning).

Given the initial state and the constraints, it seems like our optimized plan is already the most optimal:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2 (clear orange_block_2 to prepare for constraint 2)
2. putdown brown_block_1 (satisfy constraint 6 by putting brown_block_1 on the table)
3. pickup black_block_1 (satisfy constraint 4 and 6 by holding black_block_1)
4. stack black_block_1 orange_block_2 (satisfy constraint 2)
5. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1 (achieve the goal, also satisfying constraint 3)

Okay, this is our final plan.

Actually, let me double check one more time.

Constraints:
1. At some point, blue_block_1 is not on top of orange_block_1: This is ALREADY TRUE from the initial state, so we need to invoke Constraint 2.
2. If Constraint 1 holds, then black_block_1 must be on top of orange_block_2 at or after that state: We put black_block_1 on top of orange_block_2 to satisfy this.
3. At some point, orange_block_1, is clear: This becomes true when we unstack green_block_1 in the last step, which invokes Constraint 4.
4. If Constraint 3 holds, then at an EARLIER STATE, black_block_1 must be on top of orange_block_1 or you are holding black_block_1: We held black_block_1 before making orange_block_1 clear.
5. At some point, orange_block_2 is not on top of green_block_1: This is ALREADY TRUE from the initial state, so we need to invoke Constraint 6.
6. If Constraint 5 holds, then at or after that state, we're holding black_block_1 or brown_block_1 is on the table: We did both — held black_block_1 and also put brown_block_1 on the table.

So, yes, our plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal.

To restate the final plan:
1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_2
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. pickup black_block_1
4. stack black_block_1 orange_block_2
5. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_1

This is our optimal final plan.
