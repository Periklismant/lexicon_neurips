Okay, let's break this down. The goal is to have black_block_2 on top of green_block_1. We need to consider the constraints as well.

1.  **Constraint 1:** green_block_1 must be on the table at some point.
2.  **Constraint 2:** Before green_block_1 is on the table, black_block_1 must be on top of green_block_1.
3.  **Constraint 3:** At some point, either we are holding black_block_1 or black_block_2 is on top of white_block_2.
4.  **Constraint 4:** At some point, we must be holding black_block_1 and purple_block_1 must be on top of green_block_1.

Here's a plan that addresses these constraints:

```
```
unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
putdown white_block_2
unstack white_block_1 purple_block_1
putdown white_block_1
unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2
putdown purple_block_1
unstack green_block_2 green_block_1
putdown green_block_2
unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
putdown green_block_1
pickup black_block_1
stack black_block_1 green_block_1
unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
pickup black_block_1
stack purple_block_1 green_block_1
pickup black_block_1
stack black_block_2 green_block_1
```
