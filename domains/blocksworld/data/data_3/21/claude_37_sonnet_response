Let's analyze the problem:

### Initial State:
- black_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
- green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2
- green_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
- purple_block_1 is on top of green_block_2
- white_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1
- white_block_2 is on top of white_block_1
- white_block_2 is clear
- you are not holding any block

So we have this tower: black_block_1 (bottom) - black_block_2 - green_block_1 - green_block_2 - purple_block_1 - white_block_1 - white_block_2 (top)

### Goal State:
- black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1

### Constraints:
1. At some point, green_block_1 must be on the table.
2. If green_block_1 is on the table, then there must be an earlier state where black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1.
3. At some point, either you are holding black_block_1 or black_block_2 is on top of white_block_2.
4. At some point, you are holding black_block_1 and purple_block_1 is on top of green_block_1.

Let's plan a sequence of actions to achieve the goal while satisfying the constraints:

To make green_block_1 be on the table (constraint 1), we need to unstack it. But before we can do this, we need to clear the blocks on top of it. Additionally, constraint 2 says that before green_block_1 is on the table, we need a state where black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1.

Constraint 4 says we need a state where we're holding black_block_1 and purple_block_1 is on top of green_block_1. This means we need to re-arrange the blocks to get purple_block_1 on top of green_block_1.

However, we need to be careful that we are also reaching the goal state where black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1.

Let's start by disassembling the tower from the top:

1. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1 (now holding white_block_2)
2. putdown white_block_2 (white_block_2 is on the table)
3. unstack white_block_1 purple_block_1 (now holding white_block_1)
4. putdown white_block_1 (white_block_1 is on the table)
5. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2 (now holding purple_block_1)

Now I need to place purple_block_1 on top of green_block_1 for constraint 4. But green_block_1 is below green_block_2, so I need to continue disassembling.

6. putdown purple_block_1 (purple_block_1 is on the table)
7. unstack green_block_2 green_block_1 (now holding green_block_2)
8. putdown green_block_2 (green_block_2 is on the table)

Now, I need to put purple_block_1 on top of green_block_1 for constraint 4.

9. pickup purple_block_1 (now holding purple_block_1)
10. stack purple_block_1 green_block_1 (purple_block_1 is on top of green_block_1)

For constraint 4, I also need to be holding black_block_1. But black_block_1 is at the bottom of the stack (with black_block_2 on top of it). I need to continue disassembling.

11. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2 (now holding green_block_1)

To satisfy constraint 2, before green_block_1 is on the table, I need a state where black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1. So I should arrange that before putting green_block_1 on the table.

12. putdown green_block_1 (green_block_1 is on the table)

Now, I need to arrange black_block_1 on top of green_block_1 (for constraint 2).

13. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1 (now holding black_block_2)
14. putdown black_block_2 (black_block_2 is on the table)
15. pickup black_block_1 (now holding black_block_1)

At this point, I am holding black_block_1 and purple_block_1 is on top of green_block_1, which satisfies constraint 4.

16. stack black_block_1 purple_block_1 (black_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1)

But, I need to get black_block_1 on top of green_block_1 (for constraint 2).

Let me re-evaluate.

Actually, let's think of how to arrange things to satisfy both constraints 2 and 4 efficiently.

Wait, I think I had it out of order. Let's think again. Constraint 2 says that if green_block_1 is on the table, then there must be an earlier state where black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1. 

Let me think through the solution more carefully:

Initial tower: black_block_1 (bottom) - black_block_2 - green_block_1 - green_block_2 - purple_block_1 - white_block_1 - white_block_2 (top)

1. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1 (now holding white_block_2)
2. putdown white_block_2 (white_block_2 is on the table)
3. unstack white_block_1 purple_block_1 (now holding white_block_1)
4. putdown white_block_1 (white_block_1 is on the table)
5. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2 (now holding purple_block_1)
6. putdown purple_block_1 (purple_block_1 is on the table)
7. unstack green_block_2 green_block_1 (now holding green_block_2)
8. putdown green_block_2 (green_block_2 is on the table)
9. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2 (now holding green_block_1)
10. putdown green_block_1 (green_block_1 is on the table)

Now, the tower is: black_block_1 (bottom) - black_block_2 (top). And green_block_1, green_block_2, purple_block_1, white_block_1, and white_block_2 are all on the table.

11. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1 (now holding black_block_2)
12. putdown black_block_2 (black_block_2 is on the table)
13. pickup black_block_1 (now holding black_block_1)

Before we place green_block_1, we need to create a state where black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1. But green_block_1 is already on the table. This seems to contradict constraint 2, which says if green_block_1 is on the table, then there must be an earlier state where black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1.

Hmm, I think I'm getting confused with the constraint. Let's re-read it:

"If expression 'green_block_1 is on the table' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1'"

So, if at any point green_block_1 is on the table, then before that, there should be a state where black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1.

But green_block_1 is already on the table in my sequence of actions, and there was no earlier state where black_block_1 was on top of green_block_1. So, I need to revise my plan.

Let's start over, being more careful with the constraints:

Initial tower: black_block_1 (bottom) - black_block_2 - green_block_1 - green_block_2 - purple_block_1 - white_block_1 - white_block_2 (top)

1. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1 (now holding white_block_2)
2. putdown white_block_2 (white_block_2 is on the table)
3. unstack white_block_1 purple_block_1 (now holding white_block_1)
4. putdown white_block_1 (white_block_1 is on the table)
5. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2 (now holding purple_block_1)
6. putdown purple_block_1 (purple_block_1 is on the table)
7. unstack green_block_2 green_block_1 (now holding green_block_2)
8. putdown green_block_2 (green_block_2 is on the table)
9. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2 (now holding green_block_1)

Before I put green_block_1 on the table, I need to create a state where black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1. So, I should stack green_block_1 somewhere temporarily, get black_block_1, stack it on green_block_1, then later move green_block_1 to the table.

10. stack green_block_1 white_block_2 (green_block_1 is on top of white_block_2)
11. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1 (now holding black_block_2)
12. putdown black_block_2 (black_block_2 is on the table)
13. pickup black_block_1 (now holding black_block_1)
14. stack black_block_1 green_block_1 (black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1)

So now, we have black_block_1 on top of green_block_1. This satisfies the condition for constraint 2, that there must be an earlier state where black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 before green_block_1 is on the table.

15. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1 (now holding black_block_1)

Now, I'm holding black_block_1. Let's take this opportunity to try to satisfy constraint 4, which requires "you are holding black_block_1" and "purple_block_1 is on top of green_block_1".

We need to put purple_block_1 on top of green_block_1.

16. putdown black_block_1 (black_block_1 is on the table)
17. pickup purple_block_1 (now holding purple_block_1)
18. stack purple_block_1 green_block_1 (purple_block_1 is on top of green_block_1)
19. pickup black_block_1 (now holding black_block_1)

Now, we're holding black_block_1 and purple_block_1 is on top of green_block_1. This satisfies constraint 4.

20. putdown black_block_1 (black_block_1 is on the table)
21. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_1 (now holding purple_block_1)
22. putdown purple_block_1 (purple_block_1 is on the table)
23. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2 (now holding green_block_1)
24. putdown green_block_1 (green_block_1 is on the table)

Now, green_block_1 is on the table, which satisfies constraint 1. And there was a previous state where black_block_1 was on top of green_block_1, satisfying constraint 2.

Let's satisfy constraint 3, which requires either "you are holding black_block_1" or "black_block_2 is on top of white_block_2". We can achieve the second:

25. pickup black_block_2 (now holding black_block_2)
26. stack black_block_2 white_block_2 (black_block_2 is on top of white_block_2)

This satisfies constraint 3.

Now, to reach the goal state where black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1:

27. unstack black_block_2 white_block_2 (now holding black_block_2)
28. stack black_block_2 green_block_1 (black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1)

We've reached the goal state: black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1.

Let's check the constraints again:

1. At some point, green_block_1 is on the table. Satisfied by step 24.
2. If green_block_1 is on the table, then there must be an earlier state where black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1. Satisfied by steps 14 and 24.
3. At some point, either you are holding black_block_1 or black_block_2 is on top of white_block_2. Satisfied by step 26.
4. At some point, you are holding black_block_1 and purple_block_1 is on top of green_block_1. Satisfied by steps 18 and 19.

Goal state: black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1. Satisfied by step 28.

Here's the final plan:

1. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
2. putdown white_block_2
3. unstack white_block_1 purple_block_1
4. putdown white_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack green_block_2 green_block_1
8. putdown green_block_2
9. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
10. stack green_block_1 white_block_2
11. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
12. putdown black_block_2
13. pickup black_block_1
14. stack black_block_1 green_block_1
15. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1
16. putdown black_block_1
17. pickup purple_block_1
18. stack purple_block_1 green_block_1
19. pickup black_block_1
20. putdown black_block_1
21. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_1
22. putdown purple_block_1
23. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
24. putdown green_block_1
25. pickup black_block_2
26. stack black_block_2 white_block_2
27. unstack black_block_2 white_block_2
28. stack black_block_2 green_block_1

This plan achieves the goal state while satisfying all the constraints. But let me think if there is a more optimal solution (i.e., a solution with fewer steps).

Actually, I realized I'm making things more complicated than they need to be. Let's restate the constraints:

1. At some point, green_block_1 must be on the table.
2. If green_block_1 is on the table, then there must be an earlier state where black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1.
3. At some point, either you are holding black_block_1 or black_block_2 is on top of white_block_2.
4. At some point, you are holding black_block_1 and purple_block_1 is on top of green_block_1.

Let's approach this differently. I'll start with the initial state and then focus on the most constrainted aspects first.

Initial tower: black_block_1 (bottom) - black_block_2 - green_block_1 - green_block_2 - purple_block_1 - white_block_1 - white_block_2 (top)

Let's break down our steps:

1. First, we need to create a state where black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1, and then later green_block_1 is on the table (constraints 1 and 2).
2. At some point, we need a state where you are holding black_block_1 and purple_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 (constraint 4).
3. At some point, either you are holding black_block_1 or black_block_2 is on top of white_block_2 (constraint 3).
4. Finally, we need to achieve the goal state where black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1.

Since we need to place green_block_1 on the table and black_block_1 on top of green_block_1 (before green_block_1 is on the table), we need to dismantle the initial tower first.

Let's start by disassembling the tower from the top:

1. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1 (now holding white_block_2)
2. putdown white_block_2 (white_block_2 is on the table)
3. unstack white_block_1 purple_block_1 (now holding white_block_1)
4. putdown white_block_1 (white_block_1 is on the table)
5. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2 (now holding purple_block_1)
6. putdown purple_block_1 (purple_block_1 is on the table)
7. unstack green_block_2 green_block_1 (now holding green_block_2)
8. putdown green_block_2 (green_block_2 is on the table)
9. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2 (now holding green_block_1)

Now, the tower is: black_block_1 (bottom) - black_block_2 (top). And green_block_1, green_block_2, purple_block_1, white_block_1, and white_block_2 are all on the table.

To satisfy constraint 4, we should create a state where purple_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 and we are holding black_block_1. This will require us to first get black_block_1, which means we need to remove black_block_2 from on top of it.

10. stack green_block_1 white_block_2 (green_block_1 is on top of white_block_2)
11. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1 (now holding black_block_2)
12. putdown black_block_2 (black_block_2 is on the table)

We need to get purple_block_1 on top of green_block_1.

13. pickup purple_block_1 (now holding purple_block_1)
14. stack purple_block_1 green_block_1 (purple_block_1 is on top of green_block_1)
15. pickup black_block_1 (now holding black_block_1)

Now, we're holding black_block_1 and purple_block_1 is on top of green_block_1. This satisfies constraint 4.

Next, we need to satisify constraint 2, which requires black_block_1 to be on top of green_block_1 before green_block_1 is on the table. Since we're already holding black_block_1, we need to first remove purple_block_1 from green_block_1.

16. putdown black_block_1 (black_block_1 is on the table)
17. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_1 (now holding purple_block_1)
18. putdown purple_block_1 (purple_block_1 is on the table)
19. pickup black_block_1 (now holding black_block_1)
20. stack black_block_1 green_block_1 (black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1)

Now, we have created a state where black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1.

Let's now put green_block_1 on the table, but first, we need to remove black_block_1 from it.

21. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1 (now holding black_block_1)
22. putdown black_block_1 (black_block_1 is on the table)
23. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2 (now holding green_block_1)
24. putdown green_block_1 (green_block_1 is on the table)

Now, green_block_1 is on the table. This satisfies constraint 1. And there was a previous state where black_block_1 was on top of green_block_1, satisfying constraint 2.

Next, let's try to satisfy constraint 3, which requires either "you are holding black_block_1" or "black_block_2 is on top of white_block_2".

25. pickup black_block_2 (now holding black_block_2)
26. stack black_block_2 white_block_2 (black_block_2 is on top of white_block_2)

This satisfies constraint 3.

Finally, let's reach the goal state, which requires black_block_2 to be on top of green_block_1.

27. unstack black_block_2 white_block_2 (now holding black_block_2)
28. stack black_block_2 green_block_1 (black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1)

We've achieved the goal. Let's check all constraints:

1. green_block_1 is on the table at some point. Satisfied by step 24.
2. Black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 before green_block_1 is on the table. Satisfied by steps 20 and 24.
3. At some point, either we are holding black_block_1 or black_block_2 is on top of white_block_2. Satisfied by step 26.
4. At some point, we are holding black_block_1 and purple_block_1 is on top of green_block_1. Satisfied by steps 14 and 15.

Goal: black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1. Satisfied by step 28.

This is the same as my previous solution, and I believe it's a valid and optimized solution.

Let me see if there's a shorter solution for this problem.

Actually, I can notice one inefficiency: We're removing purple_block_1 from green_block_1 and stacking black_block_1 on it, only to unstack black_block_1 again. 

Actually, we still need that to satisfy the constraint that black_block_1 is at some point on top of green_block_1 before green_block_1 is on the table.

Let me see if I can remove inefficiencies in the steps: 

Initial tower: black_block_1 (bottom) - black_block_2 - green_block_1 - green_block_2 - purple_block_1 - white_block_1 - white_block_2 (top)

1. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
2. putdown white_block_2
3. unstack white_block_1 purple_block_1
4. putdown white_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack green_block_2 green_block_1
8. putdown green_block_2
9. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
10. putdown green_block_1

At this point, we have:
- black_block_1 (bottom) - black_block_2 (top) as a tower.
- green_block_1, green_block_2, purple_block_1, white_block_1, and white_block_2 are all on the table.

11. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
12. putdown black_block_2

I can see one inefficiency: we're putting green_block_1 on the table at step 10, but the constraint says that before green_block_1 is on the table, we need black_block_1 on top of green_block_1. So we need to modify step 10. Instead of putting green_block_1 on the table, we can temporarily stack it elsewhere.

Let's restart from step 9:

9. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2 (now holding green_block_1)
10. stack green_block_1 white_block_2 (green_block_1 is on top of white_block_2)
11. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1 (now holding black_block_2)
12. putdown black_block_2 (black_block_2 is on the table)
13. pickup black_block_1 (now holding black_block_1)

This is to satisfy the constraint 4, which requires us to be holding black_block_1 while purple_block_1 is on top of green_block_1. So first, we need to stack purple_block_1 on green_block_1.

14. putdown black_block_1 (black_block_1 is on the table)
15. pickup purple_block_1 (now holding purple_block_1)
16. stack purple_block_1 green_block_1 (purple_block_1 is on top of green_block_1)
17. pickup black_block_1 (now holding black_block_1)

Now we're holding black_block_1 and purple_block_1 is on top of green_block_1, which satisfies constraint 4.

Next, for constraint 2, we need to have black_block_1 on top of green_block_1 before green_block_1 is on the table. But first, we need to remove purple_block_1 from green_block_1.

18. putdown black_block_1 (black_block_1 is on the table)
19. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_1 (now holding purple_block_1)
20. putdown purple_block_1 (purple_block_1 is on the table)
21. pickup black_block_1 (now holding black_block_1)
22. stack black_block_1 green_block_1 (black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1)

Now we have black_block_1 on top of green_block_1, which sets us up for constraint 2.

Now, for constraint 1, we need to have green_block_1 on the table. But first, we need to unstack black_block_1.

23. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1 (now holding black_block_1)
24. putdown black_block_1 (black_block_1 is on the table)
25. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2 (now holding green_block_1)
26. putdown green_block_1 (green_block_1 is on the table)

Now green_block_1 is on the table, and we had a previous state where black_block_1 was on top of green_block_1. This satisfies constraints 1 and 2.

For constraint 3, we need to either be holding black_block_1 or have black_block_2 on top of white_block_2.

27. pickup black_block_2 (now holding black_block_2)
28. stack black_block_2 white_block_2 (black_block_2 is on top of white_block_2)

This satisfies constraint 3.

Now, for the goal, we want black_block_2 to be on top of green_block_1. So we need to unstack black_block_2 from white_block_2 and stack it on green_block_1.

29. unstack black_block_2 white_block_2 (now holding black_block_2)
30. stack black_block_2 green_block_1 (black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1)

We've achieved the goal: black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1. Let's verify all constraints:

1. green_block_1 is on the table at some point. Satisfied by step 26.
2. Black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 before green_block_1 is on the table. Satisfied by steps 22 and 26.
3. At some point, either we are holding black_block_1 or black_block_2 is on top of white_block_2. Satisfied by step 28.
4. At some point, we are holding black_block_1 and purple_block_1 is on top of green_block_1. Satisfied by steps 16 and 17.

Goal: black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1. Satisfied by step 30.

This solution is valid, but it's not more efficient than the solution I proposed earlier. Both of them have the same number of steps, which is 28.

Let's try to find an even more optimized solution, by avoiding unnecessary steps.

Wait, I'm now getting a different number of steps. Let me double-check my solution:

1. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
2. putdown white_block_2
3. unstack white_block_1 purple_block_1
4. putdown white_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack green_block_2 green_block_1
8. putdown green_block_2
9. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
10. stack green_block_1 white_block_2
11. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
12. putdown black_block_2
13. pickup black_block_1
14. putdown black_block_1
15. pickup purple_block_1
16. stack purple_block_1 green_block_1
17. pickup black_block_1
18. putdown black_block_1
19. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_1
20. putdown purple_block_1
21. pickup black_block_1
22. stack black_block_1 green_block_1
23. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1
24. putdown black_block_1
25. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
26. putdown green_block_1
27. pickup black_block_2
28. stack black_block_2 white_block_2
29. unstack black_block_2 white_block_2
30. stack black_block_2 green_block_1

I count 30 steps.

Let me try to optimize this further.

Here's one inefficient step: we're putting black_block_1 down after picking it up (steps 13-14), and then picking it up again later (step 17). We could combine these.

Let's try to rethink the solution:

Initial tower: black_block_1 (bottom) - black_block_2 - green_block_1 - green_block_2 - purple_block_1 - white_block_1 - white_block_2 (top)

1. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
2. putdown white_block_2
3. unstack white_block_1 purple_block_1
4. putdown white_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack green_block_2 green_block_1
8. putdown green_block_2
9. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
10. stack green_block_1 white_block_2
11. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
12. putdown black_block_2
13. pickup black_block_1

Now I can optimize here. We're holding black_block_1 and we want to create a state where we're holding black_block_1 and purple_block_1 is on top of green_block_1. So we can ask someone else to put purple_block_1 on green_block_1 while we're still holding black_block_1. 

Actually, that doesn't work in this domain. We need to perform all actions ourselves. So we have to put black_block_1 down, pick up purple_block_1, etc.

But I can optimize a bit differently. Let's approach the problem in a slightly different way.

Initial tower: black_block_1 (bottom) - black_block_2 - green_block_1 - green_block_2 - purple_block_1 - white_block_1 - white_block_2 (top)

1. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
2. putdown white_block_2
3. unstack white_block_1 purple_block_1
4. putdown white_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack green_block_2 green_block_1
8. putdown green_block_2
9. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
10. stack green_block_1 white_block_2
11. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
12. stack black_block_2 white_block_2

Now, black_block_2 is on top of white_block_2, which satisfies constraint 3.

13. pickup black_block_1
14. putdown black_block_1
15. pickup purple_block_1
16. stack purple_block_1 green_block_1
17. pickup black_block_1

Now, we have black_block_1 in hand and purple_block_1 is on top of green_block_1, which satisfies constraint 4.

18. stack black_block_1 purple_block_1

We have stacked black_block_1 on top of purple_block_1. Now we need to get it on top of green_block_1 for constraint 2, so we need to unstack some blocks.

19. unstack black_block_1 purple_block_1
20. putdown black_block_1
21. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_1
22. putdown purple_block_1
23. pickup black_block_1
24. stack black_block_1 green_block_1

Now we have black_block_1 on top of green_block_1, which prepares for constraint 2. Next, we need to put green_block_1 on the table, but first we need to remove black_block_1.

25. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1
26. putdown black_block_1
27. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
28. putdown green_block_1

Now, green_block_1 is on the table, which satisfies constraint 1. And there was a previous state where black_block_1 was on top of green_block_1, satisfying constraint 2.

Now, for the goal, we want black_block_2 to be on top of green_block_1. So we need to unstack black_block_2 from white_block_2 and stack it on green_block_1.

29. unstack black_block_2 white_block_2
30. stack black_block_2 green_block_1

We've achieved the goal: black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1. Let's verify all constraints:

1. green_block_1 is on the table at some point. Satisfied by step 28.
2. Black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 before green_block_1 is on the table. Satisfied by steps 24 and 28.
3. At some point, either we are holding black_block_1 or black_block_2 is on top of white_block_2. Satisfied by step 12.
4. At some point, we are holding black_block_1 and purple_block_1 is on top of green_block_1. Satisfied by steps 16 and 17.

Goal: black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1. Satisfied by step 30.

So, my solution is still 30 steps, but I've optimized a few steps. 

Initial tower: black_block_1 (bottom) - black_block_2 - green_block_1 - green_block_2 - purple_block_1 - white_block_1 - white_block_2 (top)

Let's try to rethink the problem more fundamentally and see if I can produce a more efficient solution. I'll outline the key intermediate states we need to reach:

S1: black_block_2 is on top of white_block_2 (for constraint 3)
S2: black_block_1 is in hand and purple_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 (for constraint 4)
S3: black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 (for constraint 2, before S4)
S4: green_block_1 is on the table (for constraint 1)
S5: black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1 (the goal)

Let's try to reach these states as efficiently as possible. Initial state: black_block_1 (bottom) - black_block_2 - green_block_1 - green_block_2 - purple_block_1 - white_block_1 - white_block_2 (top)

First, let's disassemble the tower:

1. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
2. putdown white_block_2
3. unstack white_block_1 purple_block_1
4. putdown white_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack green_block_2 green_block_1
8. putdown green_block_2
9. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
10. putdown green_block_1

To satisfy S1 and S2, let's stack black_block_2 on white_block_2 and prepare for S2:

11. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
12. stack black_block_2 white_block_2 (S1 satisfied)
13. pickup black_block_1
14. putdown black_block_1

To satisfy S2, we need purple_block_1 on top of green_block_1 and black_block_1 in hand:

15. pickup purple_block_1
16. stack purple_block_1 green_block_1
17. pickup black_block_1 (S2 satisfied)

To satisfy S3, we need to stack black_block_1 on green_block_1:

18. putdown black_block_1
19. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_1
20. putdown purple_block_1
21. pickup black_block_1
22. stack black_block_1 green_block_1 (S3 satisfied)

I realize I can combine steps 17-18 by stacking black_block_1 on purple_block_1 directly. Let me retry from step 17:

17. stack black_block_1 purple_block_1
18. unstack black_block_1 purple_block_1
19. putdown black_block_1
20. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_1
21. putdown purple_block_1
22. pickup black_block_1
23. stack black_block_1 green_block_1 (S3 satisfied)

So I made the plan worse by combining steps. Let me go back to my original plan.

To satisfy S4, green_block_1 should be on the table (but it already is since step 10), so S4 is already satisfied. But this doesn't work with S3 (having black_block_1 on top of green_block_1 before green_block_1 is on the table). So, I need to rethink the plan. 

Let's redo the plan.

Initial tower: black_block_1 (bottom) - black_block_2 - green_block_1 - green_block_2 - purple_block_1 - white_block_1 - white_block_2 (top)

1. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
2. putdown white_block_2
3. unstack white_block_1 purple_block_1
4. putdown white_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack green_block_2 green_block_1
8. putdown green_block_2
9. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2

To ensure S3 comes before S4, I need to stack green_block_1 somewhere temporarily:

10. stack green_block_1 white_block_2
11. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
12. stack black_block_2 white_block_1 (to satisfy S1)

Now, to satisfy S2, we need to stack purple_block_1 on green_block_1 and have black_block_1 in hand:

13. pickup black_block_1
14. putdown black_block_1
15. pickup purple_block_1
16. stack purple_block_1 green_block_1
17. pickup black_block_1 (S2 satisfied)

Now, to satisfy S3, I need to stack black_block_1 on green_block_1, but first I need to remove purple_block_1:

18. putdown black_block_1
19. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_1
20. putdown purple_block_1
21. pickup black_block_1
22. stack black_block_1 green_block_1 (S3 satisfied)

Now, to satisfy S4, I need to put green_block_1 on the table, but first I need to remove black_block_1:

23. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1
24. putdown black_block_1
25. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
26. putdown green_block_1 (S4 satisfied)

Finally, for the goal (S5), I need to put black_block_2 on green_block_1:

27. unstack black_block_2 white_block_1
28. stack black_block_2 green_block_1 (S5 satisfied)

So I got 28 steps.

Let's verify the constraints:

1. green_block_1 is on the table at some point. Satisfied by step 26.
2. Black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1 before green_block_1 is on the table. Satisfied by steps 22 and 26.
3. At some point, either we are holding black_block_1 or black_block_2 is on top of white_block_2. Satisfied by S1, which corresponds to having black_block_2 on white_block_2. But wait, we actually stacked black_block_2 on white_block_1, not white_block_2. Let's adjust our plan.
4. At some point, we are holding black_block_1 and purple_block_1 is on top of green_block_1. Satisfied by steps 16 and 17.

Let me check what I did wrong. Constraint 3 says we need to have a state where either we're holding black_block_1 or black_block_2 is on top of white_block_2. We satisfy the first part multiple times, e.g., in step 17. So, constraint 3 is satisfied.

Let me review all constraints and the goal:

1. green_block_1 is on the table at some point. Satisfied by step 26.
2. If green_block_1 is on the table, then there must be an earlier state where black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1. Satisfied by steps 22 and 26.
3. At some point, either we are holding black_block_1 or black_block_2 is on top of white_block_2. Satisfied by step 17 (first part).
4. At some point, we are holding black_block_1 and purple_block_1 is on top of green_block_1. Satisfied by steps 16 and 17.

Goal: black_block_2 is on top of green_block_1. Satisfied by step 28.

So, our plan is valid, and I believe 28 steps is the optimal length for this problem.

Let me rewrite the steps to be sure:

1. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
2. putdown white_block_2
3. unstack white_block_1 purple_block_1
4. putdown white_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack green_block_2 green_block_1
8. putdown green_block_2
9. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
10. stack green_block_1 white_block_2
11. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
12. stack black_block_2 white_block_1
13. pickup black_block_1
14. putdown black_block_1
15. pickup purple_block_1
16. stack purple_block_1 green_block_1
17. pickup black_block_1
18. putdown black_block_1
19. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_1
20. putdown purple_block_1
21. pickup black_block_1
22. stack black_block_1 green_block_1
23. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1
24. putdown black_block_1
25. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
26. putdown green_block_1
27. unstack black_block_2 white_block_1
28. stack black_block_2 green_block_1

This is our final plan and I believe it's optimal.
