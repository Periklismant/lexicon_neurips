Okay, let's see. I need to figure out a plan to get black_block_2 on top of green_block_1, while satisfying all the constraints. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the goal.

The initial state is a tower starting with black_block_1 on the table, then black_block_2 on top of it, followed by green_block_1, green_block_2, purple_block_1, white_block_1, and finally white_block_2. All these are stacked, and white_block_2 is clear. The robot is holding nothing.

The goal is to have black_block_2 on green_block_1. But there are constraints to meet:

1. At some point, green_block_1 must be on the table.
2. If green_block_1 is on the table in a state, there must be a prior state where black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1.
3. At some state, either holding black_block_1 or black_block_2 is on white_block_2.
4. At some state, both holding black_block_1 and purple_block_1 is on green_block_1.

Hmm. So first, I need to make sure that green_block_1 ends up on the table at some point. But according to constraint 2, before that, black_block_1 must be on green_block_1. Wait, but black_block_1 is initially under black_block_2. So how can we get black_block_1 on green_block_1? That seems tricky because black_block_1 is on the table and has black_block_2 on top of it. To move black_block_1, we need to first clear it. But initially, black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1, so we can't move black_block_1 until black_block_2 is moved. But the tower above black_block_2 is all the way up to white_block_2. So to get to black_block_2, we need to unstack all the blocks above it.

So maybe the plan involves dismantling the entire tower to access black_block_2 and green_block_1. Let's think step by step.

The initial stack is:

Table -> black_block_1 -> black_block_2 -> green_block_1 -> green_block_2 -> purple_block_1 -> white_block_1 -> white_block_2.

To reach the goal, we need black_block_2 on green_block_1. So maybe we need to have green_block_1 somewhere, perhaps on the table, then place black_block_2 on it. But the constraints require that green_block_1 is on the table at some point, and that before that, black_block_1 was on top of green_block_1. Wait, that's a bit confusing. So the first constraint is that green_block_1 must be on the table in some state. The second constraint says that if green_block_1 is on the table in a state, then there must be a prior state where black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1. So to satisfy constraint 2, we have to have a state where black_block_1 is on green_block_1, then later green_block_1 is on the table. But how can black_block_1 be on green_block_1 when initially green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2? That seems impossible unless we move green_block_1 somewhere else first, then stack black_block_1 on it, and then move green_block_1 to the table. But that's a lot.

Alternatively, maybe we can stack black_block_1 onto green_block_1 after moving green_block_1 to the table, but that would violate constraint 2 because the green_block_1 is on the table, but prior to that, black_block_1 must be on green_block_1. So that sequence would not work. So the correct order must be: first stack black_block_1 on green_block_1 (which is not on the table yet), then move green_block_1 to the table. But how?

Wait, the initial position of green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2. To stack black_block_1 on green_block_1, green_block_1 must be clear. But currently, green_block_1 has green_block_2 on top of it. So we need to unstack all the blocks above green_block_1 first. Let's start breaking down the tower.

First, the top block is white_block_2. To unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1, we need to have the arm empty. Then unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1, then put it down. Then unstack white_block_1 from purple_block_1, put it down. Then unstack purple_block_1 from green_block_2, put it down. Then unstack green_block_2 from green_block_1, put it down. Now green_block_1 is clear. Then we can pick up black_block_2 (which is under green_block_1 initially?), wait no. Wait the initial stack is black_block_1 on table, then black_block_2 on top of that. Then green_block_1 on top of black_block_2. So the stack is: black_block_1 (table) -> black_block_2 -> green_block_1 -> green_block_2 -> purple_block_1 -> white_block_1 -> white_block_2.

So to get to black_block_2, we need to remove everything above it. That is, green_block_1, green_block_2, purple_block_1, white_block_1, white_block_2. So let's start unstacking from the top.

Action plan so far:

1. unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1. Then put it down.
2. unstack white_block_1 from purple_block_1. Put down.
3. unstack purple_block_1 from green_block_2. Put down.
4. unstack green_block_2 from green_block_1. Put down.
5. Now green_block_1 is clear. So we can unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2. Then put it down. Wait, but the goal is to have black_block_2 on green_block_1. So perhaps after unstacking green_block_1, we can move black_block_2 onto green_block_1. But initially, black_block_2 is under green_block_1. So after unstacking green_block_1 from black_block_2, black_block_2 becomes clear. Then maybe we can stack black_block_2 on green_block_1. But where is green_block_1? If we put green_block_1 on the table, then we can stack black_block_2 on it. But we need to satisfy the constraint that green_block_1 is on the table at some point. Also, before that, black_block_1 must be on top of green_block_1. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, maybe after unstacking green_block_1 from black_block_2, we can stack black_block_1 onto green_block_1 (which is still on black_block_2?), no, after unstacking green_block_1 from black_block_2, green_block_1 is in the arm, then we can put it down. Then we can pick up black_block_1 (which is under black_block_2, but if black_block_2 is still on black_block_1, then black_block_1 is not clear. Wait, after we unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2, black_block_2 becomes clear. So then, we can unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1. Then we can stack black_block_2 on green_block_1. But green_block_1 is on the table. Let's see:

So steps:

After step 4 (unstack green_block_2 from green_block_1 and put it down), then green_block_1 is clear. Then step 5: unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2. Then putdown green_block_1 (so now green_block_1 is on the table). Then we need to have black_block_1 on top of green_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 2). But black_block_1 is currently on the table, with black_block_2 on top of it. So to stack black_block_1 on green_block_1, we need to first move black_block_2. So after putting green_block_1 on the table, we can unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1. Then put it down. Then pickup black_block_1 and stack it onto green_block_1. Then, since green_block_1 was on the table, and now black_block_1 is on top of it, that satisfies the condition for constraint 2: green_block_1 is on the table (earlier when we put it there), but then later when we stack black_block_1 on it, but the constraint says that if green_block_1 is on the table in some state, there must be an earlier state where black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1. Wait, that's not possible. Wait, no: the constraint is that if in any state green_block_1 is on the table, there must be a prior state where black_block_1 is on top of it. So in our case, we first put green_block_1 on the table (state S1). Then later, we stack black_block_1 on it (state S2). But the constraint says that if green_block_1 is on the table in some state (S1), there must be an earlier state (before S1) where black_block_1 is on green_block_1. But in S1, green_block_1 is on the table, and prior to that, when was green_block_1 not on the table? It was on top of black_block_2. So during that time, black_block_1 is under black_block_2. So there is no prior state where black_block_1 is on green_block_1 before green_block_1 is on the table. Therefore, this approach would violate constraint 2.

So this path is invalid. Hmm. So how can we satisfy constraint 2? Let's think. To have green_block_1 on the table at some point (required by constraint 1), and before that state, there must be a state where black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1.

But how can black_block_1 be on green_block_1 before green_block_1 is on the table? Because if green_block_1 is under black_block_1, then green_block_1 must be on the table or on another block. Wait, if black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1, then green_block_1 is either on the table or on another block. So suppose we stack black_block_1 on green_block_1 while green_block_1 is on the table. Then, that satisfies the prior state (black_block_1 on green_block_1) before green_block_1 is on the table? No, because green_block_1 is already on the table when black_block_1 is stacked on it. So that doesn't work. The constraint is that when green_block_1 is on the table, there must have been a prior state where black_block_1 was on top of it. So the stacking of black_block_1 on green_block_1 must happen before green_block_1 is on the table. But how can green_block_1 be on a block (not the table) when we stack black_block_1 on it? Because initially, green_block_1 is on black_block_2. So perhaps we need to first move green_block_1 to another position where it's on top of a different block, stack black_block_1 on it there, then move green_block_1 to the table.

Alternatively, perhaps we need to move green_block_1 to be on top of another block, then stack black_block_1 on top of it, then move green_block_1 to the table. But this seems complicated. Let's try to sketch this.

Suppose we do the following steps:

1. Unstack all blocks above green_block_1 (green_block_2, purple_block_1, white_block_1, white_block_2) and put them on the table. So after these steps, green_block_1 is clear, on top of black_block_2.

2. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2 and put it on the table. But according to constraint 2, this is when green_block_1 is on the table. So before that, we need to have black_block_1 on top of green_block_1. But green_block_1 was on black_block_2, so how can black_block_1 be on top of green_block_1 before it's on the table?

Wait, perhaps the solution is to first move green_block_1 to some other block, stack black_block_1 on top of it there, then move green_block_1 to the table. Let's think.

For example:

After step 1: green_block_1 is on black_block_2. Let's unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2 (so now the arm holds green_block_1), then stack it onto another block, say black_block_1. Wait, but black_block_1 is on the table with black_block_2 on top of it. So to stack green_block_1 onto black_block_1, we need to first clear black_block_1. But black_block_2 is on top of it. So maybe:

After step 1, we have green_block_1 on black_block_2. Then, unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1 (since it's clear now?), but initially, after unstacking green_block_1, black_block_2 would be clear. Wait, after unstacking green_block_1 from black_block_2, black_block_2 becomes clear. Then we can unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1, put it down. Now black_block_1 is clear. Then we can stack green_block_1 on black_block_1. Then stack black_block_1 on green_block_1. Wait, no, because stacking requires the arm to hold the block. Let's see:

Hold on, let's outline this possible path:

After unstacking all the blocks above green_block_1 and putting them down:

- white_block_2, white_block_1, purple_block_1, green_block_2 are all on the table.

- green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2, which is on top of black_block_1.

Now, unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2. Now, the arm holds green_block_1. Then, we can stack green_block_1 onto black_block_1. Wait, but black_block_1 is on the table, and is clear (since black_block_2 was on top of it, but after unstacking green_block_1, black_block_2 is clear. Wait, no. Wait, initial stack is black_block_1 (table), black_block_2 on top, then green_block_1. So when we unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2, black_block_2 is still on black_block_1. So black_block_2 is not clear. Wait, no. Wait, after unstacking green_block_1 from black_block_2, black_block_2 is now clear (since green_block_1 was on top of it and now it's removed). So black_block_2 is on black_block_1, and is clear. Then we can unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1. Then put it down. Now black_block_1 is clear. Then, stack green_block_1 (which we were holding) onto black_block_1. So now, green_block_1 is on black_block_1. Then, to stack black_block_1 onto green_block_1, we need to pick up black_block_1, but it has green_block_1 on top. Wait, no. After stacking green_block_1 on black_block_1, black_block_1 is under green_block_1. So black_block_1 is not clear. So we can't pick it up. So this approach isn't working.

Hmm. Maybe another approach. Let's think again. The key is to have black_block_1 on top of green_block_1 in some state before green_block_1 is on the table.

So perhaps:

1. After clearing the tower, we have green_block_1 on black_block_2. Then, instead of moving green_block_1 directly to the table, we first move black_block_1 onto green_block_1. But how?

Wait, black_block_1 is under black_block_2. So to move black_block_1, we need to first remove black_block_2. Let's think:

After unstacking all the upper blocks, including green_block_1, the stack is black_block_1 (table) -> black_block_2 (clear). Then:

- unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1, put it down. Now black_block_1 is clear.

- pickup black_block_1 and stack it onto green_block_1 (which is on the table). Wait, but green_block_1 is not on the table yet. So if we have to stack black_block_1 on green_block_1, green_block_1 must be on a block or the table.

So perhaps:

- After unstacking green_block_1 from black_block_2 (after clearing the upper blocks), we put green_block_1 on the table. But then, according to constraint 2, before that state (green_block_1 on table), there must be a state where black_block_1 is on green_block_1. But how? Because green_block_1 was on black_block_2 before being moved to the table. So maybe we need to first stack black_block_1 on green_block_1 while green_block_1 is on black_block_2, then move green_block_1 to the table.

But how can we stack black_block_1 on green_block_1 when green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2? Because to stack black_block_1 on green_block_1, we need to hold black_block_1 and have green_block_1 clear. But green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2. So if we unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2, then we can stack black_block_1 on green_block_1. Wait, no. Let's think again:

After unstacking all blocks above green_block_1 (so green_block_1 is on top of black_block_2):

1. unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2. Now, hold green_block_1. Then, we need to stack black_block_1 onto green_block_1. But to do that, the arm must hold black_block_1. So after putting down green_block_1, we can unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1 (since black_block_2 is now clear), put it down. Then pickup black_block_1 and stack it on green_block_1. Then, green_block_1 is on the table. Wait, no. Let's outline:

- After unstacking green_block_1 from black_block_2, we put green_block_1 on the table (so now green_block_1 is on table). But according to constraint 2, before this state, there must be a state where black_block_1 is on green_block_1. But that hasn't happened yet.

So perhaps:

After unstacking green_block_1 from black_block_2, instead of putting it on the table, we place it somewhere else. Let's say we have another block, like black_block_2, which is now clear. So:

- After unstacking green_block_1 from black_block_2, hold green_block_1. Then stack it onto another block, say black_block_2. Wait, but black_block_2 is on black_block_1, which is on the table. So black_block_2 is clear. So we can stack green_block_1 onto black_block_2. Now, green_block_1 is on black_block_2. Then, we can unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1, put it down. Now black_block_1 is clear. Then, pickup black_block_1 and stack it onto green_block_1 (which is on black_block_2 on the table). Now, black_block_1 is on green_block_1. Then, we can unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2 (which is on the table) and put it on the table. Now, green_block_1 is on the table, and black_block_1 is on top of it. Wait, no: when we unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2 (which is on the table), green_block_1 is on black_block_2. Unstacking it would hold green_block_1, then putting it down. Then, black_block_1 is on green_block_1 (from previous stacking). Wait, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, let's try to structure the steps more clearly.

The key steps needed:

- To meet constraint 2: when green_block_1 is on the table, there must be a prior state where black_block_1 was on top of it. So we need to first have black_block_1 on green_block_1, then move green_block_1 to the table.

So steps would be:

1. Get black_block_1 on top of green_block_1 while green_block_1 is on some block (like black_block_2).

2. Move green_block_1 (with black_block_1 on top) to the table.

But how?

First, green_block_1 is initially on top of black_block_2. Let's say we unstack all the blocks above green_block_1 (as before). Then, we can unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2 and place it on the table. But this would violate constraint 2 unless we first have black_block_1 on it. So instead, after unstacking green_block_1 from black_block_2, stack it onto another block, then stack black_block_1 on it, then move green_block_1 to the table.

Let me try:

Steps:

After clearing all blocks above green_block_1:

- green_block_1 is on black_block_2.

Now:

1. unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2. (Arm holds green_block_1)

2. stack green_block_1 onto black_block_1. (But black_block_1 is on the table and is under black_block_2. So black_block_1 is not clear. Wait, no. After step 1, black_block_2 is on black_block_1 and is clear (since green_block_1 was removed). So we can unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1.

3. unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1. (Arm holds black_block_2)

4. putdown black_block_2. Now, black_block_1 is clear.

5. stack green_block_1 (still holding it?) Wait, no. After step 1, the arm is holding green_block_1. Then step 2 was supposed to stack it onto black_block_1, but black_block_1 is under black_block_2. So step 2 is not possible. So perhaps after step 1, we need to stack green_block_1 onto another block. Let's say after step 1, we put green_block_1 on the table. Then, we unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1, put it down. Then, stack black_block_1 onto green_block_1 (which is on the table). Now, black_block_1 is on green_block_1, and green_block_1 is on the table. Then, we can move green_block_1 to the table (but it's already there). No, this doesn't help.

Alternatively, after step 1 (unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2), we put green_block_1 on the table (now green_block_1 is on table). Then, to satisfy constraint 2, we need to have a prior state where black_block_1 is on green_block_1. But that hasn't happened. So this approach fails.

So perhaps the only way to satisfy constraint 2 is to have a state where green_block_1 is on the table, and before that, there's a state where black_block_1 is on green_block_1. So how can we achieve this?

Maybe:

After green_block_1 is on the table, we need to stack black_block_1 onto it, then unstack it again. But that would not meet constraint 2 because the green_block_1 is already on the table when black_block_1 is stacked on it. So the prior state (black_block_1 on green_block_1) occurs after green_block_1 is on the table, which doesn't help.

Hmm. This is tricky. Let's think differently. Maybe the green_block_1 is on the table at some point, but before that, it was on another block (like black_block_2) with black_block_1 stacked on top of it. So during that time, green_block_1 is on black_block_2, and black_block_1 is on green_block_1. Then, we move green_block_1 to the table, which would require unstacking black_block_1 first. Wait, but if green_block_1 is under black_block_1, we can't move it unless black_block_1 is moved.

So possible steps:

1. Unstack all blocks above green_block_1 (green_block_2, purple_block_1, white_block_1, white_block_2).

2. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2. Put it on the table. But then, we need to have black_block_1 on green_block_1 before that. So maybe:

Before moving green_block_1 to the table, first stack black_block_1 on it. But how? Since green_block_1 is on black_block_2, and black_block_2 is on black_block_1.

Wait, here's a possible approach:

After clearing the upper blocks, green_block_1 is on black_block_2. Then:

a. unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2. Now, green_block_1 is in hand.

b. stack green_block_1 onto black_block_1 (which is on the table, under black_block_2). But black_block_1 has black_block_2 on top, so it's not clear. So cannot stack.

No, that's not possible. So perhaps:

After step a, instead of stacking green_block_1, put it down on the table. Now green_block_1 is on the table. Then, to satisfy constraint 2, we need to have a prior state where black_block_1 was on green_block_1. But that hasn't happened. So this approach is invalid.

Alternative plan:

After clearing upper blocks, green_block_1 is on black_block_2. Then:

1. unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1 (since after removing green_block_1, black_block_2 is clear). Put black_block_2 on the table.

2. Now, black_block_1 is clear. Pickup black_block_1 and stack it on green_block_1 (which is on the table). Wait, but green_block_1 is still on black_block_2, which is now on the table. Wait, no. After step 1, black_block_2 is on the table. So green_block_1 is on black_block_2, which is on the table. So green_block_1 is not on the table. To stack black_block_1 on green_block_1, green_block_1 must be clear. But green_block_1 is on black_block_2, which is on the table. So green_block_1 is clear (since we unstacked all blocks above it). So we can stack black_block_1 on green_block_1.

Wait, let's outline:

After unstacking all upper blocks:

- black_block_1 is on the table.

- black_block_2 is on black_block_1.

- green_block_1 is on black_block_2.

- black_block_2 is clear (after removing green_block_1).

Wait, no. After unstacking green_block_1 from black_block_2, black_block_2 is clear. Then unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1 (putting black_block_2 on the table). Now, black_block_1 is clear. Then, green_block_1 is on the table (if we put it there). Or wait, after unstacking green_block_1 from black_block_2 (which was on black_block_1), the arm holds green_block_1. Then, you can put it down on the table. Now, green_block_1 is on the table. Then, unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1 (which is clear), put it on the table. Now, black_block_1 is clear. Then, pickup black_block_1 and stack it on green_block_1 (which is on the table). Now, black_block_1 is on green_block_1. So at this point, the state has green_block_1 on the table, and black_block_1 on top of it. Then, we can move green_block_1 to the table again (but it's already there). So this doesn't make sense. But according to constraint 2, when green_block_1 is on the table (as in this state), there must be a prior state where black_block_1 was on top of it. But in this case, the prior state is when green_block_1 was on the table and black_block_1 was stacked on it. That's the same state. No, because the stacking happens in the same state. So this doesn't satisfy the constraint.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I need to consult the constraints again.

The constraints are:

1. green_block_1 is on the table in at least one state.

2. If green_block_1 is on the table in some state, then there must be an earlier state where black_block_1 is on top of it.

3. At least one state where either holding black_block_1 or black_block_2 is on white_block_2.

4. At least one state where holding black_block_1 and purple_block_1 is on green_block_1.

So for constraint 2, the only way to satisfy it is to have a state where green_block_1 is on the table, and prior to that, there's a state where black_block_1 is on top of green_block_1. So the sequence must be:

State A: black_block_1 is on green_block_1 (which is on some block or table)

State B: green_block_1 is on the table

With State A before State B.

So, to achieve this, we need to first stack black_block_1 on green_block_1, then move green_block_1 to the table. But how?

After unstacking all blocks above green_block_1, green_block_1 is on black_block_2. Then:

- unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2 (now holding green_block_1)

- stack green_block_1 onto another block, say black_block_1 (but black_block_1 is under black_block_2). Wait, no. Black_block_1 is on the table, with black_block_2 on top. So to stack green_block_1 onto black_block_1, we need to clear black_block_1 first.

So:

After unstacking green_block_1 from black_block_2:

1. unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1 (now possible because black_block_2 is clear)

2. putdown black_block_2.

3. Now, black_block_1 is clear. Stack green_block_1 (still holding it) onto black_block_1. So now, green_block_1 is on black_block_1.

4. Now, pickup black_block_1 (but it's under green_block_1). So we can't, because green_block_1 is on top. So this is not possible.

Alternative:

After step 3 (green_block_1 on black_block_1), we need to stack black_block_1 onto green_block_1. Wait, but black_block_1 is under green_block_1. So this is impossible.

Alternatively, maybe after stacking green_block_1 on black_block_1, we unstack green_block_1 again and put it on the table. But that would require unstacking green_block_1 from black_block_1, which is allowed since green_block_1 is clear. So:

After step 3:

4. unstack green_block_1 from black_block_1. Put it on the table. Now, green_block_1 is on the table. But before this state, we had green_block_1 on black_block_1. So in state where green_block_1 is on black_block_1, black_block_1 is on the table. But how does that help? Because constraint 2 requires that when green_block_1 is on the table, there was a prior state where black_block_1 was on green_block_1. But in this scenario, green_block_1 was on black_block_1, not the other way around. So that doesn't satisfy the constraint.

This is getting really complicated. Maybe I need to think about the constraints in reverse. Let's consider that the final goal is to have black_block_2 on green_block_1. So in the final state, green_block_1 must be clear (to have black_block_2 on top). So green_block_1 must be either on the table or under another block. But the goal only requires black_block_2 on green_block_1; the rest can be anything, as long as the constraints are met.

Let me outline a possible plan that meets all constraints:

1. Unstack all blocks above green_block_1 (green_block_2, purple_block_1, white_block_1, white_block_2) and put them on the table.

2. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2 and put it on the table. This satisfies constraint 1 (green_block_1 on table). But before that, we need to have black_block_1 on green_block_1. So this approach fails constraint 2.

Alternative plan:

1. Unstack all blocks above black_block_2 (green_block_1, green_block_2, etc.), then move black_block_2 and black_block_1.

Wait, perhaps the key is to first stack black_block_1 onto green_block_1 before moving green_block_1 to the table. Let's try:

- Unstack all blocks above green_block_1.

- Now, green_block_1 is on black_block_2.

- Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2. Arm holds green_block_1.

- stack green_block_1 onto black_block_1. But black_block_1 is under black_block_2. So first, unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1.

So steps:

After unstacking green_block_1:

1. unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1 (possible because black_block_2 is clear after removing green_block_1).

2. putdown black_block_2.

3. stack green_block_1 onto black_block_1. Now, green_block_1 is on black_block_1, which is on the table.

4. Now, to satisfy constraint 2, we need to have black_block_1 on green_block_1. So this step is not helping.

Wait, no. After step 3, green_block_1 is on black_block_1. So we need to stack black_block_1 on green_block_1. So:

5. unstack green_block_1 from black_block_1. Put it down.

6. pickup black_block_1 and stack it on green_block_1. Now, black_block_1 is on green_block_1, which is on the table.

7. Now, unstack black_block_1 from green_block_1 and put it down. Now green_block_1 is on the table, and black_block_1 is on the table.

But this would satisfy constraint 2 because in step 6, black_block_1 is on green_block_1 (which is on the table). Then in step 7, green_block_1 is still on the table. So the state where green_block_1 is on the table (step 7) has a prior state (step 6) where black_block_1 is on green_block_1. So this satisfies constraint 2.

Now, after that, we need to get black_block_2 on green_block_1. So:

8. pickup black_block_2 (which is on the table).

9. stack black_block_2 on green_block_1.

This would achieve the goal. But we also need to check other constraints.

Constraint 3: At least one state where holding black_block_1 or black_block_2 is on white_block_2. In this plan, during step 6, we are holding black_block_1. So that satisfies one of the conditions. So constraint 3 is met.

Constraint 4: At least one state where holding black_block_1 and purple_block_1 is on green_block_1. In this plan, when do we hold black_block_1? In step 6: after pickup black_block_1 (step 5 puts green_block_1 down, step 6 picks up black_block_1). At that point, is purple_block_1 on green_block_1? Initially, purple_block_1 is on green_block_2. After unstacking all the upper blocks, purple_block_1 is on the table. So in step 6, purple_block_1 is on the table. So constraint 4 is not met.

So this approach fails constraint 4.

Thus, we need to ensure that at some point, we are holding black_block_1 and purple_block_1 is on green_block_1. How can we achieve that?

Maybe after moving purple_block_1 onto green_block_1 at some point.

So let's try integrating that into the plan.

Alternative plan:

After unstacking all upper blocks (white_block_2, white_block_1, purple_block_1, green_block_2), they are all on the table.

Then:

1. unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2. Hold green_block_1.

2. stack green_block_1 onto purple_block_1 (which is on the table). Now, green_block_1 is on purple_block_1. Then, purple_block_1 is under green_block_1.

3. unstack purple_block_1 from green_block_1. Wait, but purple_block_1 is on the table, and green_block_1 is on top of it. So unstacking green_block_1 from purple_block_1.

But this doesn't help. Let's think differently.

Wait, to have purple_block_1 on green_block_1, we need to stack purple_block_1 onto green_block_1. So:

After unstacking all upper blocks:

- purple_block_1 is on the table.

- green_block_1 is on black_block_2.

So steps:

1. unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2. Hold it.

2. stack green_block_1 onto purple_block_1 (now purple_block_1 is on green_block_1? No, stack green_block_1 on purple_block_1 would have green_block_1 on top of purple_block_1.

Wait, no. The stack action is placing the held block on top of another. So if I hold green_block_1 and stack it on purple_block_1, then green_block_1 is on purple_block_1. So purple_block_1 is under green_block_1. But we need purple_block_1 on green_block_1. So that's the opposite. So to get purple_block_1 on green_block_1, we need to hold purple_block_1 and stack it onto green_block_1.

So:

After unstacking all upper blocks, purple_block_1 is on the table.

1. pickup purple_block_1.

2. stack purple_block_1 onto green_block_1 (which is on black_block_2). But green_block_1 is on black_block_2. Is it clear? Yes, because after unstacking green_block_2, purple_block_1, etc., green_block_1 is clear. So yes, we can stack purple_block_1 onto green_block_1.

3. Now, purple_block_1 is on green_block_1.

Then, to satisfy constraint 4, we need to be holding black_block_1 while purple_block_1 is on green_block_1. So during this time, after step 3, purple_block_1 is on green_block_1. So we need to pickup black_block_1 at this point. But black_block_1 is under black_block_2. So first, we need to unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1.

4. unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1. Now, hold black_block_2.

5. putdown black_block_2.

6. pickup black_block_1.

Now, we are holding black_block_1, and purple_block_1 is on green_block_1. So this satisfies constraint 4.

Then, we can proceed to stack black_block_1 onto green_block_1 to satisfy constraint 2.

But wait, after step 6:

- black_block_1 is in hand.

- purple_block_1 is on green_block_1.

- green_block_1 is on black_block_2, which is on the table.

Then, stack black_block_1 onto green_block_1. Now, green_block_1 has black_block_1 on top. Then, we need to move green_block_1 to the table. But green_block_1 is under black_block_1. So we need to unstack black_block_1 first.

7. unstack black_block_1 from green_block_1. Now, hold black_block_1.

8. putdown black_block_1.

9. unstack green_block_1 from purple_block_1. Now, hold green_block_1.

10. putdown green_block_1 on the table. Now, constraint 1 is met (green_block_1 on table), and constraint 2 is met because prior to this state, black_block_1 was on green_block_1 (step 6-7).

Now, the goal is to have black_block_2 on green_block_1. So:

11. pickup black_block_2 (which is on the table).

12. stack black_block_2 on green_block_1 (which is on the table). Done.

This plan seems to satisfy all constraints:

- Constraint 1: green_block_1 is on the table in step 10.

- Constraint 2: step 10 has green_block_1 on table, and prior step 6-7 had black_block_1 on green_block_1.

- Constraint 3: during step 6, holding black_block_1.

- Constraint 4: during step 6, holding black_block_1 and purple_block_1 is on green_block_1.

Yes, this seems to work. Now, let's check the steps in order:

1. Unstack all blocks above green_block_1: white_block_2, white_block_1, purple_block_1, green_block_2.

So steps to unstack:

Action: unstack white_block_2 white_block_1

Action: putdown white_block_2

Action: unstack white_block_1 purple_block_1

Action: putdown white_block_1

Action: unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2

Action: putdown purple_block_1

Action: unstack green_block_2 green_block_1

Action: putdown green_block_2

Now, green_block_1 is on black_block_2.

Then:

1. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2

Action: unstack green_block_1 black_block_2

Action: putdown green_block_1 (Wait, no. Wait, in the previous alternative plan, after unstacking green_block_1, we stack purple_block_1 onto green_block_1. So let's correct the steps.

Wait, after unstacking all upper blocks (white_block_2, etc.), we have:

- green_block_2 is on green_block_1 (no, wait, no: initial state after unstacking green_block_2 from green_block_1, green_block_2 is putdown on the table. So green_block_1 is on black_block_2.

So after unstacking green_block_2, green_block_1 is on black_block_2.

So steps after unstacking upper blocks:

Now, proceed to step where we pickup purple_block_1 and stack it onto green_block_1.

But first, green_block_1 is on black_block_2. So:

Action: unstack green_block_1 black_block_2

Action: putdown green_block_1 (Wait, no. The plan requires stacking purple_block_1 onto green_block_1. But green_block_1 is currently on black_block_2. So to stack purple_block_1 onto green_block_1, we need green_block_1 to be clear. So perhaps we need to unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2, put it down, then stack purple_block_1 on it.

Wait, let me retrace the steps according to the alternative plan:

After unstacking all upper blocks, green_block_1 is on black_block_2.

Steps:

1. unstack green_block_1 black_block_2 → hold green_block_1.

2. putdown green_block_1 → now green_block_1 is on table.

3. pickup purple_block_1 (from table).

4. stack purple_block_1 green_block_1 → now purple_block_1 is on green_block_1.

5. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1 → hold black_block_2.

6. putdown black_block_2.

7. pickup black_block_1.

At this point, we are holding black_block_1, and purple_block_1 is on green_block_1. So this satisfies constraint 4.

Then:

8. stack black_block_1 purple_block_1 → black_block_1 is on purple_block_1 (which is on green_block_1). Wait, but the goal is to have black_block_2 on green_block_1. So perhaps I need to adjust this.

Alternatively, after step 7, we need to stack black_block_1 onto green_block_1.

But green_block_1 has purple_block_1 on top. So green_block_1 is not clear. Therefore, we cannot stack.

Ah, here's a problem. If purple_block_1 is on green_block_1, then green_block_1 is not clear. So to stack black_block_1 on green_block_1, we need to first remove purple_block_1.

So steps after step 7:

8. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_1 (since purple_block_1 is clear).

9. putdown purple_block_1.

10. stack black_block_1 green_block_1.

Now, black_block_1 is on green_block_1. Then, we can proceed to put green_block_1 on the table.

11. unstack black_block_1 green_block_1.

12. putdown black_block_1.

13. unstack green_block_1 (from table) → but it's already on the table. Wait, no. After step 2, green_block_1 is on the table. Then, in step 4, purple_block_1 is stacked on green_block_1. So after step 9, green_block_1 is on the table, clear. So step 13 is not needed.

Wait, let's re-express the steps:

After step 4: purple_block_1 is on green_block_1 (which is on the table).

Step 5: unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1 → possible because after step 1, black_block_2 is clear.

Step 6: putdown black_block_2.

Step 7: pickup black_block_1.

Step 8: stack black_block_1 purple_block_1 → but purple_block_1 is on green_block_1. So after stacking, black_block_1 is on purple_block_1, which is on green_block_1.

Then, to move green_block_1 to the table (but it's already on the table). Wait, this is confusing.

Alternatively, after step 4 (purple_block_1 on green_block_1), green_block_1 is on the table. So to satisfy constraint 2, we need to have black_block_1 on green_block_1 before green_block_1 is on the table. But in this case, green_block_1 is already on the table when purple_block_1 is stacked on it. So this approach fails constraint 2.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let's try to outline the entire plan step-by-step, considering all actions and ensuring constraints are met.

Initial state:

black_block_1 on table.

black_block_2 on black_block_1.

green_block_1 on black_block_2.

green_block_2 on green_block_1.

purple_block_1 on green_block_2.

white_block_1 on purple_block_1.

white_block_2 on white_block_1.

All clear except white_block_2.

Plan Steps:

1. Unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1.

   Preconditions: white_block_2 is clear (yes), arm empty (yes).

   Effect: holding white_block_2, white_block_1 is clear.

2. Putdown white_block_2.

   Preconditions: holding white_block_2.

   Effect: white_block_2 on table, arm empty.

3. Unstack white_block_1 from purple_block_1.

   Preconditions: white_block_1 is clear (yes), arm empty.

   Effect: holding white_block_1, purple_block_1 clear.

4. Putdown white_block_1.

5. Unstack purple_block_1 from green_block_2.

   Preconditions: purple_block_1 clear (yes), arm empty.

   Effect: holding purple_block_1, green_block_2 clear.

6. Putdown purple_block_1.

7. Unstack green_block_2 from green_block_1.

   Preconditions: green_block_2 clear (yes), arm empty.

   Effect: holding green_block_2, green_block_1 clear.

8. Putdown green_block_2.

Now, green_block_1 is on black_block_2, which is on black_block_1.

9. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2.

   Preconditions: green_block_1 clear (yes), arm empty.

   Effect: holding green_block_1, black_block_2 clear.

10. Putdown green_block_1.

    Now green_block_1 is on table, satisfying constraint 1. But constraint 2 requires that before this, black_block_1 was on green_block_1. Which hasn't happened yet. So this is invalid.

So, instead of putting down green_block_1, we need to stack it elsewhere and then stack black_block_1 on it.

Alternative steps after step 9:

9. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2. Now holding green_block_1.

10. Stack green_block_1 on black_block_1. But black_block_1 has black_block_2 on top, which is clear. So first, unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1.

11. Unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1. Preconditions: black_block_2 is clear (yes), arm empty (yes, after step 9, arm is holding green_block_1). Wait, no. After step 9, the arm is holding green_block_1. So cannot unstack black_block_2.

So need to put down green_block_1 first.

9. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2 → holding green_block_1.

10. Putdown green_block_1.

11. Unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1 → arm empty now.

12. Putdown black_block_2.

13. Pickup green_block_1.

14. Stack green_block_1 on black_block_1. Now green_block_1 is on black_block_1.

15. Pickup black_block_1. Wait, no. After stacking, arm is empty. So:

After step 14, arm is empty.

15. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_1. Now holding green_block_1.

16. Putdown green_block_1.

Now, green_block_1 is on the table. This satisfies constraint 1. But before this, step 14 had green_block_1 on black_block_1. So there's no state where black_block_1 is on green_block_1. So this doesn't satisfy constraint 2.

Hmm. Another approach: after unstacking green_block_1 from black_block_2 (step 9), stack it on another block to create a state where black_block_1 is on green_block_1.

For example:

9. Unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2 → holding green_block_1.

10. Stack green_block_1 on black_block_2. Then, unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1.

11. Unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1 → holding black_block_2.

12. Stack black_block_2 on green_block_1 → now black_block_2 is on green_block_1, which is on black_block_2 (original position). This seems messy.

Alternatively:

After step 9, stack green_block_1 on purple_block_1 (which is on the table).

10. Stack green_block_1 purple_block_1.

11. Pickup black_block_1 (now clear after unstacking black_block_2 in step 9? No, black_block_1 is under black_block_2. After step 9, black_block_2 is still on black_block_1. So we need to unstack black_block_2 first.

This is getting too complicated. Perhaps I need to use a different strategy, like reverse planning from the goal.

The goal is black_block_2 on green_block_1. To achieve this, green_block_1 must be clear. So green_block_1 could be on the table or under another block. But given the constraints, it's likely that green_block_1 ends up on the table.

To stack black_block_2 on green_block_1, the arm needs to hold black_block_2, and green_block_1 must be clear. So steps would be:

- unstack black_block_2 from wherever it is and put it on green_block_1.

In the initial state, black_block_2 is under green_block_1. So after removing all blocks above black_block_2 (which are green_block_1 and above), we can unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1 and stack it on green_block_1.

But green_block_1 is initially on top of black_block_2. So to move black_block_2, we need to first clear the blocks above it. Which includes green_block_1, green_block_2, etc.

So steps:

1. Unstack all blocks above black_block_2: green_block_1, green_block_2, purple_block_1, white_block_1, white_block_2.

This is the same as unstacking the entire tower from the top down.

After that, black_block_2 is clear and on black_block_1.

2. Unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1 → hold black_block_2.

3. Stack black_block_2 on green_block_1 (which is now on the table? Or we need to move green_block_1 to the table first.)

But where is green_block_1 after step 1? After unstacking green_block_1 from black_block_2, green_block_1 is put down on the table.

Wait, let's outline:

Steps to unstack all blocks above black_block_2:

1. unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1 → put down.

2. unstack white_block_1 from purple_block_1 → put down.

3. unstack purple_block_1 from green_block_2 → put down.

4. unstack green_block_2 from green_block_1 → put down.

5. unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2 → put down.

Now, black_block_2 is clear and on black_block_1.

6. unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1 → hold.

7. stack black_block_2 on green_block_1 (which is on the table).

This achieves the goal. Now, check constraints:

Constraint 1: green_block_1 is on the table (step 5).

Constraint 2: before step 5 (green_block_1 on table), there must be a state where black_block_1 is on green_block_1. But this hasn't happened. So this plan fails constraint 2.

Thus, we need to modify this plan to include stacking black_block_1 on green_block_1 before moving green_block_1 to the table.

So after step 5, green_block_1 is on the table. To satisfy constraint 2, we need a prior state where black_block_1 is on green_block_1.

So perhaps, after step 4 (unstack green_block_2 from green_block_1), green_block_1 is on black_block_2. Then:

5. unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2 → hold.

6. stack green_block_1 on black_block_1 → but black_block_1 is under black_block_2. So first, unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1.

7. unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1 → hold.

8. putdown black_block_2.

9. stack green_block_1 on black_block_1 → now green_block_1 is on black_block_1.

10. unstack green_block_1 from black_block_1 → hold.

11. putdown green_block_1 → now green_block_1 is on table.

Now, constraint 1 is met (step 11), and prior step 9 had green_block_1 on black_block_1. Wait, no. Step 9 is stack green_block_1 on black_block_1, so green_block_1 is on black_block_1. Then, step 10 unstack it, so in step 11, green_block_1 is on the table. So prior to step 11, green_block_1 was on black_block_1 (step 9-10). But constraint 2 requires that when green_block_1 is on the table (step 11), there must be an earlier state where black_block_1 is on green_block_1. But in step 9-10, black_block_1 is under green_block_1, not on top. So this doesn't satisfy the constraint.

This is really challenging. Perhaps the only way to satisfy constraint 2 is to have a state where black_block_1 is on green_block_1, then move green_block_1 to the table. But to have black_block_1 on green_block_1, green_block_1 must be clear and on some block or the table. So:

After unstacking green_block_1 from black_block_2:

- green_block_1 is in hand.

- stack green_block_1 on the table.

- pickup black_block_1 (which is on the table, under black_block_2).

But black_block_1 is under black_block_2, so it's not clear. So can't pickup.

Thus, we need to unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1 first.

So steps:

After unstacking all blocks above black_block_2 (steps 1-4):

5. unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2 → hold.

6. putdown green_block_1 → on table.

7. unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1 → hold.

8. putdown black_block_2 → on table.

9. pickup black_block_1 → now possible.

10. stack black_block_1 on green_block_1 → which is on table.

Now, black_block_1 is on green_block_1. Then, to move green_block_1 to the table, we need to unstack black_block_1.

11. unstack black_block_1 from green_block_1 → hold.

12. putdown black_block_1 → on table.

Now, green_block_1 is on table, and constraint 2 is satisfied because prior to step 12, black_block_1 was on green_block_1 (step 10-11).

Then, stack black_block_2 on green_block_1:

13. pickup black_block_2 → on table.

14. stack black_block_2 green_block_1 → done.

This plan meets the goal and satisfies constraints 1 and 2.

Now, check constraints 3 and 4:

Constraint 3: At least one state where holding black_block_1 or black_block_2 is on white_block_2.

In step 9, pickup black_block_1. Also, step 13, pickup black_block_2. So steps 9 and 13 involve holding these blocks. Also, in step 14, black_block_2 is stacked on green_block_1. So if white_block_2 is on the table, there's no state where black_block_2 is on white_block_2. But step 14 does not place black_block_2 on white_block_2. So constraint 3 requires at least one state where either holding black_block_1 or black_block_2 is on white_block_2.

In this plan, during step 9 and 10, we are holding black_block_1. So this satisfies the first part of constraint 3.

Constraint 4: At least one state where holding black_block_1 and purple_block_1 is on green_block_1.

In this plan, when are we holding black_block_1? Steps 9-10 and 11. During those steps, where is purple_block_1? After step 6, purple_block_1 is on the table (from step 3). So during step 9-10, purple_block_1 is on the table. Thus, constraint 4 is not met.

Thus, we need to adjust the plan to have a state where we are holding black_block_1 and purple_block_1 is on green_block_1.

To achieve this, during the time when we are holding black_block_1, purple_block_1 must be on green_block_1. So we need to stack purple_block_1 on green_block_1 at some point before or during that time.

So let's modify the plan:

After step 6 (green_block_1 on table):

7. pickup purple_block_1 (from table).

8. stack purple_block_1 green_block_1.

Now, purple_block_1 is on green_block_1.

9. unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1 → hold.

10. putdown black_block_2.

11. pickup black_block_1.

At this point, we are holding black_block_1 and purple_block_1 is on green_block_1. This satisfies constraint 4.

Then proceed:

12. stack black_block_1 purple_block_1 → but purple_block_1 is on green_block_1.

Wait, no. To stack black_block_1 on purple_block_1, we need purple_block_1 to be clear. But purple_block_1 is on green_block_1 and is clear (since nothing is on top). So yes.

12. stack black_block_1 purple_block_1 → black_block_1 on purple_block_1.

13. unstack black_block_1 purple_block_1 → hold.

14. putdown black_block_1.

15. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_1 → hold.

16. putdown purple_block_1.

Now, green_block_1 is on table, and we can proceed to stack black_block_2 on it.

17. pickup black_block_2.

18. stack black_block_2 green_block_1.

This plan now includes:

- Constraint 3: holding black_block_1 in step 11.

- Constraint 4: during step 11, holding black_block_1 and purple_block_1 is on green_block_1.

Thus, all constraints are met.

Now, let's write out the entire sequence of actions:

1. Unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
2. Putdown white_block_2
3. Unstack white_block_1 purple_block_1
4. Putdown white_block_1
5. Unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2
6. Putdown purple_block_1
7. Unstack green_block_2 green_block_1
8. Putdown green_block_2
9. Unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
10. Putdown green_block_1
11. Pickup purple_block_1
12. Stack purple_block_1 green_block_1
13. Unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
14. Putdown black_block_2
15. Pickup black_block_1
16. Stack black_block_1 purple_block_1
17. Unstack black_block_1 purple_block_1
18. Putdown black_block_1
19. Unstack purple_block_1 green_block_1
20. Putdown purple_block_1
21. Pickup black_block_2
22. Stack black_block_2 green_block_1

This plan has 22 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way. However, given the complexity of the constraints, this might be necessary.

But let's check if any steps can be optimized. For example, steps 16-20 involve stacking and unstacking black_block_1 and purple_block_1, which could be avoided. Let's see:

After step 15: holding black_block_1, purple_block_1 is on green_block_1. This already satisfies constraint 4. So instead of stacking and unstacking, perhaps we can put down black_block_1 immediately.

So after step 15:

16. Putdown black_block_1.

17. Unstack purple_block_1 green_block_1.

18. Putdown purple_block_1.

19. Pickup black_block_2.

20. Stack black_block_2 green_block_1.

This reduces the steps to 20.

But does this meet all constraints?

Constraint 4 requires that at least one state has holding black_block_1 and purple_block_1 on green_block_1. This occurs in step 15, before putdown. So yes.

Thus, the plan becomes:

1. Unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
2. Putdown white_block_2
3. Unstack white_block_1 purple_block_1
4. Putdown white_block_1
5. Unstack purple_block_1 green_block_2
6. Putdown purple_block_1
7. Unstack green_block_2 green_block_1
8. Putdown green_block_2
9. Unstack green_block_1 black_block_2
10. Putdown green_block_1
11. Pickup purple_block_1
12. Stack purple_block_1 green_block_1
13. Unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
14. Putdown black_block_2
15. Pickup black_block_1
16. Putdown black_block_1
17. Unstack purple_block_1 green_block_1
18. Putdown purple_block_1
19. Pickup black_block_2
20. Stack black_block_2 green_block_1

Now, this plan has 20 steps. But we can check if some steps can be further optimized.

For example, after step 9 (unstack green_block_1 from black_block_2), we put it down. Then, pickup purple_block_1 and stack it on green_block_1 (steps 11-12). Then unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1 (step 13), putdown (14), pickup black_block_1 (15), putdown (16). 

Perhaps after step 15 (pickup black_block_1), we can immediately stack it on green_block_1, then unstack it. But this would require green_block_1 to be clear. At step 15, purple_block_1 is on green_block_1. So no. Hence, the need to first unstack purple_block_1.

But perhaps after step 12, we can unstack purple_block_1 from green_block_1 before proceeding. But then, constraint 4 wouldn't be met.

Alternatively, after step 12, when purple_block_1 is on green_block_1, and we are holding nothing, we can pickup black_block_1. But black_block_1 is under black_block_2. So first, we need to unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1.

Thus, the steps are necessary.

Therefore, the final plan is as outlined, with 20 steps. However, I need to check if there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, maybe we can combine some steps.

Wait, after step 12, purple_block_1 is on green_block_1 (which is on the table). Then, we can unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1 (step 13), putdown (14), then pickup black_block_1 (step 15). At this point, we are holding black_block_1 and purple_block_1 is on green_block_1. So constraint 4 is met. Then, instead of putting down black_block_1, we can use it somehow else.

But the goal is to have black_block_2 on green_block_1. So after step 15, we can put down black_block_1 and proceed to stack black_block_2.

But perhaps steps 15-18 can be adjusted:

15. Pickup black_block_1 → holding it.

16. Stack black_block_1 purple_block_1 → now black_block_1 is on purple_block_1, which is on green_block_1.

17. Unstack black_block_1 purple_block_1 → hold.

18. Putdown black_block_1 → now, black_block_1 is on the table.

19. Unstack purple_block_1 green_block_1 → hold.

20. Putdown purple_block_1 → on table.

21. Pickup black_block_2 → on table.

22. Stack black_block_2 green_block_1.

This adds more steps. So no optimization.

Thus, the initial plan of 20 steps seems necessary.

But the user asked for an optimal plan (shortest possible). Is there a shorter way?

Let me think again. Perhaps after stacking purple_block_1 on green_block_1 (step 12), instead of unstacking black_block_2 and black_block_1, we can directly pickup black_block_1. But black_block_1 is under black_block_2. So no. So steps 13-14 are necessary to clear black_block_1.

Alternatively, after step 12, we can unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1 (step 13), then stack black_block_2 on green_block_1 (since green_block_1 is clear). But in step 12, purple_block_1 is on green_block_1. So green_block_1 is not clear. Thus, can't stack black_block_2 on green_block_1 until purple_block_1 is removed.

Thus, steps 17-18 are necessary.

Therefore, the 20-step plan is likely the shortest possible given the constraints.
