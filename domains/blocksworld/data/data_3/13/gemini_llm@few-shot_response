Okay, let's break this down. The goal is to have brown_block_1 on the table. Currently, brown_block_1 is on purple_block_3. We need to move brown_block_1 to the table.

Here's the initial state:
* purple_block_1 is on the table
* red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1
* purple_block_2 is on top of red_block_1
* grey_block_1 is on the table
* purple_block_3 is on the table
* brown_block_1 is on top of purple_block_3
* white_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1

Here's the plan:

```
```
unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3
putdown brown_block_1
```
