```
```
unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3
putdown brown_block_1
pickup purple_block_3
stack purple_block_3 brown_block_1
unstack purple_block_3 brown_block_1
putdown purple_block_3
```
```

Wait, this plan moves brown_block_1 to the table, then stacks and unstacks purple_block_3 on it. But where is the step for picking up white_block_1 to satisfy constraint4? This plan doesn't include that, so it's invalid.

Ah, right. The correct plan must include steps that involve holding white_block_1. The correct minimal steps are:

```
```
unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1
putdown white_block_1
unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3
putdown brown_block_1
pickup purple_block_3
stack purple_block_3 brown_block_1
```
```

This plan has 6 steps. Let's validate each constraint:

1. **Brown_block_1 not clear**: Achieved in step6 when purple_block_3 is stacked on it.
2. **Earlier state for constraint2**: Step5 (pickup purple_block_3) makes purple_block_3 not on the table, which is before step6.
3. **Purple_block_1 not clear**: Already true initially.
4. **Holding white_block_1**: Step1 unstack white_block_1, satisfying the requirement.
5. **White_block_1 not on table**: True initially, so no action needed.
6. **Implication for white_block_1**: Already satisfied as brown_block_1 is not on the table initially.

This plan satisfies all constraints and has 6 steps, which is optimal.
