Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get the brown_block_1 onto the table, but there are several constraints we need to satisfy along the way. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the goal, then break down each constraint and figure out how to incorporate them into the plan.

First, the initial state:

- purple_block_1 is on the table with red_block_1 on top of it, and purple_block_2 on top of red_block_1. So the stack here is purple_block_1 (bottom), red_block_1, purple_block_2 (top). Purple_block_2 is clear.
- grey_block_1 is on the table with white_block_1 on top. White_block_1 is clear.
- purple_block_3 is on the table with brown_block_1 on top. Brown_block_1 is clear.
- The robotic arm is empty.

The goal is to have brown_block_1 on the table. So we need to move brown_block_1 from purple_block_3 to the table. But there are constraints.

Constraints:

1. At some state, brown_block_1 must have a block on top (so it's not clear). But since our goal is to have brown_block_1 on the table, which would make it clear, this must happen before the final step. Also, when this happens, there must have been an earlier state where either purple_block_3 is not on the table (it's under brown_block_1 initially, so if we move brown_block_1, purple_block_3 remains on the table unless moved) or grey_block_1 is not on the table (grey_block_1 is under white_block_1, so if we move grey_block_1, but initially it's on the table).

2. At some state, purple_block_1 must not be clear (so something is on top of it). Currently, it has red_block_1 and purple_block_2 on top. So in the initial state, purple_block_1 is not clear. Wait, but the initial state says red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1, which means purple_block_1 is not clear. But the constraint says that if at any state purple_block_1 is not clear, then in that state or a later one, the arm is holding white_block_1. Hmm. So since in the initial state purple_block_1 is not clear, but the constraint requires that if it's not clear in state s, then in s or a later state, the arm is holding white_block_1. But in the initial state, the arm isn't holding anything, so this might be a problem. Wait, the initial state has purple_block_1 with red_block_1 on it. So the constraint says that whenever purple_block_1 is not clear, the arm must hold white_block_1 in that state or a later one. But the initial state already violates this unless we address it. Wait, no. The constraint is a conditional: if in state s, purple_block_1 is not clear, then in s or after, the arm holds white_block_1. So the initial state s0 has purple_block_1 not clear, so we must have that in s0 or some state after s0, the arm is holding white_block_1. But in s0, the arm isn't holding anything. Therefore, in some later state, the arm must hold white_block_1. So we need to ensure that at some point, the arm picks up white_block_1.

3. At some state, white_block_1 is not on the table. Currently, it's on top of grey_block_1, so it's not on the table. Wait, the initial state says "white_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1", so white_block_1 is not on the table. Therefore, the initial state already satisfies the third constraint's existence condition. However, the constraint says that if in state s, white_block_1 is not on the table, then in s or a later state, either the arm is holding purple_block_1 or brown_block_1 is not on the table. In the initial state, white_block_1 is not on the table, so we need to ensure that in the initial state or later, either the arm holds purple_block_1 or brown_block_1 is not on the table. But in the initial state, brown_block_1 is on top of purple_block_3 (so not on the table). Wait, the problem's original state says "brown_block_1 is on top of purple_block_3", which means brown_block_1 is not on the table. So the initial state already satisfies the second part of the implication (brown_block_1 is not on the table). So the constraint is automatically satisfied. Therefore, this constraint doesn't require any action because the condition (white_block_1 not on table) is already true in the initial state, and the required implication is already satisfied because brown_block_1 is not on the table. So this constraint is already satisfied.

Wait, but the problem states that the original state has brown_block_1 on top of purple_block_3. So in the initial state, brown_block_1 is not on the table. Therefore, in the initial state, since white_block_1 is not on the table (it's on grey_block_1), the condition "white_block_1 is not on the table" holds. Then the constraint requires that in that state or later, either the arm is holding purple_block_1 or brown_block_1 is not on the table. But in the initial state, brown_block_1 is not on the table (it's on purple_block_3), so the implication holds. Therefore, this constraint is already satisfied and doesn't require any changes to the plan. So we don't need to do anything for this constraint.

But let's confirm the constraints again:

Constraint 3: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: white_block_1 is not on the table". Since white_block_1 is on grey_block_1 initially, this is already true. So that's satisfied.

The fourth constraint: If in state s, purple_block_1 is not clear, then in s or a later state, the arm is holding white_block_1. Since in the initial state, purple_block_1 is not clear, we need to ensure that at some point after, the arm holds white_block_1. So during the plan, we need to pick up white_block_1 at some point.

But our main goal is to put brown_block_1 on the table. Let's think about the steps required for that. To put brown_block_1 on the table, we need to unstack it from purple_block_3. Since brown_block_1 is clear (initial state), we can perform unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3. Wait, but unstack requires that the arm is not holding anything, which it isn't. So unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 would pick it up, then put it down. But wait, the effect of unstack is that the arm is holding brown_block_1, and then we can put it down with putdown. However, doing that would immediately achieve the goal. But we have to satisfy the other constraints first.

Wait, the first constraint says that at some state, brown_block_1 must have a block on top (i.e., it's not clear). But if we unstack brown_block_1 and put it down, then brown_block_1 is on the table and clear. So to satisfy the first constraint, we need to have a state where brown_block_1 has a block on top. But in the initial state, brown_block_1 is clear. So we need to place a block on top of it at some point before putting it on the table.

But the goal is to have brown_block_1 on the table. So the plan would need to involve moving a block onto brown_block_1, then moving it off again so that we can put brown_block_1 on the table. Hmm. But that seems a bit tricky. Let's think.

Alternatively, maybe during the process of achieving the goal, we can temporarily stack something on brown_block_1. For example, we could unstack brown_block_1, then stack it back on purple_block_3, but that doesn't help. Or perhaps stack another block on top of brown_block_1, then unstack it again. But how?

Wait, the first constraint requires that in at least one state, brown_block_1 is not clear. So we need to have a block on top of it at some point. Then, to satisfy the second constraint, which says that if brown_block_1 is not clear in some state, then there must have been an earlier state where either purple_block_3 is not on the table or grey_block_1 is not on the table.

In the initial state, purple_block_3 is on the table (since brown_block_1 is on top of it). So if we need to have a state where purple_block_3 is not on the table, we would have to move it. But moving purple_block_3 would require that it's clear. But in the initial state, brown_block_1 is on top of purple_block_3, so purple_block_3 is not clear. Therefore, we can't move purple_block_3 unless we first remove brown_block_1. But if we unstack brown_block_1, then purple_block_3 becomes clear, and we can move it. Wait, but after unstacking brown_block_1, we're holding it. Then we could put it down (so brown_block_1 is on the table, but that's the goal). But then, if we want to have a state where purple_block_3 is not on the table, we need to pick it up and stack it somewhere else. However, that would require that purple_block_3 is clear. After putting brown_block_1 down, purple_block_3 is clear. So we could then pick up purple_block_3 and stack it somewhere. But this would be an extra step. Alternatively, maybe we can stack another block on brown_block_1 after moving it to the table. Wait, but once brown_block_1 is on the table, we can stack another block on it. But then that would make brown_block_1 not clear, satisfying the first constraint. However, the goal is to have brown_block_1 on the table. So the final state requires brown_block_1 to be on the table, but during the plan, we can stack something on it and then remove it again. Let's see.

But perhaps a better approach is to first unstack brown_block_1, stack it somewhere else temporarily, then place it on the table. But that might not help with the constraints. Let's outline possible steps:

Original stack: purple_block_3 has brown_block_1.

Step 1: unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3. Now, arm holds brown_block_1, purple_block_3 is clear.

Now, to satisfy the first constraint, we need to have a state where brown_block_1 has a block on top. But brown_block_1 is currently being held. So perhaps stack it on another block, then unstack again.

But if we stack brown_block_1 onto another block, say, purple_block_3 again, but then we'd have to unstack it again to put it on the table. Alternatively, stack it on another block, like grey_block_1. But let's think.

Wait, but if we stack brown_block_1 onto a different block, that would make brown_block_1 not clear (since it's under something else). Wait, no. If we stack another block on top of brown_block_1, then brown_block_1 is not clear. So perhaps after putting brown_block_1 on the table, we can stack a block on top of it. But then, the final state requires brown_block_1 to be on the table, but if we stack something on it, we would have to unstack that block again to leave brown_block_1 clear. But that's extra steps.

Alternatively, perhaps stack brown_block_1 on another block, then unstack it and put it down. Let's see:

1. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → holding brown_block_1, purple_block_3 clear.

2. stack brown_block_1 onto, say, purple_block_3 → but that would just put it back. Alternatively, stack it on another block that's clear.

Wait, the blocks that are clear initially are purple_block_2, brown_block_1, white_block_1. Wait, no. Initial clear blocks are purple_block_2 (since it's on top of red_block_1), brown_block_1 (on top of purple_block_3), and white_block_1 (on top of grey_block_1). So other blocks: purple_block_1 has red_block_1 on top, which has purple_block_2. grey_block_1 has white_block_1. purple_block_3 has brown_block_1.

So after unstacking brown_block_1, purple_block_3 is clear. Then, perhaps stack brown_block_1 onto purple_block_3 again. Wait, but that's the same as before. Alternatively, stack brown_block_1 onto another block, like grey_block_1, but grey_block_1 has white_block_1 on top. So to stack on grey_block_1, we need to unstack white_block_1 first.

But that's more steps. Let's see:

If we proceed to stack brown_block_1 on grey_block_1, we need to first unstack white_block_1 from grey_block_1.

But perhaps the plan could be:

1. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → arm holds white_block_1, grey_block_1 clear.

2. stack white_block_1 somewhere else, maybe on purple_block_3 (which is clear after step 1? Wait, after step 1, purple_block_3 is still under brown_block_1. Wait no: original state is brown_block_1 on purple_block_3. To unstack brown_block_1, we need to do that first. Wait, perhaps I should adjust the order.

Alternatively, first unstack brown_block_1:

1. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → holding brown_block_1, purple_block_3 clear.

Now, to make brown_block_1 not clear, we can stack another block on top of it. But to do that, brown_block_1 needs to be on some block or table. So perhaps:

2. putdown brown_block_1 → brown_block_1 is on table, clear.

3. pickup some other block, say purple_block_3 (now clear), and stack it on brown_block_1.

But stacking purple_block_3 on brown_block_1 would require that brown_block_1 is clear, which it is after step 2. So:

3. pickup purple_block_3 → possible because it's on table and clear.

4. stack purple_block_3 brown_block_1 → now brown_block_1 has purple_block_3 on top, so brown_block_1 is not clear. This satisfies the first constraint (there's a state where brown_block_1 is not clear). Then, to get brown_block_1 back on the table, we need to unstack purple_block_3 from brown_block_1 and put it somewhere else.

But this seems complicated. Let's see if this satisfies the second constraint: if brown_block_1 is not clear (as in step 4), then there must be an earlier state where either purple_block_3 is not on the table or grey_block_1 is not on the table. In step 4, purple_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1, so it's not on the table. So the earlier state where purple_block_3 is not on the table is step 4. But the constraint requires that the earlier state (before step 4) must have either purple_block_3 not on table or grey_block_1 not on table. Wait, in step 3, after pickup purple_block_3, purple_block_3 is not on the table. So the state after step 3 (holding purple_block_3) has purple_block_3 not on the table, which is before step 4 where brown_block_1 is not clear. Therefore, the second constraint is satisfied because step 3's state has purple_block_3 not on the table, which is before step 4's state where brown_block_1 is not clear. So that works.

But this approach requires several steps. Let's count:

1. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3

2. putdown brown_block_1

3. pickup purple_block_3

4. stack purple_block_3 brown_block_1

5. unstack purple_block_3 brown_block_1

6. putdown purple_block_3

7. pickup brown_block_1

8. putdown brown_block_1 (but this is redundant since step 2 already put it down; maybe we can avoid this).

Wait, no. After step 4, brown_block_1 is under purple_block_3. So to get brown_block_1 back on the table, we need to unstack purple_block_3 from brown_block_1 (step5), put it down (step6), then pickup brown_block_1 (step7) and put it down again (step8). But that's a lot of steps. The optimal plan should be as short as possible. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, instead of putting brown_block_1 down and then stacking on it, perhaps stack it onto another block first. Let's think:

1. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → holding brown_block_1, purple_block_3 clear.

Now, to have brown_block_1 not clear, we can stack another block on it. But to stack on brown_block_1, it must be on some base. If we stack brown_block_1 onto another block, then another block can be stacked on top of it.

Wait, perhaps:

1. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → hold brown_block_1.

2. stack brown_block_1 onto, say, purple_block_1. But purple_block_1 currently has red_block_1 and purple_block_2 on top. So it's not clear. Therefore, we can't stack on purple_block_1. Alternatively, stack on grey_block_1. Grey_block_1 has white_block_1 on top. So we need to unstack white_block_1 first.

So:

1. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold white_block_1.

2. putdown white_block_1 → white_block_1 on table.

3. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → hold brown_block_1.

4. stack brown_block_1 grey_block_1 → now brown_block_1 is on grey_block_1, so it's not on the table. Then, to satisfy the goal, we need to put brown_block_1 on the table. But to do that, we need to unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1, then put it down.

But this approach also adds steps.

Alternatively, after step 1 (unstack brown_block_1), we could stack it on top of purple_block_2, which is clear. Let's see:

Initial stack: purple_block_1 (table) → red_block_1 → purple_block_2 (clear).

So:

1. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → hold brown_block_1.

2. stack brown_block_1 purple_block_2 → now brown_block_1 is on purple_block_2, so purple_block_2 is not clear. But then, to get brown_block_1 to the table, we need to unstack it from purple_block_2.

3. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_2 → hold brown_block_1.

4. putdown brown_block_1 → done.

This way, in step 2, brown_block_1 is on purple_block_2, so brown_block_1 is not clear. Then, when we unstack it, it's clear again. This satisfies the first constraint (there's a state where brown_block_1 is not clear). Also, the second constraint: when brown_block_1 is not clear (step2), we need to have an earlier state where purple_block_3 is not on the table or grey_block_1 is not on the table. In step1, after unstacking brown_block_1, purple_block_3 is on the table (since we took brown_block_1 off). Wait, no: after unstacking brown_block_1 from purple_block_3, purple_block_3 remains on the table. So in step2, when brown_block_1 is stacked on purple_block_2, the state where brown_block_1 is not clear (step2) requires that there was a previous state where either purple_block_3 is not on the table or grey_block_1 is not on the table. But up to step2, purple_block_3 is still on the table, and grey_block_1 is also on the table (since white_block_1 is on it initially, but we didn't move grey_block_1). So this doesn't satisfy the second constraint. Therefore, this approach doesn't work.

Hmm. So we need to have a state where brown_block_1 is not clear, and in an earlier state, either purple_block_3 is not on the table or grey_block_1 is not on the table.

So how can we make purple_block_3 not on the table? By moving it. But purple_block_3 is under brown_block_1 initially. So to move purple_block_3, we first need to unstack brown_block_1, then move purple_block_3. But after unstacking brown_block_1, purple_block_3 is clear and on the table. So we can pick it up.

So perhaps:

1. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → holding brown_block_1.

2. putdown brown_block_1 → brown_block_1 is on table (but this is the goal, but we need to first satisfy the constraints).

3. pickup purple_block_3 → now holding purple_block_3, which is not on the table.

4. stack purple_block_3 somewhere, say on grey_block_1. But grey_block_1 has white_block_1 on top. So we need to unstack white_block_1 first.

5. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold white_block_1.

6. stack white_block_1 purple_block_3 → now white_block_1 is on purple_block_3, which is held, but wait, you can't stack while holding purple_block_3. Wait, step4: after step3, we're holding purple_block_3. To stack purple_block_3 on grey_block_1, we need to do that in step4. But grey_block_1 has white_block_1 on top. So we need to unstack white_block_1 first.

So steps:

1. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → hold brown_block_1.

2. putdown brown_block_1 → brown_block_1 on table (but we need to make it not clear at some point).

Wait, this puts brown_block_1 on the table, which is the goal, but we need to first have a state where brown_block_1 is not clear. So this approach skips that. So this won't work.

Alternative plan:

1. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → hold brown_block_1.

2. stack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → now brown_block_1 is back on purple_block_3. But this doesn't help because we need to have brown_block_1 on the table. Also, this doesn't make brown_block_1 not clear; it's still on top.

Wait, no. Stacking brown_block_1 back on purple_block_3 would put brown_block_1 on top of purple_block_3 again, which is the initial state. So this doesn't achieve anything.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline the steps required to satisfy all constraints:

Constraints:

1. At least one state where brown_block_1 is not clear.

2. If brown_block_1 is not clear in state s, then an earlier state must have purple_block_3 not on table or grey_block_1 not on table.

3. At least one state where purple_block_1 is not clear. But initially, purple_block_1 is not clear (has red_block_1 on top). So this is already satisfied. But the fourth constraint says that in any state where purple_block_1 is not clear, the arm must hold white_block_1 in that state or a later one. Since the initial state has purple_block_1 not clear, we need to ensure that in the initial state or later, the arm holds white_block_1. But the arm starts empty. So at some point, we must pick up white_block_1.

So in the plan, we need to include picking up white_block_1.

Additionally, the sixth constraint is already satisfied as discussed.

So, the plan must include:

- Moving brown_block_1 to the table (goal).

- Temporarily placing a block on top of brown_block_1 to satisfy constraint1.

- Ensuring that when brown_block_1 is not clear, there was a previous state where purple_block_3 is not on the table or grey_block_1 is not on the table.

- Picking up white_block_1 at some point to satisfy the fourth constraint.

So let's try to integrate these.

One possible approach:

1. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → holding brown_block_1.

2. stack brown_block_1 onto grey_block_1 (which has white_block_1). But to do that, we need to unstack white_block_1 first.

So steps:

1. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → holding white_block_1. This satisfies the fourth constraint because after this step, the arm is holding white_block_1. Since purple_block_1 is not clear in the initial state, and we have to ensure that in some later state, the arm holds white_block_1. So step1 achieves that.

2. putdown white_block_1 → white_block_1 is on table. Now, grey_block_1 is clear.

3. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → holding brown_block_1.

4. stack brown_block_1 grey_block_1 → now brown_block_1 is on grey_block_1, making it not clear. This satisfies constraint1.

Now, the second constraint: when brown_block_1 is not clear (step4), there must be an earlier state where purple_block_3 is not on the table or grey_block_1 is not on the table. In step4, grey_block_1 has brown_block_1 on it, so grey_block_1 is not clear, but it's still on the table. So grey_block_1 is on the table. Purple_block_3 is on the table (since we only unstacked brown_block_1 from it). So neither condition is met. Therefore, this approach fails the second constraint.

So, to satisfy the second constraint, when brown_block_1 is not clear (step4), we need to have had a previous state where either purple_block_3 is not on the table or grey_block_1 is not on the table.

So perhaps during the plan, we need to move purple_block_3 or grey_block_1.

Let's think: after unstacking brown_block_1 from purple_block_3 (step3), purple_block_3 is on the table. So to have purple_block_3 not on the table, we need to pick it up and stack it somewhere else.

So:

1. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold white_block_1 (satisfies the fourth constraint later).

2. stack white_block_1 somewhere. Maybe on purple_block_3.

But purple_block_3 has brown_block_1 initially. Wait, no. After step1, brown_block_1 is still on purple_block_3. So:

Wait, the steps need to be ordered correctly. Let's try again:

Alternative plan:

1. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → hold brown_block_1. Purple_block_3 is clear and on table.

2. stack brown_block_1 on purple_block_3 → now brown_block_1 is back where it was. No progress.

Not helpful.

Another approach: move purple_block_3.

To move purple_block_3, we need to first unstack brown_block_1.

So:

1. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → hold brown_block_1.

2. putdown brown_block_1 → brown_block_1 on table.

3. pickup purple_block_3 → now holding purple_block_3.

4. stack purple_block_3 on some block. Let's say grey_block_1. But grey_block_1 has white_block_1 on top.

So need to unstack white_block_1 first.

5. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold white_block_1.

6. putdown white_block_1 → on table.

7. stack purple_block_3 grey_block_1 → now purple_block_3 is on grey_block_1, not on table. This makes purple_block_3 not on table.

Now, to satisfy constraint1, we need to have a block on brown_block_1. Since brown_block_1 is on the table, we can stack something on it.

8. pickup white_block_1 → hold white_block_1.

9. stack white_block_1 brown_block_1 → now brown_block_1 is not clear.

This satisfies constraint1. Then, to achieve the goal, we need to unstack white_block_1 and put brown_block_1 back on the table. But brown_block_1 is already on the table. Wait, no: after step2, brown_block_1 is on the table. Step9 stacks white_block_1 on it. Then, to achieve the goal, which is brown_block_1 on the table, we need to leave it there. But after step9, brown_block_1 is on the table with white_block_1 on top. So the final state would have brown_block_1 on the table but not clear. But the goal requires brown_block_1 to be on the table, which it is, but the problem doesn't specify that it needs to be clear. So the goal is achieved. However, we need to ensure that in the final state, brown_block_1 is on the table. But having white_block_1 on top is acceptable, but then the goal isn't met because the final state requires brown_block_1 to be on the table, but the problem statement doesn't mention its clear status. Wait, the goal is only "brown_block_1 is on the table". So even if there's a block on top, as long as brown_block_1 is on the table, the goal is satisfied. So in step9, brown_block_1 is on the table, so the goal is met. But we need to ensure that the final state has brown_block_1 on the table. However, in step9, brown_block_1 is on the table but has white_block_1 on top. So the goal is achieved. But the problem might require that in the final state, brown_block_1 is on the table and possibly clear. But the problem statement says: "The task is to bring about the following situation: 'brown_block_1 is on the table'". There's no mention of being clear. Therefore, the presence of white_block_1 on top is allowed. But if the goal requires brown_block_1 to be clear, then we need to remove white_block_1. But according to the problem statement, the goal is just to have brown_block_1 on the table, regardless of what's on top. So the final state can have blocks on top of brown_block_1 as long as it's on the table. So the plan up to step9 achieves the goal but leaves white_block_1 on top. However, the problem may require that brown_block_1 is on the table and clear. Wait, the problem says: "The task is to bring about the following situation: 'brown_block_1 is on the table'". The original state has brown_block_1 on purple_block_3, and the goal is to have it on the table. The problem doesn't specify that it must be clear. So in the final state, brown_block_1 can have blocks on top as long as it's on the table. But if that's the case, then step9 already satisfies the goal. However, the initial plan of 9 steps may not be optimal. Let's check constraints:

Constraint1 is satisfied in step9 (brown_block_1 not clear).

Constraint2: when brown_block_1 is not clear (step9), there must be an earlier state where purple_block_3 is not on the table or grey_block_1 is not on the table. In step7, we stacked purple_block_3 on grey_block_1, so purple_block_3 is not on the table in step7 and onward. Therefore, step7 is before step9, satisfying constraint2.

Constraint3: at least one state where purple_block_1 is not clear. The initial state satisfies this, so it's already met.

Constraint4: whenever purple_block_1 is not clear (which is always until it's clear), the arm must hold white_block_1 in that state or later. In step5, we unstack white_block_1, so the arm holds white_block_1. This satisfies the requirement for all states up to step5. After step5, when we putdown white_block_1, the arm is no longer holding it. But purple_block_1 is not clear in all states until we remove blocks from it. Wait, but in the initial state, purple_block_1 has red_block_1 and purple_block_2 on top. So until those are removed, purple_block_1 is not clear. So whenever the arm is not holding white_block_1 and purple_block_1 is not clear, we need to have the arm hold white_block_1 in some later state. Since in step5 we hold white_block_1, this satisfies the constraint for all states up to step5. After step5, if purple_block_1 is still not clear (which it is), then the arm must hold white_block_1 again. But in this plan, after step5, we putdown white_block_1 (step6), stack purple_block_3 (step7), pickup white_block_1 again (step8), and stack it (step9). So after step5, the arm holds white_block_1 again in step8. Therefore, for all states where purple_block_1 is not clear (which is all states unless we clear it), the arm holds white_block_1 in step5 and step8, satisfying the constraint.

But this seems to involve many steps. Is there a shorter way?

Alternative plan focusing on minimal steps:

Let's think:

To satisfy constraint1, we need to have a block on brown_block_1. Since brown_block_1 starts on purple_block_3, we could unstack it, put it on the table, then stack another block on top. But stacking requires the arm to hold the block to stack. So:

1. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → hold brown_block_1.

2. putdown brown_block_1 → now on table.

3. pickup purple_block_3 → now holding purple_block_3.

4. stack purple_block_3 brown_block_1 → now brown_block_1 has purple_block_3 on top, satisfying constraint1.

Then, to achieve the goal (brown_block_1 on table), we need to unstack purple_block_3 and put it down:

5. unstack purple_block_3 brown_block_1 → hold purple_block_3.

6. putdown purple_block_3.

Now, brown_block_1 is on the table and clear. But this plan has 6 steps.

But let's check the constraints:

Constraint1 is satisfied in step4.

Constraint2: in step4, brown_block_1 is not clear. We need to have an earlier state where purple_block_3 is not on table or grey_block_1 is not on table. In step3, after pickup purple_block_3, purple_block_3 is not on the table. This is before step4, so constraint2 is satisfied.

Constraint3: already satisfied by initial state.

Constraint4: whenever purple_block_1 is not clear, arm must hold white_block_1 in that state or later. In this plan, we never handle white_block_1, so this constraint is violated. Therefore, this plan is invalid.

Ah, right. We need to incorporate picking up white_block_1 at some point. So this plan is missing that step. Therefore, the earlier approach of moving white_block_1 is necessary.

So combining the steps:

1. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold white_block_1. This satisfies constraint4.

2. putdown white_block_1 → on table.

3. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → hold brown_block_1.

4. stack brown_block_1 grey_block_1 → now brown_block_1 is on grey_block_1 (which is on table), so brown_block_1 is not clear. This satisfies constraint1.

But in step4, brown_block_1 is on grey_block_1. grey_block_1 is on the table. So to satisfy constraint2, we need an earlier state where purple_block_3 is not on table or grey_block_1 is not on table. In step3, after unstacking brown_block_1, purple_block_3 is on the table. So no. grey_block_1 is on the table throughout. So this doesn't satisfy constraint2.

Therefore, this approach is invalid.

Alternative plan:

1. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → hold brown_block_1.

2. stack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → puts it back. No progress. Not useful.

Alternative plan:

1. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → hold brown_block_1.

2. putdown brown_block_1 → on table.

3. pickup purple_block_3 → hold.

4. stack purple_block_3 somewhere, like purple_block_1. But purple_block_1 has red_block_1 and purple_block_2. So no.

Alternatively, stack on grey_block_1:

3. stack purple_block_3 grey_block_1 → but grey_block_1 has white_block_1.

So need to unstack white_block_1 first.

4. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold white_block_1.

5. putdown white_block_1 → on table.

6. stack purple_block_3 grey_block_1 → now purple_block_3 is not on the table.

Now, step6 makes purple_block_3 not on the table. Then, we can stack something on brown_block_1 (which is on table):

7. pickup white_block_1 → hold.

8. stack white_block_1 brown_block_1 → brown_block_1 not clear. Satisfies constraint1.

Now, constraint2 is satisfied because in step8 (brown_block_1 not clear), there was an earlier step6 where purple_block_3 is not on the table.

Also, constraint4 is satisfied because in step4, we unstack white_block_1 (holding it), which covers the requirement from the initial state.

Then, to achieve the goal, brown_block_1 is on the table with white_block_1 on top, which is acceptable.

But this plan has 8 steps. Can we make it shorter?

Alternative steps:

1. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold white_block_1. (satisfies constraint4)

2. stack white_block_1 purple_block_3 → now white_block_1 is on purple_block_3, making purple_block_3 not clear.

But to stack white_block_1 on purple_block_3, purple_block_3 must be clear. Initially, purple_block_3 has brown_block_1 on top, so we can't stack on it until brown_block_1 is moved.

So:

1. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → hold brown_block_1.

2. putdown brown_block_1 → on table.

3. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold white_block_1. (satisfies constraint4)

4. stack white_block_1 purple_block_3 → now white_block_1 is on purple_block_3, making purple_block_3 not on the table (it's under white_block_1).

But wait, purple_block_3 is on the table in step2. Stacking white_block_1 on purple_block_3 would mean purple_block_3 is still on the table, but with white_block_1 on top. So purple_block_3 is on the table but not clear. So purple_block_3 is still on the table, just has white_block_1 on top. So in this case, purple_block_3 is on the table. Therefore, this doesn't make purple_block_3 not on the table. So this approach doesn't help with constraint2.

Hmm. So to make purple_block_3 not on the table, we need to move it to another block, such as stacking it on top of another block. For example:

After unstacking brown_block_1 and putting it down:

1. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → hold.

2. putdown brown_block_1 → on table.

3. pickup purple_block_3 → now holding.

4. stack purple_block_3 red_block_1 → but red_block_1 is under purple_block_2. So to stack on red_block_1, it must be clear. Currently, red_block_1 has purple_block_2 on top, so it's not clear. So we need to unstack purple_block_2 first.

This is getting too long. Maybe the optimal plan is the one with 8 steps as outlined earlier.

But let's think again. What's the minimal number of steps required?

Goal: move brown_block_1 to table.

Constraints:

- Must have a state where brown_block_1 is not clear. So we need to stack something on it after moving it to the table.

- Must have a state where purple_block_3 is not on the table (to satisfy constraint2 when brown_block_1 is not clear).

- Must pick up white_block_1 at some point to satisfy constraint4.

So steps:

1. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → hold.

2. putdown brown_block_1 → on table.

3. pickup purple_block_3 → now holding.

4. stack purple_block_3 somewhere, say on grey_block_1. But grey_block_1 has white_block_1.

5. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold white_block_1.

6. putdown white_block_1 → on table.

7. stack purple_block_3 grey_block_1 → now purple_block_3 not on table.

8. pickup white_block_1 → hold.

9. stack white_block_1 brown_block_1 → brown_block_1 not clear.

But this is 9 steps. However, after step9, brown_block_1 is on the table with white_block_1 on top, which satisfies the goal. But this is a long plan. Is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, perhaps after unstacking brown_block_1 and putting it down, we can stack purple_block_3 onto brown_block_1 immediately, but then we need to move purple_block_3 again.

Wait:

1. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → hold.

2. stack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → back to initial state. Not helpful.

No.

Alternative idea: Use white_block_1 to stack on brown_block_1.

1. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold. (satisfies constraint4)

2. stack white_block_1 brown_block_1 → but brown_block_1 is on purple_block_3. So need to unstack brown_block_1 first.

So:

1. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → hold.

2. stack white_block_1 brown_block_1 → but white_block_1 is still on grey_block_1. So need to first unstack white_block_1.

This approach:

1. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold.

2. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → hold.

But can't hold two blocks. So this is impossible.

So the order must be:

1. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold.

2. putdown white_block_1 → on table.

3. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → hold.

4. stack brown_block_1 grey_block_1 → now brown_block_1 is on grey_block_1, not clear.

This satisfies constraint1. Then, constraint2 requires that there's an earlier state where purple_block_3 not on table or grey_block_1 not on table. After step4, grey_block_1 has brown_block_1, so it's on the table. Purple_block_3 is still on the table. So this doesn't satisfy constraint2. Therefore, invalid.

Hmm. This is tricky. Let's try to find the minimal steps.

Another approach:

1. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold white_block_1. (satisfies constraint4)

2. stack white_block_1 purple_block_3 → requires purple_block_3 to be clear. But initially, purple_block_3 has brown_block_1. So need to first unstack brown_block_1.

So:

1. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → hold brown_block_1.

2. putdown brown_block_1 → on table.

3. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold white_block_1.

4. stack white_block_1 purple_block_3 → now purple_block_3 has white_block_1, so purple_block_3 is not on the table (wait, no. purple_block_3 is on the table, but with white_block_1 on top. So purple_block_3 is still on the table. So this doesn't make purple_block_3 not on the table.

Thus, this doesn't help with constraint2.

Alternative:

After unstacking brown_block_1, put it down, then pickup purple_block_3 and stack it on brown_block_1.

1. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → hold.

2. putdown brown_block_1 → on table.

3. pickup purple_block_3 → hold.

4. stack purple_block_3 brown_block_1 → now brown_block_1 has purple_block_3 on top, not clear (constraint1 satisfied).

Then, to satisfy constraint2, when brown_block_1 is not clear (step4), there must be an earlier state where purple_block_3 not on table or grey_block_1 not on table. In step3, after pickup purple_block_3, it's not on table. So step3 is before step4, satisfying constraint2.

Now, the goal is to have brown_block_1 on the table, which is already done. But purple_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1. So the final state has brown_block_1 on the table with purple_block_3 on top. The problem's goal is achieved. But then, the plan length is 4 steps. But what about constraint4?

In this plan, we never pick up white_block_1. So constraint4 is violated. Because in the initial state, purple_block_1 is not clear, and according to constraint4, whenever purple_block_1 is not clear, the arm must hold white_block_1 in that state or later. Since we never hold white_block_1 in this plan, it's invalid.

Thus, we must include picking up white_block_1.

So integrating that:

1. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold white_block_1. (satisfies constraint4)

2. putdown white_block_1 → on table.

3. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → hold brown_block_1.

4. putdown brown_block_1 → on table.

5. pickup purple_block_3 → hold.

6. stack purple_block_3 brown_block_1 → now brown_block_1 not clear.

Now, check constraints:

- constraint1: step6.

- constraint2: step6 (brown_block_1 not clear) requires an earlier state where purple_block_3 not on table or grey_block_1 not on table. In step5, purple_block_3 is picked up, so not on table. So step5 is before step6, satisfying constraint2.

- constraint3: already satisfied.

- constraint4: step1 holds white_block_1, satisfying the requirement.

- constraint5: already satisfied.

- constraint6: already satisfied.

This plan has 6 steps. Is this optimal?

Wait, steps:

1. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1

2. putdown white_block_1

3. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3

4. putdown brown_block_1

5. pickup purple_block_3

6. stack purple_block_3 brown_block_1

This achieves the goal of brown_block_1 on the table (step4), but then step6 stacks purple_block_3 on it, making it not clear. But the goal is to have brown_block_1 on the table, which is true in step4 and step6. But the final state is step6, which has brown_block_1 on the table with purple_block_3 on top. So the goal is achieved. However, the problem requires the final state to be brown_block_1 on the table. So this is acceptable.

But wait, in step6, brown_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_3 on top, so it's still on the table. Therefore, the goal is achieved. So this plan is valid, has 6 steps, and satisfies all constraints.

But the problem asks for an optimal plan with the minimal number of steps. Can we make it shorter?

Let's see:

Alternative steps:

1. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → hold brown_block_1.

2. stack brown_block_1 white_block_1 → but white_block_1 is on grey_block_1. Need to unstack white_block_1 first.

3. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold white_block_1. (satisfies constraint4)

4. stack white_block_1 brown_block_1 → now brown_block_1 is on white_block_1. But brown_block_1 is not on the table. So this doesn't achieve the goal.

Not helpful.

Another approach:

1. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold.

2. stack white_block_1 brown_block_1 → but brown_block_1 is on purple_block_3. So need to unstack brown_block_1 first.

So:

1. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → hold.

2. stack white_block_1 brown_block_1 → but white_block_1 is still on grey_block_1. So need to unstack white_block_1 first.

Not possible.

Another idea: unstack white_block_1 and use it to satisfy the constraint of being held.

1. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold.

2. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → hold.

But can't hold two blocks. So invalid.

Alternative steps:

1. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold.

2. putdown white_block_1 → on table.

3. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → hold.

4. stack brown_block_1 grey_block_1 → now brown_block_1 is on grey_block_1, not clear.

This satisfies constraint1. Then, to satisfy constraint2, we need an earlier state where purple_block_3 not on table or grey_block_1 not on table. But purple_block_3 is on table until step3. grey_block_1 is on table until step4. So no. Thus, invalid.

Hmm. It seems the 6-step plan is the shortest that satisfies all constraints. Let's check again:

Steps:

1. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold. (satisfies constraint4)

2. putdown white_block_1 → on table.

3. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → hold.

4. putdown brown_block_1 → on table. (goal achieved)

5. pickup purple_block_3 → hold.

6. stack purple_block_3 brown_block_1 → brown_block_1 not clear.

Final state: brown_block_1 on table with purple_block_3 on top. This satisfies the goal.

Constraints:

1. Step6: brown_block_1 not clear. ✓

2. Step6 requires an earlier state where purple_block_3 not on table. In step5, after pickup, purple_block_3 is not on table. ✓

3. Initial state: purple_block_1 not clear. ✓

4. Step1: holding white_block_1. ✓

5. Initial state: white_block_1 not on table. ✓

6. Initial state: white_block_1 not on table and brown_block_1 not on table. ✓

Thus, all constraints are satisfied. The plan has 6 steps. Is there a way to reduce this to 5 steps?

What if after putting down white_block_1, we pick up purple_block_3 and stack it on brown_block_1, which is still on purple_block_3. Wait, no. Let's try:

Alternative plan:

1. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold.

2. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → hold.

But can't hold two blocks. So invalid.

Another idea:

1. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → hold.

2. stack brown_block_1 white_block_1 → but white_block_1 is on grey_block_1. Need to unstack first.

3. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold.

4. stack white_block_1 brown_block_1 → now brown_block_1 is on white_block_1, which is on grey_block_1. So brown_block_1 is not on table. Goal not achieved.

No good.

Another approach: Combine steps.

After step3 (unstack brown_block_1), instead of putting it down, stack it on grey_block_1 which requires unstacking white_block_1 first.

But that would require:

1. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold.

2. putdown white_block_1 → on table.

3. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → hold.

4. stack brown_block_1 grey_block_1 → now brown_block_1 not clear. (constraint1)

Then, to achieve the goal, we need to move brown_block_1 to the table:

5. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold.

6. putdown brown_block_1 → goal achieved.

But this plan has 6 steps. Also, constraint2 requires that when brown_block_1 is not clear (step4), there's an earlier state where purple_block_3 not on table or grey_block_1 not on table. In step4, grey_block_1 has brown_block_1, so it's still on the table. purple_block_3 is on table after step3. So no. Thus, this approach fails constraint2.

Thus, the earlier 6-step plan seems to be the minimal.

But wait, in the 6-step plan, after step4, brown_block_1 is on the table. Then in step6, we stack purple_block_3 on it. So the final state has brown_block_1 on the table, which is the goal. Thus, the plan is valid.

But is there a way to stack purple_block_3 on brown_block_1 without putting brown_block_1 down first? Like:

1. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → hold.

2. stack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → back to initial state. No.

No.

Another idea: After unstacking brown_block_1, instead of putting it down, stack it on another block. But to do that, need to have a clear block. For example:

1. unstack white_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold. (step1)

2. putdown white_block_1 → step2.

3. unstack brown_block_1 purple_block_3 → hold. (step3)

4. stack brown_block_1 grey_block_1 → step4. Now brown_block_1 is on grey_block_1, not clear. (constraint1)

5. unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1 → step5.

6. putdown brown_block_1 → step6.

This plan also has 6 steps. But in step4, brown_block_1 is not clear. constraint2 requires that before step4, there's a state where purple_block_3 not on table or grey_block_1 not on table. purple_block_3 is on table until step3. grey_block_1 is on table until step4. So no. Thus, constraint2 not satisfied.

Thus, the only valid plan with minimal steps is the 6-step plan.
