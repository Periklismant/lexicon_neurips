Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld problem. The goal is to get the robotic arm holding the red_block_1. But there are several constraints to satisfy along the way. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, the initial state. Let's list out where each block is:

- white_block_1 is on the table, with red_block_1 on top of it. Since red_block_1 is clear, there's nothing on it.
- brown_block_1 is on the table and clear.
- yellow_block_1 is on the table, with blue_block_1 on top of it, and then brown_block_2 on top of blue_block_1. So the stack is yellow -> blue -> brown2. Both blue and brown2 are clear initially? Wait, no. The initial state says brown_block_2 is clear (since it's on top of blue_block_1 and nothing is on it). Blue_block_1 has brown_block_2 on it, so blue is not clear. Yellow_block_1 has blue on it, so yellow isn't clear. But the problem statement says "there is no block on top of brown_block_2, i.e., brown_block_2 is clear" which is correct. So blue_block_1 is not clear (has brown2 on it), yellow_block_1 is not clear (has blue on it). Grey_block_1 is on the table and clear.

The goal is to be holding red_block_1. So we need to get the red block from being on white_block_1 into the arm's grip.

Constraints to satisfy:

1. At some state, grey_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1. But in the initial state, grey_block_1 is on the table, so it's not on blue_block_1. Wait, the initial state already satisfies "grey_block_1 is not on top of blue_block_1". So maybe the first constraint is already met. But the problem says "must hold in at least one state", so perhaps we just need to make sure that in the plan, at some point this is true. Since initially it's true, maybe we just need to ensure that this condition isn't violated in all states. Wait, but the problem says "must hold in at least one state", so as long as it's true in any state of the plan, including the initial. So maybe that's already satisfied. But we need to check the other constraints.

But the second constraint says that if "grey not on blue" is true in some state s, then "yellow on blue" must be true in s or a later state. So if the initial state already has "grey not on blue", then in the plan, at some point after that, we need to have yellow on blue. Wait, but in the initial state, blue is on yellow. So the initial state has blue on yellow. So "yellow is on top of blue_block_1" is not true. Wait, yellow is under blue. So the constraint is that whenever grey is not on blue (which is true in the initial state), then in that state or a later one, yellow must be on blue. But that's impossible because blue is on yellow. So perhaps this constraint requires us to first move blue off yellow, then put yellow on blue. Hmm, that complicates things.

Third constraint: At some state, there's a block on top of grey_block_1 (grey is not clear). So we need to place something on grey_block_1.

Fourth constraint: At some state, red_block_1 is not clear (has a block on top). So we need to put something on red_block_1 and then possibly remove it.

Fifth constraint: If red_block_1 is not clear (which we need to make happen for the fourth constraint), then there must be an earlier state where either white_block_1 is on blue_block_1 or yellow_block_1 is clear. So before making red not clear, we need to have either white on blue or yellow clear.

Let's start by figuring out how to get red_block_1 into the hand. Since red is on white_block_1, which is on the table, and red is clear. So to pick it up, we can just do unstack red_block_1 white_block_1. Wait, but unstack's preconditions: block1 (red) is on block2 (white), red is clear, and the arm is empty. All true. So unstack red white. That would make the arm hold red, and white becomes clear. But that would immediately achieve the goal. But we have constraints to satisfy.

Wait, the goal is to have the arm holding red_block_1. So if we just do unstack red_block_1 white_block_1, that's the first action. Then the plan is done. But we have to check if all constraints are satisfied. However, the constraints require certain things to happen in the plan. Let's see.

Constraints:

1. The first constraint is that "grey_block_1 is not on blue_block_1" must hold in at least one state. As mentioned, in the initial state, this is true. So that's satisfied.

2. If in any state s where grey is not on blue, then in s or later, yellow must be on blue. But in the initial state, s0, grey is not on blue. So we must have in s0 or later that yellow is on blue. But in s0, blue is on yellow. So the initial state doesn't have yellow on blue. Therefore, after s0, we need to have a state where yellow is on blue. But how? Because blue is currently on yellow. To get yellow on blue, we need to move blue somewhere else, then stack yellow on blue. But that's complicated.

Wait, let's think. The second constraint is a conditional: whenever in a state s, grey is not on blue, then in s or a subsequent state, yellow is on blue. Since in the initial state, grey is not on blue (s0), then we must have that in s0 or later, yellow is on blue. But in s0, blue is on yellow. So the condition "yellow is on blue" is false. Therefore, we need to have, after s0, at some point, yellow is on blue.

But how can we do that? Let's consider that blue is currently on yellow. So we need to unstack blue from yellow. But blue has brown_block_2 on top. So first, we need to unstack brown2 from blue. Then unstack blue from yellow, then stack yellow on blue.

But doing all that would take steps. However, our main goal is to hold red_block_1. But if we just unstack red, then the plan ends. But the constraints are not satisfied. Because the second constraint requires that after s0, yellow must be on blue at some point. But in the initial plan where we just unstack red, the only states are s0 and s1 (after unstack). In s1, the arm is holding red. But the problem requires that in s0 or later, yellow must be on blue. Since in the initial plan, after s0, there's no action that puts yellow on blue, so that constraint is violated. Therefore, the plan can't just be unstack red. We need to do additional steps to satisfy the constraints.

So even though the goal is to hold red, the constraints require that certain conditions are met during the plan. Therefore, the minimal plan isn't just one action. We need to find a way to satisfy all constraints while achieving the goal.

Let me list all constraints again:

1. At least one state where grey_block_1 is not on blue_block_1. (Already satisfied in initial state.)

2. For every state where grey is not on blue, then in that state or a later one, yellow is on blue. Since the initial state is such a state, we need to have yellow on blue in the plan. So the plan must include a state where yellow is on blue.

3. At least one state where grey_block_1 has a block on top.

4. At least one state where red_block_1 is not clear (has a block on top).

5. Whenever red is not clear (which we need to make happen for constraint 4), then before that, there was a state where either white is on blue or yellow is clear.

So let's break this down.

First, to satisfy constraint 2, we need to have yellow on blue at some point. Initially, blue is on yellow. To get yellow on blue, we need to move blue off yellow, then place yellow on blue.

But to move blue, we need to first remove brown_block_2 from blue. So steps:

1. Unstack brown_block_2 from blue_block_1 (since brown2 is clear, arm is empty). After this, brown2 is held, blue becomes clear.

2. Putdown brown2 on table. Now blue is clear.

3. Unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1. Now arm holds blue.

4. Putdown blue somewhere, perhaps on table. Then stack yellow on blue. But blue is now on table. So stack yellow_block_1 blue_block_1. But yellow is on the table. Wait, no. Wait, after unstacking blue from yellow, yellow is on table and clear. Then we can stack yellow on blue if blue is clear. But if we put blue on table, then stack yellow on blue. So steps:

So after step 3 (arm holds blue), putdown blue on table. Then pickup yellow (since it's on table and clear). Then stack yellow on blue. That would satisfy the yellow on blue.

But this is a lot of steps. However, maybe there's a smarter way. Alternatively, after unstacking blue from yellow, could we stack yellow on blue immediately? Wait, blue is in the arm after unstacking. To stack yellow on blue, the arm needs to be holding yellow. So no. So steps would be:

After unstacking blue from yellow, put blue down, then pick up yellow, stack on blue. But that requires multiple steps.

But this seems necessary to satisfy constraint 2. Because after moving blue, we can then stack yellow on blue.

So let's outline possible steps:

- Unstack brown2 from blue (since brown2 is on blue, which is on yellow). So brown2 is clear. Then putdown brown2.

- Unstack blue from yellow. Now blue is in the arm. Putdown blue on table.

- Now yellow is clear. Pickup yellow, stack on blue. Now yellow is on blue.

So after these steps, yellow is on blue. Then perhaps proceed to handle the other constraints.

But we need to make sure that these steps are part of the plan. However, our main goal is to hold red_block_1. So how do these steps integrate with that?

Additionally, we need to satisfy constraint 3: at some point, grey has a block on top. So we need to place something on grey_block_1. Let's say we place brown2 on grey. Then, to do that, we need to pick up brown2 (which is on the table after being put down) and stack it on grey.

Constraint 4: red_block_1 must have a block on top at some point. So we need to place something on red. For example, after picking up red, maybe we put it down and stack something else on it. Wait, but the goal is to have the arm holding red. So maybe after we stack something on red, we unstack it again. But that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps after placing something on red_block_1, then unstack it to hold red again. Let's think.

Let's outline a possible plan:

1. Unstack brown_block_2 from blue_block_1. (Arm holds brown2, blue becomes clear.)

2. Putdown brown_block_2. (Brown2 on table, clear.)

3. Unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1. (Arm holds blue, yellow becomes clear.)

4. Stack blue_block_1 on grey_block_1. (Now blue is on grey, which satisfies constraint 3, since grey has a block on top. Also, blue is on grey, so grey is not clear. So constraint 3 is satisfied here.)

Wait, but stack requires that the target block (grey) is clear. Initially, grey is clear. So step 4 is possible: stack blue on grey. Then after this, grey has blue on top. So constraint 3 is met.

Then, after blue is on grey, we can proceed to stack yellow on blue. Wait, but blue is on grey. To stack yellow on blue, blue needs to be clear. So we need to unstack blue from grey? But that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe after putting blue on grey, we can stack another block on blue. Let's see.

But perhaps a better approach is to put blue on the table, then stack yellow on blue.

Wait, after step 3, we have the arm holding blue. We can put it down on the table (step 4: putdown blue), then step 5: pickup yellow (since yellow is clear now), step 6: stack yellow on blue (blue is on table and clear). Now yellow is on blue. This satisfies the second constraint, since at this point, yellow is on blue. So whenever grey is not on blue (which is true in the initial state and in all subsequent states except if we stack grey on blue), which we don't do, then we need to have yellow on blue. So after step 6, yellow is on blue. So that satisfies the second constraint.

Now, after step 6, we need to handle the other constraints.

Constraint 4 requires that red_block_1 is not clear at some point. So we need to put a block on red. Let's consider using brown_block_1, which is on the table and clear. So steps:

7. Pickup brown_block_1 (since it's on table and clear, arm is empty after step 6).

8. Stack brown_block_1 on red_block_1. Now red is not clear, satisfying constraint 4. But before doing this, we need to satisfy constraint 5: before red is not clear, there must be a state where either white is on blue or yellow is clear.

At this point, after step 6, yellow is on blue. So yellow is not clear. But we need to check if in any earlier state, either white is on blue or yellow is clear.

Looking back:

- After step 6, yellow is on blue. So yellow is not clear here.

- Before step 6, after step 5 (pickup yellow), yellow was being held. Before that, after step 4 (putdown blue), yellow was clear (since in step 3, we unstacked blue from yellow, leaving yellow clear). So between step 3 and step 5, yellow is clear.

So in step 4, after putting blue down, yellow is clear. So during that time, the state has yellow clear. Then step 5 picks up yellow, so it's no longer clear. So before step 8 (stacking brown1 on red), there was a state (after step 4) where yellow was clear. Therefore, constraint 5 is satisfied, because the condition (yellow is clear) was true in an earlier state than when red becomes not clear.

Therefore, proceeding:

7. Pickup brown_block_1.

8. Stack brown_block_1 on red_block_1. Now red is not clear (constraint 4 met).

But now, to get the arm to hold red_block_1, we need to unstack brown1 from red. So step 9: unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1. Then step 10: putdown brown1. Then step 11: unstack red_block_1 white_block_1. But that would take more steps. Alternatively, after stacking brown1 on red, we can unstack it immediately.

Wait, the goal is to have the arm holding red_block_1. So after step 8, red has brown1 on top. To get red, we need to first remove brown1. So steps:

9. Unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1. (Arm holds brown1, red becomes clear.)

10. Putdown brown_block_1. (Now arm is empty.)

11. Unstack red_block_1 white_block_1. (Arm holds red, which is the goal.)

But this adds steps. So total steps would be 11. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, let's see. Let's retrace the steps so far:

1. Unstack brown2 from blue.

2. Putdown brown2.

3. Unstack blue from yellow.

4. Putdown blue.

5. Pickup yellow.

6. Stack yellow on blue.

7. Pickup brown1.

8. Stack brown1 on red.

9. Unstack brown1 from red.

10. Putdown brown1.

11. Unstack red from white.

That's 11 steps. But perhaps some steps can be optimized.

Alternatively, after step 8 (stack brown1 on red), can we unstack it in a different way? For example, instead of putting down brown1, maybe stack it somewhere else. But the goal is to hold red, so eventually, we need to unstack red from white. But red is under brown1. So we need to remove brown1 first.

But perhaps there's a shorter path. Let's think again.

Another approach: after stacking brown1 on red (step 8), we can unstack brown1 and then proceed to pick up red. But that's necessary.

Alternatively, after stacking brown1 on red, can we directly pick up red? No, because red is under brown1. So we need to first remove brown1.

So steps 9-11 are necessary.

But this seems lengthy. Let me check the constraints again to make sure.

Constraints:

1. grey not on blue in at least one state: already true in initial state.

2. Whenever grey not on blue, yellow on blue in that state or later. After step 6, yellow is on blue, so all states from step 6 onwards satisfy that. So in the initial state (grey not on blue), the subsequent steps have yellow on blue, so the constraint is satisfied.

3. At least one state where grey has a block on top. Looking at the steps, after step 4, blue is on the table. Then in step 6, yellow is stacked on blue (on table). So grey is still clear. Wait, no. Wait, after step 3: unstack blue from yellow. Then step 4: putdown blue. Where? On the table. Then step 5: pickup yellow. Stack on blue (which is on table). So in step 6, yellow is on blue (on table). So grey_block_1 is still on the table and clear. Oh, wait, no. So step 4 is putdown blue on table. Then step 6 is stack yellow on blue (which is on table). So grey is still clear. So constraint 3 is not satisfied here. So this approach misses that.

Oh no! So in this plan, we haven't placed anything on grey_block_1. Therefore, constraint 3 is not satisfied. So we need to modify the plan to place a block on grey.

So back to the drawing board.

Alternative plan: After step 3 (unstack blue from yellow), instead of putting blue on table, stack it on grey_block_1. That way, grey has blue on top, satisfying constraint 3. Then proceed.

Let's outline this:

1. Unstack brown2 from blue.

2. Putdown brown2.

3. Unstack blue from yellow. (Arm holds blue.)

4. Stack blue on grey. (Now grey has blue on top, satisfying constraint 3. Also, blue is clear? No, because after stacking, the top block (blue) is clear. Wait, stack x y: after stacking x on y, x is clear, y is not. So after stacking blue on grey, blue is clear, grey is not. So grey has blue on top, which meets constraint 3.

Then, to get yellow on blue:

5. Pickup yellow (which is on table and clear after step 3).

6. Stack yellow on blue. (Now blue is on grey, and yellow is on blue. So blue is not clear (has yellow on top). But the stack requires that the target (blue) is clear. Wait, no. The stack action's precondition is that the target (y) is clear. So when we stack yellow on blue (step 6), blue must be clear. But after step 4, blue is on grey and is clear (since step 4's effect is that blue is clear). So yes, in step 6, blue is clear (on top of grey), so stacking yellow on blue is allowed.

After step 6, yellow is on blue (which is on grey). So now, the constraint 2 is satisfied because after step 6, whenever grey is not on blue (which is always true, since grey is under blue), we have yellow on blue. So that's okay.

Now, proceeding to handle the red_block_1 constraints.

Constraint 4: red must have a block on top at some point. So let's stack something on red. We have brown_block_1 on the table and clear. So:

7. Pickup brown_block_1.

8. Stack brown_block_1 on red_block_1. Now red is not clear (constraint 4 met).

But before this, we need to check constraint 5: before red is not clear, there must be a state where white is on blue or yellow is clear.

In this plan, after step 6, yellow is on blue (so not clear). Before step 6, after step 5 (pickup yellow), yellow was held, so before that, after step 4 (stack blue on grey), yellow was on table and clear (since step 3 unstacked blue from yellow, leaving yellow clear). So between steps 3 and 5, yellow was clear. So when we stack brown1 on red (step 8), the previous state where yellow was clear (steps 3-5) is before step 8. So constraint 5 is satisfied.

Then, to get red into the hand:

9. Unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1. (Arm holds brown1.)

10. Putdown brown_block_1.

11. Unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1. (Arm holds red, goal achieved.)

Now, let's count the steps: 11 actions.

But let's check if all constraints are met.

Constraint 1: grey not on blue in at least one state. Initially true, so okay.

Constraint 2: for any state where grey is not on blue, yellow must be on blue in that state or later. After step 6, yellow is on blue (which is on grey). So all states after step 6 have yellow on blue. Therefore, all states where grey is not on blue (all states) after step 6 have yellow on blue. So constraint 2 is satisfied.

Constraint 3: grey has a block on top. After step 4 (stack blue on grey), grey has blue on top. So satisfied.

Constraint 4: red has a block on top. After step 8, satisfied.

Constraint 5: before red has a block on top, there was a state where yellow was clear (steps 3-5). Yes.

So this plan seems to satisfy all constraints. Now, is there a shorter plan?

Alternatively, can we combine some steps? For example, after stacking blue on grey (step 4), then stacking yellow on blue (step 6), then perhaps using brown2 instead of brown1 to stack on red.

Let me think. After step 2, brown2 is on the table. So instead of using brown1, could we use brown2 to stack on red?

Yes. Let's adjust steps 7-8:

7. Pickup brown2 (on table and clear after step 2).

8. Stack brown2 on red_block_1. Then, unstack brown2 to get red.

This way, steps 7-10 become:

7. Pickup brown2.

8. Stack brown2 on red.

9. Unstack brown2 from red.

10. Putdown brown2.

11. Unstack red from white.

So steps are same count. Doesn't save steps, but maybe uses brown2 instead of brown1.

But regardless, the plan length is 11 steps. But is there a way to make it shorter?

Wait, let's think again. Is there a way to avoid some steps?

For example, after stacking yellow on blue (step 6), which is on grey, can we then unstack yellow from blue and use it elsewhere? Probably not helpful.

Alternatively, when we unstack brown2 from blue (step 1), perhaps put it directly on grey_block_1 instead of putting it down. Then, that would satisfy constraint 3 (grey has a block on top). Then we don't need to stack blue on grey.

Let me try that approach:

1. Unstack brown2 from blue. (Arm holds brown2.)

2. Stack brown2 on grey_block_1. (This satisfies constraint 3.)

Now, grey has brown2 on top.

Then, proceed to unstack blue from yellow.

3. Unstack blue from yellow. (Arm holds blue.)

4. Stack blue on table? Or stack on another block.

Wait, need to get yellow on blue. So after step 3, blue is in the arm. Then, put it down on the table (step 4: putdown blue).

5. Pickup yellow (now clear).

6. Stack yellow on blue (now on table). This satisfies constraint 2.

Then proceed to handle red_block_1.

7. Pickup brown1.

8. Stack brown1 on red.

9. Unstack brown1 from red.

10. Putdown brown1.

11. Unstack red from white.

But in this plan, after step 2, grey has brown2 on top (constraint 3 met). Then after step 6, yellow is on blue (constraint 2 met). Then steps for red.

But this plan has 11 steps as well. No shorter.

Alternatively, after step 2 (stack brown2 on grey), could we use brown2 later? Not sure.

But in this plan, step 2 is stack brown2 on grey. Then later, step 7: pickup brown1. So steps are same.

Is there a way to reduce steps by combining actions?

For example, after unstacking blue from yellow (step 3), instead of putting it down and then picking up yellow, perhaps stack blue on yellow again, but that doesn't help.

Alternatively, after unstacking blue, stack it on white_block_1, which has red on top. Wait, but white_block_1 has red on top. So to stack blue on white, we need white to be clear. But red is on white. So that's not possible unless we first remove red.

But the goal is to have red in the hand. So if we unstack red from white early, but then we need to put it down again to stack something else. That might complicate things.

Alternatively, let's consider another approach. What if we stack something on red first, then unstack it to get red.

But to stack on red, we need to have a block. Maybe brown1.

So steps:

1. Unstack brown2 from blue.

2. Putdown brown2.

3. Unstack blue from yellow.

4. Putdown blue.

5. Pickup yellow.

6. Stack yellow on blue.

7. Pickup brown1.

8. Stack brown1 on red.

9. Unstack brown1.

10. Putdown brown1.

11. Unstack red.

This is the same as before. So no improvement.

Alternatively, after step 6, can we use brown2 (which is on the table) to stack on red?

Yes:

7. Pickup brown2.

8. Stack brown2 on red.

9. Unstack brown2.

10. Putdown brown2.

11. Unstack red.

Same steps.

But the constraint for grey_block_1 to have a block on top. So if we stack brown2 on grey in step 2 instead of putting it down, then that's handled.

So let's outline that plan again:

1. Unstack brown2 from blue.

2. Stack brown2 on grey. (Now grey has brown2 on top, meeting constraint 3.)

3. Unstack blue from yellow.

4. Putdown blue.

5. Pickup yellow.

6. Stack yellow on blue. (Now yellow is on blue, meeting constraint 2.)

7. Pickup brown1.

8. Stack brown1 on red. (Now red is not clear, meeting constraint 4.)

9. Unstack brown1 from red.

10. Putdown brown1.

11. Unstack red from white. (Goal achieved.)

Yes, this plan has 11 steps and meets all constraints. Now, in this plan, the state after step 2 has grey_block_1 not on blue (since brown2 is on grey, and blue is still on yellow). Wait, no. In step 2, we stack brown2 on grey. Blue is still on yellow until step 3.

So during step 2, blue is on yellow. So grey is not on blue. So the condition in constraint 2 is triggered (grey not on blue), and we need yellow on blue in that state or later. After step 6, yellow is on blue. So yes.

So this plan should work.

But let's check all constraints again.

Constraint 1: grey not on blue in at least one state. The initial state satisfies this. So yes.

Constraint 2: for any state where grey is not on blue, yellow must be on blue in that state or later. The initial state has grey not on blue, and after step 6, yellow is on blue. So the initial state's condition is satisfied. All other states where grey is not on blue (which is always true) have yellow on blue after step 6. So yes.

Constraint 3: grey has a block on top after step 2. Yes.

Constraint 4: red has a block on top after step 8. Yes.

Constraint 5: before step 8 (stacking on red), there must be a state where white is on blue or yellow is clear. After step 3, blue is unstacked from yellow, so yellow is clear. Then steps 4-6 involve putting blue down and stacking yellow on it. So between step 3 and step 5, yellow is clear. So yes, there's a state (after step 3) where yellow is clear, which is before step 8. So constraint 5 is satisfied.

Therefore, this plan meets all constraints and achieves the goal in 11 steps. But is there a shorter plan?

Is there a way to reduce the number of steps? Let's think.

What if after stacking brown2 on grey (step 2), we proceed to handle red_block_1 first. For example:

But how? To hold red, we need to unstack it from white. But if we unstack red, then the arm holds red, which is the goal. But then we have to make sure the constraints are met. However, this would result in a shorter plan but failing constraints.

Alternatively, maybe after some steps, we can achieve the goal and meet constraints with fewer steps.

Let's consider if there's a way to satisfy all constraints with fewer actions.

For example, perhaps stack something on grey_block_1 early, then proceed.

But let's think: if we do unstack red_block_1 white_block_1 as the first action, the arm holds red, which is the goal. But the constraints:

- constraint 4 requires red to have a block on top at some state. But in this case, after unstacking red, red is in the arm, and white is clear. So no block is on red. So constraint 4 is not met. Therefore, this plan is invalid.

So we cannot do that.

Another approach: stack something on red, then unstack it to get red in hand. But to stack on red, we need to have a block. For example, stack brown_block_1 on red, then unstack it.

But to stack brown1 on red, red must be clear and on table. But red is on white_block_1. So first, we need to move red to the table. But that requires two steps: unstack red from white, putdown red. Then stack brown1 on red, then unstack brown1, then pickup red again. But this adds steps and may not help.

Alternatively, perhaps stack on red while it's on white. But red is on white, so to stack on red, we need to have a block that's clear. For example, brown_block_1 is on table and clear. So steps:

1. Pickup brown1.

2. Stack brown1 on red.

But wait, red is on white. To stack on red, red must be clear. Red is clear initially (since it's on top of white and nothing is on it). So step 1: unstack red from white. Then putdown red. Then pickup brown1, stack on red. Then unstack brown1, then pickup red. But this is longer than before.

Alternatively, stack brown1 on red while it's on white. But red is on white. To stack brown1 on red:

- Precondition: arm is holding brown1, and red is clear. So:

1. Unstack red from white. (Arm holds red.)

2. Putdown red. (Red is on table, clear.)

3. Pickup brown1. (Arm holds brown1.)

4. Stack brown1 on red. (Now red has brown1 on top.)

But now, to get red in hand:

5. Unstack brown1 from red. (Arm holds brown1.)

6. Putdown brown1.

7. Pickup red.

But this is 7 steps, but we also need to satisfy the other constraints. For example, constraint 2 requires yellow on blue, which isn't addressed here. So this approach doesn't work.

Therefore, the initial plan with 11 steps seems necessary.

Another thing to consider: after stacking yellow on blue (step 6 in the previous plan), can we use yellow or blue for other purposes? Probably not, since the goal is to hold red.

In conclusion, the optimal plan likely has 11 steps. Let's verify once more:

1. Unstack brown_block_2 from blue_block_1.

2. Stack brown_block_2 on grey_block_1. (grey has block, constraint 3 met.)

3. Unstack blue_block_1 from yellow_block_1.

4. Putdown blue_block_1.

5. Pickup yellow_block_1.

6. Stack yellow_block_1 on blue_block_1. (constraint 2 met.)

7. Pickup brown_block_1.

8. Stack brown_block_1 on red_block_1. (constraint 4 met.)

9. Unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1.

10. Putdown brown_block_1.

11. Unstack red_block_1 from white_block_1. (goal achieved.)

Yes, each step is valid, and all constraints are satisfied.

Now, let's check each action's preconditions:

1. Unstack brown2 from blue: brown2 is on blue, clear, arm empty. Valid.

2. Stack brown2 on grey: arm holds brown2, grey is clear. Initially, grey is clear. So yes.

3. Unstack blue from yellow: blue is on yellow, clear (after brown2 was removed), arm empty (after step 2, arm has brown2, then stack it in step 2, so arm is empty after step 2. Then unstack blue in step 3: yes.

Wait, after step 2, the arm is empty because stacking brown2 on grey causes the arm to release it. So step 3 is valid.

4. Putdown blue: arm holds blue. Valid.

5. Pickup yellow: yellow is on table, clear (since blue was unstacked), arm empty. Yes.

6. Stack yellow on blue: arm holds yellow, blue is clear (on table). Yes.

7. Pickup brown1: brown1 is on table, clear. Arm empty. Yes.

8. Stack brown1 on red: arm holds brown1, red is clear (since it's on white and clear). Yes.

9. Unstack brown1 from red: brown1 is on red, clear. Arm empty. Yes.

10. Putdown brown1: arm holds brown1. Yes.

11. Unstack red from white: red is on white, clear. Arm empty. Yes.

All steps are valid. All constraints are met. This should be the optimal plan with 11 steps. But wait, maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, can we avoid stacking brown2 on grey and instead use another block?

For example, after unstacking blue from yellow, stack blue on grey (step 3: unstack blue, then step 4: stack blue on grey). Then steps:

1. Unstack brown2 from blue.

2. Putdown brown2.

3. Unstack blue from yellow.

4. Stack blue on grey.

5. Pickup yellow.

6. Stack yellow on blue.

Then proceed as before. Steps 1-6:

1. Unstack brown2 from blue.

2. Putdown brown2.

3. Unstack blue from yellow.

4. Stack blue on grey.

5. Pickup yellow.

6. Stack yellow on blue.

Then steps for red:

7. Pickup brown1.

8. Stack brown1 on red.

9. Unstack brown1.

10. Putdown brown1.

11. Unstack red.

This also gives 11 steps. So same length.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 4 (stack blue on grey), can we use brown2 for something else? For example, stack brown2 on red.

But in this case, after step 2, brown2 is on the table. So:

After step 4, we have blue on grey. Then step 5: pickup yellow, stack on blue. Then, step 7: pickup brown2, stack on red. Then unstack brown2, etc. This would save steps by using brown2 instead of brown1. Let's see:

Steps:

1. Unstack brown2 from blue.

2. Putdown brown2.

3. Unstack blue from yellow.

4. Stack blue on grey.

5. Pickup yellow.

6. Stack yellow on blue.

7. Pickup brown2.

8. Stack brown2 on red.

9. Unstack brown2 from red.

10. Putdown brown2.

11. Unstack red from white.

This is also 11 steps, same length. So no improvement.

Therefore, the optimal plan is 11 steps. But wait, perhaps there's a way to merge steps.

Wait, after step 2 (putdown brown2), step 3 (unstack blue), step 4 (stack blue on grey), step 5 (pickup yellow), step 6 (stack yellow on blue), step 7 (pickup brown1), step 8 (stack on red), step 9 (unstack), step 10 (putdown), step 11 (unstack red). All steps are necessary.

Alternatively, after step 8 (stack brown1 on red), can we directly unstack red from white? No, because red has brown1 on top. So steps 9 and 10 are necessary to remove brown1.

So it seems there's no shorter way. Therefore, the plan with 11 steps is optimal.
