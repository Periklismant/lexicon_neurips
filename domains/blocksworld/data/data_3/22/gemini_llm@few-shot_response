Okay, let's break this down. We need to pick up green_block_1, but there are blocks on top of it. We also have some constraints to satisfy along the way. Here's the plan:

1.  **Clear the blocks above green_block_1:** We need to remove black_block_1 and grey_block_2 from the top of green_block_1.
2.  **Satisfy the constraint about orange_block_1 and black_block_2:** We need to hold orange_block_1 at some point, and at that point, black_block_2 must have a block on top of it.
3.  **Satisfy the constraint about black_block_1:** We need to ensure that black_block_1 has a block on top of it at some point. Also, before that happens, either brown_block_1 must be on the table or grey_block_1 must not be on the table.
4.  **Pick up green_block_1:** Once the path is clear, we can pick up green_block_1.
5.  **Ensure black_block_1 is never on the table:** This is a global constraint.

Here's the plan:

```
```
unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2
putdown black_block_1
unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1
putdown grey_block_2
unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
pickup brown_block_1
stack brown_block_1 black_block_2
unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1
pickup orange_block_1
stack orange_block_1 black_block_1
pickup green_block_1
```
