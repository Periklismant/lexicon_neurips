Let's analyze this Blocksworld problem step by step.

First, let's understand the initial state:
- green_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
- black_block_2 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- black_block_1 is clear
- black_block_2 is clear
- brown_block_1 is clear
- Arm is empty

The goal is:
- Arm is holding green_block_1

The constraints are:
1. At some point, arm should be holding orange_block_1 AND black_block_2 should not be clear (i.e., have something on top of it)
2. At some point, black_block_1 should not be clear (i.e., have something on top of it)
3. If black_block_1 is not clear at some point, then at an earlier state either brown_block_1 is on the table OR grey_block_1 is not on the table
4. black_block_1 should never be on the table

Now, let's think about how to reach the goal while satisfying the constraints.

To hold green_block_1, we need to clear everything above it. Currently, it has:
- grey_block_2 on top, which has
  - black_block_1 on top

To achieve the goal, we need to remove these blocks. Let's think about how to do this while satisfying the constraints.

Constraint 4 says black_block_1 should never be on the table. So when we unstack it, we must either hold it or immediately stack it on something else.

Constraint 1 requires that at some point we're holding orange_block_1 AND something is on black_block_2. We can satisfy this by unstacking brown_block_1 from orange_block_1, putting it on black_block_2, and then picking up orange_block_1.

Constraint 2 requires that at some point, black_block_1 should not be clear. Currently it is clear, so we need to put something on it.

Constraint 3 says that if black_block_1 is not clear, then at an earlier state either brown_block_1 should be on the table OR grey_block_1 should not be on the table. Since grey_block_1 starts on the table, we need to make sure it's not there before making black_block_1 not clear, OR we need to put brown_block_1 on the table at some point.

Let's start planning:

1. First, let's satisfy Constraint 1. We need to hold orange_block_1 and have something on black_block_2.
   - unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1
   - stack brown_block_1 on black_block_2 (this makes black_block_2 not clear)
   - unstack orange_block_1 from grey_block_1 (now we're holding orange_block_1 and black_block_2 is not clear)

2. We need to put orange_block_1 somewhere. Let's try to satisfy Constraint 2 by stacking it on black_block_1.
   - stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1 (this makes black_block_1 not clear)

But this violates Constraint 3 because neither brown_block_1 is on the table, nor grey_block_1 is not on the table at this point.

Let's revise:

1. First, let's make sure either brown_block_1 is on the table or grey_block_1 is not on the table.
   - unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1
   - putdown brown_block_1 (now it's on the table)

2. Now we can stack something on black_block_1 to satisfy Constraint 2.
   - unstack orange_block_1 from grey_block_1
   - stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1 (now black_block_1 is not clear)

3. To satisfy Constraint 1, we need to hold orange_block_1 and have something on black_block_2.
   - unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_1
   - pickup brown_block_1
   - stack brown_block_1 on black_block_2 (now black_block_2 is not clear)
   - pickup orange_block_1 (now we're holding orange_block_1 and black_block_2 is not clear)

4. Now we need to continue towards our goal.
   - putdown orange_block_1
   - unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_2
   - stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1 (to satisfy Constraint 4, black_block_1 should not be on the table)
   - unstack grey_block_2 from green_block_1
   - putdown grey_block_2
   - pickup green_block_1 (goal achieved)

Let me check this plan against the constraints:

Constraint 1: At some point, arm should be holding orange_block_1 AND black_block_2 should not be clear.
- After we stack brown_block_1 on black_block_2 and then pickup orange_block_1, we satisfy this.

Constraint 2: At some point, black_block_1 should not be clear.
- After we stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1, we satisfy this.

Constraint 3: If black_block_1 is not clear at some point, then at an earlier state either brown_block_1 is on the table OR grey_block_1 is not on the table.
- Before stacking orange_block_1 on black_block_1, we put brown_block_1 on the table, so this is satisfied.

Constraint 4: black_block_1 should never be on the table.
- In the plan, black_block_1 is never placed on the table, so this is satisfied.

Let me check if our plan actually works within the rules of the domain.

Let's review the initial state:
- green_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
- orange_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
- black_block_2 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- black_block_1 is clear
- black_block_2 is clear
- brown_block_1 is clear
- Arm is empty

Actually, let's pause and reconsider. I think I might have messed up some preconditions. Let's think again step by step, and make sure we're maintaining a valid state throughout the plan.

Initial state:
- (on-table green_block_1)
- (on-table grey_block_1)
- (on grey_block_2 green_block_1)
- (on orange_block_1 grey_block_1)
- (on black_block_1 grey_block_2)
- (on-table black_block_2)
- (on brown_block_1 orange_block_1)
- (clear black_block_1)
- (clear black_block_2)
- (clear brown_block_1)
- (arm-empty)

Interestingly, to achieve the goal of holding green_block_1, we need to move black_block_1 and grey_block_2, since they are above green_block_1.

1. First, we need to unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1:
   - unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
   State: (holding brown_block_1), (clear orange_block_1)

2. Now, let's put brown_block_1 on the table to satisfy Constraint 3 for later:
   - putdown brown_block_1
   State: (on-table brown_block_1), (clear brown_block_1), (arm-empty)

3. Now, unstack orange_block_1 from grey_block_1:
   - unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1
   State: (holding orange_block_1), (clear grey_block_1)

4. Let's stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1 to satisfy Constraint 2:
   - stack orange_block_1 black_block_1
   State: (on orange_block_1 black_block_1), (clear orange_block_1), (arm-empty)

5. We need to satisfy Constraint 1 (holding orange_block_1 and black_block_2 not clear). Let's first unstack orange_block_1:
   - unstack orange_block_1 black_block_1
   State: (holding orange_block_1), (clear black_block_1)

6. Let's pick up brown_block_1 and stack it on black_block_2:
   - putdown orange_block_1
   State: (on-table orange_block_1), (clear orange_block_1), (arm-empty)

   - pickup brown_block_1
   State: (holding brown_block_1)

   - stack brown_block_1 black_block_2
   State: (on brown_block_1 black_block_2), (clear brown_block_1), (arm-empty)

7. Now, let's pick up orange_block_1 to satisfy Constraint 1:
   - pickup orange_block_1
   State: (holding orange_block_1), (on brown_block_1 black_block_2) (i.e., black_block_2 is not clear)

   At this point, we've satisfied Constraint 1.

8. We need to continue towards our goal of holding green_block_1. Let's put orange_block_1 down:
   - putdown orange_block_1
   State: (on-table orange_block_1), (clear orange_block_1), (arm-empty)

9. Now, let's unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_2:
   - unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2
   State: (holding black_block_1), (clear grey_block_2)

10. We need to stack black_block_1 somewhere (not on the table due to Constraint 4). Let's put it on brown_block_1:
    - stack black_block_1 brown_block_1
    State: (on black_block_1 brown_block_1), (clear black_block_1), (arm-empty)

11. Now, let's unstack grey_block_2 from green_block_1:
    - unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1
    State: (holding grey_block_2), (clear green_block_1)

12. Let's put grey_block_2 down:
    - putdown grey_block_2
    State: (on-table grey_block_2), (clear grey_block_2), (arm-empty)

13. Finally, let's pick up green_block_1:
    - pickup green_block_1
    State: (holding green_block_1)

That's our goal! Let's check if we fulfilled all the constraints:

Constraint 1: At some point, arm should be holding orange_block_1 AND black_block_2 should not be clear.
- After step 7, we are holding orange_block_1 and black_block_2 has brown_block_1 on top of it, so this is satisfied.

Constraint 2: At some point, black_block_1 should not be clear.
- After step 4, black_block_1 has orange_block_1 on top of it, so this is satisfied.

Constraint 3: If black_block_1 is not clear at some point, then at an earlier state either brown_block_1 is on the table OR grey_block_1 is not on the table.
- Before step 4, after step 2, brown_block_1 is on the table, so this is satisfied.

Constraint 4: black_block_1 should never be on the table.
- In the plan, black_block_1 is never placed on the table, so this is satisfied.

Actually wait, I can optimize this plan further. Step 5 and 6 can be simplified; there's no need to unstack orange_block_1 if we want to satisfy Constraint 1. Let's revise the plan:

1. First, we need to unstack brown_block_1 from orange_block_1:
   - unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
   State: (holding brown_block_1), (clear orange_block_1)

2. Now, let's put brown_block_1 on the table to satisfy Constraint 3 for later:
   - putdown brown_block_1
   State: (on-table brown_block_1), (clear brown_block_1), (arm-empty)

3. Now, unstack orange_block_1 from grey_block_1:
   - unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1
   State: (holding orange_block_1), (clear grey_block_1)

4. Let's pick up brown_block_1 and stack it on black_block_2 to satisfy Constraint 1:
   - putdown orange_block_1
   State: (on-table orange_block_1), (clear orange_block_1), (arm-empty)

   - pickup brown_block_1
   State: (holding brown_block_1)

   - stack brown_block_1 black_block_2
   State: (on brown_block_1 black_block_2), (clear brown_block_1), (arm-empty)

   - pickup orange_block_1
   State: (holding orange_block_1), (on brown_block_1 black_block_2) (i.e., black_block_2 is not clear)

   At this point, we've satisfied Constraint 1.

5. Let's stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1 to satisfy Constraint 2:
   - stack orange_block_1 black_block_1
   State: (on orange_block_1 black_block_1), (clear orange_block_1), (arm-empty)

   At this point, we've satisfied Constraint 2.

6. Now, let's unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_1:
   - unstack orange_block_1 black_block_1
   State: (holding orange_block_1), (clear black_block_1)

7. Let's put orange_block_1 down:
   - putdown orange_block_1
   State: (on-table orange_block_1), (clear orange_block_1), (arm-empty)

8. Now, let's unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_2:
   - unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2
   State: (holding black_block_1), (clear grey_block_2)

9. We need to stack black_block_1 somewhere (not on the table due to Constraint 4). Let's put it on brown_block_1:
   - stack black_block_1 brown_block_1
   State: (on black_block_1 brown_block_1), (clear black_block_1), (arm-empty)

10. Now, let's unstack grey_block_2 from green_block_1:
    - unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1
    State: (holding grey_block_2), (clear green_block_1)

11. Let's put grey_block_2 down:
    - putdown grey_block_2
    State: (on-table grey_block_2), (clear grey_block_2), (arm-empty)

12. Finally, let's pick up green_block_1:
    - pickup green_block_1
    State: (holding green_block_1)

This revision seems to still satisfy all constraints and reaches the goal. Let me check once more.

Wait, that's not optimal. Let's rethink this.

Actually, I should check if Constraint 3 allows us to put orange_block_1 on black_block_1 in step 5, given the state at that time.

Constraint 3 says:
"If 'there is a block on top of black_block_1' holds, then there must be an earlier state where either brown_block_1 is on the table or grey_block_1 is not on the table."

Let's check the state right before step 5:
- orange_block_1 is being held
- brown_block_1 is on black_block_2
- grey_block_1 is on the table (it started there and we've not moved it)
- brown_block_1 is not on the table (it's on black_block_2)

So, we need to make sure that at an earlier state, either brown_block_1 is on the table or grey_block_1 is not on the table.

In step 2, we put brown_block_1 on the table. So, constraint 3 is satisfied.

Alright, let me double-check the plan:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1
4. putdown orange_block_1
5. pickup brown_block_1
6. stack brown_block_1 black_block_2
7. pickup orange_block_1 (At this point, we're holding orange_block_1 and black_block_2 is not clear, satisfying Constraint 1)
8. stack orange_block_1 black_block_1 (At this point, black_block_1 is not clear, satisfying Constraint 2)
9. unstack orange_block_1 black_block_1
10. putdown orange_block_1
11. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2
12. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1
13. unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1
14. putdown grey_block_2
15. pickup green_block_1

As for the four constraints:
1. At step 7, we're holding orange_block_1 and black_block_2 is not clear (has brown_block_1 on it).
2. At step 8, black_block_1 is not clear (has orange_block_1 on it).
3. Before step 8, at step 2, brown_block_1 was on the table, so this is satisfied.
4. Throughout the plan, black_block_1 is never placed on the table.

This seems to work. But I think I can further optimize.

Actually, let's just check that this plan is correct by working through the full state of the world at each step.

1. The initial state is:
   - green_block_1 is on the table
   - grey_block_1 is on the table
   - grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
   - orange_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
   - black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
   - black_block_2 is on the table
   - brown_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
   - black_block_1 is clear
   - black_block_2 is clear
   - brown_block_1 is clear
   - Arm is empty

   - grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
   - orange_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
   - black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
   - black_block_2 is on the table
   - Arm is holding brown_block_1

   - grey_block_1 is on the table
   - grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
   - orange_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
   - black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
   - black_block_2 is on the table
   - brown_block_1 is on the table
   - black_block_1 is clear
   - black_block_2 is clear
   - orange_block_1 is clear
   - brown_block_1 is clear
   - Arm is empty

4. unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1:

   - Arm is holding orange_block_1
   - black_block_1 is clear
   - black_block_2 is clear
   - brown_block_1 is clear
   - grey_block_1 is clear

5. putdown orange_block_1:
   - green_block_1 is on the table
   - grey_block_1 is on the table
   - grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
   - black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
   - black_block_2 is on the table
   - brown_block_1 is on the table
   - orange_block_1 is on the table
   - black_block_1 is clear
   - black_block_2 is clear
   - brown_block_1 is clear
   - grey_block_1 is clear
   - orange_block_1 is clear
   - Arm is empty

6. pickup brown_block_1:
   - green_block_1 is on the table
   - grey_block_1 is on the table
   - grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
   - black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
   - black_block_2 is on the table
   - orange_block_1 is on the table
   - Arm is holding brown_block_1
   - black_block_1 is clear
   - black_block_2 is clear
   - grey_block_1 is clear
   - orange_block_1 is clear

7. stack brown_block_1 black_block_2:
   - green_block_1 is on the table
   - grey_block_1 is on the table
   - grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
   - black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
   - black_block_2 is on the table
   - orange_block_1 is on the table
   - brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_2
   - black_block_1 is clear
   - brown_block_1 is clear
   - grey_block_1 is clear
   - orange_block_1 is clear
   - Arm is empty

8. pickup orange_block_1:

   - Arm is holding orange_block_1
   - black_block_1 is clear
   - brown_block_1 is clear
   - grey_block_1 is clear

   At this point, we're holding orange_block_1 and black_block_2 is not clear (because it has brown_block_1 on top), so Constraint 1 is satisfied.

9. stack orange_block_1 black_block_1:
   - green_block_1 is on the table
   - grey_block_1 is on the table
   - grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1

   - orange_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
   - orange_block_1 is clear
   - brown_block_1 is clear
   - grey_block_1 is clear
   - Arm is empty

   At this point, black_block_1 is not clear (because it has orange_block_1 on top), so Constraint 2 is satisfied. Additionally, at an earlier state (step 3), brown_block_1 was on the table, so Constraint 3 is satisfied.

10. unstack orange_block_1 black_block_1:
    - green_block_1 is on the table
    - grey_block_1 is on the table
    - grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
    - black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
    - black_block_2 is on the table

    - black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
    - black_block_2 is on the table
    - brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_2
    - orange_block_1 is on the table
    - black_block_1 is clear
    - brown_block_1 is clear
    - grey_block_1 is clear
    - orange_block_1 is clear
    - Arm is empty

12. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2:
    - green_block_1 is on the table
    - grey_block_1 is on the table
    - grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
    - black_block_2 is on the table
    - brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_2
    - orange_block_1 is on the table
    - Arm is holding black_block_1
    - grey_block_2 is clear
    - brown_block_1 is clear
    - grey_block_1 is clear
    - orange_block_1 is clear

13. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1:
    - green_block_1 is on the table
    - grey_block_1 is on the table
    - grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
    - black_block_2 is on the table
    - brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_2
    - orange_block_1 is on the table
    - black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
    - grey_block_2 is clear
    - black_block_1 is clear
    - grey_block_1 is clear
    - orange_block_1 is clear
    - Arm is empty

14. unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1:
    - green_block_1 is on the table
    - grey_block_1 is on the table
    - black_block_2 is on the table
    - brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_2
    - orange_block_1 is on the table
    - black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
    - Arm is holding grey_block_2
    - green_block_1 is clear
    - black_block_1 is clear
    - grey_block_1 is clear
    - orange_block_1 is clear

15. putdown grey_block_2:
    - green_block_1 is on the table
    - grey_block_1 is on the table
    - black_block_2 is on the table
    - brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_2
    - orange_block_1 is on the table
    - black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
    - grey_block_2 is on the table
    - green_block_1 is clear
    - black_block_1 is clear
    - grey_block_1 is clear
    - orange_block_1 is clear
    - grey_block_2 is clear
    - Arm is empty

16. pickup green_block_1:
    - grey_block_1 is on the table
    - black_block_2 is on the table
    - brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_2
    - orange_block_1 is on the table
    - black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
    - grey_block_2 is on the table
    - Arm is holding green_block_1
    - black_block_1 is clear
    - grey_block_1 is clear
    - orange_block_1 is clear
    - grey_block_2 is clear

This reaches our goal, and throughout the entire plan, black_block_1 is never on the table, so Constraint 4 is satisfied.

Let me attempt to further optimize the plan.

Actually, instead of unstacking and then re-stacking orange_block_1, maybe I can avoid this step. Let's see:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1
4. pickup brown_block_1
5. stack brown_block_1 black_block_2
6. putdown orange_block_1 (Constraint 3 is satisfied because brown_block_1 has been on the table at an earlier state)
7. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2
8. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1
9. pickup orange_block_1 (At this point, we're holding orange_block_1 and black_block_2 is not clear, satisfying Constraint 1)
10. putdown orange_block_1 (we need to put it down or stack it somewhere to proceed)
11. unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1
12. putdown grey_block_2
13. pickup green_block_1

Hmm, actually, I think we also need to satisfy Constraint 2, so we probably need to stack something on black_block_1 at some point. Let's revise:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1
4. pickup brown_block_1
5. stack brown_block_1 black_block_2
6. stack orange_block_1 black_block_1 (This satisfies Constraint 2. Also, Constraint 3 is satisfied because brown_block_1 has been on the table at an earlier state)
7. unstack orange_block_1 black_block_1
8. putdown orange_block_1
9. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2
10. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1
11. pickup orange_block_1 (At this point, we're holding orange_block_1 and black_block_2 is not clear, satisfying Constraint 1)
12. putdown orange_block_1
13. unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1
14. putdown grey_block_2
15. pickup green_block_1

Wait, actually steps 3-4 can be simplified, since after unstacking orange_block_1, we can immediately pick up brown_block_1, and steps 7-8 can be simplified since after unstacking orange_block_1, we can immediately unstack black_block_1. Let's try again:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1
4. stack orange_block_1 black_block_1 (This satisfies Constraint 2. Also, Constraint 3 is satisfied because brown_block_1 has been on the table at an earlier state)
5. pickup brown_block_1
6. stack brown_block_1 black_block_2
7. unstack orange_block_1 black_block_1
8. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2
9. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1
10. pickup orange_block_1 (At this point, we're holding orange_block_1 and black_block_2 is not clear, satisfying Constraint 1)
11. putdown orange_block_1
12. unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1
13. putdown grey_block_2
14. pickup green_block_1

Actually wait, we can't do it this way because after step 3, the arm is holding orange_block_1, so we can't immediately pick up brown_block_1 in step 5. Let's revise again, and be very careful about the state of the arm:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1
4. stack orange_block_1 black_block_1 (This satisfies Constraint 2. Constraint 3 is already satisfied because in step 2, brown_block_1 was on the table)
5. pickup brown_block_1
6. stack brown_block_1 black_block_2
7. unstack orange_block_1 black_block_1
8. putdown orange_block_1
9. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2
10. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1
11. pickup orange_block_1 (At this point, we're holding orange_block_1 and black_block_2 is not clear, satisfying Constraint 1)
12. putdown orange_block_1
13. unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1
14. putdown grey_block_2
15. pickup green_block_1

This seems correct. But I still think there's room for optimization. Let's see if there's a shorter plan.

Hmm, do we really need to put orange_block_1 on black_block_1 and then remove it again? Or can we find a shorter plan? Let's think logically about what we need to do:

1. To reach the goal, we need to move grey_block_2 and black_block_1 off of green_block_1.
2. We need to satisfy the 4 constraints at some point.

Let me work backwards: To achieve the goal, our final steps will be:
- unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1
- putdown grey_block_2 (or stack it somewhere, but putting it down seems simpler)
- pickup green_block_1

Before that, we need to unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_2.

The constraint that black_block_1 should never be on the table means that after unstacking it, we must stack it somewhere else.

Constraint 1 says at some point, we must be holding orange_block_1 and black_block_2 should not be clear. To make black_block_2 not clear, we need to stack something on it. This stacking must happen before holding orange_block_1 to ensure both conditions are met simultaneously.

Constraint 2 says at some point, black_block_1 should not be clear.

Constraint 3 says if black_block_1 is not clear, there must be an earlier state where either brown_block_1 is on the table or grey_block_1 is not on the table.

So, to minimize steps, we can:
1. Put brown_block_1 on the table.
2. Make black_block_1 not clear at some point (to satisfy Constraint 2).
3. Stack something on black_block_2 and then pick up orange_block_1 (to satisfy Constraint 1).

Given all these considerations, here's a possible optimized plan:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1 (This ensures brown_block_1 is on the table, which will be needed for Constraint 3)
3. unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1
4. stack orange_block_1 black_block_1 (This satisfies Constraint 2. Constraint 3 is already satisfied because in step 2, brown_block_1 was on the table)
5. pickup brown_block_1
6. stack brown_block_1 black_block_2
7. unstack orange_block_1 black_block_1
8. pickup black_block_1 (As per Constraint 4, black_block_1 should never be on the table, so we need to immediately move it after clearing it)
9. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1
10. pickup orange_block_1 (At this point, we're holding orange_block_1 and black_block_2 is not clear, satisfying Constraint 1)
11. putdown orange_block_1
12. unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1
13. putdown grey_block_2
14. pickup green_block_1

Hmm, in step 8, I made a mistake. After unstacking orange_block_1 from black_block_1, the arm is not empty. It's holding orange_block_1. Let's revise again:

Wait, I misunderstood step 7. Unstacking orange_block_1 from black_block_1 means the arm will be holding orange_block_1 after the action. So, we can't immediately pick up black_block_1. We need to put orange_block_1 down first. Let's revise:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1 (This ensures brown_block_1 is on the table, which will be needed for Constraint 3)
3. unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1
4. stack orange_block_1 black_block_1 (This satisfies Constraint 2. Constraint 3 is already satisfied because in step 2, brown_block_1 was on the table)
5. pickup brown_block_1
6. stack brown_block_1 black_block_2
7. unstack orange_block_1 black_block_1
8. putdown orange_block_1
9. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2 (This is a mistake. black_block_1 is not on grey_block_2 now; it's clear. So let's correct this.)

I messed up again. Let's step back and think clearly. At the initial state, black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2. So let's start fresh:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1 (This ensures brown_block_1 is on the table, which will be needed for Constraint 3)
3. unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1
4. stack orange_block_1 black_block_1 (This satisfies Constraint 2. Constraint 3 is already satisfied because in step 2, brown_block_1 was on the table)
5. pickup brown_block_1
6. stack brown_block_1 black_block_2
7. unstack orange_block_1 black_block_1
8. putdown orange_block_1
9. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2
10. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1
11. pickup orange_block_1 (At this point, we're holding orange_block_1 and black_block_2 is not clear, satisfying Constraint 1)
12. putdown orange_block_1
13. unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1
14. putdown grey_block_2
15. pickup green_block_1

In reality, the most optimal plan should involve minimal sequences of putdown and pickup for the same block. Let's check if there's a better way:

Actually I just realized there's a mistake in the state tracking above. After step 4, black_block_1 is not on grey_block_2 anymore; it has orange_block_1 on top of it. So in step 9, we can't unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_2. Let me rethink.

Actually no, I just confused myself. It's important to track the state carefully, and I was getting confused.

In step 4, we stack orange_block_1 on black_block_1. black_block_1 is still on top of grey_block_2. It's just that black_block_1 is no longer clear; it has orange_block_1 on top of it. So in step 9, we can indeed unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_2. But first, we need to ensure that black_block_1 is clear. That's why in step 7, we unstack orange_block_1 from black_block_1.

The state after step 4 would be:
- green_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
- black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
- orange_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- black_block_2 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on the table
- orange_block_1 is clear
- black_block_2 is clear
- brown_block_1 is clear
- grey_block_1 is clear
- Arm is empty

And the state after step 7 would be:
- green_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_2 is on top of green_block_1
- black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_2
- black_block_2 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on the table
- Arm is holding orange_block_1
- black_block_1 is clear
- black_block_2 is clear
- brown_block_1 is clear
- grey_block_1 is clear

So, step 9 (unstacking black_block_1 from grey_block_2) is valid.

Let's ensure we satisfy Constraint 1. It says at some point, arm should be holding orange_block_1 AND black_block_2 should not be clear. In the plan, this condition is met after step 10: once we stack black_block_1 on brown_block_1, we can pickup orange_block_1, and at that moment, black_block_2 is not clear because brown_block_1 is on top of it.

I think this is a good solution now, and is close to optimal. I should also note that Constraint 3 is satisfied after step 4, where we have black_block_1 not being clear (orange_block_1 is on top of it), and at an earlier state, in step 2, brown_block_1 was on the table. The final step, picking up green_block_1, achieves our goal. I've also ensured that constraint 4 is satisfied by never putting black_block_1 on the table.

Let me restate the plan for clarity:

1. unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1
3. unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1
4. stack orange_block_1 black_block_1
5. pickup brown_block_1
6. stack brown_block_1 black_block_2
7. unstack orange_block_1 black_block_1
8. putdown orange_block_1
9. unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2
10. stack black_block_1 brown_block_1
11. pickup orange_block_1
12. putdown orange_block_1
13. unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1
14. putdown grey_block_2
15. pickup green_block_1

Actually, there's a more optimal solution. We can achieve the goal in a more direct manner while having an elegant approach to the constraints. If we position the blocks appropriately, we can manipulate the system so as to satisfy the constraints in a shorter number of steps. But I think the solution I've provided is a valid one. 

Let me give my final solution:

```
unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1
stack orange_block_1 black_block_1
pickup brown_block_1
stack brown_block_1 black_block_2
unstack orange_block_1 black_block_1
putdown orange_block_1
unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2
stack black_block_1 brown_block_1
pickup orange_block_1
putdown orange_block_1
unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1
putdown grey_block_2
pickup green_block_1
```

On second thought, let me further check if we can simplify steps 11-12. I think they're redundant. Let's see if we can achieve the goal without them.

Wait, steps 11-12 are needed for Constraint 1. At the point after step 10, black_block_2 is not clear (because brown_block_1 is on top of it), and in steps 11-12, we pick up and then put down orange_block_1. During step 11, we're holding orange_block_1 and black_block_2 is not clear, satisfying Constraint 1.

So, my final solution remains:

```
unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1
stack orange_block_1 black_block_1
pickup brown_block_1
stack brown_block_1 black_block_2
unstack orange_block_1 black_block_1
putdown orange_block_1
unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2
stack black_block_1 brown_block_1
pickup orange_block_1
putdown orange_block_1
unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1
putdown grey_block_2
pickup green_block_1
```

But actually I just realized I've been overthinking this problem. Let's break down the constraints and see if we can simplify:

1. Constraint 1: At some point, arm should be holding orange_block_1 AND black_block_2 should not be clear.
   - To satisfy this, we need to put something on black_block_2 and then hold orange_block_1.

2. Constraint 2: At some point, black_block_1 should not be clear.
   - To satisfy this, we need to put something on black_block_1.

3. Constraint 3: If black_block_1 is not clear at some point, then at an earlier state either brown_block_1 is on the table OR grey_block_1 is not on the table.
   - This means before making black_block_1 not clear, we need to ensure either brown_block_1 is on the table or grey_block_1 is not on the table.

4. Constraint 4: black_block_1 should never be on the table.
   - This restricts how we can move black_block_1. We can't put it on the table.

The goal is to hold green_block_1. To do that, we need to clear it. Currently, grey_block_2 is on green_block_1, and black_block_1 is on grey_block_2. So, we need to move black_block_1 and grey_block_2. But because of Constraint 4, we must stack black_block_1 somewhere, not put it on the table.

Given these insights, I should just make sure I'm maintaining all constraints, rather than taking a more complex solution. And I believe the approach I outlined is valid, with all 15 steps being necessary.

OK, I'm confident that this is a good (minimal) solution:

```
unstack brown_block_1 orange_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
unstack orange_block_1 grey_block_1
stack orange_block_1 black_block_1
pickup brown_block_1
stack brown_block_1 black_block_2
unstack orange_block_1 black_block_1
putdown orange_block_1
unstack black_block_1 grey_block_2
stack black_block_1 brown_block_1
pickup orange_block_1
putdown orange_block_1
unstack grey_block_2 green_block_1
putdown grey_block_2
pickup green_block_1
```
