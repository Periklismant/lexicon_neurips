Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to make sure that black_block_1 is clear in the final state. But there are several constraints to satisfy along the way. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the goal, then consider the constraints one by one.

Initial State:
- purple_block_1 is on the table, with grey_block_1 on top, then brown_block_1, brown_block_2, and grey_block_2. So the tower here is purple_block_1 → grey_block_1 → brown_block_1 → brown_block_2 → grey_block_2. And grey_block_2 is clear.
- black_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_2 on top. Purple_block_2 is clear.
- The robot is not holding anything.

Goal:
- black_block_1 must be clear. Currently, purple_block_2 is on it, so we need to remove that.

Constraints:
1. At some state, grey_block_1 must not be clear (i.e., has a block on top).
2. If grey_block_1 is not clear, then grey_block_2 must be on black_block_1 either at that state or later.
3. At some state, brown_block_2 must be on purple_block_2.
4. At some state, brown_block_2 must not be clear (has a block on top).
5. If brown_block_2 is not clear, then grey_block_2 must be on the table at that state or later.

So, the plan must achieve the goal (black_block_1 clear) while ensuring these constraints are met.

First, the main goal is to remove purple_block_2 from black_block_1. So we need to move purple_block_2 somewhere else. Let's see where. Since the constraints involve moving brown_block_2 and grey_block_2, perhaps we can use those in the plan.

Looking at constraint 3: brown_block_2 must be on purple_block_2 at some point. So we need to stack brown_block_2 onto purple_block_2. But currently, brown_block_2 is under grey_block_2 in the tower on purple_block_1. So to get brown_block_2, we need to unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2, then unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1.

Then, stack brown_block_2 onto purple_block_2. That would satisfy constraint 3. But after that, we need to handle constraint 4, which requires that brown_block_2 is not clear at some state. So after stacking brown_block_2 on purple_block_2, we might need to put something on top of it. Maybe grey_block_2? But then, constraint 5 says that if brown_block_2 is not clear (i.e., has a block on top), then grey_block_2 must be on the table at that state or later. So if we put grey_block_2 on brown_block_2, then in that state, we need to later put grey_block_2 on the table. But then, perhaps we can stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_2 temporarily, then move it to the table later.

But let's think step by step.

First, to get to purple_block_2 (which is on black_block_1) and move it, since that's required for the goal. So we need to unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1. Wait, but the initial state says purple_block_2 is on black_block_1 and is clear. So the robot can unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1. But after that, black_block_1 would be clear. However, the goal is to have black_block_1 clear, so if we just remove purple_block_2 and put it somewhere else, that would achieve the goal. But we have to satisfy the other constraints.

Wait, but the goal is to have black_block_1 clear in the final state. So if we unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1 and put it down, then in the final state, black_block_1 is clear. But we have to make sure that all constraints are met along the way.

But let's check the constraints:

Constraint 1: At some state, grey_block_1 must not be clear. In the initial state, grey_block_1 has brown_block_1 on top, so it's already not clear. Wait, initial state: grey_block_1 is on purple_block_1, and brown_block_1 is on grey_block_1. So grey_block_1 is not clear. So constraint 1 is already satisfied in the initial state. So maybe we don't need to do anything for constraint 1. But the problem says "must hold in at least one state". Since the initial state has grey_block_1 not clear, that's already satisfied. So constraint 1 is already met. Therefore, we don't need to worry about that anymore.

But wait, the problem says "must hold in at least one state", so the initial state counts. So constraint 1 is already satisfied. That's a relief.

But constraint 2 says that if grey_block_1 is not clear in some state, then grey_block_2 must be on black_block_1 in that state or later. Since in the initial state, grey_block_1 is not clear, we need to ensure that either in the initial state or later, grey_block_2 is on black_block_1. But in the initial state, grey_block_2 is on brown_block_2, so that's not the case. Therefore, we must have at some point after the initial state, grey_block_2 is on black_block_1.

So this means that after the initial state, since the initial state triggers the condition (grey_block_1 not clear), we need to have grey_block_2 on black_block_1 at some point after.

So we need to stack grey_block_2 onto black_block_1 at some point.

But in the initial state, grey_block_2 is on top of brown_block_2. To move it, we need to unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2, then stack it on black_block_1. But to do that, we need to have black_block_1 clear. But initially, black_block_1 has purple_block_2 on it. So first, we need to remove purple_block_2 from black_block_1, then put it somewhere else, then stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1.

Wait, but the goal is to have black_block_1 clear. So if we stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1, that would make black_block_1 not clear. Then we need to remove it again to meet the goal. Hmm. So perhaps we need to stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1, then later unstack it and put it on the table. But that adds steps. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to satisfy the constraint without conflicting with the goal.

Wait, the constraint says that if in some state s, grey_block_1 is not clear, then grey_block_2 must be on black_block_1 in s or a later state. Since the initial state s0 has grey_block_1 not clear, then in s0 or any later state, grey_block_2 must be on black_block_1. But in s0, it's not. So we need to have grey_block_2 on black_block_1 in some state after s0.

But the final goal is that black_block_1 is clear. So we can have grey_block_2 on black_block_1 at some point, then remove it again. So the plan must include stacking grey_block_2 onto black_block_1 and then removing it.

But that's more steps. Let's see how that can fit.

Now, constraint 3: brown_block_2 must be on purple_block_2 at some state. So we need to stack brown_block_2 onto purple_block_2. Currently, brown_block_2 is under grey_block_2. So we need to unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2, then unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1, then stack brown_block_2 on purple_block_2.

But to unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1, we need to have nothing on top of brown_block_2. Initially, grey_block_2 is on top. So first, unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2, then unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1, then stack brown_block_2 on purple_block_2.

Then, constraint 4 requires that brown_block_2 is not clear at some state. So after stacking brown_block_2 on purple_block_2, we need to put something on top of it. Maybe grey_block_2? Then, after that, constraint 5 says that if brown_block_2 is not clear (i.e., has something on top), then grey_block_2 must be on the table at that state or later. So if we stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_2, then in that state, brown_block_2 is not clear. So we need to have grey_block_2 on the table either at that state or later. But if we stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_2, then to satisfy constraint 5, we need to put grey_block_2 on the table at some point after that.

So the steps would be:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2. Then put it down (putdown) or use it somewhere else.

But let's outline the steps.

First, to satisfy constraint 3 and 4:

- Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2. Since grey_block_2 is clear, the robot can do this. Then put it down (putdown grey_block_2). Then unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1. Stack brown_block_2 on purple_block_2. Then stack something on brown_block_2. For example, stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_2. Then later, put grey_block_2 on the table to satisfy constraint 5.

But this is getting complicated. Let's think of the steps.

Initial state:

Tower1: purple_block_1 (table) → grey_block_1 → brown_block_1 → brown_block_2 → grey_block_2 (clear)

Tower2: black_block_1 (table) → purple_block_2 (clear)

Goal: black_block_1 clear (so remove purple_block_2 from it)

Constraints:

- Must have brown_block_2 on purple_block_2 at some point.

- Must have something on brown_block_2 (so it's not clear) at some point, and after that, grey_block_2 must be on the table.

- Also, must have grey_block_2 on black_block_1 at some point after the initial state.

So possible plan steps:

1. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1. Then put it down. But then black_block_1 is clear, which is the goal. But we need to satisfy other constraints. So perhaps we can't do that yet because we need to stack brown_block_2 on purple_block_2 first.

Wait, but purple_block_2 is on black_block_1. To stack brown_block_2 on purple_block_2, we need to have purple_block_2 clear. Which it is. So we could stack brown_block_2 on purple_block_2. But how?

Wait, brown_block_2 is currently under grey_block_2. So to get brown_block_2, we need to unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2, then unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1.

So steps:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2. This requires that grey_block_2 is clear (which it is) and the robot is not holding anything. Then, putdown grey_block_2.

2. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1. Now, brown_block_2 is clear. Then, stack brown_block_2 on purple_block_2 (which is on black_block_1). But to stack on purple_block_2, it must be clear. Yes, purple_block_2 is clear. So stack brown_block_2 on purple_block_2. Now, brown_block_2 is on purple_block_2, which is on black_block_1. This satisfies constraint 3.

Now, constraint 4 requires that brown_block_2 is not clear at some point. So after stacking brown_block_2 on purple_block_2, it's clear. So we need to put something on top of brown_block_2. Let's say we take grey_block_2 and stack it on brown_block_2. So:

3. Pickup grey_block_2 (which is on the table from step 1), then stack it on brown_block_2. Now, brown_block_2 is not clear. This satisfies constraint 4. But then, according to constraint 5, if brown_block_2 is not clear (which it is now), then grey_block_2 must be on the table at this state or later. So in this state, grey_block_2 is on brown_block_2, so it's not on the table. Therefore, we must later put grey_block_2 on the table.

So after stacking grey_block_2 on brown_block_2, we need to unstack it and put it down. But perhaps after that, we can move it to black_block_1 to satisfy constraint 2.

But also, we need to have grey_block_2 on black_block_1 at some point after the initial state. So perhaps after moving grey_block_2 to the table, we can stack it on black_block_1.

Wait, but the current state after step 3 is:

purple_block_1 → grey_block_1 → brown_block_1

black_block_1 → purple_block_2 → brown_block_2 → grey_block_2

grey_block_2 is on brown_block_2, so brown_block_2 is not clear. Then, to satisfy constraint 5, we need to have grey_block_2 on the table at some point after this. So we can unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2 and put it down. Then, stack it on black_block_1. But stacking on black_block_1 would require that black_block_1 is clear. But in the current state, black_block_1 has purple_block_2, which has brown_block_2 and grey_block_2 on top. So black_block_1 is not clear. So we need to first remove everything from black_block_1 to make it clear.

But the goal is to have black_block_1 clear. So perhaps after moving purple_block_2 off, but that's the original goal. Let's recap:

We need to end up with black_block_1 clear. So at some point, we need to remove everything from black_block_1. Currently, after step 3, black_block_1 has purple_block_2, brown_block_2, grey_block_2. So we need to unstack all of those.

But let's see. The current stack on black_block_1 is purple_block_2 → brown_block_2 → grey_block_2. So to clear black_block_1, we need to unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1, but that's only possible if purple_block_2 is clear. However, brown_block_2 is on top of purple_block_2. So to unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1, we need to first remove brown_block_2 and grey_block_2 from it. Which complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe we should not stack brown_block_2 on purple_block_2 which is on black_block_1. Because that would create a tower on black_block_1, which we then need to dismantle. Maybe instead, stack brown_block_2 on purple_block_2 after moving purple_block_2 to another location.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's first move purple_block_2 from black_block_1 to the table. Then, stack brown_block_2 on purple_block_2 (now on the table). Then, stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_2. Then, move grey_block_2 to the table. Then, move brown_block_2 and purple_block_2 as needed. But this might help in the final goal.

But let's think again. The main goal is to have black_block_1 clear. So moving purple_block_2 off black_block_1 is necessary. Let's consider steps:

1. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1. Preconditions: purple_block_2 is clear (yes), robot is empty. Then putdown purple_block_2. Now, black_block_1 is clear. But the goal is to have it clear in the final state. However, we need to satisfy other constraints. But after this step, black_block_1 is clear. If this is the final state, then the goal is achieved. But we need to check constraints.

But the constraints require:

- brown_block_2 must be on purple_block_2 at some state. So if we have purple_block_2 on the table, then we can stack brown_block_2 on it.

But brown_block_2 is part of the tower on purple_block_1. So let's proceed.

After step 1, black_block_1 is clear, but we need to make sure that grey_block_2 is on black_block_1 at some point.

Wait, constraint 2 says that if grey_block_1 is not clear (which it is in the initial state), then grey_block_2 must be on black_block_1 at that state or later. Since the initial state is already triggering this, we need to have grey_block_2 on black_block_1 at some point after.

So even if we achieve the goal early, we need to ensure that this constraint is met. So even if we make black_block_1 clear in step 1, we still need to have grey_block_2 on black_block_1 at some point after. But that would require stacking grey_block_2 on black_block_1, which would make black_block_1 not clear again. Then we need to remove it again. So perhaps the plan will involve moving purple_block_2 back to black_block_1 after some steps, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe the plan is as follows:

- First, move purple_block_2 to the table (so black_block_1 is clear, but we have to later make sure that grey_block_2 is on black_block_1).

But then, after step 1, we need to stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1. But to do that, black_block_1 must be clear. Which it is. So stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1. Now, constraint 2 is satisfied because grey_block_2 is on black_block_1. Then, we can unstack grey_block_2 and put it on the table again. That way, the final state has black_block_1 clear.

But this would add steps. Let's outline:

1. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1 (putdown purple_block_2).

2. Stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1 (requires unstacking grey_block_2 from brown_block_2 first).

Wait, but grey_block_2 is on brown_block_2 in the initial tower. So to stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1, we need to:

a. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2.

b. Stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1.

But after step 1, black_block_1 is clear, so step 2b is possible.

But in the initial state, grey_block_2 is on brown_block_2, which is on brown_block_1, etc. So steps:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2. (Action: unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_2). Then put it down.

2. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1. Then stack brown_block_2 on purple_block_2 (which is on black_block_1, but after step 1, purple_block_2 is still on black_block_1? Wait no, step 1 in this scenario was unstacking purple_block_2 from black_block_1. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up steps.

Wait, let's re-clarify:

Scenario where first step is to unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1 and put it down.

So:

Action 1: unstack purple_block_2 black_block_1. Then, putdown purple_block_2.

After this, black_block_1 is clear, but we need to satisfy constraint 2 by stacking grey_block_2 on black_block_1 later.

But grey_block_2 is on brown_block_2, which is part of the tower on purple_block_1. So to stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1, we need to:

Action 2: unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2.

Action 3: stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1.

But after action 3, black_block_1 has grey_block_2 on it, so it's not clear. Then, to meet the goal, we need to unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1 and put it down.

Action 4: unstack grey_block_2 black_block_1.

Action 5: putdown grey_block_2.

Now, black_block_1 is clear again, meeting the goal.

But now, we need to also satisfy constraints 3 and 4.

Constraint 3: brown_block_2 must be on purple_block_2 at some state. Currently, purple_block_2 is on the table (after action 1). So we need to stack brown_block_2 on purple_block_2.

But brown_block_2 is in the tower on purple_block_1. To get it, we need to unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1. But brown_block_2 is under grey_block_2. So first, unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2 (which we did in action 2). Then, unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1.

Action 6: unstack brown_block_2 brown_block_1.

Action 7: stack brown_block_2 purple_block_2.

Now, constraint 3 is satisfied.

Constraint 4: brown_block_2 must be not clear at some state. After action 7, brown_block_2 is on purple_block_2 and is clear. So we need to stack something on it. Let's use grey_block_2.

Action 8: pickup grey_block_2 (after action 5, grey_block_2 is on the table).

Action 9: stack grey_block_2 brown_block_2.

Now, brown_block_2 is not clear, satisfying constraint 4. But then, constraint 5 requires that if brown_block_2 is not clear, then grey_block_2 must be on the table at that state or later. So after action 9, grey_block_2 is on brown_block_2. Therefore, we need to move grey_block_2 to the table at some point after.

Action 10: unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_2.

Action 11: putdown grey_block_2.

Now, all constraints are satisfied:

- Constraint 1: initial state satisfied.

- Constraint 2: grey_block_2 was on black_block_1 in action 3.

- Constraint 3: brown_block_2 on purple_block_2 in action 7.

- Constraint 4: brown_block_2 not clear in action 9.

- Constraint 5: after action 9, in action 11, grey_block_2 is on the table.

But let's count the steps. The actions would be:

1. unstack purple_block_2 black_block_1

2. putdown purple_block_2

3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_2

4. stack grey_block_2 black_block_1

5. unstack grey_block_2 black_block_1

6. putdown grey_block_2

7. unstack brown_block_2 brown_block_1

8. stack brown_block_2 purple_block_2

9. pickup grey_block_2

10. stack grey_block_2 brown_block_2

11. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_2

12. putdown grey_block_2

But this seems long. Maybe there's a more optimal way.

Alternatively, maybe we can combine some steps. Let's think again.

Another approach: To satisfy constraint 2, we need to stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1 after the initial state. To do that, first unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1 (since it's on there). But perhaps after that, stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1, then move it again.

Wait, but if we unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1, then black_block_1 is clear, so we can stack grey_block_2 on it. Then, later, we can unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1 and put it down. That would satisfy constraint 2.

Now, for constraint 3 and 4:

After moving purple_block_2 to the table, stack brown_block_2 on it. Then stack something on brown_block_2 (like grey_block_2), then move grey_block_2 to the table.

But let's outline:

1. unstack purple_block_2 black_block_1 → putdown purple_block_2. Now, black_block_1 is clear. But we need to stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1 later.

2. unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2 (action: unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_2), then stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1. Now, constraint 2 is satisfied.

3. unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1 and putdown.

Now, we need to handle brown_block_2 and purple_block_2.

4. unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1 (since after step 2, grey_block_2 is moved, brown_block_2 is clear).

Wait, no: after step 2, grey_block_2 was moved from brown_block_2, so brown_block_2 is clear. So steps:

1. unstack purple_block_2 black_block_1 → putdown.

2. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_2 → stack grey_block_2 black_block_1.

3. unstack grey_block_2 black_block_1 → putdown.

4. unstack brown_block_2 brown_block_1 → stack brown_block_2 purple_block_2.

5. stack grey_block_2 brown_block_2 → then unstack and putdown.

But this seems similar to the previous approach. But this sequence may be shorter.

Wait, let's count steps:

Actions:

1. unstack purple_block_2 black_block_1

2. putdown purple_block_2

3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_2

4. stack grey_block_2 black_block_1

5. unstack grey_block_2 black_block_1

6. putdown grey_block_2

7. unstack brown_block_2 brown_block_1

8. stack brown_block_2 purple_block_2

9. pickup grey_block_2

10. stack grey_block_2 brown_block_2

11. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_2

12. putdown grey_block_2

That's 12 actions, which seems long. Can we find a shorter path?

Alternative approach: Consider that constraint 2 requires grey_block_2 to be on black_block_1 at some point after the initial state, and constraint 5 requires that if brown_block_2 is not clear (has something on top), then grey_block_2 must be on the table at that state or later.

Maybe we can stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_2 first, then move it to black_block_1, then to the table.

But let's think:

Current state after moving purple_block_2 to table:

black_block_1 is clear (goal), but we need to have grey_block_2 on black_block_1 at some point.

Wait, but if we don't move purple_block_2 first, but instead work on the other blocks.

Alternative plan:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2 (to get brown_block_2 clear).

2. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1.

3. Stack brown_block_2 on purple_block_2 (which is on black_block_1). This satisfies constraint 3.

Now, brown_block_2 is on purple_block_2, which is on black_block_1. But then, to satisfy constraint 4, we need to have something on brown_block_2.

4. Stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_2. This satisfies constraint 4.

Now, constraint 5 says that when brown_block_2 is not clear (which it is now), grey_block_2 must be on the table at that state or later. So after this step, we need to put grey_block_2 on the table.

5. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2 and put it down.

Now, we need to handle constraint 2: have grey_block_2 on black_block_1. Since after step 5, grey_block_2 is on the table, we can stack it on black_block_1.

6. Pickup grey_block_2 and stack it on black_block_1.

Now, constraint 2 is satisfied. Then, to achieve the goal of black_block_1 being clear, we need to unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1 and put it down.

7. Unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1 and putdown.

Finally, we need to move purple_block_2 off black_block_1. Wait, no, in this scenario, purple_block_2 is on black_block_1 with brown_block_2 on top. So black_block_1 has purple_block_2, which has brown_block_2, which has been cleared (grey_block_2 was moved off). Wait, no, after step 5, brown_block_2 is on purple_block_2 (on black_block_1), and is clear (since grey_block_2 was put down). So to make black_block_1 clear, we need to remove purple_block_2. But purple_block_2 is under brown_block_2. So we need to first unstack brown_block_2 from purple_block_2, then putdown purple_block_2.

But this is getting complex. Let's see:

After step 5:

black_block_1 has purple_block_2 → brown_block_2 (clear)

grey_block_2 is on the table.

Other tower: purple_block_1 → grey_block_1 → brown_block_1 (clear).

So steps:

6. Unstack brown_block_2 from purple_block_2 (requires that brown_block_2 is clear, which it is after step 5).

7. Putdown brown_block_2.

8. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1 and putdown.

Now, black_block_1 is clear.

But this adds steps 6-8. Also, we need to have grey_block_2 on black_block_1 at some point. In step 6, after step 5, we could instead stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1.

Wait, after step 5: grey_block_2 is on the table.

So step 6: pickup grey_block_2 and stack on black_block_1.

Then step 7: unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1 and putdown.

Then step 8: unstack brown_block_2 from purple_block_2.

Then step 9: putdown brown_block_2.

Step 10: unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1 and putdown.

This is getting too long. Let's count the steps again:

Initial approach:

1. unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2 → putdown.

2. unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1 → stack on purple_block_2.

3. stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_2.

4. unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2 → putdown.

5. unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1 → putdown.

But this leaves purple_block_2 on the table, black_block_1 clear. But where is grey_block_2? On the table.

But we need to stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1 at some point. So:

After step 5:

6. pickup grey_block_2 → stack on black_block_1.

7. unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1 → putdown.

So total steps: 7.

But does this satisfy all constraints?

Let's check:

Constraint 1: grey_block_1 not clear in initial state → satisfied.

Constraint 2: grey_block_2 on black_block_1 in step 6 → satisfied.

Constraint 3: brown_block_2 on purple_block_2 in step 2 → satisfied.

Constraint 4: brown_block_2 not clear in step 3 → satisfied.

Constraint 5: after step 3 (brown_block_2 not clear), grey_block_2 is on brown_block_2. Then in step 4, we put grey_block_2 on the table. So step 4 meets the requirement for constraint 5.

But step 3's state requires that grey_block_2 is on the table at or after. Since in step 4, we put it down, which is after step 3, that's satisfied.

So this plan would have:

1. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_2

2. putdown grey_block_2

3. unstack brown_block_2 brown_block_1

4. stack brown_block_2 purple_block_2

5. pickup grey_block_2

6. stack grey_block_2 brown_block_2

7. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_2

8. putdown grey_block_2

9. unstack purple_block_2 black_block_1

10. putdown purple_block_2

11. pickup grey_block_2

12. stack grey_block_2 black_block_1

13. unstack grey_block_2 black_block_1

14. putdown grey_block_2

This is way too long. I must be missing a more optimal path.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to combine steps. For example, when stacking grey_block_2 on brown_block_2, then moving it to black_block_1.

Let me try:

1. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_2 → putdown.

2. unstack brown_block_2 brown_block_1 → stack brown_block_2 purple_block_2 (now on black_block_1).

3. pickup grey_block_2 → stack grey_block_2 brown_block_2 (satisfies constraints 3 and 4).

4. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_2 → stack grey_block_2 black_block_1 (satisfies constraint 2).

5. unstack grey_block_2 black_block_1 → putdown.

6. unstack brown_block_2 purple_block_2 → putdown.

7. unstack purple_block_2 black_block_1 → putdown.

But this has 7 steps. But does this work?

Let's check:

Step 1: grey_block_2 is on the table.

Step 2: brown_block_2 is on purple_block_2 (on black_block_1).

Step 3: grey_block_2 is on brown_block_2 (so brown_block_2 is not clear. This satisfies constraint 4.

Step 4: unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2, then stack on black_block_1. This satisfies constraint 2.

Step 5: unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1, putdown.

Now, black_block_1 has purple_block_2 → brown_block_2.

Steps 6 and 7: unstack brown_block_2 and purple_block_2, then putdown.

But after step 7, black_block_1 is clear.

But let's check if all constraints are met.

Constraints:

1. Initially, grey_block_1 not clear → met.

2. After step 4, grey_block_2 is on black_block_1 → met.

3. Step 2: brown_block_2 on purple_block_2 → met.

4. Step 3: brown_block_2 not clear → met.

5. After step 3, brown_block_2 not clear. Then in step 4, grey_block_2 is moved to black_block_1. So in step 4, grey_block_2 is not on the table. But step 5 puts it down, which is after step 3. So constraint 5 is met.

Yes. So this plan would have the following steps:

1. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_2

2. putdown grey_block_2

3. unstack brown_block_2 brown_block_1

4. stack brown_block_2 purple_block_2

5. pickup grey_block_2

6. stack grey_block_2 brown_block_2

7. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_2

8. stack grey_block_2 black_block_1

9. unstack grey_block_2 black_block_1

10. putdown grey_block_2

11. unstack brown_block_2 purple_block_2

12. putdown brown_block_2

13. unstack purple_block_2 black_block_1

14. putdown purple_block_2

But this is 14 steps. I must be missing a shorter path.

Alternatively, perhaps after stacking grey_block_2 on brown_block_2 (step 6), and then moving it to black_block_1 (step 8), we can then move purple_block_2 and brown_block_2 off black_block_1.

Wait, but to unstack brown_block_2 from purple_block_2 (which is on black_block_1), we need to first unstack any blocks above brown_block_2. In step 6, brown_block_2 has grey_block_2 on top. So we need to unstack grey_block_2 first (step 7), then unstack brown_block_2 (step 11), then unstack purple_block_2 (step 13).

But this makes the plan very long.

Another approach: What if we move purple_block_2 early on to the table, then build the required stacks there.

For example:

1. unstack purple_block_2 black_block_1 → putdown.

Now, black_block_1 is clear. But we need to stack grey_block_2 on it later.

2. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_2 → putdown.

3. unstack brown_block_2 brown_block_1 → stack brown_block_2 purple_block_2 (now on table).

4. stack grey_block_2 brown_block_2 → now brown_block_2 is not clear.

5. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_2 → stack grey_block_2 black_block_1.

6. unstack grey_block_2 black_block_1 → putdown.

This satisfies all constraints:

- Constraint 3: brown_block_2 on purple_block_2 (step 3).

- Constraint 4: step 4.

- Constraint 5: step 5 moves grey_block_2 to black_block_1, then step 6 puts it on table.

- Constraint 2: step 5.

Final state: purple_block_2 on table with brown_block_2 and grey_block_2 on table; black_block_1 clear.

But the goal is achieved. All constraints are met.

Steps:

1. unstack purple_block_2 black_block_1

2. putdown purple_block_2

3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_2

4. putdown grey_block_2

5. unstack brown_block_2 brown_block_1

6. stack brown_block_2 purple_block_2

7. pickup grey_block_2

8. stack grey_block_2 brown_block_2

9. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_2

10. stack grey_block_2 black_block_1

11. unstack grey_block_2 black_block_1

12. putdown grey_block_2

That's 12 steps. Is there a shorter way?

Wait, after step 6, brown_block_2 is on purple_block_2 (on table). Then step 7-8 stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_2. Then unstack and stack on black_block_1. Then putdown. But maybe steps can be combined.

Another idea: After step 6 (brown_block_2 on purple_block_2), stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_2 (step 7-8). Then, instead of moving grey_block_2 to black_block_1, perhaps move the entire stack (purple_block_2, brown_block_2, grey_block_2) to black_block_1. But that's not possible since the blocks are already on the table. Alternatively, after stacking grey_block_2 on brown_block_2, unstack grey_block_2 and stack on black_block_1.

But the goal requires black_block_1 to be clear in the end. So after stacking grey_block_2 on black_block_1, we have to remove it again.

But maybe there's a way to use fewer steps.

Alternative plan:

1. unstack purple_block_2 black_block_1 → putdown.

2. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_2 → stack on black_block_1.

This satisfies constraint 2. Then, unstack grey_block_2 black_block_1 → putdown.

3. unstack brown_block_2 brown_block_1 → stack on purple_block_2 (satisfies constraint 3).

4. stack grey_block_2 brown_block_2 (satisfies constraint 4).

5. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_2 → putdown (satisfies constraint 5).

Now, all constraints are met. Final steps:

1. unstack purple_block_2 black_block_1

2. putdown purple_block_2

3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_2

4. stack grey_block_2 black_block_1

5. unstack grey_block_2 black_block_1

6. putdown grey_block_2

7. unstack brown_block_2 brown_block_1

8. stack brown_block_2 purple_block_2

9. pickup grey_block_2

10. stack grey_block_2 brown_block_2

11. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_2

12. putdown grey_block_2

This is 12 steps. The final state has purple_block_2 on the table, brown_block_2 on purple_block_2, grey_block_2 on the table, and black_block_1 clear. So goal achieved. Constraints met.

But can we optimize further?

Wait, step 4 stacks grey_block_2 on black_block_1. Then step 5 unstacks it. Could we instead use the same grey_block_2 to stack on brown_block_2 without putting it down?

After step 4, grey_block_2 is on black_block_1. Then, we need to unstack it (step 5), put it down (step 6), then pickup again (step 9), and stack on brown_block_2. Can we instead directly move it from black_block_1 to brown_block_2?

But after step 4, grey_block_2 is on black_block_1. To stack it on brown_block_2, we need to unstack it from black_block_1 (step 5), then pickup and stack. But we can't stack from holding it unless we unstack first.

Alternatively, maybe during the unstack from black_block_1, immediately stack on brown_block_2. Let's see:

Step 4: stack grey_block_2 black_block_1.

Step 5: unstack grey_block_2 black_block_1 → now holding grey_block_2.

Step 6: stack grey_block_2 brown_block_2.

This saves the putdown and pickup steps.

So revised steps:

1. unstack purple_block_2 black_block_1

2. putdown purple_block_2

3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_2

4. stack grey_block_2 black_block_1

5. unstack grey_block_2 black_block_1

6. stack grey_block_2 brown_block_2

7. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_2

8. putdown grey_block_2

9. unstack brown_block_2 brown_block_1

10. stack brown_block_2 purple_block_2

Now, let's check:

Step 1: black_block_1 clear.

Step 2: purple_block_2 on table.

Step 3: unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2 → holding grey_block_2.

Step 4: stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1 → satisfies constraint 2.

Step 5: unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1 → holding grey_block_2.

Step 6: stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_2 (which is still on brown_block_1? No, because after step 3, brown_block_2 is clear. Because grey_block_2 was removed. So step 9 is needed to unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1.

Wait, after step 3, grey_block_2 is unstacked from brown_block_2, so brown_block_2 is clear. But brown_block_2 is on brown_block_1. So to stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_2, brown_block_2 must be clear, which it is. So step 6: stack grey_block_2 brown_block_2.

But after step 6, brown_block_2 is not clear → satisfies constraint 4. Then, step 7: unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2 → putdown in step 8. This satisfies constraint 5.

Then, step 9: unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1 → stack on purple_block_2 in step 10 → satisfies constraint 3.

Final state: brown_block_2 on purple_block_2 (on table), grey_block_2 on table, black_block_1 clear.

This plan has 10 steps. Let's list them:

1. unstack purple_block_2 black_block_1

2. putdown purple_block_2

3. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_2

4. stack grey_block_2 black_block_1

5. unstack grey_block_2 black_block_1

6. stack grey_block_2 brown_block_2

7. unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_2

8. putdown grey_block_2

9. unstack brown_block_2 brown_block_1

10. stack brown_block_2 purple_block_2

Now, check constraints:

- Constraint 2: grey_block_2 is on black_block_1 in step 4.

- Constraint 3: brown_block_2 on purple_block_2 in step 10.

- Constraint 4: grey_block_2 on brown_block_2 in step 6.

- Constraint 5: after step 6, grey_block_2 is on brown_block_2. Then, step 8 puts it on the table.

Yes, this works. And the final state has black_block_1 clear. This plan has 10 actions, which is better.

But is this the optimal?

Wait, after step 10, brown_block_2 is on purple_block_2. Is purple_block_2 on the table? Yes, step 2 put it there. So yes.

So this plan seems to meet all constraints and the goal. The steps are:

1. unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1

2. putdown purple_block_2

3. unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2

4. stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1

5. unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1

6. stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_2

7. unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2

8. putdown grey_block_2

9. unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1

10. stack brown_block_2 on purple_block_2

This results in black_block_1 being clear (since step 1 moved purple_block_2 off, and step 4-5 added and removed grey_block_2), and all constraints satisfied.

Yes, this plan should work.
