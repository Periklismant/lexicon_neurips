Okay, let's break this down. The goal is to clear black_block_1. Currently, purple_block_2 is on black_block_1. Also, we have several constraints to satisfy along the way.

Here's the plan:

```
```
unstack grey_block_2 brown_block_2
putdown grey_block_2
unstack brown_block_2 brown_block_1
stack brown_block_2 purple_block_2
unstack brown_block_1 grey_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 purple_block_1
stack grey_block_1 brown_block_2
unstack purple_block_2 black_block_1
stack purple_block_2 grey_block_1
```
