Let me break down the problem:

Given:
- We're in a blocksworld setting with 7 blocks: purple_block_1, black_block_1, purple_block_2, grey_block_1, brown_block_1, brown_block_2, grey_block_2.
- Initial state: 
  - purple_block_1 is on the table
  - black_block_1 is on the table
  - purple_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
  - grey_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1
  - brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
  - brown_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1
  - grey_block_2 is on top of brown_block_2
  - purple_block_2 is clear
  - grey_block_2 is clear
  - arm is empty
- Goal: black_block_1 is clear
- Constraints:
  1. At some point, grey_block_1 must not be clear.
  2. If grey_block_1 is not clear, then grey_block_2 must be on top of black_block_1 either at the same state or some state after.
  3. At some point, brown_block_2 must be on top of purple_block_2.
  4. At some point, brown_block_2 must not be clear.
  5. If brown_block_2 is not clear, then grey_block_2 must be on the table either at the same state or some state after.

Let's start by visualizing the initial state and thinking about the steps to reach our goal.

Initial State:
```
         grey_block_2
             |
         brown_block_2
             |
         brown_block_1
             |
         grey_block_1
             |
      purple_block_1          purple_block_2
                                 |
                             black_block_1
            --------------------------------
                          table
```

Goal: black_block_1 is clear

In the initial state, black_block_1 is not clear because purple_block_2 is on top of it. Our first approach would be to remove purple_block_2 from black_block_1.

Let's think about the constraints:

1. "grey_block_1 must not be clear" - This is initially the case, as brown_block_1 is on top of it.
2. "If grey_block_1 is not clear, then grey_block_2 must be on top of black_block_1" - Grey_block_1 is not clear in the initial state, so at some point, grey_block_2 must be on top of black_block_1.
3. "brown_block_2 must be on top of purple_block_2" - We need to ensure this happens at some state.
4. "brown_block_2 must not be clear" - This means something must be placed on top of brown_block_2 at some point.
5. "If brown_block_2 is not clear, then grey_block_2 must be on the table" - This means that when we place something on brown_block_2, grey_block_2 must be on the table (or moved to the table later).

Given all these constraints, I'll plan the sequence of moves to achieve our goal:

1. First, let's recognize that grey_block_1 already has blocks on top of it, satisfying constraint 1 - "grey_block_1 must not be clear".
2. Since grey_block_1 is not clear, constraint 2 says "grey_block_2 must be on top of black_block_1". But first, we need to clear black_block_1, which means removing purple_block_2 from it.
3. Constraints 3 and 4 indicate that we need to put brown_block_2 on top of purple_block_2 and then put some block on top of brown_block_2.
4. From the initial state, to manipulate brown_block_2, we would need to remove the blocks on top of it, which is just grey_block_2.
5. Constraint 5 indicates that when brown_block_2 is not clear, grey_block_2 must be on the table. So, after we use grey_block_2 to make brown_block_2 "not clear", we might have to move grey_block_2 to the table.

Let's start planning the actions:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2.
2. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1.
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1.
4. Unstack grey_block_1 from purple_block_1.
5. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1.
6. Stack brown_block_2 on purple_block_2. (This satisfies constraint 3 - "brown_block_2 must be on top of purple_block_2".)
7. Stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_2. (This satisfies constraint 4 - "brown_block_2 must not be clear".)
8. Stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1. (This satisfies constraint 2 - "grey_block_2 must be on top of black_block_1".)

Hmm, there's a problem. We can't have grey_block_2 both on top of brown_block_2 and on top of black_block_1 simultaneously. Let me think again...

Ok, let's revise our understanding of the constraints. Constraint 2 says "If grey_block_1 is not clear, then grey_block_2 must be on top of black_block_1 either at the same state or some state after." This means that after the state where grey_block_1 is not clear, grey_block_2 must be placed on top of black_block_1 at some point.

Similarly, Constraint 5 says "If brown_block_2 is not clear, then grey_block_2 must be on the table either at the same state or some state after." That means after the state where brown_block_2 is not clear, grey_block_2 must be placed on the table at some point.

With these understandings, let's revise our plan:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2. Now holding grey_block_2.
2. Putdown grey_block_2. (This puts grey_block_2 on the table, which will satisfy constraint 5 later.)
3. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1. Now holding brown_block_2.
4. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1. This means we first need to get to purple_block_2 by unstacking blocks.
   a. First unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1. Now holding brown_block_2.
   b. Putdown brown_block_2. (brown_block_2 is now on the table.)
   c. Unstack brown_block_1 from grey_block_1. Now holding brown_block_1.
   d. Putdown brown_block_1. (brown_block_1 is now on the table.)
   e. Unstack grey_block_1 from purple_block_1. Now holding grey_block_1.
   f. Putdown grey_block_1. (grey_block_1 is now on the table.)
   g. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1. Now holding purple_block_2.
   h. Putdown purple_block_2. (purple_block_2 is now on the table.)
5. Pickup brown_block_2. Now holding brown_block_2.
6. Stack brown_block_2 on purple_block_2. (This satisfies constraint 3 - "brown_block_2 must be on top of purple_block_2".)
7. Pickup grey_block_2. Now holding grey_block_2.
8. Stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_2. (This satisfies constraint 4 - "brown_block_2 must not be clear".)
9. With constraint 5, now grey_block_2 must be placed on the table. So:
   a. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2. Now holding grey_block_2.
   b. Putdown grey_block_2. (grey_block_2 is now on the table, satisfying constraint 5.)
10. Pickup grey_block_2. Now holding grey_block_2.
11. Stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1. (This satisfies constraint 2 - "grey_block_2 must be on top of black_block_1".)
12. Unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1. Now holding grey_block_2.
13. Putdown grey_block_2. (black_block_1 is now clear, which is our goal.)

Hmm, there's still a problem. This approach requires moving blocks around twice, which doesn't seem optimal. Let me reconsider the problem and try to find a more efficient approach.

Let's look at those constraints again:

1. At some point, grey_block_1 must not be clear.
2. If grey_block_1 is not clear, then grey_block_2 must be on top of black_block_1 either at the same state or some state after.
3. At some point, brown_block_2 must be on top of purple_block_2.
4. At some point, brown_block_2 must not be clear.
5. If brown_block_2 is not clear, then grey_block_2 must be on the table either at the same state or some state after.

The first concern is that we are operating with the arm initially empty and while the goal is to have black_block_1 clear. This means we need to unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1. But the constraints seem to indicate that we also need to put grey_block_2 on black_block_1 at some point.

Actually, let's observe that in the initial state, grey_block_1 already has blocks on top of it, satisfying constraint 1.

So to summarize:
1. Constraint 1 is already satisfied in the initial state.
2. Constraint 2 means that at some point, grey_block_2 must be placed on top of black_block_1.
3. Constraint 3 means that at some point, brown_block_2 must be placed on top of purple_block_2.
4. Constraint 4 means that at some point, some block must be placed on top of brown_block_2.
5. Constraint 5 means that after the state where brown_block_2 is not clear, grey_block_2 must be placed on the table at some point.

I think I'll start with a concrete plan, take a more direct approach, and see if it satisfies all constraints.

First, let's dismantle the tower with grey_block_2, brown_block_2, brown_block_1, grey_block_1, and purple_block_1:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2 (Now holding grey_block_2)
   Result:
   ```
                        
            brown_block_2
                |
            brown_block_1
                |
            grey_block_1
                |
         purple_block_1         purple_block_2
                                    |
                                black_block_1
               --------------------------------
                             table
   ```

Now, we can proceed with several different plans. Let's try the following:

2. Stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1 (Now arm is empty)
   Result:
   ```
                        grey_block_2
            brown_block_2    |
                |        purple_block_2
            brown_block_1    |
                |        black_block_1
            grey_block_1
                |
         purple_block_1         
               --------------------------------
                             table
   ```

3. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1 (Now holding brown_block_2)
   Result:
   ```
                        grey_block_2
                            |
                        purple_block_2
            brown_block_1    |
                |        black_block_1
            grey_block_1
                |
         purple_block_1         
               --------------------------------
                             table
   ```

4. Stack brown_block_2 on purple_block_2 (Now arm is empty)
   Result:
   ```
                        grey_block_2
                            |
                        brown_block_2
                            |
                        purple_block_2
            brown_block_1    |
                |        black_block_1
            grey_block_1
                |
         purple_block_1         
               --------------------------------
                             table
   ```

5. Unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1 (Now holding grey_block_2)
   Result:
   ```
                        
                        brown_block_2
                            |
                        purple_block_2
            brown_block_1    |
                |        black_block_1
            grey_block_1
                |
         purple_block_1         
               --------------------------------
                             table
   ```

Hmm, there's a problem again. We're trying to satisfy constraint 4 (brown_block_2 must not be clear) and constraint 5 (if brown_block_2 is not clear, then grey_block_2 must be on the table). But in step 4, brown_block_2 is on top of purple_block_2 and is clear, so constraint 4 is still not satisfied.

Let's continue and find a block to put on top of brown_block_2. We could use grey_block_2:

6. Stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_2 (Now arm is empty)
   Result:
   ```
                        grey_block_2
                            |
                        brown_block_2
                            |
                        purple_block_2
            brown_block_1    |
                |        black_block_1
            grey_block_1
                |
         purple_block_1         
               --------------------------------
                             table
   ```

Now, constraint 4 (brown_block_2 must not be clear) is satisfied. But constraint 5 states that "If brown_block_2 is not clear, then grey_block_2 must be on the table either at the same state or some state after". We need to move grey_block_2 to the table at some point:

7. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2 (Now holding grey_block_2)
   Result:
   ```
                        
                        brown_block_2
                            |
                        purple_block_2
            brown_block_1    |
                |        black_block_1
            grey_block_1
                |
         purple_block_1         
               --------------------------------
                             table
   ```

8. Putdown grey_block_2 (Now arm is empty)
   Result:
   ```
                        
                        brown_block_2
                            |
                        purple_block_2
            brown_block_1    |
                |        black_block_1
            grey_block_1     grey_block_2
                |
         purple_block_1         
               --------------------------------
                             table
   ```

At this point, we've satisfied constraints 1, 3, 4, and 5. We're still missing constraint 2: "If grey_block_1 is not clear, then grey_block_2 must be on top of black_block_1 either at the same state or some state after". We know grey_block_1 is not clear (as it has brown_block_1 on top of it), so we need to place grey_block_2 on top of black_block_1 at some point:

9. Pickup grey_block_2 (Now holding grey_block_2)
   Result:
   ```
                        
                        brown_block_2
                            |
                        purple_block_2
            brown_block_1    |
                |        black_block_1
            grey_block_1     
                |
         purple_block_1         
               --------------------------------
                             table
   ```

10. Stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1 (Now arm is empty)
    Result:
    ```
                        grey_block_2
                            |
                        brown_block_2     black_block_1
                            |
                        purple_block_2
            brown_block_1    
                |        
            grey_block_1     
                |
         purple_block_1         
               --------------------------------
                             table
    ```

Hmm, there's a mistake in my diagram. Let me correct it:

10. Stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1 (Now arm is empty)
    Result:
    ```
                        
                        brown_block_2      grey_block_2
                            |                 |
                        purple_block_2     black_block_1
            brown_block_1    
                |        
            grey_block_1     
                |
         purple_block_1         
               --------------------------------
                             table
    ```

Now, constraint 2 is also satisfied. But wait, our goal is to have black_block_1 clear, and now it has grey_block_2 on top of it. We need to remove grey_block_2:

11. Unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1 (Now holding grey_block_2)
    Result:
    ```
                        
                        brown_block_2      
                            |                 
                        purple_block_2     black_block_1
            brown_block_1    
                |        
            grey_block_1     
                |
         purple_block_1         
               --------------------------------
                             table
    ```

12. Putdown grey_block_2 (Now arm is empty)
    Result:
    ```
                        
                        brown_block_2      
                            |                 
                        purple_block_2     black_block_1
            brown_block_1    
                |             grey_block_2
            grey_block_1     
                |
         purple_block_1         
               --------------------------------
                             table
    ```

Now, black_block_1 is clear (our goal) and all the constraints are satisfied. Let me double-check:

Constraint 1 (grey_block_1 must not be clear): Satisfied in the initial state and maintained, as brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1.
Constraint 2 (If grey_block_1 is not clear, then grey_block_2 must be on top of black_block_1 either at the same state or some state after): Satisfied in step 10.
Constraint 3 (brown_block_2 must be on top of purple_block_2): Satisfied in step 4.
Constraint 4 (brown_block_2 must not be clear): Satisfied in step 6.
Constraint 5 (If brown_block_2 is not clear, then grey_block_2 must be on the table either at the same state or some state after): Satisfied in step 8.
Goal (black_block_1 is clear): Satisfied in step 11.

Great, I think I now have a plan. But let's double-check the preconditions for each action.

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2
   Preconditions:
   - grey_block_2 is on top of brown_block_2 (True in initial state)
   - grey_block_2 is clear (True in initial state)
   - Arm is empty (True in initial state)

2. Stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1
   Preconditions:
   - Arm is holding grey_block_2 (True after step 1)
   - black_block_1 is clear (False in initial state, as purple_block_2 is on top of it)

Oops, we can't do this directly. We need to first clear black_block_1 by removing purple_block_2:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2
2. Putdown grey_block_2
3. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1 (This means we need to get to purple_block_2, which is clear, and remove it from black_block_1)
4. Putdown purple_block_2
5. Pickup grey_block_2
6. Stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1

Hmm, but after that, we still need to get brown_block_2 on top of purple_block_2 (constraint 3). Let me redo the approach:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2
2. Putdown grey_block_2
3. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1
4. Putdown brown_block_2
5. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1
6. Putdown purple_block_2
7. Pickup brown_block_2
8. Stack brown_block_2 on purple_block_2
9. Pickup grey_block_2
10. Stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_2
11. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2
12. Putdown grey_block_2
13. Pickup grey_block_2
14. Stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1
15. Unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1
16. Putdown grey_block_2

But this still may not be the most efficient. Let me try to streamline a bit more.

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2
2. Putdown grey_block_2
3. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1
4. Putdown brown_block_2
5. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1
6. Putdown purple_block_2
7. Pickup brown_block_2
8. Stack brown_block_2 on purple_block_2 (This satisfies constraint 3)
9. Pickup grey_block_2
10. Stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_2 (This satisfies constraint 4)
11. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2
12. Putdown grey_block_2 (This satisfies constraint 5)
13. Pickup grey_block_2
14. Stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1 (This satisfies constraint 2)
15. Unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1
16. Putdown grey_block_2 (This satisfies the goal)

Actually, I'm not sure if the constraint 2 doesn't already get satisfied in the initial state. The constraint says "If grey_block_1 is not clear, then grey_block_2 must be on top of black_block_1 either at the same state or some state after." Grey_block_1 is indeed not clear in the initial state, but grey_block_2 is not on top of black_block_1, it's on top of brown_block_2. So the constraint doesn't seem to be satisfied in the initial state, hence we need to stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1 at some point in our plan.

I think the above plan correctly satisfies all the constraints and reaches the goal. Let's make sure there are no inefficient or redundant steps:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2
2. Putdown grey_block_2
3. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1
4. Putdown brown_block_2
5. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1 (Now black_block_1 is clear, but we haven't satisfied all constraints yet)
6. Putdown purple_block_2
7. Pickup brown_block_2
8. Stack brown_block_2 on purple_block_2 (This satisfies constraint 3)
9. Pickup grey_block_2
10. Stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_2 (This satisfies constraint 4)
11. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2
12. Putdown grey_block_2 (This satisfies constraint 5)
13. Pickup grey_block_2
14. Stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1 (This satisfies constraint 2)
15. Unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1
16. Putdown grey_block_2 (This satisfies the goal)

Actually, I'm noticing we're being redundant in steps 11-16. Grey_block_2 is unstacked, put down, picked up, stacked on black_block_1, unstacked again, and putdown again. We can simplify:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2
2. Stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1 (constraint 2)
3. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1
4. Stack brown_block_2 on purple_block_2 (constraint 3)
5. Unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1
6. Stack grey_block_2 on brown_block_2 (constraint 4)
7. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2
8. Putdown grey_block_2 (grey_block_2 on table, constraint 5)
9. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1 (This is wrong, we stacked grey_block_2 on black_block_1 in step 2).

Ok, there's still a flaw in this approach since after step 2, black_block_1 already has grey_block_2 on top of it.

Hmm, let's look back at the constraints more carefully:

1. At some point, grey_block_1 must not be clear. (This is already satisfied in the initial state)
2. If grey_block_1 is not clear, then grey_block_2 must be on top of black_block_1 either at the same state or some state after. (Given that grey_block_1 is not clear in the initial state, this means that at some point, grey_block_2 must be on top of black_block_1)
3. At some point, brown_block_2 must be on top of purple_block_2.
4. At some point, brown_block_2 must not be clear.
5. If brown_block_2 is not clear, then grey_block_2 must be on the table either at the same state or some state after.

So, the first thing to note is that in the initial state, brown_block_2 is not clear (since grey_block_2 is on top of it). Thus, constraint 4 is already satisfied in the initial state.

Also, given that brown_block_2 is not clear in the initial state, constraint 5 should be observed. It states that either in the current state or some state after, grey_block_2 should be on the table. However, in the initial state, grey_block_2 is not on the table; it's on top of brown_block_2.

So, at some point in our plan, grey_block_2 must be placed on the table.

Let's restart with a cleaner approach:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2
2. Putdown grey_block_2 (This ensures constraint 5 is satisfied, given that brown_block_2 is not clear in the initial state)
3. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1 (Note: We need to first clear the path to purple_block_2, but actually it's already clear in the initial state)
4. Putdown purple_block_2
5. Pickup brown_block_2
6. Stack brown_block_2 on purple_block_2 (This ensures constraint 3 is satisfied)
7. Pickup grey_block_2
8. Stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1 (This ensures constraint 2 is satisfied)
9. Unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1
10. Putdown grey_block_2 (This ensures the goal is satisfied, which is "black_block_1 is clear")

But how do we get to purple_block_2 in step 3? It's on top of black_block_1 and doesn't have any block on top of it. So, we can directly unstack it. But actually we still need to check for proper preconditions.

Checking preconditions for the plan:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2
   Preconditions:
   - grey_block_2 is on top of brown_block_2 (True in initial state)
   - grey_block_2 is clear (True in initial state)
   - Arm is empty (True in initial state)
   Effects:
   - Arm is holding grey_block_2
   - grey_block_2 is no longer on top of brown_block_2
   - brown_block_2 is clear

2. Putdown grey_block_2
   Preconditions:
   - Arm is holding grey_block_2 (True after step 1)
   Effects:
   - grey_block_2 is on the table
   - grey_block_2 is clear
   - Arm is empty

3. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1
   Preconditions:
   - purple_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 (True in initial state)
   - purple_block_2 is clear (True in initial state)
   - Arm is empty (True after step 2)
   Effects:
   - Arm is holding purple_block_2
   - purple_block_2 is no longer on top of black_block_1
   - black_block_1 is clear

4. Putdown purple_block_2
   Preconditions:
   - Arm is holding purple_block_2 (True after step 3)
   Effects:
   - purple_block_2 is on the table
   - purple_block_2 is clear
   - Arm is empty

5. Pickup brown_block_2
   Preconditions:
   - brown_block_2 is on the table (Not true yet. After step 1, brown_block_2 is still on top of brown_block_1)
   - brown_block_2 is clear (True after step 1)
   - Arm is empty (True after step 4)

Hmm, the precondition check fails at step 5. After step 1, brown_block_2 is still on top of brown_block_1, not on the table. 

Let's adjust:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2
2. Putdown grey_block_2
3. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1
4. Putdown brown_block_2
5. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1
6. Putdown purple_block_2
7. Pickup brown_block_2
8. Stack brown_block_2 on purple_block_2 (This satisfies constraint 3)
9. Pickup grey_block_2
10. Stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1 (This satisfies constraint 2)
11. Unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1
12. Putdown grey_block_2 (This ensures the goal is satisfied, which is "black_block_1 is clear")

Let's check the preconditions for the entire plan:

    Effects:

    - grey_block_2 is clear
    - Arm is empty

Now, let's check if we've met all the constraints:

1. "At some point, grey_block_1 must not be clear." This is already met in the initial state where brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1.
2. "If grey_block_1 is not clear, then grey_block_2 must be on top of black_block_1 either at the same state or some state after." This is met in step 10.
3. "At some point, brown_block_2 must be on top of purple_block_2." This is met in step 8.
4. "At some point, brown_block_2 must not be clear." This is met in the initial state where grey_block_2 is on top of brown_block_2.
5. "If brown_block_2 is not clear, then grey_block_2 must be on the table either at the same state or some state after." This is met in step 2.

And our goal is to have black_block_1 clear, which is met in steps 5 and 11.

I think this plan works. But let's see if we can make it more efficient.

Given that we need to:
1. Remove purple_block_2 from black_block_1 to make it clear.
2. Put grey_block_2 on black_block_1 at some point (constraint 2).
3. Ensure brown_block_2 is on top of purple_block_2 at some point (constraint 3).
4. Have brown_block_2 not clear at some point (constraint 4, which is satisfied in the initial state).
5. Put grey_block_2 on the table at some point (constraint 5, given that brown_block_2 is not clear in the initial state).

We could do:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2
2. Putdown grey_block_2 (Satisfies constraint 5)
3. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1 (Now black_block_1 is clear, but we still need to meet other constraints)
4. Putdown purple_block_2
5. Pickup grey_block_2
6. Stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1 (Satisfies constraint 2)
7. Unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1
8. Putdown grey_block_2
9. Pickup brown_block_2
10. Stack brown_block_2 on purple_block_2 (Satisfies constraint 3)

But wait, in step 9, we're trying to pickup brown_block_2, but it's still on top of brown_block_1. We need to unstack it first:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2
2. Putdown grey_block_2 (Satisfies constraint 5)
3. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1
4. Putdown brown_block_2
5. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1 (Now black_block_1 is clear, but we still need to meet other constraints)
6. Putdown purple_block_2
7. Pickup grey_block_2
8. Stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1 (Satisfies constraint 2)
9. Unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1
10. Putdown grey_block_2
11. Pickup brown_block_2
12. Stack brown_block_2 on purple_block_2 (Satisfies constraint 3)

And this would work. But I'm noticing we're putting grey_block_2 on black_block_1 and then immediately removing it.

Actually, my concern with the previous plan is that we're potentially doing redundant operations. Let's reconsider the constraints. Constraint 4 (brown_block_2 must not be clear) is already satisfied in the initial state. So we might not need to pile anything on top of brown_block_2 in our plan.

Given the constraints and the goal, here's a more streamlined plan:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2
2. Putdown grey_block_2 (This ensures constraint 5 is satisfied, given that brown_block_2 is not clear in the initial state)
3. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1
4. Putdown brown_block_2
5. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1
6. Putdown purple_block_2
7. Pickup grey_block_2
8. Stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1 (This ensures constraint 2 is satisfied)
9. Pickup brown_block_2
10. Stack brown_block_2 on purple_block_2 (This ensures constraint 3 is satisfied)
11. Unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1
12. Putdown grey_block_2 (This ensures the goal is satisfied, which is "black_block_1 is clear")

Actually, this seems to be the same as our previous plan. The only difference is the order of some operations, so we'd need to check if preconditions for each operation are met. 

Let's do one more check of preconditions for the more streamlined plan:

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2
   Preconditions:
   - grey_block_2 is on top of brown_block_2 (True in initial state)
   - grey_block_2 is clear (True in initial state)
   - Arm is empty (True in initial state)
   Effects:
   - Arm is holding grey_block_2
   - grey_block_2 is no longer on top of brown_block_2
   - brown_block_2 is clear

2. Putdown grey_block_2
   Preconditions:
   - Arm is holding grey_block_2 (True after step 1)
   Effects:
   - grey_block_2 is on the table
   - grey_block_2 is clear
   - Arm is empty

3. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1
   Preconditions:
   - brown_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1 (True in initial state)
   - brown_block_2 is clear (True after step 1)
   - Arm is empty (True after step 2)
   Effects:
   - Arm is holding brown_block_2
   - brown_block_2 is no longer on top of brown_block_1
   - brown_block_1 is clear

4. Putdown brown_block_2
   Preconditions:
   - Arm is holding brown_block_2 (True after step 3)
   Effects:
   - brown_block_2 is on the table
   - brown_block_2 is clear
   - Arm is empty

5. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1
   Preconditions:
   - purple_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 (True in initial state)
   - purple_block_2 is clear (True in initial state)
   - Arm is empty (True after step 4)
   Effects:
   - Arm is holding purple_block_2
   - purple_block_2 is no longer on top of black_block_1
   - black_block_1 is clear

6. Putdown purple_block_2
   Preconditions:
   - Arm is holding purple_block_2 (True after step 5)
   Effects:
   - purple_block_2 is on the table
   - purple_block_2 is clear
   - Arm is empty

7. Pickup grey_block_2
   Preconditions:
   - grey_block_2 is on the table (True after step 2)
   - grey_block_2 is clear (True after step 2)
   - Arm is empty (True after step 6)
   Effects:
   - Arm is holding grey_block_2
   - grey_block_2 is no longer on the table

8. Stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1
   Preconditions:
   - Arm is holding grey_block_2 (True after step 7)
   - black_block_1 is clear (True after step 5)
   Effects:
   - grey_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
   - grey_block_2 is clear
   - black_block_1 is not clear
   - Arm is empty

9. Pickup brown_block_2
   Preconditions:
   - brown_block_2 is on the table (True after step 4)
   - brown_block_2 is clear (True after step 4)
   - Arm is empty (True after step 8)
   Effects:
   - Arm is holding brown_block_2
   - brown_block_2 is no longer on the table

10. Stack brown_block_2 on purple_block_2
    Preconditions:
    - Arm is holding brown_block_2 (True after step 9)
    - purple_block_2 is clear (True after step 6)
    Effects:
    - brown_block_2 is on top of purple_block_2
    - brown_block_2 is clear
    - purple_block_2 is not clear
    - Arm is empty

11. Unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1
    Preconditions:
    - grey_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 (True after step 8)
    - grey_block_2 is clear (True after step 8)
    - Arm is empty (True after step 10)
    Effects:
    - Arm is holding grey_block_2
    - grey_block_2 is no longer on top of black_block_1
    - black_block_1 is clear

12. Putdown grey_block_2
    Preconditions:
    - Arm is holding grey_block_2 (True after step 11)
    Effects:
    - grey_block_2 is on the table
    - grey_block_2 is clear
    - Arm is empty

All preconditions are met for each action. Let's ensure all constraints and the goal are satisfied:

1. "At some point, grey_block_1 must not be clear." This is met in the initial state where brown_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1.
2. "If grey_block_1 is not clear, then grey_block_2 must be on top of black_block_1 either at the same state or some state after." This is met in step 8.
3. "At some point, brown_block_2 must be on top of purple_block_2." This is met in step 10.
4. "At some point, brown_block_2 must not be clear." This is met in the initial state where grey_block_2 is on top of brown_block_2.
5. "If brown_block_2 is not clear, then grey_block_2 must be on the table either at the same state or some state after." This is met in step 2.

And our goal is to have black_block_1 clear, which is met in steps 5 and 11.

The plan seems to be optimal in terms of the number of actions. I think this final plan works correctly and efficiently.

1. Unstack grey_block_2 from brown_block_2
2. Putdown grey_block_2
3. Unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1
4. Putdown brown_block_2
5. Unstack purple_block_2 from black_block_1
6. Putdown purple_block_2
7. Pickup grey_block_2
8. Stack grey_block_2 on black_block_1
9. Pickup brown_block_2
10. Stack brown_block_2 on purple_block_2
11. Unstack grey_block_2 from black_block_1
12. Putdown grey_block_2
