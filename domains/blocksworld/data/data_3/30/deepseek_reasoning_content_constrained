Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get the robotic arm holding purple_block_1, while satisfying all the given constraints. Let me first understand the initial state and the constraints.

Initial State:
- purple_block_1 is on the table, with purple_block_2 on top of it. So purple_block_1 is under purple_block_2. Since purple_block_2 is clear, that means nothing is on top of it.
- black_block_1 is on the table with black_block_2 on top. Both are clear.
- white_block_1, grey_block_1, and brown_block_1 are all on the table and clear.
- The arm is empty.

Goal:
- The arm must be holding purple_block_1.

Constraints:
1. At some point, purple_block_1 must be clear. That means we need to remove purple_block_2 from it. But since the constraint requires this condition to hold in at least one state, and the initial state already has purple_block_1 not clear (because purple_block_2 is on it). Wait, waitâ€”the initial state says purple_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1. So in the initial state, purple_block_1 is not clear. The first constraint requires that at some state, purple_block_1 is clear. So we have to make sure that during the plan, purple_block_1 becomes clear. But since the goal is to hold purple_block_1, we have to unstack purple_block_2 from it first. So when we unstack purple_block_2, that would make purple_block_1 clear. So maybe that's when the first constraint is satisfied.

2. If purple_block_1 is clear in any state, then in an earlier state, either the arm is holding brown_block_1 or black_block_1 is clear. The initial state: black_block_1 has black_block_2 on top, so black_block_1 is not clear. So to satisfy this, before making purple_block_1 clear (which happens when we unstack purple_block_2 from it), we need to have either held brown_block_1 or made black_block_1 clear. Since black_block_1 is under black_block_2, making black_block_1 clear would require moving black_block_2. But how does that relate? Let's think: when we unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1, that action's preconditions require that purple_block_2 is clear (which it is) and the arm is empty. After unstacking, purple_block_1 becomes clear. So the state after unstacking satisfies the first constraint. Therefore, before that state, there must be a state where either the arm held brown_block_1 or black_block_1 was clear. Let's see: the unstacking of purple_block_2 would be the action that makes purple_block_1 clear. The state before that action is the initial state. In the initial state, black_block_1 is not clear (since black_block_2 is on it). So to satisfy the implication, before the unstack, we need to have either held brown_block_1 or made black_block_1 clear. But how? Since the initial state doesn't have black_block_1 clear, we need to make it clear. To make black_block_1 clear, we need to remove black_block_2 from it. So perhaps we need to first unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1, which would make black_block_1 clear. Then, when we later unstack purple_block_2, the condition is met because in the prior step (after unstacking black_block_2), black_block_1 is clear. Alternatively, we could pick up brown_block_1 at some point before unstacking purple_block_2. Let's see which is more efficient.

3. At least one state must have the arm holding grey_block_1. So somewhere in the plan, we need to have a pickup or unstack action that results in holding grey_block_1.

4. Every state must have purple_block_2 not on the table. Since in the initial state, purple_block_2 is on purple_block_1 (not the table), and we need to ensure that throughout the plan, purple_block_2 is never placed on the table. So any putdown of purple_block_2 is forbidden. So when we unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1, we can't put it down. We have to stack it somewhere else. But the goal is to hold purple_block_1. Let's see.

The goal is to have the arm holding purple_block_1. To do that, we need to first unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1, then pick up purple_block_1. But since after unstacking purple_block_2, the arm is holding it. So after unstacking, we need to putdown or stack it somewhere. But constraint 4 says purple_block_2 can't be on the table in any state. So we can't put it down. So we must stack it on another block. So we need to find a place to stack purple_block_2.

Possible steps:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1. This makes black_block_1 clear. Then, stack black_block_2 somewhere else. But where? Maybe on brown_block_1. But that would require that brown_block_1 is clear. Which it is. So:

Action: unstack black_block_2 black_block_1. Preconditions: black_block_2 is on black_block_1, black_block_2 is clear, arm is empty. All true. After unstacking, arm holds black_block_2, black_block_1 is clear.

Then, stack black_block_2 on brown_block_1. Now, black_block_2 is on brown_block_1. Then, black_block_1 remains clear. Now, when we later unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1, the prior state where black_block_1 is clear satisfies the second constraint. So that's good.

But then, we need to handle the grey_block_1 constraint. We need to hold grey_block_1 at some point. So maybe after handling purple_block_2, but before picking up purple_block_1, we have to pick up grey_block_1. But that would require putting down purple_block_2 first. Wait, but purple_block_2 can't be put on the table. So after unstacking purple_block_2, we have to stack it somewhere. Let's see.

So here's a possible plan outline:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1. Now holding black_block_2. Black_block_1 is clear.

2. Stack black_block_2 on brown_block_1. Now black_block_2 is on brown_block_1. Arm is empty.

3. Now, handle the grey_block_1 constraint. We need to pick up grey_block_1. Since it's on the table and clear. So:

Pickup grey_block_1. Then put it down again. But this would satisfy the constraint of holding it. So:

3. Pickup grey_block_1. Now holding it.

4. Putdown grey_block_1. Now arm is empty, grey_block_1 is back on table. But now, the state where we held grey_block_1 is covered.

But maybe there's a more optimal way. Since the plan needs to be as short as possible, maybe combining steps.

Wait, but after stacking black_block_2 on brown_block_1, maybe next step is to unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1. Let's see:

But before unstacking purple_block_2, we need to ensure that when we do that, the prior state (before the unstack) has either held brown_block_1 or black_block_1 is clear. Since we made black_block_1 clear in step 1, and after step 2, black_block_1 remains clear (stacking black_block_2 on brown doesn't affect black_block_1). So when we unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1, the state before that (step 2) has black_block_1 clear. So that satisfies the second constraint.

So steps:

1. Unstack black_block_2 black_block_1. Now holding black_block_2. Black_block_1 clear.

2. Stack black_block_2 brown_block_1. Now arm empty. Black_block_2 on brown_block_1.

3. Unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1. Now holding purple_block_2. Purple_block_1 is clear. This satisfies constraint 1 (purple_block_1 clear). The prior state (step 2) has black_block_1 clear, so satisfies the implication.

4. Now, need to place purple_block_2 somewhere, but can't put it on the table. So stack it on another block. Let's see available blocks: white_block_1, grey_block_1, black_block_1, or black_block_2 (but black_block_2 is on brown_block_1). Let's choose white_block_1, which is clear.

So stack purple_block_2 white_block_1. Now purple_block_2 is on white_block_1. Arm is empty.

5. Now, pick up purple_block_1. Since it's on the table and clear (from step 3). So:

Pickup purple_block_1. Now holding it. Goal achieved.

But wait, step 3 requires that we unstack purple_block_2, which makes purple_block_1 clear. Then step 5 is pickup purple_block_1. But the pickup action's preconditions are: block is on table, clear, and arm empty. Purple_block_1 is on table (yes), clear (yes, after step 3). So pickup is possible.

But wait, in step 3 after unstacking, purple_block_1 is on table and clear. So step 5 is valid.

But wait, after step 4, the arm is empty. So step 5 is pickup purple_block_1. That would work.

But we need to check the constraints:

- Constraint 3: holding grey_block_1. But in the above steps, we haven't held grey_block_1. So we need to insert that somewhere.

So steps 1-5 don't include that. So we need to add steps where the arm holds grey_block_1. Let's see.

After step 2 (stack black_block_2 on brown_block_1), the arm is empty. Then, maybe:

3. Pickup grey_block_1. Now holding it. (Satisfies constraint 3.)

4. Putdown grey_block_1. Now arm is empty again.

5. Then proceed with unstacking purple_block_2.

But that adds two steps. However, maybe there's a way to combine this. Alternatively, perhaps during the process, after step 2, we can pick up grey_block_1 and then put it down, then proceed.

So revised steps:

1. Unstack black_block_2 black_block_1.

2. Stack black_block_2 brown_block_1.

3. Pickup grey_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 3.)

4. Putdown grey_block_1.

5. Unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1. Now holding purple_block_2.

6. Stack purple_block_2 white_block_1.

7. Pickup purple_block_1. Done.

This would be 7 steps. But is there a way to make it shorter?

Alternatively, perhaps after step 2, stack black_block_2 on grey_block_1. Then, when we need to pick up grey_block_1, we have to unstack black_block_2. But that complicates things.

Wait, but constraint 3 only requires that the arm holds grey_block_1 at least once. So during the plan, we need to have an action where we pick up grey_block_1. Let's see: if in step 3, after step 2, we pick up grey_block_1, then put it down. That adds two steps. But maybe after unstacking purple_block_2, we can stack it on grey_block_1, but then we have to unstack it again. Hmm, but that might not be optimal.

Alternatively, during step 3, after stacking black_block_2 on brown_block_1, maybe pickup grey_block_1, stack it somewhere, then proceed. But that could be more steps. Let's think.

Wait, the minimal steps would require handling the constraints with as few steps as possible. Let's outline again:

The required steps to achieve the goal:

- Unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1.

- Stack purple_block_2 somewhere (not table).

- Pickup purple_block_1.

But before unstacking purple_block_2, we need to satisfy the constraint that either the arm held brown_block_1 or black_block_1 is clear. By unstacking black_block_2 first, we make black_block_1 clear. So steps 1 and 2 are necessary.

Then, handling grey_block_1 requires at least two steps (pickup and putdown). So adding those steps. So total steps would be:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1.

2. Stack black_block_2 on brown_block_1.

3. Pickup grey_block_1.

4. Putdown grey_block_1.

5. Unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1.

6. Stack purple_block_2 on white_block_1.

7. Pickup purple_block_1.

That's 7 steps. But maybe there's a way to combine steps. For example, after step 2, stack black_block_2 on grey_block_1, which would require unstacking it later. Hmm, but that might not help.

Alternatively, after unstacking purple_block_2 (step 5), instead of stacking it on white_block_1, stack it on grey_block_1. Then, when we need to pickup grey_block_1, we have to unstack purple_block_2 from it, but that would require an additional step. But that might not be optimal.

Wait, but maybe we can use the stacking of purple_block_2 on grey_block_1 as a way to satisfy the grey_block_1 pickup. Let me see:

Alternative plan:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1.

2. Stack black_block_2 on brown_block_1.

3. Unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1. Now holding purple_block_2.

4. Stack purple_block_2 on grey_block_1. Now arm is empty, and grey_block_1 has purple_block_2 on top.

5. Unstack purple_block_2 from grey_block_1. Now holding purple_block_2 again.

6. Stack purple_block_2 on white_block_1.

7. Pickup grey_block_1. Now holding grey_block_1. Satisfies constraint 3.

8. Putdown grey_block_1.

9. Pickup purple_block_1.

But this is way longer. So not optimal. So original 7 steps are better.

But maybe there's another way. Let's think again.

Wait, after unstacking black_block_2 and stacking it on brown_block_1 (steps 1 and 2), we need to handle the grey_block_1 constraint. So steps 3 and 4 (pickup and putdown grey_block_1) add two steps. Then steps 5-7: unstack, stack, pickup. Total 7 steps.

Is there a way to incorporate holding grey_block_1 into the main plan? For example, after stacking purple_block_2 on white_block_1, can we then pick up grey_block_1 and then purple_block_1? But that would require putting down grey_block_1 again, adding steps.

Alternatively, can we use the grey_block_1 as a temporary holder for purple_block_2, thus necessitating an unstack which would involve holding grey_block_1? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe during the unstacking of purple_block_2, we need to stack it on something. If we stack it on grey_block_1, then later we can unstack it, but that requires holding grey_block_1. Wait, no. Unstacking purple_block_2 from grey_block_1 would require holding purple_block_2 again. Not helpful.

Alternatively, after stacking purple_block_2 on white_block_1, then pick up grey_block_1 (since it's clear), and then put it down. That would add two steps. So steps:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1.

2. Stack black_block_2 on brown_block_1.

3. Unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1.

4. Stack purple_block_2 on white_block_1.

5. Pickup grey_block_1.

6. Putdown grey_block_1.

7. Pickup purple_block_1.

But this is 7 steps. However, in this case, the state where purple_block_1 is clear is after step 3 (unstacking). The prior state (step 2) has black_block_1 clear, which satisfies the implication. So the first constraint is satisfied. The constraint on grey_block_1 is satisfied in step 5. The purple_block_2 is never on the table (steps 3 and 4 involve stacking it on white_block_1). So this seems to work. But wait, the step 5 (pickup grey_block_1) requires that grey_block_1 is clear. After step 4, white_block_1 has purple_block_2 on it, but grey_block_1 is still on the table and clear (since we didn't touch it). So yes, pickup is possible.

But in this plan, the steps are:

1. Unstack black_block_2 black_block_1.

2. Stack black_block_2 brown_block_1.

3. Unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1.

4. Stack purple_block_2 white_block_1.

5. Pickup grey_block_1.

6. Putdown grey_block_1.

7. Pickup purple_block_1.

That's 7 steps, and meets all constraints. But is there a way to shorten this?

Wait, what if after stacking black_block_2 on brown_block_1 (step 2), we pick up grey_block_1, then put it down, then proceed. So steps:

1. Unstack black_block_2 black_block_1.

2. Stack black_block_2 brown_block_1.

3. Pickup grey_block_1.

4. Putdown grey_block_1.

5. Unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1.

6. Stack purple_block_2 white_block_1.

7. Pickup purple_block_1.

Same 7 steps. So no difference.

Alternatively, can we do the grey_block_1 pickup earlier? Like after unstacking black_block_2 but before stacking it. Like:

1. Unstack black_block_2 black_block_1.

2. Pickup grey_block_1. (But arm is holding black_block_2, can't pickup. So no.)

So no, can't do that.

Another angle: the constraint requires that in some state, the arm is holding grey_block_1. So even if we pick it up and then immediately put it down, that's two steps. So unavoidable.

Is there a way to use the grey_block_1 as part of the main plan to reduce steps? For example, after unstacking purple_block_2, stack it on grey_block_1, then unstack it and stack somewhere else, but that adds steps.

Alternatively, perhaps we can stack purple_block_2 on grey_block_1. Then, when we need to pickup grey_block_1, we have to unstack purple_block_2. But that would require:

After step 3 (unstack purple_block_2), stack it on grey_block_1 (step4).

Then, to pick up grey_block_1, you need to unstack purple_block_2 (step5), then put it somewhere else (step6), then pick up grey_block_1 (step7), etc. That's more steps.

So not better.

So perhaps the minimal plan is 7 steps. But let's check if there's a shorter path.

Wait, what if after unstacking purple_block_2, instead of stacking it on white_block_1, stack it on black_block_1. Then, black_block_1 is clear (from step 1). So stack purple_block_2 on black_block_1. Then, we can proceed to pickup purple_block_1.

But then, after stacking purple_block_2 on black_block_1, purple_block_2 is on black_block_1. That's allowed. Then, steps:

1. Unstack black_block_2 black_block_1.

2. Stack black_block_2 brown_block_1.

3. Unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1.

4. Stack purple_block_2 black_block_1.

5. Pickup grey_block_1.

6. Putdown grey_block_1.

7. Pickup purple_block_1.

Same number of steps.

Alternatively, after stacking purple_block_2 on black_block_1, maybe we can pick up grey_block_1, then stack it on purple_block_2. But that would require grey_block_1 to be clear. But after step 4, black_block_1 has purple_block_2, which is clear. So grey_block_1 is still on the table and clear. So steps 5 and 6 can be done.

But no reduction.

Hmm. So seems like 7 steps is the minimal. But wait, maybe there's a way to avoid stacking black_block_2 on brown_block_1. Let's think: the reason we stacked black_block_2 on brown_block_1 is to satisfy the constraint that when we unstack purple_block_2, the prior state must have either held brown_block_1 or black_block_1 clear. If we don't stack black_block_2, but instead put it down, but that would require putdown, which is allowed. But then black_block_2 is on the table. But the constraint for purple_block_2 is that it's never on the table. Wait, no, the constraint is only for purple_block_2. Other blocks can be on the table. So after unstacking black_block_2 from black_block_1, we could put it down. Then black_block_1 is clear. But when we unstack purple_block_2, the prior state would have black_block_1 clear. So that satisfies the constraint.

So alternative plan:

1. Unstack black_block_2 black_block_1.

2. Putdown black_block_2. Now black_block_2 is on table.

3. Now, black_block_1 is clear. Then unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1.

4. Stack purple_block_2 white_block_1.

5. Pickup grey_block_1.

6. Putdown grey_block_1.

7. Pickup purple_block_1.

But this plan has 7 steps as well. However, step 2 is putdown, which allows black_block_2 to be on the table. But the constraint only prohibits purple_block_2 from being on the table. So this is acceptable.

But in this case, after step 2, black_block_2 is on the table, but that's allowed. Then, when we unstack purple_block_2 (step3), the prior state (step2) has black_block_1 clear, which satisfies the second constraint. So this works.

But in this plan, steps are:

1. Unstack black_block_2 black_block_1.

2. Putdown black_block_2.

3. Unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1.

4. Stack purple_block_2 white_block_1.

5. Pickup grey_block_1.

6. Putdown grey_block_1.

7. Pickup purple_block_1.

Same number of steps. But maybe this is better because stacking takes two steps (unstack and stack) but here, putdown is one step. Wait, no: unstack black_block_2 and putdown is two steps, same as unstack and stack.

So no difference in steps. But perhaps this is more optimal? Or not.

Alternatively, after unstacking black_block_2, put it down, then proceed. But in this case, the black_block_2 is on the table, which is allowed. So steps 1-7 same as before.

But both plans have 7 steps. So perhaps 7 steps is the minimal.

But wait, maybe we can combine steps. Let's see:

Is there a way to hold grey_block_1 during the process of moving purple_block_2. For example, after unstacking purple_block_2, stack it on grey_block_1, then unstack it again. But that would require:

3. Unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1.

4. Stack purple_block_2 grey_block_1.

5. Unstack purple_block_2 grey_block_1. Now holding purple_block_2 again.

6. Stack purple_block_2 white_block_1.

7. Pickup grey_block_1. Now holding it.

8. Putdown grey_block_1.

9. Pickup purple_block_1.

But this adds two more steps (total 9). Not better.

Hmm.

Another idea: After step 2 (putdown black_block_2), then pick up grey_block_1 (step3), put it down (step4), then unstack purple_block_2. So:

1. Unstack black_block_2 black_block_1.

2. Putdown black_block_2.

3. Pickup grey_block_1.

4. Putdown grey_block_1.

5. Unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1.

6. Stack purple_block_2 white_block_1.

7. Pickup purple_block_1.

This is 7 steps, same as before. But in this plan, the grey_block_1 is picked up before unstacking purple_block_2. So during step3, the arm holds grey_block_1, satisfying constraint3. Then steps proceed. This would work.

So the plan would be:

```
1. Unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
2. Putdown black_block_2
3. Pickup grey_block_1
4. Putdown grey_block_1
5. Unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
6. Stack purple_block_2 white_block_1
7. Pickup purple_block_1
```

But wait, in step5, when we unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1, the prior state (step4) must have either held brown_block_1 or black_block_1 is clear. In step4, the state after putdown grey_block_1, black_block_1 is clear (since we unstacked black_block_2 in step1 and put it down in step2). So yes, black_block_1 is clear in step4. So when we unstack purple_block_2 in step5, the prior state (step4) has black_block_1 clear, satisfying the constraint.

This plan has 7 steps. But perhaps there's a way to reduce the steps.

Wait, what if after unstacking black_block_2 and putting it down (steps 1 and 2), we can immediately pick up grey_block_1 (step3), then stack it somewhere else, but that requires more steps. Alternatively, pick up grey_block_1 and then use it to stack purple_block_2. For example:

1. Unstack black_block_2 black_block_1.

2. Putdown black_block_2.

3. Pickup grey_block_1.

4. Stack grey_block_1 somewhere, say on black_block_1.

But this requires that black_block_1 is clear, which it is. So:

4. Stack grey_block_1 black_block_1.

Now, grey_block_1 is on black_block_1, and black_block_1 is not clear. Then, to unstack purple_block_2, we need to ensure that black_block_1 is clear? No, but the prior state for unstacking purple_block_2 would be after step4. In that state, black_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top, so it's not clear. So that would violate the constraint that before unstacking purple_block_2, we need to have either held brown_block_1 or black_block_1 clear. But in this case, black_block_1 is not clear. So this path would not satisfy the constraint.

Thus, this approach is invalid.

Another idea: After step3 (pickup grey_block_1), instead of putting it down, stack it on black_block_2. But black_block_2 is on the table, so:

4. Stack grey_block_1 black_block_2.

But black_block_2 is on the table (from step2). So stack grey_block_1 on black_block_2. This would make black_block_2 not clear. Then, when unstacking purple_block_2, the prior state (step4) has black_block_1 clear (from step1). So that's acceptable. Then:

5. Unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1.

6. Stack purple_block_2 white_block_1.

7. Pickup purple_block_1.

But then, step3 and step4 are pickup and stack grey_block_1. This way, the arm holds grey_block_1 (step3), satisfying constraint3. And the total steps are 7.

So plan:

1. Unstack black_block_2 black_block_1.

2. Putdown black_block_2.

3. Pickup grey_block_1.

4. Stack grey_block_1 black_block_2.

5. Unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1.

6. Stack purple_block_2 white_block_1.

7. Pickup purple_block_1.

This is 7 steps as well. And in step3, the arm holds grey_block_1. So constraint3 is satisfied. The unstacking of purple_block_2 in step5 has prior state (step4) where black_block_1 is clear (since step1 unstacked black_block_2, and step4 hasn't affected black_block_1), so satisfies the implication. Purple_block_2 is never on the table. So this works.

But this plan has grey_block_1 stacked on black_block_2, which is on the table. That's allowed.

But this plan is also 7 steps. So no improvement.

So it seems all valid plans require 7 steps. Is there a way to do it in fewer?

Wait, let's think differently. The constraint requires that there's at least one state where purple_block_1 is clear. That happens when we unstack purple_block_2 from it. But what if after unstacking, we putdown purple_block_2. But that's forbidden (constraint4). So no.

Another idea: Instead of moving black_block_2 to satisfy the constraint, can we pick up brown_block_1 at some point before unstacking purple_block_2. Because the second constraint says that if purple_block_1 is clear in any state, then in a prior state, either the arm held brown_block_1 or black_block_1 is clear. So if we can hold brown_block_1 before unstacking purple_block_2, that would satisfy the constraint.

So plan:

1. Pickup brown_block_1. But wait, in the initial state, brown_block_1 is on the table and clear. So pickup is possible. Then put it down.

2. Putdown brown_block_1.

3. Unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1.

4. Stack purple_block_2 white_block_1.

5. Pickup grey_block_1.

6. Putdown grey_block_1.

7. Pickup purple_block_1.

But this would be 7 steps. But does this satisfy the constraints?

Let's check:

- Constraint1: purple_block_1 becomes clear after step3 (unstack). Satisfied.

- Constraint2: Before step3 (unstack), in step2, the arm is empty. But in step1, the arm held brown_block_1. So the prior state (step1) has the arm holding brown_block_1. So the implication is satisfied because in step1, the arm held brown_block_1, which is one of the conditions.

- Constraint3: step5 holds grey_block_1. Satisfied.

- Constraint4: purple_block_2 is never on the table. After step3, it's stacked on white_block_1. Correct.

So this plan is 7 steps as well. But maybe this is shorter? No, same number of steps.

But step1: pickup brown_block_1. Then putdown. Then unstack purple_block_2. But why do we need to putdown brown_block_1? Because to unstack purple_block_2, the arm must be empty. So steps:

1. Pickup brown_block_1.

2. Putdown brown_block_1.

3. Unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1.

4. Stack purple_block_2 white_block_1.

5. Pickup grey_block_1.

6. Putdown grey_block_1.

7. Pickup purple_block_1.

Yes, this plan also works. And the steps are 7.

So there are multiple valid plans with 7 steps. But the user asked for an optimal plan with minimal length. Are there any plans with fewer steps?

Let's see:

In this plan, steps 1 and 2 are handling the constraint by holding brown_block_1. Then steps3-7 as before. So 7 steps.

Alternatively, is there a way to hold brown_block_1 and use it in the plan to reduce steps? For example, stack purple_block_2 on brown_block_1. Let's see:

1. Pickup brown_block_1.

2. Stack brown_block_1 somewhere, but why? Not sure.

Alternatively:

1. Pickup brown_block_1.

2. Stack brown_block_1 on black_block_1. Now, black_block_1 has brown_block_1 on top. Then, unstack purple_block_2.

But this would make black_block_1 not clear. So when we unstack purple_block_2, the prior state would have black_block_1 not clear, but the arm held brown_block_1 in step1, which satisfies the implication. So:

Plan:

1. Pickup brown_block_1.

2. Stack brown_block_1 black_block_1.

3. Unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1.

4. Stack purple_block_2 white_block_1.

5. Pickup grey_block_1.

6. Putdown grey_block_1.

7. Pickup purple_block_1.

But this is still 7 steps. And the brown_block_1 is stacked on black_block_1. But the constraint is satisfied because in step1, the arm held brown_block_1.

So this plan also works.

But in all cases, it's 7 steps. So perhaps that's the minimal.

But wait, can we combine any steps?

For example, in the plan where we pick up brown_block_1 and put it down, then unstack purple_block_2. But after putting down brown_block_1, it's on the table again. But during the unstacking of purple_block_2, the arm is empty, and purple_block_2 is clear. So yes.

But no steps saved.

Another angle: The constraint3 requires that the arm holds grey_block_1 at least once. So we need to have a pickup grey_block_1 action. So two steps: pickup and putdown. Can't avoid that.

Unless we can use grey_block_1 in the main plan. For example, stack purple_block_2 on grey_block_1, then when we need to pickup grey_block_1, we have to unstack purple_block_2. But that adds steps.

Alternatively, after unstacking purple_block_2, stack it on grey_block_1. Then, when we need to pickup grey_block_1, we can't unless we unstack purple_block_2 again, which adds steps.

So no.

Thus, it seems that the minimal plan requires 7 steps. Now, let's check if there's a way to do it in 6 steps.

Suppose we can find a way to satisfy the grey_block_1 constraint without two steps. For example, if during the process of stacking or unstacking, we can hold grey_block_1. But how?

Wait, when we unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1, we are holding purple_block_2. Then, when we stack it on white_block_1, the arm is empty. Then, pickup grey_block_1 and putdown. So that's two steps. But perhaps we can incorporate this into another action.

Alternatively, after stacking purple_block_2 on white_block_1, can we pick up grey_block_1 and then use it to stack somewhere else? But that would require more steps.

Alternatively, after unstacking purple_block_2, instead of stacking it on white_block_1, stack it on grey_block_1. Then, grey_block_1 is under purple_block_2. Then, to pick up grey_block_1, we need to unstack purple_block_2. But that would require:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1.

2. Stack black_block_2 on brown_block_1.

3. Unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1.

4. Stack purple_block_2 on grey_block_1.

5. Unstack purple_block_2 from grey_block_1.

6. Stack purple_block_2 on white_block_1.

7. Pickup grey_block_1.

8. Putdown grey_block_1.

9. Pickup purple_block_1.

This adds steps, so worse.

Hmm. No.

So it seems that 7 steps is the minimal. Now, let's verify one of the plans to ensure all constraints are met.

Take the plan:

1. Unstack black_block_2 black_block_1.

2. Putdown black_block_2.

3. Pickup grey_block_1.

4. Putdown grey_block_1.

5. Unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1.

6. Stack purple_block_2 white_block_1.

7. Pickup purple_block_1.

Checking each step:

Initial state:

- purple_block_1 has purple_block_2 on top. Not clear.

- black_block_1 has black_block_2 on top. Not clear.

Step1: Unstack black_block_2 black_block_1. Preconditions: black_block_2 is on black_block_1, clear, arm empty. All true. After this, arm holds black_block_2, black_block_1 is clear.

Step2: Putdown black_block_2. Now black_block_2 is on table, arm empty. Black_block_1 remains clear.

Step3: Pickup grey_block_1. Preconditions: grey_block_1 is on table, clear, arm empty. Yes. Now holding grey_block_1.

Step4: Putdown grey_block_1. Now grey_block_1 is on table, clear. Arm empty.

Step5: Unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1. Preconditions: purple_block_2 is on purple_block_1, clear, arm empty. Yes. After unstacking, arm holds purple_block_2, purple_block_1 is clear. This satisfies constraint1 (purple_block_1 clear). The prior state (step4) has black_block_1 clear (from step1 and step2). So constraint2 is satisfied.

Step6: Stack purple_block_2 white_block_1. Preconditions: holding purple_block_2 and white_block_1 is clear. Yes. After stacking, white_block_1 has purple_block_2, which is clear. Arm empty.

Step7: Pickup purple_block_1. Preconditions: on table, clear, arm empty. Yes. Now arm holds purple_block_1, goal achieved.

Constraint3: Step3 holds grey_block_1. Satisfied.

Constraint4: purple_block_2 is never on the table. In step5, after unstacking, it's held, then stacked on white_block_1. Correct.

All constraints met. This plan is valid and has 7 steps.

Is there a shorter plan? Let's see if any steps can be omitted.

Wait, after step5 (unstacking purple_block_2), can we directly pick up purple_block_1? No, because the arm is holding purple_block_2. So need to stack or putdown first. But purple_block_2 can't be put down. So step6 is necessary.

Thus, it's impossible to do it in fewer than 7 steps.

Therefore, the optimal plan has 7 steps.
