Alright, let me analyze this planning problem:

Initial state:
- purple_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_1 is on the table
- black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
- purple_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1
- white_block_1 is clear
- grey_block_1 is clear
- brown_block_1 is clear
- black_block_2 is clear
- purple_block_2 is clear
- the arm is not holding any block

Goal:
- The arm is holding purple_block_1

Constraints:
1. At some point, purple_block_1 must be clear
2. If purple_block_1 is clear, then there must be an earlier state where either the arm is holding brown_block_1 or black_block_1 is clear
3. At some point, the arm must be holding grey_block_1
4. In all states, purple_block_2 must not be on the table

Let's break this down step by step. We want to achieve the goal of holding purple_block_1. For that, I need to unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1 and then pick up purple_block_1. However, I need to consider the constraints.

Constraint 1 requires that purple_block_1 must be clear at some point. This would naturally occur after unstacking purple_block_2, so this constraint is easy to satisfy.

Constraint 2 stipulates that if purple_block_1 is clear, there must be an earlier state where either the arm is holding brown_block_1 or black_block_1 is clear. This means I need to make sure that either I'm holding brown_block_1 or black_block_1 is clear before I clear purple_block_1.

Currently, black_block_1 has black_block_2 on top of it, so it's not clear. Let's say I want to make black_block_1 clear before clearing purple_block_1. I need to unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1, and then I need to stack or put down black_block_2 somewhere. But I need to make sure I don't put purple_block_2 on the table due to constraint 4.

Constraint 3 requires that at some point, the arm must be holding grey_block_1. This is a simple constraint to satisfy as I can pick up grey_block_1, and later put it down or stack it.

Constraint 4 requires that purple_block_2 not be on the table in any state. This means after unstacking purple_block_2 from purple_block_1, I must stack it on another block (not put it on the table).

Alright, let me sketch a plan outline:

1. Ensure either I'm holding brown_block_1 or black_block_1 is clear, before clearing purple_block_1.
2. At some point, hold grey_block_1.
3. Clear purple_block_1.
4. Pick up purple_block_1.
5. Ensure purple_block_2 is never on the table.

Let's create a plan:

1. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1 (black_block_1 is now clear, satisfying part of constraint 2)
2. stack black_block_2 grey_block_1 (freeing up the arm to do other actions)
3. pickup grey_block_1 (this satisfies constraint 3, and grey_block_1 has black_block_2 on top of it, so we need to pick up the whole stack)
Hmm, this doesn't make sense. Let me revise.

Actually, in Blocksworld, I can't pick up a block if it has another block on top of it. So I need to be careful with the sequence of actions. Let's reconsider.

1. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1 (this ensures black_block_1 is clear, satisfying part of constraint 2)
2. stack black_block_2 white_block_1 (moving black_block_2 to a temporary location)
3. pickup grey_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 3)
4. stack grey_block_1 black_block_1 (to ensure constraint 4 can be satisfied by stacking purple_block_2 somewhere when needed)
5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1 (clearing purple_block_1, which, due to previous steps, satisfies constraint 2)
6. stack purple_block_2 brown_block_1 (to ensure purple_block_2 is not on the table, satisfying constraint 4)
7. pickup purple_block_1 (achieving the goal)

Let me validate this plan:

1. Initial state: purple_block_1 on table with purple_block_2 on top, white_block_1 on table and clear, grey_block_1 on table and clear, brown_block_1 on table and clear, black_block_1 on table with black_block_2 on top, black_block_2 clear, the arm is empty.
2. After "unstack black_block_2 black_block_1": arm is holding black_block_2, black_block_1 is on the table and clear, the rest of the state is unchanged.
3. After "stack black_block_2 white_block_1": black_block_2 is on top of white_block_1 and clear, white_block_1 is not clear, arm is empty, the rest of the state is unchanged.
4. After "pickup grey_block_1": arm is holding grey_block_1, grey_block_1 is not on the table, the rest of the state is unchanged.
5. After "stack grey_block_1 black_block_1": grey_block_1 is on top of black_block_1 and clear, black_block_1 is not clear, arm is empty, the rest of the state is unchanged.
6. After "unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1": arm is holding purple_block_2, purple_block_1 is on the table and clear, the rest of the state is unchanged.
7. After "stack purple_block_2 brown_block_1": purple_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1 and clear, brown_block_1 is not clear, arm is empty, the rest of the state is unchanged.
8. After "pickup purple_block_1": arm is holding purple_block_1, purple_block_1 is not on the table, the rest of the state is unchanged.

Checking the constraints:
1. "At some point, purple_block_1 must be clear": Satisfied after step 6.
2. "If purple_block_1 is clear, there must be a previous state where arm is holding brown_block_1 or black_block_1 is clear": Satisfied, as black_block_1 is clear in steps 2-4.
3. "At some point, arm must be holding grey_block_1": Satisfied in step 4.
4. "In all states, purple_block_2 must not be on the table": Satisfied, as purple_block_2 is either on top of purple_block_1 or on top of brown_block_1 or in the arm.

So, this plan seems to satisfy all the constraints and achieve the goal. However, constraint 2 is a bit tricky, as it requires a specific temporal ordering: the state where black_block_1 is clear or arm holds brown_block_1 must occur before purple_block_1 is clear.

Let's double-check the temporal ordering in my plan:
- black_block_1 becomes clear in step 2.
- purple_block_1 becomes clear in step 6.

So, the ordering is correct. Also, let me check if I've maintained the necessary conditions for all the actions:

1. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
   - black_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 (initially)
   - black_block_2 is clear (initially)
   - arm is empty (initially)
   This action is valid.

2. stack black_block_2 white_block_1
   - arm holds black_block_2 (after step 1)
   - white_block_1 is clear (initially)
   This action is valid.

3. pickup grey_block_1
   - grey_block_1 is on the table (initially)
   - grey_block_1 is clear (initially)
   - arm is empty (after step 2)
   This action is valid.

4. stack grey_block_1 black_block_1
   - arm holds grey_block_1 (after step 3)
   - black_block_1 is clear (after step 1)
   This action is valid.

5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
   - purple_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1 (initially)
   - purple_block_2 is clear (initially)
   - arm is empty (after step 4)
   This action is valid.

6. stack purple_block_2 brown_block_1
   - arm holds purple_block_2 (after step 5)
   - brown_block_1 is clear (initially)
   This action is valid.

7. pickup purple_block_1
   - purple_block_1 is on the table (initially)
   - purple_block_1 is clear (after step 5)
   - arm is empty (after step 6)
   This action is valid.

All actions in the plan are valid, and all constraints are satisfied. The goal is achieved. The sequence of actions is, therefore:
1. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
2. stack black_block_2 white_block_1
3. pickup grey_block_1
4. stack grey_block_1 black_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
6. stack purple_block_2 brown_block_1
7. pickup purple_block_1

Final plan:
```
unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
stack black_block_2 white_block_1
pickup grey_block_1
stack grey_block_1 black_block_1
unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
stack purple_block_2 brown_block_1
pickup purple_block_1
```

Wait, I need to make sure this is optimal. Let me check if there's a shorter valid plan.

Actually, I can directly satisfy constraint 2 by picking up brown_block_1 before clearing purple_block_1. This would potentially lead to a shorter plan:

1. pickup brown_block_1 (satisfying part of constraint 2)
2. putdown brown_block_1 (freeing up the arm)
3. pickup grey_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 3)
4. putdown grey_block_1 (freeing up the arm)
5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1 (clearing purple_block_1, satisfying constraint 1, and due to step 1, it satisfies constraint 2)
6. stack purple_block_2 brown_block_1 (to ensure purple_block_2 is not on the table, satisfying constraint 4)
7. pickup purple_block_1 (achieving the goal)

Let me analyze this revised plan.

But there's a problem with this approach. Constraint 2 says that if purple_block_1 is clear, there must be an EARLIER state where either the arm is holding brown_block_1 or black_block_1 is clear. But in my modified plan, the arm is not holding brown_block_1 at the time when purple_block_1 is clear (step 5). And black_block_1 is not clear in any state prior to step 5. So, this approach doesn't satisfy constraint 2.

Let's revise the plan again, aiming for the shortest valid sequence:

1. pickup brown_block_1 (satisfying part of constraint 2)
2. stack brown_block_1 black_block_2 (keeping brown_block_1 in a safe place to free the arm)
3. pickup grey_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 3)
4. putdown grey_block_1 (freeing up the arm)
5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1 (clearing purple_block_1, satisfying constraint 1, and due to step 1, it satisfies constraint 2)
6. stack purple_block_2 grey_block_1 (to ensure purple_block_2 is not on the table, satisfying constraint 4)
7. pickup purple_block_1 (achieving the goal)

Let me verify this plan:

1. Initial state: purple_block_1 on table with purple_block_2 on top, white_block_1 on table and clear, grey_block_1 on table and clear, brown_block_1 on table and clear, black_block_1 on table with black_block_2 on top, black_block_2 clear, the arm is empty.
2. After "pickup brown_block_1": arm is holding brown_block_1, brown_block_1 is not on the table, the rest of the state is unchanged.
3. After "stack brown_block_1 black_block_2": brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_2 and clear, black_block_2 is not clear, arm is empty, the rest of the state is unchanged.
4. After "pickup grey_block_1": arm is holding grey_block_1, grey_block_1 is not on the table, the rest of the state is unchanged.
5. After "putdown grey_block_1": grey_block_1 is on the table and clear, arm is empty, the rest of the state is unchanged.
6. After "unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1": arm is holding purple_block_2, purple_block_1 is on the table and clear, the rest of the state is unchanged.
7. After "stack purple_block_2 grey_block_1": purple_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1 and clear, grey_block_1 is not clear, arm is empty, the rest of the state is unchanged.
8. After "pickup purple_block_1": arm is holding purple_block_1, purple_block_1 is not on the table, the rest of the state is unchanged.

Let's check if all constraints are satisfied:

1. "At some point, purple_block_1 must be clear": Purple_block_1 is clear after step 6, satisfying this constraint.
2. "If purple_block_1 is clear, there must be a previous state where arm is holding brown_block_1 or black_block_1 is clear": The arm is holding brown_block_1 in state 2, which is before purple_block_1 is clear in state 6. This satisfies the constraint.
3. "At some point, the arm must be holding grey_block_1": The arm is holding grey_block_1 in state 4, satisfying this constraint.
4. "In all states, purple_block_2 must not be on the table": Purple_block_2 is either on top of purple_block_1, in the arm, or on top of grey_block_1 throughout the plan, satisfying this constraint.

Let's validate the preconditions for each action:

1. pickup brown_block_1
   - brown_block_1 is on the table (initially)
   - brown_block_1 is clear (initially)
   - arm is empty (initially)
   This action is valid.

2. stack brown_block_1 black_block_2
   - arm holds brown_block_1 (after step 1)
   - black_block_2 is clear (initially)
   This action is valid.

3. pickup grey_block_1
   - grey_block_1 is on the table (initially)
   - grey_block_1 is clear (initially)
   - arm is empty (after step 2)
   This action is valid.

4. putdown grey_block_1
   - arm holds grey_block_1 (after step 3)
   This action is valid.

5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
   - purple_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1 (initially)
   - purple_block_2 is clear (initially)
   - arm is empty (after step 4)
   This action is valid.

6. stack purple_block_2 grey_block_1
   - arm holds purple_block_2 (after step 5)
   - grey_block_1 is clear (after step 4)
   This action is valid.

7. pickup purple_block_1
   - purple_block_1 is on the table (initially)
   - purple_block_1 is clear (after step 5)
   - arm is empty (after step 6)
   This action is valid.

Both of these plans (my original and my revised) have 7 steps. Let me see if I can optimize further.

Actually, I think my revised plan is incorrect. When I say "the arm is holding brown_block_1 in state 2," I'm referring to after the action "pickup brown_block_1". But constraint 2 requires the arm to be holding brown_block_1 BEFORE the state where purple_block_1 is clear, not at the same time. So, I need to make sure the state "the arm is holding brown_block_1" occurs before the state "purple_block_1 is clear".

Let's re-verify:
- After action "pickup brown_block_1" (step 1), the arm is holding brown_block_1.
- After action "unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1" (step 5), purple_block_1 is clear.

Indeed, the arm holding brown_block_1 (in step 1) occurs before purple_block_1 is clear (in step 5). So, constraint 2 is satisfied in this plan.

Let me continue thinking to see if I can find a shorter valid plan. 

Actually, instead of putting down grey_block_1 and then stacking purple_block_2 on it, I could directly stack grey_block_1 somewhere and then stack purple_block_2 on that same place, saving a step:

1. pickup brown_block_1 (satisfying part of constraint 2)
2. stack brown_block_1 black_block_2 (keeping brown_block_1 in a safe place to free the arm)
3. pickup grey_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 3)
4. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1 (placing grey_block_1 somewhere to free the arm)
5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1 (clearing purple_block_1, satisfying constraint 1, and due to step 1, it satisfies constraint 2)
6. stack purple_block_2 grey_block_1 (to ensure purple_block_2 is not on the table, satisfying constraint 4)
7. pickup purple_block_1 (achieving the goal)

This plan still has 7 steps, but I'm more confident in its correctness. Let me verify:

1. Initial state: purple_block_1 on table with purple_block_2 on top, white_block_1 on table and clear, grey_block_1 on table and clear, brown_block_1 on table and clear, black_block_1 on table with black_block_2 on top, black_block_2 clear, the arm is empty.
2. After "pickup brown_block_1": arm is holding brown_block_1, brown_block_1 is not on the table, the rest of the state is unchanged.
3. After "stack brown_block_1 black_block_2": brown_block_1 is on top of black_block_2 and clear, black_block_2 is not clear, arm is empty, the rest of the state is unchanged.
4. After "pickup grey_block_1": arm is holding grey_block_1, grey_block_1 is not on the table, the rest of the state is unchanged.
5. After "stack grey_block_1 white_block_1": grey_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 and clear, white_block_1 is not clear, arm is empty, the rest of the state is unchanged.
6. After "unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1": arm is holding purple_block_2, purple_block_1 is on the table and clear, the rest of the state is unchanged.
7. After "stack purple_block_2 grey_block_1": purple_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1 and clear, grey_block_1 is not clear, arm is empty, the rest of the state is unchanged.
8. After "pickup purple_block_1": arm is holding purple_block_1, purple_block_1 is not on the table, the rest of the state is unchanged.

Constraints:
1. "At some point, purple_block_1 must be clear": Purple_block_1 is clear after step 6, satisfying this constraint.
2. "If purple_block_1 is clear, there must be a previous state where arm is holding brown_block_1 or black_block_1 is clear": The arm is holding brown_block_1 in state 2, which is before purple_block_1 is clear in state 6. This satisfies the constraint.
3. "At some point, the arm must be holding grey_block_1": The arm is holding grey_block_1 in state 4, satisfying this constraint.
4. "In all states, purple_block_2 must not be on the table": Purple_block_2 is either on top of purple_block_1, in the arm, or on top of grey_block_1 throughout the plan, satisfying this constraint.

Validation of action preconditions:

1. pickup brown_block_1
   - brown_block_1 is on the table (initially)
   - brown_block_1 is clear (initially)
   - arm is empty (initially)
   This action is valid.

2. stack brown_block_1 black_block_2
   - arm holds brown_block_1 (after step 1)
   - black_block_2 is clear (initially)
   This action is valid.

3. pickup grey_block_1
   - grey_block_1 is on the table (initially)
   - grey_block_1 is clear (initially)
   - arm is empty (after step 2)
   This action is valid.

4. stack grey_block_1 white_block_1
   - arm holds grey_block_1 (after step 3)
   - white_block_1 is clear (initially)
   This action is valid.

5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
   - purple_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1 (initially)
   - purple_block_2 is clear (initially)
   - arm is empty (after step 4)
   This action is valid.

6. stack purple_block_2 grey_block_1
   - arm holds purple_block_2 (after step 5)
   - grey_block_1 is clear (after step 4)
   This action is valid.

7. pickup purple_block_1
   - purple_block_1 is on the table (initially)
   - purple_block_1 is clear (after step 5)
   - arm is empty (after step 6)
   This action is valid.

This plan is valid and seems to be the most efficient with 7 steps. I'm not seeing a way to reduce the number of steps while still satisfying all constraints.

Let me think of an alternative approach using the black_block_1 being clear:

1. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1 (black_block_1 is now clear, satisfying part of constraint 2)
2. stack black_block_2 white_block_1 (placing black_block_2 somewhere to free the arm)
3. pickup grey_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 3)
4. stack grey_block_1 black_block_1 (placing grey_block_1 somewhere to free the arm)
5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1 (clearing purple_block_1, satisfying constraint 1, and due to steps 1-2, it satisfies constraint 2)
6. stack purple_block_2 grey_block_1 (to ensure purple_block_2 is not on the table, satisfying constraint 4)
7. pickup purple_block_1 (achieving the goal)

This plan also has 7 steps. Let's verify:

1. Initial state: purple_block_1 on table with purple_block_2 on top, white_block_1 on table and clear, grey_block_1 on table and clear, brown_block_1 on table and clear, black_block_1 on table with black_block_2 on top, black_block_2 clear, the arm is empty.
2. After "unstack black_block_2 black_block_1": arm is holding black_block_2, black_block_1 is on the table and clear, the rest of the state is unchanged.
3. After "stack black_block_2 white_block_1": black_block_2 is on top of white_block_1 and clear, white_block_1 is not clear, arm is empty, the rest of the state is unchanged.
4. After "pickup grey_block_1": arm is holding grey_block_1, grey_block_1 is not on the table, the rest of the state is unchanged.
5. After "stack grey_block_1 black_block_1": grey_block_1 is on top of black_block_1 and clear, black_block_1 is not clear, arm is empty, the rest of the state is unchanged.
6. After "unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1": arm is holding purple_block_2, purple_block_1 is on the table and clear, the rest of the state is unchanged.
7. After "stack purple_block_2 grey_block_1": purple_block_2 is on top of grey_block_1 and clear, grey_block_1 is not clear, arm is empty, the rest of the state is unchanged.
8. After "pickup purple_block_1": arm is holding purple_block_1, purple_block_1 is not on the table, the rest of the state is unchanged.

Constraints:
1. "At some point, purple_block_1 must be clear": Purple_block_1 is clear after step 6, satisfying this constraint.
2. "If purple_block_1 is clear, there must be a previous state where arm is holding brown_block_1 or black_block_1 is clear": Black_block_1 is clear in states 2-4, which is before purple_block_1 is clear in state 6. This satisfies the constraint.
3. "At some point, the arm must be holding grey_block_1": The arm is holding grey_block_1 in state 4, satisfying this constraint.
4. "In all states, purple_block_2 must not be on the table": Purple_block_2 is either on top of purple_block_1, in the arm, or on top of grey_block_1 throughout the plan, satisfying this constraint.

Validation of action preconditions (as done before), everything checks out.

Both plans (the one using brown_block_1 and the one using black_block_1) are valid and have 7 steps. It seems like we can't go shorter than 7 steps.

Let's however check if we can find a potentially shorter plan by looking at the constraints and goal more closely.

Constraints:
1. Purple_block_1 must be clear at some point.
2. If purple_block_1 is clear, there must be an earlier state where either the arm is holding brown_block_1 or black_block_1 is clear.
3. At some point, the arm must be holding grey_block_1.
4. In all states, purple_block_2 must not be on the table.

The goal is to have the arm holding purple_block_1. For this goal, purple_block_1 must be clear, so constraint 1 will naturally be satisfied. 

Constraint 2 requires an earlier state where either the arm is holding brown_block_1 or black_block_1 is clear.

Constraint 3 requires the arm to hold grey_block_1 at some point.

Constraint 4 is about ensuring purple_block_2 is never on the table.

The minimum steps for these seem to be:
1. Ensure either the arm holds brown_block_1 or black_block_1 is clear.
2. Hold grey_block_1 at some point.
3. Ensure purple_block_2 is never on the table.
4. Clear purple_block_1.
5. Pickup purple_block_1.

Steps 1, 2, 4, and 5 are unavoidable. For step 3, I need to make sure purple_block_2 is never on the table after it's removed from purple_block_1. This means after picking up purple_block_2, I must stack it somewhere.

Let's try a slightly different approach. The arm must hold grey_block_1 at some point. Let's use this to our advantage:

1. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1 (black_block_1 is now clear, satisfying part of constraint 2)
2. stack black_block_2 white_block_1 (moving black_block_2 to free the arm)
3. pickup grey_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 3)
4. stack grey_block_1 black_block_1 (freeing the arm)
5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1 (clearing purple_block_1, satisfying constraint 1, and due to steps 1-2, it satisfies constraint 2)
6. stack purple_block_2 brown_block_1 (to ensure purple_block_2 is not on the table, satisfying constraint 4)
7. pickup purple_block_1 (achieving the goal)

This plan is also 7 steps long.

What if I stack purple_block_2 on purple_block_1 again?
1. unstack black_block_2 black_block_1 (black_block_1 is now clear, satisfying part of constraint 2)
2. stack black_block_2 white_block_1 (moving black_block_2 to free the arm)
3. pickup grey_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 3)
4. stack grey_block_1 black_block_1 (freeing the arm)
5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1 (clearing purple_block_1, satisfying constraint 1, and due to steps 1-2, it satisfies constraint 2)
6. stack purple_block_2 brown_block_1 (to ensure purple_block_2 is not on the table, satisfying constraint 4)
7. pickup purple_block_1 (achieving the goal)

This is also 7 steps. I don't think I can further optimize the plan beyond 7 steps while ensuring all constraints are met.

Actually, we have enough blocks that we don't have to change the configuration for any blocks other than the ones directly involved in the constraints and goal. We can spare white_block_1 and brown_block_1 as temporary locations for black_block_2 and purple_block_2. 

Now, I'm confident that my plan is optimal with 7 steps.

Final confirmed plan:
```
unstack black_block_2 black_block_1
stack black_block_2 white_block_1
pickup grey_block_1
stack grey_block_1 black_block_1
unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
stack purple_block_2 brown_block_1
pickup purple_block_1
```

Actually, I realize there's a direct way to satisfy constraint 2 by picking up brown_block_1 first:

1. pickup brown_block_1 (satisfying part of constraint 2)
2. stack brown_block_1 white_block_1 (placing brown_block_1 somewhere to free the arm)
3. pickup grey_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 3)
4. stack grey_block_1 black_block_1 (placing grey_block_1 somewhere to free the arm)
5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1 (clearing purple_block_1, satisfying constraint 1, and due to step 1, it satisfies constraint 2)
6. stack purple_block_2 black_block_2 (to ensure purple_block_2 is not on the table, satisfying constraint 4)
7. pickup purple_block_1 (achieving the goal)

This gives a 7-step plan that meets all the constraints.

I've now checked several approaches and they all lead to a 7-step plan. I believe this is the optimal solution.

Let me make sure there's no simpler approach I've overlooked.

Constraint 2 requires that if purple_block_1 is clear, there must be an earlier state where either the arm is holding brown_block_1 or black_block_1 is clear.

For the goal, we need to pick up purple_block_1, which means we need to ensure purple_block_1 is clear.

When purple_block_1 is made clear (by unstacking purple_block_2), we must ensure that either the arm is holding brown_block_1 or black_block_1 is clear. 

If I want to rely on the arm holding brown_block_1, I would need to pickup brown_block_1 and then immediately unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1. But this isn't possible because the arm can only hold one block at a time. 

So, I need to ensure that either brown_block_1 has been held by the arm or black_block_1 is clear before clearing purple_block_1. Both approaches lead to a 7-step plan.

Some of my earlier versions of the plan had errors in the validation, but I'm confident that the final plan is correct.
