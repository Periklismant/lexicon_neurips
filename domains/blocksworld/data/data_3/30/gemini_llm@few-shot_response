Okay, let's break this down. We need to pick up purple_block_1, but purple_block_2 is on top of it. We also have some constraints to satisfy along the way.

Here's the plan:

1.  Unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1. This makes purple_block_1 clear.
2.  Putdown purple_block_2. This satisfies the constraint that purple_block_2 is never on the table.
3.  Pickup grey_block_1. This satisfies the constraint that we must hold grey_block_1 at some point.
4.  Putdown grey_block_1.
5.  Unstack black_block_2 from black_block_1. This satisfies the constraint that there must be an earlier state in which "there is no block on top of black_block_1, i.e., black_block_1 is clear" before "there is no block on top of purple_block_1, i.e., purple_block_1 is clear".
6.  Putdown black_block_2.
7.  Pickup brown_block_1. This satisfies the constraint that there must be an earlier state in which "you are holding brown_block_1" before "there is no block on top of purple_block_1, i.e., purple_block_1 is clear".
8.  Putdown brown_block_1.
9.  Pickup purple_block_1. This achieves the goal.
