**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1**: This clears brown_block_1, allowing it to be picked up later.
2. **putdown brown_block_3**: Places brown_block_3 on the table, freeing the arm.
3. **unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1**: Removes the top block from the tower on red_block_1.
4. **putdown brown_block_2**: Prepares to access lower blocks in the tower.
5. **unstack blue_block_1 grey_block_1**: Removes blue_block_1 to access grey_block_1.
6. **putdown blue_block_1**: Frees the arm to handle grey_block_1.
7. **unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1**: Removes grey_block_1, making red_block_1 clear.
8. **stack grey_block_1 red_block_2**: Moves grey_block_1 to red_block_2, ensuring red_block_1 is no longer on the table (satisfies constraint 4 when red_block_1 is later moved).
9. **pickup red_block_1**: Now possible as red_block_1 is clear.
10. **stack red_block_1 blue_block_1**: Moves red_block_1 off the table (satisfies constraints 3 and 4).
11. **pickup red_block_2**: Picks up red_block_2 to stack on brown_block_1.
12. **stack red_block_2 brown_block_1**: Fulfills the conditional requirement for constraint 2 (red_block_2 on brown_block_1).
13. **unstack red_block_2 brown_block_1**: Prepares to pick up brown_block_1.
14. **putdown red_block_2**: Frees the arm.
15. **pickup brown_block_1**: Achieves the goal.

This plan ensures all constraints are met while achieving the goal in the minimal necessary steps.
