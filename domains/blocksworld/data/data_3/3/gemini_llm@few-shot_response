Okay, let's break this down. The goal is to be holding brown_block_1. Currently, brown_block_3 is on top of it. We need to remove brown_block_3. Also, grey_block_1 is on top of red_block_1, and blue_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1, and brown_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1. So we need to unstack all of these.

Here's the plan:

```
```
unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1
putdown brown_block_3
unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1
putdown brown_block_2
unstack blue_block_1 grey_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1
putdown grey_block_1
unstack red_block_1 red_block_2
putdown red_block_1
pickup brown_block_1
```
