Let's analyze this Blocksworld problem:

Initial State:
- brown_block_1 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on the table
- grey_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- red_block_2 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1
- brown_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
- brown_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1
- red_block_2, brown_block_2, brown_block_3 are clear
- not holding any block

Goal State:
- you are holding brown_block_1

Constraints:
1. At some point, grey_block_1 must not be on top of brown_block_3
2. If grey_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_3, then at that state or some subsequent state, either:
   - red_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1, or
   - grey_block_1 is clear
3. At some point, both red_block_1 and red_block_2 are not on the table
4. At some point, red_block_1 is not on the table

Let me visualize the initial state:
```
    brown_block_2
        |
    blue_block_1      brown_block_3
        |                 |
    grey_block_1      brown_block_1     red_block_2
        |
    red_block_1
    _______TABLE_______
```

In the initial state, I observe that:
- Constraint 1 is already satisfied: grey_block_1 is on top of red_block_1, not brown_block_3
- Constraint 2 doesn't apply yet because I don't know if grey_block_1 will ever be on top of brown_block_3
- Constraint 3 is not satisfied: both red blocks are on the table
- Constraint 4 is not satisfied: red_block_1 is on the table

To reach the goal, I need to pick up brown_block_1. But brown_block_3 is on top of it, so I need to move that first.

Let me think about how to satisfy all constraints while reaching the goal:

1. To pick up brown_block_1, I need to first remove brown_block_3 from it
2. I need to make sure that at some point both red_block_1 and red_block_2 are not on the table
3. I need to make sure that at some point red_block_1 is not on the table

Let me create a plan:

1. unstack brown_block_3 from brown_block_1 
2. I'll need to place brown_block_3 somewhere - let's put it on the table for now
3. To satisfy constraints 3 and 4, I need to get both red blocks off the table
4. For red_block_1, I need to first remove the stack above it (unstack brown_block_2, blue_block_1, and grey_block_1)
5. Then I can pick up red_block_1 from the table
6. For red_block_2, I can simply pick it up since it's clear
7. After satisfying constraints 3 and 4, I can finally pick up brown_block_1

Let's execute this plan step by step:

Starting state:
```
    brown_block_2
        |
    blue_block_1      brown_block_3
        |                 |
    grey_block_1      brown_block_1     red_block_2
        |
    red_block_1
    _______TABLE_______
```

1. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1
Now holding brown_block_3, brown_block_1 is clear

2. putdown brown_block_3
brown_block_3 is on the table, not holding anything

3. unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1
Now holding brown_block_2, blue_block_1 is clear

4. putdown brown_block_2
brown_block_2 is on the table, not holding anything

5. unstack blue_block_1 grey_block_1
Now holding blue_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear

6. putdown blue_block_1
blue_block_1 is on the table, not holding anything

7. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1
Now holding grey_block_1, red_block_1 is clear

8. putdown grey_block_1
grey_block_1 is on the table, not holding anything

9. pickup red_block_1
Now holding red_block_1
(This satisfies constraint 4: red_block_1 is not on the table)

10. pickup red_block_2
Wait, I can't do this while holding red_block_1. I need to place red_block_1 somewhere first.

Let's adjust the plan:

9. pickup red_block_1
Now holding red_block_1

10. stack red_block_1 on brown_block_1
red_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1, brown_block_1 is not clear anymore

11. pickup red_block_2
Now holding red_block_2
(At this point, both red_block_1 and red_block_2 are not on the table, satisfying constraint 3)

12. stack red_block_2 on red_block_1
red_block_2 is on top of red_block_1

But now I have a problem: brown_block_1 is not clear, so I can't pick it up. Let me rethink.

Actually, I realize I'm making this too complicated. The goal is simply to hold brown_block_1. Let's focus on that while ensuring we satisfy the constraints:

1. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1
Now holding brown_block_3, brown_block_1 is clear

2. To satisfy constraint 3 (both red blocks off table), I could stack brown_block_3 on red_block_2, then pickup red_block_1 and stack it on brown_block_3. But I'll need a place to put red_block_1 temporarily.

Let me try a different approach:

1. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1
Now holding brown_block_3

2. stack brown_block_3 red_block_2
brown_block_3 on red_block_2, not holding anything

3. pickup red_block_1
Now holding red_block_1
(This satisfies constraint 4)

4. stack red_block_1 brown_block_1
red_block_1 on brown_block_1, not holding anything
(Now brown_block_1 is not clear anymore)

Hmm, now I can't pick up brown_block_1 directly. Let me rethink this.

OK, let me plan carefully to ensure all constraints are met:

1. First, I need to clear brown_block_1 by removing brown_block_3
2. I need to make sure both red blocks are off the table at some point
3. I need to make sure red_block_1 is off the table at some point

Let's try this:

1. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1
Now holding brown_block_3, brown_block_1 is clear

2. stack brown_block_3 red_block_2
brown_block_3 on red_block_2, not holding anything

3. pickup red_block_1
Now holding red_block_1
(This satisfies constraint 4)

4. stack red_block_1 brown_block_3
red_block_1 on brown_block_3, not holding anything
(At this point, both red_block_1 and red_block_2 are not on the table, satisfying constraint 3)

5. pickup brown_block_1
Now holding brown_block_1
(This achieves the goal)

Let me check if this plan satisfies all constraints:

- Constraint 1: grey_block_1 must not be on top of brown_block_3
  - In our initial state, grey_block_1 is on top of red_block_1, not brown_block_3, so this is already satisfied.

- Constraint 2: If grey_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_3, then either red_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1 or grey_block_1 is clear.
  - In our plan, grey_block_1 is never on top of brown_block_3, and in the initial state, grey_block_1 is not clear (it has blue_block_1 on top).
  - We don't place red_block_2 on top of brown_block_1 in our plan.
  - However, after step 7 in our original breakdown, grey_block_1 becomes clear, which satisfies this constraint.

- Constraint 3: At some point, both red_block_1 and red_block_2 are not on the table.
  - In step 4 of our revised plan, red_block_1 is on brown_block_3 and red_block_2 is under brown_block_3, so neither is on the table.

- Constraint 4: At some point, red_block_1 is not on the table.
  - In step 3 of our revised plan, we pick up red_block_1, so it's not on the table.

However, I realize I'm making a mistake in my reasoning. In the initial state, grey_block_1 has blue_block_1 on top of it, so it's not clear. Constraint 2 says that IF grey_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_3 (which is true in the initial state), THEN either red_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1 OR grey_block_1 is clear.

So in the initial state, grey_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_3, but neither is red_block_2 on top of brown_block_1, nor is grey_block_1 clear. This means constraint 2 is not satisfied in the initial state. We need to make sure that at some point, either red_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1 or grey_block_1 is clear.

Let me revise the plan to ensure all constraints are met:

1. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1
Now holding brown_block_3, brown_block_1 is clear

2. stack brown_block_3 red_block_2
brown_block_3 on red_block_2, not holding anything

3. unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1
Now holding brown_block_2, blue_block_1 is clear

4. stack brown_block_2 brown_block_3
brown_block_2 on brown_block_3, not holding anything

5. unstack blue_block_1 grey_block_1
Now holding blue_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear
(This satisfies constraint 2)

6. stack blue_block_1 brown_block_2
blue_block_1 on brown_block_2, not holding anything

7. pickup red_block_1
Now holding red_block_1
(This satisfies constraint 4)

8. stack red_block_1 blue_block_1
red_block_1 on blue_block_1, not holding anything
(At this point, both red_block_1 and red_block_2 are not on the table, satisfying constraint 3)

9. pickup brown_block_1
Now holding brown_block_1
(This achieves the goal)

Let me check if this revised plan satisfies all constraints:

- Constraint 1: grey_block_1 must not be on top of brown_block_3
  - In our initial state and throughout the plan, grey_block_1 is never on top of brown_block_3, so this is satisfied.

- Constraint 2: If grey_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_3, then either red_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1 or grey_block_1 is clear.
  - In step 5 of our plan, grey_block_1 becomes clear, which satisfies this constraint.

- Constraint 3: At some point, both red_block_1 and red_block_2 are not on the table.
  - In step 8 of our plan, red_block_1 is on blue_block_1 and red_block_2 is under brown_block_3, so neither is on the table.

- Constraint 4: At some point, red_block_1 is not on the table.
  - In step 7 of our plan, we pick up red_block_1, so it's not on the table.

So our revised plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal.

Actually, I realize I don't need all those steps. Let me simplify:

1. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1
Now holding brown_block_3, brown_block_1 is clear

2. stack brown_block_3 red_block_2
brown_block_3 on red_block_2, not holding anything

3. unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1
Now holding brown_block_2, blue_block_1 is clear

4. putdown brown_block_2
brown_block_2 on the table, not holding anything

5. unstack blue_block_1 grey_block_1
Now holding blue_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear
(This satisfies constraint 2)

6. stack blue_block_1 brown_block_3
blue_block_1 on brown_block_3, not holding anything

7. pickup red_block_1
Now holding red_block_1
(This satisfies constraint 4)

8. stack red_block_1 blue_block_1
red_block_1 on blue_block_1, not holding anything
(At this point, both red_block_1 and red_block_2 are not on the table, satisfying constraint 3)

9. pickup brown_block_1
Now holding brown_block_1
(This achieves the goal)

This plan is still a bit long. Let me see if I can optimize it further:

1. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1
Now holding brown_block_3, brown_block_1 is clear

2. stack brown_block_3 red_block_2
brown_block_3 on red_block_2, not holding anything

Wait, I think I'm still making it too complicated. Let's focus on the constraints more directly:

Constraint 1: grey_block_1 must not be on top of brown_block_3
- This is satisfied in the initial state

Constraint 2: If grey_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_3 (which is true in the initial state), then either red_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1 or grey_block_1 is clear.
- In the initial state, neither condition is true, so we need to make one of them true

Constraint 3: At some point, both red_block_1 and red_block_2 are not on the table.
- We need to ensure this happens at some point in our plan

Constraint 4: At some point, red_block_1 is not on the table.
- We need to ensure this happens at some point in our plan

So, to satisfy all constraints and reach the goal, we need to:
1. Either put red_block_2 on top of brown_block_1 or make grey_block_1 clear
2. Get both red blocks off the table at some point
3. Get red_block_1 off the table at some point
4. End with holding brown_block_1

Let's try a plan focusing on these requirements:

1. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1
Now holding brown_block_3, brown_block_1 is clear

2. stack brown_block_3 red_block_2
brown_block_3 on red_block_2, not holding anything

3. pickup red_block_2
Oops, can't do this because brown_block_3 is on top of red_block_2.

Let me rethink:

1. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1
Now holding brown_block_3, brown_block_1 is clear

2. putdown brown_block_3
brown_block_3 on the table, not holding anything

3. pickup red_block_2
Now holding red_block_2

4. stack red_block_2 brown_block_1
red_block_2 on brown_block_1, not holding anything
(This satisfies constraint 2)

5. unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1
Now holding brown_block_2, blue_block_1 is clear

6. putdown brown_block_2
brown_block_2 on the table, not holding anything

7. unstack blue_block_1 grey_block_1
Now holding blue_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear
(This also satisfies constraint 2)

8. stack blue_block_1 brown_block_2
blue_block_1 on brown_block_2, not holding anything

9. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1
Now holding grey_block_1, red_block_1 is clear

10. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_1
grey_block_1 on blue_block_1, not holding anything

11. pickup red_block_1
Now holding red_block_1
(This satisfies constraint 4)

12. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1
red_block_1 on grey_block_1, not holding anything

13. unstack red_block_2 brown_block_1
Now holding red_block_2
(At this point, both red_block_1 and red_block_2 are not on the table, satisfying constraint 3)

14. putdown red_block_2
red_block_2 on the table, not holding anything

15. pickup brown_block_1
Now holding brown_block_1
(This achieves the goal)

This plan is quite long, and I think there's a more efficient way to do this.

Let's try another approach:

1. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1
Now holding brown_block_3, brown_block_1 is clear

2. putdown brown_block_3
brown_block_3 on the table, not holding anything

3. unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1
Now holding brown_block_2, blue_block_1 is clear

4. putdown brown_block_2
brown_block_2 on the table, not holding anything

5. unstack blue_block_1 grey_block_1
Now holding blue_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear
(This satisfies constraint 2)

6. putdown blue_block_1
blue_block_1 on the table, not holding anything

7. pickup red_block_2
Now holding red_block_2

8. stack red_block_2 brown_block_1
red_block_2 on brown_block_1, not holding anything
(This also satisfies constraint 2)

9. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1
Now holding grey_block_1, red_block_1 is clear

10. putdown grey_block_1
grey_block_1 on the table, not holding anything

11. pickup red_block_1
Now holding red_block_1
(This satisfies constraint 4)

12. stack red_block_1 red_block_2
red_block_1 on red_block_2, not holding anything
(At this point, both red_block_1 and red_block_2 are not on the table, satisfying constraint 3)

13. unstack red_block_1 red_block_2
Now holding red_block_1

14. putdown red_block_1
red_block_1 on the table, not holding anything

15. unstack red_block_2 brown_block_1
Now holding red_block_2

16. putdown red_block_2
red_block_2 on the table, not holding anything

17. pickup brown_block_1
Now holding brown_block_1
(This achieves the goal)

This plan is still quite long. Let me try to optimize it further:

1. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1
Now holding brown_block_3, brown_block_1 is clear

2. putdown brown_block_3
brown_block_3 on the table, not holding anything

3. unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1
Now holding brown_block_2, blue_block_1 is clear

4. putdown brown_block_2
brown_block_2 on the table, not holding anything

5. unstack blue_block_1 grey_block_1
Now holding blue_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear
(This satisfies constraint 2)

6. stack blue_block_1 brown_block_1
blue_block_1 on brown_block_1, not holding anything

7. pickup red_block_2
Now holding red_block_2

8. stack red_block_2 blue_block_1
red_block_2 on blue_block_1, not holding anything

9. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1
Now holding grey_block_1, red_block_1 is clear

10. stack grey_block_1 red_block_2
grey_block_1 on red_block_2, not holding anything

11. pickup red_block_1
Now holding red_block_1
(This satisfies constraint 4)

12. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1
red_block_1 on grey_block_1, not holding anything
(At this point, both red_block_1 and red_block_2 are not on the table, satisfying constraint 3)

13. unstack red_block_1 grey_block_1
Now holding red_block_1

14. putdown red_block_1
red_block_1 on the table, not holding anything

15. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_2
Now holding grey_block_1

16. putdown grey_block_1
grey_block_1 on the table, not holding anything

17. unstack red_block_2 blue_block_1
Now holding red_block_2

18. putdown red_block_2
red_block_2 on the table, not holding anything

19. unstack blue_block_1 brown_block_1
Now holding blue_block_1

20. putdown blue_block_1
blue_block_1 on the table, not holding anything

21. pickup brown_block_1
Now holding brown_block_1
(This achieves the goal)

OK, actually this plan is even longer than before. Let me try a completely different approach:

1. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1
Now holding brown_block_3, brown_block_1 is clear

2. putdown brown_block_3
brown_block_3 on the table, not holding anything

3. unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1
Now holding brown_block_2, blue_block_1 is clear

4. putdown brown_block_2
brown_block_2 on the table, not holding anything

5. unstack blue_block_1 grey_block_1
Now holding blue_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear
(This satisfies constraint 2)

6. putdown blue_block_1
blue_block_1 on the table, not holding anything

7. pickup red_block_1
Now holding red_block_1
(This satisfies constraint 4)

8. stack red_block_1 brown_block_1
red_block_1 on brown_block_1, not holding anything

9. pickup red_block_2
Now holding red_block_2
(At this point, both red_block_1 and red_block_2 are not on the table, satisfying constraint 3)

10. putdown red_block_2
red_block_2 on the table, not holding anything

11. unstack red_block_1 brown_block_1
Now holding red_block_1

12. putdown red_block_1
red_block_1 on the table, not holding anything

13. pickup brown_block_1
Now holding brown_block_1
(This achieves the goal)

This is better. Let me try one more optimization:

1. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1
Now holding brown_block_3, brown_block_1 is clear

2. putdown brown_block_3
brown_block_3 on the table, not holding anything

3. unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1
Now holding brown_block_2, blue_block_1 is clear

4. putdown brown_block_2
brown_block_2 on the table, not holding anything

5. unstack blue_block_1 grey_block_1
Now holding blue_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear
(This satisfies constraint 2)

6. putdown blue_block_1
blue_block_1 on the table, not holding anything

7. pickup red_block_2
Now holding red_block_2

8. stack red_block_2 brown_block_1
red_block_2 on brown_block_1, not holding anything
(This also satisfies constraint 2)

9. pickup red_block_1
Now holding red_block_1
(This satisfies constraint 4)

10. stack red_block_1 red_block_2
red_block_1 on red_block_2, not holding anything
(At this point, both red_block_1 and red_block_2 are not on the table, satisfying constraint 3)

11. unstack red_block_1 red_block_2
Now holding red_block_1

12. putdown red_block_1
red_block_1 on the table, not holding anything

13. unstack red_block_2 brown_block_1
Now holding red_block_2

14. putdown red_block_2
red_block_2 on the table, not holding anything

15. pickup brown_block_1
Now holding brown_block_1
(This achieves the goal)

OK, let me try one final optimization, trying to be as minimal as possible:

1. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1
Now holding brown_block_3, brown_block_1 is clear

2. putdown brown_block_3
brown_block_3 on the table, not holding anything

3. unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1
Now holding brown_block_2, blue_block_1 is clear

4. putdown brown_block_2
brown_block_2 on the table, not holding anything

5. unstack blue_block_1 grey_block_1
Now holding blue_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear
(This satisfies constraint 2)

6. putdown blue_block_1
blue_block_1 on the table, not holding anything

7. pickup red_block_1
Now holding red_block_1
(This satisfies constraint 4)

8. stack red_block_1 brown_block_1
red_block_1 on brown_block_1, not holding anything

9. pickup red_block_2
Now holding red_block_2
(At this point, both red_block_1 and red_block_2 are not on the table, satisfying constraint 3)

10. putdown red_block_2
red_block_2 on the table, not holding anything

11. unstack red_block_1 brown_block_1
Now holding red_block_1

12. putdown red_block_1
red_block_1 on the table, not holding anything

13. pickup brown_block_1
Now holding brown_block_1
(This achieves the goal)

Ok, so this plan has 13 steps. Let me check one more time if I can find a more efficient plan that still satisfies all constraints:

Constraint 1: grey_block_1 must not be on top of brown_block_3
- This is satisfied in the initial state

Constraint 2: If grey_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_3, then either red_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1 or grey_block_1 is clear.
- We need to make either red_block_2 on top of brown_block_1 or grey_block_1 clear at some point

Constraint 3: At some point, both red_block_1 and red_block_2 are not on the table.
- We need both red blocks off the table at the same time

Constraint 4: At some point, red_block_1 is not on the table.
- We need red_block_1 off the table at some point

Final goal: holding brown_block_1

Let me try to find the most direct path:

1. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1
Now holding brown_block_3, brown_block_1 is clear

2. stack brown_block_3 grey_block_1
brown_block_3 on grey_block_1, not holding anything

I realize this won't work well either because we need grey_block_1 to be clear to satisfy constraint 2, but we just placed brown_block_3 on it.

Let me try again:

1. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1
Now holding brown_block_3, brown_block_1 is clear

2. putdown brown_block_3
brown_block_3 on the table, not holding anything

3. pickup red_block_2
Now holding red_block_2

4. stack red_block_2 brown_block_1
red_block_2 on brown_block_1, not holding anything
(This satisfies constraint 2)

5. unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1
Now holding brown_block_2, blue_block_1 is clear

6. putdown brown_block_2
brown_block_2 on the table, not holding anything

7. unstack blue_block_1 grey_block_1
Now holding blue_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear
(This also satisfies constraint 2)

8. putdown blue_block_1
blue_block_1 on the table, not holding anything

9. pickup red_block_1
Now holding red_block_1
(This satisfies constraint 4)

10. stack red_block_1 red_block_2
red_block_1 on red_block_2, not holding anything
(At this point, both red_block_1 and red_block_2 are not on the table, satisfying constraint 3)

11. unstack red_block_1 red_block_2
Now holding red_block_1

12. putdown red_block_1
red_block_1 on the table, not holding anything

13. unstack red_block_2 brown_block_1
Now holding red_block_2

14. putdown red_block_2
red_block_2 on the table, not holding anything

15. pickup brown_block_1
Now holding brown_block_1
(This achieves the goal)

This plan has 15 steps, which is longer than my previous attempt. Let's go with the 13-step plan:

1. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1

Actually, I just realized that in the Blocksworld domain, we need to pick up a block before stacking it on another block. So after step 9 (holding red_block_2), we can't directly pick up red_block_1 (step 11); we need to put down red_block_2 first. Let me check carefully:

1. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1
Now holding brown_block_3, brown_block_1 is clear

2. putdown brown_block_3
brown_block_3 on the table, not holding anything

3. unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1
Now holding brown_block_2, blue_block_1 is clear

4. putdown brown_block_2
brown_block_2 on the table, not holding anything

5. unstack blue_block_1 grey_block_1
Now holding blue_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear
(This satisfies constraint 2)

6. putdown blue_block_1
blue_block_1 on the table, not holding anything

7. pickup red_block_1
Now holding red_block_1
(This satisfies constraint 4)

8. stack red_block_1 brown_block_1
red_block_1 on brown_block_1, not holding anything

9. pickup red_block_2
Now holding red_block_2
(At this point, both red_block_1 and red_block_2 are not on the table, satisfying constraint 3)

10. putdown red_block_2
red_block_2 on the table, not holding anything

11. unstack red_block_1 brown_block_1
Now holding red_block_1

12. putdown red_block_1
red_block_1 on the table, not holding anything

13. pickup brown_block_1
Now holding brown_block_1
(This achieves the goal)

Yes, this plan is correct and satisfies all the constraints.

Let me double-check the explanation of each step:

1. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1
   - This removes brown_block_3 from brown_block_1
   - We are now holding brown_block_3
   - brown_block_1 is now clear

2. putdown brown_block_3
   - We place brown_block_3 on the table
   - We are no longer holding anything

3. unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1
   - This removes brown_block_2 from blue_block_1
   - We are now holding brown_block_2
   - blue_block_1 is now clear

4. putdown brown_block_2
   - We place brown_block_2 on the table
   - We are no longer holding anything

5. unstack blue_block_1 grey_block_1
   - This removes blue_block_1 from grey_block_1
   - We are now holding blue_block_1
   - grey_block_1 is now clear
   - This satisfies constraint 2: grey_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_3 (true from the beginning) and grey_block_1 is clear

6. putdown blue_block_1
   - We place blue_block_1 on the table
   - We are no longer holding anything

7. pickup red_block_1
   - We pick up red_block_1 from the table
   - We are now holding red_block_1
   - This satisfies constraint 4: red_block_1 is not on the table

8. stack red_block_1 brown_block_1
   - We place red_block_1 on top of brown_block_1
   - We are no longer holding anything
   - brown_block_1 is no longer clear

9. pickup red_block_2
   - We pick up red_block_2 from the table
   - We are now holding red_block_2
   - At this point, red_block_1 is on brown_block_1 and red_block_2 is in our hand, so neither red block is on the table
   - This satisfies constraint 3: both red_block_1 and red_block_2 are not on the table

10. putdown red_block_2
    - We place red_block_2 on the table
    - We are no longer holding anything

11. unstack red_block_1 brown_block_1
    - This removes red_block_1 from brown_block_1
    - We are now holding red_block_1
    - brown_block_1 is now clear

12. putdown red_block_1
    - We place red_block_1 on the table
    - We are no longer holding anything

13. pickup brown_block_1
    - We pick up brown_block_1 from the table
    - We are now holding brown_block_1
    - This achieves the goal: holding brown_block_1

All constraints are satisfied and the goal is achieved.

So our final plan is:
1. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_3
3. unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1
4. putdown brown_block_2
5. unstack blue_block_1 grey_block_1
6. putdown blue_block_1
7. pickup red_block_1
8. stack red_block_1 brown_block_1
9. pickup red_block_2
10. putdown red_block_2
11. unstack red_block_1 brown_block_1
12. putdown red_block_1
13. pickup brown_block_1
