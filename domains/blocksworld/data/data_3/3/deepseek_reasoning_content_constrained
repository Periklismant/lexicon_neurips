Okay, let's try to figure out this planning problem. So, the initial state has several blocks arranged in specific ways. The goal is to have the robotic arm holding brown_block_1. There are also some constraints that the plan must satisfy. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the initial state:

- brown_block_1 is on the table, and brown_block_3 is on top of it. Since brown_block_3 is clear, that means there's nothing on top of it. So to pick up brown_block_1, which is under brown_block_3, I need to first remove brown_block_3. But brown_block_3 is clear, so I can unstack it from brown_block_1. Wait, no, the unstack action requires that the block being unstacked (b1) is on top of another block (b2), and that b1 is clear, and the arm is empty. So since brown_block_3 is on brown_block_1 and is clear, I can unstack brown_block_3 from brown_block_1. Then put it down somewhere else. That would make brown_block_1 clear, allowing me to pick it up. But the goal is to be holding brown_block_1, so after unstacking brown_block_3 and putting it down, I can then pickup brown_block_1. But let's check the constraints.

The constraints are:

1. At some state, grey_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_3. Initially, grey_block_1 is on red_block_1, so it's not on brown_block_3. Wait, but maybe after some actions, grey_block_1 could end up there? Wait, in the initial state, grey_block_1 is on red_block_1, and blue_block_1 is on grey_block_1, then brown_block_2 is on blue_block_1. So grey_block_1 is under blue_block_1. So initially, grey_block_1 is not on brown_block_3, so that constraint is already satisfied in the initial state. Hmm, but maybe the plan must include a state where that is true. Wait, the first constraint says that "grey_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_3" must hold in at least one state. Since in the initial state, that's already true (grey is on red, brown_3 is on brown_1), does the initial state count? The problem says "the original state of the world" and the constraints are about the plan's states. So the plan's sequence must have at least one state (including the initial?) where that holds. But the initial state is part of the states. So maybe that constraint is already satisfied by the initial state. But perhaps the problem requires that during the plan's execution, the constraint is met. Wait, the user says "the following expression must hold in at least one state", which includes the initial state. So if the initial state already meets that, then that constraint is already satisfied. But maybe during the plan, the grey_block_1 is moved on top of brown_block_3, then later moved off again, but that's not necessary. Wait, the initial state has grey_block_1 on red_block_1, not on brown_block_3. So the initial state satisfies the first constraint. So maybe that's okay. But the second constraint says that if in some state s, grey_block_1 is not on brown_block_3, then in s or some state after s, either red_block_2 is on brown_block_1 or grey_block_1 is clear. Since the initial state meets the first part (grey not on brown_3), then the second part must hold in the initial state or after. In the initial state, red_block_2 is on the table and clear, so grey_block_1 is under blue_block_1, so grey is not clear. So in the initial state, the second part (red_block_2 on brown_block_1 or grey clear) is not true. Therefore, the plan must ensure that after the initial state (since the initial state is s), in some future state, either red_block_2 is on brown_block_1 or grey_block_1 is clear. So during the plan, we need to make sure that either red_block_2 is stacked on brown_block_1, or that grey_block_1 is clear (i.e., nothing on top of it). But in the initial state, grey_block_1 has blue_block_1 on top. So to make grey_block_1 clear, we need to remove blue_block_1 from it. But blue_block_1 has brown_block_2 on top. So that's a tower: red_block_1, grey_block_1, blue_block_1, brown_block_2. So to unstack brown_block_2 from blue_block_1, then unstack blue_block_1 from grey_block_1. That would make grey_block_1 clear. Alternatively, stack red_block_2 on brown_block_1. So maybe during the plan, after picking up brown_block_1, we can stack red_block_2 on it. But the goal is just to hold brown_block_1, so perhaps after achieving the goal, we might have to do something else to satisfy the constraints.

But let's first focus on the main goal: holding brown_block_1. To do that, we need to unstack brown_block_3 from brown_block_1, then pickup brown_block_1. So initial steps:

1. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1
   - Preconditions: brown_block_3 is on brown_block_1, clear, and arm is empty. Yes.
   - After unstacking, arm holds brown_block_3, and brown_block_1 is clear.
2. putdown brown_block_3
   - Now, brown_block_3 is on table, arm is empty.
3. pickup brown_block_1
   - Preconditions: clear, on table, arm empty. Yes.

This would give the goal. The plan would be three actions. But we have to check the constraints.

Now, check constraints:

Constraint 1: "grey_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_3" must hold in at least one state. In the initial state, this is true. So this is satisfied.

Constraint 2: If in any state s, "grey_block_1 not on brown_block_3" holds, then in s or later, either red_block_2 is on brown_block_1 or grey_block_1 is clear. In the initial state s, since "grey not on brown_3" holds, then we need to ensure that in s or later, either red_block_2 on brown_block_1 or grey is clear. In the initial state, grey is not clear (has blue_block_1 on top). So in the initial state, the condition is not met. Therefore, the plan must ensure that after the initial state (since s is the initial state here), there's a state where either red_block_2 is on brown_block_1 or grey_block_1 is clear.

But in the current plan steps (unstack, putdown, pickup), after step 3, the arm is holding brown_block_1. The state after step 3 would have:

- brown_block_3 on table (from step 2)
- brown_block_1 is being held (from step 3)
- The tower red_block_1, grey_block_1, blue_block_1, brown_block_2 remains as in initial state, except that brown_block_3 is moved.

In this case, grey_block_1 still has blue_block_1 on top, so not clear. Red_block_2 is on the table. So after step 3, the condition (red_block_2 on brown_block_1 or grey clear) is not met. So the plan would violate the second constraint. Therefore, we need to modify the plan to ensure that after the initial state, either red_block_2 is placed on brown_block_1 or grey_block_1 becomes clear.

So how to achieve this. Let's see. Let's think about the steps needed. To make grey_block_1 clear, we need to unstack blue_block_1 from it. But blue_block_1 has brown_block_2 on top. So first, we need to unstack brown_block_2 from blue_block_1, then unstack blue_block_1 from grey_block_1. Then, grey_block_1 becomes clear. But this would take extra steps. Alternatively, stack red_block_2 on brown_block_1, which would require moving red_block_2. But red_block_2 is initially on table and clear. So we can pick it up and stack it on brown_block_1 after brown_block_1 is clear. But in the current plan, after unstacking brown_block_3, brown_block_1 is clear. So maybe after step 1 (unstack brown_block_3), we can do something else before putting it down. Wait, after unstacking brown_block_3, the arm is holding it. Then, if we stack it somewhere else, like on red_block_2. But maybe that's not necessary. Alternatively, after putting brown_block_3 down (step 2), then we can pick up red_block_2 and stack it on brown_block_1. Let's see:

So modify the plan:

1. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_3
3. pickup red_block_2
4. stack red_block_2 brown_block_1
5. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1 (Wait, after step 4, brown_block_1 has red_block_2 on top. So to pickup brown_block_1, we need to first unstack red_block_2 from it. But the goal is to hold brown_block_1. So this approach may complicate things. Let me think.

Alternatively, after step 2 (brown_block_3 is on table), we can pick up red_block_2 (since it's on table and clear), stack it on brown_block_1 (which is clear after step 1). Then proceed. So:

1. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1
2. stack red_block_2 brown_block_1
   - Wait, after step 1, the arm is holding brown_block_3. To stack red_block_2 on brown_block_1, we need to put down brown_block_3 first. So maybe:

Revised steps:

1. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_3 (now brown_block_1 is clear, arm empty)
3. pickup red_block_2 (arm holds red_block_2)
4. stack red_block_2 brown_block_1 (now red_block_2 is on brown_block_1, which makes brown_block_1 not clear)
But then, how to pick up brown_block_1? Because to pick it up, it needs to be clear and on the table. But after stacking red_block_2 on it, brown_block_1 is under red_block_2, and not on the table. So that's a problem. So stacking red_block_2 on brown_block_1 would make it impossible to pick up brown_block_1. Therefore, this approach is not feasible.

Alternative idea: instead of stacking red_block_2 on brown_block_1, perhaps make grey_block_1 clear. Let's try that. To do that, we need to remove blue_block_1 from grey_block_1. But blue_block_1 has brown_block_2 on top. So:

First, unstack brown_block_2 from blue_block_1:

1. unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1
   - Preconditions: brown_block_2 is on blue_block_1, clear, arm empty. Yes.
   - After unstacking, arm holds brown_block_2.
2. putdown brown_block_2 (on table)
3. unstack blue_block_1 grey_block_1
   - Now, blue_block_1 is on grey_block_1, clear (since brown_block_2 was removed). Wait, no. After step 1, blue_block_1 is clear because brown_block_2 was on it and is now removed. So step 3: unstack blue_block_1 from grey_block_1. Preconditions: blue_block_1 is on grey_block_1, clear, arm empty. After step 2, arm is empty. So yes. So unstacking blue_block_1 from grey_block_1. Then put it down.

But this is getting complicated. Let's see. If I do this, then grey_block_1 becomes clear. Which would satisfy the second constraint. Because in the initial state, the condition "grey not on brown_3" holds, and then later, after some steps, grey_block_1 becomes clear.

But this is adding a lot of steps. However, the constraints must be satisfied. Let's see.

If the original plan (unstack brown_block_3, putdown, pickup brown_block_1) would not satisfy constraint 2, because after the initial state, there's no state where either red_block_2 is on brown_block_1 or grey_block_1 is clear. Because in the plan's final state, brown_block_1 is being held, so it's not on the table. Wait, no: after step 3 (pickup brown_block_1), the arm is holding it. So brown_block_1 is no longer on the table. So brown_block_1 is in the air. Then, the state after step 3 is:

- Arm holds brown_block_1
- brown_block_3 is on table
- The other blocks: red_block_1, grey_block_1, blue_block_1, brown_block_2 are still in their initial positions (since we didn't touch them). So grey_block_1 still has blue_block_1 on top, so not clear. Red_block_2 is on table. So the condition (red_block_2 on brown_block_1 or grey clear) is not met. Therefore, the plan would violate the second constraint. So we need to find a way to meet that.

So perhaps after moving brown_block_3, we need to do something else. Let's think: in the plan, after putting down brown_block_3, before picking up brown_block_1, we can stack red_block_2 on brown_block_1, but that would make brown_block_1 have a block on top, which makes it not possible to pick up. Alternatively, make grey_block_1 clear. To do that, as mentioned earlier, we need to remove blue_block_1 from it. Let's see:

Alternative plan steps:

1. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1 → arm holds brown_block_3
2. putdown brown_block_3 → arm empty, brown_block_3 on table
3. unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1 → arm holds brown_block_2 (since blue_block_1 is under brown_block_2)
4. putdown brown_block_2 → arm empty
5. unstack blue_block_1 grey_block_1 → arm holds blue_block_1
6. putdown blue_block_1 → arm empty
   Now, grey_block_1 is clear.
7. pickup brown_block_1 → arm holds brown_block_1

This plan has seven actions, and in step 6, grey_block_1 becomes clear. So in state after step 6, the condition (grey clear) holds, satisfying the second constraint. Also, in the initial state, the first constraint (grey not on brown_3) holds. So constraint 2 is satisfied because after the initial state, eventually grey_block_1 becomes clear.

But this seems like a longer plan. However, the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). So maybe there's a shorter way. Let's see.

Wait, but the constraints also require:

Constraint 3: At some state, both red_block_1 and red_block_2 are not on the table. So both must be on top of other blocks. And constraint 4: red_block_1 is not on the table in at least one state.

So in the initial state, red_block_1 is on the table. So the plan must have at least one state where red_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 4). But also, there's a state where both red_block_1 and red_block_2 are not on the table (constraint 3). So perhaps we need to stack red_block_1 and red_block_2 somewhere.

But how to achieve that while also getting to hold brown_block_1. This complicates things.

Let me summarize all constraints:

1. At least one state where grey_block_1 is not on brown_block_3. Already satisfied in initial.

2. Whenever in a state s where grey_block_1 is not on brown_block_3, then in s or a subsequent state, either red_block_2 is on brown_block_1 or grey_block_1 is clear.

   Since the initial state s0 has grey not on brown_3, then s0 must satisfy the implication. But in s0, neither red_block_2 is on brown_block_1 (red_block_2 is on table) nor is grey_block_1 clear (since it has blue_block_1 on top). So the implication is not satisfied. Therefore, the plan must ensure that after s0, in some subsequent state, either red_block_2 is on brown_block_1 or grey_block_1 is clear.

3. At least one state where red_block_1 and red_block_2 are both not on the table.

4. At least one state where red_block_1 is not on the table.

So constraints 3 and 4 require that red_block_1 is moved off the table at least once, and red_block_2 is also moved off the table at least once, in some states. So in the plan, we need to have actions that move both red blocks off the table.

But the goal is to hold brown_block_1. So the plan must include actions to move those red blocks, even though they are not directly related to the goal. This complicates the plan.

So now, the problem is more complex. Let's try to integrate these constraints into the plan.

First, to satisfy constraint 3 and 4, we need to stack red_block_1 and red_block_2 somewhere. But where? Let's see.

Possible approach:

- Unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1 (since grey is on red_block_1) to free red_block_1.

Wait, initially, grey_block_1 is on red_block_1, and blue_block_1 is on grey, brown_block_2 on blue. So to get red_block_1 off the table, we need to move grey_block_1. But grey_block_1 has a tower on top. So to unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1, we need to first remove the blocks above it.

So steps to move red_block_1 off the table:

1. unstack brown_block_2 from blue_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_2
3. unstack blue_block_1 from grey_block_1
4. putdown blue_block_1
5. unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1
6. stack grey_block_1 somewhere (maybe on brown_block_3, but that would affect constraint 1. Wait, but constraint 1 requires that grey is not on brown_block_3 in at least one state. Since initial state already satisfies that, moving grey onto brown_block_3 would not violate it, as long as in some state (maybe later) it's not. But if we never put grey on brown_block_3, then constraint 1 is still satisfied by the initial state. So perhaps it's okay to stack grey_block_1 somewhere else, like on red_block_2. Then red_block_1 would be clear. Then we can stack red_block_1 on another block.

But this is getting very involved. Let's think of a plan that achieves the goal and meets all constraints.

Alternative plan:

To satisfy constraint 3 (both red blocks not on table) and constraint 4 (red_block_1 not on table), we need to stack red_block_1 and red_block_2. Let's say we stack red_block_2 on brown_block_1 (after clearing it) and stack red_block_1 somewhere else. But how?

But the main goal is to hold brown_block_1. Let's think of steps that achieve the goal while also moving the red blocks.

Here's an idea:

- First, unstack the tower on red_block_1 to free grey_block_1 and move it, allowing red_block_1 to be moved.

But this would require several steps. Let's outline:

1. unstack brown_block_2 from blue_block_1 → arm holds brown_block_2
2. putdown brown_block_2
3. unstack blue_block_1 from grey_block_1 → arm holds blue_block_1
4. putdown blue_block_1
5. unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1 → arm holds grey_block_1
6. stack grey_block_1 on brown_block_3 → now grey is on brown_block_3. But this would make grey_block_1 on brown_block_3, which affects constraint 1. But constraint 1 requires that in at least one state, grey is not on brown_block_3. However, the initial state already satisfies this. So even if later steps stack grey on brown_block_3, as long as there's at least one state (like the initial) where it's not, it's okay. But then, in the state after step 6, grey is on brown_block_3. Then, the first constraint is satisfied (because in the initial state, it's not), but the second constraint would require that in any state where grey is not on brown_block_3, the condition holds. For example, after step 6, if we unstack grey_block_1 from brown_block_3, then in that state, the condition would need to hold. Hmm, this could complicate things.

Alternatively, stack grey_block_1 somewhere else. Let's say stack it on red_block_2:

6. stack grey_block_1 red_block_2 → red_block_2 now has grey on top, so red_block_2 is not on the table anymore. This helps with constraint 3.

Then, red_block_1 is clear. So we can pick it up and stack it somewhere else.

7. pickup red_block_1 → arm holds red_block_1
8. stack red_block_1 on some block, like blue_block_1 → now red_block_1 is not on the table.

This would satisfy constraint 3 (both red blocks not on table) and constraint 4.

But how does this integrate with the main goal of holding brown_block_1? Let's see.

After step 8, we have to then unstack brown_block_3 from brown_block_1 to pick up brown_block_1. Wait, but in step 6, we stacked grey_block_1 on red_block_2. So grey_block_1 is now on red_block_2. Then, perhaps after that, we can proceed to handle brown_block_3 and brown_block_1.

But this is a very long plan. Let's count steps so far:

1. unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_2
3. unstack blue_block_1 grey_block_1
4. putdown blue_block_1
5. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1
6. stack grey_block_1 red_block_2
7. pickup red_block_1
8. stack red_block_1 blue_block_1
9. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1
10. putdown brown_block_3
11. pickup brown_block_1

That's 11 steps. But the optimal plan should be as short as possible. Is there a way to combine these actions to satisfy all constraints with fewer steps?

Alternatively, maybe we can stack red_block_2 on brown_block_1 after clearing it, which would satisfy constraint 2 (since red_block_2 is on brown_block_1) and also help with constraint 3 (red_block_2 not on table). Then, stack red_block_1 somewhere else.

But let's see.

Let's try another approach:

- First, unstack brown_block_3 from brown_block_1 to clear it, then stack red_block_2 on brown_block_1. Then, unstack red_block_2 later to pick up brown_block_1. But stacking red_block_2 on brown_block_1 would make brown_block_1 have a block on top, preventing pickup. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, after stacking red_block_2 on brown_block_1, then brown_block_1 is under red_block_2, so to pick it up, we need to first unstack red_block_2, but that would require additional steps.

Alternatively, after stacking red_block_2 on brown_block_1, we can then unstack it again. But this adds steps.

Let me think of a plan that satisfies all constraints with minimal steps.

Possible steps:

1. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1 → arm holds brown_block_3
2. stack brown_block_3 red_block_2 → brown_block_3 is now on red_block_2, which is on the table. Now, red_block_2 is not clear (has brown_block_3 on top). But this action requires that the arm is holding brown_block_3 and red_block_2 is clear. Initially, red_block_2 is clear. So step 2 is possible. After stacking, red_block_2 is not on the table (no, wait, stacking puts brown_block_3 on red_block_2. red_block_2 is still on the table. So red_block_2 remains on the table, but now has brown_block_3 on top. So red_block_2 is no longer clear. So red_block_2 is still on the table. So constraint 3 (both red blocks not on table) is not met. So this doesn't help.

Alternative idea: stack red_block_2 on another block. For example, after unstacking brown_block_3, stack it on red_block_1. But that would require moving red_block_1's tower.

Alternatively, use red_block_2 to stack on another block.

Let me think differently. Let's consider that the constraints require:

- At least one state where red_block_1 is not on the table.

- At least one state where both red_block_1 and red_block_2 are not on the table.

So to achieve this, we need to move both red blocks off the table at some point.

But the main goal is to hold brown_block_1.

So perhaps we can structure the plan as follows:

- Unstack brown_block_3 from brown_block_1, put it down.

- Then, unstack the tower on red_block_1 to free red_block_1, move it somewhere, and move red_block_2 somewhere else.

But this would take many steps. However, maybe there's a way to combine these actions.

Alternatively, after unstacking brown_block_3, use it to stack on red_block_1's tower. But this might not help.

Another approach: Since constraint 3 requires both red blocks to be off the table at least once, perhaps we can stack red_block_1 on red_block_2, or vice versa. Let's try:

To stack red_block_1 on red_block_2:

- First, unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1. But grey_block_1 has blue_block_1 and brown_block_2 on top. So need to unstack those first.

Steps:

1. unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1 → hold brown_block_2
2. putdown brown_block_2
3. unstack blue_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold blue_block_1
4. putdown blue_block_1
5. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1 → hold grey_block_1
6. stack grey_block_1 red_block_2 → red_block_2 now has grey_block_1 on top. So red_block_2 is not on the table anymore (no, stacking on red_block_2 which is on the table. So red_block_2 remains on the table, but has grey_block_1 on top. So red_block_2 is still on the table. So this doesn't help with constraint 3.

Hmm. To get red_block_2 off the table, we need to stack it on another block. For example:

6. stack grey_block_1 red_block_1 → grey_block_1 is on red_block_1, which is still on the table. So red_block_1 remains on the table. Not helpful.

Alternatively, after step 5 (holding grey_block_1), stack it on brown_block_3. Then, red_block_1 is clear. Pick up red_block_1 and stack it somewhere else.

7. stack grey_block_1 brown_block_3 → now grey_block_1 is on brown_block_3. Then, red_block_1 is clear.

8. pickup red_block_1 → arm holds red_block_1.

9. stack red_block_1 blue_block_1 → now red_block_1 is on blue_block_1, which is on the table. So red_block_1 is off the table. This satisfies constraint 4.

Then, for red_block_2, we need to also move it off the table. For example:

10. pickup red_block_2 → arm holds red_block_2.

11. stack red_block_2 brown_block_1 → but brown_block_1 is on the table and clear (since we unstuck brown_block_3 earlier). So this stacks red_block_2 on brown_block_1. Now, red_block_2 is off the table. So now, both red blocks are not on the table in this state. Satisfies constraint 3.

Then, to pick up brown_block_1, we need to unstack red_block_2 from it.

12. unstack red_block_2 brown_block_1 → arm holds red_block_2.

13. putdown red_block_2 → now brown_block_1 is clear again.

14. pickup brown_block_1 → goal achieved.

But this is a very long plan. Moreover, we have to check if all constraints are met.

Constraint 1: grey_block_1 is not on brown_block_3 in at least one state. In the initial state, this is true. So satisfied.

Constraint 2: In any state where grey_block_1 is not on brown_block_3, then either red_block_2 is on brown_block_1 or grey_block_1 is clear. For example, after step 7, grey_block_1 is on brown_block_3, so the condition is not triggered. But in other states, like step 5, grey_block_1 is not on brown_block_3 (it's being held), then the condition requires that either red_block_2 is on brown_block_1 or grey_block_1 is clear. In step 5, grey is held, so in that state, grey_block_1 is not on brown_block_3 (it's in the air), so we need to check the condition. But in step 5, after unstacking grey_block_1, the arm is holding it, so grey_block_1 is not on brown_block_3. Then, in that state or later, either red_block_2 is on brown_block_1 or grey_block_1 is clear. After step 5, grey_block_1 is held, so grey is clear? No, when you stack a block on another, the lower block becomes not clear. If grey_block_1 is being held, then the block it was on (red_block_1) becomes clear. Wait, after unstacking grey_block_1 from red_block_1, red_block_1 is clear. So in step 5, after unstacking grey_block_1, red_block_1 is clear. But grey_block_1 is held, so grey_block_1's clear status is not applicable (it's in the air). So in the state after step 5, the grey_block_1 is not on brown_block_3 (it's being held), and the condition requires that either red_block_2 is on brown_block_1 or grey_block_1 is clear. But grey_block_1 is being held, so it's not clear (clear means no blocks on top; when held, it's not on any block, but it's also not on the table). So the clear status refers to blocks on the table. So in this state, grey_block_1 is not clear (since it's in the arm). So the condition is not met. Therefore, this plan might violate constraint 2.

This is getting extremely complicated. I think I need to find a balance between meeting the constraints and achieving the goal efficiently.

Alternative plan focusing on the constraints:

1. Unstack brown_block_3 from brown_block_1 → arm holds brown_block_3.
   - Now, brown_block_1 is clear.
2. Stack brown_block_3 on red_block_2 → red_block_2 is now under brown_block_3. So red_block_2 is still on the table, but not clear. But this action requires that red_block_2 is clear before stacking. So this is not possible. Because after step 1, red_block_2 is clear (initial state). So step 2 is possible.

After step 2, red_block_2 has brown_block_3 on top, so red_block_2 is on the table but not clear. This doesn't help with constraint 3, as red_block_2 is still on the table.

But to get red_block_2 off the table, we need to stack it on another block. So perhaps stack it on brown_block_1 after clearing it.

But after step 1, brown_block_1 is clear. So:

3. pickup red_block_2 → requires that red_block_2 is clear. After step 2, red_block_2 has brown_block_3 on top. So can't pick it up. Therefore, this approach won't work.

Alternative plan:

1. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1 → hold brown_block_3
2. putdown brown_block_3 → now brown_block_3 is on table
3. pickup red_block_2 → arm holds red_block_2
4. stack red_block_2 brown_block_1 → now red_block_2 is on brown_block_1, which is on the table. So red_block_2 is not on the table anymore (since it's stacked on brown_block_1, which is on the table? Wait, no. If brown_block_1 is on the table and red_block_2 is stacked on it, then red_block_2 is still considered to be on the table? No. Blocks are on the table if they are directly placed on it. If a block is on another block that's on the table, it's not on the table. So red_block_2 is now on brown_block_1, which is on the table. So red_block_2 is not on the table anymore. This satisfies constraint 3 for red_block_2. Now, we need to also move red_block_1 off the table.

But how? red_block_1 has grey_block_1, blue_block_1, brown_block_2 on top. So to move red_block_1, we need to unstack all those blocks.

But perhaps after step 4, we can unstack brown_block_3 from the table and do something else. This is getting too time-consuming.

Alternatively, after step 4, we can pick up red_block_1's tower. Let's see:

5. unstack brown_block_2 from blue_block_1 → requires that brown_block_2 is clear. Initially, brown_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1 and clear. So yes.

6. putdown brown_block_2 → now blue_block_1 is clear.
7. unstack blue_block_1 from grey_block_1 → arm holds blue_block_1
8. putdown blue_block_1 → grey_block_1 is clear
9. unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1 → arm holds grey_block_1
10. stack grey_block_1 on red_block_2 → red_block_2 is on brown_block_1, so grey_block_1 is now on red_block_2. This moves red_block_1 off the table? No, red_block_1 is still on the table. Wait, after step 9, red_block_1 is clear. So we can pick up red_block_1.

11. pickup red_block_1 → arm holds red_block_1
12. stack red_block_1 on some block, like blue_block_1 → now red_block_1 is not on the table.

Now, both red blocks are not on the table (red_block_2 is on brown_block_1, red_block_1 is on blue_block_1). This satisfies constraints 3 and 4.

Then, to pick up brown_block_1, we need to unstack red_block_2 from it:

13. unstack red_block_2 brown_block_1 → arm holds red_block_2
14. putdown red_block_2 → brown_block_1 is clear
15. pickup brown_block_1 → goal achieved.

This plan has 15 steps. But it's very long. However, given the constraints, it's necessary to perform these steps.

But perhaps there's a shorter way. Let's see.

Wait, after step 4 (stack red_block_2 on brown_block_1), we have red_block_2 not on the table. Then, for red_block_1, we need to move it off the table. To do that, we can unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1. But grey_block_1 is under blue_block_1 and brown_block_2. So steps 5-10 are needed. But perhaps there's a way to move red_block_1 with fewer steps.

Alternatively, after step 4 (stack red_block_2 on brown_block_1), we can proceed to unstack the tower on red_block_1:

5. unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1 → hold brown_block_2
6. putdown brown_block_2
7. unstack blue_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold blue_block_1
8. stack blue_block_1 red_block_2 → now blue_block_1 is on red_block_2 (which is on brown_block_1)
9. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1 → hold grey_block_1
10. stack grey_block_1 blue_block_1 → now grey_block_1 is on blue_block_1
11. pickup red_block_1 → arm holds red_block_1
12. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1 → now red_block_1 is on grey_block_1, which is on blue_block_1, etc. So red_block_1 is off the table.

This way, steps 5-12. Then, proceed to pickup brown_block_1:

13. unstack red_block_2 brown_block_1 → hold red_block_2
14. putdown red_block_2
15. pickup brown_block_1 → goal.

This is still 15 steps. Not sure if this is shorter.

At this point, I think it's necessary to accept that the constraints require a longer plan. However, the problem states to provide an optimal plan, which is as short as possible. So there must be a smarter way to satisfy all constraints with fewer steps.

Let me try a different approach.

The main goal is to hold brown_block_1. To do that, we need to unstack brown_block_3 from it, then pickup brown_block_1.

But to satisfy the constraints, during the plan, after the initial state, we need to:

- Have at least one state where red_block_1 is not on the table.

- Have at least one state where both red_block_1 and red_block_2 are not on the table.

- Ensure that after the initial state, there's a state where either red_block_2 is on brown_block_1 or grey_block_1 is clear.

So, perhaps we can stack red_block_2 on brown_block_1 after unstacking brown_block_3, which would satisfy the condition for constraint 2 (red_block_2 on brown_block_1), and also help with constraint 3 (red_block_2 not on table). Then, stack red_block_1 on another block.

But how to stack red_block_1 somewhere else.

Here's a possible plan:

1. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1 → hold brown_block_3
2. putdown brown_block_3 → arm empty, brown_block_3 on table
3. pickup red_block_2 → arm holds red_block_2 (since it's clear in initial state)
4. stack red_block_2 brown_block_1 → now red_block_2 is on brown_block_1. This satisfies the condition for constraint 2 (red_block_2 on brown_block_1). Also, red_block_2 is not on the table anymore. So constraint 3 needs both red blocks not on table. So we need to move red_block_1 as well.

To move red_block_1:

5. unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1 → hold brown_block_2
6. putdown brown_block_2 → arm empty
7. unstack blue_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold blue_block_1
8. putdown blue_block_1 → arm empty
9. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1 → hold grey_block_1
10. stack grey_block_1 somewhere, like on brown_block_3 → now grey_block_1 is on brown_block_3. Then, red_block_1 is clear.
11. pickup red_block_1 → arm holds red_block_1
12. stack red_block_1 blue_block_1 → now red_block_1 is not on the table. Now, both red blocks are not on the table. Satisfies constraint 3.

Then, to get brown_block_1:

13. unstack red_block_2 brown_block_1 → hold red_block_2
14. putdown red_block_2 → arm empty
15. pickup brown_block_1 → goal achieved.

This plan has 15 steps. But perhaps there's a way to combine some actions.

Alternatively, after step 4 (stack red_block_2 on brown_block_1), can we unstack red_block_2 later to pickup brown_block_1? Yes. So steps:

1. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_3
3. pickup red_block_2
4. stack red_block_2 brown_block_1
5. unstack red_block_2 brown_block_1
6. putdown red_block_2
7. pickup brown_block_1 → goal achieved.

But this would only take 7 steps. However, we haven't addressed moving red_block_1 off the table for constraints 3 and 4.

So, this plan would fail to meet constraints 3 and 4. So, we need to include actions to move red_block_1.

Thus, the plan must include steps to move red_block_1 and red_block_2 off the table.

Alternative idea: Use the unstacking of the tower on red_block_1 to move grey_block_1 onto brown_block_3. This would make grey_block_1 not on brown_block_3 in the initial state (constraint 1) and then later on brown_block_3. But the constraint is satisfied as long as at least one state has it not on. But this complicates the other constraints.

Alternatively, during the process of unstacking the tower on red_block_1, we can put grey_block_1 on red_block_2. Let's try:

Steps:

1. unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1 → hold brown_block_2
2. putdown brown_block_2
3. unstack blue_block_1 grey_block_1 → hold blue_block_1
4. putdown blue_block_1
5. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1 → hold grey_block_1
6. stack grey_block_1 red_block_2 → now red_block_2 has grey_block_1 on top, so red_block_2 is on table but not clear. This doesn't take red_block_2 off the table. So this doesn't help with constraint 3.

But if we stack red_block_1 on top of another block:

7. pickup red_block_1 → arm holds red_block_1
8. stack red_block_1 blue_block_1 → now red_block_1 is not on the table. This satisfies constraint 4 and part of constraint 3.

Then, we need to move red_block_2 off the table. For that:

9. pickup red_block_2 → but red_block_2 has grey_block_1 on top. So cannot pick up. Therefore, we need to unstack grey_block_1 first.

9. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_2 → hold grey_block_1
10. putdown grey_block_1 → now red_block_2 is clear and on table.
11. pickup red_block_2 → arm holds red_block_2
12. stack red_block_2 some_block → say, blue_block_1. But blue_block_1 has red_block_1 on top. So need to stack on another block.

But this is getting too long.

At this point, I think it's necessary to accept that the optimal plan must be longer than the initial three steps due to the constraints. The constraints require moving both red blocks off the table and ensuring that after the initial state, grey_block_1 becomes clear or red_block_2 is on brown_block_1.

The minimal plan would likely involve:

- Unstacking brown_block_3 from brown_block_1.

- Stacking red_block_2 on brown_block_1 (satisfying constraint 2).

- Moving red_block_1 off the table (satisfying constraints 3 and 4).

- Then unstacking red_block_2 from brown_block_1 to pickup brown_block_1.

But each of these steps adds actions.

Let's outline this plan:

1. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1 → arm holds brown_block_3
2. putdown brown_block_3 → arm empty
3. pickup red_block_2 → arm holds red_block_2
4. stack red_block_2 brown_block_1 → red_block_2 on brown_block_1. Now, red_block_2 is not on table (satisfies part of constraint 3).

Now, to move red_block_1 off the table:

5. unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1 → arm holds brown_block_2
6. putdown brown_block_2
7. unstack blue_block_1 grey_block_1 → arm holds blue_block_1
8. putdown blue_block_1
9. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1 → arm holds grey_block_1
10. stack grey_block_1 brown_block_3 → grey_block_1 is now on brown_block_3. Now, red_block_1 is clear.
11. pickup red_block_1 → arm holds red_block_1
12. stack red_block_1 blue_block_1 → red_block_1 is not on table (satisfies constraints 3 and 4).

Now, both red blocks are off the table in step 12.

Finally, to pickup brown_block_1:

13. unstack red_block_2 brown_block_1 → arm holds red_block_2
14. putdown red_block_2 → arm empty
15. pickup brown_block_1 → goal.

This is 15 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, after step 4 (red_block_2 on brown_block_1), unstack it immediately:

5. unstack red_block_2 brown_block_1 → arm holds red_block_2
6. putdown red_block_2 → arm empty
7. pickup brown_block_1 → goal.

But this doesn't address moving red_block_1, so constraints 3 and 4 are not met.

Thus, the plan must include steps to move red_block_1.

Another idea: Use the brown_block_3 that was put down earlier to stack red_block_1 on it.

After step 2, brown_block_3 is on the table. Then:

3. unstack brown_block_2 blue_block_1 → arm holds brown_block_2
4. putdown brown_block_2
5. unstack blue_block_1 grey_block_1 → arm holds blue_block_1
6. putdown blue_block_1
7. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1 → arm holds grey_block_1
8. stack grey_block_1 brown_block_3 → grey is on brown_block_3.
9. pickup red_block_1 → arm holds red_block_1
10. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1 → red_block_1 is on grey_block_1, which is on brown_block_3. Now, red_block_1 is not on table (satisfies constraint 4).
11. pickup red_block_2 → arm holds red_block_2
12. stack red_block_2 red_block_1 → red_block_2 is on red_block_1. Now, both red blocks are not on table (satisfies constraint 3).

Then, proceed to unstack brown_block_3 from brown_block_1:

Wait, brown_block_1 is still under brown_block_3 (no, in step 1, brown_block_3 was unstuck and put down in step 2. So brown_block_1 is clear. Then, after step 12, we need to pick up brown_block_1.

13. unstack grey_block_1 brown_block_3 → but grey_block_1 is under red_block_1. So this is not possible.

This approach is not working.

Given the time I've spent, I think the optimal plan must involve the following steps:

1. Unstack brown_block_3 from brown_block_1.

2. Put it down.

3. Stack red_block_2 on brown_block_1 (satisfies constraint 2).

4. Unstack the tower on red_block_1 to move red_block_1 somewhere else (satisfies constraint 3 and 4).

5. Unstack red_block_2 to pick up brown_block_1.

But the exact steps are numerous. Given the time constraints, I'll try to formulate a plan that meets all the requirements, even if it's long.
