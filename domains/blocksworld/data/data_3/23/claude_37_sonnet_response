Let's break down the problem and understand the initial state, the goal, and the constraints.

**Initial State:**
- red_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- black_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- black_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- brown_block_1 is clear
- black_block_2 is clear
- green_block_1 is clear
- the robot is not holding any block

**Goal:**
- brown_block_1 is on the table

**Constraints:**
1. At some point, black_block_2 should not be clear (i.e., a block should be on top of it).
2. At some point, black_block_1 should not be on top of brown_block_1 (this is confusing because there's nothing saying black_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1 in the initial state).
3. If black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1 at some state s, then at that state or a later state, at least one of the following should be true:
   - red_block_1 is not on the table
   - brown_block_1 is not clear
4. At some point, the robot should be holding blue_block_1.

Now, given the initial state and the goal, let's come up with a plan.

The goal says we want brown_block_1 to be on the table. Currently, brown_block_1 is on top of red_block_1. So, we need to unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1 and put it on the table.

Let's do this step by step while ensuring we satisfy all the constraints:

1. Unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1 (making the robot hold brown_block_1).
2. Put down brown_block_1 on the table (achieving the goal).

However, this simple plan doesn't satisfy the constraints:
- We never made black_block_2 "not clear".
- We need to hold blue_block_1 at some point.

Let's revise the plan:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1.
2. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1 (satisfying the constraint that we should hold blue_block_1).
3. Stack blue_block_1 on top of black_block_2 (making black_block_2 "not clear" to satisfy the first constraint).
4. Unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1.
5. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table (achieving the goal).

Let me check if this plan satisfies all the constraints:

1. At some point, black_block_2 is not clear: Yes, after step 3, blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2.
2. At some point, black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1: I noted earlier that this is confusing, as black_block_1 was never on top of brown_block_1 in the initial state. But I think this is satisfied in our plan since black_block_1 remains on the table throughout.
3. The constraint related to "if black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1": This is a bit confusing too, since black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1 in the initial state. If we interpret it to mean "at any state where black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1", then at state 4, brown_block_1 is not clear as the robot is holding it.
4. At some point, the robot is holding blue_block_1: Yes, after step 2.

Hmm, I'm not sure if we're satisfying constraint 3 correctly. Let me think about it again.

Constraint 3 says: "If expression "black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1" holds in some state s, then expression "At least one of the following conditions is true: "red_block_1 is not on the table", "there is a block on top of brown_block_1, i.e., brown_block_1 is not clear"" must hold at s or at some state after s."

Given that black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1 in the initial state, we need to ensure that at some point in our plan, either red_block_1 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear.

Our current plan doesn't move red_block_1 off the table. However, after step 4, the robot is holding brown_block_1, which means brown_block_1 is not clear (since "clear" means no block on top, and being held by the robot means it's not "on top" of anything).

But on second thought, I'm not sure if "being held by the robot" means a block is "not clear". Let's assume to be safe that we need to ensure either red_block_1 is not on the table or brown_block_1 has a block on top of it.

In our revised plan, we'll stack a block (like blue_block_1) on top of brown_block_1 at some point:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1.
2. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1 (satisfying the constraint that we should hold blue_block_1).
3. Stack blue_block_1 on top of brown_block_1 (making brown_block_1 "not clear" to satisfy constraint 3).
4. Unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_1.
5. Stack blue_block_1 on top of black_block_2 (making black_block_2 "not clear" to satisfy the first constraint).
6. Unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1.
7. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table (achieving the goal).

Hmm, but this violates the requirement that the robot can only hold one block at a time. Let's revise again:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1.
2. Putdown black_block_2 on the table.
3. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1 (satisfying the constraint that we should hold blue_block_1).
4. Stack blue_block_1 on top of brown_block_1 (making brown_block_1 "not clear" to satisfy constraint 3).
5. Unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_1.
6. Pickup black_block_2 from the table.
7. Stack black_block_2 on top of blue_block_1 (making black_block_2 "not clear" to satisfy the first constraint, but this seems redundant because black_block_2 is already not clear in the initial state).
8. Unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1.
9. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table (achieving the goal).

Hm, but that's not quite right. black_block_2 is clear in the initial state (it is on top of blue_block_1 and nothing is on top of black_block_2 as stated in the initial conditions). Let me revise the plan once more:

1. Unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1 (the robot holds brown_block_1).
2. Stack brown_block_1 on top of black_block_2 (making black_block_2 "not clear" to satisfy the first constraint).
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from black_block_2 (the robot holds brown_block_1).
4. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table (achieving the goal).
5. Unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1 (the robot holds black_block_2).
6. Putdown black_block_2 on the table.
7. Pickup blue_block_1 from black_block_1 (satisfying the constraint that the robot should hold blue_block_1).
8. Putdown blue_block_1 on the table.

Actually, wait a minute. I think I'm overthinking this. The initial state is:

**Initial State:**
- red_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- black_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- black_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- brown_block_1 is clear
- black_block_2 is clear
- green_block_1 is clear
- the robot is not holding any block

And the constraints are:

1. At some point, black_block_2 should not be clear (i.e., a block should be on top of it).
2. At some point, black_block_1 should not be on top of brown_block_1 (this is already satisfied in the initial state).
3. If black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1 at some state s, then at that state or a later state, at least one of the following should be true:
   - red_block_1 is not on the table
   - brown_block_1 is not clear
4. At some point, the robot should be holding blue_block_1.

Since constraint 2 is already satisfied in the initial state, constraint 3 must be satisfied at some point during our plan. Let's revise once more:

1. Unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1 (the robot holds brown_block_1, which makes brown_block_1 "not clear").
2. Stack brown_block_1 on top of black_block_2 (making black_block_2 "not clear" to satisfy the first constraint).
3. Unstack brown_block_1 from black_block_2 (the robot holds brown_block_1).
4. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table (achieving the goal).
5. Unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1 (the robot holds black_block_2).
6. Putdown black_block_2 on the table.
7. Pickup blue_block_1 from black_block_1 (satisfying the constraint that the robot should hold blue_block_1).
8. Putdown blue_block_1 on the table.

Actually, let me re-read constraint 3, since I think I keep misinterpreting it:
"If expression 'black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "red_block_1 is not on the table", "there is a block on top of brown_block_1, i.e., brown_block_1 is not clear"' must hold at s or at some state after s."

This means that at any state where black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1, we must ensure that at that state or a later state, either red_block_1 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear.

Given that black_block_1 is initially not on top of brown_block_1, this constraint applies right from the beginning. So, we need to ensure that at the beginning or at some point in our plan, either red_block_1 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear.

In the initial state, brown_block_1 is clear (as stated). So, we need to make sure that at some point, either red_block_1 is not on the table or a block is placed on top of brown_block_1. 

Let's revise the plan to ensure we satisfy all constraints:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1 (the robot holds black_block_2).
2. Stack black_block_2 on top of brown_block_1 (making brown_block_1 "not clear" to satisfy constraint 3).
3. Unstack black_block_2 from brown_block_1 (the robot holds black_block_2).
4. Stack black_block_2 on top of green_block_1 (the robot no longer holds black_block_2).
5. Unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1 (the robot holds brown_block_1).
6. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table (achieving the goal).
7. Unstack black_block_2 from green_block_1 (the robot holds black_block_2).
8. Stack black_block_2 on top of brown_block_1 (making black_block_2 "not clear" to satisfy the first constraint - wait, I am getting confused, remember the constraint is to make black_block_2 "not clear" but that would need a block on top of black_block_2.)
9. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1 (satisfying the constraint that the robot should hold blue_block_1).
10. Stack blue_block_1 on top of black_block_2 (making black_block_2 "not clear" to satisfy the first constraint).

Ugh, this plan is getting unwieldy. Let me simplify and focus on the key constraints.

Actually, let me revise this yet again. I think I was overthinking. The goal is simple: to have brown_block_1 on the table. The constraints are:

1. At some point, black_block_2 should not be clear (i.e., a block should be on top of it).
2. At some point, black_block_1 should not be on top of brown_block_1.
3. If black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1 at some state s, then at that state or a later state, at least one of the following should be true:
   - red_block_1 is not on the table
   - brown_block_1 is not clear
4. At some point, the robot should be holding blue_block_1.

Let's craft a simple, step-by-step plan that achieves the goal and satisfies all constraints:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1.
2. Putdown black_block_2 on the table.
3. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1 (satisfying constraint 4: the robot holds blue_block_1).
4. Stack blue_block_1 on top of brown_block_1 (satisfying constraint 3: brown_block_1 is not clear).
5. Unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1. (Wait, we can't do this because blue_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1.)

OK, now I'm realizing that blue_block_1 prevents us from unstacking brown_block_1 from red_block_1. Let's revise:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1.
2. Putdown black_block_2 on the table.
3. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1 (satisfying constraint 4: the robot holds blue_block_1).
4. Stack blue_block_1 on top of black_block_2 (satisfying constraint 1: black_block_2 is not clear).
5. Unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1.
6. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table (achieving the goal).

This plan achieves the goal and satisfies constraints 1 and 4. But we're missing constraint 3. Since we haven't actively made black_block_1 be on top of brown_block_1, constraint 2 is also satisfied by default (as it was in the initial state).

But for constraint 3, since black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1 throughout our plan, we must ensure that at some point, either red_block_1 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear.

Let's revise:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1.
2. Putdown black_block_2 on the table.
3. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1 (satisfying constraint 4: the robot holds blue_block_1).
4. Stack blue_block_1 on top of brown_block_1 (satisfying constraint 3: brown_block_1 is not clear).
5. Unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_1.
6. Stack blue_block_1 on top of black_block_2 (satisfying constraint 1: black_block_2 is not clear).
7. Unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1.
8. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table (achieving the goal).

This plan achieves the goal and satisfies all four constraints.

Actually, I think I've been misinterpreting constraint 3. Let me reread it:
"If expression 'black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "red_block_1 is not on the table", "there is a block on top of brown_block_1, i.e., brown_block_1 is not clear"' must hold at s or at some state after s."

Since black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1 in the initial state, this constraint applies to the initial state. In the initial state, brown_block_1 is clear (as stated). So, we're not satisfying the constraint in the initial state. We need to ensure that at some point after the initial state, either red_block_1 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear.

My previous plan addresses this, but I wasn't sure if I was correctly interpreting the constraint. I think my interpretation is correct, and the plan should work.

To verify, let me trace through my plan to ensure all constraints are met:

**Initial State:**
- red_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- black_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
- black_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1
- brown_block_1 is clear
- black_block_2 is clear
- green_block_1 is clear
- the robot is not holding any block

**Steps:**
1. Unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1.
   After this step, the robot is holding black_block_2, blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1, and blue_block_1 is clear.

2. Putdown black_block_2 on the table.
   After this step, black_block_2 is on the table, black_block_2 is clear, and the robot is not holding any block.

3. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1.
   After this step, the robot is holding blue_block_1 (satisfying constraint 4), black_block_1 is on the table, and black_block_1 is clear.

4. Stack blue_block_1 on top of brown_block_1.
   After this step, blue_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1, blue_block_1 is clear, brown_block_1 is not clear (satisfying constraint 3), and the robot is not holding any block.

5. Unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_1.
   After this step, the robot is holding blue_block_1, brown_block_1 is clear, and brown_block_1 is on top of red_block_1.

6. Stack blue_block_1 on top of black_block_2.
   After this step, blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2, blue_block_1 is clear, black_block_2 is not clear (satisfying constraint 1), and the robot is not holding any block.

7. Unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1.
   After this step, the robot is holding brown_block_1, red_block_1 is on the table, and red_block_1 is clear.

8. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table.
   After this step, brown_block_1 is on the table (achieving the goal), brown_block_1 is clear, and the robot is not holding any block.

All constraints are met, and the goal is achieved. This plan should work.

Actually, one more thing. Let me double check I've understood constraint 2:
"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1'"

This constraint means that at some point, the state of the world should be such that black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1. In the initial state, black_block_1 is on the table and brown_block_1 is on top of red_block_1. So, black_block_1 is already not on top of brown_block_1 in the initial state. This constraint is already satisfied in the initial state.

This is true throughout our plan, so constraint 2 is satisfied.

I believe the plan is correct and achieves the goal while respecting all constraints.

Let me double-check once more:

1. Constraint 1: At some point, there's a block on top of black_block_2. Satisfied in step 6, where blue_block_1 is placed on top of black_block_2.
2. Constraint 2: At some point, black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1. Satisfied as black_block_1 is never on top of brown_block_1 in our plan.
3. Constraint 3: If black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1 at state s, then at s or a later state, either red_block_1 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear. Satisfied in step 4, where brown_block_1 is not clear because blue_block_1 is on top of it.
4. Constraint 4: At some point, the robot is holding blue_block_1. Satisfied in step 3.

And we achieve our goal of having brown_block_1 on the table in step 8.

So, the final plan is:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1.
2. Putdown black_block_2 on the table.
3. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1.
4. Stack blue_block_1 on top of brown_block_1.
5. Unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_1.
6. Stack blue_block_1 on top of black_block_2.
7. Unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1.
8. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table.

Let me just think if there's a more optimal plan (with fewer steps):

I'm trying to construct a shorter plan, but it seems like the main constraints are:
1. We need to place a block on top of black_block_2 at some point.
2. We need to place a block on top of brown_block_1 at some point (because of constraint 3).
3. We need to hold blue_block_1 at some point.

Additionally, we need to achieve the goal of having brown_block_1 on the table.

Given these requirements, it's hard to construct a shorter plan. For instance, the constraint 3 forces us to place a block on top of brown_block_1, which adds steps. Similarly, we need to hold blue_block_1 and place a block on top of black_block_2.

OK, let me step back and think: What's the shortest plan to achieve the goal, and do we need to add additional steps to satisfy constraints?

The goal is to have brown_block_1 on the table. From the initial state, the steps would be:
1. Unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1.
2. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table.

But we also have constraints:
1. At some point, black_block_2 should not be clear.
2. At some point, black_block_1 should not be on top of brown_block_1 (already satisfied in the initial state).
3. If black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1 at state s, then at s or a later state, either red_block_1 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear.
4. At some point, the robot should be holding blue_block_1.

Since black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1 in the initial state (and in all states in our basic plan), constraint 3 is triggered. We need to ensure that at some state, either red_block_1 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear.

In our basic plan, red_block_1 remains on the table. So, to satisfy the constraint, we would need to ensure brown_block_1 is not clear at some point. But that means adding more steps, so we're back to a longer plan.

Let's go with our previous plan; let me restate it once more:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1.
2. Putdown black_block_2 on the table.
3. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1.
4. Stack blue_block_1 on top of brown_block_1.
5. Unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_1.
6. Stack blue_block_1 on top of black_block_2.
7. Unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1.
8. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table.

Actually, if the goal is to find the most optimal plan while satisfying all constraints, there might be a shorter plan:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1.
2. Stack black_block_2 on top of brown_block_1. (This satisfies constraint 3, as brown_block_1 is not clear.)
3. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1. (This satisfies constraint 4, as the robot is holding blue_block_1.)
4. Stack blue_block_1 on top of black_block_2. (This satisfies constraint 1, as black_block_2 is not clear.)
5. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2.
6. Putdown blue_block_1 on the table.
7. Unstack black_block_2 from brown_block_1.
8. Putdown black_block_2 on the table.
9. Unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1.
10. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table. (Achieving the goal.)

Hmm, but this plan is longer than our previous one. So, our original plan seems to be more optimal.

Actually, I still think our original plan can be optimized. Let me consider what would happen if we place blue_block_1 on a block other than black_block_2. This would free us from the need to unstack it later:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1.
2. Putdown black_block_2 on the table.
3. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1. (This satisfies constraint 4, as the robot is holding blue_block_1.)
4. Stack blue_block_1 on top of brown_block_1. (This satisfies constraint 3, as brown_block_1 is not clear.)
5. Unstack black_block_2 from the table.
6. Stack black_block_2 on top of black_block_1.
7. Unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_1.
8. Stack blue_block_1 on top of black_block_2. (This satisfies constraint 1, as black_block_2 is not clear.)
9. Unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1.
10. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table. (Achieving the goal.)

But this is 10 steps, and our original version is 8 steps.

It seems like the plan I listed originally is the most optimal one I can come up with.

1. Unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1.
2. Putdown black_block_2 on the table.
3. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1.
4. Stack blue_block_1 on top of brown_block_1.
5. Unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_1.
6. Stack blue_block_1 on top of black_block_2.
7. Unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1.
8. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table.

Actually, let me try a slightly different approach. Let me see if there's a different way to satisfy constraint 3:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1.
2. Putdown black_block_2 on the table.
3. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1. (This satisfies constraint 4, as the robot is holding blue_block_1.)
4. Putdown blue_block_1 on the table.
5. Unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1.
6. Stack brown_block_1 on top of black_block_2. (This makes black_block_2 "not clear", satisfying constraint 1.)
7. Pickup red_block_1 from the table. (This ensures red_block_1 is not on the table, satisfying constraint 3 since black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1).
8. Putdown red_block_1 on the table.
9. Unstack brown_block_1 from black_block_2.
10. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table. (Achieving the goal.)

But this is 10 steps again.

Let me try once more with a slightly different strategy:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1.
2. Stack black_block_2 on top of brown_block_1. (This makes brown_block_1 "not clear", satisfying constraint 3.)
3. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1. (This satisfies constraint 4, as the robot is holding blue_block_1.)
4. Stack blue_block_1 on top of black_block_2. (This makes black_block_2 "not clear", satisfying constraint 1.)
5. Unstack black_block_2 from brown_block_1. (Oh wait, can't do this because blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_2.)

Back to our 8-step plan, which I believe is optimal:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1.
2. Putdown black_block_2 on the table.
3. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1.
4. Stack blue_block_1 on top of brown_block_1.
5. Unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_1.
6. Stack blue_block_1 on top of black_block_2.
7. Unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1.
8. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table.

Actually, I see one more optimization. Step 6 isn't strictly necessary for the goal. We can omit it, which would give us a 7-step plan:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1.
2. Putdown black_block_2 on the table.
3. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1.
4. Stack blue_block_1 on top of brown_block_1.
5. Unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_1.
6. Unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1.
7. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table.

But wait, we're missing constraint 1: At some point, black_block_2 should not be clear.

One more time. Is it possible to achieve all constraints with fewer steps?

Let me try another angle. Maybe we can maintain the 8-step plan but rearrange some steps to optimize:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1.
2. Stack black_block_2 on top of green_block_1.
3. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1.
4. Stack blue_block_1 on top of brown_block_1.
5. Unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_1.
6. Stack blue_block_1 on top of black_block_2.
7. Unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1.
8. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table.

This is still 8 steps. I don't see a plan with fewer steps that satisfies all constraints.

One final attempt - in this approach, I'll try to be strategic. Maybe I can "kill two birds with one stone" at some point:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1.
2. Stack black_block_2 on top of brown_block_1. (This makes brown_block_1 "not clear", satisfying constraint 3.)
3. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1. (This satisfies constraint 4, as the robot is holding blue_block_1.)
4. Stack blue_block_1 on top of black_block_2. (This makes black_block_2 "not clear", satisfying constraint 1.)
5. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_2.
6. Putdown blue_block_1 on the table.
7. Unstack black_block_2 from brown_block_1.
8. Putdown black_block_2 on the table.
9. Unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1.
10. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table. (Achieving the goal.)

But this is still 10 steps, longer than our previous 8-step plan.

I've tried several angles, and I believe the 8-step plan I identified earlier is optimal for this problem:

1. Unstack black_block_2 from blue_block_1.
2. Putdown black_block_2 on the table.
3. Unstack blue_block_1 from black_block_1.
4. Stack blue_block_1 on top of brown_block_1.
5. Unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_1.
6. Stack blue_block_1 on top of black_block_2.
7. Unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1.
8. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table.

This plan achieves the goal and satisfies all constraints in the fewest steps I've been able to identify.
