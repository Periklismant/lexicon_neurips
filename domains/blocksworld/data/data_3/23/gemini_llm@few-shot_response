Okay, let's break this down. We need to get brown_block_1 on the table. Here's the initial situation:

*   red_block_1 is on the table
*   brown_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
*   black_block_1 is on the table
*   blue_block_1 is on top of black_block_1
*   black_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
*   yellow_block_1 is on the table
*   green_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_1

And here are the constraints:

1.  black_block_2 must be covered at some point.
2.  black_block_1 must not be on top of brown_block_1 at some point.
3.  If black_block_1 is not on top of brown_block_1, then either red_block_1 is not on the table or brown_block_1 is not clear must hold at that state or a state after that.
4.  We must be holding blue_block_1 at some point.

Here's a plan that addresses these constraints:

```
```
unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
pickup black_block_2
stack black_block_2 green_block_1
pickup blue_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
```
