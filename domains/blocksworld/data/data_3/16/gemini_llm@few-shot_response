Okay, let's break this down. The goal is to make black_block_1 clear. Currently, yellow_block_3 is on green_block_2, which is on black_block_1. So, we need to remove yellow_block_3 and green_block_2 from black_block_1.

Here's the plan, considering the constraints:

1.  Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2.
2.  Putdown yellow_block_3 on the table (violates the constraint "yellow_block_3 is not on the table"). So, we need to stack it on another block.
3.  Stack yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1. This satisfies the constraint "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding grey_block_1", "grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3"".
4.  Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1.
5.  Putdown green_block_2 on the table.
This satisfies the constraint "black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1" and "black_block_1 is not on the table".

```
```
unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2
stack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1
unstack green_block_2 black_block_1
putdown green_block_2
```
