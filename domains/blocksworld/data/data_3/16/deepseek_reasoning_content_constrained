Okay, let's see. I need to solve this Blocksworld planning problem. The goal is to make sure that black_block_1 is clear in the final state. The initial state has green_block_2 on top of black_block_1, and yellow_block_3 on top of green_block_2. So to clear black_block_1, I need to remove green_block_2 from it. But there's also yellow_block_3 on green_block_2, so I need to move that first.

Let me start by looking at the initial state. The blocks are arranged as follows:

- green_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on it, and yellow_block_2 on top of yellow_block_1.
- black_block_1 has green_block_2, which in turn has yellow_block_3.
- grey_block_1 is on the table, clear.

The goal is to have black_block_1 clear. So the main task is to remove green_block_2 from black_block_1. But green_block_2 is under yellow_block_3. So I need to first unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2, then unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1.

But there are constraints to consider. Let's list the constraints:

1. At least one of "holding grey_block_1" or "grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3" must be true in at least one state.
2. In every state, yellow_block_3 must not be on the table. So once we move it, we can't put it down on the table. We have to stack it somewhere else.
3. At least one state must have "black_block_1 not on grey_block_1". Since initially, black_block_1 is on the table, and grey_block_1 is also on the table, they're separate. So maybe this condition is already true in the initial state. Wait, the initial state has black_block_1 on the table, not on grey_block_1. So maybe that constraint is already satisfied. But the problem says "must hold in at least one state", so maybe it's already met. However, the fourth constraint says that if in some state s, black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1, then in s or a later state, black_block_1 is not on the table. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse it again.

The fourth constraint: If in any state s, black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1, then in s or a subsequent state, black_block_1 must not be on the table. Wait, so if black_block_1 is ever not on grey_block_1, then eventually black_block_1 must be off the table. But in the initial state, black_block_1 is on the table, not on grey_block_1. So according to constraint 4, since in the initial state, black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1 (it's on the table), then in that state or some later state, black_block_1 must not be on the table. That means we have to move black_block_1 off the table at some point. But our goal is to make black_block_1 clear. Wait, the goal is just that black_block_1 is clear. So if we move black_block_1 off the table, but that's impossible because blocks can only be on the table or on another block. Wait, but the problem says "the task is to bring about the following situation: there is no block on top of black_block_1". So black_block_1 can remain on the table as long as nothing is on top of it. But according to the fourth constraint, since the initial state already has black_block_1 not on grey_block_1, we must have that in the initial state or later, black_block_1 is not on the table. But in the initial state, black_block_1 is on the table, so that violates the fourth constraint. Wait, no. The fourth constraint says: If in a state s, black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1, then in s or later, black_block_1 is not on the table. So in the initial state, s0, black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1 (since it's on the table). Therefore, according to the constraint, in s0 or later, black_block_1 must not be on the table. But in s0, it is on the table. Therefore, we must have that at some state after s0, black_block_1 is not on the table. So we need to move black_block_1 from the table to on top of some block. But our goal is to have black_block_1 clear. Wait, but if black_block_1 is on another block, then it's not on the table, but that's okay. But the goal is only that nothing is on top of black_block_1. So if black_block_1 is on top of another block, say grey_block_1, then black_block_1 is clear (since nothing is on it), but grey_block_1 would have black_block_1 on it. However, the goal is only about black_block_1 being clear, not about where it is. So to satisfy constraint 4, we must move black_block_1 off the table at some point. But the goal doesn't require that. So even if in the final state, black_block_1 is on the table, but that would violate constraint 4 because in the initial state, the condition triggers, so the black_block_1 must be moved off the table in some subsequent state. Wait, but the problem says that the constraints must be satisfied in the plan. So even if the final state has black_block_1 on the table, but according to constraint 4, since in the initial state (s0) black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1, then in s0 or later, black_block_1 must not be on the table. But s0 is part of the plan's states. However, in s0, black_block_1 is on the table, so the constraint would require that either s0 meets the consequent (black_block_1 not on the table), which it doesn't, so we have to have in some state after s0, black_block_1 is not on the table. Therefore, in our plan, we must move black_block_1 from the table to somewhere else. But how? Because initially, black_block_1 is under green_block_2. So first, we have to remove green_block_2 and yellow_block_3 from black_block_1. Then, we can pick up black_block_1 and place it on another block. But the goal is only to have black_block_1 clear. So perhaps after moving green_block_2 and yellow_block_3 off, we can put black_block_1 back on the table. But wait, if we put it back on the table, then in the final state, it's on the table. However, constraint 4 says that if at any state, black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1, then in that state or a subsequent one, black_block_1 is not on the table. But the initial state already violates that? Wait, the constraint is that in every state where black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1, then in that state or a later one, black_block_1 is not on the table. So the initial state is s0, where black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1 and is on the table. Therefore, according to the constraint, there must be some state after s0 where black_block_1 is not on the table. So even if in the final state we put it back on the table, but that would be after moving it off. Wait, no. The constraint says that for every state s where black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1, in s or a subsequent state, black_block_1 is not on the table. So in s0, which is such a state, we have to ensure that either in s0, black_block_1 is not on the table (which it isn't), but wait, in s0, black_block_1 is on the table. So the condition is that if in s, black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1, then in s or later, black_block_1 is not on the table. So for s0, which is a state where black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1, we must have that in s0 or later, black_block_1 is not on the table. But in s0, it is on the table. Therefore, the constraint requires that in some state after s0, black_block_1 is not on the table. So we have to move black_block_1 off the table at some point. But the goal doesn't require that. So even if the final state has black_block_1 on the table, but during the plan, we moved it off and then back on, that would satisfy the constraint. Because once we move it off, there's a state where it's not on the table, which would satisfy the requirement for s0. Wait, no. The constraint is that for each state s where the antecedent holds, the consequent must hold in s or a subsequent state. So for s0, we need that in s0 or later, black_block_1 is not on the table. Since in s0 it is on the table, we need that in some state after s0, it's not on the table. So even if we move it off and then back on, there exists a state where it's not on the table, which would satisfy the requirement. But if we move it off and then put it back on, then in the final state it's on the table. But the constraint is satisfied as long as there's at least one state after s0 where it's not on the table. So perhaps that's manageable.

But let's outline the steps. The main goal is to clear black_block_1. To do that, we need to remove green_block_2 from it. But green_block_2 has yellow_block_3 on it. So first, unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2. Then unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. But after that, we have to deal with the constraints.

Constraints:

1. At least one state must have either holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3. So we need to either pick up grey_block_1 at some point or stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3. But yellow_block_3 is initially on green_block_2. Wait, but after we unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2, we have to put it somewhere. Since the second constraint says that yellow_block_3 must not be on the table in any state. So we can't putdown yellow_block_3; we have to stack it on another block. So possible options are to stack it on another block, like grey_block_1. But then, stacking grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3 would require that yellow_block_3 is clear. Wait, but maybe we need to stack grey_block_1 onto yellow_block_3. Let's see.

Another constraint is that in every state, yellow_block_3 is not on the table. So during the entire plan, whenever we move yellow_block_3, we must stack it onto another block, never put it down.

So the steps so far:

1. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2. But to unstack, the robotic arm must be empty. Since we start with the arm empty, that's possible. So:

Action: unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2

After this, the arm is holding yellow_block_3. Then we need to stack it somewhere. But where? It can't go on the table. So possible options: stack it on grey_block_1 (which is clear and on the table). But to stack, the target block must be clear. So stack yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1. But wait, the second constraint says that in every state, yellow_block_3 is not on the table. Stacking it on grey_block_1 would keep it off the table, but grey_block_1 is on the table. So yellow_block_3 would be on grey_block_1, which is on the table. That's allowed. So:

Action: stack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1

But then, this satisfies the second constraint because yellow_block_3 is on grey_block_1, not the table. Also, this action would make grey_block_1 have yellow_block_3 on top, so grey_block_1 is no longer clear. Then, we can proceed to unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. But after unstacking yellow_block_3, we have green_block_2 clear. So:

Action: unstack green_block_2 black_block_1

Then, we need to putdown or stack green_block_2. But putting it down would be putdown, which is allowed. Wait, but putting it on the table is okay. So:

Action: putdown green_block_2

But wait, after putting it down, green_block_2 is on the table, clear. Then, black_block_1 is clear, which is the goal. But we have to check the constraints.

But let's check the first constraint: at least one state must have holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3. In the current steps, after stacking yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1, we have grey_block_1 with yellow_block_3 on top. So that satisfies the second part of the first constraint (grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3? Wait, no. If we stack yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1, then yellow_block_3 is on grey_block_1, not the other way around. So the condition would be "grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3" which is not the case here. So that's not satisfying the first constraint. Therefore, we need to have either hold grey_block_1 or have grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3. So maybe in the plan, we need to have grey_block_1 stacked on yellow_block_3. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps after moving yellow_block_3, we can pick up grey_block_1 and stack it on yellow_block_3. But yellow_block_3 is already on grey_block_1 in the previous step. Wait, no. If we first stack yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1, then yellow_block_3 is on grey_block_1. Then to have grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3, we would need to stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3. But that would require that yellow_block_3 is clear. But after stacking yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1, grey_block_1 is not clear, so we can't stack anything on it. Alternatively, maybe we need to find another way.

Alternatively, after unstacking yellow_block_3 from green_block_2, instead of stacking it on grey_block_1, maybe stack it on another block. For example, stack it on yellow_block_2, which is on top of yellow_block_1. But yellow_block_2 is clear initially. So:

Action: stack yellow_block_3 yellow_block_2

But after that, yellow_block_2 is no longer clear. Then, proceed to unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1, put it down. Then, we need to handle the first constraint. To satisfy the first constraint, we need to either hold grey_block_1 or have grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3 at some point. If we haven't interacted with grey_block_1 yet, maybe we can pick it up and stack it on yellow_block_3. But yellow_block_3 is now on yellow_block_2. So:

After stacking yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2, then we can pick up grey_block_1 (since it's on the table and clear), then stack it on yellow_block_3. But yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_2. So stacking grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3 would require that yellow_block_3 is clear. But after stacking yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2, yellow_block_3 is not clear (since we just put it there). Wait, no. When you stack a block, the target block becomes not clear. So stacking yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2 makes yellow_block_2 not clear, but yellow_block_3 is clear. Wait, no. When you stack x on y, x is on y, y is not clear anymore, and x becomes clear. Wait, the effects of stack x y are: x is on y, x is clear, y is not clear. So after stacking yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2, yellow_block_3 is clear (since nothing is on it), and yellow_block_2 is not clear (since yellow_block_3 is on it). So to stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3, we need yellow_block_3 to be clear, which it is. So yes, after stacking yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2, we can then stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3. That would satisfy the first constraint's condition of grey_block_1 being on yellow_block_3. So that would cover the first constraint.

But let's outline this path:

1. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2 (arm holds yellow_block_3)
2. stack yellow_block_3 yellow_block_2 (arm empty; yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2, which is on yellow_block_1 on green_block_1)
3. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1 (arm holds green_block_2)
4. putdown green_block_2 (now black_block_1 is clear)
5. Now, the goal is achieved. But we need to satisfy the first constraint. So after step 4, we need to do something with grey_block_1. So pick up grey_block_1 (since it's on the table and clear)
6. stack grey_block_1 yellow_block_3 (since yellow_block_3 is clear)
This action would satisfy the first constraint (grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3). Also, the second constraint (yellow_block_3 is not on the table) is satisfied because it's on yellow_block_2. However, after stacking grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3, grey_block_1 is no longer on the table. But the plan's final state would have grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3. But the goal only requires black_block_1 to be clear. So that's okay.

But we also need to check the fourth constraint. Let's see. The fourth constraint says that if in any state s, black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1, then in s or later, black_block_1 is not on the table. So in the initial state s0, black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1 (it's on the table). Therefore, in s0 or later, black_block_1 must not be on the table. But in our plan, after step 4, we put green_block_2 on the table, and black_block_1 is clear and on the table. So in the final state, black_block_1 is on the table. But according to the fourth constraint, since in s0, black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1, we need to have in s0 or later that black_block_1 is not on the table. But in the final state, black_block_1 is on the table. Therefore, this violates the fourth constraint. So our plan is invalid.

Therefore, we need to move black_block_1 off the table at some point. But how? Because black_block_1 is on the table initially. To move it, we need to pick it up. But to pick it up, it has to be clear and on the table. Initially, green_block_2 is on it, so we can't pick it up. After we unstack green_block_2 and put it down, black_block_1 is clear and on the table. So at that point, we can pick it up. Then, we need to stack it somewhere else.

So modifying the plan:

After step 4 (putdown green_block_2), we have black_block_1 clear and on the table. Then, we need to pick up black_block_1 and stack it on another block. Let's say we stack it on grey_block_1. But grey_block_1 is on the table and clear (unless we've used it in another step). Let's see:

5. pickup black_block_1 (preconditions: clear, on table, arm empty. After step 4, arm is empty, black_block_1 is clear and on table. So possible.)
6. stack black_block_1 grey_block_1 (now black_block_1 is on grey_block_1, which is on the table. This satisfies the fourth constraint because now black_block_1 is not on the table. So in some state after s0 (step 6), black_block_1 is not on the table. Therefore, the constraint is satisfied.

But stacking black_block_1 on grey_block_1 would require that grey_block_1 is clear. After step 4, grey_block_1 is clear. So yes. Then, after stacking, black_block_1 is on grey_block_1. Now, the goal is that black_block_1 is clear. But after stacking, black_block_1 is on grey_block_1 and is clear (since nothing is on top of it). So the goal is achieved. Also, the fourth constraint is satisfied because black_block_1 is not on the table in step 6 and onwards.

But we also need to satisfy the first constraint. In the current plan, after step 6, we have grey_block_1 under black_block_1. The first constraint requires that in at least one state, either holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3. In this plan, grey_block_1 is under black_block_1, not on yellow_block_3. So that doesn't satisfy the first constraint. So we need to find a way to have either hold grey_block_1 or stack it on yellow_block_3.

Alternatively, after step 6, perhaps we can unstack black_block_1 from grey_block_1 and put it back on the table. But that would violate the fourth constraint again. Because if we put it back on the table, then after that state, black_block_1 is on the table, but the constraint requires that once it's not on grey_block_1, it must not be on the table. So putting it back on the table would violate the constraint.

Alternatively, maybe stack black_block_1 on another block. Let's say after stacking black_block_1 on grey_block_1, we then pick up grey_block_1. But grey_block_1 has black_block_1 on it, so it's not clear. Can't pick it up. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, during the plan, after moving yellow_block_3 and green_block_2, handle grey_block_1.

Wait, let's try a different approach. Let's first handle the constraint related to grey_block_1. The first constraint requires that in at least one state, we are holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3. So perhaps we can stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3 after moving yellow_block_3.

So:

1. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2
2. stack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1 (but wait, grey_block_1 is on the table and clear. So stacking yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1 would make grey_block_1 not clear. But then, we can stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3. Wait, no. If yellow_block_3 is on grey_block_1, then grey_block_1 is under yellow_block_3. To stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3, we would need to pick up grey_block_1, but it has yellow_block_3 on top. So that's impossible.

Alternatively, stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3. For that, we need to pick up grey_block_1 and stack it on yellow_block_3. But where is yellow_block_3?

After step 1: unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2 (holding it)
Step 2: stack yellow_block_3 on some block, say yellow_block_2 (as before)
Then, grey_block_1 is still on the table and clear. So step 3: pickup grey_block_1
Step 4: stack grey_block_1 yellow_block_3 (now grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3, which is on yellow_block_2. This satisfies the first constraint because grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3)
Then proceed to unstack green_block_2 and handle black_block_1.

But let's see:

1. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2
2. stack yellow_block_3 yellow_block_2 (arm empty)
3. pickup grey_block_1
4. stack grey_block_1 yellow_block_3 (now grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3, satisfying constraint 1)
5. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1 (arm holds green_block_2)
6. putdown green_block_2 (now black_block_1 is clear)
7. Now, handle the fourth constraint by moving black_block_1 off the table.
7. pickup black_block_1 (possible, as it's clear and on table)
8. stack black_block_1 grey_block_1 (but grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3. So stacking black_block_1 on grey_block_1 would put it on top of grey_block_1, which is on yellow_block_3. This is allowed. Then, black_block_1 is not on the table, satisfying constraint 4.

But after step 8, black_block_1 is on grey_block_1, which is on yellow_block_3. So black_block_1 is clear, satisfying the goal. The constraints:

- Constraint 1: step 4 has grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3, so satisfied.
- Constraint 2: yellow_block_3 is never on the table. It's on yellow_block_2 then on grey_block_1. Wait, no. After step 2, yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_2. After step 4, grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3, so yellow_block_3 is under grey_block_1, which is on yellow_block_3. Wait, no. Stacking grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3 means grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3. So yellow_block_3 is still on yellow_block_2. So yellow_block_3 is not on the table in any state. So constraint 2 is satisfied.

- Constraint 3: at least one state where black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1. Initially, it's not on grey_block_1. So constraint 3 is already satisfied.

- Constraint 4: whenever black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1, which is in the initial state and steps 1-7, until step 8. So for all those states, we need that black_block_1 is not on the table in that state or later. In step 7, black_block_1 is picked up (step 7) and then stacked in step 8. So after step 8, black_block_1 is not on the table. So in step 0 (initial state), black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1 and is on the table. So according to constraint 4, by step 8, it's not on the table. So that's satisfied.

This plan seems to satisfy all constraints and the goal.

Let me check the steps again:

1. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2
   - Arm holds yellow_block_3
2. stack yellow_block_3 yellow_block_2
   - yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_2, which is on yellow_block_1 on green_block_1. yellow_block_2 is now not clear.
3. pickup grey_block_1
   - Arm holds grey_block_1. grey_block_1 is clear and on the table.
4. stack grey_block_1 yellow_block_3
   - grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3. Now, yellow_block_3 is not clear. grey_block_1 is clear.
5. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1
   - green_block_2 is clear (after step 1, when yellow_block_3 was removed). Arm holds green_block_2.
6. putdown green_block_2
   - green_block_2 is on the table. Now, black_block_1 is clear. But black_block_1 is still on the table. Need to move it.
7. pickup black_block_1
   - Arm holds black_block_1. black_block_1 is now off the table.
8. stack black_block_1 grey_block_1
   - grey_block_1 is clear (after step 4, grey_block_1 was stacked on yellow_block_3, but in step 4, when you stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3, grey_block_1 is on top, so yellow_block_3 is not clear anymore. Wait, after stacking grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3, yellow_block_3 is under grey_block_1. So to stack black_block_1 on grey_block_1, grey_block_1 must be clear. But after step 4, grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3 and is clear (since nothing is on it). So yes, grey_block_1 is clear. So stacking black_block_1 on grey_block_1 is allowed.

After step 8, black_block_1 is on grey_block_1, which is on yellow_block_3, which is on yellow_block_2. So black_block_1 is clear. The goal is satisfied. All constraints are met.

Now, check if this is the optimal plan (shortest possible). Are there any redundant steps?

Alternative approach: After step 4 (stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3), could we then stack black_block_1 on grey_block_1 without putting down green_block_2 first?

Wait, the steps are:

After unstacking green_block_2 (step 5), we need to put it down (step 6) to clear black_block_1. Then pick up black_block_1 (step 7) and stack it.

Alternatively, could we stack green_block_2 onto another block instead of putting it down, to avoid having to putdown and then pickup again? For example, after unstacking green_block_2, stack it onto grey_block_1. But grey_block_1 is currently holding grey_block_1 after step 3.

Wait, no. Let's re-express the steps:

After step 4, grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3. So grey_block_1 is clear. So when we unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1 (step 5), we can then stack green_block_2 onto grey_block_1. That would be step 6: stack green_block_2 grey_block_1. This would make green_block_2 on grey_block_1, which is on yellow_block_3. Then, black_block_1 is clear. So we don't need to putdown green_block_2. Then, we can proceed to pickup black_block_1 and stack it somewhere else. But where? Maybe stack it on green_block_2. But green_block_2 is on grey_block_1. So stacking black_block_1 on green_block_2 would require green_block_2 to be clear. After stacking green_block_2 on grey_block_1, green_block_2 is clear. So yes.

But then, this would change the steps to:

1. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2
2. stack yellow_block_3 yellow_block_2
3. pickup grey_block_1
4. stack grey_block_1 yellow_block_3
5. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1
6. stack green_block_2 grey_block_1 (grey_block_1 is clear)
7. pickup black_block_1
8. stack black_block_1 green_block_2

This way, steps are reduced. Let's check if this works.

Step 1-4: same as before. Now, after step 4, grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3. Then step 5: unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. Arm holds green_block_2. Step 6: stack green_block_2 on grey_block_1 (which is on yellow_block_3). This makes green_block_2 on grey_block_1. Then, black_block_1 is clear. Now, step 7: pickup black_block_1 (arm is empty, black_block_1 is on table and clear). Stack it on green_block_2 (step 8). Now, black_block_1 is on green_block_2, which is on grey_block_1. So black_block_1 is clear.

This plan has 8 steps, same as before, but perhaps it's more efficient. However, the number of steps is the same, so both are optimal. But maybe this approach is better.

But we need to check constraints:

- Constraint 1: grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3 (step 4) → satisfied.
- Constraint 2: yellow_block_3 is never on the table.
- Constraint 3: black_block_1 not on grey_block_1 in at least one state. Initially, it's not. So satisfied.
- Constraint 4: After step 8, black_block_1 is on green_block_2, so not on the table. So in the initial state, which requires that black_block_1 not be on the table in some subsequent state, which is achieved in step 8.

But this plan has the same number of steps. However, the previous plan had putdown green_block_2 and then pickup black_block_1. This one stacks green_block_2 on grey_block_1, then stacks black_block_1 on green_block_2. Either way, 8 steps.

But perhaps there's a shorter plan. Let's think again.

Alternative plan:

After unstacking yellow_block_3 and stacking it on grey_block_1, then unstack green_block_2, stack it on grey_block_1 (but grey_block_1 already has yellow_block_3). Wait, no. Stacking green_block_2 on grey_block_1 would require grey_block_1 to be clear. But grey_block_1 has yellow_block_3. So that's not possible. So maybe the first approach is better.

Alternatively, after stacking yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1, we can then unstack green_block_2 and stack it on the table. But then we have to move black_block_1 off the table.

Wait, let's consider:

1. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2
2. stack yellow_block_3 grey_block_1
3. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1
4. putdown green_block_2
5. pickup black_block_1
6. stack black_block_1 grey_block_1

This would be 6 steps. But does this satisfy all constraints?

Check constraints:

1. In step 2, yellow_block_3 is on grey_block_1. So grey_block_1 is not on yellow_block_3. The first constraint requires either holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3. So step 2 doesn't satisfy it. So in this plan, we need to either pickup grey_block_1 or have grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3. But in this plan, grey_block_1 is under yellow_block_3. So the first constraint is not satisfied. Therefore, this plan is invalid.

Thus, we need to include steps to handle the first constraint.

So the initial plan with 8 steps seems necessary. But perhaps there's a shorter path.

Wait, what if after unstacking yellow_block_3 and stacking it on grey_block_1 (steps 1 and 2), we then pickup grey_block_1 and stack it on yellow_block_3. But that would require unstacking yellow_block_3 from grey_block_1 first. Which is not possible because yellow_block_3 is under grey_block_1. So no.

Alternatively, after step 1 (unstack yellow_block_3), we can stack it on another block that allows grey_block_1 to be stacked on it later. For example, stack yellow_block_3 on black_block_1. But black_block_1 has green_block_2 on it. So we can't stack there. Or stack on green_block_1, which has yellow_block_1 and yellow_block_2. But yellow_block_2 is clear. So stacking yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2. Then grey_block_1 can be stacked on yellow_block_3.

So steps:

1. unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2
2. stack yellow_block_3 yellow_block_2
3. pickup grey_block_1
4. stack grey_block_1 yellow_block_3 (satisfies constraint 1)
5. unstack green_block_2 black_block_1
6. stack green_block_2 grey_block_1 (grey_block_1 is clear)
7. pickup black_block_1
8. stack black_block_1 green_block_2

This is 8 steps. Same as before. So this seems to be the minimal number of steps.

Alternatively, after step 6, instead of stacking green_block_2 on grey_block_1, we could put it down. But then we have to move it again, which would add steps. So the plan with stacking seems better.

So the optimal plan is likely 8 steps. Let's verify each step's preconditions and effects.

Step 1: unstack yellow_block_3 green_block_2
Preconditions:
- yellow_block_3 is on green_block_2 (yes)
- yellow_block_3 is clear (yes, initial state)
- arm is empty (yes)
Effects:
- arm holds yellow_block_3
- yellow_block_3 is no longer on green_block_2
- green_block_2 is clear

Step 2: stack yellow_block_3 yellow_block_2
Preconditions:
- arm holds yellow_block_3 (yes)
- yellow_block_2 is clear (yes, initially)
Effects:
- yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_2
- yellow_block_2 is not clear
- arm is empty
- yellow_block_3 is clear

Step 3: pickup grey_block_1
Preconditions:
- grey_block_1 is on table (yes)
- grey_block_1 is clear (yes)
- arm is empty (yes)
Effects:
- arm holds grey_block_1
- grey_block_1 is off table

Step 4: stack grey_block_1 yellow_block_3
Preconditions:
- arm holds grey_block_1 (yes)
- yellow_block_3 is clear (yes, after step 2)
Effects:
- grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3
- yellow_block_3 is not clear
- arm is empty
- grey_block_1 is clear

Step 5: unstack green_block_2 black_block_1
Preconditions:
- green_block_2 is on black_block_1 (yes)
- green_block_2 is clear (yes, after step 1)
- arm is empty (yes, after step 4)
Effects:
- arm holds green_block_2
- green_block_2 is not on black_block_1
- black_block_1 is clear

Step 6: stack green_block_2 grey_block_1
Preconditions:
- arm holds green_block_2 (yes)
- grey_block_1 is clear (yes, after step 4)
Effects:
- green_block_2 is on grey_block_1
- grey_block_1 is not clear
- arm is empty
- green_block_2 is clear

Step 7: pickup black_block_1
Preconditions:
- black_block_1 is on table (yes)
- black_block_1 is clear (yes, after step 5)
- arm is empty (yes)
Effects:
- arm holds black_block_1
- black_block_1 is off table

Step 8: stack black_block_1 green_block_2
Preconditions:
- arm holds black_block_1 (yes)
- green_block_2 is clear (yes, after step 6)
Effects:
- black_block_1 is on green_block_2
- green_block_2 is not clear
- arm is empty
- black_block_1 is clear

All preconditions are met, and all effects are applied. The final state has black_block_1 clear (on top of green_block_2), satisfying the goal. All constraints are met:

1. In step 4, grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3 → satisfies the first constraint.
2. yellow_block_3 is never on the table → steps 2 and 4 have it on yellow_block_2 and grey_block_1.
3. The initial state already satisfies "black_block_1 is not on grey_block_1".
4. After step 8, black_block_1 is not on the table → satisfies the fourth constraint.

Thus, this plan is valid and optimal.
