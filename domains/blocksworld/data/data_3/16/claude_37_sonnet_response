Let's break down the problem:

### Objects:
- green_block_1
- yellow_block_1
- black_block_1
- green_block_2
- yellow_block_2
- yellow_block_3
- grey_block_1

### Initial State:
- green_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
- black_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_2 is on top of black_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1
- yellow_block_3 is on top of green_block_2
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_2 is clear
- yellow_block_3 is clear
- grey_block_1 is clear
- the arm is not holding any block

### Goal:
- black_block_1 is clear

### Constraints:
1. At some point, either the arm is holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3.
2. At every state, yellow_block_3 is not on the table.
3. At some point, black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1.
4. If black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1 at some state s, then black_block_1 is not on the table at s or at some later state.

Let's think about the problem. 

The goal is to have black_block_1, but in the initial state, green_block_2 is on top of black_block_1, and yellow_block_3 is on top of green_block_2. 

So, to make black_block_1 clear, I need to remove both yellow_block_3 and green_block_2 from the stack.

Constraints to consider:
- I need to make sure that yellow_block_3 is never directly on the table (constraint 2).
- I need to either hold grey_block_1 at some point or place it on top of yellow_block_3 (constraint 1).
- Constraint 3 says "At some point, black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1". In the initial state, black_block_1 is on the table, not on top of grey_block_1, so this constraint is already satisfied.
- Constraint 4 says if black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1 (which is the case in the initial state), then black_block_1 is not on the table at that state or a later state. But in the initial state, black_block_1 is on the table. This seems like a contradiction.

Wait, I need to interpret constraint 4 correctly. It says if black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1 at some state s, then black_block_1 is not on the table at s or at some later state. The contrapositive of this is: if black_block_1 is on the table at all states from s onwards, then black_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 at state s.

Looking at the initial state again, black_block_1 is on the table and not on top of grey_block_1. Therefore, there must be some later state where black_block_1 is not on the table. I need to ensure this.

So, my plan should:
1. Remove yellow_block_3 and green_block_2 from the stack on top of black_block_1 to make it clear.
2. Ensure yellow_block_3 is never directly on the table.
3. Either hold grey_block_1 at some point or place it on top of yellow_block_3.
4. Ensure black_block_1 is not on the table at some point.

Let me think through a possible plan:

1. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2.
2. Since I can't put yellow_block_3 on the table due to constraint 2, I need to place it on some other clear block. Clear blocks in the initial state are yellow_block_2 and grey_block_1. Let's place it on yellow_block_2.
3. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2.
4. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1.
5. I can place green_block_2 on the table or on some clear block. If I place it on the table, I'd need another clear block to place on it. Let's place it on the table.
6. Putdown green_block_2 on the table.
7. Now, black_block_1 is clear, which satisfies our goal.

But I still need to ensure constraints 1 and 4:
- For constraint 1, I need to either hold grey_block_1 at some point or place it on top of yellow_block_3.
- For constraint 4, I need to ensure black_block_1 is not on the table at some point. This means I need to pick it up.

So, let's adjust the plan:

1. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2.
2. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2.
3. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1.
4. Putdown green_block_2 on the table.
5. Pickup black_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 4).
6. Now, I can either place black_block_1 on the table or on a clear block. Since the goal is for black_block_1 to be clear, and it's already clear in my hand, I'll place it on the table.
7. Putdown black_block_1 on the table.
8. Pickup grey_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 1).
9. (Optional) Putdown grey_block_1 on the table, to get back to a state where black_block_1 is clear.

Actually, I'm still not sure about constraint 1. Let's check if I satisfy it with the plan so far. The constraint says: "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'you are holding grey_block_1', 'grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3'". In step 8, I'm holding grey_block_1, so this should satisfy the constraint.

I think the plan I laid out is valid. Let's refine it:

1. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2.
2. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2.
3. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1.
4. Putdown green_block_2 on the table.
5. Pickup black_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 4).
6. Putdown black_block_1 on the table.
7. Pickup grey_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 1).
8. Putdown grey_block_1 on the table.

This satisfies all constraints and the goal. But wait, I should ensure that black_block_1 remains clear. Let me double-check.

Actually, let's further refine the plan to guarantee that black_block_1 is clear at the end:

1. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2. (Now I'm holding yellow_block_3.)
2. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2. (Now yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_2.)
3. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. (Now I'm holding green_block_2.)
4. Putdown green_block_2 on the table. (Now green_block_2 is on the table.)
5. Pickup black_block_1. (Now I'm holding black_block_1, satisfying constraint 4.)
6. Putdown black_block_1 on the table. (Now black_block_1 is on the table and clear.)
7. Pickup grey_block_1. (Now I'm holding grey_block_1, satisfying constraint 1.)
8. Putdown grey_block_1 on the table. (Now grey_block_1 is on the table.)

The final state is:
- green_block_1 is on the table
- yellow_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
- yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1
- yellow_block_3 is on top of yellow_block_2
- black_block_1 is on the table and clear
- green_block_2 is on the table and clear
- grey_block_1 is on the table and clear
- I'm not holding any block

This satisfies all constraints and the goal.

Actually, I realized I wasn't enumerating all possible options and I may be over-complicating the solution. Let me try to think of a simpler solution.

Starting from the goal, we want black_block_1 to be clear. In the initial state, green_block_2 is on black_block_1, and yellow_block_3 is on green_block_2. So, at the very least, I need to unstack yellow_block_3 and green_block_2.

Looking at the constraints:
1. At some point, either I'm holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3.
2. Yellow_block_3 is never on the table.
3. and 4. are about black_block_1 not being on the table at some point.

Let's try to build a minimal plan that satisfies these constraints and the goal:

1. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2. (Now I'm holding yellow_block_3.)
2. I can't put yellow_block_3 on the table due to constraint 2. So, I need to stack it on some clear block. The clear blocks are yellow_block_2 and grey_block_1. Let's choose grey_block_1.
3. Stack yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1. (Now yellow_block_3 is on grey_block_1.)
4. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. (Now I'm holding green_block_2.)
5. I can place green_block_2 on the table or on a clear block. Let's place it on the table.
6. Putdown green_block_2 on the table. (Now green_block_2 is on the table.)
7. Now, black_block_1 is clear, which satisfies our goal.

Let's check if we satisfy all constraints:
- Constraint 1: We haven't held grey_block_1 and grey_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_3. So, this constraint is not yet satisfied.
- Constraint 2: Yellow_block_3 has never been on the table. It went from green_block_2 to grey_block_1. So, this constraint is satisfied.
- Constraint 3: In the initial state, black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1, so this constraint is already satisfied.
- Constraint 4: Given that black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1 (as per constraint 3), it should not be on the table at some point. But in our plan, black_block_1 remains on the table throughout. So, this constraint is not yet satisfied.

To satisfy constraints 1 and 4, we need to:
- Either hold grey_block_1 at some point or place it on top of yellow_block_3.
- Ensure black_block_1 is not on the table at some point.

Let's adjust the plan:

1. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2. (Now I'm holding yellow_block_3.)
2. Stack yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1. (Now yellow_block_3 is on grey_block_1.)
3. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. (Now I'm holding green_block_2.)
4. Putdown green_block_2 on the table. (Now green_block_2 is on the table.)
5. Pickup black_block_1. (Now I'm holding black_block_1, satisfying constraint 4.)
6. Putdown black_block_1 on the table. (Now black_block_1 is on the table and clear, satisfying the goal.)
7. Unstack yellow_block_3 from grey_block_1. (Now I'm holding yellow_block_3.)
8. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2. (Now yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_2.)
9. Pickup grey_block_1. (Now I'm holding grey_block_1, satisfying constraint 1.)
10. Stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3. (Now grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3, which also satisfies constraint 1.)

Actually, I think I'm over-complicating the solution. Let's try a simpler approach.

Let's revisit constraint 1: "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'you are holding grey_block_1', 'grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3'". This doesn't mean I need to make this true for the entire plan; it just means it should be true at some state.

Similarly, constraint 4 says if black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1 at some state s, then black_block_1 is not on the table at s or at some later state. In the initial state, black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1. So, black_block_1 should not be on the table at some point.

Given these interpretations, here's a minimal plan:

1. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2. (Now I'm holding yellow_block_3.)
2. I need to place yellow_block_3 somewhere, but not on the table (constraint 2). Clear blocks are yellow_block_2 and grey_block_1. Let's place it on grey_block_1.
3. Stack yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1. (Now yellow_block_3 is on grey_block_1.)
4. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. (Now I'm holding green_block_2.)
5. Putdown green_block_2 on the table. (Now green_block_2 is on the table.)
6. Now, black_block_1 is clear, which satisfies our goal.
7. Pickup black_block_1. (Now I'm holding black_block_1, satisfying constraint 4.)
8. Putdown black_block_1 on the table. (Now black_block_1 is on the table and clear.)
9. Pickup grey_block_1. (Now I'm holding grey_block_1, satisfying constraint 1.)
10. Putdown grey_block_1 on the table. (Now grey_block_1 is on the table.)

But there's still a problem, while holding grey_block_1 I can't pick up yellow_block_3 from, as this would violate the constraint that yellow_block_3 is never on the table.

Let's refine the plan:

1. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2. (Now I'm holding yellow_block_3.)
2. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2. (Now yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_2.)
3. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. (Now I'm holding green_block_2.)
4. Putdown green_block_2 on the table. (Now green_block_2 is on the table.)
5. Pickup black_block_1. (Now I'm holding black_block_1, satisfying constraint 4.)
6. Putdown black_block_1 on the table. (Now black_block_1 is on the table and clear.)
7. Pickup grey_block_1. (Now I'm holding grey_block_1, satisfying constraint 1.)
8. Stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3. (Now grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3, also satisfying constraint 1.)

Wait, I still need to double-check if the goal is satisfied. The goal is for black_block_1 to be clear. After step 6, black_block_1 is on the table and clear. So, the goal is satisfied.

Let's check if all constraints are satisfied:
- Constraint 1: At step 7, I'm holding grey_block_1. At step 8, grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3. So, this constraint is satisfied.
- Constraint 2: Yellow_block_3 has never been on the table. It went from green_block_2 to yellow_block_2. So, this constraint is satisfied.
- Constraint 3: In the initial state, black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1, so this constraint is already satisfied.
- Constraint 4: Given that black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1 (as per constraint 3), it should not be on the table at some point. At step 5, I'm holding black_block_1, so it's not on the table. Thus, this constraint is satisfied.

So, the plan should be:

1. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2. (Now I'm holding yellow_block_3.)
2. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2. (Now yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_2.)
3. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. (Now I'm holding green_block_2.)
4. Putdown green_block_2 on the table. (Now green_block_2 is on the table.)
5. Pickup black_block_1. (Now I'm holding black_block_1, satisfying constraint 4.)
6. Putdown black_block_1 on the table. (Now black_block_1 is on the table and clear, satisfying the goal.)
7. Pickup grey_block_1. (Now I'm holding grey_block_1, satisfying constraint 1.)
8. Stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3. (Now grey_block_1 is on yellow_block_3, also satisfying constraint 1.)

But I'm double-checking if this plan is valid and optimal. Let me verify the preconditions of each action:

1. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2: This is valid, as yellow_block_3 is on top of green_block_2, yellow_block_3 is clear, and I'm not holding any block.
2. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2: This is valid, as I'm holding yellow_block_3 and yellow_block_2 is clear.
3. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1: This is valid, as green_block_2 is on top of black_block_1, green_block_2 is clear (after stacking yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2), and I'm not holding any block.
4. Putdown green_block_2 on the table: This is valid, as I'm holding green_block_2.
5. Pickup black_block_1: This is valid, as black_block_1 is on the table, black_block_1 is clear (after unstacking green_block_2), and I'm not holding any block.
6. Putdown black_block_1 on the table: This is valid, as I'm holding black_block_1.
7. Pickup grey_block_1: This is valid, as grey_block_1 is on the table, grey_block_1 is clear, and I'm not holding any block.
8. Stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3: This is valid, as I'm holding grey_block_1 and yellow_block_3 is clear (assuming there's no other block on top of it).

Wait, I think I might have mixed up the state in my head. After step 2, yellow_block_3 is on top of yellow_block_2. Yellow_block_2 is on top of yellow_block_1, which is on top of green_block_1, which is on the table. So, yellow_block_3 is at the top of this stack. Is yellow_block_3 still clear? Let's check.

In the initial state, yellow_block_3 is clear. After I unstack it from green_block_2 and stack it on yellow_block_2, it's still at the top of a stack, so it's still clear. So step 8 is valid.

So, is the final state consistent with the goal?
- black_block_1 is on the table and clear.
- green_block_2 is on the table and clear.
- green_block_1 is on the table, with yellow_block_1 on top, yellow_block_2 on top of that, yellow_block_3 on top of that, and finally, grey_block_1 on the very top.

Yes, black_block_1 is clear, which satisfies the goal.

Are all constraints satisfied?
- Constraint 1: At step 7, I'm holding grey_block_1. At step 8, grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3. So, this constraint is satisfied.
- Constraint 2: Yellow_block_3 has never been on the table. It went from green_block_2 to yellow_block_2. So, this constraint is satisfied.
- Constraint 3: In the initial state, black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1, so this constraint is already satisfied.
- Constraint 4: Given that black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1 (as per constraint 3), it should not be on the table at some point. At step 5, I'm holding black_block_1, so it's not on the table. Thus, this constraint is satisfied.

Great, so the plan is valid and all constraints are satisfied.

Now, let's check if the plan is optimal, i.e., if there's a shorter valid plan.

To achieve the goal (black_block_1 is clear), at the very least, I need to unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2 and unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. That's already 2 steps. Due to constraint 2, I can't place yellow_block_3 on the table, so I need to place it on some other block. That's 1 more step. So, we're at 3 steps.

Due to constraint 4, since black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1 in the initial state, it should not be on the table at some point. So, I need to pick it up at some point, which adds 1 more step. We're at 4 steps.

Due to constraint 1, at some point, either I should be holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 should be on top of yellow_block_3. This adds 1 or 2 more steps, depending on whether I just pick up grey_block_1 or also stack it on yellow_block_3.

If I just pick up grey_block_1, that's 5 steps. But then I'd need to put it down somewhere to have black_block_1 clear at the end, which brings us to 6 steps. If I stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3, that's 6 steps.

So, it seems like a 6-step plan is the shortest possible:
1. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2.
2. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2 (or any other clear block that's not the table).
3. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1.
4. Putdown green_block_2 on the table.
5. Pickup black_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 4).
6. Putdown black_block_1 on the table.
7. Pickup grey_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 1).
8. Stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3 (also to satisfy constraint 1).

Actually, there's a potential 7-step plan:
1. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2.
2. Stack yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1.
3. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1.
4. Putdown green_block_2 on the table.
5. Pickup black_block_1.
6. Putdown black_block_1 on the table.
7. Stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3 (to satisfy constraint 1).

But no, this doesn't work, because at step 7, grey_block_1 is below yellow_block_3, so I can't stack it on top.

What about:
1. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2.
2. Stack yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1.
3. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1.
4. Putdown green_block_2 on the table.
5. Pickup grey_block_1 (with yellow_block_3 on top, to satisfy constraint 1).
6. Stack grey_block_1 (with yellow_block_3 on top) on black_block_1.

No, this doesn't work because I can't pick up grey_block_1 with yellow_block_3 on top; I can only pick up blocks that are clear.

After thinking more comprehensively, the 8-step plan I provided earlier seems to be the shortest valid plan for this problem.

Actually, let's double check whether constraint 1 can actually be satisfied with our plan. Constraint 1 is: "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'you are holding grey_block_1', 'grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3'". At step 7, I'm holding grey_block_1, and at step 8, grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3. So, constraint 1 is satisfied.

So, the final plan is:

1. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2.
2. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2.
3. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1.
4. Putdown green_block_2 on the table.
5. Pickup black_block_1.
6. Putdown black_block_1 on the table.
7. Pickup grey_block_1.
8. Stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3.

This plan satisfies all constraints and the goal, and looks to be optimal.

Let me go over this one more time. Looking at the "optimal plan":

1. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2.
2. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2.
3. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1.
4. Putdown green_block_2 on the table.
5. Pickup black_block_1.
6. Putdown black_block_1 on the table.
7. Pickup grey_block_1.
8. Stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3.

Let me visualize the world state after each action:

Initial state:
- Table: green_block_1, black_block_1, grey_block_1
- green_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on top.
- yellow_block_1 has yellow_block_2 on top.
- yellow_block_2 is clear.
- black_block_1 has green_block_2 on top.
- green_block_2 has yellow_block_3 on top.
- yellow_block_3 is clear.
- grey_block_1 is clear.
- Not holding any block.

After unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2:
- Table: green_block_1, black_block_1, grey_block_1
- green_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on top.
- yellow_block_1 has yellow_block_2 on top.
- yellow_block_2 is clear.
- black_block_1 has green_block_2 on top.
- green_block_2 is clear.
- grey_block_1 is clear.
- Holding yellow_block_3.

After stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2:
- Table: green_block_1, black_block_1, grey_block_1
- green_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on top.
- yellow_block_1 has yellow_block_2 on top.
- yellow_block_2 has yellow_block_3 on top.
- yellow_block_3 is clear.
- black_block_1 has green_block_2 on top.
- green_block_2 is clear.
- grey_block_1 is clear.
- Not holding any block.

After unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1:
- Table: green_block_1, black_block_1, grey_block_1
- green_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on top.
- yellow_block_1 has yellow_block_2 on top.
- yellow_block_2 has yellow_block_3 on top.
- yellow_block_3 is clear.
- black_block_1 is clear.
- grey_block_1 is clear.
- Holding green_block_2.

After putdown green_block_2 on the table:
- Table: green_block_1, black_block_1, grey_block_1, green_block_2
- green_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on top.
- yellow_block_1 has yellow_block_2 on top.
- yellow_block_2 has yellow_block_3 on top.
- yellow_block_3 is clear.
- black_block_1 is clear.
- grey_block_1 is clear.
- green_block_2 is clear.
- Not holding any block.

After pickup black_block_1:
- Table: green_block_1, grey_block_1, green_block_2
- green_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on top.
- yellow_block_1 has yellow_block_2 on top.
- yellow_block_2 has yellow_block_3 on top.
- yellow_block_3 is clear.
- grey_block_1 is clear.
- green_block_2 is clear.
- Holding black_block_1.

After putdown black_block_1 on the table:
- Table: green_block_1, grey_block_1, green_block_2, black_block_1
- green_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on top.
- yellow_block_1 has yellow_block_2 on top.
- yellow_block_2 has yellow_block_3 on top.
- yellow_block_3 is clear.
- grey_block_1 is clear.
- green_block_2 is clear.
- black_block_1 is clear.
- Not holding any block.

After pickup grey_block_1:
- Table: green_block_1, green_block_2, black_block_1
- green_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on top.
- yellow_block_1 has yellow_block_2 on top.
- yellow_block_2 has yellow_block_3 on top.
- yellow_block_3 is clear.
- green_block_2 is clear.
- black_block_1 is clear.
- Holding grey_block_1.

After stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3:
- Table: green_block_1, green_block_2, black_block_1
- green_block_1 has yellow_block_1 on top.
- yellow_block_1 has yellow_block_2 on top.
- yellow_block_2 has yellow_block_3 on top.
- yellow_block_3 has grey_block_1 on top.
- grey_block_1 is clear.
- green_block_2 is clear.
- black_block_1 is clear.
- Not holding any block.

So, in the final state, black_block_1 is on the table and clear, which satisfies the goal.

Let's check if all constraints are satisfied:
- Constraint 1: At step 7, I'm holding grey_block_1, and at step 8, grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3. So, constraint 1 is satisfied.
- Constraint 2: Yellow_block_3 has never been on the table. It went from green_block_2 to yellow_block_2. So, constraint 2 is satisfied.
- Constraint 3: In the initial state, black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1, so constraint 3 is already satisfied.
- Constraint 4: Given that black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1 (as per constraint 3), it should not be on the table at some point. At step 5, I'm holding black_block_1, so it's not on the table. Thus, constraint 4 is satisfied.

Great, so this plan is valid and all constraints are satisfied. Now, let's check if it's optimal.

To achieve the goal (black_block_1 is clear), at the very least, I need to unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2 and unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1. That's already 2 steps. Due to constraint 2, I can't place yellow_block_3 on the table, so I need to place it on some other block. That's 1 more step. So, we're at 3 steps.

Due to constraint 4, since black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1 in the initial state, it should not be on the table at some point. So, I need to pick it up at some point and then put it back down. That's 2 more steps. We're at 5 steps.

Due to constraint 1, at some point, either I should be holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 should be on top of yellow_block_3. Given that we've already satisfied constraint 4 by picking up black_block_1, I'd need to pick up grey_block_1 at the very least. That's 1 more step. We're at 6 steps.

But, in the end, for the goal to be satisfied, black_block_1 needs to be clear. And to ensure other constraints are satisfied (like yellow_block_3 not being on the table), I'd need to place grey_block_1 somewhere. If I place it on yellow_block_3, that's 1 more step. We're at 7 steps.

So, the optimal plan length is at least 7. Let's see if we can find a 7-step plan.

Let me double check:
1. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2 is necessary.
2. Stack yellow_block_3 on some clear block (not the table) is necessary.
3. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1 is necessary.
4. Putdown green_block_2 somewhere is necessary.
5. Pickup black_block_1 is necessary (for constraint 4).
6. Putdown black_block_1 is necessary (for the goal).
7. Pickup grey_block_1 or stack it on top of yellow_block_3 is necessary (for constraint 1).

So, the shortest plan is 7 steps. But I've given an 8-step plan above. Let me check if there's any redundancy.

Our plan is:
1. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2.
2. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2.
3. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1.
4. Putdown green_block_2 on the table.
5. Pickup black_block_1.
6. Putdown black_block_1 on the table.
7. Pickup grey_block_1.
8. Stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3.

On second thought, steps 7 and 8 are both for satisfying constraint 1. If I just pick up grey_block_1 (step 7), constraint 1 is already satisfied, and I don't necessarily need to stack it on yellow_block_3 (step 8). However, if I don't place grey_block_1 somewhere, I'll be holding it at the end, which doesn't satisfy the goal of having black_block_1 clear (since I can only hold one block).

So, it seems like the 8-step plan I provided is indeed the shortest possible for this problem. I've exhausted all possible optimizations, and given the constraints, I can't see how we can shorten the plan further.

So, to reiterate, the optimal plan for this problem is:

1. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2.
2. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2.
3. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1.
4. Putdown green_block_2 on the table.
5. Pickup black_block_1.
6. Putdown black_block_1 on the table.
7. Pickup grey_block_1.
8. Stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3.

This plan satisfies all constraints and the goal, and is optimal.

Though actually, I could be overlooking something. Let me try to rigorously explore all possible valid plans to ensure we're not missing a shorter one.

Alright, let's try to construct the shortest possible plan starting from the initial state, systematically exploring all options:

1. Options for the first action:
   - Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2.
   - Unstack yellow_block_2 from yellow_block_1.
   - Pickup green_block_1 (since it's on the table and clear).
   - Pickup grey_block_1 (since it's on the table and clear).

To satisfy constraint 4, black_block_1 should not be on the table at some point. So, we need to eventually pick it up. But to do that, it needs to be clear. In the initial state, green_block_2 is on top of black_block_1, and yellow_block_3 is on top of green_block_2. So, at the very least, we need to unstack yellow_block_3 and then unstack green_block_2.

Starting with "Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2" is the most direct approach, as it's immediately related to our goal.

2. Options for the second action (after unstacking yellow_block_3):
   - Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2 (since it's clear).
   - Stack yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1 (since it's clear).

To ensure yellow_block_3 is not on the table (constraint 2), we need to place it on another block.

3. Options for the third action (after stacking yellow_block_3 on another block):
   - Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1.

This is the only logical choice to make progress towards the goal.

4. Options for the fourth action (after unstacking green_block_2):
   - Putdown green_block_2 on the table.
   - Stack green_block_2 on yellow_block_3 (if it's on grey_block_1) or on grey_block_1 (if yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_2).

Since we'll need to pick up black_block_1 next, and it's already clear after unstacking green_block_2, the most direct approach is to putdown green_block_2 on the table.

5. Options for the fifth action (after putting down green_block_2):
   - Pickup black_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 4).

This is the logical choice.

6. Options for the sixth action (after picking up black_block_1):
   - Putdown black_block_1 on the table.
   - Stack black_block_1 on green_block_2 (since it's clear).
   - Stack black_block_1 on grey_block_1 (if yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_2).
   - Stack black_block_1 on yellow_block_3 (if yellow_block_3 is on grey_block_1).

To satisfy the goal of having black_block_1 clear, the most straightforward approach is to putdown black_block_1 on the table.

7. Options for the seventh action (after putting down black_block_1):
   - Pickup grey_block_1 (if yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_2, to satisfy constraint 1).
   - Unstack yellow_block_3 from grey_block_1 (if yellow_block_3 is on grey_block_1, to prepare for satisfying constraint 1).

To satisfy constraint 1, we need to either hold grey_block_1 or put it on top of yellow_block_3.

8. Options for the eighth action (after picking up grey_block_1 or unstacking yellow_block_3):
   - Stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3 (if yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_2 and we picked up grey_block_1).
   - Stack yellow_block_3 on some clear block (if we unstacked yellow_block_3 from grey_block_1).
   - Putdown grey_block_1 on the table (if we picked up grey_block_1).

Given the constraints and the goal, the minimal valid plan is:

1. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2.
2. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2 (or grey_block_1).
3. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1.
4. Putdown green_block_2 on the table.
5. Pickup black_block_1.
6. Putdown black_block_1 on the table.
7. Pickup grey_block_1 (if yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_2).
8. Stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3 (if yellow_block_3 is on yellow_block_2).

Or:

1. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2.
2. Stack yellow_block_3 on grey_block_1.
3. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1.
4. Putdown green_block_2 on the table.
5. Pickup black_block_1.
6. Putdown black_block_1 on the table.
7. Unstack yellow_block_3 from grey_block_1.
8. Stack yellow_block_3 on some clear block (not the table).
9. Pickup grey_block_1.
10. Stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3.

The second approach has 10 steps, which is longer. So, the 8-step plan I provided earlier is optimal.

Alright, let's finalize the plan:

1. Unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2.
2. Stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2.
3. Unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1.
4. Putdown green_block_2 on the table.
5. Pickup black_block_1.
6. Putdown black_block_1 on the table.
7. Pickup grey_block_1.
8. Stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3.

This 8-step plan satisfies all constraints and the goal, and is optimal for this problem.

Actually, I'm going to double check if the plan matches the constraints by stepping through. Let's check again:

1. unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2
2. stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2
3. unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1
4. putdown green_block_2 on the table
5. pickup black_block_1
6. putdown black_block_1 on the table
7. pickup grey_block_1
8. stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3

Let's check the constraints:
1. At some point, either the arm is holding grey_block_1 or grey_block_1 is on top of yellow_block_3. This is satisfied at steps 7 and 8.
2. At every state, yellow_block_3 is not on the table. This is satisfied; yellow_block_3 is never placed on the table. It goes from green_block_2 to yellow_block_2.
3. At some point, black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1. This is satisfied in the initial state; black_block_1 is on the table, not on grey_block_1.
4. If black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1 at some state s, then black_block_1 is not on the table at s or at some later state. In the initial state, black_block_1 is not on top of grey_block_1. At step 5, black_block_1 is not on the table, so this constraint is satisfied.

Let me double check goal satisfaction: The goal is for black_block_1 to be clear. In the final state, black_block_1 is on the table and clear. In fact, it's clear from step 5 onwards. The goal is satisfied.

This 8-step plan satisfies all constraints and the goal, and is optimal.

Alright, given all the reasoning and rechecking, I'm confident that the 8-step plan I've provided is the optimal solution for this problem.

So, the final answer is:

```
unstack yellow_block_3 from green_block_2
stack yellow_block_3 on yellow_block_2
unstack green_block_2 from black_block_1
putdown green_block_2
pickup black_block_1
putdown black_block_1
pickup grey_block_1
stack grey_block_1 on yellow_block_3
```
