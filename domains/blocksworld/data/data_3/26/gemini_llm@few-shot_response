Okay, let's break this down. The goal is to have brown_block_3 clear. Currently, purple_block_1 is on top of it. So, we need to move purple_block_1. The constraints add some interesting twists.

1.  We need a state where purple_block_1 is not clear (i.e., something is on top of it).
2.  Before purple_block_1 is not clear, red_block_2 must not be on the table.
3.  We need a state where either purple_block_1 is on red_block_1 OR brown_block_3 is on brown_block_1.
4.  We need a state where brown_block_3 is not on red_block_2.
5.  If brown_block_3 is not on red_block_2, then at that state or a later state, we must be holding brown_block_1.

Here's a plan that addresses these constraints:

```
```
unstack brown_block_2 brown_block_1
putdown brown_block_2
unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_3
putdown purple_block_1
pickup green_block_1
stack green_block_1 purple_block_1
pickup red_block_2
putdown red_block_2
pickup brown_block_3
stack brown_block_3 red_block_2
unstack green_block_1 purple_block_1
putdown green_block_1
pickup purple_block_1
stack purple_block_1 red_block_1
pickup brown_block_3
putdown brown_block_3
```
