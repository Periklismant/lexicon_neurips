Let me understand the problem. I'm given a blocksworld planning problem with a set of blocks and a robotic arm. I need to create a plan to achieve the goal of making "brown_block_3" clear, subject to some constraints.

Let's first analyze the initial state:
- red_block_1 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- brown_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1
- brown_block_3 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on top of brown_block_3
- red_block_2 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on top of red_block_2
- brown_block_2, purple_block_1, and green_block_1 are clear
- The robotic arm is not holding any block

The goal is: brown_block_3 should be clear.

In the initial state, brown_block_3 is not clear because purple_block_1 is on top of it. So I need to move purple_block_1 off of brown_block_3.

Let's also understand the constraints:
1. At some point, purple_block_1 should not be clear (i.e., something should be stacked on purple_block_1).
2. Before making purple_block_1 not clear, red_block_2 should be moved off the table.
3. At some point, either "purple_block_1 is on top of red_block_1" or "brown_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1" should be true.
4. At some point, "brown_block_3 is not on top of red_block_2" should be true.
5. After "brown_block_3 is not on top of red_block_2" becomes true, at some point, "you are holding brown_block_1" should be true.

Let's think through what needs to happen:

1. The goal is to make brown_block_3 clear, which means removing purple_block_1 from it.
2. Due to constraint 1, at some point, something needs to be stacked on purple_block_1.
3. Due to constraint 2, before stacking something on purple_block_1, red_block_2 must be moved off the table.
4. Due to constraint 3, either purple_block_1 needs to be moved onto red_block_1, or brown_block_3 needs to be moved onto brown_block_1.
5. Due to constraint 4, at some point, brown_block_3 should not be on top of red_block_2. This is already true in the initial state (brown_block_3 is on the table, not on red_block_2).
6. Due to constraint 5, after satisfying constraint 4, I need to pick up brown_block_1. But for this, I need to remove the blocks on top of it (brown_block_2).

Now, let's plan the actions:

Start:
- red_block_1 (table) with brown_block_1 on it, and brown_block_2 on that.
- brown_block_3 (table) with purple_block_1 on it.
- red_block_2 (table) with green_block_1 on it.

Wait, I need to be careful here. Let me think more carefully about the constraints.

Constraint 1: I need to stack something on purple_block_1 at some point. So, after removing purple_block_1 from brown_block_3, I should stack something on it, like green_block_1 or brown_block_2.

Constraint 2: I can't stack something on purple_block_1 until red_block_2 is off the table. So, I need to move red_block_2 first, maybe by stacking it on another block.

Constraint 3: I need to either place purple_block_1 on red_block_1 or brown_block_3 on brown_block_1. Given the other constraints, the second option seems easier.

Constraint 4: brown_block_3 should not be on top of red_block_2 at some point. This is already satisfied in the initial state.

Constraint 5: After satisfying constraint 4, I need to pick up brown_block_1. This means I need to remove brown_block_2 from it.

Let's revise the plan:

1. First, move red_block_2 off the table to satisfy constraint 2. To do this, I'll unstack green_block_1 from red_block_2, then pick up red_block_2 and stack it on green_block_1.
2. Next, to satisfy constraint 3, I'll move brown_block_3. But I need to remove purple_block_1 first. I'll unstack purple_block_1 from brown_block_3, then unstack brown_block_2 from brown_block_1, and stack brown_block_3 on brown_block_1.
3. To satisfy constraint 1, I'll stack brown_block_2 on purple_block_1.
4. Finally, to satisfy constraint 5, I'll need to pick up brown_block_1. But first, I need to remove what's on top of it (now brown_block_3). After that, I can unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1.

Let me check if this plan satisfies all constraints:
1. purple_block_1 is not clear at some point because brown_block_2 is on it. ✓
2. Before stacking on purple_block_1, red_block_2 is moved off the table. ✓
3. brown_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1 at some point. ✓
4. brown_block_3 is not on top of red_block_2 at some point. This is true from the start. ✓
5. After constraint 4 is satisfied, I pick up brown_block_1. ✓

I think this plan should work. Let me write it out:

1. unstack green_block_1 red_block_2 (Pick up green_block_1 from red_block_2)
2. pickup red_block_2 (Pick up red_block_2 from the table)
3. stack red_block_2 green_block_1 (Place red_block_2 on green_block_1)
4. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_3 (Pick up purple_block_1 from brown_block_3)
5. unstack brown_block_2 brown_block_1 (Pick up brown_block_2 from brown_block_1)
6. pickup brown_block_3 (Pick up brown_block_3 from the table)
7. stack brown_block_3 brown_block_1 (Place brown_block_3 on brown_block_1)
8. putdown purple_block_1 (Place purple_block_1 on the table)
9. pickup brown_block_2 (Pick up brown_block_2 from the table)
10. stack brown_block_2 purple_block_1 (Place brown_block_2 on purple_block_1)
11. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1 (Pick up brown_block_3 from brown_block_1)
12. putdown brown_block_3 (Place brown_block_3 on the table, now it's clear)
13. unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1 (Pick up brown_block_1 from red_block_1)

Actually, step 13 might not be necessary to satisfy the goal. Let me reconsider...

The goal is to make brown_block_3 clear. This is achieved by step 12, where brown_block_3 is placed on the table without anything on top of it.

But I should still satisfy constraint 5. After brown_block_3 is not on top of red_block_2 (which is already true from the start), I should pick up brown_block_1 at some point. I can check if I've already statisfied constraint 5 by looking for a state after step 1 where the robot is holding brown_block_1. Let me trace through the plan:

1. unstack green_block_1 red_block_2 (Robot holds green_block_1)
2. pickup red_block_2 (Robot holds red_block_2)
3. stack red_block_2 green_block_1 (Robot holds nothing)
4. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_3 (Robot holds purple_block_1)
5. unstack brown_block_2 brown_block_1 (Robot holds brown_block_2)
...
13. unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1 (Robot holds brown_block_1)

So with step 13, all constraints are satisfied.

Let me check the plan again:

1. unstack green_block_1 red_block_2 (Pick up green_block_1 from red_block_2)
2. pickup red_block_2 (Pick up red_block_2 from the table)
3. stack red_block_2 green_block_1 (Place red_block_2 on green_block_1)
4. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_3 (Pick up purple_block_1 from brown_block_3)
5. unstack brown_block_2 brown_block_1 (Pick up brown_block_2 from brown_block_1)
6. pickup brown_block_3 (Pick up brown_block_3 from the table)
7. stack brown_block_3 brown_block_1 (Place brown_block_3 on brown_block_1)
8. putdown purple_block_1 (Place purple_block_1 on the table)
9. pickup brown_block_2 (Pick up brown_block_2 from the table)
10. stack brown_block_2 purple_block_1 (Place brown_block_2 on purple_block_1)
11. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1 (Pick up brown_block_3 from brown_block_1)
12. putdown brown_block_3 (Place brown_block_3 on the table, now it's clear)
13. unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1 (Pick up brown_block_1 from red_block_1)

Wait, I think there's an issue. After step 5, I'd be trying to pick up brown_block_3, but the robot is already holding brown_block_2. Let me revise:

1. unstack green_block_1 red_block_2 (Pick up green_block_1 from red_block_2)
2. putdown green_block_1 (Place green_block_1 on the table)
3. pickup red_block_2 (Pick up red_block_2 from the table)
4. stack red_block_2 green_block_1 (Place red_block_2 on green_block_1)
5. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_3 (Pick up purple_block_1 from brown_block_3)
6. putdown purple_block_1 (Place purple_block_1 on the table)
7. unstack brown_block_2 brown_block_1 (Pick up brown_block_2 from brown_block_1)
8. stack brown_block_2 purple_block_1 (Place brown_block_2 on purple_block_1)
9. pickup brown_block_3 (Pick up brown_block_3 from the table)
10. stack brown_block_3 brown_block_1 (Place brown_block_3 on brown_block_1)
11. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1 (Pick up brown_block_3 from brown_block_1)
12. putdown brown_block_3 (Place brown_block_3 on the table, now it's clear)
13. unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1 (Pick up brown_block_1 from red_block_1)

Actually, step 13 isn't necessary for the goal. But it's required to satisfy constraint 5. So I'll keep it.

Let me do a final check of the constraints:

1. purple_block_1 is not clear at some point (satisfied after step 8).
2. red_block_2 is moved off the table before purple_block_1 is not clear (satisfied by step 3, before step 8).
3. either purple_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 or brown_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1 at some point (satisfied by step 10).
4. brown_block_3 is not on top of red_block_2 at some point (already satisfied from the start).
5. after constraint 4, I pick up brown_block_1 (satisfied by step 13).

The goal is to make brown_block_3 clear, which is satisfied by step 11 & 12.

Great! The plan seems to be:

1. unstack green_block_1 red_block_2
2. putdown green_block_1
3. pickup red_block_2
4. stack red_block_2 green_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_3
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. unstack brown_block_2 brown_block_1
8. stack brown_block_2 purple_block_1
9. pickup brown_block_3
10. stack brown_block_3 brown_block_1
11. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1
12. putdown brown_block_3
13. unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1

But I wonder if I really need all of these steps. Let me re-analyze:

The goal is to clear brown_block_3.
In the initial state, brown_block_3 has purple_block_1 on it.
To make brown_block_3 clear, I need to remove purple_block_1.

Can I simplify the plan? Let's see...

1. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_3 (Now purple_block_1 is in the robot's hand, and brown_block_3 is clear)
2. putdown purple_block_1 (Now the goal is achieved)

But this doesn't satisfy the constraints. Let me try to find the shortest plan that satisfies the constraints:

Let's consider the constraints again:

1. At some point, purple_block_1 should not be clear.
2. Before making purple_block_1 not clear, red_block_2 should be moved off the table.
3. At some point, either "purple_block_1 is on top of red_block_1" or "brown_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1".
4. At some point, brown_block_3 is not on top of red_block_2. This is already satisfied from the start.
5. After constraint 4 is satisfied (which is already the case), at some point, I should pick up brown_block_1.

An optimized plan might be:

1. unstack green_block_1 red_block_2 (Pick up green_block_1 from red_block_2, constraint 4 is already satisfied)
2. putdown green_block_1 (Place green_block_1 on the table)
3. pickup red_block_2 (Pick up red_block_2 from the table, preparing for constraint 2)
4. stack red_block_2 green_block_1 (Place red_block_2 on green_block_1, satisfying constraint 2)
5. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_3 (Pick up purple_block_1 from brown_block_3, working on the goal)
6. putdown purple_block_1 (Place purple_block_1 on the table)
7. unstack brown_block_2 brown_block_1 (Pick up brown_block_2 from brown_block_1, preparing for constraint 5)
8. stack brown_block_2 purple_block_1 (Place brown_block_2 on purple_block_1, satisfying constraint 1)
9. unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1 (Pick up brown_block_1 from red_block_1, satisfying constraint 5)

But this doesn't satisfy constraint 3. I need to either put purple_block_1 on red_block_1 or put brown_block_3 on brown_block_1.

Let's revise:

1. unstack green_block_1 red_block_2 (Pick up green_block_1 from red_block_2, constraint 4 is already satisfied)
2. putdown green_block_1 (Place green_block_1 on the table)
3. pickup red_block_2 (Pick up red_block_2 from the table, preparing for constraint 2)
4. stack red_block_2 green_block_1 (Place red_block_2 on green_block_1, satisfying constraint 2)
5. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_3 (Pick up purple_block_1 from brown_block_3, working on the goal)
6. putdown purple_block_1 (Place purple_block_1 on the table)
7. pickup brown_block_3 (Pick up brown_block_3 from the table)
8. unstack brown_block_2 brown_block_1 (Pick up brown_block_2 from brown_block_1, preparing for constraint 3)
9. putdown brown_block_2 (Place brown_block_2 on the table)
10. stack brown_block_3 brown_block_1 (Place brown_block_3 on brown_block_1, satisfying constraint 3)
11. pickup brown_block_2 (Pick up brown_block_2 from the table)
12. stack brown_block_2 purple_block_1 (Place brown_block_2 on purple_block_1, satisfying constraint 1)
13. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1 (Pick up brown_block_3 from brown_block_1)
14. putdown brown_block_3 (Place brown_block_3 on the table, now it's clear)
15. unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1 (Pick up brown_block_1 from red_block_1, satisfying constraint 5)

Wait, this is getting more complex. Let's try a different approach. Do I really need steps 13 and 14? The goal is to make brown_block_3 clear, but by step 10, it's on top of brown_block_1. If it's on top, it's also clear. So, I think I can stop after step 12, assuming the goal is satisfied.

Let's reconsider the entire plan:

1. unstack green_block_1 red_block_2 (Pick up green_block_1 from red_block_2, constraint 4 is already satisfied)
2. putdown green_block_1 (Place green_block_1 on the table)
3. pickup red_block_2 (Pick up red_block_2 from the table, preparing for constraint 2)
4. stack red_block_2 green_block_1 (Place red_block_2 on green_block_1, satisfying constraint 2)
5. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_3 (Pick up purple_block_1 from brown_block_3, brown_block_3 becomes clear and the goal is satisfied)
6. stack purple_block_1 red_block_1 (Place purple_block_1 on red_block_1, satisfying constraint 3)
7. unstack brown_block_2 brown_block_1 (Pick up brown_block_2 from brown_block_1, preparing for constraint 1)
8. stack brown_block_2 purple_block_1 (Place brown_block_2 on purple_block_1, satisfying constraint 1)
9. unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1 (Pick up brown_block_1 from red_block_1, satisfying constraint 5)

In step 5, the goal is satisfied because brown_block_3 becomes clear. All constraints are also satisfied. Let's verify:

1. purple_block_1 is not clear after step 8.
2. red_block_2 is moved off the table in step 3, before purple_block_1 is not clear (which happens in step 8).
3. purple_block_1 is on top of red_block_1 after step 6.
4. brown_block_3 is not on top of red_block_2 from the start.
5. After constraint 4 is satisfied (which is from the start), I pick up brown_block_1 in step 9.

The goal is to make brown_block_3 clear, which is achieved after step 5.

This seems like a reasonable plan, and it's shorter than the previous ones. Let's go with this.

Wait, there's an issue with step 6. After step 5, the robot is holding purple_block_1. For step 6 to be valid, red_block_1 must be clear. But in the initial state, brown_block_1 is on top of red_block_1, and brown_block_2 is on top of brown_block_1. So I can't place purple_block_1 on red_block_1 directly.

Let me rethink the plan:

1. unstack green_block_1 red_block_2 (Pick up green_block_1 from red_block_2)
2. putdown green_block_1 (Place green_block_1 on the table)
3. pickup red_block_2 (Pick up red_block_2 from the table)
4. stack red_block_2 green_block_1 (Place red_block_2 on green_block_1, satisfying constraint 2)
5. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_3 (Pick up purple_block_1 from brown_block_3, brown_block_3 becomes clear and the goal is satisfied)
6. putdown purple_block_1 (Place purple_block_1 on the table)
7. unstack brown_block_2 brown_block_1 (Pick up brown_block_2 from brown_block_1)
8. stack brown_block_2 purple_block_1 (Place brown_block_2 on purple_block_1, satisfying constraint 1)

With step 8, I've satisfied all constraints except 3 and 5. We need to either put purple_block_1 on red_block_1 or put brown_block_3 on brown_block_1, and we also need to pick up brown_block_1.

Let's continue:

9. unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1 (Pick up brown_block_1 from red_block_1, satisfying constraint 5)
10. putdown brown_block_1 (Place brown_block_1 on the table)
11. pickup brown_block_3 (Pick up brown_block_3 from the table)
12. stack brown_block_3 red_block_1 (Place brown_block_3 on red_block_1, not needed for the constraints)

Oh, I made a mistake. We need to either put purple_block_1 on red_block_1 or put brown_block_3 on brown_block_1. In step 9, I'm removing brown_block_1 from red_block_1, but I need to place brown_block_3 on brown_block_1, not the other way.

Let's revise:

1. unstack green_block_1 red_block_2 (Pick up green_block_1 from red_block_2)
2. putdown green_block_1 (Place green_block_1 on the table)
3. pickup red_block_2 (Pick up red_block_2 from the table)
4. stack red_block_2 green_block_1 (Place red_block_2 on green_block_1, satisfying constraint 2)
5. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_3 (Pick up purple_block_1 from brown_block_3, brown_block_3 becomes clear and the goal is satisfied)
6. putdown purple_block_1 (Place purple_block_1 on the table)
7. pickup brown_block_3 (Pick up brown_block_3 from the table)
8. unstack brown_block_2 brown_block_1 (Pick up brown_block_2 from brown_block_1, making brown_block_1 clear)
9. putdown brown_block_2 (Place brown_block_2 on the table)
10. stack brown_block_3 brown_block_1 (Place brown_block_3 on brown_block_1, satisfying constraint 3)
11. pickup brown_block_2 (Pick up brown_block_2 from the table)
12. stack brown_block_2 purple_block_1 (Place brown_block_2 on purple_block_1, satisfying constraint 1)
13. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1 (Pick up brown_block_3 from brown_block_1, not needed for the constraints)
14. putdown brown_block_3 (Place brown_block_3 on the table, ensuring brown_block_3 is clear)
15. unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1 (Pick up brown_block_1 from red_block_1, satisfying constraint 5)

Let me double check the constraints:

1. purple_block_1 is not clear after step 12. ✓
2. red_block_2 is moved off the table in step 3, before purple_block_1 is not clear (which happens in step 12). ✓
3. brown_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1 after step 10. ✓
4. brown_block_3 is not on top of red_block_2 from the start. ✓
5. After constraint 4 is satisfied (which is from the start), I pick up brown_block_1 in step 15. ✓

I think this plan satisfies all the constraints. But the goal is to make brown_block_3 clear, which is already achieved by step 5. So the later steps, especially 13 and 14, might be unnecessary from the perspective of the goal.

Let's take a step back and reconsider. The goal is achieved in step 5, when I remove purple_block_1 from brown_block_3. All the remaining steps are just to satisfy the constraints. 

I wonder if there's a shorter way to achieve the goal and satisfy the constraints...

Let's refocus on steps 10 to 15. After step 10, brown_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1. To satisfy the constraint that I need to pick up brown_block_1, I first need to remove brown_block_3 from it. That's why steps 13 and 14 are necessary.

But if brown_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1, it's no longer clear. So to ensure the goal is met, I do need to move brown_block_3 again.

Alright, given the constraints, I think my plan is near optimal. Let's restate it:

1. unstack green_block_1 red_block_2 (Pick up green_block_1 from red_block_2)
2. putdown green_block_1 (Place green_block_1 on the table)
3. pickup red_block_2 (Pick up red_block_2 from the table)
4. stack red_block_2 green_block_1 (Place red_block_2 on green_block_1, satisfying constraint 2)
5. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_3 (Pick up purple_block_1 from brown_block_3, brown_block_3 becomes clear and the goal is satisfied)
6. putdown purple_block_1 (Place purple_block_1 on the table)
7. pickup brown_block_3 (Pick up brown_block_3 from the table)
8. unstack brown_block_2 brown_block_1 (Pick up brown_block_2 from brown_block_1, making brown_block_1 clear)
9. putdown brown_block_2 (Place brown_block_2 on the table)
10. stack brown_block_3 brown_block_1 (Place brown_block_3 on brown_block_1, satisfying constraint 3)
11. pickup brown_block_2 (Pick up brown_block_2 from the table)
12. stack brown_block_2 purple_block_1 (Place brown_block_2 on purple_block_1, satisfying constraint 1)
13. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1 (Pick up brown_block_3 from brown_block_1)
14. putdown brown_block_3 (Place brown_block_3 on the table, ensuring brown_block_3 is clear)
15. unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1 (Pick up brown_block_1 from red_block_1, satisfying constraint 5)

But wait, I'm noticing a potential issue:
The goal is to make brown_block_3 clear. By step 5, brown_block_3 is clear. But in step 7, I pick it up, and in step 10, I place it on brown_block_1, where it's no longer on the table.

Hmm, but the constraint is that brown_block_3 should be clear, not necessarily on the table. In step 10, brown_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1, which means it's still clear (nothing is on top of it).

So the goal is actually satisfied throughout steps 5 to 13. But in step 13, I pick up brown_block_3, and in step 14, I put it back on the table. This seems unnessary, as I've already achieved the goal by step 5, and I'm satisfying all the constraints by step 15 (or potentially earlier).

Actually, on second thought, the goal is "there is no block on top of brown_block_3, i.e., brown_block_3 is clear". This doesn't necessarily mean brown_block_3 needs to be on the table. As long as no block is on top of it, it's considered clear. Step 5 ensures this condition, and it remains true throughout the rest of the plan. So the goal is satisfed after step 5.

Let's review one more time:

1. unstack green_block_1 red_block_2 (Pick up green_block_1 from red_block_2)
2. putdown green_block_1 (Place green_block_1 on the table)
3. pickup red_block_2 (Pick up red_block_2 from the table)
4. stack red_block_2 green_block_1 (Place red_block_2 on green_block_1, satisfying constraint 2)
5. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_3 (Pick up purple_block_1 from brown_block_3, brown_block_3 becomes clear and the goal is satisfied)
6. putdown purple_block_1 (Place purple_block_1 on the table)
7. pickup brown_block_3 (Pick up brown_block_3 from the table, but it's no longer clear when picked up)
8. unstack brown_block_2 brown_block_1 (Pick up brown_block_2 from brown_block_1, making brown_block_1 clear)
9. putdown brown_block_2 (Place brown_block_2 on the table)
10. stack brown_block_3 brown_block_1 (Place brown_block_3 on brown_block_1, satisfying constraint 3, and brown_block_3
is clear again)
11. pickup brown_block_2 (Pick up brown_block_2 from the table)
12. stack brown_block_2 purple_block_1 (Place brown_block_2 on purple_block_1, satisfying constraint 1)
13. unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1 (Pick up brown_block_1 from red_block_1, satisfying constraint 5)

Woah, wait a second. In step 13, I'm trying to unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1, but brown_block_3 is stacked on top of brown_block_1 in step 10. So I can't simply unstack brown_block_1 from red_block_1. Let me correct the plan:

1. unstack green_block_1 red_block_2 (Pick up green_block_1 from red_block_2)
2. putdown green_block_1 (Place green_block_1 on the table)
3. pickup red_block_2 (Pick up red_block_2 from the table)
4. stack red_block_2 green_block_1 (Place red_block_2 on green_block_1, satisfying constraint 2)
5. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_3 (Pick up purple_block_1 from brown_block_3, brown_block_3 becomes clear and the goal is satisfied)
6. putdown purple_block_1 (Place purple_block_1 on the table)
7. pickup brown_block_3 (Pick up brown_block_3 from the table, but it's no longer clear when picked up)
8. unstack brown_block_2 brown_block_1 (Pick up brown_block_2 from brown_block_1, making brown_block_1 clear)
9. putdown brown_block_2 (Place brown_block_2 on the table)
10. stack brown_block_3 brown_block_1 (Place brown_block_3 on brown_block_1, satisfying constraint 3, and brown_block_3 is clear again)
11. pickup brown_block_2 (Pick up brown_block_2 from the table)
12. stack brown_block_2 purple_block_1 (Place brown_block_2 on purple_block_1, satisfying constraint 1)
13. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1 (Pick up brown_block_3 from brown_block_1)
14. putdown brown_block_3 (Place brown_block_3 on the table, ensuring brown_block_3 is clear)
15. unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1 (Pick up brown_block_1 from red_block_1, satisfying constraint 5)

This looks right. Now, brown_block_3 is clear after step 5, and all constraints are satisfied by step 15.

But I'm wondering if we need steps 13 and 14? Let's think about this: after step 12, I have red_block_1 on the table with brown_block_1 on top, and brown_block_3 on top of brown_block_1. I also have purple_block_1 on the table with brown_block_2 on top. brown_block_3 is clear (the goal is satisfied). However, I still need to satisfy constraint 5 (pick up brown_block_1 after brown_block_3 is not on top of red_block_2). To do that, I need to first remove brown_block_3 from brown_block_1, which is steps 13 and 14.

So, I think all 15 steps are necessary, given the constraints. Here's the final plan:

1. unstack green_block_1 red_block_2
2. putdown green_block_1
3. pickup red_block_2
4. stack red_block_2 green_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_1 brown_block_3
6. putdown purple_block_1
7. pickup brown_block_3
8. unstack brown_block_2 brown_block_1
9. putdown brown_block_2
10. stack brown_block_3 brown_block_1
11. pickup brown_block_2
12. stack brown_block_2 purple_block_1
13. unstack brown_block_3 brown_block_1
14. putdown brown_block_3
15. unstack brown_block_1 red_block_1

I'm pretty confident that this is the optimal plan.
