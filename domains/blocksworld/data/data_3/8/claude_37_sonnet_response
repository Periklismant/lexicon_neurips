Alright, let's understand the problem:

1. We have a blocksworld domain where blocks can be stacked on top of each other or placed on the table.
2. The robotic arm can hold at most one block at a time.
3. The available actions are pickup, putdown, stack, and unstack.
4. Each action has preconditions and effects.
5. The initial state is given with the positions of the blocks.
6. The goal is to have red_block_1 on top of purple_block_3.
7. There are constraints that must be met by the plan.

Let me break down the initial state:
- green_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_1 on top of it, and purple_block_2 on top of purple_block_1.
- white_block_1 is on the table with blue_block_1 on top of it.
- red_block_1 is on the table with purple_block_3 on top of it.
- blue_block_1, purple_block_2, and purple_block_3 are clear (no blocks on top).
- The robotic arm is not holding any block.

Constraints that must be met:
1. At some point, the robotic arm must hold blue_block_1.
2. At some point, either green_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2 or the robotic arm is holding white_block_1.
3. At some point, red_block_1's position is on the table.
4. If red_block_1 is on the table, then eventually, purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 must be on the table.

Let's think about this, and also notice that all blocks are already named uniquely, so I will just refer to them by their full names:

Current State:
1. purple_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1 which is on top of green_block_1 which is on the table.
2. blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1 which is on the table.
3. purple_block_3 is on top of red_block_1 which is on the table.

Goal State:
1. red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_3.

Constraints:
1. At some point, hold blue_block_1.
2. At some point, either green_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2 or hold white_block_1.
3. At some point, red_block_1 is on the table (which is already true in the initial state).
4. If red_block_1 is on the table, then eventually, purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 must be on the table.

Let's approach this step by step:

Initial State:
- green_block_1 [on table]
  - purple_block_1
    - purple_block_2 [clear]
- white_block_1 [on table]
  - blue_block_1 [clear]
- red_block_1 [on table]
  - purple_block_3 [clear]
- The robotic arm is not holding any block.

Goal:
- red_block_1 on top of purple_block_3.

Constraint 3 is already met in the initial state: red_block_1 is on the table.

To satisfy constraint 4, we need to eventually have purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 on the table.

For constraint 1, we need to hold blue_block_1 at some point.

For constraint 2, we need to either:
a. Have green_block_1 on top of purple_block_2
b. Hold white_block_1

To achieve the goal, we need to move red_block_1 on top of purple_block_3. But currently, purple_block_3 is on top of red_block_1. We need to rearrange this.

Let's plan the steps:

1. First, let's unstack purple_block_3 from red_block_1 and put it somewhere (on the table for now):
   - unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
   - putdown purple_block_3

2. Now, to satisfy constraint 1, we need to hold blue_block_1:
   - unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
   
3. Let's put blue_block_1 on the table:
   - putdown blue_block_1

4. For constraint 2, we can choose to hold white_block_1:
   - pickup white_block_1
   - putdown white_block_1

5. To achieve the goal, we need to pick up red_block_1 and place it on top of purple_block_3:
   - pickup red_block_1
   - stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

After this, the constraint 4 isn't satisfied yet because purple_block_1 and purple_block_2 are still not on the table. Let's satisfy this:

6. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
7. putdown purple_block_2

Now, constraint 4 is satisfied because purple_block_2 is on the table.

Wait, let me check if red_block_1 is already on the table in our plan when we need to satisfy constraint 4. It's already on the table in the initial state, and then we'll pick it up later.

Ah, there's a potential issue with constraint 4. It says "If red_block_1 is on the table, then eventually, purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 must be on the table." Since red_block_1 is on the table in the initial state, we need to ensure that purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 is on the table at some point.

Given that red_block_1 starts on the table and later we'll place it on top of purple_block_3, let's ensure that purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 is on the table after we've moved red_block_1 off the table.

The issue is that red_block_1 starts on the table and then we pick it up, so we need to ensure purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 is on the table after this point.

Let me reconsider the steps:

1. First, to satisfy constraint 1, hold blue_block_1:
   - unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
   - putdown blue_block_1

2. For constraint 2, hold white_block_1:
   - pickup white_block_1
   - putdown white_block_1

3. Rearrange purple_block_3 and red_block_1:
   - unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1

4. Satisfying constraint 4, ensure either purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 is on the table:
   - putdown purple_block_3
   - unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
   - putdown purple_block_2

5. Achieve the goal:
   - pickup red_block_1
   - stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

This plan should satisfy all the constraints, albeit not in the most efficient manner. Let's review one more time to ensure it's valid:

- Constraint 1: Hold blue_block_1 at some point. We do this.
- Constraint 2: Either green_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2 or hold white_block_1. We choose the second option.
- Constraint 3: At some point, red_block_1 is on the table. This is already true in the initial state.
- Constraint 4: If red_block_1 is on the table, then eventually, purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 must be on the table. We ensure purple_block_2 is on the table.

Actually, I now realize that constraint 4 might be a bit more subtle than I initially interpreted. It states:

"If expression 'red_block_1 is on the table' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: 'purple_block_1 is on the table', 'purple_block_2 is on the table'' must hold at s or at some state after s."

This means that from any state where red_block_1 is on the table, there must be a future state (inclusive) where either purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 is on the table.

In the initial state, red_block_1 is on the table, so we need to ensure that in the initial state or a future state, purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 is on the table. However, in the initial state, neither purple_block_1 nor purple_block_2 is on the table. So, we need to make this happen in a future state.

Let's double check the starting positions: 
In the initial state: purple_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1, which is on top of green_block_1, which is on the table. So neither purple_block_1 nor purple_block_2 is on the table initially. That confirms the need to make this happen later in the plan.

However, if red_block_1 is put on top of purple_block_3 and not on the table anymore, the constraint doesn't apply. So maybe I don't have to move purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 to the table. Let's double check.

Constraint 4 says: "If red_block_1 is on the table, then eventually, purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 must be on the table."

In the initial state, red_block_1 is on the table, so the constraint applies. This means that at some point after the initial state, purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 should be on the table.

Let's reconsider the plan:

1. First, to satisfy constraint 1, hold blue_block_1:
   - unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
   - putdown blue_block_1

2. For constraint 2, we can choose to either: a) place green_block_1 on top of purple_block_2 or b) hold white_block_1. Let's explore option a:
   - unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
   - putdown purple_block_2
   - unstack purple_block_1 green_block_1
   - putdown purple_block_1
   - pickup green_block_1
   - stack green_block_1 purple_block_2

Hmm, this is getting quite involved. Let's explore option b instead:
   - pickup white_block_1
   - putdown white_block_1

3. To satisfy constraint 4, we need to move purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 to the table. Since red_block_1 is already on the table, we should satisfy this constraint:
   - unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
   - putdown purple_block_2

4. Rearrange purple_block_3 and red_block_1:
   - unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1

5. Achieve the goal:
   - pickup red_block_1
   - stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

This plan may not be optimal, but it should satisfy all the constraints.

Let's review again:
- Constraint 1: Hold blue_block_1 at some point. Done.
- Constraint 2: Either green_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2 or hold white_block_1. We choose to hold white_block_1, although we could explore the other option as well.
- Constraint 3: At some point, red_block_1 is on the table. This is already true in the initial state.
- Constraint 4: If red_block_1 is on the table, then eventually, purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 must be on the table. We ensure purple_block_2 is on the table.

This plan should satisfy all the constraints and achieve the goal.

Mmmm, let me try to optimize the plan because I think there are some steps I can optimize. It feels ineffiecient to have to rearrange blocks only to place them on the table again. Let's think of an optimal plan:

1. First, to satisfy constraint 1, hold blue_block_1:
   - unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1

   For constraint 2, we can choose to either: a) place green_block_1 on top of purple_block_2 or b) hold white_block_1. To place green_block_1 on top of purple_block_2, we would need to unstack both purple_block_2 and purple_block_1, which would also help with constraint 4. 
   
   Let's try this approach:
   - putdown blue_block_1
   - unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
   - putdown purple_block_2  (This helps satisfy constraint 4 since purple_block_2 is now on the table)
   - unstack purple_block_1 green_block_1
   - putdown purple_block_1
   - pickup green_block_1
   - stack green_block_1 purple_block_2

   Now, both constraints 2 and 4 are satisfied.

2. For achieving the goal:
   - unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
   - putdown purple_block_3
   - pickup red_block_1
   - stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

In total, this would be 10 steps.

Now, let's try the alternative for constraint 2:
1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1 (Satisfies constraint 1)
2. putdown blue_block_1
3. pickup white_block_1 (Satisfies constraint 2)
4. putdown white_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
6. putdown purple_block_2 (Satisfies constraint 4)
7. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
8. putdown purple_block_3
9. pickup red_block_1
10. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3 (Achieves the goal)

This would also be 10 steps. Let's continue evaluating the plans.

Wait, I've made a misunderstanding. I thought that to satisfy constraint 4, we'd always have to have purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 on the table. But upon re-reading, it only requires that if red_block_1 is on the table, then eventually purple_block_1 or purple_block_2.

In our goal state, we want red_block_1 to be on top of purple_block_3, so it's not on the table. This means once we've achieved the goal, the antecedent of constraint 4 is no longer true, so we don't have to satisfy its consequence.

So, if in the initial state, red_block_1 is on the table (which it is), then at some point we should have purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 on the table. But if we manage to stack red_block_1 on top of purple_block_3 and keep it that way, we don't have to worry about constraint 4 anymore.

Actually, rereading the constraint again:
"If expression 'red_block_1 is on the table' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: 'purple_block_1 is on the table', 'purple_block_2 is on the table'' must hold at s or at some state after s."

It says "...at s or at some state after s." So, if red_block_1 is on the table in state s (like in the initial state), then at some future state t, either purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 must be on the table. It doesn't matter if red_block_1 is still on the table at state t, just that we've guaranteed the consequence for any state s where the antecedent holds.

Let's keep this in mind and try to optimize our plan again:

In the initial state, red_block_1 is on the table, so at some future state, we must have purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 on the table (due to constraint 4). Let's satisfy this. But I can also use these block movements to integrate satisfying the other constraints:

1. First, to satisfy constraint 1, hold blue_block_1:
   - unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
   - putdown blue_block_1

2. To satisfy constraint 2 and 4, we'll choose to unstack purple_block_2 and put it on the table:
   - unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
   - putdown purple_block_2

   Now, constraint 4 is satisfied (purple_block_2 is on the table), and we can also choose to move green_block_1 on top of purple_block_2 for constraint 2:
   - unstack purple_block_1 green_block_1
   - putdown purple_block_1
   - pickup green_block_1
   - stack green_block_1 purple_block_2 (Satisfies constraint 2)

3. Achieve the goal:
   - unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
   - putdown purple_block_3
   - pickup red_block_1
   - stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

This is a 10 step plan.

If we go with the alternative for constraint 2 (holding white_block_1):
1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1 (Satisfies constraint 1)
2. putdown blue_block_1
3. pickup white_block_1 (Satisfies constraint 2)
4. putdown white_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
6. putdown purple_block_2 (Satisfies constraint 4)
7. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
8. putdown purple_block_3
9. pickup red_block_1
10. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3 (Achieves the goal)

Both approaches seem to be 10 steps. Let's try to minimize this further.

I realize we need the action of putting purple_block_2 on the table to satisfy constraint 4. So, is there a way to satisfy constraint 2 more efficiently?

For constraint 2: At some point, either green_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2 or hold white_block_1.

Let's evaluate the two options from the initial state:

Option a) Place green_block_1 on top of purple_block_2:
1. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
2. putdown purple_block_2
3. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_1
4. putdown purple_block_1
5. pickup green_block_1
6. stack green_block_1 purple_block_2

Option b) Hold white_block_1:
1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
2. putdown blue_block_1
3. pickup white_block_1
4. putdown white_block_1

Option b seems to be fewer steps. And for constraint 1, we'd need to hold blue_block_1 at some point, so it's also more aligned with the action of unstacking blue_block_1 from white_block_1.

I can continue from step 4 of Option b to satisfy constraint 4 and achieve the goal:
5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
6. putdown purple_block_2 (Satisfies constraint 4)
7. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
8. putdown purple_block_3
9. pickup red_block_1
10. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3 (Achieves the goal)

In total, this would be 10 steps.

Actually, there's another way we could do things. If we held white_block_1 directly, put it on the table, and then move blocks to achieve the goal, we could reduce the number of steps. Let's see:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
2. putdown blue_block_1 (Satisfies constraint 1)
3. pickup white_block_1
4. putdown white_block_1 (Satisfies constraint 2)
5. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1 (Satisfies constraint 3, red_block_1 was on the table originally)
6. putdown purple_block_3
7. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
8. putdown purple_block_2 (Satisfies constraint 4, purple_block_2 on the table)
9. pickup red_block_1
10. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3 (Achieves the goal)

This seems to be the most straightforward way, 10 steps in total.

Let me try one more approach to satisfy constraint 4 and see if we can do it in fewer actions: For constraint 4, we need purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 on the table after red_block_1 is on the table.

So, at some point after the initial state, we need to put purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 on the table.

Would this work?
1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1 (Satisfies constraint 1)
2. putdown blue_block_1
3. pickup white_block_1 (Satisfies constraint 2)
4. putdown white_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
6. pickup red_block_1
7. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3 (Achieves the goal)

We added steps 8-10 to satisfy constraint 4:
8. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
9. putdown purple_block_2
10. putdown purple_block_3 (we've already unstacked purple_block_3 from red_block_1 to achieve the goal)

Hmm, but there is an issue because step 10 conflicts with step 7, which places red_block_1 on top of purple_block_3. So, I would need to rearrange the steps a bit.

Let's redo the plan considering constraint 4 is satisfied right after constraint 3:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1 (Satisfies constraint 1)
2. putdown blue_block_1
3. pickup white_block_1 (Satisfies constraint 2)
4. putdown white_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
6. putdown purple_block_2 (Satisfies constraint 4)
7. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
8. putdown purple_block_3
9. pickup red_block_1
10. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3 (Achieves the goal)

So I still end up with a 10-step plan.

Let me see if there's any redundancy in the plan I can trim:

Actually, I just realized something, steps 2 and 3 are not required to satisfy constraint 2. The constraint asks for "hold white_block_1" at some state, not "hold white_block_1 and put it somewhere." So, I can just skip the action of putting white_block_1 on the table after holding it and instead unstack purple_block_2 while still holding white_block_1.

Actually, hold on, for the blocksworld domain, typically the robot can only hold one block at a time. So, if I'm holding white_block_1, I can't also unstack purple_block_2 until I put down white_block_1. So, the original plan is still valid.

Let's double check: In the domain description, it says "You are a robotic arm that can hold at most one block at a time." So I can't hold more than one block.

Ok, let me think again. Maybe there's still a more optimal strategy. Let me analyze the constraints with a fresh perspective.

Constraints:
1. At some point, hold blue_block_1.
2. At some point, either green_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2 or hold white_block_1.
3. At some point, red_block_1 is on the table (which is already true in the initial state).
4. If red_block_1 is on the table, then eventually, purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 must be on the table.

For constraint 4, since red_block_1 is already on the table in the initial state, we need to eventually have either purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 on the table.

Let's analyze the most efficient way to satisfy all these constraints and achieve the goal.

For constraint 1, we need to hold blue_block_1, which is currently on top of white_block_1.
For constraint 2, we can either hold white_block_1 or place green_block_1 on top of purple_block_2. Holding white_block_1 seems more efficient since it requires fewer steps and aligns with unstacking blue_block_1.
For constraint 4, we need to eventually have either purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 on the table.
For the goal, we need to place red_block_1 on top of purple_block_3, but purple_block_3 is currently on top of red_block_1.

It seems like the most efficient approach would be to:
1. Satisfy constraint 1 by holding blue_block_1.
2. Satisfy constraint 2 by holding white_block_1.
3. Satisfy constraint 4 by placing purple_block_2 or purple_block_1 on the table.
4. Achieve the goal by placing red_block_1 on top of purple_block_3.

Integrating these, I'll try to find the most optimal plan:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1 (Satisfies constraint 1)
2. putdown blue_block_1 (Need to free the arm to satisfy constraint 2)
3. pickup white_block_1 (Satisfies constraint 2)
4. putdown white_block_1 (Need to free the arm for the next steps)
5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
6. putdown purple_block_2 (Satisfies constraint 4, since purple_block_2 is now on the table)
7. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
8. putdown purple_block_3
9. pickup red_block_1
10. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3 (Achieves the goal)

This is a 10-step plan, which seems to be the most optimal given the constraints and goal. Let's review it one more time:

- Constraint 1: Hold blue_block_1 at some point. Done in step 1.
- Constraint 2: Either green_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2 or hold white_block_1. Done in step 3.
- Constraint 3: At some point, red_block_1 is on the table. This is already true in the initial state.
- Constraint 4: If red_block_1 is on the table, then eventually, purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 must be on the table. Done in step 6.

And we achieve the goal (red_block_1 on top of purple_block_3) in step 10.

Let's check if we can optimize further:

For constraint 2, another option is to place green_block_1 on top of purple_block_2. But this would require more steps:
1. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
2. putdown purple_block_2
3. unstack purple_block_1 green_block_1
4. putdown purple_block_1
5. pickup green_block_1
6. stack green_block_1 purple_block_2

So, this is not more efficient than just holding white_block_1.

For constraint 4, we currently satisfy it by putting purple_block_2 on the table. We could alternatively put purple_block_1 on the table, but that would also require more steps since it's beneath purple_block_2.

So, I believe that a 10-step plan is the most optimal for this problem:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1 (Satisfies constraint 1)
2. putdown blue_block_1
3. pickup white_block_1 (Satisfies constraint 2)
4. putdown white_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
6. putdown purple_block_2 (Satisfies constraint 4)
7. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
8. putdown purple_block_3
9. pickup red_block_1
10. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3 (Achieves the goal)

Wait, let me actually analyze the problem again and check if there's something I missed. I'm going to double check that I correctly understand all of the constraints and the goal:

Goal: red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_3

Constraints:
1. At some point, hold blue_block_1.
2. At some point, either green_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2 or hold white_block_1.
3. At some point, red_block_1 is on the table (which is already true in the initial state).
4. If red_block_1 is on the table, then eventually, purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 must be on the table.

For constraint 4, I'm pretty sure my original reading is not quite right. I think red_block_1 has to be on the table while purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 is on the table. The constraint says:

"If expression 'red_block_1 is on the table' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: 'purple_block_1 is on the table', 'purple_block_2 is on the table'' must hold at s or at some state after s."

If red_block_1 is on the table in state s, then at state s or in some later state, purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 must be on the table. So, the constraint is satisfied if, at the time red_block_1 is on the table, or at a later state, purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 is on the table. This doesn't necessarily mean that red_block_1 has to be on the table at the same time as purple_block_1 or purple_block_2, just that if red_block_1 is on the table at state s, then at some state t (where t >= s), purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 is on the table.

Initial State: red_block_1 is on the table, and so constraint 4 applies from the very beginning. I need to ensure that at some point (at the initial state or later), purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 is on the table. And based on the initial block configuration, neither purple_block_1 nor purple_block_2 is on the table to start with. So, I need to ensure that in some state after the initial state, purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 is on the table.

As a final sanity check on the plan, I think my 10-step plan correctly address all the constrains and reaches the goal. One more time, here's the plan:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1 (Satisfies constraint 1)
2. putdown blue_block_1
3. pickup white_block_1 (Satisfies constraint 2)
4. putdown white_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
6. putdown purple_block_2 (Satisfies constraint 4)
7. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
8. putdown purple_block_3
9. pickup red_block_1
10. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3 (Achieves the goal)

I'll now re-review the logic of these steps again. After unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1, I put it down to free the arm. Then I pickup white_block_1 to satisfy constraint 2. Once done, I put it down. Then I unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1 and put it on the table to satisfy constraint 4. Finally, I manipulate purple_block_3 and red_block_1 to achieve the goal.

If I think of it, for constrains 1 and 2, holding the block is enough. I don't actually need to place it on the table. However, I would still need to free the arm for future operations, so I would end up with the same steps.

I believe this 10-step plan is the optimal solution to the problem, taking into account the constraints and the goal.

Actually, I just realized another way to possibly optimize. I don't think I need to do steps 2 and 3 in my plan. Let me see.

Constraint 1 asks for "hold blue_block_1" at some point. I can satisfy this in step 1 by unstacking blue_block_1 from white_block_1.

Constraint 2 asks for either "green_block_1 is on top of purple_block_2" or "hold white_block_1" at some point. If I can directly pick up white_block_1 without putting down blue_block_1 first, I could save steps. But for blockworld actions, I need to free the arm first (i.e. put down blue_block_1) before I can pickup white_block_1. So I still need steps 2 and 3.

I think my 10-step plan is the most optimal:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1 (Satisfies constraint 1)
2. putdown blue_block_1
3. pickup white_block_1 (Satisfies constraint 2)
4. putdown white_block_1
5. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
6. putdown purple_block_2 (Satisfies constraint 4)
7. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
8. putdown purple_block_3
9. pickup red_block_1
10. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3 (Achieves the goal)

This is the final plan, and I'm confident it's optimal.

```
unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
pickup white_block_1
putdown white_block_1
unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
putdown purple_block_2
unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
putdown purple_block_3
pickup red_block_1
stack red_block_1 purple_block_3
```
