Okay, let's try to figure out this Blocksworld problem. So, the initial state is a bit complex. Let me list out all the blocks and their positions first. 

We have green_block_1 on the table, and purple_block_1 is on top of it. Then purple_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1. So the stack here is green_block_1 -> purple_block_1 -> purple_block_2. Purple_block_2 is clear. 

White_block_1 is on the table with blue_block_1 on top, and blue_block_1 is clear. Red_block_1 is on the table, and purple_block_3 is on top of it. Purple_block_3 is clear. The robot isn't holding anything initially.

The goal is to have red_block_1 on top of purple_block_3. Wait, but in the initial state, purple_block_3 is already on top of red_block_1. So the goal is to reverse that? So currently, red_block_1 is under purple_block_3. The goal is to have red_block_1 on top of purple_block_3. That means we need to move red_block_1 from the table to be on top of purple_block_3. But wait, purple_block_3 is on red_block_1. So first, we need to remove purple_block_3 from red_block_1, put it somewhere, then place red_block_1 on top of purple_block_3.

But the constraints complicate things. Let's go through them one by one.

Constraints:

1. Must hold blue_block_1 at some state. So the plan must include picking up blue_block_1 at some point.

2. At least one of "green_block_1 on purple_block_2" or holding white_block_1 must be true in some state.

3. red_block_1 is on the table in some state. But initially, red_block_1 is on the table, right? Wait, initial state says red_block_1 is on the table, and purple_block_3 is on top of it. So red_block_1 is on the table, with purple_block_3 on it. So the condition "red_block_1 is on the table" is already true in the initial state. But the constraint says it must hold in at least one state. Since the initial state satisfies that, maybe this constraint is automatically met. But we need to make sure that if in some state red_block_1 is on the table, then either purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 is on the table at that state or later. But since the initial state has red_block_1 on the table, the implication is that in that state, either purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 is on the table. Let's check: purple_block_1 is on green_block_1, which is on the table. So purple_block_1 is not on the table. Purple_block_2 is on purple_block_1. So neither is on the table. Wait, that's a problem. So the initial state has red_block_1 on the table, but neither purple_block_1 nor purple_block_2 is on the table. So the constraint is that if red_block_1 is on the table in any state, then in that state or a subsequent one, either purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 is on the table. Since the initial state has red_block_1 on the table, but neither purple_block is on the table, this constraint is violated unless in some subsequent state after the initial state, when red_block_1 is on the table again, we have purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 on the table. Wait, but the initial state is the starting point, and the constraint is for any state where red_block_1 is on the table. So in the initial state, red_block_1 is on the table, but the required condition (purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 on table) isn't met. Therefore, the initial state violates the constraint. But the problem states that the constraints must be satisfied by the plan. So the initial state must already satisfy all constraints, but maybe not. Wait, the constraints are for the plan's states. The problem says the plan must abide by the constraints. So during the execution of the plan (the sequence of actions), any state where red_block_1 is on the table must have either purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 on the table at that state or a later one. But the initial state is part of the plan's execution. So the initial state is a state where red_block_1 is on the table, but purple_block_1 is not on the table (it's on green_block_1) and purple_block_2 is on purple_block_1. So in the initial state, neither is on the table, which violates the constraint. Therefore, the initial state is invalid? Wait, no. The problem says the plan must satisfy all constraints. The initial state is given, but the plan's execution includes the initial state. Therefore, the initial state must not violate the constraints. But according to the constraint, if red_block_1 is on the table in a state (like the initial state), then either purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 must be on the table in that state or later. But in the initial state, purple_block_1 is not on the table. So the constraint is violated in the initial state. Therefore, the plan must ensure that whenever red_block_1 is on the table (including the initial state), the implication holds. But the initial state is given, so perhaps the problem's initial state already violates the constraints? That can't be. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the constraint.

Wait, the constraint is: If in some state s, red_block_1 is on the table, then either purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 is on the table in s or some state after s. So in the initial state s0, red_block_1 is on the table, so we need to check whether in s0 or any subsequent state, purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 is on the table. In the initial state, purple_block_1 is not on the table (it's on green_block_1). So, to satisfy the constraint, there must be some state after s0 where either purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 is on the table. So during the plan's execution, if red_block_1 is ever on the table (including the initial state), then we need to have purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 on the table in that state or a future state. Since the initial state has red_block_1 on the table, but the required condition isn't met, we need to make sure that in some future state after s0, either purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 is on the table. But during the plan, perhaps when red_block_1 is moved, but then maybe it's put back on the table again. Hmm. So the plan must ensure that whenever red_block_1 is on the table in any state, then either in that state or a later one, purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 is on the table. So even if red_block_1 is moved off the table and then put back, the constraint applies again.

But let's see. The initial state has red_block_1 on the table. So we need to make sure that in the initial state, either purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 is on the table (they aren't), or in some state after s0, those blocks are on the table. So during the plan, after the initial state, at some point, either purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 must be on the table. So even if red_block_1 is moved off the table in the first action, the initial state still exists, so we need to satisfy the constraint. Therefore, in the plan, we must have at least one state after the initial where purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 is on the table. But how?

Let me think about the plan steps.

The goal is to have red_block_1 on top of purple_block_3. Currently, purple_block_3 is on red_block_1, so we need to unstack purple_block_3 from red_block_1, put it down, then pick up red_block_1 and stack it on purple_block_3.

But let's outline the steps:

1. Unstack purple_block_3 from red_block_1. To do this, since purple_block_3 is clear (initial state), the robotic arm can unstack it. After unstacking, purple_block_3 is held, and red_block_1 is clear.

2. Putdown purple_block_3 on the table. Now, purple_block_3 is on the table, clear.

3. Pickup red_block_1. Since it's on the table and clear (after step 1), possible.

4. Stack red_block_1 on purple_block_3. Now, red_block_1 is on purple_block_3, satisfying the goal.

But this seems straightforward. Let's check the constraints.

First constraint: Must hold blue_block_1 at some state. The above steps don't involve blue_block_1. So we need to include an action where the arm picks up blue_block_1. Let's see where blue_block_1 is: it's on white_block_1, and clear. So to pick it up, we can do unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1. But the action is 'pickup' if it's on the table. Wait, blue_block_1 is on white_block_1, which is on the table. So blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, so to pick it up, we need to unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1. Because 'pickup' is only for blocks on the table. So the action would be 'unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1', which requires that blue_block_1 is on white_block_1, which it is, and that blue_block_1 is clear (which it is), and the arm isn't holding anything. Then after unstacking, the arm is holding blue_block_1. Then, we can put it back down, perhaps. But we need to hold blue_block_1 at least once. So inserting this action somewhere in the plan. But when?

But inserting this would add steps. Let's see. Let's see if we can satisfy all constraints.

Constraints:

1. Hold blue_block_1: So we need to unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1. Then perhaps put it back.

But the plan's goal is to move red_block_1 onto purple_block_3. So perhaps during the plan, after moving purple_block_3, we can handle blue_block_1.

But let's outline the steps again, incorporating the constraint:

1. Unstack purple_block_3 from red_block_1. Now holding purple_block_3. Red_block_1 is clear.

2. Putdown purple_block_3. Now purple_block_3 is on the table.

3. Now, to pick up red_block_1, which is on the table and clear. So pickup red_block_1.

Wait, but the initial state after unstacking purple_block_3, red_block_1 is clear and on the table. So step 3 would be 'pickup red_block_1' (since it's on the table and clear). Then stack red_block_1 on purple_block_3. So steps 1-4 would be:

1. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1

2. putdown purple_block_3

3. pickup red_block_1

4. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

But this plan doesn't involve blue_block_1, so the first constraint isn't met. So we need to add steps where the arm holds blue_block_1. Let's see. Maybe after step 2, we can handle blue_block_1.

But inserting steps to pick up blue_block_1:

After step 2, the arm is empty. So we can do:

3. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1

4. putdown blue_block_1

Then proceed to pick up red_block_1.

But that adds steps. Also, we need to make sure that after unstacking blue_block_1, white_block_1 is clear. Then, putting blue_block_1 down. Then, when we putdown blue_block_1, white_block_1 remains clear.

But then, after these steps, we can proceed to pickup red_block_1.

But this adds steps. Let's check if this meets the first constraint: yes, in step 3, the arm is holding blue_block_1.

Now, the second constraint: in some state, either green_block_1 is on purple_block_2 or the arm is holding white_block_1. Let's see. The original stack is green_block_1 with purple_block_1 and purple_block_2 on top. So green_block_1 is on the table. To have green_block_1 on purple_block_2, we would need to move green_block_1 on top of purple_block_2. But that would require picking up green_block_1, which is under purple_block_1. So first, we need to unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1, then unstack purple_block_1 from green_block_1, then pick up green_block_1 and stack it on purple_block_2. That's a lot of steps, which may not be optimal. Alternatively, the other condition is holding white_block_1. So perhaps during the plan, the arm holds white_block_1. But white_block_1 is under blue_block_1. So to hold white_block_1, the arm would need to first unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1 (which we already do in step 3), put down blue_block_1, then pickup white_block_1. But that would require more steps. So maybe after step 4 (putdown blue_block_1), we can do:

5. pickup white_block_1. But white_block_1 is on the table and clear (since blue_block_1 was unstacked and put down). So yes, pickup white_block_1. Then put it back. But this would satisfy the second constraint (holding white_block_1 at step 5). So the plan would have:

1. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1

2. putdown purple_block_3

3. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1

4. putdown blue_block_1

5. pickup white_block_1

6. putdown white_block_1

7. pickup red_block_1

8. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

But this adds a lot of steps, but maybe it's necessary to meet the constraints. However, this may not be optimal. Let's see if there's a shorter way. For the second constraint: at least one of green_block_1 on purple_block_2 or holding white_block_1 in some state. If we can satisfy the holding white_block_1 part, that would be easier. But to hold white_block_1, we need to have it clear. Since in the initial state, blue_block_1 is on white_block_1. So to clear white_block_1, we need to remove blue_block_1. Which is already done in step 3 (unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1). Then, white_block_1 is clear. So after step 3, white_block_1 is on the table and clear. So in step 4, after putting down blue_block_1, the arm can pick up white_block_1. So step 4 is putdown blue_block_1, step 5 is pickup white_block_1. Then in step 5, the arm is holding white_block_1. That satisfies the second constraint. Then, we can putdown white_block_1 again (step 6), but that's not necessary. Alternatively, perhaps we can hold it and then use it in some way, but that might complicate things. So steps 1-5 would include holding white_block_1, which meets the second constraint.

Third constraint: red_block_1 is on the table in some state. Initially, it's on the table, so that's already satisfied. So the third constraint is automatically met because the initial state is part of the plan. However, the fourth constraint says that if red_block_1 is on the table in any state, then in that state or a later one, purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 must be on the table. So in the initial state, red_block_1 is on the table. So the constraint requires that in the initial state or later, purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 is on the table. But in the initial state, purple_block_1 is on green_block_1 (not on table), and purple_block_2 is on purple_block_1 (also not on table). So the initial state violates the constraint unless in some later state, either purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 is on the table. Therefore, the plan must include putting either purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 on the table at some point after the initial state.

So during the plan, we need to move purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 to the table. How?

Looking back at the current steps:

After step 1 (unstack purple_block_3 from red_block_1), step 2 (putdown purple_block_3), step 3 (unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1), step 4 (putdown blue_block_1), step 5 (pickup white_block_1), step 6 (putdown white_block_1), step 7 (pickup red_block_1), step 8 (stack red_block_1 on purple_block_3).

In this plan, purple_block_1 and purple_block_2 are still in their initial positions. So to satisfy the fourth constraint, we need to move either purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 to the table. Let's see. The initial stack is green_block_1 -> purple_block_1 -> purple_block_2. To get purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 on the table, we need to unstack them. For example, unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1, put it down. Then purple_block_2 is on the table. That would satisfy the fourth constraint. But this adds more steps. 

Alternatively, unstack purple_block_1 from green_block_1. But that requires first unstacking purple_block_2 from purple_block_1. Because purple_block_2 is on top of purple_block_1. So:

Steps:

a. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1

b. putdown purple_block_2

Then purple_block_1 is clear. Then, unstack purple_block_1 green_block_1, put it down. But this adds steps. So this seems like a lot, but perhaps necessary.

But this would be in addition to the previous steps. So the plan is getting longer. The problem states that the plan must be optimal (as short as possible). So maybe there's a way to satisfy all constraints with fewer steps.

Alternative approach: Let's see if during the plan, we can move purple_block_2 to the table, which would satisfy the fourth constraint. So let's insert steps to unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1 and put it down. Let's see when that can be done.

But in the initial state, purple_block_2 is on purple_block_1, which is on green_block_1. To unstack purple_block_2, the arm must be empty, and purple_block_2 is clear. It is clear initially. So step 1 could be unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1, then put it down. Then, purple_block_2 is on the table. That way, in the initial state, red_block_1 is on the table, and later, purple_block_2 is on the table. So the fourth constraint is satisfied because when red_block_1 is on the table in the initial state, there's a later state where purple_block_2 is on the table.

But if we do that, then we need to also handle the other constraints. Let's see.

So revised steps:

1. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1

2. putdown purple_block_2 (now purple_block_2 is on the table)

3. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1

4. putdown purple_block_3

5. pickup red_block_1

6. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

But also, need to handle the blue_block_1 constraint (hold it) and the second constraint (hold white_block_1 or stack green on purple_2).

So in this plan, step 1: unstack purple_block_2, step 2: putdown. That makes purple_block_2 on the table, which helps with the fourth constraint. Then steps 3-6 as before. But this plan doesn't handle the blue_block_1 and the second constraint.

So after step 2, perhaps:

3. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1 (hold blue_block_1)

4. putdown blue_block_1 (constraint 1 is satisfied here)

5. pickup white_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 2)

6. putdown white_block_1

Then proceed with steps 3-6 (unstack purple_block_3, etc.)

Wait, but the order matters. Let me outline:

1. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1

2. putdown purple_block_2 (now purple_block_2 is on table)

3. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1 (arm holds blue_block_1)

4. putdown blue_block_1 (arm empty)

5. pickup white_block_1 (arm holds white_block_1; satisfies constraint 2)

6. putdown white_block_1

7. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1

8. putdown purple_block_3

9. pickup red_block_1

10. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

Now, this plan has 10 steps. Let's check the constraints:

1. Holding blue_block_1: yes, in step 3.

2. Holding white_block_1: step 5.

3. red_block_1 is on the table: initially yes, and after step 7, red_block_1 is on the table again (since purple_block_3 was on it, then unstacked, so red_block_1 is clear and on table). So red_block_1 is on the table in the initial state and after step 7. The fourth constraint applies to all states where red_block_1 is on the table. For the initial state, after step 2, purple_block_2 is on the table. So in the initial state, red_block_1 is on the table, and after step 2, purple_block_2 is on the table. So the fourth constraint is satisfied for the initial state because in a later state (step 2), purple_block_2 is on the table. For the state after step 7, red_block_1 is on the table. So we need to ensure that in that state or later, purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 is on the table. In step 2, purple_block_2 is on the table, and remains there unless moved. Since in this plan, after step 2, purple_block_2 is on the table and not moved again. So in step 7, red_block_1 is on the table, and purple_block_2 is still on the table. So the constraint is satisfied. So this plan meets all constraints.

But is this the optimal plan? Let's count the steps: 10 actions. Can we find a shorter plan?

Alternative approach: Find a way to satisfy multiple constraints with fewer actions.

For example, when we unstack blue_block_1 to hold it (satisfy constraint 1), then we have white_block_1 clear. So then, after putting down blue_block_1, we can pick up white_block_1 (satisfying constraint 2). Then, proceed to handle purple_block_3 and red_block_1. Also, we need to make sure that purple_block_2 is on the table at some point to satisfy the fourth constraint.

Wait, but the fourth constraint requires that whenever red_block_1 is on the table, purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 is on the table at that time or later. So if we can ensure that purple_block_2 is on the table before any state where red_block_1 is on the table after the initial state, then it's okay. 

In the initial plan where we unstack purple_block_3, put it down, then pick up red_block_1, the red_block_1 is on the table until step 3 (pickup red_block_1). So after step 2, red_block_1 is on the table. So we need to ensure that in step 2 or later, purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 is on the table. If we put purple_block_2 on the table before that.

So let's try:

1. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1

2. putdown purple_block_2 (now on table)

3. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1

4. putdown purple_block_3

5. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1

6. putdown blue_block_1 (now constraint 1 satisfied)

7. pickup white_block_1 (constraint 2)

8. putdown white_block_1

9. pickup red_block_1

10. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

This is 10 steps again. Alternatively, after step 2, we have purple_block_2 on the table. Then, steps 3-10 as before. But maybe we can interleave actions.

Wait, maybe after unstacking purple_block_2 (steps 1-2), we can then unstack blue_block_1 (step3), hold it (satisfy constraint 1), put it down (step4), then pickup white_block_1 (step5), put it down (step6). Then handle purple_block_3 and red_block_1. But this is 10 steps.

Is there a way to reduce steps?

What if after unstacking purple_block_3 and putting it down, we then stack red_block_1 on purple_block_3. But to do that, red_block_1 needs to be picked up. But after unstacking purple_block_3, red_block_1 is clear and on the table. So pickup red_block_1 and stack. That's steps 1-4. But need to also handle the constraints.

So steps:

1. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1

2. putdown purple_block_3

3. pickup red_block_1

4. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

But this doesn't address the other constraints. So we need to insert the actions for constraints.

But how to satisfy holding blue_block_1 and holding white_block_1, and moving purple_block_2 to the table.

Alternatively, maybe after moving purple_block_3 and red_block_1, we can use the robotic arm to handle blue_block_1 and white_block_1. But the problem is that the arm is holding red_block_1 when stacking it. So after step 4, the arm is empty. Then, we can unstack blue_block_1, hold it (constraint 1), put it down. Then pick up white_block_1 (constraint 2), put it down. But these steps would be after achieving the goal. However, the plan's goal is achieved at step 4. But the constraints must be met during the plan's execution. So the steps after the goal is achieved are still part of the plan and can satisfy the constraints. But since the problem requires the plan to bring about the goal, perhaps those steps can be added after the goal is achieved, but that's not optimal. Because the optimal plan is the shortest possible. So adding steps after the goal would make the plan longer than necessary. 

Wait, but the constraints may require that certain conditions are met during the plan's execution, which could be before or after the goal is achieved. So maybe it's possible to meet the constraints after achieving the goal, but that would increase the plan length. However, the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). So we need to find a way to meet the constraints while achieving the goal in the fewest steps.

Let me think of a different approach. Let's see:

- The fourth constraint is tricky because it requires that whenever red_block_1 is on the table, either purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 is on the table at that state or later. The initial state has red_block_1 on the table, so we need to ensure that in the initial state or later, purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 is on the table. But in the initial state, neither is on the table. So we must have a later state where one of them is on the table. So during the plan, we must move either purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 to the table.

Option: Move purple_block_2 to the table. Steps to do that:

1. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1

2. putdown purple_block_2

Now, purple_block_2 is on the table. This satisfies the fourth constraint for the initial state (since in a later state, purple_block_2 is on the table). Then proceed with the steps to achieve the goal.

But also need to handle the other constraints.

So after step 2:

3. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1

4. putdown purple_block_3

5. pickup red_block_1

6. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

This is steps 1-6. But also need to handle holding blue_block_1 and holding white_block_1.

So after step 6, the arm is empty. Then:

7. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1

8. putdown blue_block_1 (constraint 1 met)

9. pickup white_block_1 (constraint 2 met)

10. putdown white_block_1

This adds 4 more steps, totaling 10. But perhaps there's a way to combine some steps.

Wait, during the process of moving purple_block_2 and handling the goal, can we also handle the other constraints?

For example:

After step 2 (purple_block_2 is on the table), then:

3. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1 (hold blue_block_1)

4. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_2 (now blue_block_1 is on purple_block_2, which is on the table. This would make purple_block_2 not clear, but after stacking, the arm is empty. But maybe this isn't necessary. Alternatively, putdown blue_block_1 after step 3. Then:

3. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1

4. putdown blue_block_1 (constraint 1 met)

5. pickup white_block_1 (constraint 2 met)

6. putdown white_block_1

7. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1

8. putdown purple_block_3

9. pickup red_block_1

10. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

This is 10 steps. But maybe there's a way to reduce steps. For example, after unstacking blue_block_1, can we use it in a way that also helps with another constraint? Not sure.

Alternatively, after unstacking purple_block_2 (step 1), putting it down (step 2), then unstacking blue_block_1 (step 3), then holding white_block_1 (step 4). So:

1. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1

2. putdown purple_block_2

3. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1

4. putdown blue_block_1

5. pickup white_block_1

6. putdown white_block_1

7. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1

8. putdown purple_block_3

9. pickup red_block_1

10. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

Still 10 steps. Is there a way to merge some actions?

Wait, after step 3 (unstack blue_block_1), the arm is holding blue_block_1. Then, instead of putting it down, can we use it to satisfy the second constraint by stacking it somewhere else, but that may not help. Or, perhaps after unstacking blue_block_1, we can hold white_block_1 immediately. But no, to pickup white_block_1, the arm must be empty. So after step 3, the arm is holding blue_block_1. We need to put it down (step4) before picking up white_block_1 (step5).

Alternatively, after step3 (unstack blue_block_1), the arm holds blue_block_1. Then, instead of putting it down, perhaps stack it on another block. But where? If we stack it on purple_block_2 (which is on the table), that's possible. So:

1. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1

2. putdown purple_block_2

3. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1

4. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_2

Now, blue_block_1 is on purple_block_2, which is on the table. This satisfies the holding blue_block_1 (step3-4) and also leaves white_block_1 clear. Then, we can pickup white_block_1 (step5), put it down (step6), then handle purple_block_3 and red_block_1.

This would be steps 1-4: 4 steps, then:

5. pickup white_block_1

6. putdown white_block_1

7. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1

8. putdown purple_block_3

9. pickup red_block_1

10. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

Total steps: 10. But stacking blue_block_1 on purple_block_2 may not be necessary, but it saves a putdown action. Wait, no. Instead of putdown blue_block_1 (step4), we do stack blue_block_1 on purple_block_2. Which is one action instead of putdown. But the total steps remain the same. But maybe this is better because it could allow for some other optimizations.

Alternatively, after stacking blue_block_1 on purple_block_2, we can later unstack it if needed. But not necessary.

In any case, this approach doesn't reduce the number of steps. So it seems that the minimal plan requires 10 steps. But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Alternative idea: Use the unstacking of purple_block_2 to satisfy the fourth constraint, and also use the holding of blue_block_1 and white_block_1 in the process.

Wait, perhaps after moving purple_block_2 to the table (steps 1-2), then when handling blue_block_1 and white_block_1, maybe there's a way to hold white_block_1 while also satisfying the fourth constraint.

But I'm not sure. Let's think of another angle.

The fourth constraint is only triggered if red_block_1 is on the table. So after the initial state, red_block_1 is on the table until it's picked up. So in the initial plan where we unstack purple_block_3, put it down, then pickup red_block_1 and stack it, the red_block_1 is on the table during steps 0 (initial state), 1 (unstack purple_block_3), 2 (putdown purple_block_3), and 3 (pickup red_block_1). So in steps 0-2, red_block_1 is on the table. So during those steps, the fourth constraint requires that in any of those steps or later, purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 is on the table. In step 0, neither is on the table. So we must have a state after step 0 where one of them is on the table. So moving purple_block_2 to the table in step 2 would satisfy that.

But how to do that. So perhaps:

1. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1

2. putdown purple_block_2

Now, purple_block_2 is on the table. Then proceed to handle purple_block_3 and red_block_1:

3. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1

4. putdown purple_block_3

5. pickup red_block_1

6. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

Now, steps 1-6. This meets the fourth constraint because in step 2, purple_block_2 is on the table. So after the initial state (step0), we have step2 where purple_block_2 is on the table, satisfying the fourth constraint. Then, in steps3-6, red_block_1 is picked up and stacked, so it's no longer on the table. So the fourth constraint is satisfied.

But this plan has 6 steps. But we also need to satisfy the first and second constraints.

The first constraint: must hold blue_block_1. So in the current plan, blue_block_1 is still on white_block_1. So we need to unstack blue_block_1. So insert steps after step2 or elsewhere.

For example:

After step2:

3. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1 (hold blue_block_1)

4. putdown blue_block_1 (step4)

5. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1

6. putdown purple_block_3

7. pickup red_block_1

8. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

This adds steps3-4. Now the plan is steps1-8. But also need to satisfy the second constraint: either green_block_1 on purple_block_2 or hold white_block_1. In this plan, after step4, white_block_1 is clear (since blue_block_1 was unstacked). So can we pickup white_block_1 after step4:

5. pickup white_block_1 (step5)

6. putdown white_block_1 (step6)

Then proceed:

7. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1 (step7)

8. putdown purple_block_3 (step8)

9. pickup red_block_1 (step9)

10. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3 (step10)

Now, this is 10 steps again.

But this seems necessary. So the minimal plan is 10 steps. Is there a way to combine some steps?

For example, after unstacking purple_block_2 (step1), put it down (step2). Then unstack blue_block_1 (step3), and instead of putting it down, stack it on purple_block_2 (step4). Then pickup white_block_1 (step5), put it down (step6), then handle purple_block_3 and red_block_1. This would be steps1-6, then steps for purple_block_3:

7. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1

8. putdown purple_block_3

9. pickup red_block_1

10. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

Total steps: 10. Same as before.

Alternatively, after stacking blue_block_1 on purple_block_2 (step4), can we use that to satisfy the second constraint? For example, green_block_1 on purple_block_2. But green_block_1 is on the table. To put green_block_1 on purple_block_2, which is now holding blue_block_1, we would need to move green_block_1, but that's under purple_block_1 and purple_block_2. Not feasible. So the other option is to hold white_block_1, which is easier.

So, it seems that the minimal plan is 10 steps. But I'm not sure if there's a shorter way.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to satisfy the second constraint by holding white_block_1 without having to put it down. For example, after unstacking blue_block_1 (step3), put it down (step4), then pickup white_block_1 (step5), and then use it in some way. But how? To stack it on something. But that would require additional steps. Or perhaps just holding it is enough for the constraint, even if we don't put it down. But the constraint requires that in at least one state, you are holding white_block_1. So if in step5, you pick it up and then immediately put it down, that satisfies the constraint. So steps5-6 could be:

5. pickup white_block_1

6. putdown white_block_1

But those steps are necessary.

Alternatively, after step5 (holding white_block_1), could we use it in the process of stacking red_block_1? Probably not. So it's better to put it down.

So the steps are necessary. 

Thus, the optimal plan seems to be 10 steps. But is there a smarter way to handle the constraints?

Let me check again the constraints:

1. Must hold blue_block_1.

2. Either green_block_1 on purple_block_2 or hold white_block_1.

3. red_block_1 is on the table in some state (already satisfied initially).

4. If red_block_1 is on the table in any state, then in that state or later, purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 is on the table.

So, after step2 (putdown purple_block_2), purple_block_2 is on the table. So for the initial state, since in a later state (step2), purple_block_2 is on the table, the fourth constraint is satisfied.

Then, during the steps of moving purple_block_3 and red_block_1, red_block_1 is on the table until it's picked up. So during those steps, purple_block_2 is already on the table (step2), so the fourth constraint is satisfied.

So, the steps to handle purple_block_2 and purple_block_3/red_block_1 can proceed without interference.

Now, the blue_block_1 constraint and white_block_1 constraint can be handled by unstacking blue_block_1, putting it down, then picking up white_block_1.

So combining all this, the plan would be:

1. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1

2. putdown purple_block_2

3. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1

4. putdown blue_block_1

5. pickup white_block_1

6. putdown white_block_1

7. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1

8. putdown purple_block_3

9. pickup red_block_1

10. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

Now, let's check all constraints:

1. Holding blue_block_1: step3.

2. Holding white_block_1: step5.

3. red_block_1 on table: initial state, and after step7 (when purple_block_3 is unstacked, red_block_1 is on table).

4. For red_block_1 on table in initial state: satisfied by step2 (purple_block_2 on table).

For red_block_1 on table after step7: in step7, red_block_1 is on table, and purple_block_2 is still on table (from step2). So the fourth constraint is satisfied.

This plan has 10 steps. Is there a shorter way?

What if we can merge some steps. For example, after unstacking purple_block_2, instead of putting it down, use it somewhere else. But that may not help.

Alternatively, after unstacking blue_block_1, can we put it on purple_block_3 instead of putting it down? But then when we need to putdown purple_block_3, it's under blue_block_1, which would complicate things. Probably not.

Alternatively, after unstacking blue_block_1, hold it (step3), then pickup white_block_1. But the arm can't hold two blocks. So no.

Another idea: After unstacking purple_block_2, put it down. Then unstack blue_block_1 and put it on purple_block_2. Then pickup white_block_1. This would require:

1. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1

2. putdown purple_block_2

3. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1

4. stack blue_block_1 purple_block_2

5. pickup white_block_1

6. putdown white_block_1

7. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1

8. putdown purple_block_3

9. pickup red_block_1

10. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

This is still 10 steps. But perhaps step4 saves a putdown action. But no, because step4 is a stack action instead of a putdown. So the number of steps is the same.

Thus, it seems that 10 steps are required. But I'm not sure if there's a way to reduce this further.

Wait, what if after unstacking purple_block_2 (step1), we put it down (step2). Then unstack blue_block_1 (step3), and put it on the table (step4). Then pickup white_block_1 (step5), but instead of putting it down, can we use it in a way that helps? Like stacking it somewhere. But that would require more steps. So no.

Alternatively, after step5 (holding white_block_1), can we stack it on purple_block_2? But purple_block_2 has blue_block_1 on it after step3 and step4 (if we put blue_block_1 down). Wait, no. In the previous plan, after step4, blue_block_1 is on the table. So white_block_1 is clear. So step5 is pickup white_block_1. Then, stacking it on purple_block_2 would require that purple_block_2 is clear. Which it is, because blue_block_1 is on the table. So:

6. stack white_block_1 purple_block_2

Then, steps7-10:

7. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1

8. putdown purple_block_3

9. pickup red_block_1

10. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

This would be steps1-10. But step6 stacks white_block_1 on purple_block_2, which is on the table. So in this case, the constraint for step2 (purple_block_2 on table) is still satisfied. But this doesn't reduce the number of steps, but just changes the actions. So the total steps are the same.

But this satisfies all constraints. So the plan would be valid.

But the problem asks for the optimal (shortest) plan. So we need to find the minimal number of steps.

Wait, maybe there's a way to have the same action count. Let's think again.

The plan must include:

- Moving purple_block_2 to the table (steps1-2)

- Holding blue_block_1 (steps3-4)

- Holding white_block_1 (steps5-6)

- Handling purple_block_3 and red_block_1 (steps7-10)

Total 10 steps. Is there a way to reduce this?

What if after unstacking blue_block_1 (step3), we put it down (step4), then pickup white_block_1 (step5), and then use white_block_1 in some way that allows us to stack red_block_1 more efficiently? Not really.

Alternatively, after unstacking purple_block_3 (step7), we can stack red_block_1 on purple_block_3 without putting down purple_block_3. But that's not possible because red_block_1 is on the table, and we need to pick it up. So steps7-10 are necessary.

Another idea: Can we unstack blue_block_1 and white_block_1 in a way that satisfies both constraints? For example, unstack blue_block_1 and hold it (constraint1), then while holding it, pickup white_block_1. But no, the arm can't hold two blocks.

Alternatively, after unstacking blue_block_1 and putting it down, pickup white_block_1. That's steps3-5. But that's necessary.

Thus, it seems that the minimal plan is 10 steps. But perhaps there's a way to reduce this. Let me check if any steps are redundant.

For example, after moving purple_block_2 to the table (steps1-2), then handling blue_block_1 and white_block_1 (steps3-6), then moving purple_block_3 and red_block_1 (steps7-10). All steps seem necessary to meet the constraints.

Thus, the final plan would be:

```
1. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1
2. putdown purple_block_2
3. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
4. putdown blue_block_1
5. pickup white_block_1
6. putdown white_block_1
7. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
8. putdown purple_block_3
9. pickup red_block_1
10. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3
```

But I need to check if this plan meets all constraints.

Constraint1: Holding blue_block_1 in step3.

Constraint2: Holding white_block_1 in step5.

Constraint3: red_block_1 is on the table in initial state and after step7.

Constraint4: For the initial state (red_block_1 on table), after step2, purple_block_2 is on table. For step7, red_block_1 is on table, and purple_block_2 is still on table. So constraint4 is satisfied.

Thus, this plan meets all constraints and is 10 steps.

But is there a shorter plan? Let me think again.

Alternative plan:

1. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1

2. putdown blue_block_1 (constraint1 met)

3. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1

4. stack purple_block_3 red_block_1 (wait, no, the goal is red_block_1 on purple_block_3. So after step3, purple_block_3 is held. Then, put it down. Then pickup red_block_1 and stack on purple_block_3. But this would require:

3. putdown purple_block_3

4. pickup red_block_1

5. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

But during this, we need to satisfy the other constraints. Also, the fourth constraint: in the initial state, red_block_1 is on table, so after step2, we need to have purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 on table. But in this approach, we haven't moved purple_block_2 or purple_block_1. So after step2, neither is on table. Thus, violating the fourth constraint.

Thus, this approach won't work.

Another idea: In the process of moving purple_block_3 and red_block_1, can we satisfy the fourth constraint by moving purple_block_1 or purple_block_2 during that process.

For example:

After unstacking purple_block_3 and putting it down, then unstack purple_block_2 from purple_block_1 and put it down. Then proceed. But this would add steps but perhaps meet the fourth constraint.

But this would require:

1. unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1

2. putdown purple_block_3

3. unstack purple_block_2 purple_block_1

4. putdown purple_block_2

5. pickup red_block_1

6. stack red_block_1 purple_block_3

But this is 6 steps. But need to handle blue_block_1 and white_block_1.

Then steps:

7. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1

8. putdown blue_block_1

9. pickup white_block_1

10. putdown white_block_1

Total 10 steps again. So same as before.

Thus, regardless of the order in which we handle the constraints, the plan requires 10 steps. Therefore, this seems to be the minimal length.
