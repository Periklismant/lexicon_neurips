Okay, let's break this down. We need to get red_block_1 on top of purple_block_3. Currently, purple_block_3 is on top of red_block_1. So we need to unstack them, and then stack them in the reverse order. We also have a few constraints to satisfy along the way.

Here's the plan:

```
```
unstack purple_block_3 red_block_1
putdown purple_block_3
pickup red_block_1
stack red_block_1 purple_block_3
```
