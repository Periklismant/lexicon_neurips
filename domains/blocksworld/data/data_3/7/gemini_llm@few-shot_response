Okay, let's break this down. We need to get blue_block_2 on the table. Currently, blue_block_2 is on top of white_block_2, which is on top of blue_block_1, which is on top of white_block_1. So we need to unstack blue_block_2, then unstack white_block_2, then unstack blue_block_1, and then putdown blue_block_2.

We also have several constraints to satisfy:
1.  "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" must hold at some point, and if it does, "white_block_2 is on the table" must hold at that point or later.
2.  "grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" must hold at some point, and if it does, "red_block_1 is not clear" must hold at that point or later.
3.  "blue_block_1 is not on the table" must hold at some point, and if it does, "purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1" must hold at that point or later.

Let's try to satisfy these constraints while achieving the goal. To satisfy "blue_block_1 is not on the table", we need to unstack white_block_2 from it. To satisfy "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" and "grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1", we need to move red_block_1 and grey_block_1.

Here's a plan:

```
```
unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2
unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
putdown blue_block_2
```
