Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this Blocksworld problem. So, the initial state is a bit complex with several blocks stacked. The goal is to have blue_block_2 on the table. But there are also some constraints that need to be satisfied during the plan. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the initial setup. The blocks are arranged as follows:

- white_block_1 is on the table with blue_block_1 on top, then white_block_2, and blue_block_2 on top of that. So the tower here is white_block_1 (table) → blue_block_1 → white_block_2 → blue_block_2.

- purple_block_1 is on the table with red_block_1 on top. So purple_block_1 → red_block_1.

- grey_block_1 is alone on the table.

The goal is to get blue_block_2 onto the table. Since blue_block_2 is currently on top of white_block_2, we need to unstack it. To do that, the robotic arm needs to pick up blue_block_2. But blue_block_2 is clear (no blocks on top), so that's possible. But first, the arm must be empty. So the first step would be to unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2. Wait, but the unstack action requires that the block to be unstacked is on top of another. So yes, blue_block_2 is on white_block_2. So unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2. Then put it down. But wait, after unstacking, the arm is holding blue_block_2. Then we can put it down. So that would achieve the goal. But wait, that's just two actions. But there are constraints that need to be satisfied. So the plan can't just be those two steps because it needs to satisfy the constraints.

Let's look at the constraints:

1. "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" must hold in at least one state. But initially, red_block_1 is on purple_block_1, so it's not on white_block_1. Wait, in the initial state, red_block_1 is on purple_block_1, which is on the table. So "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is already true in the initial state. Does that count? But maybe the first constraint requires that this condition is true in at least one state of the plan. Since it's already true in the initial state, that might satisfy the first constraint. But then the second constraint says that if that condition holds in some state s, then "white_block_2 is on the table" must hold at s or after. But in the initial state, white_block_2 is on blue_block_1, not on the table. So the first constraint is satisfied in the initial state, but then the second constraint requires that in that state (the initial state) or after, white_block_2 must be on the table. Since the initial state doesn't have white_block_2 on the table, we need to ensure that after the initial state, white_block_2 is put on the table at some point. So even if the first constraint is already met, the second constraint requires that white_block_2 is on the table at some point after. Because the initial state's condition triggers the implication. Wait, the constraint is: if red_block_1 is not on white_block_1 in state s, then white_block_2 must be on the table in s or a later state. Since the initial state s0 has red_block_1 not on white_block_1, then white_block_2 must be on the table in s0 or later. But in s0, it's not. So the plan must include putting white_block_2 on the table at some point after s0. But our initial plan to just unstack blue_block_2 and put it down doesn't do that. So we need to adjust the plan to include moving white_block_2 to the table.

Wait, but the goal is only blue_block_2 on the table. So the plan might need to handle moving white_block_2 to the table as part of satisfying the constraints. Let's see.

Another constraint is the third one: "grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" must hold in at least one state. Initially, grey_block_1 is on the table, so it's not on white_block_1. So this condition is already true in the initial state. Then the fourth constraint says that if this is true in some state s, then there must be a block on top of red_block_1 (making red_block_1 not clear) in s or after. Currently, red_block_1 is clear. So the implication here is that if we have a state where grey_block_1 is not on white_block_1 (which is always true except if we put it there), then we must have red_block_1 not clear at some point. Since grey_block_1 is not on white_block_1 in the initial state, this triggers the need to have red_block_1 not clear (i.e., something on top of it) either in the initial state (which it's not) or later. So in the plan, we must put a block on top of red_block_1.

Then the fifth constraint: "blue_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in at least one state. Initially, blue_block_1 is on white_block_1, which is on the table. So blue_block_1 is not on the table. Wait, the initial state says blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1. So blue_block_1 is not on the table. Therefore, the fifth constraint is already satisfied in the initial state. Then the sixth constraint says that if blue_block_1 is not on the table in some state s, then purple_block_1 must be on top of grey_block_1 in s or after. But in the initial state, blue_block_1 is not on the table, so this triggers the need for purple_block_1 to be on grey_block_1 at some point. Currently, purple_block_1 is on the table with red_block_1 on top. So we need to move purple_block_1 onto grey_block_1.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me list all the constraints again:

Constraints:

1. At least one state where red_block_1 is not on white_block_1. (Already true initially)

2. If in any state s, red_block_1 is not on white_block_1, then in s or after, white_block_2 is on the table.

Since s0 (initial state) satisfies the antecedent, we need white_block_2 on table in s0 or later. But in s0, it's not. So must have white_block_2 on table at some point.

3. At least one state where grey_block_1 is not on white_block_1. (Already true initially)

4. If in any state s, grey_block_1 is not on white_block_1, then in s or after, red_block_1 is not clear (has a block on top).

Since s0 satisfies the antecedent, we need red_block_1 to have a block on top at some point.

5. At least one state where blue_block_1 is not on the table. (Already true, since it's on white_block_1)

6. If in any state s, blue_block_1 is not on the table, then in s or after, purple_block_1 is on grey_block_1.

Since s0 satisfies the antecedent, we need purple_block_1 on grey_block_1 at some point.

So the plan must achieve the goal (blue_block_2 on table) and also:

- Put white_block_2 on table (to satisfy constraint 2)

- Put a block on top of red_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 4)

- Put purple_block_1 on grey_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 6)

Additionally, the constraints 1,3,5 are already satisfied in the initial state, so we don't need to do anything extra for them as long as we don't undo those conditions. But we need to make sure that the required implications are met.

So the plan must include actions that:

1. Move white_block_2 to the table.

2. Place a block on red_block_1.

3. Place purple_block_1 on grey_block_1.

And the main goal is to get blue_block_2 on the table.

So how to approach this?

Let me think about the order. To get blue_block_2 on the table, we need to unstack it from white_block_2. But white_block_2 is under blue_block_2. So unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2, then put it down. That's two actions. But we also need to move white_block_2 to the table. Because in the initial state, white_block_2 is on blue_block_1, so to put it on the table, we need to unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1, but blue_block_1 is under white_block_2. However, blue_block_1 has blue_block_1 on white_block_1, which is on the table. So white_block_2 is on blue_block_1, and blue_block_2 is on white_block_2. So the initial stack is:

white_block_1 (table) → blue_block_1 → white_block_2 → blue_block_2.

To unstack blue_block_2, we can do unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2, then putdown blue_block_2. That would achieve the goal, but we still have to satisfy the constraints.

But white_block_2 is on blue_block_1. To move white_block_2 to the table, we need to unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1. But blue_block_1 is under white_block_2. However, after moving blue_block_2, white_block_2 is clear. So after putting blue_block_2 down, we can pick up white_block_2 (since it's on blue_block_1 and clear) and put it on the table. That would satisfy the constraint 2. But then, the initial state already satisfies the antecedent of constraint 2, so we need to make sure that white_block_2 is on the table at some point. So moving it to the table after blue_block_2 is done would satisfy that.

Then, placing a block on red_block_1. Currently, red_block_1 is on purple_block_1. So to put something on red_block_1, we need to pick up a block and stack it on red_block_1. The available blocks that are clear initially are red_block_1 (but it's under nothing), blue_block_2 (but we need to move that), grey_block_1 (on table, clear), and purple_block_1 has red_block_1 on top, so purple_block_1 is not clear. Wait, in the initial state, the blocks on table are white_block_1, purple_block_1, grey_block_1. But purple_block_1 has red_block_1 on top, so purple_block_1 is not clear. So the clear blocks are: white_block_1 (has blue_block_1 on top, so not clear?), wait no: the initial state says blue_block_1 is on white_block_1, so white_block_1 is not clear. The clear blocks in initial state are red_block_1 (since nothing is on top), grey_block_1 (clear), and blue_block_2 (clear). So the clear blocks are red_block_1, grey_block_1, blue_block_2.

Wait, the initial state:

- white_block_1 has blue_block_1 on it → white_block_1 not clear.

- blue_block_1 has white_block_2 on it → blue_block_1 not clear.

- white_block_2 has blue_block_2 on it → white_block_2 not clear.

- blue_block_2 is clear.

- purple_block_1 has red_block_1 on it → purple_block_1 not clear.

- red_block_1 is clear.

- grey_block_1 is clear.

So to stack something on red_block_1, we need to have a block in hand and red_block_1 clear. Since red_block_1 is clear initially, but after stacking something on it, it won't be clear. So possible candidates: take grey_block_1 and stack it on red_block_1. Or take red_block_1 and move it? Wait, no. To stack on red_block_1, we need to have a block to place on it. So maybe use grey_block_1. So pick up grey_block_1 (since it's on table and clear), then stack it on red_block_1. That would make red_block_1 not clear, satisfying constraint 4.

Then, the constraint 6 requires that purple_block_1 is on grey_block_1. Currently, purple_block_1 is on the table with red_block_1 on top. To move purple_block_1 onto grey_block_1, we need to first remove red_block_1 from purple_block_1. Because purple_block_1 has red_block_1 on top. So unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1, then put it down. Then, we can pick up purple_block_1 and stack it on grey_block_1. But stacking purple_block_1 on grey_block_1 would require that grey_block_1 is clear. However, if we first stack grey_block_1 on red_block_1, then grey_block_1 is no longer on the table, so purple_block_1 can be stacked on grey_block_1? Wait, no. If grey_block_1 is on red_block_1, then to stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1, we need grey_block_1 to be clear. But if grey_block_1 is on red_block_1, then after stacking, grey_block_1 would have purple_block_1 on top. So that's possible. Wait, let's think.

But the sequence would be:

1. Unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1. Preconditions: red_block_1 is on purple_block_1, red_block_1 is clear (it is), and the arm is empty. So unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1. Then putdown red_block_1. Now, purple_block_1 is clear. Then pick up purple_block_1 and stack it on grey_block_1 (if grey_block_1 is clear). But if we previously stacked grey_block_1 on red_block_1, then grey_block_1 is not on the table, but on red_block_1. So to stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1, we need grey_block_1 to be clear. But if grey_block_1 is on red_block_1, then after stacking, purple_block_1 would be on grey_block_1, making grey_block_1 not clear. But initially, grey_block_1 is on the table. Let's see.

Alternative approach: First, handle the purple_block_1 and grey_block_1 constraint. To have purple_block_1 on grey_block_1, we need to:

- Remove red_block_1 from purple_block_1 (unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1, then put it down).

- Then, pick up purple_block_1 and stack it on grey_block_1.

But to stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1, grey_block_1 must be clear. Initially, it is. So:

Action 1: unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1.

Action 2: putdown red_block_1.

Action 3: pickup purple_block_1.

Action 4: stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1.

This would place purple_block_1 on grey_block_1, satisfying constraint 6.

But this sequence requires that after moving purple_block_1, we have to manage the other constraints. Also, after stacking purple_block_1 on grey_block_1, grey_block_1 is no longer clear. So if we need to use grey_block_1 for other purposes, this could complicate things. But according to constraint 4, we need to have something on red_block_1. So perhaps after putting purple_block_1 on grey_block_1, we can then take grey_block_1 and put it on red_block_1. But wait, grey_block_1 is under purple_block_1 now. So we can't pick it up unless we first remove purple_block_1. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps first stack grey_block_1 on red_block_1, then move purple_block_1 to grey_block_1. Wait, but that would require moving grey_block_1 from the table to red_block_1. Let's see:

Action 1: pickup grey_block_1 (since it's on table and clear).

Action 2: stack grey_block_1 red_block_1. This makes red_block_1 not clear, satisfying constraint 4.

Then, to move purple_block_1 to grey_block_1, we need to first remove red_block_1 from purple_block_1.

Wait, red_block_1 is under grey_block_1 now. So to get to purple_block_1, we need to unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1, put it down, then unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1, put it down, then pick up purple_block_1 and stack it on grey_block_1. That's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the order of operations should be:

First, handle the purple_block_1 on grey_block_1. Let's proceed as follows:

1. Unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1.

2. Putdown red_block_1.

3. Pickup purple_block_1.

4. Stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1.

This satisfies constraint 6. Then, to satisfy constraint 4 (putting something on red_block_1), we can use the red_block_1 that's now on the table. Wait, after step 2, red_block_1 is on the table. So if we need to put something on red_block_1, perhaps we can stack the grey_block_1 (from the table) onto red_block_1. But grey_block_1 is now under purple_block_1. Wait, no. After step 4, purple_block_1 is stacked on grey_block_1. So grey_block_1 is under purple_block_1, so it's not clear. So we can't pick up grey_block_1 anymore. Hmm, this complicates things.

Alternative approach: Maybe first stack grey_block_1 on red_block_1 to satisfy constraint 4, then handle purple_block_1 and grey_block_1.

So:

Action 1: pickup grey_block_1 (clear, on table).

Action 2: stack grey_block_1 red_block_1. Now red_block_1 is covered, satisfying constraint 4.

Then, to get purple_block_1 onto grey_block_1, we need to remove red_block_1's top block (grey_block_1) to access purple_block_1. But that's not directly helpful. Alternatively, after stacking grey_block_1 on red_block_1, we need to move purple_block_1 to grey_block_1. But purple_block_1 is under red_block_1 (original state had purple_block_1 on table with red_block_1 on top). Wait, no. Original state: purple_block_1 is on table, red_block_1 is on purple_block_1. So to move purple_block_1, we need to first remove red_block_1. But red_block_1 is under grey_block_1 after action 2. So to unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1, then unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1.

But this is getting too involved. Let's try to outline all necessary steps.

Main goal: blue_block_2 on table.

Constraints:

- white_block_2 must be on the table at some point.

- red_block_1 must have a block on top.

- purple_block_1 must be on grey_block_1.

So, steps needed:

1. Get blue_block_2 on table.

2. Get white_block_2 on table.

3. Get something on red_block_1.

4. Get purple_block_1 on grey_block_1.

But how to do this efficiently?

Let's start with the main goal. To move blue_block_2 to table:

Action 1: unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2.

Action 2: putdown blue_block_2.

This achieves the goal. Now, we need to handle the constraints.

For constraint 2: white_block_2 must be on the table. So we need to move white_block_2 to the table. Currently, white_block_2 is on blue_block_1, and after unstacking blue_block_2, white_block_2 is clear. So:

Action 3: unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1.

Action 4: putdown white_block_2.

This satisfies constraint 2.

Now, for constraint 4: something on red_block_1. Initially, red_block_1 is on purple_block_1. To put something on red_block_1, perhaps we can move grey_block_1 there:

Action 5: pickup grey_block_1.

Action 6: stack grey_block_1 red_block_1.

But red_block_1 is on purple_block_1. So we need to make sure that red_block_1 is clear. Initially, red_block_1 is clear. But after moving blue_block_2 and white_block_2, what's the state?

Wait, after action 4: white_block_2 is on table. So the blocks on the table are white_block_1, purple_block_1 (with red_block_1 on top?), grey_block_1, white_block_2, blue_block_2.

Wait, after action 2, blue_block_2 is on table. After action 4, white_block_2 is on table. The purple_block_1 is still on table with red_block_1 on top. So red_block_1 is on purple_block_1, which is on table, and red_block_1 is clear. So to stack grey_block_1 on red_block_1:

Action 5: pickup grey_block_1 (on table, clear).

Action 6: stack grey_block_1 red_block_1.

Now, red_block_1 has grey_block_1 on top, satisfying constraint 4.

Then, constraint 6: purple_block_1 must be on grey_block_1. Currently, purple_block_1 is on table with red_block_1 (now under grey_block_1) on top. To move purple_block_1 to grey_block_1, we need to first remove red_block_1 and grey_block_1 from purple_block_1. But red_block_1 is now under grey_block_1. So we need to unstack grey_block_1 from red_block_1, then unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1, then stack purple_block_1 onto grey_block_1.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's see:

After action 6, grey_block_1 is on red_block_1, which is on purple_block_1. So to access purple_block_1, we need to remove grey_block_1 and red_block_1.

So:

Action 7: unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1.

Action 8: putdown grey_block_1.

Action 9: unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1.

Action 10: putdown red_block_1.

Action 11: pickup purple_block_1.

Action 12: stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1.

But this adds a lot of steps. However, this would satisfy constraint 6. But this is making the plan longer. Is there a more efficient way?

Alternatively, after action 6 (stack grey_block_1 on red_block_1), if we could move purple_block_1 to grey_block_1, but purple_block_1 is under red_block_1. So to get purple_block_1, we have to first remove red_block_1 and grey_block_1. So that's necessary.

But this seems like a lot of steps. Maybe there's a better sequence.

Wait, perhaps instead of stacking grey_block_1 on red_block_1, stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1 first. Let's think:

After achieving the main goal (blue_block_2 on table), and moving white_block_2 to table, we need to handle the other constraints.

Let's try this approach:

Actions 1-4: unstack blue_block_2, putdown, unstack white_block_2, putdown. Now blue_block_2 and white_block_2 are on table.

Now, handle constraint 6: purple_block_1 on grey_block_1.

To do this:

Action 5: unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1.

Action 6: putdown red_block_1.

Action 7: pickup purple_block_1.

Action 8: stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1.

Now, purple_block_1 is on grey_block_1, satisfying constraint 6.

Then, to satisfy constraint 4 (something on red_block_1), we can use the red_block_1 that's on the table. So:

Action 9: pickup red_block_1.

Action 10: stack red_block_1 on some block. Wait, but we need to put something on red_block_1. Wait, no, constraint 4 requires that red_block_1 is not clear (has a block on top). So to satisfy that, we need to stack something on red_block_1. But after action 6, red_block_1 is on the table. So perhaps pick up another block and stack it on red_block_1.

What blocks are available? grey_block_1 is under purple_block_1 now. white_block_1 has blue_block_1 on top. blue_block_1 is on white_block_1. white_block_2 and blue_block_2 are on table. red_block_1 is on table. So available blocks on table: white_block_1 (with blue_block_1 on top), purple_block_1 (on grey_block_1), grey_block_1 (under purple_block_1), white_block_2, blue_block_2, red_block_1.

Wait, after action 8, purple_block_1 is on grey_block_1. So grey_block_1 is under purple_block_1 and not clear. So the only clear blocks on table are white_block_2, blue_block_2, red_block_1, and possibly blue_block_1.

Wait, blue_block_1 is on white_block_1. After actions 1-4, blue_block_1 is still on white_block_1, and white_block_2 was moved to table. So blue_block_1 is clear now? Because white_block_2 was unstacked from it. So blue_block_1 is clear. So can we pick up blue_block_1 and stack it on red_block_1?

Yes. So:

Action 9: pickup blue_block_1 (it's on white_block_1 and clear).

Action 10: stack blue_block_1 red_block_1.

This would make red_block_1 have blue_block_1 on top, satisfying constraint 4.

But then, blue_block_1 is now on red_block_1. Is that allowed? Yes.

So this sequence would satisfy all constraints.

Now, let's check all the steps:

1. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2

2. putdown blue_block_2

3. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1

4. putdown white_block_2

5. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1

6. putdown red_block_1

7. pickup purple_block_1

8. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1

9. pickup blue_block_1

10. stack blue_block_1 red_block_1

This plan has 10 actions. But is there a shorter way?

Wait, after step 4, white_block_2 is on table, satisfying constraint 2. After step 8, purple_block_1 is on grey_block_1, satisfying constraint 6. After step 10, red_block_1 has blue_block_1 on top, satisfying constraint 4. The main goal is achieved at step 2. All constraints are met.

But let's check if any steps can be optimized.

After step 4, blue_block_1 is clear. So instead of moving purple_block_1 and red_block_1, perhaps use blue_block_1 to stack on red_block_1, which is on table.

So:

1. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2 → holding blue_block_2

2. putdown blue_block_2 → done with main goal

3. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1 → holding white_block_2

4. putdown white_block_2 → now white_block_2 on table (constraint 2 satisfied)

5. pickup blue_block_1 → blue_block_1 is clear

6. stack blue_block_1 red_block_1 → red_block_1 now has blue_block_1 on top (constraint 4 satisfied)

7. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1 → but wait, red_block_1 is on purple_block_1. But after step 6, red_block_1 has blue_block_1 on top. So red_block_1 is not clear. So we can't unstack it unless we first remove blue_block_1.

Wait, this complicates things. Because in this approach, after step 6, red_block_1 has blue_block_1 on top. So to get purple_block_1 on grey_block_1, we need to move purple_block_1, but it's under red_block_1. So to move purple_block_1, we need to first remove red_block_1, which is under blue_block_1. So:

After step 6:

7. unstack blue_block_1 red_block_1 → pickup blue_block_1

8. putdown blue_block_1

9. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1

10. putdown red_block_1

11. pickup purple_block_1

12. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1

That's 12 steps, which is longer. So the previous plan with 10 steps is better.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to combine some steps. Let's see.

Original plan:

1. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2

2. putdown blue_block_2

3. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1

4. putdown white_block_2

5. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1

6. putdown red_block_1

7. pickup purple_block_1

8. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1

9. pickup blue_block_1

10. stack blue_block_1 red_block_1

Total 10 steps.

Is there a way to make this shorter? Let's see.

After step 4, white_block_2 is on table. Then, we need to handle purple_block_1 and red_block_1.

If instead of moving red_block_1 and purple_block_1, can we use another block to satisfy the constraints?

Wait, constraint 4 requires that red_block_1 is not clear. So any block on top of it.

After step 4, red_block_1 is on purple_block_1. So to stack something on red_block_1, we can pick up a block and stack it there. Available blocks: grey_block_1 (on table, clear). So steps:

5. pickup grey_block_1

6. stack grey_block_1 red_block_1 → satisfies constraint 4.

Then, handle purple_block_1 on grey_block_1.

But grey_block_1 is now on red_block_1. So to stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1, we need grey_block_1 to be clear. But it has purple_block_1 underneath? No. purple_block_1 is under red_block_1. Wait, red_block_1 is on purple_block_1. After step 6, grey_block_1 is on red_block_1. So purple_block_1 is under red_block_1, and grey_block_1 is on top. So to stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1, we need to have purple_block_1 in hand. But purple_block_1 is under red_block_1. So we need to unstack red_block_1 and grey_block_1 to get to purple_block_1.

This would require:

7. unstack grey_block_1 red_block_1

8. putdown grey_block_1

9. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1

10. putdown red_block_1

11. pickup purple_block_1

12. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1

That's 12 steps. Which is longer than the previous plan.

Alternatively, after step 6 (grey_block_1 on red_block_1), can we move purple_block_1?

No, because purple_block_1 is under red_block_1 and grey_block_1. So we can't access it.

Hmm. So the original plan where we move purple_block_1 first seems better.

But let's verify if the original plan meets all constraints.

The original plan:

1. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2 → holding blue_block_2

2. putdown blue_block_2 → blue_block_2 on table (goal achieved)

3. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1 → holding white_block_2

4. putdown white_block_2 → white_block_2 on table (constraint 2 satisfied)

5. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1 → holding red_block_1

6. putdown red_block_1 → red_block_1 on table

7. pickup purple_block_1 → holding purple_block_1

8. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1 → purple_block_1 on grey_block_1 (constraint 6 satisfied)

9. pickup blue_block_1 → holding blue_block_1

10. stack blue_block_1 red_block_1 → blue_block_1 on red_block_1 (constraint 4 satisfied)

Now, checking all constraints:

- Constraint 1: red_block_1 not on white_block_1. This is true in initial state and remains true.

- Constraint 2: after state 4, white_block_2 is on table. So satisfied.

- Constraint 3: grey_block_1 not on white_block_1. Always true.

- Constraint 4: in state 10, blue_block_1 is on red_block_1, making red_block_1 not clear. Satisfied.

- Constraint 5: blue_block_1 not on table. Initially true. After step 9-10, blue_block_1 is stacked on red_block_1, so not on table. So constraint 5 is still satisfied.

- Constraint 6: purple_block_1 on grey_block_1 (step 8). Satisfied.

All constraints are met. The main goal is achieved in step 2.

But is this plan optimal? Let's count the steps: 10 actions. Can we find a shorter plan?

Alternatively, after step 8 (stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1), maybe use purple_block_1 to satisfy constraint 4. But purple_block_1 is on grey_block_1. So stack something on red_block_1.

Wait, after step 6, red_block_1 is on the table. So we can stack any block on it. For example, in step 9, pickup blue_block_1 and stack it on red_block_1. That's what the original plan does.

Alternatively, after step 8, could we stack purple_block_1 onto red_block_1? But purple_block_1 is already on grey_block_1. To move it, we'd need to unstack it, which would require additional steps. Not helpful.

Another idea: after unstacking red_block_1 (step 5) and putting it down (step 6), can we stack purple_block_1 directly onto grey_block_1 (step 7-8). Then, perhaps use red_block_1 itself to stack on top of something else. But we need to stack something on red_block_1. So maybe use grey_block_1. But grey_block_1 is under purple_block_1. So no.

Alternatively, after step 8, pick up red_block_1 and stack it on something. But then that wouldn't help constraint 4, because red_block_1 would be on top of something else, but we need something on top of red_block_1.

No, that won't work.

So the original plan seems necessary.

But wait, is there a way to combine steps? For example, after unstacking red_block_1 (step5), can we directly stack it onto grey_block_1, but that would require moving purple_block_1 first. Not sure.

Alternatively, after step5 (holding red_block_1), instead of putting it down, can we stack it onto grey_block_1? Then, in step6, stack red_block_1 grey_block_1. This would place red_block_1 on grey_block_1, making grey_block_1 not clear. Then, we can pick up purple_block_1 and stack it on grey_block_1. But grey_block_1 already has red_block_1 on top. So we can't stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1 unless it's clear. So this doesn't work.

Alternatively, after step5 (holding red_block_1), stack it on grey_block_1. Then, red_block_1 is on grey_block_1. Then, pickup purple_block_1 and stack it on red_block_1. This would make purple_block_1 on red_block_1, which is on grey_block_1. This would satisfy constraint 4 (something on red_block_1), and constraint 6 (purple_block_1 on grey_block_1)? No, because purple_block_1 is on red_block_1, which is on grey_block_1. So purple_block_1 is not on grey_block_1. So constraint 6 is not satisfied.

So that's not helpful.

Thus, the original plan of 10 steps seems necessary. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, let's think again. The main goal is to get blue_block_2 on the table. The other constraints require moving white_block_2 to the table, putting something on red_block_1, and putting purple_block_1 on grey_block_1.

What if we can satisfy some constraints while achieving the main goal?

For example, when moving white_block_2 to the table, maybe that action also helps with another constraint. But I don't see how.

Alternatively, after moving blue_block_2, what if we stack it onto red_block_1? Then blue_block_2 is on red_block_1. That would satisfy constraint 4 (something on red_block_1), but then we would have to put blue_block_2 back on the table, which would undo that. So no.

Alternatively, after moving blue_block_2 to the table, we need to put white_block_2 on the table. Then, we can use white_block_2 to stack on red_block_1. So:

1. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2

2. putdown blue_block_2

3. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1

4. stack white_block_2 red_block_1 → this would put white_block_2 on red_block_1, satisfying constraint 4.

Then, putdown white_block_2. No, that's not possible. Because after step3, we're holding white_block_2. If we stack it on red_block_1, then white_block_2 is on red_block_1. Then, to put white_block_2 on the table, we'd need to unstack it again, which adds steps.

Alternatively, after step3 (holding white_block_2), put it down (step4), then pick up red_block_1 and stack it on something else. But that's more steps.

Alternatively, after step3, stack white_block_2 on red_block_1. Then, white_block_2 is on red_block_1. This satisfies constraint 4 (something on red_block_1), and white_block_2 is not on the table, but we need to have white_block_2 on the table. So this would fail constraint 2.

So that's not allowed.

Hmm. This suggests that the original plan is the most efficient way, with 10 steps.

But wait, perhaps there's a way to achieve the constraints in fewer steps. Let's think again.

After achieving the main goal (steps 1-2), we need to move white_block_2 to table (steps 3-4). Then, for constraint 4 and 6.

Instead of unstacking red_block_1 and purple_block_1, what if we use purple_block_1 to satisfy constraint 6 by stacking it on grey_block_1, but purple_block_1 is under red_block_1. So we have to first unstack red_block_1.

But then, after unstacking red_block_1 and putting it down, we can stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1. Then, we can stack red_block_1 on purple_block_1, but that would not help. Alternatively, stack red_block_1 on something else.

Wait, perhaps:

Steps after main goal and white_block_2 on table:

5. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1 → holding red_block_1

6. stack red_block_1 grey_block_1 → red_block_1 on grey_block_1

Now, constraint 4: red_block_1 has something on top? No. But grey_block_1 is now under red_block_1. But we need something on red_block_1. So this doesn't help. Also, purple_block_1 is now clear, so we can stack it on grey_block_1:

7. pickup purple_block_1 → holding purple_block_1

8. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1 → but grey_block_1 has red_block_1 on top. So we can't stack there. So this approach doesn't work.

Alternatively, after step5, putdown red_block_1, then stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1. Then stack red_block_1 on purple_block_1. But that would require more steps.

Alternatively, after step5, stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1. But after step5, purple_block_1 is on the table (since we unstacked red_block_1 from it). So:

5. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1 → holding red_block_1

6. putdown red_block_1 → red_block_1 on table

7. pickup purple_block_1 → holding purple_block_1

8. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1 → constraint 6 satisfied.

Now, to satisfy constraint 4, stack red_block_1 on something. But we need to put something on red_block_1. So:

9. pickup red_block_1 → holding red_block_1

10. stack red_block_1 something → but what? Available clear blocks are white_block_1 (has blue_block_1), blue_block_1 (clear), white_block_2, blue_block_2, grey_block_1 (under purple_block_1), purple_block_1 (under grey_block_1?), no.

Wait, after step8, purple_block_1 is on grey_block_1. So grey_block_1 is under purple_block_1. So grey_block_1 is not clear. The clear blocks are white_block_1 (has blue_block_1 on top → not clear), blue_block_1 (clear), white_block_2 (clear), blue_block_2 (clear), red_block_1 (clear), and purple_block_1 (on grey_block_1 → not clear).

So, to stack red_block_1 on something, we can use blue_block_1, white_block_2, blue_block_2.

If we stack red_block_1 on blue_block_1:

Action9: pickup red_block_1

Action10: stack red_block_1 blue_block_1

This would make blue_block_1 not clear, and red_block_1 on top. But does this satisfy constraint 4? No, because constraint 4 requires that red_block_1 has something on top. This would make red_block_1 clear. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, stack something on red_block_1. For example, pick up blue_block_1 and stack it on red_block_1:

Action9: pickup blue_block_1

Action10: stack blue_block_1 red_block_1

This would make red_block_1 not clear (constraint 4 satisfied).

So total steps:

1. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2

2. putdown blue_block_2

3. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1

4. putdown white_block_2

5. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1

6. putdown red_block_1

7. pickup purple_block_1

8. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1

9. pickup blue_block_1

10. stack blue_block_1 red_block_1

Same as original plan. So 10 steps.

Is this the minimal possible? Let's see.

Alternative approach: When moving white_block_2 to the table, can we use it to satisfy another constraint?

For example, after step3 (holding white_block_2), instead of putting it down, stack it on red_block_1. This would satisfy constraint 4 (something on red_block_1), but then we have to put it down to satisfy constraint 2. So:

3. stack white_block_2 red_block_1 → now white_block_2 is on red_block_1. Constraint 4 satisfied.

But constraint 2 requires white_block_2 to be on the table in some state after the initial. So now, white_block_2 is on red_block_1. To satisfy constraint 2, we need to eventually put white_block_2 on the table. So we'd have to unstack it again:

4. unstack white_block_2 red_block_1

5. putdown white_block_2

This adds steps, making the total steps longer. So this approach is worse.

Thus, it seems the original plan of 10 steps is the minimal. But let's check again.

Wait, after step 8 in the original plan, purple_block_1 is on grey_block_1. Then, in step9, we pick up blue_block_1 and stack it on red_block_1. But blue_block_1 was on white_block_1. So after step9, white_block_1 is clear. So when we pick up blue_block_1, white_block_1 becomes clear. But that's okay, as long as we don't need to use it for anything.

But the constraints don't mention white_block_1, so it's fine.

Another observation: The constraints require that certain conditions hold in at least one state. So for example, the first constraint requires that red_block_1 is not on white_block_1 in at least one state. Since this is true initially, and we never put red_block_1 on white_block_1, this condition holds throughout. Similarly for the other constraints that are already satisfied initially.

But the conditional constraints (the "if" ones) require that when a certain condition holds in a state, another condition must hold in that state or later. So for example, the second constraint: whenever red_block_1 is not on white_block_1 (which is always true), then white_block_2 must be on the table at some point. Since we move white_block_2 to the table in step4, that's satisfied.

Thus, the original plan meets all constraints.

Now, let's verify each step's preconditions:

1. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2:

- Pre: blue_block_2 is on white_block_2, blue_block_2 is clear, arm empty.

Yes. Initial state: blue_block_2 is on white_block_2 and clear. Arm is empty.

2. putdown blue_block_2:

- Pre: holding blue_block_2. Yes.

3. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1:

- Pre: white_block_2 is on blue_block_1, white_block_2 is clear (after step1, white_block_2 is under blue_block_2, but after step2, blue_block_2 is on table, so white_block_2 is on blue_block_1 and clear. So yes.

4. putdown white_block_2:

- Pre: holding white_block_2. Yes.

5. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1:

- Pre: red_block_1 is on purple_block_1, red_block_1 is clear, arm empty.

After step4, arm is empty. red_block_1 is on purple_block_1 and clear. Yes.

6. putdown red_block_1:

- Pre: holding red_block_1. Yes.

7. pickup purple_block_1:

- Pre: purple_block_1 is on table, clear (after step5, red_block_1 was unstacked from purple_block_1, so purple_block_1 is on table and clear). Arm is empty. Yes.

8. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1:

- Pre: holding purple_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear. After step7, grey_block_1 is on table and clear. Yes.

9. pickup blue_block_1:

- Pre: blue_block_1 is on white_block_1, clear. After step3, white_block_2 was unstacked from blue_block_1, so blue_block_1 is on white_block_1 and clear. Arm is empty. Yes.

10. stack blue_block_1 red_block_1:

- Pre: holding blue_block_1, red_block_1 is clear. After step6, red_block_1 is on table and clear. Yes.

All actions' preconditions are satisfied. The effects are handled correctly.

Thus, this plan is valid and meets all constraints with 10 steps. I don't see a shorter way to achieve all constraints and the goal.
